        "meta_description": "Accelerating climate action and creating vibrant resilient neighborhoods   The Detroit Climate Strategy, informed by input of thousands of Detroiters, calls for our city to transition to clean renewable energy by 2034. The Neighborhood Solar initiative is the first step toward achieving these goals to address climate change in our city by providing clean energy, combat illegal dumping, and engaging communities and nonprofits to stabilize neighborhoods. The Detroit Climate Strategy set goals for the City to power 100% of its municipal buildings with clean energy by 2034 and a three-year target to work with utility provider and private property owners to source 50% of Detroit’s electricity from clean energy.",

        "text": "Mayor Duggan's Neighborhood Solar Initiative aims to repurpose mostly vacant lots in Detroit neighborhoods into sites of clean energy production. While some areas have vacant homes, there are still occupied residences within the designated sites. The goal is to select neighborhood sites totaling 250 acres of neighborhood land needed to offset municipal solar.\n\nThe project is part of Detroit's broader sustainability goals, targeting a 100% offset of municipal energy usage with renewable sources. The solar arrays will generate 33 megawatts of solar energy (21 in phase 1), significantly contributing to the city’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from municipal buildings. Once connected to the electrical grid, these solar arrays will begin to offset the electricity required to operate 127 city buildings, including City Hall, police and fire stations, and recreation centers.\n\nFirst 3 Solar Neighborhoods Chosen\n\nOn June 24, Mayor Duggan announced the first three finalist neighborhoods selected to host solar arrays:\n\nGratiot Findlay\n\nVan Dyke/Lynch\n\nState Fair\n\nFinalist Site Maps\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nLed by the Office of Sustainability and working closely with the Department of Neighborhoods, city officials partnered with local solar experts, or Neighborhood Solar Partners (NSPs), will work with five to six neighborhoods to host solar arrays .A coalition of local nonprofits, environmental groups, and energy experts have been instrumental in supporting the initiative. These partners assist with resident engagement, technical evaluations, and implementation of community benefits.\n\nWatch Mayor Duggan’s Solar Speech\n\nThe initiative followed a thorough, months-long community engagement process collaboratively led by the City of Detroit's Office of Sustainability, Department of Neighborhoods and NSPs, involving dozens of neighborhood meetings. This effort ensured that residents were informed and could express their interest in hosting solar arrays, resulting in the selection of the Gratiot/Findlay, Van Dyke/Lynch, and State Fair neighborhoods as the first three solar neighborhoods.\n\nRigorous community engagement and residents' wishes are prioritized throughout the selection process.\n\nNeighborhood Solar Partners (NSPs):\n\nGreen Door Initiative\n\nEcoWorks\n\nD2 Solar\n\nMI Interfaith Power and Light\n\nPeace Tree\n\nSustainable Community Farms\n\nWalker-Miller Energy\n\nRescue MI Nature\n\nManistique Community Treehouse Center\n\nRyter Cooperatives\n\nFirst Family Solar\n\nAnti-Gravity, LLC\n\nSDEV\n\nEnergy Alliance\n\nCommunity Benefits\n\nResidents of occupied homes within the solar footprint will receive the following on a voluntary basis:\n\nCompensation equal to double the market value (or $90,000 minimum) of their property, along with moving expenses and relocation services.\n\nAny renters will receive 18 months' worth of rent along with moving expenses and relocation services.\n\nThe initiative includes energy efficiency upgrades for surrounding homes, with a minimum value of $15,000 on average per home.\n\nEach acre contributed will be provided with up to $25,000 in community benefits for energy-efficient upgrades, prioritizing affected homeowners and renters within the solar array footprint.\n\nEach neighbor will choose to use these benefits to reduce their energy burden, for any of the following, reducing energy bills by 10-20%:\n\nWindows\n\nRoof repairs\n\nEnergy efficient appliances\n\nEnergy Efficient furnaces and hot water heaters\n\nHome insulation and air sealing\n\nSmart thermostats\n\nEnergy-efficient lighting\n\nBattery back-up\n\nResidential Solar Panels\n\nTo receive the home energy efficiency upgrades, a homeowner must have lived in their home within the qualifying neighborhood boundaries as of December 31, 2023 and be living in that home through the date when the home energy efficiency upgrades are being performed. The City has been working through the Department of Neighborhoods and Assessor’s Office to identify owner-occupied homes within the neighborhood boundary, and will continue to perform outreach to connect homeowners with available resources, including the home energy efficiency upgrades following City Council’s approval of the contract.\n\nThese solar arrays are expected to generate enough power to offset electricity usage for city buildings. With the backing of the community and rigorous technical evaluation, the initiative promises not only environmental benefits but also community advantages for residents in the surrounding areas.\n\nEquity fund for homeowners caught in limbo waiting for Phase 2\n\nThe 5 remaining neighborhoods competing for Phase 2 selection will not know their future until 2025. There are 31 owner-occupied homes in those 5 neighborhoods who have already signed option agreements to sell their homes, if selected, but they are now placed in a limbo period in which it will be impossible to do anything with their homes. The City is proposing a $4.4 million equity fund, paid from reserves in the Utility Conversion Fund, so that any of those 31 homeowners can exercise their option to sell their homes and move out of the neighborhood.\n\nSolar Fields required to be returned to the City as greenfield sites when no longer generating power\n\nUnder the agreements, the Solar Fields will be operated for at least 25-35 years generating solar power. Whenever their useful life as solar fields comes to an end, the contracts require the developers to remove all of the solar equipment and return the property to the city as a green field.\n\nNo zoning changes required for a city public project\n\nUnder Michigan law, residential use zoning restrictions do not apply to city decisions to site city projects like police stations, fire stations, parks, recreation centers, and utilities. The city is creating city-owned solar fields to generate renewable energy to offset the electricity demands of city buildings. No zoning changes are required.\n\nNeighborhood Solar Initiative timeline:\n\nNeighborhood Solar Initiative launch:\n\nIn June 2023, Mayor Duggan announced the solar initiative.\n\nNeighborhoods interested in hosting solar fields will receive community benefits.\n\nIn December, the request for proposals from potential solar developers opened. The deadline to submit closed on Friday, February 23rd. The City will evaluate the proposals along with the level of support to determine the final winning neighborhoods for the proposed solar arrays.\n\nOngoing Community Engagement:\n\nThroughout the citywide initiative’s process, the Office of Sustainability and the Department of Neighborhoods are working closely with Neighborhood Solar Partners to engage community groups, block clubs, and area residents to ensure area residents’ considerations are addressed and prioritized.\n\nDepartment of Neighborhoods hosted meetings in neighborhoods with 10 or more vacant acres to share the opportunity. The city partnered with long standing environmental community organizations to support neighborhoods in applying to utilize vacant land for solar generation, 19 neighborhoods applied.\n\nDepartment of Neighborhoods held over 60 meetings in the neighborhoods to engage neighbors, get feedback and plan for the installation. At these meetings, residents drew the boundaries of the solar footprint and community benefits zone.\n\nFinal Neighborhood Selection:\n\nNeighborhood expression of interest petition deadline closed on February 15, 2024\n\nCommunities with the highest number of resident buy-in became finalists. Nine finalists were selected last November, and now we're down to the final eight.\n\nFinal site selections will require City Council approval.\n\nPhase 1 of the Neighborhood Solar Initiative will transform 104 acres of mostly vacant, blighted areas into clean,\n\nrenewable energy.\n\nThe first 3 finalist neighborhoods are: Gratiot/Findlay, State Fair and Van Dyke/Lynch.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThe plan is for the Office of Sustainability, The Department of Neighborhoods, our Neighborhood Solar Partners and the solar developers to work with the community and get their insight into how the sites will look.\n\nThere will be a negotiated and approved agreement between the developer and residents, which will include what the design, vegetation and maintenance will be for each solar neighborhood before any construction work begins.\n\nTo begin the next step of the process, the Mayor’s office has transmitted several documents to City Council for approval. Those include:\n\nResolutions for the acquisition of private property in each of the three neighborhoods to assemble the land needed for the proposed solar arrays\n\nContracts with two developers selected following a procurement process\n\nResolution to create an equity fund for voluntary purchases of owner-occupied homes in the five remaining solar neighborhood finalist areas.\n\nPhase 1, covering 103 acres, will begin site preparation in late fall 2024. The city plans to select additional neighborhoods for solar array development in early 2025 and potentially more in 2026 to power city streetlights, ensuring a continuous expansion of the initiative.\n\nReducing Emissions, Lowering Energy Costs, and Building a Sustainable Future\n\nThe Solar Neighborhood Initiative not only aims to reduce emissions and energy costs but also promotes quality jobs, community wealth-building, and energy resilience. It aligns with the Detroit Climate Strategy and broader national goals set by the Biden-Harris Administration, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future for Detroit residents.\n\nThe initiative is crucial for achieving Detroit's goal of reducing municipal greenhouse gas by 35% by 2024 per the 2019 City Council approved GHG Ordinance. The Neighborhood Solar Initiative will offset emissions 23% of 2012 levels. Combined with the business-as-usual anticipated decrease of 13%, the City will be on track to achieve our municipal goals with a 36% reduction.\n\nStay Updated"
