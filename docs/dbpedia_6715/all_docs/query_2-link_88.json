        "text": "Is Rooftop Solar a Fit for My House?#\n\nGoogle's Project Sunroof is a free tool to assess your roof's solar potential. Does your roof or installation site have uninterrupted sun from 9 a.m.-3 p.m.? Savings suggested by Project Sunroof are likely inaccurate because the method is not disclosed and not tied to current Fort Collins Utilities rates. Seek specific savings analysis from a Participating Solar Contractor to determine if solar is a fit for your home.\n\nConsider also the age and condition of your roof. Removing a solar PV system to replace a roof can be expensive, so it is recommended to replace or upgrade an old roof before installing a solar system.\n\nSizing Your Solar PV System#\n\nSolar PV system designers often choose a system size to meet a certain percentage of a household's annual energy consumption. Though a solar PV system provides a portion of the energy your household consumes over the course of a year, it will sometimes produce more than needed and will produce less than needed at other times (nighttime or cloudy days). Your home will stay connected to the Fort Collins Utilities electric grid so you have reliable electricity during these fluctuations. How you select the right size for your solar PV system will be a balance of your priorities:\n\nTotal cost budget, monthly payments and cash flow\n\nGoals for offsetting energy from the grid\n\nAvailable sunny space on your roof or property\n\nSolar PV system size is limited to either 12 kilowatts or to one that produces no more than 200% of your average annual energy load (based on a 24-month period), including all dedicated generation sources. For solar systems that are not owned by the property owner, such as leased systems, maximum solar system sizing is limited to 120% of intended renewable energy offset.\n\nIf your home is new or you recently moved in, Fort Collins Utilities can provide a solar system size analysis based on other estimation methods. We also consider sizing adjustments upon request to account for significant changes to electric load, such as adding an electric vehicle.\n\nYou can share energy consumption history with solar contractors through the MyData platform or by sharing your bills.\n\nWhile it's important to properly manage trees to minimize shading on a solar array, Utilities does not advocate removing healthy trees to install solar. Please consult the City’s Forestry Department and work with a licensed ISA-certified arborist to ensure trees stay healthy as part of the solar installation process.\n\nIf tree work is required, the City's Forestry Department website maintains a list of qualified, licensed arborists permitted to work in Fort Collins. Feel free to also contact the Forestry Department at forestry@fcgov.com if you have additional questions.\n\nTrees around your home add significant value to your property and can play a very important role in reducing your energy and water consumption. Trees provide many benefits including:\n\nRemoving carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\n\nReducing energy costs (up to 50%)\n\nShading\n\nReducing heating costs by serving as winter wind barriers\n\nReducing water usage\n\nIncreasing your home’s property value (upwards of 20%)\n\nLicensed Arborists\n\nInterview Contractors #\n\nWhen you're ready to consider proposals for solar at your home, be sure to work with a Participating Solar Contractor, so that you can access the Residential Solar Rebate. The listed contractors have completed orientation to understand how solar works with the rates, program incentives and codes that apply in Fort Collins. Contractors typically guide you in the installation process and manage submitting all required documentation for the solar interconnection and rebate.\n\nTalk with solar contractors to understand their business and experience. You might ask:\n\nHow long has your company been in business? Where is it based? How long have you been doing business in Fort Collins?\n\nIf a contractor comes to solicit at your door, do they have a solicitor ID badge issued by the City of Fort Collins?\n\nDo you install the solar PV system yourself, or subcontract that work?\n\nWill your NABCEP-certified installers be present for the entire installation?\n\nCan you provide references from recent customers in the Fort Collins area?\n\nDo you provide a performance guarantee and warranty workmanship of the system? How long?\n\nHow do you calculate what system will be the best for me?\n\nIs the price you provide a guaranteed total cost or is it just an estimate?\n\nCan you show me the financial impact of installing solar panels using my actual on-peak and off-peak consumption data with Fort Collins net meter rules?\n\nYou can review the company's performance with the Better Business Bureau and check for reviews on social media for the experience of local customers.\n\nEvaluating Proposals#\n\nTo compare proposals from different vendors, consider that the different proposed designs may be different sizes and could be designed for different system lifespans. To compensate for these variables, compare the system costs in dollars ($), as well as the cost per kilowatt (kW) (divide the total cost by the size in DC-kW to get $/kW). The average cost of solar installations in Fort Collins has been between $3,500 to $4,000 per kW DC in recent years, excluding systems with battery storage.\n\nWhen you compare proposals, consider:\n\nWarranties for the equipment, system workmanship\n\nAny guarantee of performance from the systems proposed\n\nWho is responsible to provide ongoing support for any maintenance, warranty, or repairs needed\n\nSolar leases can require payment in full if you sell the home, or they may be transferable (requiring the buyer to submit to the lease terms)\n\nDon't be afraid to ask pointed questions if anything in the proposal is unclear.\n\nSolar electric systems (including battery storage charged by solar) are eligible for the 30% federal investment tax credit if placed in service before the end of 2032. It will decrease to 26% for systems installed in 2033 and to 22% for systems installed in 2034. The tax credit expires starting in 2035, unless Congress renews it. For details, see the Homeowner’s Guide to the Federal Tax Credit for Solar Photovoltaics.\n\nCustomers may file IRS Form 5695 Residential Energy Credit for costs in the most recent calendar year related to solar PV installation, including batteries charged by the solar PV array. No forms or information are required from Fort Collins Utilities to complete this filing. Carryover costs from the prior year are also documented using this form.\n\nLearn More About State Incentives:\n\nState of Colorado Sales Tax Exemptions & Deductions\n\nState of Colorado Renewable and Clean Energy Assessment\n\nState of Colorado Sales & Use Tax Topics: Renewable Energy Components\n\nPurchased a Home with Solar Already Installed?#\n\nWelcome to the community of solar owners!\n\nAll property owners with solar or battery storage installed on their property must have an Interconnection and Net Metering Participation Agreement on file with Fort Collins Utilities. If you purchased a property with an existing solar or battery system, please register as the new account holder using the button below. Afterwards, we’ll email you the agreement followed by a special certificate to keep with your records.\n\nTo learn more about solar in Fort Collins, and how solar credits are reflected on your energy bill, see the 'Net Metering' section under the 'Incentives' tab. Read through the 'Solar Resources' and contact us if you have further questions.\n\nNew Account Holder Registration\n\nWhat's the Payback On a Solar Investment?#\n\nBy generating your own solar energy, you will reduce the energy consumed from the Fort Collins Utilities grid. The amount of energy you generate and the monthly bill impacts will vary throughout the year, with the greatest energy production near the summer solstice, and the lowest energy production near the winter solstice. Fort Collins Utilities and solar contractors use sophisticated computer models to estimate how much energy a model solar PV system can generate based on its location, local weather, the orientation of the array or multiple arrays, and other equipment specifications. To estimate the financial return of an investment in solar PV, these models also incorporate electric utility rates, and assumptions about how those rates may change over time, financing rates, and degradation in the efficiency of the solar array production.\n\nAsk solar contractors for analysis of the financial benefits with their proposal.\n\nFort Collins Utilities' recommends working with the members of the Participating Solar Contractor Network listed below. Contractors in the Network have committed to conduct their business according to a code of ethics and the Solar Energy Industries Association Solar Business Code.\n\nResidential Solar Rebates are only available to customers who work with active Participating Solar Contractors through purchasing and installation of their solar PV system. Customers are encouraged to solicit competitive bids from two or more contractors. Use Utilities' MyData portal to share your energy history data with contractors that have registered for this service.\n\nThis list is updated periodically as contractors join or leave the network. Consult the Better Business Bureau and social media sites for additional consumer feedback.\n\nCompany Name MyData Link Phone Colorado based Email Sales/ Marketing Design Install Battery Install A.

No warranty regarding the accuracy of the information, experience, quality of service, licensure, or proof of insurance or bonding is implied by listing a contractor in the Network. Under the City of Fort Collins Charter, Municipal Code, and City Manager’s Policies, the City is unable to recommend or endorse any individual contractor, without regard to those listed in the Network.\n\nSuspended Solar Contractors\n\nThe following contractors are not active in the Participating Solar Contractor Network but can be engaged to develop solar PV projects. Customers working with these contractors are not eligible for Residential Solar Rebates, battery incentives or Epic Loans.\n\nAuric Solar\n\nBello Solar Energy\n\nTotal Solar Solutions\n\nAvolta\n\n1Solar\n\nEvident Solar\n\nWhen you generate solar power, any energy you don't use immediately flows back into the electric grid. Fort Collins Utilities pays for the energy returned to the grid through net metering credits on your monthly utility bill based on current residential rates.\n\nYour utilities bill only shows credits for the energy that you could not use in your home as it was produced. Only your solar production report from your solar inverter, or your solar provider, tracks all the energy your system produces. Your Fort Collins Utilities electric meter does not track that solar production; it only records the energy you purchase from the grid and the energy you return to the grid. Have a look at this infographic for more information.\n\nEnergy credits are allowed to offset other charges on the monthly utility bill. Accumulated bill credits can roll forward to the next month. Installing battery storage is the only way to bank solar energy in your home."
