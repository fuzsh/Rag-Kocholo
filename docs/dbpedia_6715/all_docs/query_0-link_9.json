It gives the complete history of the Company & IH's involvement, time table, ect.!\n\nI never realized that IH didn't sell it until 1981, I was always told it was the late '60's? They did keep it almost 'till the very end. It must have been a bright spot in their bleak financial mess.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nhttp://mysolar.cat.com/cda/layout?m=35503&x=7\n\nIH RD\n\nThank You!\n\nI am trying to research the corporate history of IH\n\nThis web-link has helped me find information on the \"Solar\" Division of IH\n\nThe word \"Solar\" has a different meaning these days.\n\nTry searching the Internet for \"international solar\" and you end up looking at solar panels etc.\n\nIH built an experimental gas turbine tractor called, the HT-340, I think.\n\nIt was basically a 340 Utility chassis fiited with a gas turbine engine.\n\nI assume the Solar Division would have built the engine.\n\nRegards from Michael Halsall\n\nAustralia\n\nThe research tractor HT-340 with gas turbine was built in 1961 and had a hydrostatic transmission which lead the way to the later IH Hydro tractors.\n\nYa, they said that tractor was on display at the Smithonian (sp?) Institute out in DC. I was out there 4 years ago, but didn't see it (was one of the main reasons I went ). Although there was a 1086 & some other IH equipment -made it worth while !\n\nIH RD\n\nBeen quite a few yrs ago when I was trucking, had tolayover with a wide load on a holiday. went to the Smithsonian and saw a Ford 9N or similar with a turbine engine. It also had an oil leak that warrented a large drip pan under it!!\n\nEnjoyed those huge RR steamengines and the US flag from FT Sumpter hanging in the stairwell. Gave me goosebumps looking at that history..."
