        "text": "It’s true that when your solar panels are completely snow/ice covered, they will only be able to generate a portion of their typical energy output because less sunlight is able to pass thru the snow/ice cover. Don’t worry, this is more than taken care of by the long, sunny summer days. We recommend not trying to clear the solar modules. Getting onto a roof in inclement weather is dangerous and using any type of tool or chemical on the modules themselves can damage the modules, wiring and possibly void any manufacture warranty.\n\nThat being said, this is nothing to be concerned about because:\n\n• Solar creates more efficient energy at cooler temperatures.\n\n• Light can still penetrate a thin layer of snow/ice and allow for energy production.\n\n• The angle of the solar modules and their ability to produce some heat allows for the snow to slide directly off your modules faster than snow would fall off your roof, quickly returning your system to its full potential.\n\n• Snow sliding off panels, as it melts, simultaneously cleans them.\n\nEagle Point Solar’s design and engineering team factor in shorter days, winter weather, and less direct sunlight into account to optimize your system based on decades of weather data from your local weather station. Therefore, as a percentage of overall yearly production the loss from snow/ice is very minimal.\n\nFor more information, read our blog article Snow & Your Solar Array.\n\nYour existing solar array is certainly a valuable investment and you have enjoyed the benefits of clean, free solar energy… now you need to make an informed decision with regard to your new location.\n\nOption 1: Take the system with you\n\nBefore you jump into this option it is necessary to look into building codes, rules and regulations for the new property. Some properties are simply better candidates for solar than others due to shading, roof specifications, utility policy and new local rules and regulations which may have been put in place since your solar energy system was purchased and installed. There are situations were the cost of removing, transporting and reinstalling your existing system may be equal or more than installing a new system at your new location.\n\nOption 2: Leave the solar energy system behind\n\nWithout a doubt, selling the house with solar will make your life easier, help it sell faster and for more money. Solar is a great selling feature for homeowners who are interested in living green or who want a low electric bill. The funds generated from a higher selling price can be used to purchase a new system designed and engineered specifically for your new property location. A new solar energy system will provide new equipment warranties, greater efficiency and may be eligible for incentives, grants or other programs to help further offset the cost. Here are some reasons why you should consider leaving your existing array behind.\n\n• Your existing array was professionally designed, engineered and custom built for your current property. It was designed specifically for your roof or ground layout taking into account the geography of the region with regard to sunlight exposure, shading, weather data and your home’s energy usage.\n\n• Your new home may consume more or less energy than your existing system was designed to produce. Either way, you will need to assess your new property and have it properly examined by a solar design and engineering expert to achieve optimal results using your existing equipment. A new design, plot plan, contract, interconnection agreement and construction documentation will be required to be completed using your existing equipment.\n\n• Your new home may not have a similar roofline or ground space to maximize positioning of the panels to capture the same amount of energy. You may need to add more panels or equipment to obtain a similar amount of energy offset as your previous location.\n\n• If you remove your existing system, you could greatly reduce the current value of your property since it is no longer capable of producing clean, renewable and sustainable energy for the future homeowners.\n\n• If your existing system is roof-mounted, you will need to patch and repair any roof sections once the system is removed. For a ground system, you will need to fill in the holes where the support beams where pounded into the ground.\n\nEagle Point Solar recommends leaving your solar energy system at the property it was first installed on. It typically makes the most sense to leave the old system behind and purchase a new, more efficient system, custom designed for the new property to achieve the best solar energy results."
