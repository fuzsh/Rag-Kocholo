Our policies and procedures relating to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) are unwavering: forced labor is strictly prohibited in our supply chain and we will not enter into vendor agreements with manufacturers, suppliers or vendors that use or are suspected of using forced labor.\n\nThis dedication carries over to our material selection processes, as well. We incorporate only the highest quality, ethically sourced materials that also allow our products to avoid application of antidumping and countervailing duties, including those that may result from the April 24 petition requesting investigation of the potentially illegal solar-related trade practices of four Southeast Asian countries. In fact, our dedication to fighting unfair trade practices is the reason we petitioned the Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Commission for such an investigation. Maintaining our ethical and sustainable supply chain is essential to our product. It is essential to your confidence in Mission Solar as well."
