        "text": "ALOHA!\n\nThe State of Hawai‘i has a bold energy agenda — to achieve 100 percent clean energy by the year 2045. Along with reducing our islands’ dependency on fossil fuels and increasing efficiency measures, the clean energy plan is also contributing to the state’s economic growth. Because Hawai‘i is committed to re-powering the clean energy market, we have embraced bold solutions that will help develop this competitive industry, making Hawai‘i one of the leaders in the clean energy race.\n\nThe Hawai‘i State Energy Office leads statewide energy security and resilience initiatives while catalyzing energy independence and decarbonization.\n\nHawai‘i’s ENERGY Story\n\nLife on the Hawaiian archipelago has been shaped by elemental energy sources — wind, water, earth, sun, moon, and sky. The Hawaiian creation story told through the Kumulipo tells of the interconnected relationship between humankind and nature. An ancestral link to nature’s life-giving and life-sustaining energy is a core feature of the Hawaiian cultural value system. We often see it expressed through mālama ‘āina: the care and stewardship of the environment and natural resources. Energy is a shared natural resource that connects us to the past and provides our foundation for the future.\n\nHSEO fulfills its mission to residents through strategy and thought leadership; program design and implementation; analysis, reporting, and data collection and sharing; regulatory support; and education, outreach, and community/public engagement."
