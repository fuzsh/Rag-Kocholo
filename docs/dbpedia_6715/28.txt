Solar Turbines offers complete gas turbine power plant solutions, tailored to your power and heat/cooling requirements. We are a leading producer of industrial gas turbines and turbomachinery packages. These turbine driven generator sets are designed for base load electricity, combined heat and power, combined cycle, dispersed power, and peak shaving applications. Besides the electric power, these units can produce hot air, hot water, and steam, which can then be used in the production process for drying or heating purposes. The units are designed to operate in harsh mining environments and are capable of operating on a variety of liquid and gaseous fuels, as well as dual fuel (diesel & gas). For quick power solutions, Solar Turbines also offers mobile power units. These units can be easily relocated and are designed for quick installation.
