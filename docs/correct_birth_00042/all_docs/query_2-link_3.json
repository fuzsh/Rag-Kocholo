It was given its current name in 1798 when the county and its seat were named for Revolutionary War leader John Barnwell (1748–1800), who headed a militia in South Carolina. Barnwell County originally stretched from the Savannah River on the west almost to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBuilt in 1832, the South Carolina Railroad connected Charleston to Hamburg, near Augusta, Georgia, upriver on the Savannah River. The designation of two stops on the railroad led to the development of the towns of Blackville and Williston in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nBarnwell gave generously to the Confederate cause. Its most distinguished participant was Confederate General Johnson Hagood, who was later elected as governor of South Carolina, serving from 1880 until 1882.\n\nWhen Union General Judson Kilpatrick was in Barnwell, as part of General Sherman's March to the Sea, his horses were stabled in the Episcopal Church of the Holy Apostles; the baptismal font in the church was used to water the horses.[9]\n\nBanksia Hall, Bethlehem Baptist Church, Church of the Holy Apostles Rectory, Church of the Holy Apostles, Episcopal, and Old Presbyterian Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[10]\n\nBarnwell has a public library, a branch of the ABBE Regional Library System.[11]\n\nThe climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.
