        "text": "Everyone knows James Brown as the 'Godfather of Soul'.\n\nSome call him 'Mr. Dynamite, others call him 'Soul Brother No. 1', and some refer to him as 'the Hardest Working Man in Show Business'.\n\nWhatever you prefer to call James Brown, there's no doubting that he was one of the most influential and impactful musicians of the 20th century.\n\nThroughout his career which spanned more than 50 years, Brown performed his uniquely energetic brand of R&B, soul, and gospel to global audiences, and is widely considered to have invented the funk music genre.\n\nRelive Pavarotti and James Brown’s incredible duet of ‘It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World’\n\nRemembering Chadwick Boseman's excellent portrayal of James Brown in Get On Up\n\nWas James Brown murdered? A new investigation has been opened\n\nAmongst his many accolades, James Brown achieved Brown 17 separate No.1 singles on the US Billboard R&B Charts and also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that did not reach No.1.\n\nRanked 7th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, James Brown was one of the first-ever inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and has won three Grammy Awards.\n\nAway from music, Brown was advocate for education, humanitarianism, and civil rights throughout his life, frequently performing concerts and releasing songs that benefitted those causes.\n\nWhere and when was James Brown born?\n\nJames Joseph Brown was born on 3rd May 1933 in Barnwell, South Carolina, United States. His name was intended to be Joseph James Brown, but the order of his names were confused on his birth certificate.\n\nHe was born into poverty to his 16-year old mother Susie and his 21-year-old father Joseph Gardner Brown, who lived in a small shack.\n\nThe family eventually moved and settled in one of his Aunt's brothels, but James and his mother fled to New York to escape the abuse from his father.\n\nHow did James Brown get his start in music?\n\nAfter a disruption heavy early life, James Brown was imprisoned at a juvenile detention centre at the age of 16 for theft.\n\nIt was inside that he started a gospel quartet with fellow inmates, which would spur on his musical career once he was free.\n\nSinging in similar groups for several years, Brown eventually joined The Famous Flames. Once the original lineup disbanded, he re-formed them as James Brown and his Famous Flames.\n\nIn October 1958, Brown released the ballad 'Try Me' which hit the top spot on the R&B chart in the beginning of 1959, becoming the first of his seventeen chart-topping singles and the beginning of his incredible musical journey.\n\nWhat are James Brown’s biggest songs?\n\n- 'It's A Man's Man's World'\n\n- I Got You (I Feel Good)'\n\n- 'Papa's Got A Brand New Bag'.\n\n- 'The Payback'\n\n- 'Living In America'\n\n- 'Say It Loud - I'm Black And Proud'\n\n- 'Get Up Offa That Thing'\n\n- 'Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine'\n\n- 'Super Bad'\n\n- 'The Boss'\n\nWhat is James Brown’s musical legacy?\n\nStarting out with more gospel-inspired soul ballads, James Brown later injected more energy into his music which would evolve into funk.\n\nHe is thought to be one of the first mainstream stars to profoundly 'Africanise' music, putting a major focus on rhythm and emotion.\n\nHis music only has been immensely influential, inspiring countless R&B, pop, and even hip-hop stars that followed.\n\nIn terms of his stage presence, James Brown drew from the gospel preachers he'd experienced as a child.\n\nHe channelled that same style of acting possessed or being taken over by a higher spirit into his sharply choreographed, high-energy dance moves.\n\nMichael Jackson for instance called James Brown his \"greatest inspiration\" who encouraged a young Jackson to explore dance as much as singing.\n\nHow many times was James Brown married?\n\nJames Brown was married a total of three times, with a fourth marriage to backing singer Tomi Rae Hynie considered to be unofficial after he died, which the singer still claims to be legitimate.\n\nHe was married to ​Velma Warren from 1953 to 1969 and Deidre Jenkins from 1970 to 1981, but both marriages resulted in divorce because of domestic abuse claims against Brown.\n\nBrown was married to Adrienne Rodriguez from 1984 to 1996 when she died, though she filed for divorce in 1988 \"citing years of cruelty treatment\" before they reconciled.\n\nHe has had multiple children with various wives and partners, though has only officially recognised nine as his legitimate children.\n\nWhen did James Brown die and what was the cause of death?\n\nJames Brown died on Christmas Day (25th December) on 2006 at the age of 73.\n\nThe cause of death was congestive heart failure as a result of complications with pneumonia.\n\nWhat was James Brown's net worth?\n\nJames Brown's estimated net worth of $100 million at the time of his death in 2006.\n\nAny other facts we should know about James Brown?\n\nJames Brown was notoriously strict about his stage show, and if band members were caught meddling with drink and drugs, or missed a beat he'd either fine or fire them on the spot.\n\nHis career nose-dived during the disco era, until comedian John Belushi invited him to appear in The Blues Brothers which rejuvenated his fortunes throughout the 1980s, going on to appear in the boxing franchise sequel Rocky IV.\n\nBefore even considering music, he had a promising baseball career ahead of him until he severely injured his leg.\n\nJames Brown is officially the most sampled musician of all time, with over 3,000 recorded samples of his back catalogue, with rapper Chuck D later vouching: \"There’d be no hip-hop without James Brown.\""
