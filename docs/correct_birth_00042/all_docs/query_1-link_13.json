        "text": "James Brown was a man of many nicknames: Godfather of Soul, the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, Soul Brother Number One, Mr. Dynamite. Added together, those names paint a picture of one of the most dynamic and influential musical artists of the 20th century.\n\nThough he’s often associated with Augusta, Georgia, where he spent much of his life, Brown was a South Carolina native.\n\nBorn into poverty in Barnwell on May 3, 1933, Brown spent part of his childhood in a brothel owned by one of his aunts. “I came up hard,” he once said.\n\nBrown did whatever he could to help out, shining shoes, picking cotton, and dancing to entertain soldiers passing through town.\n\nAs a teenager, he was sent to jail for a petty crime, and it was there that he formed a gospel quartet, and where he met Bobby Byrd, who would become a key member of Brown’s backing band, the Famous Flames.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Brown and his Famous Flames were making a name for themselves, thanks in part to hits such as “Please, Please, Please” and “Try Me.”\n\nAnd music fans in Greenville got the chance to see Brown on his way up the career ladder, when he performed at Greenville’s Textile Hall.\n\nIn December 1961, Brown headlined a “10-act show,” according to a Greenville News story at the time. The acts included his Famous Flames backing group, along with The Brownies, a group of “six dancing girls” from Broadway.\n\nBrown’s music embodied funk; it’s just about impossible to sit still when a song like “Get Up Offa That Thing” comes on, and Brown himself rarely stood still on the concert stage. His hyperkinetic dance moves, punctuated by splits and spins, mesmerized fans and inspired generations of musicians.\n\nBrown’s music was funky, it’s true, but many of his songs had a social conscience, and his 1969 hit, “Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud,” became a civil rights anthem.\n\nHe won three Grammy Awards, starting with “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” in 1965, and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992.\n\nAnd his lifetime truly was filled with musical achievements.\n\nBrown was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, in the very first class of inductees. He received the Kennedy Center Honor in 2003, and in 2010, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him No. 7 on its list of 100 Greatest Artists.\n\nBut Brown also had his demons, weathering arrests for drugs and domestic violence. In 2003, he was pardoned by the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services for crimes committed in South Carolina.\n\nThe singer packed a lot into his 73 years. He launched his final world tour in Greenville, in May 2006, just seven months before his death on Christmas Day.\n\nIn 2014, Brown’s story came to life in the biopic “Get On Up.” Starring as Brown was another acclaimed South Carolina native, Chadwick Boseman, who went on to star in “Black Panther.”\n\nThis is one of a series of stories celebrating Black History Month by telling the stories of South Carolina's black leaders in sports, education, entertainment, business and politics\n\nCelebrating Black History Month\n\n► Greenville's Shammond Williams, once an NBA star, dreamed of working on Wall Street\n\n► Thomas Kerns, Greenville's first black superintendent, accomplished the 'unimaginable'"
