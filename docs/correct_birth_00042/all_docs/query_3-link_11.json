        "text": "May 2, 1964: Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore, two 19-year-old African Americans, were beaten and drowned by Klansmen who believed the two knew something about gun-running in southwest Mississippi. (The truth? There was no gun-running). When their bodies were found in an old part of the Mississippi River, authorities initially believed they had found the bodies of three missing civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. In 2007, James Ford Seale was convicted in the case and given three life sentences.\n\nMay 3, 1898: Septima Poinsette Clark, whom Martin Luther King Jr. called “the mother of the movement,” was born in Charleston, S.C. As an educator, she studied summers with W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University and later worked with Thurgood Marshall on successful litigation that equalized salaries for black and white teachers. In 1956, after the South Carolina Legislature passed a law that banned state employees from belonging to the NAACP, the school board fired Clark, who lost all her pension, despite 40 years of work. She began conducting workshops at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee and helped establish “Citizenship Schools,” which spread through the Deep South. In 1979, President Carter awarded her a Living Legacy Award, and three years later, South Carolina honored her with its highest civilian honor. She died in 1987 on the same Johns Island where she originally taught.\n\nMay 3, 1933: R&B singer and funk pioneer James Brown was born in Augusta, Georgia. He became the “Godfather of Soul” and saw 17 singles go to number one. Rolling Stone ranked him as one of the greatest music artists of all time, and he became an inaugural member of the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame. He died in 2006.\n\nThe movie, Get On Up, tells his story.\n\nMay 3, 1948: In Shelley v. Kraemer, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-0 that local governments cannot enforce racially restrictive covenants, saying they violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nMay 3, 1954: In Hernandez v. Texas, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Mexican Americans and all other racial groups in the United States are entitled to equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nMay 3, 1963: In Birmingham, Alabama, Public Safety Commissioner Theophilus Eugene “Bull” Connor used fire hoses and police dogs on children near the 16th Street Baptist Church to keep them from marching out of the “Negro section” of town. The use of the dogs and hoses became iconic footage in the civil rights movement. Police put the children in vans until there were 959 filling the city jails.\n\nMay 3, 1968: More than 100 African-American students took over a building at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. They wanted African-American history, literature and art included in the curriculum. Their efforts led to the establishment of an African-American studies department, which now offers a doctoral program.\n\nMay 4, 1891: Provident Hospital and Training School, America’s first minority-controlled hospital, opened in Chicago. At this time there were few physicians, and even fewer were allowed hospital privileges. Respected surgeon Dr. Daniel Hale Williams worked with other African-American physicians, ministers and businessmen to establish the institution.\n\nMay 4, 1961: The first group of Freedom Riders, with the intent of integrating interstate buses, left Washington, D.C. by Greyhound bus. The group, organized by the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE), left shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed segregation in interstate transportation terminals.\n\nMay 5, 1917: Eugene Jacques Bullard became the first African-American combat pilot. Bullard, who came to France to escape racism, served in the French Flying Corps. After the United States joined the war, he attempted to join the U.S. military but was barred because of race. He became one of France’s most decorated war heroes, earning the French Legion of Honor.\n\nMay 6, 1960: President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which provided penalties against those who attempted to obstruct someone from voting. The legislation signaled the federal government reversing its long-standing “hands off” policy towards civil rights.\n\nMay 7, 1955: The Rev. George Lee was shot to death in Belzoni, Mississippi, after using his pulpit and his printing press to urge other American Africans to vote. His work had led to the registration of 93 African Americans, angering some whites. Two shotgun blasts hit Lee in the face as he was driving home, and his Buick smashed into a house. Authorities claimed the lead pellets found in his shattered jaw were fillings from his teeth, but FBI tests revealed the pellets were buckshot. No one was ever prosecuted. Lee is usually considered the first martyr of the modern civil rights movement, and he is among 40 martyrs listed on the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nMay 8, 1915: John Hope Franklin was born. He became one of the most respected historians in the country. His book, From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African Americans, sold 3 million copies. In 1995, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor."
