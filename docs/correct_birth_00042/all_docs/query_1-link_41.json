        "text": "(Aiken, South Carolina-AP) Jan. 28, 2004 - Aiken County, South Carolina, authorities said soul singer James Brown was arrested Wednesday and charged with criminal domestic violence.\n\nJail supervisor Nicholas Gallam said the 70-year-old Brown, of Beech Island was booked into the county jail about 1:00pm and was to appear at a bond hearing at 3:00pm.\n\nBrown, known as the Godfather of Soul, served a two-and-one-half-year prison term after a 1988 arrest on drug and assault charges and was convicted of a drug-related offense in 1998. He was granted a pardon by the state Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services in May.\n\nLast month, he was honored at the Kennedy Center as \"one of the most influential musicians of the past 50 years.\"\n\nBrown grew up in Augusta, Georgia, and has had offices and a radio station in the city."
