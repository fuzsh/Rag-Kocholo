I've been a fan of his music since I first heard it in the 1950s, and I was privileged to have seen him perform and take portrait photographs in 1979. My shot of James jumping on Broadway has become a rock photo icon. What could be cooler than to hang with Soul Brother Number One? Make it funky, Brother James!
