        "text": "Hootie & the Blowfish may be South Carolina’s best-selling musical export — after all, the band’s breakthrough 1994 album, “Cracked Rear View,” sold 21 million copies — but the pop-rock band is far from the only important artist with South Carolina roots.\n\nI’ve been writing about music for The Greenville News for more than 20 years, and I’ve always been impressed by the depth and breadth of South Carolina's musical talent, past and present.\n\nJust about every musical genre connects with the Palmetto State in an important or interesting way, starting with the Piedmont blues.\n\nPALMETTO STATE PERFORMANCE: The rest of the US now remembers what SC never forgot: Hootie & the Blowfish matter\n\nHere is my alphabetized list of 15 South Carolina-connected musical artists that everyone should know:\n\nMac Arnold\n\nThese days, Pelzer musician Mac Arnold is a fixture on the Upstate music scene with his band \"Plate Full O’ Blues.\" But in the 1960s, Arnold was a sideman for blues legend Muddy Waters.\n\nBand of Horses\n\nThe indie-rock band, perhaps best known for the hit “The Funeral,” was formed in Seattle, but its roots rest deep in South Carolina soil. Front man Ben Bridwell grew up in Irmo, and the band relocated to Charleston a few years ago.\n\nJames Brown\n\nWhen it comes to musical legends, they don’t get much more legendary than James Brown. Born in Barnwell in 1933, the singer produced a vast musical catalog that includes such hits as “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” and “I Got You (I Feel Good).”\n\nPeabo Bryson\n\nGreenville native and soul crooner Peabo Bryson has had hits with songs like “If Ever You’re in My Arms Again,” but he’s probably best-known for singing the Oscar-winning theme songs to two Disney animated films: “A Whole New World,” from “Aladdin,” performed with Regina Belle, and the “Beauty and the Beast” theme, performed with Celine Dion.\n\nCravin’ Melon\n\nOften compared to Hootie & the Blowfish, Cravin’ Melon got together at Clemson University in the mid-1990s. The band’s ode to the unofficial beverage of the South, “Sweet Tea,” was a regional hit in 1995.\n\nSTAY ENTERTAINED\n\nKeep up with the latest Greenville entertainment news by becoming a subscriber.\n\nRev. Gary Davis\n\nOne of the most influential Piedmont blues artists, Davis grew up blind in Laurens and made his first guitar out of a pie pan. He went on to play the Newport Folk Festival, and his finger-picking guitar style influenced such icons as Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones.\n\nDizzy Gillespie\n\nThe jazz trumpeter, born in Cheraw in 1917, wielded an indelible influence on jazz during his career, and many critics consider him the best jazz trumpeter of all time.\n\nMarcus King\n\nGreenville blues guitarist Marcus King is only 23, but he’s been playing, and attracting attention, since his teens. King,a third-generation musician, is making a name on the national scene these days, opening for the likes of Gary Clark Jr. and putting on his own Family Reunion show with artists such as Jason Isbell and Josh Ritter.\n\nEartha Kitt\n\nThe sultry singer and actress was born in the town of North in 1927, and she went on to star on Broadway, sing the original version of “Santa Baby,” and star as Catwoman in the 1960s TV version of “Batman.”\n\nMarshall Tucker Band\n\nSouthern rock just wouldn’t be the same without the Spartanburg band, fronted by the late Toy Caldwell, responsible for songs like “Can’t You See” and “Heard It in a Love Song.\"\n\nEdwin McCain\n\nGreenville’s McCain had a top 5 single in 1998 with his song “I’ll Be,” and over the past couple of years, McCain has put his talents to work helping other songwriters hone their skills in a series of Peace Center workshops.\n\nShovels & Rope\n\nThe Charleston-based folk duo began making music a decade ago. Shovels and Rope also created the High Water music festival in Charleston, and their 2014 album, “Swimmin’ Time,” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Americana/Folk Albums chart.\n\nCootie Stark\n\nThe blind bluesman from Greenville may not be a familiar name to the average listener. But Stark, who traveled by Greyhound bus, played a raw form of Piedmont blues that spoke to musicians like Taj Mahal, who took Stark on tour with him in the 1990s.\n\nUncle Walt’s Band\n\nOne of the pioneers of the Americana music movement, Uncle Walt’s Band got its start in Spartanburg before moving to Austin. Nearly five decades later, the band’s influence can still be heard in the music of Lyle Lovett and Lucinda Williams.\n\nJosh White\n\nThe bluesman who grew up in poverty in Greenville went on to become a civil rights activist and gave a command performance at the White House for President Franklin Roosevelt. White also was the first African-American musician to sell a million records, with his song “One Meatball.”\n\nLOOKING BACK: Where are they now?
