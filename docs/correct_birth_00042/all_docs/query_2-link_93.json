        "text": "Perry Sprawls was born and grew up on the Sprawls Heritage Farm in Barnwell County, South Carolina. The farm has been in the Sprawls Family since 1812 and the house where he was born escaped burning during the Civil War because there was someone ill in the house. Yankee soldiers have been quoted as saying, \"we don't burn houses with sick people in them.\" They just burned the farm buildings and stole Grandfather's pony. These stories, family photos and artifacts passed down through generations stimulated an interest and a desire to preserve the history and heritage of families and society as it was many years ago and that is being achieved through a variety of initiatives.\n\nBarnwell County Virtual Museum: www.bcvm.org\n\nThe creation and donation to the community of the Barnwell County Virtual Museum by the Sprawls Family provided a foundation for several other projects. In addition to providing links to many sources of historical significance it enabled the development of virtual components or websites for the physical museums within Barnwell County.\n\nThe museum for Perry's hometown, Williston, on the web at: https://www.bcvm.org/williston/museum houses two exhibits he developed, the early telephone and telegraph systems from the time of his childhood. These were developed from his memory and a collection of old equipment of the period. Of special interest is an operating replica of an old telegraph system where young people can experiment with sending messages with Morse code and compare it to text-messaging as done today.\n\nThe development of the website for the for the Agricultural Heritage Museum: https://www.bcvm.org/agricultureheritage/ provided Perry with the opportunity to use some of his early experiences growing up on the farm to develop meaningful exhibits to preserve this part of our rural South Carolina heritage.\n\nVirtual Dunbarton: https://www.bcvm.org/Dunbarton/ . Dunbarton, SC was a small rural town not very far from the Sprawls Farm. In the early 1950s it was included in a large area taken over by the Federal Government for the construction of the Savannah River Project, a facility for the production of nuclear bombs. It was to become known locally as the \"bum plant\". All residents were moved away along with their homes and other property. The town of Dunbarton and the surrounding community was completely eliminated. Perry created the Virtual Dunbarton website and works with the displaced residents to add information about families, photographs of the relocated homes, and much more.\n\nNewspaper and Journal Publications: Through a continuing series of historical articles published both in the Barnwell County newspaper and the journal of the Aiken Barnwell County Genealogical his effort is to enhance the interest and appreciation for local history, especially among the younger residents and students.\n\nAs a physicist specializing in the science and technology of radiology and medical imaging for over a half century Perry experienced and was often involved in many of the innovations and developments that are now history...specifically including mammography, computed tomography (CT), and earlier methods of x-ray imaging or radiography. This provided the background and knowledge to author these historical articles that are published in an internal journal and are available online.\n\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN MAMMOGRAPHY: A CONTINUING QUEST FOR VISIBILITY\n\nFILM-SCREEN RADIOGRAPHY RECEPTOR DEVELOPMENT, A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\n\nTHE MANY STEPS AND EVOLUTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY TECHNOLOGY AND IMAGING METHODS, THE QUEST FOR ENHANCED VISIBILITY THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS\n\nA special interest for many years has been the discovery of x-radiation in Germany and research work of the discoverer Professor Roentgen. Perry's investigation has included several trips to Germany and visits to Roentgen's laboratory and several other related sites. Perry's visual illustrations of Roentgen's experiments are recognized as a significant contribution to the understanding of this major historical event and have been used by him in presentations both in the US and internationally, including Germany.\n\nA related publication: ROENTGENâS INVESTIGATION DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF X-RADIATION\n\nIn years past, and especially in rural communities, families often had cemeteries on the family farms or other available places. Over time many of these smaller cemeteries have become neglected and lost, overgrown with vegetation, and are becoming destroyed. Recognizing that these often are vital links to the past that need to be preserved led to two specific activities. The first, with the help of some local residents, was to search for and attempt to locate every old cemetery in Barnwell County, SC. Using modern satellite technology their GPS locations were measured and posted on the Barnwell County Virtual Museum website. It is now possible for interested persons to use that to obtain aerial photos and maps showing the location of the old, and maybe lost, cemeteries. A continuing activity is to encourage and assist families and communities to use the Find A Grave program to create websites for cemeteries and columbariums that will provide permanent and accessible information on internments along with the possibility of adding many family details. An example used here is the old Sprawls Family Cemetery that is physically located in a wooded and difficult to reach place on the old plantation. However, with the website (https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/2386326/sprawls-cemetery) it can now be âvisitedâ by family members from anywhere in the world.\n\nA special project is locating, photographing, and providing permanent online memorials for abandoned and neglected African-American Cemeteries that were relocated from the Savannah River Site including these two\n\n: https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/2590778/canaan-fair-methodist .\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/2598512/white-pond-cemetery\n\nAt the Black Mountain Presbyterian Church he works with the families of deceased members interred in the Columbarium to provide permanent online memorials: https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/2585495/black-mountain-presbyterian-columbarium ."
