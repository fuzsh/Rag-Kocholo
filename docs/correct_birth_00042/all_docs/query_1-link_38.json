A friend taught him how to play the piano, and he took to it right away. Mr. Brown's family didn't own a set of keys, so in order to get his fingers on the ivories he started sweeping the wood floors at Trinity CME. In return, the church would let him practice his music on it's sanctuary piano Visit the church at 2930 Glenn Hills Drive.\n\nNote: Although the current congregation now meets in a new building, the original church structure where Mr. Brown visited still stands at 873 8th Street.\n\nJames Brown Family Historical Tour\n\nTake a comprehensive tour of James Brown sites around Augusta, led by a James Brown Family member.
