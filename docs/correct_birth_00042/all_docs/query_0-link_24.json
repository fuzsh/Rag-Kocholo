        "text": "James Brown (3 May 1933 – 25 December 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer, and bandleader who was nicknamed \"the Godfather of Soul\" for profoundly influencing music across his 50-year career. Brown was a notable Republican Party supporter, saying that he considered Senator Strom Thurmond to be a \"grandfather\" to him.\n\nBiography[]\n\nJames Brown was born in Barnwell, South Carolina on 3 May 1933, and he began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He joined the R&B group, \"The Gospel Starlighters\", and he first came to national attention in the late 1950s as the lead singer of \"The Famous Flames\". Brown became known as a tireless live performer, and his success peaked in the 1960s with singles such as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\", \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\", and \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\", and he also made funk music during the early 1970s such as \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" and \"The Payback\". Brown recorded 16 R&B number-one singles, and he was the most sampled artist of all time."
