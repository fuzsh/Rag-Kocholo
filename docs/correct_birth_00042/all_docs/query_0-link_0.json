        "text": "MAY 3, 1933\n\nJames Brown was born on this date in the poorest of beginnings in Barnwell County, but he became one of the richest men in show business. He was also one of the most honored in his adopted hometown of Augusta, which named both a street and civic center in his honor and dedicated a Broad Street statue to his achievements.\n\nHis unique dance steps, first exhibited in Augusta schools, theaters and street corners, came to be copied by others. So was his pulsating music, which earned Brown a place in both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. He sold millions of records worldwide.\n\nHis personal life was a roller coaster of ups and downs with troubles and triumphs. However, Brown's death on Christmas Day 2006 closed out a generous life that continues to be celebrated each holiday season with turkey giveaways and children's toy donations."
