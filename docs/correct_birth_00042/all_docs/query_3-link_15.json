        "text": "(1933–2006). A skilled dancer and singer with an extraordinary sense of timing, U.S. entertainer James Brown played a major role in bringing rhythm to the foreground of popular music. Brown’s ability to “scream” on key, to sing soulful ballads as well as electrifying up-tempo tunes, and to blend blues, gospel, jazz, and country vocal styles made him a highly influential vocalist. His legendary live shows, featuring dramatic entrances and exits, acrobatic leaps, and dazzling footwork, earned him recognition as the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business.\n\nBrown was born on May 3, 1933, in Barnwell, S.C. He was raised mainly in Augusta, Ga., by his great-aunt, who took him in at about the age of 5 when his parents divorced. Growing up in the segregated South during the Great Depression of the 1930s, Brown had an impoverished childhood. Neighbors taught him how to play drums, piano, and guitar, and he learned about gospel music in churches and at tent revivals, where preachers would scream, yell, stomp their feet, and fall to their knees during sermons to provoke responses from the congregation. Brown sang for his classmates and competed in local talent shows but initially thought more about a career in baseball or boxing than in music.\n\nAt age 15 Brown and some companions were arrested while breaking into cars. He was sentenced to 8 to 16 years of incarceration but was released after 3 years for good behavior. While in reform school, he formed a gospel quartet. His group, secularized and renamed the Flames (later the Famous Flames), soon attracted the attention of rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll shouter Little Richard, whose manager helped promote the group. Intrigued by their demonstration record, a representative of the King record label brought the group to Cincinnati, Ohio, to record for King’s subsidiary Federal. Brown’s first recording, “Please, Please, Please” (1956), sold 3 million copies and launched his career. Subsequent hit singles included “I Got You” (1965), “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” (1965), and “It’s a Man’s World” (1966). Along with placing nearly 100 singles and almost 50 albums on the charts, Brown broke new ground with two of the first successful “live and in concert” albums—his landmark Live at the Apollo (1963), which stayed on the charts for 66 weeks, and his 1964 follow-up, Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal, which charted for 22 weeks.\n\nDuring the 1960s Brown was known as Soul Brother Number One. His recordings of that decade have often been associated with the emergence of the black power movement, especially the songs “Say It Loud—I’m Black and I’m Proud” (1968), “Don’t Be a Drop-Out” (1966), and “I Don’t Want Nobody to Give Me Nothin’ (Open Up the Door, I’ll Get It Myself)” (1969). In the 1970s Brown became the Godfather of Soul, and his songs stimulated several dance crazes. When hip-hop music emerged in the 1980s, Brown’s songs again assumed center stage as hip-hop disc jockeys frequently incorporated samples (audio snippets) from his records. He also appeared in several motion pictures, including The Blues Brothers (1980) and Rocky IV (1985), and attained global status as a celebrity. Yet Brown’s life continued to be marked by difficulties, including the tragic death of his third wife, charges of drug use, and a period of imprisonment for a high-speed highway chase in which he tried to escape pursuing police officers.\n\nBrown’s extraordinary showmanship redefined live performance within popular music and inspired generations of imitators. He proved highly influential also in his innovative use of rhythm. In addition to providing melody and embellishment, the horn players in his bands functioned as a rhythm section (they had to think like drummers), and musicians associated with him (Jimmy Nolan, Bootsy Collins, Fred Wesley, and Maceo Parker) played an important role in defining funk music. Brown was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. He died on Dec. 25, 2006, in Atlanta, Ga."
