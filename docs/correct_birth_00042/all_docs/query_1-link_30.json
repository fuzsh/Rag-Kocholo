        "text": "By Vince Jackson\n\nA new movie about the life of James Brown might skip over some of the truth about the Hardest Working Man in Show Business and his early life jumping from balconies in an Upstate music club.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Brown performed almost weekly at Littlejohn’s Grill, a long-since closed nightclub along S.C. 93 in Clemson.\n\nGET ON UP WITH JAMES BROWN\n\nShare your James Brown and Chadwick Boseman memories on Facebook (Independent Mail-Our Town Memories and Your Hometown)\n\nCheck out an old advertisement for a James Brown show at yourhometownmemories.com\n\nRead more about James Brown in the Upstate on yourhometownfun.com\n\nWatch trailers for “Get On Up” on Your Hometown Fun’s Facebook page\n\nHorace Littlejohn and his wife, Gertrude, ran the Grill, home to many traveling blues, jazz and rock ’n’ roll stars, including Brown.\n\nAs part of the “Chitlin Circuit” — an informal entertainment route for black performers that ran from New Orleans to New York — Littlejohn’s Grill became an important stop with inexpensive meals, lodging and a place to perform for the traveling musicians. Pork chitlins were almost always on the menu.\n\nA convenient stop-over perched halfway between Charlotte and Atlanta, the Grill drew all of the big-name performers of the 1950s.\n\nPatrons of the Grill remember frequent performers Little Richard, Fats Domino, Otis Redding, Ray Charles and Ruth Brown, who entertained hundreds who came out to hear the music. Redd Foxx, better known as the star of the Sanford and Son TV show, cut his performing teeth at the Grill telling jokes between band breaks.\n\nThe Grill helped usher into the Upstate the birth of rock ’n’ roll, while the music caught fire in the segregated Upstate as many, black and white, enjoyed hit songs churned out by street-corner groups of the era.\n\nBut the most remembered star of the Grill — and all of the other clubs from Toccoa, Georgia, to Anderson — was James Brown.\n\nBrown, known for his show-stopping routines, would jump from the second story balcony of the Grill, do the splits, stand upright, grab a microphone and continue singing without missing a note. Many who remember the shows said they saw Brown perform this feat on more than one occasion.\n\n“I don’t know how he kept from hurting himself,” said Oscar Preston, who worked at the Grill.\n\nOthers said Little Richard attempted to perform the jump, but after one attempt he never tried it again.\n\nBrown worked with Little Richard and Hank Ballard and the Midnighters to craft music for the dance floor. Ballard wrote a song, The Twist, which did not become a hit until it was recorded by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark. The twist originated from an older African-American dance from the late 1800s. Ballard and Brown were always looking for new dance routines to use in their performances.\n\nThose familiar with the dance the Mashed Potatoes, the root of all of Brown’s dance moves, say Ballard and Brown invented the dance but never got the credit. Dee Dee Sharp, appearing on Dick Clark’s American Bandstand in Philadelphia, recorded a song called Mashed Potatoes, which appeared on the record charts for many weeks. The Mashed Potatoes became known as Philadelphia’s dance but patrons of the Grill in Clemson still remember doing the Mashed Potatoes years before the song hit it big.\n\nClemson’s Ronnie Gantt was a young boy when Brown used to perform at the Grill, owned by his Aunt Gert and Uncle Horace.\n\n“I practically lived at the Grill,” he said. “James Brown performed there all the time, but I never actually saw him perform.”\n\nGantt said as a youth he was more interested in hanging out with his friends outside the Grill.\n\n“That was something that was more fun for me at that time. It is hard for me to understand how I missed so much music history,” he said.\n\nPreston, the Grill employee who saw Brown jump from the balcony several times, later worked in the airline industry and sometimes saw Brown traveling after the singer became a big star.\n\n“He was always a humble man to me,” Preston said. “He always spoke to me when he saw me and introduced me as someone who knew him when he didn’t have two quarters to rub together.”\n\nPreston said he will always remember how Brown was introduced to the crowd when he performed at Littlejohn’s Grill:\n\n“The horn section would play an opening riff and the announcer would say, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, direct to you from Toccoa, Georgia, Littlejohn’s Grill is proud to present — James Brown and the Flames.’”\n\nThen, Preston said, the soon to be Godfather of Soul would step smiling into the spotlight."
