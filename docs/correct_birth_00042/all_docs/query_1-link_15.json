        "text": "12,399 views\n\nEVERYBODY from South Carolina: A Thread.\n\nLetâs start with The Godfather of Soul, James Brown.\n\nOn May 3, 1933, James Brown was born poor in a shack near Barnwell, South Carolina and went on to become one of the most influential entertainers of all time\n\nLetâs rewind. I started this thread because as a kid, I remember watching TV and listening to the radio and rarely seeing or hearing the state represented. Many young people have fled to major cities in search of resources or experiences that donât exist here.\n\nIâve always been a problem solver, so the idea of staying here and creating those resources and experiences has always been more fascinating to me than leaving. In staying, I began to discover a lot of facts about the state and started sharing them on social media.\n\nIn the process of discovering facts about the state, I began to notice a pattern of black, notable people having family connections to the state. This now makes sense, knowing that it has been said that over 50% of Africans entered the US through the ports of South Carolina\n\nIn fact, itâs been said that approx. 70% of enslaved Africans who came to the US came ashore here on the coast of South Carolina. Descendants of these people are known as Gullah-Geechees. No other group of African Americans have preserved more Africanisms\n\nRemember the show Gullah Gullah Island? It premiered on Nickelodeon in 1994, was based on South Carolina and openly embraced Gullah-Geechee culture. The show aired from 1994-1998 and starred real-life married couple, Ronald and Natalie Daise\n\nI remember watching Gullah Gullah Island in class as a kid and wondering how my dentist was featured on an episode of a Nickelodeon Show. I thought, wow what a huge coincidence! Now, I understand my birthplace of Beaufort, SC was what the whole show was based around\n\nThis wasnât the first time Beaufort, South Carolina made the âbig screenâ. Over 20 years prior, on March 8, 1971, Joe Frazier became the first man EVER to beat Muhammad Ali in a fight.\n\nBeaufort, SC is also the birthplace of Season 12 winner of American Idol. Candice Glover was raised in the Gullah community of St. Helena Island. St. Helena was the inspiration behind Gullah Gullah Island and is the hometown of the showâs star, Ron Daise\n\nI should make note that the title of this thread, âEVERYBODY from South Carolinaâ means âEVERYBODY is from South Carolinaâ in Ebonics.\n\nSo no, this isnât a thread listing EVERYBODY from SC, but one pointing out the fact that A LOT of influencers in black culture have SC roots\n\nOkay, letâs heat things up a little more. Remember First Lady, Michelle Obama?\n\nHer Great-great-great grandmother, Melvinia Shields was born enslaved in South Carolina in 1844\n\nMichelle Obama has publicly made reference to her family ties to Georgetown, South Carolina, but donât take my word for it:\n\nDave Chappelleâs Great Grandfather was once the president of Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina. The auditorium there is even named after him.\n\nWatch this:\n\nDave Chappelleâs Great Grandfather was also in the South Carolina state legislature during reconstruction.\n\nLook:\n\nBelieve it or not, Dave Chappelle isnât the only A-List comedian who has family links to South Carolina.\n\nChris Rock was born in Andrews, SC on Feb 7, 1965\n\nHis mother started out as a teacher to help her parents and to get out of Jim Crow SC\n\nWatch:\n\nDiddy couldnât possibly have a connection to the state of South Carolina, right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nWatch as he traces his family roots back to the Palmetto state\n\n...and if you still donât believe it, hereâs part 2 of Diddy tracing his family roots back to South Carolina\n\nALL the black super heroes are from South Carolina\n\nEartha Kitt (Catwoman) was born in North, SC.\n\nMike Colter (Luke Cage) was born in Columbia, SC and raised in St. Matthews, SC.\n\nAnd Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) was born and raised in Anderson, SC.\n\nHell, even the new red Power Ranger is from South Carolina\n\nThe first man to wear number 23 for the Chicago Bulls was Michael Jordan, right?\n\nWRONG\n\nIt was a 1971 graduate of Vorhees College in Denmark, South Carolina by the name of Jackie Dinkins\n\nWiz Khalifa was born into a military family and lived in South Carolina for a while\n\nWiz Khalifa isnât the only rapper who has a connection to South Carolina.\n\nIn fact, the FIRST female group to release a rap record was 3 women from Columbia, SC known as 'The Sequence'.\n\nLegendary soul singer Angie Stone was in this group\n\nIn fact, the TV show âPowerâ on Starz wouldnât be the same if it wasnât for the Palmetto State. Executive Producer, Curtis 50 Cent Jackson was raised by his grandma in Queens, NY who is a native of Edgefield, South Carolina\n\n3 clips of 50 visiting SC:\n\n50 Cent visiting his familyâs hometown of Edgefield, South Carolina, Part 2\n\n50 Cent visiting his familyâs hometown of Edgefield, South Carolina, Part 3\n\nCarl Anthony Payne II, perhaps better known as âCole from Martinâ was born in the small town of Clinton, South Carolina\n\nSlightly off-topic, but University of South Carolina Womenâs Basketball Head coach, Dawn Staley isnât originally from SC, but she was on an episode of Martin\n\n...but since weâre here, know that the No. 1 pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft was no other than the University of South Carolinaâs own, A'ja Wilson!\n\nAâja was born in Hopkins, SC and a lifelong resident of Richland County before being drafted to the Las Vegas Aces\n\n...and the following year, both the No. 1 and No. 2 NBA Draft Picks were from South Carolina.\n\nZion Williamson and Ja Morant grew up an hour from each other in SC and even played on the same AAU team at one point\n\nI mentioned Eartha Kitt earlier in this thread. Her story is interesting. She was the product of a plantation owner who took advantage of Earthaâs mother.\n\nHere she is explaining her family connection to South Carolina.\n\nHereâs another clip of Eartha referencing her connection to South Carolina. She understood the importance of land and said it was more important to her than a man or jewelry:\n\nBoth James Brown and Eartha Kitt passed away on Christmas Day. James in 2006 and Eartha in 2008\n\nRapper, Trick Daddy has been proudly flaunting his South Carolina, Geechee roots for decades at this point.\n\nWatch as he explains his mother being from SC and how to prepare a geechee meal:\n\nSince weâre on the topic of the Breakfast Club, radio personality, Charlamagne Tha God is from Moncks Corner, South Carolina in case you didnât already know.\n\nHereâs Charlamagne 10 years ago predicting the future of SC music and culture\n\nFashion icon, Dapper Dan opened his boutique in Harlem, New York in 1982 and sold custom clothing that used logos from high-end luxury brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Fendi. Though he is famously associated w NYC, his roots are South Carolina. Watch:\n\nThe new star in Disneyâs The Little Mermaid? Yup, South Carolina, too.\n\nHalle Bailey is a singer and part of the musical sister duo @chloexhalle.\n\nWatch as they mention their father being from Charleston, South Carolina in a recent interview\n\nActress, Angell Conwell was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina and moved to Columbia, SC when she was 2.

She was also the first black designer for Barbie when she was hired at age 28. She rose in the company after a decade, hiring more black designers\n\nLetâs rewind again real quick...\n\nremember I mentioned Chris Rock earlier, right? Well, his baby brother, Jordan Rock, grew up in South Carolina, is a comedian too and even reps 843 in his social media handle\n\nFormer recording artist and now broadcaster, Joe Budden is often associated with New Jersey or New York, but his roots are Sumter, South Carolina. Sumter High School was built on his family land\n\nMany scenes in the movie, Forrest Gump, were filmed in SC. Some casting was done here too\n\nBubba's Mama is played by Dr. Marlena Smalls of Beaufort, SC, founder of the Hallelujah Singers, a vocal ensemble that carries on the music and culture of the Gullah tradition.\n\nShe had no interest in acting before being approached for the role\n\nThe Hallelujah Singers of Beaufort, SC were also in the movie. Remember this scene?\n\n2 of rapâs most well-known producers in are both from Columbia, South Carolina\n\nJetsonmade was born and raised here and Piâerre Bourne, by way of Queens, NY\n\nWhenever you hear âYo, Pierre you wanna come out here?â or âOh lawd, Jetson made another 1â, you already know itâs a hit\n\nMost people donât know Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School had their own reality show on BBC.

These terms vary, but the short answer is that samurai were low ranking members of the warrior caste, and warriors in general were called bushi. All samurai are bushi, but only some bushi are samurai.\n\nAshigaru è¶³è»½ is spelled \"foot-light.\" Different clans and regions used terms differently, of course, but generally speaking, ashigaru are a gray area. They were part of feudal armies and part of lordly retinues in the Edo period (1600-1868), but were they bushi?\n\nHmmm...\n\nRead 12 tweets\n\n#Thread 1.
