Author James McBride writes that the facts of Brown's life have become \"twisted like a pretzel beyond recognition.\" McBride tries to set the record straight with \"Kill 'Em And Leave: Searching For James Brown And The American Soul.\"\n\n\"I think our inability to really understand James Brown is rooted in our inability to talk about the difficult things that we manage to avoid talking about like race and class and the division between North and South.\" - James McBride, author of \"Kill 'Em And Leave: Searching For James Brown And The American Soul\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CisfU6vkLvo"
