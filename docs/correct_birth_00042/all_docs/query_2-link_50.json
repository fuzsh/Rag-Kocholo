Sáenz graduated in 1994 from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering. After working for an engineering consulting firm for 6 years, he decided to embark on a new career path.

As a dental physician resident working in a hospital setting, he gained invaluable knowledge and technical skills from an experienced faculty.\n\nHe was an associate dentist at various dental practices before taking over as the owner of Barnwell Family Dentistry in July 2012. Dr. Sáenz recognizes the tradition of exceptional dental care that was provided by his predecessors since 1954, and he intends to continue the tradition of providing local families with the best possible dentistry with the help of his excellent team.\n\nDr. Sáenz is a member of the South Carolina Dental Association, American Dental Association, the American Association of Endodontists, the Academy of General Dentistry, and the American Dental Society of Anesthesiology. One of his main goals is educating patients about their oral health and how it impacts their overall health, as well as helping them overcome a fear of the dentist and giving them a smile that is functional and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nHe married his wife, Catherine, in 2006, and together they have a daughter, Gisele and a son, Zachary. In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his family, hunting, working in his yard and studying the Bible.\n\nAmber Gillam\n\nOffice Scheduling/Financial Coordinator\n\nAmber was born in Pima County, Arizona, but raised in Asheville, North Carolina; she has been in Barnwell for the past 17 years.
