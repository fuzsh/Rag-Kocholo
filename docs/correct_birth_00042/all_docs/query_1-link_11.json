        "text": "First Family Home Of James Brown Is Opening Its Doors To The Public For Tours\n\nOne more stop has been added to the James Brown Family Historical Tours and you could be the first to experience it.\n\nStarting May 4th, the public is invited to take a journey inside the former first family home of James Brown.\n\nThe James Brown Family Historical Tours initially ran once a week on Saturdays from 11 a.m. until 12:45 p.m. Starting May 4th the tour will have a new starting time of 10:30 am. The tour cost $45 Per Person.\n\nJames Brown Historical Tour\n\nThe tour begins at the Augusta Museum of History. From there, you are transported on a 25-passenger seated bus provided by T and T Transporation. Along the ride, a tour guide will narrate as the bus visits sites that are significant to the history of James Brown growing up and living in Augusta.\n\nSome stops include such sites as the elementary school, Silas X. Floyd School, that James Brown attended, which he attended until the 7th grade.\n\nThe tour takes you to the home where he lived as a child, businesses he owned, The James Brown Statue, The James Brown Arena, and now the first home of the Brown family.\n\nThe James Brown Arena was the last accolade that he received in the United States in October 2006. He unveiled the sign himself. He also unveiled his statue alongside family and friends in the Broad Street median at Augusta Common, downtown Augusta, Georgia in 2005.\n\nTourists also get the opportunity to see the largest exhibit of his memorabilia at The Augusta Museum of History following the tour. This is a one-of-a-kind exhibit that features rare memorable and personal artifacts that vividly tell the story of Brown’s rise to worldwide fame. From his performance attire to the hair gel he used in his hair.\n\nAfter the tour, you will have the opportunity to buy a James Brown Family Historical Tour Souvenir!\n\nReservations are required to take a tour and must be made at least 24 hours in advance.\n\nWith the public now being able to visit the first family home of James Brown, it’s like a new piece of history for Augusta has been unlocked.\n\nDarasha Singleton is a native of Augusta, Georgia who serves as the Digital Content Coordinator at Beasley Media Group.
