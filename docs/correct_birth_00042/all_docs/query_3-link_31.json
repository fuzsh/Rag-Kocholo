        "text": "Biography\n\nJames Chukwueze Obialor (born February 22, 1999), also addressed as WF James Brown, is a fascinating Nigerian social media personality. His unique blend of talents has garnered attention, showcasing his diverse roles as a controversial content creator, dancer, and cross-dresser.\n\nA true artist, James Brownâs skills span various spheres. His acting and comedic talents shine, but he also wields the power of content creation to influence brands within his industry.\n\nJames Brownâs moment in the spotlight arrived in 2018 with a viral video that catapulted him to fame. This video gave birth to the now-iconic Nigerian catchphrase, âThey didnât caught me,â in response to his encounter with the Nigerian police.\n\nHis subsequent arrest, along with others, on charges of homosexuality led to a month behind bars in the Ikoyi Correctional Facility. However, the story took a turn when a judge eventually dismissed the case against them, allowing James Brown to step back into the world unburdened.\n\nJames Brown James Brown: History â§ Bio â§ PhotoWiki Facts & About DataFull Name:James Chukwueze ObialorStage Name:James BrownBorn:22 February 1999 (age 25 years old)Place of Birth:Mushin, Lagos, NigeriaState Of Origin:Imo StateNationality:NigerianEducation:British UniversityHeight:1.57 mParents:Mr. and Mrs. ObialorSiblings:Gracious BrownSpouse:Not MarriedGirlfriend â¢ Boyfriend â¢ Partner:N/AChildren:N/AOccupation:Dancer â¢ Internet PersonalityNet Worth:$200,000\n\nEarly Life & Education\n\nJames Brown, the amusingly controversial personality, was born on February 22, 1999, in the vibrant heart of Mushin, Lagos, Nigeria. Despite his Igbo heritage, he seamlessly converses in Yoruba, a linguistic flourish owed to his upbringing amidst Lagosâ cultural crosscurrents.\n\nGracious Brown, whose real name is Gracious Obialor, is the well-known sister of James Brown, a prominent Nigerian cross-dresser, and traces his ancestry back to Imo State, Nigeria, firmly anchoring him within the Igbo community.\n\nRegarding his academic pursuits, a touch of mystery adds seasoning. While official records remain elusive, itâs whispered that James Brownâs scholarly voyage encompassed both primary and secondary education within Lagosâ embrace.\n\nWhispers in the wind suggest that his aspirations carried him beyond borders as James Brown embarked on a self-sponsored academic voyage in a British university.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2018, James Brown stepped into the spotlight with a video that swiftly went viral. His voice echoed with the unforgettable words, âThey didnât caught me,â a defiant response to a run-in with the law. This incident arose from accusations of homosexuality, leading to a month-long sojourn within the confines of the Ikoyi Correctional Facility.\n\nHowever, the scales of justice tipped in his favour, as the charges against James Brown and his companions, numbering 46, were ultimately dropped.\n\nAmidst the chapters of his life, James Brownâs narrative took an unexpected twist when he boldly proclaimed to have grappled with HIV since birth. Yet, timeâs passage revealed the proclamation as a mere facade, a desperate fabrication to escape the grasp of detention.\n\nHis persona, oscillating between cross-dressing charisma and melodic prowess, was unveiled as Hey Durlings, a musical composition that resonated within the industry. Beyond music, James Brownâs presence resonated in an HBO documentary, etching his imprint onto the tapestry of entertainment.\n\nWithin the constellation of his connections, one figure shone exceptionally bright. Bobrisky, seen as a beloved godmother by James Brown, shared a close bond. However, a storm brewed in 2021 when social media platforms crackled with Jamesâ distress, exposing alleged threats on his life by Bobrisky. This discord also brought to light accusations of content appropriation, casting shadows over their once-amicable relationship.\n\nJames Brownâs career trajectory wove through diverse professions. From Nollywoodâs silver screen to the digital stage, he left his mark in myriad online skits. Adding to his eclectic journey, he unveiled the musical gem Hey Dulings in 2021.\n\nBeyond this, James Brown proudly sported the mantle of brand ambassador for companies like Gidi Fashion. Across the digital expanse, his Instagram followers numbered over 1.7 million, TikTok enthusiasts swayed to his tune with 1.4 million, and his Twitter following reached 12.4k.
