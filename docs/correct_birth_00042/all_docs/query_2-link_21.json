        "text": "Also known as the Godfather of Soul, James Brown was an iconic singer, songwriter and dancer who found his calling in funk and R&B music.\n\nBrown was born into poverty in Barnwell County in 1933 and raised in Augusta. He kept a home in Beech Island.\n\nBrown's stardom began in the late 1950s, when he recorded “Please, Please, Please” and “Try Me” as a member of an R&B vocal group called the Famous Flames. “Try Me” reached No. 1 on the R&B charts and made it into the Hot 100 Singles Chart.\n\nThe early 1960s saw Brown break into the charts with “Lost Someone,” “Night Train” and “Prisoner of Love,” which reached No. 2 on the pop charts.\n\nHe also produced hit singles “Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,” “I Got You” and “It's a Man's Man's Man's World” in that decade.\n\nAnd his live concert album from the Apollo Theater in Harlem, “Live at the Apollo,” peaked at No. 2 on the pop albums chart.\n\nBrown continued to enjoy success into the 1970s, producing hit singles “Sex Machine” and “Get Up Offa That Thing.”\n\nMuch of his reputation stems from his prowess as a live performer. Brown hardly took nights off from performing, earning the title of “Hardest Working Man in Show Business.”\n\nThe influential performer was also known for his social activism.\n\nGrowing up poor and spending time in a juvenile detention center for robbery as a teen helped him develop sympathy for the less-fortunate.\n\nBrown advocated for the importance of education and appropriated most of his estate in his will toward a foundation to provide scholarships for needy children in Aiken County and Augusta.\n\nConsidered the inventor of funk and the grandfather of hip-hop, Brown was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, its first year of existence.\n\nThings started to go downhill for Brown in the late 1980s. In September of 1988, Brown refused to pull over to police who were tipped he had been carrying a gun and acting dangerously. Brown led police on a high-speed chase from Augusta to North Augusta, with the chase ending only after police shot out his tires."
