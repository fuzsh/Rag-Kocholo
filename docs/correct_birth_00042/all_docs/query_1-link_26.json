        "text": "NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. — One day after thousands bade farewell to singer James Brown at the Apollo Theater in New York, friends and relatives gathered Friday for a more humble memorial service near the place Brown called home.\n\nThe gold casket bearing Brown's body was brought into the Carpentersville Baptist Church about 2:30 p.m. Boxing promoter Don King, wearing a red, white and blue tie, was right behind. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who had accompanied Brown's body to New York and back, was also on hand, as was comedian Dick Gregory.\n\nAs the hour of the ceremony neared, several hundred friends, relatives and onlookers waited outside the small, red brick church in a neighborhood of dilapidated homes — some with boarded up windows — on a street just inside the South Carolina line.\n\nFriday's ceremony marked the second day of farewell services for Brown.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of people danced and sang in the streets outside New York's Apollo Theater in celebration of the music legend's life as his body was displayed on the stage where he made his 1956 debut.\n\nBrown, who died of heart failure Christmas morning at 73, lay in repose in the Harlem theater that helped catapult him to fame and was the setting for a live album in 1962.\n\nEarlier, Brown's body was carried to the theater through the streets on a majestic white carriage drawn by two white horses.\n\nHundreds of fans followed behind the caisson singing the chorus of Brown's anthem, \"Say it Loud — I'm Black and I'm Proud.\"\n\nAnother public viewing of the singer's body, followed by a public funeral service, will be held today at the James Brown Arena in Augusta."
