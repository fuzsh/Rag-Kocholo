        "text": "In this story, there are times when James pays more attention to his family, and times where he pays more attention to his little brother, Isaac. In the beginning, James thinks a little bit about taking Isaac out to see the K-bones. James is kind of nervous, but not to the point where he would leave Isaac at home. So, James decides to bring Isaac along, when he and Isaac are really supposed to be at home. At this time, James doesn’t really worry to think about the danger that he could only put himself in, but he could also put Isaac in a peril, too. So, James cares more about his friends than Isaac. Another example that proves this is when James starts to go out. For example, he says “ Kris says they’re just a bunch of kids who hang out and do cool stuff. Like a club. Tonight, I have to prove myself so I can be in their club, too.” This shows me that James is more focused on his friends because instead of watching Isaac like he’s supposed to, he wants to\n\nJames grew up in a racist and segregated part of history. Often times racial slurs were used to describe people of African descent during the time James was growing up. Even during school James would be called these horrendous names: “...someone in the back of the class whispered, “James is ni**er!” followed by a ripple of tittering and giggling across the room” (McBride 89). The fact that small school children call blacks these names shows how racist the many people are and the hatred and discrimination that blacks face. These experience taught James how people treat those that appear to be different. Another experience that taught James this was when he and his family went to the Jewish store and were discriminated against. McBride had many experiences in which he and his family were discriminated against whether it was by the police or store owners: “Some of these Jews can’t stand you” (86). All in all, incidents with people who have a particular dislike for blacks shaped James into the way\n\nEverything started going downhill from there and that's where the conflict of interest begins. James left the house in the mornings but didn't go to school and says himself that he was practically a dropout. \"I spent as much time away from home as possible. I quit church and avoided my deeply religious godparents. I was the first kid on my block to smoke cigarettes and reefer\" (McBride, 138) shows the ways he was acting out, also including stealing from freight cars with his friends. He was even caught by the police once. With James out of the house all the time, his mother suffered more because no one was there to help her with her young children. He was hurting but was too stubborn to admit it and \"reefer and wine helped me to forget any pain, and as the pain and guilt increased, my problems with drugs worsened\" (McBride, 142). All the while his mother knew nothing about it. Until one day when he gave her a forged report card with a grade unlike his usual ones and she called the school only to find out something way worse than what she expected. From then on, James spent the summers with his sister Jack in Kentucky who his mother thought could straighten him out. Jack's husband lets James run free with him and he finds himself often at a place called the\n\nMoreover into his life he really began to gain momentum towards his life when he started school. He began Pre-k in a private catholic school St. Anthony. He would gain life experiences by the little things that happened to him. Expecting another classmate to be his friend and ultimately being told that they're not friends made James cry. However, he has learned not to cry when a person does not feel the same way but rather find someone that does. One of his closest friends during Pre-K was Phillip but their friendship would end like most would during such a young age, by going to different schools. James then went to finish most of his elementary classes in St. Joseph’s Catholic School, another private school. There he would go and become more sociable with his peers and had a level of comfortable around them. So much so that he would make a YouTube channel simply titled “James Craw”. Here he would record himself and friends performing skits and the interesting parts of his life he wanted to\n\nOne of the themes was the burden of secrets that were kept. As a young boy, James knew very little about his mother’s childhood background. James’s mother Ruth discouraged his curiosity about her past and her background. She really never wanted her kids to know the things that she went through as a child and as a young adult. She was ashamed of the things that she went through, so she kept everything inside.What I think is going to happen is that James is that he is gonna have to realize that he can not be out doing drugs and skipping school. also he is going to have to grow up really fast.\n\nAfter Hunter Jordan dies of a stroke in his stepson James’ fourteenth year, both Ruth (James’ mother) and James himself act out accordingly. James falls into a path of rebellion; he “snached purses[and] shoplifted,”(McBride 6) as well as “[did] Superfly,Shaft, and reefer, which [they] smoked in as much quantity as possible.” (McBride 6). Upon all this, his siblings would just say that “James is going through his revolution” (McBride 6), in which it is clear that he was perhaps the only one besides his mother oh so affected by Jordan’s death and that James was not getting the help he needed to grieve properly.\n\nDuring his stay in Louisville, James learns a lot about what he wants to be through what he saw and what he experienced. Once he returned home, James states that “Deep inside I knew that my old friend Chicken Man back in Louisville was right. I wasn’t any smarter, or any wiser, or any bolder than the cats on the corner, and if I chose that life I would end up on the corner.” (McBride 161). This reveals that James took the lessons he was taught by those in Louisville to heart, and they had a real effect on him. This is significant because without\n\nThis is fueled by, not only the changing emotions that teenagers typically endure, but also by the death of his stepfather, whom he saw as his own father. After his death, James cannot bear to see his mother suffer, for she no longer knows how to control the dynamics of the family and \"wandered in an emotional stupor for nearly a year.\" James instead turns to alcohol and drugs, dropping out of school to play music and go around with his friends, which James refers to as \"my own process of running, emotionally disconnecting myself from her, as if by doing to I could keep her suffering from touching me.\" Instead of turning to his family and becoming \"the king in the house, the oldest kid,\" James \"spent as much time away from home as possible absolve[ing] [himself] of all responsibility \" As a result, Ruth sends James to live with his older half sister and her husband, in an attempt to straighten her out her son's life. James distracts himself with the life he found there, spending the summers on a street corner with his half sister's husband, Big Richard, whom he adores, and the unique men that frequented the area. During these summers, James discovers \"[He] could hide. No one knew [him]. No one knew [his] past, [his] white mother, [his] dead father, nothing. It was perfect. [His] problems seemed far, far away.\" Instead of facing the realities of loss and anger in his family, James seeks distractions\n\nThe reason why I keep referring to chapter 14 isn’t because it’s the only chapter I’ve read, but because I feel as though this is a very important chapter that gives you a clear view of what James was going through in his teenage years and how these events made him grow up into the man he is today. When Malcolm X was young he lacked morals like most of us. It wasn’t until Malcolm was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison when became a Muslim and adopted morals. In chapter 2 of Malcolm X’s autobiography Malcolm attempts to be a boxer but ends up getting beaten by the same white boy twice. Malcolm says “A lot of times in these later years since I became a Muslim, I’ve thought back to that fight and reflected that it was Allah’s work to stop me: I might have wound up punchy.” This shows me that ever since Malcolm became a Muslim he no longer believed in physical violence.\n\nDespite the fact that he respected his mother, James grew to question her unorthodox strictness and unusual teachings. Eventually, he graduated college to become a press writer and a jazz musician, yet he still felt incomplete. James says \"Play sax, write books, compose music, do something, express yourself, who the hell are you anyway? There were two worlds bursting inside me trying to get out. I had to find out more about who I was...\" (330). Even though James has a great job that pays well, he still quits because he wishes to figure out who he is. By saying this, he proves that he wants to find his identity and reason for continuing his line of work. I chose this quote because it clearly demonstrates how James feels about finding his identity.\n\nThroughout Jim Jones childhood and adulthood Jim Jones was a very religious person which changed his experience towards many things in his lifetime. Jim Jones was born on May 13, 1931 and throughout his childhood “he was a strong student, especially in public speaking, but he had few friends. His overpowering zest turned off some, and he, in turn, disliked many typical teenage boy activities such as sports, and objected what he believed to be sinful behavior, such as dancing and drinking” (Biography.com Editors). Ever since his childhood, his religious beliefs had taken over his body and viewed many things against him throughout his\n\nOne of the more interesting parts of the movie is James’s reaction to the real word. It shows that James cannot cope in a civilian lifestyle. This is very evident when he goes back home to the States. In the supermarket he seems lost, a feeling he never really seemed to have in Iraq. He hesitates when he picks out a cereal; James never hesitated back in Iraq. His inability to cope with civilian society is also very evident when he is in his house. He tries to tell his ex-wife all about the stories he has from Iraq but she does not listen. It appears that being in a bomb squad is the only thing that he talks and cares about. The defining moment that explains James’s inability to be a civilian is when he talks his son. He says that there is only one thing in the world he loves. The next scene shows him going back to Iraq and putting the bomb suit back on. This scene in particular highlights his addiction to war. He was unable to have a happy life at home so he needed to go to the one place that made him happy. It can be compared to a drug addict going back into a relapse after a break. Although one can argue that James’s addiction to war is an effect of the war which would make the movie anti-war, the last\n\nIn James’ case he knew that if he worked hard at school he could gain his fathers approval. However it seemed that he was in the shadow of his brother, who was also under the same pressure. He had turned to cheating to get better marks to avoid his father’s disapproval. James’ own sense of right and wrong were being clouded by his loyalty to- and competition with his brother, also his need for approval from his father and his sense of duty to protect his frail mother by “not\n\nJames Joseph Brown, Jr., a.k.a. James Brown was born in Barnwell, State of South Carolina May 3, 1933. At his age of four, he moved to Georgia to live with his Aunt. At his young age, Brown was in the time of the Great Depression so he took whatever job that he could find just to make some money. In 1944, Brown showed his talent for the first time and won first place for an open music convention in Lenox Theater. Later on, Brown got kicked out of school at the age of twelve for not having proper clothing. Now that Brown does not need to go to school, he worked full-time with the low paying jobs. Because of his harsh life growing up in the racism society, Brown had hold on to music"
