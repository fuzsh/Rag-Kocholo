        "text": "You could bet your bottom dollar that for decades there hasn’t been one moment when someone, somewhere in the world wasn’t tapping a toe to a James Brown groove, be it an original recording or one of the many tunes that sampled his work.\n\nIndeed, his “Funky Drummer” – the most sampled cut of all time – was released 50 years ago, on 27 March 1970, while the monumental “Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine” was recorded on 25 April 1970 at Starday King Studio, Cincinnati. The tune that changed the face of music forever, “Sex Machine”, so familiar to teenagers, octogenarians and everyone in between, has to be the most played dance record in history, one that all and sundry has danced to. “I want to get into it, y’know / Like a like a Sex Machine, man / Moving, doing it, you know. Can I count it off? / 1/2/3/4.”\n\nSubsequently, James Brown and his baby – funk (derived from the Flemish fonck, “agitation or disturbance”) – has, whether its hip hop, jazz funk, drum and bass or grime, influenced dance floors for at least 50 years and counting, and, love him or hate him, it is still totally impossible to consider a world without Mr James Brown.\n\n1. Having been sampled more than 5,200 times, James Brown is the most sampled artist of all time, while “Funky Drummer” and its beat (created by Clyde Stubblefield) has been purloined some 1,584 times by, among many others, Sweet T and Jazzy Joyce, Public Enemy, Run DMC, Ice Tee, De La Soul, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Dr Dre and even George Michael, Madonna and Britney Spears.\n\n2. He was born James Joseph Brown in either 1933 or 1928 in the pine forest of Barnwell, South Carolina, in a lean, wooden shack devoid of windows, water, toilet, electricity, gas or running water. An only child, he had no shoes, wore rags and had no neighbours for ten miles around. His mother left when he was four after his alcoholic, physically abusive father tried to kill her. From an early age Brown spent most of his time alone, his father away working the turpentine camps while pater’s common law wives didn’t stay for long to look after young James. “Being alone at night in that cabin in the woods with nobody else there worked a change in me that has stayed with me from then on,” he wrote in his autobiography. “It gave me my own mind.”\n\n3. Aged eight he moved into his aunt Honey’s (real name Handsome Washington) brothel in Augusta, Georgia, where he perfected his “buck dance” – a solo gambol native to North Carolina not unlike tap – to entertain the troops and guide them in to the knocking shop. Here, in order to further regale the serviceman and earn a few coins, he learned the piano, guitar and harmonica, while his call-and-answer shtick was picked up from barnstorming preachers in the local churches that Brown was oft to frequent.\n\n4. Young James was arrested aged 15, for robbery, tried as an adult and received an eight- to 16-year sentence in the Georgia Juvenile Training Institute in Toccoa, Georgia, where he started a gospel group. Bobby Byrd and his family’s gospel choir visited the facility to entertain the young offenders, met James and, having assured the authorities that they would give the young delinquent a home, he was released into their care. He’d served three long years. He then joined Byrd’s band, The Gospel Starlighters, and in 1954 a wild young piano player named Little Richard allowed them to play support for him in Toccoa and thus forever influenced the young tearaway.\n\n5. In 1965, after he’d secured million-selling hits with “Night Train” and his phenomenal Live At The Apollo long player, the ever assured, ever audacious Brown ditched conventional verse and chorus structure and eliminated chord progressions. It was now purely about the groove and every instrument was treated like a drum and every riff syncopated. “Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag” (recorded in less than an hour, in February 1965) changed the face of music forever. “They said it was the beginning of funk,” he uttered. “I thought it was where my music was going. The title told it all, I have a new bag.”\n\n6. The day after the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King, Brown, on 5 April 1968, during a live televised concert in Boston, appealed to the audience for calm and stopped a riot in the city. In June, he played live in front of armed forces on the front line in Vietnam. In August he released “Say It Loud (I’m Black And I’m Proud)”, which became an anthem, and he subsequently set up an educational programme entitled “Don’t Be A Drop Out” for disenfranchised black youth. He then named himself “Soul Brother Number One”.\n\n7. Having supported the Democrat vice president Hubert Humphrey in 1968, he switched sides and supported Richard Nixon the following year. This caused much consternation among his fans and the black community as Nixon symbolised everything the Godfather had campaigned against. By all accounts, he did this because that year the IRS claimed that Brown, who always insisted on being paid in cash and rarely paid tax, owed them $6.5 million and he wrongly believed that Nixon would come to his rescue. Consequently, the IRS took his jet, his radio stations (which hadn’t paid a cent of royalties), his James Brown’s Gold Platter fast food chain, his cars and tried to get his house.\n\n8. Brown, aged 37, sacked his backing band in March 1970 after they complained about his system of fining anyone who played a bum note. In their place he pulled in a young Cincinnati act named The Pacesetters, led by brother Catfish and Bootsy Collins, aged 27 and 19 respectively, and renamed them The JB’s. Their first recording was “Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine”, while their first LP, Sex Machine, is cited as one of the greatest and most important soul records of all time.\n\n9. In 1971 Soul Brother Number One launched his People Records label and for five years produced and released some of the finest dance tunes ever committed to tape. These milestone cuts such as “Think (About It)” by Lyn Collins, “I Know You Got Soul” by Bobby Byrd, Maceo And The Mack’s “Cross The Track”, “Soul Power 74” and “Same Beat” and “Gimme Some More” by Fred Wesley and The JB’s became the backbone for hip hop and, to this day, continue to rock any dance floor.\n\n10. His career took a dive due to the disco phenomenon in the late 1970s. He was rediscovered after he met John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd in Studio 54 in 1979 and they asked him to play Reverend Cleophus James in 1980 movie The Blues Brothers.\n\n11. By the mid-1980s his music was everywhere all over again. His original vinyl recordings were selling for huge amounts and he was earning millions from the myriad hit records that sampled his work. “There’d be no hip hop without James Brown,” clarified Chuck Dee of Public Enemy.\n\n12. In 1984 he married Adrienne Lois Rodriguez and took to smoking PCP, which, also known as Angel Dust, is a mind-bending hallucinogenic that causes acute anxiety, paranoia and violent hostility. By 1988 she had called 911 to report domestic violence some eleven times, by which time he was arrested three times and charged with assault and intent to kill, possession of PCP, resisting arrest and illegal possession of a pistol. Meanwhile, she stabbed a woman with scissors (with whom she thought James was having an affair) and a month later was arrested for setting Mr Brown’s clothes on fire in a hotel room and possessing seven ounces of PCP.\n\n13. After walking into his business office in Augusta on 24 September 1988, Brown, aged 55, and under the influence, believing that someone had used his private water closet without the self-monikered Soul Brother Number One/The Minister Of The New New Super Heavy Funk/The Godfather Of Soul’s permission, burst into an insurance seminar next door and, waving his pump-action shotgun, demanded to know just who the dastardly culprit was. When the police arrived, “the funkiest man alive, sitting in his red and white Ford pick-up, did a screeching U-turn and sped off”. Officers pursued him across two states and it was only when they shot out his tires, riddled his car with 23 bullets and formed a human line in the road that he stopped. According to a Georgia Highway Patrol officer, when he got out of the car he sang the song “Georgia” and “did the ‘Good Foot’ dance”. He was consequently sentenced to six years in prison for trying to run over two police officers but was paroled in 1991 after serving only two and a half. “It wasn’t so terrible,” he later stated. “I needed the rest bad.” He now acquired a new moniker: His Bad Self.\n\n14. Two years after Adrienne, after attempting to recover from liposuction by imbibing a rich mix of Demerol, Vicodin, Valium, morphine and PC, died of a heart attack, Brown walked onto his lawn naked and shot a .22 calibre handgun and a .30 calibre rifle in the air and was put in a mental facility and observed. Two years later he was accused of chasing a young electric company repairman, who’d called to look into a complaint regarding Brown’s over-head lighting, down the street with a big steak knife.\n\n15. Even though he died on Christmas Day 2006, the wrangling continues regarding his estate. A judge ordered a DNA test, which confirmed that Brown was indeed James Jnr’s father, but they had to cut his legs off to get to his bone marrow for a sample. The battle over his estimated $100 million estate between the mothers of his children (at least six and up to as many as nine), 16 grandchildren, many mistresses, a former manager, 30 lawyers, a long-serving valet still continues to this day in the South Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nNow read\n\nThe 14 songs that prove Joni Mitchell’s genius\n\n15 Ray Charles songs that prove he was one of the greats\n\nTen Blondie songs that changed new wave"
