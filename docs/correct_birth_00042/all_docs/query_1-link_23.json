        "text": "ORANGEBURG — Papa's got a brand new place to put his bag.\n\nAn exhibit featuring the personal belongings of soul singer James Brown is to be open through the summer at South Carolina State University. It includes costumes, original sheet music, awards, trophies and other items that were in Brown's Beech Island home.\n\nDaughter Deanna Brown says the exhibit shows an eclectic side of her father that many did not see. She says the items in the home will be the basis of a planned museum for Brown after legal issues over his estate are settled.\n\nBrown died Christmas Day 2006."
