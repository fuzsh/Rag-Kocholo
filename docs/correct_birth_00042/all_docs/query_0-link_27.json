        "text": "Today is James Brown's birthday.\n\nBrown was known worldwide as a music visionary who brought soul music to mainstream audiences, developed the propulsive, riff-oriented music that became known as funk and drew up the political and musical blueprint for the hip-hop revolution.\n\nKnown universally by his nickname, \"The Godfather of Soul,\" Brown said that his music was originally influenced by the gospel and jazz he heard as a young man.\n\n\"I was a gospel singer,\" he once said in an interview with The Chronicle. \"All day Sunday we would sing gospel music, and then in the evening we would go to jazz. I knew that I wanted music that was comfortable, easy to listen to while being commercial and up to date.\"\n\nThe result was a form that blended the syncopated rhythms from jazz with the soulful delivery of gospel. Combined with Brown's unique delivery and magnetic stage presence, the music influenced musicians from the Rolling Stones to Michael Jackson.\n\nPHOTOS: James Brown - The Performer\n\nAlthough born in Barnwell County, S.C., and a resident of Beech Island, Brown was known in his later years as a warm and generous presence in Augusta, the city in which he grew up.\n\n\"If there's one thing James Brown always made sure of, whether it was in his songs or in his statements, everybody knew he was from Augusta, Ga.,\" said former Augusta Mayor Charles DeVaney, who fondly remembered Brown's inserting the city's name into his song Living in America.\n\nThe city returned the favor with a number of honors, including renaming its civic center the James Brown Arena in August 2006 and adding the name James Brown Boulevard to Ninth Street in 1992.\n\nA life-size statue of the performer was erected in 2005 on Broad Street facing the Augusta Common, which was the site in 2006 of the James Brown Soul of America Music Festival, an event at which Brown performed.\n\nPHOTOS: James Brown - Honors\n\nIn 2003, he went to Washington, D.C., where he was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors, recognizing outstanding contribution to the fabric of American culture.\n\nJames Brown did a lot of things for Augusta, but some say one of his most notable performances occurred in May 1970.\n\nPHOTOS: James Brown - Philanthropy\n\nAfter days of rioting sparked by the beating death of a 16-year-old black youth in the Richmond County jail, Gov. Lester Maddox summoned Brown to Augusta to help quell the unrest.\n\nBrown, who had been performing in Flint, Mich., answered the call, but not before more than 100 city blocks were burned or damaged.\n\nIn 2000, the 30th anniversary of the riots, Brown discussed the events in an interview with The Augusta Chronicle.\n\n\"(The riot) was Augusta's warning ticket,\" Brown said at the time.\n\n\"You had tanks in the middle of the street and armored trucks,\" he told the newspaper. \"Me and my daddy and a couple more people were going through the community trying to stop them, talking to the looters and calm the people and not take sides.\"\n\nIn 2006, one person who lived through the riots described Brown as a central force behind stopping them.\n\n\"He was a real person who cared about the city,\" said Cecil Atchley, a former soldier who was stationed at Fort Gordon at the time.\n\nHe recalled how he was summoned to the military installation from his home and how military police were put on alert because of the riots.\n\n\"It wasn't a black-white thing with James Brown,\" said Atchley, who in later years became a political activist in Aiken County and met with Brown more than once.\n\n\"He said we need to stop and work together,\" Mr. Atchley said of the riots. \"I remember him saying this is a lose-lose situation if we don't stop this.\"\n\nAs celebrated as Brown's life would become, it was not without frequent problems with the law.\n\nBy the age of 16, in 1949, he had served 3 years in reform school for breaking into cars.\n\nIn September 1988, Brown, high on drugs and carrying a shotgun, entered an insurance seminar next to his Augusta office. Police said he asked seminar participants whether they were using his private restroom.\n\nPHOTOS: James Brown - Legal Troubles\n\nPolice chased Brown for a half-hour from Augusta into South Carolina and back to Georgia. The chase ended when police shot out the tires of his truck.\n\nHe received a six-year prison sentence and spent 15 months in a South Carolina prison and 10 months in a work release program before being paroled in February 1991.\n\nIn 2003, the South Carolina parole board granted him a pardon for his crimes in that state.\n\nIn January 2004, Brown again made news when he was arrested and jailed overnight after a fight with his wife.\n\nThe incident was soon forgotten, and the couple and their son frequently appeared together at a variety of public functions.\n\nThe pioneering soul, funk and civil rights icon died in 2006 on Christmas Day. He had the biggest funeral in the city's history, with more than 8,000 fans packing the arena that bears his name.\n\nIt was a send-off that oftentimes rocked with old-time gospel and R&B and was attended by Michael Jackson, whom the Godfather of Soul inspired.\n\nThe celebration brought to a conclusion a life that began in abject poverty 73 years earlier and ended with the world bemoaning the loss of a music genius.\n\nAnd he posthumously received an honorary doctorate degree in humane letters from Paine College.\n\nNot bad for a man with a third-grade education, said his attorney Buddy Dallas.\n\n\"Today is the end of a long journey and the beginning of a new journey,\" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, longtime Brown family friend and civil rights activist who presided over the funeral flanked by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. \"We came to thank God for James Brown because only God could have made a James Brown possible. And only God can give a James Brown rest.\"\n\nJames Brown\n\nMay 3, 1933: Born in Barnwell, S.C.\n\n1953: Joins the Gospel Starlighters vocal quartet.
