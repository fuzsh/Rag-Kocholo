Biography

James Brown Jr. is Notable.

James Brown, the "Godfather of Soul," was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer and bandleader who inspired and influenced not only other performers, but several genres of music as well. He built a reputation as a tireless live performer.

James Joseph Brown was born in a shack during the Great Depression in rural Barnwell County, South Carolina, USA, on 3 May 1933. He said he was the only child of Joe Gardner Brown, of "mixed African-American and Native American" descent, and Susie Behling, of "mixed African-American and Asian" descent.[1][2]

About 1940, probably after his mother left (she fled to New York to escape an abusive relationship), the family moved to Augusta, Georgia. He lived with his paternal great-aunt Hansom (Scott) Washington, and his aunt Minnie Walker also helped with his upbringing.[2]

James Brown married four times:[2]

1953/June/19 in Toccoa, Augusta County, Georgia to Velma Warren (divorced: 23 August 1969, with three sons)

1970 in Barnwell County, South Carolina to Deidre "Dee Dee" Jenkins (divorced: 10 Jan 1981, with two daughters)

1984 to Adrienne Lois Rodriguez (1950-1996) (separated: April 1994, with no children; widowed 1996)

2001/December/23 at his home, Beech Island, South Carolina to Tomi Rae Hynie (with one son)

On 15 March 1966 he won his first Grammy Award for Best Rhythm & Blues Recording, for the song "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag," -- the first of his eventual seventeen #1 hits on the R&B chart.

By 1967 his emerging sound began to be defined as funk music ... By this time [1969] his vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured traces of pitch or melody. This would become a major influence on the techniques of rapping, which would come to maturity along with hip hop music in the coming decades. ... For many years, Brown's touring show was one of the most spectacular productions in American popular music ... He wore extravagant outfits and his elaborate processed hairdo completed the visual impression. He danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the Mashed Potato into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides ... [3]

He was known as the hardest working man in show business - his performances were famous for their intensity and length. In addition, his horn players and singing group typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later included backup dancers. His unique dance style was an inspiration for those who came after him, including Michael Jackson and Prince.

He recorded 17 singles that reached #1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart which did not reach #1. [3] The song "Living in America" was his last Top 10 single and was heavily featured in the movie Rocky IV, starring Sylvester Stallone as his famous character, Rocky Balboa. It helped him win his second Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 1987. In a career that lasted over 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres.[3]

Brown is ranked #1 in The Top 500 Artists. He is ranked #7 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of its "100 Greatest Artists of All Time." Rolling Stone has also cited him as the most sampled artist of all time.[3]

His personal life was scarred by domestic violence and tragedy, beginning with his parents and his mother's flight. But his second wife, "Dee Dee," tracked down his mother in New York City and reunited the two. [4] His eldest son, Teddy Brown, died in a car crash at age 19 on 14 June 1973.

On 26 Jan 1988, James Brown was appointed to the personal military staff of Gov. H. Guy Hunt as Aide-de-Camp with the rank of Hon. Lieutenant Colonel in the Alabama State Militia. [5]

On 1 August 2000, he signed his last will and testament and an irrevocable trust, which list among his heirs his acknowledged children living as of that date.[6][7]

Six years later he died on 25 December 2006 [8] [9] [10] [11] of pneumonia at Emory Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia, USA [3] and was buried at the Thomas Family Home Crypt in Beech Island, Aiken County, South Carolina, USA. [12] [13] A number of memorial ceremonies were held; one was at the Apollo Theater, where he had performed many times and in 1962 had recorded a live album which spent 66 weeks at the top of the Billboard albums pop chart.
