        "text": "While many Black Dahlia researchers think of Mark Hansen when they hear of the Florentine Gardens, it was show promoter and producer, Nils T. Granlund that audiences associated with the club. Granlund, better known to Broadway and Hollywood audiences as \"N.T.G.\", and to friends as \"Granny,\" operated the floor shows at the Florentine Gardens during the 1940's.\n\nHe was born in Sweden in 1890 and is credited with being the inventor of the modern cabaret or nightclub. His career in show business began in 1912 when Marcus Loew personally hired him to promote his stage show \"Hanky Panky.\" Granlund had a 45 year career in show business. He referred to himself \"as press agent, radio broadcaster, vaudeville impresario, and producer of night-club shows from Texas Guinan's blistering bistro to the Flamingo in Las Vegas.\" He either discovered or was instrumental in making famous such legends as Ruby Keeler, Ruby Stevens (Barbara Stanwyck), Clara Bow and Lucille LaSuer (Joan Crawford).\n\nGranlund was a sailor and newspaper reporter in New England in his youth. As a reporter, he and Damon Runyon, Walter Winchell and Mark Hellinger were fast friends. Granlund once wrote of his nightclub days in New York: \"Before this new industry was two years old I had produced a dozen or more shows in competing cabarets. At one time I operated in six different clubs simultaneously and all of these places were owned by gangsters.\" In the 1920's, when flashy nightclubs were the biggest entertainment in New York, Granny provided the girls for Ziegfeld's Follies, Earl Carroll's Vanities and George White's Scandal.\n\nAfter providing the talent for so many others, Granny finally opened his own nightclub in New York on Broadway at 48th Street. It has been credited as being the first modern nightclub and was the model for all that followed. He opened the Hollywood Restaurant shortly after the repeal of the 18th Amendment and introduced a new era in supper clubs. One of his early discoveries was Harriet Hilliard, who later married Ozzie Nelson. The New York Daily Mirror wrote, \"N.T.G. is the conceiver, inventor, and creator of modern night life. The Hollywood was the daddy of practically every cabaret in the business today.\"\n\nIn 1940, when Granlund began his association with the Florentine, Earl Carroll's nightclub and restaurant on Sunset Boulevard was the classy address. Granny once said, \"the owner of the Florentine at this time was Frank Bruni, and the joint was flooded with red ink. He propositioned me to bring a show into the place and try to put it on its feet. It was a challenge, and the kind I have never been able to resist.\"\n\n\"The Florentine had never enjoyed a very high reputation. One reason, which seemed obvious to me, was the fact that the management would never pay salaries that would attract high-class entertainment.\"\n\n\"I agreed to go into the Florentine Gardens for six weeks, just to see what could be done. The six weeks stretched to six months to five years before I finally left. And in that time it made a $1,000,000 net profit.\"\n\nIn 1944, the nightclub was charged with hiring two 15 year old girls, the Stull sisters, Jean and Dean. Sugar Geise, wife of Walter Morgan, of the D.A.'s office and vice squad, was the lead girl in the Florentine Gardens when N.T.G. ran the shows. She said, \"Nils only hired pretty girls. If you were beautiful and could move, that's all you needed.\" Sugar once said, \"Listen, if I wrote a book I'd have to leave town.\"\n\nThe names of Anne Toth and Elizabeth Short are never mentioned among the showgirls at the Florentine. Anne, who was acting and modeling at the time, had a connection through Mark Hansen. Elizabeth Short also had the connection, but seemed to lack ambition or interest.\n\nHe put the Mills Brothers in the cabaret lounge off the dining room and soon moved them to the main stage when their popularity rose. He soon hired bandleaders Ozzie Nelson and Paul Whitman and entertainers Sophie Tucker and Harry Richman.\n\nGranlund and Milton Berle did a comedy routine together in New York in the 1920's. In the 1940's, when both were living in California, Berle called up Granny and said he wanted to hold his wedding reception at the Florentine Gardens. By this time, both were established performers, but they ran through some of their old material at the reception.\n\nShowgirls were his specialty and in the 1940's he had a chorus line that included future stars, Yvonne De Carlo, Marie McDonald, Gwen Verdon, Lili St. Cyr and Jean Wallace. The main dining room seated 600 customers, and with Granlund's expertise, the club was filling up most nights.\n\nIn 1946, the year Beth Short came to Hollywood, Granlund was the announcer for \"You're in the Act,\" a CBS radio program that broadcast five days a week from the Florentine Gardens. He made three movies during the 1940's, including \"Rhythm Parade, filmed largely at the Florentine. He also played himself in \"Goin' to Town\" and \"Take it Big.\"\n\nGranny's wife, Rose Wenzel, was an early Skouras brothers star in their St. Louis theater. The brothers went on to become the owners of more theaters than any other outfit in the world. They kept up with N.T.G. and Rose through the years.\n\nAfter his engagement at the Florentine, N.T.G. continued his career in Las Vegas. In 1949, Moe Sedway hired him to set up shows at the Flamingo. In 1950, Granlund made his television debut in \"Backstage with N.T.G.\"\n\nSeven years later, in 1957, he died in Las Vegas after his taxi was hit by another car on the Strip near the Riviera Hotel. His body was claimed by former Florentine showgirl and friend, Yvonne De Carlo.\n\n- Gus Topley\n\nThe district attorney’s office identified 22 suspects in the murder of Elizabeth Short. The list included half a dozen doctors, medical students, a “queer woman surgeon,” soldiers, working men and con men, and a night club impresario. The field was wide open.\n\n(1) Carl Balsiger:\n\nIn late 1946, Carl Balsiger’s residence was listed as 7424 W. Sunset Boulevard, near Gardner Street in West Hollywood.\n\nHe said he met Beth Short on December 6 at a real estate office on Sunset Boulevard and drove her to Camarillo, about 40 miles northwest, where he had business. He claimed that he brought her back to Hollywood the same day and that he checked her into a hotel on Yucca Street. Balsiger said he drove her to the bus station in Hollywood, where she was to catch a bus to the bay area on December 7.\n\nBalsiger was from a “nice” family in Kansas City, according to the district attorney records, and worked as a salesman for Marwyn Dairy at the time of the murder. He also sold flour and syrup.\n\n(2) Claude Welsh:\n\nIt is unknown if this suspect knew Elizabeth Short.\n\n(3) Sergeant “Chuck”:\n\nThe last name of this suspect is unknown;There is a Camp Cooke connection with Elizabeth Short.\n\n(4) John D. Wade:\n\nWade had a Crown Grill connection with Elizabeth Short.\n\n(5) Joe Scalise:\n\nJoe Scalise worked at the Crown Grill across the street from the Biltmore on January 9, 1947. Two other employees said they saw Elizabeth Short there that night.\n\n(6)James Neemo:\n\nJames Neemo was an usher that worked at the CBS studios in Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard near Vine Street. He worked directly under head usher John Egger. Egger said he saw Beth “at least twenty times” at the radio studio. She always came alone, except once when she was with a man who identified himself with his badge as a Chicago police officer. Beth usually waited in line to see a broadcast, but this time she was allowed in with the man through a side door as a courtesy to the officer. He said she came to see the Jack Carson show on either January 2 or January 8.\n\n(7) Maurice Clement:\n\nClement worked at Columbia Studios at the time of the murder. He lived in Hollywood at 1616 N. Normandie, apartment 107. His name was found in Elizabeth Short’s address book.\n\n(8) Unknown Chicago Police Officer:\n\nA man accompanying Elizabeth Short to a radio program at CBS studios in January, 1947, showed a Chicago police badge to CBS employees. His identity was never established.\n\n(9) Salvador Torres Vera:\n\nVera frequented Brittingham’s restaurant in Columbia Square, but it has never been confirmed that he knew Elizabeth Short.\n\n(10) Dr. George Hodel:\n\nHodel lived at the Sowden House in Hollywood and had offices in downtown Los Angeles. His home was secretly wired for eavesdropping some time after the murder. It was never proved that he knew Elizabeth Short.\n\n(11) Marvin Margolis:\n\nMarvin Margolis and Bill Robinson visited Mark Hansen’s home “quite often,” according to Anne Toth. She said that Bill was Marjorie’s boyfriend, but on one occasion he attacked Beth. “This Bill Robinson tried to take advantage of her once and he slapped her in the face and threw her out of the car. She came home crying about that. I don’t think anyone else tried anything.”\n\nMark Hansen described Bill Robinson and Marvin Margolis, saying, “They had a lot of nerve, those two guys. Always had to chase them out.” Concerning Margolis, Hansen said, “Well, I didn’t pay much attention to his conversation. He was a windy blower. I had to ask him to leave there. I didn’t want him around.”\n\nJohn Egger, who was 20 years old in January, 1947, described Beth to authorities, saying, “The thing sir, we always notice a girl like that, she was a striking girl, with that raven hair, blue sweater or pink sweater, she more or less became a legend and when we saw her with a man we paid more attention-.”\n\n(12) Glynn Wolfe:\n\nAnne Toth did not care for Glynn Wolfe. She described him as a “Lousy character. I would say. One of the worst type.” She said he was a “-sexual pervert, maniac, everything. I hate him. He even threatened to kill me once,” “because I was going to turn him over to the O.P.A. He was putting four girls into a room, where there should have been two, for $5.00.”\n\nWolfe, according to district attorney notes, lived two blocks south of Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n(13) Michael Anthony Otero:\n\nOtero was identified as being in the company of Elizabeth Short on December 6. 1946, prior to her departure for San Diego. He was the only known person to have been with Elizabeth Short at the Biltmore Hotel, before her return to Los Angeles on January 9, 1947. He was known as “the teacher” by Anne Toth, and his Spanish book was found among Beth’s belongings after her murder.\n\n(14) George Bacos:\n\nGeorge Bacos was the head usher at the NBC studios, according to John Egger, the head usher at the CBS studios down the block. Egger said, “I don’t like him very well. He is very conceited; I just don’t care for him myself. Never very close to him, just speaking acquaintance.”\n\nBacos lived at 650 S. Maltman in Los Angeles on January 15, 1947. He picked up Beth one night when he had tickets for a radio show. He said he was going to take Lynn Martin, but she wasn’t home, so he asked Beth. They were too late when they got there, so he drove her out to the Sunset Strip, where, he said, they parked and talked for awhile before he took her home. He described her, saying, “She wore a black satin skirt with a sweater – a pink sweater. Always wore something in her hair.”\n\nBacos claimed he was not attracted to Beth and often stayed away from her.\n\n“I used to see her with a lot of people. As a matter of fact, for my part I tried to avoid her as much as possible. I was new in radio and made contacts, and she dressed kinda cheaply, you know, too obvious and everything. It was best for me especially. Where you would see her most was around CBS I couldn’t afford to be seen with the wrong kind of people.”\n\nHe told investigators he had seen Beth about twelve times. Bacos was also a friend of George price, who had photographed Lynn in the nude. He said he frequented Brittinghams, the restaurant in Columbia Square.\n\n(15) Francis Campbell:\n\nCampbell was on duty at the Crown Grill the night of January 9, 1947.\n\n(16) Queer Woman Surgeon:\n\nElizabeth Short may have made contact with a female abortionist in the San Fernando Valley. There is no positive identification of this person.\n\n(17) Dr. Paul De Gaston:\n\nDeCaston was identified as an abortionist who practiced under the alias, Dr. C. J. Morris in downtown Los Angeles. He was tried for murder in 1934 and served time for performing abortions. His name and address were found in Elizabeth Short’s address book after her murder.\n\n(18) Dr. A. R. Brix:\n\nA business card for Dr. Brix was found in the effects of Elizabeth Short after her murder. Dr. Brix said she visited his office once, inquiring about his charges for treatment of female trouble. He said she did not return.\n\n(19) Dr. M. M. Schwartz:\n\nDr. Schwartz was located in the Cherokee Building on Hollywood Boulevard, less than two blocks from the Chancellor. Mark Hansen said he drove Elizabeth Short to Schwartz’s office. The Doctor said she was a patient of Dr. Faught, with whom he shared a nurse in the Cherokee Building.\n\n(20) Dr. Arthur McGinnis Faught:\n\nDr. Faught, who died in 1949, treated Elizabeth Short for a problem with her Bartholin gland, a lubricating gland in the vagina. According to Dr. Schwartz, Dr. Faught had lanced the gland several different times.\n\n(21) Dr. Patrick S. O’Reilly:\n\nDr. O’Reilly was a good friend of Mark Hansen and spent time at the Florentine Gardens. He was arrested and convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in the sever beating of his secretary in a motel.\n\n(22) Mark Hansen:\n\nAccording to Mark Hansen, it was Sid Zaid who first introduced him to Elizabeth Short, when he brought her to his home. “I didn’t know anything about the girl at all.”\n\nHansen said, “The last time I saw the girl was when I took her to the Chancellor Apartment over there. I never seen her since. She never showed up after she called up and say she was in San Diego.” She didn’t like the Chancellor, he said, and that women were attacking her there, indicating they were lesbians. He also said she didn’t like them.\n\nAnne said that he thought Gordon Fickling was her killer. “He right away thought he was the one that did it. That is what he insisted upon.”\n\nAnne said that Hansen had a vacancy at one of his rooming houses around the time of the murder. When asked by authorities later, he couldn’t recall if he did or not. They asked him, “Now, would you be willing to cooperate with the police department and the District Attorney’s office to the extent that you would permit the laboratory experts – crime lab of the police department to come out and check for blood in all the rooms of these two rooming houses?” Hansen replied, “Oh sure.”\n\nIn January, 1949, Conwell L. Keller, a LAPD officer and former gangster squad member, testified at the Black Dahlia investigation. He was asked, if he thought he had a pretty good suspect “in Hansen possibly?” Keller replied, “Yes. He is mixed into it somewhere.”\n\n“The world will whirl around forever\n\nBut you won’t be there to know or to care\n\nRemember, you’re only young once.”\n\n~ From the 1937 Andy Hardy film, You’re Only Young Once\n\nElizabeth Short was born on July 29, 1924 in Hyde Park, Massachusetts to the parents of Cleo and Phoebe Short. She was raised nearby in Medford, where she attended school. Her father deserted the family when Elizabeth and her siblings were young.\n\n* * *\n\nBefore Elizabeth Short ventured out into the world and was given the appellation, “The Black Dahlia,” she was a local girl who grew up in Medford, Massachusetts, one of five daughters raised by a caring mother during the Great Depression.\n\nShe was well liked at school, and according to newspaper reports after her death, her school mates described her as a “movie struck girl.” She was called “Medford High’s Deanna Durbin,” referring to the widely popular film actress and singer. In Elizabeth’s autograph book, there were 10 references to the nickname. One passage read, “To a friend worth having and Medford High’s Deanna Durbin.” Another said, “To the sweetest and cutest double of Deanna Durbin.”\n\n* * *\n\nWhen she was old enough, Elizabeth began traveling, something she would do frequently throughout her brief life. Her mother said she left high school before graduation to “venture on her own.” She was an attractive, dark haired woman with light blue eyes and pale, white skin and a feigned air of sophistication. She worked occasionally, but was usually without funds, living in hotels or homes of friends or acquaintances, often at the expense of others.\n\nHer mother said, “She was a very affectionate, sweet girl and if she was out at night she always stopped in my bedroom to talk. And she would talk and talk and tell everything that she had done and everything.” She was the prettiest of the sisters and wrote to her mother frequently when she was away from home.\n\nShe first went to Florida as a teenager for her health and later moved around the country, stirring the attention of young men and creating a sense of mystery about herself. When she was only 22 years old, she disappeared from the streets of Los Angeles and was not seen again until her naked, bifurcated body was discovered in a vacant lot in Leimert Park. Her murder was never solved and her incomplete story has become part of Los Angeles lore.\n\n* * *\n\n1942\n\nOn August 17, 1942, 23 year old Matt Gordon arrived in Miami, Florida. He and Elizabeth Short would have a brief whirlwind romance that ended in his early death.\n\nAccording to district attorney documents, Phoebe Short and her daughter Elizabeth, “saw the father, Cleo Short on the street in Medford, Mass.” Phoebe said that her daughter had a conversation with Cleo. Later, Beth wrote to her father expressing her desire to visit with him and care for him. Cleo said he sent his daughter $200 and in December, 1942, Beth traveled to Vallejo, California and stayed with her father.\n\nAfter awhile, father and daughter moved to Los Angeles, where Cleo lived with a friend from Vallejo, a Mrs. Yankee, at 1028 1/2 W. 36th Street. Roughly three weeks later, Beth left word with Mrs. Monte, a neighbor in a rear house, that she was going north to Camp Cooke, where she secured a job in a post exchange.\n\n1943\n\nElizabeth arrived at Camp Cooke on January 29, 1943. She found work in the post exchange, where Inez Keeling, the manager of the PX, said of her later, “I was won over all at once by her almost childlike charm and beauty. She was one of the loveliest girls I have ever seen- and the most shy.”\n\nAccording to an FBI memo, Elizabeth was an applicant for a clerk position at the post exchange at Camp Cooke on January 30, 1943. Ralph Aylesworth, manager of the PX, in an interview with author Mary Pacios, said Elizabeth Short “only worked a couple of weeks for me before she took off, not long after being chosen Camp Cutie.”\n\nP. O. Box 66\n\nElizabeth lived in a number of towns in the area over a brief period of time, including Lompoc, and Casmalia. Paul Veglia*, a twelve year old boy who lived at his father’s hotel, The Hitching Post in Casmalia, remembered seeing Beth every day for two months in the summer of 1943. She stayed in a cabin near the hotel and collected her mail at P. O. Box 66 at the local post office. He recalled seeing Beth in the hotel bar, where his mother was the bartender.\n\nBruno Zemaitis, founder and owner of Overland Security Services in Santa Maria, worked briefly on the murder in 1947. He said Beth was a frequent customer at the Snappy Lunch Diner at the corner of Broadway and Cook Streets, where his wife was a waitress.\n\nIt was in Santa Barbara, while living with Vera Green at 321-C West Montecito Street, that she was arrested on September 23, 1943 for “being a minor in a place that served liquor.” Mary Unkefer, Santa Barbara Police Department jail matron and the arresting officer, befriended Elizabeth. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that officer Unkefer let her stay with her in her home for nine days. The January 17, 1947 article quoted officer Unkefer as saying, “She was very good looking with beautiful dark hair and fair skin. She dressed nicely and was a long way from being a barfly.”\n\nBeth said she was married to one of the soldiers at her table, but it was untrue. When Officer Unkefer went to her home on West Montecito Street she found two soldiers in the apartment and her roommate Vera Green. Green said she was married to one of them, but that proved untrue, too. Green was married, but her husband was overseas.\n\nOfficer Unkefer also said she, “had a rose tattooed on her left leg. She loved to sit so that it would show.”\n\nIn October, she was put on a train by juvenile authorities and sent home to Medford. In a matter of weeks, she was in Florida again.\n\n* * *\n\nMiami Beach: The Rosedale, El Mar and Mammy’s\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles District Attorney files, Elizabeth was living in Miami Beach in 1943. She arrived at the peak of the Art Deco movement in the area. Hundreds of structures were built between 1923 and 1943, making the Art Deco District of Miami Beach the largest concentration of Deco architecture in the world. The city, which was incorporated in 1915, was also a leading beach resort destination.\n\nIn early December, 1943 Elizabeth worked at Big Dave’s Rosedale Delicatessen and Restaurant, Miami’s premier delicatessen, located at 1437 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach. The Rosedale was one of the first delicatessens that served Jewish-style fare in Miami. Washington Avenue was and is a busy shopping district, intersecting with Lincoln Road, a fashionable area during the 1940s. Soon after she worked there, the restaurant moved from Miami Beach to Miami. At the time, Elizabeth lived a little over half a mile away at the El Mar apartments at 220 21st Street.\n\nThe Roney Plaza (“Might I remind you Mr. Holiday, this ain’t the Roney Plaza.”: Alan Ladd, Box 13), the jewel of Miami Beach hotels, built in 1926, was located at 2301 Collins Avenue. It took up the entire block on Collins, between Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Streets. The hotel, at the north end of South Beach, faced the ocean and offered gracious accommodations for guests.\n\nThe Roney Plaza was just three blocks from Mammy’s restaurant (“Where the Stars Come Out at Night and Play Until Dawn”), where Elizabeth worked for Meyer Yedlin in the “latter part of 1944,” according to the D.A. Files. Mammy’s was located at 2039 Collins Avenue. Wolfie’s Restaurant was even closer to the El Mar, at 21st Street and Collins Avenue. It closed in 2001.\n\nIt was at the El Mar that Elizabeth received the inscrutable telegram from Washington, D.C. that read, “A promise is a promise to a person of the world.” The El Mar was a small apartment building with eight units. Mrs. Carmelita DeVaul was the manager.\n\nAccording to Joseph Gordon Fickling, he and Elizabeth met for the first time in Miami in 1943. He said they renewed their relationship in June, 1946 and she traveled to Long Beach California, where he was stationed, to meet him there in July.\n\nMiami Beach pioneer John S. Collins donated the land across the street from the El Mar for a permanent public park in 1914. The Park marks the beginning of South Beach’s boardwalk that extends to South Pointe Park, the southern tip of Miami Beach.\n\n1944\n\nIn March, 1944, Elizabeth was in Atlanta, Georgia, and in April she was back in Miami Beach, where in September, she met Gordon Fickling, a man she would live with in California. In November, she returned to Medford for Thanksgiving, but she was back in Miami in December, staying with Carmelita DeVaul at the El Mar. According to the District Attorney files, Elizabeth, “stayed in Florida during the winter months of 1944 and 1945, as she had been operated on for a lung condition and could not stand the cold winters in Mass.” On New Year’s Eve, 1944, she met Matt Gordon, the man she would later claim was her husband.\n\nTwo people stated she had been in Hollywood as early as 1944. In a Los Angeles Times newspaper article, Gordon Fickling, the boyfriend who lived with her in Long Beach and in Hollywood, said he met her in Southern California in 1944. Arthur Curtis James, Jr, a self-proclaimed artist, who claimed to have sketched her and painted her over a three month period, also said he knew her in Hollywood in 1944. According to a newspaper story, he said he met her in a cocktail lounge in Hollywood in August, 1944. James is quoted as saying, “I was sitting alone at the bar, making pencil sketches on a bit of paper, when a girl who turned out to be ‘Beth,’ sitting beside me, showed an interest in my sketches.”\n\nJames, who was also known as Charles B. Smith, was convicted of violation of the Mann act, after being arrested in November, 1944 in Tuscon, Arizona. His story remains largely unsubstantiated.\n\n1945\n\nOn August 22, Elizabeth was sent a telegram that told of the death of Matt Gordon, the pilot that she asserted was her husband. Word was sent from the young man’s mother, Mrs. Matt Gordon, Sr., who said, ” Just received word from War Department that Matt was killed in crash. Our deepest sympathy is with you.” Afterward, Elizabeth would carry a newspaper clipping of the incident with her, telling people she met that she was a widow.\n\nShe did not work from the latter part of 1944 until the first part of 1945. She was employed at St. Clair’s in Boston from March 30 until September 1, 1945. From late December, 1945 until January 9, 1946, she was registered at the Colonial Inn at 2104 Riverside Avenue in Jacksonville, Florida. Her mother sent her checks to the Jacksonville address. No employment records in Jacksonville could be found for her.\n\n1946\n\nBy the next month, February, Elizabeth was back in Medford with her mother. Beth worked in a theater and at several restaurants in Medford and Cambridge, before scheduling her next trip west. By June, she was on the move again. This time she was heading west. “The shipping records of her trunk were dated June 1, 1946,” according to the District Attorney memorandums.\n\nShe purchased a bus ticket to Indianapolis, and then it was on to Chicago, where she stayed at the Park Row Hotel from June 24 until July 12. She also stayed at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago with Jack Chernau.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Elizabeth became interested in the Suzanne Degnan murder. William Heirens, a young man from the area, was accused of killing the young girl and dismembering her body. The Los Angeles Examiner reported:\n\n“In Chicago, Freddie Woods, 23, who described himself as a “friend” of the slain girl, revealed that she was “fascinated” with the brutal slaying of six year-old Suzanne Degnan, which took place in Chicago a year ago.\n\nWoods said he met Miss Short last August when she was in Chicago for 10 days. She told him she was a Massachusetts reporter covering the trial of William Heirens, who was convicted of the Degnan kidnaping and slaying.”\n\n“Elizabeth Short was one of the prettiest girls I ever met,” Woods said. “But she was terribly preoccupied with the details of the Degnan murder.”\n\n* * *\n\nLater, she continued west to California and Gordon Fickling, who picked her up at the bus depot in Long Beach. She checked into the Washington Hotel on Linden and stayed there from July 22 until August 3. While there, she became a regular customer at Lander’s drugstore on the corner, attracting men in uniform, just as she would all across the country. In an interview, David Landers said, “she was very popular with the men who visited the soda fountain and they got to calling her ‘The Black Dahlia,’ partly because of her clothes and partly because of the flowerlike arrangement of her jet black hair.”\n\nWhen Elizabeth moved out of her hotel room in Long Beach, acquaintances described her as “radiant.” She told them that she was planning to marry an army officer. Days later, witnesses said she boarded a Pacific Electric streetcar to Hollywood. Investigators believed she lived at the Sunset Motel on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood for about a week in August.\n\n*Thanks to Steve Hodel and his interview with Paul Veglia in 2017.\n\n“I walk along the street of sorrow, the Boulevard of Broken Dreams”\n\n-Al Dubin & Harry Warren\n\nIn the 1940’s, there were the high class night spots and restaurants, like the Brown Derby, the Jade and the Cinegrill. And there were the working man’s bars, such as Steve Boardner’s, Bradley’s 5 and 10 and Jack O’Brien’s. Hollywood was a lonely town for transplants and runaways, but it was easy to get lost in if you joined the bar scene. For Beth Short, who preferred soft drinks over alcohol, Hollywood was a place to meet people and maybe make a future for herself.\n\n* * *\n\nIt was the era of live radio programs and motion pictures. The NBC Radio City studios were at Sunset at Vine, while down the street, CBS broadcast from Columbia Square. There were night spots all along Vine Street, from Clara Bow’s It Cafe, the Brown Derby, Club Morocco and the Hangover to Tom Breneman’s Breakfast in Hollywood and many more. There were nightclubs with floor shows and live entertainment. The Palladium, sandwiched between NBC and CBS, was just across from Earl Carroll’s Theatre on Sunset. The Florentine Gardens was Blocks away on Hollywood Boulevard, and, of course the Sunset Strip was a taxi ride away, with clubs like Ciro’s and the Trocadero.\n\nIt was an exciting time and an exciting town. In 1946, five of the top records on the hit parade were different versions of “To Each His Own.” Movie audiences were treated to a banner year of films, such as “The Best Years of Our Lives,” “Blue Skies,” “It’s a Wonderful Life,” and “The Harvey Girls.”\n\nThat year, Nino Frank, a French film critic, dubbed a new style of movie making as “film noir.” 1946 saw the release of such noir titles as, “Gilda,” “The Big Sleep,” “The Postman Always Rings Twice” and a film that had a personal meaning for Elizabeth Short, Raymond Chandler’s, “The Blue Dahlia,” which opened at the Paramount Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard on July 4.\n\n* * *\n\nHollywood was a town dotted with motion picture and radio studios, a town where people rode street cars to the San Fernando Valley or to the seashore or up and down Hollywood Boulevard. There were safety islands for passengers and tunnels under the Boulevard for pedestrians. There were newsboys hawking the daily newspapers at every major street corner and there was a movie theater on nearly every block. You could walk up and down the Boulevard and stare into the faces of strangers and never make a friend. Elizabeth Short fit in. She wandered the streets of Hollywood and spent hours in the restaurants and cocktail bars, but she was never discovered by the studios. Her fame would come after death. She arrived in Hollywood after the Academy Awards presentation at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre on March 7, 1946 and was dead before the Academy Awards show at the Shine Auditorium on March 13, 1947.\n\nShe became as famous and as intriguing as the movie stars who helped put Hollywood on the map. She never made a movie, never made a name for herself in life, but in death, the beautiful, mysterious, young woman of 22 became a legend. Her story is the tale of a town and a gypsy girl who passed through it and left her signature, not in Grauman’s forecourt, but in Hollywood lore itself.\n\nThe town that grew up in the 1920’s and 1930’s with glamorous nightclubs on Hollywood Boulevard was a town where movie stars, such as Rudolph Valentino and Charlie Chaplin, ate at Musso and Frank, where actors lived in the Hotel Hollywood and the Garden Court Apartments. It was the town where Carole Lombard and Joan Crawford made names for themselves dancing in Hollywood night spots. Years later, Hollywood would turn into a haven for prostitutes, drug addicts and the homeless.\n\nBut in 1946, Hollywood was doing just fine, with films and radio production creating magic for the rest of the world. Bing Crosby’s Philco Radio Time introduced audiences to the first prerecorded broadcast on a prime time radio network. Television was just around the corner.\n\nElizabeth Short arrived in Southern California in July, 1946. She turned 22 years old on July 29. The most popular song that summer was “To Each His Own,” a tune from the movie of the same title, starring Olivia de Havilland.\n\nThe Eddy Howard recording of “To Each His Own” entered the Billboard Charts on July 11, 1946, and would stay on the hit parade for nineteen weeks. The song was so popular that four other versions also stayed on the charts through the summer. Tony Martin, the Ink Spots, Freddy Martin and the Modernaires with Paula Kelly all had hit recordings.\n\nA rose must remain with the sun and the rain\n\nOr its lovely promise won’t come true\n\nTo each his own, to each his own\n\nAnd my own is you\n\nThe war years had been tough on almost everyone. By 1946, annual incomes averaged $2,390. A new house cost about $5,600 and a new car about $1,200. A postage stamp was three cents, a loaf of bread costs nine cents, a dozen eggs was twenty-two cents, a pound of coffee cost fifty cents, and a gallon of milk was seventy cents. If you had a new Roosevelt dime and a Jefferson nickel in your pocket, you could buy a gallon of gas or go see the new Clark Gable movie. The nickel was mighty. A telephone call costs a nickel in a phone booth. A newspaper costs a nickel and any greasy spoon in town served coffee for a nickel. Coca Cola guaranteed every man a in uniform a bottle of Coke for five cents. You could ride public transportation or buy a candy bar for a nickel. Or you could buy a short beer at Bradley’s 5 and 10, a Hollywood Boulevard hangout known to Beth Short.\n\n* * *\n\nIn many ways, the Hollywood Boulevard of today does not look that different from the Hollywood Boulevard of 1946. Many of the structures built in the 1920’s and 1930’s still line the street. Some of the businesses remain, most notably, the Musso and Frank Grill, between Las Palmas and Cherokee, which has served customers continuously since 1919. Grauman’s Chinese Theatre at the west end of the Boulevard and the Pantages Theatre at the east end still operate. The Roosevelt Hotel is open, The Snow White Waffle House, now the Snow White cafe, is still in business. The Hillview Apartments is renting again, after a major renovation. Decades after being hidden, the Kress department store sign has been restored and rises high above Hollywood Boulevard at Whitley. The Broadway Hollywood, no longer a department store, still proudly displays it’s original sign. Across the street, with its blue neon sign still in tact, sits the venerable Taft Building. Across the Boulevard on the north side, the Frolic Room, a neighborhood bar since the 1930’s, is still open for business.\n\nWhat has changed then? Well, the streetcars are long gone, including their rails and electrified catenary systems. The newsboys have disappeared from all the major street corners. The five and dime stores, such as S. H. Kress, J. J. Newberry and F.W. Woolworth, are gone, although the buildings remain. The drugstores at Highland, Cherokee, Hudson and Vine, with their lunch counters, have vanished. Bradley’s Five and Ten, where Steve Boardner said Elizabeth Short was a patron, was torn down long ago. It was located at the northwest corner of Hollywood and Cherokee, a block and a half from the Chancellor apartments, Where Elizabeth briefly shared a room with other young women.\n\nThe Walk of Fame replaced the more conventional cement sidewalk in the early 1960’s and trees now line the north and south side of Hollywood Boulevard. Larry Edmunds Book Store moved from Cahuenga to Hollywood Boulevard during the intervening years. The old Hollywood Typewriter Shop, Miller’s Stationers and Pickwick Book Shop are gone, as well as C. C. Brown, home of the hot fudge sundae.\n\nAnd of course, people don’t look the same these days. They carry more weight and wear less clothing. Their manners and demeanor have changed. A well dressed woman like Elizabeth Short always stood out from the crowd, but today she might even seem out of place.\n\nJust as Elizabeth Short would not recognize Hollywood today, we would not recognize her Hollywood either.\n\n* * *\n\nOnce, there were frequent premiers at the first run theaters, where locals and tourists sat in the bleachers and watched their favorite stars step out of limousines and into lavish theater palaces. Today, that sight is rare. Movie-goers in the 1940’s, had many choices of theaters on Hollywood Boulevard. Most have vanished, but once there were more than a dozen. Gone is the Hollywood Music Hall at Hudson, the Admiral at Vine, the Iris at Wilcox, the Hollywood at Highland, the Fox at Gower, the Marcal, just west of the Florentine Gardens and the Hawaii, just east of the Gardens. The News-View, a single aisle newsreel theater was between Las Palmas and Cherokee. The Vogue was across the street, next door to the Musso and Frank Grill. The Hunley, the Apollo, the Hitching Post, the Warner, are all dark or razed. Today, the only theaters showing movies on Hollywood Boulevard are the Chinese, the El Capitan and the Egyptian.\n\nElizabeth Short might have seen “The Strange Woman” with Hedy Lamarr at the Hawaii, or “Missing Lady” at the Mayfair. or “A Game of Death at the Marcal. A happier choice might have been “It’s a Wonderful Life” at the Pantages.\n\n* * *\n\nIf a flame is to grow there must be a glow\n\nTo open every door there’s a key\n\nI need you, I know, I can’t let you go\n\nYour touch means too much to me\n\n* * *\n\nIn Long Beach, Beth would eat breakfast at a favorite drug store near her hotel. She met a man, Bob Robertson and his friend there. The two had been in the service together and were visiting California from Boise, Idaho.\n\nRobertson recalled that, “She was a nice looking girl and smiled at us and we had breakfast together in the drug store and then we went back to the room and then went to the beach. I don’t know where she went. And then we would have breakfast with her every morning and walked to the beach a couple of times in the afternoon. One night she said she would like to go to the Palladium dancing and we got the P.E. train and went to Hollywood in the afternoon and spent the day dancing and came back that night and probably got home about 2:30 or 3:00.”\n\nWhile in Hollywood, they visited the tourists spots, including the Chinese Theatre on Hollywood boulevard and the NBC Radio City studios at Sunset and Vine. They danced at the Palladium and she posed for a snapshot across the street outside the Earl Carroll Theatre, beneath the sign that read, “The most beautiful girls in the world.”\n\nAfter the two men returned to Boise, Beth wrote a few times and included the photos or negatives from the Hollywood trip. She eventually stopped writing, the man said, and then one day his friend “came dashing to the house,” saying, “Do you remember that girl we met in California, in Long Beach? She’s been murdered.”\n\n* * *\n\n“Meet me at Hollywood and Vine,” a catch phrase made popular during the radio era, was widely used by locals and tourists during the brief time that Beth Short was in Hollywood. Linda Rohr, a roommate at the Chancellor said, “She loved to prowl the Boulevard.” She frequented Tom Breneman’s on Vine, where the waiters knew her and she went to the Frolic Room and the Italian Kitchen in the Pantages Building, next to the theater.\n\nBeth was a regular at the CBS radio studios on Sunset near Vine. John Egger, the head usher at CBS said he saw her there, “at least twenty times.” Anne Toth said Beth used to go to NBC at Sunset and Vine “all the time.”\n\n* * *\n\nAfter Thanksgiving, the Boulevard dressed for Christmas with lights and decorations. Shops stayed open later at night and Bing Crosby could be heard singing White Christmas again. It was a festive time, but by early December, a frightened 22 year old Elizabeth Short decided it was time to get out of Hollywood.\n\nAccording to William Fowler, the doorman at the Pantages Theatre at Hollywood and Vine, Beth walked by often.\n\n“The Jolson Story” was playing at the Pantages and Beth would walk by and say hello occasionally. William described her as a, “Very attractive girl, the way she dressed.” He said she had, “Very dark black hair. Looked like it was dyed black and rather full.”\n\n“I was working as doorman, but I was in front of the box office. I had a mike in my hand. I believe it was a Friday night. She walked [by] and there was a kind of a lull, everything quieted down. I believe the stores had just closed and she stated, ‘You have quite a crowd, haven’t you?’ and I said, ‘Yes, we have quite a crowd’ and she says, ‘A pretty good picture?’ and I had seen it about thirty times and I said, ‘Yes, it’s a good picture.’ That was the last I ever saw of her.”\n\nHe remembered seeing her about five or six times in all. “It was some time around the first of December. Christmas shopping, Christmas rush. I don’t believe I saw her after that.”\n\nBefore long, Beth was in San Diego, watching “The Jolson Story” at the Aztec Theatre.\n\nBeth was frequently in hot water with Mark. He would throw her out and then let her back in. Shortly before her death, Anne said Mark told her that he was going to allow Beth to return for a few days when she got back from San Diego.\n\n* * *\n\nMark Hansen’s modest home at 6024 Carlos Avenue was a block north of Hollywood Boulevard, behind the Marcal Theatre. It was also home to aspiring actresses and young girls who were down on their luck, as well as Hansen’s friend, Anne Toth.\n\nCarlos Avenue, between Gower Street on the west and Bronson Avenue on the east, was situated one block north of the hustle and bustle of Hollywood Boulevard and a string of theaters, including Hansen’s Marcal and the Florentine Gardens. By fall of 1946, the Marcal had shown Howard Hughes’ The Outlaw, starring Jane Russell, for eight months. It was predicted that the Marcal would break all attendance records across the country.\n\nDown the street was the Hawaii Theatre, a movie house with a tropical theme. Carlos was a residential street with the sprawling First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood on the north east corner. Along the south side were six or eight or more bungalows, set back from the sidewalk. They were single story, unpretentious homes with front porches and lap siding exteriors. Hansen’s house was a couple of doors from La Baig Avenue, a street that ran south from Franklin Avenue and dead-ended at Carlos. Further to the east was Tamarind Avenue and after that Bronson Avenue. Mark Hansen’s home was on a quiet street, just a block from the action of Hollywood Boulevard, and easily accessible through a gate in his back yard that lead to the parking lot behind the Marcal Theatre.\n\nAnne Toth lived there while she pursued her modeling and acting career. Her boyfriend, Leo Hymes, was a friend of Mark Hansen, and according to Anne, she was the one girl that was not approached by Hansen. Anne said that Mark moved in on all the girls that stayed at his house, “-every one, outside of myself.” She was asked by investigators what happened if he was turned down. “Out they go,” Anne replied. She also said that Mark Hansen discovered that Beth was a virgin, “so he didn’t want to bother with her.”\n\nInvestigators determined that the girls that lived at Hansen’s home “were financially embarrassed at the time they were living there.” Anne was unaware whether any of them paid rent. Sergeant Finis Brown said he couldn’t determine if the girls were paying rent or not. “As far as I know, I couldn’t state. Some say they were and some say they weren’t.”\n\nBesides Beth and Anne, some of the other girls that Mark allowed in his home were Connie Starr, Rosalind Kingston, Lola Titus, Marjorie Graham, a girl known only as Barbara, another named Cecile, as well as other unidentified young women. Anne’s boyfriend, Leo Hymes, looked at photographs of Carol Fisher and Sara Lee Testa, two former “Camp Cooke Cuties,” and said he might have seen them at Mark’s home.\n\nThe men who visited the Carlos Avenue home included, Leo Hymes and Marvin Margolis, the man that Beth called her cousin. Finis Brown felt Margolis was still a good suspect in 1949. He said Margolis, “was interrogated at first, but it was not – there was nothing to tie him to the case at that time other than being a medical student. He could possibly be a very good suspect.” By then, Margolis was living in Chicago.\n\nAnne said that Beth got in trouble with Mark one day when she had an argument with another girl who worked in pictures. Mark told Beth to leave. Anne’s boyfriend, Leo Hymes, recalled that, “This short girl wanted to chase that other girl out of the house.”\n\n“I walked in there at that particular time. We were going out to eat and Mark -the argument was over but you could tell, the atmosphere – Anne told me, ‘you remember that girl. She really let her have it then. Wasn’ t there – she was a little short girl. Ann told me, ‘You remember that girl. She was that little short girl that used to come over there all the time; little stocky girl, blonde.’ I could be off on that but that was the story on it at the time.”\n\nAs for Beth, Leo said, “-I don’t think he had anything to do with that girl.” Investigators asked him if Hansen said anything that would indicate that. “Oh, I guess it is just- Anne told me- second-hand information, but it is just a strange thing about that setup there. I don’t know, she – naturally I’d kid Mark about it at different times, but I’d never see her there enough to get to know her. The few times I did see her – Mark said he never had anything to do with that girl; it just so happens it is one time I believe him”\n\nAnother time, Hansen found out that Beth had made a long distance call and left him to pay the bill. Leo said, “She called somebody down in Texas, an army camp or somewhere it seems to me. Anne was telling me about it, because – I came over there the early part of the afternoon and I never did see that Short gal around there very much – she was gone. In fact, I think she said Mark told her she worked for the T.W.A. T.W.A., that’s why I think that Biltmore came into the thing, but he was pretty hot about a phone call. He must have found it on his bill; he must have caught her in a lie – she must have said she didn’t call or send a wire collect or something like that. I know he was upset about it. I don’t believe I ever saw her around there in the daytime, except twice. She would leave there and – went to work.”\n\n“As far as I am concerned, I think she sought more refuge with Mark and myself than anybody but I don’t know all the conversation and I think if she had more encouragement from Mark to come back, she would have come back in a minute, if he would have asked her,” Anne said.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1949, when Lola Titus shot Hansen, that investigators were finally able to conduct a search of the Carlos Avenue house. Finis Brown said, “Jones of the Crime Lab went over the whole house, checked for blood in other rooms. During the time that I went out there, I have checked myself, the various rooms, when the opportunity presented itself, to check bathroom and such.” When asked by investigators why such a search was made, Brown replied, “Connected with death of Elizabeth Short, if any possibility that it could have been committed there. “Brown also said, “I talked to Lola Titus and from what I could gather the girl talks in riddles. She is – she told me that she didn’t know the Short girl at all.”\n\nBrown also said he found two pictures of Beth in Mark Hansen’s home. “There was a photograph of the Santa Barbara photograph, and another one taken by a boy named Glenn Sterns.” Brown further said that listening devices were installed in the Carlos Avenue home from roughly March to October, 1947, under the direction of Chief of Police Horrall.\n\n* * *\n\nMark Hansen was a family man, but he was separated from his wife and daughters during the time he lived in the Carlos Avenue house. In July, 1949, he moved back with his family on Canyon Drive in the Hollywood Hills. Mark and Anne kept in touch with each other for years after the murder.\n\nOn October 22, Glen Kearns, who lived at 2332 Gale Street, drove Beth around town all night looking for a place to stay . The next day, he dropped her off at Mark Hansen’s house.\n\n* * *\n\nMark Marinus Hansen was born in Aalborg, Denmark on July 25, 1890 and moved to the United States in 1919, where he settled in Scobey, Montana. He bought a theater in Scobey and later moved to Williston, North Dakota, where he bought two more theaters. He moved to Minnesota for about nine months where he was also engaged in the theater business. In 1921, Hansen relocated to Los Angeles. He lived at Melrose and Larchmont and owned the Larchmont Theatre. He also had a theater in Whittier, one in San Pedro, one in Walnut Park, three in Oxnard and three in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1926, Hansen built the Marcal Theatre as a playhouse. He moved to 6024 Carlos Avenue in Hollywood in the mid 1930.’s. He and his wife separated from each other in the mid 1940’s and she remained in their home in Los Angeles with their daughters.\n\nWhen he knew Elizabeth Short in the 1940’s, Mark Hansen was a Hollywood resident and a successful businessman. At the time, he was described as 55 years old, 5′ 9′, 175 lb, with graying hair and an accent. He walked with measured steps and was somewhat stoop shouldered.\n\nHansen owned at least two other dwellings, one at 6048 Hollywood Boulevard and another at 1771 Van Ness Avenue. He was part owner of the Florentine Gardens, a successful nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard. He and silent screen actress Alice Calhoun built the Marcal Theatre on the same block at 6025 Hollywood Boulevard in 1925.\n\nHansen’s friend, actress Anne Toth, lived with him off and on at the house on Carlos Avenue. Beth Short also stayed at Hansen’s house for two weeks in October and ten days in November, 1946.\n\nAnne told investigators that Mark Hansen “really liked her, he had a yen for her,” but when interviewed, he acted as if he had no interest in her. When asked if she was a sexy-type girl,” Hansen replied, “Well, I don’t know if she was sexy-type girl. She appeared to be a very nice girl.” He also said, “she appeared to be a more domestic type girl.”\n\nHansen said, “Well, I thought she was fair looking, average. If it wasn’t for her teeth. She had bad teeth. Other than that she would have been beautiful.”\n\nInspector Jemison’s report says, “Anne and her friend Leo Hymes state that Mark was crazy about her and jealous of her, that he is a man who must have what he wants.”\n\nLt. Jemison’s report also states, that Beth “told Anne Toth that Mark was trying to make her, that he was jealous so she had to leave boyfriends at the corner so he wouldn’t see them.”\n\nHansen apparently liked Beth, although he played down his interest in her. He had one of his tenants, “who was in the dressmaking business,” according to Jemison, make two dresses for her “which she fitted and made, but never delivered to the victim.”\n\n* * *\n\nSyd Zaid let the two girls stay at his home on Windsor Road. Around the last day in September, he introduced them to Mark Hansen at the Florentine Gardens. He told Hansen he didn’t have enough room at his place and asked if Mark could put them up at his home. Hansen agreed and Zaid drove them to the Carlos house in early October. They stayed, “Perhaps about a week or ten days; something like that,” Hansen said. After awhile, he asked them to leave, “- because this Graham girl, she was inclined to be liquored up and I didn’t like it at all; and this Short girl, she had always some undesirable looking character waiting for her outside and bringing her home.”\n\nAnne said, “Well, Marjorie drank up all of Mark’s liquor, so he kicked her out, so out Betty went too. I don’t blame him.” After they left, Hansen said he believed they moved into the Guardian Arms with Bill Robinson and Marvin Margolis.\n\nMargie’s boy friend was Bill Robinson, a U.S.C. student who had been in the navy. Anne said, Beth “was keeping company with a supposedly cousin of hers, if I can remember his name.” When Jemison asked her if it was Marvin Margolis, Anne replied, “Um-hum.” Margolis was also a U.S.C. student, studying to be a chiropractor.\n\nBeth and Marvin both told Mark that he, Margolis, was her cousin, Hansen said. After Beth and Marjorie moved out, they came back a few times. “-they came over there one day and say they want to leave town; they were going to go east and this cousin, he was along with them- this Margolis. They visited with Anne and then later on this Graham girl came over one night. I wasn’t home, but she was sitting, eating dinner, and she was sitting eating dinner and crying.”\n\n“The next day he came around there and carried the suitcase up and I says, ‘What’s this?’ He says, ‘Can she leave this here overnight? She’s going away tomorrow and would like to leave these until tomorrow.'” Hansen said he agreed, but, “That night I come home Beth Short was there.”\n\n“I said, “I thought you were just going to leave your suitcases, and she said, ‘I didn’t have no place to stay.’ Would I mind if she stayed. She kept staying and staying. Then she moved over to the Chancellor Apartment. Then it was after that one night she was sitting and crying about being scared – one thing and another, I don’t know. She said she was going to Oakland to a sister. Well, from there she wanted to know if she couldn’t come back there when she came from Oakland. She said she was scared.”\n\n* * *\n\nUnknown to Hansen, Anne found an apartment for Beth at the Chancellor after Hansen asked her to leave the second time. She came back to visit Mark and Anne later, telling them that she didn’t like living at the Chancellor. “I felt sorry for her. She said there was bad company over there and she couldn’t stand it,” Hansen said. He gave Beth a ride home to her apartment, dropping her off outside.\n\nThat was the last time he saw her, Hansen said. “She say she was going to Oakland during the holidays with her sister. When she comes back she says she would call me to see if I changed my mind, to see if she would stay at the house.”\n\n“I never saw her again.”\n\n* * *\n\nOn January 25, 1947, authorities interviewed Mark in his home in the presence of Anne Toth. He denied dating Beth.\n\n“Several girls have rented rooms here at the house, but I never went out with them. She had lots of dates. There was a language teacher that I know of, and with other persons, mostly hoodlums whom I wouldn’t even let in my house.”\n\nHe said that the address book that was recovered by postal authorities belonged to him. He also indicated that another memorandum and calendar book was missing. “I believe Miss Short stole that, too,” Hansen said.\n\nAnne objected to Hansen’s depiction of Beth, saying, “She was a nice girl. She was quiet, she didn’t drink and she didn’t smoke and we ought to look on the good side of people.”\n\nSgt. Finis Brown was interviewed during the grand jury investigation about photographs of Elizabeth Short that were in Mark Hansen’s home. According to Brown, Hansen said he got the photos from an officer when a girl told him that she knew Beth. He said the girl told him that she “knew Elizabeth Short and gave him some information about her being at the Hal Browning Hotel -.” Hansen wanted the photos to show the girl “to see if she could identify her,” he said.\n\n* * *\n\nIn 1949, Lola Titus shot Mark Hansen while he was shaving in the bathroom of his Carlos Avenue home. Lola, aka Beverly Alice Bennett and “The Lady in Gold,” was a 25 year old blond taxi dancer, The bullet pierced a lung and missed his heart by 7/10 of an inch and was later found embedded in the wall. Lola said afterwards, “I made up my mind that he was either going to love me, marry me or take care of me or I was going to kill him.” In the D.A. investigation Lola was described as a, “Friend of Short. Never thoroughly quizzed.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe Carlos Avenue house was razed years ago. The Marcal Theatre became the World Theatre in 1963. It since closed. The Florentine Gardens is still a nightclub and is still open for business.\n\nMark Hansen died on June 14, 1964. His wife Ida died ten years later in 1974. Their ashes rest in the Hansen niche in the Hollywood Memorial Cemetery, one mile from Carlos Avenue.\n\nAs summer turned into fall in 1946, Elizabeth Short was becoming known around Hollywood. The war was over, and returning soldiers and sailors filled the streets and bars of Hollywood. Elizabeth, or Beth, as she now referred to herself, liked men in uniform and she began to spend a lot of time in bars.\n\nBeth met many men and women during her brief time in town, but none of the friendships appeared to be close. She knew Lynne and Margie, but it was actress and model Anne Toth, described by newspapers as 24 years old, that was perhaps her truest friend.\n\nAnne worked on the Charlie Chaplin film Monsieur Verdoux and the Merle Oberon movie Temptation, which was released in early December, 1946. She also had a small part in the Susan Hayward film, Smash-Up, which featured Anne in the trailer. Smash-Up was released in the United States in March, 1947.\n\nAnne first met Beth in Mark Hansen’s home after she returned from a trip to San Diego. Hansen owned the Marcal Theatre near by, as well as other properties around town, including his home on Carlos Avenue, behind his theater. He allowed showgirls and young women, who were down on their luck, to stay at his home. His own estranged wife and daughters lived nearby in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nWhen Anne came home one day, Beth and Mark were there. That was the first time the two girls met, Anne said.\n\nOver time, Anne said Mark Hansen and Elizabeth Short were going together. Investigators asked Anne, “-did she want him to think he was going steady with her?” Anne replied, “Yes.” She agreed with investigators that asked if Hansen “was kind of carrying the torch for her at that time.” But the two fought with each other, too, she said.\n\nWell, she cleaned up his bathroom for him and threw out a number of things, you know, set them out, empty bottles and things that he didn’t have any use for, but then he got awful damn mad about that. So I told him he should be thankful somebody wanted to clean it up for him. He said “I would rather leave the damn things alone and she leave my things alone. For a week he carried on about it.“\n\nLAPD Officer Ed Barrett asked, “Anne do you think Beth was afraid of Mark?” “Yes, I do,” she answered. “She never said much around him. As a matter of fact, she , she was – seemed afraid to tell me anything because I think she thought that I was in cahoots with him, I think, that I might say something to him. That is probably why I didn’t find out half as much as I should have.”\n\nWhen Anne was asked if Hansen ever hit Beth, she replied, “Well, I don’t know if he did or not.” She went on to say, “Of course, maybe she was afraid to say anything because she had a feeling I was on Mark’s side, I would probably tell him. Actually, I was just living there, I was just an innocent standbyer. My friend and Mark were very good friends, they used to – he used to visit with Mark. They were pretty good buddies, so he was always around there, so he couldn’t get too rough with me. I don’t think he would of if he could, because we are both of the same nationality, I can be just as mean as he can get, so -”\n\nAnne, who is often portrayed as Hansen’s girl friend, had her own boy friend, Leo Hymes. Authorities described Leo as a, “heavy set fellow [with a] birthmark on his nose.” Anne said she wasn’t always privy to all the goings-on at the Carlos Avenue house, because she was spending time with Leo. She also said she was not a friend of Beth’s socially. They didn’t go out together or frequent the same spots at the same time.\n\nBeth moved out of Hansen’s place on October 22, but she was back at his home on October 23. Anne said that Hansen allowed Beth to “come back in, and I think at that time, I think, she placed a long distance telephone call to Texas, to this Fickling, and I think that sort of — she charged it on his telephone bill, and I don’t think she told him about it. That is one of the things too, he wanted her to — then of course, I think she paid for it later, and then he let her come back in later and she had a place to stay, without Margie of course.”\n\nAnne said that Beth told her that Hansen was trying to “make her” “a couple of times,” but that Beth lead him to believe that she was a virgin. After that, according to Anne, he didn’t bother her again. She continued to see other men, but they were not allowed to to visit her at the Carlos address.\n\nAnne indicated that Beth moved out of Hansen’s home about November 13, 1946, after an argument with another of Hansen’s girls. Anne said Beth “was planning to stay for the evening and, of course, as Mark told Betty that he was going with her and she was going with him and vice versa. In the meantime, he was having other girls come over there, and I imagine he was trying to romance her or something. Well, anyway, Betty came along –.” The other girl was upset. “Well, anyway, Betty got out of bed, she was sleeping with me, and insisted that this tramp go home.”\n\nThe other girl told Beth to go home to her mother where she belonged, according to Anne. The girl continued to insist Beth leave. Anne said she “had a lot of high ideas, that Betty, believe me, with her Boston family and all that stuff, and she got up and locked her suitcase, and she said, ‘I don’t want to touch your damn suitcase, I don’t want anything in there.’ Anyway, words were flying back and forth and there was almost a beef and a fist fight, and Mark stepped in between them and he ordered Betty to move the next day. She was right though, I’ll tell you that.”\n\n* * *\n\nBut it was Anne that looked out for Beth and tried to help her. It was Anne that lent her the coat that she was last seen wearing at the Biltmore on the evening of January 9, 1947. It was Anne that found her a place to stay at the Chancellor of Hollywood and paid her first week’s rent when Mark Hansen threw her out of his home. It was Anne that helped her move, and Anne that took her mail to her and it was Anne who said kind things about her.\n\nAnne talked about how Hansen once drove Beth home to the Chancellor without knowing Anne found the apartment for her.\n\nHe didn’t know that she lived at the apartment there, because I was the one that got it for her, and he was amazed, he didn’t know what had happened to her, where she had gone or what had happened. I didn’t say anything.\n\nI borrowed a car to move her and everything and I never told him. He would have probably gotten pretty sore at me, so I didn’t tell him that I knew she was living there, because I had been there to visit her, and he drove her home.\n\nAnne defended Beth when others didn’t:\n\nIn the first place, she didn’t drink, she didn’t smoke, because after all, living with her, I knew, and she always came in at a decent hour, 11 o’clock, or around there. She never came in later than that, and naturally if she was supposed to be sexy and do other stuff, there is a lot more that goes to it, rather than if a decent girl – there is drinking, smoking, wining and dining, and a few other things that go with it. I don’t think she was trying to be sexy – in a very innocent way\n\n* * *\n\nAnne was questioned by the Los Angeles Police Department shortly after the murder. She and Mark went to see homicide detectives as soon as they heard that authorities were looking for an “Anne Todd.”\n\nA document from the district attorney files, says in part:\n\n“On January 16, 1947, after investigating officers had received information that Elizabeth Short had a friend, supposedly by the name of Anne Todd, they attempted to locate this person. At approximately 11:00 a.m., officers received a telephone call from Anne Toth, who stated she was a friend of Elizabeth Short and was living at 6024 Carlos Street and that Elizabeth Short lived there with her, and that she was probably the friend referred to as Anne Todd. She appeared at the office of the Homicide Detail with Mark Hanson shortly after noon of the 16th. At that time she gave an account of meeting Elizabeth Short; that Elizabeth Short had lived at the address on two occasions where she was living and where she moved. Most of the names she could think of were friends of Elizabeth Short.\n\n“Mark Hanson [sic] verified her statements at that time, but declined to talk where there was any chance of newspaper reporters being present, or any chance of any publicity. When Mark Hanson and Anne Toth came into the office there were approximately twenty reporters and photographers in the office. Anne Toth identified herself and was photographed and talked to by news reporters. Hanson, on being asked his identity by reporters, stated he was nobody — he was merely her [Anne’s] chauffeur.”\n\nAnother time, Anne remarked to D.A. investigators that Mark didn’t want his name mentioned. “Well, he used to get provoked at me about mentioning his name, he, at that time, to the papers, and one thing and another, which I didn’t. Only they found the address book and, of course, they got his name, but I didn’t mention his name or anything.”\n\nAnne was interviewed twice by investigators for the grand jury. She made it known that she did not want publicity. She telephoned Sgt. Finis Brown in 1949 to ask if two men who contacted her were actually from the police department, as they had indicated. When Anne told Brown their names were Waggoner and Ahern, Brown told her to “go ahead and talk with them.” Brown said Anne told him, “I have a lot of adverse publicity in this case and I don’t want to take any chances – .”\n\nAnother time, when Anne gave her telephone number to Lt. Frank Jemison during questioning, she asked, “None of this will be in the paper, will it?”\n\nLater, Jemison asked, “Everything that you are telling us can be used confidentially, of course, in our secret files?” Anne replied, “I insist it be that way.”\n\nAfter the grand jury disbanded at the end of the year, the active investigation of the murder of Elizabeth Short began a descent that led to cold case oblivion. The last known time that investigators interviewed Anne was in 1950.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nElizabeth Short\n\nHollywood has always been a small town to those who live there. Seems you always run into someone you know when you’re walking down Hollywood Boulevard or sitting in a coffee shop.\n\n* * *\n\nCarpenter’s\n\nIn the 1940’s, Carpenter’s was a popular drive-in restaurant in Hollywood, located at the five points, where Hollywood Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Virgil Avenue, Hillhurst Avenue and Sunset Drive all converge. One in a chain of four drive-ins, this Carpenter’s sat on the southeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Virgil Avenue, where locals stopped for a soda or a sandwich.\n\nYou could stay in your car or dine inside. The building was circular in design so automobiles could park facing the restaurant and drivers and passengers could order from car hops, who would bring your order on a tray to the window. Inside, you could order from the counter man, dressed in white and wearing a paper hat. There were stools where you could sit down and order coffee, or fried chicken.\n\nBob Granas would ditch classes at Marshall High School occasionally and drop by Carpenter’s. He would go inside and order a milk shake and French fries or sometimes stay in his car and smoke a cigarette.\n\nArt Richman, George Bacos and Bob Granas, were students at Marshall High School during the war and were regulars at Carpenter’s. Lynn Martin, Margie Graham and Beth Short also frequented the drive-in. The five points was a busy intersection and Carpenter’s was a popular stop.\n\nArt, whose father ran an auto wrecking yard on San Fernando Road, met Lynn one day when he was driving around in Hollywood and picked her up. Later, he introduced Lynn and Margie to Bob. George Bacos recalled meeting Lynn and Margie through Bob at Carpenter’s. Bob didn’t know Beth, but George did. He said he met her at Carpenter’s.\n\nOne evening when he was late for a date with Lynn, George went to her apartment at the Guardian on Hollywood Boulevard. Lynn was gone and Beth was home alone. He had tickets for a radio show, and since Lynn was not around, he invited Beth to the program instead. They were too late to get in, so George drove out to the Strip and up into the hills, where they parked and talked. He was dating Lynn, he said later, and was not interested in Beth.\n\n“I didn’t want to kiss her because of all that ‘goop’ she used on her face. I’m used to nice, cultured girls.”\n\nWhen he was shown a photo of her after the murder, George said, “Yeah, that is a pretty good picture of her. Looks a lot softer there than she usually does. She looked pretty hard.”\n\nGeorge said, “Lynn seemed to be a nice girl. She was quieter; not as flashy.” He had a brief sexual affair with her, unaware, until after the murder, that she was underage, he said.\n\nJohn Egger, the head usher at CBS on Sunset boulevard, knew George when George was head usher at NBC, down the street. George said he worked at NBC for about a year in 1944 and 1945. John said, “I don’t like him very well. He is very conceited; I just don’t care for him myself. Never very close to him, just speaking acquaintance.”\n\nBrittingham’s\n\nBritt’s, as locals called Brittingham’s Radio Center Restaurant in Columbia Square, was a hangout for the employees of the radio studios. Egger said, “Bacos would be seen quite often in the Brittingham restaurant cocktail bar, it is right in front of C.B.S., everybody would gather there after work – Bacos would be there quite often.”\n\nJohn Egger recognized Beth from the times when she would wait in the CBS courtyard to see a radio broadcast. George Bacos also knew Beth from Britt”s. “That used to be my hangout – Brittingham’s Restaurant,” George said. “I’d see her in there. I’d say hello, be as nice as possible; try to get away.” Bob Granas went to Britt’s, too, but he never met Beth Short. Bob also worked as a page at the NBC studios, wearing a dark blue uniform that looked like that of a Navy ensign. Years later, he speculated about why he was interviewed by Finis Brown: “Maybe because I knew somebody who knew somebody who knew her.”\n\nBob Granas said he and George Bacos were acquaintances since “about the time of high school.” Bob was in the publishing business. He put out the Beverage Bulletin. George was in show business. He was originally from Chicago, but stayed in Southern California, attending Marshall High School and later Los Angeles City College before joining the Army Air Corp. He supplied talent to clubs, including the Crown Grill near the Biltmore downtown. George was also employed at Jay Farber Associates in “Cosmo Alley” in Hollywood. He worked on commission, promoting records and handling publicity. Later, he was a television writer and wrote the book, Warriors Down. His sister, Frances Campbell, was a waitress at the Crown Grill.\n\nMaurice Clement met Beth about December 1 in Brittingham’s. He said she was broke and he picked up her check. He said he saw her three or four times within the week. Salvador Torres Vara, another acquaintance of Beth’s, worked at Brittingham’s as a dishwasher at one time.\n\nCrown Grill\n\nThe Crown Grill was located at 8th Street and Olive Street in downtown Los Angeles, two and a half blocks south of the Biltmore Hotel. The Jewel Room was a popular night spot with a pianist and live entertainment. Unsubstantiated reports said Beth used to go to the Crown, where Anne Toth was a regular. Anne said that Beth never told her she went there. “- as a matter of fact, I used to go down there all the time, so I imagine she would mention it to me if she did.” Anne said she did not recall Bob Granas, George Bacos or his sister Frances Campbell. She said, “- I used to meet Leo there quite often down at the Crown Jewel. Seemed to me that she always repeated a lot of things I said to other people and she may have gone down there because of my going down there with Leo, but I never saw her there.”\n\nWhen investigators asked Anne about George, she said, “I have heard of him.” They told her, “You see, George Bacos went out with her and that’s not far from where she disappeared, you know, from her last being seen there at the Biltmore.” They said to her, “Bacos ducked us when we first looked for him.” They also asked if she knew Bob Granas or George’s sister Frances Campbell or John Egger. Anne said, “No.”\n\nLeo Hymes was questioned about the circle of acquaintances, too. He said he knew the Crown Jewell bartenders Gil, Harry and Al. He also remembered Carol Fisher, a friend of Beth’s from Camp Cooke, but he couldn’t recall Marjorie Graham, who investigators described as heavy-set, light blond. Leo told them, “I am the poorest guy in the world on names. If I see a picture, I never forget.”\n\nThe Pig Stand\n\nMarjorie Graham worked nights at the Pig Stand on Vermont Avenue, just south of Sunset Boulevard. Rose Bone and Irene Grimes also worked there with Margie and remembered Beth as a customer. Bob Granas was another patron. The Pig Stand was a popular hang out for young people.\n\nRobert S. Gessinger, whose business card was discovered among Elizabeth Short’s belongings, told police that he met her in Hollywood in October, 1946. Gessinger, an outdoor advertising firm executive, said he drove Beth to to a drive-in at Sunset Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.\n\n* * *\n\nMichael Anthony Otero, who lived on Marathon Street, a few blocks from Los Angeles City College, dated Elizabeth Short. He was six older than her. Otero, a one time student at UCLA, was 5′ 6″ and weighed just 125 lbs when he registered for the draft. Otero was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He said he met her on Hollywood Boulevard. He said he’d taken her out for dinner and drove her home. She borrowed five dollars from him on two occasions, but never repaid him, he said. Otero last saw her at Hollywood and Vine in early December, 1946.\n\nPaul MacWillaim, who lived on Brunswick Avenue, near Los Feliz Boulevard, worked as a movie extra. He knew Beth and Lynn Martin. He saw Beth for the last time at the Gilmore Auto Races near Gilmore Field and the Farmer’s Market. He remembered her referring to a Long Beach man who was “very jealous of her.”\n\n* * *\n\nAce Cain’s\n\nAce Cain’s was an established cafe on Western Avenue in Hollywood. It was just one of many such places where Beth Short was seen.\n\nArdis Green, alias Joy Powers, said she met Beth there on her birthday, August 27, 1946. They were introduced to each other by a camera girl named Loraine. Ardis said Beth was accompanied by a man who was about 6’1″ to 6′ 3″ tall. When investigators showed her a photograph of Leslie Dillon, she said, “I can almost positively say that this is the man that was with Beth Short the night that I was introduced to her, but I can’t say positively until I could see him smile or see him in person.”\n\nArnold Edmundson, a bartender for twelve years, could not identify Beth or Leslie Dillon from photographs, but his wife recognized both from the pictures, although she did not remember seeing them there together. Joe Cappo remembered Beth from the photograph, but did not recognize Dillon.\n\nOn August 27, 1946, the same day that witnesses said they saw Beth at Ace Cain’s, Gordon Fickling and Elizabeth Short checked out of the Brevoort Hotel on Lexington Avenue and separated\n\n* * *\n\nJoe Dallesandro, the long time and current manager of the Brevoort, says that Elizabeth Short would visit a resident who lived in the rear gardens in Villa F.\n\nTabu of Hollywood\n\nAccording to newspaper articles, there are two known times that Beth visited the Tabu of Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nJimmy Harrigan, an aviation mechanic, told investigators that he met Elizabeth Short in December, 1946. A newspaper article reported,\n\n“Harrigan was contacted at the San Bernardino Army Air Base, where he is now a civilian employe.\n\n“He said he first met Beth Short last Dec. 1, when he picked her up on Hollywood Blvd. He took her to the Tabu, a night spot, and they chatted over several drinks.\n\n“After an hour, Harrigan said, he drove Beth home. Home at that time for the ill-fated girl was the now-celebrated Apartment 501 in a hotel at 1842 N. Cherokee Ave. Before they parted Harrigan made a date for the following evening.” They then drove to the Sycamore Inn east of Los Angeles on Route 66.\n\nAnother account was given by Christenia Salisbury, a woman who claimed to have known Beth in Miami Beach.\n\nChristenia Salisbury told police she had seen Elizabeth Short and two other women in a black coupe along the curb at the 7200 block of Sunset Boulevard some time after 10 pm on January 10. The witness said she “ran into Elizabeth as she and two other women were coming out of the Tabu Club on Sunset Strip in Hollywood.” Beth told her, “I’m living with these two girls in a motel in San Fernando Valley.” The Tabu of Hollywood was located at 7290 Sunset Boulevard\n\nRobert Manley was a tall, good looking, 25 year old traveling salesman from South Gate with a beautiful wife and a young son at home at the time of the murder.\n\nWhen he registered for the draft in 1942, he was 5′ 10 1/2″ tall and weighed 140 lbs, had red hair, a light complexion and a scar on his left elbow. At the time, he was working for the Montgomery Ward Company.\n\nSeven months after his discharge from the army air corp on April 17, 1945, Bob Manley married Harriette Cooper on Nov 28, 1945. Harriette, three years younger than her husband, gave birth to their son, Steven, on September 8, 1946.\n\nBy 1947, “Red” was, “employed as a sales engineer by Baker and Company in Huntington Park,” according to investigators. His territory stretched from the Bay Area to San Diego. He took orders for plumbing supplies, traversing his route in his black 1939 Studebaker coupe.\n\nIn San Diego, visiting his accounts, he recalled, “I saw Miss Short standing on a corner across from the Western Air Lines I looked at her and decided to try and pick her up.”\n\n“I asked her if she wanted to ride. She turned her head and wouldn’t look at me. I talked some more. I told her who I was. And what I did and so forth. Finally she turned around and asked me if I didn’t think it was wrong to ask a girl on a corner to get in my car. I said yes, but I’d like to take you home and she got in the car.”\n\nRed drove her to the home of Elvera French, where they sat in the car and made plans for him to take her out to dinner. Beth said she would tell the Frenches that she worked with Red at Western Air Lines.\n\nHe had a date with her again at the airline office where Beth said she worked. Manley showed up, but she wasn’t there. “I asked two or three people and they didn’t know her and I didn’t think she worked there then.”\n\nThey stayed in contact and on January 7 they agreed to meet. Red told Frank Jemison,\n\n“She asked me to drive her to Los Angeles. I told her I had to make some business calls. But she put her baggage in my car and said she would take a bus that night.”\n\nHe took her out for drinks that evening and later got a motel room for the night.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times quoted a witness saying, “Both Miss Short and her companion were in a ‘jolly mood,’ joking as the companion loaded the valises into the automobile.”\n\nJemison asked Red if he knew how she got to San Diego. He said, “No. I don’t remember her saying how she got down there.”\n\n“Did she talk about any murders you had been reading about in newspapers — anything about that?”\n\nManley replied, “No, in fact, she talked very little on the way in to Los Angeles and I wasn’t in a very talkative mood. I don’t know what was the matter with her. It didn’t make any difference to me. I was just glad to get rid of her.”\n\nRed dropped her off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on January 9 under the assumption that she was to see her sister, Virginia West, at the hotel. He waited briefly, and at about 6:30 pm, he drove off to resume his life.\n\nManley’s fabled trip from San Diego to the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles with Beth Short has been told and retold over time, but years after the murder, Red added new touches to the story.\n\nHe said that, to his knowledge, Beth never made a telephone call after they departed the French home. “No, not one,” he said. It was Red that used the payphone just before leaving San Diego. “- I called my wife from San Diego,” he said. He agreed that it was possible that she did make calls while he was conducting business in Encinitas or Oceanside, but he never observed her using a telephone.\n\nA newspaper reported days after the murder that Manley said of Beth, “She had bad scratches on both her arms above the elbows on the outside. She told me she had a boyfriend who was intensely jealous of her.” He said he was “an Italian with black hair,” and that he lived in San Diego. Jemison asked him if she complained of a toothache or a headache. He didn’t remember her saying one way or the other. He gave him a list of doctor’s names, including De Gaston, Ahrens, Scott and Brix, asking if she had mentioned any of them. Again, Red answered no.\n\nShe was sick in the Mecca Motel before they left. “Well, she didn’t even care to have me do much talking after we got back to the room, after we had been dancing. She just took a blanket off of the bed, propped her legs up against the wall by the heater and I asked her what was the matter with her and she said she just didn’t feel well and for me to leave her alone so I did, and she didn’t talk much more after that.”\n\n“She said it was just that time of the month and she wanted to be left alone.” They had been at the Hacienda Club in Mission Valley, where she danced with him and with the band vocalist.\n\nDuring the motor trip to Los Angeles, Red said she was constantly looking back at “Cars that passed on the right, and then, if I’m not mistaken, cars that would pass us, but I noticed mainly on cars I would pass. She would strain her neck and look, like this toward the rear of the car.”\n\nRed drove his Studebaker from San Diego, with a stop in Encinitas, where he had a new account, and where they had hamburgers. The next stop was Laguna Beach, where Beth used the restroom and Red purchased gasoline.\n\nFrom the beginning, before they left San Diego, Beth told Red that she would be meeting her sister, Mrs. Adrian West from Berkeley, at the Biltmore, but when they reached Los Angeles, she wanted to check her things at the Greyhound bus station first. According to newspaper reports, Beth’s luggage “consisted of a hat box, a suitcase and a small bag.”\n\nShe told Red he could leave her there. “She led me to believe she hadn’t been in Los Angeles before and I told her it was a bad part of town and I better take her to the Biltmore and I told her to stay away from that part of town.”\n\nHe dropped her off at the Biltmore, where she used the restroom while he checked at the desk for her sister, Mrs. Adrian West. There was no record. He said goodbye and left.\n\nLAPD Sergeants Sam Flowers and Jerry Wass took Manley into custody, soon after his return from San Francisco, where, he said, he read about the murder. “I turned sick inside,” he was quoted in newspapers.\n\nRed and associate Harry Palmer of Eagle Rock were on a business trip to San Francisco on Friday, January 17 when Manley learned of the murder of Elizabeth Short.\n\nRed said he, “turned sick inside.” He told Palmer he was, “in a heck of a mess and didn’t know what to do.”\n\nHe called his wife Friday night,”but I didn’t mention it to her, of course, because she didn’t even know I knew the girl. Saturday afternoon, when I was out on calls, my wife called me. I returned the call Saturday night and when I finally got her the first thing she said was, ‘Did you do it?’\n\n“The cops had been at our house in South Gate that afternoon and told her I was connected with Betty. Then I knew I was in for it.”\n\nRed Manley served in the Army Air Corps from June 24, 1942 until his discharge on April 17, 1945. He was a corporal and a bandsman in the Army Air Force Marching Band and played the saxophone. His education while in the service was listed as “musician, teacher, music.” He served in Santa Ana, and Lemoore, California. Red received the Service Lapel Button and the Victory Medal. He was separated from the service from Dibble General Hospital in Menlo Park, California.\n\nRed died on January 9, 1986, thirty-nine years to the day after leaving Elizabeth Short at the Biltmore Hotel.\n\nSoon after Robert Manley’s arrest, Aggie Underwood obtained an exclusive interview with the suspect and her article was printed in the Hearst newspaper, The Evening Herald-Express on January 20, 1947. The article, as it appeared under her byline, Agness Underwood, is transcribed below:\n\n* * *\n\nI knew Betty Short- sure. I saw her twice. I even kissed her a couple of times. But believe me, knowing her has taught me to walk the straight and narrow. If ever a guy found himself in a mess, I’m it.\n\nWith the lipstick of his pretty wife, Harriette, still on his face- implanted there last night when she kissed him and promised to “stand by”- Robert “Red” Manley, a 25-year-old ex-army corporal, today at Hollenbeck Police Station denied any connection with the brutal murder of Elizabeth Short.\n\nA desire to “test myself and see if I still loved my wife,” a few stolen kisses, an unromantic night in a motel with Miss Short all led to his arrest on a suspicion of murder charge, young Manley said today.\n\nSLEEPLESS NIGHT\n\nEyes red-rimmed from a sleepless night, but, he said, “with conscience clear,” young Manley told The Evening Herald-Express a detailed account of his two meetings with the “Black Dahlia,” whose brutally murdered body was found last Wednesday in a vacant lot on South Norton Avenue.\n\n“A week or 10 days before Christmas my company sent me to San Diego on business,” Manley said, as though anxious to “talk this thing out.”\n\n“I drove to San Diego after hitting all my sales spots, and arrived there about 5 p. m. I decided to take it slow and see everything I could because I hadn’t been there since the exposition.\n\n“I saw Miss Short standing on a corner across from the Western Air Lines. I looked at her and decided to try to pick her up.\n\n“My wife and I had just had the baby and we had to go through sort of an adjustment period. We had lots to iron out. It was nothing important but just lots of little things.\n\nPLANNED TEST\n\n“I decided to pick her up and make a test for myself and see if I loved my wife or not.”\n\nHere, the fiery red-haired, romance-seeking young father of a 4-month-old baby, lit cigaret[sic] and then continued his story:\n\n“I asked her if she wanted to ride. She turned her head and wouldn’t look at me.\n\n“I talked some more. I told her who I was. And what I did and so forth. Finally she turned around and asked me if I didn’t think it was wrong to ask a girl on a corner to get in my car.\n\n“I said yes, but ‘I’d like to take you home,’ so she got in the car.\n\n“I drove her to the housing project in Pacific Beach where she was staying with some friends. When we got there we sat in the car and talked and I asked her if she would go to dinner with me.\n\n“She said she would but was worried about how she would tell the people she was staying with just who I was so she decided to tell them that I worked with her. She said she worked for Western Air Lines.\n\nFOUND A ROOM\n\n“After I left her I drove down the highway until I found a room. I registered for myself, went to the corner and got a beer.\n\n“Because I was a stranger in town, I asked the people where I bought the beer where would be a good place to get dinner and maybe dance.\n\n“They told me the Hacienda Club, out on University [sic]avenue in Mission Valley.\n\n“I went back to my room then. I’ll admit I was a little worried about my wife, because you see we were just married in November, 1945, and I had never ‘stepped out’ on her before.\n\n“I cleaned up a little bit and picked up Miss Short at 7. I met the people she was staying with and we left and tried to find -” here he hesitated, then said, “no-we started to drive to the club and it took us two and one-half or three hours to find it.\n\n“Boy, it’s sure easy to get lost in San Diego.\n\n“When we got there we had a few drinks and danced a few times then it was 12 o’clock. We went to a drive in, had a sandwich I took her home.\n\nKIND OF COLD\n\n“No, I didn’t ask her to stop at my room,” he said, in response to questions.” We did sit in the car and talk for a short time, and I kissed her a couple of times, but she was kind of cold, I would say.”\n\nManley admitted he told the girl he was married, during the evening and said she had told him she had been married to “a Major Matt somebody” who had been killed.\n\n“When I walked her to the door, I told her I might be down that way again and I asked her if it would be all right to wire her when I was arriving. She said yes. But she said she did not like San Diego and might not be there.\n\nGUILTY CONSCIENCE\n\n“I went to my room-with a guilty conscience-and the next morning made my San Diego calls. As I left town I drove through Pacific Beach and stopped where she lived, but they told me she was at work.\n\n“When I got home I didn’t tell my wife I’d been out with her.\n\n“I found out I had to make the trip again, and on Jan. 7, about 5 p. m., I sent her a wire that I was arriving next day. I covered the same territory and arrived near the Western Air Lines office about 5 p. m. I waited about one half hour but she didn’t come out. I drove to the place at Pacific Beach and she was there to greet me at the door.\n\n“We walked outside and she asked me if I’d take her down to a telephone. She said she wanted to make a call. But, en route, she said she decided not to make the call after all.\n\n“We started back to where she lived and she asked me if I would drive her to Los Angeles. I said yes, but told her I couldn’t leave until the next day. She decided to put her bags in my car that night, so I helped her load them. Then she got in the car and we drove down the highway. I decided it was about time for me to find a place to sleep so we stopped at a motel.\n\n“I told her I thought it would look funny to drive into a motel with a girl in the car and ask for a room for one, so I asked for a room for two. She made no objection.\n\n“We went into the cabin and I washed my face and shaved and changed my shirt. She combed her hair.\n\nDENIES MAKING LOVE\n\nAsked whether he had made love to the girl while this was going on, young Manley, former army bandsman, strongly denied it.\n\n“We decided to go eat,” he said. “So, we ate, then went back to the Hacienda Club and again it took us a couple of hours to find it.\n\n“En route, however, she wanted to stop at a big hotel in San Diego-the U.S. Grant-that was it.\n\n“We went in the room where the music and everything was but it was dead so we had one drink and then went on to the Hacienda Club.\n\n“We danced several times and had several drinks. She was gay and happy and seemed to be having a swell time. We left at 12 and she had mentioned taking a bus to Los Angeles that night and I asked if she wanted me to take her to a bus. She said she thought it wold be better if I got some sandwiches and we went back to the room. She said she was cold and hungry.\n\nRETURNED TO ROOM\n\n“We went to a driven[sic]-in. I got a couple of hamburgers and we went back to the room.\n\n“When we got in, she grabbed my overcoat and put it around her. She said she wanted a fire, so I lit it. We ate the sandwiches and there was no affection between us. We talked for a while and she said she didn’t feel good. Said she was very cold and pulled a chair up in front of the fire and I threw a couple of blankets over her.\n\n“I asked her if I could get her anything and she said ‘yes,’ her suitcase out of my car-her make-up and stuff.\n\n“I got it and then asked if I could get anything at the drug store and she said no. She sure didn’t act sick when we were dancing.\n\n“Pretty soon I looked at my watch and it was late. With her back to me, I took off my trousers, my coat, my shirt and climbed into bed-and went to sleep.\n\nBAD CHILLS ALL NIGHT\n\n“When I woke up the next morning, she was propped up on the other side of the bed, awake. She said she’d had chills all night long.\n\n“I happed[sic[ out and dressed and told her I had to make some calls in San Diego that morning.\n\n“I did. Then about 12:20-12 noon was checkout time at the motel-I went back and picked her up. I had a call to make on the way back to Los Angeles and she waited in the car for me. It took quite some time and when I got back to the car, she was hungry-again.\n\n“We stopped at a small restaurant and had another sandwich.\n\n“Then we drove to Laguna Beach. There we stopped and got gas. En route she asked whether she could write to me. She said she was going to meet her sister from Berkeley, Mrs. Adrian West.\n\n“I asked where she was going to meet her, and without waiting for her to answer I said ‘The Biltmore?’ and she answered ‘yes.’\n\n“She wrote my name and business address in her notebook, so she could write to me.\n\n“When we got in to Los Angeles, she wanted me to take her to the Greyhound Bus Station so she could check her bags before she met her sister. I drove her to the Greyhound bus Station and carried her bags in. I had to go out to move my car, but told her I would drive around and pick her up and take her to the Biltmore. I didn’t want to leave her in that neighborhood.\n\n“When we got to to Biltmore, she said she had to go to the restroom and asked me if I would check at the desk on whether her sister had arrived.\n\nHE CHECKS ON BLONDES\n\n“I checked information and they had no Mrs. West registered. She had told me her sister was short and blonde. So I went up to a couple of short blonde women in the lobby and asked whether they were Mrs. West-but they weren’t.\n\n“It was getting late and I told her I had to leave. I had to get home. I was worried about my wife. She said she had to wait there and I left her there.\n\n“That is the last time I ever saw Betty Short. I’ll take the truth serum or anything they want to give me. And, I’ll swear on a stack of Bibles and tell my minister, too, that was the last time I ever saw Betty Short. I did not kill her.\n\n“But brother! I’ll never cheat on my wife again!”\n\nBeth left the Chancellor Apartments on December 6 and was once again homeless. Carl Balsiger drove her in his 1940 Oldsmobile to Camarillo and then brought her back. He said dropped her off at the bus station in Hollywood. She arrived by bus in San Diego on December 9.\n\n* * *\n\nOn December 5, 1946, Beth was visibly upset. She cried and told people she was scared. Juanitia Ringo, the manager of the Chancellor in Hollywood, said, “I felt sorry for her even when she got behind on the rent. She looked tired and worried.”\n\n“When I went up for the rent last December 5 she didn’t have it. I don’t think she had a job. That night she got the money somewhere and left the next morning.”\n\nThat same evening, December 5, Beth returned to the Carlos Avenue house.\n\nMark Hansen said, “- she was sitting there one night when I came home, with Ann about 5:30, 6:00 o’clock – sitting and crying and saying she had to get out of there.” He also said, “She was talking about she was going to Oakland to visit her sister there and asked if she could come back to my house when she got back. I told her, ‘I don’t think so. Better find another place.’” Hansen said he took her back to the Chancellor that night and “left her off on the street.” She didn’t ask him for money. “She told me she was working in the cafe at the airport in Burbank.”\n\nHansen went home and later said, “I never saw her again.”\n\nCarl Balsiger picked up Beth on the evening of December 6, 1946. The next day, he took her with him in his car to Camarillo, a town just over the Ventura County line, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and most famous for its forensic mental hospital. They spent the day of the 7th together and drove back to Los Angeles with another passenger, Walter Thackeray, by way of Reseda in the West San Fernando Valley. According to Balsiger, he rented her a room somewhere on Yucca Street in Hollywood that night and drove her to the bus station the next day, December 8. Beth told him she was going to Berkeley to visit with her sister.\n\nBeth arrived by bus in San Diego at 6:00 a.m. on December 9.\n\nAccording to Dorothy French, the cashier at the all-night Aztec Theatre in San Diego, Beth Short engaged her in a conversation that morning, December 9. Beth told Dorothy her story and Dorothy invited to to stay at her home for awhile.\n\n* * *\n\nThe guest overstayed her welcome. Dorothy’s mother Elvera and her brother Cary tiptoed around their home while Beth slept late in the day and didn’t seem to be in a hurry to leave. In an interview, Dorothy said, “she was only going to stay one night, but she stayed a month. We had to ask her to move because our home was so crowded.”\n\nOn January 7, two men and a woman showed up at the French’s door asking for her. This frightened Beth.\n\nOn January 8, Beth called Mark Hansen in Hollywood for help. She wanted to know if she could come back to his home on Carlos Avenue. Hansen recalled, “- she said that she was in trouble and she wanted to know if she could come up, if she could stay. I told her Ann[e] wasn’t home, she could not stay there at all until Ann[e] got home. That is what I told her. Ann[e] was up visiting her parents.”\n\nAnne said she contacted Mark and told him she would be back in Hollywood on January 10. Until then, he did not know when she would return. Anne later said, “Well, if he told her I was coming back on the 10th, as he says, then she would have called me between the 10th and the 14th, because after all, I helped her move before. I did an awful lot for that girl, I think she would come to me before she went to Mark.”\n\nSoon after, Beth made arrangements to return to Los Angeles with her new acquaintance, Bob “Red” Manley.\n\n* * *\n\nThe San Diego police did their own Black Dahlia investigation and came up with a time line for the last weeks of Beth’s life.\n\nMost of her time was spent “loafing.” However, she did date an unidentified man on December 10 and had another date with “an unidentified Naval officer.” On December 15, she was “Washing and Preening.” The next day, the 16th, she “Left house, saying she had interview with airline office job. Picked up by Manley outside bus depot.”\n\nShe had dates with Manley every day from December 17 until December 20. On the 21st, “Manley came for her saying she had failed to show for job interview he had arranged for her.” On December 22, Beth received a postal money order for $100 from Gordon Fickling. She had dinner at the home of Frank Dominguez on December 24 and had “Dinner with the Frenches” on Christmas.\n\nOn December 26, she had a date with Manley again. Then on the 27th, she had a “Date with unidentified man who honked horn in street, after phoning she should be ready on time.” On December 31, she had her “Second date with Dominguez. El Cajon bartender said he slapped or patted her face to sober her up.”\n\nOn January 1, it was “New Year’s day with Frenches.” The next day, Beth received two telephone calls, including one from Los Angeles. She loafed for the next two days and on January 4, she “Went out to buy cosmetics and magazines.” January 5, she “Wrote several letters.” The next day was spent loafing. Then, on January 7, “Beth receives a wire from Manley in Huntington Park. Beth goes out with Sam Nevara [Navarra].” On January 8 Beth “Left with Manley. Went to motel.” And finally on January 9, she Left with Manley for Los Angeles.\n\nDeception\n\nSam Salvatore Navarra was a big fellow, standing 5′ 10″ tall and weighing 245 pounds.
