A memorial service will be held on Saturday, February 23, 2019 at 11am at Lower Valley Presbyterian Church in Califon. Interment will take place at Clove Cemetery in Wantage, NJ at a later date. Roger and his wife, Anne Rich Cooley, resided in Lebanon Township for 51 years before moving to Washington, NJ.\n\nRoger was born in Superior, Wisconsin, on September 18, 1940, and subsequently spent his boyhood in Battle Creek, MI, and Fort Wayne, IN, where his father, Oscar William Cooley, worked as a civilian employee of the US Army during WWII. His family settled in Indianapolis, IN, following the war in 1945. He showed early aptitudes in music and sports, singing as a boy soprano at Trinity Episcopal Church, taking violin lessons, and playing basketball on the PS#70 middle school team, which was a runner-up in the Indianapolis city championship during his seventh-grade year (1952).\n\nAfter two years at Broad Ripple High School, where he competed in basketball and cross country, as well as playing violin in the high school orchestra and singing “Moments to Remember” and other hits in a rock group, his family moved to Ada, Ohio, where his father became an economics professor at Ohio Northern University. Roger starred in basketball at Ada High School, while also studying voice, distinguishing himself in state voice competitions.\n\nRoger attended The College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio, graduating in 1962. He played both basketball and tennis while continuing to study voice. He majored in economics and, subsequently, attended the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business where he earned an MBA degree in marketing in 1964. He also served in the US Army Reserve from 1966-1972.\n\nRoger had a distinguished business career with a number of companies; including Warner-Lambert, RCA, Canada Dry, AT&T, and Crayola. During his 14 years at Crayola (1986-2000) he was VP of the Art Products Division, VP International, and VP Product Technology & Development. He served as President of the Art & Crafts Materials Institute and was on the Board of the National Art Materials Trade Association. Locally, he served on the Boards of the Baum School of Art in Allentown, PA, the State Theatre Center for the Arts in Easton, PA, the American Diabetes Association of Hunterdon County, NJ and the Central Jersey Red Cross. He was also a bridge Life Master and competed with his wife, Anne, in tournaments throughout the eastern US.\n\nRoger was a co-founder of the Lebanon Township Athletic Association and its first basketball commissioner, serving for 10 years and, subsequently, was an AAU basketball coach, coaching his youngest son, Andrew, in the seventh-grade year. Andrew would go on and play on winning teams at Voorhees High School.\n\nRoger served on the board of Ruling Elders and chaired the Building Fund Committee at Lower Valley Presbyterian Church, where he was a member for 53 years. He married his beloved college sweetheart, and they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 2015, taking his entire family on a family reunion cruise to Bermuda. Included were his four magnificent sons and six beautiful grandchildren. He is survived by his wife, Anne Rich, and sons, David Edwin, Bradford Hale, Timothy Allan, and Andrew DeWitt. He also leaves a brother, Dexter Hale Cooley of Greenwood, Indiana, and three loving daughters-in-law; Diane Wiedman, Barbara Pinneke, Stephanie Douglas and, soon to be married, Meredith Benedict. His six grandchildren; Ethan, Owen, Sierra, Grant, Oliana, and Mei-Lien; were very close to their ‘grampa’ and will miss him dearly.\n\nRoger was a staunch libertarian whose philosophy is best expressed by the words, “live and let live”. He believed in individual freedom which meant to him that each individual is responsible for his or her own life, and the government should not interfere in the enjoyment of that life or provide ‘entitlements’ which simply involve theft from your neighbor, which you would never condone if you did not have the government to carry out the thievery. His disdain for big government was evident in an article he wrote, entitled “The Political Process”, which illustrated the corrupting nature of politics, and the need for strict single one-term limits in order to reduce the quest for power that is ingrained in our political system. For those who argued that we would lose experienced legislators with single one-term limits, his response was that long-serving experienced legislators got us into the trouble we are in and that fresh faces every two and six years would end campaign finance corruption and bring fresh ideas to governing.\n\nTypical of his broad range of interests, Roger also wrote a self-published book on the basic principles underlying the game of basketball. He wrote the book after seeing collegiate and professional coaches ignoring basic principles of the game and hoping that his children and grandchildren might benefit from his advice and experience on the hardwood.\n\nRoger lived a full and satisfying life, placing family above all, and making the world a better place by his example. He will be missed by all who knew him but leaves knowing that those who come after him will continue his legacy.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations should be made to the Lebanon Township Athletic Association by clicking here or to the music fund at Lower Valley Presbyterian Church, 445 County Road 513, Califon, NJ 07830.\n\nArrangements by Scarponi-Bright Funeral Home in Lebanon, NJ.\n\nDr. John Titus\n\nDr. John P.
