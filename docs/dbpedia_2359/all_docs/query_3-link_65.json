        "text": "1955-58\n\nFootball\n\nLineman\n\n‘60\n\nIt isn’t often that an athlete gets an opportunity to start all four years in a sport. Ed Roth was one of those rare athletes who earned that distinction—starting all four years in football for Head Coach Joe McMullen from 1955-1958. A product of Akron St. Vincent. Toth asserted himself right away as UA’s starting left guard on offense and right tackle on defense. His first-year effort earned him the Most Outstanding Freshman award. The 6-1, 210-pounder switched to left tackle on offense as a sophomore, returned to left guard in 1957 when he was voted the Most Outstanding Junior and displayed his versatility by going both ways at right tackle as a senior. In all, steady Ed started in 35-consecutive games during his career. It was in his senior season that he earned his greatest honors. Despite being voted UA’s Most Outstanding Lineman and earning first team All-Ohio Conference. Toth was runner-up to teammate Dave Adolph for the Mike Gregory Award as the most outstanding lineman in the OC. Toth then joined Adolph and Coach McMullen as members of the victorious West Team in the 1958 Gem City Bowl in Erie Pa. Toth has been employed 21 years at the Goodrich Industrial Products Company and presently Manager of Quality Assurance. He is married to the former Arlene Becosky, a member of the UA faculty. The Toth’s, who have son, Ed and a daughter, Denise, a junior at the University. They reside in Stow."
