        "text": "TACOMA, WA. âÂ The Stars announced the return of one of the premier MASL goalkeepers to Tacoma with the signing of free-agent Chris Toth. Toth previously played for the Stars during the 2021 season but never played a home game at the accesso ShoWare Center as Tacoma played the entire season on the road due to COVID-19 restrictions in Washington State. That season also saw him join Danny Waltman as the goalkeeper duo representing the Western Conference in the first MASL All-Star Game. Per team and league policies, the terms of the agreement were not disclosed.Â\n\nÂ\n\nToth, a native of San Diego, will enter the 2023-24 season in the MASL Top 5 All-Time in regular-season games played (146), wins (85), and saves (1874). During the 2021 campaign, he posted a 3-2-2 record in eight games for the Stars including playoff appearances.Â\n\nÂ\n\nAside from the games he playedÂ withÂ Tacoma, he has played manyÂ againstÂ the Stars and has suited up alongside General Manager Nick Perera for the U.S.M.N.T. Beach Soccer squad, The Soccer Tournament, and at the North America Sand Soccer Championships so he has familiarity with his new club.Â\n\nÂ\n\n\"Chris knows our club, knows our culture, and knows the values of this organization. He is a player of the highest pedigree. I have been fortunate enough to see first-hand just how impactful his presence is, and I canât wait to suit up alongside him again,â said Perera.\n\nÂ\n\nReady to help Tacoma make a deep post-season run in 2023-24, Toth is looking forward to his return to the Stars. He said, \"Iâm really excited to be back. Tacoma and I are due for some real success, and I canât wait to put the work in and help the team make noise this next season.âÂ\n\nÂ"
