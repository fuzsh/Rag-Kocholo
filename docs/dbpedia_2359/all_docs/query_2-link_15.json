        "text": "4. DISCUSSION\n\nSeveral animal models of a brain dysplasia produced by interruption of a one selected stage of prenatal neurogenesis (for example Baraban et al., 2000; Battaglia et al., 2013; Chen & Roper, 2003; Colciaghi et al., 2011; Deukmedjian et al., 2004; Kellinghaus et al., 2004; Kondo et al., 2001; Zhou & Roper, 2010a, 2010b) are dedicated to simulate analogous clinical cases frequently associated with drug‐resistant epilepsy (Baraban et al., 2000; Barkovich et al., 2015; Battaglia et al., 2013; Blümcke et al., 2011; Chen & Roper, 2003; Colciaghi et al., 2011; Deukmedjian et al., 2004; Kellinghaus et al., 2004; Kondo et al., 2001; Rudy et al., 2011; Zhou & Roper, 2010b). Because the production of neurons that are predestined for each of the neocortical layers reaches its peak according to a precisely defined spatio‐temporal schedule (Bayer et al., 1993), the developmental stage at which the proliferative activity is interrupted determines which of the layers will have maximal reduction of its neuronal population and, consequently, maximal functional impairment. In the same way, this interruption affects sets of neurons of various neurochemical phenotypes. Since the neuronal production is a widespread and continuous process, all the remaining cortical layers are always affected but at different degrees.\n\nIrradiation‐induced defects of neuronal migration have an additional impact on the clarity of the dysplastic patterns. A significant part of neurons, which are formed at a defined developmental stage, does not reach its destination sites and settles in deeper cortical layers because of changes in extracellular matrix creating an environment for cell migration (Inouye et al., 1993; Sun et al., 1999; Verreet et al., 2016). We have already assessed approximate ranges of such locational shifts resulting from gamma‐irradiations at four developmental stages applied in our investigations (Setkowicz et al., 2014). These abnormalities lead to modification in the distribution of synapses and fiber orientation (Saito et al., 2014). Finally, to adequately present the range of dysplastic changes, it should be stated that all subcortical structures undergoing neurogenesis at the time of irradiation are always simultaneously affected in a generally similar, diffuse way. Depending on the developmental stage at which the irradiation occurs, a typical pattern of brain dysplasia is formed. This change is accompanied by characteristic modification in seizure susceptibility. Traditionally, but incorrectly, all the effects of the disruption of prenatal neurogenesis (mostly using antimitotic chemical agents like MAMac or ionizing radiation), which diffusely impair the whole brain, are commonly declared and termed as models of cortical dysplasia without paying attention to other functionally linked and also affected brain regions.\n\nThe above conclusion was formulated for the first time, when we extended the commonly used model of brain dysplasia (Setkowicz et al., 2003) to compare the effects of neurogenesis interruptions at each of four selected stages of prenatal development. Our further research (Kielbinski et al., 2018; Setkowicz et al., 2014, 2020) showed that this “quadruple” model more adequately represents the wide variability of clinical cases.\n\nThis approach drew our attention to the previously unnoticed functional consequences of brain dysplasia. For the first time, and in spite of the common belief that any disorder of the brain structure increases its tendency to seizures, it was revealed that a particular degree (or type) of dysplasia may decrease susceptibility to seizures even below that observed in the normal brain (Setkowicz et al., 2003). Moreover, this particular dysplasia could prevent the brain from a strong increase in seizure susceptibility (Setkowicz & Janeczko, 2005) which develops inevitably after a mechanical damage in the normal brain, as it has been documented earlier (Setkowicz & Janeczko, 2003). Also, in this methodological approach, the anatomical and structural changes could be considered as a continuum (Setkowicz et al., 2014, 2020) and detected significant correlations of these changes with susceptibility to seizures justified further exploration of possible causal relationships. So far, the data on spontaneous seizure activity in the dysplastic brains are very few (Chen & Roper, 2003; Kellinghaus et al., 2004; Kondo et al., 2001; Zhou and Roper, 2010b). Therefore, most of the research focuses on changes in the reactivity of dysplastic brains to various exogenous seizure‐genic factors (“second hit”) (for example, Battaglia et al., 2013; Setkowicz et al., 2005, 2003, 2014; Tschuluun et al., 2011).\n\nOur investigations have been devoted to a more universal definition of the consequences of diffuse brain dysplasia using the “multiple” model of single developmental interruptions. These consequences are simultaneously considered in three main aspects: (1) primary dysplastic structural changes as determinants of modified functional features of the brain in normal living conditions at a “resting state,” (2) variability of responsiveness to seizuregenic agents showed by behavioral and/bioelectric symptoms, and (3) differences in tissue reactivity to already occurring seizures (neurodegeneration).\n\nIn the brain dysplasia induced with bromodeoxyuridine given on E15 (Benardete & Kriegstein, 2002), an increase in excitability of the cerebral cortex was found with qualitative disorders of the distribution of CB+, PV+, or CR+ neurons but without changes in their density. Roper et al. (1999) detected significant decreases in the density of PV+ and CR+ neurons in the cerebral cortex (67 and 50% of the norm, respectively) and, in their further studies, considered them to be determinants of increased excitability (Chen & Roper, 2003; Zhou & Roper, 2010a).\n\nZhou and Roper (2010b) recorded spontaneous discharges and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in PV+ and CR+ interneurons in slices of the somatosensory cortex, which was under consideration in the present study, from rat brains with dysplasia induced with irradiation on E17. In PV+ neurons, the frequency and regularity of spontaneous action potentials were reduced and were accompanied by decreases in excitatory synaptic influences on these neurons. This might underlie a reduction of the inhibitory influences of PV+ neurons and increases in cortical excitability. In contrast, CR+ neurons did not display similar features, thus, indicating, in this respect only, their neutral relation to general functional changes typical of the dysplastic brain. The detected phenomena appear to support the results of the present study showing that involvement of PV+ neurons in the brain seizure susceptibility was much greater than that of those expressing CR. However, in the study by Zhou and Roper (2010a), a much stronger radiation dose (2.25 Gy) was used and the cerebral cortex showed a much more disorganized laminar pattern. Therefore, changes in laminar distribution could not be analyzed and, for example, the densities of glutamate transporters were summarized to average values for the whole dysplastic cortex, then compared to particular layers of the normal cortex. By using 1 Gy irradiation dose in our research, we tried to lower its destructive influences, while preserving, at least in part, a general cortical stratification with its relation to the entire thickness of the cerebral hemisphere wall and subcortical neuronal aggregates resulting from migration disorders. However, because of the differently modified cortical structure, particular layers could not be directly compared with their normal pattern and the eight depth zones scale was applied.\n\nPreviously (Setkowicz et al., 2014), we reported that periventricular heterotopia were located not only bilaterally but also unilaterally and this variability was observed even within the same female offspring. This fact cannot be explained by different in utero locations of the fetuses, especially when irradiation was applied from two opposite directions. It is generally declared that the heterotopia result from defects in neuronal migration from the periventricular region. However, the vast majority of GABA‐ergic neurons are generated in the ventral proliferating zones and they reach the dorsal cortex via tangential migration. Therefore, to our best knowledge, the abundant presence of these neurons in the heterotopia (Figure ) remains unexplained.\n\nTechnically, our histological evaluations were based on commonly applied measurements of neuronal density at different depths of the cerebral hemisphere wall (for example, see Barinka et al., 2010; Barinka & Druga, 2010; Clark et al., 2017; Kuchukhidze et al., 2013; Moroni et al., 2008; Papp et al., 2018; Zhou & Roper, 2010a). Irradiation in the early prenatal stages (E13 and E15) led to significant structural changes in the brain hemisphere wall. The composition of each of the cortical layers was incomplete and functionally undefined because the neuronal migration stopped at intermediate positions including white matter. However, even if the neurons remained within periventricular regions, they might develop functional connections to the cerebral cortex (Battaglia et al., 2003; Tschuluun et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010b) and even to the spinal cord (Jensen & Killackey, 1984). From our previous studies (Setkowicz et al., 2014, 2020), we know that the relative size of subcortical heterotopia correlates positively with seizure susceptibility and, consequently, this correlation is negative for the volume of the above located neocortex as it lacks the neurons which have remained in periventricular regions.\n\nSuch changes are commonly presented as the only determinants of seizure excitability without any reference to the still undefined and irreversible extracortical changes. This means, therefore, that the assignment of the abnormal neuronal distribution to the standard cortical layers, characterizing also their functional features, became unreasonable (for example, Zhou & Roper, 2010a). Instead, the actual distribution of these neurons within arbitrarily delineated cortical depth zones could be effectively correlated with the parameters of bioelectric activity in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, in the present study, it was assumed that the subcortical heterotopias and the altered cerebral cortex above them create a continuum of changes in neuronal distribution within the whole examined area. It also included a part of the radiation of the corpus callosum since immunopositive neuronal bodies were also present in it.\n\nHere, changes in density were evaluated for PV+ or CR+ neurons, that is, those containing calcium‐binding proteins typical of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. They were also estimated for interneurons immunopositive for NPY, an endogenous neuroprotectant and anticonvulsant (Baraban, 2004; Dobolyi et al., 2014; Xapelli et al., 2007). The obtained results were tested for their correlation with susceptibility to seizures assessed on the basis of behavioral symptoms and on the power of EEG signal within particular frequency bands.\n\nWhile planning this study, possible changes in neuronal distribution within the examined area of the cerebral hemisphere could be predicted based on the commonly known general neurogenetic schedule. According to Bayer et al. (1993), neocortical neurons in the rat are produced between E13 and E20, with a peak around E15. The earliest‐formed neurons migrate into the cortical layer I and subplate. For the remaining cortical layers, the neurons arise between E13 and E20 according to the inside‐out scheme, that is, the neurons formed around E15 populate the deep layers (VI and V), and those from around E16 and E17‐18 are successively destined for layers IV and II/III. This pattern is also followed by glutamatergic neurons that migrate radially to the neocortex from the ventricular proliferative zone (Fairén et al., 1986).\n\nUnlike glutamatergic, GABAergic neurons arise in the ventral germinal zones and tangentially migrate to the dorsal cortex (Miyoshi et al., 2007; Miyoshi & Fishell, 2011; Taniguchi et al., 2013). Among them, the production of PV+ and CR+ neurons is most intense around E17 or E16, respectively, with generally similar profiles. However, while N‐PV+ colonize the cortex in the inside‐out sequence, N‐CR+ follow the opposite outside‐in pattern (Rymar & Sadikot, 2007). Consequently, a peak of NPV+ production occurs earlier for deep layers (around E14–16) than for surface ones (E18), but for N‐CR+ the profile is reversed and peaks around E18–19 for deep layers and at E16 for more superficial layers.\n\nIn rodents, N‐PV+ and N‐CR+ interneurons are formed in different areas of the embryonic brain (Gelman et al., 2012; Fazzari et al., 2020) and they constitute separate populations with different distribution in cortical layers which is additionally modified in particular functionally defined areas (Barinka & Druga, 2010; Kubota et al., 2011). This results in various impacts on projection neurons (Barinka & Druga, 2010) since PV+ and CR+ neurons play different roles when forming units responsible for the synchronization of pyramidal neurons, particularly extracortical, activity and disinhibition phenomena (Barinka & Druga, 2010; Clark et al., 2017; Druga, 2009; DeFelipe, 1999; Feldmeyer et al., 2018; Kubota et al., 2011; Tremblay et al., 2016).\n\nDisruption of different stages of neurogenesis and the resulting permanent dysplastic changes can have various functional consequences for each of these neuronal populations but these still remain obscure. Additionally, CR is believed to have neuroprotective effects (Barinka & Druga, 2010) which are an additional factor that might differentiate reactivity of these cells.\n\nIn this study, quantitative changes in the two subpopulations were compared. However, if we only considered consequences of the interruption of one stage of neurogenesis (i.e., that occurred on E15 or E17), then, any significant change detected in each of these isolated cases could automatically be accepted (sometimes incorrectly), as a critical determinant of modified susceptibility to seizures. In this work, however, two wide and continuous spectra of changes in N‐PV+ or N‐CR+ populations, characteristic of four degrees of dysplastic changes taken together, were simultaneously matched with behavioral and EEG evidence of functional disorders. Even though the average quantities of N‐CR+ were much lower than those of N‐PV+, the functional consequences of their changes could not be assessed in the same way since the results should be confirmed when other regions of the brain are included in the analyses.\n\nThe lack of significant correlation was demonstrated for N‐NPY+, even though their presence in the dysplastic neocortex was clearly higher than that in the normal one. The antiseizure and neuroprotective functions of NPY in neurons are well known (Baraban et al., 2000; Decressac & Barker, 2012; Xapelli et al., 2007), but no significant correlation was observed here between seizure intensity and the number of N‐NPY+ that survived seizures. The results obtained here and the previously detected regional volume changes (Setkowicz et al., 2020) point again to a wider extracortical location of the neural determinants of seizure susceptibility.\n\nCalcium‐binding proteins protect neuronal homeostasis by buffering incoming calcium ions and they also determine neuronal resistance to degeneration and influence synaptic plasticity. The neuroprotective role of PV is realized with the participation of perineuronal nets, which disappear in response to the oxidative stress that accompanies seizures (Hsieh et al., 2017; Rankin‐Gee et al., 2015).\n\nCR+ neurons have significant sensitivity (Barinka et al., 2010; Barinka & Druga, 2010; Toth & Magloczky., 2014) but are more resistant to seizures than N‐PV+ (Aronica et al., 2007; Barinka et al., 2010; Fairless et al., 2019). Supposedly, this results from the neuroprotective effects of calretinin (Barinka et al., 2010). In clinical epilepsy cases, the number of N‐PV+ decreased significantly but that of N‐CR+ did not (Zamecnik et al., 2006). Similar changes occurred in focal cortical dysplasia (Barinka & Druga, 2010). In this study, before the seizures, N‐CR+ had higher average density in the whole investigated area in E13s and E15s, but only locally in E17s, although this was accompanied by local decreases in other intracortical locations. Compared to N‐PV+, the seizures had a relatively little negative impact on CR+ neurons. In contrast, after the seizures, we observed an increase in the N‐CR+ population in the hippocampus (Blümcke et al., 1999; Marx et al., 2013) as well as marked synaptic reorganization and axonal sprouting, and possibly aberrant neuronal circuitries. Similar studies on postseizure changes in the cerebral cortex are relatively rare in comparison to those on the hippocampal formation.\n\nWhen matched with N‐PV+ and N‐CR+, the presence of N‐NPY+ or the expression of NPY itself could also protect the brain under pathological conditions (Baraban et al., 2000; Dobolyi et al., 2014; Rankin‐Gee et al., 2015). Essentially, N‐NPY+ colonize the neocortex according to the inside‐out sequence, being maximal around E17; however, significant changes in NPY expression occur during development (Cavanagh & Parnavelas, 1990). The vast majority of N‐NPY+ originates around E17 and is distributed mainly within the layer VI and also in layers II‐IV, but some of them are located in white matter (Cavanagh & Parnavelas, 1990; de Quidt & Emson, 1986). However, a quantitative reduction of N‐NPY+, which could be expected in this study after irradiation in E17, did not occur.\n\nHowever, postseizure increases in the density of N‐NPY+ were greatest in E13s and E15s. However, like N‐CR+, they showed no significant correlation with seizure intensity even though their density differed significantly between particular groups with dysplastic brains. Increases in cortical expression of NPY in the context of epileptic activity or various pathological conditions have already been described as endogenous neuroprotective and antiseizure factors (Decressac & Barker, 2012; Dobolyi et al., 2014; Vezzani & Sperk, 2004).\n\nThese local increases in N‐NPY+ density can only be considered to be the effect of elevated NPY expression in response to seizures. As not detected prior to seizures, they could not result from disruptions of prenatal neurogenesis. Since this kind of reactivity occurred in E13s, E15s, and E17s, it could underlie some effects which were completely missing in E19s. This uneven distribution of NPY expression could have been of significance for the previously presented general profile of susceptibility to seizures in the model of four degrees of brain dysplasia (Setkowicz et al., 2005, 2003). However, the lower dose of pilocarpine used here made it impossible to directly compare the previously and recently obtained results.\n\nMost information about NPY effects also comes from studies on the hippocampal formation, so it cannot be ruled out that they might be region‐dependent. For example, after electroshocks, NPY immunoreactivity in rats increased in the parietal cortex and the hippocampus, but not in the striatum (Wahlestedt et al., 1990). Such regional variations can occur even within the cortex itself. According to Van Raay et al. (2012), NPY administration reduced the seizure activity of the somatosensory cortex, but not the motor cortex and suppressed spike‐wave discharges based on the cortico‐thalamo‐cortical loop in a model of absence epilepsy (Ali et al., 2018).\n\nIn our quadruple model of brain dysplasia, the overall pattern of reactivity of N‐PV+, N‐Cr+, and N‐NPY+ was generally consistent with other published data. At the same time, differences were found between particular degrees of dysplasia, which also generally confirm our own, previously published profiles of susceptibility to seizures induced with pilocarpine (Setkowicz et al., 2003) but not to those induced with kainic acid, which showed a generally opposite pattern (Setkowicz et al., 2005).\n\nThis study has identified pairs of animal groups that differ both in their parameters of seizure excitability and densities of immunopositive neurons in the cerebral cortex. However, these parameters were additionally significantly correlated with each other only in the case of N‐PV+. In contrast, in the case of changes in the densities of N‐CR+ and N‐NPY+, there was not even a tendency toward such a direct relation to seizure excitability. In many of the studies cited above‐cited studies, an animal group with only one degree of brain dysplasia (e.g., induced on E15s or E17s) was compared with controls. Consequently, any detected change of dysplastic origin was automatically considered to be the cause of the observed differences in seizure susceptibility. However, some detected intergroup differences might not be of causal importance, but only accompanying phenomena. Thus, their causal significance for seizure symptoms or for changes in EEG spectra should rather be reflected by “dose‐dependent” relations. The use of the quadruple model of dysplasia helps to detect such effects by examining correlations between phenomena that form continua that are much broader than before (Setkowicz et al., 2014, 2020). We have recently shown a significant correlation between the intensity of behavioral seizure symptoms or EEG frequency bands and volumetric changes of various regions of the dysplastic brains (Setkowicz et al., 2020). This was a general indication of possible internal structural changes occurring in these regions and having functional importance. The present article focuses on the neural structure of the cerebral cortex; however, more generalized studies are necessary since the observed phenomena must have much broader and still unrecognized extracortical determinants which are beyond the scope of reports published so far.\n\nIn animal studies, it is common to arbitrarily divide recorded EEG spectra based on visual evaluation and ranges of standard frequency bands in humans. However, the frequency bands distinguished using PCA are more consistent with physiological determinants in given animal and experimental conditions, and they undergo changes in relation to specific brain areas, locations of recording and reference electrodes, or many others. Therefore, in this study, we defined the EEG bands on the basis of the reasons described in detail by Jing et al. (2016).\n\nDue its superficial location, the cerebral cortex exerted a dominant influence on the pattern of recorded EEG signal and the importance of cortical interneurons was correspondingly greater. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the detected changes in EEG spectra could not be localized using the present experimental design since generators of particular EEG rhythms include extracortical structures formed according to different schedules of neuronal production (Bayer et al., 1993). Therefore, these structures were impaired to various degrees by interruptions of particular developmental stages, which determined their functional involvement in systems that generate particular rhythms (Setkowicz et al., 2020). The Delta rhythm depends on cortico‐thalamic connections and can be reduced by beta or gamma oscillations based on cortical interneurons (Cardin, 2018; Cohen et al., 2017; Mann & Paulsen, 2007, 2015; Neske & Connors, 2016; Neske et al., 2015). The theta rhythm, which is typical of rodents, is based on structures that extend from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (Fujisawa & Buzsáki, 2011; Orzeł‐Gryglewska et al., 2015; Pignatelli et al., 2012). Different brain regions are involved in generation of the gamma rhythm (Whittington et al., 2011). In fact, all mechanisms responsible for the components of EEG spectra and their functional interrelations are still poorly understood (Cataldi & Vigliotti, 2018; Jing et al., 2016).\n\nThe initial concept of PV+ interneurons function was that they provide local inhibitory feedback loops in the local cortical and thalamocortical circuits (Bartholome et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2017). More recent results, as the most important, indicate synchronization of the systems within the gamma frequency (Sohal et al., 2009). The appearance of PV expression or changes in its level depend on neuronal activity (Filice et al., 2016). In our study, the correlation between the density of PV+ neurons (with a possible variable level of PV protein expression) and the seizure activity varied from negative values in the SE stage to positive values in the POST‐SE stage. This may reflect two aspects of the influence of these neurons on cortical activity. On the one hand, their main function is to support the regularity of discharges within the gamma frequency range (Sohal et al., 2009), with inhibitory effects on irregular and abnormal overexcitation; on the other hand, they provide supportive preservation of neuronal activities in states of energy deficiency during and after seizures (MacMullin et al., 2020). In this article, however, the expected more specific and stronger correlation with changes in gamma band power has not been distinguished, so in this case, the influence of PV+ neurons might be much broader. Perineuronal nets have also a significant impact on the function of PV+ neurons, especially when they disintegrate in pathological states (Tewari et al., 2018). However, PV+ interneurons themselves also have a high energy requirement, so during seizures they may be functionally collapsed and this, in turn, may change the level of PV expression. It should also be noted that the possible disinhibitory interaction of PV+ neurons (Pfeffer et al., 2013), including their different types, is rather beyond the scope of this article. They are functionally differentiated and also have distinct modes of migration (Miyoshi et al., 2007, 2011; Taniguchi et al., 2013) so they could be affected differently following prenatal irradiations. Thus, more advanced statements based on general quantitative changes in neuronal populations are not reasonably justified.\n\nConcerning the studied neuronal populations, it is not known to what extent their recorded quantitative variability depended on actual numerical changes or on the expression levels of their markers, which are also of functional importance (Arkan et al., 2019; Barinka et al., 2010: Gall et al., 2003; Schwaller et al., 2004). The detected decreases in the density of N‐PV+ and N‐CR+ could have been the final result of decreases in neuronal production and/or seizure‐induced degeneration, or of decreases in the expression of the marker proteins which are also of functional importance (Dobolyi et al., 2014; Marksteiner et al., 1989). In contrast, the detected increases in N‐CR+ or N‐NPY+ density could only be the effect of higher expression of respective proteins (Marksteiner et al., 1989), which could also be important for neuronal survival.\n\nThe largest decreases were detected in the quantity of PV+ neurons. Despite the increase found in E15s before seizures, their average density in each group after seizures was lower than in the controls. Local changes in the density of N‐PV+ at particular depth zones within the cerebral hemisphere wall were clearly negative after both irradiation and seizures. Finally, these decreases spread throughout the greater part of the cortical thickness (in E13s and E15s) and even within the total thickness of the cerebral hemisphere wall (in E19s). Here, in the model of the combined four degrees of brain dysplasia, only N‐PV+ showed density decreases which gradually covered more and more of the cortical layers after gradually later disruptions of neurogenesis. This corresponded with the seizure reactivity profiles detected in our previous studies (Setkowicz et al., 2003, 2005).\n\nIn the present study, especially at particular depth zones or cortical layers, it was difficult to detect the exact location of changes, that were associated with the modification of seizure reactivity, but some clear indicators of their significant functional significance were obtained, which may initiate further research."
