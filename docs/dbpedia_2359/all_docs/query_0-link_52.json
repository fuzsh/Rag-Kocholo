Silas M. Baily, ex-State Treasurer of Pennsylvania, after a lingering illness, due chiefly to a wound received in the head at the battle of Gaines Mills, during the Civil War. When he was able to return home to Uniontown to recuperate after that fight, he was unable to talk, and not altogether able to think clearly. In the course of a few months he recovered his speech and his senses and returned to the front. But after the lapse of 38 years this affliction returned to him, precisely as in 1862, and terminated a life that might otherwise have lasted ten or fifteen years longer. The General recently went to Markleton for treatment, but was only temporarily benefitted (sic). Death relieved him on Saturday, May 5th, 1900.\n\nGeneral Silas Milton Baily, ex-State Treasurer of Pennsylvania, was born in Brownsville, Fayette county, Pa., January 4th, 1836. His boyhood and early life were uneventful. He attended school at Madison College, Uniontown, and after acquiring the basics of a good education, he was apprenticed to his uncle to learn the trade of a silversmith. When President Lincoln issued his call for 75,000 volunteers, General Baily was among the first to respond. He recruited at Waynesburg a company known as the \"Greene County Rangers.\" The \"Rangers\" were sworn in as Company I, of the Eighth Pennsylvania Reserves, the Thirty-seventh Regiment of the line. Among the more prominent battles in which General Baily bore a prominent part with his regiment were Mechanicsville, Gaines' Mill, Drainesville, The Wilderness, Spottsylvania, South Mountain, Fredericksburg, etc. At the battle of Gaines' Mill he was severely wounded in the head. It was at first thought that his injury was mortal. His mind was affected as well as his body; but after four months of treatment and careful nursing, he recovered his intellectual and physical vigor, and returned to his regiment in time to lead in the battle of South Mountain. On March 12, 1863, Major Baily was commissioned Colonel, and remained with his regiment, leading it into all its subsequent contests, until it was mustered out of service on May 24th, 1864. President Johnson conferred upon him, on March 18th, 1865, the distinction of Brevet Brigadier General for galiant (sic) and meritorious conduct during the war.\n\nGeneral Baily was also wounded in the assault made by General Burnside on the defenses of Fredericksburg. At Spottsylvania the Eighth was constantly engaged for seven days and never out of reach of rebel missives. At the battle of Antietam General Baily's horse was killed under him. In the long record of the brilliant deeds of the Pennsylvania Reserves the name of Silas M. Baily shines conspicuously. After the war General Baily settled in Uniontown, where he opened a jewelry store. His induction into politics as a candidate occurred in 1878, when, without solicitation on the part of himself or his friends, the Republican conferees of the Twenty-first Congressional District unanimously selected him to lend the forlorn hope against the then doubly fortified citadel of Democracy in Western Pennsylvania. He was defeated as was expected, but results showed that he had led the state ticket by 500 votes, and reduced materially the usual Democratic majority. In 1880 General Baily was chosen one of the delegation to the Republican National Convention in Chicago, where he was one of the famous 800 who never deserted Grant. His nomination for State Treasurer of Pennsylvania in 1881 was an unsolicited honor. It came to him spontaneously and unasked. But that was one of the years in the early 80's, when there was great unrest in the Republican party, the year when Charles S. Wolfe was the candidate for\n\nTreasurer of the independent Republicans, and General Baily narrowly escaped defeat, his majority being about only 7,000. He never held office afterward. Deceased was a man of most positive character, yet he intuitively avoided personal antagonisms, and was popular with men of all political creeds. Interment was in Tuesday in the Oak Grove Cemetery at Uniontown. The funeral was in charge of the Masons, Rev. H.C. Baird and Rev. T.F. Pershing conducting services.\n\nThe Courier, Connellsville, PA, May 11, 1900\n\nS. M. Baily Federal (USV) Major Silas Milton Baily (1836 - 1900) Home State: Pennsylvania Command Billet: Commanding Regiment Branch of Service: Infantry Unit: 8th Pennsylvania Reserves see his Battle Report\n\nBefore the Antietam Campaign: He had established himself in business as a jeweler at Waynesburg, Pennsylvania before the War. He helped raise a company of infantry on the first call for troops in the Spring of 1861, and was elected their Captain. He mustered into service 20 June 1861 as Captain, Company I, 8th Pennsylvania Reserves. He was promoted to Major of the regiment on 4 June 1862, replacing J. B. Gardner, who had resigned. In the Antietam Campaign: \"At the battle of Gaines' Mill [27 June 1862], he was severely wounded in the face, and was carried, insensible, to Washington for medical treatment. When the Army of the Potomac entered upon the Maryland campaign, Major Baily, though pronounced by his surgeon to be unfit for service, determined to join his command. He overtook the division in camp near the Monocacy, and being the ranking officer, took command of the regiment, which he led with such distinguished gallantry, both at South Mountain and at Antietam, that he was promoted to the colonelcy as a reward for his meritorious conduct on the field of battle.\" (from Sypher) The remainder of the War: He was wounded again in action at Fredericksburg in December 1861, and promoted to Colonel on 1 March 1863. He was with the regiment until he mustered out with it on 24 May 1864.\n\nReferences, Sources, and other notes: Sources: Bates, Samuel P., History of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-65, Harrisburg: 1868-1871, extracted online at Pennsylvania in the Civil War by Alice J.

It has been the writers privilege to be personally acquainted with her for several years, and he has often been impressed with the high tone of loving, tender, gentle piety which her life vilified abounding in Charity which thinketh no evil, suffereth long and is kind. She often spoke with calmness of the change which she felt was near at hand, resigning her children to the giver of the jewels she waited patiently her time. A few days before her death many clouds and doubts arose, but the Divine Spirit is answer to much prayer removed them all so that she could rejoice in prospect of a glorious immortality. Her last words as she gently closed her eyes ere I can no sleep. Asleep in Jesus O how sweet, To be for such a slumber meet. But the four precious children, how lonely they are left, without a mothers warm heart near to sympathize, her wisdom to instruct, and hands to lead, yet the God of the Sainted mother will be their God, guide and portion. It is sweet and soothing to know we are children of a parent or parents who live in heaven may a mothers prayers be answered, a mothers example and instruction be followed.

BAKER ( -1853)\n\nDIED\n\nIn this place, on Monday morning last, DAVID S. BAKER, aged 25 years. Let me die the death of the righteous, and my last end be like his. A youth has been stricken down  the grave has closed  God has changed his countenance and sent him away. He has been taken from the evil to come. But the grave, however strong its fetters, cannot bind the soul. O death where is thy victory. The Redeemer is mine, I am his, is expressive and suitable language, when uttered by one whose life has been without reproach, and whose Christian character is faithful, such as been emphatically the life of David S. Baker. With the approaches of death he was made acquainted, and met the king of terrors with the calmness of summers eve. The last four or five days of his life were spent in almost constant exhortations, urging his numerous visitors to Choose that better part, which shall not be taken away. He knew his life was closing, and that there is no work or device in the grave. Christ was precious to him, and he felt great boldness in declaring him the Savior of sinners. He said, I would not be afraid to speak to a king to tell him of Jesus. His repeated statements of his peace of mind  entire resignation to the will of God  confident hope in Christ, and happiness in the change he was about to make  reminded one of the olden time, when it was said by an Apostle, to live is Christs, but to die is gain. To be present at the close of human existence is always interesting  sometimes deeply distressing. It is so, because the trial  the probation is ended, and the final  eternal  unalterable judgment of the Creator will soon be known to the soul. But is it not joy to the people of God when the last sound from dying lips  the last final effort of mortal man  as he sinks into the dark valley and shadow of death, is to declare from that threshold of eternity, the joyful sound, I fear no evil, Jesus stands ready to receive me. And is it not impressive when from dying lips the faint, penetrating, searching, heart appalling sound is heard, be ye also ready. B.\n\nGenius of Liberty, Uniontown, PA, Thursday, March 31, 1853, Vol. I, No. 51, page 3, column 4\n\nContributed by Roy Lockart\n\nDonald Earl BAKER (1979-2003)\n\nDonald Earl Baker\n\nAllegheny Township\n\nDonald Earl Baker, 68, of Allegheny Township, died Wednesday (June 12, 2003) in Allegheny Valley Hospital, Harrison.
