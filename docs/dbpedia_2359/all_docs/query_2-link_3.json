There was insufficient evidence to infer a causal connection as the defendants work as they had never come across the plaintiff or his work.\n\nFirst alleged infringement by defendant Hardy: The Homecoming, composed for three commercials aired over 1973-1975 (The Birthday, The Taxi, The Church). alleged to contain 16 bars of the plaintiff’s work.\n\nSecond alleged infringement by defendant Toth: Moments of Love alleged to have eight bars of the plaintiff’s work.\n\nThe judge did find a remarkable similarity between the melodies of the plaintiff’s and defendant’s work, more so in Toth’s Moment of Love. Due to the remarkable similarity the plaintiff moved to infer unconscious copying. This failed, however, through a lack of any causal connection linking the defendant to the plaintiff’s work.\n\nOpinion by Judge Carruthers\n\nThe above styled actions have been tried as one. They both involve claims based upon an alleged in-\n\nfringement of copyright of a musical work.\n\nThe trial began on the 22nd of June, 1981, at a time when Ivan Gondos (“plaintiff”) was alive but, ob-\n\nviously, very ill. It had been considered, by reason of the plaintiff’s condition, to have his evidence, for the\n\npurpose of trial, taken de bene esse. An application was made and, on the return of which, it was determined\n\nthat the trial should then begin on the basis that I would become seized of the matter and, thereby, permit the\n\nplaintiff’s evidence to be given vive voce, in the normal way. When the taking of the plaintiff’s evidence was\n\ncompleted, after some three days had elapsed, the trial was adjourned sine die. The plaintiff died shortly\n\nafter this time. The actions, revived and carried on by his widow in her representative capacity, came on\n\nagain for trial on the 19th of April, 1982 and lasted for a further eleven days. My judgment was then re-\n\nserved to this date.\n\nGenerally speaking, the plaintiff alleges that portions of his original musical composition, which he\n\ntitled Variations on a Theme in A Minor (“Variations”), and sometimes referred to as “Variations on a\n\nTheme” and “Theme and Variations”, were copied or performed by the defendants in contravention of the\n\nprovisions of The Copyright Act, R.S., c. 55, s. 1, (“the Act”).\n\nIn action number 60735/80 (“first action”), the plaintiff claims that a musical composition, ultimately\n\nentitled “The Homecoming”, written and performed by Hagood Hardy (“Hardy”) and published by Hagood\n\nHardy Productions (“Productions”) in 1972, contains 16 bars or measures of Variations. In action number\n\n60736/80 (“second action”), the plaintiff claims that a musical composition known as “Moment of Love”,\n\nwritten and published by the defendants Rudy and Jerry Toth sometime after May of 1975, contains 8 bars\n\nor measures of Variations. In his testimony at trial, the plaintiff described The Homecoming and Moment of\n\nLove as being identical to Variations. I think it is clear from all of the evidence and the position taken by\n\ncounsel that, in fact, the position of the plaintiff is that those bars or measures in question do not constitute\n\nthe whole of the works of the defendants, but only the melodies or themes thereof. It is not maintained on behalf of the plaintiff that The Homecoming contains the bars or measures claimed to be found in Moment\n\nof Love, or that those alleged to be in Moment of Love are found in The Homecoming.\n\nIn each of the actions, the defendants can be said to generally deny the position taken by the plaintiff\n\nagainst them. Specifically, while admitting that The Homecoming was written in Toronto, Ontario in or\n\nabout the month of July, 1972, Hardy and Productions deny that any part of any work of the plaintiff was\n\ncopied in so doing. They also specifically deny that prior to his writing the music for The Homecoming,\n\nHardy had previously seen or heard Variations or met the plaintiff as alleged, or at all. They deny that Vari-\n\nations was written prior to 1972. Both Hardy and Productions allege that if the plaintiff is entitled to any re-\n\nlief, it is either limited in scope or prescribed by virtue of the provisions of the Act. At trial, the Statement of\n\nDefence of Hardy and Productions was amended to include an allegation that, in any event, the plaintiff has\n\nno status to bring this action because of an assignment of copyright made on the 26th of July, 1965 to BMI\n\nCanada Limited (“BMI”). The defendants Toth also raise this assignment in their Statement of Defence. As\n\nwell, they specifically deny that they had ever met, spoken to, or heard of the plaintiff or Variations prior to\n\nthe music for Moment of Love being written or first recorded in 1970. In the counterclaim brought on behalf\n\nof the defendants Jerry and Rudy Toth, it is alleged that the plaintiff, in composing his work, copied from\n\nMoment of Love, and that this constitutes an infringement of the copyright which they maintain subsists in\n\nthat work. None of the parties suggest that any of the musical works under consideration in this action are\n\nnot or cannot be that in which copyright may subsist in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nWhile the plaintiff in his evidence ultimately settled on 1956 as the year in which he first set pen to\n\npaper in composing Variations, it is a version he claims was further developed by him in 1962 to which the\n\ndefendants have wrongfully resorted. I say “ultimately settled on 1956” because, in evidence at trial he first\n\nsaid “originally in the ’50’s …..”, then, “well, in the ’60’s, just at 1960, I believe”, and then, “originally in\n\n1956”. In answer to his counsel’s question as to what happened to the “1956 piece of that music”, the\n\nplaintiff replied “It’s been lost”. He was then shown a four-page folio of sheet music which was entered as\n\nExhibit 1 at trial, and which I shall refer to as Exhibit 1 hereafter. There is no dispute that only pages 2, 3\n\nand 4 contain the handwritten notations of music for Variations. With respect to Exhibit 1, the plaintiff said:\n\n“This was written out in 1962, 10th day, 11th month, 1962”. In answer to a question from his counsel: “Why\n\ndid you write it out at that time again?”, he replied: “I was developing it, and it is also different arrange-\n\nments I had made of this theme”. The plaintiff said that Exhibit 1 was written from memory in 1962. From\n\nhis evidence, it appears that the plaintiff intended Variations to be part of another work of his, Children’s\n\nSuite, which had, itself, been underway for many years and which was just completed at the time of trial in\n\nJune of 1981.\n\nAt this point, I should note that the plaintiff, apparently, used many names to describe himself. His\n\nfull name is Louis Julian Ivan Gondos. Although he was commonly known as Ivan Gondos, he said he also\n\nreferred to himself as “Louis Ivanfai Gondos”, “Louis Gallant Gondos”, and “Gallant Gondos”. Apparently,\n\nhe, as well, used “Ivanfai Gondos” as a name, for that is what is shown on Exhibit 1. There is no dispute that\n\nthe plaintiff did not register the copyright he claims in Variations until the 14th of March, 1979. The title\n\nshown on the certificate of registration is “Variations on a Theme in A Minor”, and the name of the author is\n\ndescribed as “Ivan foi Gondos”. This last description is, apparently, the result of an error on the part of the\n\nsolicitor representing the plaintiff in his application for registration. I accept that the name should read “Ivan\n\nFai Gondos” and that, in any event, the name shown purports to be and is that of the plaintiff for the pur-\n\nposes of the relevant provisions of the Act.\n\nAs I have noted above, it is the claim of the plaintiff that the musical work portrayed by Exhibit 1 and,\n\nspecifically, pages 2, 3 and 4 thereof, exemplifies that in which subsists his copyright that has been in-\n\nfringed by the defendants. Exhibit 1 is the only copy of that which he wrote in 1962 that remained in his\n\npossession until sometime after this action was commenced in 1980. He produced at trial what he claimed was a Xerox copy of Exhibit 1 made by him on a date he could not remember, and given to a friend, a\n\nformer pupil and sometime musical associate, Roy Robson, “years ago, 1965 or so, I don’t know”. This doc-\n\nument was entered into the proceedings as Exhibit 13 and shows on it the name “Roy Robson”, and a date\n\n“May 9, 1981”. I shall refer to it as Exhibit 13. Apart from one other, which it is suggested on behalf of the\n\nplaintiff is also a copy of Exhibit 1 and which I shall deal with further, there are no others which are indic-\n\nated to be in existence and which have not always been in the possession of the plaintiff. The plaintiff does\n\nnot suggest that copies of Exhibit 1, and in particular, pages 2, 3 and 4, were ever printed or reproduced in\n\nany form intended for distribution to the public on any basis. Other versions of Variations were written by\n\nthe plaintiff after 1962, which were a part of the further developments of what he called his “Children’s\n\nSuite” or “Children’s Songs”. Although some reference was made to them, I think it can be properly said that\n\nthe parties do not consider them relevant to the matters in issue in this action.\n\nRoy Robson, an elementary school principal, testified at trial on behalf of the plaintiff. He said they\n\nfirst met in 1965, and that he received Exhibit 13 “shortly after he became a student of the plaintiff in 1966”.\n\nHe had no idea who made the copy. He said he found it in a drawer in his home in 1981, shortly after which\n\nhe dated it “May 9, 1981” and returned it to the plaintiff, presumably, for use in this action.\n\nAnother former pupil of the plaintiff, and also a teacher of music, Sharon Pagliuso, was also called\n\nto testify on his behalf. They first met in 1963 at the place where the plaintiff was then giving piano lessons\n\nin Toronto. On being shown Exhibit 1, she said that the plaintiff had given her a copy of pages 2, 3 and 4\n\n“shortly after she started”, suggesting this to be 1964. She said that she didn’t know where the copy was at\n\nthe time of trial, and her last use of it was made in 1968. She described the paper of the copy she received as\n\n“narrower and larger” than that of Exhibit 1, with the pages “put together in accordion fashion with masking\n\ntape”. She testified that a date, which she believed was 1962, was on the copy she had. She said that the\n\nplaintiff told her that the copy she received had been made just before she received it, and represented what\n\nhe had written a year before.\n\nMarcello Febbo, an artist, who first met the plaintiff in 1959 while he was playing piano at La Coter-\n\nie Cafe in Toronto, also testified for the plaintiff. On being asked if he had seen Exhibit 1 before, he replied:\n\n“Yes …. in 1962 …. I sat with him while he wrote it …. he wrote it from another rough copy.”\n\nUndoubtedly, the object of the evidence of the witnesses Robson, Pagliuso and Febbo is to support\n\nthe plaintiff’s position that he composed all which he claims as his original work and to be found in Exhibit\n\n1, pages 2, 3 and 4, in 1962, long before that claimed by the defendants as their own came into being.\n\nThe evidence of another witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, Robert Mobbs, when considered\n\nalong with that of two witnesses called on behalf of the defendants, Peter Schopfer and Ernie Sniedzins, re-\n\nquires me to doubt that Roy Robson received a Xerox copy of Exhibit 1 in 1966 as he claims. Mobbs testi-\n\nfied in cross-examination that Exhibit 13 showed reproduction signs, which he referred to as “track marks”,\n\nnot consistent with it being made by Xerox equipment available in 1966. The evidence of Schopfer and\n\nSniedzins is that the size of the paper used for Exhibit 13 suggests that it is more likely 1974 or 1975 when it\n\nwas made. I cannot accept the evidence of the witness Febbo that he saw Exhibit 1 being produced by the\n\nplaintiff. The event he described, if it occurred, was 20 years ago; and Febbo gives no explanation as to how\n\nhe is able to relate what he was shown at trial, Exhibit 1, to the other, apart from the date shown on Exhibit\n\n1, “10/11/62”. Although I accept that the witness Pagliuso received a Xerox copy of the music from the\n\nplaintiff in 1963, I am not prepared to find that such was what is shown on pages 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit 1, as\n\nshe claimed at trial. I should note here that her evidence about receiving a Xerox copy in 1963 is not subject\n\nto the same criticism as that of Robson because it is of different size paper which was linked by masking\n\ntape.\n\nI think it is appropriate for me to say here that in concluding as I have about the evidence of Robson,\n\nFebbo and Pagliuso, I do not intend to suggest that any of them have consciously departed from the truth as\n\nthey look upon it. Nor do I reject all of their evidence. I think they have been caught up with the cause of the\n\nplaintiff to such an extent that they are not able to be objective in their approach to the recollection of\n\nevents, some of which occurred many years ago.\n\nWhether other copies existed when it was thought they did, or, whether, in fact, they did represent\n\nwhat is shown on pages 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit 1 may not appear to be significant from the plaintiff’s point-\n\nof-view. He himself testified that pages 2, 3, and 4 of Exhibit 1 represent a reproduction of his work origin-\n\nally composed in 1956, and this evidence itself, if accepted, is sufficient to permit the finding the plaintiff\n\nseeks. This basic but essential position of the plaintiff must be viewed in the light of that taken on behalf of\n\nthe defendants against it. This includes a consideration of several matters which relate specifically to Exhibit\n\n1 and, as well, others of a more general nature which have a direct bearing on the plaintiff’s credibility.\n\nAs I have already said, it is pages 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit 1 which are relevant. At the top of page 2, the\n\nplaintiff has written “Variations on a Theme in A Minor” and the date, “10/11/62”. On page 2 of Exhibit 1,\n\nafter a one-bar introduction, the theme, in A Minor, begins. This continues to bar 10, after which there is a\n\nRoman numeral I. Following a pick-up note in bar 11, there are seven bars before a Roman numeral II is\n\nnoted at the top of page 3 and over bar 18. Following a comma at that point, there are seven more bars until\n\na Roman numeral III is noted above bar 24. Thereafter, there are 16 bars ending in the third “system” of the\n\nfour systems on page 4. There are six more bars to the conclusion at the end of the fourth system on page 4.\n\nWith respect to Exhibit 1, there does not appear to be any dispute but that bars 2 to 10 inclusive represent\n\nthe first statement of the theme or melody. Likewise, there is no dispute that bars 11 to 17 inclusive are in-\n\ntended to represent the first variation, but there is a dispute as to whether, in fact, it is a variation of the ori-\n\nginal theme. It is these bars, 11 to 17, which the plaintiff claims form the melody of Moment of Love. At\n\nbar 18, over which is Roman numeral II, the seven bars which follow express another variation of the theme\n\nfound on page 2. The 16 bars following Roman numeral III, starting midway on page 3, are intended to rep-\n\nresent another variation of the theme found on page 2. I think it is understood by all parties that the\n\nplaintiff’s use of the Roman numerals was intended to note or mark what he claims are three variations of the\n\nmelody or theme found in bars 2 to 10 on page 2 of Exhibit 1. (I note here that the words “theme” and ”\n\nmelody” have been used interchangeably throughout the trial — I will use “melody” hereinafter)\n\nThe plaintiff, in his examination-in-chief, said that the music of Hardy, which he first heard, and ul-\n\ntimately became known as The Homecoming, represented all that which he wrote in Exhibit 1 with the ex-\n\nception of bars 11 to 17 inclusive, and a short introduction and conclusion. On cross-examination, he spe-\n\ncifically referred to the 16 bars following Roman numeral III as being that which he heard in the Hardy mu-\n\nsic. This part of Exhibit 1 was identified throughout the course of the trial by all parties as “variation three”.\n\nHardy was retained in August of 1972 by an advertising agency (“gency”) to produce a musical score\n\nfor a television commercial it was then in the process of creating. After reviewing what is known as the\n\n“story board”, which demonstrates the subject matter of the commercial, Hardy was asked to create a suit-\n\nable piece of music. The product being promoted was tea. Hardy testified that he was, at this time, heavily\n\nengaged in the writing of music for television commercials and “jingles”, and that all of his work was done\n\nat his home where he had a piano and a tape recorder. He said that over the next few days he composed the\n\nmusic and immediately recorded the result. The tape was taken to the agency for approval, which was re-\n\nceived shortly thereafter. The final arrangement of the music to be included in the commercials was made in\n\nNovember or December of 1972.\n\nAccording to Peter Lighthall (“Lighthall”), who, in 1972, was the assistant producer of communica-\n\ntions for the agency and involved in the making of the commercials, there were, in fact, three commercials in which the music which Hardy provided to the agency was used. The first, described at trial as “The Birth-\n\nday”, was aired from the 7th of January, 1973 through to March, 1975. The second, described at trial as “The\n\nTaxi”, was also aired on television on the 7th of January, 1973 but ended in June, 1975. The third, described\n\nat trial as “The Church”, was first broadcast on the 27th of April, 1973 and was last played in July of 1974.\n\nLighthall said that all three commercials received “considerable air time”, and that the public response was\n\nsuch that the sponsor received many requests for a recording of the music. Hardy was asked to expand his\n\nmusic which, for the purpose of the commercials, was 16 bars in length, in order to permit a 45 r.p.m. record\n\nto be produced. This was done and, eventually, the name The Homecoming was given to the music in the\n\nspring of 1974. According to Hardy, the name was chosen by his wife who, it appears from the evidence,\n\nwas the first person to have heard the music written by Hardy for the commercials. He said, and she agreed,\n\nthat almost as soon as it was written it was played for her. Hardy said it was his custom to have his wife\n\nlisten to all his music as it was being written in order to obtain her reaction. The music which Hardy wrote\n\nfor the commercials was not entered as an exhibit at trial, except for being included in all three commercials\n\nwhich were shown on several occasions throughout the trial. Sheet music for The Homecoming was entered\n\nas Exhibit 39 and used, along with cassettes and recordings, for the purpose of comparison by a number of\n\nwitnesses who testified. The sheet music for The Homecoming indicates that that music is written in the key\n\nof C Major. There is no dispute amongst the parties or their witnesses that Exhibit 1 demonstrates a variety\n\nof keys, with the original statement of the melody being in the key of A Minor, and that which is known as\n\nvariation three being, in part, in G Major and, in part, in C Major.\n\nBy the conclusion of the trial, there seemed to be no disagreement that the music for Moment of\n\nLove had been written by the defendant Rudy Toth in late 1970. He had been asked by his brother, the de-\n\nfendant Jerry Toth, to compose two musical numbers for an album which Jerry Toth was then in the process\n\nof producing for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Also, there appeared to be no dispute that Rudy\n\nToth composed the “thematic material” while a passenger on an airplane travelling from Toronto to Win-\n\nnipeg. He finished the composition very close to the time of its recording, which was later in 1970, and for\n\nwhich it was entitled Moment of Love. As has been mentioned above, the plaintiff maintains that the\n\nmelody of Moment of Love was copied from bars 11 to 17 inclusive of Variations. These are found on pages\n\n2 and 3 of Exhibit 1 and were referred to by all parties, during the course of the trial, as “variation one”.\n\nThe plaintiff moved to Huntsville, Ontario in December, 1972 to take up employment as a pianist at\n\nDeerhurst Inn. He continued in that role thereafter until sometime shortly before testifying at this trial. In\n\nAugust of 1974, a recording of one of his “live” performances was made. The record, an album entitled\n\n“Ivan Plays Favourites”, was entered at trial as Exhibit 7, and I shall refer to it as such hereinafter. One of\n\nthe several pieces included in the album is titled “Theme and Variations” which was understood by all of the\n\nparties to be a performance of Variations. The plaintiff said that it was the day after Exhibit 7 was made that\n\nhe first saw and heard a commercial which showed a church and involved music which he recognized as his.\n\nExhibit 7 is the only recording made of Variations and, according to the plaintiff, was available for purchase\n\nonly at Deerhurst Inn. Although no evidence was adduced as to how many copies have, in fact, been sold,\n\nthe evidence does not suggest that there were many.\n\nGustav Ciamaga, Dean of the Faculty of Music, University of Toronto, testified on behalf of the de-\n\nfendants. He said that his reaction to a reading of Exhibit 1 and hearing the plaintiff play Variations on Ex-\n\nhibit 7 is that variation three did not seem to be arranged or composed by the same person who composed\n\nthe remainder of the music in Exhibit 1. Specifically, he considered that the accompanying left hand in vari-\n\nation three does not seem to be the work of the same composer who wrote what he described as the “bland\n\nblock chords” on page 2 of Exhibit 1. He described the notational practice involving the three eighth notes\n\nfound in the first expression of the melody to be inconsistent with that in variation three where they are tied.\n\nAlthough he said either practice was acceptable, he found it unusual for a composer to make this change within one piece of music. He said he was extremely puzzled by what he described as anomalies which\n\n“leaped off the page”, and went on to describe some, including the fact that the piece is set in A Minor and\n\nvariation one is in C Minor. He said he found variation one to be a different piece entirely, not a variation\n\naccording to his understanding of that term as it applies to music. There was no doubt in Dr. Ciamaga’s\n\nmind that when the plaintiff made his only recording of Variations in 1974, that which is shown as variation\n\nthree of Exhibit 1 was not included. His overall impression of Exhibit 1 is that it is a “scissors and patch\n\njob”, and “amateurish”.\n\nJames Dale was also called on behalf of the defendants. He is a musician, well-schooled formally\n\nand practically, who has also composed and conducted. His interest is primarily with modern and popular\n\nmusic. He shares Dr. Ciamaga’s opinion that variation three as found in Exhibit 1 demonstrates a higher de-\n\ngree of musicianship than the remainder of the exhibit and “appears to be the work of another person”.\n\nAnother musician called on behalf of the defendants is Douglas Riley. He has a similar background\n\nand involvement in music to that of Dale. He also expressed the opinion that “it doesn’t sound like the same\n\nperson wrote it to me”, when asked to compare variation three with the balance of that which is written on\n\npages 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit 1. He said it is “suddenly more sophisticated writing that has been written in any\n\nprevious statements of the theme”. He finds that which is noted on page 2, being the first statement of the\n\nmelody, “virtually unplayable”, and that the person who wrote that would not write variation three. He said\n\nthere is “too great a contrast in too short a time”. He went on to state that he doubted the authenticity of Ex-\n\nhibit 1, saying: “I believe it has been tampered with”. He suggests that variation three was written at a differ-\n\nent time than the first expression of the melody. He said that he “didn’t believe” the plaintiff was the author\n\nof variation three.\n\nDale and Riley, like Dr. Ciamaga, couldn’t understand why the plaintiff, while recording Variations,\n\ndid not play that which is shown in variation three. The fact that he did not underlies the position taken by\n\ncounsel for Hardy and Productions that an inference can be made that variation three was not written at the\n\ntime the recording was made in 1974 but, rather, at sometime after the plaintiff had heard Hardy’s music.\n\nAs evidence that casts further doubt on the plaintiff’s contention that all that is shown in Exhibit 1\n\nwas written at one time, in 1962, counsel for Hardy refers to part of the testimony of Riley. Riley stated that\n\nwhile he was at Deerhurst Inn in 1977, he was approached by the plaintiff who then suggested that the de-\n\nfendants had “borrowed” his music. The plaintiff played his piece for Riley in order to demonstrate what\n\nhad been borrowed by the defendants. Riley said that “on that occasion the plaintiff played what is recorded\n\n….. he never went to major when he played for me”. I take his statement “what is recorded” to mean Exhibit\n\n7, and “never went to major” to refer to the fact that variation three is, in part, in G Major and, in part, in C\n\nMajor, while the recording of Variations on Exhibit 7 is, as I have said before, in C Minor only. Of equal, if\n\nnot greater, significance to the position of the defendants, as to the genuineness of Exhibit 1 and its coming\n\ninto being when the plaintiff maintains it did, is the absence of there being any note or record of its existence\n\nat any time prior to this trial. Specifically, in 1965, when applying to BMI, the plaintiff listed many songs\n\nwhich he claims to have written, but Variations was not included. At trial, he attempted to explain its ab-\n\nsence by the fact that it was not finished at that time. However, he was not able to explain why “Merry-\n\nGo-Round”, another of his musical works which, according to him, at the time of trial, was not finished\n\neither, was included.\n\nCounsel for Hardy also asks that the plaintiff’s claim to have first seen the commercial after having\n\nmade Exhibit 7, his record, be rejected. In this respect, he points to the evidence of the witness Lighthall that\n\nthe commercial in which a church was prominent (the one the plaintiff claimed to have seen), was not aired\n\nafter July, 1974. The plaintiff claims to have made his record in August of that year. In addition, as further\n\nsupport for this position, counsel for Hardy refers to the evidence of the witness Alan Lowry. He had known the plaintiff since 1965 or 1966 when he took music lessons from him. Lowry testified that in 1973 he had\n\ntold the plaintiff about the commercial and the similarity of the music to that which he had heard the\n\nplaintiff play on many occasions following their first meeting.\n\nIn their final analyses of why all claims and contentions of the plaintiff in this action should be rejec-\n\nted, counsel for all the defendants submit that little, if any, credibility be attached to the evidence of the\n\nplaintiff as it bears on the issues raised in this action. There were cited to me a number of instances wherein\n\nthe plaintiff either changed his evidence from that which he had given previously, either in the proceedings\n\nleading to trial or at trial, or, which were demonstrated to be not true, or, were so improbable as to be worthy\n\nof no weight. An example of the latter was the position taken by the plaintiff in an effort to explain why\n\nVariations did not appear as an opening or closing theme in his recording Exhibit 7 when he had maintained\n\nthat he always used it as such in all live performances. His statements made on various occasions as to the\n\nextent of his formal education generally and, specifically, with respect to music were shown, at trial, to not\n\nbe true and with no explanation being given whatsoever for there having been made.\n\nI am inclined to agree with the position of the defendants concerning the credibility of the plaintiff.\n\nTo my mind, the overall effect of his evidence at trial is that it leaves a great deal to be desired. I find that\n\nthe plaintiff was inclined to say things which he thought would promote his best interest without regard for\n\nactuality, factuality, or, on some occasions, the truth. There were many involved in giving evidence on his\n\nbehalf, and some I have indicated above, who were caught up in the promotion of the plaintiff’s case to such\n\nan extent that they lost much of any objectivity they might otherwise have about the matters in issue. The\n\nplaintiff himself was the worst offender, in my opinion. In making my findings of credibility with respect to\n\nthe plaintiff, I am conscious of his condition, both physical and mental, at the time of giving his evidence.\n\nHis condition may have had some adverse effect on his ability to recall accurately at times, but did not, in\n\nmy opinion, cause him to go to the length he did in an effort to promote his position.\n\nWhile I am prepared to accept the position of the defendants that I should doubt that variation three\n\nwas written at the same time as the balance of Exhibit 1, I do not find it necessary, for the purposes of de-\n\ntermining the issues raised in this action, to express any opinion as to whether someone other than the\n\nplaintiff was its composer. I say this mindful of the fact that insofar as the Hardy music is concerned, the\n\nplaintiff ultimately isolated his complaint to the 16 bars of variation three. I am not at all certain that he in-\n\ntended this restriction to be placed on his case by making this statement in cross-examination. It is not diffi-\n\ncult, from my point-of-view, to look upon this statement as another example of the plaintiff saying\n\nsomething for the express purpose of advancing his case without realizing what it is that he, in fact, has said\n\nhaving regard to the totality of the evidence. Notwithstanding this statement, I think it is only fair to look\n\nupon the plaintiff’s case as being a complaint that the melody of The Homecoming and that of Moment of\n\nLove were copied from his work Variations, whether it be as stated in Exhibit 1 or otherwise. Furthermore,\n\nand as the case unfolded at trial, the position of the plaintiff is not that the copying occurred as a result of\n\nthat which is written in Exhibit 1 being seen by either Hardy or Rudy Toth. As I have noted above, there is\n\nno suggestion that at any time, apart from those copies about which specific evidence was led, there was any\n\npublication of the plaintiff’s written work in any form that could be or, in fact, did come into the possession\n\nof any of the defendants. The allegation of copying then, as I understand it from what was said on behalf of\n\nthe plaintiff and, in particular, in argument by his counsel, is that the work of the plaintiff was heard on oc-\n\ncasion or occasions by the defendants and, thereafter, copied. To my mind, it is for this reason that much\n\ntime was spent at trial considering a comparison between the principal melody of Variations with that of\n\nThe Homecoming and the melody contained in variation one with that of Moment of Love.\n\nBecause the plaintiff’s cause of action was founded upon the provisions of the Act, I think it appro-\n\npriate that here I outline the sections which I consider relevant. Section 2, in part, read In this Act …..\n\n‘every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work’ includes every original production in the lit-\n\nerary, scientific or artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression, such as books,\n\npamphlets, and other writings, lectures, dramatic or dramatico-musical “works, musical works or com-\n\npositions with or without words, illustrations, sketches, and plastic works relative to geography, topo-\n\ngraphy, architecture or science; ….. ‘infringing’, when applied to a copy of a work in which copyright\n\nsubsists, means any copy, including any colourable imitation, made, or imported in contravention of this\n\nAct; …..\n\n‘musical work’ means any combination of melody and harmony, or either of them, printed, reduced to\n\nwriting, or otherwise graphically produced or reproduced;\n\n‘performance’ means any acoustic representation of a work or any visual representation made by means\n\nof any mechanical instrument or by radio communication;\n\nSection 3 (1):\n\nFor the purposes of this Act, ‘copyright’ means the sole right to produce or reproduce the work or any\n\nsubstantial part thereof in any material form whatever, to perform, or in the case of a lecture to deliver,\n\nthe work or any substantial part thereof in public; if the work is unpublished, to publish the work or\n\nany substantial part thereof; and includes the sole right ….\n\n(d) in the case of a literary, dramatic, or musical work, to make any record, perforated roll, cinemato-\n\ngraph film, or other contrivance by means of which the work may be mechanically performed or de-\n\nlivered;\n\n(e) in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to reproduce, adapt and publicly\n\npresent such work by cinematograph, if the author has given such work an original character; but if such\n\noriginal character is absent the cinematographic production shall be protected as a photograph;\n\n(f) in case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to communicate such work by radio com-\n\nmunication; and to authorize any such acts as aforesaid.\n\nSection 4 (1):\n\nSubject to this Act, copyright shall subsist in Canada for the term hereinafter mentioned, in every ori-\n\nginal literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, if the author was at the date of the making of the\n\nwork a British subject, a citizen or subject of a foreign country that has adhered to the Convention and\n\nthe Additional Protocol thereto set out in Schedule II, or resident within Her Majesty’s Realms and Ter-\n\nritories; and if, in the case of a published work, the work was first published within Her Majesty’s\n\nRealms and Territories or in such foreign country; but in no other works, except so far as the protection\n\nconferred by this Act is extended as hereinafter provided to foreign countries to which this Act does not\n\nextend.\n\nSection 5:\n\nThe term for which copyright shall subsist shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Act, be\n\nthe life of the author and a period of fifty years after his death.

R.S., c. 55, s. 22.\n\nI have also considered a number of the reported authorities British, American and Canadian, includ-\n\ning opinions of text writers, to which I was referred by counsel. From these, I have drawn a number of legal\n\nprinciples which I adopt and apply in reaching my decision in this case. One, of great persuasive authority,\n\nis a decision of the English Court of Appeal, Francis, Day & Hunter Ltd. et al v. Bron et al, [1963] 2 All\n\nE.R. 17. At p. 27, Diplock, L.J. states:\n\nFirst, as to the law; ….. it is well established that to constitute infringement of copyright in any literary,\n\ndramatic or musical work there must be present two elements: First, there must be sufficient objective\n\nsimilarity between the infringing work and the copyright work, or a substantial part thereof, for the\n\nformer to be properly described, not necessarily as identical with, but as a reproduction or adaptation of\n\nthe latter; secondly, the copyright work must be the source from which the infringing work is derived.\n\n….. But, while the copyright work must be the source from which the infringing work is derived, it need\n\nnot be the direct source; ….. there must be a causal connexion between the copyright work and the in-\n\nfringing work. To borrow an expression once fashionable in the law of negligence, the copyright work\n\nmust be shown to be a causa sine qua non of the infringing work.\n\nSome of the authorities, and particularly the American, in discussing copying, refer to it as being\n\neither conscious or unconscious. Whether it be found to be one or the other, none of the authorities suggest\n\nthat there can be an infringement without a causal connection between the work in which copyright is\n\nclaimed to subsist and the alleged infringing work or works. At page 28 of the Francis Day case, Diplock,\n\nL.J. says:\n\nIf the existence of the copyright work has no causal connexion with the production of the alleged in-\n\nfringing work, even though the latter be identical with the former, there is no infringement of copyright\n\n.\n\nIf there is found to be no causal connection and, therefore, no copying, either conscious or uncon-\n\nscious, then, any similarities, however strong, which are found to exist between the works must be deemed\n\na coincidence. The word “copying”, in its ordinary usage, connotes a conscious, intended, or deliberate act.\n\nUnconscious copying occurs, then, in the absence of any of these elements, but, of necessity, with the re-\n\nquired evidence of de facto familiarity with the work alleged to be copied. As is stated by Diplock, L.J. on p.\n\n27, after referring to subconscious copying:\n\nWe know not whether it is rare or common, general or idiosyncratic, nor indeed whether it is possible to\n\nremember, not a mere isolated phrase, but a ‘substantial part of’ the remembered work without remem-\n\nbering that one is rememberi\n\nThe most recent case in which a finding of infringement of copyright was made on the basis of “un-\n\nconscious copying” is an American one, Bright Tunes Music Corp. v. Harrisongs Music Ltd., 420 F. Supp.\n\n177 (1976). In that case, it was claimed that the song “My Sweet Lord” was plagiarized from an earlier one\n\n“He’s So Fine”. District Judge Owen, of the United States District Court, S. D. New York, found both works\n\n“virtually identical except for one phrase”. The use of an identical grace note in the same place was con-\n\nsidered significant. George Harrison, the composer of My Sweet Lord, denied consciously copying He’s So\n\nFine, and his position was accepted by Judge Owen. However, he found that Harrison was aware of He’s So\n\nFine because of the extent of its popularity in both the United States and England at a time when other\n\nsongs, either written by Harrison or played by the group of which he was a member, the Beatles, were also\n\npopular in both those countries. Owen, J. says, at p. 180:\n\nWhat happened? I conclude that the composer, in seeking musical materials to clothe his thoughts, was\n\nworking with various possibilities. As he tried this possibility and that, there came to the surface of his\n\nmind a particular combination that pleased him as being one he felt would be appealing to a prospective\n\nlistener; in other words, that this combination of sounds would work. Why? Because his subconscious\n\nknew it already had worked in a song his conscious mind did not remember. Having arrived at this\n\npleasing combination of sounds, the recording was made, the lead sheet prepared for copyright and the\n\nsong became an enormous success. Did Harrison deliberately use the music of He’s So Fine? I do not\n\nbelieve he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, it is clear that My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He’s\n\nSo Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He’s So Fine. This is, under the law, infringe-\n\nment of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.\n\nJudge Owen, in concluding as he did, was following earlier American decisions which had been outstanding\n\nfor many years. One was particularly applicable, namely: Fred Fisher Inc. v. Dillingham, 298 F. 145, a de-\n\ncision of Judge Learned Hand of the same court, made in 1924. Judge Hand accepted the position of the\n\nfamous composer Jerome Kern that he was quite unconscious of any plagiarism in composing the accom-\n\npaniment to the refrain of “Kalua”. It was claimed, and found, by Judge Hand that his work contained a mu-\n\nsical figure identical to that of the other work “Dardanella” which could not be the result of coincidence. The\n\nwork in which copyright was claimed there had attained popularity prior to Kern’s composition being writ-\n\nten. Judge Hand said, at p. 147:\n\nWhether he unconsciously copied the figure, he cannot say, and does not try to. Everything registers\n\nsomewhere in our memories, and no one can tell what may evoke it. On the whole, my belief is that, in\n\ncomposing the accompaniment to the refrain of ‘Kalua,’ Mr. Kern must have followed, probably uncon-\n\nsciously, what he had certainly often heard only a short time before.\n\nIn the present case, several witnesses, with varying degrees of interest, knowledge, or training in\n\nmusic, were called on behalf of the plaintiff to express their opinions as to the composer or author of certain\n\nwork or works and the similarities existing between them. In this respect, and I might say it applies to both\n\nthe plaintiff’s case and that of the defendants, resort was made to a visual examination of sheets of music, in\n\nsome instances enlarged for demonstration purposes, the playing of records and cassette tapes, and a piano.\n\nWhere necessary, a tape of what witnesses played on the piano and their comments while doing so was made\n\nfor the record of the trial proceedings. Nearly a dozen people, including the previously mentioned witnesses\n\nRobson, Pagliuso, and Febbo, were called to give evidence on behalf of the plaintiff to the effect that the\n\nmelody which they heard upon the playing of Exhibit 7, the plaintiff’s record, while they were in the witness\n\nbox, was first heard by all of them before 1973, and by at least one of them, as early as 1962. Furthermore,\n\nand without being told beforehand whose work was being played or by whom, all of these witnesses recog-\n\nnized it as a melody which they had heard the plaintiff play from as early as 1962 but, in the main, in the\n\nmid-1960’s. Their opinions in this respect were obtained only after a playing of Exhibit 7, although some at-\n\ntempted, upon hearing the record, to equate it with the music which appears in Exhibit 1. All of them were\n\nable to discern a similarity between the melody played by the plaintiff on Exhibit 7 and that of The Home-\n\ncoming, and between variation one and that of Moment of Love.\n\nThe position taken on behalf of the plaintiff is that the similarity between the works is so striking\n\nthat the only conclusion to be reached is that the works of the defendants were copied from that of the\n\nplaintiff. I am prepared to accept that all of these witnesses, and as I have said, with one going back as far as\n\n1962, heard the plaintiff play, on a variety of occasions and times thereafter, a melody similar to that heard on the playing of Exhibit 7. I am also prepared to find, and I don’t think there is any disagreement between\n\nthe parties on this fact, that the melodies which the plaintiff purports to be his are similar to those claimed\n\nby the defendants to be theirs. This is particularly so with the comparison between the principal melody of\n\nVariations and that of The Homecoming. For the purpose of this judgment, I am even prepared to say that\n\nthey are strikingly similar, to my ear, whereas, the similarity between variation one and Moment of Love,\n\nagain, to my ear, and I think, to those of others testifying at trial, is less. I arrive at this conclusion mindful\n\nof statements which have been made on several prior occasions that the question of infringement involves a\n\ndetermination of whether the substance of the original work is taken or not by the ear as well as by the eye.\n\nDr. Paul McIntyre, Director of the School of Music, University of Windsor, was called to testify on\n\nbehalf of the plaintiff. He was frank to admit that he was engaged on behalf of the plaintiff as an expert wit-\n\nness “in a case which was put to me as a plagiarism case ….. I took as my assignment to look for identical or\n\nclosely resembling passages.” In fulfilling his assignment, Dr. McIntyre compared Exhibit 1, pages 2, 3 and\n\n4 with the music shown in Exhibit 39, the sheet music for The Homecoming, and Exhibit 58, the sheet mu-\n\nsic for Moment of Love. He also looked at other exhibits entered on behalf of the plaintiff which included\n\nother versions of Variations, but found them such as to not assist him in his assignment. He resorted to Ex-\n\nhibit 1 for his comparison. He also listened to Exhibit 7 and recordings of The Homecoming and Moment of\n\nLove. His primary purpose was to compare the melodies and determine if, in his opinion, there was plagiar-\n\nism on the basis of what he saw and heard. It was Dr. McIntyre’s opinion and the basis of his presentation at\n\ntrial that the passage of Exhibit 1 which he used for comparison purposes with The Homecoming “do not re-\n\nsemble each other. They are virtually identical.”\n\nHe prepared two charts to assist in his presentation, one with respect to The Homecoming and the\n\nother with respect to Moment of Love. With respect to The Homecoming, he concluded that it was a piano\n\npiece in which the melody is presented several times in a slightly varied form. He found the first nine bars to\n\nbe an introduction in which reflections of the melody occur but not the melody. Of the remaining 55 bars, in\n\n32 he found the melody present and in 23 where the melody as a full statement is not present. For his com-\n\nparison purposes, Dr. McIntyre used variation three as contained in Exhibit 1 as the plaintiff’s original\n\nmelody. He then transposed this melody into the key of C Major from G Major, down a fifth. The Hardy\n\nmelody, already written in C Major, he wrote down an octave. Having done that, he compared the notes\n\nfound in the first seven bars of variation three to the melodic passage beginning at bar 10 of The Homecom-\n\ning. He concluded that the notes so examined as common to both melodies, in his opinion, have not only the\n\nsame pitch but the same duration or rhythmic structure. In the bars examined, he concluded that of a total of\n\n26 notes the first 25 are identical. It is his opinion that the chances of this happening without one work hav-\n\ning influenced the other is “infinitesimal, virtually zero, in the order of one in 100 million.” With respect to\n\nMoment of Love, he indicated that following the first note, which he found is not common, he concluded\n\nthat the notes of the next three bars, and the first note of bar 5, and all the notes in bars 6, 7, and 8 are com-\n\nmon as to pitch and duration. It is his opinion that the chances of this happening, again, are “infinitesimal,\n\nnext to zero, one in the order of 100 million.”\n\nDr. McIntyre admits that the portion of Exhibit 1 which he used for comparison with The Homecom-\n\ning does not appear on Exhibit 7, the record “Ivan Plays Favourites”. He further admits that the part used\n\nfor comparison is in a major key whereas Exhibit 7 is in C Minor. He also notes that Variations begins in A\n\nMinor. Dr. McIntyre admits, having regard to the object of his involvement in this matter, that his comparis-\n\non charts represent the result of his effort to find and demonstrate identical passages in the two works. He\n\ncannot find any others. To the ear, his comparisons produce a similar sound, that is, melodies which are\n\ncommon, and visually, they are similar as well. To that extent, Dr. McIntyre has succeeded in carrying out\n\nhis assignment.\n\nVariations or The Homecoming. He replied: “My attempt was to find melodies that might have influenced\n\neither of these composers to put down the melodies they put down. My primary source for that was a pair of\n\nbooks edited by Mr. Barlow, I think it is Harold Barlow. One is called ‘Dictionary of Musical Themes’ and\n\nthe other is called ‘Dictionary of Opera and Vocal Themes’. Each contain about 10,000 themes or tunes or\n\nmelodies. They are cross-indexed by pitch. I could find nothing that could reasonably be interpreted as, may\n\nI say, a common source”. In cross-examination counsel for the defendants played a cassette tape entitled\n\n“Generic Nature of Tunes” which was put together by the witnesses Riley and Dale. It consisted of passages\n\nfrom eleven musical works played on a piano. The first passage was not recognized by Dr. McIntyre, but he\n\nfound it strikingly similar to the melodies of Variations and The Homecoming. The second he also found\n\nstrikingly similar but did not recognize the music. The third he recognized as the theme from “The Fox”\n\nwritten in the late 1960’s by Lilo Schifrin. In his opinion, the similarities he found with that music were less\n\npronounced than with the first two. The fourth he did not recognize and did not find strikingly similar or\n\nsimilar. The chord progression, however, he found to be the same as the compositions under consideration.\n\nHe preferred to call it a variation. He agreed that if someone heard the fourth selection they might well pro-\n\ngress to write something such as Variations. The fifth selection Dr. McIntyre found similar to both Vari-\n\nations and The Homecoming, but not strikingly similar. It also was identical in chord progression to both. In\n\nthe balance of the selections put to him, apart from finding some similarity in certain of them in chord pro-\n\ngression or sequential repetition, Dr. McIntyre could not find any comparison to the three melodies under\n\nconsideration. Dr. McIntyre was not asked nor did he volunteer any explanation for his not being able to find\n\nthese similar works himself in the efforts which he made in this respect.\n\nDr. Ciamaga and the witnesses Dale and Riley were not able to conclude that there was any similar-\n\nity between the three musical works under consideration. Their approach in this respect, however, was on\n\nthe basis of a comparison which was much broader, an in-depth examination, looking at the whole of all of\n\nthe pieces as opposed to isolated passages, and from the point-of-view of composition, structure, harmony\n\nand melody. Dr. Ciamaga; particularly, discussed the use of “cliches” and “common place” in the composi-\n\ntion of modern western music. He found these to exist in the works under consideration. That there are sim-\n\nilarities in modern music does not, in his opinion, suggest influence of one work or more on others. Further-\n\nmore, in light of the fact that the first 50 years of the twentieth century have produced approximately half a\n\nmillion popular songs with copyright, he finds it hard to believe, as a composer of music, that all of them\n\nwere original. In his opinion, the popular song tradition is an aspect of tonal tradition which, very early, set\n\nout its own rules and delimited the amount of material available to a composer and the number of harmonic\n\nprogressions. He specifically disagrees with Dr. McIntyre’s statistics concerning those passages of the works\n\nwhich he considered as being composed without one influencing the other. He believes that two people\n\ncould have written Variations and The Homecoming without reference to one another. He said: “It is pos-\n\nsible for two composers in two different places to deal with compositional materials in a similar way in\n\nwhich the melodies between the two works are similar, the harmonies between the two works are similar.”\n\nAs I have noted above, it is the plaintiff’s position that the melody of Moment of Love was copied\n\nfrom variation one of Exhibit 1. It was also the position of the plaintiff, at least, at the commencement of tri-\n\nal, that the defendants Toth were all involved in the scheme by which this copying was made, and that, cent-\n\nral to it, was the recording Exhibit 7. The plaintiff alleged that Chris Toth, son of Rudy Toth, and a fellow\n\nemployee of the plaintiff at Deerhurst Inn in the summer of 1975, obtained a copy of Exhibit 7 for his father.\n\nIn addition, the plaintiff maintained that Chris Toth had heard him play Variations on a number of occasions\n\nat Deerhurst Inn and that, through his hearing of Variations being performed and the playing of the record,\n\nwas able to assist the defendant Rudy Toth, who also heard the record, compose Moment of Love. Chris\n\nToth denies ever purchasing or obtaining or having in his possession a copy of Exhibit 7, or to seeing it at\n\nany time in his home or cottage, which is close to Deerhurst Inn. Chris Toth also denies ever recalling hear-\n\ning the plaintiff play Variations at any time or anywhere, and maintains he is not possessed of the ability to translate into musical notes that which he hears or has heard. In any event, the specific theory of the plaintiff\n\ninsofar as all the Toths are concerned was significantly weakened, if not destroyed when the plaintiff adop-\n\nted as part of his own case the evidence of Rudy Toth that he wrote Moment of Love some four years or\n\nmore prior to the plaintiff making the record from which he claims it was copied. In any event, I accept all\n\nof the evidence of the defendants Toth, and in particular, wherever it conflicts with any of that given by or\n\non behalf of the plaintiff.\n\nDuring the course of the trial, it became apparent to all that the action as against Chris Toth could\n\nnot succeed. I had anticipated that he would have been removed from the action prior to the conclusion of\n\nthe trial, but he was not. Counsel for the plaintiff agrees that the action as against the defendant Jerry Toth\n\ncan only succeed on the basis of his having performed the work of the plaintiff. In July of 1965, the plaintiff\n\nagreed to assign to BMI all of his rights with respect to the public performance and right to adapt, arrange\n\nand record for a term which, I find, was still outstanding at all relevant times to the issues in this action. The\n\neffect of this agreement is that the plaintiff has no cause of action against Jerry Toth, in any event, by reason\n\nof any public performance, arrangement, or recording of any work of the plaintiff. The result, then, appears\n\nto be that the plaintiff’s claim against Jerry Toth remains based upon an alleged copying of the plaintiff’s\n\nwork, which must be unconscious. The allegation of conscious copying, which involved Exhibit 7, I have\n\nnow disposed of against the plaintiff.\n\nInsofar as the defendants Hardy and Productions are concerned, the plaintiff does not make any al-\n\nlegation of conscious copying on their part. At this point, I raise the question of why Productions is a de-\n\nfendant in this action. There appears to be no evidence to involve it in any infringement of any copyright\n\nwhich the plaintiff has in Variations. Insofar as Hardy is concerned, the plaintiff’s cause of action against\n\nhim rests upon an allegation of unconscious copying. The plaintiff’s position in this respect is that Hardy\n\nheard the plaintiff perform Variations on one occasion, as a result of which the alleged plagiarism occurred.\n\nThe plaintiff testified that on Friday evening September 25, 1970, while performing as a pianist at Sutton\n\nPlace Hotel, he played Variations as his “second last piece” of the evening. When he finished his perform-\n\nance, and in the process of leaving the room where he was playing, he stopped at a table where two men and\n\na girl were seated. One of the men asked him: “What was the second last piece played?” The plaintiff testi-\n\nfied that his response was: “It’s one of my own. It’s a classic”. The conversation ended with the other man\n\nsaying: “It’s very nice”. About a year later, while the plaintiff and his wife were attending another cocktail\n\nbar in the City of Toronto to hear a long time acquaintance play piano, the plaintiff testified he recognized\n\nthe man he spoke to on that occasion in September, 1970 as the defendant Hagood Hardy, who was playing\n\nat the cocktail bar with his musical group then known as The Montage. Hardy, apart from denying in evid-\n\nence generally that he had ever seen or met the plaintiff or heard or seen any of the plaintiff’s music, spe-\n\ncifically denied that he met the plaintiff or heard him play at the Sutton Place Hotel, either as the plaintiff\n\nclaims or otherwise. Hardy called evidence as to his activities on that date in September. He was involved in\n\na recording session that would have kept him in a studio until close to 9:00 p.m. Without the evidence of the\n\ndefendant Hardy in this respect, I would not be prepared to accept that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s evid-\n\nence on this point, like the rest, is highly improbable, not credible, and I specifically reject it. I accept the\n\nevidence of the defendant Hardy, in any event, wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff.\n\nCounsel for the plaintiff urges me to conclude that the similarity between the work of the plaintiff\n\nand Hardy and the plaintiff and Toth is so similar that I should conclude copying from that fact, even in the\n\nabsence of evidence from which I can find or infer copying, whether conscious or unconscious. Having dis-\n\nposed of the allegation of conscious copying against Toth, and in light of the fact that no such allegation was\n\nmade against Hardy, I am, therefore, left, as I have said before, to deal with unconscious copying in respect\n\nof both Hardy and Toth.\n\nThe law is clear that in order to substantiate a finding of infringement on the basis of unconscious copying, there must be evidence of access or a causal connection between the works. Counsel for the\n\nplaintiff asked me to consider that this is not the law, and maintained that it is that a strong or striking simil-\n\narity, as in the present case, alone, is sufficient to support a conclusion of infringement. In this respect, he is\n\nable to refer me to one authority only, and that is a 1972 paper prepared by Jeffrey G. Sherman entitled: “Mu-\n\nsical Copyright Infringement: The Requirement of Substantial Similarity”. From my reading of that paper,\n\nI must conclude that the learned author, although making this suggestion, does not refer to any authority in\n\nsupport. Counsel for the plaintiff referred me to one case; but a reading of it discloses it to be a judgment\n\nreached on default of a defence and, consequently, not of much persuasive authority, in any event, to offset\n\nwhat otherwise appears to be a well-entrenched principle of law. To support unconscious copying on the\n\npart of the defendants Hardy and Toth, plaintiff’s counsel referred me to the fact that they, like the plaintiff,\n\nworked extensively in and about Toronto and that, accordingly, I should infer that at some time, at some\n\nplace, they heard the plaintiff’s work. This I will not do in this case.\n\nI accept the evidence of Rudy Toth that he had never heard of the plaintiff’s work prior to his writing\n\nMoment of Love in 1970. I have already said I accept Hardy’s evidence that he had no opportunity to be in-\n\nfluenced by the plaintiff’s work in composing The Homecoming. Having rejected, then, that the defendant\n\nHardy and the defendant Rudy Toth copied any part of the work of the plaintiff, the similarity which I have\n\nfound to exist between them must, of necessity, be the result of coincidence. As I have noted above, Dr.\n\nMcIntyre had expressed the opinion that the similarities which existed between the works of the defendants\n\nand that of the plaintiff were such that the one had to have influenced the writing of the others. In saying\n\nthis, he made no mention that the similarities could be due to coincidence To my mind, the effective result\n\nof Dr. McIntyre’s testimony is that a striking similarity exists between the works, and that, his exercise\n\nshows this to exist in the passages which he has isolated for consideration. As I have said before, I accept\n\nthat similarity does exist, but I do not agree that this means that the one has to have influenced the other. I\n\naccept the evidence of Dr. Ciamaga that the similarities in the melodies of the works under consideration do\n\nnot, without something more, permit a conclusion that the one influenced the others. I was impressed by Dr.\n\nCiamaga’s testimony concerning musical cliches or common place, and the support of his position in this re-\n\nspect given by two, obviously, talented and knowledgeable musicians, Dale and Riley. They had put togeth-\n\ner the cassette upon which the eleven pieces, which Dr. McIntyre was asked to comment upon, are con-\n\ntained. Dr. McIntyre’s reaction to the playing of those pieces I have noted above. The first, which he de-\n\nscribed as “strikingly similar”to the melodies of the plaintiff and Hardy, was a piece “Je ne Songeais pas a\n\nRose”, composed in 1969 by a Belgian. The second, which Dr. McIntyre described as being “strikingly sim-\n\nilar”, was a passage from the song “What Was Good Enough for Me”, composed in 1967. The third I have\n\nalready noted he recognized as being the theme from”The Fox”. The fourth, which Dr. McIntyre did not re-\n\ncognize or find similar in any way, was a passage from Vivaldi, who lived between 1675 and 1741. To my\n\near, the passage from Vivaldi alone would be sufficient to support the opinions of the witnesses Ciamaga,\n\nDale and Riley. I found it to be very similar to the melodies of the works of the plaintiff and Hardy. I don’t\n\nneed to comment on the balance of the passages found on that cassette except to say that those which are in-\n\ntended to relate to the melody of Moment of Love are not very similar, to my ear. The playing of those pas-\n\nsages that are similar is relevant, not to support any defence of public domain, which was not raised in this\n\naction, but rather, the issue of coincidence. In this respect, for the purposes of this judgment, I am prepared\n\nto find that all of the works have the required degree of originality necessary to give rise to a claim for copy-\n\nright. That the defendant Rudy Toth wrote Moment of Love in 1970 as he did, in the complete absence of\n\nthe work of the plaintiff, in itself, provides an example of coincidence for he was not in any way involved\n\nwith or connected to Hardy. I think that a general statement, well applied to the circumstances of these ac-\n\ntions, is that which was made by Judge Learned Hand in Darrell v. Joe Morris Music Co., Inc., et al, 113\n\nFederal Reporter, 2d Series, p. 80:\n\nIt must be remembered that, while there are an enormous number of possible permutations of the music-\n\nal notes of the scale, only a few are pleasing; and much fewer still suit the infantile demands of the pop-\n\nular ear. Recurrence is not therefore an inevitable badge of plagiarism.\n\nThe counterclaim, which was brought on behalf of Jerry and Rudy Toth, in the second action must be\n\ndismissed. There is no evidence that the plaintiff, in composing Variations, had any access to the work of\n\nRudy Toth. For this reason alone, the counterclaim cannot succeed.\n\nThe first action will, therefore, be dismissed with costs. The second action will also be dismissed\n\nwith costs, and the counterclaim therein dismissed without costs. From all of the evidence, I conclude that\n\nhad the plaintiff been entitled to any relief in either of the actions, by virtue of the provisions of Section 22\n\nof the Act, it would have been limited to an injunction. I do not find it necessary to deal with the issue which\n\nwas raised on behalf of the defendant Hardy concerning the provisions of Section 24 of the Act.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 Appellee contends that appellant has no standing to bring this case since he had assigned his ownership of the copyright on at least two occasions prior to suit. Given the dearth of the evidence on proof of copying, we find it unnecessary to reach the issue of ownership."
