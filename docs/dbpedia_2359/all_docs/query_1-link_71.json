        "text": "Friday's Class 4A, District 10 final started slowly but built to a dramatic climax.\n\nBlake freshman Ariel McDaniel stepped to the free-throw line with 1.3 seconds remaining and a chance to tie the game. She sank her first shot, but her second was off the mark, giving Armwood a 44-43 victory.\n\nIt was McDaniel's steal and assist to teammate Janet Howard that allowed the Yellow Jackets to tie the game with 20 seconds left. But Armwood's Lexi Balkman scored off an inbounds play with 13 seconds left for a 44-42 lead. On the Jackets' final possession, McDaniel hustled to save the ball just before it went out of bounds and was fouled.\n\n\"All I ever ask the girls is to play hard and put us in a position to win the game, and they did that,\" Blake coach Rudy Toth said. \"We played well, and we have almost everyone coming back next year.\"\n\nArmwood coach Joe Morris said his sixth-ranked Hawks (23-3) were lucky to avert the upset.\n\n\"We didn't come out like we usually do,\" he said. \"We were cold from the perimeter. We had defensive lapses, and we made mental mistakes. A good team like Blake takes advantage of those mistakes.\"\n\nMorris said his team expected Blake (13-14) to press early, but when it didn't, the tempo of the game slowed. Armwood led 6-5 after the first quarter.\n\nThe Hawks tried to get the ball inside to Jeralynn Campbell as often as possible, but their cold outside shooting allowed Blake to collapse on her. Down the stretch, Armwood relied on Balkman for inside scoring, and she responded with 12 points. Campbell led all scorers with 20.\n\nIn the fourth, Howard took charge for the Yellow Jackets, scoring eight of her 17 points. Kemma Kellum also stepped up her scoring in the fourth before fouling out with 10 points.\n\nArmwood will host a regional quarterfinal game Thursday against the loser of tonight's District 9 final between Lakewood and Largo.\n\nBlake, meanwhile, will travel to play the District 9 champ.\n\n5A-8: Durant in final\n\nAt Lakeland, Durant defeated Plant City 58-49 to advance to the district final. The Cougars, who got 25 points from Liz O'Connor and 13 from Shelley Hill, face Lakeland Jenkins, a 70-37 winner over Lake Region in the other semifinal, in today's final at 7:30 p.m. at Jenkins."
