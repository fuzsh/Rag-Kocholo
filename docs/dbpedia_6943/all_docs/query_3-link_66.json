        "text": "The double eagle at the top points towards the Austrian(-Hungarian) empire.\n\nBut above that is a Erbritterkrone with only three pearls (well, actually four, three of them visible…). This is apparently unique to Italy.\n\nThe gryphon then\n\nThe griffin, griffon, or gryphon (Greek: γρύφων, grýphōn, or γρύπων, grýpōn, early form γρύψ, grýps; Latin: gryphus) is a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and sometimes an eagle's talons as its front feet. Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts and the eagle the king of birds by the Middle Ages the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature. Since classical antiquity, Griffins were known for guarding treasure and priceless possessions.\n\nHeraldic significance\n\nIn heraldry, the griffin's amalgamation of lion and eagle gains in courage and boldness, and it is always drawn to powerful fierce monsters. It is used to denote strength and military courage and leadership. Griffins are portrayed with the rear body of a lion, an eagle's head with erect ears, a feathered breast, and the forelegs of an eagle, including claws. These features indicate a combination of intelligence and strength.[22] In British heraldry, a male griffin is shown without wings, its body covered in tufts of formidable spikes, with a short tusk emerging from the forehead, as for a unicorn. The female griffin with wings is more commonly used.\n\nCurious are the just five rays for the three stars. That would be the \"English\" type, the \"German\" style would often feature six or even more. As the creature stands on a single hill it might be connected to alpine or subalpine regions, and the little tree or shrub it touches might indicate forestry as the main source of income or field of oversight / economic significance?\n\nFrom that I would conclude that early 19th century, Habsburg, Italy (From South Tyrol to Venetia?), low nobility are the connections to observe. But that is not from the mound at the bottom but from the crown at the top. But that is uncertain.\n\nThe Italian Wikipedia says that Cavaliere ereditario:\n\nHereditary knight is a noble title very peculiar, granted in Italy in the territories subject to Austrian or Spanish domination (in particular in Lombardy, Sicily and Sardinia), mainly in favor of all the males of a family.\n\nAccording to the regulation of the Italian Heraldic Council, the title of Hereditary Knight is the lowest of the hierarchy, placed at a level immediately lower than that of Noble citizen . In contrast, in the German-speaking countries that had been part of the Holy Roman Empire the title of Hereditary Knight was superior to that of a nobleman and was placed at a level immediately below that of a baron/lord.\n\nAs the Sardinian and Sicilian areas do not come into question and Piedmont is too far West for it will have to be Lombardy? More specifically, other coats of arms in the region with some similarity seem to centre around Brescia. Capriano del Colle, Chiari, Concesio, Marmentino, Marcheno, Offlaga and Pian Camuno.\n\nPian Camuno coat of arms\n\nCapriano del Colle coat of arms\n\nOther are too deviating on their stars but may be worth a look too."
