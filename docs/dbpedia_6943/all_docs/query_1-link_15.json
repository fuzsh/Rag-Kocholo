        "text": "The Theodosian walls were built in the early fifth century CE, under Emperor Theodosius II, whose Theodosian Code, the most important collection of Roman laws after Justinian's Code, we also have. Initially Constantinople was protected by the walls erected by Constantine, but the city's expansion and barbarian threats prompted the imperial government to erect a second, even more massive circle of walls. They thus became the largest Roman walls ever built. Over the centuries the walls underwent further modifications, eventually becoming a triple barrage by land and sea (with even a chain pulled into the Golden Horn) that made the city impregnable-thanks in part to the invention of Greek fire-until the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Later, in 1261 the Byzantines managed to retake the city and held it until 1453, when after nearly two months of siege it fell to Ottoman hands. Signs of Turkish cannonade can still be seen today.\n\nMap of the Historical evolution of the Holy Roman Empire - The Holy Roman Empire was a complex political entity that existed in central Europe for most of the medieval and early modern periods and was generally ruled by a German-speaking Emperor. The states that composed the Empire, while enjoying a form of territorial authority called Landeshoheit that granted them many attributes of sovereignty, were never fully sovereign states in the sense that term is understood presently. In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 such territories, the majority being tiny estates owned by the families of Imperial Knights.\n\nMap of the Historical evolution of the Holy Roman Empire - The Holy Roman Empire was a complex political entity that existed in central Europe for most of the medieval and early modern periods and was generally ruled by a German-speaking Emperor.

You can August yourself, a city, a state, even an entire nation. August us means you are augusting the group you’re a part of. And, now that it’s officially the month of August, this is fitting. “Augustus (born September 23, 63 BCE—died August 19, 14 CE, Nola, near Naples [Italy]) was the first Roman emperor, following the republic, which had been finally destroyed by the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, his great-uncle and adoptive father. His autocratic regime is known as the principate because he was the princeps, the first citizen, at the head of that array of outwardly revived republican institutions that alone made his autocracy palatable. With unlimited patience, skill, and efficiency, he overhauled every aspect of Roman life and brought durable peace and prosperity to the Greco-Roman world. He is one of the major figures of Classical antiquity.” (Brittanica.com) D. J.
