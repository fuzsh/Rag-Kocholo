        "text": "Chapter - Cross\n\nThe cross on which Jesus our Lord and Savior died for our sins is the most commonly recognized and most universally accepted symbol for Christianity the world over. It symbolizes God’s great sacrifice, an offer of salvation to all of humanity and the promise of the Resurrection.\n\nThere are three different styles of crosses Jesus might have died upon. Scholars are not completely sure as to which style it was. The first style is the Tau cross. It is in the shape of a “T”. The second style is referred to as the Latin cross. This cross is the most popular representation of the cross today and most likely the form Jesus died upon. The final style is the Y-shaped cross. This cross is not as popular as the first two, but still an option.\n\nTradition tells us that the cross our Savior died upon was made of four different types of wood. The four types of wood where chosen by the Jews for their lasting properties, so that Jesus might hang on the cross forever. The footrest of the cross was made of cedar for its durability and resistance to rotting. Other woods used were the cypress, for its pleasant aroma that would offset the stench of death, the palm, a symbol of victory and olive wood for the inscription, a symbol of the peace that would follow after Jesus was dead.\n\nDuring the early days of the church, the cross as a Christian symbol was rarely used. Believers did not want to think about their Savior’s death. It was, after all, the instrument upon which He died.\n\nIn the year 325 A.D. Constantine the Great conquered the Roman Empire and made Christianity its main religion. Christians no longer had to hide from the authorities or suffer grusome deaths for their faith. As peace spread throughout the empire, the popularity of the cross as a Christian symbol spread with it.\n\nThe cross of Jesus was supposedly found by Constantine’s mother, Helena, on May 3, 328 A.D. Tradition tells us it was buried deep underground where it was found with the other two crosses. Jesus’ cross was easily separated from the others when a woman who was sick touched one of the crosses and was instantly healed. Today the location of these crosses is unknown.\n\nCrosses fall into two major categories: the Greek (equal length arms) or Latin (shorter cross bar raised above the center). All crosses are variants of these two forms and quite a few variations there are indeed. F. R. Webber estimates that there are 400 different forms of the cross, with 50 of them playing a prominent part in the decoration of our churches and parishes. The main reason for so many cross variations was the use of the cross in heraldry. Heraldry was the art of creating and displaying coats of arms during the Middle Ages. Each knight wearing armor of similar make and style could not distinguish friend from foe. Cross variations were adopted by each knight to be worn on their person for easier identification. The majority of crosses in this chapter are taken from heraldry. It should be noted that there is a bit of confusion regarding such crosses. Erroneous records and various spellings have lead to a great deal of confusion over the identities of some crosses. The author has done his best to list each cross accurately.\n\nBesides heraldry, crosses have been used in all sorts of ways. They have accompanied names on contracts to show the trustworthiness of the deal. They were placed in market places to remind merchants to treat their customers fairly. Crosses have been used as floor plans for churches and scratched or painted on the walls of churches to keep evil spirits at bay. They have most noticeably been used to mark the graves of those who claimed the promise of eternal life in Christ.\n\nTHE CROSS ADORNED – A cross that is decorated with lilies or floral arrangements.

In this way the symbol would not look blatantly Christian, concealing its Christian meaning from all but the informed few.\n\nTHE CROSS ANKH (Crux Ansata) – A Latin or Tau cross with a loop extending from the top.

The bottom bar is based on Eastern teachings that when Jesus was crucified, His feet were nailed apart, not placed together as the Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches teach.
