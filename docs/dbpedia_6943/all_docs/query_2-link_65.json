        "text": "The arms of Denmark are: Or, strewn with 9 hearts, 3, 3 and 3 Gules, three lions passant Azure, crowned Or, langued Gules.\n\nThe first peoples in present-day Denmark of which heraldic symbols are known are the Herules who probably lived on Sjælland and Fyn, and the Cimbri who lived in North Jutland. Both of these peoples had intensive contact with the Romans, the Herules attacked the coast of Gaul in 409 and the Cimbri were defeated in the battle of Vercellae (101 BC). Nevertheless, in the fifth century we still find auxiliary troops consisting of Herulen and Cimbri in the Roman armies. Their shields are depicted in the Notitia Dignitatum. Under the inscription \"Heruli\" there is a shield with a red circle on a white field with red bordure. For the Cimbrin, there is a shield under the title \"Cimbriani\". It is red with a yellow center and an equally yellow border.\n\nThe Herules settled in the fifth century in present western Slovakia. Their leader Odoakar defeated the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 and became King of Italy. In the sixth century, however, they were expelled and many took service in the Byzantine army, including that of Belisarius.\n\nByzantine influence can be traced in the lion depicted on the famous Jelling Stone. On this three-cornered stone there is a lion and a snake on one side, on the other side a man with spread arms (crucifix) and on the third a text. The text reads: King Harald had these memorials erected for Gorm, his father, and Tyra, his mother, the Harald who united all Denmark and Norway and converted the Danes to Christianity. On the side with the griffin is the part of the text with all Norway. The Harald is Harald I Blue Tooth (940-986). The side with the lion must date from the death of Harald II Graycloak ( 974) of Norway, when Harald could subject the population of Norway.\n\nReconstruction in color of the figure on the Jelling Stone\n\nAt this time a lion may have been the distinguishing sign of a comes in the Byzantine army, a commander who had an army division of 500 to 200 men under his command.\n\nA similar figure, dating from half a century later, has been found in London on the St. Pauls Rune Stone.\n\nIt is not clear why Harald opted for a lion, while he as well could have chosen for an eagle, which would correspond more to his royal rank, or even a dragon. See for this: Norway.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Valdemars.\n\nThe coat of arms of Denmark is the coat of arms of the Valdemars, Kings of Denmark from the House of Svend Estridsen. In its basic form it appears for the first time on the countersealof Knud IV from 1190. In the first centuries the details, as usual in early European heraldry, are constantly changing. It is only at the beginning of the nineteenth century that the form is definitively established.\n\nThe number of lions has remained the same throughout the centuries. Until the codification of 1819 they could be depicted both passant and passant guardant without any preference.\n\nThe lions were originally uncrowned, as can be seen on the seal of Knud IV. In 1232, under the reign of Eric IV, they were crowned. Afterwards they only occur once without a crown.\n\nA single example is known where the lions hold the \"Danebrog\", namely. on a version of Erik van Pommeren's coat of arms.\n\nThe hearts are called water-lily leaves in some Medieval texts (danish: Søblade). In a manuscript from 1306, the coat of arms of the Counts of Halland are described as± Desuptos leopardus est campus, continens sparsos flores, qui dicuntur \"Søblad\".\n\nApart from that, hearts are spoken of throughout the ages, and it is only in the nineteenth century that the name water-lily leaves (Søblade) is preferred.\n\nThe hearts first appear on the already mentioned counter-seal of Knud IV and then have the shape of the familiar hearts, indeed they have on a seal of Erik, count of South Jutland more the form of what one with a good will a leaf of the yellow lump. Historically, however, the figure that is called heart is certainly meant and the shape on the seal of Erik van Jutland also leans against the ancient examples of\n\nthe figure.\n\nThe number of hearts on the shield varies considerably until 1546. In that year the number is fixed at nine. Before that, the shield is \"studded with hearts\" where the number depends on the space left by the lions on the shield and the size the artist chooses.\n\nThe colors of the arms have remained the same throughout the centuries. The oldest image in color is in the Wijnbergen Roll of Arms from time of the government of Erik V Klipping (1259-1286). ) Other old colored images can be found in the General Chronicle of Saxony from the end of the 13th century, on wall paintings in Ringsted and Næstved from about 1320 and in the Gelre Roll of Arms. The crowns are gold, nails, tongues and hearts red.\n\nFrom later times there are no images known where the colors are different.\n\nCrest and Crown\n\nA crest specifically for the warriors from the Danish royal house appears for the first time on the seal of Christoffer, the son of Erik V Klipping and the later King Christoffer II (1330-'32), from 1293. It consists of two horns. with four small fans of peacock feathers. In the Gelre Roll of Arms the lambrequines and the horns are ermine.\n\nThe arms were crowned for the first time on the seal of King Olaf II from 1376. In the codification of 1819 this crowned coat of arms became the small national arms.\n\nIn 1960 a legal distinction was made between the national coat of arms and the royal coat of arms. a distinction that de facto already had existed much longer.\n\nLater Developments: The arms of Eric of Pomerania and of Christoffer III Wittelsbach.\n\nIn 1387 the last King of the lineage of Svend Estridsen, Olaf II, died. His mother, Margarethe I, appointed a grandson of her sister, Erik of Pomerania, in 1397, as a successor to the Danish throne.\n\nFrom Erik of Pomerania King of Norway from 1387, and in 1397 also King of Sweden, various seals are known in which the coat of arms of the Valdemars appears. With that, it had become the arms of a territory instead of the arms of a family, since Erik was not related to the House of Svend Estridsen.\n\nOn his heraldic seal, which he used from 1398 to 1435, five heraldic symbols were united, namely the arms of his kingdoms and the coat of arms of Pomerania, which he had inherited from his father. The arms are:\n\nArms: Quartered by a silver cross: 1. Or, three lions passant Azure crowned of the first, langued and ungules Gules together keeping the Danebrog (Denmark); 2. Azure three crowns Or, 2 and 1 (Sweden); 3 Bendy wavy Argent and Azure, a lion rampant Or (Folkunge); 4 Agent, a griffin reversed Gules, billed and clawed Or (Pomerania). And on an excutcheon in fess point; Gules, a lion Or with an axe of a blade Argent and a handle of the first in its claws (Norway).\n\nThe white cross is derived from the white cross of the banner of the Holy Roman Empire on which it stands on a red cloth. The Danebrog is identical to this and it means that Denmark was considered to be a part of the Holy Roman Empire. According to the legend, borrowed from the vision of Constantine before the battle of the Milvian bridge in 312, it would have appeared in the sky at the battle of Lyndaniz against the pagan Estonians in 1219. [1]\n\nIn fact, the cross appears for the first time on the seal of Waldemar III Atterdag (\"Dawn\") of 24 February 1356. [2] This is also the year in which the Golden Bull, a kind of Constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, was drafted by Emperor Charles IV (1355-'78).\n\nThe political grounds on which the relationship with the Holy Roman Empire was emphasized at the time, were not investigated here, but Waldemar profiled himself with a seal on which there is a coat of arms with a cross between the letters of his name, emphatically as a liege man of the Empire. This was in line with the designation by Frederick Barbarossa of Sven III as First King during the Danish Civil War (1152), alongside his rivals Knud III and Waldemar I, the Great\n\nCanute IV (c. 1042  10 July 1086), later known as Canute the Holy: (Knud IV den Hellige) or Saint Canute (Sankt Knud), was King of Denmark from 1080 until 1086. Canute was an ambitious king who sought to strengthen the Danish monarchy, devotedly supported the Roman Catholic Church, and had designs on the English throne. Slain by rebels in 1086, he was the first Danish king to be canonized. He was recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as patron saint of Denmark in 1101.\n\nSeal of Majesty.

Hist. 1. 328. 085\n\nA section of the eagle blanket,\n\nwhich is found in the crypt in Odense Cathedral in 2008, and which is believed to be a gift to the church from the king's widow, Queen Edel, who later married a norman duke in southern Italy (the City Archives).\n\nA publication about the blanket is from:\n\nAnne Hedeager Krag: Ørnetæppet og andre silkefund fra Knud den Helliges helgenskrin i Odense Domkirke. 2010 [4]\n\nThe silk finds from Odense are considered by foreign researchers to be unique among European silk finds from the Middle Ages. The eagle rug and bird pattern on the pillow contain symbols of power, eagle, and immortality, the peacock. These are symbols that can be passed on to power and Christianity. This symbolic language has probably been known by the donor, when the textiles were closed down in the box at the saint's wedding in 1100.\n\nOn June 10, 1086, King Knud IV and his herd were murdered in St. Albani Church in Odense. This event has made decisive traces in the history of Denmark right up to our time, and in the year 1100 King Knud became Denmark's royal saint\n\nOn March 3, 2008, Saint Knuds shrine in the crypt in Odense Cathedral was opened with great attention from the press. There were two reasons for the opening: Lecturer in biological anthropology at the Department of Forensic Medicine, SDU, dr. of medicine Jesper Boldsen had been authorized to examine the saint's bones, and archaeologist and textile researcher Anne Hedeager Krag to get ten small threads of silk from the tomb. These have been analyzed at ICN, the Institute for the Cultural Heritage of the Netherlands in Amsterdam, and the results are seen in this book.\n\nThe silk threads originate from two rare patterned silk weaves, which, just like Knud the Holy's bones today, can be seen in the crypt in Odense Cathedral. A larger piece in red with patterned eagles, eagle blanket, and a yellow pillow with peacock motifs. They are both believed to come from the holy cricket with King Knud, who was sanctified in 1100. The silk textiles are believed to be gifts from Knud's widow Edel, who was married to a Norman Duke in southern Italy and brought home by King Erik I Ejegod (Evergood), who in 1098 visited Rome and Southern Italy. Next to King Knud's sanctuary stands another shrine, which can have contained the king's brother Benedict. In this shrine are two solid yellow silk cushions, one short and one long.\n\nThe book is about the textiles from the two burial shrines. The text includes new color analyzes of the silk textiles as well as an interpretation of their subject content, style and application on a broad European basis in the light of recent research. The new color analyzes show that the Odense silks are colored with six different plant colors, two red, two blue and two yellow. One of the yellow color items is rarely seen in Denmark. These are Persian berries of the genus Rhamnus, which give a saffron yellow color which, in addition to the Odense silks, has been proved in one of Frederik III (1648-1670) suits, which are found in the collections at Rosenborg.\n\nIt is probably this saffron yellow silk that is referred to in the Englishman Ælnoth's chronicle, which is written about 20 years after the canonization and the sanctification of King Knud - the saffron yellow color described in the written source from ca. 1120 corresponds with the natural sciences color analysis made almost 900 years later in 2008.\n\nThe eagle, here of Byzantine design, is the badge of rank of a consul and in Western roman context of a king in his military function. It was the badge of some of the predecessors of Knud IV and of many other kings.\n\nThe peacock pillow from the shrine of St. Knud.\n\nDrawing by Magnus Petersen, 1875 (Burman Becker 1886). after Hedeager Krag 2010: fig. 9.\n\nThe decoration consists of anchors supported by peacocks separated by hearts.\n\nThe peacock is a badge of the office of a prefect or a vicar on the level of a roman diocese. Therefore the eagle and the peacock can be displayed together.\n\nThe anchor is usually the emblem of the navy and therefore should be connected with his command of his raid to England in 1075.\n\nThe heart may be the badge of his function, for which a primicerius, or a proedros dekanos (president of the chiefs of ten), is proposed, durimg that raid."
