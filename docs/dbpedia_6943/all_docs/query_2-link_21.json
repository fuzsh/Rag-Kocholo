        "text": "А\n\nAcorn\n\nThe sign of the acorn in heraldry has traditionally been used to indicate independence in its bearer. It can be found slipped and leaved; the acorn-sprig is not uncommon as a crest and acorn-cups are represented alone.\n\nThe acorn is usually vert (green) but it can also be other colors.\n\nAllocamelus\n\nAn allocamelus is a creature with the head of a donkey joined to the body of a camel. It is extremely uncommon in heraldry.\n\nAmphiptere\n\nAn amphiptere is a winged serpent found very rarely in heraldry, though it does exist as a supporter and as a charge on a shield occasionally.\n\nAmphisboena\n\nAn amphisboena is a winged serpent with two legs and a head at both ends of its body; however, the drawing of this creature does not strictly follow this description.\n\nIt is very uncommon in heraldry.\n\nAnchor\n\nThe anchor is the emblem of salvation and hope. It is also an appropriate device for the coat of arms of a family with a seafaring tradition. It is a common figure in the English armor, which is not surprising given that Britain is an island.\n\nIt was even a device that was once born by King Richard I.\n\nMaritime devices are found less often on the continent where many countries are essentially landlocked, but Cosmo de Medici, the Duke of Etruria is an example of a Spanish noble who bore two anchors on his shield.\n\nAnnulet\n\nThe annulet is a plain ring. As a closed circle, it is symbolic of continuity and wholeness. The Romans are said to have worn a ring as a sign of knighthood and rings are still used at some coronations and in the institution of knighthood.\n\nThe annulet may have been borne to indicate that the bearer had the superior qualities of a knight. In some circles an annulet represented riches.\n\nOn English arms, an annulet was a mark of cadency signifying the fifth son.\n\nAnt\n\nThe symbol of the ant traditionally signified one who was a strong laborer, wise and provident in all his affairs.\n\nThe ant is not a very common symbol in heraldry, but when depicted the ant is usually accompanied by a drawing of an anthill.\n\nThe ant may also be referred to as an Emmet.\n\nAntelope\n\nThe antelope which is also referred to as an ibex or a springbok has three main symbolic meanings in heraldry.\n\nIt represents someone who is skillful at music and a lover of harmony, someone with a keen mind for politics and the ability to foresee times and opportunities well, and lastly, a person who is unwilling to assail his enemies rashly, who would prefer to stand his ground than risk harming another wrongfully. Thus, the antelope signifies harmony, polity and peace.\n\nThe antelope has also been used occasionally as an emblem of purity and fleetness.\n\nEarly representations of the antelope did not look much like the real animal, as they were likely drawn from descriptions. That figure is now referred to as a heraldic antelope, as opposed to the later version, which has a more natural aspect.\n\nAntique Crown\n\nThe crown is an emblem of victory, sovereignty, and empire. It is a visible sign of success, thus the term ‘crowning achievement’, and its significance as the decoration of the ultimate level of rank and power, makes bearing the crown a great honor. Crowns are also symbols of God, as he is considered by some to be the ‘King of all’. The word crown, blazoned without any additional details, usually implies a ducal coronet without a cap.\n\nThe eastern or antique crown has a gold rim with eight sharp, triangular rays, only five of which are seen.\n\nIt is given to British subjects who have distinguished themselves in service in the East and it is also often born by merchants, the association being that they are like the magi.\n\nTowns where these merchants had had a long-standing trade also often adopted eastern crowns into their arms.\n\nAnvil\n\nThe symbol of the anvil borne on a shield or coat of arms indicates that the first bearer was a smith. It is rarely found in heraldry.\n\nApe\n\nIn heraldry, the ape is a symbol of sin, malice, craftiness and lust. It is thought to have indicated a moral obligation on the part of the bearer to conquer all sins, and been a reminder of one’s morals, ethics and religion.\n\nThe ape is not a very common symbol in heraldry but when it is found it is usually ‘collared and chained’, with the collar encircling its waist rather than its neck. It is found as a charge on shields and crests, and as a supported in coats of arms.\n\nA story exists that centuries ago, Thomas, the infant son of Maurice Fitzgerald, was snatched from his cradle by a tame ape, carried to the edge of the battlements at the top of the castle and safely returned to his cradle. The Fitzgerald crest commemorates this even with the image of an ape.\n\nApples\n\nApples signify liberality, felicity, peace and salvation. Fruit of all kinds was considered to be evidence of God’s kindness and a symbol of the goodness of providence.\n\nApre\n\nThe apre or après is an imaginary creature with a body that resembles a bull and the tail of a bear. It is extremely uncommon in heraldry.\n\nArrow\n\nThe arrow is said to be a weapon ‘destined for avengement’. In heraldry, Arrows and arrowheads alone symbolize martial readiness.\n\nIn the case of Polish armory, bows and arrows signify a man resolved to challenge himself to the utmost in battle, and who has prepared himself to the fall in the fight.\n\nThe pheon is as specific type of arrowhead of ancient origin, made of fine steel. It is a cleverly designed weapon that was very dangerous since it has a barbed inner edge that makes extraction difficult.\n\nIt symbolizes dexterity and nimbleness of wit, as people with these traits are able to penetrate and understand complicated problems.\n\nArrowheads without barbs, but still having space between the shaft and the arrow itself, are termed ‘broad arrows’ and this distinction is very stringently adhered to.\n\nDevices associated with warfare and military defense are frequently found in heraldry.\n\nB\n\nBadger\n\nThe badger is an animal noted for his fierceness and courage in fighting to defend his home. The image of the badger is a symbol of bravery, perseverance and protection.\n\nIt is not a common symbol in heraldry; however, it is a typically English one.\n\nBagwyn\n\nThe bagwyn is an imaginary animal with a head drawn like a heraldic antelope, the body and tail of a horse and the horns long and curved backwards. It is not commonly found in heraldry.\n\nBalance\n\nBalances have traditionally been a symbol of justice. They are still used today in heraldry as a symbol of an unbiased court system.\n\nBanner\n\nThe banner is a sign of victory and self-assertion. Banners borne on the shield or as a crest are often references to a special military action where a flag was captured, otherwise an indication of gallant service.\n\nBanners may also indicate that a member of that family was once a standard-bearer. There are very specific guidelines on the size of a banner designated for each rank, though it is doubtful whether they were followed very closely.\n\nThe principle distinction between a banner and a flag, standard of pennon etc, is that a banner is always square while the others are elongated.\n\nAs a charge in heraldry the banner is usually hung from the battlements of a castle or carried by the figure of some creature, such as the paschal lamb (a holy lamb with a halo), which is nearly always depicted with a banner.\n\nBarrel\n\nBarrels, casks or tuns were used to hold beer or wine. In heraldry, it is probably borne on arms to indicate that the original bearer was a vendor of beer or wine, or an innkeeper.\n\nIt is usually figured lengthways, but if blazoned a hogshead or a tub it should maybe be drawn upright.\n\nIt is often used as a pun on names ending in ‘ton’, for example the crest of ‘Hopton’ depicts a lion hopping on a tun.\n\nBars\n\nA bar is the diminutive of a fesse, which is a wide horizontal stripe in the center of a shield.\n\nThe rules of heraldry strictly state that there cannot be more than one fesse on a shield so if two charges with this character occur, they are called bars and a single bar is narrower than a fesse.\n\nNarrow, horizontal bars across a shield is said to be an appropriate device for one ‘who sets the bars of conscience, religion, and honor against angry passions and evil temptations.’\n\nThe diminutive of the bar is the barrulet, which is almost always born in a pair of two barrulets, placed close together, referred to as one bar gemel.\n\nBars gamel were awarded for acts of particular bravery in times of war, and a field composed of an even number of bars between four and eight is described as ‘Barry’, with the exact number specified; with end or more it is called ‘barruly’.\n\nBat\n\nThe bat was an intimidating heraldic symbol used to inspire fear in enemies.\n\nIn heraldry, it is usually represented displayed, with wings open and facing the observer.\n\nIt is sometimes blazoned by the old name rere-mouse.\n\nQuoted from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer’s Night Dream, ‘Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings.\n\nBattering Ram\n\nThe battering ram is an ancient war machine that is a symbol of determination, especially in war. The image of the battering ram may have also been granted to someone, who was greatly skilled it its use, or who oversaw it during wartime.\n\nIt is not a device found frequently in heraldry and it does not resemble a real battering ram either.\n\nIt consists of a ram’s head on the end of a log, with ropes encircling it and hooks attached to them, presumably to hold it up.\n\nBattle Axe\n\nThe battle-axe is a symbol of authority and of the execution of military duty. The battle-axe denoted a warlike quality in its bearer.\n\nThe battle-axe was a veering introduced to heraldry as a token of the crusades, which began shortly after the rise of heraldry itself.\n\nThough other axes are used as devices in heraldry, the battle-axe is distinct because of its blade that it firmly mounted on the shaft and penetrates though it to the other side. It is a common symbol on a crest.\n\nBeacon\n\nThe beacon or cresset was an alarm signal placed on high hills, church towers or city gates. On crests it is drawn as an elevated basket overflowing with flames. It was the watchman’s duty to fire it if he saw that the next nearest had been fired. Thus, the warning of an enemy’s approach was conveyed inland from the coast with great rapidity.\n\nIn heraldry, the beacon signifies one who is watchful, or who gives the signal in times of danger.\n\nThe hand beacon or pitch pot and the lantern are also symbols that represent spiritual illumination.\n\nThe metaphorical association is derived from the fact that the light was used for finding one’s way in the dark. It may also indicate that the bearer oversaw warning beacons.\n\nBear\n\nThe bear was thought to possess diplomacy equal to its great strength and it is the emblem of ferocity in the protection of kindred.\n\nIn heraldry, a bear is also a symbol of healing and personal health, strength and bravery.\n\nBears are often in the arms of names that sound somewhat like the animal such as Baring and Barnes. The bear is usually muzzled but not always.\n\nBears ‘paws are also often found as crests or symbols on shields.\n\nBeaver\n\nThe beaver denotes industry, perseverance and determination. It was officially adopted as Canada’s national symbol in an Act passed by the Canadian Parliament in 1975 and is often found in arms granted to families connected in some way to Canada.\n\nBee\n\nIn heraldry, the bee is a sign of industry, creativity, wealth, diligence and eloquence. The Egyptians used it as a symbol of regal power. In armory, it is used to represent well-governed industry.\n\nThe Emperor Napoleon gave the bee considerable importance in the French armory by adopting it as his personal badge. They also appeared on the mantle and pavilion around the armorial bearings of the empire, as well as on his coronation mantle.\n\nThe bee is undoubtedly the most popular insect found in heraldry, and even the beehive occurs often as a crest.\n\nBell\n\nBells signify the supposed power of church-bells to disperse evil spirits in the air and their invocation of guardian saints and angels.\n\nA hawk’s bell would denote one who feared not to signal his approach in either peace or war.\n\nA Canterbury bell is a sign of pilgrimage.\n\nA bell is assumed to be a church-bell unless it is blazoned otherwise.\n\nBend\n\nThe bend is a broad, diagonal band across the shield representing either a scarf worn like a sash, or the shield suspender of a knight or military commander.\n\nIt has often been granted to those who have distinguished themselves as commodores.\n\nThe bend signifies defense or protection and is a bearing of high honor. Unless it is specified otherwise the bend is assumed to go from the upper right corner of a shield to the lower left.\n\nThe bend sinister follows the opposite diagonal.\n\nAccording to old theorists the bend should occupy one third of the surface of a shield, though it is usually drawn slightly more narrowly than this.\n\nA charge half the width of a bend is termed a bendlet, and if six or eight of these pieces occurs on a shield it is termed ‘bendy’, though the mark of illegitimacy though the number must be specified.\n\nThe bend sinister has been used occasionally as a mark of illegitimacy though this is not commonly the case. More often a bendlet sinister is used, or a baton sinister, which is a bendlet that does not extern to the very edges of the shield.\n\nBezant\n\nThe bezant was the coin of Byzantium.\n\nIt is represented by a gold roundel, a roundel being a general name applied to any circular charges of color or metal. It is thought that the bezant, also sometimes called a talent, was introduced into armory at the time of the Crusades.\n\nIt is the emblem of justice and of equal dealing among people. In heraldry, the sign of the bezant is borne by those deemed worthy of trust and treasure.\n\nBillet\n\nThe billet represents a letter folded for transmission. It has the form of a plain rectangle and it occurs more frequently when a field of a superior charge is described as billette or seme, which means that there are many small billets distributed over it, alternating in the pattern of bricks.\n\nIn heraldry, it may indicate that the man granted a coat of arms with this charge was a man whose words and deeds were deemed trustworthy. It has also been suggested that lawyers and men of letters often adopted the sign of the billet.\n\nThe best-known instance where this charge was used was in the shield borne over the arms of England during the joint reign of William and Mary.\n\nBoar\n\nThe boar and its various parts are frequently met with in heraldry. The boar is the symbol of intrepidness.\n\nA champion among wild beasts, he encounters enemies with nobility and courage, and has thus come to signify the traits of bravery and perseverance.\n\nThe boar is a fierce combatant when at bay and never ceases to resist, even when cornered. This device was given only to those considered fierce warriors.\n\nA wild boar is referred to as a sanglier though there isn’t any difference from a domestic boar in the way that it is drawn.\n\nA Boar may be drawn whole in various positions or couped.\n\nBooks\n\nIf open, as in the arms of the University of Oxford, the book signifies manifestation.\n\nIf it is closed, as in those of the University of Cambridge, it signifies counsel.\n\nBooks are also a general symbol of learning in heraldry.\n\nThe bible is frequently mentioned as the book represented in the crest or arms, though it would not appear any differently than a regular book. Books may also have clasps or seals that must be mentioned in the blazon.\n\nBordure\n\nThe bordure is, as it sounds, a wide border around the outside of a shield. Except for in more modern grants where the bordure is an original part of the shield, there is little doubt that the bordure is either a mark of cadency, displaying the status of a younger son or brother, or a mark of illegitimacy.\n\nIn heraldry, the bordure is no longer used for these purposes; except for in England where a bordure wavy is still a mark of illegitimacy and the bordure company serves the same purpose in Scotland.\n\nThis is by no means a mark of dishonor though; it is merely a heraldic tradition carried over from the days when it was necessary to distinguish the rightful heirs from others who might have some claim to the family title and fortune.\n\nThe orle is the diminutive of a bordure and looks like the frame of a shield within the shield rather than a border. It is about half the width or a bordure. When charges are placed around the outside of it, they are said to be ‘in orle’.\n\nIt was used as a mark to distinguish the arms of one branch of a family from those of another, and in some cases the orle was used as a symbol of honor.\n\nBucket\n\nThough their appearance is quite different, the function and symbolic meaning of a water-bouget and a bucket are similar in heraldry.\n\nA water-bouget is a bag made from the skin of a goat or sheep what was used for carrying water on military expeditions. The apparatus looks like a yoke with two large bags hanging down from it and a stick that goes through both attachments to form handles on either side.\n\nThe drawing evolved over time and its latest form is more symbolic than realistically drawn.\n\nWater-bougets and buckets were conferred on those who had supplied water to an army of a besieged place. The bucket is merely the more modern way of transporting water. The common well bucket is usually the type born in arms, but they can also be hooped or have feet.\n\nThey are also sometimes blazoned dossers, a term that indicates two buckets hooked to a loop and carried over the back of a pack animal.\n\nBuckle\n\nThe buckle signifies self-defense and protection, as well as victorious fidelity in authority. The buckle appears quite often in heraldry, sometimes oval shaped, circular of square; they are most often shaped like a heraldic lozenge, though, or a diamond with sides of equal length, especially in the armory of the continent.\n\nA buckle occurs in the arms of the Prussian Counts of Wallenrodt, and it is used as a badge by the Earls of Yarborough and Chichester.\n\nBull\n\nA bull in a coat of arms, on a crest or a shield, represents valor and magnanimity, bravery and generosity. The horns represent strength and fortitude.\n\nOxen, and cows also appear on some crests and arms, although rarely and more often as a pun on a name such as Oxford or the town of Cowbridge.\n\nCalves are more common in heraldry. The calf is an ancient heraldic symbol traditionally associated with the characteristics of patience, submissiveness and self-sacrifice.\n\nC\n\nCaltrap\n\nA Caltrap or gal trap, and sometimes a cheval trap, was an ancient military instrument with four points, arranged so that when it was thrown on the ground, it always landed on three of the four points, with the fourth pointing up.\n\nCaltraps were scattered in the path of an enemy to impede and endanger the horses. The emblem of the Caltrap in heraldry indicates a fierce warrior in battle.\n\nCamel\n\nThe camel signifies temperance, patience and perseverance. In ancient times it may have been used as a sign of royalty and dignity.\n\nThe camel is blazoned on very few arms.\n\nCameleopard\n\nThe medieval name for an ordinary giraffe was a cameleopard. It was a widely held belief that crosses between animals existed, just as the mule existed and was a cross between a horse and a donkey.\n\nThe camel and the leopard were well known animals at that time and it was likely that a crusader in the east saw an unknown animal and either he accounted for it this way or it was theorized far away at home, that the giraffe was the creature that was begotten by a leopard and a camel.\n\nThe scarcity of these animals was further explained by the knowledge that such hybrids, like the mule, cannot reproduce.\n\nCastle\n\nIn heraldry, the castle has often been granted to one who has faithfully held a castle for his sovereign, or who has captured on by force or stratagem.\n\nThe castle signifies spiritual power and vigilance on the watch as well as home and safety. The tower is very similar to this and is an emblem of grandeur and society.\n\nIt is a symbol of defense and of a steadfast individual.\n\nThe visual difference between a tower and a castle is that a tower is a single column topped by a turret, and a castle usually has two towers joined by a wall with a door in it. This was a distinction that was rarely observed in ancient days, but now it is faithfully adhered to. When smaller towers surmount either a castle or a tower it is called ‘triple-towered’.\n\nCat\n\nA symbol of a great cat, or a cat-a-mountain, which refers to a wildcat, signifies liberty, vigilance and courage in heraldry.\n\nCats can be in many different positions like the lion, but they are most often blazoned passant, walking with right forepaw raised.\n\nA cat-a-mountain is supposed to always be guardant, or on guard, with the head completely facing the observer. Cats are most common in Scottish or Irish arms.\n\nCelestial Crown\n\nThe crown is an emblem of victory, sovereignty, and empire in heraldry. It is a visible sign of success thus the term ‘crowning achievements’ and its significance as the decoration of the ultimate level of rank and power, makes bearing he crown a great honor.\n\nCrowns are also sometimes symbols of God, as he is considered by some to be the ‘King of all’. The word crown, blazoned without any additional details, usually implies a ducal coronet without a cap.\n\nThe celestial crown closely resembles and eastern crown, having eight sharp, triangular rays, only five of which are seen m, with the addition of a five-pointed star on each ray. It was an ornament that frequently represented the achievements of deceased ladies and it was also often given to people or institutions connected with the church.\n\nCentaur\n\nCentaurs are well known creatures that are half man and half horse.\n\nA centaur carrying a bow and arrow is called a Sagittarius.\n\nBoth the Sagittarius and the centaur are quite common in heraldry, especially on the continent.\n\nKing Stephen is said to have assumed the symbol of Sagittarius because the sun was in that sign when he ascended the throne.\n\nThe centaur is a symbol of virility and one who has been eminent in the field of battle.\n\nChains\n\nChains are a symbolic representation of reward for acceptable and weighty service. They are frequently met with in continental heraldry, particularly in southern France and Spain, and they are also accessories to more common charges, for example the portcullis.\n\nThey are often accompanied by crowns and collars, meaning that the owner of that symbol is chained by a sense of obligation to the people that he serves or rules. For this reason, chains and collars are also marks of honor for sheriffs and mayors, and formerly, for knights.\n\nChaplet\n\nA chaplet is a wreath without stems or ribbon, made of oak, laurel or other leaves, and carrying flowers, usually roses. In heraldry, it is a symbol of fame and is frequently part of a crest.\n\nThere is also a chaplet that looks like a plain, broad circlet, charged at four regular intervals with stars, roses or other objects.\n\nA chaplet of oak and acorns is called a civic crown, but more frequently the chaplet is synonymous with wreath or garland, which is commonly made of laurel and roses.\n\nChess-rook\n\nA chess-rook is also called a castle and may have been granted to those who had captured or defended castles.\n\nIt may also have denoted one who was skillful in influencing others to act to his own benefit, as the chess player moves his pieces in the game.\n\nIt is an ancient bearing in heraldry and it also occurs quite frequently. It is a device used by the Earls of Rochford.\n\nChevron\n\nThe chevron occurs very frequently in British and French heraldry and is comparatively rare in German heraldry.\n\nThe chevron represents the foot of a house, derived from the French work ‘chevron’ meaning rafter. It signifies protection.\n\nThe chevron was granted to those who had participated in some notable enterprise, had built churches or fortresses, or had accomplished some work requiring faithful service.\n\nThe chevron used to almost reach the very top of the shield and then more nearly attained the 1/3 of the surface of the shield that was allotted to it by the guidelines of heraldry. Now it is drawn lower and with a less acute inner angle to allow more devices to be represented more attractively, and an artist may draw the chevron at the height and angle that will best suit the accompanying charges.\n\nThe chevronel, is a diminutive of the chevron and is much narrower. Chevronels may be stacked on top of each other or side-by-side at the same height, which is termed, interlaced or braced. A field composed entirely of an even number of chevrons is called ‘chevronny’.\n\nChief\n\nThe chief is a broad band across the top of the shield that stands for authority and domination of will.\n\nThe chief has often been granted as a special reward for prudence and wisdom, as well as for successful command in war.\n\nThe chief theoretically contains the upper 1/3 of the shield, although it rarely actually does.\n\nThe chief is never surmounted by any other ordinary (a simple background symbol) except for in very exceptional cases.\n\nA chief is also never couped (cut off before reaching the edges of the shield) or cottised (surrounded closely by smaller bars), and it has no diminutive.\n\nChimera\n\nThe chimera is a very odd looking creature in heraldry with the head abreast of a woman, the forepaws of a lion, the body of a goat, the hind-legs of a griffin (the legs of a lion and claws of an eagle), and the tail of a dragon. It is not found it heraldry very often and is not unlike the sphinx in many ways.\n\nCloud\n\nThe cloud, the symbol of the ethereal heights of heaven, represents the quality of higher truth.\n\nThey are very seldom used as bearings on arms but quite frequently arms are represented as issuing from them, particularly in French arms.\n\nCock\n\nAs the herald of the dawn, the cock is symbolic of the sun. It is also a bird of great courage in battle that will fight, if necessary, to the death. Therefore, in heraldry, it is an emblem of vigilance and courage.\n\nThe cock is also used as a Christian image of the resurrection. The gamecock in heraldry refers to a slightly different symbol of a cock without its comb and wattles, as was the case when birds were prepared for cockfighting. This symbol is less common, though, than a regular domestic cock.\n\nCockatrice\n\nThe cockatrice is a fabulous king of serpents, with the head and legs of a cock, the wings of a dragon, and a scaly body, also like a dragon, that flows into a long-barbed tail.\n\nIt can also be called a basilisk, of which legends say was produced from an egg laid by a nine-year-old cock and hatched by a toad on a dunghill. Its breath and sight were so poisonous that they would kill all who came within range.\n\nThus, the cockatrice is a potent symbol of terror. The heraldic basilisk is supposed to have a tail that terminates in the head of a dragon, though if such an example exists, it is very uncommon in heraldry.\n\nCockfish\n\nThe cockfish is drawn very much as it sounds with the head and upper-body of a cock terminating in the lower-body and tail of a fish. It is a very uncommon symbol in heraldry.\n\nColumn\n\nColumns symbolize fortitude and constancy. It is a metaphorical heraldic device, implying that its bearer supports others who are weaker.\n\nA serpent coiled round a column signifies wisdom with fortitude. Columns, also called pillars, commonly resemble ones of the Tuscan order bur are often otherwise specified. Plain Norman shafts with cushion capitals can also be found. The capital, the base and the pedestal are sometimes mentioned in the blazon.\n\nComb\n\nIn heraldry, the comb is the common attribute of certain mythical female beings such as lamias, sirens, and mermaids, whose usual pose is with mirror and comb in hand.\n\nIt have sometimes been given to those who were said to have fought or resisted the temptations of such dangerous types, but heraldry the comb more often refers to a wool-comb or the combs used in the textile industry, which is not an uncommon heraldic device.\n\nThe comb with no other specification in the blazon is drawn like a capital ‘I’ on its side with teeth filling in both sides of the spine. The wool-comb, also called a jersey-comb or a flax-comb, looks like a small rake. Another type is the currycomb, though this is exceptionally uncommon and has no definite representation.\n\nCottise\n\nA cottise, or cottice, is a diminutive of an ordinary such as a bend, a pale or a fess, ¼ of the width of that ordinary. In heraldry, it never exists alone, but always accompanies one of the ordinaries.\n\nAn ordinary is said to be cottised when it is set between a pair of cotises and an ordinary may be double or treble cottised with two or three cotises on either side.\n\nThe cotises emphasize the significance of the ordinary and are usually applied to a bend.\n\nCrab\n\nThe crab is a symbol of great strength and power in gripping and holding. It occurs on the coats of arms of several families.\n\nThe sign of the lobster in heraldry is also a symbol of prodigious gripping and holding power in its bearer and the symbols of its claws occur in arms more frequently than its entire body.\n\nAllied to these two charges is the crayfish, which is also referred to as a crevice.\n\nCrane\n\nAccording to legend, cranes lived in a community in where individual members took turns standing watch.\n\nThe sentry crane held a stone in one claw so that if it dozed, the falling stone would wake the bird.\n\nThe crane is a symbol of vigilance, justice and longevity, but nevertheless, there are instances where the crane is depicted dormant (asleep) with its head under its wing, still holding its ‘vigilance’, as the stone is termed.\n\nThe stork and the heron, also called a Herne, are very similar to the crane. Both birds were emblems of filial duty and gratitude or obligation, and like cranes, storks were believed to stand watch for each other.\n\nAll three birds are usually depicted with wings close, the crane in its vigilance and the stork holding a snake, while the heron often holds an eel.\n\nCrescent\n\nThe crescent stands for one who has been ‘enlightened and honored by the gracious aspect of his sovereign’. It is also borne as a symbol of the hope of greater glory in heraldry.\n\nKnights returning from the crusades introduced the crescent, the badge of Islam, into the language of heraldry. The heraldic crescent has a very deep base and curving horns that quickly sharpen to point close together.\n\nCrescents also represent the moon that lights the night sky for travelers, though it does not resemble the shape of a crescent moon very closely. In English arms it’s was also a mark of cadency signifying the second son.\n\nThe reversed crescent is a crescent with the horns turned down. The term in crescent indicates a crescent with the horns facing the observer’s left, and decrescent is a crescent facing the observer’s right.\n\nCrocodile\n\nThe crocodile was a mysterious and legendary beast to most people in ancient times and it was a powerful emblem of fury and power.\n\nThe uncertainty of the drawings means that in reference to the symbol in heraldry, the crocodile is frequently interchanged with alligator.\n\nIt occurs as a crest and a supporter but is, nevertheless, an uncommon heraldic charge.\n\nCrown\n\nThe crown is an emblem of victory, sovereignty, and empire in heraldry. It is a visible sign of success, thus the term ‘crowning achievement’, and its significance as the decoration of the ultimate level of rank and power, makes bearing the crown a great honor.\n\nCrowns are sometimes a symbol of God, as he is considered by some to be the ‘King of all’.\n\nThe word crown blazoned without any additional details usually implies a ducal coronet without a cap.\n\nCrown Vallary\n\nThe crown is an emblem of victory, sovereignty, and empire in heraldry. It is a visible sign of success, thus the term ‘crowning achievement’, and its significance as the decoration of the ultimate level of rank and power, makes bearing the crown a great honor.\n\nCrowns are sometimes a symbol of God, as he is considered by some to be the ‘King of all’.\n\nThe word crown blazoned without any additional details usually implies a ducal coronet without a cap.\n\nA crown palisade is the name of a crown with palisades on the rim forming the spikes of the crown. This can either look like the pickets of a fence, or less correctly, like the silhouette of small houses side by side with every other one upside down, with the roof of each upside down one cut out of the metal.\n\nThe latter description is called a champagne border. It is said that Roman Generals awarded the crown palisado to the one who entered the camp of the enemy first after breaking thorough their outworks.\n\nIt is also called a crown vallary from the Latin vallus, which roughly translates to palisade.\n\nCup\n\nIn the heraldic tradition, the vase and similar vessels are considered symbols of fertility in heraldry.\n\nThe cup, covered or uncovered, is also sometimes representative of the chalice used in the communion or the Mass.\n\nOn the other hand, the chalice used in the Eucharist may be symbolic of a layman’s interest in church government. It may also be used as a symbol of faith.\n\nOther vessels in heraldry include, drinking glasses, bowls, a pitcher, and posts, such as a pot of lilies.\n\nCushions\n\nCushions have been looked on as marks of authority in heraldry and have been borne by several noble families. Cushions appear in heraldry more often that one might think. They appear to be quite ancient symbols, especially in Scottish heraldry.\n\nThe Earls of Moray bore cushions on their arms for example.\n\nF\n\nFasces\n\nThe Roman fasces, or lictors’ rods are a bundle of polished rods bound around a battle-axe.\n\nAW lector was a civil officer who attended and carried the faces before a Roman consul, both to indicate his status as an important person and to clear a way through the crowds.\n\nThus, it indicated a superior magistrate, but it also symbolized the power over life and death that he might have, for example, as a judge.\n\nIn heraldry, this symbol of magisterial office was often included in grants of arms to Mayors and Lord Mayors.\n\nFalcon\n\nIn heraldry, the falcon or hawk signifies someone who was hot or eager in the pursuit of an object much desired. It is frequently found in the coats of arms of nobility, form the time when the falcon played an important social role in the sport of kings and nobles.\n\nIt is found as a heraldic bearing as early as the reign of King Edward II of England.\n\nThe falcon was also the badge of one of King Henry VIII’s wives, Anne Boleyn and was later adopted by her daughter Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe falcon is frequently found ‘belled’, with bells on one or both of its legs. It may also be ‘jessed and belled’ meaning that the jess, the leather thong that ties the bell to the leg, is shown with the ends flying loose; or it may be hooded, which is how falcons were carried on the wrist until flown.\n\nThe falcon is indistinguishable, in heraldry, from the sparrow-hawk, goshawk, kite, or merlin, though they may be described that way in blazon.\n\nThe falcons’ head is a common symbol on a crest; it can also be found preying on something, which is termed trussing, rising or close.\n\nFeathers\n\nFeathers are a very common charge in heraldry, which is not surprising considering that during a tournament helmets were more frequently ornamented with feathers than with family crests.\n\nConsequently, the plume became the actual, inheritable family crest for many families. Feathers signify willing obedience and serenity of mind.\n\nA plume is a term usually reserved for a grouping of five or more feathers. If they are arranged in two rows it is called a double plume, and in three a triple plume, etc.\n\nThe feathers commonly used were ostrich feathers, though on crests they can appear in many shapes and colors for example, the badge worn by John of Gaunt was an ermine ostrich feather.\n\nPeacock continental heraldry feathers often adorn the sides of crests as well as appear as more central charges.\n\nWhen a feather is crossed at the quill by a scroll of parchment it is called an escrol. The is the device that appears on the shields of the Edward the Black Prince, the son and heir of King Edward III, who bore three escrols on a field of black.\n\nThree feathers encircled by a coronet is the current badge of the Prince of Wales, as it has been since the time of Henry VIII.\n\nFer de Moline\n\nA fer de Moline, or mill-rind is the iron clamp in the center of a grindstone that provides support. It represents industry and purpose and may also have been used as the sign of a miller. The mill-rind is also symbolized by the Cross Moline, or ‘miller’s cross’.\n\nFesse\n\nThe fesse is a broad, horizontal band across the center of the shield that represents the military belt and girdle of honor of the ancients. It signifies that the bearer must always be in readiness to act for the wellbeing of the people. It is supposed to occupy a full third of the height of the shield, though it is seldom drawn this way, and it is subject to the lines of partition.\n\nIts position is directly across the center of the shield unless the fesse is described as enhanced or abased. There can only be one fesse on a shield. If more than one is present, they are termed bars.\n\nFetterlock\n\nSome state that the fetterlock is a device for hobbling horses while others say that it is a handcuff or a prisoner’s bolt. Whatever the case, it is an emblem of victory.\n\nThe fetterlock is as honorable bearing in heraldry that may have represented someone in the middle Ages who had taken his enemy prisoner, or who could, by either his prowess or his charity, redeem any of his fellow soldiers ransomed in captivity. It is also referred to by the names of shacklebolt, shackbolt or manacle.\n\nSir Walter Scott represents King Richard I bearing the fetterlock as his device when proceeding to the release of Ivanhoe.\n\nFish\n\nFish are held to be suitable marks for military families as they are symbols of prowess and fortitude. They are also symbols of the forces of industry and science, and emblems of the Christian faith of the bearer, especially in early coats of arms.\n\nThough there are often specific names blazoned on crests and arms with fish, there usually isn’t any consistent difference between the way each fist is drawn in heraldry and often the names are intended as puns on the name of the bearer or are in reference to characteristics of the land owned by that family.\n\nIn ancient times the rolls only mentioned a few variations but later grew to include between thirty and forty different species, such as salmon, haddock, cod, herring, trout, eel, chub, ling, whiting, burbot, roach, and many more obscure types.\n\nIn early arms fish were only drawn upright, or hauriant, but now fish can be found in a wide variety of positions.\n\nFlames\n\nFlames are held to signify zeal, as one may be consumed by zeal as by flames.\n\nFlames are also a symbol of passion, spiritual energy, rebirth and purification.\n\nFlames have often been used as a torture and therefore may signify one who has undergone severe trials, however flames on a coat of arms is often specific or without a symbolic meaning. For example, the phoenix and the salamander are always accompanied by flames, and the flaming sword is a device as well.\n\nThese flames do not likely have a separate symbolic meaning from the object they accompany; however, the flaming torch on the crest of Sir William Gull is probably an allusion to the skill with which he kept the flame of life burning in the Prince of Wales, while he was very seriously ill in 1871.\n\nFlaunches\n\nFlanuches are segments of a circle with a large diameter, that project into the filed from either side of the shield. They are a different color that the field and are referred to by the various names of flinches, flanks or flanques. They are always borne in pairs.\n\nFlanunches were granted by sovereigns as a reward for virtue and learning, especially for services as an ambassador. Flasques are the diminutives of flaunches and do not project as far into the shield. Vioders are ever smaller and are incapable of bearing a charge.\n\nSquare flaunches are drawn like two projecting triangles. The term in the flank, or in the flaunch, is used to signify at the side.\n\nFleam\n\nThe fleam was the barber-surgeon’s knife used for bleeding people to let the poison out of their systems, so that they could maybe recover from whatever ailed them. It is an appropriate bearing in heraldry for a physician or surgeon and it is also closely connected with the occupation of a farrier, who would have bled horses to cure their illnesses as well.\n\nA fleam may also be referred to as a fleme, flegme, or a lance.\n\nFlint\n\nFlint and steel were the ancient components necessary for producing fire. In heraldry, they are borne as tokens of the bearer’s readiness for zealous service.\n\nThe furison, the instrument by which fire was struck from flint, is also a heraldic charge and would have a similar symbolic meaning. John, the Earl of Flanders used a flint stone and steel as a device, which was inherited by his son. His son, Phillip the Good founded the order of the Golden Fleece and the collar of this order bears flint stones and steels.\n\nFly\n\nThe fly is a bearer of pestilence in heraldry and may have been adopted as a symbol to ward off evil and pestilence.\n\nWith all its variations it is not an uncommon charge found on crests and coats of arms. The word fly likely refers to a common housefly, but flies, bees and beetles seem too often be confused in heraldic drawing.\n\nThe butterfly, however, is unmistakable and is usually drawn Volant en arriere, as seen from above with its wings open.\n\nThe harvest-fly is similar except that it only has two wings instead of four and its legs are prominently shown; what it represents in nature is impossible to say.\n\nThe gadfly, which is frequently blazoned as a gad-bee, is really a brimsey or a horsefly. The silkworm-fly also exists, as does a stag beetle, though they are rarely found in heraldry.\n\nFountain\n\nThe heraldic fountain is a roundel or a circle, crossed with wavy bands of blue and white. It represents a pool or spring of pure water and was borne as a symbol of purification.\n\nOther shields display realistic looking fountains rather than symbolic ones. The well is very similar to this as a symbol of purification and rebirth.\n\nFox\n\nIn heraldry, the fox was a common symbol for the devil during the middle ages.\n\nOne of the oldest tales about the fox describes it feigning death in order to trap fox.\n\nThis fox is a symbol of the devil tempting man’ therefore, it may be a reminder to the bearer to say alert and resist temptation.\n\nThe fox was also used to symbolize the struggle of the ordinary common folk against the feudal baron. It is therefore a symbol of one who will use all his shrewdness, against the feudal baron.\n\nIn heraldry, it is therefore a symbol of one who will use all his shrewdness, sagacity, wit or wisdom for his own defense.\n\nIt occurs quite frequently as a heraldic charge.\n\nFret\n\nThe fret has been called the ‘heraldic true lovers know’. It consists of a thin border of a diamond of equal sides, interlaced with a cross make of tow bendlets (thin bars), running from corner to corner in the form of a saltire (X).\n\nThe fret signifies persuasion in heraldry. In early days the charge was interchangeable with a quarter or a field fretty, which is simply interlacing bendlets going diagonally right and left. In fact, fretty was the original pattern.\n\nThe fretty pattern represents a net and signifies persuasion.\n\nFusil\n\nThe fusil represents a spindle formerly used in spinning, and it is an ancient symbol of labor and industry.\n\nThe fusil is a diamond drawn point up and more elongated than a lozenge, which is square, though in early times there was no distinction between a lozenge and a fusil.\n\nIn many cases fusils and lozenges have been used indifferently to best suit the shape of the shield that they were drawn on, though the distinction is not generally observed in heraldry.\n\nFylfot\n\nThe fylfot was introduced to the world and therefore also into heraldry at a very early period. It was a symbol used constantly by the Greeks in their clothing, architecture and pottery.\n\nThe symbol resembles four Greek capital gammas united at the base and this is where its alternate name, gammadion, is derived from.\n\nBut it is also found in the Egyptian catacombs and is aided to have been known in China and India long before Christianity, yet it also appears on coins of the Saxon king Ethelred in England in the 9th century. The Sanskrit work for this symbol is ‘swastika’.\n\nMany people, including the Romans, Celts, Franks, Hindus and Yacatans have used the fylfot as an emblem of felicity. Before it was appropriated and brought into disrepute by the Nazi party, the fylfot was a good luck charm.\n\nL\n\nLabel\n\nThe label was a decorative piece of fabric, usually silk. It was a popular trimming for dress and during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn heraldry, it is represented by a narrow band across the top of the shield, edged by another band from which three short bars hand down. Lately the bars have been drawn more like dovetails, like triangles inserted point first into the lower band.\n\nIn English arms a label was a mark of difference indicating that the bearer was the eldest son and heir. Some labels on coats of arms can be traced to this origin.\n\nLadder\n\nThe ladder was a symbol of fearlessness in attack as the scaling of walls with ladders was an extremely dangerous tactic used in laying siege to a castle. It is also a symbol of resolution in heraldry.\n\nThe scaling-ladder, that is one with hooks on the ends to go over the edge of a wall so that the ladder is not merely leaning against the castle, may be a reminder to stand carefully on guard.\n\nLapwing\n\nThe lapwing bird is symbolic of strategy in heraldry because it outwits hunters by leading them away from its nest.\n\nThose who bear the sign of the lapwing are shrewd strategists. The lapwing also goes by the alternative names of peewhit, plover, and tyrwhitt.\n\nLaurel\n\nIn ancient times, Laurel leaves were thought to be remedies against poison, as well as tokens of peace and quiet.\n\nLaurels were also symbol of victory in heraldry, first given to the winners in the early Olympic Games and later born by the conquerors such as Julius Caesar. They are symbolic of triumph and fame, especially when it is gained after a long, inner struggle.\n\nSprigs of laurel and laurel branches are also common heraldic symbols.\n\nLeopard\n\nIn heraldry, the leopard is a symbol of a valiant warrior who braves dangers with force and courage. In early heraldry leopards were often represented passant guardant and there were often no less than two on a shield, while lions were usually rampant and usually no more than two.\n\nTherefore, it could probably be more correct for the lions of England to be blazoned leopards’; probably, though, the same animal was intended but different names were given to each position. In later times, both animals were called lions.\n\nThe leopard’s head jessant is a leopard swallowing a fleur-de-lis. Edward III is said to have conferred the device during his wars in France, as a reward to leaders who served under him in his victorious campaigns. The idea behind the symbol is that he leopard of the English arms is swallowing the lily of the French coat.\n\nLily\n\nThe lily is the emblem of purity and innocence in heraldry. It is also a symbol of the Virgin Mary. Though it is usually represented by the fleur-de-lis, the lily can also be in its natural form, which is not uncommonly found in heraldry.\n\nLion\n\nThe lion has always held a high place in heraldry as the emblem of deathless courage, and, hence, that of a valiant warrior.\n\nIt is said to be a lively image of a good soldier, who must be ‘valiant in courage, strong of body, politic in council and a foe to fear’.\n\nThrough the somewhat dubious legend of their compassion, lions also came to symbolize Christ. As one medieval author asserted ‘they prey on men rather than women, and they do not kill children except when they are very hungry’.\n\nThe lion, with such repute of its noble nature and having the position and title of king of the beasts, is naturally one of the most common heraldic symbols on the continent of Europe.\n\nIn ancient times when animals were defined in by the position that they were in, the lion held the position of rampant. A walking cat was originally called a leopard, so the lions of England can probably be more accurately called leopards, but the popularity of the lion led to its acquiring many more positions, and thus the development of a terminology was necessary to describe them all.\n\nIn addition to all the positions a lion is found in, it can be found crowned or collared with two tails or two heads.\n\nLizard\n\nThe lizard is an ancient heraldic symbol signifying good luck.\n\nIt is not common in coats of arms, and its proper tincture is green, or in heraldic terms, vert.\n\nLozenge\n\nThe lozenge is a symbol of honesty and constancy and it is also a token of noble birth.\n\nIt has four sides of equal length and is positioned point up, so that it resembles a diamond rather than a square.\n\nA lozenge throughout is a lozenge that has all four points touching the sides of the shield. The arms of a lady, as a maid or a widow, are always displayed on a lozenge.\n\nLozenges cojoined to form a fesse of a pale are referred to as a ‘bend lozengy’ or a ‘fesse lozengy’, or a field may be describing as ‘lozengy ‘when it is formed entirely of an indefinite number of lozenges.\n\nA mascle is an open lozenge, or a lozenge voided, and it is merely a lozenge with a smaller one removed from the inside. It is said to be a piece on which armor was fastened, and to represent a mesh of a net.\n\nIn heraldry, it signifies persuasion, and comparatively rare, type of lozenge, pierced in the center with a circle.\n\nLynx\n\nThe lynx is an ancient heraldic symbol indicating that its bearer was possessed of particularly keen sight.\n\nIt does not occur very often in heraldry except as a supporter but is does occur in certain families on a crest.\n\nIt is nearly always depicted and blazoned ‘coward’ which simply means that its small tail is between its legs and not upright.\n\nP\n\nPale\n\nThe pale is a vertical band down the shield denoting great defensive military strength. Protective railings were made of pales.\n\nIt has often been bestowed on those who have defended cities, supported the government of the sovereign, or stood strong for the country under stress.\n\nThe guidelines of heraldry instruct that the pale is to occupy on third of the width of the shield, though this is not always strictly followed. The pallet or palet is a diminutive of the pale. Numerous pallets are often found on a shield, and when the field is striped vertically it is said to be ‘paly’.\n\nPall\n\nAs a device on a crest, the pall represents the ecclesiastical vestment called a pallium and is symbolic of archiepiscopal authority. It is the shape of a broad ‘Y’ with one end going to each corner and the end dropping almost to the bottom point of the crest or shield.\n\nAs a charge in heraldry, the end is always couped, meaning that it does not extend to the edge of the shield, and fringed. The pall, also called a pairle and a shakefork, is often found in the arms of archbishops and Sees.\n\nThe pall also occurs as an ordinary, a background symbol, especially in Scottish heraldry. Here it is usually borne with all three ends couped and pointed.\n\nPanther\n\nThe panther is said to represent a beautiful woman who is tender and loving to her young and will defend them even with her own life in jeopardy. It is a symbol of bravery in defense of the weak.\n\nIt is difficult to know whether to class the panther with actual or mythical creatures in heraldry.\n\nOften it is depicted flammant or incensed, with flames issuing from its mouth and ears. On the continent the panther is often depicted with the tail of a lion, horns, and the claws of an eagle on its forelegs.\n\nEarly armorial representations show a more natural representation, but they quickly disappear in favor of artistic creativity.\n\nParrot\n\nThe parrot or a popinjay, as it is termed in heraldry, is realistically drawn. Its image may signify distinguished service in a tropical country.\n\nPassion Nails\n\nPassion nails are borne as a reminder of poignant suffering that the first bearer of the arms underwent.\n\nFor example, Sir R. Logan bore the shield of three black passion nails piercing a red heart, for accompanying James Douglas to Jerusalem with the heard of Robert the Bruce.\n\nPeacock\n\nIn ancient times, it was believed that the flesh of the peacock would not decay. It was therefore used in heraldry as a symbol of resurrection and immortality.\n\nThe peacock represented in pride refers to a peacock observed from the front with its tail feathers splayed.\n\nIt is usually found in this position but there are also some occasions where its tail feathers are folded, particularly when it’s a supporter in a coat of arms.\n\nPegasus\n\nAn image of Pegasus, the legendary winged horse, is said to signify exceeding activity and energy of mind, whereby one may mount to honor. It is also an emblem of fame in heraldry.\n\nThis beautiful horse of mythology is not an unusual symbol in heraldry and is used often as a crest.\n\nPelican\n\nThe female pelican was believed to wound her breast with her long, curved bill, drawing blood to feed her young.\n\nThe term for this is ‘vulning’ itself and there are some birds during the nesting season that grow red feathers upon their breast, which may be where the legend came from.\n\nBut for this noble act, the bird became a symbol of piety, self-sacrifice, and virtue associated with the Holy Eucharist.\n\nThe pelican in heraldry does not traditionally have the large pouched beak of the natural bird though modern representations have given it a more realistic appearance.\n\nAlso, when blazoned ‘proper’ (meaning in its natural colors) the pelican is traditionally given the colors and plumage of an eagle instead of its natural white.\n\nThe pelican will never be found ‘close’ with its wings folded; it is always drawn vulning itself, possibly surrounded by its young, but regardless, is a symbol of maternal solicitude.\n\nPellet\n\nA black roundel is given the various names of pellet, ogress and gunstone, a roundel being any circular charge of color or metal. Black roundels represent cannon balls and bullets and may indicate that the first bearer was an artilleryman, or that he braved the dangers of these things in battle.\n\nIt may have been intended to appear globular on the shield, rather than flat like most other roundels, so an artist may shade it accordingly. Pellettee describes a shield strewn with pellets.\n\nPhoenix\n\nThe phoenix is a symbol from Greek mythology, of immortality, rebirth and renewal. Legend states that at the end of its long life, this legendary bird built a pyre of spice-wood in the desert.\n\nIt ignited the pyre by fanning its wings in the heat of the sun, plunged into the fire and was burned to ashes. Then a rejuvenated phoenix rose out of the cinders, born again.\n\nThe phoenix is also a symbol of love in heraldry. It is often found as a symbol on a crest, accompanied by the flames that it rose out of renewed.\n\nPike\n\nThe pike is a heraldic symbol for a military family and indicates prowess and fortitude in bearers of this charge.\n\nThis fish is also a symbol of the forces of industry and science and early Christians frequently used the pike as an emblem of their faith.\n\nThe pike is frequently found inn ancient arms though it may be referred to by the alternate names of lucy, luce, ged, geddes, pyke, jack, or the name of a pike of the sea, hake. It is distinguishable from other fish by its large head and long mouth. In early arms the pike is always found hauriant, or upright, but this is not always the case anymore.\n\nPile\n\nThe pile is a large piece of wood used by engineers in fortifications and bridge construction. The image of the pile was granted to military leaders for significant deeds. Or to those who showed great ability in any kind of construction.\n\nIn heraldry a pile looks like an inverted triangle issuing, point invaders, from any point along the crest except the base. It may, if specified, issue from the base as well, if accompanied by piles issuing from other points of the escutcheon. They may terminate in fleurs-de-lis or crosses patee.\n\nPineapple\n\nUnless the arms described were granted in connection with a pineapple growing country, the term pineapple, in heraldry, refers to a pinecone. It is symbolic of the inexhaustible abundance of life in nature.\n\nThe association is derived from the fact that the pine tree remained green in the winter when others appeared dead. But real pineapples also exist in the armory.\n\nOccasionally pineapples were granted as a symbol of distinguished service in a country where such fruit grew.\n\nPlate\n\nThe plate is a white of silver roundel, a roundel being any circular charge of color or metal. It represents a silver coin found in Spain during the Crusades. The name comes from the Spanish word ‘plata’ meaning silver or silver coin. The plate signifies generosity in heraldry.\n\nPomegranate\n\nIn heraldry, the pomegranate is a symbol of fertility and abundance. The association is derived from the fact that the pomegranate is a fruit composed almost entirely of seeds and was thought to reproduce itself prodigiously because of this.\n\nThe pomegranate dimidiated with a rose, meaning that the two half charges are joined, was one of the badges of Queen Mary of England, who ruled from 1553-1558.\n\nPomme\n\nPomme or pomeis is the heraldic name given to a green roundel, a roundel being any circular charge of color or metal.\n\nThe pomme represents an apple and signifies good luck. Most fruit was considered a token of good luck and symbolized the generosity of nature.\n\nIt may have been intended to appear globular on the shield, rather than flat like most other roundels, so an artist may shade it accordingly.\n\nPortcullis\n\nA portcullis is a great, barred, iron gate with spikes on the bottom, suspended over the main gate of a castle to be dropped before enemies could invade the castle.\n\nIn heraldry, it signifies an effective protection in emergency, as it was used to guard the entrance to the fortress and could be suddenly lowered against a surprise attack, when there was no time to raise the drawbridge or close the weighty doors.\n\nBorne on a shield, a portcullis usually indicates that the bearer is a great defender in an emergency. In some cases, it indicates that the original bearer operated the portcullis in a fort. It is the well-known badge of the Royal House of Tudor. It is drawn points down with chains attached to its upper corners, though the disposition of the chains is a matter left to the artist.\n\nS\n\nSalamander\n\nThe salamander signified a man of faith and was also considered a sign of good luck. It is usually described as a dragon in flames of fire, and is sometimes represented this way, only without the wings.\n\nMore frequently, though, the symbol simply indicates the shape of a lizard. The salamander is best known as the personal device of Francis I, King of France, to which origin the arms of the city of Paris can be traced.\n\nSatyr\n\nIn heraldry, a satyr is composed of a demi-savage, or half of a man with a few inhuman characteristics such as large pointed ears, united with the hind-legs of a goat so that he walks upright on tow hooves.\n\nSatyrs are not found in coats of arms except for supporters and occasionally their heads are found used as charges.\n\nSatyral\n\nA Satyral has the body of a lion, the face of an old man and the horns of an antelope. It is usually only used as a supporter in a coat of arms and is not particularly common in heraldry.\n\nScepter\n\nThe scepter is a symbol of justice and a chief emblem of royal authority. It is seldom borne alone. Frequently it occurs in the hand of a king or a saint, and it can also be found crossed, saltirewise, with a sword.\n\nScythe\n\nThe image of a sickle or a scythe, also sometimes termed a sned, expresses the hope of a fruitful harvest of things desired.\n\nSea horse\n\nIn heraldry, the seahorse is an emblem of safe travel, particularly by sea.\n\nThe heraldic seahorse, however, does not resemble the natural seahorse at all. It is an imaginary creature with the head, chest and forelegs of a horse, webbed feet like a frog in place of its hooves and a scaled body that flows into the large powerful tail of a fish, which if properly drawn, circles around itself in a coil.\n\nThe mane may not be scalloped. It is a popular symbol found quite regularly in heraldry.\n\nSerpent\n\nThe serpent is an emblem of wisdom and defiance in heraldry.\n\nIn Ireland, the serpent may be used as an emblem of St. Patrick, an association derived from the legend of St. Patrick clearing Ireland of snakes.\n\nSerpents also represent knowledge. There is nothing to distinguish a serpent or a snake from any of the other names given to it in heraldry such as cobra, adder, or bis.\n\nThe serpent may be found in a variety of positions such as erect, gliding or fessways, or involved, meaning in a curly queue.\n\nShip\n\nThe ship is an emblem of joy, happiness and adventure in heraldry. It usually points to some notable quest at sea, by which the first bearer became famous, but in more ancient bearings the emblem may have simply been derived from a long-standing seafaring tradition.\n\nIn heraldic terms there are three basic ships that may be used as a device on a shield: The ship, the lymphad and the galley. A lymphad usually only has one mast and a galley has three but the main differences between them are found in the shape and style of the vessel.\n\nBecause there are so many different types of ships they must be carefully described in the blazon with respect to the number of masts and top masts, the sails and the rigging.\n\nThere are also ships in the forms of an ark, yacht, and steamer in more recent grants of arms.\n\nShuttle\n\nIn heraldry the shuttle is a symbol of industry and productivity. Sometimes in blazon it is called a weaver’s shuttle and it is often found in arms with some connection to that trade.\n\nSpear\n\nThough the spear, the spearhead and the broken spear are all very similar devices, they each have a distinct symbolic meaning in heraldry.\n\nThe spear, lance or tilting-spear is an emblem of knightly service that signifies devotion to honor and chivalry.\n\nThe broken spear is a symbol of peace.\n\nOn the other hand, the spearhead, or javelin, is a deadly device of ancient origin, first made of iron and later of fine steel. It is said to represent dexterity and nimbleness of wit, a person able to penetrate and understand matters of the highest consequence.\n\nThe spear is distinct form the lance, javelin and the heraldic tilting-spear, in that it is always drawn with a sharp point for warfare, instead of blunt, as it would have been for a tournament.\n\nThe arms of William Shakespeare were composed of a gold tilting-spear of the field on a black bend.\n\nSphinx\n\nThe sphinx, a mythological creature derived from the Egyptian figure is usually depicted with a lion’s body, legs and ail and a woman’s head and chest.\n\nThe sphinx may also at times be winged. It represents omniscience and secrecy in heraldry.\n\nThe sphinx is more often used in crests than in coats of arms.\n\nSpur\n\nA crest or coat or arms with the device of a spur on it was awarded to men who had done magnificent deeds. The spur could appear more ornate if it was winged, or the simpler device of a spur-rowel or spur-revel might be used.\n\nThey are more often termed ‘mullets of five points pierced’ which translates to five pointed stars with a hole in the center, or the part of the spur used to cut the horse. This was a dangerous implement, used by knights to stimulate their war-horses into action. It signifies preparedness for active service in heraldry.\n\nSquirrel\n\nThe squirrel’s habit of storing nuts to ensure a supply of food for the winter makes him a symbol of thrift, caution and conception in heraldry. It occurs in many English coats of arms ant it is always depicted sejant (in a sitting position), though with a squirrel the arms are always raised, and very frequently, cracking a nut.\n\nStaff\n\nIn heraldry, the staff is a common symbol of office or authority.\n\nThe pastoral crosier is one type of staff that is an emblem of a shepherd’s watchfulness over his flock. It denotes Episcopal jurisdiction and authority.\n\nAnother is the palmer’s staff that is a symbol of the traveler, borne in reference to the early pilgrimages to Jerusalem.\n\nStag\n\nThe stag has a variety of symbolic meanings in heraldry. It can indicate someone skillful in music and a lover of harmony.\n\nIt may also indicate a person who foresees opportunities well. In the latter case it is a symbol used for one who is unwilling to assail enemies rashly, who would rather stand his own ground that harm another wrongfully, and one who will not fight unless provoked.\n\nHarmony, polity and peace are particularly associated with the female deer, called a hind or a doe.\n\nAntlers represent strength and fortitude.\n\nThe stag or hart is also an emblem of purity and fleetness.\n\nThe stag was associated with healing, for he knew which medicinal plants to take in order to shake off the hunter’s arrow. The person bearing this symbol was considered impervious to weapons.\n\nOther names for a deer include a brocket, which is a young stag, a buck, roe, roebuck, and a fawn.\n\nStaple\n\nAlthough their exact meaning is not known, it is thought that staples were used as trade symbols.\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as a door-staple and it is usually used in heraldry as a pun on a name like Dunstaple, for example.\n\nStaples are drawn boldly and angularly with wide bases sharpening severely to points.\n\nStar\n\nThe star symbolizes honor, achievement and hope in heraldry.\n\nIn some cases, a star may represent a falling star and denote a divine quality bestowed from above, whereby men ‘shine in virtue like bright stars on the earth’.\n\nStars with wavy points are emblems of God’s goodness.\n\nIn England, mullets have five points unless another number is specified. In France, a mullet has no less than six points.\n\nSun\n\nThe sun is an emblem of glory and brilliance in heraldry. It is also a symbol of authority. It represents happiness, life and spirituality.\n\nThe rising sun is a symbol of hope. The sun, when not rising, is always blazoned the ‘sun in splendor’. The rays are alternatively straight and wavy, which symbolize the head and light that we derive from them, and the heraldic sun usually has a human face though this is not strictly necessary.\n\nRays of the sun, also called beams, are sometimes borne singly as in the ancient rolls, but more often they issue from other charges when described by one of the terms as radiant, rayonne or rayonnant.\n\nOne ray of the sun signifies ‘by the light of heaven’.\n\nSunflower\n\nThe sunflower signifies that just as the flower turns toward the sun, so the bearer turns to the light and glory, symbolized by the sun.\n\nIt may also be called a heliotrope in heraldic terms.\n\nThe marigold is an ancient heraldic emblem of devotion and piety, very close to a sunflower in shape and meaning.\n\nSwan\n\nThe swan is the ensign of poets and musicians. It symbolized perfection, beauty and grace in heraldry.\n\nFor a bearer of the swan it represents a lover of poetry and harmony, or a learned person.\n\nThe swan is a favorite symbol in heraldry, often found on crests and shields. It is most often drawn close, though it can be found in other positions as well and sometimes even swimming.\n\nSword\n\nThe sword is said to be the emblem of military honor and should incite the bearer to a just and generous pursuit of honor and virtue. In heraldry, it is symbolic of liberty and strength.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the sword was often used as a symbol of the word of God. The sword (especially borne with flames) is also a symbol of purification. When borne with a cross in the same field, the sword signifies the defense of the Christian faith.\n\nThe usual form is a long straight blade with a cross handle, though the blade may also be waved or imbrued. There are also specific types of swords that may be described such as the falchion, which is a broad bladed, slightly curved sword with a semi-circular notch at the back of the blade.\n\nOthers include a scimitar, cutlass or sabre. A sword is often depicted piercing an animal or a human heart. Two swords crossed in saltire is an emblem of St. Paul.\n\nT\n\nThistle\n\nThe thistle is an ancient heraldic emblem of pain and suffering. Legend states that the thistle was chosen as the royal badge of Scotland as a result of the battle of Largs in 1262.\n\nThe Danish enemy, King Harco, had landed and was advancing inland under cover of darkness, when one of his barefoot followers trod on a thistle and gave aw howl of pain that raised the alarm.\n\nThe first appearance of the thistle as a royal badge was in 1474, when it was stamped on the back of the silver coinage of James III. During this period badges were so largely used that it is possible that the King chose the thistle with this legend in mind, though he would have done so mainly to vie with the neighboring kingdom of England.\n\nThe heraldic thistle has a short stalk and two long leaves with the flowered head in the middle. Though it is usually represented proper it can also be found gold.\n\nThunderbolt\n\nThe thunderbolt is an ancient heraldic emblem of sovereignty, power and speed.\n\nIt is derived from the classic mythology in which the thunderbolt is ascribed to the Roman god Jupiter, or the Greek god Zeus. It occurs very seldom in heraldry and usually only in crests.\n\nTiger\n\nThe tiger signifies great fierceness and valor when enraged to combat. In heraldry, it also symbolizes one whose resentment will be dangerous if aroused. The tiger depicted in heraldry was the attempt of artist to portray an animal they had never seen and knew only by repute.\n\nConsequently, the creature they drew bore little resemblance to the real animal.\n\nLater the Bengal tiger was added to the armory due to the influence of India and the Eastern lands. It looks considerably more like the real animal than the heraldic tiger.\n\nThe symbol of a tiger and mirror together refers to the medieval belief that after capturing a tiger cub, on could escape from its pursuing mother by throwing down a mirror in her path. She would believe the reflection to be her cub and try to rescue it, thus giving time for the hunter to escape.\n\nTorch\n\nThe torch or firebrand signifies truth, knowledge, purification and love in heraldry.\n\nThe bearing of a torch in arms is granted to a zealous man who has performed some signal service. It is not a common heraldic symbol.\n\nTorteau\n\nA torteau is the name given to a red roundel, a roundel being any circular charge of color or metal. It represents the cakes of bread eaten by crusaders before long battles.\n\nTortoise\n\nThe tortoise signifies invulnerability to attack and is also symbolic of slow, but sure progress. In heraldry, it is usually blazoned displayed, from an above view with its legs extended to the sides; however, it can also be borne upright.\n\nTree\n\nThe tree is a symbol of antiquity and strength in heraldry.\n\nThe oak tree was sacred to the ancient Greeks and the Celts; the lime or linden tree was sacred to the Germans and the ash tree was venerated by the Scandinavians.\n\nTrees allude to home or property, and they are also generally considered a symbol of life and strength.\n\nMore types of trees that can be mentioned have been blazoned on shields, crests and coats of arms.\n\nUsually these trees do not differ greatly in appearance, though, and the name was only specified as either a pun on the name of the bearer or in reference to a characteristic of the land held by that family.\n\nSometimes a hurst of trees, or a wood is found on a shield. Also, a tree stump or tree trunk may be used as a symbol of regrowth and rebirth, especially when it is borne with branches spouting new leaves.\n\nThese symbols are not uncommonly found in heraldry.\n\nTrefoil\n\nA trefoil, or a symbol of a three-leafed clover, represents the past, present and future. It is also often used as a symbol of fertility and abundance in heraldry.\n\nThe trefoil is derived from the shamrock, which, according to legend, was chose sans an emblem of Ireland because it was used by St. Patrick to illustrate the concept of the Holy Trinity.\n\nThe shamrock also appears on some arms.\n\nQuatrefoils are not the same as shamrocks, though they do have four leaves; the leaves of a quatrefoil are more circular and they appear without the stem of a trefoil, except for very rarely.\n\nArchitects placed this symbol on churches to signify that the gospel, the harbinger of peace and immortality, was preached there. In British rules of inheritance, the double quatrefoil signified the ninth son.\n\nA cinquefoil follows the same guidelines but unlike the quatrefoil, is very common in coats of arms. Notably the cinquefoil was the personal badge of Simon de Montfort, the man who led the baronial revolts against the King of England in the 13thcentury.\n\nHe likely used the cinquefoil as a party badge that was worn by his followers and lead to its popularization. Narcissus flowers, primroses and ‘fraises’ or strawberries are also five-petaled flowers that fall under the category of a cinquefoil.\n\nTressure\n\nA tressure is tow small borders in the outline of a shield, set close together, one within the other. It is often decorated with flowers that look somewhat like the fleur-de-lis, inserted through the tressure. This is referred to as a tressure-flory-counterflory, and it is a device that is particularly associated with Scottish heraldry.\n\nIt is said that in heraldry, the charge commemorates the alliance of Charlemagne with Archalus, King of Scotland. In return for the services of the Scots, Charlemagne added the double tressure fleurs-de-lis to the Scottish lion to represent that the former had defended the French lilies and therefore the latter would surround the lion to be a defense to him.\n\nHowever, this story is not very securely based on fact. It is more likely that the lion and tressure were derived from the arms of the Earls of Northumberland and Huntingdon, from whom some of the Scottish kings were descended."
