        "text": "This Regional Style Analysis is part of a series of articles exploring the heraldic patterns, differences, and combinations unique to a region within the framework encompassed by the governing documents of the SCA. This series is intended to aid herald-hobbyists in creating more authentic armory for a given region in a given time frame.\n\nSource – Scheibler Armorial\n\nThe Scheibler Armorial consists of 624 painted achievements, compiled in two separate sections, assembled in a leather bound book. The pages are pressed paper, measuring 25.47×17.81cm, and contain a single achievement per page. Each page is printed on both sides and consists of an escutcheon, helm, torse, mantling, and crest. Names are provided for the armorial bearer, but blazons are omitted.\n\nThe first section covers armory recorded between 1450 and 1480, with the second section covering armory recorded during the late 1500s and into the 1600s. Regionally, this collection predominately includes armory from the southern areas of the Holy Roman Empire: Bavaria, Swabia, Alsace, Franconia, Rhineland, Low Countries, Saxony, Meissen, Silesia, Austria, Styria, Tyrol, Turgovia, Raetia Curiensis, Hegau, Lake Constance, Swiss, Breisgau, Allgäu, Westphalia, Walgau, Moravia, and Bohemia.\n\nThis armorial has been cataloged under BSB cod. icon. 312 c. and can be digitally accessed at https://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00007174/images/index.html.\n\nAnalysis Method\n\nThe author went through the armorial page by page and entered the information for each set of armory in a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. Each possible attribute of armory was then classified and coded to a set SCA standard, and included: Armorial, page number, recipient’s name, blazon, field division, line treatment, field color 1 (2,3,etc), blazon pattern, primary/secondary/tertiary/overall charge classification, charge type, number, color, line of division, and so forth. After each set of armory was thusly coded, the author noted any oddities from the SCA standards, and a series of pivot tables was used to mine out the remaining patterns, which are herein presented. The blazons used for this analysis are the author’s creation, based on the standard SCA heraldic practices.\n\nWithin the examples provided, there are 18 marshalled arms. For the sake of analysis, the quarterings were separated and counted as unique arms. The entry containing the marshalled arms of Burgundy have been omitted entirely due to their complexity (quarterings, sub-quarterings, and an overall escutcheon) and the lack of any variances that would otherwise add to the analysis.\n\nAnalysis Summary\n\nTinctures present: Argent, Azure, Gules, Or, Sable, Vert, and two variants of Vair.\n\nDivisions present: Single tincture, Barry (of 4, of 6+), Bendy, Bendy Lozengy, Checky, Gyronny, Lozengy, Paly, Per Bend, Per Bend Sinister, Per Chevron, Per Chevron Inverted, Per Chevron Throughout, Per Fess, Per Pale, Per Saltire, and Quarterly.\n\nLine treatments present: Plain, Indented, Indented throughout, Embattled, Ploye, Raguly, Stepped, Urdy, Wavy/Nebuly.

Only one fur is present, and no other field treatments are present. There are 18 examples of proper coloring, with the majority being present for Roses (6) and Humans/parts (6).\n\nThe most common tincture used on the field is argent (142) followed by gules (129) and Or (86). The most common tincture used for charges is argent (141), followed by gules (80) and sable (69). There are (7) instances of counterchanging with (4) instances of counterchanged charges.\n\nThe Field\n\nField Divisions\n\nThere is a wide variety of field divisions present in this armorial, including several examples of complex line treatments. Below is a breakdown of each, including line treatments per field division. The most common by a huge margin was a Single Tincture field (366) followed by Per Fess (37), and Per Pale (25).\n\nThere were a few examples of single tincture, non-charged fields. All but one were part of marshalled arms. The single instance that was not part of marshalled armory had the blazon of “Vair”.\n\nCompound Field Divisions\n\nThere were multiple instances of a compound field divisions.\n\nCharges\n\nPrimary Charges – Type\n\nThere is a very wide variety of primary charges that show up in this armorial with the vast majority being animate (141), followed fairly closely by ordinaries (122) and field only (98). The armory found within use a combination of 140 unique primary charges.\n\nOf the animate charges, the lion (31) is the most common. It is interesting to note the relatively high prevalence of demi-animals (12) or animal heads (24).\n\nOf the inanimate charges, the attire (11) is most common, with the wing/vol being second most with (8) occurrences.\n\nOf the geometric charges, the crescent (7) is most common, followed closely by the mullet (6).\n\nTools and weapons make up the smallest proportion of the charges represented herein – there are only (22) in this category, and only (1) sword. Of the tools/weapons category, the axe-head (2), shears (2) or cauldron (2) were the most prevalent. Most charges in this category only appeared once.\n\nOf the ordinaries, the fess (53) is the most common – and given this number is it also the most common charge of all types.\n\nPrimary Charges – Number and Arrangements\n\nIn the Primary Charge Group, a single charge is most common, with a handful of occasions with two or three repeating charges. In this armorial there are no examples of (4) instances of a charge in the Primary Charge Group.\n\nOrdinaries are found fairly often in diminutive arrangements: the fess, bend, chevron, pale and pile have arrangements of (2) or (3). There are no examples of more than (3).\n\nGeometric charges are almost invariably found in arrangements of (1) or (3). There is one example of an arrangement of (2) and one of an arrangement of (5). The majority of the (3) arrangements were found to be [2,1] with eight occurrences. These could also be found as a single instance of each in pall, in fess, or conjoined in bend.\n\nTools/Weapons are found spread fairly evenly in arrangements of (1), (2), or (3), and have one example of an arrangement of (5). Arrangements of (2) are exclusively long skinny charges arranged in fess. Arrangements of (3) are mostly arranged in pale, but can also be found in [2,1] or in fess. The single arrangement of (5) was arranged in saltire.\n\nAnimate charges were almost exclusively in arrangements of (1). With the exception of the eagle and the lion, the only charges found in arrangements of (2) or more were body parts, and these were either in saltire, in fess or in pale. The eagle was found in one instance to be arranged [2,1]. The lion, when in arrangements of more than (1), was invariably in pale. There are (2) examples of an eagle displayed fesswise. Several heads or demi-animals were issuant from base.\n\nInanimate charges had the most diversity in charge arrangements and number. These were found in fairly even examples with (1), (2), and (3) instances of a charge in the same charge group. There was one example of (5), one of (6), and one example of a semy as a “primary” charge (being the only one on the field). With (2) charges, seven examples were arranged in Saltire, three in fess, and one in pile. With (3) charges, five examples were found in pale and five in [2,1], four in bend, and one in chevron. With (5) charges, they were arranged in annulo. The (6) example was arranged [3,3]. Three charges were issuant from base: the card pique, the wattle-wall, and the trimount.\n\nSecondary Charges – Number and Arrangements\n\nSecondary charges were not as prevalent as Primary charges. There were 37 examples of arms with secondary charges. The most common were inanimate (16) followed by ordinaries (10), and geometric (5).\n\nThe only charges added to the list of charges compiled in the Primary charge group are the Chief, Base, and Canton/Quarter.\n\nOf the animate charges, only three carried over to the secondary charge groups – the lion (2) the demi-eagle (1), and the bird (1).\n\nOf the inanimate charges, the most common was the mount, which had (12) instances if you combine the different variants: single, double, and triple hill versions. Other charges that carried over were the crown (1), the horseshoe (1), the ring (1), and the label (1).\n\nThe geometric charges found in the secondary charge group were mostly semys: billets (1) and lozenges (1); there was also (1) instance of a single mullet.\n\nFor Ordinaries, the most common charge was the chief (5), with two instances of the remaining charges: the canton/quarter, the base, and the bend, and one example of the fess.\n\nUsually you would assume the Bend or Fess to be in the primary charge group. In this armorial there were two examples of an animate charge (ex. Lion) maintaining, or holding, ordinary diminutives (specifically bendlets). As held charges they are listed as secondary charges. More on this is included in the Oddities section below. There was also one example of a fess cotised. The cotising is listed here and classified as a secondary charge.\n\nNo examples included instances of tools or weapons as secondary charges.\n\nTertiary Charges – Number and Arrangements\n\nThere are (20) instances of Tertiary charges in this armorial. All but (1) are related to the Primary Charge Group. Of those, (15) are fully placed upon the Primary charge and (4) are held charges of insubstantial size to count as sustained. Several charges not found in the Primary or Secondary Charge Groups can be added to the list of charges: the beaver, the delf, the roundel, the arrow, branch of 3 roses, the mace, and the seeblatter.\n\nFor animate charges, none of the charges were more prevalent, each with (1) instance: the beaver, the bird, and the serpent. All three examples were found wholly on the Primary charge.\n\nFor inanimate charges, the most common was a branch of roses/flowers with (2) instances. These were held by a primary charge. All other charges were found in (1) instance: the arrow, the covered chalice, the hat, the rose, and the seeblatter. All but the chalice, which was a held charge by the primary charge group charge, were found wholly on the primary charge.\n\nFor geometric charges, the most common was the roundel (2). All others bore equal prevalence by appearing only once: the crescent, the cross couped, the delf, the mullet, and the saltire couped. All examples in this category were found wholly on the Primary charge.\n\nThere is one example of a tool/weapon as a held/maintained charge, the mace, and it is the only example in this category as a tertiary charge.\n\nThere are two examples of an ordinary as a tertiary charge: a label and a fess. The former can be found in the oddities section below, and based on the depiction of the latter, it looks like a bar on a fess; however, this could be interpreted as a fess fimbriated.\n\nOverall Charges – Number and Arrangements\n\nFor overall charges, there were only (5) instances. Of these, only two charge categories are present: Inanimate and Ordinary.\n\nThe most prevalent Overall charge was the Fess (2). Of its (2) appearances, (1) contained two bars as the Overall Charge Group. The Saltire, the Baton, and the Escarbuncle each appeared once.\n\nPostures and Modifications\n\nFor animate charges, the most prevalent posture present is Rampant. This is expected as the most prevalent animate charge is a lion – which has a default posture of Rampant. The second most common was Displayed, which again makes sense as the second most common animate charge was an eagle. Both of these are considered the default SCA postures for each respective charge.\n\nPrimary Charges\n\nOf the (24) examples of animate heads, there were (3) examples of erased. One was a lion, one was a winged lion, and one was a swan. For both lions, the “erased” dags were rayonny, about 1/6 the height of the overall charge, and numbered about (7). For the swan, which was counterchanged over the fess line, the dags were rayonny, about 1/2 the overall charge height, and numbered (3). All others were couped or couped close. The couping was either a straight line, slightly embowed (mostly on furred beasts), or double enarched (mostly on cloven footed beasts). One example, a swan, was issuant from/terminated in a Crown. One bull’s head cabossed had its tongue hanging out.\n\nSecondary Charges\n\nGiven that there were only (4) animate secondary charges, it is unsurprising that there is a small representation of postures in this charge group. Of those that appear, all were equally scarce with a single appearance each: Passant, Rampant, Close, and Displayed.\n\nTertiary Charges\n\nThere were only (2) animate tertiary charges. The only postures that appeared in this charge group were Glissant (snake) and Volant (swans). Both sets are on bend, and both follow the orientation of the bend.\n\nCharge Groups\n\nThe most common charge group found in this armorial was a single Primary Animate charge with (120) instances followed by Field only (98), and single Primary Ordinary charge (89).\n\nOddities\n\nVair, non-traditional tinctures\n\nRule of Tincture Violation – Color on Color\n\nRule of Tincture Violation – Metal on Metal\n\nUnity of Orientation Counterexample\n\nAnimate Charges Fesswise\n\nLions Maintaining Batons\n\nPeripheral Charged with a Peripheral\n\nConclusion\n\nFor armory following the regional style of the southern Holy Roman Empire from 1400 to 1600, one would most likely expect to see an argent, Or, or gules field with a sable, gules, or argent charge. For the field it would most likely be a single tincture, or if divided, split per fess or per pale consisting of a color and a metal, and without any line treatments. If charged, one would expect to see a Lion (rampant), Eagle (displayed), or a Fess or Bend. There are several oddities, but these account for less than 3% of the provided armory.\n\nNames\n\nBelow is a listing of the names contained within this armorial. There are 470 unique entries.\n\nFirst published April 2021, by Barwnes Ariana verch Gwenllian\n\n© 2021 Stephanie Rendt-Scott. All rights reserved.
