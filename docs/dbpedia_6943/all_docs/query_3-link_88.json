        "text": "Evidently, a coat of arms is associated with an image, and heraldry is primarily a system of visual signs. However, not long after appearance of first coats of arms painted on shields, they started to be described by means of language and thus their verbal equivalent, blazon, appeared. Heraldic signs in a textual form easily found their way into contemporary narratives. The research of narrative heraldic sources started only in the early 20 th century, and studies of blazon are relatively few compared to the massive of works on heraldry. However, heraldic narrations can become a source of completely new data. Modern heraldic science addresses deeper anthropologic issues, and besides the arms themselves, it investigates the cultural and social aspects of their application. Visual sources are not always able to fulfill such needs. Thus, the research of heraldry in literature of different epochs is a promising direction, further forming our idea of coats of arms in historical context.\n\nHeralds and heraldry are generally thought to have a close, even essential relationship, dating back to their origins. However, recent research on the office of heralds has demonstrated that this close connection between ‘heralds’ and ‘heraldry’ did not exist in the Middle Ages, and that for the most part the two institutions developed independently of each other. Only over the course of the history of the herald’s office—and only at the end of the Middle Ages—did heraldry become one of their more important duties. Our understanding of ‘the herald’ as a historical phenomenon, therefore, has to be reconsidered in the same way as the proliferation and impact of heraldry as a means of communication in the Middle Ages needs to be reevaluated. Such insights allow the herald’s office to be reconsidered in its own right, separately from heraldry, and heraldry to be assessed as a means of mass communication that was available to the whole of medieval society, far from being the ‘secret science’ of heralds. But how did the misconception that equated and confused ‘heralds’ and ‘heraldry’ originate? In this paper, I suggest three reasons for the tendency of modern historiography to run together heralds and heraldry. The first reasons lies in the shared historical roots of heralds and heraldry: They both came to life in the context of the twelfth century tournaments, which lured historians into equating them from their very beginning. Although their common origins are evident, I argue that at the time heraldry was not at all the heralds’ primary occupation. The second reason that seems to be responsible for the misconception is the etymological origin of both terms. Here, I demonstrate that the definition of ‘heraldry’ as the study or science of coats of arms is in fact a modern interpretation that did not(!) exist in the Middle Ages, where ‘heraldry’ (if used at all) had a much broader sense. The third reason, finally, lies in the fact that for a long time heralds were almost exclusively studied by heraldists who, following their research interests, were primarily concerned with coats of arms. This misconception of the relationship between ‘heralds’ and ‘heraldry’ points to the importance of close sensitivity to the evolving terminological and historiographical background, and invites us to reconsider our perspectives on heralds and heraldry.\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance of imagery in the medieval world. In a church context, it was viewed as a link between this world and the next. People at all levels of society naturally wanted to use visual motifs to convey ideas about themselves. When these motifs appear to be heraldic, yet have no discernible link to established armorial families, it is likely that they are in fact displaying a 'pseudo' heraldry-using heraldic signs to suggest a fictitious armigerous legitimacy and authority. This work considers possible motivations for this throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries through the study of heraldic shield motifs inscribed in the walls of medieval parish churches, as well as on personal seals of validation attached to documents from this time. Heraldry is traditionally seen as somewhat esoteric, and only of relevance to the higher classes of society, but this work demonstrates that heraldic communication has much to tell us about the lives of everyday people, who often leave very little mark, if any, on the historical record. It finds significant commonalities in motifs across seals and graffiti and provides new directions for the understanding and interpretation of this material, and the lives of 'ordinary people' in the later medieval period.\n\nThe main concern of the article is the reevaluation of significance and potential of earlier heraldic textual sources. In opposition to “classic” views of purposes and authorship of first armorials, narrative sources of non-heraldic character may change our ideas of heraldic environment of the 13th century. The fact that correct blazon can be found in a number of poems and romances can be interpreted as a proof that heraldic knowledge was available not only to heralds, as it is now widely accepted, but also to the poets who could use it for their literary goals. And what is of more importance it suggests that the audience was able to perceive the blazon in the text and probably it was their demand.\n\nIt is commonplace that princely armorial ensigns embodied dynastic continuity and rightful territorial possession. Either impressing elites in an exclusive palace setting or showered upon the masses by the ephemeral machinery of a festive spectacle, they are usually considered straightforward instruments of worldly domination. However, their iconography was often more complicated. The Spanish monarchy’s heraldic patrimony in particular consisted of various symbolic conventions, evoking a strenuous history of state formation and intertwined interests. Such a fluid and potentially conflicting merger of different constituents found even more intricate expression in the urban churches of Brabant and Flanders. Within these sacred confines, profane signs of century-old dynastic bonds interacted with a variety of communal markers, as well as with the attributes of supreme majesty. As the venue of significant dynastic rites, the church interior was temporarily transformed into a sanctum of Burgundian-Habsburg power, while retaining its multi-semantic guise. Yet, in times of royal contestation and civil war – upsetting the Low Countries between 1566 and 1598 − waves of iconoclasm, dissident regimes and a strong reassertion of Habsburg rule engulfed this rich legacy. The present contribution explores how both local (dissenting) stakeholders and the government actively exploited this armorial presence in sacred space to stress communal cohesion and to reset the limits of royal authority. They did so not by directly targeting the isolated sign, but by manipulating its connection to the sacred."
