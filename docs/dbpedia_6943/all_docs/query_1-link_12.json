        "text": "Charges\n\nA charge is any object or figure placed on a heraldic shield or on any other object of an armorial composition. Any object found in nature or technology may appear as a heraldic charge in armory. Charges can be animals, objects, or geometric shapes.\n\nApart from the ordinaries, the most frequent charges are the cross—with its hundreds of variations—and the lion and eagle. Other common animals are stags, wild boar, martlets, and fish. Dragons, bats, unicorns, griffins, and more exotic monsters appear as charges and as supporters.\n\nAnimals are found in various stereotyped positions or 'attitudes'. Quadrupeds can often be found rampant—standing on the left hind foot. Another frequent position is passant, or walking, like the lions of the coat of arms of England. Eagles are almost always shown with their wings spread, or displayed.\n\nIn English heraldry the crescent, mullet, martlet, annulet, fleur-de-lis, and rose may be added to a shield to distinguish cadet branches of a family from the senior line. These cadency marks are usually shown smaller than normal charges, but it still does not follow that a shield containing such a charge belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic undifferenced coats of arms.\n\nThe term charge can also be used as a verb; for example, if an escutcheon bears three lions, then it is said to be charged with three lions; similarly, a crest or even a charge itself may be \"charged\", such as a pair of eagle wings charged with trefoils (e.g. Coat of arms of Brandenburg).\n\nSo-called mobile charges are not tied to the size and shape of the shield, and so may be placed in any part of the field, although whenever a charge appears alone, it is placed with sufficient position and size to occupy the entire field. Common mobile charges include human figures, human parts, animals, animal parts, mythical creatures (or \"monsters\"), plants and floral designs, inanimate objects and other devices. The heraldic animals need not exactly resemble the actual creatures.\n\nThe escutcheon is a small shield. If borne singly in the centre of the main shield, it is called an inescutcheon, and is usually employed to combine multiple coats. It is customarily the same shape as the shield it is on, though shields of specific shapes are rarely specified in the blazon.\n\nThe lozenge is a rhombus generally resembling the diamonds of playing-cards. A more acute lozenge is called a fusil. A lozenge voided (i.e. with a lozenge-shaped hole) is a mascle; a lozenge pierced (i.e. with a round hole) is a rustre.\n\nThe billet is a rectangle, usually at least twice as tall as it is wide; it may represent a block of wood or a sheet of paper. Billets appear in the shield of the house of Nassau, which was modified to become that of the kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nThe roundel is a solid circle, frequently of gold, though it can be of any colour. Roundels have their own special names depending on the colour, as shown below.\n\nthree bezants three plates three hurts three torteaux three pellets three pommes three golpes three fountains\n\nA fountain is a roundel Barry wavy Argent and Azure.\n\nAn annulet is a roundel voided (literally. a little ring). The arms on the right are those of Courville-sur-Eure with ten annulets.\n\nSeveral other simple charges occur with comparable frequency. These include the mullet or star, crescent and cross.\n\nThe mullet (or mollet) is a star of (usually five) straight rays, and may have originated as a representation of the rowel or revel of a spur (although \"spur-revels\" also appear under that name). Mullets frequently appear pierced. If unpierced, it is sometimes called a \"star\" in Scottish heraldry, and stars also appear in English and continental heraldry under that name (often with six points).\n\nFive mullets of six points Or\n\npierced of the field\n\na rustre\n\n3 mascles\n\nA star with (usually six) wavy rays is called an estoile (from etoile, the French word for \"star\").\n\nThe crescent, a symbol of the Moon, normally appears with its horns upward; if its horns are to Dexter it represents a waxing moon (increscent), and with horns to sinister it represents a waning moon (decrescent).\n\nOne of the most frequently found charges in heraldry, if not the most, is the cross, which has developed into, some say, 400 varieties. When the cross does not reach the edges of the field, it becomes a mobile charge. The plain Greek cross (with equal limbs) and Latin cross (with the lower limb extended) are sometimes seen, but more often the tip of each limb is developed into some ornamental shape. The most commonly found crosses in heraldry are shown below.\n\ngreek cross cross-moline cross-patonce cross-flory cross pommee cross-crosslet cross-potent saltire cross voided cross fourchee cross pattee maltese cross cross bottony\n\nIn English heraldry the crescent, mullet, martlet, annulet, fleur-de-lis and rose may be added to a shield to distinguish cadet branches of a family from the senior line. It does not follow, however, that a shield containing such a charge belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic (undifferenced) coats of arms.\n\nHumans, deities, angels and demons occur more often as crests and supporters than on the shield. When humans do appear on the shield, they almost always appear affronté (facing forward), rather than toward the left like beasts. The largest group of human charges consists of saints, often as the patron of a town. Knights, bishops, monks and nuns, kings and queens also occur frequently. .\n\nGreco-Roman mythological figures typically appear in an allegorical or canting role. Angels very frequently appear.\n\nParts of human bodies occur more often than the whole, particularly heads, stylized hearts, hands, torso and armored limbs. A famous heraldic hand is the Red Hand of Ulster, alluding to an ancient myth. According to one version, the kingdom of Ulster had at one time no rightful heir. Because of this it was agreed that a boat race should take place and that \"whosoever's hand is the first to touch the shore of Ulster, so shall he be made the king\". One candidate so desired Ulster that, upon seeing that he was losing the race, he cut off his hand and threw it to the shore — thus winning the kingship. The hand is most likely red to represent the fact that it would have been covered in blood. According to some versions of the story, the king who cut off his hand belonged to the Uí Néill clan, which apparently explains its association with them - the red hand is the ancient arms of the O'Neil and appears as an escutcheon on the arms of Ulster.\n\nPlants are common in heraldry and figure among the earliest charges. Trees also appear in heraldry; the most frequent tree by far is the oak (drawn with large leaves and acorns), followed by the pine. Apples and bunches of grapes occur very frequently, other fruits less so.\n\nThe most famous heraldic flower (particularly in French heraldry) is the fleur-de-lis, which is often stated to be a stylised lily, though despite the name there is considerable debate on this. The \"natural\" lily, somewhat stylised, also occurs, as (together with the fleur-de-lis) in the arms of Eton College. The rose is perhaps even more widely seen in English heraldry than the fleur-de-lis. Its heraldic form is derived from the \"wild\" type with only five petals. The thistle frequently appears as a symbol of Scotland.\n\nThe trefoil, quatrefoil and cinquefoil are abstract forms resembling flowers or leaves. The trefoil is always shown slipped (i.e. with a stem), unless blazoned otherwise. The cinquefoil is sometimes blazoned fraise (strawberry flower), most notably when canting for Fraser. The trillium flower occurs occasionally in a Canadian context, and the protea flower constantly appears in South Africa, since it is the national flower symbol, the South African cricket team sometimes being called the Proteas.\n\nWheat occurs in the form of \"garbs\" or sheaves and in fields , though less often as ears- all of which are shown unwhiskered. Ears of rye are depicted exactly as wheat, except the ears droop down and is probably best shown as whiskered. Barley, maize and oats also occur.\n\nFew inanimate objects in heraldry carry a special significance distinct from that of the object itself, but among such objects are the escarbuncle, the fasces, and the key. The escarbuncle developed from the radiating iron bands used to strengthen a round shield, eventually becoming a heraldic charge.\n\nThe fasces (not to be confused with the French term for a bar or fess) is emblematic of the Roman magisterial office and has often been granted to mayors. Keys (taking a form similar to a \"skeleton key\") are emblematic of Saint Peter and, by extension, the papacy, and thus frequently appear in ecclesiastical heraldry.\n\nThe sun \"in his splendour\" is a disc with twelve or more wavy rays, or alternating wavy and straight rays, as shown on the left. It appears in the arms of Brady (also shown left): . \"Sable, in the sinister base a Dexter hand couped at the wrist proper pointing with index finger to the sun in splendour in Dexter chief Or\".\n\nThe moon \"in her plenitude\" (full) sometimes appears, distinguished from a roundel Argent by having a face; but crescents occur much more frequently. Estoiles are stars with six wavy rays, while stars (when they occur under that name) normally have five straight rays, being the same as the mullet. Clouds often occur, though more frequently for people or animals to stand on or issue from than as isolated charges. The raindrop as such is unknown, though a drop of fluid (goutte) is known. These occasionally appear as a charge, but more frequently constitute a field semé (known as goutté).\n\nThe oldest geological charge is the mount, typically a green hilltop rising from the lower edge of the field, providing a place for a beast, building or tree to stand.. Natural mountains and boulders are not unknown, though ranges of mountains are differently shown. An example is the arms of Edinburgh, portraying Edinburgh Castle atop Castle Rock. Volcanos are shown, almost without exception, as erupting, and the eruption is generally stylised. In the 18th century, landscapes began to appear in armoury, often depicting the sites of battles. For example, Admiral Lord Nelson received a chief of augmentation containing a landscape alluding to the Battle of the Nile.\n\nThe most frequent building in heraldry is the tower, a tapering cylinder of masonry topped with battlements, usually having a door and a few windows. The canting arms of the Kingdom of Castile are Gules, a tower triple-towered Or (i.e. three small towers standing atop a larger one). A castle is generally shown as two towers joined by a wall, though sometimes as a wall with two towers; the doorway is sometimes blazoned to be shown secured by a portcullis. The portcullis was used as a canting badge by the Tudors (\"two-doors\"), and has since come to represent the British Parliament.\n\nAs an ordinary chess-rook would be indistinguishable from a tower; the heraldic chess rook, instead of battlements, has two outward-splayed \"horns\".\n\nCivic and ecclesiastical armory sometimes shows a church or a whole town, and cities, towns and Scots burghs often bear a mural crown (a crown in the form of a wall with battlements or turrets) in place of a crown over the shield. Ships of various types often appear; the most frequent being the ancient galley often called, from the Gaelic, a lymphad. Also frequent are anchors and oars.\n\nThe maunch is a medieval lappeted sleeve, some highly stylized, and looking quite unlike a sleeve and more like a fancifully-written letter M; in French blazon it is said to be called manche mal taillée (\"a sleeve badly cut\") though modern French blazons seem to be quite happy with plain manche. Spurs also occur, sometimes \"winged\", but more frequently occurring is the spur-rowel or spur-revel, which is said to more often termed a \"mullet of five points pierced\" by English heralds.\n\nCrowns and coronets of various kinds are constantly seen. The ecclesiastical hat and bishop's mitre are nearly ubiquitous in ecclesiastical heraldry. The sword is sometimes a symbol of authority, as in the royal arms of the Netherlands, but may also allude to Saint Paul, as the patron of a town (e.g. London) or dedicatee of a church. Other weapons occur more often in modern than in earlier heraldry. The mace also appears as a weapon, the war mace, in addition to its appearance as a symbol of authority, plain mace. The globus cruciger, also variously called an orb, a royal orb, or a mound (from French monde, Latin mundus, the world) is a ball or globe surmounted by a cross, which is part of the regalia of an emperor or king, and is the emblem of sovereign authority and majesty.\n\nBooks constantly occur, most frequently in the arms of colleges and universities, though the Gospel and Bible are sometimes distinguished. Books if open may be inscribed with words.\n\nOxford\n\nUniversity Cambridge\n\nUniversity Yale\n\nUniversity Birmingham University\n\nWords and phrases are otherwise rare, except in Spanish and Portuguese armory. Letters of the various alphabets are also relatively rare. Arms of merchants in Poland and eastern Germany are often based on house marks, abstract symbols resembling runes.\n\nMusical instruments commonly seen are the harp (as in the coat of arms of Ireland), bell and trumpet. The drum, almost without exception, is of the field drum type.\n\nAnimals, especially lions and eagles, feature prominently as heraldic charges. Many important differences exist between an animal's natural form and the stylized form given to it in heraldic displays. Many of these differences are apparent in the conventional attitudes (positions) into which heraldic animals are contorted; additionally, various parts of an animal (claws, horns, tongue, etc.) may be differently coloured, each with its own terminology.\n\nMost animals are broadly classified, according to their natural form, into beasts, birds, sea creatures and others, and the attitudes that apply to them may be grouped accordingly. Beasts, particularly lions, most often appear in the rampant position; while birds, particularly the eagle, most often appear displayed. While the lion, regarded as the king of beasts, is by far the most frequently occurring beast in heraldry, the eagle, equally regarded as the king of birds, is overwhelmingly the most frequently occurring bird, and the rivalry between these two is often noted to parallel with the political rivalry between the powers they came to represent in medieval Europe.\n\nOther beasts frequently seen include wolf, bear, boar, horse, bull or ox, stag. The tiger (unless blazoned as a Bengal tiger) is a fanciful beast with a wolf-like body, a mane and a pointed snout. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur more often as crests or supporters than as charges. The unicorn resembles a horse with a single horn, but its hooves are usually cloven like those of a deer. The griffin combines the head (but with ears), chest, wings and forelegs of the eagle with the hindquarters and legs of a lion. The male griffin lacks wings and his body is scattered with spikes.\n\nThe bird most frequently found in coat armory, by far, is the eagle in its various forms, including the ubiquitous eagle displayed, eagles in other poses (such as statant or rising), the demi-eagle (an eagle displayed, shown only above the waist), the double-headed eagle of imperial fame, and a few other forms . Eagles and their wings also feature prominently as crests. The double eagle gained its fame in the arms of the Byzantine, Holy Roman, Austrian, and Russian empires.\n\nThe martlet, a stylized swallow without feet, is a mark of cadency in English heraldry, but also appears as a simple charge in undifferenced arms.\n\nThe category of sea creatures may be seen to include various fish, a highly stylized \"dolphin\", and various fanciful creatures, sea monsters, which are shown as half-fish and half-beast, as well as mermaids and the like. The \"sea lion\" and \"sea horse\", for example, do not appear as natural sea lions and seahorses, but rather as half-lion half-fish and half-horse half-fish, respectively. Fish of various species often appear in canting arms, e.g.: pike, also called luce, for Pike or Lucy; dolphin (a conventional kind of fish rather than the natural mammal) for the Dauphin de Viennois. The escallop (scallop shell) became popular as a token of pilgrimage to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela. The sea-lion and sea-horse, like the mermaid, combine the foreparts of a mammal with the tail of a fish, and a dorsal fin in place of the mane. (When the natural seahorse is meant, it is blazoned as a hippocampus.) The sea-dog and sea-wolf are quadrupeds but with scales, webbed feet, and often a flat tail resembling that of the beaver.\n\nReptiles and invertebrates occurring in heraldry include serpents, lizards, salamanders and others, but the most frequently occurring of these are various forms of dragons. The \"dragon\", thus termed, is a large monstrous reptile with, often, a forked or barbed tongue, membraned wings like a bat's, and four legs. The wyvern and lindworm are dragons with only two legs. The salamander is typically shown as a simple lizard surrounded by flames.\n\nAnimals' heads are also very frequent charges, as are the paw or leg (gamb) of the lion, the wing (often paired) of the eagle, and the antlers (attire) of the stag. Sometimes only the top half of a beast is shown; for example, the demi-lion is among the most common forms occurring in heraldic crests.\n\nHeads may appear cabossed (also caboshed or caboched): with the head cleanly separated from the neck so that only the face shows. On the arms on the left are three bulls' heads cabossed.\n\nAlternatively they may be erased: with the neck showing a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body. The arms on the right feature three griffons'; heads erased.\n\nFinally heads may me couped, with the neck cleanly separated from the body so that the whole head and neck are present. The arms on the right feature three boars' heads couped.\n\nWhile cabossed heads are shown facing forward (affronté), heads that are couped or erased face Dexter unless otherwise specified for differencing. Heads of horned beasts are often shown cabossed to display the horns, but instances can be found in any of these circumstances.\n\nAttitude\n\nIn heraldry, an attitude is the position in which an animal, fictional beast, mythical creature, human or human-like being is emblazoned as a charge, supporter or crest.\n\nThe attitude, or position, of the creature's body is usually explicitly stated in English blazon. When such description is omitted, a lion can be assumed to be rampant, a herbivore passant.\n\nBy default, the charge faces Dexter (left as seen by the viewer); this would be forward on a shield worn on the left arm. In German heraldry, animate charges in the Dexter half of a composite display are usually turned to face the centre.\n\nCertain features of an animal are often of a contrasting tincture. The charge is then said to be armed (claws and horns and tusks), langued (tongue), pizzled (penis), attired (antlers or very occasionally horns), unguled (hooves), crined (horse's mane or human hair) of a specified tincture.\n\nMany attitudes apply only to predatory beasts and are exemplified by the beast most frequently found in heraldry — the lion. Some other terms apply only to docile animals, such as the doe. Other attitudes describe the positions of birds, mostly exemplified by the bird most frequently found in heraldry — the eagle. Birds are often further described by the exact position of their wings.\n\nThe term naiant (swimming), is usually reserved for fish but may also apply to swans, ducks or geese.\n\nOne attitude, segreant, is reserved for mythical winged quadrupeds known as griffins. It denotes an attitude which for other beasts is denoted by the term rampant.\n\nAdditionally, there are positions applying to direction, to indicate variations from the presumed position of any charge. Animals and animal-like creatures are presumed to be shown in profile, facing Dexter (the viewer's left), and humans and human-like beings are presumed to be shown affronté (facing the viewer), unless otherwise specified in the blazon.\n\nTo sinister or contourné is said of an animal or being that is turned to face the viewer's right.\n\nGuardant indicates an animal with its head turned to face the viewer.\n\nRegardant indicates an animal with its head turned backward, as if looking over its shoulder.\n\nMany attitudes commonly met with in heraldic rolls apply specifically to predatory beasts, while others may be better suited to the docile animals.\n\nAlso worth note is that a lion or other beast may additionally be described in terms of the position of its head, differently coloured parts (such as teeth, claws, tongue, etc.), or by the shape or position of its tail. A beast may be \"armed\" (horns, teeth and claws) or \"langued\" (tongue) of a tincture, while a stag may be \"attired\" (antlers) or \"unguled\" (hooves) of a tincture. A lion (or other beast) coward carries the tail between its hind legs. The tail also may be forked (queue fourchée) or doubled (double-queued).\n\nA beast rampant (Old French: \"rearing up\") is depicted in profile standing erect with forepaws raised. The position of the hind legs varies according to local custom: the lion may stand on both hind legs, braced wide apart, or on only one, with the other also raised to strike; the word rampant is sometimes omitted, especially in early blazon, as this is the most usual position of a carnivorous quadruped. Rampant is the most frequent attitude of quadrupeds, and as supporters they are rarely seen in any other attitude.\n\nlion rampant lion rampant guardant lion rampant regardant lion coward lion tail fourche lion tail saltire\n\nA beast courant (also at speed or in full chase) is running, depicted at full stride with all four legs in the air, as on the right.\n\nA beast salient (Latin: saliens, \"leaping\" or springing) is leaping, with both hind legs together on the ground and both forelegs together in the air, as shown on the left.. This is a very rare position for a lion, but is also used of other heraldic beasts. The stag and other docile animals in this position are often termed springing. Certain smaller animals are sometimes blazoned as saltant rather than salient.\n\nA beast passant (Old French: \"striding\") walks toward the viewer's left, with the right forepaw raised and all others on the ground. A \"Lion of England\" denotes a lion passant guardant Or, used as an augmentation. For stags and other deer-like beasts of chase, the term trippant is used instead of passant. Interestingly, French heralds have long held that any lion in a walking position must necessarily be a \"leopard\" which accounts for the three lions of England being referred to as the leopards of England although this is not the practice of English heralds.\n\nLion passant lion passant guardant lion passant regardant\n\nA beast statant (Old French: \"standing\") is \"standing\" (in profile toward Dexter), all four feet on the ground, usually with the forepaws together. This posture is more frequent in crests than in charges on shields - see for example the UK's Royal crest on the right.\n\nIn certain animals, such as bears, this is sometimes said to refer to an upright, bipedal position (this position usually referred to as statant erect). While statant is used in reference to predatory beasts, the more docile animals when in this position are sometimes blazoned at bay, though this term hardly, if ever, appears in any reliable source. Stags statant guardant are said to be at gaze.\n\nLion statant lion statant guardant lion statant regardant\n\nA beast sejant or sejeant (Middle French: sejant, \"sitting\") sits on his haunches, with both forepaws on the ground.. A beast sejant erect is seated on its haunches, but with its body erect and both forepaws raised in the \"rampant\" position (this is sometimes termed \"sejant-rampant\").\n\nThe royal arms of Scotland feature an unusual lion sejant erect and affronte as shown on the right. The crest is blazoned as \"Upon the Royal helm the crown of Scotland Proper, thereon a lion sejant affronté Gules armed and langued Azure, Royally crowned Proper holding in his Dexter paw a sword and in his sinister a sceptre, both Proper\"\n\nlion sejant lion sejant erect\n\nA beast couchant (Old French: \"lying down\") is lying down, but with the head raised. Lodged is the term for this position when applied to the 'docile' animals and most commonly of stags which are not necessarily to be thought of as 'docile' even if herbivorous. A beast dormant (Old French: \"sleeping\") is lying down with its eyes closed and head lowered, resting upon the forepaws, as if asleep.\n\nLion couchant lion dormant\n\nSome attitudes describe the positioning of birds. Birds, without an attitude specifically blazoned, is by default shown as close - ie at rest with wings against the body.\n\nA bird displayed is shown affronté with its head turned to Dexter and wings spread to the sides to fill the area of the field. The symbolic use of eagles in this position was well established even before the development of heraldry, going back to Charlemagne. Wings displayed are spread to the sides to fill the area of the field. The eagle is so often found displayed in early heraldry that some people claim that this position came to be presumed of the eagle unless some other attitude is specified in the blazon. The arms of Germany shown on the right feature an eagle displayed.\n\nWings addorsed are raised as if about to take flight, so that only the top of the bird's right wing shows behind the fully displayed left wing. Wings elevated are raised with the wing tips pointing upward. Wings inverted are raised with the wing tips pointing downward.\n\nA bird rising or rousant faces Dexter with its head upturned and wings raised, as if about to take flight. A bird rising may have its wings described as either displayed or addorsed, and the wings may be further described as elevated or inverted.\n\nA bird trussed, close, or perched is at rest with its wings folded - though trussed is much more rarely found than the other terms, of which 'close' is by far the most common.\n\nOne peculiar attitude among birds, reserved only to the pelican, is the pelican in her piety (i.e. wings raised, piercing her own breast to feed her chicks in the nest). This symbol carries a religious meaning, and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position. A distinction is observed, between a pelican \"vulning herself\" (alone, piercing her breast) and \"in her piety\" (surrounded by and feeding her chicks).\n\nSeveral terms refer to the particular position of the wings, rather than the attitude of the bird itself. A bird in nearly any attitude, except trussed, may have wings displayed, addorsed, elevated or inverted.\n\nFew attitudes are reserved to the rarer classes of creatures, but these include segreant, a term which can only apply to winged quadrupeds; naiant and hauriant, terms applying principally to fish; glissant and nowed, terms applying to serpents. Serpents also sometimes appear in a circular form, biting their own tail, but this symbol, called an Ouroboros, was imported ready-made into heraldry, and so it has no term of attitude to describe it, being blazoned as 'disposed circleways' or something similar.\n\nCreatures combatant are shown in profile facing each other in the rampant or segreant position, always paired and never appearing singly. Nearly any creature can be rendered combatant, although this term is usually applied to predatory beasts and mythical creatures; herbivorous animals in such a position are usually, but not always, blazoned as respectant.\n\nCreatures or objects addorsed or endorsed are shown facing away from each other. As with combatant, charges addorsed can only appear in pairs. One also frequently finds keys addorsed (placed in parallel, wards facing outward).\n\nAn animal or creature naiant is swimming. This term is typically applied to fish (when shown in a horizontal position), but may also apply to other sea creatures and, occasionally, water fowl (i.e. swans, ducks or geese). A dolphin blazoned as naiant is always shown as embowed, unlike any other sea creature or monster, even though the blazon may not specify this.\n\nA fish, dolphin, or other sea creature hauriant is in a Vertical position with its head up. On the right are the arms of the Dauphin of France.\n\nA serpent glissant is gliding along horizontally in a waved or wavy way.\n\nSerpents, and the tails of other beasts and monsters, may be nowed or knotted — often in a figure 8 knot.\n\nHelms, Crests, Torses (Wreaths), Coronets and Mantling\n\nHelm\n\nIn heraldic achievements, the helmet or helm is situated above the shield and bears the torse and crest. The style of helmet displayed varies according to rank and social status, and these styles developed over time, in step with the development of actual military helmets.\n\nOpen-visored or barred helmets are typically reserved to the highest ranks of nobility, while untitled nobility and burghers typically assume closed helms. While these classifications remained relatively constant, the specific forms of all these helmets varied and evolved over time. The evolution of these heraldic helmets followed the evolution of combat techniques and tourneying in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe practice of indicating rank through the display of barred or open-face helmets did not appear until around 1615, long after the practice of heraldry had been established.\n\nIn some traditions, especially German and Nordic heraldry, two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single achievement of arms, each representing a fief to which the bearer has a right. For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.\n\nAs jousting with lances was supplanted by tourneying with maces, the object being to knock the opponent's crest off his helmet, the fully enclosed helmet gave way to helmets with enlarged visual openings with only a few bars to protect the face.\n\nThe direction a helmet faces and the number of bars on the grille have been ascribed special significance in later manuals, but this is not a period practice. A king's helmet, a golden helmet shown affronté with the visor raised, crowned with a royal crown, became adopted by the kings of Prussia. In ecclesiastical heraldry, bishops and other clergy use a mitre or other rank-appropriate ecclesiastical hat in place of a helmet.\n\nHistorically the helmet was not specifically granted in an achievement of arms, but was naturally assumed by appropriate rank as a matter of \"inherent right\", so a helmet with torse and mantling would not be misplaced even above a shield which had no crest to place above it.\n\nWhen multiple crests need to be depicted, practice in English heraldry is to draw the crests above a single helmet, each being separated from it. The example on the right is an exception.\n\nIn German heraldry, where multiple crests appear frequently after the 16th century, each crest is always treated as inseparable from its own helmet and turned in agreement with the helmet.\n\nIn continental Europe, multiple helmets were usually turned inward, with the centre helm (if an odd number) turned affrontê, while in Scandinavian heraldry the helmets were usually turned outward.\n\nThe Crest\n\nA crest is a component of an heraldic display, so called because it stands on top of a helmet rather like the crest on a bird's head.\n\nThe earliest heraldic crests were apparently painted on metal fans, and repeated the coat of arms painted on the shield, a practice which was later discontinued. Later they were sculpted of leather and other materials.\n\nOriginally, the crest was often continued into the mantling, but today the crest normally stands within a wreath of cloth, called a torse, in the principal tinctures of the shield (the liveries). Various kinds of coronet may take the place of the torse, though in some circumstances the coronet sits atop a torse, and is either defined as all or part of a crest.\n\nThe most frequent crest-coronet is a simplified form of a ducal coronet, with four leaves rather than eight. Towns often have a mural crown, i.e. a coronet in the form of embattled stone walls.\n\nObjects frequently borne as crests include animals, especially lions, normally showing only the fore half; human figures, likewise often from the waist up; hands or arms holding weapons; bird's wings. In Germany and nearby countries, the crest often repeats the liveries in the form of a tall hat, a fan of plumes in alternating tinctures, or a pair of curving horns.\n\nSome armigers used their crest as a personal badge, leading to the erroneous use of the word \"crest\" to describe a shield or full coat of arms. Such badges are often used by members of Scottish clans. These Scottish crest badges can be used where clan members, who are not armigerous, wear a badge consisting of a clan chief's crest and motto/slogan encircled by a belt and buckle. These crest badges are often erroneously called \"clan crests\". Even though clan members may purchase and wear such badges, the crest and motto/slogan remain the heraldic property of the clan chief.\n\nToday, the crests of new Knights of the Garter and Bath are carved from lime wood by the Orders' official sculptor, These carved insignia are displayed above the knights' assigned choir stalls in the Orders' respective chapels: St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle (Garter) and the Henry VII Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey (Bath).\n\nIn most heraldic traditions, a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest, and motto.\n\nGerman heraldry has examples of shields with numerous crests, as this arms of Saxe-Altenburg featuring a total of seven crests. Some thaler coins display as many as fifteen.\n\nCrests are occasionally humorous. On the left is the crest of Beet of Chester\n\nA lion's gamb erect grasping a dragon's head erased proper. (Armorial Bearings in The Cheshire Visitations exemplified by Martin S. J. Goldstraw and reproduced here with his kind permission).\n\nClergy now refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their heraldic achievements. Members of the clergy may display appropriate head wear. This often takes the form of a bishop's mitre or a small crowned, wide brimmed hat (a galero) with the colours and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of Papal arms an elaborate triple crown known as the papal tiara.\n\nThere is a widespread misconception, due in part to Victorian stationers' marketing of engraved letterheads, that a crest and a coat of arms belong to everyone with the same family name; but usage by persons not descended from the original grantee constitutes usurpation. Bogus \"family crests\" continue to be sold to the gullible by heraldic bucket shops.\n\nTorses & Coronets\n\nThe crest is usually found on a wreath of twisted cloth and sometimes within a coronet. It normally has six twists of material with the metal and colour alternating from Dexter to sinister and with the metal first.\n\nCrest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in Canada, descendants of the United Empire Loyalists are entitled to use a Loyalist military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).\n\nIf the armiger has the title of baron, hereditary knight, or higher, he may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom, this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.\n\nOther crowns include ancient crowns, mural crowns for walled cities and naval crowns for Naval institutions (shown right).\n\nAnother addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by an ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.\n\nMantling\n\nMantling or lambrequin is drapery tied to the helmet above the shield. It forms a backdrop for the shield. It is a depiction of the protective cloth covering (often of linen) worn by knights from their helmets to stave off the elements, and, secondarily, to decrease the effects of sword-blows against the helmet in battle, from which it is usually shown tattered or cut to shreds as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.\n\nIt is sometimes shown as an intact drape, principally in those cases where a clergyman uses a helmet and mantling (to symbolise that the clergyman has not been involved in combat, although this is usually the artist's discretion). More often clergymen do not use the helm, torse and mantling though if they inherit their arms they will be inherited by their heir. (Helm, torse and mantling are usually included in new grants of arms to clergymen because their descendants might use them even if the grantee does not)\n\nTypically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal colour in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though there are exceptions, with occasional tinctures differing from these, for example just one colour, or three or four colours, or two furs. Peers in the United Kingdom use red and ermine standard colourings regardless of rank or the colourings of their arms (though in practice, some prefer to use their own colours).\n\nThe arms of the United Kingdom and those of Emperor Akihito of Japan are both or, lined ermine, such a mantling often being held to be limited to sovereigns.\n\nIn the early days of the development of the crest, before the torse (wreath), crest coronets and chapeaux were developed, the crest often \"continued into the mantling\" if this was feasible (the clothes worn by a demi- human figure, or the fur of the animal, for instance, allowing or encouraging this). This still holds true frequently in Germany.\n\nThere are rare examples where the mantling is blazoned to compliment the armiger's coat of arms, mimicking the ordinaries and charges on the escutcheon. When charges occur, they are usually displayed as semy."
