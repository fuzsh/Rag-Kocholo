        "text": "A Eurovision Journey - by Matt MacDonald\n\nAn emotional barefoot singer makes her way across a bridge over fans cheering from below while confetti falls from the roof. She is handed a microphone-shaped trophy. Continues walking. The host starts wrapping up the evening, while the singer gets ready to perform, I think. I quickly realize that she's performing her winning song again – that's cool. Oh, I like this song. I really like this song. And she's performing barefoot. That's awesome. I don't think I've ever seen a singer perform while barefoot.\n\nAnd, just like that, I was hooked.\n\nI do not remember much of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. I am honestly not 100 percent sure how I stumbled across it either. As an American, you do pretty much need to stumble across Eurovision because it never receives media coverage here, at least not until the 2016 Contest was broadcast on Logo TV, a cable/satellite channel that few know exists, forget have access to. So, even now, it's very rare to find a fellow American who has even heard of Eurovision.\n\nBut, there I was, in early June 2013, watching an archived broadcast of Eurovision and immediately being hooked by it. Why was I hooked? Well, given my natural interests, it actually makes a lot of sense. I'm very interested in sports and competition, and this contest obviously has plenty of that. However, I'm also a big supporter of anything theatrical, and Eurovision is nothing if not theatrical.\n\nI also love how structured it is. Every country receives up to three minutes. You can produce vocal and other musical art however you want in those three minutes; they are yours. However, when they're up, you're done, and it's time for the next act. So much build-up, for months even, leading up to those three minutes, and then much of Europe is focused on you for up to 180 seconds. That's intense. And then you get to do it all over again if you advance from the semifinal into the final.\n\nI'm also a supporter of Europe in general. I know that it's a very diverse continent, much more diverse than the United States, obviously, but I love the varied personalities and histories of the assorted places there. I'm also a big soccer (football) fan. Although that sport is getting more popular in the United States every day, it's obviously biggest in Europe. And Eurovision brings together a little of both: Europe (obviously) as well as national teams, so to speak, competing against each to determine the European champion (sort of like the UEFA European Football Championship, well, if Australia was invited too).\n\nHowever, I do like that the competition aspect is not the sole focus of the artists. Well, at least it's not as much the focus for them as it is for athletes. Many of those performing at Eurovision appear to be more focused on creating art as best as they can, and if they happen to win, great, but they're not nearly as obsessed with winning as athletes are, which is a good thing. They know that with art and with Eurovision, there are way too many variables to be able to know exactly what needs to be done to win, so they don't obsess over it. (Well, except for Russia.)\n\nTo clarify that last point, I know that the competition aspect has affected much of the contest, such as the fact that most countries sing in English, the songs tend to not be as traditional as they used to be, etc. But, compared to a professional football competition, the obsession with winning is just not to those levels at Eurovision. At least from what I can tell.\n\nSo, once I was introduced to the contest, I was smitten. Of course, it helped that I really liked, \"Only Teardrops,\" and have even listened to her album by that name on numerous occasions. Perhaps due to that, I unfortunately do not remember much else from the 2013 Contest.\n\nThen came 2014. Although \"Rise Like a Phoenix\" was definitely my least favorite of the four winners since I started following Eurovision, I think that it's awesome that somebody like Conchita Wurst received so much support that she ended up winning, which I'm unsure would happen here, and her being able to win this contest endeared me even more to Eurovision.\n\nI do have a few stronger memories from the 2014 Contest. Ukraine's \"Tick-Tock\" was catchy. Well, the \"Tick-Tock\" part of the song was – the rest of the song was forgettable. However, Poland's \"My Slowianie – We Are Slavic\" had to be the most memorable song from that contest. Even disregarding the, um, provocatively dressed butter churners, I really liked the song – it was definitely my favorite from that show. I also really admired the artistic backdrop that they performed in front of – those red patterns were beautiful. And I do have to admit that I did like that it pushed the limits. In very different ways than Conchita did, obviously, but it was still pushing the boundaries regardless. And the public clearly enjoyed the performance as it finished fifth in the televote versus 23rd by the juries.\n\nBut it's 2015 when my passion began reaching obsession levels. That was the year when I started watching all of the videos of the performances as well as listening to audio versions of the songs over and over and over again. My favorites that year included Estonia's \"Goodbye to Yesterday,\" Russia's \"A Million Voices,\" Albania's \"I'm Alive,\" Georgia's \"Warrior,\" San Marino's \"Chain of Lights,\" Iceland's \"Unbroken,\" Sweden's \"Heroes,\" Switzerland's \"Time to Shine,\" Slovenia's \"Here For You,\" United Kingdom's \"Still in Love with You\" and Germany's \"Black Smoke.\" So, I liked a lot of songs that did not perform very well in addition to the top two, which I probably would have placed one and two in the order that they actually finished. And I also enjoyed listening to many more 2015 songs not listed here. So, yeah, I think this had to have been the year when I had really caught the Eurovision bug full force.\n\nAnd, finally, 2016, which I thought was an even better contest than 2015. I don't know yet if this is natural (it probably is), but as soon as the 2016 show happened, my interest in continuing to watch and listen to the 2015 songs decreased quite a bit, although I do still enjoy them from time to time. For the following months, I absolutely could not get enough of the 2016 Contest. That has only started to wane four months after the contest aired.\n\nAnd my obsession started to expand a little bit more. Back in 2013, I searched out some of Emmelie de Forest's other music. However, I had not really done that for any artist since. That changed this year as I started searching out non-Eurovision songs and performances posted to YouTube from several of my favorite artists from this year's contest.\n\nSome of them, despite really enjoying their Eurovision songs and performances, just did not keep my interest when I discovered their other music and other performances. Laura Tesoro and Jamie-Lee are two examples. Loved their Eurovision songs. Didn't really care for their other music.\n\nHowever, others, like Jamala and Francesca Michielin, really drew me in with their other music. In fact, I like Francesca's other music a lot more than her Eurovision song. Jamala, meanwhile, although \"1944\" has to still be my favorite song of hers, I was amazed at the incredible career that she has had so far. She is incredibly talented and does an amazing job of emoting throughout many of her songs, which obviously was shown in her winning performance, while also having some pretty fun/random songs too. Zoe's got some catchy songs too, and I have no idea how Austrians did not select, \"Quel filou,\" in 2015, instead bumping it to third and sending The Makemakes, while Dawa finished second in their national selection. Although I do like, \"Loin d'ici,\" \"Quel filou\" blows it away, in my opinion.\n\nFor the record, my favorite songs at the 2016 Contest include Ukraine's \"1944,\" Russia's \"You Are the Only One,\" Bulgaria's \"If Love Was a Crime,\" Belgium's \"What's the Pressure,\" Austria's \"Loin d'ici,\" Italy's \"No Degree of Separation,\" Serbia's \"Goodbye (Shelter),\" Croatia's \"Lighthouse,\" Germany's \"Ghost\" and Moldova's \"Falling Stars.\" I also liked Switzerland's \"The Last of Our Kind,\" but all of that squatting was pretty impossible to ignore.\n\nNow, as we start building up to the 2017 Contest, my fandom has started reaching even higher levels. For one thing, I'm going to do everything possible to attend next year's show. Maybe it won't happen, which would be fine, but I'm going to do what I can to make it happen. Secondly, I'm going to actually follow the Eurovision happenings in the months leading up to the Contest, which I had never done before, such as looking for clips of performances at Eurovision in Concert and similar events as well as national finals. I had always watched some of those well after the fact, like after Eurovision airs in May, but now I'm going to keep an eye on those events as they happen. And, of course, I've joined OGAE Rest of the World, so that's yet another step in my fandom/passion/obsession with Eurovision.\n\nI'm unsure what's going to happen after that point. I suppose I could attempt to do something journalist-related, and I do have professional journalism experience, but I'm unsure if I would want to do that even if I was provided or otherwise earned the opportunity as I could also see myself simply being content attending every year and being amongst the fans. Or maybe I will find a way to attend next year in Ukraine and then follow that up with reverting a little, watching it on television/online once again every year. (Although I do have this sneaking suspicion that once I attend one, I'm going to want to return every year.) However, regardless of the level of my fandom in the coming years, I'm sure that Eurovision will always be at least a small part of my life.\n\nGerman Selection - Back to the roots - by Henrike Hoeren\n\nAfter some miserable years of results Germans channel NDR has presented the concept to choosethe candidate for Kiev 2017.\n\nThe Show\n\n* The German selection show will take place in the 9th of February.\n\n* Until the 18th of November singers have the time to apply. From these singers 30 will pass into the second round and 5 will remain for the final in the 9th of February.\n\n* The songs on that night are chosen by producers around Europe especially for Eurovision.\n\n* The presenter of the night will be Barbara Schöneberger, which should be a known face for Eurovision Fans, as she has presented the German results the last years.\n\n* For the first time a European mood test will be calculated with the help of voting of all of Europe via the official app. These voting will not count for the official result, but should give the German public an idea about how the act is viewed by European people.\n\n* The winner will be chosen directly on the 9th of February bypublic vote.\n\n* The whole concept strongly resembles the concept of „Unser Star für Oslo“, which had as a winner Lena. One of the production companies behind the show is Raab TV, the company owned by Stefan Raab. Stefan Raab has proven to be a golden boy for the Eurovision, having competed himself with „Wadde Hadde Dudde Da“ and has been the driving force behind Max Mutzke, Roman Lob and Lena.\n\nThe Jury\n\nThe jury of the German selection are made of Lena, Tim Bendzko and Florian Silbereisen. They wont have any power about the official result and will help by commenting and using their expertise.\n\nLena\n\nLena does not need a lot of explaining to do. With her first victory for Germany since years and her connection to the Eurovision the years after she is a perfect jury member. The last years she has also gained experience in being a jury member with appearances in the show The voice Kids. About the competition she said that she would highly recommend artists to apply as the format has changed her life.\n\nTim Bendzko\n\nTim Bendzko knows Eurovision. Tim is a famous German Pop singer, having had his first huge hit in 2011 with his song „Nur noch kurz die Welt retten“. His music is German spoken Pop. In 2012 he was in the German jury of the Eurovision that year. A year later he appeared as a jury for the selection show „Unser Song für Malmö“.\n\nTim Bendzko at work:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BAKb2p450Q\n\nFlorian Silbereisen\n\nFlorian Silbereisen is the face of Schlagermusic in Germany. Born 1981, he has been on the television screen since 2002, moderating big Schlager shows and making his own music. He is also famous for his relationship with the highly admired German Schlagerstar Helene Fischer. They have been a couple since 2008. In 2013 Florian Silbereisen was already in the jury together with Tim Bendzko for „Unser Star für Malmö“. He said in interviews to be very excited about this year and has high hopes.\n\nFlorian Silbereisen at work:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoX01v0RhpE\n\nWhat do you think about the concept? Will Germany finally make a comeback in the Top Ten this year?\n\nBy Andrew Wortham\n\nIt was 2007 a few months before the Eurovision Song Contest in Helsinki, and Georgia was allowed entry. This had me excited.\n\nMy love Affair supporting Georgia each year began when they attended Australia at the Rugby World Cup was back in 2003. They qualified and were taken in by the Australians. Most of the players did not have expensive hotels so many Aussies took the players in to live with them during the cup. I bought the Georgia supporters jersey and people came up and said how great it was for them to be at the World Cup.\n\nTo be honest I have never heard of Georgia before, and being on the other side of the world, we have limited information about it, however I did my research and discovered how beautiful the country is. One thing that I absolutely loved about Georgia is the language. The writing is quite distinct, similar to Burmese but completely different.\n\nEurovision is where I became such a big Georgia fan. To be honest the first song, Visionary Dream by Sopho Khalvashi was a good offering but definately not one of my favorites. Great to see the dancers with Georgian clothing in the background. However in 2018, one of my absolute favorites was Diana Gurtskaya with Peace will Come. The song was pretty amazing, the stage design was fabulous. But what made this song even more amazing was the costume change, a white cloth over all performers who's clothing changed from Black to white in a matter of seconds. And Diana - she is blind. Amazing talent I haven't seen before at Eurovision!\n\nOne of the lesser known songs but very dance worthy is \"We don't wanna put in\" which has pretty controversial lyrics and was rejected by the EBU however I think it would of been a winner. And the lyrics are not as controversial as other songs at Eurovision. The music video is well worth a watch.\n\nOver the years I have put on Eurovision parties, and I have always supported Georgia, until the Three Minutes to Earth came into play in 2014. The song was not popular and was the worst result they have had. That year I supported Montenegro with Sergej Ćetković - Moj Svijet. It was that year that Conchita won for Austria (and I was working for Austrian Airlines at that time) and decided to put my love of Eurovision and actually go there.\n\nWith my flag packed in my bag off I went to Vienna for my first every Eurovision song contest - live. With the flag wrapped around me, many Goergians came up to me and surprised that I, as an Australian supported Georgia! Warrior was absolutely amazing, Nina Sublatti's costume was absolutely wonderful and matched the song perfectly. I was close to the front of the stage, waving the flag and she smiled at me, which really mean a lot! The performance was great albeit too much smoke but she did a great job finishing 11th place. I became known as the \"Friend of Georgia\" when many Georgians came up to me while I was out an about.\n\nThis year, I visited Eurovision again, the Eurovision bug hit me hard. Georgia's song this year was not my favorite, however I was waiving the Georgian flag at the red carpet in Stockholm. My support was for Amir from France. However it is funny that listening to Midnight Gold a lot I absolutely love the song.\n\nI have loved Eurovision and also supporting Goergia. Let's be honest when you are in the stadium, not many people are holding the flag, but to show support from one country to another I think that is what Eurovision is about, Building Bridges and Coming together."
