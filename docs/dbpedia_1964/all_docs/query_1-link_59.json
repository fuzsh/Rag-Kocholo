        "text": "Siranush Harutyunyan (Armenian: Սիրանուշ Հարությունյան; born 7 January 1987), known professionally as Sirusho (Armenian: Սիրուշո), is an Armenian singer whose musical career has been active for over 20 years. Her musical style reflects the Armenian traditional sounds mixed with modern music. Sirusho received her first award when she was nine years old for her song \"Lusabats\". Sirusho's first studio album, Sirusho, was released in 2000; her second album Sheram was released in 2005. In the same year, she was awarded The Future of Armenian Music, Best Album and Best Female Performer awards in the first Armenian National Music Awards.\n\nIn 2008, the BBC described her success as making her a \"national treasure\" of Armenia. Sirusho reached international recognition after becoming the Armenian spokesperson for the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest and the Armenian representative for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest held in Belgrade. Sirusho represented Armenia with the song \"Qélé, Qélé\", which she co-wrote with Armenian producer H.A. Der-Hovagimian. \"Qélé, Qélé\" became a hit for Eurovision Song Contest-following fans around the world, especially in Greek-speaking areas. The 'Yerevan Remix' version of the song was regularly played in Greek clubs, on London Greek Radio in the United Kingdom, and in an episode of the Greek and Cyprus X Factor television series."
