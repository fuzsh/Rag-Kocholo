Everyone wants to know what they love, what they are into. And if a star is trying to hide his life, then such secrecy is of increased interest. This happened with the Russian singer Diana Gurtskaya, who appears in public in large dark glasses. Everyone wants to see what Diana Gurtskaya is without glasses, what she looks like, what is hidden under these huge glasses. Her photo is hunted by the paparazzi, who are trying to find out what led to blindness. popular singer? From this article you will learn a little more about Diana. We will introduce you to the main events and facts of her biography, present to your attention photos and videos of the singer. Here you will find the answer to the question - is it true that Diana is blind, or is it just such a PR move for popularity?\n\nBlind childhood without the sun\n\nPopular Russian singer originally from the Abkhazian city of Sukhimi. Her father was a miner and her mother was a teacher. IN early childhood little Diana was exactly the same as other children, her parents did not even suspect that their daughter had congenital blindness. Once, when the baby fell off the couch and hit her face hard, her parents found out about vision problems. Unfortunately doctors could not do anything to restore the girls' sight. As for little Diana, at that time she had no idea about the terrible illness.\n\nThe first steps to the dream of becoming a singer\n\nSince childhood, Diana really wanted to become a singer. Most acquaintances and friends did not believe in the girl's success, as they believed that the big stage was closed to blind people. However, with the support of relatives, especially her mother, the girl constantly studied and developed her vocal abilities.\n\nWhen Diana was eight years old, she faced a big problem - teachers in music school did not want to teach her because of blindness. The girl showed unprecedented perseverance, which convinced everyone. So she began to learn to play the piano. Diana Gurtskaya was brought up in a boarding school for blind children.\n\n<\n\nLet the eyes not see, but the soul sings\n\nWhen Diana was ten years old, she entered the Tbilisi Philharmonic. It was a new step to the heights of her musical popularity. At that time, she was lucky to perform with the famous singer of those times - Irma Sokhadze. Since that time, the girl has become popular in her city, they begin to recognize her on the street. Then Diana truly realizes that the stage is her calling. Here she is truly happy.\n\nAfter Diana graduates from music school, she enters the Tbilisi Philharmonic. After that, she moved to Moscow, where she entered the Gnessin School in the department of jazz vocals. Then came the festival \"Moscow-Yalta\" in 1995. It is there that Gurtskaya submits for the first time to the general public. There she receives a special jury sympathy award.\n\nThere was a famous composer in that jury Igor Nikolaev, which later helped the girl get on the big stage. Diana is recording the first music album, which was called \"You are here.\" Later, recalling the competition, Diana said that during the preparations she was not worried, but on the competition day she became very scared. However, she was able to overcome the excitement, and the performance was a success.\n\nAfter Igor Nikolaev helped her choose a song in which Diana \"saw\" not with her eyes, but with her soul, real fame comes to her. This was followed by filming on television, concerts, interviews. She loved to work hard.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya created and implemented the White Cane International Charity Festival. This is a modern creative project with the assistance of the singer's fund for helping blind and visually impaired children \"At the call of the heart.\"\n\nDiana Gurtskaya without glasses\n\nEvery year the popularity of the singer only grew. The number of her fans also increased. However, there were also envious people who spread rumors about the singer's imaginary blindness. They tried in every possible way to take a photo of Diana Gurtskots without glasses in order to expose her deceit. Such negative PR did not pass without a trace, people began to speak and doubt her blindness. In the newspapers, dishonest journalists increasingly began to write that the singer was not at all blind.\n\nThey said that Dina Gurtskaya does not go without glasses in public, but puts them on only in front of the fans in order to add mystery to her image. They threatened to prove this with compromising photos of the singer without glasses. The fact that no one saw her without glasses added fuel to the fire. Such a mystery gives rise to many rumors and speculation.\n\nSuch a large number of slander and gossip hurt Diana very much. The singer's managers, fighting off the vile journalists, sent them to the girl's attending physicians. Those, in turn, confirmed the fact that Diana Gurtskaya was indeed blind from birth. In her interviews, the singer says that only close friends and family see her without glasses. She sees no point in having others look into blind eyes.\n\nDespite the fact that many photojournalists offered the singer a lot of money for her photo or video without glasses, Diana did not agree. In all the photographs, the singer's eyes are tightly closed with loud glasses.\n\nThroughout her long career, the blind singer Diana Gurtskaya has never taken off her dark glasses. And then the day came when the singer decided to take off her glasses in her new video.\n\nGurtskaya dared to part with her usual glasses for the sake of a new video for Viktor Drobysh's song called \"I'm Losing You.\" In the video, Diana appears in different images: either her eyes are covered with a blindfold in the form of floral patterns, or a beautiful lace ribbon flaunts on her face. However, in the third image, the singer decided to do without glasses and bandages, but simply close her eyes, the eyelids of which are made up with dark shadows.\n\nIt is known that in early childhood, Diana was no different from the rest, so the parents did not even know that their daughter did not see anything. Everything became clear after one day the girl fell off the sofa with a crash and smashed her face into blood.\n\nHer parents did not know what to do: they took her to different doctors, but even the best ophthalmologists only confirmed the incurability of the disease. Diana herself for a long time did not even know that she was different from other children. Later, she graduated from a boarding school for blind and visually impaired children in Tbilisi and convinced the teachers of the music school that she could learn to play the piano.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya knows firsthand how to live in a world without colors. But with her creativity, she enriched the musical world with millions of shades. And thanks to the activities of the singer's charitable foundation, many blind children were able to feel truly happy.\n\nThe childhood of Diana Gurtskaya\n\nDiana was born on July 2, 1978 in sunny Sukhumi. She was the youngest daughter in the Megrelian family Guda and Zaira Gurtskaya. Parents were already at a respectable age; my father used to work in a mine, and my mother taught at a school. The baby was surrounded with love and care not only by her parents, but also by the older children - brothers Dzhambul and Robert and sister Eliso.\n\nFor the first months, Zaire did not notice her daughter's illness, but when the girl fell off the couch, breaking her face to blood, her mother rushed to the hospital. The doctors' verdict was disappointing - congenital blindness. Ophthalmologists did not give a single chance that the child would be able to see. It was a big blow for the whole family, but the parents decided not to focus on their daughter's illness, and raised Diana in the same way as their older children. “I grew up as an ordinary child - I also ran, fell, played pranks. They never spared me, although everyone took care of me, ”the singer recalled.\n\nAt the age of 7, Diana was sent to study at the Tbilisi boarding school for blind and visually impaired children, located five hundred kilometers from her home. The girl got used to the new unfamiliar environment for a long time and was very homesick for her family. After class, she came into the room and opened the suitcase with her things in order to smell her mother for a moment. Diana missed her the most. But when the schoolgirl came home and asked for an extra day to extend the holidays, her parents were adamant: “You must get an education. Go through life with your head held high!\n\nDiana Gurtskaya in the studio \"Let them talk\"\n\nWhen the girl was overcome by melancholy, she began to sing. This was her favorite pastime from early childhood - having not yet learned to speak well, Diana already memorized the melodies and sounds of the world around her, and then tried to reproduce them. Mom noticed her daughter's creative abilities, so she supported her in an effort to get a musical education. At the age of 8, Diana began studying with a vocal teacher, and after a couple of months she wanted to learn how to play the piano. But if in the boarding school the whole situation was adjusted to the characteristics of blind children, then at the music school it was much more difficult - the girl had to study on an equal basis with everyone else, relying only on her own memory and keen hearing: “I almost forgot everything when I came home, and I had to several times to start from scratch. But without music, I couldn't live. And the more difficult, the more interesting!”.\n\nThe efforts of the stubborn schoolgirl bore fruit: already at the age of 10 she stood on the stage of the Tbilisi Philharmonic and sang a duet with Irma Sokhadze herself. It was the first resounding success of the young talent.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya's career\n\nIn 1995, 17-year-old Diana Gurtskaya applied to participate in the international pop song festival Yalta - Moscow - Transit. For the competition, the singer chose the song \"Tbiliso\". The soulful performance of a young Georgian woman did not leave indifferent even the masters of the Russian stage, among whom were Laima Vaikule, Mikhail Tanich, Igor Nikolaev, Alexander Malinin, Lolita and Igor Krutoy.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya - \"If the night is gone\", 1995\n\nAnd although Gurtskaya did not take first place, the jury awarded the singer with an extraordinary voice with a special prize. It was presented by the singer and composer Igor Nikolaev. This moment became Diana's takeoff point on the musical Olympus: Nikolaev offered cooperation to the talented performer, and she simply could not refuse.\n\nImmediately after this competition, the entire Gurtskaya family moved to Moscow. Here, the youngest daughter of Guda and Zaira decided to continue her musical education - she entered the pop department at the Gnessin School. 18-year-old Diana, inspired by success, decided that she could conquer another peak, and began to simultaneously master stage skills at GITIS. But even this was not enough for Diana - in 2003 she received a master's degree from the Faculty of Arts of Moscow State University. Lomonosov.\n\nIn 1999, Gurtskaya first performed Igor Nikolaev's song \"You are here.\" The composition became an absolute hit, but the audience did not even suspect that for the singer herself it was a requiem song: “When this song was created, my mother was still alive. But even then she was diagnosed with cancer. She managed to see a little bit that my dream came true. I am a singer\". The composition instantly took off to the top of the charts, and Diana was invited to perform it on \"Song of the Year\". When Gurtskaya sang on the main stage of the country, Zaira was buried in Tbilisi: “It felt like at the moment I was addressing my mother with this song. I had the impression that the whole audience knew then my story, my tragedy.\n\nIn 2000, the debut album of the singer “You are here” was released, it included songs written for her by Igor Nikolaev and Sergey Chelobanov. Gurtskaya continued to collaborate with these composers, and two years later the second album was released with their songs - “You know, mom”. Tours began, duets with world famous singers, including Joseph Kobzon, Toto Cutugno, Al Bano, Demis Roussos.\n\nThe first performance of Diana Gurtskaya and Toto Cutugno\n\nA year later, Diana was waiting for another blow of fate - the brother of the singer Dzhambul was severely beaten on the streets of Moscow. The guy was hospitalized, but the capital's doctors failed to save his life. The family drama was reflected in the singer's work, but many more achievements and victories awaited Diana ahead. In December 2006, Gurtskaya was awarded the title of Honored Artist of Russia. In 2008, she represented Georgia in the international Eurovision Song Contest, and a year later she became the ambassador of Sochi-2014, as a person who popularizes the ideas of the Olympic and Paralympic movement in Russia and the world.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya at Eurovision 2008\n\nIn 2011, the famous singer became a member of the show \"Dancing with the Stars\", Sergey Balashov became her partner on the floor.\n\nIn 2010, the singer realized another of her dreams - she held the White Cane: Tolerance, Equality, Integration festival. At the same time, a charitable foundation began its work, providing assistance to children with absent or weak eyesight \"At the call of the heart.\" And in 2013, Gurtskaya became a member of the Commission under the President of the Russian Federation for the Disabled.\n\nPersonal life of Diana Gurtskaya\n\nDiana never devoted the press to her personal life until Peter Kucherenko appeared in her life. Young people were introduced by Irina Khakamada back in 2002. At first it was a business collaboration between a successful lawyer and an aspiring singer, but a year later they came out as a couple in love.\n\nWhen Peter decided to take a serious step and offered his beloved a hand and a heart, Diana dodged the answer, wishing \"a star from heaven.\" Kucherenko promised to fulfill this desire as well - and in 2004 a new star discovered by astronomers was named Diana Gurtskaya.\n\nIn the clip \"I'm losing you\" Diana Gurtskaya showed her face without glasses\n\nThe charitable foundation \"At the call of the heart\" is still functioning - Gurtskaya and Kucherenko continue to help children with vision problems.\n\nNot everyone will be able to decide to use their talent to succeed, especially if you are not like everyone else.
