        "text": "Destroyed Tbilisi (1992), on the way Civil War. In the city, fires are lit to keep warm and to eat hot food.\n\nLight is given for 2 hours a day. All city residents eagerly swallow frightening information about new destruction and deaths of loved ones.\n\nA star is born\n\nAnd in this gloomy, ruined city it sounded powerful voice a little blind 10-year-old girl who did not leave a single person indifferent. One day, the whole of Georgia learned about her and fell in love with her forever. This is how singer Diana Gurtskaya appeared, whose biography until that moment was not strewn with roses.\n\nIn 1995, the girl made her debut on big stage in Yalta and blew the audience away with her extraordinary voice and touching manner of performance. Diana Gurtskaya was the last child in the family of a miner from Western Georgia. Her mother died when she was very young, and her older brothers and sister took on all the care of the blind girl. This was followed by a boarding school for blind children, where Diana missed her family and constantly sang her favorite mother's works. The girl, blind from birth, had absolute pitch, a stunning “non-childish” voice, music was her guiding star from an early age. People around could listen to her for hours. When Diana was sent to a music school to study vocals, she persuaded her teacher to teach her\n\nCarier start\n\nArrival in Yalta became turning point in the career of an aspiring singer, and a few years later she moved to Moscow. Her older brother Robert continued to take care of his sister, surrounded her with love and care, and then became her producer.\n\nFate favored Diana from the very beginning, as if compensating for her lack of vision. The girl harmoniously joined the ranks Russian show business, and the concerts followed one after another. They were supplemented by filming, which was terribly tiring, but Diana Gurtskaya is not timid. No matter how exhausted she was, everything the director said was law, and she gave it her hundred percent.\n\nLove will come unexpectedly\n\n2002 became a fateful year in Diana's life. She first met her future husband, Siberian Peter Kucherenko. In the beginning it was business cooperation, which grew into friendship and then into love. However, Diana turned out to be a capricious girl and responded to the marriage proposal young man ambiguous. The girl promised that if he gets her a star from the sky, she will think about it. Peter turned out to be a romantic man, for whom the desire of his beloved is the law. And then at the next fashionable party, the DJ suddenly turned off the music and announced a new star discovered by astronomers and named after Diana. The audience applauded the girl, who was blushing with happiness, and the groom presented her with a huge bouquet, picked her up in his arms and spun her around the dance floor. Needless to say, the wedding was just around the corner. A gorgeous celebration, as befits a star and a beautiful girl!\n\nMendelssohn March\n\nThe bride was very impressive in a stunning dress, embroidered with pearls and stones, which the famous fashion designer Yudashkin worked on for a whole month.\n\nThe young couple looked very happy that day. After all, the celebration was a great success. Diana’s husband still supports his beloved in everything; he treats her like a fragile antique vase, blowing away specks of dust. Diana Gurtskaya has an explosive character and sometimes makes him jealous. Then he sulks at him for a long time. However, her jealousy has no basis, her husband adores her and never cheats on her.\n\nLong-awaited son\n\nAlmost two years passed after the marriage, and Diana, who passionately dreamed of having a baby, could not get pregnant. She tried almost all types of treatment and even alternative medicine. And then on June 29, 2007, a boy was born - the long-awaited son. It seemed that the happiness of the young parents knew no bounds. The birth of a son brought the couple together even more, and they began pleasant chores on raising a child. Diana turned out to be a “crazy mother” who blows away specks of dust from her adored child, and sometimes Peter is forced to stop her. Otherwise, she is capable of crazy things to her own detriment.\n\nOf course, the family has a nanny, because the singer has a very strict tour and concert schedule, but she devotes every free minute to her son. The couple decided not to explain to the baby that his mother could not see, and left things to chance. When Diana Gurtskaya’s child grew up, he saw how everyone around him cared about his mother, and said that he would always try to help her.\n\nThe parents breathed a sigh of relief when they saw that the child was aware of everything and understood the situation correctly. On family council Diana Gurtskaya and her husband decided to look like an ordinary, average baby. His parents sent him to kindergarten and then to a regular school. Why did they make this choice? Diana believes that there he will go through the compulsory school of life, and will not consider himself special just because his mother is like that famous singer. The calculation turned out to be correct, and Diana Gurtskaya’s son is growing up as a smart, calm, obedient child and making great success learning.\n\nFamily tragedy\n\nIn June 2009, a terrible tragedy occurred in the family of Diana Gurtskaya. In Moscow, her brother Eduard was beaten to death by law enforcement officers. He was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries and died from the beating at the hospital. As it turned out, Eduard was stopped by police on the street and taken to the police station, where he was mocked and beaten for several hours. The tragedy of Diana Gurtskaya did not leave the public indifferent. Many journalists and politicians They demanded a speedy solution to the outrageous crime, but the case stalled. This was a terrible blow for Diana, who simply adored her brother. It took her a long time to recover from the shock.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya, whose biography is filled with both bitter and happy moments, continues to lead an active life. Huge loads seem to add strength to her, and she is always eager to fight. Since 2009, she has become an honorary person involved in the promotion of the Paralympic Games. Diana made great efforts to help athletes receive decent service at the Sochi Olympics 2014. Gurtskaya often comes to her homeland in Georgia, where she gives solo concerts and gathers huge halls. People remember her and love her for her poignant first song, which became a guiding star in that difficult time for the country.\n\nDiana Gudayevna Gurtskaya(Georgian დიანა ღურწკაია; born July 2, 1978, Sukhumi) - Russian pop singer And public figure; Honored Artist of Russia (2006).

For example, the performer’s brother, who is also her producer, is named Robert Gurtskaya.\n\nMusical creativity of Diana Gurtskaya\n\nMusical creativity is reflected in the following:\n\nDiscography of Diana Gurtskaya\n\n1. 2000 “You are here” (ARS studio)\n\nMagic glass\n\nAre you here\n\nI'm sorry\n\nIdyll\n\nBewitch me\n\nIs there love in the world\n\nWithout you\n\nI do not love you\n\nLoyalty\n\nHeart\n\nRider\n\nTwo moons\n\ngoodbye\n\n2. 2002 “You know, mom”\n\nDiana: At first I was embarrassed by Petya - he was so serious, smart... And suddenly he started calling me. I tried to immediately “turn the arrows”: “Should I call Robert?” And she called her brother. But one day Petya couldn’t stand it and said: “When I need Robert, I’ll call him, but now...” From that moment on, we began talking on the phone for an hour or two. These conversations excited me very much, but I forced myself to think of him only as a wonderful friend. I swear, I was afraid to even think about love.\n\nI'm telling you, I'm a realist. And she understood perfectly well that it was one thing to see me on stage, at home, and quite another thing to constantly live with a blind person... Therefore, she kept repeating to herself only about friendship. But you can't fool your heart. When I saw him, I was worried, blushed, I wanted to cry and laugh at the same time...\n\nPeter: Until one Easter day, with a serious look, I sat Diana on the sofa and said that “we need to look at our relationship from a new angle.” All the relatives hid in the kitchen at that moment so as not to disturb us. And Diana kept getting embarrassed and giggling.\n\nDiana: When Petya spoke about a “new perspective,” I also decided to show my cards. I gave him several cassettes with heart-warming films, such as “Dancer in the Dark,” and also the book “I See the Sun” by Nodar Dumbadze. Petya, in response, opened Korolenko’s story “The Blind Musician” and read it to me with such feeling that everything turned upside down in my soul. And having read to the end, he said: “We’ve had enough books and films, the topic is closed.” When, a few days later, Petya went on a business trip for a month, I realized how much I missed him. And she admitted to herself that she “fell in love” with this man very much... But when he returned, Peter directly asked: “Will you marry me?” - I still didn’t give a direct answer, I flirted with all my might, although in my heart I thought: “Do you, who are so kind and smart, doubt this?!” Then, on Valentine's Day, Petya gave me a diamond ring, and our future was decided... Six months later, in September 2005, we got married. Of course, work, career, applause, it's all wonderful. But much more important than this is the confidence that your loved one is next to you, your support, with whom you fall asleep and wake up... I am especially pleased that Peter’s family received me wonderfully. And I love them all very much. I call Petya’s parents mom and dad, and I perceive his sisters as my own.\n\n- Peter, didn’t Diana’s dark glasses confuse your relatives? For me and my loved ones, Diana is ordinary,. That a blind person cannot live life to the fullest, is a stereotype of our society. In other civilized countries the situation is completely different. I do not perceive my wife as a woman who should live in a special space, fenced off from the world and its problems. You can be an absolutely healthy person, but at the same time completely flawed and limited. Yes, Diana has sunglasses. So what? There is no need to stick them out and there is no need to be shy, this is part of her life. The main thing is that, despite them, she achieved a lot. This is a huge personal and strong-willed achievement of hers, plus, of course, the help of her family. But, you see, you need to have colossal courage to compete with sighted people... In general, for me, the topic of Diana’s blindness simply does not exist. And there is a beloved woman who will soon give birth to my son or daughter. When they used to show me photos of other people’s children, I didn’t understand parental tenderness. But when I myself saw a small dot on the ultrasound - our child, I felt involved in a great miracle.\n\n- Diana, will your child have vision problems?\n\nThank God, the baby’s eyes will be fine. When Petya and I got married, we went through all possible examinations, as expected. Besides, I believe in myself and in God. By the way, our baby is so nimble and active that the ultrasound does not even allow us to see who we should expect - a boy or a girl. But my intuition tells me that there will be a son. So that's great. And then we will give birth to a daughter. We are young, healthy people, we have a place to live, something to feed our children. So we have everything ahead... When we got married, I immediately thought about a child. But I had to wait a year. And when this happened, I couldn’t believe my luck. I remember asking Petya to look at the pregnancy test, and he said: “The result is positive.”\n\nAnd I screamed in hysterics: “No, it can’t be!” He was surprised: “Yes, there are two stripes.” And my hands and feet are cold, I laugh and cry at the same time.\n\nAnd only then was I able to believe that THIS had happened. By the way, my joy turned out to be “contagious”: my daughter-in-law Natalya, the wife of brother Robert, immediately became pregnant. He got married recently, and before that he kept saying: “He worked and worked, but there was still no time to have children.” And then, as if by order, he will have a child! So Natasha and I go to the doctors together and it looks like we’ll be giving birth in the same week.\n\nIt’s normal, although you have to monitor your weight and cope with toxicosis. Unlike my husband, who eats right, I love everything “harmful” - adjika, spicy salads, barbecue. It may not be healthy, but it’s so tasty - you can feel life itself in such dishes. On the other hand, I eat little - because I’m picky, and I don’t sit down at the table after six in the evening. I always had to limit myself in food, because I am short, and if I gain weight, it will be immediately noticeable, and the stage requires beauty. Now I am already in my fifth month, and I weigh the same as before pregnancy - 48 kilograms. But now weight is not the main thing for me, the main thing is the health of the child.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya is a famous Russian pop singer. Her image of a fragile girl, always singing in dark glasses, and touching songs loved by the listener. The singer, blind from birth, knows firsthand what it’s like to live in a world “without colors.” But this did not stop her from winning the hearts of millions with her talent and unique voice.\n\nBiography of the singer\n\nDiana Gurtskaya is Georgian by nationality. She comes from an ordinary family: her father worked in a mine, and her mother was a teacher at school. In addition to Diana, there were three more children in the family, but she was the youngest. The parents had no idea about their daughter’s illness for some time. But one day little Diana hit herself hard when she fell off the sofa. Already in the hospital, the family learned that the girl had congenital blindness, and there was no chance of restoring her vision. The singer herself said that none of her loved ones focused attention on her illness. We tried to raise them the same way as other children.\n\nThe parents really wanted their daughter to get an education. Therefore, 7-year-old Diana was sent to a special school for blind children. She was very homesick, and to cope with her sadness, she began to sing. Her parents supported the girl’s creative inclinations, and soon she began studying with a vocal teacher. Later, Diana managed to learn to play the piano, although it was not easy. She had to memorize everything by ear, but her persistent efforts were not in vain.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya always appears on the big stage in an image familiar to the viewer. And even in glossy magazines it is difficult to find a photo of her without glasses with with open eyes. Not long ago, the artist decided to make an exception and please fans and journalists by appearing in a new image without dark glasses. This prank caused a lot of feedback from different segments of the population.​\n\nShocking image of a romantic singer\n\nI decided to appear in a new role for the sake of filming a new video. Working on a video format song written by a brilliant composer Viktor Drobysh’s “I’m Losing You” became the reason for the appearance on the Internet of a photo of the singer without glasses with her eyes open. For the sake of filming, the woman abandoned her usual pop image.\n\nIn the photo, Diana's eyes are covered with a floral print ribbon, after which it is replaced by an elegant lace stripe. Critics considered this move quite bold and interesting.\n\nA curious moment in the video was the footage where Diana Gurtskaya appears without glasses with her eyes open, which immediately appeared in the photo in the media. The actress decided to give up the glamorous headbands, painting her eyelids with black shadows in the smoky eye style.\n\nThe parents did not immediately realize that the girl was losing her sight.\n\nIN early childhood Diana showed no signs of vision problems. She behaved in the same way as her peers and her gaze was not clouded. But when her parents made a small rearrangement in the house, she fell while trying to sit on the sofa and severely mutilated her face. Frightened parents took her to the doctor for an examination, as a result of which it became clear that Diana’s gaze wandered and did not focus on surrounding objects.\n\nFor the first ten years, the parents took the girl to ophthalmologists, wanting to find a specialist who could cure the eye disease. But they all made the same diagnosis - this disease is incurable.\n\nHaving failed to find a way for their daughter, her parents sent her to a specialized boarding school for children with congenital blindness and vision problems.\n\nBut for Diana this was not enough. She dreamed of sitting down at the piano and learning to play. Therefore, while studying in Tbilisi, she convinced the teachers Music school that he can play by ear. Regular classes helped her develop not only the ability to play, but also to sing. At the age of 10, she was already performing on the stage of the Philharmonic and was not shy about the audience.\n\nIn subsequent years, the amazing girl achieved incredible results in music. She managed to get through Russian stage thanks to my talent, not connections. And over the years of work, she developed a taboo: “never insist on your own exclusivity and do not evoke pity from others.” Therefore, Diana's image is always ideal. She takes care of her own appearance and always leaves the house with perfect makeup and watches her figure. Many world stars cannot boast of such scrupulousness.\n\nDo you like the work of Diana Gurtskaya?\n\nVote\n\nVision problems did not prevent Diana Gurtskaya from going on stage music festival by taking part in an international competition. This is how the first photos of the performer without glasses with her eyes open appeared in the media. She did not want to show the judges her exclusivity and arouse pity.\n\nThe woman is still proud that she was noticed by Igor Krutoy and other masters of show business thanks to her talent, and not blindness. They learned that the girl could not see anything much later during the signing of the contract.\n\nPopularity and career rise\n\nThe song “You are here”, performed by Diana Gurtskaya on the big stage, created an incredible sensation. The singer sang it so emotionally and truthfully that most of the spectators had tears streaming down their cheeks.\n\nNever before have songs been performed with such emotional anguish in the voice. So Diana was not only remembered, but also loved. She managed to penetrate the soul of every listener, leaving an indelible mark on it.\n\nThe singer's first album, released a year later, was sold out as soon as it hit the windows of specialized stores. It was a success that Diana's mother would be proud of. But she could only watch her career take off from heaven. That is why Gurtskaya’s performance was so reverent and lively.\n\nHaving started her career on the big stage, she continued to develop further. Without placing emphasis on her exclusivity, the girl first entered the Gnessin School, and then the first time to GITIS. Having mastered the basics of creativity at the institute, Diana continued to rapidly rise through the ranks career ladder and delight fans with new albums and performances.\n\nBut even though she never seeks to promote herself, photos without glasses still appear on the Internet. They show that Diana has a slightly squinted gaze. This is the only thing that distinguishes a woman from other people."
