Diana translates to the Latin form Artemis. The name can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-European root *dyeu or *dyeus and *div- meaning \"to shine\" (diya-) or \"sky\", dius, deus and diwio, \"deity, god, godlike\" and dium meaning Universe. The meanings are therefore \"heavenly\", \"holy\", \"divine\", \"demonic\", \"celestial\", \"cosmic\", \"nebulous\", \"chaotic\", \"abyssal\", \"void\", \"luminous\", \"shining\", and in a broader sense \"which brings the day\", \"which has light\", \"which has divine power\", \"which belongs to the void/abyss/chaos\" and \"which comes from the Universe/outer space\". The word “Diamond”, or “Diamante” in French, is also brought from the Proto-Indo-European word “diya-“, which means bright light.\n\nDiana was already in use as a given name in ancient Rome, but exclusively outside Christian circles, in which it was seen as a pagan name. In Italy, the variant \"Daiana\", an adaptation based on the English pronunciation, is also common. The French variant \"Diane\" gained popularity during the 19th century.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales, British humanitarian and member of the British royal family\n\nDiana, Brazilian singer\n\nDiana Abu-Jaber, American author and a professor at Portland State University\n\nDiana Adlienė, Lithuanian medical physicist\n\nDiana Akiyama, American episcopal bishop and academic\n\nDiana Al-Hadid (born 1981), American contemporary artist\n\nDiana Álvares Pereira de Melo, 11th Duchess of Cadaval, Portuguese noblewoman\n\nDiana Abgar (1859–1937), Armenian writer, humanitarian and diplomat\n\nDiana Abla (born 1995), Brazilian water polo player\n\nDiana Adams (1926–1993), American ballerina and ballet teacher\n\nDiana Adamyan (born 2000), Armenian violinist\n\nDiana Aga, Filipino-American chemist\n\nDiana Agrest, American architect and urban designer\n\nDianna Agron (born 1986), American actress\n\nDiana Aguavil (born 1983), Ecuadorian indigenous leader\n\nDiana Akhmetova (born 1994), Russian weightlifter\n\nDiana Al Shaer, Russian-born Palestinian dressage rider\n\nDiana Albers, American comic book letterer\n\nDiana Alfaro (born 2001), Peruvian footballer\n\nDiana Allen (1898–1949), American actress\n\nDiana Amft (born 1975), German film, television actress and children's writer\n\nDiana Anaid (born 1976), Australian alternative rock singer-songwriter\n\nDiana Anderson (born 1935), British nurse, midwife and civil servant\n\nDiana Anderson (scientist), British biomedical scientist\n\nDiana Andimba, Namibian model\n\nDiana Andringa (born 1947), Rwandan actress\n\nDiana Angwech, Ugandan lawyer\n\nDiana Ankudinova (born 2003), Russian singer\n\nDiana Arbenina (born 1974), Russian poet, singer, musician and leader of the rock group Nochnye Snaipery\n\nDiana Archangeli, American linguist\n\nDiana Arevalo (born 1981), American politician\n\nDiana Arismendi (born 1962), Venezuelan composer\n\nDiana Armfield (born 1920), British artist\n\nDiana Arno (born 1984), Estonian model\n\nDiana Arón (1950–1975), Chilean journalist\n\nDiana Arterian, American poet, writer, critic, editor, and translator\n\nDiana Ashton (born 1955), British swimmer\n\nDiana Athill (1917–2019), British literary editor, novelist and memoirist\n\nDiana Atkinson, Canadian writer\n\nDiana Atwine, medical doctor and civil servant\n\nDiana Aviv, South African American business executive\n\nDiana Avsaragova, Russian mixed martial artist\n\nDiana Axinte (born 1996), Romanian handballer\n\nDiana Ayala (born 1973), American politician\n\nDiana Aydosova (born 1995), Kazakhstani racewalker\n\nDiana Bacosi (born 1983), Italian sport shooter\n\nDiana Baig (born 1995), Pakistani cricketer\n\nDiana Baldwin, American coal miner\n\nDiana Balmori (1932–2016), American landscape designer\n\nDiana Bang, Canadian actress and writer\n\nDiana Barnato Walker (1918–2008), British aviator\n\nDiana Barrett, President and founder of the Fledgling Fund\n\nDiana Barrington (born 1939), British actress\n\nDiana Barrows (born 1966), American actress\n\nDiana Barry (born 1986), Scottish footballer\n\nDiana Barrymore (1921–1960), American actress\n\nDiana Basho (born 2000), Albanian swimmer\n\nDiana Baumrind (1927–2018), American clinical and developmental psychologist\n\nDiana Bautista, American neuroscientist\n\nDiana Beaumont (1909–1964), British actress\n\nDiana Beck (1900–1956), English neurosurgeon\n\nDiana Becton (born 1951), Contra Costa County District Attorney\n\nDiana Belbiţă (born 1996), Romanian mixed martial artist, and former kickboxing, judo and kempo practitioner\n\nDiana Bellamy (1943–2001), American actress\n\nDiana Bellessi, Argentine poet\n\nDiana Bendz, American polymer scientist\n\nDiana Berg (born 1979), Ukrainian activist and graphic designer\n\nDiana van Berlo (born 1966), Dutch singer\n\nDiana Bernal (born 1963), Mexican jurist and politician\n\nDiana Bianchedi (born 1969), Italian fencer\n\nDiana W.
