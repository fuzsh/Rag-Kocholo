        "text": "Roman was born early in the 30th week of pregnancy, weighing 1328 grams and measuring 39 cm tall. Roman has been a fighter since birth ...\n\nUnfortunately, doctors did not notice the detachment of Roman's retina in time in the maternity hospital, which led to total blindness. During 5 years of Roman's life 10 surgeries have been made on his eyes to save them as an organ, as aesthetic appearance is also important. In his left eye, Roman still has light perception, which allows him to orientate himself well in space. Unfortunately, science and medicine have not yet learnt how to restore full vision in case of total retinal detachment. And now Roman needs only organ- saving surgeries for aesthetic appearance and to prevent frequent haemorrhages in his eyes due to high pressure.\n\nDiagnosis: Stage 5 Retinopathy of Prematurity.\n\nDespite his diagnosis, Roman is a very active boy. Since the age of 2.5 he has been swimming. From the age of 4 he started to study music, in particular vocal and piano. Roman himself by hearing picks up notes on the piano and plays melodies.\n\nI am raising Roman alone, as his father left us when he learnt about his diagnosis at the age of 2 months. In 2023 we moved from Almaty, Kazakhstan to Moscow, as Moscow offers great prospects in education, treatment and rehabilitation. We moved to Moscow with Roma and my mum (Roman's grandmother). Unfortunately, my mum also has a disappointing diagnosis - Alzheimer's and dementia. I can say I have two children on me - the oldest and the youngest. So far we are living in a rented flat.\n\nIn Moscow, Roman takes vocal lessons at Diana Gurtskaya's Centre for social integration, and he also attends piano and vocal lessons at the \"Rock Time\" music school.\n\nRoman is a very active, cheerful and musical child. He dreams of going to the sea, where there is sand and shells. This year Roman even asked to buy him a bucket and a trowel, because he believes that his dream will come true and he will visit the sea. Roman also has a dream to have his own room, where he could place all his musical instruments and, most importantly, a climbing wall for sports. That's why Roma and I are saving up for our own small but cosy flat, and Roma even has his own piggy bank ...\n\nOur motto: The impossible is possible!\n\nRegards,\n\nMum Daria\n\n*The donation fee includes:\n\nAirline tickets to Cyprus\n\nTransfer Larnaca - Paphos\n\nProgramme for 12 days\n\nPetrol expenses\n\nMeals\n\nExcursions\n\nEntertainment"
