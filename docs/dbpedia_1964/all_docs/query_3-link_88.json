        "text": "[…] Russia claims Ukraine attempted to assassinate Vladimir Putin. Assassinating a President is an Act of War, whether successful or not. This attack clears the way for Russia to declare war on Ukraine, and mobilize its entire population to conquer Ukraine. The US and Europe may then use their militaries to prevent this, which could start WWIII and a nuclear war.\n\nWhile we are still a longways from this doomsday event, this attack has made a pathway to it.\n\nThe title picture is just one of the pieces of evidence to support the conclusions of this article. The picture shows a reflection in the window of a room that could well be the control room of the staged drone attack. [Image at the link] The woman is holding something in her hand that looks to be a cell phone, and may have set off the explosion of the drone. She is illuminated by the explosion she is looking at, causing her reflection in the window.\n\nThe picture is from the best video of this drone attack. The full picture is displayed below. She is in the upper right of this picture. The best video can be found at: en.wikipedia.org/…\n\nAlso seen in the picture of the blue woman is a brown bulletin board in the background with various papers neatly pinned to it. In the left is a brown desk with a black computer monitor on it.\n\nIn the larger picture, there is another reflection of a desk with a computer monitor on the left.\n\nIf one listens carefully to the soundtrack of the video, one can hear something drop early on. Then, when the drone appears in the upper left, a short, low audible gasp can be heard. The gasp sounds like it is from a man.\n\nEven though an explosion is heard in the video, one doesn’t hear it in the soundtrack. The control room must be soundproof, which is typical for control rooms.\n\nIn order for the people in the room to be ready to film the drone attack, as well as to set off the explosion, they had to know when the drone was coming. The only way they could have known this is for the attack to be staged.\n\nThere are three other videos of the drone attacks from the BBC — 2 from cell phones, and one from a camera. It is found at http://www.bbc.com/…, and contains a running commentary and the video discussed above. A picture from the other video camera is below, and shows the likely location of the control room.\n\nThere are over 10 pieces of evidence to support the claims of this article, including those above. Some of this evidence is presented below in outline format for ease of reference. There are two pictures that are annotated with numbers and letters that refer to the evidence below for ease of location. Two have been given above. The other is below. [Photos at the link]\n\n1. Russia says that the drone was destroyed by its Air Defense. However, we don’t see any tracers, missiles, or anything else hitting the drone prior to its explosion. Russia also says the drone was destroyed by “electronic radar assets.” However, radar isn’t used to blow up drones. It is used to find drones. (Also, all radars are electronic.)\n\n2. The drone got way too close to its target before exploding. If this was a real attack, then the drone should have been shot down well away from the Kremlin. Instead of a successful defense of the Kremlin, this appears to be a failure of Russian Air Defense.\n\n3. Flags — the waving of the flags is inconsistent with the drone attack videos\n\nA. The small flag flying on top of the Senatskaya Tower continues to wave the same way throughout the explosion, oblivious to the explosive forces. However, the nearby flag flying on top of the Senate dome stops waving just after the explosion.\n\nB. The flag on top of the Senate dome should have been incinerated by the fireball, but it survived.\n\nC. The Senate flag in the second BBC cell phone video is strongly waving after the explosion, despite something burning beneath the flag pole.\n\n4. The drone is white in the best video. The drone should be black to avoid detection.\n\n5. The drone looks like it is coming in for a landing instead of an attack. Just before the explosion, the drone has leveled out, and pulled slightly up from its prior trajectory.\n\n6. The smoke from the explosion quickly dissipates and then the best video stops. The two cell phone videos show smoke rising from the direction of the Senate Building. One of these is from the same view as the best video of the drone attack. If this was a real drone attack, then there would be no need to stop the best video, nor to rely upon two cell phones for video of the smoke.\n\n7. We aren’t shown any pictures or video of the damage from the drone attack, nor do we see the wreckage of the drone. In a real drone attack, we normally are shown the damage and the remains of the drone. But, Russia says no damage occurred, despite the videos of the smoke and something burning on top of the dome. If the drone attack was staged, then there shouldn’t be any damage, and Russia wouldn’t want to show the drone, or whatever was used to represent the drone.\n\n8. The best video is said to be from a CCTV camera. However, there is no time and date stamp on the video. These are hallmarks of surveillance CCTV videos. Furthermore, the best video is slightly moving up and down and from right to left. Such movement is typical for a hand held camera, but not for a fixed CCTV camera. As described in the initial comments, the camera being used for the best video was from the likely control room, as opposed to a CCTV camera.\n\n9. Russia needed 12 hours before posting the videos and making their claims. This provided them the time to edit and photoshop the videos.\n\n10. The Institute of War (ISW) said that this 12 hours was fast for a Russian response. It normally takes at least 24 hours for them to respond to a surprise event. Partly based upon this comment, as well some other reasons (but no detailed analysis of the videos), they concluded that the drone attacks were staged. The ISW analysis and conclusion can be found at http://www.understandingwar.org/…, 2nd full paragraph.\n\nRussia says that there were two drone attacks. The second attack is said to be shown in the second full video is in the BBC article. A picture of when the explosion is just occurring is shown earlier. There are workers in the right foreground of the picture (labeled W). In the video, the workers are moving around, and oblivious to the explosion that is occurring. This behavior is in contrast to the people in the best video. The two men climbing the ladder on the dome duck when the explosion occurs (labeled M). There is also someone walking or riding a bike in the bottom of the video (labeled P). They appear to stop and look up when the explosion occurs.\n\nIn this video, there are red circles showing the drone approaching. When these circles are blown up, there is nothing inside of them, just black. [images at the link]\n\nAs such, it is doubtful that this video shows an attack. Instead, it looks like this video has been photoshopped to show where Russia says there is a drone, and an explosion has been added to the video at the far left. […]\n\nIn shocking news, it turns out that the mass shooter in Allen, Texas, who had all the Nazi tattoos may perhaps have been a Nazi. Yes, even though his name sounded Hispanic.\n\nWhoa if true, this is very confusing, but only if you are a goddamned moron who thinks all people with Hispanic names are some unknowable race of Latino Mexican Spanishes who hail from somewhere south of US America. (Insert general “pointing toward the south” hand gesture here.)\n\nHe had a patch on his vest with the letters “RWDS.” This stands for “Right Wing Death Squad,” and it’s a patch you see a lot in pictures of the Proud Boys on January 6 and also other dates. It’s a right-wing, white supremacist Nazi thing, connected to a meme really popular among those sorts that says “Pinochet did nothing wrong.” White supremacist Nazis in America idolize Pinochet, who terrorized the … [checks globe] … Latin American nation of Chile.\n\nblue checks insisting that Latinos who wear “Right Wing Death Squad” patches and celebrate Pinochet can’t have neo-Nazi ideas should try to learn more about … right-wing death squads and Pinochet.\n\nMuch of this is, also, symptomatic of the internationalization of the far right, promoted by Dugin’s neo-Eurasianist geopolitics through conferences drawing together fascists and the radical right in a network of solidarity against liberalism [Rachel Maddow noted that CPAC was holding another conservative conference in Hungary]\n\nBut yes, do please tell us more about how people with Hispanic-sounding last names could not possibly be Nazis.\n\n[…] But now reporters are digging even deeper, and boy howdy, the things they’re finding.\n\nNBC News reports that the shooter had a profile on a Russian social media site called OK.ru, which as NBC reporter Ben Collins explained on MSNBC last night is kind of like their MySpace. He ranted about Jews and women and racial minorities, and apparently also shared stuff from known white supremacist Nazi and Donald Trump dinner date Nick Fuentes, which is weird, because again, how can Hispanic-sounding name be Nazi?\n\nHe posted pictures of the mall where he carried out his massacre, he praised the person who committed the recent massacre in Nashville for having a “decent kill score,” and of course he posted all kinds of pictures of his Nazi tattoos. He posted incel content.\n\nResearcher Aric Toler from Bellingcat went through all the content on the dude’s social media, and also posted an explainer showing how he was able to determine definitively that this was the shooter’s legit social media profile. [Tweet and image at the link]\n\n[…] [The murderer] whines about “drag queen story hour loser’s” [sic] and signs off with “Heil Hitler.” [Image at the link, he represents himself online with a happy face emoji altered to look like a smiling Hitler]\n\nYes, indeed, it’s hard to figure out what made this asshole tick.\n\nAnd for those who either are so stupid or are pretending to be so stupid as to not understand how a guy with a Hispanic name could be a Nazi, we just wish the killer had explained that for hims … [Tweet and image at the link, showing two paths for a Latino child, one path leading to” become a white supremacist” and one to “act black.”]\n\nOh.\n\nHis social media account also has a whole section of people dressed in Nazi garb who white Americans might not think of as white. […] Note that the first one has the “Pinochet did nothing wrong” caption.\n\nObviously, as we’ve mentioned a few times, the current prevalent idiot right-wing sentiment is that the mass shooter couldn’t be a Nazi because he has a Hispanic name. It’s being pushed by the absolute stupidest trolls in America, many of whom are white supremacists and Nazis themselves, and it’s being egged on by people like Donald Trump Jr.\n\nIt’s stupid, but if anyone is still skeptical that a person with Hispanic heritage could yes literally actually be a Nazi, here are some more facts:\n\nWe’ve already mentioned the dude’s affinity for Nick Fuentes. We could also mention people like former Proud Boy leader and Cuban American Enrique Tarrio as another example of a Latino person who is also a far-right extremist piece of shit. Or all these white nationalist Latinos.\n\nRead this thread from Northwestern professor and historian Kathleen Belew about the meanings of “whiteness,” how it’s not necessarily measured the same in the Latin American world as it is in the United States. Then maybe learn a thing about how Texas and the American Southwest in general are full of people with Hispanic-sounding names who wouldn’t consider themselves anything but white, or maybe Tejano, and yes, there are white supremacists among them. Just start googling. A good place to start is articles about how well Donald Trump did among Tejanos. [Tweet at the link]\n\nDid we mention Nick Fuentes? We’re worried we didn’t mention him five times already. He’s got Hispanic heritage. Super fuckin’ Nazi incel.\n\nHere are a couple clips from Ben Collins, should you need more things explained to you: [videos at the link: “there’s nothing complicated about tis. this ws a neo-Nazi, straight up. That’s what he was.” Panel of experts interviewed by Joy Reid; and an interview conduced by Stephanie Ruhle.]\n\nBy the way, send those to Elon Musk if you know him. Yeah, surprise, Elon is so gullible/stupid/racist that he’s spreading the conspiracy theories on the failing website he bought.\n\nIn summary and in conclusion, we hope this blog post has cleared up any lingering confusion over whether the guy with the Nazi tattoos who did the murders might have been a Nazi murderer. […]\n\nWe are devastated to learn of the death of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in eastern Ukraine today.\n\nAll of our thoughts go out to his family and loved ones.\n\nArman Soldin, who was our Ukraine video coordinator, was killed by rocket fire near Chasiv Yar, AFP colleagues who witnessed the incident said.\n\nThe attack happened in the town’s outskirts close to Bakhmut — the epicenter of the fighting in eastern Ukraine for several months. https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1655991467968430084\n\nAnother good reason why waiting is not a bad idea.\n\n[Tweet and video: “American-made M113 armored personnel carriers and a T-64BV tank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stuck in the mud” [holy shit]\n\nDespite earlier statements that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin’s busy schedule would keep him from standing at the podium for Moscow’s annual Victory Day parade, he did make a brief appearance on Tuesday. As it turns out, brief was all that was necessary. The parade was pitiful and Putin’s remarks were short.\n\nIn 2021 the Victory Day parade was marked by a flyover of Russian fighter jets and bombers, the march of the Immortal Regiment (a highly popular event in which relatives of those who fought in World War II process through the city carrying photos of deceased warriors), and 197 armored vehicles including tanks. In 2022, a bit more than two months after Putin launched his illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the number of armored vehicles in the parade was down to 131. That was a notable difference, but it was nothing like the decline seen this year.\n\nIn 2023, there was no flyover. The Immortal Regiment did not march. And the rolling stock was down to just 51 vehicles [including just one (1!) tank]. Meanwhile, dozens of cities across Russia—not just those bordering Ukraine, but as far away as Siberia—called off their parades entirely. Far from signaling victory, this seemed like a day in which Russia sent a visible signal that its military force is spent.\n\nAnd in Bakhmut, the Russian army, Wagner Group mercenaries, and another private army were all reportedly in retreat from areas of the city thousands of Russians had died to capture.\n\nFor a full rundown of the vehicles found in this year’s parade, you could not do better than this thread by OSINT analyst Oliver Alexander. You definitely need someone to walk you through it since, as Alexander points out, for the first time Moscow did not issue a guide for parade viewers showing the vehicles they should expect. [Tweet and image at the link]\n\nAs CNN reports, this isn’t quite what was expected, even by insiders.\n\nMore than 10,000 people and 125 units of various types of weapons and equipment were expected to be displayed at this year’s parade, according to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Last year the ministry announced 11,000 people and 131 types of weapons were involved in the military parade, with an airshow of 77 aircraft and helicopters.\n\nNo helicopters. No aircraft. Fifty-one vehicles. And while there’s no count on the people, it’s pretty clear that the number standing in Red Square is quite a bit smaller than in past years. To even get to 51 vehicles, the parade was padded out with 10 MRAPs borrowed from Kadyrov’s Chechen forces.\n\nHere’s something else to note about those vehicles. The count of actual tanks in the parade appears to be … one. A single World War II-era T-34 led off the parade. In past years, it was a group of these old tanks followed by T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks. Not this time. There doesn’t even seem to have been an appearance by the elusive T-14 Armata. [images at the link]\n\nAre the T-14s all in Ukraine? Are the rest of Russia’s T-34s in Ukraine? Is every tank mechanic in Russia so busy they didn’t have time to get these display pieces rolling in time for the parade? Considering the number of tanks Russia has lost in Ukraine, any or all of the above seems possible.\n\nReuters’ report on Putin’s brief speech in front of this diminished military included the statement that “A real war has again been unleashed against our homeland,” as well as claims that Ukraine was being held hostage to “Western globalist elites” spreading Russophobia. Even so, Putin declared that Russia would win out because of “greatness.”\n\nWhile Putin was giving a largely downbeat speech in front of his shrunken military, Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was giving a speech that absolutely was not about “victory.”\n\n[Tweet and video at the link] ❗️I think this might be the top-news for today.\n\nWhile Putin was speaking about “Russian greatness” in Moscow, Russian troops were fleeing in Bakhmut.\n\nPrigozhin said the 72nd brigade and Gazprom “Torch” PMC abandoned their positions after 500 Wagner members died to get them – the true face of “Russian might”.\n\nPlease consider sharing this.\n\nAs with anything Prigozhin says, this speech should be taken with whole buckets of salt. However, what he’s saying here is that Wagner has already left positions that it held in the city, turning them over to the 72nd brigade of the Russian army and to Gazprom’s mercenary force. According to Prigozhin, both of these groups immediately turned and ran, surrendering “three square kilometers” of Bakhmut. Prigozhin went on to threaten to abandon more positions after claiming that Wagner received only 10% of the artillery that was promised earlier this week (which is a reversal of Prigozhin’s last statement).\n\nFrom other sources:\n\n– On Monday, Ukrainian forces reportedly carried out a counteroffensive in the area around Bakhmut, liberating a square kilometer of area, possibly around the O0506 road through Khromove.\n\n– On Tuesday, Russian sources report that Ukrainian artillery hit Russian supply lines on the M03 highway from multiple directions, forcing Russia to reroute materiel coming into Bakhmut.\n\n– Members of the Azov brigade are claiming that they have retaken large areas in the city within hours.” (Note: this advance, assuming it is separate from the other reported advance on Monday, is not confirmed through the Ukrainian military)\n\nAs for what’s really happening with Wagner … who knows? Within 24 hours, Prigozhin first announced the withdrawal of his Wagner militia from Bakhmut, then reversed course after saying he had received ammunition, then claimed he had not received ammunition and claimed that Russian army units and Gazprom fighters were running, and most recently said he has started to receive artillery after all.\n\nIs Wagner staying? Is Wagner going? Is there any reason the Russian military allows Prigozhin to stay near the battlefield while making such derogatory statements about Russian forces? Who knows?\n\nTankie accounts in social media have now moved to “Bakhmut served its purposes of grinding down the Ukrainian army,” and have gone from praising Wagner to dismissing it as a “ragtag group of prisoners” that was never part of the Russian military in the first place. So there. Russia didn’t lose anyone at Bakhmut, because Wagner doesn’t count. There have also been a lot of restatements of Russia’s losses in World War II with the suggestion that what’s happening in Ukraine is just a flesh wound.\n\nMeanwhile, at VE Day celebrations in Europe… [Tweet and video at the link. Citizens in Poland forced the Russian Ambassador to leave the memorial service.]\n\nOn Wednesday, the disconnect between the reportedly departing Wagner Group mercenaries and Russian military forces moving to take their positions appeared to be getting worse. Not only were there reports the two sides had been ordered not to talk with each other—probably so Wagner forces couldn’t inform those troops just how bad things were at the actual front—there were also multiple videos on Wednesday morning of Russians in the area simply surrendering.\n\nWith Russia in disarray, Ukrainian forces have reportedly made advances in at least two areas. One of those is just south of Bakhmut, near the town of Bila Hora, where Ukrainian forces reportedly drove more than a kilometer into an area that had been occupied by Russia and took down a line of artillery. The second advance happened on the southern front, around 20 km west of Russia’s perpetual failure point at Vuhledar. In this area, Ukrainian forces also reportedly pushed the Russians back more than a kilometer.\n\nAs this was going on, Russia apparently tried to launch a mini-offensive in the north, attacking multiple objectives around Kupyansk and in the area around Kreminna. None of these seem to have left Russia in possession of any new territory, but they did rack up a lot of fresh scrap, with the Ukrainian military reporting 18 armored transports and two tanks destroyed.\n\nThat would be twice as many tanks as appeared in Moscow’s Victory Day parade. [LOL]\n\nWhen looked at on a map of the entire front, the number of Russian assaults still seems to greatly exceed the number of points where Ukraine attempted to advance. [map at the link]\n\nWith the Ukrainian military reporting 45 assaults by Russian forces over the last 24 hours, it may still be the case that Russia is more active. However, many of these are likely to be the small squad-sized operations Russia has routinely conducted as a means of “reconnaissance by force.” Since Russia has poor satellite data and generally much worse intelligence than Ukraine, these sorts of feeling-out operations are what they have when it comes to detecting the positions of Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe high level of activity in the northern half of the line likely represents either rumors—or hope—that Ukraine had shifted forces away from this area, leaving some opening through which Russia might secure an advance. Given that they still haven’t been able to take Bakhmut, and that Vladimir Putin was left without any victories to talk about on Victory Day, it’s entirely possible they’re looking for something, anything, that could be held up as a win. If that’s the case, they didn’t find it on Wednesday when the Ukrainian general staff reported every one of Russia’s advances was rebuffed.\n\nOne of the areas where Ukraine reportedly made advances was that spot in the south, which is along a highway running between the village of Zolota Nyva on the Ukrainian side, and the Russia-occupied town of Novodonetske. If Ukraine advanced as far as some accounts suggest, that may be the “formerly” Russian-occupied town, but at the moment, there’s no confirmation from the Ukrainian military.\n\n[…] The other reported area of Ukrainian advance was near Bakhmut, in the direction of the town of Klishchiivka, which the Russians captured back in February. Ukrainian forces reportedly moved from locations near Ivaniske and Stupochky to assault Russian defensive lines along the edge of a secondary road and a drainage ditch, successfully dislodging Russian forces and destroying a series of artillery guns. And this time, there are videos to support the claims. [Tweet, video, and photo at the link, video includes trolling Prigozhin and a Ukrainian tank crushing Russian bunkers.]\n\nThis is an area where Wagner is reportedly handing over to the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian armed forces. But to say that handoff isn’t going smoothly is badly understating the situation.\n\nHere’s Dmitri with some Russian communications claiming that the regular army and the Wagner forces aren’t allowed to talk. [Tweet at the link: “”All against all…complete disunity of the front” – Russian volunteer Anastasiya Kashevarova explains what happened between Wagner and the 72nd Brigade in Bakhmut in a long Telegram post.\n\nShe says Russian Forces are not allowed to communicate with Wagner. Wagner was forced to retreat in one area as Ukrainians exploited weakness and broke through. She says the 72nd had no idea and no troops in the area to cover.\n\nShe also says Russian sides all hate each other, making fun of each other. She calls for unity or the war will not be won.\n\nTranslation in 3 screenshots (long read).”]\n\nAnd here’s one of the results of that lack of communication and the disorder it’s bringing to Russian forces around Bakhmut. [Tweet at the link: “⚡️Russian brigade flees Bakhmut. Ukraine’s Third Assault Brigade confirmed on May 9 that the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces has fled Bakhmut.]\n\nThere have since been claims that those numbers included above, which had indicated 64 Russian service members lost, wasn’t even half of the actual losses. Unconfirmed reports state that Russian forces lost two entire companies, which would be between 200 and 300 men. The 72nd Brigade of the Russian military is said to be in complete disarray and no longer effective.\n\nReports of what happened from Russian sources suggest that Wagner shifted some of their troops off the line to address a Ukrainian attack at another point. But because the two groups didn’t communicate, the regular military troops didn’t know this was happening. That left the 72nd with a line of artillery with no screen of infantry to protect them. And Ukraine noticed.\n\n[…] None of this represents “the counteroffensive” that everyone is expecting. The Ukrainian general staff continues to show new equipment entering the country and thousands of soldiers training away from the front lines. The counteroffensive could begin tomorrow, or it may not start for months. In the meantime, Ukrainian forces around Bakhmut seem to have stopped backpedaling and begun pushing forward against a Russian military that no longer seems to have any coherent plans.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that Russian guns have gone silent. Wagner Group is reported to be still fighting intensely on the north side of the city and forces from the 57th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade are reported to be pushing in from the east to occupy former Wagner positions. The situation is anything but calm or stable.\n\nBut those internecine squabbles within the Russian force attacking Bakhmut are starting to have real consequences on the ground. Whether those effects will go beyond this small advance aren’t clear, but we can hope.\n\nGoing back to that message translated by Dmitri…\n\nRussians: “We haven’t seen battalions of the LNR and DNR for a long time, are they still fighting?”\n\nLNR and DNR: “Where are all the Russian armed forces?”\n\nFirst brigade: “Wagner stole a tank from us.”\n\nWagner: “They crushed our pickup.”\n\nThe Russian military: “The Chechens were not there at all, just us.”\n\nThen Prigozhin and Kadyrov stab each other while Girkin throws shit on everyone.\n\nWhen Russia is tearing its own military apart so effectively, it’s almost a shame to attack them.\n\n[…] CNN has guaranteed that questions will come from a hall filled only with Republicans and “undecided voters.” There’s a possibility that no one will even bother to ask Trump about Carroll’s successful sexual battery and defamation case against him. That case concluded yesterday with a jury determining that Trump met Carroll outside the Bergdorf Goodman department store, asked her to help him select some lingerie for a gift, pulled her into a dressing room, slammed the door, pressed her up against the wall, and sexually assaulted her. And then he lied about the event, demeaned Carroll repeatedly, and insulted her on both social media and national TV for years.\n\nIt hasn’t actually been determined if Donald Trump could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without shaking any of his MAGA faithful, but it seems clear that he can assault a woman in a dressing room. As NBC News reports, “good Christian” Mike Pence doesn’t think Trump will pay any price with his voters for that little sexual battery thing. In fact, Pence wonders why this is even a story.\n\n“It’s just one more instance where,” said Pence, “at a time when American families are struggling, when our economy is hurting, when the world seems to become a more dangerous place almost every day [there’s] just one more story focusing on my former running mate that I know is a great fascination to members of the national media, but I just don’t think is where the American people are focused.”\n\nYes. Why should the American people care if the guy who tried to get Pence killed also happens to be a sexual abuser? When can the media get back to lying about the price of eggs and making people even more afraid of immigrants?\n\nAs NPR reports, Licht is in full agreement with Pence because:\n\nIn his first year on the job, chairman and CEO Chris Licht has sought to put his mark on the network [CNN] by draining it of the relentless criticism of Trump in response to the crises and controversies that defined his administration.\n\nJust a brief reminder that the four years in which Trump occupied the White House consisted of nothing but crises and controversies. From a Republican-led Senate finding that Trump’s campaign had over 100 contacts with Russian agents to his departure following the insurgency on Jan. 6, every day of Trump in Washington was filled with Trump declaring that he wouldn’t defend NATO partners, calling American veterans who died in World War II “losers,” trying to blackmail Ukraine into lying about his political opponent, and little things like an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who conducted his business in a “cone of silence” and an Interior secretary who made a disaster so much worse. And to top it off, there were a million people dying in a pandemic while Trump encouraged people to take a medicine for deworming horses, and an economic collapse that resulted in millions losing their jobs.\n\nAny network that refused to talk about these things would be … Fox News, which seems to be just where Licht wants to steer CNN. As Fox tries to get out from under Trump, it seems like Licht is anxious to crawl under him. In spite of loud protestations about “neutrality” and the importance of hearing multiple voices on every issue, the number of candidates CNN has approached with opportunities like the one Trump is getting on Wednesday night is exactly one.\n\nAccording to CNN Political Director David Chalian, the network considers Trump a “unique candidate,” citing that he’s the first former resident of the White House to lose and then try to make a comeback in more than a century, so they’re giving him a very special evening to make his case.\n\nExcept that circumstance is exactly why all this is so ridiculous. No one has had more airtime than Trump. No one in history. The American people don’t have any question about who Trump is or what he stands for. Trump has answered those questions. No one needs a meet-and-greet with Donald Trump.\n\nOf course, CNN knows that. They know exactly what they’re getting.\n\nTrump is going to lie about the 2020 election and make false claims about everyone from Biden to election workers. These claims have been not just debunked in public but dismissed in court. He’s going to lie about his 34-count indictment in New York while attacking the Manhattan district attorney, the members of the grand jury, and his own former attorney.\n\nShould any of his adoring fans holding the town hall microphone lob him a softball about the woman who dared accuse him—coiner of the phrase “grab ’em by the [P-word]”—of rape, and the darned New York jury that found him responsible, Trump will lie about that, too.\n\nWill host Kaitlan Collins do anything about Trump’s lies? That seems doubtful. With no other candidates to repudiate Trump’s statements and a roomful of supporters to shout down any less-than-worshipful words, the event seems tailor made to simply let Trump do Trump.\n\nWhich is exactly what Licht [CEO of CNN] wants. Despite saying that he’s all about hearing from “both sides,” he has arranged an event for just one voice—the voice of the man who dragged a woman into a dressing room, sexually assaulted her, then dismissed her as too ugly to be worthy of his attention. This isn’t Trump coming onto America’s televisions to apologize or heal. He’s only there to do what he always does–make things worse.\n\n[…] too much willingness to provide a platform for lies.\n\nCNN is showing just how bad the media can be when it really works at it.\n\nOn Monday, Rachel Maddow used part of her A-block to discuss a series of events Eric Trump, one of the […] sons of known sexual assaultist Donald Trump, has been doing alongside some of America’s best and brightest Nazis and antisemites. And the party, which is called “ReAwaken America,” is coming to Trump’s Doral International Hotel in Miami!\n\nIt’s not just Eric and the Nazis. There’s also that large Meatball McPeenerToilet dude Matt Whitaker who served as Trump’s acting attorney general, and Michael Flynn, who arguably sold out his country. (Not our words. Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan’s words.) Also some other [people] like Michael Pillow, who makes the pillows, and that superfuckingidiot woman Lara Trump, who (get this) was […] married Eric Trump on purpose, and not because a warlock had kidnapped her family, put a spell on them, and said the only way to break the spell is for Lara to marry Eric Trump.\n\nBut yeah, then there are these Nazis. Rumble streaming show host Scott McKay, who thinks the Jews killed Abraham Lincoln. And who thinks the Jews did the Oklahoma City bombing. And who thinks the Jews brought Hitler to power in the first place, just so they could do Jewish conspiracies to take him down.\n\nAnd Rumble streaming show host Charlie Ward, whose show graphics once included some of the biggest American media figures of the 1930s with Stars of David on their foreheads, because they were part of the great Jewish conspiracy to make Hitler and Germany look bad. Who believes the Jews created 9/11, and also the flu, measles, polio, and AIDS. Who believes the COVID vaccines have killed more people than the Holocaust did. And so much more, on both of these guys!\n\nThis is who Eric Trump has been touring with.\n\nAnd he is gonna SUE Rachel Maddow for saying it! Guess he wants to pay some of her legal fees.\n\nLet us give Eric’s tweet the attention it deserves: [Tweet at the link]\n\nThe text:\n\n.@maddow is walking a fine line. We are the most pro-Israel family in American political history – from the Abraham Accords, moving the embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights to sanctioning Iran, no one has done more for Israel than our family.\n\nStupid Eric is doing that antisemitic thing where he equates “sucks Benjamin Netanyahu’s asshole” with being pro-Jewish. It’s antisemitic because it suggests Jewish people inherently have dual loyalty to America and to Israel, and that doing whatever Israel’s current right-wing government wants is tantamount to supporting Jewish people. […]\n\nBut sure, Eric, Rachel Maddow is “walking a fine line,” by reading your touring mates’ Nazi words out loud. Go on:\n\nNever mind, that my sister, brother-in-law and niece and nephews happen to be proud Jews.\n\nBet he also has a Black friend!\n\nBTW it’s amazing how Ivanka and Jared really do seem to be sticking to this “Don’t want to ever interact with family or be publicly supportive ever again” thing.\n\nIf she or anyone else even remotely suggests I am anti-semitic I will not hesitate to take legal action against them personally.\n\nLMAO go fuck yourself.\n\nAll of this is funny because it is being said by this Trump here on the left. [giphy at the link]\n\nFor journalistic fairness, we should point out that we know that is not the real Eric, and we can tell because “Saturday Night Live” comic Alex Moffat’s face is put together normally […]\n\nOn Twitter, Eric Hananoki from Media Matters, who did much of the original reporting on the Nazis and antisemites Eric Trump is appearing alongside, is bringing even more receipts, while also pointing out that Wizard Brain Eric didn’t actually address any of the substance of the reporting.\n\nFor example, these tweets, which show Eric in pictures with these losers. [Tweet and images at the link]\n\nHananoki’s captions:\n\nMcKay said “Hitler was actually fighting the same people that we’re trying to take down today.” He’s also blamed Jewish people for 9/11 and presidential assassinations and said they torture and eat kids.\n\nWard shared posts that praised Hitler for “warning us” about Judaism and claimed “VIRUSES are Man (JEW).” He also promoted a book claiming “the official narrative of the Holocaust cannot be sustained.”\n\nYou can tell those are pictures of the real Eric Trump […]\n\nAlso because in the second pic of Eric with Ward, it’s more full-body, so you can see that well-documented problem the Trump men all have with standing up like normal people. Yep, that’s Eric with a Nazi.\n\nThis morning Eric is really dialing up the hysterical bullshit, tweeting pictures of his brother-in-law Jared presiding over his wedding and shrieking HOW CAN I BE ANTISEMITIC IF MY JEWISH BROTHER-IN-LAW SDFJAK;ZJSKDFJ;AIFYEISFAIFEAYIAYEEYYYYYYYYYYYIiiiiIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! (Approximate paraphrase.)\n\n[Tweet and image at the link] Two things: LOL bless Eric’s […] heart, but there is not one person in America right now who actually feels threatened by the redneck Republicans’ congressional probes into the Bidens. Especially not the Bidens.[…]\n\nSecondly, as Hananoki points out, that picture would be really cool if Eric and his wife Lara were not going to share a stage with somebody who said, “Hitler was actually fighting the same people that we’re trying to take down today” and who thinks that Jewish people torture and eat kids.\n\nJust …[Tweet and images at the link]\n\nIn summary and in conclusion […] here is a video of a distressed Eric Trump explaining how you can’t buy Tylenol at CVS because it’s locked behind glass and there’s too much looting and YOU CAN’T BUY IT, ALL HE WANTS IS SOME TYLENOL, SOMEBODY HELP ERIC! [Tweet and video at the link]\n\nGood God.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives voted yesterday to pass Senate Bill 763, a delightful little assault on the Constitution’s Establishment Clause that Texas lawmakers think might have a chance to win approval from the Alito Court, which last year decided school prayer was just peachy as long as it conforms with the “history and traditions” of whatever the Court thinks the Constitution means in any given case. SB 763 will allow school districts to hire “school chaplains” to provide the services that would normally be provided by a school counselor, only without the oppressive educational and professional certifications required of counselors.\n\nIt’s a really short bill, too! It adds this new bit to the state’s Education Code:\n\nSCHOOL CHAPLAINS. A school district or an open-enrollment charter school may employ or accept as a volunteer a chaplain to provide support, services, and programs for students as assigned by the board of trustees of the district or the governing body of the school. A chaplain employed or volunteering under this chapter is not required to be certified by the State Board for Educator Certification.\n\nThe bill also inserts a line that amounts to “and chaplains” to various parts of the education law discussing the duties of school counselors, including sections on providing mental and behavioral health support to students, as well as suicide prevention and intervention services. So when a student in a Texas school is in crisis, the person who they talk to might be a counselor with a master’s degree, extensive training, and a state teacher’s license, or it might be Volunteer Pastor Larry from the Potter’s House.\n\nTexas actually does require fairly extensive training for school counselors who aren’t chaplains. They need to have a master’s degree in counseling — from an accredited institution, even — and two years of classroom teaching experience, with the teaching credential to go with that. Then they have to pass a state certification exam. On the other hand as SB 763 says, a “chaplain” needs no certification at all. Fortunately, even non-certified school employees and volunteers in Texas schools must be fingerprinted and pass a criminal background check, so there’s that.\n\nFor some reason, a whole bunch of fussy “civil liberties” groups like the Texas Freedom Network are opposed to this innovative solution to school staffing shortages and insufficient injections of Jesus into education. For that matter, the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty isn’t so hot on it, either, even though SB 763 is sponsored by rightwing Republicans who insist it’s all about religious liberty and setting America back on the right path after all this wokeness.\n\nJennifer Hawks, associate general counsel of the Baptist Joint Committee, even said stuff that sounds like it might come from some lawyer from the A-C-L-Yewww:\n\nReligious instruction for Texas students is best left to houses of worship, religious institutions and families. Allowing Texas schools to hire anyone under the label of ‘chaplain’ to perform the work of school counselors threatens religious liberty by substituting an undefined religious title for licensed counselor. The goal of public schools is not religious indoctrination.\n\nHawks even said that if Texas schools need more counselors, it would make a lot of sense to hire more counselors instead of bringing in untrained pastors on the cheap.\n\nThe bill is being pushed by an outfit calling itself the “National School Chaplain Association,” whose homepage sports a diverse group of smiling children from stock photos, and which expresses very deep concerns about the challenges facing American young people these days:\n\nSuicide, anxiety, and depression have reached epidemic levels in U.S. schools. Chaplaincy has proven to dissipate tension, resolve conflict and bring hope.\n\nWho doesn’t want safe schools?\n\nWell gosh, everyone wants safe schools! So what do the chaplains offer to address those problems? Whoo, doggies, the tone changes immediately […] as the secular ills are answered with God and Country, timeless biblical values, and “prayer, counsel, and spiritual care,” which kind of sound like they’re all the same thing. […]\n\nIn some really eye-opening video, Rocky Malloy — the head honcho of the group, and also of the related “Mission Generation” — explains why schools should have chaplains instead of counselors. It’s all about using “the largest national network, the public school system, to bring Jesus to an entire nation.”\n\n[…] Malloy testified before the Texas House and Senate to share his ideas, although not all of them made it into the legislation. [Tweets and video at the link]\n\nMalloy explains that school chaplains will — at school districts’ expense — proselytize to school kids and staff, and bring “absolute truth” to counter all the crazy relativism in the schools, like the idea that trans people even exist, which they don’t, silly. In the second clip, Malloy explains that the First Amendment only means the state can’t sponsor churches, but churches are free to proselytize in schools, because chaplains “represent God, not religion.” Honestly, we’re going to need some case law on that.\n\nThe video doesn’t at all hide that Mission Generation’s goal is to use the schools to evangelize; none of your fluffy talk of merely supporting traditional values here. It’s all about bringing Jesus to millions of school kids, and how can anyone object to that without being a tool of Satan? […]\n\nIn other videos, Malloy explains that most chaplains for his group would only need a 48-hour training from Oklahoma Christian University and Focus on the Family to do their jobs, although people with no experience at all might actually need “30 credit hours” to qualify. But that’s only for his group, since SB 763 requires no training at all, so don’t sweat it. He also brags that his group “has a phone app” that covers pretty much all the issues a chaplain might need to deal with when counseling young people on matters like “suicide, you know, depression, whatever. So it gives you a biblical way to counsel or minister and pray with that child.”\n\nWe wish we were making that up. We are not.\n\nMalloy then explains that ideally, the states that institute chaplaincy will make it a full-time position, so the chaplains can also spend time going through the libraries and making sure no “evil books” are in the collection. What’s more, a chaplain would be able to police teachers’ classroom collections and confront teachers: “Why do you have hardcore porn in a third grader’s room?” and I guess now I have no choice but to embed the video so you can see it for yourself. [video at the link]\n\nThe chaplain bill is just one of several bills intended to turn Texas schools into Christian institutions, if the Supreme Court lets the Legislature get away with it. Other bills would require every Texas classroom to display a poster of the Ten Commandments (just one version, specified by law), that must be “in a size and typeface that is legible to a person with average vision from anywhere in the classroom in which the poster or framed copy is displayed,” and presumably if teachers put a hat rack in front of it they could be fired or perhaps shot.\n\nAnother bill would set aside time for “prayer and reading of the Bible or other religious text” during the school day, but only with written parental consent, so it’s not forced, you heathens. The bill would mandate that if parents give such consent, they also would waive any right to sue on First Amendment grounds, so it’s foolproof.\n\nThe House sponsor of DB 763, state Rep. Cole Hefner (R), said it’s needed to give schools\n\n“every tool that we can in the toolbox” to combat mental health problems and other crises. He conceded that districts could eventually replace all counselors with chaplains, and rejected Democrats’ amendments to require parental consent and that schools provide a representative of any denomination if requested by a student, teacher or parent.\n\nHefner also beat back a Democratic amendment that would have prevented taxpayer funds from paying for chaplains, explaining that “just completely messes up the purpose of the bill.” He didn’t clarify whether that purpose is to provide counseling, which it clearly doesn’t, or to bring the MAGA Jesus Gospel to kids in school.\n\nAnother Republican, state Rep. Brad Buckley, said that the Ten Commandments bill wouldn’t infringe on the rights of kids from secular or non-Christian families, since it only requires the posters be in every classroom, not that teachers instruct students about the poster that’s in every classroom. […]\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great victory for Jesus. Who really needs a Constitution when Republicans will tell us what’s legal and what isn’t, as need be.\n\nThe Alabama House is preparing to vote on a bill that would potentially turn every miscarriage or stillbirth into a homicide investigation. The bill could subject women to a detailed examination of every aspect of their lives for the “crime” of failing to deliver an infant to term, and would leave many facing both an intrusive presence and a threat of prison at the same time they are mourning a child […]\n\nBill HB454 redefines the words “murder” and “person” under Alabama law to make the loss of any fetus during pregnancy the exact equivalent of murdering a child: “Enforcement shall be subject to the same legal principles as would apply if the victim were a person who had been born alive.” Every abortion, every miscarriage, every stillbirth would all be subject to the same level of scrutiny as a child found dead. Police and prosecutors would be given the discretion to issue warrants, conduct inquiries, and indict women for their failure to deliver a live infant.\n\nMaking this so-called “pro-life” bill even more twisted, Alabama is not just a death penalty state, it’s the state with the highest rate per capita of people sentenced to death. Put it together, and there’s a real possibility of a woman being sentenced to death for a miscarriage.\n\nThe law does have some exceptions. A woman would not be found responsible if the cause of the ended pregnancy was “duress.”\n\nThat term also gets a special definition in this bill, making it not a crime if “the actor engaged in the proscribed conduct because he was compelled to do so by the threat of imminent death or serious physical injury to himself or another.”\n\nThat “he” and “himself” in the section above applies to the woman. It’s just that the law is written as if any actual person is a “he.” The woman is going to be “he” throughout most of this bill. Because God forbid someone in Alabama use “they” when creating a legal definition that applies to any gender.\n\nHowever, even the duress clause has an exception.\n\nThe defense provided by this section is unavailable if the actor intentionally or recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress. The defense is also unavailable if he was negligent in placing himself in such a situation, whenever negligence suffices to establish culpability for the offense charged.\n\nSo a woman could use the duress clause as a potential way to avoid being charged with murder if an abusive spouse either forced her to get an abortion or caused her to miscarry. However, it looks like this protection would be voided if the woman did something like return to a spouse who had been abusive, or place herself in some other position of danger, because she simply had nowhere else to go.\n\n[…] “The presumption that a woman is subject to compulsion when acting in the presence of her husband is abolished.” [WTF!]\n\n[…] The bill also provides some protection for medical personnel, who are given a pass so long as anything that happens to the fetus during some other procedure is accidental. Also, when attempting to save the life of the woman, “provided all reasonable alternatives to save the life of the unborn child were attempted.”\n\nThat last part is so purposely vague that not an obstetrician in the state is going to be fooled. There’s no level of care that can’t be nitpicked by an overzealous prosecutor.\n\nAll of this is astounding, but the most appalling part of this completely appalling bill may be this:\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of person for the purposes of the criminal code to include an unborn child from the moment of fertilization.\n\nThis is a bill that criminalizes both abortion and miscarriage, and starts the clock from a period when women don’t even know they are pregnant. The earliest a home test can detect a pregnancy is around 10 days after fertilization. Most physicians advise women not to even bother with a test until they have missed a period.\n\nEven among pregnancies that are detected, 10-20% end in miscarriage. That’s somewhere between 6,000 and 12,000 women every year in Alabama. […]\n\nEven those situations where a woman clearly has been abused so severely as to directly cause a miscarriage or has been forced into an abortion they didn’t want would involve that woman becoming a suspect in an investigation. It would be left to local prosecutors and police to decide if she had any fault in the loss of the fetus.\n\n[…] The Alabama law acknowledges that it will cost the state money to enact. It doesn’t say how much. But the potential for real emotional, mental, and physical harm is almost unlimited.\n\n[…] No lives will be saved by this bill, but the number of women who fail to visit a doctor, especially early in their pregnancy, out of fear of the consequences of this bill, will almost certainly be significant. And fully justified. That will lead to an increase, not a decrease, in the number of pregnancies that end in unplanned loss.\n\n[…] It’s about men subjecting women to an ever greater level of intrusion, restriction, and threat. It’s about putting those women in their place. It’s about control.\n\nAnd don’t worry. If a local prosecutor—say in one of those “blue cities”—is unwilling to spend police resources questioning neighbors to see if a woman might have been known to drink a glass of wine, or maybe eat too much fast food to be healthy, the bill allows the state attorney general to step in and take over the prosecution.\n\nDonald Trump, a room full of Trump supporters, and a single news host with absolutely no mechanism for reining in Trump’s statements. What could go wrong? […]\n\nFrom the very first moment of CNN’s beyond ill-advised open mic night for Trump, he simply lied in response to everything that host Kaitlan Collins asked and either ignored any attempt to correct his lies, or shouted (and sneered) Collins down with the help of a pro-Trump crowd, hand-picked by CNN, which cheered him at every lie, whooped over every insult, and applauded at every threat. [An ugly, ugly scene.]\n\nAt the end of the evening, CNN issued a statement saying, “Tonight Kaitlan Collins exemplified what it means to be a world-class journalist. She asked tough, fair and revealing questions. And she followed up and fact-checked President Trump in real time.” Anyone unfortunate enough to watch even a moment of the evening knows that CNN has confused the term “journalist” with “doormat.” A day after Donald Trump was held responsible for the sexual assault and defamation of one professional woman, CNN simply gave him another professional woman to humiliate in front of the nation. And he did. While a room full of adoring worshippers laughed.\n\nThe bullying, abusive, misogynistic aspect of the evening was there from the start as Trump talked over, mocked, and generally treated Collins like … like he treats any woman who dares to talk back to him.\n\nCollins and Trump have a history. As USA Today reported in 2018, Collins was pulled aside in advance of a White House briefing for asking “inappropriate” questions of Trump. Then she was told that she had been “disinvited” from a Rose Garden event on that day. This wasn’t the only time that Trump or his team went after Collins, and it’s certainly not the only time that Trump railed against CNN or banned members of the organization from the White House press briefing room.\n\nOn Wednesday night, new CNN CEO Chris Licht—who reportedly personally briefed Collins on how to handle Trump during the event—placed his reporter in an impossible position. Caught between a loud and disdainful Trump, an audience that encouraged his every moment of belligerence, and a format that gave her no means of maintaining decorum, Collins might as well have been handed over to Trump with a sign reading “Official Sacrifice.”\n\nWhen Collins attempted to ask Trump about the differences between his handling of classified documents and those of President Joe Biden, Trump did what he had already done at least a dozen times by then: He cut her off in mid-question.\n\nTrump: “Are you ready? Can I talk? Do you mind?”\n\nCollins: “Yeah, I would like for you to answer the question. That’s why I asked it.”\n\nTrump: “It’s very simple that you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you.”\n\nCrowd: [Big cheers, applause, laughter.]\n\nThat’s the evening in a nutshell. By the time things reached Trump looming over Collins, pointing at her, and calling her a “nasty person” in the middle of a response that made no sense but garnered big applause, any hint that there was something to be gleaned from this event was long, long gone.\n\nIt’s not that Collins didn’t ask good questions. She did. It’s not that she didn’t try to follow up, or that she hesitated in efforts to fact check at least some of Trump’s mile-a-minute lies. She did those things as well. It’s that the format of the event gave Collins absolutely no support. For the raucous crowd she was the perfect prop—the pretty woman that Trump could abuse for their amusement.\n\nAt several points, Collins appeared to serve as a proxy while Trump got the opportunity to further defame, demean, and belittle writer E. Jean Carroll. As columnist Ruth Ben-Ghiat put it, “CNN became a party to Trump’s need to psychologically ‘undo’ his defeat by getting the audience to applaud him for being an assaulter. The more approval authoritarians get, the more they feel emboldened to be even more lawless. This is why this ‘town hall’ was so dangerous.” Others have suggested that Carroll could sue Trump again over the ugly and humiliating statements for which CNN provided a platform.\n\nThrough the evening, there were a few moments of actual questioning worth repeating, mostly because of Trump’s refusal to answer. As when Trump equivocated into “I can’t recall” territory when asked if he had displayed classified documents to others at Mar-a-Lago. Or when Trump refused to say that he wanted Ukraine to survive Vladimir Putin’s invasion. But those moments were definitely not worth it. […]\n\nThe reviews for CNN’s stunt event are scattered across television and the internet on Thursday morning, and they’re uniformly as miserable as they should be.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called CNN’s decision to provide Trump with this prime time rally “a profoundly irresponsible decision” and “shameful.”\n\nJoe Scarborough at MSNBC called the event “just disgraceful on every level.”\n\nPodcast host Keith Olbermann declared it “the Hindenberg of TV News.” He also called for Licht to be fired.\n\nBut when critiquing CNN’s event, it’s hard to do better than CNN’s own Jake Tapper.\n\nThe falsehoods kept coming fast and furious about the January 6 insurrection, about vice president Pence, about Pence’s ability to overturn the election, about COVID, and about the economy and more. He called a Black law enforcement officer a “thug.” He said people here in Washington D.C.’s Chinatown don’t speak English. He attacked Kaitlan as a nasty woman because she was trying to get him to answer a question.\n\nPerhaps most chillingly, the day after a nine-person jury of his peers in New York found him liable for sexual battery and defamation and ordered him to pay writer E. Jean Carroll $5 million, he made fun of her account, of her sexual assault, and many in the audience laughed. [JFC]\n\nThat’s an accurate summary. It’s a shame that as Tapper was speaking, CNN was showing Trump still standing on the stage they provided, accepting a standing ovation from the audience they selected. Collins was nowhere to be seen as a smiling Trump continued to point at people in the crowd and banter with his fans.\n\n[…] Trump certainly seemed to like his evening.\n\n[…] Licht seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a news organization does. “Kaitlan pressed him again and again and made news,” Licht wrote to his staff on Thursday morning. “Made a LOT of news. And that is our job.”\n\nNo. It’s not.\n\nKaitlan Collins deserves an apology. So does America. […]\n\nIn a Thursday interview with European journalists, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine needs to wait before launching its long-expected counteroffensive. While some analysts have been expecting the next phase of Ukraine’s military action against Russia’s unprovoked invasion to come at any moment—and some online voices have been claiming that action has already begun—Zelenskyy said that while Ukraine could go ahead with a counteroffensive right now, it shouldn’t. Not if it wants to ensure its success and limit its losses.\n\nAs reported by the BBC, Zelenskyy noted that the Ukrainian military is “ready” after months of training. However, more equipment continues to arrive “in batches.” Perhaps the best reason to wait at the moment is that at least 80 Leopard 1 tanks are expected to be delivered between now and the first of June. Zelenskyy appears set on making sure that Ukraine has everything it needs not just to break through Russia’s frontline defenses, but to liberate a significant area, hold onto the territory it gains, and do so while losing a minimum number of troops.</b.\n\n\"With [what we already have] we can go forward, and, I think, be successful,\" said Zelenskyy, “but we'd lose a lot of people. I think that's unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.\"\n\nThe good news about Zelenskyy’s statements is that he expressed confidence Ukraine not only can be, but will be successful. While some other officials have spent the last few weeks trying to tone down expectations for what the counteroffensive will bring, Zelenskyy spoke firmly about moving Russian forces out of Ukraine.\n\nRecent statements and widely read analysis suggest that even if Ukraine’s counteroffensive is successful, it’s unlikely to dislodge Russia from a large part of Ukraine. Instead, recent articles have suggested that the best outcome is “a grinding war of attrition” lasting years, in which Russia’s population advantage is offset by the flow of Western weapons into Ukraine. That is, if such a flow can be maintained. Many recent articles urge Ukraine toward some kind of negotiated settlement, leaving Russia in control of Ukrainian territory based on the idea that without a string of victories, Western allies will lose interest in providing assistance to Ukraine.\n\nMany of those articles boil down to the same thing: Ukraine should take what it can get before either Republicans in the U.S. or conservatives in Europe decide that they are better served making an alliance with Putin. There is even speculation about what the U.S. will do if Ukraine’s counteroffensive turns out to be a total failure.\n\nBut Zelenskyy doesn’t seem to be counting on a long war of attrition, or to be worried about how the fate of Ukraine might swing on upcoming elections elsewhere. Asked about what might happen if Trump were to return to power, Zelenskyy’s answer was quick.\n\n\"Who knows where we'll be [when the election happens]?\" he said. \"I believe we'll win by then.\"\n\nDeclaring a belief that by November of 2024 the war in Ukraine will be over stands in stark contrast to the “we’ll need to nibble away at them for years” attitude surfacing from other sources, including officials inside Zelenskyy’s own Cabinet. Both the idea that Ukraine is not going to move right now, and that when it does move, its actions will be decisive, defy a lot of the chatter in media of all types.\n\nGranted, there’s no rule that says presidents have to be completely honest. That’s especially true when describing upcoming military plans. Zelenskyy’s statement that Ukraine won’t launch a full-on counteroffensive for some time may only be cover for troops massing outside of Kreminna or Donetsk for an attack on Friday afternoon. His confidence that Ukraine can score a significant blow against Russian forces may disguise knowledge of weakness.\n\nHowever, there are absolutely no weapons in this war that have been more valuable to Ukraine than the public trust Zelenskyy has engendered both at home and around the world. The trust and faith people have laid on him can’t be replaced by 1,000 shipments of ammo or all the Leopard tanks in the world. Zelenskyy is likely to understand that if he burns bridges in terms of either spreading misdirection about Ukraine’s next actions or the expected outcome, it’s one of the few things that really can affect that pipeline to fresh materiel in support of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy is, once again, the voice of cautious optimism. He’s making a disappointing decision to those who would like to see Ukraine move now. […]\n\nBut the Ukrainian president appears more concerned with making sure Ukrainian forces are successful at the lowest possible cost in terms of lives, and while he’s open about his belief that Ukraine can succeed, he’s playing the actual plans for that counteroffensive very close to the vest.\n\nNone of that seems like a bad approach.\n\nWHAT IF UKRAINE IS TOO SUCCESSFUL\n\nWhen it comes to believing that a properly timed, equipped, and targeted Ukrainian counteroffensive can generate substantial gains—delivering a massive blow to Russian forces—Zelenskyy is not alone. A new article published by the Modern War Institute at West Point looks at the possibility that Ukraine’s next action could absolutely blow Russia off the map of Ukraine. It also worries that such an event could result in chaos that the U.S. and other Western allies are unprepared to address.\n\nWhat if Ukraine ends up routing Russian occupation positions relatively swiftly and effectively, with the Russian military in a hopeless retreat?\n\nGiven recent reporting, it is not altogether clear that the United States and its allies are fully prepared for such a contingency, which, although perhaps less likely than the alternatives, is not as unlikely as many may think; and if leaders are not prepared, they should start preparing now, so as to avoid finding themselves on the back foot in a crisis of significant consequence.\n\nThe article lists a number of reasons why Ukraine can outperform the expectations so many have been working to lower. That includes the 230 new tanks, 1,550 armored vehicles, numerous air defense systems, and uncounted drones provided to Ukraine in the last few months. (The report notes that one thing missing is longer-range missiles—but they’re not missing anymore. More on this later.)\n\nNot only does Ukraine have all that new gear, it also has new units trained in combined-armed techniques, and new communications gear that can overcome Russian jamming to make larger, more complex maneuvers easier to achieve. If Ukraine works through or around the defensive lines that Russia has constructed, it could surprise Russian forces that are unprepared to defend the occupied areas in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, has confidently emphasized that because it enjoys numerical advantages in personnel and equipment, Russia will eventually prevail. However, this is the same failed logic that underpinned expectations of a quick Russian victory at the beginning of the war. A sole focus on personnel and equipment neglects an adequate accounting of training, morale, logistical support, and leadership.\n\nThe report also notes that if there’s one thing Ukraine has done throughout this war it is surprise the world through its “will to fight, its societal resilience, and its leadership.”\n\nRather than just preparing for a stalled situation that leads to negotiations where Russia gains more territory, the institute suggests that the U.S. also needs to plan for the opposite outcome. For “the event of a quick and cascading Russian loss.”\n\nThe emphasis of the report is that faced with a massive and decisive loss, Putin is likely to respond by escalation in the form of throwing still more bodies into the fight. Russia has a willingness to sustain huge losses and a population that can be forced into battle essentially (or literally) at gunpoint. Even so, “as was recently seen in Bakhmut and elsewhere, new Russian soldiers are poorly trained. Conscripts are thus often killed in droves—and not even the Russians have an infinite supply of human lives.”\n\nThat, unfortunately, brings the article back to the place where so many others have gone before: the idea that Russia would drag out a nuclear weapon to defend occupied territory in Crimea. How such a threat might be expected to work is beyond anyone’s reasoning. MAD, after all, only works so long as no one actually pushes a button. Once anyone does, the hollowness of such a concept is instantly revealed. Fortunately, the article starts by suggesting that the U.S. should take steps to clarify to Putin why ever reaching for that button is a bad idea.\n\nHowever, among those steps is both the idea that the U.S. should dissuade Ukraine from stepping into Crimea before conditions are in place for a negotiated settlement, and seeing that China is part of the deal.\n\nThere’s reasoning behind this last step. China’s cooperation is meant to ensure that Russia sees no alternative to not picking up a pen and signing. However, all of it comes back to the central point of contention—and to the idea that Ukraine should be expected to give over Crimea because not doing so makes us nervous.\n\nProminent media voices such as journalist Anne Applebaum and retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges have consistently advocated for the retaking of Crimea, arguing that such a move would effectively end the war. This may or may not be true, but the risks of nuclear escalation do not today warrant such an aggressive strategy.\n\nI’ve made it clear before that on this point, I definitely side with Applebaum and Hodges. Should Ukraine successfully punch through Russian forces elsewhere and enter Crimea, there is exactly nothing Russia might gain by hauling out a nuclear weapon. Nothing. It’s the one step that would, with absolute certainty, turn a defeat in a war outside its own territory into a multigenerational disaster that would likely end Russia as a nation.\n\nConsidering that this thought comes from very smart people connected to West Point and I’m an armchair analyst who was kicked out of the Air Force two weeks into basic training, any objective observer might reasonably conclude that the answer is: listen to the West Point guys.\n\nI am. And it definitely concerns me that they’re dragging the nuclear scenario onto the table again. However, my concern is diminished because they don’t seem to have anything behind it other than this:\n\nOne aspect of doctrine Russia has been consistent on is that Russia would at least consider the use of a nuclear weapon if Russian territory is being attacked. Since its annexation of Crimea almost a decade ago, Russia very much considers Crimea part of the Russian homeland.\n\nRussia has also officially annexed Kherson. And Zaporizhzhia. And Donetsk. And Luhansk. The “now we nuke ‘em” argument could have just as easily been applied at the beginning of the Kharkiv counteroffensive, or as Ukraine was ammo-starving Russian forces out of Kherson. In fact, it might have made more sense in either of those situations than saving such a threat until the point where the Russian military had been turned into paste and the only thing left in the Kremlin basement were those moldering bombs.\n\nThe problem with the “if Ukraine tries to get all of its territory back, Russia might use nukes” argument is that it is fundamentally the same as “if Ukraine tries to get any of its territory back, Russia might use nukes.”\n\nA policy that says we should require Ukraine to make concessions before it goes into Crimea is all too readily one that says the same about the whole of Donetsk, eastern Luhansk, or cities like Mariupol. Yes, Vladimir Putin has a special, fractionally warmer spot for Crimea in his otherwise frozen heart, but that doesn’t matter one iota in either how it fits with Russian military doctrine or how blindingly stupid it would be to drop a nuke anywhere in Ukraine.\n\nI don’t care if you can get your article published by the Modern War Institute. Ukraine is already on territory Russia claims as its own, and if that’s all you’ve got, any point you’re trying to make is already invalid.\n\nMaybe there really is a reason that we should tell Ukraine to hold back from crossing the line into Crimea. I haven’t seen it.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made clear on Thursday that, despite all the fingernail-chewing hype being spread across the internet by analysts counting every crate arriving in Lviv or making a deep-dive into the daily weather forecast at Bakhmut, the much-anticipated counteroffensive is still some weeks away. That makes perfect sense. Not only are thousands of Ukrainian troops still training on combined arms tactics and becoming familiar with new gear, that gear is still arriving.\n\nThe incoming equipment doesn’t just include a big bundle of Leopard 1 tanks that are likely to equip 20 new platoons: There continue to be surprises. Those include vehicles that have appeared in Ukraine even though they were never announced by allies, such as the new long range Storm Shadow cruise missiles which could result in genuine strategic changes in how Ukraine goes forward, and even some interesting homegrown experiments.\n\nBut as Ukraine prepares for the counteroffensive, Russian sources—both on the ground and on the internet—seem to believe that it is already here. Or over here. No, over here! Movements on the ground may be small, but the direction of those movements seem to have taken a serious shift in the past week as Russian forces have reportedly curled in on themselves in response to prodding by the Ukrainian military … or they’ve run away screaming.\n\nWhen it comes to what’s still to arrive in Ukraine, here’s something that few of the headlines ever pick up, but which signals how much is changing about war in the 2020s: crowd-funded warfare.\n\nEarly in the conflict, crowdsourced funding and private donations were used to purchase vehicles such as pickup trucks to supply to volunteers and medical personnel. Some groups have now purchased dozens of vehicles, painted and modified them to be more effective in the field, and provided them to both NGOs and military units. Some of those vehicles have undergone some fairly serious upgrades. [Tweet and images at the link. “Czech volunteers to donate 15 x mobile MR-2 Viktor anti-drone systems to Ukraine, equipped with twin 14.5 mm AA gun”]\n\nBut it doesn’t stop with ordinary cars and trucks. There have now been several instances in which such funding was used to purchase the same kind of gear that might otherwise be donated by a government—like a tracked armored personnel carrier with a machine gun and a few add-on grenade launchers. [Tweet and image at the link]\n\nHonestly, I do not know where you go to buy a Spartan for transnational shipment. Crowdsourced groups are also sending Ukraine a flood of body armor, communications gear, and drones. So many drones. [NOTE: None of these embedded links constitutes an endorsement of any of the groups involved. I have done no research and cannot vouch for their authenticity or effectiveness.]\n\nAll of this gear is given with the best of intentions. Some of it may be genuinely vital. However, just as with the plethora of systems coming from government sources, crowdsourced materiel—which may come after careful consultation with troops on the front line, or may have no more thought behind them than “I bet they need some of this!”—has to be incorporated into planning and logistics if it’s going to be put to use.\n\nThe stream of new equipment coming into Ukraine is just that: a stream. Hopefully, it will never stop. Which means that the perfect time to launch a counteroffensive with the best-equipped, best-trained military is sometime in the future. And it always will be.\n\nFortunately, that’s not Zelenskyy’s target. He’s made it clear that the counteroffensive will proceed when the Ukrainian military has enough equipment and enough training that it can achieve significant objectives without suffering high levels of loss. That may not be today, but it could still easily come within the next few weeks. That the summer months will also come with drier, firmer ground over which all those new Western tanks can roll is just a bonus.\n\nOf course, it wouldn’t be possible to wait if Russia was making daily advances on the front. If, as seemed all too possible a few weeks ago, Bakhmut was in Russia’s rearview mirror and the threat was creeping steadily closer to Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the need for Ukraine to do something to take the pressure off Donetsk oblast would have been extreme—even if that something meant limiting the potential scope and impact of a counteroffensive.\n\nSurprise: That didn’t happen. If there’s anything that best defines the difference between those gloomy assessments for the potential of a counteroffensive from last fall and rising expectations that Ukraine might just sink Russia’s metaphorical battleship (along with its real battleships), it’s simply this: Ukraine’s 56th largest city did not fall into the hands of Russia.\n\nThe town of Bakhmut held little strategic significance. The Battle of Bakhmut may turn out to be of infinite significance. It means that Ukraine doesn’t need to shape its plans around a Russian advance. It can take its time, select its targets, and focus its forces for maximum impact.\n\nStill, just because the counteroffensive could be weeks away, that doesn’t mean Ukrainian forces can’t go on the attack. And reports are that they have. Those reports are, quite literally, from one end of the front to the other—from the roads north of Kupyansk to the swamps south of Kherson, and at many points in between.\n\nKupyansk: Russian sources are reporting that Ukraine has sent reinforcements into this area and there have been reports of increasing shelling from both sides. What’s more interesting is where Russia has been shelling—towns like Lyman Pershyi and Hryanykivka which they previously claimed to control. Earlier this week, Ukrainian forces were reportedly fighting north of Synkivka on the outskirts of Vilshana, as well as pushing through the villages southeast of Dvorichna. Russia even shelled Vilshana on Friday.\n\nI’m not quite ready to report any of these villages as liberated, and Ukraine has yet to confirm this activity. It’s also hard to tell what the scale of these engagements might be. When Russia moved into some of these locations over the fall and winter, they did so because Ukraine had essentially withdrawn from the area, so Russia’s “advance” was more just strolling in to take open positions.\n\nBut now Ukraine appears to be actively pushing Russia back to where the lines stood last summer, and with reports of new Ukrainian forces in the area, that advance could soon carry them into areas that Russia has controlled since the first days of the invasion. [map at the link]\n\nBakhmut: Yes, I skipped my own map here and pulled in one from the Ukrainian Telegraph channel Deep State [map at the link]. I did that for a very special reason. See those patches of blue south of the city? That’s the first blue that Deep State has added to their map in six months.\n\nUkrainian forces have made multiple thrusts over 1 km into formerly Russian-occupied areas south of the city. Honestly, that Deep State map is very conservative, because there are reports from both Ukrainian and Russian forces that Ukraine has pushed back Russian forces north of Khromove and at multiple locations within the city. Several of these moves seem directed at making both the T0504 and “Road of life” routes more passable, and videos of vehicles on the move seem to suggest that Bakhmut has already gone from a location where the only routes in and out were over mud, to a place where Ukrainian forces have options in their lines of communication.\n\nHere’s just one of those actions not included on the Deep State map. [map at the link]\n\nIn the past 24-48 hours (leaning more towards 24), north of Bakhmut, Ukraine has reversed about 2.5 months worth of Russian advances.\n\nVideos on Friday appear to show Ukrainian forces moving confidently through areas of western Bakhmut that were scenes of heavy conflict last week. The most enthusiastic of the on-the-ground sources are already talking about Ukraine launching a move that encircles Russian troops, completely reversing the situation that seemed so ominous a short time ago.\n\nIn the last hour, Russian military officials announced that Russia was pulling back from northern Bakhmut to “more advantageous positions by the Berkhivka Reservoir.” If true, that’s just astounding. That’s literally thousands of Wagner troops who died so Russia could occupy a slice of Bakhmut for just a few weeks before handing it back.\n\n[…] It’s way too early to go to “Ukraine is going to rout Russia at Bakhmut,” or to think the possibility of Russia making further advances there is over. But for the moment, the disorder on the Russian side continues and everywhere Ukraine attacks, they seem to be advancing.\n\nOne final Bakhmut note: There are reports about what’s happening that don’t pin the results on squabbling among the Russians, but exactly what is expected from the counteroffensive—improved Western tactics and better conditions on the ground.\n\nCNN’s Nic Robertson interview 4 Ukrainian commanders who took part in the recent, successful counterattacks on the outskirts of Bakhmut.\n\nThey say that improved weather, combined with the arrival of Western infantry fighting vehicles, is what made it possible for them to advance. [Tweet and video at the link]\n\nAvdiivka: There were multiple reports of a Ukrainian advance on Thursday, but both Ukrainian and Russian sources are now denying any significant change in the area. Ukraine had already driven well east of the city last week, approaching the H20 highway junction and limiting Russian movements in the area. However, for right now, it doesn’t seem there have been any significant changes in the past few days.\n\nNovodonetske: This Russian-occupied town is located west of Vuhledar and east of Velyka Novosilka. Reports suggest that Ukraine may have broken Russian lines in this area and placed control of Novodonetske in doubt. But at the moment I have no confirmation of this action and no good way to determine the scope of changes, so I’m skipping the map for now. Treat it as rumor.\n\nKherson: There are two things underway in this area worth noting. One is that Ukraine seems to have dislodged Russia from most of the islands in the Dnipro southwest of Kherson. These areas may not have been liberated by Ukraine, but they have at least moved from Russian control to disputed … though they’re probably liberated.\n\nThe more interesting activity may be continued reports of Ukrainian landing forces on the eastern bank of the Dnipro. There have been small-scale crossings at several points since shortly after Russia was forced to abandon its positions west of the river. This area has also been a hotbed of partisan activity, with many Russian troops meeting mysterious ends and several facilities blown up without the need for artillery.\n\nBut in the past two days, Russian accounts on Telegraph have been rife with reports that Ukrainian troops were crossing the river in force and setting up camp\n\nRussia certainly seems to believe it, as they are reported to be moving forces from the area northeast of Crimea to meet this supposed threat. [Tweet and video at the link]\n\nHowever, the biggest thing that seems to be underway in the area is Russian Panic. Not only are they reportedly moving more troops to the area, the reports that Ukraine has already crossed—at Kakhovka, or near Tyahynka, or somewhere just northeast of Kherson—keep pouring in. There are calls for Russian forces to mine the riverbank.\n\nThere almost certainly have been several actual, though small, Ukrainian crossings in the last few days, in addition to Ukrainian troops pushing Russia from positions in the river [islands]. Pair that with continued partisan activity and both sides lobbing shells across the river, and a Kherson crossing seems to be high on the list of things that are worrying Russia—or at least, pro-Russian sources.\n\nBut honestly, I can’t tell how much of this is real. Russia seems to be in a panic state everywhere, and rushing to the left bank of the Dnipro may sound a lot more appealing than hurrying to plug the holes at Bakhmut.\n\nWaiting for confirmation.\n\n————————-\n\nLarge explosions were reported in the occupied city of Luhansk. At least one of these seems to be at the Luhansk Machine Building Plant, which was reportedly involved in the repair of military vehicles. These explosions were about 80 to 100 km from the front lines. That puts them in range of a variety of weapons, possibly including HIMARS, but there are some suggestions that this may represent Ukraine trying out those Storm Shadow missiles. [Tweet and image at the link]\n\n—————————\n\nOf course, Prigozhin has something to say about all this. But that very first paragraph, the one that says Wagner controls 95% of Bakhmut and is continuing to push? That’s never been true, and it’s even more of a lie now.\n\nRussian defense in Bakhmut and around the city continues to crumble – Prigozhin’s fits speak for that.\n\nPrigozhin published a letter to Shoigu, calling Shoigu to visit Bakhmut.\n\nThe letter says that on the flanks that were defended by the Russian army, Ukrainian Armed Forces have made a number of successful counterattacks.\n\nWhat do you think – will Shoigu visit Bakhmut by himself or together with Gerasimov? [letter available at the Twitter link embedded at the main link]\n\n[…]\n\nBased on the leaked Pentagon papers and some announcements from Ukraine, bits and pieces of information have emerged about how Ukraine plans to distribute some of its best Western Tanks.\n\n– Ukraine has committed an unknown number of Leopard 2 tanks to both the 1st and 4th Tank Brigades, who have been the most powerful tank units in the Ukrainian army up until today. […] both brigades participated in Leopard 2 training in Poland and Germany.\n\n– The leaked Pentagon papers revealed that Ukraine has assigned 18 Leopard 2A4s and 14 Leopard 2A6s to the newly formed 33rd Mechanized Brigade, although reporters observing the training of the 33rd believed they will be primarily equipped with Soviet BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) and T-72 tanks.\n\n– The veteran 25th and 80th Air Assault Brigades got Challenger 2 tanks.\n\n– The newly formed 47th Assault Brigade got over 100 Bradley IFVs to be paired with M-55S tanks (heavily upgraded 70-year-old T-55 tanks).\n\n– Marder and CV90 IFVs (some of the best IFVs Ukraine received alongside Bradleys) were distributed to unnamed veteran mechanized infantry brigades.\n\nSo let us sort through this.\n\nTHE BEST WESTERN EQUIPMENT\n\nSome of the best tanks and IFVs received by Ukraine may represent some of its most potent offensive firepower, so how Ukraine is choosing to distribute its weapons is interesting to see. Among the weapons I’ve listed above, here are the numbers that are known to have been delivered, or imminent deliveries that are expected per Oryx.\n\nWestern Tanks\n\nLeopard 2 x 74 (further 19 expected to be delivered by early 2024)\n\n2A4 x 40\n\n2A6 x 24\n\nStrv 122 x 10 (Equivalent to 2A5)\n\nChallenger 2 x 14\n\nInfantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)\n\nM2 Bradley x 109\n\nMarder x 40\n\nCV90 x 50\n\nSo this is a fairly small number of “elite” equipment that Ukraine can distribute: roughly 88 modern Western tanks and just under 200 of the best IFVs.\n\nThe reason I set aside Bradleys, Marders, and CV90s as being “special” among IFVs is that these are the IFVs that can utterly dominate the BMP-2, Russia’s primary IFV. The Bradley has the TOW 2, the Marder has the MILAN anti-tank missiles, and their anti-armor ammunition for their main guns is stellar. While the CV90s Ukraine received lack an integrated anti-tank missile system, the 40mm autocannon is exceptionally powerful among IFVs and is even a threat to older Russian tanks.\n\nWe have no information on where some other notable equipment is being assigned:\n\n– 60-120 PT-91 Tanks (60 confirmed deliveries in March/April 2023, conflicted reports of an unknown number of PT-91 (as many as 60) that may have been delivered in Summer 2022)\n\n– 90 Stryker IFVs\n\n– 200 Rosomak IFVs\n\n– 4 BFSTS (artillery coordinating command Bradleys)\n\n– Unknown number of M1131 Strykers (artillery coordination command Strykers).\n\nFurthermore, this is a small fraction of weapons Ukraine has received in the past four months that I am highlighting. Oryx indicates around 300 tanks, 400 IFVs, and 700 APCs (armored personnel carriers) were committed to Ukraine since November 2022, and NATO indicates 98% has already been delivered to Ukraine.\n\nSo Ukraine could do one of two things with this “elite” equipment: It could concentrate them into a pair of extremely powerful brigades, or it could break them up into several smaller units that make multiple brigades more powerful. Based on available information, it appears Ukraine has mostly chosen the latter approach.\n\n1ST/4TH TANK BRIGADES\n\nThe 1st Tank Brigade was armed with highly upgraded T-64 Oblats, and fought effectively both at the Siege of Chernihiv north of Kyiv early in the war, as well as during the Battle of Kherson.\n\nThe 4th Tank Brigade was armed with T-72 tanks, and spearheaded the breakthrough during the Kharkiv counteroffensive, throttling the 1st Tank Army north of Izium and participating in the victory at Lyman. Most people consider these two brigades the best tank units in the Ukrainian army, so when I heard they were receiving Leopard 2 training, I thought Ukraine might split all the Leopard 2s between them. I thought they might also be getting the Challenger 2s. However, we know that almost half the Leopard 2s (32 tanks) went to the newly formed 33rd Mechanized Brigade, so at most, Ukraine committed 42 Leopard 2s between the 1st and 4th Tank Brigades. That’s enough for three companies of 14 tanks each, so most likely, one brigade got two companies of Leopard 2s, the other got one company.\n\nA Ukrainian tank brigade generally has around 85 to 90 tanks in six companies, thus it’s likely that the 1st/4th Tank Brigades will continue to use their T-64s and T-72s mostly, but now supported by one to two elite Leopard 2 Companies (one of them being a super-elite Leopard 2A6 Company of 14 tanks).\n\n33RD MECHANIZED BRIGADE\n\nOther reports state the 33rd Mechanized Brigade was training on T-72 tanks, so it’s likely that the 33rd Mechanized will likely have at least one to two additional companies of T-72s, giving it somewhere around 50-60 tanks at a minimum. This is a very heavy tank contingent for a mechanized infantry brigade, making it somewhat more of a hybrid combined-arms brigade.\n\nIt is also not fully known what type of IFVs or APCs it will receive, but other reports of the 33rd Mechanized in training noted they were primarily training on former Soviet equipment with BMP2s. It doesn’t appear to have gotten Bradleys, CV90s, or Marders, which were noted to have been assigned to “veteran brigades” or other known units.\n\nThey may have gotten some Stryker IFVs whose assignment is unknown, but it seems likely that the 33rd Mechanized is a pairing of Soviet-era mechanized infantry equipment with a powerful contingent of Western Tanks.\n\n25TH/80TH AIR ASSAULT BRIGADES\n\nWhat’s notable about this is that the 14 Challenger tanks aren’t going to be operated as a single company of 14 tanks, but two separate smaller units. I haven’t seen much information on what kind of equipment these two air assault brigades will receive otherwise.\n\nAir assault brigades were traditionally highly mobile elite infantry units that had elements that could be rapidly inserted by helicopter or air drop. It’s unknown how the 70-ton Challenger tanks will be incorporated into the tactical usage of air assault brigades.\n\n47TH ASSAULT BRIGADE\n\nIn another curious pairing, the newly formed 47th Assault Brigade pairs what is likely all of Ukraine’s 109 Bradleys with a very fragile but offensively powerful Slovenian M55S tank. The M55S tanks are highly upgraded T-55 tanks but even with reactive armor added, they are considered quite underprotected. They do have a modern western fire control system that lets them accurately hit targets up to the visual horizon (6,000 meters) but their 105 mm main guns are considered underpowered to take on Russian tanks.\n\nOn the other hand, the M2 Bradleys with their TOW2 missiles can engage and destroy virtually any tank in the Russian arsenal, although it might find itself disadvantaged from a lack of armor against the most modern T-90 tanks—the only tanks the M2 cannot simply outrange.\n\nThus, Ukraine may be banking that the Bradleys can take on any armored threat they are likely to encounter on their own, and do not need western tanks to support them. The M55s can provide heavy fire support on demand from long ranges, and also present an extreme threat to any IFVs or APCs that Russia can field. This unit would need to rely on speed, high ranges, and fire suppression to overwhelm Russian armored formations, and would be extremely dominant against enemy fixed positions defended by infantry.\n\nThere’s a lot we don’t know about how Ukraine plans to distribute its best equipment, but we’re already getting a bit of a picture. Ukraine isn’t concentrating all its best equipment into a handful of brigades, but trying to create as many “strong” brigades that can overwhelm Russian units as possible—for example, pairing Leopards with mostly Soviet IFVs, or pairing Bradley IFVs with some of the weaker Soviet era tanks.\n\nThis presents an interesting mix of units that will have definite mission-based strengths and weaknesses that Ukrainian general staff will have to be aware of as they determine who and where to commit to what type of mission. Intelligence on Russian unit locations will also be paramount. I have confidence Ukraine is up to this task, but they appear to be intent on maximizing the power of their best weapons in the largest number of units.\n\n[…] They’re banning books left and right, losing their shit over women wearing yoga pants, and, of course, freaking the fuck out over drag queens. Last Sunday, all kinds of stars — drag queens and non-drag-queens alike — were hoping to counter some of this absurd hate with the Drag Isn’t Dangerous streaming telethon. The line-up was huge and included many folks we love, like Elliot Page, Leslie Jones, Lance Bass, Darienne Lake, Shangela, Ginger Minj, Marcia Gay Harden, Joey McIntyre, Melissa McCarthy, Peaches, Wilson Cruz, Margaret Cho, Adam Lambert, Charlize Theron and more. Over $500,000 was raised for the Drag Isn’t Dangerous Campaign (and you can still donate!)\n\nNaturally, the Right is going absolutely batshit about this, probably because of how fun it looks and the way it demonstrates that they have no control over the actual culture in this nation. Matt Walsh put out a hysterical newsletter this morning, calling the event a “Groom-a-thon” and claiming that participants “admit” they are “coming for” conservative’s kids.\n\nA few years ago, back when conservatives first started to warn about the leftist plot to sexualize children by exposing them to drag queens, the most common response from the Left was to deny that any such thing is happening. “Drag for children?” They said indignantly. “Don’t be ridiculous. This is a right wing conspiracy theory!” But these things always follow the same script. First they deny the thing, then they admit that the thing is happening but only rarely and it’s not anything we need to worry about, and then, very quickly, they announce that actually the thing is happening, it’s happening a lot, it’s good that it’s happening a lot, and it should happen a lot more.\n\nYeah, it wasn’t a few years ago. This has literally only been going on for a year. […] None of this happened the way he said it did. We all knew about Drag Queen Story Hours and most of us have been going to drag brunches for years now. It’s not a new thing and absolutely no one had a problem with any of it until very, very recently. In fact, I will cynically say that they only started this shit up in the first place was because Roe was overturned, xenophobia felt a tad stale and they needed something new to get hysterical and bigoted over to keep their base interested and put the spark back into their relationship. […]\n\nDuring her segment, the impossibly beautiful Charlize Theron sent a message to drag queens saying “We love you, queens! We’re in your corner, and we’ve got you and I will fuck anybody up who is trying to fuck with anything with you guys”\n\n“In all seriousness,” she continued, “There are so many things that are hurting and, really, killing our kids. We all know what I’m talking about right now, and it ain’t no drag queen. Because if you’ve ever seen a drag queen lip sync for her life, it only makes you happier, it only makes you love more, it makes you a better person.” [video at the link]\n\nIt’s true!\n\nBut over on the dark side, Megyn Kelly went and took personal offense to the woman who played her in Bombshell saying mean things about her and other joy-hating bigots and invited Charlize Theron to come and fuck her up. This seems ill-advised. I mean, have you seen her arms? [video at the link]\n\n“Okay, so why doesn’t Charlize Theron come and f–k me up? Because I’m 100% against her on this,” Kelly said during Friday’s episode of SiriusXM’s “The Megyn Kelly Show.”\n\nThe podcaster said that Theron is someone who “obviously I don’t know, but I feel like I have some weird connection with this person because she played me in a movie.”\n\nKelly also mentioned Theron’s adopted daughter, Jackson, who transitioned from a male to a female. She said Theron erred by not coming out against “grooming of young children.”\n\n“Yes, there are fun drag queen shows. I’ve been to them,” said Kelly, noting that “it was all adults.” “But there are drag queen shows out there right now that are deeply disturbing and they’re happening in front of young children,” Kelly said.\n\n“So know what you’re supporting.”\n\n“Understand what we’re actually seeing out there which can include absolutely the grooming of young children,” Kelly added.\n\n“Even [Theron] should be against that, trans kid, or not.”\n\n“What happens is if you introduce sexual behavior, and like sexual references, just sexualization in front of children too young, it gets them used to it,” Kelly said.\n\nKelly then went on to prove her point by showing a video of a kid at a drag brunch, during a performance in which a queen did a bit where she showed giant fake underwear with a cat on it and danced to a song with the word “]P-word]” in it — like the kid knows what any of that means. The child was there with her parents, who have every right to decide what they are okay with their child seeing. She was not kidnapped and forced to watch the performance against her will.\n\nKids are exposed to sexual references and sexual behavior to this mild degree all of the time, though it does not seem as though conservatives are at all bothered when it comes from straight people — which makes it quite clear that their real issue is that children who are “exposed” to drag queens will grow up to be gay or trans (or worse, straight and cis but not an asshole). This, of course, is not how anything works.\n\nYou don’t see conservatives clamoring to bar parents from taking their kids to see rated R movies, which they are legally allowed to do. You don’t see them huffing and puffing about the kids menu at Hooters. You don’t see them at all worried about having a president who brags about “grabbing women by the ]P-word].” A drag queen can’t dance to a song with the word “]P-word]” in it, but having a president who says it is fine as long as he’s a Republican.\n\nLet’s be very clear, here. What does “grooming” mean? Because we all know what it means. It means that someone is trying to mentally prepare a child to be sexually molested. It means that someone is a pedophile and is looking to sexually assault children. Who is it, specifically, that Megyn Kelly thinks is a pedophile? Can she name some drag queen pedophiles? Have there been any cases of anyone ever coming forward and talking about their experiences being “groomed” for molestation by watching a drag queen lip sync to “Hit Me Baby One More Time?”\n\nAnd doesn’t it seem like we hear a whole lot more about priests and pastors molesting children than we do drag queens?\n\nIt’s not just that she or others think that something is merely “inappropriate for children” — if that were the case, that’s what they would say. People talk about things being “inappropriate for children” all"
