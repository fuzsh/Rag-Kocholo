        "text": "Dagestan's prosecutor's office has been unable to confirm whether female genital mutilation is practiced in some areas of the republic, reported news agency RIA Novosti on Wednesday, citing a letter addressed to Diana Gurtskaya, Russia's Commissioner for Support of Family, Children, and Motherhood.\n\nIn August 2016, Gurtskaya addressed a letter to Russia's Prosecutor General requesting that information on cases of female genital mutilation in Dagestan be investigated. This happened shortly after the Legalnaya initsiativa foundation published a report on the issue in August 2016. The foundation claimed that the practice was widespread in certain parts of the republic. The prosecutor's office, in turn, requested that its Dagestani branch initiate an investigation.\n\nGurtskaya called Wednesday's announcement by the Dagestani prosecutor's office \"a shining example of neglect of entrusted duties.\"\n\nEarlier, after the publication of the Legalnaya initsiativa report, Ismail Berdiyev, the Mufti of the North Caucasus, stated that \"female circumcision\" did not pose a threat to women's health and was little more than \"a custom\" of Dagestan. Later, however, he insisted that he had been joking.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced in some countries in Africa and the Middle East. According to the United Nations, three million women fall victim to the practice annually, many enduring serious physiological and psychological consequences as a result. The United Nations has passed a resolution banning the procedure."
