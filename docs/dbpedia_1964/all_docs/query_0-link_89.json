        "text": "Małgorzata Jamroży aka Margaret has also been tipped for Eurovision and apparently she did turn it down but she'd be perfect. She's got a look and persona you can't unnotice nor forget, she's got hit songs, she has been voted or nominated for everything from Trendy artist to the Hope of the Year, Fashion Icon and Glamour Woman of the year besides the usual best video, song, album, debut..... Oh she's also a fashion designer! She's very clever with social medias and would surely use it to her advantage if selected for Stockholm 2016. Her debut album is titled Add the blonde , do we need to say more? Except it includes mostly Swedish written pop tunes like Tell me how are ya , Wasted , Start a fire and Heartbeat . And of course her debut single and internationally noticed Thank you very much that you can enjoy below with all its anti-textil feel. I think she's Eurovision perfection, she's cheeky and fun, can we have her?\n\nKrista Siegfrids is delivering nice pop tunes one after another and this one is particularly catchy and soon you will be singing along..... Hopefully her Melodifestivalen entry will be equally good!\n\nSirima who, you may ask unless you are Jean-Jacques Goldman fan. Here is her tragic story in a few words: Sirima was born in the United Kingdom of French mother and Sri Lankan father on Valentine's Day 1964. At 18 she moved to France and started singing in the Paris metro stations, usually Gare de Châtelet - Les Halles. A few year's later Philippe Delettrez, who played in Jean-Jacques Goldman's band noted her. He also knew Goldman was looking for a female duet for his song Là-bas . He recorded her voice and took it to Goldman who got interested and went to see her in the metro Barbès. He was impressed and wanted her as her duo partner. The song become a huge success (#2 for five weeks and nearly 600.000 copies sold). Sirima was living at the time with Kahatra Sasorith , an unsuccessful musician. He became jealous for her success and killed her with kitchen knife on December 7, 1989. he was about to release her debut album A part of me. Sasorith did four years of pr\n\nToday's funniest Eurovision related story comes from Belarus. Some sources claim Ivan wants to perform on stage naked and with live wolf or wolves. It surely would be a first on Eurovision stage! We have seen some forgotten underwear over the years, and some cardbox animals though..... Is it time to take things a bit further? No, according the rules live animals are not allowed, and Eurovision being a family show nudity won't do either. (It seems to be ok to be half naked if you are a dancer though..... )\n\nAnna Bergendahl has been having \"a fantastic summer\" as she says on tour and having a lot of time off, too. She has not decided yet what to do this fall. \"I love to study, it's great to learn new things but I also have music in my heart so I hope I can do both in the future. After all I am only 18! Eurovision was a great experience even if I was kicked out in the semifinal like no Swede before and I learned a lot. I would absolutely love to do it again . in 10 or 20 years! \" Her new single and video will be The Army off her debut album.\n\nRegina Lund's new video Jag är osynlig was censored by Youtube only minutes after it had been uploaded. In the video she was playing a female Jesus who gets crusified in the end. \"I was shocked!\" she says. \"There's nothing more naked in it as in every church! It's ok to have naked man hanging on the wall but my nakedness is too much on internet? \". Oh well, no comment. She's prepairing a new album Dare Regina Lund and we of course remember her from her Melodifestivalen 2007 adventure with Rainbow star .\n\nTim Schou has a pretty good solo career going since he left his friends in London. He's travelling the world and relesing songs and videos. The latest one is a great track and comes with a steamy video that kinda takes away from the song really. But who's complaining. If you got it, flaunt it. Enjoy the video below. This post coming after the other Dane, Rasmus Seebach as wishlist for Eurovision. To think about it, Tim would do nicely, too. Maybe he should give it another go?"
