Young Legionnaire, a trio of Dean Pearson, Paul Mullen (yourcodenameis:milo, The Automatic), and Gordon Moakes (Bloc Party), are following up 2011's lauded Crisis Works LP.

"Disappear" is a solid one-two of crashing post-hardcore and acerbic punk embellished with frantic percussion. It's loaded with darkness but still manages to galvanise your senses with a thrilling barrage of noise.

The band say that "Disappear" takes aim at the "the narrow, backward-thinking powers of corporatism, nationalism and fundamentalism."

Explaining the video, Moakes says:

"The â€˜Disappear' video is a mini-documentary of the last two years in the life of Young Legionnaire. Compiled by the band, it mixes footage from our appearance at the ArcTanGent festival in 2015 with scenes from the writing and recording of Zero Worship in various locations between 2014 and now. Interspersed are atmospheric visuals from the industrial setting of Turmwerk studio in Woltersdorf, Germany. The building is an old converted pump station set in the woods of Brandenburg, and we tried to evoke some of the spooky majesty of recording in such austere, wintry surroundings. In relief to the montage of images are snippets of lyrics from the song, which (loosely speaking) are an attempt to refute the crackpot ideologies espoused by Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged."

Zero Worship is out 25 November via Superstar Destroyer.
