Young Legionnaire have been currently touring the UK with Les Savy Fav this month turning heads and generally putting themselves on the map throughout these dates.

The band is made up of Paul Mullen who was the guitarist and singer for The Automatic and also formerly yourcodenameis:milo, bassist Gordon Moakes who has history playing in Bloc Party and drummer Dean Pearson.

Collectively they are creating a tight, melodic, post punk sound with crunching riffs and bring the goodness that bands such as Thursday and Heavy Vegetable have in their locker. Young Legionnaire are preparing the release of their debut album that will be available on May 9th through Wichita. Have a taster of their first single Colossus below that was released on a ltd 500 7â€³ via Holy Roar last year and look out for them on the road.
