        "text": "Live Music, Entertainment & Events\n\nEvent Calendar\n\nSlim Cessna's Auto Club\n\nSlim Cessna's Auto Club is a country music band formed in 1993 in denver, Colorado. The constant in the band has been Slim Cessna, formerly a member of The Denver Gentlemen along with David Eugene Edwards and Jeffery-Paul of 16 Horsepower. Their music includes elements of country blues, southern gospel, and other forms loosely grouped as Americana or alternative country. The Auto Club is sometimes labeled \"country gothic\" due to the juxtaposition of apocalyptic religious imagery with stories of alcohol, violence, and relationships gone awry. Jay Munly (often credited as \"Munly\") is also a key member of the current lineup of the band. In addition to contributing songwriting, vocals, and banjo, he also serves as a sidekick to Cessna on stage. Other current and/or former members (in no particular order) include Rev. Dwight Pentacost, Ordy Garrison, Shane Trost, John Rumley, Frank Hauser, and Danny Pants (aka Daniel Jon Grandbois) Listen at Last.fm\n\nFeatured Events\n\nFeatured Venues\n\nWant More?\n\nLive Music & Entertainment\n\nEat & Drink\n\nArt & Culture"
