        "text": "Berlin-based genre-defying electronic alt rockers LOSERS have recently unveiled their exhilarating single for “Wake Up“, taken from the band’s upcoming EP- EP01 – out on June 28, 2021. To celebrate its release, we sat down with Paul Mullen (formerly of Yourcodenameis:milo and The Automatic), to give you a special rundown of top 10 live performances to check out and get your creative juices flowing. Learn more about LOSERS and their new music and scroll down to see the full list below.\n\nMulti-instrumentalist Tom Bellamy says “Wake Up” is about the realization that to make positive changes and feel true joy that you have to experience pain and hardship and breakthrough the fear of the unknown adding, “’Wake Up’ was one of the first tracks we wrote when we landed in Berlin in 2014. We travelled as light as possible but we brought with us a lot of emotional baggage. Escaping always feels like a good idea, whether that’s geographically or in someone’s company, through something you put into your body, or via your phone, the list goes on, but the pleasure of escape is often fleeting and eventually you end up coming back to yourself. If your unaltered state is not a good place to be, then you find yourself in a vicious circle because naturally you try and escape once more.” It was during that time that he had originally written the song. As time passed, lyrically and emotionally it didn’t make sense to the band anymore, so it was time for a reset. “After the dust had settled, we revisited ‘Wake Up’ and it literally became the wakeup call. It was a crazy journey, but it was incredibly rewarding.”\n\n“Wake Up” comes on the heels of the first single release from EP01, “Lost In Translation,” which Play Too Much lauds as “the dreamiest single in recent memory” and Soundigest calls a “turning point” for the band. The lyrics for “Lost in Translation” came pouring out from Bellamy a few years ago when he was feeling “really isolated, confused and disconnected from the world” around him. The outro of the song was a revelation which happened many months after the initial outpouring. “It was the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s not until we step back and see ourselves as not separate to the world, but in union with it, in love with it, that we can really see beauty. It’s so important to remember to pause and not to dwell on the negative narratives we all tell ourselves.”\n\nThe light at the end of the tunnel that Bellamy refers to was 2018’s Primavera Festival in Barcelona, it was the catalyst he needed to venture into “new territory” with the band’s music. He says, “I saw some really amazing electronic music like Fever Ray, John Hopkins and Floating Points amongst others. Up until that point, personally and creatively, I felt that I was starting to repeat myself. I was walking the same paths and it wasn’t exciting me.” At that time Losers still had a bunch of material left over from their 2016 critically-acclaimed fourth studio album How To Ruin Other People’s Futures and they felt like it needed to be finished but continuing in the same frame of mind didn’t make sense anymore. After enduring the “blow out”, Bellamy says, it was time for them to move on. “The atmosphere was vibrant, and the sights and sounds were bright and fresh. I really connected with it and from that moment on I had the vision I needed to start joining the dots.” As soon as he got back to the studio he started “ripping things apart” and “putting them back together with new purpose”. “It was a frenzy of creativity and it felt really positive.”\n\nThe outcome is the four tracks on EP01. Three of which are massive alt/electronica tracks that feature a rejuvenating perspective (“Wake Up,” “Fool Anyone,” and “Follow You”) and the slow burning dark-wave “Lost In Translation.”\n\n“[Losers] are going to be huge. It’s just a matter of how long it takes for people to find them.” – Gary Numan\n\n“A divine offering to the aural gods.” – DJ Shadow\n\n“Big – Losers have taken it to the next level.” – Zane Lowe\n\n“Powerful, intense Rock Music.” – Clash Magazine\n\n“An awesome slice of musical creativity that deserves to be heard.” – Thinking Lyrically\n\nLOSERS are planning a busy 2021 with a goal of wiping the slate clean, via new and innovative platforms like Decentraland, who they’ve been partnering with to release their new music.

Earlier this year, they released a reworking of Tears for Fears’ 1985 smash “Shout” – which has been prominently featured in the hit show A Discovery of Witches (S2: Ep 4) on Amazon Prime, AMC+, Sundance Now, and Shudder and is not only rejuvenating their loyal fanbase but also winning over new fans who heard their dark cover and fell in love.\n\nEP01 will be released on June 28, 2021.\n\nLosers are: Multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Tom Bellamy (formerly of The Cooper Temple Clause), guitarist/vocalist Paul Mullen (formerly of Yourcodenameis:milo and The Automatic) and DJ Eddy Temple-Morris.\n\nTop 10 Live Performances to make you say WOW, by Paul Mullen, of LOSERS:\n\nThree Trapped Tigers – “Cramm” (BeatCast Studio Sessions)\n\nThree Trapped Tigers? More like Three Free Wow’s!!! Wow. (Wow)\n\nBrutus – “War” (Live at Rain City)\n\nBrutus should be the biggest rock band in the world right now. This is great. Their track ‘Drive’ is even better. Goosebumps. Wow.\n\nAt the Drive-In – “One Armed Scissor” (Later Archive 2000)\n\nI dunno? I thought they could have put a little more energy into this performance. Whatcha think? Wow? Yes, Wow. Say it.\n\nXenia Rubinos – “Hair Rededing” (Live on KEXP)\n\nXenia is spectacular. Her melodic vocal structure on this track is just ridiculous. Juxtapose that with the distorted organ and the almost ’Shellac’ like drums? Check out the 8th comment down on this link from 4 years ago by ‘fabhlc’ for further information.\n\nblack midi – “bmbmbm” (Hyundai Mercury Prize 2019)\n\nArguably one the most original bands to come out of the UK for a long, long time. Possibly the heaviest music to be played at the Mercury Music Awards show. Ticking boxes, making their own rules. Thanks, black midi. You guessed it! Wow.\n\nBjork – “Declare Independence” (Live in Paris, 2008)\n\nShe’s probably been the most important artist for me over the years and I’m sure many hold her in the same high regard. Vá.\n\nDeerhoof – “Fresh Born” (Pitchfork, Juan’s Basement)\n\nDeerhoof has an album’s worth of ideas in 1 song. They have also released 17 studio albums. Let’s do the math! 1 x 11 x 11 x 17 = WOW\n\nDavid Bowie & Nine Inch Nails – “Hallo Spaceboy” (Live, 1995)\n\nOh to have seen this tour! I actually played this version of this song at a tribute night for Bowie in Berlin. I may have changed some of it to Bye Bye Spaceboy. Sad face. But back to this performance…Wow.\n\nRaketkanon – “Suzanne” (Live, Pukkelpop August 2015)\n\nDamn, I miss these guys. Last time I got to see them, vocalist Pieter-Paul jumped straight into my face and nearly broke my nose. Too right I was down the front! Wow & Ow.\n\nTool – “Sober” (Live, Reading Festival 1993)\n\nTool cures jet lag. I’d been on tour in America for 2 months. Flew back to Berlin from the west coast (probably on WOW Air actually, RIP) straight off the flight, straight to the arena, straight to Tool."
