        "text": "Tom Jenkins is well known to us in Trowbridge now. Still farming in the South Wales Valleys, surrounded by the ex-coal mining communities and rugged landscape, Tom cuts an unlikely rock figure. Having previously been signed to Xtra Mile with his rock band Straight Lines (released two albums and toured with Motörhead, The Presidents of the USA and many more) he’s back with his second solo album.\n\nWritten and recorded during lock down Jenkins worked alongside life-long friend and producer Todd Campbell between an old barn on the farm and Todd’s studio in the local area. The album features guest appearances from Phil Campbell (Motorhead), Marc Ford (The Black Crowes) and Paul Mullen (YOURCODENAMEIS:MILO, The Automatic) , Elijah Ford ( Gary Clark Jnr) and a few others that he has shared the road with over the years."
