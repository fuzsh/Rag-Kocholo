        "text": "One evening in Berlin in 1981 Paul turned on his clock radio. It was equipped with a timer that automatically turned off the device: click and silence! That evening was to be different: Radio AFN, founded after the war for American soldiers, was on the air. It often played American music ahead of German radio stations. That evening a new album was introduced by a singer/songwriter Paul had never heard of. It was Bruce Springsteen, his album The River.\n\n\"For the first time I felt how stirring a song can be when the songwriter really connects with the audience, makes it follow him through the song\". That night Paul didn't sleep much.\n\n\"I have always been writing; I just didn't know where the journey would lead me,\" says Paul, who looks back on a career path of over three decades as an actor.\n\nA few years ago, he worked on a story about Joseph Roth's last days in exile in Paris. One of the greatest authors of the 20th Century facing a miserable death away from home, impoverished, lonely, homeless, and drunk. Paul noted down quotations, intending to integrate them into the text. Enchanted by the intensity of the German, he started translating them into English... \"This is a song...\"\n\nThat is how MY ENDLESS SUMMER came about.\n\nMuch followed this. Soon Paul had notebooks filled with his texts and compositions. At that time, he happened to attend a concert by Heather Nova in Berlin. He found that \"the arrangements and performance were strikingly tasteful.\" Heather was accompanied by the Austrian multi-instrumentalist Arnulf Lindner. Paul drafted an e-mail to Arnulf but found out that he lived in London. The greeting was never sent.\n\nWeeks later, Paul was strolling around his Viennese neighborhood when he suddenly saw Arnulf walk towards him. He had just moved to Vienna with his family.\n\nThe two struck up a conversation and got to know each other. Paul played some of his songs for him. Arnulf was impressed by the sensitivity of the lyrics and the musicality of the songs and offered to produce them. This encounter not only led to a fruitful musical collaboration, but also to a friendship that now goes far beyond music.\n\nMovingly, Paul's lyrical talent blends with Arnulf's musical imagination. The result is a distinct sound, inspired by Anglo Saxon and American songwriting.\n\nNow in March 2023 the album A ROAD LIKE THIS is ready to be released!"
