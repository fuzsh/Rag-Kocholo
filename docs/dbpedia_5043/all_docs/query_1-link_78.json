        "text": "For many years it was frustrating to see Jim play superb gigs but he\n\nnever seemed able to get any straight-ahead jazz CDs out. Fortunately\n\nthat seems to have changed in the last 10 years and he now has several\n\ngood jazz CDs available.\n\nApart from being a master of (sometimes outrageous) quotes, Jim does a\n\nneat thing where he plays a famous tune which has nothing to do with\n\njazz and turns it into a good jazz vehicle. I saw him play 'Nessun\n\nDorma' as a jazz ballad once, and he really made it work somehow. He\n\nalso has some good one-liners, such as announcing that due to the age\n\nof the band, they are going to play 'Stairlift to the Stars'. This\n\nkind of thing really wins over the audience.\n\nGraham\n\n\"Graham\" <grah...@hotmail.co.uk> wrote in message\n\nnews:be9821ea-f2ac-44a6...@d27g2000yqf.googlegroups.com...\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeware of old guys in sports coats that they look like they slept in ; they\n\nwill get you every time.

They were trading fours on some uptempo tune near the\n\nend of the set and - Jim being Scottish - Denny throws in the opening\n\nbars of some well known Scottish folk dance tune - everyone cracked\n\nup!\n\n\"Richard\" <riccard...@googlemail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:96fd22a1-b709-4ad3...@l36g2000yqb.googlegroups.com...\n\n> Jim Mullen rocks!\n\nThe whole band does on those clips. I know how good Jim is but never heard\n\nof Mike Gorman before.\n\nicarusi\n\n--\n\nremove the 00 to reply\n\nhttp://icarusi.wordpress.com/\n\nI don't mind Jim's quotes at all - they inject a bit of humour, which\n\nis a highly undervalued commodity in jazz these days, in my opinion!\n\nA lot of classic players like Bird, James Moody, Johnny Griffin etc.\n\nused to do this all the time.\n\nThe great quote-meister has to be Dexter Gordon though. There's a\n\nlive record by Dexter (one of the 'Swiss Nights' LPs) where I'm\n\nconvinced he quotes 'Chicago' on every single tune and somehow it fits\n\nevery time. He must have had a bet on with the rest of the band that\n\nnight!\n\nI'm curious about Terry Smith too - I used to see him play a lot round\n\nSouth London years ago but have not heard of him for many years. I\n\nthink he had some health/drink problems. Wonderful player though.\n\nGraham\n\n\n\n\"van\" <sg...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:dd4dedef-abe3-4010...@i16g2000vbm.googlegroups.com...\n\n\n\nI knew Terry when he first started playing...\n\nwith his back to the audience due to nerves!\n\nHe went through a bad spell including injuring\n\nhis hand but is out and doing it again but I've not\n\nseen him for years.\n\n-C-\n\nThe trouble with socialists is that sooner or\n\nlater they run out of everyone else's money.\n\n\n\nThanks guys, they wrote back to me and explained how the conversion\n\nworks.\n\nIt sounds like a good organization, the money goes directly to the\n\nartists themselves, and the recording companies, or the artists\n\nthemselves provide the recording.\n\nI bought Smith's recording from the 60s \"Fallout\" and loved it.\n\nI've also got the four IF LPs.\n\nMy brother (the world's biggest IF fanatic) pointed out that it was\n\ninteresting how Smith's playing went from being rock-oriented to more\n\njazz-oriented with each IF LP, while back on \"Fallout\" he sounded like\n\nthe hippest British guitar player on the scene.\n\nI guess Dick Morrissey and the boys were telling him how to play on\n\nthe first LP ; ' )\n\nHe still sounded great, no matter what style he played.\n\nI caught him live twice in NY. Unforgettable experience."
