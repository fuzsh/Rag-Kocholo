        "meta_description": "Paul Mullen spent his childhood in Chicago, convincing the neighborhood\nchildren to play games he had designed. By having the other kids over to the house for game tests, he avoided having to go out in the middle of winter and play hockey or in the summer to catch lightning bugs -- or whatever it is that normal children do with other normal children when they&rsquo;re not being properly supervised. At the age of twenty, Mullen decided to take a big step. He went to the local bank and said to the loan officer, &quot;I want to start a band. Can I get a loan for that?&quot; And we all know how that went. After some time as a fundless musician, Mullen decided to become a fundless author, so he wrote a novel (Mome) under the assumed name Paul F. Rhaichen. He then spent some time working in an office and stuff before returning to his true love -- pool and model trains, which are expensive hobbies, especially if you&rsquo;re not that good at pool. Coming full circle, he returned to game design and created Alpha Derby, which eventually became Quills. [from Quills rulebook]",
