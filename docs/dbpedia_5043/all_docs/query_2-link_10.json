        "text": "What are the names of the band u2?\n\nRather unusually given the long period of time U2 has been active, U2 has always has the same line-up. Bono, Edge, Larry and Adam are the original members and remain the only members of U2. Initally, for the first month or so there were other members (Edge's older brother being one of them) however, the band (which wasnt called U2 at the time) was nothing more than a group of kids in a garage at that point and they were long gone by the time U2 launched any material.\n\nWho is the bassist in U2?\n\nAdam Clayton. Born in U.K. but travelled a lot with his family as a child as his father was a pilot. Moved to Dublin when his father got a job with Aer Lingus. Attended same school as other members of U2"
