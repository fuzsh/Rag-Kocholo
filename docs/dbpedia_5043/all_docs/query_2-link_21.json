He was Professor of Forensic Psychiatry, Monash University and Clinical Director, Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health, and previously Professor of Psychological Medicine at the University of Otago (1982 –1992) and Consultant Psychiatrist to the Royal Bethlem and Maudsley Hospitals and Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry, London. He is a principal psychiatric authority on stalking and the co-author of the leading psychiatric textbook on the subject, Stalkers and their Victims, which won the Guttmacher prize in 2001 from the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nHe has published over 190 articles in refereed journals, co-authored four books and contributed over 40 chapters, including chapters in both of the standard British textbooks on forensic psychiatry. His other research interests include the relationship between mental disorder and criminal behaviour, the long term impact of childhood sexual abuse, jealousy, threats and threateners, and litigious and chronic complainers. He is a highly sought-after as a psychiatric expert, and was the first non-military defence expert to achieve entry to the Guantanamo Bay detention centre. From 2003, he has been a member of the Fixated Research Group, which conducts research into the stalking of public figures.\n\nPublications\n\nBooks\n\nMullen, P.E., Pathé, M., Purcell, R.
