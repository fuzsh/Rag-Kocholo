        "text": "Fondly known as the ‘Jazz Geordie’, Paul Moran has become one of the most prolific and sought after musicians of his generation. A multi-instrumentalist fluent on piano, Hammond organ, trumpet and more, he is also a highly respected composer and arranger. For more than a decade he was the Musical Director for iconic singer/songwriter Van Morrison, appearing on several of Van’s albums, including 'Astral Weeks Live at The Hollywood Bowl', as well as working with a vast number of other household names (Tom Jones, Rick Astley, Cilla Black, Chrissie Hynde and many more). Tonight, in addition to Paul on organ and bass pedals, the band consists of the great UK guitarist Jim Mullen (Morrissey-Mullen, Average White Band), ace drummer Mez Clough (Van Morrison, Madness), and special guest, the wonderful jazz & groove singer Jacqui Hicks (Shakatak, Julian Stringle, Thunderthumbs). This outstanding ensemble will feature music from Paul's record “Smokin B3 Volume 2” along with a choice mix of Funk, Soul and straight ahead ’Swingin’ bop Jazz’.\n\n\"..the B3er-horn man still knows how to work a groove....Moran hums on the Leslie amps ...a juke joint that jumps\" Jazz Weekly; \"Moran's accompaniment throughout was just right....and his keyboard playing shined on the....organ\" Downbeat; “Mullen...One of the great Jazz guitarists working today” Jazzwise; \"Jacqui Hicks…one of the most soulful singers in Britain” MU Magazine\n\nPaul Moran Extended Bio"
