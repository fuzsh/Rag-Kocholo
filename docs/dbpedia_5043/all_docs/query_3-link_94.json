        "text": "MONTREAL — Bono and Adam Clayton are sitting on a couch in a downtown hotel last week after a U2 concert, talking T-shirts. Suddenly they're 17 years old again hanging out at punk clubs in their hometown of northern Dublin, circa 1977.\n\n\"The Ramones, the Clash, the Buzzcocks,\" says Clayton, the band's bassist, reminiscing about the bands that he, Bono and the other future members of U2 — guitarist the Edge and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. — witnessed and drew inspiration from as teenagers.\n\n\"The Buzzcocks — the melodies were so great,\" Bono says, mimicking Pete Shelley furiously strumming a guitar. \"What was their drummer's name (John Maher)? Larry used one of his parts on one of our songs.\"\n\n\"I took a few things from (the Stranglers') JJ Burnel — a great bass player,\" Clayton adds.\n\n\"Yeah, we opened for the Stranglers once, and I asked him to wear one of our badges on stage, and he — rightly — told me to (expletive) off,\" Bono says with a grin. \"So we cleaned out their dressing room, took all the beer.\"\n\nPerhaps to even things out, Clayton wore his Stranglers T-shirt on stage earlier in the evening in front of 20,000-plus fans, the final night of the band's sold-out, four-night residency in Montreal. It served as a prelude to U2's five-night Chicago run at the United Center, which began Wednesday.\n\nThe show finds U2 serving as tour guides to their earliest days as a struggling band in Dublin, and even further back to the adventures and tragedies that shaped their young lives. The set list focuses on an album that had a difficult birth and that engendered some of the most divisive reviews in the band's career, \"Songs of Innocence.\"\n\nThe album was released last September as a free auto-download to hundreds of millions of iTunes users. U2 called it a \"gift,\" but some recipients called it spam, and the backlash likely colored perceptions of the album. The bland production, which suggested U2 imitating less ambitious but commercially successful bands who imitate U2, turned the release into an underwhelming prelude for a worldwide tour.\n\nShake things up\n\nBut the tour expands upon and illuminates the songs in a way that reveals there's a lot more to \"Songs of Innocence\" than the conservative production would suggest. The album was in direct response to the more experimental approach taken on the previous U2 studio release, \"No Line on the Horizon\" (2009), with longtime collaborators Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. That album didn't produce the radio hit the band coveted.\n\nSo U2 decided to shake things up in a big way this time and work with current hit-making producers such as Brian \"Danger Mouse\" Burton (who has worked with the Black Keys and Gnarls Barkley), Ryan Tedder (Beyonce, Madonna) and Paul Epworth (Adele). The quartet tinkered off and on for years to get the songs into coherent shape. Finally, it winnowed the many ideas to a single 11-song album, with a follow-up studio album tentatively scheduled for release next year.\n\n\"This time we felt like we wanted to embrace what's going on out there in terms of production,\" the Edge says. \"We wanted to stay current with the culture. We're open to new things. Ryan Tedder has a great talent for recognizing songs, what's a great melody, what's a great hook. As a band we want songs that really land with people, because they don't have time to sit with an album. If an album doesn't connect quickly, there's a good chance it won't be listened to at all.\"\n\nBut the album still didn't resonate in the way the band would've hoped.\n\n\"If I'm honest, there is something about the sound of the record that is a little too organized,\" Bono says in a separate interview. \"That's what happens when you're too long in the studio.\"\n\nBut the band is unified in its belief that the songs are more durable than the last batch, and the tour is a concerted effort to make the case. \"With the last album, we tried reverse engineering, turning experimental pieces into songs, and it didn't work,\" the Edge says. \"This album, we wanted to start with songs we believe in and then get as experimental as we want.\"\n\nStrip away the slickness\n\nIf the studio versions obscure just how intimate and emotional the songs are, the concert interpretations amplify those qualities by stripping away some of the slickness. The autobiographical lyrics inform the first half of the show, with Bono at one point meditating on the death of his mother, Iris, when he was 14, leading fans on a virtual walk through his old neighborhood and into his bedroom on \"Cedarwood Road\" and \"Song for Someone,\" and through the innocence-shattering carnage of \"Raised by Wolves.\"\n\nThe more personal songs that open the show melt into the more outward-looking ones in the concert's second half — the grief and rage of the teenager's coming-of-age turning into adulthood and the recognition that hope exists only as part of a community. Savvy visuals, stage design and unusually crisp sound help turn the 2½-hour journey into something resembling a two-part play. But rather than Broadway bombast, the band presents some of the rawest music it has brought to the stage in decades.\n\nThis from a band that has become a much more complicated beast than the one that first toured America in 1980 and played hundreds of club and small theater shows before graduating to arenas. U2 now partners with Live Nation Entertainment, a multitiered corporation that controls most of the large concert venues and the biggest concert ticketing company in North America, and charges up to $250 for its shows. At the same time, Bono continues to work steadily as a global advocate-activist-lobbyist for the world's poorest countries. During an off-day in Montreal, he traveled to Quebec to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and members of the House of Commons to push for AIDS relief in Africa.\n\n\"The world needs more Canada,\" was his mantra on Parliament Hill in Quebec and on the stage in Montreal.\n\nThe apparent contradictions abound, and one of the more fascinating aspects of the current show is that Bono confronts them directly. In an imaginary conversation between his younger self and the multimillionaire rock star he is now, the young Bono taunts, \"You forgot who you are ... You've got 300 times more than you need.\"\n\nIt's a bracing moment that humanizes a show that is scaled for an arena, yet strives for intimacy.\n\n\"We loved punk, but we took the ideas of punk and expanded them,\" says Clayton, still sporting his Stranglers T-shirt from that night's concert. \"The things Bono talks about and embraces in these songs come from a very real place for all of us in Dublin.\"\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency"
