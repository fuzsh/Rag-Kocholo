His initial influences as a composer came from 20th century classical music (including from film and video games), and were soon followed by jazz and rock from his years as a bass guitarist. He currently teaches elementary general music and choir in Rossville, Indiana, and performs with the Lafayette Citizens Band as a tubaist. He has also performed with the First Coast Wind Symphony and the Southern Winds from Central Florida.\n\nWorks for Winds\n\nSeaside Sleigh Ride (2022)\n\nResources"
