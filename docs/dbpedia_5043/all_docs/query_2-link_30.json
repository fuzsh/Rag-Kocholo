        "text": "Being ENFP-A brings me naturally at building bridges and relationships. These days I am thinking... How do I do this? What is it that I am doing that makes it happen? Those are times I'd like to share what I have learned, and would love to see folks around me be inspired by this, and become even more successful. The fundamental basis of every team shall be trust, or according to the literature i.e. psychological safety. I'll qualify the trust value as the possible of wonders, without it, simply put, your team cannot work together. Trust means, people can speak openly about their fears, their wishes, but most importantly their mistakes. And they do so without fear of being judged or blamed, for the difficult topics they may bring on the table. A trusted leader gets the truth from his team members, so he can address the real problems; and concerns are brought to light before they become critical issues. His team can be innovative because nobody is afraid to come up with silly ideas. So one may ask, how does a leader enable trust in his team. I foresee 4 qualities or behaviors a leader shall have to foster trust. 1 - Being humble - by showing his own vulnerability, by talking about his own mistakes, and what has he learned from it. His team will relate to their own imperfections, and open up themselves. 2 - He must be a skilled professional - his ability to solve problems and being reliable to tackle anything coming his way, will create the level of trust that he can take things on, and deal with them. 3 - He must be kind - have his team members best interests in mind. Treat people with empathy and compassion; In our world it means, you value others point of view as valid as your own. And by being kind, I don't mean being nice; those are 2 separate things. By being nice, you're not helping, you most likely avoid necessary discussions. You can be kind and can still draw lines, give constructive feedback to people. 4 - Being a constant (K) - a rock for his team. A good leader shall walk the talk, and be the same across time and space. There is nothing more destructive to trust than behaving or saying something in one context, and something different in another. Those qualities and behaviors nurture not only trust, but a learning and growth culture; and I found those universally beneficial across cultures, and more. #management #trust #leadership\n\nSweet Insights: The Dangers of Guilt as a Motivational Tool. We‚Äôve all been there, it works but is it ethical as a leader to guilt trip? üìö Book Recommendation: \"The No Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't\" by Robert I. Sutton In this quick read you will quickly learn leadership, guiding a team requires understanding human psychology and ethical practices. Using guilt as a motivational tool is a critical mistake: üí•Erodes Trust: Guilt damages the foundational trust within the team. üí•Decreases Morale: It leads to resentment and frustration, lowering productivity. üí•Promotes Fear-Based Culture: Guilt fosters fear, stifling innovation and collaboration. üí•Temporary Compliance: It might yield short-term results but harms long-term commitment and loyalty. Effective Leadership Practices: ü§åEmpathy and Support: Understand and support your team‚Äôs challenges. üôåRecognition and Praise: Celebrate achievements to boost morale. ü§∑Clear Expectations and Feedback: Set clear goals and provide constructive feedback. üôã‚ôÇÔ∏èLead by Example: Inspire by demonstrating the behavior you expect. Firsthand Experiences: ü§ùBuilding Trust: In my early years as a manager, I learned that transparency and honesty are crucial. When I shifted from using guilt to fostering open communication, the trust within my team grew significantly. üìàBoosting Morale: I once led a project where initial setbacks caused frustration. Instead of assigning blame, I focused on recognizing small victories and providing support. This approach not only lifted spirits but also led to innovative solutions. üó£Ô∏èEncouraging Collaboration: By avoiding guilt and encouraging a culture of empathy and support, I saw a remarkable increase in team collaboration and creativity. Team members felt safe to share ideas and take risks. True leadership is about inspiring and uplifting your team, fostering an environment where everyone can thrive. #Leadership #TeamBuilding #PositiveLeadership #EmployeeEngagement #BookRecommendation #RobertSutton\n\nMore than once, my directive at the start of a new role (corporate or consulting) could be distilled down to, \"Fix the lack of trust employees have for management.\" The top-level way to do so is quite straightforward: Address and solve your team's concerns, act upon their expertise, and speak unvarnished truths. That's it. Answering concerns proves you appreciate the team's investment in the company, and will support them *at least* as much as you expect them to support the company and the management whose higher incomes depend upon the commitment of your team. Acting upon the team's shared expertise-- to solve problems, elevate a process or product, open a new consumer base, etc.--proves you respect the team's knowledge, skills, and experience. Speaking unvarnished truths proves you trust your team to evaluate and understand their role in the company's greater community, and the shared impact of success and failure. Straightforward indeed... But there is a catch. You must do all three. At the same time. Consistently. Without giving off the vibe of someone who sees trust-building as a bothersome exercise. There is no faking this part. How uncomfortable that makes you usually corresponds to how little you've conditioned your team to trust you. The good news is that many managers are fully capable, prepared, and equipped to build strong and trustful relationships with their teams! Yes, there have been a few who saw no reason to practice mutual trust, and they undermined progress to maintain a status-quo that let them feel powerful, that centered *them.* But most managers want what their team wants: a positive work environment, a shared purpose, an opportunity to contribute. I've rarely found an ethical manager who needed more than the opening direction, coupled with follow-up coaching and incident-specific analysis, to make dramatic improvements in the trust, performance, and positive collaboration of their team. As always, you want to know the spirit--the ethics, the vision, the dedication, the respect for others--that you bring to the table. Trust me--your team already knows. NEXT POST: The Weakness Exposed by Resorting to Leverage #leadership #leadershipdevelopment #managementdevelopment #spiritsbusiness #teambuilding #managertips\n\nFollowing on from my post last Friday on LEADER OF THE FUTURE, as promised...the first installment of my experience on this transformative journey: It‚Äôs Day 1 of LEADER OF THE FUTURE introducing the 3 coaches Sarah Ratcliffe, Joe Maia and Beatriz Ajenjo, along with Diogo Cardosa who provided the technical brilliance and outstanding playlist of songs making each day flow smoothly with the right energy for the different activities. üé∂ Armed with a DiSC self -assessment, a 360 evaluation of me by colleagues and an individual development plan, these followed me through the entire week: What kind of leader do I want to be? How do I get there? I needed courage to share my timelines: Important personal and professional events but it brought deep understanding for and about each of my team members and myself. I understand now why verbal communication has been a big challenge for me over the years. But imagine the impact of this when having a ‚Äòdifficult career conversation‚Äô with my line manager as a 22-year-old Newly Qualified Teacher not having the courage to do more than just nod compliantly. Or as a line manager myself, having to address the performance of a colleague in a way that is directive and supportive as well as deal with their defensive reaction. On Day 1 we explored neurological levels and the impact that Environment, Behaviour, Capabilities, Values and Beliefs and Identity have on these and our ability to move from remedial change to evolutionary change. We looked at the importance of managing your Physical, Mental, Emotional and Spiritual energies and how you do this for yourself on a day-to-day level, based on our full engagement evaluations. I was wanting in many areas that were impacting upon my professional and personal relationships and myself. The course content on this was excellent and something I can take away with me and use when I need to. üí™ Our first task as a team was to elect a team leader, create a team name, logo and slogan and the purpose, vision and values of the team. At this point, I want to declare from the rooftops that I think I was in the best team: Benoit Poutot, Elie B. Boulin, Jana Frankovicova, Edgar Ochoa and Anna Ashington‚Äì more on that later! And all of this by lunchtime! ‚ÄúHow are you still working until 10pm?‚Äù I hear you ask. The tasks are real work situations that need to be discussed, resolved and presented, all the while getting to know each team member and understanding how to navigate different leadership styles. Were we competitive that evening? Hell yes! We wanted to win all the points going, but we hadn‚Äôt taken on board the competition and at 8.30pm on the first evening we called it a night, believing we had produced our best work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ üôà Have you ever pressed submit or stood up to give a presentation and wanted the ground to open up and swallow you because you knew this was not your best work as it was not your best effort? Tune in tomorrow to hear about Day 2 and falling flat on your face! üòÅ\n\nMore and more of my coaching clients are coming to me with concerns about their team and looking for ways to interact with them more effectively. They are tired of punishing the team or asserting their authority with the title \"boss\" on their business card. Today's post is about that. Effective Communication: Master the art of uniting and motivating your team. In a cohesive team, members: *respect each other's opinions and contributions *develop their talents *share and listen to each other's ideas Such a team is ready for challenges and capable of achieving the most global goals. Creating and maintaining it is one of the most important tasks of a leader. I have been inspired by the experience of large companies in motivating and uniting teams. I'm sharing methods that resonated the most. Explain the 'why'. For the team to be motivated and not just follow a template, each member needs to understand why they should strive for common excellence. This is where the leader's art comes into play: breaking down even the most distant and grand goal into understandable pieces. Harmony between corporate and personal goals. The team is inspired by what they see as their professional success. The team leader not only paves the way to the goal, but also shows each member how they can contribute and grow professionally. Unique niche. It is important to direct each member to where they will be most productive. Seeing one's own successes motivates effectively and effortlessly. Again, the leader's talent is to see each player and skilfully distribute the forces. Trust and psychological safety. Based on Google's research of teams. Calmness and the ability to share opinions openly contributed to increased efficiency. The ever-evolving IT company Menlo Innovations also focuses on the free expression of its employees. \"Fear kills joy,\" they believe. Togetherness. Group chats, company training sessions, informal meetings. This helps people to see each other as a whole: not just as professionals, but as people with common values. Strategic sessions. Positioning, plans, sub-goals, analysis of methods, and results. Such intermediate vectors inspire and motivate leaders and the entire team as a whole. What would you add to this list?

It's okay to make mistakes ‚Äì that's how we learn! üí™üë©üíºüë®üíº\n\nPrivilege is a topic that has been on my mind for quite some time. Most people at work would think about Privilege as this thing people have which comes with their work titles. CEO, Business Partner, Head of..., Director, etc.. But privilege comes in many other forms. Sometimes, the person with the 'privileged' title isn't the person who runs the show. (we all know the administrator who will put you 'on hold' on the phone, just because...). Privilege can be gained, but it is also something we are born with: white privilege, educational privilege, financial wealth, being born as a male etc. So, what does privilege have anything to do with organisational systemic work? Well, for people who are in a work role that comes with power and are unaware of the impact this can have on their team - this can create unhealthy power dynamics which get acted out in team behaviour: Resistance to doing things in a certain way, sabotaging new ideas coming from management, people withdrawing from work (which can show up in different ways), and much more. As the person who is on top, but doesn't feel like you're running the show in a way that fosters healthy culture in your team; developing awareness of how your position impacts your team can do wonders for your leadership. It can completely transform team performance, output and meeting targets. There is a reason why Leadership Coaching is a big industry. But even more importantly, this work has to be taken back to the wider team for meaningful sustainable change. No more broken communication and high conflict for no apparent reason. Collective team self-awareness equals high-performing teams. It's a fact. üëâ So as a leader, where do you start to develop your own self-awareness around your privilege? üëç So that your team members can develop their own to discover how intentionally or not they 'act out' in a way which drags your organisation down? #leaership #communication #conflict #performance #teamcoaching #relationships #selfawareness #teamperformance\n\nWe all want to see the #teams we work with, and each of our teammates, progress and develop. However, as managers, sometimes we're unsure about how to #communicate with our employees or team members and how to motivate them. I'd like to share a few humble suggestions in this area. Firstly, respect is something we all desire, including yourself. One way to show respect to your team members is by listening to their ideas. Doing so can satisfy one of our deepest desires to be heard and seen. Life presents challenges to us all, not just as employees or colleagues but as human beings. It's essential to see the person we're working with, and understand their current worries and #challenges, both work-related and personal, because ultimately, we all want to be supported by each other. And at the base of this is our need for security: Do I belong in this #organization, with this colleague, under this #management? Providing support, listening, and contributing to personal and #professional development by recognizing opportunities can strengthen our relationships with those we work with, making it easier to identify what motivates them and what motivates us in return. Sharing ourselves and showing empathy by putting ourselves in their shoes can take our relationships, as a manager or a team member, to the next level. A key theme I've encountered is #justice and #equality. Therefore, maintaining an equal level of closeness with other team members and keeping a balanced distance from everyone is crucial. This approach can heighten a sense of justice and fairness among your employees and yourself. Feedback is one of the most important values. Often, #feedback is seen as a one-way communication from managers to their team members. However, as a manager, hearing the feedback you desire and asking for it, taking those suggestions, and continuing to develop as a leader is vital for setting an example. And I ask you, as the #leader of your life, what areas do you need to progress in? What motivates you, and what kind of feedback and support from your team would make you a better manager and leader? I invite you to write these down below, so we can collectively learn from each other. #TheIntegralInstitute #SamiBugay\n\nThe Lampard, Terry, Drogba Effect: Why Seniority Isn't Just About Titles Let's be honest, sometimes management feels a bit like the board in a football match ‚Äì barking orders from the sidelines, hoping for the best. But just like a game isn't won by the coach alone, a successful team thrives on leadership from all levels. Think about Chelsea's glory days. Sure, Mourinho was a tactical genius, but it was the likes of Lampard, Terry, and Drogba who truly owned the dressing room. They mentored the younger players, set the tone for work ethic, and ensured everyone was on the same page, both on and off the pitch. This, my friends, is the magic of tiered mentoring. It's not about dumping all the responsibility on management's shoulders. It's about senior team members recognizing their role in shaping the next generation. Now, I'm not advocating for some kind of Lord of the Flies situation here. But picture this: a young, eager team member struggling with a project. Instead of waiting for a formal meeting with the manager, they can bounce ideas off a senior colleague, someone who's been in the trenches and can offer real-world advice. It's a win-win ‚Äì the junior gets valuable guidance, and the senior hones their leadership skills. Here's the other cool thing ‚Äì tiered mentoring distributes the load. Imagine a manager bombarded with questions from every team member. By having senior folks step up as mentors, it frees up the manager's time for strategic planning and big-picture stuff. Plus, let's not forget the team spirit it builds. Sharing knowledge, collaborating on solutions ‚Äì it fosters a sense of shared responsibility and a common goal. Everyone feels valued, everyone feels like they're contributing to the team's success. So, the next time you see a junior member struggling, don't wait for the coach to blow the whistle. Step up, offer your experience, and be the Lampard, Terry, or Drogba your team needs. #LeadershipDevelopment #Mentorship #Teamwork #football #management #corporateleadership #advertising #agency #manager\n\nThey say you should \"trust the process\" but if you don't trust your people, you have no process.
