        "text": "Paul Mullin has told Wrexham fans to stop a chant aimed at their own team.\n\nWrexham, owned by Hollywood duo Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, are striving for their second successive promotion this season. They moved one step closer to League One promotion with a comeback 2-1 win away at Colchester United on Saturday, something which has proven difficult for Phil Parkinson’s side this season.\n\nThe Red Dragons have won just seven times away from home in 21 matches, prompting Wrexham fans to chant about ‘never winning away from home’ at games. That was the case again at JobServe Community Stadium.\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea's stunning comeback saves Astrid Wett from embarrassing self-inflicted punishment\n\nREAD MORE: Astrid Wett slammed for 'public indecency' after going braless at England match\n\nBut what was meant as banter has had an adverse effect on player morale, according to the club’s legendary goal-scorer Mullin. The striker, who sparked the comeback by nodding in his 100th goal for Wrexham, urged fans to stop the chants in his post-match interview.\n\nMullin said: “They travel everywhere supporting us and the support they give us is brilliant. But one thing I never want to hear them singing again is about us not winning away from home and 'how **** must you be, you never win away'.\n\n“What do they think that does to the players who are on the pitch representing their team? I don’t know. I know it’s all about fun and games and having a good time but some of the lads were speaking about not liking to hear that.”\n\nWrexham conceded in the 54th minute to go a goal down. Mullin’s equaliser came six minutes later, before Max Cleworth grabbed the winner in the 85th minute.\n\nCommenting on his landmark goal, Mullin said: “A goal is a goal, it doesn’t matter what number it is. I only realised which number it was when I got back to the halfway line because I tried to put it out of my mind.\n\n“Obviously it’s an unbelievable achievement but I never stop, I keep wanting more and more so that’s what I’ll continue to try and do.”"
