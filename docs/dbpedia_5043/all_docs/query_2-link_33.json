        "text": "Of course, school is primarily a place to learn. Often, however, it’s also a place where contacts are made, and sometimes for life. It remains the ideal meeting place to get to know people with the same interests, and for up-and-coming musicians, there’s virtually no better place. Here are some of the most successful bands that started together in high school.\n\n1. U2 started on a bulletin board\n\nA certain Larry Mullen Jr. posted a notice on the bulletin board at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976, asking if anyone was interested in starting a band. Six students responded, and the group ultimately consisted of Paul Hewson (Bono), David Evans (The Edge), Adam Clayton, Edge’s older brother Dik Evans, and Mullen Jr. himself. A multiple-Grammy-winning career ensued.\n\n2. The Rolling Stones have known each other since elementary school\n\nMick Jagger and Keith Richards met at primary school, Dartford Maypole Country Primary School. When they met again ten years later, the two discovered that they had a mutual friend at Sidcup Art School in Dick Taylor. When Brian Jones met the group, the foundation for the “Rolling Stones” was literally laid. The rest is a story that couldn’t be more iconic. The stones are still rolling in the 60th year since it was founded.\n\n3. Red Hot Chilli Peppers\n\nAnother iconic band formed during high school is the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. The original name was probably a bit long: Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. It was quite natural to shorten the name and make it nice and catchy. Since the early days in high school, there have been regular cast changes. Irrespective of this, they already have a simply incredible career behind them with their signature sound. Since their inception, they have won 6 Grammys and sold more than 80 million records worldwide.\n\n4. Green Day formed as a school band\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt met in middle school in California. The two hit it off right away and shortly thereafter formed their first band, then called Sweet Children. They played their first show when they were 14 years old. Renamed Green Day, they made their breakthrough in 1994 together with drummer Tré Cool with “Dookie”, their third studio album and the first major label production. With this release they were heralded as the punk revival band. “Dookie” has sold more than 10 million copies in the US alone.\n\n5. School band The Quarrymen became The Beatles\n\nThe Beatles are also among the bands who met at school. Founded in 1956 by John Lennon, they first performed as The Quarrymen at parties, school balls, skiffle competitions and in cinemas. In Liverpool, in the 1950s and early 1960s, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Star, also with the occasional bassist Stewart Sutcliff, formed the legendary Beatles. After their time in Hamburg’s Starclub, they swept through music history like no other band. The former school band was incredibly hyped by their fans. Real icons that have left unforgettable footprints.\n\n6. Boyz II Men – R&B established in the mainstream\n\nOriginally known as Unique Attraction, R&B band Boyz II Men formed in 1988 at Philiadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. All of the musicians were members of the school choir. And then it really took off. In 1992 they released their single “End of the Road” and it reached the top of the charts worldwide. In fact, the song broke the record previously held by Elvis Presley: “End of the Road” stayed on the Billboard Hot 100 for a whopping 13 weeks. They’re credited with the ubiquity of R&B music on mainstream radio in the early 2000s.\n\n7. Radiohead – Grammys instead of grades\n\nThe members of alternate stars Radiohead all went to the same school, the All-Boys Abingdon School, although in different classes. Guitarist and vocalist Thom Yorke, bassist Colin Greenwood, guitarist Ed O’Brien, and drummer Phil Selway and Jonny Greenwood originally started out as On a Friday. They went their separate ways because they went to different colleges. However, they continued to make music together. When they were asked by the label EMI to change their band name, they chose Radiohead. In 2009 they received their third Grammy, the list of awards is almost endless.\n\n8. Pink Floyd – the psychedelic giants\n\nThree of Pink Floyd’s founding members studied architecture at London’s Regent Street Polytechnic School of Architecture: Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright. This may also explain the extraordinary light, laser and video shows by the psychedelic cult band. Syd Barrett was also a student, but at a different university, when he met the three. It was to be an unstoppable success story, but not without tragic events such as Syd Barrett’s mental health problems, which forced the former guitarist, singer and songwriter to leave the band. With more than 300 million records sold, Pink Floyd is one of the most successful bands ever. And it all started at school. “Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone.”\n\n9. The Cure – Mainstream hits with alternative music\n\nThis legendary band was founded in 1976 by singer and guitarist Robert Smith, together with some other schoolmates at St. Wilfrids Comprehensive School. There were initially various line-up changes and name changes until the band finally called themselves The Cure in 1978. When one of their demo tapes ended up in the hands of a Polydor Records A&R manager, they were immediately signed. They quickly became one of the first alternative bands to achieve mainstream success. They have since been inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame, and it all started at – you guessed it – school.\n\n10. The Who – started out in their teens\n\nPete Townsend and John Entwistle knew each other from Acton County Grammar School. Roger Daltrey also attended the same school. He formed his own band called Detours, the forerunner of The Who. They knew each other from the school grounds and so Townsend joined the formation as a guitarist, Entwistle as a brilliant bassist and finally Keith Moon as drummer. The pioneers of hard rock became world famous with songs like “My Generation” and “Pinball Wizard” and were also notorious for their excesses. Pete Townsend himself says that he “(…) miraculously survived.”\n\nFind your next instrument !"
