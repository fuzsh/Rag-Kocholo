        "text": "U2 - Exerpts from Wikipedia\n\nFormation and early years 1976 to 1979\n\nThe band formed in Dublin on 25 September 1976. Larry Mullen, Jr., then a 14 year-old student at Mount Temple Comprehensive School, posted a note on the school's notice board in search of musicians for a new band six people responded. Setting up in his kitchen, Mullen was on drums, with Paul Hewson (Bono) on lead vocals; David Evans (The Edge) and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar; Adam Clayton, a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar; and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen. Mullen later described it as \"'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge.\" Soon after, the group settled on the name \"Feedback\" because it was one of the few technical terms they knew. Martin did not return after the first practice, and McCormick left the group within a few weeks. Most of the group's initial material consisted of cover songs, which the band admitted was not their forte. Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts, such as The Jam, The Clash, The Buzzcocks, and The Sex Pistols. The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to being successful.\n\nIn March 1977, the band changed their name to The Hype. Dik Evans, who was older and by this time at college, was becoming the odd man out. The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble and he was \"phased out\" in March 1978. During a farewell concert in the Presbyterian Church Hall in Howth, which featured The Hype playing covers, Dik ceremonially walked offstage. The remaining four band members completed the concert playing original material as \"U2\". Steve Averill, a punk rock musician (with The Radiators) and family friend of Clayton's, had suggested six potential names from which the band chose \"U2\" for its ambiguity and open-ended interpretations, and because it was the name that they disliked the least.\n\nOn Saint Patrick's Day in 1978, U2 won a talent show in Limerick, Ireland. The prize consisted of 500 British Pounds and studio time to record a demo which would be heard by CBS Ireland, a record label. This win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band. U2 recorded their first demo tape at Keystone Studios in Dublin in May 1978. Hot Press magazine was influential in shaping the band's future; in May, Paul McGuinness, who had earlier been introduced to the band by the publication's journalist Bill Graham, agreed to be U2's manager. The group's first release, an Ireland-only EP entitled Three, was released in September 1979 and was their first Irish chart success. In December 1979, U2 performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland, although they were unable to gain much attention from audiences or critics. In February 1980, their second single \"Another Day\" was released on the CBS label, but again only for the Irish market.\n\nBoy, October, and War 1980 to 1983\n\nIsland Records signed U2 in March 1980, and in May the band released \"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\" as their first international single. The band's debut album, Boy, followed in October. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, it received generally positive reviews. Although Bono's unfocused lyrics seemed improvised, they expressed a common theme: the dreams and frustrations of adolescence. The album included the band's first United States hit single, \"I Will Follow\". Boy's release was followed by the Boy Tour, U2's first tour of continental Europe and the United States. Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated U2's potential, as critics noted that Bono was a \"charismatic\" and \"passionate\" showman.\n\nThe band's second album, October, was released in 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes. During the album's recording sessions, Bono and The Edge considered quitting the band due to perceived spiritual conflicts. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group in Dublin called the \"Shalom Fellowship\", which led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the rock and roll lifestyle. Bono and The Edge took time off between tours and decided to leave Shalom in favour of continuing with the band. Recording was further complicated with the theft of a briefcase containing lyrics for several working songs from backstage during the band's performance at a nightclub in Portland, Oregon. The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. Low sales outside the UK put pressure on their contract with Island and focused the band on improvement.\n\nResolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in 1983. A record where the band \"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\", War's sincerity and \"rugged\" guitar was intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. The album included the politically charged \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of Bloody Sunday with Easter Sunday. Rolling Stone magazine wrote that the song showed the band was capable of deep and meaningful songwriting. War was U2's first album to feature the photography of Anton Corbijn, who remains U2's principal photographer and has had a major influence on their vision and public image. U2's first commercial success, War debuted at number one in the UK, and its first single, \"New Year's Day\", was the band's first hit outside Ireland or the UK.\n\nOn the subsequent War Tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in mainland Europe and the US. The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" became the tour's iconic image. U2 recorded the Under a Blood Red Sky live album on this tour, as well as the Live at Red Rocks concert film, both of which received extensive play on the radio and MTV, expanding the band's audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act. Their record deal with Island Records was coming to an end, and in 1984 the band signed a more lucrative extension. They negotiated the return of their copyrights (so that they owned the rights to their own songs), an increase in their royalty rate, and a general improvement in terms, at the expense of a larger initial payment.\n\nThe Unforgettable Fire and Live Aid 1984 to 1985\n\nThe band feared that following the overt rock of the War album and tour, they were in danger of becoming another \"shrill\", \"sloganeering arena-rock band\". Thus, they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, The Unforgettable Fire; as Adam Clayton recalls, \"We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty.\" The Edge admired the ambient and \"weird works\" of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record.\n\nPartly recorded in Slane Castle, The Unforgettable Fire was released in 1984 and was at the time the band's most marked change in direction. It was ambient and abstract, and featured a rich, orchestrated sound. Under Lanois' direction, Mullen's drumming became looser, funkier, and more subtle and Clayton's bass became more subliminal; the rhythm section no longer intruded, but flowed in support of the songs. Complementing the album's atmospheric sound, the lyrics are open to interpretation, providing what the band called a \"very visual feel\". Due to a tight recording schedule, however, Bono felt songs like \"Bad\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" were incomplete \"sketches\". The album's lead single \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\", written about Martin Luther King, Jr., was the band's biggest hit to that point and was their first song to chart in the US top 40.\n\nMuch of The Unforgettable Fire Tour moved into indoor arenas as U2 began to win their long battle to build their audience. The complex textures of the new studio-recorded tracks, such as \"The Unforgettable Fire\" and \"Bad\", were problematic to translate to live performances. One solution was programmed sequencers, which the band had previously been reluctant to use, but are now used in the majority of the band's performances. Songs on the album had been criticised as being \"unfinished\", \"fuzzy\", and \"unfocused\", but were better received by critics when played on stage.\n\nU2 participated in the Live Aid concert for Ethiopian famine relief at Wembley Stadium in July 1985. U2's performance in front of 82,000 fans was a pivotal point in the band's career. During a 14-minute performance of the song \"Bad\", Bono leapt down off the stage to embrace and dance with a fan, showing a television audience of millions the personal connection that Bono could make with audiences. In 1985, Rolling Stone magazine called U2 the \"Band of the '80s\", saying that \"for a growing number of rock-and-roll fans, U2 have become the band that matters most, maybe even the only band that matters\".\n\nThe Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum 1986 to 1989\n\nFor their fifth album, The Joshua Tree, the band wanted to build on The Unforgettable Fire's textures, but instead of out-of-focus experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures. Realising that \"U2 had no tradition\" and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited, the group delved into American and Irish roots music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards motivated the band to explore blues, folk, and gospel music and focused Bono on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. U2 interrupted the album sessions in mid-1986 to serve as a headline act on Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour. Rather than being a distraction, the tour added extra intensity and focus to their new material. Later that year, Bono travelled to San Salvador and Nicaragua and saw first-hand the distress of peasants bullied in internal conflicts that were subject to American political intervention. The experience became a central influence on the new music.\n\nThe Joshua Tree was released in March 1987. The album juxtaposes antipathy towards America against the group's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and ideals. The band wanted music with a sense of location and a \"cinematic\" quality, and the record's music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading. The Joshua Tree became the fastest-selling album in British chart history, and topped the Billboard 200 in the United States for nine consecutive weeks. The first two singles, \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", quickly became the group's first number-one hits in the US. They became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine, which declared that U2 was \"Rock's Hottest Ticket\".The album won U2 their first two Grammy Awards, and it brought the band a new level of success. Many publications, including Rolling Stone, have cited it as one of rock's greatest. The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums, alongside smaller arena shows.\n\nThe documentary Rattle and Hum featured footage recorded from The Joshua Tree Tour, and the accompanying double album of the same name included nine studio tracks and six live U2 performances. Released in October 1988, the album and film were intended as a tribute to American music; they included recordings at Sun Studios in Memphis and performances with Bob Dylan and B. B. King. Rattle and Hum performed modestly at the box office and received mixed reviews from both film and music critics; one Rolling Stone editor spoke of the album's \"excitement\", another described it as \"bombastic and misguided\". The film's director, Phil Joanou, described it as \"an overly pretentious look at U2\". Most of the album's new material was played on 1989's Lovetown Tour, which only visited Australia, Japan and Europe, so as to avoid the critical backlash the group faced in the US. In addition, they had grown dissatisfied with their live performances; Mullen recalled that \"We were the biggest, but we weren't the best\". With a sense of musical stagnation, Bono said to fans on one of the last dates of the tour that it was \"the end of something for U2\" and that they had to \"go away and... just dream it all up again\".\n\nAchtung Baby, Zoo TV, and Zooropa 1990 to 1993\n\nStung by the criticism of Rattle and Hum, the band sought to transform themselves musically. Seeking inspiration on the eve of German reunification, they began work on their seventh studio album, Achtung Baby, at Hansa Studios in Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. While Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, Bono and The Edge were inspired by European industrial music and electronic dance music and advocated a change. Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up until they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song \"One\". They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed.\n\nAchtung Baby was released in November 1991. The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for the group; the shift was one of their most dramatic since The Unforgettable Fire. Sonically, the record incorporated influences from alternative rock, dance, and industrial music of the time, and the band referred to its musical departure as \"four men chopping down the Joshua Tree\". Thematically, it was a more introspective and personal record; it was darker, yet at times more flippant than the band's previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band's most successful albums. It produced five hit singles, including \"The Fly\", \"Mysterious Ways\", and \"One\", and it was a crucial part of the band's early 1990s reinvention. Like The Joshua Tree, many publications have cited the record as one of rock's greatest.\n\nLike Achtung Baby, the 1992 1993 Zoo TV Tour was an unequivocal break with the band's past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping by attempting to instill \"sensory overload\" in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases. Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, the group's Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating; on stage, Bono performed as several over-the-top characters, including \"The Fly\", \"Mirror Ball Man\", and \"MacPhisto\". Prank phone calls were made to President Bush, the United Nations, and others. Live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo caused controversy.\n\nQuickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV Tour in mid-1993, the Zooropa album expanded on many of the themes from Achtung Baby and the Zoo TV Tour. Initially intended as an EP, Zooropa ultimately evolved into full-length LP album. It was an even greater departure from the style of their earlier recordings, incorporating further dance influences and other electronic effects. Johnny Cash sang the lead vocals on \"The Wanderer\". Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 legs of the tour, which visited Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan; half the album's tracks became permanent fixtures in the setlist. Although the commercially successful \"Zooropa\" won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1994, the band regard it with mixed feelings, as they felt it was more of \"an interlude\".\n\nPassengers, Pop, and PopMart 1994 to 1999\n\nIn 1995, U2 released an experimental album called Original Soundtracks 1. Brian Eno, producer of four previous U2 albums, contributed as a full partner, including writing and performing. For this reason and due to the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker \"Passengers\" to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. Mullen said of the album, \"There's a thin line between interesting music and self-indulgence. We crossed it on the Passengers record.\" It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally poor reviews. However, the single \"Miss Sarajevo\" featuring Luciano Pavarotti, which Bono cites as one of his favourite U2 songs, was successful.\n\nOn 1997's Pop, U2 continued experimenting; tape loops, programming, rhythm sequencing, and sampling provided much of the album with heavy, funky dance rhythms. Released in March, the album debuted at number one in 35 countries and drew mainly positive reviews. Rolling Stone, for example, stated that U2 had \"defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives\". Others felt that the album was a major disappointment and sales were poor compared to previous U2 releases.[94] The band was hurried into completing the album in time for the impending pre-booked tour, and Bono admitted that the album \"didn't communicate the way it was intended to\".\n\nThe subsequent tour, PopMart, commenced in April 1997. Like Zoo TV, it poked fun at pop culture and was intended to send a sarcastic message to those accusing U2 of commercialism. The stage included a 100-foot (30 m) tall golden yellow arch (reminiscent of the McDonald's logo), a 150-foot (46 m) long video screen, and a 40-foot (12 m) tall mirrorball lemon. U2's \"big shtick\" failed, however, to satisfy many who were seemingly confused by the band's new kitsch image and elaborate sets. The postponement of Pop's release date in order to complete the album meant rehearsal time for the tour was severely reduced, and performances in early shows suffered. A highlight of the tour was the concert in Sarajevo where U2 were the first major group to perform there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the concert as \"an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile.\" Bono called the show \"one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life\". One month after the conclusion of the PopMart Tour, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, \"Trash of the Titans\", in which Homer Simpson disrupted the band on stage during a PopMart concert."
