        "text": "Wrexham striker Paul Mullin has issued an encouraging update on his condition after he suffered a punctured lung during their 3-1 win over Manchester United in San Diego.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who helped fire Wrexham to the National League title last season, was clattered by United goalkeeper Nathan Bishop in the opening exchanges at the Snapdragon Stadium. Mullin had raced through on goal to chase down a loose ball and was smashed into by the United shot-stopper, who had rushed off his line to try and gather the ball.\n\nThe Wrexham ace required medical attention from both sets of club medical staff and needed oxygen. Fortunately, he was able to walk off the pitch before being taken to hospital.\n\nMullin, from his hospital bed, has issued an update on his health, thanking everyone who has messaged him for their well wishes.\n\nWant to join our MUFC Pro club for a totally ad-free version of the MEN's Man United app packed with premium features?

All good here.\"\n\nThe Wrexham striker, who was the top goalscorer in the FA Cup last season, will be hoping to make as speedy a recovery as possible. Wrexham are currently riding the crest of a wave after securing a long-awaited return to the Football League last term.\n\nWrexham boss Phil Parkinson blasted Bishop in his post-match press conference, admitting that it would be best for him to \"steer clear\" of anyone associated with the League Two club, comments which United are understood to be unhappy about.\n\nParkinson said: \"It's a clumsy challenge from the goalkeeper, I'm disappointed with that. It should have been a straight red. If it's not denying a goalscoring opportunity, it's still a dangerous challenge.\n\n\"So if you add the two scenarios together he should have been off the pitch. It's a dangerous challenge and obviously, Paul Mullin is our talisman.\n\n\"I'm fuming about it, I've got to be honest with you. It was a clumsy, reckless, challenge in a pre-season game and I'm not happy with it at all. I haven't seen the goalie and he's probably best steering clear of us for the time being because we're not very happy.\"\n\nUnited are fearful that Bishop, who shares the same agency as Mullin, could be targeted with online abuse for the incident, though it was purely accidental.\n\nBishop has also reached out to Mullin on Twitter to apologise, saying: \"Just wanted to share my sincerest apologies to @PMullin7. A complete misjudgement and a genuine accident with 0 malicious intent at all!\n\n\"Wishing you the speediest recovery and hope to see you back scoring goals as soon as possible!\""
