        "text": "Industrial Strength Bluegrass–2024 IBMA Nominee!\n\nThe Industrial Strength Bluegrass Festival has once again captured the attention of the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) with a prestigious nomination for Event of the Year. Building on our previous success in 2022, this recognition reaffirms the festival's reputation for excellence and innovation in the industry.

Buy/Stream Let Time Ride Here!\n\nIndustrial Strength Bluegrass [CD]\n\n$\n\n19.95\n\n“They are awesome!”\n\nPete Fisher, Former General Manager,\n\n​Grand Ole Opry\n\n\"Joe Mullins is what could be termed a double threat in the business. Musically, he is one of the top bluegrass acts in the business along with his band, the Radio Ramblers, but he also is one of the top radio personalities in the genre. Spend any amount of time with him, and you'll be in amazement at his vocal chops -- whether singing or announcing.\"\n\nChuck Dauphin, Billboard Magazine\n\n\"Joe is a driving force in the world of bluegrass. Over the past three decades, he has devoted his life both to bluegrass performance and to disseminating great bluegrass, gospel and country music via radio. A masterful Scruggs-style banjo picker and gifted singer known for his soaring high tenor, he leads a top-notch band that can do it all, delivering impeccable instrumentals and superb harmony singing with equal ease.\"\n\nNational Council of Traditional Arts\n\n\"Whether it's a live performance at the Grand Ole Opry or one of the band's singles or albums being featured in a Top Ten countdown show, the Radio Ramblers have hit on just the right combination of bluegrass, traditional country, and gospel music to propel them into the top tier of today's touring bands.\"\n\nTom Adams, Banjo Newsletter\n\n“These guys are among the elite in the business keeping the fires lit for the original bluegrass sound.”\n\nCraig Havighurst, Music City Roots\n\n“A second-generation ’grasser, Mullins grew up around music at its very best, and the Radio Ramblers’ take on tradition is more informed -- and therefore richer and more nuanced -- than that of many who wave the banner.”\n\nJon Weisberger, Nashville Scene"
