        "text": "It all started in 1976 in Dublin, when Mullen posted a “musicians wanted” ad at a school. Three other teenagers signed up and the band’s first rehearsal took place in the modest confines of Mullen’s kitchen. The Edge’s older brother Richard “Dik” Evans played the guitar with them (before the band was called U2), but he quit after the first 18 months and went on to study computer science, per Ozy, leaving behind the foursome that would become international icons.\n\nIt took them a few years to find their bearings, but by the 1980s, the group had found their sound with songs like “I Will Follow” and “Out of Control”.\n\nBut it hasn’t always been easy. “We come close to breaking up much more often than you’d think,” Bono recently told The Washington Post. “Usually after the really good albums, because they cost you in personal relationships because you’re pushing each other and get really at your elastic limit.”\n\nBut they’ve made it work, and it’s paid off in spades. Financially, they’re now collectively worth about US$1.8 billion, according to The Richest.\n\nSo, 22 Grammy awards and 170 million record sales later, who’s the richest band member of U2 in 2022, according to Celebrity Net Worth figures?\n\n4. Larry Mullen Jr. – US$350 million\n\nFrom performing in his kitchen to the world’s biggest stadiums, Mullen has seen his wealth explode thanks to the success of U2. However, the 61-year-old drummer, who has been playing since the band’s inception, recently said he may need to take a break from performing if they do go ahead and tour in 2023 due to elbow and knee injuries, per NME.\n\nThis probably won’t affect his fortune much though, considering he currently sits on about US$350 million. Besides U2, he’s also starred in films like Man on the Train (2011) and supported the soundtrack for Mission: Impossible (1996) with bandmate Clayton.\n\n3. Adam Clayton – US$400 million\n\nU2’s bassist has padded his reported US$400 million bank balance thanks to the steady success of the band. At 62, he owns an impressive property portfolio scattered across the globe and has churned out 14 studio albums with his fellow band members.\n\n2. The Edge – US$400 million\n\nDavid Evans, better known as The Edge, is U2’s lead guitarist and keyboardist. The Essex-born musician has racked up US$400 million over the years and is also known for collaborating with other prominent artists including Jay-Z, Rihanna and Tina Turner.\n\n1. Bono – US$700 million\n\nBono is the most famous – and evidently also the richest – member of U2, with a net worth almost two times that of bandmate The Edge. The 62-year-old vocalist has about US$700 million in the bank – but it’s not all been earned from music.\n\nBritish media reported that a sizeable chunk of Bono’s fortune may have come from his investment firm Elevation Partners’ 2.3 per cent share in Facebook, bought back in 2009. By 2015, the firm’s stake was already worth just under US$1 billion.\n\nThe band’s frontman – real name Paul David Hewson – is a well known philanthropist, but he’s also not been shy about splurging on extravagant items for himself over the years. Bono reportedly has properties in Dublin, New York and the French Riviera, two luxury yachts – including a US$25 million superyacht called Cyan – and a supreme car and bike collection that features a Tesla Model S, Volkswagen Tiguan and Ducati 916, per The Richest."
