        "text": "As his style evolved, he became more involved in the writing of the songs, particularly in conjunction with Adam, his partner in the rhythm section. Having earlier been described as the band's 'weak link' (in fact CBS Ireland point-blank refused to sign the band initially, unless they got rid of him), he became much more assured and competent as his drumming became a more integral part of the songs, rather than an apparent afterthought.\n\nBono describes Larry as \" a very complex character\". He has said that it is the way Larry hits his bass drum that makes U2 a true rock 'n' roll band. It is fitting that as the founder of the group he is still credited with being the backbone of the band.\n\nAs U2's popularity increased, Larry adopted the 'Junior' suffix to his name, to avoid being confused with his father. At the time, Larry senior was receiving some unexpected tax demands which were intended for his son.\n\nLarry has always been the quiet man of U2, preferring to let the other band members take centre stage at press conferences etc. He is also perhaps the most level headed, and is the most likely to put the brake on any elaborate and expensive plans that Bono in particular might have for complex stage sets etc. Despite the fame that success has brought, he is still content to remain largely in the background. During the recording of Pop Larry suffered from severe back problems and was forced to take a back seat while he underwent surgery. As a result he experimented much more with electronic drum machines and contributed heavily to the more techno feel of the album.\n\nHe lives with long time girlfriend Ann Acheson, and they have 3 children - son Aaron Elvis (born October 1995) and daughter Ava (born December 1998). During the Astoria show in London in February 2001 Bono announced to the crowd that Larry and Anne had become parents for the third time. Few details of this latest addition are known, although rumour has it that the baby is a girl named Anya.\n\nTrade Mark\n\nVery short spiked blonde hair\n\n*All BIOS should be considered as a collection of information available on line as well as within books related to U2.
