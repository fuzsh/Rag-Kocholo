What is CRISM?

The Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Matters (CRISM) is a national network of researchers, service providers, policy makers and people with lived experience across Canada. Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), CRISM's overall objective is to conduct research and translate it into evidence-based interventions for substance misuse, towards the improvement and creation of health system changes. Our intent is to support the creation of more effective, personal and adoptable intervention programs and services. The national CRISM website may be found here.

Established in 2015, CRISM is made up of four regional 'Nodes' across Canada, and is modeled after the U.S.-based Clinical Trials Network of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). CRISM was established to facilitate communication and collaboration among addiction service providers, researchers and policy-makers Canada-wide. CRISM focuses on research on prevention and treatment interventions for substance misuse (primarily illicit drugs and non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs), and knowledge translation of related research and evidence.

What is OCRINT?

OCRINT (the Ontario CRISM Node Team) is one of the four CRISM nodes, and is housed within the Institute for Mental Health Policy Research (IMHPR) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), in Toronto, Ontario. Led by Dr. JÃ¼rgen Rehm, senior scientist at IMHPR, and Professor and Chair (Addiction Policy), University of Toronto, OCRINT is made up of an interdisciplinary team of researchers, service providers, policy makers and peers, together with a team of co-principal investigators and knowledge users.

Other CRISM Nodes:

Interested researchers, service providers, decision-makers and peers in Ontario are invited to become members of OCRINT. Members will have access to OCRINT/CRISM resources and support, including our newsletters, as well as opportunities to collaborate and share research and interests. OCRINT hosts an annual symposium to which all members are invited to attend and share their research and ideas with the OCRINT team and other members. If you would like to become affiliated with the CRISM Ontario Node, please access the online survey link below. It takes no more than 5 minutes to complete the questions. The survey asks about you and your interests, and by completing it, you will help us tailor regional Node activities to your interests. The information we collect will be used for planning purposes, will stored securely in a password-protected network, and will be used to develop a Node member database.
