        "text": "Bishop Robert Brennan will celebrate the annual Chrism Mass tonight, Tuesday, April 4, 2023, at 7:30 p.m., at the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph, 856 Pacific Street, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. During the Mass, the bishop will bless the oils used by priests all year. He will also lead more than 280 priests and bishops in renewing their promises of service to the Church.\n\nThe Chrism Mass is one of the most solemn and significant liturgies of the Catholic Church. It is marked by the ceremonial blessing of the oil of catechumens, the oil of the sick, and the consecration of the oil of chrism, which will be used in all churches of the Diocese of Brooklyn throughout the liturgical year. The oils are used to anoint the sick, baptize catechumens and infants, ordain priests, and anoint altars. This Mass is celebrated in dioceses around the world.\n\nMembers of the media are invited to attend.\n\nLive coverage of the Chrism Mass begins at 7:30 p.m. on NET TV. The Brooklyn Diocesan Cable Channel is available on Channel 97 (Spectrum), Channel 30 (Optimum), and Channel 548 (Fios).\n\nViewers can also watch the programming live on NET TV’s website at www.netny.tv/watchnow.\n\n###"
