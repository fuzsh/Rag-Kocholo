        "text": "Growing Faith is the movement that exists to put children, young people and families instinctively at the heart of all the mission and ministry of the Church by changing the culture of the Church of England.\n\nIt comes from the vision set by the House of Bishops and endorsed by General Synod in 2019. It involves churches, schools and households working together to help children, young people and families have life in all its fullness.\n\nThe Growing Faith Foundation seeks to benefit children and young people, helping them create the world they want to live in, specifically through the lens of the Christian faith.\n\nEvery Diocese has appointed one or more Growing Faith Champions to take forward the Growing Faith mission locally.\n\nThe Growing Faith Foundation is developing work in four main areas: Networks, Learning Hubs, Programmes and Research."
