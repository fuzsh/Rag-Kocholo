        "text": "Chris is a landscape architect who has practiced for the last 15 years with internationally recognized firms that specialize in ecologically informed, place-based design. His completed projects range from therapeutic green roofs for hospitals, to the revitalization of Frederick Law Olmsted-designed parks, to designs that have pushed the boundaries of ecological and sustainable design. He is driven to foster areas of ecological function and richness for the benefit of humans and other species. As Executive Director of the Trust, Chris serves as an advocate for nature, the environment, ecological research and education, while always being focused on creating an emotional and intellectual experience for all those visiting the Pennypack Preserve. Chris was a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, serving as a natural resource management volunteer in a wildlife sanctuary in Thailand not far from the Mekong River. He holds a Masters of Landscape Architecture from the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and a Bachelors in Environmental Studies from the University at Buffalo."
