And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy and lively sacrifice unto thee; humbly beseeching thee, that all we, who are partakers of this holy communion, may be fulfilled with thy grace and heavenly benediction. And although we be unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and service; not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences, through Jesus Christ our Lord; by whom, and with whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O Father almighty, world without end.\n\nAll Amen.\n\nPrayer of Thanksgiving\n\nAlmighty and ever-living God, we most heartily thank thee, for that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, who have duly received these holy mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious body and blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; and dost assure us thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us; and that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son, which is the blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by the merits of the most precious death and passion of thy dear Son. And we most humbly beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy grace, that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end.\n\nAll Amen.\n\nGloria in Excelsis\n\nAll Glory be to God on high,\n\nand in earth peace, good will towards men.\n\nWe praise thee, we bless thee,\n\nwe worship thee, we glorify thee,\n\nwe give thanks to thee for thy great glory,\n\nO Lord God, heavenly King,\n\nGod the Father almighty.\n\nO Lord, the only-begotten Son Jesu Christ;\n\nO Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,\n\nthat takest away the sins of the world,\n\nhave mercy upon us.\n\nThou that takest away the sins of the world,\n\nhave mercy upon us.\n\nThou that takest away the sins of the world,\n\nreceive our prayer.\n\nThou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father,\n\nhave mercy upon us.\n\nFor thou only art holy;\n\nthou only art the Lord;\n\nthou only, O Christ,\n\nwith the Holy Ghost,\n\nart most high\n\nin the glory of God the Father.\n\nAmen.\n\nThe Blessing\n\nThe priest says\n\nThe peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord: and the blessing of God almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and remain with you always.\n\nAll Amen.\n\nA hymn may be sung.\n\n¶ Annex to Order Two ↑\n\nThird Exhortation from\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer\n\nDearly beloved in the Lord, ye that mind to come to the holy Communion of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, must consider how Saint Paul exhorteth all persons diligently to try and examine themselves, before they presume to eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart and lively faith we receive that holy Sacrament; (for then we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ and drink his blood; then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; we are one with Christ, and Christ with us;) so is the danger great, if we receive the same unworthily. For then we are guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ our Saviour; we eat and drink our own damnation, not considering the Lord’s Body; we kindle God’s wrath against us; we provoke him to plague us with divers diseases, and sundry kinds of death. Judge therefore yourselves, brethren, that ye be not judged of the Lord; repent you truly for your sins past; have a lively and steadfast faith in Christ our Saviour; amend your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men; so shall ye be meet partakers of those holy mysteries. And above all things ye must give most humble and hearty thanks to God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the world by the death and passion of our Saviour Christ, both God and man; who did humble himself, even to the death upon the Cross, for us miserable sinners, who lay in darkness and the shadow of death; that he might make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting life. And to the end that we should always remember the exceeding great love of our Master and only Saviour Jesus Christ, thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits which by his precious blood-shedding he hath obtained to us; he hath instituted and ordained holy mysteries, as pledges of his love, and for a continual remembrance of his death, to our great and endless comfort. To him, therefore, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, let us give (as we are most bounden) continual thanks; submitting ourselves wholly to his holy will and pleasure, and studying to serve him in true holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.\n\nAll Amen.\n\nProper Prefaces from\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer\n\nFor additional Prefaces, see Note 28 here and texts here.\n\nChristmas\n\nBecause thou didst give Jesus Christ thine only Son to be born as at this time for us; who, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, was made very man of the substance of the Virgin Mary his mother; and that without spot of sin, to make us clean from all sin. Therefore with angels …\n\nEaster\n\nBut chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the glorious resurrection of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord: for he is the very paschal lamb, which was offered for us, and hath taken away the sin of the world; who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his rising to life again hath restored to us everlasting life.\n\nTherefore with angels …\n\nAscension\n\nThrough thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord;\n\nwho after his most glorious resurrection manifestly appeared to all his apostles, and in their sight ascended up into heaven to prepare a place for us; that where he is, thither we might also ascend, and reign with him in glory.\n\nTherefore with angels …\n\nPentecost (Whitsun)\n\nThrough Jesus Christ our Lord; according to whose most true promise, the Holy Ghost came down as at this time from heaven with a sudden great sound, as it might have been a mighty wind, in the likeness of fiery tongues, lighting upon the apostles, to teach them, and to lead them to all truth; giving them both the gift of divers languages, and also boldness with fervent zeal constantly to preach the gospel unto all nations; whereby we have been brought out of darkness and error into the clear light and true knowledge of thee, and of thy Son Jesus Christ.\n\nTherefore with angels …\n\nTrinity Sunday\n\nWho art one God, one Lord; not one only Person, but three Persons in one Substance.
