His substantive interests are in the areas of addictions, public and population health, evaluation research, injury prevention, road safety and public policy. He is particularly interested in the intersection of substance use and various health outcomes, with a special emphasis on young people. (See Dalhousie Profile)\n\nJennifer Swansburg\n\nNode Manager, CRISM Atlantic Node\n\nJennifer joined Dalhousie University in 2011 after completing a BSc in Psychology. She is interested in the impact efficacious treatment can have on youth and adults suffering with mental health and addictions concerns. Jennifer has worked with Dr. Stewart’s Mood Anxiety and Addiction Co-morbidity (MAAC) Lab on a number of research projects involving substance use, gambling, and anxiety. She joined the CRISM Quebec- Atlantic team in 2015.

Renato began his work in health research in Vancouver’s downtown east side back in 2018 whilst completing a dual degree at Simon Fraser University in the areas of biochemistry/molecular biology and human physiology. Renato’s diverse research experience has granted him a robust knowledge set of the research pipeline. It has motivated and inspired his involvement in community-based, participatory approaches to research, and made him a strong advocate for harm reduction and culturally relevant, inclusive research and clinical practices. In his free time, Renato enjoys reading, surfing, soccer, cooking, and chess.\n\nRenee Masching\n\nIndigenous Engagement Coordinator, CRISM Atlantic Node\n\nWe welcome Renee Masching to the role of Indigenous Engagement Coordinator (Interim).
