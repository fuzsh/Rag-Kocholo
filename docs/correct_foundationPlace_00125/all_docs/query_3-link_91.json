Stable patrimony includes things like real estate, endowments, precious works of art, and so on. Cash savings is not normally treated as part of the stable patrimony. The universal laws of the Church make it more difficult for parishes, dioceses, and other Catholic entities to transfer ownership or control of stable patrimony.

This transfer of control is referred to as alienation.\n\nStanding Committee\n\nA committee that remains in place for an extended period of time.\n\nStatement of Receipts and Disbursements\n\nA financial statement for cash basis entities, which summarizes the receipts and disbursements paid by a parish or one of its units over a specified period of time.\n\nStatutes\n\nRules governing legal persons in church law (e.g., parishes) and defining purpose, constitution, operation, et al.\n\nStewardship\n\nGiving, typically through the Church, based on the Christian understanding that all of creation belongs to God and people are merely stewards of all their resources – including time, talent, money, property, etc. – and not owners of them.\n\nStrategic Planning\n\nThe process by which the Archdiocese defines its direction, based on its mission of sharing Christ, and establishes a means by which to best pursue its goals through the use of its current resources.

Issues are dealt with and policies are established at the lowest proper level of responsibility and competency. Thus, in practice, a Parish Pastoral Council will not make decisions that properly belong to its commissions, and a commission will not make decisions that properly belong to its committees. In all cases, however, the Parish Pastoral Council retains and exercises the right to review decisions made by commissions or committees. It must be understood that set policies and procedures cannot be bypassed at any level. Decisions on all levels must be in line with Archdiocesan policies and guidelines.\n\nSubstantial Agreement\n\nDecisions that can be supported and upheld by all.\n\nSurvivorship Whole Life Insurance\n\nAlso called Joint Life or Second-to-Die Whole Life Insurance, this insurance has premiums based on two lives and pays benefits upon the death of the second of the two persons.\n\nBack to top\n\nT\n\nTabernacle\n\nThe receptacle in which the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in churches and chapels.\n\nTeam\n\nA group of individuals committed to a common goal, who support each other, fully exploit member skills and make quality decisions through the use of effective processes.\n\nTelephone Numbers\n\nThere are many ways to write a telephone number but we prefer only this format: 313-596-7315. Leave out the preceding “1.” If there is a phone extension, use the abbreviation, ext., followed by the number.\n\nTemporal Goods\n\nAll the material, earthly goods the Church acquires, administers and alienates.

Or, if spanning morning and afternoon, use 11 AM to 1 PM. Do not use a hyphen or en dash in a timespan. Use the word “to.” Do not write the word o’clock when referencing time. It should be reserved for spoken language.\n\nTitles\n\nThere is one main rule to live by with titles. That is that a title is capitalized only if it is followed by the person’s name, such as: Pope Benedict XVI. In the opposing example, write, Benedict XVI is pope of the Catholic Church. For all questions on religious titles, refer to the CNS style guide (195).\n\nTitles (Composition)\n\nThere are many ways to annotate titles of works, whether they are books, music or art. For the web, we prefer to use italics, not quotation marks, to annotate titles in a sentence. It is easier on the eyes. This rule also applies to names of newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nTitles (Suffix)\n\nWhen referring to an individual only use a suffix after their name if it’s pertinent to the subject you’re writing about. Do not reference a person as holding a PhD if the story is about baseball.

Together in Faith is the process used by the parishes to put all available resources on the table and - with clergy and lay members together - discern how we can best us those resources to maintain, strengthen and grow the church.\n\nTogether In Faith, Phase One (TIF I)\n\nImplemented between 2004 and 2010, this was the first phase of a new pastoral planning process for the Archdiocese of Detroit. The outcome of the plan is published on the Archdiocese of Detroit website at www.aod.org/tif and implementation of the plan in many cases is ongoing and being incorporated into Phase II.\n\nTogether In Faith, Phase Two (TIF II)\n\nThe current phase of the ongoing Together In Faith process, which began in January 2011.\n\nTrademark, Service Mark\n\nNever use a ™ or ® next to the name of a brand-name product or service.

Conferences of Bishops exist throughout the world, sometimes made up of Bishops from a number of smaller countries.\n\nUnits of Measurement\n\nIn body copy, never abbreviate weights and measures. Reserve this for directories and tables where space is limited.
