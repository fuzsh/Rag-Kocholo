An AI system consists of three layers: the systems layer (including both hardware and software), the modeling layer (e.g., the model architecture, training procedure), and the data layer (e.g., how to supervise the system). Currently, all three layers require human experts to manually make decisions (e.g., designing custom kernels, manual hyperparameter tuning, manual weighting of data). However, as AlphaGo and AlphaFold have clearly demonstrated, if we have a clear objective function, automation can optimize it far better than a human can. This enables the human expert to focus on higher-level, strategic planning. Finally, automatic optimization requires simulation, which can be expensive. We will develop a cascade of efficient (possibly approximate) simulators of all three levels of the stack to enable efficient optimization.\n\nSmart Fields Consortium (SFC)\n\nContact: Samantha Mickens\n\nComputational optimization, history matching (data assimilation), uncertainty quantification, and data interpretation are important technologies for designing and managing subsurface flow operations.
