Gallo MD MPH is a Professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. His research concerns the form and presentation of depression in late life in community settings, particularly primary health care in the context of medical comorbidity. A major focus of his research concerns the form and course of depression among older adults. Based on clinical experience, he noted that depressed older persons in primary care settings often did not assent to sadness. A second focus area has involved mental health treatment in primary care settings including medical comorbidity. He is the PI for a long-term follow-up of PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly – Collaborative Trial), a randomized trial of depression management in primary care practices. The follow-up studies have examined mortality as an outcome in the context of medical comorbidity. He teaches a course in the School of Public Health called “The Intersection of Physical and Mental Health.” A third research focus involves the use of mixed methods in health services research. Mixed methods can bridge the gap between evidence generated from interventions under “ideal” conditions and the application of evidence-based practices for diverse populations in various contexts.

Trained as a social and psychiatrist epidemiologist, Dr. Reisner’s research focuses on understanding and mitigating health inequities for LGBTQIA+ populations, particularly in mental health and substance use, HIV infection, and healthcare access and quality outcomes. Dr. Reisner brings deep expertise in transgender and gender diverse population health, community-engaged research methods and peer-delivered interventions, cohort study and clinical trial design, and social determinants of health. His work utilizes a “participatory population perspective” (Reisner et al., Lancet, 2016) to work “with” not “on” communities to promote health equity.\n\nRoxann Roberson-Nay\n\nDr. Roberson-Nay is a Professor of Psychology at The University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The goal of her research has been the delineation of genetic, biological, and psychosocial mechanisms that confer risk for the development of internalizing conditions broadly, with a particular interest in panic spectrum and mood disorders liability. Her research program seeks to examine these mechanisms within a developmental framework. She utilizes multiple methodical approaches ranging from neuroimaging to epidemiological to quantitative genetics. To study genetic mechanisms, she uses both molecular and behavioral genetic methods. She also studies risk mechanisms in relation to developmental or time trajectories that may be associated with differing genetic underpinnings using advanced statistical modeling.\n\nHer current, primary research efforts focus on investigations of: (1) genetic mechanisms (i.e., DNA methylation and gene expression) associated with major depression onset and risk, (2) panic risk, (3) biological and physiological systems (hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system pathways) subserving anxiety/panic and mood conditions, and (4) endophenotypic measures related to anxiety/mood risk.\n\nNorman Sartorius\n\nNorman Sartorius, MD, PhD, FRCPsych, is the President of the International Association for the Improvement of Mental Health Programs. In the early years of his career he was interested in and studied psychopharmacotherapy and the standardization of assessment instruments for use in psychiatry and psychology. Later he conducted major international collaborative studies on schizophrenia, depression, quality of life, effects of female sterilization on mental health and the impact of HIV on psychological functioning. He has also conducted studies on the functioning of health services and the provision of mental health care in primary health services. A topic of particular interest in many of the studies which he conducted was transcultural comparisons and methods of measuring psychological functioning in different contexts. Most recently he has been engaged in research on comorbidity of diabetes and depression, and on the stigma of mental illness. Over the years he has also conducted special courses for young investigators and early career psychiatrists with particular emphasis on their acquisition of professional and leadership skills. These courses were by now held on all continents and were attended by more than 3000 participants from more than 50 countries.\n\nBio\n\nAmy Schulz\n\nAmy J.
