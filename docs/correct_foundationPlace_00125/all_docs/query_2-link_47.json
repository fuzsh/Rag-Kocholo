        "text": "What I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy primary role is to guide the tribe up the mountain. This means maintaining a level of awareness of what’s happening over the horizon, and nurturing my tribe to respond quickly to those opportunities or threats. I provide leadership and motivation, and try to encourage my tribe to live within our Golden Rules. Formally, I am responsible for the selection and appointment of our leadership. I assist my team leaders to develop policies, objectives and indicators. I monitor the progress and performance of our tribal team leaders. I like to maintain relationships with our key clients and allies. Statutory compliance and financial performance are important to me. The most important task is understanding every member of the tribe, and helping them to achieve personal excellence.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nI have more than 30 years’ experience as an entrepreneur, management consultant, senior executive, director and agribusiness professional. My diverse background, combined with strong analytical and facilitation skills, has given me a deep insight into businesses across most industry sectors and in various stages of development. My background explains the Kilimanjaro name and is central to our commitment to working with clients as a “farmers not hunters” –willing to invest for the long-term and keen to nurture lasting and trusted relationships. I like to think I have some wisdom, but not in the sense of being a “wise old man”. I also bring youth and humour.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nI manage the local operation as the proxy of CEO Ronnie Baskind. This involves general management, all local HR matters, revenue & sustainability, facilities and logistics. I am driven to lead good people to achieve great things.\n\n“With inspired people, customers will consistently get great service”.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI was the previous owner of Bizpro NZ Ltd, GlobalBizpro Ltd (sold to Enprise 2015) and have 25 years in software sales and consulting. With extensive experience in selling and implementing software solutions for business generally, my key passion lies within Manufacturing and Retail (POS Systems).\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar, refereeing touch rugby, running, mountain biking and caravanning as well as being a try-hard comedian.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy primary role is to keep the tribe moving. Whether this is the logistics of how we continue to move (through the methodology) or the day to day running we keep moving. It is important that our tribe is the leader in our field, moving faster than all others. Together with this, we continually improve efficiencies and up skilling of our tribe members which in turn benefits our clients. I ensure that all tribe members follow our Golden Rules and reinforce the importance of these on a daily basis. I love to work with every member of the tribe and enjoy watching them grow. I strongly believe that our people are our greatest asset.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nMy formal qualifications are in Engineering where I majored in software engineering. Applying the principles in engineering to software solutions is very near to my heart and something I believe in. This can be seen through our structured methodology that has evolved with us over all these years. It can also be seen in the internal systems we have in place such as our own Wiki and structured way of organising and presenting information. I feel there is always a solution and an answer to every question and working these through with my team is what I bring to the tribe most. There is no better feeling than solving what seems to be an impossible question for a client working with a team.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy role within Kilimanjaro is constantly evolving and I love the way it keeps me on my toes. Having studied teaching and business management at UTS, learning was and will always be my primary focus. Whether it be designing and delivering custom training for highly configured sites or ensuring a UAT program is adequately catering to the needs of an organisation, my aim is to ensure that the technology we deliver is understood by the client. We have some of the smartest technical minds in the business but unless our clients can use and understand this technology, their efforts will be wasted. I am also directly involved as an implementer on a number of projects and as a result, have developed a deep respect for our methodology.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI have worked with a wide variety of industries in developing national training programs, as well as delivering coaching and change management programs in top tier consulting firms during my three years in the UK. This has given me strong project management and communication skills as well as a unique insight into the people who work in our client organisations. I am particularly focused on individual and client needs and always look for the Win-Win solution. Wherever possible this is achieved through the use of coaching techniques so that everyone feels ownership of the final solution. 1 + 1 definitely equals 3.\n\nWhat I do for Kilimanjaro\n\nI’m involved in formulating strategy around the support process and helping our teams to implement that strategy. I’m also responsible for communicating our strategic vision and aligning our processes to that vision. A key focus is #ClientFirst and my job is to role model client-centric behaviours and reinforce those behaviours in others. I still spend a large part of my day working directly with customers in a consulting capacity. I also pick up the odd support call along the way!\n\nWhat I bring to the team\n\nI’ve worked for about 20 years in the finance + IT space, including 15 years with Enprise. Prior to that, I worked as a Tax Accountant for EY London (great fun!) and Deloitte’s. I hold a degree in Human Resource Management and a Diploma in Management Systems. It’s only taken me 30 years to start putting some of that study into practice!\n\nI’m an avid rugby fan and played rugby up until I was about 45. I use the term “played” loosely. I’m blessed to be married to my wife Dallas, who is as passionate about cooking good food as I am about eating it. We travelled to Europe when we were younger before returning to New Zealand to start a family. Our idea of a perfect holiday now is camping with friends at one of Northlands amazing beaches.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy role within Kilimanjaro, in addition to being a member of the management team, is to work closely with business leaders and help them on their journey of assessing ERP Solutions within the MYOB platform, with the ultimate goal to improve efficiency in their organisations.\n\nBy utilising my experience with ERP products, Kilimanjaro’s methodologies and industry knowledge, I am able to help minimise risk for potential clients throughout their journey “one step at a time”.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nI have had a long association (over 17 years) with ERP solutions. First implementing end end-to-end business solutions across a wide range of industries and then focusing on business process improvement in businesses through better utilisation of their ERP and incorporating “best of breed” connected services. I bring not only a deep technical product knowledge but experience in analysing business needs and helping potential clients with their decisions to move onto the MYOB platform and letting Kilimanjaro Consulting guide them on this journey.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy primary role within Kilimanjaro is to understand our customer’s needs. I lead Kilimanjaro’s Strategic Account Management and Connected Services team as we support our customers and engage with the broader tribe to identify solutions and services that will benefit our customers and help them ’sharpen the spear’.\n\nWe recognise that technology is one element of transformation, that people and processes need to be aligned, and that culture and change are often the most significant challenges our customers face. MYOB Exo and MYOB Advanced are key technology enablers in our customer’s journey to optimise operational efficiency, enhance customer value, manage risk and uncover new revenue opportunities.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nI’ve worn many hats in my career including software development, ERP implementation and IT management responsibilities. This multi-disciplinary perspective helps me understand the business drivers, while also getting both the big picture and the intricate details.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nAs the finance manager, I prepare the workings and journal entries for the month-end close and month-end reconciliations for Kilimanjaro Consulting. I also organise the payments to our suppliers on a weekly basis, ensuring our finances are up-to-date. Additionally, I am working with the NZ team in transitioning the finance function for ANZ, and oversee the rollout of Expense Manager in NZ.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nPrior to working in Australia, I have over 3 and a half years of experience as a finance manager in a similar-sized company in Ireland. My expertise in reporting comes from my experience in month-end consolidated reporting and leading the company audit each year. When the opportunity comes, I like to travel. When I’m not travelling, I like to catch up with friends and go to the gym (or at least try to!).\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nI am in charge of the Marketing Department, responsible for developing, implementing and executing Kilimanjaro’s Marketing Plan. In everyday tasks, I promote the business’ vision and mission in line with the Kilimanjaro brand. I manage all Marketing Communication channels making sure our current and potential clients are informed and have easy access to information about Kilimanjaro.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI always say there is room for improvement, and I bring a drive to make things better. With over 8 years of experience in marketing in the ERP industry, I feel confident with taking Kilimanjaro to the top of the marketing mountain. I admire challenging tasks, working with clients and building outstanding relationships with them. I have completed an Engineering degree in Spatial Development and Infrastructure but decided to change my career pathway into Marketing where I have found my true passion. Following my heart, I have gained my marketing skills during Postgraduate studies in Digital Marketing.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nI am an MYOB Exo team leader in New Zealand. My team provides implementation, customisation, and support services to clients across all of New Zealand. With over 100 years of combined ERP software experience, we can offer solutions to even the most complex problems. My team’s expertise specialises in job costing, manufacturing and supporting POS/Retail customers. I champion a collaborative approach and encourage knowledge-sharing within my team.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nI have worked with MYOB Exo and in the ERP field for almost 20 years. I pride myself on bridging the gap between financial, operational and technical challenges. I enjoy talking to clients and understanding how their businesses work so that I can assist them.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nAs Team Leader of support for Kilimanjaro’s MYOB Advanced clients, it is my role to make the support process as smooth and efficient as possible. I am the first point of contact when clients go live with implementations, to introduce them to the support team and the process on how we will support them. The support team need to be responsive to identify which cases are the most urgent and the priority but also responding to all cases in a timely manner. This allows clients to continue using the product as effectively as possible.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI have over 20 years of experience supporting clients in financial applications. I bring a fresh analytical mind to every support query to try and solve them as quickly as possible. Often the answer can be right in front of you if you can see with fresh eyes. For example, did you know that Kilimanjaro has the 5 consecutive letters KLMNO within in it, and in the right order?\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy primary role is to assist clients with implementing MYOB Advanced Payroll in their organisations. This includes system design, system build, training and live processing. I also support the client with their day-to-day processing and reporting needs. I also support clients in MYOB Advanced Business with my 5+ years of experience in the product.\n\nMy goal is to always strive to create solutions that are beneficial to our clients and aim to make their jobs as easy and smooth as possible.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI am a qualified Chartered Accountant (CA) and have worked in a corporate CA environment. My passion is certainly working with ERP solutions and thinking outside the box to put a smile on our client’s faces. Outside of work, I love to spend time with family and friends, do a little baking, watch or movie or two, and venture out into new things.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy role is within the Advanced Team providing implementation services. I help businesses manage and achieve growth by designing and configuring ERP systems that are efficient and intuitive. I work closely with clients to ensure the software meets their needs and that it integrates smoothly with their existing systems and business processes.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nWith more than 10 years of experience in implementing ERP in Europe, Asia and Australia, I offer an excellent understanding of business processes across a range of industries that have been gained through ERP consultancy. I am an agile thinker, adaptive to change with an exceptional eye for detail. Previously, I worked as an accountant and I now hold a CPA. With this experience, I consistently deliver in a number of ways including cost reduction strategy and project analysis. My end goal is always a successful delivery of any tasks to the client. I have a passion for lifelong professional and personal development.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nAt Kilimanjaro, I design, train and implement MYOB Advanced for clients across Australia. I also work closely with current clients to ensure they are taking advantage of product updates as they become available.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI have 7+ years’ experience implementing and supporting ERP, through this experience I have had the pleasure of working with clients across many industries in Australia and New Zealand. My IT and Systems Management background gives me a unique perspective on issues that come up in implementations and support. I often use this experience to look at the bigger picture, suggesting solutions that fit within/complement a clients existing technology ecosystem.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nAs the Team Leader for IT, I am responsible for keeping our networks available, safe, and secure. I also manage and develop the ExoHosted platform so that our clients can use MYOB Exo with cloud-based flexibility. I have a strong focus on innovation and technology that helps me guide both the IT and ExoHosted teams, and our clients, towards success.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nI have more than 20 years of IT knowledge and experience with innovation. This is across software development, MS Dynamics consulting, project management, systems architecture, and network management. My diverse experiences let me find new ways to bring technology to everyone, empowering and improving the way we interact with IT systems. This was the catalyst for developing the ExoHosted Platform, the only sustainable cloud platform built with MYOB Exo in mind.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nI oversee the work of 3 core teams at Kilimanjaro Consulting, including VIS, Software Consulting in NZ, and the Innovate team in Australia. I also undertake client development and customisation work and troubleshoot more complex issues. I focus my work around MYOB Exo, but I undertake some development work in MYOB Advanced where needed. I develop customisations for new and existing clients so that the software meets the business’s unique requirements.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nI bring more than 21 years of experience with software and its development. For my entire career, I have been a part of the ERP industry. This has given me the experience to work through any pain points or software issues that clients can throw at me. In my free time, I enjoy all things motor racing, snowboarding, and fishing when the New Zealand weather permits it.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nTraining and educating staff is critical for getting the most out of your MYOB product. One of our team’s strengths is the training available to clients across Australia and New Zealand. Recognising the potential for us to provide training opportunities to users of Exo Business, Exo Employer Services and MYOB Advanced, I have the exciting responsibility of managing all our training courses, investigating new opportunities for training and developing new training courses. I also liaison between clients and our consultants to provide customised training tailored specifically to the client’s needs and requirements.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nPrior to joining the Kilimanjaro Tribe, I managed the Partner Education Program for MYOB’s Enterprise Solution Division, upskilling new Exo Business consultants and developing a certification program for Exo Employer Services. Coming from a consulting background, I understand the principals involved in implementing a new system. As a qualified trainer, I also understand the importance of providing relevant and up-to-date training. With nearly two decades of knowledge on payroll and finance, I can ensure that our team provide the most appropriate training to help clients get the most out of their MYOB Exo and MYOB Advanced systems.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy key responsibilities at Enprise are Account Management, Project Management & Manage the Impress NZ Team. I’m also involved in Client demonstrations/meetings and help to offer possible solutions to meet the client’s growing business demands. I’m also a certified consultant and I do help out with Support & Implementations of Software Solutions as and when required.\n\nI’m certified in the below products:\n\nMYOB Exo Business\n\nMYOB Exo Employer Services (NZ Payroll)\n\nMYOB Exo Employer Services (AU Payroll)\n\nMYOB Advanced People (NZ Payroll)\n\nMYOB Advanced People (AU Payroll)\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI bring the knowledge, expertise and training skills that I have developed over the years since joining Enprise (now Kilimanjaro) as a Junior Support Consultant back in 2009. I now host over 11 years of experience in the MYOB Exo Space. This journey has given me the opportunity to grow my knowledge of ERP systems and challenge myself with heightened responsibilities. I actually left for a time back in 2013, but soon returned after discovering that the grass was not greener on the other side. We have such a good culture and environment here!\n\nIn 2016, I was appointed as Support Team Leader in March 2016, tasked with managing and supporting the team to foster growth in each individual role. I enjoyed this so much as I love helping people sharing the knowledge that I’ve gained over the years. Finally, in August 2020, I was given the responsibility of managing more Senior Consultants, and I believe this to be quite a different challenge of its own! But hey – who doesn’t love a challenge!\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nI work in the projects team to assist Kilimanjaro’s customers with any tricky challenges they may be facing as well as training and project management/implementation.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI have years of experience in consulting, implementation and support of various ERP systems, specialist application software, database administration, SQL and report writing.

Having worked through a number of projects in improving business processes, I am always keen to improve processes and create solutions that are best suited to the client’s business. After climbing Mt Kilimanjaro, I understand that scaling mountain tops is always a team journey, which is an embodiment of the Kilimanjaro Consulting values.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy role involves various tasks, upgrading software, customisations, working with developers to implement solutions and installation, building framework screens, EDI integrations, report writing and general support queries. The skills I learnt throughout my time here at Kilimanjaro Consulting have taught me how to problem solve — this is what I enjoy most! My goal is to provide fast and effective support and solutions for our customers.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nMy IT journey started as a receptionist in 2002 when Enprise first started out. After six months in that position, I started to get itchy feet and was offered a role in support. With how small the team was back then, I was thrown into the deep end, but I loved it. Solving complex problems, and helping others, as well as the connection you make with your clients, has really made me the consultant I am today at Kilimanjaro Consulting. I’m an advocate for saving our planet and keeping it green, which lead me to start my own little business Purely Natural NZ selling reusable products and health foods. Keeping fit and healthy is a big part of who I am also, I enjoy getting to the gym or out for a run daily if time is on my side 😊 My idea of a great weekend is getting out and about to the beach and in nature with my two beautiful boys Bailey and Jacob. I also enjoy watching live music – in summer you might just find me at a gig or two!\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nI guide our clients up the technology mountain, implementing MYOB Advanced so that they may improve efficiency. I work with our clients from the initial scope to the system set-up, implementation, and training.

This has given me an extensive knowledge base from which to guide our clients’ finance teams. I have worked across freight forwarding, courier, magazine publishing, manufacturing, and retail. With such a wide range of industry experience, I can better understand the client’s perspective and what they need from their system. Outside work, I enjoy photography, particularly nighttime photography of architecture and cityscapes.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy primary focus is ExoHosted and looking after over 800 users and 50+ servers, ensuring users can access the environment and work efficiently every day. Making customers the priority allows me to keep an emphasis on our #ClientFirst strategy.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nWith my Diploma in Information Technology and Bachelors in Digital Technology specialising in software engineering and website development, I have over 8 years of experience in the IT field, 6 of which have been at Enprise Solutions. I’m always self-developing and trying to broaden my knowledge, especially with technology changing so rapidly.\n\nI live in the beautiful Bay of Plenty so try and get to the beach as often as I can. Gamer and movie nut, and recently got into the gym scene and indoor football. Would like to do a LOT more travelling, in NZ and abroad, but have recently bought my first home so have switched my priorities to become an interior designer instead.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nMy role as a consultant is to provide a wide range of support services to the clients of Kilimanjaro Consulting. Working in the busy Client Services team, I provide support on MYOB Exo Business and its many modules.\n\nThanks to the advances in technology, support can be provided efficiently via a number options including TeamViewer, remote access direct to servers, 3rd party products, phone, email and more. Most days, all the above options are used with my preference being a combination of TeamViewer and phone support. In addition to the relationship that is built from talking to a client, I feel that it is paramount to understand the exact nature of the issue in order to find the right solution. Therefore, listening to the customer, whilst watching their TeamViewer session, is a great way to gain an understanding of the problem.\n\nWhat I bring to the Tribe\n\nPrior to Kilimanjaro, I completed a Bachelor of Business degree, majoring in Finance and Accounting. Combining the knowledge from this degree along with the technical skills in Exo, will equip me with the ability to solve clients’ problems and assist them in understanding any financial aspects that can arise as a result of these issues. In addition to my degree, I am completing a Chartered Accountant qualification to increase my existing accounting knowledge and improve upon the quality of service that I can provide to my clients.\n\nHaving come from a Hospitality background, I highly value customer service and understand its importance. I believe it is imperative that a high standard is achieved. I am always striving to maintain a high level of customer service and satisfaction.\n\nWhat I do at Kilimanjaro\n\nAs a goal-driven person, my aim is to reduce the debt outstanding on our debtor’s ledger. In my time here, I have already made great progress in reducing the debt. 120+days started at 10% and has now been reduced to a mere 3% of the ledger. I am the type of person who likes everything done yesterday. I can’t stand procrastination and this is reflected in the time I respond to queries from customers.

To this end, I believe that providing a fast, efficient response to a customer’s enquiry contributes to the company goal of being the best at what we do and delivering great customer focussed service.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nI started out in Export Sales and moved into Finance.

We look at the new pains and the existing ones, and what work-a-rounds, add-ons and disparate systems are still being used, and how they affected the business. I then introduce the prospect to the benefits of partnering with Kilimanjaro using either MYOB EXO or MYOB Advanced to tackle the future.\n\nWhat I bring to the tribe\n\nAs an education graduate of the state-school-closure-period of the 90’s, I had to stop and re-evaluate my future. My interests in computers and system design lead me to information technology sales.

While in my long-ago younger days I loved comedy and participated in standup, ice skating, karate, and other exciting activities that look good on a list of things that you’ve done in your life, these days I am more relaxed.
