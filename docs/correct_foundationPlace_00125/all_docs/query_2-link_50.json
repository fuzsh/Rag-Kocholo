We understand that needs-driven, community-based work is the key to ending animal homelessness. Help end animal homelessness by partnering with a leading animal welfare nonprofit.\n\nThe Brink Foundation\n\nThe Brink Foundation is a proud Humane Society of Tampa Bay supporter. They were a title sponsor for our 2020 Virtual Week of Giving and continue to support our mission.\n\nHillsborough County Pet Resource Center\n\nWe provide TNVR services to cats transported to us by the county. HSTB performs the services and then returns the cats to their neighborhoods. When HSTB hosts one of our two annual free shot clinics, we invite the county to come out and provide free licenses to their residents as well.\n\nThank you to Petco Love for your support!\n\nThank you to Petco Love for supporting our lifesaving work and enabling us to continue helping pets find loving homes. Thank you for providing free vaccines for pets in our community. Together, we’re partnering to save pet lives!\n\nMeals on Wheels of Tampa\n\nWe work with Meals on Wheels. HSTB has an Animeals program in which our volunteers deliver free pet food to those residents who are home-bound, disabled, and have no means of transportation. Meals on Wheels helps to refer pet owners to us.\n\nThe Spring of Tampa Bay\n\nOne of our newest partnerships is with the Spring, a domestic violence shelter here in Tampa. We work with the abuse victim by providing free veterinary care and foster care for their pet so that they are able to escape their abuser. We return the pet to the domestic violence survivor once they are in a safe housing situation.\n\nBlanket Tampa Bay\n\nWe partner with Blanket Tampa Bay, an organization that helps the homeless in Tampa. We provide them with blankets, leashes, collars, as well as pet food for people they visit. Many homeless people have a dog. We even provides medical care to those animals that need it and sterilize pets for free.\n\nCat Rescue Groups\n\nWe have many partnerships with local rescue groups including St. Francis Animal Society, Cat Crusaders, Cat Call, Rebel’s Rescue, and Rescue Cats of Florida. We perform TNVR services for these groups. We also perform TNVR for Pasco County Animal Services.\n\nFeeding Tampa Bay\n\nWe partner with Feeding Tampa Bay, an organization that focuses on providing food to the hundreds of thousands of food insecure families. We have them come out to our shot clinics to provide groceries and offer food assitance to those in need."
