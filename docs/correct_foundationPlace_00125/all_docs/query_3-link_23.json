        "text": "VATICAN CITY (CNS) – The work of protecting minors and other vulnerable people in the Catholic Church involves holding those in positions of power accountable for the abuse they commit, Pope Francis said.\n\nThe church’s safeguarding efforts “must undoubtedly aim at eradicating situations that protect those who hide behind their positions to impose themselves on others in a perverse way,” the pope wrote in a message to participants in a safeguarding conference.\n\nIn the message, released March 12, he also said the church must try to understand why such people are “unable to relate to others in a healthy way.”\n\nThe papal message was sent to a three-day conference in Panama City organized by the Research and Formation Center for the Protection of Minors, also known as CEPROME Latin America.\n\nTitled “Vulnerability and Abuse: Toward a Wider View of Prevention,” the conference was designed to discuss “the handling of power and authority in the church” and to broaden conversations about abusive conduct beyond the crime of sexual abuse to include “abuses of power, authority, conscience and spirituality,” organizers said.\n\nThe Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which was one of the groups involved in organizing the conference, had announced March 8 the approval of a study group “to examine the reality of vulnerable persons in the context of the Church’s ministry and how this informs safeguarding efforts.”\n\nIn his message to the participants in Panama City, Pope Francis wrote that God is calling the church to “an absolute change in mentality regarding our conception of relationships,” and that Christians must give priority to “the least, the poor, the servant (and) the uneducated over the greater, the rich, the master, the learned, based on the ability to accept the grace that is given to us by God and to make ourselves a gift to others.”\n\n“Seeing one’s own weakness as an excuse to stop being whole persons and whole Christians, incapable of taking control of their destiny, will create childish, resentful people and in no way represents the littleness to which Jesus invites us,” he wrote. Instead, the pope urged the participants to imitate St. Paul who “boasted in his weaknesses and trusted in the grace of the Lord.”\n\nYet Pope Francis wrote that the church “cannot be indifferent to the reasons why some people accept to go against their own conscience, out of fear, or allow themselves to be deceived by false promises, knowing in their heart of hearts that they are on the wrong path.”\n\n“Humanizing relationships” in society and the church, he wrote, “means working hard to form mature, coherent persons who, firm in their faith and ethical principles, are capable of confronting evil (and) bearing witness to the truth.”\n\nHe added that any society that lacks such moral integrity will be “ill, with human and institutional relationships perverted by selfishness, distrust, fear and deceit.”\n\nMore than 20 members of CEPROME’s advisory board from throughout Latin America met with Pope Francis at the Vatican in September 2023. They discussed methods for advancing abuse prevention and the pope condemned the accessibility of child pornography.\n\n(OSV News) – A profound experience with the Eucharist during Mass in his freshman year at Texas A&M University compelled Charlie McCullough to make Jesus the center of his life.\n\n“Every decision that I’ve made after that has been a small step in that relationship and a small response to that invitation,” said McCullough, a 22-year-old north Texas native. “And now the invitation is him saying, ‘Come and follow me,’ as we go on pilgrimage across the United States.”\n\nMcCullough is one of 24 young adults who will be journeying with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament along four National Eucharistic Pilgrimage routes leading to the National Eucharistic Congress. The “perpetual pilgrims” will begin their treks May 17-19 — the weekend of Pentecost — from San Francisco; New Haven, Connecticut; Brownsville, Texas; and the headwaters of the Mississippi River at Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota.\n\nTheir routes — a combined 6,500 miles — will converge eight weeks later in Indianapolis for the July 17 opening of the five-day congress in Lucas Oil Stadium. Along the way, the pilgrims will go through small towns, large cities and rural countryside, mostly on foot, with the Eucharist carried in a monstrance designed particularly for this unprecedented event.\n\n“This will be the biggest Eucharistic procession in world history,” said Kai Weiss, a perpetual pilgrim studying theology at the Pontifical Faculty of the Immaculate Conception at the Dominican House of Studies in Washington. “I think Jesus will sanctify this land in an unimaginable way, even invisibly and in an unseen way. But obviously, we will be visible and we will be easily noticed, and I just look forward to what Christ in the Eucharist can bring to other people.”\n\nWeiss, 27, grew up in Regensburg, Germany, where elaborate Corpus Christi processions are commonplace, and people are familiar with Europe’s long history of walking pilgrimages, he said. Last year, he participated in a two-day walking pilgrimage to the Marian shrine of Our Lady of Altötting with about 4,000 people, where pilgrims sang hymns and prayed the rosary along the way.\n\n“That really communal aspect is so beautiful about professions and pilgrimages — that they bring us together as a church, and that since they’re also public, they can also bring in other people,” Weiss said. “It’s a wonderful way of expressing our faith and our joy.”\n\nThe National Eucharistic Pilgrimage and National Eucharistic Congress are major parts of the National Eucharistic Revival, a three-year initiative launched in 2022 by the U.S. bishops to inspire a deeper love and reverence for Jesus in the Eucharist. The pilgrimage is modeled on the Gospel account of Jesus’ journey with two disciples to Emmaus after his resurrection.\n\nIn October, the National Eucharistic Congress issued a call for perpetual pilgrims and received more than 100 applications. Criteria included being a baptized and practicing Catholic between the ages of 19-29, be in good physical condition and capable of walking long distances, and be committed to upholding church teachings. Backgrounds in ministry, service, leadership and pilgrimage experience were of special interest, according to organizers.\n\nThe perpetual pilgrims were chosen after multiple rounds of interviews and follow-up screenings, organizers said in a March 11 media release announcing the pilgrims.\n\nIn February, the pilgrims met for a retreat in St. Paul, Minnesota, where they received spiritual formation from Bishop Andrew H. Cozzens of Crookston, Minnesota, who serves as chairman of the National Eucharistic Revival, as well as National Eucharistic Congress staff and priests with pilgrimage and media experience.\n\nMost of the pilgrims are graduate or undergraduate students, and some work for mission-oriented apostolates and nonprofits. “A common thread for all was a profound encounter with Jesus in the Eucharist that they were inspired to share with others,” according to the media statement.\n\nOrganized by Modern Catholic Pilgrim, a Minnesota-based nonprofit that promotes U.S. walking pilgrimages and biblical hospitality, the pilgrimage routes include stops at sacred landmarks including saints’ shrines and diocesan cathedrals.\n\n“I am humbled by the commitment demonstrated by those selected to serve as Perpetual Pilgrims this summer,” said Will Peterson, Modern Catholic Pilgrim’s founder and president, in a media statement. “Their excitement at serving as stewards of this unprecedented National Eucharistic Pilgrimage shook the walls at our kickoff retreat. I cannot wait for the rest of the U.S. Catholic Church to walk with our Eucharistic Lord alongside these amazing individuals.”\n\nEach day will include Mass, a small Eucharistic procession and 10-15 miles of travel. Along the way, parishes are planning to host Eucharistic devotions such as adoration, praise and worship, and lectures. Parishes, religious orders, schools, shrines and retreat centers will offer the pilgrims hospitality and offer fellowship and meals.\n\nA support vehicle will accompany the pilgrims and transport them through legs of the journey where “safety, terrain, and/or climate may present obstacles,” according to the media statement.\n\nThe pilgrimage routes are named for key saints for North America: the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Route from the east, the St. Juan Diego Route from the south, the St. Junipero Serra Route from the west, and the Marian Route from the north, which includes a stop in Wisconsin at the Shrine of Our Lady of Champion, the only approved Marian apparition site in the United States.\n\nWeiss is traveling the Marian Route with fellow perpetual pilgrims Sarah Cahill of Virginia; Matthew Heidenreich of Ohio; Danielle Schmitz of California; Jennifer Torres of Colorado; and Megan Zaleski of Illinois.\n\nWith McCullough on the Juan Diego route will be Camille Anigbogu of Texas; Shayla Elm of North Dakota; Issy Martin-Dye of Ohio; Joshua Velasquez of Texas; and MacKenzie Warrens of Missouri.\n\nOn the Serra route will be Chima Adiole of Texas; Chas Firestone East of Virginia; Patrick Fayad of Nebraska; Jack Krebs of Wisconsin; Madison Michel of Minnesota; and Jaella Mac Au of Georgia.\n\nOn the Seton route will be Dominic Carstens of Wyoming; Zoe Dongas of New York; Marina Frattaroli of Texas; Natalie Garza of Texas; Amayrani Higueldo of Pennsylvania; and Christopher Onyiuke of Florida.\n\nAlong the way, 30 Franciscan Friars of the Renewal will rotate time on the routes as chaplains. In addition, Father Roger Landry, a chaplain at Columbia University in New York, plans to accompany pilgrims the entire length of the Seton route.\n\nHigueldo, a recent nursing school graduate, told OSV News she is thrilled to be among the perpetual pilgrims. “Through nursing school, I had no time whatsoever,” she said. “My prayer to the Lord was like, ‘Lord, I just want to spend more time with you’ … and lo and behold, here we are a couple months later, and I get to spend two whole months with our Eucharistic Lord, and to go on this crazy adventure, beautiful adventure.”\n\nWhile she is grateful for what the opportunity will mean for her own life and relationship with Jesus, she is also excited for what it will bring to people they encounter along the way, including those who have questions about the Eucharist or react negatively to the pilgrimage. She is getting ready by reading Scripture, prayer and daily Mass, to “let him (Jesus) work in me and prepare me,” she said. “Because really I don’t know what it’s going to be like until we get there.”\n\nLike her fellow perpetual pilgrims, Higueldo, 26, is also investing in good footwear and increasing the length of her daily walks. She’s noticing the difference it makes in her body.\n\n“My calves are definitely hurting,” she said.\n\nWhile she expects to carry a light load, she won’t leave behind her journal, she said, “just being able to be a witness to all the graces that the Lord wants to pour out during this pilgrimage and be able to document those and just fall back on those.”\n\nAs McCullough thinks about the people the pilgrims will meet along the way, he reflects on the way Jesus encountered people in the Gospels.\n\n“It was always unique and different because he met them where they were at,” said McCullough, a college senior studying mechanical engineering. “I’m just so excited for the look of love from the Eucharist to be extended time and time again to whoever we encounter.”\n\nWeiss said he thinks the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage could be a unifying balm in a polarized country.\n\n“It’s him (Jesus) who brings us all together; he desires and yearns for all of us,” he said.\n\nPHILADELPHIA (OSV News) – Three Philadelphia priests have been made auxiliary bishops of their archdiocese, providing “a great sign of hope and of joy” as they “walk in the midst of the people” on the journey to eternal life in Jesus Christ, said their archbishop.\n\nBishop Keith J. Chylinski, Bishop Christopher R. Cooke and Bishop Efren V. Esmilla were ordained as auxiliary bishops by Archbishop Nelson J. Pérez of Philadelphia during a March 7 Mass at that city’s Cathedral Basilica of Ss. Peter and Paul. Bishop Michael F. Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia, and Auxiliary Bishop John J. McIntyre of Philadelphia served as concelebrants and co-ordaining bishops.\n\nPope Francis named the three auxiliaries Dec. 8, 2023, and their appointments were shared at a news conference hosted by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia that day.\n\nJoining Archbishop Pérez at the liturgy were Cardinal Christophe Pierre, apostolic nuncio to the U.S., and the permanent synod of bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church led by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk. The permanent synod members’ visit marks the first official travel to the U.S. by a Ukrainian Catholic delegation since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe permanent synod’s presence at the ordination reflected the close collaboration between the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia in prayer and support for Ukraine. Major Archbishop Shevchuk presented to Archbishop Pérez — who described Ukraine’s sufferings as “redemptive for the world” — a framed fragment of a drone that had targeted his residence in Kyiv, Ukraine, with Metropolitan Archbishop Borys A. Gudziak of the Archeparchy of Philadelphia asking Archbishop Pérez to receive it “as a sign of our passion, which you have shared.”\n\nIn addition, Major Archbishop Shevchuk presented Archbishop Pérez with a traditional Ukrainian Easter egg, decorated in the pysanky style, as a sign of “this paschal experience” and as the “sign of Resurrection.”\n\nAddressing the new bishops, Archbishop Pérez said, “Now you know what it’s like as my brother bishops to receive a call from ‘you know who’ (Cardinal Pierre) asking if you’re alone … and in the name of the Holy Father … (asking) you to become a bishop.\n\n“Thankfully, you all said yes,” said the archbishop. “Very joyfully you have accepted.”\n\nThe liturgy spanned more than three hours and drew hundreds of clergy, religious, seminarians, family and friends to the cathedral and featured multiple choirs, whose members performed in Latin, English, Spanish and Tagalog.\n\nDuring the ordination rite, the bishops-designate were presented to the archbishop, and promised to “proclaim the Gospel of Christ faithfully and unfailingly,” to “guard the deposit of faith” and to “build up the body of Christ, his church” under the authority of, and in obedience to, the pope.\n\nIn addition, the bishops-designate pledged to encourage and guide the “holy people of God” as “a devoted father … to reach out in kindness and mercy to the poor, to strangers and to all those in need … to seek out the sheep who stray and gather them into the Lord’s fold … to pray without ceasing to almighty God for his holy people and to carry out the office of high priest without reproach.”\n\nFollowing a litany of supplication, the archbishop laid his hands on the kneeling bishops-designate, as did the co-ordaining bishops and the other bishops present. As the Book of the Gospels was placed over the head of each bishop-designate, Archbishop Pérez prayed the prayer of ordination, conferring the sacrament of episcopal holy orders, which included anointing with sacred chrism, handing on the Book of the Gospels, and bestowing the episcopal insignia — the ring (worn on the right hand), the miter and the crosier or pastoral staff.\n\nEach bishop also was appointed to a titular see, a diocese (often ancient) that has ceased to function, but the assignment of which enables the auxiliary bishop to fulfill the canonical norm of leading a specific diocese. Bishops Chylinski, Cooke and Esmilla were respectively named to the titular sees of Gunela (formerly in what is now Tunisia), Malliana (now Algeria) and Ottana (a former Sardinian diocese restored as a titular see in 2004)\n\nCardinal Pierre, who had most recently held the titular see of Gunela, told Bishop Chylinski to take care of his former territory, saying it was a “very good” one.\n\nArchbishop Pérez said that “the bishop at times walks in front of his people leading” while at other times he “walks behind the people, pushing them.”\n\n“Most of the time, the bishop is called to be in the midst of his people,” said Archbishop Pérez.\n\nThe three new bishops already have significant pastoral experience.\n\nBishop Chylinski currently serves as rector of St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. After his 2007 priestly ordination, he served at several parishes throughout the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. In addition, he has directed counseling services at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary and has been a member of the archdiocese’s racial healing commission since its formation in 2021. From 2018 to 2022, he was the national chaplain of the Catholic Psychotherapy Association, which he joined in 2013.\n\nBishop Cooke is currently dean of men for the theology seminary at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary. Ordained a priest in 2006, he has served at several parishes in the archdiocese. From 2013 to 2021, he directed the spiritual year of formation at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary. Fluent in English and Spanish, he is a member of the archdiocesan council of priests.\n\nBorn in the Philippines, Bishop Esmilla was ordained to the priesthood in 1993. Among a range of pastoral assignments throughout the Philadelphia Archdiocese, he has served as chaplain of the Filipino apostolate since 2005, and as spiritual director of the Legion of Mary since 2001. He has served as pastor of two parishes since 2020, as well as a number of archdiocesan governance positions, and speaks English, Spanish, Tagalog, Latin and Portuguese.\n\nIn their post-ordination remarks, all three bishops expressed their profound gratitude and humility regarding their episcopal elevation.\n\n“I’ve received such a great outpouring of love and support from so many in the church, (and) it has struck me very powerfully how the church is truly a family,” Bishop Chylinski said, adding, “It’s Jesus — that’s what this is all about. That’s why we’re here today.”\n\n“Today did not happen because of my own efforts. I’m here because of the power of prayer. So many of you lifted me up for many, many years,” Bishop Cooke said. “I know I still have a lot to learn, and I am committed to being the best auxiliary bishop I can with both my gifts and my faith.”\n\n“My ordination today … started from love — love of Christ, love of Mary, love of faith, love of my family and friends,” Bishop Esmilla said. “It starts with love, continues in compassion, and endures with trust.”\n\nVATICAN CITY (CNS) – Pope Francis plans to launch a humanitarian project in Gaza or the West Bank with the possible help of the traditional Good Friday collection for the Holy Land, said the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches.\n\n“The outbreak of the war in Gaza, after the events of October 7, paralyzed the Holy Land. The lack of pilgrims and tourists has put thousands of families in difficulty,” the dicastery said in its annual appeal to bishops around the world asking them to urge their people to generously support this year’s collection.\n\n“The Holy Father intends to carry out a project with humanitarian purposes in Gaza or the West Bank, which can help the population resume a more dignified life and create job opportunities once the war is over,” said the appeal published March 8. “This project could be realized with the offerings of the faithful from all over the world who participate in the collection for the Holy Land.”\n\nThe “Pro Terra Sancta” collection is the main source of material support for Christians and the faith in the Holy Land, it said, and it is a way “for the universal Church to express solidarity with the ecclesial communities of the Middle East.”\n\nThe collection “is not merely a pious tradition for a few,” wrote Cardinal Claudio Gugerotti, prefect of the dicastery, and Maronite Father Michel Jalakh, secretary, who was named an archbishop by Pope Francis March 8.\n\n“Everywhere in the Catholic Church, the faithful have an obligation to offer their contribution,” they wrote, “because, apart from the custody of the holy places that saw Jesus, there are still Christians living and operating in the Holy Land, amid many tragedies and difficulties often caused by the selfishness of the powerful of the world.”\n\nHowever, they wrote, “many of them cannot take it anymore,” and they are leaving everything behind to flee “because they see no hope. And ravenous wolves divide their spoils.”\n\n“I address you so that their cry does not go unheard and that the Holy Father can support the local churches in finding new ways, opportunities for housing, work and educational and professional training, so that they may remain and not get lost in the West,” they wrote.\n\nThe Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land, an administratively autonomous province of the Franciscan order, customarily receives 65% of the funds collected to preserve sacred places connected with the life of Jesus and to support Christians through its many pastoral, educational, welfare, health and social facilities throughout the Middles East, the dicastery said in a statement March 8.\n\nThe remaining 35% of the collection goes to the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches to fund seminaries, advanced education for priests and nuns, Catholic schools, including Bethlehem University, cultural formation and for subsidies to support the churches under its jurisdiction in the Middle East. The territories that benefit from the collection are Jerusalem, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Turkey, Iran and Iraq.\n\nRecent subsidies drawn from the collection have been used to support those affected by the devastating earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria in early 2023, the dicastery said.\n\nWith the war in Gaza, “the dicastery is following the development of the situation, demonstrating its closeness through the apostolic delegation in Jerusalem, the Latin Patriarchate and the Custody of the Holy Land,” it said, adding that it hopes to use funds from this year’s collection to help Pope Francis carry out a humanitarian project in Gaza or the West Bank.\n\nTogether with the cardinal’s appeal, the Vatican published a report from the dicastery and a summary report by the Franciscan Custody detailing how they distributed the more than 6.5 million euro ($7.1 million) collected in 2023.\n\nThe Franciscan Custody’s report was divided into categories of funds used for pilgrim facilities, for benefiting the local community, for assisting refugees, for providing emergency and development aid, and for helping pay the salaries of employees.\n\nThe worsened war between Palestine and Israel, it said, “has brought a sudden cancellation of all pilgrimages” and the closure of all check-points has made it impossible for workers from the West Bank to enter Jerusalem.\n\nThe custody “has continued to provide equally for the payment of wages” for workers from the West Bank who are no longer able to get into Jerusalem, it said, and it is giving priority to employing workers where it can in the West Bank “in order to offer work opportunities for Christians hailing from a territory that does not benefit from a welfare system or from social security.”\n\nWASHINGTON (OSV News) – The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs finalized March 6 its interim policy permitting abortion at VA hospitals and clinics when there is risk to the mother’s life or in cases of rape or incest.\n\nThe final rule, published in the Federal Register, which also permits abortion counseling and procedures at VA facilities regardless of state restrictions, was criticized by Catholic leaders, including Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio of the U.S. Archdiocese for the Military Services.\n\nThe White House said that when “working within the scope of their federal employment,” VA health care workers “may provide abortion services as authorized by federal law regardless of state restrictions.”\n\nSupporters of the provision argued female service members may be assigned to states that have restricted abortion, and that their access should be protected in difficult circumstances. Opponents argued the department exceeded its authority.\n\nIn a March 7 statement, Archbishop Broglio said the VA “has finalized an interim rule that permits abortion counseling and abortive procedures in VA Medical Centers through all nine months of pregnancy.”\n\n“The notion that killing an unborn child can somehow be considered ‘medical or surgical care’ certainly violates the dignity of the human person and suggests that some lives are more important than others,” he said. “I deplore this decision that once more removes the right to life for the defenseless and inflicts untold physical and psychological trauma on mothers.”\n\nThe Catholic Church opposes abortion, outlining its teaching in the Catechism of the Catholic Church that human life “must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception.” Because abortion takes the life of an already conceived child, it is “gravely contrary to the moral law,” the catechism says.\n\nThe Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, which are used by Catholic medical providers, reflect that teaching; that document, while forbidding direct abortions, also permits procedures where the “direct purpose” is to save the mother’s life and “cannot be safely postponed until the unborn child is viable, even if they will result in the death of the unborn child.”\n\nAbortion supporters applauded the VA rule’s finalization. Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said in a statement, “Access to abortion is necessary for the health and safety of veterans – and for all people – to determine their futures.”\n\n“We’re thrilled that VA has taken this critical action for veterans seeking abortion care and counseling,” she said. “At a time when extremists are cruelly attacking reproductive rights across the nation, safeguarding access to abortion care for veterans and their loved ones is paramount. Our policymakers should be protecting our rights, not trying to strip them away.”\n\nBut Archbishop Broglio noted the U.S. Catholic bishops “raised multiple objections” to the rule, arguing it violates “section 106 of Veterans Health Care Act” which “specifically limits abortion.”\n\n“The VA’s decision is at odds with the notion that the military protects the innocent,” he added. “Now, the Department which was established to care for Veterans of the United States Armed Forces through service-related disabilities and retirement, affirms its decision to join what Pope Francis called ‘hit men’ — those who choose ‘to do away with a human life to solve a problem.'”\n\nHe added, “It is expected that the Department of Veterans Affairs will at least respect the conscience rights of medical personnel, staff, and other employees and permit them to abstain from any involvement in immoral procedures.”\n\nThe VA reported that it received 57,901 comments on the rule during a 30-day window for the public to submit them, both in support and opposition.\n\nThe rule is scheduled to go into effect April 3, 2024.\n\nVATICAN CITY (CNS) – The Catholic Church and the world itself need the gifts and contributions of women, especially in bringing people together and overcoming tensions and violence, Pope Francis wrote.\n\n“Ours is a time seared by hatred, in which our human family, which needs to feel the power of love, is instead frequently scarred by violence, war and ideologies that stifle the noblest feelings of the human heart,” he wrote. “Precisely in this context, the contribution of women is more necessary than ever.”\n\nPope Francis prepared his text for an audience with people participating in a March 7-8 conference, “Women in the Church: Builders of Humanity.” While the pope met participants in the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican March 7, he had an aide read his speech.\n\nThe conference, hosted by Rome’s Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, was sponsored by several pontifical universities and coincided with the celebration March 8 of International Women’s Day.\n\nUsing the example of 10 holy women — most, but not all, canonized saints — conference speakers looked at how Catholic women have contributed to the church and society through their groundbreaking work in education, spirituality and the promotion of peace or dialogue. The examples included: Sts. Elizabeth Ann Seton, Kateri Tekakwitha and Teresa of Kolkata.\n\nIn different times and places and “each in her own distinct way,” the 10 women “gave proof through initiatives of charity, education and prayer, of how the ‘feminine genius’ can uniquely reflect God’s holiness in the midst of our world,” the pope’s text said.\n\nAnd “because the Church is herself a woman – a daughter, a bride and a mother,” he wrote, “who better than women can reveal her face?”\n\nPope Francis asked that Catholics put aside “any aggressive and divisive attitudes” and that they exercise “careful discernment to discover, in docility to the voice of the Spirit and in faithful communion, fitting ways for the grandeur and the place of women to be increasingly valued in the People of God.”\n\nAn important aspect of the vocation of women, he wrote, is to be the “builders” the conference title referenced. Being a builder is “cooperating with the Creator in the service of life, the common good and peace.”\n\nWomen “know how to bring people together with tenderness,” the pope wrote. “With their unique capacity for compassion, their intuitiveness and their connatural inclination to ‘care,’ (they) are able, in an outstanding way, to be for society both intelligence and a heart that loves and unites, to bring love where love is lacking, and humanity where human beings are searching to find their true identity.”\n\nPope Francis also used his text to thank the pontifical universities for holding up to their students the lives and works of the 10 women saints and he asked them and all Catholic universities to make “every effort to present students with testimonies of holiness, especially of feminine sanctity,” that can inspire them.\n\nSCRANTON – In an effort to sustain and nurture its spiritual, educational, and service ministries, the Diocese of Scranton today proudly announces the creation of the Catholic Foundation for the Diocese of Scranton.\n\nThe Catholic Foundation for the Diocese of Scranton will provide a trusted way for individuals to provide meaningful and lasting impact to sustain Diocesan parishes, schools, and agencies for years to come. Donors may contribute cash donations, estate gifts, IRA contributions, and gifts into endowment funds that will provide long-term support for the work of the Church in our 11-county Diocese.\n\nUnlike the Diocesan Annual Appeal that is used immediately to support the annual needs of our Diocesan ministries, the Catholic Foundation will offer everlasting support for Diocesan ministries, parishes and schools through the development and growth of endowment funds.\n\nEndowment funds in the Catholic Foundation will be invested to earn revenue to fund Diocesan ministries. The principal value of an endowment fund is kept intact, while the investment earnings are distributed for charitable purposes as determined by donors.\n\nAbiding by Christian principles and a high ethical standard, the Foundation will invest in accordance with Catholic teachings using a morally responsible investment policy.\n\n“Foundations have become the preferred giving mechanism for many people who appreciate the transparent and professional way that resources are managed,” the Most Reverend Joseph C. Bambera, Bishop of Scranton, said. “The formation of the Catholic Foundation for the Diocese of Scranton represents a significant milestone in ensuring our local Church remains a compassionate and caring leader in service to our brothers and sisters in Christ.”\n\nThe Catholic Foundation operates in support of the Diocese and is managed by a Board of Directors, with its members consisting of Catholics throughout the Diocese from all walks of life and reflecting many professional fields of expertise. The Board of Directors will meet quarterly.\n\nThe day-to-day management of the Foundation will be led by the Executive Director. Bishop Bambera is announcing today that James Bebla will serve as the first Executive Director of the Catholic Foundation for the Diocese of Scranton. Bebla has served as Diocesan Secretary for Development for the past ten years.\n\n“I am honored to be appointed by Bishop Bambera to this new role as Executive Director of the Catholic Foundation. The vision of the Bishop, the wonderful generosity of our donors, and the dedicated commitment of our Board of Directors will serve as the foundation of this transformational effort in support of our Diocesan ministries, parishes, schools, kitchens, shelters, and food pantries,” Bebla said.\n\nThe individuals invited by Bishop Bambera to serve on the first Board of Directors each bring exemplary leadership, wisdom, and dedication, with a vision that extends far beyond the charitable needs of the current moment.

I find that our Diocese is alive with many ministries and educational opportunities, and the efforts of the Foundation to continue to grow the financial resources to sustain these activities is critically important,” Ralph Meyer explained. “I’m pleased that our Diocesan leadership has had the vision to create this Foundation in our Diocese.”\n\n“I am excited to serve the new Catholic Foundation because it will give people an opportunity to support our Catholic faith in action – not just today – but forever,” Nancy Marr added. “While the establishment of an endowment is a monumental task, it is historic! The Foundation will support the people of our Diocese for generations to come. I can’t think of a better way to help make a difference.”\n\nBishop Bambera and the Foundation Board of Directors invite everyone within the Diocese of Scranton to consider participating in the spirit of charitable giving and realize the joy of helping others. Gifts of any size are welcome, and indeed, essential to the Foundation’s mission.\n\nIndividuals can make a gift to the Foundation at any time. Gifts can be designated to several endowed funds that have been established or can be given to the Foundation to be used where needed most. There are endowment funds for seminarian formation, care of retired priests, Catholic Schools, Catholic Social Services, faith formation and historic preservation.\n\nThe Foundation also welcomes the opportunity to meet with donors to design a gift that will suit their personal needs or charitable goals. By investing with the Catholic Foundation for the Diocese of Scranton, gifts will be managed by professionals who have knowledge and experience to ensure that funds are used only for the purposes intended.\n\nThe Foundation serves Diocesan Catholic missions and ministries located in the following Pennsylvania counties: Bradford, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lycoming, Monroe, Pike, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, Wayne, and Wyoming.\n\nFor more information on the Catholic Foundation for the Diocese of Scranton, visit catholicfoundationscranton.org or contact James Bebla, Executive Director, at (570) 207-2212 or jbebla@catholicfoundationscranton.org."
