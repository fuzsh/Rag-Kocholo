        "text": "The policy of the schools of the Diocese of Victoria is not to discriminate, on the basis of sex, race, color, age, national or ethnic origin, or disabling condition, in educational programs, activities, or services. This extends to employment in, and admission to, such programs, activities, and services.\n\nSince we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them: if prophecy, in proportion to the faith; if ministry, in ministering; if one is a teacher, in teaching; if one exhorts, in exhortation; if one contributes, in generosity; if one is over others, with diligence; if one does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness. Romans 12: 6-8\n\nBishop Brendan Cahill, S.T.D. of the Diocese of Victoria encourages the students of our Catholic schools with his humble devotion to Jesus Christ. He walks with and behind our children showing them love, joy and laughter, and a genuine pride in our Catholic faith.\n\nOur students are always excited to host a visit with Bishop Brendan filled with stories of his youth, fun anecdotes about life, and lots of blessings and prayers! Thank you to our bishop for his dedication to our schools."
