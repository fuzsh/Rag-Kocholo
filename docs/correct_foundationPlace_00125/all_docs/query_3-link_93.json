        "text": "A Statement of the U.S. Catholic Bishops\n\nissued 2001\n\nForeword\n\nWe recognize the jubilee time of the new millennium as a special opportunity for conversion and spiritual renewal for the Church in general, and for our priests in particular. With that in mind, we offer this Basic Plan for the Ongoing Formation of Priests. We hope that this ratio fundamentalis or basic plan will provide an impetus for ongoing formation and a catalyst for program development.\n\nThis document seeks to complement the directions set out in the apostolic exhortation I Will Give You Shepherds (Pastores Dabo Vobis) (PDV) of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, and in The Directory on the Ministry and Life of Priests (DMLP) developed by the Congregation for the Clergy. This Basic Plan for the Ongoing Formation of Priests can complement and follow up the Program of Priestly Formation currently in use in the United States.\n\nWe propose this document for the ongoing formation for priests as a guide for the next ten years. We are mindful that the majority of those who will make up our presbyterates in the next ten years are already priests, and thus, will benefit from the directions in this document.\n\nWe recognize the special and unique formational needs of members of religious congregations. This document is aimed more specifically to members of diocesan presbyterates. We invite those responsible for the ongoing formation of members of religious congregations to study this document and to make useful applications where possible. We hope that the episcopal conference will periodically renew this plan.\n\nWe are grateful to many people for their work in developing this document. I would like to express our thanks to the members of the Priestly Life and Ministry Committee who have spent many hours in reviewing this work. They are as follows: Bishop Francis J. Christian, Bishop John R. Gaydos, Bishop George H. Niederauer, Bishop William S. Skylstad, Bishop Arthur Tafoya, and Bishop Paul A. Zipfel. Consultants to the committee are the following: Very Rev. Frederick P. Annie, Rev. Msgr. Timothy Dyer, Very Rev. Robert F. Guay, Rev. William D. Hammer, Rev. Charles Latus, Rev. Frank Reale, SJ, Rev. Kevin J. Spiess, Rev. Francis Tebbe, OFM, and Rev. Donald Wolf. I would like to thank the other readers and members of the National Organization for the Continuing Education of Roman Catholic Clergy (NOCERCC) for their participation in our consultations. I wish also to extend special thanks to Bishop George Niederauer and the members of the writing committee for the document. These members are Rev. Louis Cameli, Very Rev. Frederick P. Annie, Very Rev. John Canary, Rev. Noah Casey, OSB, Rev. Clete Kiley, Ms. Mary Ann Pobicki, Rev. Stephen Rossetti, Rev. Francis Tebbe, OFM, Rev. Edward Upton, Rev. Raymond Webb, and Rev. Donald Wolf. I want to acknowledge the particular work of Rev. Louis Cameli who has served as the principal writer and as the general editor of the document. I want to thank Rev. Clete Kiley, the executive director of the Secretariat for Priestly Life and Ministry, for developing this project and keeping it on track. Finally, I want to express our gratitude to the Raskob Foundation for a generous grant that has made this project possible.\n\nIt is our hope that this document will be studied by bishops, priests, and seminarians throughout the United States. We call upon individual presbyterates, through their priests' councils, to give special attention to the implementation of the principles contained here. We also call upon national organizations, such as NOCERCC, and the various centers for ongoing formation throughout the country to develop programs, conferences, retreats, symposia, and convocations that carry the principles outlined here forward to implementation. For our part, we as bishops commit ourselves anew to this important work of ongoing formation.\n\nMost Rev. Richard Hanifen\n\nBishop of Colorado Springs\n\nChairman, Bishops' Committee\n\nfor Priestly Life and Ministry\n\nThe Commitment of the Bishops of the United States to the Ongoing Formation of Priests\n\nWe, the bishops of the United States, have heard the words of our Holy Father Pope John Paul II: \"The entire particular Church has the responsibility, under the guidance of the Bishop, to develop and look after the different aspects of her priests' permanent formation\" (PDV, no. 78).\n\nWe understand, again in light of the Holy Father's words to us, that our responsibility for the ongoing formation of priests is rooted in our sacramental relationship with our respective presbyterates: \"The Bishop's responsibility is based on the fact that priests receive their priesthood from him and share his pastoral solicitude for the People of God. He is responsible for ongoing formation, the purpose of which is to ensure that all his priests are generously faithful to the gift and ministry received, that they are priests such as the People of God wishes to have and has a â€˜right' to\" (PDV, no. 79).\n\nIn obedient response to the Holy Father's express wishes, we commit ourselves to supplying the necessary personnel, time, and finances to make the ongoing formation of priests an effective reality in the life of our dioceses. We will do our best in our respective dioceses. We will also join forces regionally and nationally, when that kind of collective and collaborative effort and investment will better serve the purpose of ongoing formation for priests.\n\nWe commit ourselves to reminding our priests of the importance of ongoing formation. We will encourage them in their efforts, and we will call them to accountability in the name of the Church. Furthermore, we will support our priests by informing the entire people of God that the prayer and study of their priests is not something added on to their work but rather is integral to their ministry.\n\nFinally, we commit ourselves to participating in the process of ongoing formation. The Holy Father has said, \"The Bishop will live up to his responsibility, not only by seeing to it that his presbyterate has places and times for its ongoing formation, but also by being present in person and taking part in an interested and friendly way\" (PDV, no. 79).\n\nThrough the intercession of Mary, mother of priests and the great \"sign of certain hope and comfort to the pilgrim people of God\" (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church [Lumen Gentium] [LG], no. 68), we ask God's blessings on all our priests. May they grow in wisdom and grace and, through a new evangelization, draw all people to the Lord Jesus Christ in whose name and person they act and exist.\n\nPart One: The Basic Plan\n\nA. Introduction: A Document about Transformation and Formation\n\nNow the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. All of us, gazing with unveiled face on the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord who is the Spirit. (2 Cor 3:17-18)\n\nThe apostle Paul marvels at the work of the Holy Spirit who transforms believers into the very image of Jesus Christ, who himself is the image of God. This grace of the new covenant embraces all who have joined themselves to Jesus Christ in faith and baptism. Indeed, it is sheer grace, all God's doing. Moved by that grace, however, we make ourselves available to God's work of transformation. And that making ready a place for the Lord to dwell in us and transform us we call formation.\n\nThis document is the basic plan of ongoing formation for priests who count themselves among other believers but who also stand and serve in a unique way in the Church of Christ, conformed to Christ as his sacramental representatives in the presbyteral order. God invites them to transformation across their lifetime, and their formation is marked by constant elements at every stage of life. At the same time, there are specific formational challenges that emerge in particular seasons of their priestly ministry. Both the constant and the changing elements of formation are included in the basic plan.\n\nThere is a temptation to use a basic plan to establish an ideal type of priest, an unrealistic, unattainable, and therefore unhelpful goal. A more realistic aim is to identify the true formative points of human, intellectual, spiritual, and pastoral encounter that priests must face in their ministry and lives and that are the privileged places where God's transforming grace touches them.\n\nA basic plan of formation ought to be comprehensive, systematic, practical, and rooted in the Gospel. A comprehensive plan describes the wide range of priestly ministry and life, noting the possibilities of grace and the shadow dimensions of temptation and sin as well as the challenges and resources that are available. A systematic plan organizes the particular elements in ways that connect them together. It draws out practical implications, especially for program development. From the Gospel comes the light and fire of God's love.\n\nAt the beginning, it is important to identify the intended audience for a basic plan of priestly formation. Who belongs to this audience? In the first place, the audience includes bishops and presbyterates who want some guidance in the formation of a holy and effective presbyterate, and holy and effective priests. The audience will also include directors of ongoing formation and continuing education who can use this document to organize and review their efforts. Individual priests can also use a basic plan to name their experience and needs and, then, develop a personalized process of ongoing formation. Seminary formation directors and seminarians can use the plan in preparation for priestly ministry. Finally, a basic plan of priestly formation can be a help to the people of God as they seek to support and encourage their priests in their priestly service and spiritual journeys.\n\nIn the end, a basic plan of priestly formation ought to inspire and challenge priests to respond to the promptings of God's grace. This means to respond to priests' formational needs in a way that is timely, practical, and specific. In other words, it locates the priestly formation in the United States at the beginning of a new century.\n\nB. Introduction: The Organization of a Basic Plan of Priestly Formation\n\nThis plan of ongoing formation for priests in the United States includes two parts. The first treats ongoing formation in a \"synchronic\" way, noting that there are elements or dynamics of ongoing formation that are the same at every moment of priests' lives. In Pastores Dabo Vobis, Pope John Paul II notes, \"Permanent or ongoing formation, precisely because it is â€˜permanent,' should always be a part of the priest's life. In every phase and condition of his life, at every level of responsibility he has in the Church, he is undergoing formation\" (PDV, no. 76).\n\nThe second part of the plan proceeds \"diachronically\" or longitudinally, identifying the different formational tasks appropriate in the different ages and special moments of priestly ministry and life. Specific attention will be given to the newly ordained, priests in transition, priests entering their first pastorate, priests in midlife, and priests in the third age. A final section considers the formation of an entire presbyterate.\n\nBoth the synchronic and diachronic parts of the plan are inspired by and seek to be faithful to the documents of the Second Vatican Council, other significant church documentsâ€”especially Pastores Dabo Vobis: On the Formation of Priests in the Circumstances of the Present Day (1992), the Directory on the Ministry and Life of Priests (Congregation for the Clergy, 1994), The Church in America (Ecclesia in America): On the Encounter with the Living Jesus Christ: The Way to Conversion, Communion, and Solidarity in America (EA) (1999), and The Priest and the Third Christian Millennium: Teacher of the Word, Minister of the Sacraments, and Leader of the Community (Congregation for the Clergy, 1999)â€”as well as documents that have originated since the Council from the bishops of the United States, such as The Continuing Formation of Priests: Growing in Wisdom, Age, and Grace (National Conference of Catholic Bishops [NCCB], 1984). NOCERCC has also provided valuable documents with a specific emphasis on the American context, such as the Handbook for the Continuing Formation of Priests (1994). At the same time, this plan is not simply a repetition of what is contained in previous documents. Rather, it seeks to focus the many elements contained in previous documents and apply them to the situation of priests in the United States at the beginning of a new century.\n\nThis plan of ongoing formation assumes the documents mentioned above. It also assumes the process of initial formation as described in the Program of Priestly Formation (PPF) (NCCB, fourth edition, 1992), which is the authoritative standard established by the U.S. bishops for seminaries in this country. This basic plan for the ongoing formation of priests elaborates chapter six of the Program of Priestly Formation, \"The Continuing Formation of Priests\" (nos. 549-572).\n\nFinally, the basic plan of ongoing formation for priests assumes an authentic doctrinal understanding of the ministerial priesthood. At various points in the text, references and citations are provided that give indications of that doctrinal understanding, such as the doctrinal syntheses of Pope John Paul II found in Pastores Dabo Vobis. A more fully developed synthesis appears in the appendix to this document. There the reader can find a compact and clear doctrinal understanding of the ministerial priesthood as it appears in the Program of Priestly Formation, which represents the common doctrinal point of departure for both primary and ongoing formation.\n\nThe unifying thread for both parts of the plan is the grace and the task of integration, which fosters the living synthesis of priestly identity and priestly service. Integration is at the heart of ongoing formation, as priests grow in bringing together who they are and what they do. Their growth is really a growing integrity or connectedness of their ministry and their life. To use integration as a unifying focus of the plan simply follows the overall aim of Vatican II's Decree on the Ministry and Life of Priests (Presbyterorum Ordinis) (PO), which by the very deliberate phrasing of its title identified priestly ministry as shaping and giving rise to a new way of life. Similarly in Pastores Dabo Vobis, Pope John Paul II, speaking of the profound meaning of ongoing formation, affirms, \"Ongoing formation helps the priest to be and act as a priest in the spirit and style of Jesus the Good Shepherd\" (no. 73).\n\nC. General Description: Ongoing Formation as the Integration of Priestly Identity and the Tasks of Priestly Ministry for the Sake of Mission\n\nPrograms, resources, and practices do not constitute ongoing formation. They are necessary instruments but always in service to the larger purpose and direction of formation. It is tempting, however, in an American context with its stress on practicality to identify formation with programs. Thus, it is important from the onset to identify the essence of ongoing formation.\n\nFollowing the footsteps of Vatican II's Presbyterorum Ordinis and John Paul II's Pastores Dabo Vobis, we can define ongoing formation in this way: It is the continuing integration of priestly identity and functions or service for the sake of mission and communion with Christ and the Church. Each element of this definition bears careful examination.\n\nTo say that ongoing formation is \"continuing\" simply identifies it as a life-long task or process. That is why documents often speak of \"permanent\" formation. It truly is co-extensive with life itself. We never stop growing or being transformed.\n\nFor many, the word \"integration\" may be either vague or seem to reduce spirituality to psychological processes. In the context of ongoing formation, integration is quite specific and spiritual. It signals the movement toward a unity of life that draws together and dynamically relates who we are, what we do, and what we are about (our purpose or mission). As a movement toward a unity of life, the aim of integration is to find the unum necessarium, \"the one necessary thing,\" of the Gospel and to live centered in it.\n\n\"Priestly identity\" is something given sacramentally. It is also something consciously appropriated. In both dimensions, priestly identity shapes existence or the way of being in the world. It enables priests to say to themselves and to others who they are.\n\nThe \"functions\" of our lives are the tasks and operations that belong to us because of the responsibilities that have been given to us and that we have assumed. \"Priestly functions\" means the service that priests offer, the activities of their ministry.\n\nFinally, \"mission\" names the purpose and direction given to priests that shapes and orders their commitments and responsibilities. The mission of priests is directly linked to the mission of the Church, which in turn depends entirely on the mission of Jesus Christ.\n\nThis brief examination of the particular components of the definition of ongoing formation can help us understand its importance and meaning. To identify ongoing formation as the continuing integration of priestly identity and function for the sake of mission and communion set us in a holistic context that touches many aspects of priestly ministry and life, which we will consider shortly in greater detail. Before that, in order to fill out the picture of ongoing formation itself, it helps to note some of the qualities or characteristics of ongoing formation for priests.\n\nD. Essential Characteristics of Ongoing Formation\n\nOngoing formation follows the pattern of faith and God's action in its different dimensions. Ongoing formation is, first of all, personal. It belongs to individuals as their own responsibility to foster their own integration. At the same time, ongoing formation is ecclesial and social, and that is true in at least two ways. It unfolds in a context of the community of faith as well as the more defined community of the presbyterate with its bishop. Although formation has to do with an individual's growth, the community they serveâ€”the Churchâ€”benefits greatly from the growth of its priests.\n\nOngoing formation begins with and is sustained by commitments made by priests and by the Church they serve. Without a deliberate or intentional decision to engage the process and without the willingness to support it, ongoing formation cannot happen. This means that the proper resources of time, personnel, and finances must be allotted.\n\nFinally, although ongoing formation is essentially a process that unfolds in the ministry and life of priests, it does have a programmatic side. Planning, programs, various practices, and events serve as instruments, not to make formation happen, but to help it emerge in the course of ministry and life.\n\nThis preliminary sketch of ongoing formation allows us to examine the elements of identity, function/service, and mission in greater detail. Then, we can note the programs engaged by priests and supported by the Church that foster the process of integration of identity and function for the sake of mission.\n\nE. Priestly Identity: Who I Am\n\nIdentity is constituted by everything that shapes our existence or way of being in the world and enables us to say who we are. Priests have a complex identity, which corresponds to the way they exist in the world. If they only filled a specific religious role in society, their identity would be quite simple. In fact, priests exist in the world in three principal ways that are interrelated. Priests exist as human beings. They also exist as believing Christians or disciples of Jesus Christ in his Church. Finally, they exist in a unique sacramental mode, as part of the order of presbyters in the Church.\n\nThe complexity of priestly identity gives rise to the differentiated programmatic dimensions of formation, designed to address the human, intellectual, pastoral, and spiritual aspects of priestly existence and identity. Later, we will consider these programmatic responses to the complex identity of priests. First we need to explore more deeply the different dimensions of priestly identity.\n\nA Growing, Developing Human Being\n\nPriests are, first of all, human beings whose very humanity ought to be a bridge for communicating Jesus Christ to the world today (cf. PDV, no. 43). Their humanity reflects a complex make-up, the different dimensions of what it means to be human. Each dimension needs recognition and attention. Here we list the essential dimensions:\n\nPhysical: Priests are embodied persons, whose living and functioning depend on the health and full functioning of their bodies.\n\nPsychological: The humanity of priests is especially prominent in their psychological capacities, which are cognitive, affective, and value-directed. The cognitive capacity includes the ability to perceive or gather information, to understand, and to make judgments. The affective capacity includes the ability to feel and to connect with other human beings and the world through feeling. The value capacity includes the ability to cultivate attitudes that can direct commitments, actions, and patterns of behavior.\n\nSexual: The sexuality of priests links both physical and psychological life. Sexuality represents a passion, an energy, and a direction for connecting, belonging, and giving lifeâ€”in other words, for intimacy and generativity. Physical, psychological, and spiritual dimensions of life converge in human sexuality.\n\nCultural: Priests in the United States exist in a cultural or, more accurately, a multicultural context. Culture provides the social tools for understanding the world, for shaping and working in it, and finally, for expressing its realties. In other words, culture provides a framework for exploring the human understanding of the world and acting in itâ€”the stuff of science, technology, and the arts. In all of this, culture enables people to connect and collaborate with each other. Culture, however, is not only a tool that people use to shape the world, but the collective values and attitudes that shape people. It can be identified with the spirit of the age or the nation that continuously transmits cues for behavior, ideals to be pursued, and values to be cultivated. Culture, in this sense, can exercise a positive or negative influence in shaping life.\n\nSocial: Priests live in a social order. They come from families, generally connect with some form of community, and are part of a larger society. Within society, they have a socially defined role. With other citizens or members of society, they are participants in political life through which people seek to live together peacefully and to prosper.\n\nA Believer in and Disciple of Jesus Christ\n\nPriests are believing Christians and disciples of Jesus Christ. This is their grounding identity, the foundation upon which their specific sacramental presence and ministry in the Church as priests is built. First, they are baptized and profess their faith, and then they are sent to share in the apostolic mission.\n\nThe assumption is that they are not Christians or disciples merely in name. Rather, they have embarked on an intentional or deliberate spiritual journey. In this way, they are committed to a growing and transforming relationship with their Lord by the power of the Holy Spirit, a relationship marked by the following dynamics:\n\nGrowing Faith: A growing faith gives evidence of a growing relationship with a loving God and an insight into the revelation of God in Jesus Christ, accompanied by a greater practical wisdom of what that revelation means for living.\n\nGrowing Love: Progress in the spiritual life has always been identified with a growth in caritas, the love of God, and linked to that, the love of others. Growing love or caritas is manifested in a progressive attachment to Jesus Christ, a greater willingness to share in his paschal mystery, a more authentic worship of God in spirit and truth, and an expanding and deepening compassion for others.\n\nGrowing Hope: Hope in God enables us to trust in the promised future that God gives us. In the course of our earthly journey, growing hope is clear from the ever-more practical, direct, and generous ways that gospel values lead us to take action in the world to open a way for God's kingdom, God's future promise.\n\nSharing in the Presbyteral Order\n\nThrough the sacrament of holy orders, through priestly ordination, priests not only assume new responsibilities and functions in the Church and world, they exist differently in and for the Church and the world. This different existence that gives rise to a specific identity has its sacramental foundation in a new relationship with Jesus Christ, a relationship that is lived out in a presbyterate and that, in the Western church, has become intimately connected to consecrated celibacy.\n\nBeing Conformed to Christ: Through sacramental ordination priests are conformed to Jesus Christ, and this makes all the difference. In a single, compact paragraph in Pastores Dabo Vobis, John Paul II offers this synthesis:\n\nIn the Church and on behalf of the Church, priests are a sacramental representation of Jesus Christ, the Head and Shepherd, authoritatively proclaiming his Word, repeating his acts of forgiveness and his offer of salvation, particularly in Baptism, Penance and the Eucharist, showing his loving concern to the point of a total gift of self for the flock, which they gather into unity and lead to the Father through Christ and in the Spirit. In a word, priests exist and act in order to proclaim the Gospel to the world and to build up the Church in the name and person of Christ the Head and Shepherd.\" (PDV, no. 15)\n\nThe identity of priests is connected with their specific sacramental existence in relationship to Jesus Christ and the Church.\n\nIn a Presbyterate in Communion With its Bishop: The sacramental relationship with Jesus Christ and the Church is not the individual possession of \"the\" priest. Priests exist as priests in a presbyterate gathered with its bishop. They draw their priestly identity as well from this presbyteral existence. John Paul II expresses it in this way: \"By its very nature, the ordained ministry can be carried out only to the extent that the priest is united to Christ through sacramental participation in the priestly order, and thus to the extent that he is in hierarchical communion with his own Bishop. The ordained ministry has a radical â€˜' and can only be carried out as â€˜a collective work'\" (PDV, no. 17).\n\nIn a Life of Chaste Celibacy: In the Western church, priestly existence in relationship to Christ and to the Church has found expression in the discipline of chaste celibacy for her priests. Chaste celibacy is a way of being or existing as priest in relationship to Christ and the Church, and so it gives rise to a new identity. The christological and ecclesiological foundations for this practice (and implicitly the eschatological implications) are evident in this passage from Pastores Dabo Vobis: \"The Church, as the Spouse of Jesus Christ, wishes to be loved by the priest in the total and exclusive manner in which Jesus Christ her Head and Spouse loved her. Priestly celibacy, then, is the gift of self in and with Christ to his Church and expresses the priest's service to the Church in and with the Lord\" (no. 29).\n\nF. Priestly Service or Ministry: What I Do\n\nOngoing formation for priests is the continuing integration of identity and function for the sake of mission. There is a vital connection between who priests are in virtue of their specific identity and what they do ministerially. We have examined priestly existence, which is human, Christian, and specifically sacramental. Then, it is important to identify another element in the process of integrationâ€”service or ministry, what priests do.\n\nThese men-disciples-priests, who hold this complex identity, also minister to or serve the community. There are many activities connected with their service. Generally, the Church has grouped them together in three categories: the ministry of word, the ministry of sacrament or sanctification, and the ministry of being pastor to the community of faith. Most recently, the Congregation for the Clergy has identified these dimensions of priestly service in the particular context of the new Christian millennium and the call for a new evangelization (The Priest and the Third Christian Millennium: Teacher of the Word, Minister of the Sacraments, and Leader of the Community, 1999).\n\nMinistry of the Word\n\nProclamation of the word of God is the primum officium or first task and responsibility of priests. The Second Vatican Council says, \"For since nobody can be saved who has not first believed, it is the first task of priests as co-workers of the bishops to preach the Gospel of God to all\" (PO, no 4).\n\nThe ministry of proclamation assumes a number of different forms. For example, it can be differentiated by the setting in which it takes place and its particular scope or purpose within that setting. Preaching, teaching, and counseling can all be examples of ministry of the word or proclamation. They do, however, reflect different methods and purposes, even if the ultimate goal is the communication of God's word to people.\n\nAnother way that the ministry of the word is differentiated is by the nature of its content. For example, kerygmatic or evangelical preaching aims to communicate the basic good news of Jesus Christ and call to faith those who have not heard it. Catechesis, on the other hand, forms those who already believe by deepening and expanding their understanding of faith. Homiletic preaching, which belongs specifically to the ordained, occurs in the context of sacramental celebrations and lets God's word prompt people to enter the celebration of the sacred mysteries in their lives. Parenesis is moral exhortation, especially as people face difficult or complex sets of moral choices. Prophetic preaching addresses the social situation in light of the demands of God's word. These are some of the principal ways in which the ministry of the word or proclamation is carried out.\n\nMinistry of the Sacraments\n\nPriests celebrate and preside at the sacramental celebrations of the Church, preeminently the Eucharist. Furthermore, through the sacraments the faithful are able to participate in the transforming mysteries of Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. So, in celebrating and presiding at the sacraments, priests carry on a ministry of sanctification.\n\nIn addition to celebrating and presiding at sacramental celebrations, priests are also responsible for directing the sacramental life of the Church. The sacraments are not limited simply to specific ritual moments. The sacraments initiate and lead people into a new way of living. Priests encourage the whole Church to live the sacraments, whether in the generous self-sacrificing love prompted by the Eucharist, or in living out compassionate forgiveness as a consequence of the sacrament of reconciliation, or in giving oneself entirely in loving and life-giving ways in the sacrament of marriage.\n\nFinally, priests extend the sacramental celebration of the mysteries of Christ through their intercessory celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours for the sake of the whole body of Christ.\n\nGiving a Shepherd's Care to the Community of Faith\n\nPriests are conformed to Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd; they continue to care for the flock entrusted to them in various ways. Obviously, the initial formation of communities of faith and then sustaining them on their journey is a pastoral task of fundamental importance. At the same time, individual communities, especially parishes, do not stand alone. Priests need to stand for and nurture the bonds that link the local community with the diocese and the universal Church. At times, priests shepherd a community by encouraging and fostering its discernment of God's direction and, at appropriate times, by giving direction. For many American priests, the context of their pastoral work is a culture different than their native one, a situation that calls for great flexibility of spirit. In general, a shepherd's care for a community of faith means presiding over it, moderating it, and, when necessary, representing it.\n\nOngoing formation is the continuing integration of priests' identity and ministry for the sake of mission. We have noted the principal elements of identity and service or ministry. What remains is to consider the mission.\n\nG. Priestly Mission: For What Purpose\n\nThe purpose of priestly ministry, as church documents abundantly indicate, is to serve the Church. The Church exists in different ways as a parish, as a diocese, and as the universal Church. Ultimately, the Church itself continues the mission of Jesus Christ in the world. It does so as mystery, communion, and mission. The Church that priests serve is a mystery, a great sacrament of God's design for humanity, for ultimate unity in God. The Church is also communion. As communion, the Church is a sign of peace and an instrument of reconciliation in the world, even now a partial but real participation in the very life of the Trinity (cf. Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World [Gaudium et Spes] [GS], no. 24). Finally, the Church that priests serve is itself in mission. For it is an evangelized and evangelizing community that seeks to extend the mission, message, and person of Jesus Christ to the world.\n\nThe mission of the Church points beyond itself. It rests in Jesus Christ, and it looks to a future destiny. Priests serve the mission of the Church to the extent that they sustain and encourage the Church to stay on course in its mission and on its journey as the pilgrim people of God, until they arrive at their destination and consummation by sharing fully in the mystery of God. At that time, the mission will be completed, and the earthly Church will be completely transformed into the heavenly Church.\n\nH. The Context for Ongoing Formation for Priests: In the United States at the Beginning of the Twenty-First Century\n\nBefore considering practical implications of ongoing formation for priests by translating principles and values into programs, it is crucial to note the context of ongoing formation in the United States at the beginning of a new century. Context not only shapes programs and practical possibilities, it also tells us that the task of ongoing formation for priests is very urgent, that it requires immediate and significant attention. Context links ongoing formation with the larger life of the Church and the world.\n\nThere are at least ten significant contexts for the ongoing formation of priests. Each context invites much fuller development. For our purposes, it is enough to note the context and add a brief explanation.\n\nRealization of the Need for Ongoing Personal and Professional Development: As all sectors in society have paid more attention to the need for ongoing professional development, so, too, priests have taken advantage of a variety of opportunities to enhance such ongoing personal and professional formation. In some instances, a too narrow concept of priestly ordination as capping years of seminary preparation, rather than as a beginning of a life of ever-expanding priestly service, has impeded this necessary journey of growth.\n\nDivisions in Presbyterates: Presbyterates find themselves divided along a number of lines, such as age, theological perspectives, formational backgroundâ€”whether native-born or foreign-bornâ€”and ministerial focus. There is great urgency in developing presbyteral unity, something we will consider in greater detail later, because it belongs to the prayer of Jesus \"that they may all be one . . . that the world may believe\" (Jn 17:21). Presbyteral unity is instrumental in bringing faith to the world. Ongoing formation brings priests together not simply to rally around a common task but to proceed in faith with the mission of unity. Ongoing formation serves the unity of presbyterates especially by regrounding priests in their common faith vision and by offering them a common vocabulary of communication.\n\nDiminishing Numbers of Priests, More Complex Circumstances for Priestly Service: The lessened numbers of priests is a documented fact of life. That may change for the better or the worse. The fact remains that this is our reality now. It is not, however, simply a matter of fewer priests. It is also the fact of far more complicated circumstances in the Church in the United States. Complications stem in part from the happy circumstance of increasing numbers of Catholics. Some of that increase stems from immigration, especially of those who speak Spanish. Catholics in the United States have arrived in many ways. Some find themselves affluent, well educated, and comfortable. In large numbers, other Catholics are quite poor, marginalized, and even oppressed in our social structures. Some Catholics have great voice in the direction of this nation, while others are unheard. The combination of fewer numbers of priests with ever more complex circumstances of the Church in the United States presses the urgency of ongoing formation of priests. Formation can be a vehicle to understand and address the complexity and, at the same time, be a means to cultivate a necessary apostolic flexibility among priests.\n\nThe Counterpoint of Current Cultural Sexual Mores, Values, and the Commitments of Priests: There is a dramatic contrast between the current American cultural climate of sexuality and the standards and values of the Church, especially as these are embodied in priests' celibate commitment. In a previous age, priests might expect the culture not to understand their celibate commitment but to respect itâ€”perhaps, at times, even to admire it. Today the former social support for celibacy is gone. Highly publicized cases of priests' sexual misconduct have cast a shadow of incredibility on the professed values enshrined in the celibate commitment. All this suggests an urgent need for ongoing formation that enables priests to interiorize their commitment at a deep level and learn how to live with less cultural support than existed in the past.\n\nInternational Priests and Multiculturalism in the United States: We are a nation of immigrants, and foreign-born priests have been a part of the landscape of the Church in the United States for generations. There seems to be, however, a growing dependence on international priests precisely at a time when Catholicism is solidly established in American life. Similarly, even priests born in the United States find themselves compelled by pastoral necessity to learn a foreign language, especially Spanish, to serve the people under their care. The integration of international priests and the welcome of new Catholic immigrants underscores the need for ongoing formation for priests, who must come to terms with each other and with recently arrived populations in a new way.\n\nSocial Shifts and Realignment of Church Resources: In the last twenty-five years the United States has been marked by notable shifts in the economy, moving, for example, from a manufacturing-based economy to one driven by information technology. Demographic shifts have taken place and continue to do so in the major cities. Rural areas have also experienced major transitions. All this represents a remarkable quantity of social change, and it has had implications for the organization of the Church's mission. The closure of parishes, for example, has been an extraordinarily painful experience for many dioceses and priests. The future seems to hold more social change in store and, with it, a need for more realignment of church resources. This immensely complicated and delicate task will summon all the talents, wisdom, and spiritual patience that priests have to offer. Again, ongoing formation seems essential to meet future challenges.\n\nSocial Engagement of the Church in Matters of Justice, Life, and Reconciliation: The Catholic Church in the United States has a voice and a responsibility to speak on behalf of justice issues, life issues, and national reconciliation. The American tendency to privatize religion and to separate it, at least implicitly, from public life creates some resistance to hearing the voice of the Church. There are Catholics as well who are convinced that the Church should stay out of public discourse on social matters. In fact, the enormous weight of these issues and the call to be faithful to prophetic witness underscore the urgency of ongoing formation for priests who must exercise leadership.\n\nThe New Evangelization: Pope John Paul II has set a pace for the Church entering a new millennium. He has called for a new evangelization, primarily targeted at reclaiming those who are Catholic Christian in name but weakly or loosely connected with faith and Church in fact. In an American context, sociologists have documented that large segments of our population, including our Catholic population, are attracted to the spiritual journey but reluctant to establish ties with institutional religion. The challenge facing the Church and, particularly, its priests is to link the spiritual quest of people with the faith traditions of the Catholic community of faith. This integral approach to a new evangelization in the United States demands a clarity of theological vision and a depth of spiritual commitment that priests can only summon in themselves if they are studying and praying well, if they are engaged in ongoing formation.\n\nFluidity and Polarization in the Post-Vatican Church: The process of conciliar renewal is short by historical standards and seemingly incomplete. In the United States, the years after the Council until now have been marked by a certain fluidity in liturgical practice, catechesis, and ecclesial organization. This indeterminateness seems to have generated vocal reactions in church life that want either the restoration of a pre-Vatican II Church or the complete dismantling of the Church and its re-assembly as an entirely new reality. The majority of Catholics seem to identify themselves with a quiet, faithful middle ground. The concern for a deeper assimilation of the renewal called for by the Council, however, will remain for the foreseeable future. Renewal will require leadership, much of which must come from priests, that is, theologically formed and spiritually sustained. This prospect highlights the need for ongoing formation.\n\nSharing Many Ministries and Retrieving the Core of Priestly Identity: As the Catechism of the Catholic Church indicates \"the laity can also feel called, or be in fact called, to cooperate with their pastors in the service of the ecclesial community, for the sake of its growth and life. This can be done through the exercise of different kinds of ministries according to the grace and charisms which the Lord has been pleased to bestow on them (Catechism, no. 910). These many kinds of ministries have been a blessing for the postconciliar Church. At the same time, priests retain a unique and irreplaceable identity and function in the Church, even as many others who are not ordained assume responsibilities in and for the Church in the world. If this expansion of ministry is to develop authentically, priests will need to contribute to it with their leadership, encouragement, and expertise. At the same time, they must be sufficiently secure in their own identity, so that new ecclesial developments do not pose a threat to them. If priests are to contribute to the encouragement of ministries in the Church and retain a secure sense of themselves, they will depend in great measure on the mechanisms of ongoing formation. Especially to be valued will be the development of skills of collaboration with growing parish staffs and the skills of consensus building in working with parish groups, such as pastoral councils.\n\nThis consideration of the context from ten perspectives enables us now to examine more directly the shape of ongoing formation for priests, some of the practical implications of the values and convictions which we have identified.\n\nI. The Programs, Resources, and Practices to Foster Ongoing Formation\n\nPrograms, resources, and practices, we noted, do not constitute ongoing formation. They do not make it happen, nor does their employment offer the assurance that it is, indeed, taking place. They are, however, necessary means or instruments to foster ongoing formation. The following section will explain how programs, resources, and practices can be organized to serve their purpose of fostering ongoing formation.\n\nThe programs must hold fast to the understanding of ongoing formation as the continuing integration of identity and function for the sake of mission and communion with Christ and the Church, the growing and vital connection of who priests are and what they do for the sake of the mission.\n\nDifferent life stages, we already noted, mean that the task of integration will also be different, and this fact obviously has implications for programs and resources. There is formation that is specific to newly ordained priests, recently ordained priests, priests preparing for the first pastorate, middle-aged priests, priests preparing for retirement, and retired priests. Each group has its specific program needs. Still, there are core pieces of identity and service that are constant across priests' lifetimes no matter their age or the particular circumstances of their ministry. A part of formation truly does remain ongoing, permanent, or constant. That steady core forms the substance of the program and resource descriptions that follow. Programs specific to age and circumstance are considered in part two of the basic plan.\n\nFinally, Pastores Dabo Vobis divides ongoing priestly formation into four categories: human, intellectual, pastoral, and spiritual. Although programs may overlap categories, it seems best to retain the distinct categories proposed in the apostolic exhortation.\n\nJ. Human Formation\n\nHuman formation ought to have as its aim the fuller development of priests' humanity so that their humanity can be a \"bridge\" for communicating Jesus Christ to men and women today (cf. PDV, no. 43). In this context, Pastores Dabo Vobis speaks of priests' relational capacities: \"Of special importance is the capacity to relate to others. This is truly fundamental for a person who is called to be responsible for a community and to be a â€˜man of communion'\" (no. 43).\n\nIf human formation aims to cultivate the humanity of priests so that their humanity is instrumental in communicating Jesus Christ and that they can be authentic \"men of communion,\" then the general means of such formation are clear. Psychological and sociological self-knowledge, for example, are essential. Cultivating one's capacity for communication as listener and speaker strengthens the capacity for dialogue and communion. Attention ought to be given to any personality quirks that impede communion. In addition, cultivating one's capacity for communion also includes regularly scheduled time for rest and vacation.\n\nCultivation of our humanity cannot ignore the body. Our embodiment means the need to care for our physical well-being, not only maintaining health but training the body to sustain an active and invested life. An essential element of the priest's embodiment is his sexuality. Ongoing formation necessarily includes an increasing integration of one's sexuality. As noted previously, sexuality is an energy or passion directed toward connecting, belonging, and giving life. While a celibate commitment is not expressed in genital sexual activity or in an exclusive intimate relationship, the priest remains a sexual person who is expected to develop mature expressions of chaste love and caring. As the priest internalizes his celibate commitment, his sexuality is ever more directed toward a vibrant spiritual life, nurturing appropriate friendships in a passionate, caring priestly ministry. The human integration of affectivity is manifest in appropriate responses to the thwarting of basic needs and the experiences of significant loss. Without affective integration, these situations give rise either to debilitating depression or destructive anger. Human formation seeks to foster affective integration.\n\nFinally, human formation entails contact with the culture: the arts, sciences, and politics of human life. These studies and involvements keep priests in touch with their own lives and the lives of those whom they serve.\n\nThese are the general means of human formation. The specific means include events, resources, and programs. For example, human formation, as we have described it, can sometimes occur through a one-to-one dialogue of friendship. At times, professional counseling can appropriately and effectively address human growth issues for priests. It need not be reserved, as unfortunately it is in the perceptions of some, for the treating of illness. Professionally facilitated groups that focus on interpersonal dynamics can be effective instruments of human formation. Similarly, human formation can happen in the context of feedback, when individuals are helped to see and appreciate their impact in various situations, so that they can learn from that knowledge and confirm what is good and change what is less opportune. Programs of periodic review and assessment are useful feedback mechanisms.\n\nAs we have described it, human formation has a direct, personal, and experiential dimension. Study can also foster human formation for priests. An intellectual component in human formation enables priests to understand themselves and others better. Certain courses, seminars, workshops, or directed readings could advance the human formation of priests. The following themes and fields of study serve as a sample of this approach:\n\nThe human life cycle (psychology)\n\nGender differences and communication (anthropology)\n\nA profile of the United States or the local population (sociology)\n\nUnexamined assumptions of contemporary life (philosophy)\n\nExpressions of human experience in literature, art, drama, and film (fine arts)\n\nScience that shapes our life (science)\n\nDiversity and democracy in the United States (political science)\n\nInformation technology (computer science)\n\nK. Intellectual Formation\n\nIntellectual formation aims to deepen the understanding of faith. It seeks to link theoretical knowledge with a practical wisdom, so that priests can serve their people more effectively. This kind of intellectual formation is not classroom bound nor does it result in detached speculation. It truly is faith seeking understanding, driven forward by love for the people served. The fathers of the Church are models for this kind of formation. They were pastors who were theologians, and they were theologians thoroughly immersed in pastoral life.\n\nTwo areas of intellectual formation require special attention:\n\nThe Faith Convictions That Ground Priests' Mission and Ministry: Throughout the course of their priestly ministry, priests must revisit and study what they are doing, how they are representing Christ, and why. If priestly ministry is not merely the exercise of professional expertise but a true service in faith for God's people, then priests must continually ground their ministry and life in the underlying assumptions of faith. This is not done once and for all. This is a fundamental and often repeated retrieval and reflection on the faith foundations of priestly ministry. Regularly, priests must return to their roots in the Church, in the mystery of Christ, ultimately, in the very mystery of trinitarian life. Like their brothers and sisters in faith, priests are pilgrims and struggling disciples. They need to return regularly and deliberately to the holy mysteries that ground their ministry and life.\n\nHow do priests revisit this holy memory to re-ground and re-orient themselves in ministry? Are there programs or structures available to do this? Some suggest themselves immediately. The annual event of priests gathered with their bishop at the Chrism Mass is a particular moment for such retrieval. The diocesan celebrations of priests' ordinations, anniversaries, and deaths can be another. Days of renewal, such as the days of sanctification encouraged by the Holy See, are an occasion for returning to the sources in faith for ministry and mission. The annual diocesan retreat can be another occasion. An especially powerful tool of faith retrieval and re-grounding is found in small groups of priests gathered to reflect not on what they do or how they do it but on the holy origin of their ministry.\n\nUpdating in Major Theological Areas of Special Pastoral Concern: The seminary program is limited in its time frame. It also suffers from the seminarians' lack of experience. Furthermore, seminaries cannot fully anticipate developments in theology or new challenges in pastoral situations. For this reason, theological updating or aggiornamento is a continuing and pressing need of intellectual formation throughout the course of priestly ministry. Some examples of special areas of pastoral concern that require an authentic pastoral theology and theological reflection on specific situations in the lives of our people, parishes, and society (PDV, no. 57; PPF, nos. 341, 398) include the following:\n\nRevelation-faith and the relationship to reason\n\nEcumenism and inter-faith dialogue, especially in the context of the United States\n\nThe authority of the Bible and its relevance for daily life\n\nSacramental theology\n\nTheology of priesthood\n\nTheology of marriage\n\nTheology of suffering, illness, and death\n\nSin in a personal and social context\n\nMedical-moral issues\n\nQuestions of justice and the Church's social teaching\n\nThe processes and programs for intellectual formation need careful examination. A lecture format, although occasionally useful, is a very limited form of adult learning, especially for practitioners, as priests in parochial ministry are. Dioceses have often focused on bringing in a speaker for workshops, convocations, and study days. Theological updating can be accomplished in other formats and, often, more effectively. Videos, the internet, guided self study, and peer learning in small groups not only offer more flexibility in the study process but they also respect the lived experience of the priests.\n\nL. Pastoral Formation\n\nPastoral formation entails the development of skills and competencies that enable priests to serve their people well. Pastoral formation is not divorced from intellectual or theological education. It is, however, the more practical side of theology. \"As pastors of the People of God in America, priests must also be alert to the challenges of the world today and sensitive to the problems and hopes of their people, sharing their experiences and growing, above all, in solidarity towards the poor. They should be careful to discern the charisms and strengths of the faithful who might be leaders in the community, listening to them and through dialogue encouraging their participation and co-responsibility\" (EA, no. 39).\n\nCompetencies and skills by their very nature are acquired and developed through instruction, application, and practice. Attempts to develop certain critical pastoral competencies and skills for priestly ministry will meet with limited success in the course of a seminary program. The real opportunity to learn and cultivate such pastoral competencies and skills is after ordination, when the opportunity for application and practice becomes available.\n\nCertain competencies and skills emerge directly from priests' identity and what service they are called to render for the community. Other competencies and skills are shaped by the particular needs of our American culture and the historical moment. Among those competencies and skills that perennially belong to priests are the following:\n\nPreaching and proclaiming the word\n\nCelebrating and presiding at the sacraments\n\nLeading prayer\n\nPerforming pastoral counseling and spiritual direction\n\nDirecting the catechesis of adults and children\n\nParticular features of our American culture and historical moment encourage priests to develop these competencies and skills:\n\nSocial analysis and community organization\n\nCross-cultural communication\n\nForeign language skills\n\nThe initiation, direction, and supervision of the various pastoral efforts of the Church\n\nThe Church that priests serve is both a spiritual and a visible-institutional reality. Part of their continuing pastoral formation must include knowledge of the ways of institutional leadership and management. In their pastoral function, priests are responsible for the Church as a community ordered in love. Additionally, they function as employers and as stewards of the temporal goods of the Church. None of these responsibilities is outside the pale of their pastoral task. All dimensions of management require thoughtful attention, specific knowledge, and particular competencies and skills to make appropriate applications of the knowledge to practical situations. Even as more and more pastors hire business managers to be directly responsible for temporal matters, priests still need some management development.\n\nOngoing pastoral formation ought to include the following areas:\n\nCanon law updates\n\nPersonnel management\n\nConflict resolution\n\nFinancial management\n\nEffective leadership in meetings\n\nFacilitation of parish communication\n\nM. Spiritual Formation\n\nSpiritual formation is a life-long task that priests share with other followers of Jesus Christ. Its aim is for priests to become better disciples of Jesus Christ and, specifically, to become more transparent sacramental signs of him in whose person and name they act.\n\nThe ongoing spiritual formation of priests needs to move in five dimensions: formation in discipleship, formation in pastoral charity, formation in celibacy, formation in obedience, and formation in simplicity of lifestyle. The benefit of the guidance and wisdom of spiritual directors and confessors can be of enormous assistance to priests in their ongoing spiritual formation.\n\nFormation in Discipleship\n\nPastores Dabo Vobis follows Vatican II's Decree on the Training of Priests (Optatam Totius) in identifying spiritual formation as learning \"to live in holy, familiar and attentive union with the Father, through his Son Jesus Christ in the holy Spirit\" (no. 8). Furthermore, spiritual formation means drawing close to Jesus Christ as friend in every detail of life (cf. PDV, no. 45). As spiritual writers have consistently noted, the life of discipleship is a shedding of illusions and the embrace of real or authentic self in Christ.\n\nThe means for nurturing such formation in discipleship include a daily life of prayer that includes contact with the word of God along with the cultivation of a contemplative attitude and faithful participation in the sacramental life of the Church, especially the Eucharist and the sacrament of reconciliation. Priests' discipleship also finds expression and growth through their daily celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours, which as the prayer of the Church links them with the whole body of Christ in praise, petition, and thanksgiving. Discipleship also entails a daily taking up of one's cross through a process of self-denial, self-discipline, detachment, and an embracing of the circumstances of one's life as providentially given by God. The cultivation of a devotional life, which can include, for example, the rosary, the stations of the cross, and visits to the Blessed Sacrament, fosters discipleship by keeping believers in contact with Mary, the Mother of the Lord, and the saints, the friends of God. Discipleship is also fostered by nourishing the affective dimension of priests' faith journey.\n\nFormation in Pastoral Charity\n\nIn addition to the journey of discipleship that priests share with other believers, they also traverse a spiritual path marked by their specific identity as priests and the specific priestly service they render to the Church and the world. Presbyterorum Ordinis of Vatican II envisions the spiritual integration of priests' ministry and lives, their unity of life, in pastoral charity: \"Priests will unify their lives by uniting themselves with Christ in recognition of the Father's will and in the gift of themselves to the flock entrusted to them. In this way, by adopting the role of the good shepherd they will find in the practice of pastoral charity itself the bond of priestly perfection which will harmonize their lives and activity\" (no. 14). In other words, as priests give themselves to their people in proclaiming the word, celebrating the sacraments, leading prayer, interceding for the community, and leading the community, they will find their unity of life, their spiritual formation in the unifying love of Christ, the Good Shepherd, who gave his very life for us.\n\nThere are specific means whereby this unifying and integrating pastoral love becomes more conscious and more accessible to priests. Spiritual direction, for example, is an extraordinarily useful means for retrieving the experience of ministry, the presence of the Lord, and the integrating-unifying directions that God gives through the ministry. In presbyteral fraternity, priests can come to terms with the unifying love of Christ the Good Shepherd as the source and goal of their ministry and lives. That presbyteral fraternity takes various forms: the presbyterate with its bishop, priests' support or prayer groups, priests' friendships with one another that pursue their deep common bond in Christ, and various forms of mentoring that occur in a presbyterate. Retreats and days of renewal can also be integrating moments. Forms of spiritual associations, such as third orders, secular institutes, and pious unions, can offer possibilities for appropriating and deepening unity of life in Christ and spiritual formation. Sabbaticals can be seasons of grace that allow for a deeper sense of spiritual formation. Spiritual reading can serve a similar purpose.\n\nFormation in Celibacy\n\nThe spiritual formation of priests is shaped decisively by their celibate commitment. The seminary offers formation for celibacyâ€”a vision, a challenge, and a set of practical possibilities for making and living one's celibate commitment as a priest. Even the very best seminary program cannot prepare priests for a lifetime of celibate living in the context of priestly ministry. In addition to formation for celibacy, there needs to be formation in celibacy, for those already ordained and living out their commitment and facing questions, challenges, and graced possibilities.\n\nFormation in celibacy is not simply focused on living with the renunciation of marriage. Formation in celibacy necessarily includes a direct and honest facing of one's sexuality and an ever-increasing freedom in expressing one's sexuality within an appropriate celibate context. Its overall aim centers on deepening the experiences of solitude, communion, love, and giving life. The motivation for the celibate commitment is pastoral charity, the all-encompassing love of Christ, the Good Shepherd for his people, as we noted above. Practically, formation in celibacy revisits three essential elements: the rationale for celibacy, the skills needed for celibate living, and the supportive resources to sustain the commitment and the life.\n\nThe rationale for celibacy needs to be revisited regularly. In other words, priests need to re-appropriate the spiritual sense of celibacy in light of their lived experience. Just as husband and wife cannot take each other for granted but need to reappropriate their love for each other in deliberate and conscious ways, so too priests must reclaim the sense of their celibacy as an act of love for God and God's people in the Church.\n\nPriests also need to keep learning and refining the skills for celibate living. These are the human, interpersonal, and spiritual strategies for healthy and generative loving and living.\n\nFinally, priests need the supportive resourcesâ€”personal, ecclesial, and socialâ€”to sustain and nourish them in their celibate commitment. These may include a genuine sense of fraternity in the presbyterate, a healthy relationship with one's family of origin, priest support groups, and honest friendships.\n\nWithout a reason for celibacy, without the skills or means to live it out, and without a supportive and encouraging context, significant difficulties are bound to arise. With a reason, with means, and with support, celibacy is not only tolerable but indeed a fulfilling path of loving God and others and bringing new life to the world. Clearly, although celibacy fits best under \"spiritual formation\"â€”its true horizonâ€”many other areas of priests' formation converge in it: human, psychological, physical, and ministerial.\n\nIn remembering and developing a rationale for celibacy, bishopsâ€”as well as senior clergy whose wisdom is invaluable for the whole presbyterateâ€”play an important role. The skills of celibate living can be studied and prayed over in workshops, spiritual direction, retreats, counseling, and the mutual mentoring that can happen in priest groups. Supportive resources for celibacy ought to be found in the presbyterate gathered with the bishop and among the laity.\n\nFormation in Obedience\n\nObedience for priests, especially diocesan priests, is an apostolic obedience. The Second Vatican Council identified the apostolic dimension of priestly obedience in Presbyterorum Ordinis: \"Priestly obedience, inspired through and through by the spirit of co-operation, is based on that sharing of the episcopal ministry which is conferred on priests by the sacrament of order and the canonical mission\" (no. 7).\n\nThe Directory on the Ministry and Life of Priests cites canon law as well as the Second Vatican Council in specifying priestly obedience: \"Priests have a â€˜special obligation to show reverence and obedience to the Supreme Pontiff and to their own Ordinary.' In virtue of his belonging to a determined presbyterate, the priest is charged with the service of a particular Church, in which the principle and foundation of unity is the Bishop. . .\" (no. 62).\n\nPriests' obedience has a christological foundation. The word made flesh came among us in obedience to the Father's will. His holy mission continues through his Church, which is hierarchically structured and whose very structure for the sake of mission requires obedience.\n\nPriests not only make a promise of obedience at the time of ordination, they are also invited to grow in obedience, so that the Church's mission may advance through healthy collaboration and greater fidelity to God's will and design.\n\nThe process of growing obedience implies a real relationship between priests and their bishop, one that is marked by honest and direct communication. Growing obedience also means reading the signs of the times in union with the bishop and presbyterate to identify God's call in a given situation or set of circumstances. Finally, growing obedience means the practice of regular prayerful submission to what is asked.\n\nFormation in Simplicity of Life\n\nPresbyterorum Ordinis says that a right attitude toward the goods of this world is essential for priests, because his mission \"like that of the Church is carried out in the middle of the world and . . . created goods are necessary for the personal development of man\" (no. 67).\n\nIn the measure that they approach the world with gratitude, simplicity, and generosity, priests grow in authentic sense of the world's goods. These attitudes and elements of lifestyle are rooted in Jesus Christ.\n\nGod pronounced an original blessing over the world at its creation. That blessing reached its perfect fulfillment in the incarnation, the mystery of the word made flesh. Jesus, although rich, emptied himself and made himself poor, so that we might become rich (cf. Phil 2:6-11; 2 Cor 8:9). As he went about his public ministry, he did so completely unencumbered: \"Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head\" (Lk 9:58). Finally, on the cross Jesus gives himself completely to the Father for our sake. In Jesus Christ priests see the pattern and the possibilities for their own relationship to the world and the things of the world: gratitude, simplicity, and generosity.\n\nPriests grow in the right use of this world's goods by embracing a way of life based on the principles of Catholic stewardship. Indeed, such an attitude will give the priest frequent opportunities to express prayerful gratitude for God's many blessings. They also grow by taking responsibility for the material dimension of their lives, for example, through saving and planning wisely for their ministerial needs and their personal future.\n\nPriests grow in a simplicity of lifestyle through a regular and prayerful scrutiny of their lives that identifies whatever would encumber them in their ministry and then eliminating it. Finally, simplicity and a spirit of poverty are always linked in the Gospels with generosity. Priests grow spiritually by the practiced use and distribution of their material resources for others, especially the poor.\n\nThe Study of Spirituality\n\nThe emphasis in spiritual formation is on the practice of spirituality, the cultivation of our experience of God by the power of the Holy Spirit. Walking in the footsteps of St. Teresa of Jesus, we can also say that it is a matter both of experience and knowledge. Fundamentally, it is something lived, but it is also something studied.\n\nFor priests, the study of spirituality includes topics and areas that can serve to nourish their spiritual life and, at the same time, enable them to be more available instruments for the spiritual growth of their people. Some significant themes and topics for priests to pursue in their ongoing spiritual formation are the following:\n\nSpirituality in a specifically Catholic Christian context\n\nSpiritual resources and practices from the tradition, specifically for priests\n\nSpiritual classics as a resource for ministry and life\n\nThe spiritual life cycle of priests and others\n\nThe act of learning about spirituality from various traditions\n\nPriests as intercessors and teachers of prayer\n\nPriestly spirituality as ministerial and integrative\n\nThe meaning of ongoing conversion of life\n\nThe spirituality of celibate life\n\nN. The Responsibility for the Ongoing Formation of Priests\n\nEarlier sections of this plan have identified the nature and urgency of ongoing formation for priests as well as some of the practical possibilities for translating values and convictions into programs and resources. In the end, if ongoing formation is to take place, someone must be responsible for it. We have considered the what, why, and how of ongoing formation for priests. What remains is the who.\n\nIndividual Priests\n\nIndividual priests are responsible for their ongoing formation. Their responsibility is linked to their commitment at ordination to serve well the people of God through their ministry and through their own personal faith commitment. Priests in dialogue with their bishop, his representative, or other members of the presbyterate need to map out their plan of ongoing formation.\n\nAt the same time, it seems possible, in light of everything that has been said, to determine a basic minimum. For example, as a basic minimum for formation the following elements would need to be in place:\n\nFifty-two contact hours of education per year (in other words, one hour per week)\n\nOne week of retreat\n\nDaily prayer (especially the celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours)\n\nMonthly celebration of the sacrament of reconciliation, perhaps in conjunction with spiritual direction\n\nMonthly contact with a priest group or its equivalent\n\nBishops and Their Delegates\n\nBishops have responsibility for the ongoing formation of priests. That is abundantly clear in conciliar and postconciliar documents. Surely, the first way they exercise that responsibility is by providing the personal example of their own commitment to ongoing formation. Other dimensions of that responsibility are not spelled out. It may be helpful, then, to identify in what way the bishop is directly responsible for ongoing formation and in what way he ought to make provisions for the ongoing formation of priests of the diocese.\n\nBishop's Direct Responsibility:\n\nThe receipt of a regular report from those charged with the ongoing formation of priests on the \"state of soul\" of the presbyterate and any particular concerns\n\nAt least three contact points with the presbyterate at large, e.g., Chrism Mass, a study day, or a diocesan retreat (as well as the presbyteral convocation when it is held)\n\nA periodic conversation held either directly or through the bishop's delegate with each priest concerning his ongoing formation to provide for accountability and encouragement\n\nBishop's Provision for Ongoing Formation:\n\nProvides for the adequate staffing of an office for the ongoing formation of priests (bishop functions as the guarantor of encouragement, time, and resources)\n\nAppoints a director to organize, ensure funding for, and communicate the resources of human, intellectual, pastoral, and spiritual formation (whether diocesan based or drawn from other institutions)\n\nAppoints and oversees a committee of priests (perhaps drawn from the presbyteral council) and others to regularly examine the process of ongoing formation in its various dimensions\n\nSupervises the director to establish linkage between the ongoing formation of priests and other diocesan efforts, e.g., evangelization, catechesis, worship, justice and peace, and lay formation\n\nThrough the mechanisms of diocesan communication, communicates the values, purposes, and activities of the ongoing formation of priests to the people of God\n\nO. Accountability\n\nThe best-laid plans for ongoing formation will amount to very little if they are not accompanied by a spirit and structure of accountability. Priests are answerable to the Church, to their people, and to themselves and their own sense of integrity, as they grow in their humanity, discipleship, and priestly ministry.\n\nThe word \"accountability\" in the context of ministry may be relatively new. The reality, however, stems from New Testament traditions. Paul, for example, especially in 2 Corinthians makes himself accountable to God, the church community, and himself. The following passage gives an example of how he stands accountable for a particular ministerial-apostolic decision: \"But I call upon God as witness, on my life, that it is to spare you that I have not yet gone to Corinth. Not that we lord it over your faith; rather, we work together for your joy, for you stand firm in the faith. For I decided not to come to you again in painful circumstances. For if I inflict pain upon you, then who is there to cheer me except the one pained by me? And I wrote as I did so that when I came I might not be pained by those in whom I should have rejoiced, confident about all of you that my joy is that of all of you\" (2 Cor 1:23-24; 2:1-3).\n\nThe Church, especially through the bishop and other presbyters, has a right to call priests to accountability for the ways that they have or have not fostered their human, intellectual, pastoral, and spiritual growth. Priests ought also to make themselves accountable for their ongoing formation. A simple way to do this is by sharing their choices and commitments for ongoing formation with their staff and people. They let their local community know, \"This is what I am doing to serve you better.\" Sharing formational commitments with a spiritual director, friends, and priest support groups also facilitates a sense of accountability. A public position renders priests more visibly accountable for following through on a commitment to grow as men, disciples, and priests.\n\nPart Two: Formation at Different Ages\n\nA. A Good Beginning: Ongoing Formation in the First Years of Priesthood\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe first five years of ordained ministry are very important. They set a pace for the years that stretch ahead. They also lay a foundation for the future and provide a point of reference across a lifetime of priestly ministry.\n\nMany events, as we shall shortly see, mark the first years of priesthood. All of them fit into a single frame of transition, the transition of newly ordained priests from the major seminary into their first parochial assignment. In an initial and decisive way, newly ordained priests embark on a formational journey of integration as they seek to link who they are and what they do, their priestly identity and service. They make themselves available to God's transforming power at work in their ministry and lives.\n\nThe following section will consider the ongoing formation of newly ordained priests in four steps: (1) a detailed description of the event of transition for the newly ordained; (2) an identification of the principal tasks and challenges that the newly ordained face; (3) a naming of their spiritual concerns viewed through the themes of temptation, grace, and discernment; (4) and finally, a consideration of programmatic responses to the needs of transition into priestly ministry.\n\nEvent\n\nThe general frame of transition from the major seminary to the first parochial assignment contains many events and experiences. Some have to do with departure, others with arrival, and still others with inner movements.\n\nDeparture from the seminary is usually a highly anticipated moment and a greatly welcomed one when it finally arrives. It does, however, signal a significant leave-taking. Newly ordained leave the seminary and, at the same time, leave behind a familiar setting that has been the context of their lives for at least four years. They also leave behind important relationships that may continue but in an altered way because of patterns that marked their lives during the time of preparation.\n\nPriestly ordination signals another departure from student status, the state of being \"in preparation for,\" to the status of a recognized and activated worker or minister of the Gospel. At this point, newly ordained are also conscious of leaving a way of living their Christian vocation among Christ's faithful people (The Vocation and the Mission of the Lay Faithful in the Church and in the World [Christifideles Laici] [CL]) to assume a new position and responsibility among and for that holy people.\n\nArrivals also become important. The newly ordained arrive in a new community and settle into new living arrangements. They arrive in the midst of a new set of established co-workers. They arrive in a new community with a new position or role as priest. They arrive into a new set of daily tasks.\n\nFinally, the event of transition into priestly ministry contains inner experiences, which we will consider in more detail shortly. Ordination establishes priests in a new way of being in and for the Church by configuring them to Jesus Christ, Head and Shepherd. And even though this new identity is conferred in ordination, it may not be fully and consciously appropriated for some time. Another inner experience is a significant shift of focus from the development and formation of oneself during the years of preparation to a centering in service and mission to others as an ordained priest.\n\nThese are some of the pieces that form the event of transition for newly ordained. They leave, they arrive, they sense inner movements. It is no small matter. Were one to compare this transition into priestly ministry to other kinds of human experience, it might be like leaving home, graduating from school, beginning a career, getting married, and starting a familyâ€”but all at once.\n\nTasks and Challenges\n\nThe above description of the transition into priestly ministry and life hints at the multiple tasks and challenges that face the newly ordained. Some tasks are of a directly practical nature. They are important because they have to do with basic functioning as a priest. Other tasks and challenges concerning the appropriation of priestly identity are less visible and less susceptible to empirical verification but are critical and urgent because they are so foundational.\n\nPractical Tasks and Challenges\n\nAn initial practical task is to bring closure to the seminary experience. As happy as most are to leave a seminary program to begin direct service as a priest, they may also sense loss in a leave-taking that causes some grieving. If, as part of that process, the newly ordained can summon gratitude by identifying the graces of the years of preparation, that can anchor hope as they begin to navigate through unknown or, at least, unfamiliar waters.\n\nAnother practical task is to get to know the new parish community and staffâ€” something of its history, its current make-up, and its graces and struggles.\n\nNewly ordained also need to begin to work, that is, to apply the knowledge and skills that they have acquired in the seminary. A good seminary program will have launched them into the process of linking theory and practice, but now they need to do so more intensively. Translating theory into practice is never a simple matter. The challenge is especially true in priestly ministry. It entails learning from and in the experience of ministry in order to grow in a prudential wisdom that can apply book knowledge in practical and effective ways. Some things can only be learned on-site: the special procedures of a given parish and rectory, collaboration with other staff members, the art of teaching in a classroom and working with youth, care of the sick and grieving parishioners at a time of tragedy, management of conflict, the ability to work with difficult people, and elements of parish administration.\n\nAs newly ordained confront these myriad practical tasks and challenges, they are also challenged to learn how to stay centered in what really matters, the heart of their mission as priests. That means, for example, holding fast to a rhythm and pattern of prayer in daily life.\n\nTasks and Challenges Concerning Identity\n\nIn addition to the practical tasks and challenges of beginning priestly ministry in a parish, newly ordained priests face the challenge of growing into a new identity as priests. The process of appropriating a new identity as a priest unfolds both in the interior life of priests as well as in their external and visible ministry and life.\n\nInterior Identity: Because of the consecration that they receive through the conferral of the sacrament of holy orders, priests are different. Pastores Dabo Vobis, following the seventh proposition of the 1990 Synod, offers the following synthesis: \"It is within the Church's mystery, as a mystery of Trinitarian communion in missionary tension, that every Christian identity is revealed, and likewise the specific identity of the priest and his ministry. Indeed, the priest, by virtue of the consecration which he receives in the Sacrament of Orders, is sent forth by the Father through the mediatorship of Jesus Christ, to whom he is configured in a special way as Head and Shepherd of his people, in order to live and work by the power of the Holy Spirit in service of the Church and for the salvation of the world\" (PDV, no. 12 [Propositio 7]).\n\nPriests, by their ordination, are configured to Jesus Christ, Head and Shepherd, for the sake of mission to the Church and world. This is how they are because of ordination. That new way of being, however, does not automatically translate into a new sense of self, a new psychological and spiritual identity. In fact, that internalization and appropriation of what has happened through ordination is a task that lies ahead of those who have been ordained.\n\nIn a way that parallels the mystagogical task of the neophytes newly initiated into the mysteries of Christ on Holy Saturday, newly ordained priests are summoned to understand, claim, and deepen what has already happened to them in sacred ordination. This is the task of claiming priestly identity interiorly. It means coming to a new, internalized sense of self as being in conformity to Christ. Also linked to priestly identity is conformity to Christ in doing what he did, so that priests show their \"loving concern to the point of a total gift of self for the flock. . .\" (PDV, no. 15). This means that in addition to an internalized sense of self as conformed to Christ Head and Shepherd, an internalized and cultivated disposition to give oneself as Christ did also is present. In other words, at an interior level, priests, especially newly ordained, begin to appropriate a new identity in Christ and a correlative commitment to give of themselves as he did.\n\nExterior Identity: Newly ordained priests have the task of internalizing their new identity and commitment that flows from ordination. They also have the task of appropriating and living the more external dimensions of their priestly identity that stem from their unique relationships to the bishop and presbyterate and to the Church.\n\nThrough ordination priests come into a new identity of belonging to a presbyterate led by its bishop. This relationship stems from their sacramental participation in the presbyteral order. At its deepest level, presbyteral identity in communion with the bishop has sacramental roots. This is clearly stated in Pastores Dabo Vobis, no. 17: \"By its very nature, the ordained ministry can be carried out only to the extent that the priest is united to Christ through sacramental participation in the priestly order, and thus to the extent that he is in hierarchical communion with his own Bishop. The ordained ministry has a radical â€˜communitarian form' and can only be carried out as â€˜a collective work.'\"\n\nIn addition to the presbyteral identity forged in sacramental participation, a shared identity accompanies the common work of ministry, an identity that belongs to those who serve collaboratively in the mission of the Church as bishop and priests. They do so out of a shared sense of responsibility for the flock entrusted to them.\n\nFinally, the presbyterate with its bishop can claim a fraternal identity, which means that the sacramental and ministerial bonds are strengthened by the care and solicitude they have for one another (cf. PO, no. 8). It is a task and challenge for newly ordained priests to claim their priestly identity through their sacramental, ministerial, and fraternal connections with the bishop and the presbyterate.\n\nNewly ordained also claim their priestly identity in a more exterior way as they serve the Church at large and their parish in particular. Ordination locates priests in the Church and in relationship to the Church (in ecclesia . . . erga ecclesiam [cf. PDV, no. 16 (Propositio 7)]) as a sacramental representation of Christ. The ordained priesthood is sacramental because it is conferred by a sacrament and because priests themselves are \"sacramental\" signs of Christ. Priests' sacramental existence, which precisely as sacramental is exterior and public, gives rise to their identity and is manifested in their service and more general relationship to the Church they serve.\n\nNewly ordained priests grapple with the sacramental and external dimensions of their identity through the new roles and functions that they exercise in a community of faith. These new roles include preachers, presiders, confessors, counselors, teachers, and administrators.\n\nAt the same time, newly ordained do not function independently nor in isolation. Generally, they serve with at least one other priest and, most often, with a parish staff. Their task and challenge is to claim and understand their priestly identity in a way that stays true to their sacramental existence and also enables them to serve collaboratively with others, both ordained and non-ordained, for the good of the whole Church. There is a shared task and challenge for the parish, the ministerial staff, and the newly ordained: to listen, to learn, to dialogue, and to stay faithful to the God-given mission and life of the Church.\n\nCelibate Identity: Newly ordained have been prepared for consecrated celibacy in the seminary, have made the public commitment at ordination, and have lived celibately prior to ordination. There is a difference, however, between preparing for celibacy in a seminary context and living out the commitment in the midst of serving the Church as priest. The newly ordained find themselves in the challenging role of being a public person. It is a difficult task to learn how to be a loving and caring priest for significant numbers of people while maintaining appropriate pastoral and interpersonal boundaries. Such challenges are best faced under the supervision of a mentor, pastor, or other delegated supervisor.\n\nThe newly ordained have the task and challenge to learn how to love the Church with an undivided and generous heart. Pastores Dabo Vobis, no. 29, says, \"The Church, as the Spouse of Jesus Christ, wishes to be loved by the priest in the total and exclusive manner in which Jesus Christ her Head and Spouse loved her. Priestly celibacy, then, is the gift of self in and with Christ to his Church and expresses the priest's service to the Church in and with the Lord.\" The purity, detachment, direction of one's sexuality, and generosity that this love requires are learned by the newly ordained as they serve the people of God. The task and the challenge is, in effect, to learn the integrating path of pastoral charity in its very practice (cf. PDV, no. 23).\n\nSpiritual Concerns: Temptations, Graces, Discernment\n\nThe transition into priestly ministry and life is not simply a transition into professional life, that is, the beginning of a new job. It marks a place on the journey in faith of spiritual transformation. As other spiritual moments of importance, this one has its particular temptations, its offers of grace, and its need for discernment.\n\nTemptations\n\nTemptation is a testing, and this seems to be a common experience for newly ordained. The test comes in the form of disillusionment, struggle, or even crisis. It may occur from three to eighteen months after a parochial assignment has begun. Sometimes, it represents a brief moment, other times it is more protracted.\n\nThe shape of temptation varies. It may take the form of doubts about one's abilities to meet the kind and quantity of human and spiritual need that is so readily manifest in parish life. It may have to do with rectory living conditions, such as a lack of privacy, a difficult or idiosyncratic pastor, or the \"foreignness\" of the parish cultural environment. The shape of temptation may be related to the difficulty of finding one's role on a parish staff. It may be connected to a sense of separation and distance from peers and important friends. It can strike at the very heart of priestly ministry and life, as one comes to a deepening awareness of the extraordinary mission given to priests. Grasping the idea that one's mission is not one's own but Christ's can stir up a deep sense of inadequacy and discouragement, if not panic.\n\nAnother form of temptation presents itself without any sense of anxiety. Indeed, it is quite the opposite of anxious concern about one's adequacy or ability. It is the temptation to superficial enthusiasm. The first flush of priestly ministry can engender a \"high,\" an ego-stroking sense that one can \"take on the world.\" It is a bent toward self-sufficiency in ministry based on the initial positive responses evoked from people. It leads priests to let go of learning in the course of ministry and to relying altogether too much on their own abilities and ingenuity. In short, it is the temptation to deny grace in the practical order.\n\nAnother form of temptation stems from the understandable insecurity of those recently ordained. Faced with so much that is so new, multiple demands, and the often unrealistic expectations of even well-intentioned people, newly ordained priests can be tempted to lock into controllable frameworks, familiar routines, and predictable patterns of ordering reality. A kind of inflexible legalism sometimes is a manifestation of this form of temptation. Not only is it a poor psychological adaptation, it is also a spiritually regressive move that places my control of circumstances over my surrender to God's will.\n\nA final form of temptation is connected to the multiple and complex set of demands that rush upon newly ordained. Because of the complexity and intensity that they experience in their ministry and lives, they may be tempted to assume a reactive stance toward life and people. Their reactions can be disproportionate to the objective pastoral realities of their situation.\n\nThese temptations, as described, highlight possible areas of testing that belong especially to the experience of transition into priestly ministry and life. In the experience of newly ordained and their bishops, more personal forms of temptation may arise now (or later) as they face inclinations in themselves or in other priests toward destructive behavior, such as the violation of sexual boundaries, substance abuse, gambling, and the like. Awareness of such experiences or inclinations may be jarring for the newly ordained and will require particular attention and support.\n\nThe experience of temptation is a critical moment in the ongoing formation of newly ordained priests. Just as the temptations of Jesus at the beginning of his public ministry were the occasion to anchor his identity as the obedient Son of the Father who was fully willing to carry out the mission entrusted to him, the experience of temptations for the newly ordained can be an occasion to deepen and consolidate their already-made commitment.\n\nGraces\n\nGrace is, of course, the very life of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit dwelling within us. That is the incalculable gift given to us who are reborn in the waters of baptism. There are also graces: particular gifts that point to their source in God and mark the journey of our lives.\n\nThe transition into priesthood is an occasion of grace, a time when particular gifts of God are manifest and take hold of the life and heart of priests who journey with their people to God. These particular graces need to be named, received with gratitude, and returned to God through service to his holy people.\n\nThe particular graces of priestly ministry and life, even as it begins, are numerous. Here, we identify only three, but they seem especially important: (1) the grace of new beginnings and growth, (2) the grace of vulnerability, and (3) the grace of community.\n\nThe transition into priesthood certainly marks a new personal, professional, and spiritual beginning. Accompanying the new beginning is an infusion of new life and prospects of growth. Humanly and personally, the new beginning beckons priests to an expanded and deepened sense of life, the natural correlative of priestly ministry as a deep interpersonal engagement. Professionally, as we have already seen, the beginning of priestly ministry ushers a season of remarkable growth in embracing a role, in participating in activities, in translating theory into action, in developing skills, and in growing in practical wisdom. Spiritually, the new beginning signaled by ordination draws the newly ordained more closely to Christ in whose name and person they serve. The grace of beginnings is really the gift of possibilities for growth.\n\nIt is neither easy nor pleasant to feel vulnerable. Still, the time of vulnerability can be a holy season of grace. Newly ordained priests are surely vulnerable in notable ways. Their inexperience, the many new unknowns at the beginning of priestly ministry, and their unproven abilities to cope, respond, and succeed all make them especially vulnerable. The particular grace of their vulnerability rests in a renewed sense of dependence on God. Just as confidence in one's own abilities recedes, a greater openness to the action of God is possible. The grace of vulnerability is, in effect, a gift of greater reliance on him in whom all things are possible.\n\nThe grace of community is a deepened re-connection with the body of Christ to which the newly ordained belong and which now, as priests, they serve. In these new relationships to the church community, newly ordained discover the many ways that the gifts of God are at work; their ministry in the community becomes a source of their edification and inspiration.\n\nDiscernment\n\nDiscernment or the testing of the spirits means sifting through the experiences of ministry and life to determine what is of God and what is not of God. It is not so much, as popular understanding would have it, \"figuring things out\" as allowing God's truth to surface in a process of humble but alert noticing.\n\nNewly ordained will inevitably feel the tug and pull of various spirits or inclinations leading them in different directions. What is genuine, authentic, and holy? What is not so helpful in the spiritual and ministerial journey? What, in fact, tends toward a dangerous derailment of the journey?\n\nAn initial movement is to identify resistances on the journey. For example, Pastores Dabo Vobis indicates that the very idea of ongoing formation may be a point of resistance for the newly ordained. They may have \"a certain sense of â€˜having had enough'\" (PDV, no. 76) in their seminary experience. Other points of resistance might include a false sense of independence, a fear of uncovering inadequacies, and an unwillingness to rely on a larger wisdom.\n\nThe process of discernment or maintaining a discerning heart assumes that one is engaged in and faithful to a life of prayer. If, at the beginning of one's priestly ministry, the sudden surge of pastoral demands obliterates the regularity of personal prayer or if the positive response of people to one's initial efforts seems to diminish prayer's necessity, then discernment cannot happen.\n\nDiscernment for the newly ordained and for everyone occurs in an ecclesial context in which we rely on the Holy Spirit at work in the community of faith and among particular believers in the community. So, discernment will also assume a willingness to share with others and to rely on them. It is not simply a solitary process. It needs spiritual direction, holy friendship, and the fraternity of other priests. Discernment requires a humble willingness to be self disclosing; it is not simply about psychological facts or states but about the movements of grace and the inclinations to sin.\n\nProgrammatic Responses to Transition into Priesthood\n\nThe event of transition into priesthood, its tasks and challenges, and its spiritual dimensions are numerous and complex. Each diocese can respond to its newly ordained in some organized program that respects the particularity of the diocese and the specific character of the newly ordained. Programsâ€”seminars, retreats, workshops, study days, \"mentoring\"â€”will vary. A constant element holds: those persons involved in the programs are those individuals and groups who contribute decisively to the ongoing formation of the newly ordained. The focus of this section is mainly on the persons involved in ongoing formation and less on the design of specific programs that can and do vary according to local circumstance.\n\nAmong those involved in ongoing formation are the newly ordained priests themselves, both as individuals and as a group; the bishop; the presbyterate generally and some priests specifically; and the parish staff and the parish at "
