It also contains other supporting materials that can be used by anyone who is interested in youth substance use health. This includes substance snapshots of common substances, harm reduction resources, research publications, and mental health and addiction supports.\n\nDECYDE is co-led by Dr. Bishop and Dr. Jennifer Donnan in partnership with NL Health Services. They have an extensive team of researchers, staff, and students along with collaboration from youth, teachers, parents/guardians, stakeholders, and people with lived and living experience.\n\nDECYDE is still being developed with new resources being added frequently. They will be piloting the lessons plans and materials with teachers in 2024 and they encourage others to provide feedback on the posted materials through the feedback form on the website. Visit the DECYDE website at https://decyde.ca/ for more information.\n\nDECYDE has received financial support from Health Canada’s Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP), the Janeway Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador."
