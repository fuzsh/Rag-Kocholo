These high silica rocks are also marked by their fine grain size of < 60-70 microns and mm-scale lamina. Lamination is characteristically parallel, with horizontal to gently inclined attitude, and absence of cross-stratification. Sediment-filled mudcracks (evidence of desiccation) are absent, as are outsized clasts, such as pyroclasts, impact ejecta blocks, or glacial dropstones. Early to late diagenetic textures are present including dendritic concretions, prismatic crystal pseudomorphs, and calcium sulfate-filled fractures. High silica rocks show repeating characteristic lamina thicknesses reminiscent of terrestrial lake sediments. Deposition is likely to have occurred in a pro-delta environment where clastic sediment was delivered as river plumes, and perhaps also as authigenic phases from lake waters. Chemical and mineralogical analyses indicate that the majority of Murray formation mudstones are composed of roughly equal proportions of clastic igneous minerals, and secondary phases (e.g., phyllosilicates), including amorphous mineraloids of probable secondary origin. The mudstones are sourced by incipiently weathered basalt, and are possibly cemented by Ca-Mg-sulfates and silica, the latter in the form of cristobalite or opal. Redox cycling is indicated by variable amounts of hematite, magnetite, and jarosite, and likely reflects dynamic primary lake water and/or diagenetic redox conditions. For a smaller number of samples silica contents reach values as high as ~70-85 wt %, and include ~10% trydimite The fine-scale lamination is not disrupted by post-depositional weathering or alteration processes. Hydrothermal and acid-sulfate weathering mechanisms are frequently invoked to explain the occurrence of siliceous rocks on Mars, and the presence of trydimite suggests distal silicic volcanic ash or eroded silica-rich detritus. However, available sedimentological, geochemical, and mineralogic data also support a fourth hypothesis: that at least some silica enrichment occurred via chemical precipitation as sediment within a subaqueous lake setting, perhaps similar to terrestrial banded iron formation.\n\nFull Event Details\n\nBrown Bag: Elaine Flynn\n\nEffects of oxalate on Ni adsorption and repartitioning during Fe(II)-promoted iron oxide recrystallization\n\nSteven Zatman Memorial Colloquium: Shijie Zhong\n\nSeismic and flexure constraints on lithospheric rheology and their dynamic implications\n\nBrown Bag: Jill Pasteris\n\nHow can it be that complicated?

In great numbers, these microbes have significant environmental consequences. I will talk about biomineralization of elemental sulfur and iron oxyhydroxides, including insights into composition and formation by the phototrophic S-oxidizer Chlorobaculum tepidum, as well as chemolithotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria. We have also studied Fe-oxidizing bacteria and how they form distinctive Fe oxides that can be used as biosignatures. Using lab- and field-based work, I will show how these tiny architects build macroscopic biomineral structures, and thus how microbes can contribute to geologic-scale deposits.\n\nFor information on the speaker, visit her website at: http://udel.edu/~cschan/Site/Home.html\n\nFull Event Details\n\nBrown Bag: Scott VanBommel\n\nMaking Lemonade on Mars: Enhancing the Capability of In Situ Spectrometers After Landing\n\nColloquium: Nathaniel Putzig\n\nColloquium: Undergraduate Honors Research\n\nBrown Bag: Tim Stern\n\nMigrating uplift-subsidence, volcanism and deep seismicity in continental interiors due to a convective edge-instability\n\nColloquium: Dustin Schroeder\n\nBrown Bag: Mike Krawczynski\n\nFieldwork in Kamchatka: Borscht, Eruptions, and Bears, Oh my!\n\nBrown Bag: Michael Bouchard, Maddie Hughes & Xiaochen Mao\n\nInvestigations of Impacts: a Short Course at the Sudbury Impact Structure\n\nRetirement Celebration for Robert Criss & Randy Korotev\n\nDissertation Defense: Kathryn Powell\n\nHydrated minerals near Martian landing sites as observed by CRISM and OMEGA\n\nDissertation Defense: Chen Cai\n\nSeismic structure near the Mariana trench and deep earthquake triggering in the Tonga flat slab\n\nBrown Bag: Pierre Haenecour\n\nOrigins of organics and volatiles in meteorites: insights from TEM in-situ heating experiments\n\nColloquium: Paolo Sossi\n\nEvaporation of moderately volatile elements from silicate melts: experiments and theory\n\nDissertation Defense: Andrew Lloyd\n\nSeismic Tomography of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans: Regional and Continental Models from the Upper Mantle to the Transition Zone\n\nColloquium: Rita Parai\n\nThere and Back Again: Deep Earth Xe Transport and the History of Volatile Recycling\n\nBrown Bag: Hugh Chou\n\nThe Forage for Data Storage\n\nColloquium: Tobias Fischer\n\nGas emissions from volcanoes and active tectonic regions: Implications for the deep carbon cycle\n\nBrown Bag: Michelle Repice, Career Center\n\nColloquium: Dr. Grant Bybee\n\nAnorthosites & secular evolution of mass transfer across the Moho - implications for evolution of the continental crust\n\nColloquium: Jian Lin, WHOI\n\nInternational exploration of the deep ocean: From ultra-slow-spreading oceanic crust to ultra-deep trenches\n\nStephen Zatman Memorial Lecture: Lunar Magnetism\n\nSonia Tikoo-Schantz, Rutgers University\n\nHigh-Resolution Radar Imaging of Near-Earth Asteroids\n\nDr. Lance Benner, JPL\n\nThe Potential Roles of Minerals in the Emergence of Protocells\n\nProfessor Nita Sahai, University of Akron\n\nBrown Bag: Zhen Tian\n\nA ‘dry’ beginning for the asteroid 4-Vesta — Seen through a potassium isotopic lens\n\nThe Terrestrial Planets of Other Stars\n\nProfessor David Charbonneau - Robert M.

Sometimes, the temperature rise during earthquakes makes the rocks hot enough to melt. However, solidified frictional melt (pseudotachylyte) is not very common in the rock record, and other paleoseismic temperature proxies have only recently been established. The dearth of pseudotachylyte led researchers to hypothesize that faults get very weak during earthquakes, and hence do not produce much heat. If faults dramatically weaken during slip, there are important implications for how earthquakes propagate, and hence why some earthquakes grow to be very large. Here, we use a new sub-solidus temperature proxy, biomarker thermal maturity, to identify temperature rise on faults in a variety of tectonic settings. With this new temperature proxy we revisit some outstanding questions in fault mechanics such as: Where does earthquake slip occurs in a fault zone? Can creeping faults host earthquakes? Does lithology control rupture propagation? and How is energy partitioned during earthquakes? How strong are faults during earthquakes?\n\nFull Event Details\n\nBrown Bag: Lillian Soto-Cordero, Saint Louis University\n\nSlip Behavior and Structural Control on Megathrust Rupture: Insights from the 2016 Mw 7.8 Pedernales, Ecuador Earthquake Sequence\n\nSenior Thesis Presentations\n\nDepartment Awards Ceremony And Reception for Undergraduate Students\n\nGraduation Party\n\nCelebrate the achievements of Spring 2019 Earth & Planetary Science graduates!\n\nBrown Bag: Chhavi Jain\n\nChhavi Jain, a graduate student from Yale University, will deliver a special brown-bag talk on “Improving our understanding of olivine rheology by synergizing rock mechanics, seismology, and geodynamics.”\n\nSt. Louis Women in Geospatial Technology Summit\n\nAstronomy on Tap\n\nDr. Christopher Dabney Heffner, NASA JPL Solar System Ambassador and Dr. Mike Krawczynski, Washington University in St. Louis\n\nApollo 50th Anniversary Moon Landing Party\n\nFree event hosted by the Saint Louis Science Center\n\nApollo 50th Anniversary Moon Landing Party\n\nFree event hosted by the Saint Louis Science Center\n\nSaint Louis Science Center | 9:30 AM\n\nJoin us at this free all-day event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon Landing!

The meeting will be held via Zoom online conference only, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The meeting and lecture will begin at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, September 18. Zoom access information is posted on the Society’s website, https://www.slasonline.org/. The event, cosponsored by NASA's Missouri Space Grant Consortium, is open to the public free of charge.\n\nOver 70% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, to an average ocean depth of almost 2.5 miles. Where did all that water come from? The origin of Earth’s oceans is a major topic of modern planetary science research. Most theories about the formation of the Earth propose that our planet formed too close to the Sun to retain large quantities of water. Dr. Vacher will explain the leading theories for the original source of Earth’s water, and indicate how his own studies of certain types of meteorites may provide some answers to water questions.\n\nDr. Lionel Vacher is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Physics at Washington University and a member of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences. His primary research interests include “primitive” meteorites, the origin of water in the solar system, the effects of water on meteorite chemistry, and hydrothermal experiments.\n\nThe St. Louis Astronomical Society is an organization for individuals interested in astronomy and telescopes. The public is invited to attend its meetings, telescope observing sessions, and special events.
