        "text": "“I really felt like my purpose had ended,” said Deanna Frank, 74, of Crown Point. “I couldn’t breathe or walk more than 50 feet before I had to sit down. I’d get up in the morning, walk into the living room and have to sit so I could breathe.” Cardiothoracic surgeon J. Michael Tuchek, DO, FACS, diagnosed Deanna with severe aortic stenosis and scheduled her for TAVR surgery at Franciscan Health Crown Point. During the procedure, Dr. Tuchek placed an artificial valve inside the diseased valve using a catheter without needing to open Deanna's chest or use a heart/lung machine, all while allowing her heart to continue to beat. “The next day, I was sitting up straight in bed at the hospital and I said, ‘I can breathe,’” said Deanna, the first patient to undergo the to undergo the TAVR procedure at Franciscan Health Crown Point. “A nurse came in and asked me if I’d like to go for a walk in the hall with him. It was the day after my surgery and I walked over 700 feet without stopping. I hadn’t done that in three and a half years.” Deanna said she is looking forward to playing with her grandkids, walking and participating in social gatherings again as a result of her surgery. She was so happy with the outcome of her surgery, she had a T-shirt made with “Ask Me About TAVR” on the front and “In the care of Dr. J. Michael Tuchek” on the back. “I’m literally going to be a walking billboard for this TAVR procedure,” she said. “Words can never begin to express how thankful I am to Dr. Tuchek and Franciscan for giving me my life back.”\n\n\"We know that AEDs save lives, especially when placed in first responder vehicles,\" said Julie West, founder of the Play for Jake Foundation. \"We also know that AEDs require continued maintenance, which is why this race is so important. Our community's participation will ensure all patrol cars have access to new batteries and new defibrillation pads exactly when they're needed.\" Franciscan Health Michigan City is teaming up with Bolt for the Heart and the Play for Jake Foundation for the annual 5k family walk/run to raise funds for maintaining life-saving AEDs in law enforcement vehicles. The Play for Jake Foundation and Bolt for the Heart 5K is scheduled to take place at 8 a.m. on July 27 during Lakefest at Fox Memorial Park’s Dennis F. Smith Amphitheater on Truesdale Avenue in La Porte. “These hometown heroes are usually the first to a scene and if they have all the equipment that they need such as an AED, lives will certainly be saved,” Bolt for the Heart Founder Pierre Twer said. “We thank Play for Jake and Franciscan Health for their continued sponsorship and support of this event.” “We are continuing to save lives together in the communities we serve,” Mazzoni said. “Franciscan Health Michigan City is honored to again be a part of this important event.” For more information on the Play for Jake/Bolt for the Heart run, to register for the event or to donate, go to www.boltfortheheart.com.\n\nFranciscan Health Crown Point and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago are expanding their partnership with the addition of a Lurie Children’s pediatric hospitalist to serve young patients admitted to the Crown Point hospital. The collaboration, effective July 1, helps to ensure Northwest Indiana children and adolescents receive comprehensive care closer to home. “As an emergency physician and Northwest Indiana parent, I am thrilled that our partnership with Lurie Children's is bringing expanded emergency and inpatient pediatric care close to home,” said Franciscan Health Crown Point Vice President of Medical Affairs Ryan Misek, DO. “For decades, when children would require hospitalization, they would often be transferred by ambulance to hospitals hours from home, sometimes across state lines. I have witnessed the added stress and disruption that this causes during an already challenging time for our local families.” The new Lurie Children’s pediatric hospitalist team is dedicated to evaluating and treating pediatric inpatients from infancy through adolescence. The partnership allows for board-certified/board-eligible Lurie Children’s pediatricians to provide daily management of pediatric inpatients, in-house care 24/7 in the pediatric inpatient unit, coordination of care with the child’s pediatrician, management of care for newborns and pediatric consultations in the emergency department. \"Our expanded partnership with Franciscan Crown Point reflects our commitment to providing comprehensive, specialized care to children where and when they need it,” said Richard Lehmuth, senior vice president, chief strategy officer at Lurie Children’s. “Together, we aim to enhance pediatric healthcare delivery, ensuring every child receives the highest standard of medical care and compassion, “ The partnership builds on the collaboration launched in 2022 between Lurie Children’s and Franciscan Health Crown Point that brought Lurie Children’s neonatologists to staff the Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Franciscan Health Family Birth Center Crown Point. “I am proud that we are addressing a need of our growing community and enhancing the overall health and safety of our region through our partnership with Lurie Children's,” Dr. Misek said.

Management of chronic diseases can be exacerbated by living in a food desert, not being able to afford quality fruits and vegetables, a lack of transportation and personal mobility issues.” Participants must have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, have moderate to high food insecurity as determined by a screening process and complete a four-week Cooking Matters course. To register and for more information, contact Selena Tinoco at Selena.Tinoco@FranciscanAlliance.org or call (219) 221-4153. The Produce Prescription Program is made possible in part through donations to the Franciscan Health Foundation’s Food Insecurity Fund.
