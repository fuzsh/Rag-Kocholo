        "text": "Last month, I had the amazing opportunity to attend J.P. Morgan 42nd Annual Healthcare Conference, and it was one of the most transformative experiences I've had in a while. Let me share why this moment meant a lot to me. I started 2023 not in the best space‚Äîmentally or physically. I heard about this event on Twitter two days prior to the conference and said to myself, \"this looks like a conference I need to be at.\" Despite how I was feeling, I flew out to San Francisco not knowing anyone; I was going to make the best of it. I googled how to get tickets to the conference and found out it was invite-only. While I didn't attend the actual conference, I met great people doing amazing things in the healthcare industry at the events I attended in the evenings. In June 2023, I received a surprising invite to feature on JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs ‚ÄúWomen on the Move‚Äù Podcast hosted by Samantha Saperstein. If you haven't heard the podcast yet, I really encourage you to listen to it. It's so good! https://shorturl.at/tCT69 Fast forward to November 2023, I felt in my spirit to ask for an invitation to attend 2024‚Äôs JPM Healthcare Conference. I was afraid to ask. I made peace with not getting a response or hearing a \"No.\" But deep down, I knew I was going to get a \"Yes.\" And by the Grace of God, on Jan 8th, 2024, I found myself attending the biggest convening of healthcare professionals in the world. I left feeling inspired and invigorated to implement new ideas for Clafiya. For once, I had a vision of where we could go if we stayed the course. I saw CEOs of companies - Toyin Ajayi Ikenna Okezie, MD, MBA Raj Panjabi, I've admired from afar share their journey and vision for their companies' future. And I could certainly see myself doing that one day. I even met Jamie Dimon himself! Vision is very important because last year, I felt like I couldn't see beyond where Clafiya was at the time. Being an entrepreneur in Nigeria‚Äôs healthcare space isn't easy. Almost every opportunity I identified for Clafiya‚Äôs growth did not materialize. And the ones that seemed promising at some point felt like they were slipping away. You all saw someone smiling on TV, at conferences, or on social media. But many nights, I cried myself to sleep. Attending the JPM Healthcare Conference gave me new foresight for Clafiya and myself. Last year I hustled to ‚Äúattend‚Äù the conference. This year, God's Grace carried me through. Thank you so much Women on the Move team for giving me the opportunity to attend the conference. Also, thank you The Female Quotient for doing my makeup for my new headshot, it looks beautiful! Thank God. I am truly grateful. üíô Activate to view larger image,\n\nHello, Everyone. Happy Friday and Happy New Month! I wanted to share a recent experience with you all. Last week, I had the privilege of speaking at the Berkeley Haas Africa Business Club - 2023 Africa Business Forum. I was honored to join Sean Mandell, who moderated the Health Technology Panel, and share my journey of building Clafiya in Nigeria. During the Q&A session, I received a thought-provoking question: \"What advice do you have for someone deciding between leaving their full-time job to pursue entrepreneurship?\" While I've talked about why I left my job before, I haven't shared how I prepared for that leap. The truth is, I didn't have a specific plan in place. I was saving money, but it lacked a clear purpose. I knew saving was wise, and seeing money in my savings account provided a sense of security. However, no amount of savings could have convinced me to leave my job for something uncertain. What I truly needed was Validation, Courage, and Faith. Validation came when Microtraction invested in our venture. I found Courage when I made peace with the understanding that, whatever happens, I would figure it out the best way I could. As for Faith, it arrived in a timely text message from my Mom on the day I resigned, referencing Joshua 1:9. That message sealed the deal for me. Thank you, Mom üíô. Here's my advice to anyone considering the leap into entrepreneurship: 1.) Financial Safety Net: Ensure you have a financial safety net that can sustain you for at least 6-12 months. Budget your monthly expenses and be prepared to live within that budget while not receiving a salary for a while. Entrepreneurship is challenging, and worrying about your financial well-being from the start is the quickest way to become discouraged. Additionally, avoid letting anyone pressure you into quitting your job prematurely, especially if they are not willing to provide financial support. Steer clear of such pressures. 2.) Seek Guidance: Connect with people who have walked the path you're contemplating. Have candid conversations with them. Share your fears, concerns, and listen with an open mind. 3.) Consider Family and Responsibilities: If you have a family or external responsibilities, factor them into your decision-making process. You will NEED your family, friends, and loved ones on this journey with you. Trust me. 4.) Healthy Habits: Cultivate healthy habits that will stay with you when you embark on your entrepreneurial journey. This includes practices like waking up early, going for walks, and maintaining your hobbies. 5.) Pray and Meditate: Finally, take time to pray and meditate on your decision. Seek inner clarity. Pursuing entrepreneurship is a significant decision that shouldn't be taken lightly or romanticized. You must do what works best for you. However, if you do decide to take this path, my hope is that you find peace in your heart and receive immense support from your loved ones. Thank you Delphine Anglo for this opportunity üíô.\n\nA few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join Samantha Saperstein, Managing Director and Head of Women on the Move at JPMorgan Chase & Co, on the Women on the Move Podcast. During this episode, I shared insights into my upbringing and how it influences our approach at Clafiya. Additionally, I discussed my experiences in the Techstars Catalyst Founder Program - DC Cohort. It was the first time I found myself surrounded by a supportive community of women entrepreneurs who genuinely wanted to assist each other in succeeding. They celebrated my achievements and provided unwavering support during times when my confidence wavered, particularly when I was in the midst of fundraising. This program played a pivotal role in helping me persevere, and I am deeply grateful for the experience; I do not take it for granted. Thank you JPMorgan Chase & Co. for providing a space to share my story on a huge platform. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience and I hope you enjoy listening. üòä You can listen to the episode on all streaming platforms here: https://lnkd.in/ezRGEWdK"
