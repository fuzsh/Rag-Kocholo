        "text": "The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security, US Department of Commerce, and are found at Title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 730-774.\n\nThe EAR prohibit the unauthorized export of:\n\nCommodities, software, and technologies identified on the Commerce Control List (CCL)\n\nItems to restricted parties on the Denied Persons, Entity, Unverified, and Military End-User Lists\n\nItems for nuclear, missile/rocket, and chemical/biological weapons uses\n\nThe CCL\n\nItems on the CCL include certain material processing equipment, high-end computers, encryption technology, composite materials, lasers, navigation equipment, and a variety of other items—many of which do not appear at first blush to be particularly sensitive or sophisticated (See full CCL). Depending on the specific country and item in question, an export may require the prior authorization of the US Government.\n\nAs discussed in further detail in the section on Exports to Non-US Persons in the US, the EAR govern not only exports of items outside the US, but also disclosures of controlled software or technology to non-US persons who are located in the US.\n\nRestricted Parties Lists\n\nThe Denied Persons, Entity, Unverified, and Military End-User Lists contain the names of individuals and organizations that have engaged in some sort of proliferation, export, or military activities of concern to the U.S. Government (see Denied Persons List, Entity List, Unverified List, and Military End-User Lists). As a general rule, it is unlawful to engage in certain unauthorized exports to any persons or organizations on these lists. The export controls officer checks non-US parties to material transfer agreements, external sales, and other transactions against these lists, and provides compliance advice as appropriate.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the entries on these lists are individuals, corporations, and government organizations, the Entity, Unverified, and Military End-User Lists identify a handful of non-US universities and other research institutions. UMN personnel are strongly advised to contact the export controls officer before entering into an agreement, contract, or other arrangement with any of these listed institutions.\n\nResearch Institutions on Entity List\n\nNameAddressFirst Date of Listing\n\nA.A.
