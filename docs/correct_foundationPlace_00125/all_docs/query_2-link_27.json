        "text": "Financial support is now available from the Ganister Orthodox Foundation for organizations with innovative approaches to advancing the mission of Orthodoxy in the U.S. July 1 is the annual deadline for submitting grant applications, with recipients announced in the fall of each year.\n\nFounded in 2001, the Ganister Orthodox Foundation is a component of the First Community Foundation of Pennsylvania, located in Williamsport, PA. Recent grants have gone to St. Stephen the First Martyr Orthodox Mission of Lima, OH to support production of a “mission starter kit”; St. George the Great Martyr Orthodox Church in Pharr, TX to finance seminarian Nativity break travel expenses, and, St. Tikhon’s Seminary, South Cannan, PA to further the married seminarian housing project.\n\nFavor is given to proposals that address priority needs of the Orthodox Church in America, especially those that do so in catalytic ways. The selection process also weighs leadership experience within each organization, clarity of goals, the presence of a stable funding base, and faithfulness to the teachings and ministry of the OCA. Applicants must articulate how their undertaking will have a positive impact on a specific priority need, without duplicating other programs or projects already serving the Church.\n\nApplicants must be qualifying 501c(3) organizations as described under IRS Section 509(a)(1). Grants will not be considered for endowments, ongoing operational support, annual campaigns or event sponsorships, debt reduction, research grants, or support of individuals."
