Besides her gorgeous mane we are loving her in the Netflix Rom Com “The Perfect Find” starring alongside Gabrielle Union and Keith Powers. In other good news you can catch more of Gina’s talents shine in “Lone Star” which has been renewed for season 5. Scroll on down and get some natural curly q tips, best bare essentials and don’t miss the final photo, it’s a winner…like this beauty!\n\nThe Bare Magazine: What were some highlights of working on The Perfect Find?\n\nGina Torres: Participating in a bonafide Rom Com for the second time in my life was wonderful. Especially the “com” part. And also being in such a generously creative atmosphere, surrounded by, run by, and supported by black and brown people. There is an emotionality to that, which is hard to describe.\n\nBare: Take us to one of our favorite spots on the set....the hair/MU trailer. What was the glam for your character?\n\nGT: I loved Jenna’s apartment. It was spot on in terms of what apartments can look like in NYC. And what we do as individuals to create our own safe spaces in an impossibly crowded city. The hair and make-up trailer was a place where music was always playing and the conversation was light and funny. It was the perfect way to start the day, especially since there is nothing about Darcy that isn’t extreme.\n\nBare: Now take us to your shower/vanity and tell us your hair process to accentuate those curls of yours? Do you air-dry, how often do you shampoo?\n\nGT: I do air dry!! But all women with curls understand that whatever magic bullet you eventually find for yourself, can sometimes take months or even years to find. And then God forbid some company gets it in their head to discontinue something or worse, change the recipe!! But to answer your question, shampoo every third day. Condition every day. The right leave-in and style curl cream are very important. I’m not a huge fan of gels because I find them drying. So I like Rizos curl cream, and Kerastase’s Curl Manifesto line.\n\nBare: Do you enjoy mixing it up with your press looks?\n\nGT: Absolutely. It’s a way of expressing my own creativity and personality outside of any of the roles I play.\n\nBare: Did you enjoy being photographed in a super natural look?\n\nGT: With you??? Yes! I’m used to a process of hours that go into achieving some kind of perfection. And that’s fun for about 1 hour after the 2 hour hair and makeup process. Beyond that, I just wanna punch somebody. (For the record I have NEVER punched someone, nor would anyone ever know I’ve felt this way, lol) This was an incredibly freeing and playful process. I wasn’t already exhausted by the time you started shooting.\n\nBare: Your skin is gorgeous - have you changed up your regime or added any new treatments recently? Do you feel diet and lifestyle factor in?\n\nGT: There’s a picture of my family on my desk, and I’m reminded daily of the genetic lottery I won. Having said that, I do my best not to squander it and live as healthy and joyous a life as I can. And the older I get the more I try to stay hydrated, use sunscreen and a good night-time moisturizer.\n\nBare: What are your favorite self-care indulgences or escapes?\n\nGT: Massages and pedicures. And at least twice a year I try to get away for a long weekend. Just me. I don’t go far. It’s just important to disconnect and recharge and to not think about holding to a schedule. Just wake up, and decide what I want to eat."
