        "text": "There are a lot of characters to love on , but some would argue that there's none more formidable than Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres). From episode one of the nine season series, the message is clear — she's the boss, and when it comes to the legal world she dominates, she doesn't take \"no\" for an answer. So when she left Pearson Specter Litt after season 6, viewers were left wondering what happened to one of their favorites. Thanks to the spinoff series Pearson, the wondering is no longer.\n\nCapitalizing off the success of Suits, which starred Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Meghan Markle, Wendell Pierce and Katherine Heigl to name a few, the USA Network premiered the spin-off series Pearson back in 2019. The show follows recently disbarred Jessica as she enters the \"complex and seedy world of Chicago politics.\"\n\nIt's a must-watch for those who want more of Suits after binge-watching all 134 episodes of the original series. And lucky for streamers, you can watch both series on Peacock for only . You can also and on with a free 30-day trial to start. The cast also includes Bethany Joy Lenz, Simon Kassianides, Eli Goree, Isabel Arraiza and Morgan Spector.\n\nThe show only lasted one season before it was canceled, but who knows — maybe the recent increase in viewership could bring a season 2 of Pearson in the near future?"
