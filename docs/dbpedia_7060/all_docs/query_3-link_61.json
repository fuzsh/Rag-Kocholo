        "text": "Gina Torres is a highly regarded American television and movie actress with a fantastic list of credits. The New York City native has taken key roles in shows like Xena: Warrior Princess, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Westworld, always to critical acclaim. She has a recurring role as Jessica Pearson in American show Suits and spin-off Second City, a show built around her character which she executively produces.\n\nThe show is also notable in that it makes Torres the first Afro-Latin actress in U.S. TV history to take on the leading role of a drama television series.\n\nFeature films such as I Think I Love My Wife have seen her star opposite Chris Rock, while she also played a married couple with then-husband Laurence Fishburne on the NBC television series Hannibal, having previously starred opposite each other in The Matrix. Torres attended New York City’s High School of Music and Art and is a gifted mezzo-soprano, having been trained in opera and jazz. A high-profile star with global appeal, Torres attended the Royal Wedding of Suits costar Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, and has won a number of awards for her TV acting. A talented voice actor who has voiced parts in films such as Justice League Unlimited, she remains a visible and vital star."
