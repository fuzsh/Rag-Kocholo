        "text": "Jessica Pearson was a force to be reckoned with on Suits. After all, her name is on the sign of the prestigious Pearson Hardman law firm. But the character and Gina Torres, the actress who plays her, does not make it through the entire run of the show, leaving fans wondering, \"What happened to Jessica on Suits?\" Here's what we know about Jessica's departure from the series.\n\nWhen does Jessica leave Suits?\n\nAs a managing partner, Jessica Pearson is one of the main characters on the first six seasons of Suits, until the character decides she needs a break from the responsibilities of her high-pressure job. She wants to focus on her relationship with Jeff Malone (D.B. Woodside), and at the end of season 6, two move to Chicago and she starts a new legal career there. Fans of the series know that Jessica's life in Chicago is the subject of the 2019 Suits spinoff, Pearson.\n\nWhy did Gina Torres leave Suits?\n\nThe actress decided to leave the show because of the strain it was causing in her personal life, and the timing worked out with her contract. Gina was traveling from her home in Los Angeles, where she lived with her husband, actor Laurence Fishburne (the two later divorced) and their daughter, to the filming location in Toronto. She told The New York Times, \"My contract was up, so this wasn’t a power play that went terribly wrong. My personal life needed to be tended to.\" The actress explained that she needed a break from the \"rigors\" of filming. She told showrunner Aaron Korsh, \"It’s not that I don’t love the show and love Jessica, who is my alter ego. But my life is my life, and I need to take care of it.\"\n\nGina explained that everyone was supportive of her decision to leave, and discussed one of her favorite parts of working on the show: The clothes, of course! She said, \"I love what I do and I love working, but my wardrobe fittings were the highlight of my week.\"\n\nWhere is Gina Torres now?\n\nThe 54-year-old actress has a long list of credits, including Firefly, Serenity, and The Matrix movies. She currently stars alongside Rob Lowe on 9-1-1: Lone Star. She has been in a relationship with entrepreneur Kevin Wright since 2017.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
