        "text": "Highest Rated: 88% The Everything Pot (2024)\n\nLowest Rated: 17% Hair Show (2004)\n\nBirthday: Apr 25, 1969\n\nBirthplace: New York, New York, USA\n\nA statuesque beauty, actress Gina Torres began her career as a talented vocalist and stage actor before finding success on screen in the blockbuster films \"The Matrix Reloaded\" (2003), \"The Matrix Revolutions\" (2003) and Joss Whedon's \"Serenity\" (2005). A talented mezzo soprano and New York native, Torres started her career on the Broadway stage. Though her heart was in musical theater, Torres shifted her talents to the small screen where she found starring roles in \"Cleopatra 2525\" (2000-2001), Joss Whedon's short-lived sci-fi series \"Firefly\" (FOX, 2002) and appeared in recurring roles on \"Alias\" (ABC, 2001-06) and \"24\" (FOX, 2001-10). In 2006, she guest-starred on \"The Shield\" (FX, 2002-08) and filmed \"Five Fingers\" with co-star and real-life husband Laurence Fishburne. Her later series work on the legal drama \"Suits\" (USA 2011- ), \"Hannibal\" (NBC 2013-15) and \"The Catch\" (ABC 2016-17) continued her string of exciting projects.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n88% The Everything Pot\n\n83% Give Me an A\n\n82% Serenity\n\n80% Don't Let Me Drown\n\n70% The Perfect Find\n\n19% I Think I Love My Wife\n\n17% Hair Show\n\nPhotos\n\nGina Torres Gina Torres at arrivals for THE TWILIGHT ZONE Series Premiere on CBS ALL ACCESS, Harmony Gold Theater, Los Angeles, CA March 26, 2019.
