        "text": "CROIX - Meet Gina's first celebrity pet - Croix! He's a mixed breed doggo who loves chasing squirrels and herding steers. But don't be fooled by his cute demeanor, he's also a bit of a snack monster and will eat anything he can get his paws on! Whenever Gina returns home from a long day of filming, Croix is always there to greet her with his tail wagging and his tongue out. However, this little guy can be quite mischievous at times. Once, he even chewed off and swallowed a big piece of his toy! Luckily, Gina was able to afford the vet bills and Croix came back with a scar and a cone of shame. It was a scary experience for her and her family, and they thought they might have to say goodbye to their beloved furry friend. As dog lovers know, there's nothing worse than watching your buddy wind down and having to say goodbye. Despite his little mishap, Gina and her family still adore Croix and all of his quirky personality. He brings so much joy and laughter into their lives, and they wouldn't trade him for anything in the world!\n\nTRU - Gina's celebrity pet family recently expanded with the addition of Tru, a beautiful English Pointer and the younger sister of Croix. She was adopted in May 2021 and immediately stole Gina's heart. She introduced Tru to her followers on Instagram with a heartwarming post, calling her the newest and yummiest addition to their family. But as any pet owner knows, introducing a new pet to the family can be a challenge, especially when there's an older sibling involved. Croix was not too thrilled about the newest member of the family and he wasn't shy about showing it. He was quite resentful of Tru and didn't quite know what to make of her. But, Tru quickly won him over with her adorable antics and playful personality. Now, Croix takes care of Tru like an older brother should. They have bonded quite well and are often seen hanging around together, playing and having the time of their lives in the luxurious Torres mansion."
