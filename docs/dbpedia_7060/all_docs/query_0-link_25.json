        "text": "The actress starred as Jessica Pearson on the first eight seasons of the hit legal drama and on her own short-lived spinoff.\n\nGina Torres is revealing the luxurious item that she stole from the Suits set before saying goodbye to the series in 2018.\n\nThe actress, who played Jessica Pearson on the legal drama and her character’s subsequent spinoff, told Us Weekly that she made sure to grab one of her character’s lavish wardrobe accessories as a memento to remember her time on the show.\n\n“I did take one thing from the Suits set,” Torres confirmed. “They were a pair of Louboutin heels, and they still have my character’s name labeled on the inside of them.”\n\nTorres’ character Jessica was the co-founder and managing partner of the prestigious corporate law firm at the heart of Suits, which has had its own cultural resurgence recently after its first eight seasons were added to Netflix. The rest of the legal office was rounded out with performances from Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Rick Hoffman, Meghan Markle, and Sarah Rafferty.\n\nAfter eight seasons on the show, Torres departed Suits to launch her spinoff titled Pearson, which aired for a single season back in 2019. The short-lived series, which also starred Bethany Joy Lenz and Morgan Spector, followed her character as she navigated the dark side of Chicago politics as a fixer for the city's mayor.\n\nThough Suits ended in 2019 after nine seasons, that wasn’t the last time fans would see NYC's brightest legal team all together again. Torres, Adams, Macht, and Rafferty recently reunited to present the award for Best TV Drama at the Golden Globes in January.\n\nWhile walking the red carpet, Macht described the new wave of fanfare surrounding the show as “an amazing thing.” He added, \"We had some great success when the show was on... and then at a certain point, Netflix came in. It's just gotten incredible eyes and we're very grateful for it.\"\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated content:\n\nThe cast of Suits: Where are they now?\n\nSee the Suits cast reunite onstage at the 2024 Golden Globes\n\nA new Suits show is in development amid the original's streaming success\n\nSuits creator says royal family didn't want Meghan Markle to say 'poppycock'"
