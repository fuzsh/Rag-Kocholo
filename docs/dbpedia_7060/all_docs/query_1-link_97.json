        "text": "The second show in the \"Suits\" franchise officially has a name: \"Second City.\"\n\nStar Gina Torres made the big announcement Monday, according to Deadline. The actress was at NBCUniversal's upfront in New York, and she reportedly revealed the title as she introduced footage from the \"Suits\" Season 7 finale. The episode originally aired April 25.\n\n\"Second City\" will head to Chicago (hence the title), following lawyer Jessica Pearson as she makes a name and a home for herself there. Of course, she'll face new challenges, especially as the show takes a more political bent. Creator Aaron Korsch previously indicated as much, telling Deadline that the character is \"going to get in a tangle and a tussle with some Chicago politics players.\"\n\n\"Second City\" was introduced as a backdoor pilot, meaning its pilot episode came during the \"Suits\" Season 7 finale. The episode in question brought back Torres's character once again, one of multiple guest appearances since the actress -- a former \"Suits\" series regular -- exited at the end of Season 6. Now, Torres is back in a starring role, and we'll get to follow all Jessica's adventures in the spinoff.\n\nUSA Network has not yet announced the premiere date of \"Second City.\""
