        "text": "Gina Torres is better known for her love life and her role as Jessica Pearson in the series âSuits,â but she has been part of the entertainment industry for almost two decades and has an extensive resume in her pocket.\n\nCuban American actress Gina Torres made several headlines in 2018 with a few months of difference for two reasons.\n\nGina Torres arrives at National Geographic's \"Cosmos: Possible Worlds\" Los Angeles Premiere at Royce Hall, UCLA on February 26, 2020 | Poto: GettyImages\n\nFirst, it was announced that at 50 years old, she had finally landed the leading role in a series, and second, she was one of the selected guests to Meghan Markle and Prince Harryâs royal wedding.\n\nTorres, who looked beautiful at the once-in-a-lifetime event donning a red dress, got her invitation from the Duchess of Sussex, with whom she shared the screen in âSuitsâ before Markleâs life was turned upside down.\n\nDespite her royal associations, Torres is a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood, and although it took her forty years to feel like she had finally broken through the ceiling in tinsel town, sheâs proud of how far sheâs come.\n\nGina Torres leaves St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle after the wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England | Photo: GettyImages\n\nMEET GINA TORRES\n\nTorres was born on April 25, 1969, in New York City. As the daughter of Cuban immigrants, she grew up surrounded by a multicultural neighborhood filled with a colorful array of languages, food, smells, and a sense of community.\n\nTwo months later, Fishburne filed for divorce requesting joint legal and physical custody of 12-year-old Delilah.\n\nFrom an early age, she knew what she wanted to be in life, always dancing around her home and being entranced by the telenovelas her family watched. However, her parents had a vision for their kids; they would become doctors, lawyers, or engineers.\n\nGina Torres attends the premiere of USA Network's \"Suits\" Season 5 at the Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown Hotel on January 21, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. | Photo: GettyImages\n\nDespite their initial lack of approval, Torres ended up enrolling at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts.\n\nThere, Torres received voice lessons, and her dream of being a performer started to take shape. It was after watching âA Day in the Death of Joe Eggâ with her class that Torres decided she would pursue a career in musical theater.\n\nâI just remembered thinking, I want to do that. I want other people to feel the way she made me feel,â Torres recalled. âAnd I want to take other people on the ride she just took me on.â\n\nGina Torres attends the premiere of USA Network's \"Suits\" Season 5 at the Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown Hotel on January 21, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. | Photo: GettyImages\n\nTorres applied and was accepted to several colleges to further her education, but since she couldnât afford it, she went straight to pursue a career.\n\nGINA TORRESâ CAREER\n\nTorres made her debut on the screen in 1992 with a small appearance on âUnnatural Pursuits,â and soon after, she started landing small parts on series like âLaw & Order,â âNYPD Blue,â âOne Life to Live,â âAngelâ and âCleopatra 2525.â\n\nIn 2003, she appeared on âThe Matrix: Reloadedâ and later went on to appear on âFirefly,â a series that, even if short-lived, earned Torres a huge following from the geek community.\n\nGina Torres attends a press junket for \"The Catch\" on Day Three of aTVfest 2017 presented by SCAD on February 4, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia | Photo: GettyImages\n\nThrough the mid-â00s, Torres kept landing guest roles in a dozen TV shows, until she was cast in the USA Network legal drama âSuits,â where she gave life to Jessica Pearson from 2011 to 2016.\n\nTorres decided not to renew her contract with the show after its sixth season, claiming that she was tired of commuting between Los Angeles and Toronto, where the show was filmed, and that she needed to take care of her family.\n\nHowever, by the start of 2018, Torres was ready to bring Jessica back on a spin-off of âSuitsâ centered on the fierce attorneyâs life. The series, titled âPearsonâ was released on the USA Network in July 2019.\n\nGINA TORRES & LAWRENCE FISHBURNE\n\nAlthough it is not clear when Torres and Fishburne started dating or how they met, they were already engaged in March 2001 when they began filming âThe Matrix: Reloaded.â\n\nThey married on September 22, 2002, and welcomed their first only child, daughter Delilah, in 2007. However, the couple led a somewhat private life, keeping their child out of the spotlight and rarely discussing their marriage with the media.\n\nGina Torres, Laurence Fishburne at the 46th NAACP Image Awards Arrivals at a Pasadena Convention Center on February 6, 2015 | Photo: GettyImages\n\nTorres did confess in an interview with USA Today in 2015 that she was one hundred percent devoted to her family whenever she wasnât wearing a pair of stilettos and standing in front of the cameras. She said:\n\nâI keep my house. I cook. I iron, as odd as that sounds. Spending time just being Gina because I spend so much time being other people.â\n\nAlthough everything seemed to be okay between Torres and Fishburne, fans were surprised to see Torres kissing another man publicly in 2017.\n\nLaurence Fishburne and Gina Torres during \"I Think I Love My Wife\" Los Angeles Premiere - After Party, March 8, 2007 | Photo: GettyImages\n\nDIVORCE AND LIFE AFTER IT\n\nWhen pics of Torres getting romantic with a man that wasnât her husband surfaced online, the actress had to release a statement revealing that she and Fishburne had been separated since fall 2016.\n\nTorres pointed out in her statement that there were no bad guys in the situation, and that she and Fishburne would continue working together to raise their daughter.\n\nâWe will continue to raise our daughter with love and joy and awe. As well as raise each other with respect and love and the continued understanding that weâre in this together,â she continued.\n\nGina Torres and Kevin Wright attend the premiere of Columbia Pictures' 'Miss Bala' at Regal LA Live Stadium 14 on January 30, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. | Photo: GettyImages\n\nTwo months later, Fishburne filed for divorce requesting joint legal and physical custody of 12-year-old Delilah.\n\nTorres moved on and started dating the man of the pics, who was later identified as Kevin Wright, an entrepreneur, and father of six from Utah who was also fresh out of a divorce after a marriage of 20 years.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtobGphbHqotc2aZK2noqeytHnIrGSlmaWnsq%2BvxGadoquYl8KzusSsZJudkarBb7TTpqM%3D"
