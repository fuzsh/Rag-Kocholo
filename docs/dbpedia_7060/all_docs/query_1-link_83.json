        "text": "With the highly anticipated sequel Matrix 4 coming to theaters and HBO Max this December, fans can’t wait to see some of their favorite characters return like Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).\n\nBut, wait. Didn’t Neo and Trinity die in the third installment of the sci-fi franchise, 2003’s The Matrix Revolutions? If so, how does bringing them back make any sense? Also, why weren’t characters who didn’t meet their demise in the last film not invited back for the new movie?\n\nThat’s what actress Gina Torres wants to know. She played a small role as the character Cas in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. Cas was the widow of Nebuchadnezzar pilot Dozer (Anthony Ray Parker) who died in the original 1999 film.\n\nIn real life, Torres was the wife of Matrix star Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus). The two divorced in 2018. Fishburne is not returning to reprise his role in Matrix 4.\n\nThe same goes for Torres. During a recent interview with Variety’s The Big Ticket podcast, she wondered how the new film was going to handle the plot holes of Neo and Trinity’s deaths.\n\n“Not to be bitter or anything, but the people that are actually in the movie, I believe died,” Torres says during the podcast. “And the people that aren’t didn’t. So, that’s all I have to say about that. I’m so curious about where they’re going with this. And what’s their jumping off point and what story they want because it just felt like they told it.”\n\nLike Torres’ Cas, other surviving characters from The Matrix Revolutions who will not be returning to the new film include Jada Pinkett Smith’s Niobe and Mary Alice’s The Oracle. We’ll have to wait to see how director and co-writer Lana Wachowski explains the resurrections of Neo and others, but let’s assume Cas is stuck somewhere in a computer-generated world assembled by a collection of zeros and ones.\n\nThere was no spoon. So, maybe, there was no Cas, either."
