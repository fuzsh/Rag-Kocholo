        "text": "Last updated on July 5, 2024.\n\nOften overlooked, Kastamonu is a small bustling city split in half by a river. It’s got a long history and has several historical monuments. The same Ottoman architecture that made Safranbolu famous is found in Kastamonu, although in a much more urban setting and with much less restoration.\n\nHistory of Kastamonu\n\nKastamonu was founded by ancient Greeks as Timónion (Τιμόνιον) historically in the Paphlagonia (Παφλαγονία) region. The modern name is derived from Kástra Komninón (Κάστρα Κομνηνών), which is the original name of the city’s castle built by the Komninós (Κομνηνός) branch of the Byzantine royal family. The city was also the birthplace of Greek rebetika composer Yovan Tsaous (Γιοβάν Τσαούς / Yovan Çavuş) in 1893.\n\nGetting There\n\nTo get to Kastamonu, it’s possible to take a bus from Istanbul, which usually takes about nine hours. It’s only four hours from Ankara. The Kastamonu bus terminal (Kastamonu Otogarı) is located on the outskirts of town. You have to take a taxi or a dolmuş into the city center. Once in the city center, it’s fairly easy to get around on foot. Day trips to İnebolu are also possible from the bus terminal.\n\nIn July 2013, the Kastamonu Airport (Kastamonu Havalimanı) opened. It’s possible to catch flights from both airports in Istanbul on Turkish Airlines and Pegasus Airlines (as of October 2023). The airport is located south of the city.\n\nHotel Mütevelli\n\nI stayed at the Hotel Mütevelli (Otel Mütevelli), right in the heart of the city along the river. The hotel was reasonably priced. The price and location couldn’t be beat, the breakfast was decent, and the staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms, however, left a lot to be desired.\n\nTry These Foods!\n\nFor food, don’t miss out on etli ekmek (not the Konya kind). This is a paper thin flatbread with meat in the middle. It goes great with ayran.\n\nAlso, do yourself a favor and get a box of çekme helva. It’s a delicious melt-in-your-mouth Turkish sweet very similar to pişmaniye.\n\nEflanili Mansion\n\nOne restaurant I can recommend was Eflanili Mansion (Eflanili Konağı). It’s set in a restored Ottoman home and also has tables in a wonderful garden in the backyard. They serve cuisine typical of Kastamonu. Try the banduma, a tasty turkey dish.\n\n41.37662533.776497"
