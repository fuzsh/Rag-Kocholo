        "text": "Kastamonu started supplies of laminated flooring from Russia to China. Kastamonu has shipped a batch of laminated flooring produced at its plant in the Alabuga SEZ (special economic zone), Tatarstan, Russia, by railway containers.\n\nProducts by Kastamonu are already exported to the markets of Central Asia, the Baltic states, the Balkans and South Caucasus, as well as to the Republic of Belarus and Moldova.\n\nThe designed capacity of laminate production is 35 million m2, and the company is planning to reach this capacity in 2018. Also, after the launch of the second production line in 2016, the production capacity of MDF/HDF boards exceeded 1 million m3 per year.\n\n“Following the approved development strategy, we continue not only to ramp up production, but also to systematically extend the export geography,” noted Ali Kılıç, General Director of the Kastamonu plant in Russia. “Now, even despite the decrease in the Russian laminate market, the situation is very favourable.\n\nSuppliers from Europe and China do not meet competition in terms of the price/quality ratio, and our products enjoy increased demand outside Russia. Even such a specific laminate market full of local manufactures as the Chinese market, became accessible for us.”\n\nKastamonu is one of the top 5 largest companies in the wood processing industry in Europe. The company specializes in the production of MDF wood boards, particleboard, laminate flooring, door linings and furniture panels."
