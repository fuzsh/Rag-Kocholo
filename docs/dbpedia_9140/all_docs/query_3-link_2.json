        "text": "Province of Turkey\n\nProvince in Turkey\n\nKastamonu Province (Turkish: Kastamonu ili) is a province of Turkey, in the Black Sea region in the north of the country. It is surrounded by Sinop to the east, Bartın, Karabük to the west, Çankırı to the south, Çorum to the southeast and the Black Sea to the north. Its area is 13,064 km2,[2] and its population is 378,115 (2022).[1] The population density is 29 inhabitants per km2. The provincial capital Kastamonu has a population of 128,707 (2022).[1]\n\nDistricts\n\n[edit]\n\nKastamonu province is divided into 20 districts (capital district in bold):\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is not definitively known when Kastamonu was first founded. However, some sources[which?] dating back to the Early Middle Ages refer to the province. There are also some archeological findings that date to about 100,000[citation needed] years that suggest the region was inhabited at that time.\n\nThere are many ideas about the derivation of the name Kastamonu:\n\nAccording to the first view, it should be considered that the name Kastamonu is Turkishized from the name Paphlagonía[Greek \"land of Paphlagon (people)\"]. The region covering the West Black Sea and Central Black Sea regions was called Paphlagonia before the Turks. Today, Kastamonu, Sinop, Bartın, Çankırı and Karabük are located in this region, while parts of Çorum, Bolu, Zonguldak and Samsun provinces remain within the region. The Paphlagonians, who dominated this region in 1000 BC, gave their name to this geography.[3]\n\nAccording to a second opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the name Kastama, which was used for the same region in the Hittite period. The name Kastama turned into Kastamonu over time.[4]\n\nAccording to another view, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Gas and Tumanna. Gas, or better known as Kashkas, are among the first settlers of Kastamonu. Tumanna is the name of a city/region located on Kastamonu at that time. The combination of these two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.[5]\n\nAccording to a third opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Kastra and Komnen. The word Kastra means \"castle\" in Latin. The Komnens are a Byzantine Dynasty and the settlers of this region during the Byzantine period. These two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.[6]\n\nWith the weakening of the Macedon kings, the Paphlagonia and Bithynia regions were engulfed by the newly formed Pontus kingdom. After the fall of the Pontus kingdom in first century BC, the area was incorporated by the Roman Empire by joining Paphlagonia with Bithynia. The capital center of this new city-state was Pompeiopolis, of which the remains still stand near Tasköprü District in Kastamonu.\n\nThe region then fell under the hegemony of the Seljuq dynasty (11th century AD), followed by the Danishmends, the Byzantines during the crusades, Çobanoğlu and Jandarid beyliks. The Ottoman sultan Beyazid I conquered the province in 1392; however, following his capture and death in Battle of Ankara, the area was granted back to the Çandaroğlu by the Mongol warlord Timur Lenk. Ottoman sultan Mehmed II incorporated the region back into the empire in 1461.\n\nDuring the Ottoman reign, the province boundaries were expanded up to reach Constantinople. The sultan's heirs were often sent to rule the province as governors to gain experience.\n\nAfter the First World War, during the battles of the Turkish War of Independence, Kastamonu played an important role in the supply of ammunition and troops to the İnebolu–Ankara front, transporting the war machines that would arrive to İnebolu by sea from Istanbul (Constantinople) and the Soviets. When the Greeks noticed this activity, the İnebolu port was bombarded from the sea on 9 June 1921.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe province is mostly covered with forests, thanks to the mild Black Sea climate. Ilgaz National Park, where a micro-climate dominates due to the mountainous terrain and numerous streams, is 63 km south of the province center of Kastamonu.\n\nIlgaz Mountain (highest peak 2587 m) dominates the south of the province where hiking and whitewater rafting is possible at the Ilgaz Stream.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, 77.5% of the labor force is occupied in agriculture. This ratio is higher than the country average. The second largest sector is public and private services (8.9%).\n\nAlmost all of the arable land has permanent crops. The agricultural products make up about of 0.01% of the total in Turkey. A large portion of the agricultural produce consists of cereals. Thanks to its widespread forest areas (a total of 57% of the surface area), forestry is also an important industry. Industries largely consist of manufacturing of forestry, agriculture and mining products.\n\nUnderground resources include copper, mercury, iron ore, chromium, manganese, asbestos, bauxite, graphite, phosphate, kaolinite, clay, limestone, quartz, marble, magnesite, fire clay, coal and nickel. There are also some natural thermal and mineral water springs, of which a few are suitable for economic investments.\n\nKastamonu shares about 0.4% of the GDP, the composition of the GDP is as follows (1998 est.):\n\nAgriculture: 32.8%\n\nCommunication and transport: 20%\n\nServices: 16.8%\n\nIndustry: 9.5%\n\nTransportation is possible only through paved and unpaved highways; a railroad that will connect Çankırı, Kastamonu and İnebolu is under construction.[when?] Although the province has a 135 km long coastline to Black Sea, only İnebolu has a small port and transportation by the sea is almost non-existent.\n\nThere are around 112,000 telephone main lines in use, about 200,000 cellphone subscribers and 15,000 Internet users in the province.[citation needed]\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n[edit]\n\nHandcrafts are abundant in Kastamonu, especially in rural areas. Most available are hand-woven textiles.\n\nSeveral national and local annual festivities also take place in the province.\n\nIn a research conducted in the province, 812 different food are identified that are specific to the region.\n\nThe provincial soccer team Kastamonuspor competes in the Bank Asya 1st League (1st National Soccer League).\n\nThe founder of the Turkish republic, Atatürk, declared the \"dress code reform\", which abolished the fez, in Kastamonu in 1925.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
