Manuel's grandson; Emperor Alexios I Komnenos probably founded the castle, maybe on an earlier predecessor, in the 12th century. That castle and city became known as \"Kastra Komnenon\", which later changed into Kastamone and Kastamoni, and finally into Kastamonu.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire lost control of Kastamonu in 1227. From then it was ruled by, first, the beylik (a Turkic principality) of the Chobanids, and then the beylik of the Isfendiyarids. In 1461 it finally came into the hands of the Ottomans.\n\nKastamonu Castle sits on a rocky outcrop in the center of the city. What remains today is mainly of Turkic architecture. The present castle actually was the inner castle of a larger fortification which circled the entire city. Those outer walls, however, have completely disappeared.\n\nThe castle was severely damaged during the 1943 Tosya–Ladik earthquake.
