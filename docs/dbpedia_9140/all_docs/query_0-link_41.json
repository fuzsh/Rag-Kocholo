Tables (As a separate file)\n\nTables should be presented within the main document after the reference list. All tables should be referred to within the main text and they should be numbered consecutively in the order they are referred to within the main text. A descriptive title should be provided for all tables and the titles should be placed above the tables. Abbreviations used in the tables should be defined below the tables (even if they are defined within the main text). Tables should be created using the “insert table” command of the word processing software and they should be arranged clearly to provide an easy reading. Tables, in particular, should be explanatory and facilitate readers’ understanding of the manuscript, and should not repeat data presented in the main text.\n\n2.5. Figures (As a separate file)\n\nFigures, graphics, and photographs should be submitted as separate files (in JPEG format) through the submission system. They should not be embedded in a Word document. When there are figure subunits, the subunits should not be merged to form a single image. Each subunit should be submitted separately through the submission system. Thick and thin arrows, arrowheads, stars, asterisks, and similar marks can be used on the images to support figure legends. Like the rest of the submission, the figures too should be blind. Any information within the images that may indicate an individual or institution should be blinded. The minimum resolution of each submitted figure should be 300DPI. To prevent delays in the evaluation process all submitted figures should be clear in resolution and large in size (minimum dimensions 100x100 mm)\n\n2.6. Ethics Committee Approval form (As a separate file)\n\nULAKBIM TR Index made some new regulations to the criteria of 2020 regarding ethical rules. These regulations are summarized below. Please submit your manuscript according to these rules. Authors should obtain the relevant documents and upload them to the system together with their ethical committee approval.\n\n1. \"Ethics Committee Approval\" is required for all kinds of research conducted with qualitative or quantitative approaches that require data collection from participants using survey, interview, focus group work, observation, experiment, and interview techniques.\n\n2. The articles should state whether an ethical committee permit and/or legal/special permission is required. If these approvals are required, they should be presented from which institution, on what date, and with which decision or number.\n\n3. \"Ethics Committee Approval\" is required for research using humans and animals (including materials/data) for experimental or other scientific purposes.\n\n4. If the study involves the use of human or animal subjects, the international declaration of the study, guidance, etc. must be declared that it is performed properly.\n\n5. \"Ethics Committee Approval\" is required for clinical studies on humans and animals.\n\n6. By the law on the protection of personal data, \"Ethics Committee Approval\" is needed for retrospective studies.\n\n* Retrospective ethics committee approval is not required for articles that were produced from postgraduate/doctoral studies using research data before 2020 (must be specified in the article) and were accepted for publication in the previous year, but have not yet been published.\n\n** In studies that require ethics committee approval, ethics committee approval will be shared with the journal editor. In addition, the name of the committee, the date, and the issue number will be stated in the method section of the article and the ethics committee approval section on the last page of the article.\n\n*** Researchers who are not members of the university can also apply to the Ethics Committees in their region.\n\n2.7. Copyright Agreement and Acknowledgement of Authorship Form\n\nThis is a statement of the scientific contributions and responsibilities of all authors. The form is available for download on the journal’s webpage.\n\nThe ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4 criteria:\n\n♦Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND\n\n♦Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND\n\n♦Final approval of the version to be published; AND\n\n♦Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.”\n\nA contributor should meet all four criteria to be identified as an author. If a contributor does not meet all four criteria, he/she should be acknowledged in the acknowledgments section of the manuscript.\n\nFor more details please refer to the ICMJE’s definition of the role of authors and contributors at http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html\n\n2.8.
