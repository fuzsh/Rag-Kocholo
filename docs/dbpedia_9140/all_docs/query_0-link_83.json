        "text": "ABSTRACT. This article studies temporal variations in wealth levels and distribution in an Ottoman context during the eighteenth century. By analysing the probate estate inventories of the Muslim deceased in Kastamonu, located in north-central Anatolia, we demonstrate that real wealth levels generally declined over the course of the century. Our analysis also suggests that the economic conditions of poor men, if not women, deteriorated more so than those of the rich, fuelling growing inequality.\n\nThis article examines the accumulation, temporal variation, and inequality of wealth in the Ottoman judiciary between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries. Using information from the estate inventories, we calculate the gross and net wealth of judges at the time of death. Comparisons against contemporary economic indicators show low to moderate levels of wealth accumulation among the judiciary. Wealth levels varied significantly across judiciary subgroups and they dropped drastically in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Regression analysis shows that differences in motives for bequests and family connections to other members of the judiciary contributed to the inequality of wealth.\n\nBy examining the fortunes of the 57 richest Muslims in Thessaloniki in the eighteenth century, this paper aims to contribute to the discussion on wealth accumulation in Ottoman lands. Basing our research on the probate inventories of the city, we attempt to delineate the profile of the rich in Thessaloniki. Our conclusions underline the role of credit and çiftlik exploitation in capital formation in the city. Furthermore, we suggest a distinct pattern regarding the existence or non-existence of magnate families in the Balkans which was distinct from the position in the Arab lands of the empire. Keywords probate inventories – Thessaloniki – urban economy – rich – eighteenth century The Ottoman eighteenth century is commonly described as a period of economic and social transition whose main feature was the incomplete integration of the Ottoman world into the gradually dominating world-economy. This is purported to constitute an analytical tool providing historians with a comprehensive herme-neutical schema of the developments in the eastern Mediterranean world during that period. The aim of this paper is not to explore the theoretical or factual per-plexities of this historiographic paradigm, but to contribute to the general discourse on capital formation at the dawn of modern times in the Ottoman world\n\nThis study examines the estate of tanner İbrâhîm bin 'Alî and its inheritance in eighteenth-century Istanbul from a social historical perspective. It enhances our understanding of the lives of workers and features of guilds in early modern Ottoman cities. First, I overview the state of İbrâhîm's estate at the time of his death and process of its inheritance by analyzing his probate inventory (tereke). Second, I compare these data with the relevant details of forty-four other retailers and artisans who lived in Istanbul. Subsequently, I analyze the status of İbrâhîm's property, his outstanding expenses, and debts owed by and to him in detail. Finally, I examine the court cases on his inheritance according to four relevant court records (i'lâms). My analysis reveals the relative affluence of İbrâhîm and the significant involvement of other tanners in determining the inheritance of his estate.\n\nThe power-law form of the upper part of the distribution of individual wealth/income (Pareto's law) is very well established for many countries and years. The Pareto index is however non-universal, varying typically from 1.5 to around 3. A recently introduced model for wealth exchange on an evolving family-network [Physica A 353, 515 (2005)] is reviewed and compared with empirical data. While the model mimics very well recent individual wealth data in a modern society (U.K.), it fails to explain results for a feudal society, based on the number of serf families owned by nobles (Hungary, mid XVI century). The unusually low (around 1) Pareto index found in this case is not compatible with the previous model. It is suggested that this fact may be interpreted as a result of the absence of active trading among agents."
