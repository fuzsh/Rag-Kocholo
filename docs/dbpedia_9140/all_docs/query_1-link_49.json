Expressions drenched in shock and awe as we captured photographs and appreciated the surrounding lush vegetations.\n\nIt is the perfect spot to unwind, capture memories, and appreciate the raw power and tranquility of nature.\n\nThe beauty of the trail masked over the longevity of the distance, making it a smooth hike for even the least enthusiastic of walkers.\n\nIlgaz Mountain National Park\n\nThe Ilgaz Mountain National Park is a nature lover’s paradise just waiting to be explored. Adorned by the giant greens, the majestic peaks of Mount Ilgaz offer a striking view.\n\nAs our legs hung over the distant paradise beneath, an overwhelming abundance of oak and fir trees, everything suddenly seemed small, minuscule and insignificant.\n\nTaking on a birds eye view as we were smoothly transported across the plains by telecabins offered by the ski resort, Ilgaz Yurduntepe Ski Centre, the scenery was nothing short of majestic.\n\nShortly after, we landed atop a hill that overlooked the rest of the forest – known to house a rich array of wildlife, including brown bears, grey wolves, and rare bird species.\n\nDuring the winter months, the park transforms into a snow-covered wonderland, attracting winter sports enthusiasts. Skiing and snowboarding are popular activities that allow visitors to make the most of the pristine slopes and powdery snow.\n\nAzdavay Equestrian Centre\n\nSet against the backdrop of green hills and meadows, the Azdavay Equestrian Centre offers a unique experience for riders of all levels, as well as those simply seeking a connection with these majestic animals.\n\nThe cozy restaurant there offers local food and dishes unique to the area, adding to the exciting palette experience during the trip. No doubt, the dishes are sure to be especially exhilarating for avid foodies and adventurous eaters.\n\nCatak Kanyon Glass Terace\n\nPerched on the edge of a natural splendour in the Catak Canyon, the glass terrace offers a thrilling experience that combines adrenaline-pumping excitement packed with beautiful panoramic views.\n\nSuspended high above the rugged Catak Canyon, this glass platform is a must-visit destination for adventurers seeking an unforgettable encounter with nature.\n\nThe canyon stretches out before you, revealing its majestic cliffs and cascading waterfalls.\n\nThe sound of the serene waterfalls becomes one with the green and grand scenery beneath your feet.\n\nSafranbolu\n\nThe town of Safranbolu, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is renowned for its well-preserved Ottoman architecture, cobblestone streets, and warming atmosphere.\n\nExplore the historic Safranbolu Houses, visit the Cinci Han Caravanserai, and immerse yourself in the vibrant local markets.\n\nSafranbolu also offers a delightful culinary experience with its traditional Turkish cuisine and local delicacies."
