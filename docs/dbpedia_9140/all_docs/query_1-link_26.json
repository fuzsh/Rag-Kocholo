        "text": "Kastamonu food and beverage It has a rich cuisine. The main reason for this wealth is; It is the existence of various animals in the vegetation and grown based on nature.\n\nbiryanWhen the meat is to be cooked in the shop, the same process is applied by lighting a fire in a well built under the chimney in one corner of the shop. There is an iron circle at the mouth of the furnace in the shop and slots for the diameter iron. This furnace is made of brick and is used for a long time. When the biryan is to be cooked, a basin is lowered over the embers into which the fat and water of the meat will flow. It is the most acceptable food to be served to a guest in Kastamonu. Biryan is only eaten by hand. Onions and ayran are definitely requested. It is also eaten as a pilaf with rice. It is also possible to obtain rice by placing rice in the sheep that is hung in the well by custom-made.\n\nIn addition to wild herbs, plants, mushrooms, wild strawberries used as food, all kinds of vegetables and many fruits are grown in Kastamonu soil. Turkey's most beautiful and high quality garlic is grown and exported in this province.\n\nUryan plumIt is possible to dine only in Kastamonu. A compilation of 812 types of food belonging to Kastamonu region was made. Among them, 38 kinds of soup and 51 kinds of bread recipes can be seen.\n\nThe famous food of Kastamonu cuisine is \"meaty bread\" cooked on a sheet metal. A glass of buttermilk, “sour – sour” or “bread with meat”pelverde paste” can no longer forget the name of Kastamonu. The soup of the winter food “tarhana” prepared in Kastamonu is the most nutritious soup. A wide variety of plant extracts in the flour – yoghurt dough used in its preparation make the taste-flavor different. It also increases the nutritional value. The taste of the \"doner\", which locals and visitors can not stop eating every season, cooked over coal fire is insatiable. The \"bacon bread\" made in the winter season is another delicacy. Specially prepared “grassless pastrami” is cut into thin slices, mixed with onion piyaz, added in enough spices, placed in the dough opened in the oven, covered, after cooked, after being greased with more or less butter according to taste, it is eaten with pleasure.\n\nWith the arrival of spring, the growth of lambs, another local food, \"biran\" - a well appears. A'an is a famous meat dish cooked in Kastamonu center and especially in Taşköprü district. \"Cucked Halva\", which has been used in desserts for centuries, is unique to the region with its special preparation by hand and fine flavor strands. It is an accepted gift that everyone who goes out of the province buys their friends. Another local food of winter days, Kastamonu bagel,bagel treadis . Those who cannot eat the bagel tirid, on their way out of the province, always bring a series of “Kastamonu bagels” to their friends and colleagues.\n\nBarley YarmasThe soup, which is also known as ı, Göçe soup or Akdene soup, is the main ingredient of the soup, which is mostly known in the villages of Araba district, with cracked barley, yoghurt or ayran. The split barley is cooked thoroughly in a caba (earth pot) or pot, and oil, yogurt (if not, ayran) is added to it. By adding mint on it, it becomes a ready-to-eat soup.\n\nMaking the split barley: The barley is cleaned by turning in a sieve, washed, the barley dried in the sun is taken to the mill and cracked like bulgur.\n\nThe weight of pastries in Kastamonu and its region is also evident in soups. We can show soup dough as Tatar, vermicelli, handle and spread.\n\nTatar Soup: Minced meat, garlic and oil are the other ingredients of the soup, which is based on cooking 1×1 gin dough in boiling water. The soup known around Şenpazar and Azdavay is also known as garlic soup. It is called as cut soup in soup Ağlı, dough soup in Arac. While lentil dough (lentil tatar) soup is made by adding lentils, this soup is called mankır soup in Inebolu.\n\nNoodles, on the other hand, are thin slices of dough of 1,5 or XNUMX cm in length. Rice is added or cooked simply and butter is poured. Minced meat in some parts of tosyal. Different properties are given by adding milk around Daday. This is called milk noodles. Doughs cut into triangles in the shape of nuska are called noodles, and in some places they are called Tatars.\n\nTutmaç soupIt is not much different from Tatar soup. It is known in the vicinity of Vehicle and Tosya. In addition to the minced meat, the ingredients are garlic yogurt and oil. It can be seen around lentils and rice. (Tosya and Devrekani)\n\nSpread Soup\n\nAfter the rolled phyllo dough is tapped for a while, it is handed and rolled. While rice is added to this soup in Bozkurt, it is called milk broadcast by adding milk in Şeyçiler.\n\nPull Halva\n\nPulled halva is one of Kastamonu's souvenirs and is very popular in other provinces. Its raw materials are kadaif, non-essential flour, sugar, oil and water.\n\nMaking halva starts with making roux. Edible margarine is melted in a medium-sized boiler in the workshop. Flour is put in it. It is cooked by mixing flour and oil on low heat for about an hour. The licorice is left to cool.\n\nThe sugar furnace is prepared. 20 kg. granulated sugar is put in a cauldron, mixed with water and dissolved. Add lemon salt to it. Boil for another half hour. When the melted sugar has the consistency of hard sugar, it is taken from the stove. The marble is poured into the cooling stone. The cooled sugar is collected from the cooling stone and put into a special bleaching machine. It is bleached by frying until it turns white. Bleached sugar taken from the machine is brought side by side with roux at normal temperature. It's time for the halva maker team of 4-5 people to work. The bleached sugar is formed into a large ring. It is extended by being dipped in licorice and pulled from hand to hand. This is the reason why it is called pulled halva. The stretched sugar, soaked in licorice, eventually becomes white fibres. The sugar, which has become white fibers, is placed on the marble and divided into small pieces. It is filled into trays and compressed by pressing. Thus, a compressed, flour-like halva filled to the rim of the tray is obtained. It is sold in the form of baklava slices on a tray or by obtaining square slices. In recent years, manufacturers have added hazelnut, coconut and cocoa to rolled halvah and marketed their colorful varieties. Asli; white is the plain form. Halva is made in the same way in Mudurnu, only butter is used instead of margarine.\n\nBread with meat\n\nFirst, the sheet on which the bread will be baked is prepared. The top of the sheet is wiped well, the bottom and the hollow side is wetted and covered with ash half a centimeter thick. The reason why the gold of the sheet is ashen is so that it does not get very angry and burn the bread.\n\nThen the hand is prepared. Finely chop two peeled onions, half a bunch of parsley, and green pepper if desired. It is poured over the ground beef in a saucepan. Black pepper, cumin, salt are also added. Mix the ground meat and flavorings with a little water. By mixing with a wooden spoon, the meat is made to be spread on the dough like paste. This material is the part that will be put into the bread. The prepared mixture is put on hold. Meanwhile, onions, spices, parsley mix well with the meat. The meat becomes a seasoning. In the past, minced meat was prepared by finely chopping the meat on a meat kündesi.\n\nIt's time to prepare the dough. Unleavened dough is kneaded from pastry flour in a dough vat or dough bowl. Mix two eggs into the dough.\n\nWhile kneading the dough or preparing the meat, a person also prepares the \"cold\" to be eaten or drunk with the bread.
