It is approximately 115 meters high. It is known that the castle was built by the Komnenos. Its construction dates back to the 12th century. The outer walls of the castle, known to go down to Kara√ßomak Creek, have not survived to the present day.\n\nHistorical Kastamonu Castle is also an ideal location to view the city from the top."
