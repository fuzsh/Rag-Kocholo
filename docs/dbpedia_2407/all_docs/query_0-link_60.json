        "text": "'The Courier' (later the Courier Mail) of 8 December 1909, published a timeline of Queensland's history from the time of separation to the 50th Anniversary of the same, 1859 - 1908. For some reason they did not include the year that had just been, perhaps that was recorded in another edition.\n\nQUEENSLAND'S HALF CENTURY 1859 TO 1909 NOTABLE EVENTS (1909, December 8). The Brisbane Courier (Qld. : 1864 - 1933), p. 23 (Queensland's Half Century). Retrieved December 13, 2020, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19579953\n\nTo tell this story they reached back a few years before to set the context. I republish the list here unabridged as it appears in Trove. The original also included photographs which I have deleted, mostly because the image quality in the Trove Version is insufficient to justify publishing.\n\nThis long read is an interesting exercise in historical significance. What does a state as yet untouched by World Wars view as significant? Shipping, railways and churches are but three of the big themes I quickly found. What lens do they see the original custodians of the land? There is a clear link between race and criminality.\n\nI have brought this information across into a spreadsheet to allow for the addition of keywords, and easier importing into other history projects.
