        "text": "Dragons playmaker Kyle Flanagan has been referred directly to the NRL Judiciary following an incident arising from his side's loss to the Bulldogs on Saturday night.\n\nBulldogs captain Stephen Crichton accused Flanagan of biting him on the nose during the clash at Netstrata Jubilee Stadium.\n\nThe incident occurred in the 62nd minute of the match after Crichton tackled Flanagan and the Canterbury star pushed down on his opponent with his face.\n\nCrichton appeared to have a bloodied nose after getting up to his feet from the tackle.\n\nThe star centre did not make an on-field complaint to referee Gerard Sutton but was clearly upset by the incident. He and a Bulldogs trainer spoke to an NRL official after the match.\n\nCrichton did not attend the post-match press conference, as he usually would in his capacity as Canterbury captain, with Viliame Kikau deputising for him.\n\nBulldogs coach Cameron Ciraldo said Crichton was receiving treatment, but he was reluctant to discuss the allegation.\n\n“His nose is a bit swollen. He’s getting a few things checked. I don’t know what to say about it. I’ll leave it there,\" Ciraldo said.\n\nOther charges from Saturday night's matches sees Broncos fullback Reece Walsh charged for a Shoulder Charge in his side's win over the Cowboys. He will receive a $1500 fine with an early guilty plea.\n\nCowboys hooker Reece Robson has accepted an early guilty plea for a Grade 1 Contrary Conduct charge from the same match and will receive a $1000 fine.\n\nThere was just one charge from Sunday afternoon's matches, with Warriors forward Dylan Walker hit with a Grade 1 Careless High Tackle charge.\n\nThe lock is facing a $1000 fine if he takes the early guilty plea or $1500 if he fights and loses at the judiciary.\n\nThe Panthers could be without Origin and Test back-rower Liam Martin for their top of the table showdown against Melbourne after was charged with Dangerous Contact following the win over the Eels.\n\nMartin made contact with the leg of Eels kicker Daejarn Asi in the 61st minute at CommBank Stadium and is facing a one-week ban if he pleads guilty to the Grade 2 offence.\n\nShould Martin challenge the charge and be found guilty at the judiciary he will be banned for two games.\n\nTitans prop Moeaki Fotuaika has been charged with a Grade 2 Careless High Tackle on Sharks hooker Cameron McInnes and faces a one-game ban with an early guilty plea.\n\nFotuaika's ban will increase to two games should he fight the charge at the judiciary and be unsuccessful.\n\nFellow Titan David Fifita has been hit with a Grade 1 Shoulder Charge offence and will be fined $1500 with an early guilty plea.\n\nSharks forward Billy Burns has been charged with a Careless High Tackle and faces a $750 fine should he enter an early guilty plea.\n\nRabbitohs centre Taane Milne faces a substantial fine for a tripping offence in Thursday night's loss to the Storm.\n\nThe incident involving Ryan Papenhuzen in the 65th minute at Accor Stadium has been assessed as a Grade 1 Dangerous Contact offence.\n\nAs this is Milne's third and subsequent offence of this nature he will be fined $3000 with an early guilty plea.\n\nShould he challenge the charge and be found guilty at the judiciary, Milne would be banned for two matches.\n\nLatest Judiciary Charges\n\nRound 23 - Thursday night\n\nRound 23 - Friday night\n\nRound 23 - Saturday night\n\nRound 23 - Sunday afternoon\n\nYour team's Judiciary Report\n\nBroncos |
