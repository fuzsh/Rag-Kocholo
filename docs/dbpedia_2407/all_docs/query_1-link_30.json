        "text": "A two-time winner and five-time nominee of the Academy Award, A. R. Rahman is popularly known as the man who has redefined contemporary Indian music. Rahman, according to a BBC estimate, has sold more than 150 million copies of his work comprising of music from more than 100 film soundtracks and albums across over half a dozen languages, including landmark scores such as \"Roja\", \"Bombay\", \"Dil Se\", \"Taal\", \"Lagaan\", \"Vandemataram\", \"Jodhaa Akbar\", \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"127 Hours\".\n\nRahman pursued music as a career at a very young age. After assisting leading musicians in India, he went on to compose jingles and scores for popular Indian television features. He also obtained a degree in western classical music from the Trinity College of Music, London and set up his own in-house studio called Panchathan Record-Inn in Chennai. In 1991, noted filmmaker Mani Ratnam offered Rahman a movie called \"Roja\" which was a run-away success and brought nationwide fame and acclaim to the composer. The movie also won Rahman the Indian National Award for Best Music Composer, the first time ever by a debut. Since then, Rahman has gone on to win the National Award three more times - the most ever by any music composer.\n\nIn 1997, to commemorate 50 years of Indian Independence, Sony Music signed Rahman as its first artist in South Asia. The result was \"Vande Mataram\", an album that instantly and successfully rekindled the spirit of patriotism among Indians around the world. In 2001, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, renowned music composer of musicals including \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", invited Rahman to compose for his musical, \"Bombay Dreams\", which was the first production that Sir Webber did not compose for. \"Bombay Dreams\" opened to packed houses at London's West End and had an unprecedented run for two years. The show later premiered in New York. In 2005, Rahman composed the score for the stage production of \"The Lord of the Rings\", one of the most expensive productions mounted on stage.\n\nIn 2008, Rahman's work gained global prominence with the extraordinary success of his score for \"Slumdog Millionaire\" that won eight Academy Awards including two for Rahman - Best Score and Best Song. Rahman won over 15 awards for this score including two Grammys, the Golden Globe and the BAFTA. Rahman's music led him to be noticed internationally with several of his tracks featured in movies such as \"The Lord of War\", \"Inside Man\" and \"The Accidental Husband\". His composition, \"Bombay Theme\" holds the distinction for being featured in over 50 international compilations. Aside from \"Slumdog Millionaire\", he also scored the music for Hollywood productions, \"Elizabeth - The Golden Age\", \"Couples Retreat\", \"127 Hours\", \"People Like Us\", \"Warriors of Heaven & Earth\", \"The 100 Foot Journey\", \"Million Dollar Arm\" and \"Pele\".\n\nRahman has been conferred with honorary doctorates from the Trinity College of Music, Aligarh Muslim University, Anna University, Middlesex University and Berklee College of Music. In 2009, he was featured in Time Magazine's \"Time100: The Most Influential People.\"\n\nIn 2011, Rahman joined a super band, SuperHeavy, comprised of Mick Jagger, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and Dave Stewart. Rahman has collaborated with several other international artists including Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Michael Jackson, Michael Bolton, MIA, Vanessa Mae, the Pussycat Dolls, Sarah Brightman, Dido, Hossam Ramzy, Hans Zimmer and Akon.\n\nRahman remains one of the few mainstream artists whose works have been performed live by the likes of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, Babelsberg Film Orchestra and the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.\n\nRahman has expanded his focus to newer horizons including the establishment of the A. R. Rahman Foundation to help poor and underprivileged children. Rahman has also announced initiatives to establish a tradition in western classical music in India and has embarked on an ambitious venture to set up the KM Music Conservatory and the KM Music Symphony Orchestra based out of Chennai, India.\n\nEnglish film actor, director and author Andy Serkis is known for his performance capture roles comprising motion capture acting, animation and voice work for such computer-generated characters as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001-2003) and Der Hobbit: Eine unerwartete Reise (2012), the eponymous King Kong in the 2005 film, Caesar in Planet der Affen: Prevolution (2011) and Planet der Affen: Revolution (2014), Captain Haddock / Sir Francis Haddock in Steven Spielberg's Die Abenteuer von Tim und Struppi - Das Geheimnis der Einhorn (2011) and Supreme Leader Snoke in Star Wars - Episode VII: Das Erwachen der Macht (2015). Serkis earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for his portrayal of serial killer Ian Brady in the British television film Die Moormörderin von Manchester (2006), and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of new wave and punk rock musician Ian Dury in the biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll (2010). In 2015, he had a small role in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Serkis has his own motion capture workshop, The Imaginarium Studios in London, which he will use for his directorial debut, Mogli: Legende des Dschungels (2018).\n\nAndrew Clement G. Serkis was born April 20, 1964, in Ruislip Manor, West London, England. He has three sisters and a brother. His father, Clement Serkis, an ethnic Armenian whose original family surname was Serkissian, was a medical doctor working abroad, in Iraq; the Serkis family spent time around the Middle East, and for the first ten years of his life, Andy traveled between Baghdad and London. His mother, Lylie (Weech), who is British-born, was busy working as a special education teacher of handicapped children, so Andy and his four siblings were raised with au pairs in the house. Young Serkis wanted to be an artist; he was fond of painting and drawing, and visualized himself working behind the scenes. He attended St. Benedict's School, a Roman Catholic School for boys at the Benedictine Abbey in London. Serkis studied visual arts at Lancaster University in the north-west of England. There, he became involved in mechanical aspects of the theatre and did stage design and set building for theatrical productions. Then, Serkis was asked to play a role in a student production, and made his stage debut in Barrie Keeffe's play, \"Gotcha\"; thereafter, he switched from stage design to acting, which was a real calling that transformed his life.\n\nInstead of going to an acting college, Serkis, in 1985, began his professional acting career at the Duke's Playhouse in Lancaster, where he was given an Equity card and performed in fourteen plays, one after another, as an apprentice of Jonathan Petherbridge. After that, he worked in touring theatre companies, doing it for no money, fueled by a sense of enthusiasm, moving to a new town every week. He has thus appeared in a host of popular plays and on almost every renowned British stage. In 1989, he appeared in a stage production of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", so beginning his long association with the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, where he would return many times, to appear in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"Your Home in the West\" and the \"True Nature of Love\", among other plays. In the 1990s, Serkis began to make his mark on the London stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre as \"The Fool\" in \"King Lear\", making his interpretation of \"The Fool\" as the woman that \"Lear\", a widower, could relate to - a man, in drag, as a Victorian musician. He also appeared as \"Potts\" in the hit play, \"Mojo\", playing in front of full houses and earning huge critical success. In 1987, Serkis made his debut on television, and he acted in several major British TV miniseries throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn 1999, Andy Serkis landed the prize role of \"Gollum\" in Peter Jackson's epic film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's saga, \"The Lord of the Rings\". He spent four years in the part and received awards and nominations for his performance as \"Gollum\", a computer-generated character in Der Herr der Ringe: Die Rückkehr des Königs (2003), which won 11 Oscars. \"Gollum\" was the collaborative team's effort around Serkis's work in performance capture - an art form based on CGI-assisted acting. Serkis's work was an interactive performance in a skin-tight CGI suit with markers allowing cameras to track and register 3D position for each marker. Serkis' every nuance was picked up by several cameras positioned at precisely calculated angles to allow for the software to see enough information to process the image. The images of Serkis' performances were translated into the digital format by animators at Weta Digital studio in New Zealand. There, his image was key-frame animated and then edited into the movie, Serkis did have one scene in \"The Return of the King\" showing how he originally had the ring, killing another hobbit to posses it after they found it during a fishing trip. He drew from his three cats clearing fur balls out of their throats to develop the constricted voice he produced for \"Gollum\" and \"Sméagol\", and it was also enhanced by sound editing in post-production.\n\nSerkis spent almost two years in New Zealand and away from his family, and much of 2002 and 2003 in post-production studios for large periods of time, due to complexity of the creative process of bringing the character of \"Gollum\" to the screen. Serkis had to shoot two versions for every scene; one version was with him on camera, acting with (chiefly) Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, which served both to show Wood and Astin the moves so that they could precisely interact with the movements of \"Gollum\", and to provide the CGI artists the subtleties of Gollum's physical movements and facial expressions for their manual finishing of the animated images. In the other version, he'd go the voice off-camera, as Wood and Astin repeated their movements as though \"Gollum\" were there with them; that take would be the basis for inserting the CGI Gollum used in the released movie. In post-production, Serkis was doing motion-capture wearing a skintight motion capture suit with CGI gear while acting as a virtual puppeteer redoing every single scene in the studio. Additional CGI rotomation was done by animators using the human eye instead of the computer to capture the subtleties of Serkis' performance. Serkis also used this art form in his performance as \"Kong\" in King Kong (2005), which won him a Toronto Film Critics Association Award (2005) for his unprecedented work helping to realize the main character in \"King Kong\", and a Visual Effects Society Award (2006) for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Motion Picture.\n\nApart from his line of CGI-driven characters, Serkis continued with traditional acting in several leading and supporting roles, such as his appearances as \"Richard Kneeland\" opposite Jennifer Garner in 30 über Nacht (2004), and \"Alley\" opposite David Bowie in Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), among other film performances. On television, he starred as 'Vincent Van Gogh' in the sixth episode of Simon Schama's Power of Art (2006), the BBC2 series about artists. Serkis is billed as \"Capricorn\" in the upcoming adventure film, Tintenherz (2008). At the same time, he continued the development of performance capture while expanding his career into computer games. He starred as \"King Bothan\" in the martial arts drama, Heavenly Sword (2007), a Playstation 3 title, for which he provided a basis for his in-game face and also acts as a dramatic director on the project.\n\nAndy Serkis married actress and singer Lorraine Ashbourne, and the couple have three children: daughter Ruby Serkis (born in 1998), and two sons Sonny Serkis (born in 2000) and Louis Ashbourne Serkis (born on 19 June 2004), who is now also a movie star. Away from acting, Andy Serkis is an accomplished amateur painter. Since his school years at Lancaster, being so close to the Lake District, Serkis developed his other passion in life: mountaineering. He is a pescetarian. Serkis has been active in charitable causes, such as The Hope Foundation, which provides essential life-saving medical aid for children suffering from Leukemia and children from countries devastated by war. In October 2006, he was a presenter at the first annual British Academy Video Games Awards at the Roundhouse, London. Andy Serkis lives with his family in North London, England.\n\nGeoffrey Roy Rush was born on July 6, 1951, in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, to Merle (Bischof), a department store sales assistant, and Roy Baden Rush, an accountant for the Royal Australian Air Force. His mother was of German descent and his father had English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He was raised in Brisbane, Queensland, after his parents split up.\n\nRush attended Everton Park State High School during his formative years. His early interest in the theatre led to his 1971 stage debut at age 20 in \"Wrong Side of the Moon\" with the Queensland Theatre Company.\n\nKnown for his classical repertory work over the years, he scored an unexpected hit with his Queensland role as Snoopy in the musical \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\". A few years later he moved to France to study but subsequently returned to his homeland within a short time and continued work as both actor and director with the Queensland company (\"June and the Paycock,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Godspell,\" \"Present Laughter,\" \"The Rivals\"). In the 1980s Rush became a vital member of the State Theatre Company of South Australia and showed an equally strong range there in such productions as \"Revenger's Tragedy,\" \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" \"Mother Courage...and Her Children,\" \"Blood Wedding,\" \"Pal Joey,\" \"Twelfth Night\" and as The Fool in \"King Lear\".\n\nRush made an inauspicious debut in films with the feature Hoodwink (1981), having little more than a bit part, and didn't carry off his first major role until playing Sir Andrew Aguecheek in a movie production of Twelfth Night (1986). Yet, he remained a durable presence on stage with acclaimed productions in \"The Diary of a Madman\" in 1989 and \"The Government Inspector\" in 1991.\n\nRush suffered a temporary nervous breakdown in 1992 due to overwork and anguish over his lack of career advancement. Resting for a time, he eventually returned to the stage. Within a few years film-goers finally began taking notice of Geoffrey after his performance in Children of the Revolution (1996). This led to THE role of a lifetime as the highly dysfunctional piano prodigy David Helfgott in Shine - Der Weg ins Licht (1996). Rush's astonishing tour-de-force performance won him every conceivable award imaginable, including the Oscar, Golden Globe, British Film Award and Australian Film Institute Award.\n\n\"Shine\" not only put Rush on the international film map, but atypically on the Hollywood \"A\" list as well. His rather homely mug was made fascinating by a completely charming, confident and captivating demeanor; better yet, it allowed him to more easily dissolve into a number of transfixing historical portrayals, notably his Walsingham in Elizabeth (1998) and Leon Trotsky in Frida (2002). He's also allowed himself to have a bit of hammy fun in such box office escapism as Mystery Men (1999), Haunted Hill (1999), Groupies Forever (2002), Findet Nemo (2003) and Fluch der Karibik (2003). More than validating his early film success, two more Oscar nominations came his way in the same year for Quills - Macht der Besessenheit (2000) (best actor) and Shakespeare in Love (1998) (support actor) in 2000. Geoffrey's amazing versatility continued into the millennium with his portrayal of the manic, volatile comedy genius Peter Sellers in the biopic Das Leben und der Tod von Peter Sellers (2004). He also merited attention as Lionel Logue in The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010), Basil Hunter in Im Auge des Sturms (2011), Hans Hubermann in Die Bücherdiebin (2013), artist/sculptor Alberto Giocometti in Final Portrait (2017) and Michael Kingley Storm Boy (2019).\n\nRush's intermittent returns to the stage have included productions of \"Marat-Sade,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" \"Oleanna,\" \"Hamlet\" and \"The Small Poppies\". In 2009 he made his Broadway debut in \"Exit the King\" co-starring Susan Sarandon. His marriage (since 1988) to Aussie classical actress Jane Menelaus produced daughter Angelica (1992) and son James (1995). Menelaus, who has also performed with the State Theatre of South Australia, has co-starred on stage with Rush in \"The Winter's Tale\" (1987), \"Troilus and Cressida\" (1989) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (as Gwendolyn to his Jack Worthing). She also had featured roles in a few of his films, including Quills - Macht der Besessenheit (2000) and Im Auge des Sturms (2011)."
