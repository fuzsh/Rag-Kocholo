Please note that these information sheets have not been created for all former employees.\n\nBiographical sheets provide a good starting point for research but are not a comprehensive source of information on an individual; there may be other related records in the HBCA holdings. The information included in the biographical sheets has been derived from HBCA records and other sources; however, verification of facts against the original or microfilmed records is advisable.\n\nEmployee biographical sheets are organized alphabetically by surname. Spellings of names may vary."
