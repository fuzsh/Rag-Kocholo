        "text": "Middlesex Guildhall Art Collection\n\nThe collection commemorates many former Lords Lieutenants, judges, magistrates and politicians, and includes a rare opportunity to compare portraits of the 1st Duke of Northumberland by both Gainsborough and Reynolds.\n\nHenry Pownall, by Eden Upton Eddis\n\nDuke of Northumberland, by Thomas Gainsborough\n\nEarl of Northumberland, by Sir Joshua Reynolds\n\nWilliam Mainwaring, by Gainsborough Dupont\n\nBaptist Hicks, attributed to Paul van Somer\n\nGeorge III tapestry\n\nLocation of art works at the UKSC\n\nHenry Pownall, by Eden Upton Eddis\n\nJ.G. Henry Pownall (1792-1880) was a JP and Chairman of Middlesex Quarter Sessions. He was a generous philanthropist, supporting the construction of new churches and schools, and giving money to the campaign against slavery.\n\nDetails\n\nOil on canvas\n\n93¼ x 57 in. (2368 x 1448 mm)\n\nFrame style: gallery\n\nA plaque attached to the frame reads ‘Henry Pownall Esqre’. This painting is displayed in meeting room 3 of The Supreme Court building.\n\nAbout the sitter\n\nJ.G. Henry Pownall (?1792-1871) was a JP and Chairman of Middlesex Quarter Sessions. He was a generous philanthropist, supporting the construction of new churches and schools, and giving money to the campaign against slavery.\n\nAs a devoted Anglo-catholic, he was a strong opponent of the Papacy and the introduction of the Apocrypha into British Bibles. His son, Frederick Hyde Pownall (1832-1907) was an architect of the second Middlesex Guildhall and Wandsworth Prison.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nEden Upton Eddis (1812-1901) learnt to draw at a school run by Henry Sass in Bloomsbury before being admitted to the Royal Academy Schools in 1828 where he won a silver medal.\n\nHaving toured Europe, he exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1834 to 1883. Initially he specialised in landscapes, but gradually launched himself as a popular portrait painter. In 1883 he began to go deaf, withdrew from London society, and moved from Harley Street to Shalford near Guildford in Surrey, where he continued to paint.\n\nConservation\n\n2009: Both painting and frame were assessed as stable, but would benefit from future conservation and restoration. The painting was re-framed with measures to provide protection from dust at the reverse.\n\nBack to top\n\nDuke of Northumberland, by Thomas Gainsborough\n\nHugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland (c1714-1786) was a prominent politician who served as Privy Counsellor from 1762, and Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex from 1763 to 1786.\n\nDetails\n\nOil on canvas\n\n90½ x 59 in. (2299 x 1499 mm)\n\nFrame style: Neoclassic, with entwined laurel-stem guilloche between pearled and palmette-wrapped borders, designed in the George III ‘antique’ manner of the 1760s.\n\nThis painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1783. It is now displayed in the law library of The Supreme Court building.\n\nAbout the sitter\n\nHugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland (c1714-1786) was a prominent politician who served as Privy Counsellor from 1762, Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex from 1763 to 1786.\n\nAfter marrying an indirect heiress of the Percy family, one of England’s leading landowners, he spent much effort embellishing Northumberland House, Sion House and Alnwick Castle, employing James Paine, Robert Adam and Capability Brown.\n\nOne of his illegitimate children, James Smithson (1764-1829) was a chemist and mineralogist who founded the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nThomas Gainsborough (c 1727-1788) was one of the most famous portrait and landscape painters of 18th century Britain.\n\nHaving trained in his early teens under the London engraver Hubert Gravelot, he developed his client base from local merchants and squires to important society commissions including George III and Queen Charlotte. In 1783 he quarrelled with the Royal Academy: in 1784 the King had to appoint Sir Joshua Reynolds as royal painter even though he seemed to prefer Gainsborough.\n\nGainsborough was both technically proficient and highly experimental, painting very thinly with long, broad brushes. Unlike many contemporaries, he only had one assistant, his nephew Gainsborough Dupont who also contributed to the Middlesex Art Collection.\n\nConservation\n\n2007/9: Discoloured varnish and disfiguring over paint was removed and the painting was re-varnished. A technical report on its pigments, media etc was carried out by the Department of Conservation & Technology at the Courtauld Institute of Art, which will contribute to the wider knowledge of Gainsborough’s technique. The frame also underwent substantial restoration, with losses repaired and features re-created where they were missing, and top layers of non-original gilding were removed to a near-original layer.\n\n2009: The painting was re-framed with measures to provide protection from dust at the reverse.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Earl of Northumberland, by Sir Joshua Reynolds\n\nHugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland (c1714-1786) was a prominent politician who served as Privy Counsellor from 1762, and Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex from 1763 to 1786.\n\nDetails\n\nOil on canvas\n\n94 x 58 in. (2388 x 1473 mm)\n\nFrame style: Rococo, carved and gilded, by the famous firm of Thomas Chippendale.\n\nThis painting is displayed in Court Room 3 of The Supreme Court building.\n\nAbout the sitter\n\nHugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland (c1714-1786) was a prominent politician who served as Privy Counsellor from 1762, Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex from 1763 to 1786. This portrait was painted in 1762, before he received his full Dukedom in 1766.\n\nAfter marrying an indirect heiress of the Percy family, one of England’s leading landowners, he spent much effort embellishing Northumberland House, Sion House and Alnwick Castle, employing James Paine, Robert Adam and Capability Brown.\n\nOne of his illegitimate children, James Smithson (1764-1829) was a chemist and mineralogist who founded the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) was one of the most important and influential 18th century English painters, specialising in portraits and promotion of the ‘Grand Style’.\n\nApprenticed to the fashionable London portrait painter, Thomas Hudson, he studied in Italy, France and the Netherlands. When in London, his circle included Dr Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Edmund Burke, David Garrick and fellow artist Angelica Kaufmann.\n\nHe was a prolific and high earning portraitist, who may have painted as many as three thousand portraits of the famous and wealthy. He was a founder member of the Royal Academy and was made the first President in 1768, a position he held until his death.\n\nUnfortunately many of his pictures suffered from premature and unusual cracking, with colours fading in ways that often make it difficult to judge the original appearance.\n\nConservation\n\n2004/5: Discoloured varnish was removed, with some filling of old damages, re-touching and re-varnishing. The frame was also fully restored and re-gilded.\n\n2008/9: Strip lining was carried out using polyester, to support the brittle original tacking edge. The painting was re-varnished, the frame was cleaned very gently and thoroughly, and some minor repairs and re-gilding were carried out.\n\n2009: The painting was re-framed with measures to provide protection from dust at the reverse.\n\nBack to top\n\nWilliam Mainwaring, by Gainsborough Dupont\n\nWilliam Mainwaring was MP for Middlesex from 1784, and served as Chairman of the Middlesex and Westminster Quarter Sessions.\n\nDetails\n\nOil on canvas\n\n93 x 60½ in. (2362 x 1537 mm)\n\nFrame style: Gallery\n\nThis painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1793. It is now displayed in Court Room 3 of The Supreme Court building.\n\nAbout the sitter\n\nWilliam Mainwaring was MP for Middlesex from 1784, and served as Chairman of the Middlesex and Westminster Quarter Sessions.\n\nHe became embroiled in a dispute with the radical Francis Burdett when he refused demands for an inquiry into prison abuses. This long-running dispute was fought out in elections and reflects the inflammatory nature of much late eighteenth century politics.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nGainsborough Dupont (1754-1797) was a painter and mezzotint engraver. As a nephew of Thomas Gainsborough through his mother’s family, he was apprenticed to his uncle in Bath in 1772, and moved with him to London.\n\nAfter studying at the Royal Academy Schools, he became his uncle’s studio assistant, making engravings and small-scale copies of his uncle’s works. Seemingly, he was diffident and modest, yet from 1790, he exhibited both portraits and landscapes at the Royal Academy.\n\nAfter Thomas Gainsborough died in 1788, Dupont continued to produce engravings in his uncle’s studio. From this time, his own painting became more personal, but it is still difficult to distinguish much of his earlier work from that of his uncle.\n\nConservation\n\n2006: The frame was cleaned and some repairs to the flaking gilding were carried out.\n\n2007/8: More work was carried out on the frame to replace the running leaf pattern where necessary.\n\n2008/9: The painting’s varnish was removed; it had been heavily over-painted probably to disguise severe drying cracks and wear (from earlier cleaning regimes). Retouching was carried out using a varnish and dry pigments, and the painting was re-varnished. The brittle tacking edge of the canvas was strengthened by strip lining.\n\n2009: The painting was re-framed with measures to provide protection from dust at the reverse.\n\nBack to top\n\nSir Baptist Hicks, attributed to Paul van Somer\n\nSir Baptist Hicks, 1st Viscount Campden (?1551-1629) was one of the most important money lenders to the Stuart kings. James I knighted him in 1603, and he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex in 1625.\n\nDetails\n\nOil on canvas\n\n84¼ x 53 in. (2146 x 1346 mm)\n\nFrame style: Bolection\n\nThis painting is displayed outside Court Room 3 of The Supreme Court building.\n\nAbout the sitter\n\nSir Baptist Hicks, 1st Viscount Campden (?1551-1629) was one of the most important money lenders to the Stuart kings. James I knighted him in 1603, and he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex in 1625.\n\nIn 1611-12, he funded the building of a Sessions House for the Middlesex magistrates, which was known as Hicks Hall. He left substantial legacies to charitable causes; parish churches, the building of a market house, the endowment of almshouses in Campden, Gloucestershire, and bequests to the poor, both in Campden and in London.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nPaul (Pauwels) van Somer (1577/8-1621/2) was a portrait painter who was probably born in Antwerp. Between 1612 and 1615, he was painting in Leiden, The Hague and Brussels, but none of his work is recorded before he arrived in London.\n\nBy the autumn of 1615, he had settled in the St Martin’s Lane area with two other court painters from the Netherlands, Daniel Mytens and Abraham van Blyenberch. An important contemporary record of artists’ materials and techniques by James I’s Swiss physician praises his “incomparable varnish”.\n\nConservation\n\n2007/8: Some minor repairs were carried out to the frame, and it was hoped that the painting could be fully cleaned. Unfortunately, large areas of the background had been re-painted (over damage caused by a malfunction in the drying of the paint layer). Removing this over paint could not be justified, as the considerable work involved would not have substantially improved the appearance of the painting. Instead, the uppermost, glossy and yellow layer of varnish was reduced by friction, and the painting was re-varnished.\n\n2009: The painting was re-framed with measures to provide protection from dust at the reverse.\n\nBack to top\n\nGeorge III tapestry\n\nThis ornate tapestry is woven with the Arms and Cypher of George III, the badges of the United Kingdom and the motto of the Order of the Garter.\n\nDetails\n\nTapestry\n\nDated circa 1760\n\n97 x 193½ in. (2464 x 4915 mm)\n\nThis tapestry is displayed in the librarian’s office of The Supreme Court building.\n\nAbout the tapestry\n\nThe tapestry is woven with the Arms and Cypher of George III, within a polychrome cartouche of Roman foliage, flowered with the badges of the United Kingdom and festooned with garlands and beribboned trophies uniting the emblems of Government, Justice, Arts and Commerce.\n\nThis Coat of Arms is the one used from 1714 to 1801. The same crest appears on the headboard of the bed in which George III slept at Goodwood House during this period.\n\nThe trophies in the panel include Roman fasces, Minerva’s helmet and Mercury’s caduceus. These all allude to good government and optimism at the beginning of George III’s reign.\n\nThe tapestry bears the motto of the Order of the Garter: “HONI SOIT-QUI.MAL.Y.PENSE.”: “Shamed be he who thinks evil of it”.\n\nOn the lower right, the maker’s signature is visible: ‘T.CO SHAM’\n\nGeorge III was born in 1738, crowned in 1760 and died in 1820. The Coat of Arms changed in 1801 to 1816 and then again in 1816 to 1837.\n\nConservation\n\n2007/9: The tapestry underwent major conservation treatment: cleaning to remove heavy soiling and staining, stabilising the fabric by restoring the pH level as close to normal as possible, repairs as necessary, reducing distortions in the drape and re-backing. Over the years, the tapestry has faded considerably. A special box with a blind has been designed to protect the tapestry from further light damage and dust.\n\nBack to top\n\nLocation of art works at the UKSC\n\nPDF version (16KB)\n\nThe following art works can be viewed whenever the court building is open.\n\nCourt 1\n\nArthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington by Ethel Mortlock\n\nLord Bingham by David Poole\n\nSir John Fielding by Nathaniel Hone\n\nSir Montague Sharpe by George Spencer Watson\n\nCourt 3\n\nEarl of Northumberland by Sir Joshua Reynolds (frame by Chippendale)\n\nWilliam Mainwaring by Gainsborough Dupont\n\nJohn Lord Campbell by Thomas Woolnoth\n\nRichard Bethell by by Michael Gordigiani\n\nLord Haldane by Arthur Stockdale Cope\n\nEdward Macnaughton by Hughde Twenebrokes Glazebrook\n\nJohn Simon, Viscount Simon by Frank Salisbury\n\nRobert Threshie Reid, Earl Loreborn by George Reid\n\nSir Baptist Hicks attributed to Paul van Somer\n\nExhibition Space\n\nBadges of High Sheriff and Westminster Sessions\n\nCommemorative Documents of Middlesex Guildhall\n\nThe following can be viewed on public Open Days\n\nLibrary\n\nHugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland by Thomas Gainsborough\n\nHerbrand Arthur Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford by John Collier\n\nJames Brownlow William Cecil 2nd Marquis of Salisbury by Eden Upton Eddis\n\nLibrary balcony\n\nGeorge Henry Byng 3rd Earl of Strafford\n\nGeorge III tapestry dated circa\n\nThe following can be viewed by appointment only\n\nPlease contact our enquiries team\n\nTelephone: 020 7960 1500 or 1900.\n\nCharles I by John Reilly (1919) after Van Dyck\n\nFrancis Const by Henry William Pickersgill (as identified by contributors to Art UK's Art Detective website)\n\nFrancis Const by unknown artist of the 'English School'\n\nHenry Pownell by Eden Upton Eddis\n\nHugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland by Andres van Rymsdyk\n\nPortrait of a Cleric -by an unkown artist of the 'English School'\n\nPortrait of a Gentleman - unkown artist of the 'English School' 19th century\n\nPortrait of a Judge - Unknown\n\nSir Francis Brockman Morley by John Collier\n\nSir Gilford Craig by Harold Knight\n\nSir Howard Button by Margaret Lindsay Williams\n\nSir James Nicoll McAdam by an unkown artist of the 'English school'\n\nSir John Fielding - after the Rev Matthew Peters R.A. by W.
