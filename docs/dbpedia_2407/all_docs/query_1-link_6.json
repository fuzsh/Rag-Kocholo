        "text": "BANQUET TO LORD LAMINGTON\n\nit,\n\nIMPORTANT SPEECH BY MR.\n\nCHAMBERLAIN\n\nLORD LAMINGTONS VIEWS:\n\nREMARKS BY SIR HENRY NORMAN.\n\n(Abridged from the \" Standard\" of 22nd\n\nJanuary.)\n\nMr. Chamberlain presided last evening\n\nat the Hotel Metropole, at a complimentary\n\ndinner to Lord Lamington, on his\n\nappointment as Governor of Queensland.\n\nSupporting the Colonial Secretary, in\n\naddition to Lord Lamington, were Mr.\n\nC. S. Dicken, Lord Selborne, Sir G\n\nBowen, Sir F Abel, Sir S. Samuel, Sir W.\n\nPerceval, Sir B. Dawes, Sir M. Fraser,\n\nSir J. Mackay, the Italian Ambassador,\n\nSir H. Norman, Lord Ampthill, Sir J.\n\nGarrick, Sir F. Young, Admiral Kennedy,\n\nMr. Curzon, M.P., and Mr. Cochrane,\n\nMcF. The general company included Mr.\n\nR. Kimber, M.F., Count Lovatelli, Mr.\n\nH. G. Webster, M.P., Mr. Henniker\n\nHeaton, M.P., Mr. Finch-Hatton, M.P.,\n\nLord Douglas of Hawick, Mr. J. Hezler,\n\nM.P., Major De Winton, Captain Elmslie,\n\nCaptain Heath, R.N., Mr. J. H. Batten,\n\nand Mr. C. Rawson, hon. secretary.\n\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN, on rising to\n\npropose the toast of the evening, was\n\ngreeted with another outburst of applause.\n\nHe said Your Excellency, my\n\nLords, and Gentlemen,-I have now to\n\npropose to you the toast of the evening,\n\n\" The Health of Lord Lamington,\" who\n\nis shortly leaving us to take up his responsible\n\nduties as the representative of\n\nher Majesty in her loyal colony of\n\nQueensland. (Cheers.) I think, gentlemen,\n\nthat I see before me a representative\n\ngathering of British subjects, whose\n\nchief, or, at all events, one of whose\n\nprincipal interests lies in that great\n\ngroup of Australian colonies whose present\n\ngreatness and importance give us\n\nbut a faint indication of the splendid\n\nfuture which awaits them. (Cheers)\n\nFor gentlemen, of one thing I am cer-\n\ntain whatever may be the fate of the\n\nold country and even as to that I have\n\na sufficient confidence^-<loud cheers)\n\nbut whatever our future may be, no man\n\ncan doubt that our vigorous offspring\n\nin the Southern Sea are bound, at no distant\n\ntime, to rival the older civilisations\n\nof the Continent of Europe in wealth,\n\nin population, and in all of the attributes\n\nof a great nation. (Cheers.) But although,\n\nas I have said, your interests lie\n\nin this direction, I have a distinctive\n\nfeeling that to-night you are thinking;\n\nnot so much of Australian politics and\n\nof Australasian progress as you are of\n\nevents that have recently occurred In\n\nanother quarter of the globe, and of their\n\nconnection with Imperial interests.\n\n(Cheers.) And if that be so, I hail the\n\nfact as another proof of the solidarity\n\nof Imperial sentiment which makes it\n\nimpossible that a blow can be struck on\n\na chord sounded, in even the most distant\n\npart of this Empire without an echo\n\ncoming back from every other part of\n\nthe Empire. (Loud cheers) Gentlemen,\n\nit would be inopportune in me, it would\n\nbe improper, if I were to dwell upon the\n\nincidents which have diverted attention\n\nto South Africa. Those incidents will\n\nbe the subject of judicial inquiry in this\n\ncountry and in Africa, and I assume that\n\nwith the fairness-the fair-mirrdecmess\n\nwhich distinguishes them, my country-\n\nmen will wait to hear both the indict-\n\nment and the defence-(cheers)-'before ,\n\nthey attempt to pronounce a judgment\n\nBut in the meantime I will venture to\n\nsay that I think there is a tendency to\n\nattach too much importance to serenade\n\ntional occurrences, which pass away and\"\n\nleave no trace behind, and not enough\n\nto the general course of British policy\n\nand the general current of colonial\n\nprogress. (Cheers.) I have heard it\"\n\nsaid that we never have had a Colonial\n\npolicy, that we have simply blundered'\n\ninto all the best places on the earth's)\n\n(Cries of, No, no,\" and laughter.) I ad- x\n\nmit that we have made mistakes. I.\n\nhave no doubt that we are answerabtefor*\n\nsins of commission as well as for sins of.\n\nomission ; but, after all is said, this rests\n\nmains-that we alone, among aberrations of\n\nthe earth, have been able re-establishing\n\nand to maintain colonies under different'.'\n\nconditions in all parts of the world- U\n\n(heal\", hear) that we have maintained?\"\n\nthem to our own advantage and to theirs',!\n\n-(cheers) and that we have secured not,.\n\nonly the loyal attachment of British sub~V\n\njects, but the general goodwill of the %\n\nraces, whether they be natives-or-whether^ y/\n\nthey be European, that have time come under\n\nthe British flag. (Loud cheers.) !\n\nThis, then, may be a comforting assurance\n\nwhen we think of occasional mis- .,,\n\ntakes, and when we are rebuked even for\n\nour misfortunes (hear, hear) we may,\n\nfind some consolation in our successes,\n\n(Cheers.) There is another consideration\n\nwhich, I think, is not inappropriate\n\nto such a gathering as this. A few\n\nweeks ago England appeared to stand\n\nalone in the world, surrounded by jealous\n\ncompetitors, and by altogether unexpected\n\nhostility. (Hear, hear.) Differences\n\nbetween ourselves and other nations\n\nwhich were of long standing appeared\n\nsuddenly to have come to a head,\n\nand to have assumed threatening proper-\n\ntions, and from quarters from which we\n\nmight have looked for friendship and\n\nconsideration-(cheers)-having regard\n\nto our traditions and to a certain community\n\nof interests-(cheers)-we were\n\nconfronted with suspicion, and even with\n\nhate. We had to recognise that our\n\nsuccess itself, however legitimate, was\n\nimputed to us a crime (hear, hear\n\nthat our love of peace was taken as a\n\nsign of weakness-(cheers)-and that our\n\nindifference to foreign criticism was con-\n\nstrued into an invitation to insult us.\n\n\" (Loud cheers. ). We had to admit that\n\n\"'the prospect of our discomfiture was re\n\n* garded with hardly disguised satisfac\n\n, tion by our competitors, who, at the\n\nsame time, must have been forced to admit\n\nthat we alone hold our possessions\n\nthroughout the world\" in trust for them\n\nhalf-flood cheers) and admit them to our\n\n_ markets as freely as our own selves.\n\n7 (Renewed cheers.) Gentlemen, I regret\n\nthat such a feeling should exist, and that\n\nwe should be forced to admit its existence\n\n; but if it does exist, I rejoice that It\n\nfound expression. (Cheers.) No better\n\nservice was ever done this nation than\n\nwhen we were enabled to show in face of\n\n\" all that, while on the one hand we are\n\nresolute to fulfil our obligations, we are\n\nequally determined to maintain our\n\nrights. (Cheers Three weeks ago, in\n\nthe words of Mr. Forster, the Leader of\n\nthe House of Commons of the Dominion\n\nof Canada, the great Mother Empire\n\nstood splendidly isolated. (Hear.) And.\n\nhow does she stand to-day ? She stands\"\n\nsecure in the strength of her own resources,\n\nin the firm resolution of\n\nher own people, without respect to\n\nparty, and in the abundant loyalty\n\nof her children from one end of the Empire\n\nto the other. (Loud cheers.) The\n\nresolution which was conveyed to the\n\nPrime Minister on behalf of the Australian\n\ncolonies-(cheers)-and the display\n\nof patriotic enthusiasm on the part of\n\nthe Dominion of Canada they come to\n\nus as the natural response to the outburst\n\nof national spirit in the United\n\nKingdom, and as a proof that British\n\nhearts beat in unison throughout the\n\nworld whatever may be the differences\n\nthat separate us. (Cheers). Gentleman,\n\nLet us cultivate this sentiment. (Cheers)\n\n(Let us do all in our power, by improving\n\nour communication, by developing our\n\ncommercial relations, by co-operating in\n\nmutual defence, and none of us will ever\n\nfeel isolated (Cheers.) No part of the\n\nEmpire will stand alone so long as it can\n\ncount upon the common, interest of all in\n\n', 'Its welfare and in its security. (Cheers.)\n\nThat is one moral which I derive from\n\nrecent events that is the lesson which\n\nI desire to impress upon my countrymen\n\nin the words of Tennyson,\n\nj \" Let Britain's myriad voices call,\n\nSons be welded, one and all,\n\nr In one Imperial whole One\n\nwith Britain, heart and soul\n\nOne life, one flag, one fleet,\n\nOne throne \"\n\n(Loud Cheers.) And, gentleman, in the\n\ntime to come, the time that must come,\n\n. when those colonies of ours have grown\n\nin stature, in population, and in strength,\n\nThis league of kindred nations, this federation\n\nof Greater Britain, will not only\n\nprovide for its own security, but will be\n\na potent factor in maintaining the peace\n\nof the world. (Cheers) Our guest to\n\nBright goes out to take his part in this\n\nwork of drawing tighter the bonds\n\nwhich unite us to our children in the\n\nAntipodes. He goes to an infant colony,\n\nan infant which is destined to become a\n\ngiant, and the possibilities of which no\n\nman can measure. Queensland has an\n\nJ area, Shall I say three times greater than\n\n(the German Empire ? (Laughter and\n\ncheers, cries of \" Bravo,\" and renewed\n\n' Cheers.) It has a soil which can produce\n\nanything. It has vast mineral resources\n\nIn a generation its population has increased\n\nfifteen fold. It has already a\n\nrevenue of three or four millions sterling\n\nIt has completed 2500 miles of railway\n\nIt has exports of ten millions sterling, all\n\nof them, except an incalculable fraction,\n\ncoming to the United Kingdom, or to\n\nsome of the British possessions. (Cheers.)\n\nAnd yet this colony of Queensland, great\n\nas it is, is only one of seven, all equally\n\nimportant, equally energetic, equally\n\nprosperous, and equally loyal. (Cheers)\n\nI say that the relations between these\n\ncolonies and ourselves are questions of\n\nmomentous import to us both, and I hope\n\n<. that our rulers and our people will leave\n\n<-, so stone unturned to show the store that\n\nwe ought to set upon the continued amity\n\nand affection of our kindred beyond the\n\nseas. That is the message which we ask\n\nLord Lamington to take with him. We\n\nwish him health and prosperity for the\n\ncolony over which he presides. (Cheers )\n\nLord LAMINGTON, who was received\n\n? with loud cheers, thanked the company\n\nsincerely for their hospitality and cordial\n\na welcome. He appreciated their gene\n\nmosity, and he also appreciated\n\ns the? fact that the gathering was!\n\npresided over by the Secretary of State\n\nfor the Colonies. (Cheers ) These two\n\n- facts would strengthen him to do his\n\nutmost to carry out thoroughly the high\n\nfeatures of the office to which her Majesty's\n\nof Government had called him. (Cheers)\n\nj are fully recognised that that large\n\ngathering was assembled not so much\n\nto do him honour as, after the grave\n\nevents that had lately surrounded us, to\n\nhear what should fall from the lips of\n\ns the gentleman who had shown such\n\na. splendid decision-(cheers)-and had\n\n1 guided them so skilfully through the\n\nA dangers which had surrounded the Empire.\n\n(Cheers.) On that account and\n\nfor every other reason, he was aware\n\nthat it was almost impossible that this\n\nkindness should have been directed to\n\nhim personally (Cries of \" No, no ). He\n\nwell knew he had no real claim to\n\ni at, and he thought it would have been\n\nvery good on their part to await his return\n\nfrom Queensland to see whether he\n\nshould be worthy of their thanks (2 No,\n\nno \") He had heard it said, that the\n\nduties of a Governor of a self-governing\n\ncolony were somewhat invidious, for\n\ns J that, whereas he might not be able to do\n\nas? any direct good, he might do incalculable\n\n« harm whether that was true, or not\n\nhe certainly knew a splendid instance\n\nto the contrary From every source of\n\ninformation, public and private, he\n\n\" learned that the gallant soldier and experienced\n\nadministrator Sir Henry Nor-\n\nman-(cheers)-had brought the influence\n\nof a Governor to something\n\nnearly approaching an authoritative\n\nye ruler, and that simply owing to his in\n\n' cessant labour, to his identifying him\n\n-self with the interests of all classes in\n\nthe colony, and by the kindness and\n\n,. Simple consideration he showed not only\n\n> to those dwelling in Brisbane, but to\n\neveryone he. met (Hear, hear)\n\nAnother gentleman present was Sh\n\n\"2 George Bowen, who assisted to launch\n\n' the colony on her career of self-govern\n\n' ment. (Cheers ) In Queensland there\n\nwere agricultural and mineral resources\n\nwhich had hitherto hardly been touched\n\nThere were rice plantations, and thousands\n\nof acres of bananas, and every kind\n\n'J'of tropical and semi-tropical product\n\ncould be grown. Then the mineral re\n\n« sources had been proved to be, perhaps,\n\n\" the most productive of any part of the\n\nWorld, He understood that the yield of\n\nJJ gold was something almost enormous as\n\ncompared with other places. There\n\nwere also other minerals of great value,\n\nmore especially the coalfields of Queensland,\n\nwhich were destined to play an important\n\npart in the future On the high\n\nwestern plateau there were grazing\n\ngrounds which had cattle that could be\n\nnumbered by tens of thousands, and\n\nsheep by hundreds of thousands This\n\nwas an area which, in the future, would\n\nbe developed in a more profitable man\n\never, because when the difficulty of the\n\nitr Water supply had been completely over\n\n5s come, the cultivation of wheat and other\n\ncereal crops would be possible (Hear,\n\nof hear) There was, however, the rabbit\n\n* difficulty, and he did not know how that\n\nwas to be overcome (Laughter ) Our\n\na Colonial policy was one of freedom, and\n\nwe welcomed to all the benefits of our\n\ncolonies the world at large (Hear,\n\nhear ) in Queensland there were settlements\n\nof Germans, Norwegians, and\n\na swedes They welcomed these foreigners,\n\nbecause in future generations they\n\nbecame assimilated to our own nation-\n\nality It was remarkable, then, why we\n\nshould be surrounded by the enmity of\n\nv the world The only answer was that\n\nother nations were envious and jealous of\n\nour world-wide supremacy. Hear)\n\n\"Whatever legislative means in the future\n\nmight be devised for drawing them more\n\nclosely together, it was most absolutely\n\nessential that there should be a complete\n\nrange of hearts between the mother\n\ncountry and the colonies-(cheers)-and\n\nevery effort that could be made should be\n\nxa^^in^howang^th^t^theTev^as j, kindly\n\nfeeling of kindred ship between, those\n\ndwelling here and those beyond the seas.\n\n(Cheers.) He) had only really to thank\n\nthem for so kindly welcoming him and\n\nfor giving him, as it were, credentials\n\nwhich he might present to their friends\n\nbeyond the seas. (Cheers.) He would\n\nconclude by expressing the hope that\n\nthose Queenslanders present, and those\n\nin Queensland, would ever retain their\n\nfaith in the future prosperity of that\n\ncountry, and that the love and pride\n\nthey had for it would merge into the\n\nnobler and loftier ambition of taking\n\npart in a united and powerful Australia.\n\n(Cheers.) As Queenslanders, as Australians,\n\nand as Imperialists, might that\n\ntriple flame of patriotism ever burn\n\nwithin them. (Cheers.)\n\nThe health of the Italian Ambassador\n\nwas proposed by Mr. Chamberlain, and\n\nGeneral Ferrero, In responding, acknowledged\n\nin cordial terms the hospitality\n\nwhich had been extended to him and his\n\ncompatriots in England and her colonies\n\n-a hospitality which was not equalled\n\nin any other part of the world.\n\nMr. DICKEN gave \"The Colony of\n\nQueensland.\" He referred to the wonderful\n\nprogress which he said Queensland\n\nhad made since it was established as\n\nseparate colony in 1859, under the governorship\n\nof Sir George Bowen (cheers)\n\nand quoted a few statistics of population,\n\nrevenue, trade, and stock. He also referred\n\nto the sugar and gold mining industries,\n\nand added So long as wise\n\nlegislation prevailed in the colonies, and\n\nstatesmen at home sympathised with\n\ntheir aspirations as the chairman did,\n\nthere need be no fear of the straining of\n\nexisting ties on the contrary, there was\n\nlikely to be a further consolidation of the\n\nBritish Empire. (Cheers.)\n\nGeneral Sir HENRY NORMAN, an responding\n\nto the toast, assured the company\n\nthat if ever trouble arose on this\n\nside the hearts of the Queenslanders, as\n\nwell as others, would be with us, and\n\nthat they might rely upon the loyalty\n\nand devotion of the troops of the different\n\ncolonies to defend their own shores,\n\nand others beyond even called upon.\n\n(Cheers.) \" r\n\nSir JAMES GARRICK, late Agent\n\nGeneral for Queensland, proposed the\n\n\" Health of the Chairman.\"\n\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN, who, on rising,\n\nwas received with loud cheers, said\n\nSir James Garrick and gentlemen, No-\n\nthing could be more grateful to me than\n\nthat this toast should be proposed by the\n\neloquent representative of a colony which\n\nwe have met to honour as well as its\n\nfuture Governor, and nothing could be\n\nmore agreeable than the kindly reception\n\nwhich you have given me. It almost\n\nemboldens me to think that there might\n\nbe yet occasions upon which I shall venture\n\nto address my fellow-countrymen.\n\n-(daughter's point upon which I admit\n\nI have had grave doubts since I have\n\nbecome acquainted with certain criticisms\n\non my recent performances. (Renewed\n\nlaughter.) When I became Secretary\n\nof State for the Colonies I accepted\n\nwith that office certain duties, not the\n\nleast pleasant being that of presiding\n\nover similar gatherings to this. I attended\n\na meeting of the friends of South\n\nAfrica on an occasion interesting especially\n\nto our colony of Natal. I made a\n\nspeech on that occasion in which, in my\n\nsimple and ingenuous way-(laughter)\n\nI endeavoured to point out that this was\n\non the whole a considerable Empire, and\n\nthat any true view of its perspective\n\nwould take into account the greatness of\n\nthe colonies, and the magnitude of their\n\nresources, as well as the past history of\n\nthe mother country. (Cheers.) But,\n\nthereupon, I was surprised to read in the\n\nreport of a speech of a minor luminary of\n\nthe late Government, on the occasion of\n\nthe recent raid into the Transvaal, that\n\nthat unfortunate occurrence was entirely\n\ndue to the spread-eagle speech which I\n\nthen made. (Laughter.) It is extraordinary\n\nwhat great events spring from\n\ntrifling causes. I had no conception that\n\nmy words would travel so far, or that\n\nthey would have so great an influence.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge and belief,\n\nI have never made a spread-eagle speech\n\nin my life. (Laughter.) I think I have\n\nbeen able to distinguish between patriotism\n\nand Jingoism ; but, in order that\n\nthere may be no mistake, I desire to say\n\nnow, in the most formal way, that the\n\nfew remarks which I have addressed\n\nto you to-night are not to be taken\n\nas an invitation to any individual\n\nto carry on war on his own account, or\n\nto make an invasion of a friendly country\n\nwith which we are at present at peace.\n\n(Cheers and laughter.) But, gentlemen,\n\nthis is not all, because this afternoon I\n\nread in an evening newspaper that this\n\nsame speech, which I thought so natural\n\nand so innocent, was really the dictating\n\ncause of our difficulties with British\n\nGuiana-(laughter)-of the complications\n\nacross the Atlantic. It appears that in\n\nspeaking of Imperial unity in endeavour-\n\ning to popularise that idea amongst my\n\ncountrymen, I am giving offence to other\n\nnations. Gentlemen, I cannot help think-\n\ning that Lord Rosebery was mistaken\n\nwhen, a short time ago, he said that\n\nLittle Englanders no longer existed\n\namong us. (Hear, hear.) A pretty pass\n\nwe must have come to, if the Minister\n\nwho is responsible for the British colonies\n\nis forbidden to speak of their future,\n\nof their greatness (brave and cheers\n\nof the importance of maintaining friendly\n\nrelations with them, of the necessity of\n\npromoting the unity of the British race.\n\n(Cheers.) I remember a story of a certain\n\nburgomaster in a Continental town\n\nto whom complaints were made that\n\nnaughty boys were accustomed to throw\n\nmud upon the passers-by. He was asked\n\nto intervene, and he issued a proclama-\n\ntion, which was to the effect that all the\n\nrespectable inhabitants were requested to\n\nwear their second-handclothes-(laughter\n\nand cheers) in order not to give offence.'\n\n(Laughter and cheers.) I do not\n\nunderstand the position that I hold.\n\n(Hear, hear.) I decline to speak with\n\nbated breath (hear, hear) for fear of\n\ngiving offence to foreign nations. We\n\nmean them no harm. (Hear, hear.) We\n\nhope they mean us none. (Hear, hear.)\n\nBut not for any such consideration will\n\nwo be withheld from speaking on points\n\nwhich have for us the greatest interest,\n\nand upon which the future of our Empire\n\ndepends. (Loud cheers.) Sir James\n\nGarrick has kindly attributed to me\n\nmotives in seeking the office which has\n\nbeen conferred upon me. He is not,\n\nperhaps, far wrong in thinking that I\n\nhave long believed that future of the\n\ncolonies and the future of this country\n\nwere inter-dependent, and that this was\n\nthe creative time, that this was the opportunity\n\nwhich, once let slip, might never\n\nrecur for bringing together all people\n\nwho are under the British flag, and for\n\nconsolidating them into the great self\n\nsustaining and self-protfedting Empire\n\nwhose future will be worthy of the tradi-\n\ntions of the race. (Loud cheers.)\n\nThe company broke, up singing \" Rule\n\nBritannia.\""
