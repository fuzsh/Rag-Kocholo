        "text": "The Broncos season has gone from bad to worse with Payne Haas and Ezra Mam sidelined, heaping pressure on coach Kevin Walters to fill the gaping holes.\n\nSouths coach Ben Hornby has been dealt a triple injury blow ahead of his side’s clash with the Storm, although one of his star men is pushing to return.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sharks may be forced to dig deep into their playmaking stocks and unleash a debutant while the Sea Eagles have received good and bad news.\n\nAsk all your teams questions at 2pm in our live chat with Fox League’s Tom Sargeant!

Richard Kennar 5. Jacob Gagai 6. Jack Wighton 18. Dion Teaupa 8. Davvy Moale 9. Damien Cook 10. Sean Keppie 11. Cameron Murray 12. Jacob Host 13. Keaon Koloamatangi 14. Michael Chee Kam 15. Siliva Havili 16. Thomas Burgess 17. Tallis Duncan\n\nTeam Tips: A big blow for Ben Hornby, with three of his 17 from last week made unavailable for their Storm clash through injury. Jacob Host (abdominal strain), Siliva Havili (hamstring strain), and Dion Teaupa (AC joint sprain) will all be unavailable for Souths when they host the ladder-leading Storm on Thursday. Tallis Duncan firms as the likeliest replacement for Host in the back row, while Liam Le Blanc is the front runner to take Havili’s place on the bench. In a big boost for Hornby, star half Cody Walker.\n\nLast week’s Storm team: 1. Ryan Papenhuyzen 2. William Warbrick 3. Jack Howarth 4. Nick Meaney 5. Grant Anderson 6. Cameron Munster 7. Jahrome Hughes 16. Nelson Asofa-Solomona 9. Harry Grant 10. Josh King 11. Shawn Blore 12. Eliesa Katoa 13. Trent Loiero 14. Tyran Wishart 15. Lazarus Vaalepu 17. Alec MacDonald 22. Tepai Moeroa\n\nTeam Tips: Tui Kamikamica sat out of last week’s loss due to groin tightness, but there’s been no word on whether he’ll miss more games. Assuming Kamikamica returns to the 17, he’ll likely start with Nelson Asofa-Solomona dropping to the bench and Tepai Moeroa out of the 17. Meanwhile, Joe Chan will return from a suspension and could force his way onto the bench. Eli Katoa left the field with a knee concern during last week’s game concern but was able to return to the field so is expected to be good to go this week. Star winger Xavier Coates is due back from a hamstring injury over the coming weeks and if given the green light, Grant Anderson could be the man to make way or could shift into the centres in the place of Jack Howarth.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nGold Coast Titans vs Cronulla Sharks, 6pm AEST at Cbus Super Stadium\n\nLast week’s Titans team: 1. Keano Kini 2. Alofiana Khan-Pereira 3. Brian Kelly 4. Phillip Sami 5. Jojo Fifita 6. Jayden Campbell 7. Kieran Foran 8. Moeaki Fotuaika 9. Sam Verrills 18. Jaimin Jolliffe 11. David Fifita 12. Beau Fermor 13. Chris Randall 10. Erin Clark 14. Isaac Liu 15. Klese Haas 17. Josiah Pahulu\n\nTeam Tips: The Titans are flying high after their upset win over the Broncos but could be without luckless hooker Sam Verrills this week after he picked up what looked to be an ankle injury. If Verrills is sidelined for this clash, Chris Randall is expected to shift to hooker. Isaac Liu is an option to move to lock. AJ Brimson has been given all the time he needs to get back from a groin injury. Should he return this week, coach Des Hasler will face a selection headache of the good kind given Keano Kini’s form at fullback and Jayden Campbell finding a home at five-eighth.\n\nLast week’s Sharks team: 1. William Kennedy 2. Sione Katoa 3. Jesse Ramien 4. Kayal Iro 5. Samuel Stonestreet 6. Daniel Atkinson 7. Braydon Trindall 8. Royce Hunt 9. Blayke Brailey 10. Oregon Kaufusi 11. Briton Nikora 12. Teig Wilton 13. Cameron McInnes 14. Siosifa Talakai 15. Jack Williams 16. Toby Rudolf 17. Braden Hamlin-Uele\n\nTeam Tips: Coach Craig Fitzgibbon will be sweating on the availability of halfback Braydon Trindall after he went off early last week with a hamstring concern. Fitzgibbon said post-game that it was “too early to say” whether Trindall will miss any games but added\n\nthere was “definitely some awareness (of a niggle).” The Sharks will be forced to dig deep into their playmaking stocks if Trindall is sidelined given Nicho Hynes isn’t due back until Round 26. Fitzgibbon flagged that Blayke Brailey and Jayden Berrell are both capable of playing in the halves, while he also noted that Niwhai Puru is an option after scoring a try and setting up two more in NSW Cup on the weekend. If the 22-year-old gets the nod it would be his NRL debut. Meanwhile, fan-favourite Tom Hazelton is due back from a foot injury and will likely make his return via the bench.\n\nParramatta Eels vs Penrith Panthers, 8pm AEST at CommBank Stadium\n\nLast week’s Eels team: 1. Clinton Gutherson 2. Jake Tago 3. Viliami Penisini 4. Blaize Talagi 5. Sean Russell 6. Dylan Brown 7. Daejarn Asi 8. Reagan Campbell-Gillard 9. Brendan Hands 10. Wiremu Greig 11. Shaun Lane 12. Bryce Cartwright 13. Ryan Matterson 14. Joey Lussick 15. Joe Ofahengaue 16. Luca Moretti 17. Dan Keir\n\nTeam Tips: Maika Sivo and Kelma Tuilagi are due back from respective hamstring and thumb injuries but after defeating the Warriors in New Zealand, interim coach Trent Barrett may want to stick solid with the same 17.\n\nLast week’s Panthers team: 1. Isaiah Iongi 2. Sunia Turuva 3. Izack Tago 4. Casey McLean 5. Brian To’o 6. Jarome Luai 7. Nathan Cleary 8. Moses Leota 9. Mitch Kenny 15. Matt Eisenhuth 11. Scott Sorensen 12. Liam Martin 13. Isaah Yeo 10. Lindsay Smith 14. Trent Toelau 16. Liam Henry 17. Mavrik Geyer\n\nTeam Tips: Dylan Edwards is still another week away, but Daine Laurie is due back from a head knock and will slot back in at fullback with debutant Isaiah Iongi to make way. Star prop James Fisher-Harris is unlikely to return from a groin injury with the club saying he won’t be rushed back.\n\nMORE NRL NEWS\n\nTALKING PTS: Woes mask revival brewing at Tigers; crucial step in Dragons comeback\n\nCLUTCH CLEARY: Half lauded following yet another game winning play\n\n‘VERY SATISFYING’: Des believes Titans can pull off miracle\n\n‘DESERVES IT’: Ciraldo’s huge call on Bulldogs star as Crichton’s rise continues\n\nSATURDAY\n\nCanberra Raiders vs Manly Sea Eagles, 3pm AEST at GIO Stadium\n\nLast week’s Raiders team: 1. Kaeo Weekes 2. Jordan Rapana 3. Matthew Timoko 4. Sebastian Kris 5. Xavier Savage 18. Adam Cook 7. Jamal Fogarty 8. Josh Papali’i 9. Tom Starling 10. Joseph Tapine 11. Hudson Young 12. Elliott Whitehead 13. Morgan Smithies 14. Danny Levi 15. Trey Mooney 16. Ata Mariota 17. Zac Hosking\n\nTeam Tips: Ethan Strange was shock axing from the 17 to 18th man last week but expect to see him back at five-eighth after coach Ricky Stuart clarified post-game that he was just being rested given he had played every minute of the season. Adam Cook will make way for Strange’s return. Meanwhile, Morgan Smithies will be forced to watch on after suffering a head knock. That could open the door for Corey Horsburgh’s return to first grade, however given he’s on the outer with Stuart, Trey Mooney will likely start at lock with Peter Hola or Hohepa Puru options to join the bench. Zac Hosking suffered a shoulder injury in last week’s win and will likely be replaced on the bench by Simi Sasagi.\n\nRound 21 Sea Eagles team: 1. Tom Trbojevic 2. Jason Saab 3. Ben Trbojevic 4. Reuben Garrick 5. Tommy Talau 6. Luke Brooks 7. Daly Cherry-Evans 8. Taniela Paseka 9. Jake Simpkin 10. Josh Aloiai 11. Corey Waddell 12. Karl Lawton 13. Jake Trbojevic 14. Gordon Chan Kum Tong 15. Ethan Bullemor 16. Toafofoa Sipley 17. Nathan Brown\n\nTeam Tips: The bye came at a good time for Manly given Jason Saab and Reuben Garrick both suffered head knocks in Round 21, while Josh Aloiai soldiered on with a knee injuryut according to The Daily Telegraph won’t be fit to play in Round 23. Meanwhile, Haumole Olakau’atu will return from a suspension and push Corey Waddell back to the bench. Lachlan Croker returned from a neck injury via NSW Cup a fortnight ago and is set to return to the side, however it remains to be seen whether he returns via the bench or the starting side.\n\nNorth Queensland Cowboys vs Brisbane Broncos, 5.30pm AEST at Queensland Country Bank Stadium\n\nLast week’s Cowboys team: 1. Scott Drinkwater 2. Kyle Feldt 3. Valentine Holmes 4. Viliami Vailea 5. Murray Taulagi 6. Tom Dearden 7. Chad Townsend 8. Jordan McLean 9. Reece Robson 17. Griffin Neame 10. Sam McIntyre 11. Heilum Luki 12. Jeremiah Nanai 14. Harrison Edwards 10. Sam McIntyre 13. Thomas Mikaele 15. Jake Granville 16. Kulikefu Finefeuiaki\n\nTeam tips: Reuben Cotter is expected to return this week after missing last round’s game against the Tigers due to concussion protocols and will slot back in at lock with Harrison Edwards to drop back to the bench. But the Cowboys have now lost Heilum Luki to a head knock with Kulikefu Finefeuiaki expected to start in his place. Veteran Jake Granville is also unavailable after suffering a pectoral injury which could sadly end the 35-year-old’s NRL career given he is unsigned for 2025.\n\nLast week’s Broncos team: 1. Reece Walsh 2. Corey Oates 3. Kotoni Staggs 4. Deine Mariner 5. Jesse Arthars 6. Ezra Mam 7. Adam Reynolds 8. Corey Jensen 9. Billy Walters 10. Payne Haas 11. Brendan Piakura 12. Jordan Riki 13. Patrick Carrigan 14. Blake Mozer 15. Kobe Hetherington 16. Xavier Willison 17. Martin Taupau\n\nTeam Tips: Scans confirmed star prop Payne Haas has suffered a Lisfranc injury that will not only keep him out of this week’s must-win clash with the Cowboys, but potentially the rest of the season. The club also confirmed Ezra Mam has suffered a syndesmosis issue and could see a similar fate, while Tyson Smoothy has suffered an ankle issue that will likely keep him out of this weekend’s game. Xavier Willison is likely to replace Haas in the front row, with Fletcher Baker potentially joining the bench in his place. Smoothy’s injury complicates how Kevin Walters will cover for the loss of Mam, given he can’t push son Billy Walters into the halves and bring Smoothy into the starting line up.Jock Madden is also out with a hamstring injury, further depleting Walters’ halves stock ahead of the Cowboys game. Smoothy’s absence means young gun Blake Mozer will retain his place on the bench, while Tristan Sailor will likely come into the side for Mam. Where exactly Sailor plays remains to be seen. He could slot straight in at No.6, however, in the second half against the Titans Walters opted to push superstar fullback Reece Walsh into five-eighth, with Jesse Arthars at fullback. This could indicate Walsh partnering Reynolds in the halves, with Sailor moving into the No.1 role.\n\nSt George Illawarra Dragons vs Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, 7.35pm AEST at Netstrata Jubilee Stadium\n\nLast week’s Dragons team: 1. Tyrell Sloan 2. Zac Lomax 3. Moses Suli 4. Max Feagai 5. Christian Tuipulotu 6. Kyle Flanagan 7. Ben Hunt 14. Hame Sele 9. Jacob Liddle 17. Blake Lawrie 11. Luciano Leilua 12. Jaydn Su’A 13. Tom Eisenhuth 8. Francis Molo 10. Jack de Belin 15. Raymond Faitala-Mariner 16. Ryan Couchman\n\nTeam Tips: Mat Feagi is available to return from a head knock he suffered in Round 21 against the Panthers while playing at fullback in place of the dropped Tyrell Sloan. But with Sloan starring for the Dragons in Saturday night’s upset 18-16 win over the Storm, Feagi may not be able to force his way back into the 17. Interchange forward Raymond Faitala-Mariner is unavailable with a back injury which could open the door for former Blues representative Jack Bird to return to the team after being relegated to the NSW Cup.\n\nLast week’s Bulldogs team: 1. Connor Tracey 2. Jacob Kiraz 3. Bronson Xerri 4. Stephen Crichton 5. Josh Addo-Carr 6. Matt Burton 7. Toby Sexton 8. Josh Curran 9. Reed Mahoney 10. Samuel Hughes 11. Viliame Kikau 12. Jacob Preston 13. Kurt Mann 14. Bailey Hayward 15. Lipoi Hopoi 16. Kurtis Morrin 17. Harry Hayes\n\nTeam Tips: The Bulldogs got through their Sunday night win over the Raiders unscathed and are expected to go with the same 1-17. Max King (wrist) and Jaeman Salmon (jaw) are still some time away.\n\nSUNDAY\n\nDolphins vs New Zealand Warriors, 2pm AEST at Suncorp Stadium\n\nLast week’s Dolphins team: 1. Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow 2. Jamayne Isaako 3. Jake Averillo 4. Herbie Farnworth 5. Jack Bostock 17. Sean O’Sullivan 7. Isaiya Katoa 8. Jesse Bromwich 9. Max Plath 18. Oryn Keeley 11. Felise Kaufusi 12. Connelly Lemuelu 13. Kenny Bromwich 14. Josh Kerr 15. Mark Nicholls 16. Ray Stone 19. Tesi Niu\n\nTeam Tips: Five-eighth Kodi Nikorima will return after he was a late scratching against the Roosters due to illness. Sean O’Sullivan will make way in the halves. Forward Tevita Pangai-Junior also pulled out late with a hamstring injury — although had to fulfil 18th man duties given not enough players travelled to Perth. Coach Wayne Bennett gave little away in his press conference so the severity of the injury is unknown. Winger Jamayne Isaako picked up an ankle injury in the second half against the Roosters and could be sidelined with interchange player Tesi Niu expected to take his place should he be unavailable.\n\nLast week’s Warriors team: 1. Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Ali Leiataua 4. Moala Graham-Taufa 5. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck 6. Chanel Harris-Tavita 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 14. Freddy Lussick 10. Mitchell Barnett 11. Marata Niukore 12. Kurt Capewell 13. Dylan Walker 9. Wayde Egan 15. Tom Ale 16. Jazz Tevaga 17. Leka Halasima\n\nTeam Tips: Marcelo Montoya is expected to make his return from a groin injury. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck will likely shift to centre upon Montoya’s return with Moala Graham-Taufa to drop out of the 17. Lock Dylan Walker is unavailable to concussion protocols with Jazz Tevaga the likely to option to replace him in the run-on side.\n\nNewcastle Knights vs Wests Tigers, 4.05pm AEST at McDonald Jones Stadium\n\nLast week’s Knights team: 1. Kalyn Ponga 2. Fletcher Sharpe 3. Dane Gagai 4. Dylan Lucas 5. Greg Marzhew 6. Tyson Gamble 7. Phoenix Crossland 8. Daniel Saifiti 9. Jayden Brailey 10. Leo Thompson 11. Tyson Frizell 12. Kai Pearce-Paul 13. Adam Elliott 14. Jack Cogger 16. Jack Hetherington 17. Mathew Croker 18. Thomas Cant\n\nTeam Tips: Jacob Saifiti suffered a calf injury in the warm-up ahead of Newcastle’s gritty 22-14 loss to Penrith on Sunday with the prop expected to be unavailable for selection. Coach Adam O’Brien may well name the same 17 that fought hard to go close to downing the reigning premiers while star centre Bradman Best remains sidelined with a hamstring injury.\n\nLast week’s Tigers team: 1. Jahream Bula 2. Solomon Alaimalo 3. Solomona Faataape 4. Justin Olam 5. Charlie Staines 6. Lachlan Galvin 7. Latu Fainu 8. Stefano Utoikamanu 9. Api Koroisau 10. David Klemmer 11. Reuben Porter 12. Samuela Fainu 13. Isaiah Papali’i 14. Tallyn Da Silva 15. Alex Seyfarth 17. Alex Twal 22. Tim Johannssen\n\nTeam Tips: Latu Fainu will be unavailable due to concussion protocols after suffering a head knock in his side’s loss to the Cowboys on Thursday night. Regular No.7 Aidan Sezer expected to slot straight back in for his return from suspension. Interchange forward Alex Seyfarth is also unavailable due to a head knock, while Alex Twal picked up a finger injury. Kit Laulilii, Justin Matamua and Jordan Miller are among the options to come onto the bench. Meanwhile, Adam Doueihi is also due back after being rested during Round 22 and could be a straight swap for Justin Olam, who has been sidelined for the remainder of the year after accepting a four-game suspension for his high shot on Heilum Luki. That decision also coincides with the club announcing the outside back would undergo surgery on both knees, having battled through pain throughout the 2024 season."
