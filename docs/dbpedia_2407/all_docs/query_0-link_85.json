Of more interest, though, was the next question: ‘Who was the Ayers behind the Rock?’ Like the road to the magnificent monolith itself, my journey towards answering this second question was lengthy. The initial, unconscious, step involved migration from Britain to Adelaide in the early 1990s. Then came a challenge from fellow members of the Cambrian Welsh Society of South Australia that, of course, I would know of the ‘Burra’ copper mine, to Adelaide’s north. I didn’t, but this was swiftly put right. As a family, we explored the surviving dugouts in the banks of the Burra Burra Creek in which, had we been visiting 140 years earlier, we would have encountered Cornish, Welsh and German families who were keeping the wheels of industry turning in the mine; we also wouldn’t have failed to notice their smelly herds of domestic livestock. So celebrated was the Burra Burra name in that period that it would spawn like-­named imitators as far apart as Devon and Tennessee. How could I not have known about it? I had always had an interest in history and my birthplace lay a stone’s throw from the epicentre of the mid-­nineteenthcentury copper trade. Indeed, around 1860 my great-­grandfather had started his working life, as a boy, in the Welsh copper industry. With the zeal of a convert, I began my own ‘mining’ project. I scrabbled for any information about this unsuspected British–Australian link that I could win from the depths of the South Australian State Library and State Archives. I scoured the musty ledgers and cash books of the smelting company, based in\n\nxii\n\nAyers_final2.indd 12\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\n‘Old’ South Wales, which had brought its expertise to the source of such a rich copper deposit as Burra was. I came across the letters of a man hailing from my own home town, who had migrated 150 years before me, and found him writing – over a period spanning about 35 years – to none other than Henry Ayers. They appeared friends. The Ayers name, in the Australian context, looked likely to be connected with that of ‘Ayers Rock’ fame. It was, and it was also inseparably linked with the Burra copper mining enterprise. My interest expanded. I had to find out more about this man Ayers, who had, surely, to be larger than life-­size himself. Published information about his life proved to be not only sparse but error-­prone and sometimes less than flattering. I slowly came to the realization that perhaps the task of trying to discover the real man behind the Rock had fallen to me. In telling Henry Ayers’ story, I have kept to the old money, i.e. to pounds sterling, shillings and pence, imperial weights and measures, and dimensions in miles, feet and inches. Your descent into the mine would have been measured, as with the ocean, in fathoms. If the reader is only comfortable with the metric system, or needs a refresher course on the old system, it might be worth reading Appendix A where I have also set out possible comparisons with today’s values for earnings and prices. Britain is always Home, and alternative homes, such as South Australia, are always home. I have kept contemporary spellings, such as ‘honorable’ and ‘favorite’, and even misspellings when quoting directly from letters or newspaper articles. I have retained the underlining of words and phrases in quotes, too. As Henry becomes active in politics, if you the reader are not familiar with the Westminster system of parliamentary government, it would be useful to read Appendix B before you begin Chapter 7 and, if at the end of his story you have even a tiny yen to know what was the eventual fate of the South Australian Mining Association, the brief Appendix C is for you. Family trees for Henry Ayers and J.B. Graham are also provided for reference.

My son Steffan for prodding me to attempt this project, encouraging me as the size of the task sank in, and commenting on the first complete draft. His knowledge of the worlds of law and high finance were also very beneficial. My daughter Elen, who cheerfully tolerated my recounting of the latest research revelations. She commented on a portion of the text when time allowed during an expedition to the Simpson Desert seeking marsupial moles, which spend their entire time underground! My son’s partner, Bich Anh, and her brother, Minh, who saved my bacon a couple of times over computer problems. Two Ayers great-­grandchildren. The late John H. Bagot, when well in his nineties, was full of interesting reminiscences, particularly of his grandmother Josey – Lucy Josephine Bagot (née Ayers) – or ‘Black Granny’. Joanna Catois in Paris, aged 98, was also ready to impart lively memories of her mother, Amy Josephine Cowle (née Ayers), and Amy’s elder sister, Mary Elizabeth, Sir Henry’s eldest grandchild. Joanna also had touching reminiscences of her grandmother, Ada Ayers (née Morphett). John Ayers, Ian H. Lloyd and their cousin Gerald S. Hargrave, descendants through Ayers’ son Harry and his wife Ada, for their help and encouragement.\n\nxiv\n\nAyers_final2.indd 14\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxv\n\nGerry took a particular interest and encouraged me at all points. Through his invitation, I was guest speaker at the commemoration of the 110th anniversary of Sir Henry’s death, in 2007, when John H. Bagot memorably laid a wreath on his great-­grandfather’s grave; since John’s death, his son Charles has continued to take an interest in and support the project. Francis Carpenter, Joanna Catois’ son, keen on history in general and keen that the life story of his eminent forebear at last be told, and through whose indefatigable efforts the project has been brought to its conclusion. Francis’ cousin James Knapp and his wife Dolly have also been kind in support, in memory of both James’ mother Josephine and his aunt Geraldine, elder sisters of Joanna Catois, all three the daughters of Amy Josephine Cowle (née Ayers). Ross Mathews, for facilitating my researches among late-­appearing Henry Ayers papers in the archives of Evans and Ayers. These included Henry and Anne’s marriage certificate, and information about the family’s early days in Adelaide, clearly not available when Lucy Lockett Ayers compiled her biographical note in 1946. Gerald Hargrave’s sisters, Susanne Newsom and Marianne Davidson, who entrusted me with Ayers papers in the Hargrave family after Lucy Lockett Ayers’ days. Also, to Marianne’s son James who, with no prompting whatsoever from me, corroborated what had only been my speculation regarding the naming of Uluru ‘Ayers Rock’. ¯ Mark Allen, a descendant through Fred Ayers, for maintaining his interest in, and support for, a biography of Sir Henry. John and Glenys Carpenter, current owners of the Store and storekeeper’s cottage at the Burra mine, for their welcome, and to Rod and Colleen Nelson, owners of Thomas Williams’ cottage, similarly. Old family friends, the Wrights, of Sauchie-­by-­Alloa, confirmed that bits of 1846 brick scattered in the Store yard, marked ‘Clackmannan’, would indeed have come from their area. Dr Bill Jones, of Cardiff University’s History Department, for his encouragement and the supply of information, particularly about H.W. Schneider, and for locating information about Edward Stephens in the Melbourne archives of the ANZ bank. Staff of the State Library of South Australia who have been most helpful over the years. Those I know by name include Neil Thomas – who has his own family connection with Burra. His knowledge and conversation have always been helpful and encouraging, while his erstwhile colleague, Roger ‘the Conservator’, kindly offered me study of the newly acquired Coke Papers, prior to his specialist ministrations. To Jan Jones, over an elusive Lantern cartoon, to June Edwards over the H.L. and A.E. Ayers Papers, to Andrew Piper and,\n\nAyers_final2.indd 15\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nxvi\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nparticularly, Brian Bingley who assisted greatly in the process of my obtaining images from the Collection for the book’s illustrations. Marilyn Jones, Local Studies Librarian at Swansea’s central library, who supplied answers to questions regarding the mid-­nineteenth-­century Swansea– South Australia links. The always cheery Hannah Phillip – formerly the National Trust of South Australia’s Manager of Ayers House Museum, Adelaide, and her volunteer guides – especially for their conversation on things Ayersian over morning tea while I studied the Ayers letters of 1870. Hannah’s successors Elspeth Grant and Apryl Morden have also been most helpful. The House has been very kind in allowing use of Collection images which are itemised in the Illustrations list. Ben Storer and Grace Moore, at Uluru Media, for their consultations with ¯ the Anangu custodians of Uluru, in my endeavour to ensure that references to, ¯ ¯ and the depiction of, ‘Ayers Rock’ – ‘whitefella’ history – are not disrespectful to Anangu sensitivities.

Certainly, it takes us from the ¯ beginnings of a struggling colony in Australia – one without convicts – to the brink of Australian Federation. However, it is also very much a British story, as well as a tale of political and industrial intrigue, office rivalry, and family joys and heartbreak. Global financial crises also feature. Australia’s weathering of the early twenty-­ first-­century version has been largely credited to the country’s resource-­rich base. The ‘soft landing’ has been provided by the continued voracious demand for raw materials from a growing and powerful nation – China. In Henry Ayers’ day that country would have been Britain. So it was, more than a century and a half ago, for one of the ‘proto-­Australias’, the very young British colony of South Australia, which was foundering at its very outset. ‘Gold!’ would be the cry just a few years later in the colony of Victoria, next door, but in the 1840s – coinciding with a fevered expansion of railways back Home – the discovery of copper in South Australia was no less tantalizing, not only for the migrants, but for the magnates of Britain’s Industrial Revolution. Copper mania was itself a virulent contagion. ‘Australia’s first mining industry giant’ was how Henry Ayers was hailed, as inaugural President of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy towards the end of a long life in the South Australian homeland he had chosen as a young man. A giant, then, in the life of the ‘Monster Mine’ which,\n\nxviii\n\nAyers_final2.indd 18\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nfollowing discovery of the ore in 1845, was soon ‘saving’ the colony by alone satisfying a twentieth of the world’s copper hunger. Copper for locomotives, copper for sheathing the bottoms of wooden ships and, as that use fell away, the need for copper wiring for telegraphy meant a rising demand for the commodity which South Australia could provide in abundance. With Henry as the steering force behind the Monster Mine, the colony could see itself throwing away its training-­wheels and usurping its parent’s trade with India and – yes – China. In its raw-­material wealth, it rivalled Cuba and a growing Chile. This little Britain beyond the waves – showing scant regard for the Aboriginal owners – was designed to be a non-­convict, non-­establishment choice for respectable young emigrants. Respectable, though from modest beginnings, Henry Ayers chanced all in the migration adventure which would make his fortune. A powerful figure in the copper industry, and a shrewd financier in his own right, Henry then emerged onto South Australia’s political stage, once such a thing had been built as the colony came of age. A patriotic South Australian by the 1860s, and rising to the position of Premier, Ayers seized the chance for the colony’s expansion across the continent to the north. He was determined to deny the neighbouring colonies the chance to consign South Australia to a backwater, should they grab the coming international telegraph line – the internet of its day. This man who loved science, and the advances it brought, would throw whatever resources he could at this transcontinental project, sputtering as it was when he came back into power in 1872. On several occasions, when the young colony faced political crises, it was Ayers who would pull together a government where others could not. In tracing Ayers’ life story, we are given an insight into the experiences of some of those Britons who decided, in the 1830s and ’40s, to exchange an uncertain, and probably unhappy, ‘Dickensian’ existence for a future in South Australia. While still a risky option, it seemed a path worth attempting, offering as it did the promise of life in a new and – as they believed – well-­planned society. Through Ayers’ story, we are also brought face to face with re-­evaluating the cultural and political twists and turns of our own day. So many issues that seemed settled in Ayers’ time have continued to resonate in the early twenty-­ first century as subjects of open debate. For example, now as then an innate Australian sense of defencelessness and insecurity means that the powerful friend – in Ayers’ day, of course, Britain – must be courted at all costs. At the time, this was reflected in the extravagant loyalism shown in the welcome organized by Ayers for the first ever royal visit to Australia, with scant local acknowledgement of murmurings\n\nAyers_final2.indd 19\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\nof republicanism at Home. Private–public partnerships were well understood, Ayers favouring lightly regulated financial institutions – relying on the close scrutiny of shareholders and investors – but as he was by then himself a financier, he would, wouldn’t he? Privatization, if not then a recognized term, was certainly an accepted concept. Whether trade unions were a good or a bad thing was debated, as were women’s rights. Protection versus free trade, ethics in the business and political spheres, a role or not for foreign investment, how to treat foreign workers, the separation of Church and state, all were big issues of the day, and Ayers would have been able to give you a lively discussion on any of them. The growth of the idea of Australian federalism, with debates on its desirability, also spanned the majority of Ayers’ life as an immigrant – nay, an ‘economic migrant’– and Ayers represented South Australia in intercolonial conferences which prepared the way. In 2001, Australians were told by the then Prime Minister to celebrate the wonder of federalism at its centenary, although soon afterwards the very same person maintained that, if the country were starting all over again, federation would not be the answer! Though some politicians at the banquet table in the Adelaide Town Hall, in 1867, were willing to trumpet federalism, and even wanted their royal guest proclaimed hereditary Viceroy – or even King Alfred of Australia – Ayers, as Premier, made no such suggestion. Henry did his level best to prevent his own business interests from being pummelled by several international financial shocks, and the recent global financial crisis would not have surprised him. He would probably have taken it quite philosophically and, in government, would have reached for the same tools to repair the damaged economy as today’s leaders have done: government borrowing for infrastructure projects – although, in what little official memory there is of him, he is depicted as a non-­borrower. Those who do not learn from history, we are told, are doomed to make the same mistakes and, as I have read and researched Ayers’ story, I conclude that that is not far off the mark. In 1873 the whitefella ‘discovered’ Uluru and attached the Ayers name to it, ¯ giving the now Sir Henry Ayers a hint of immortality. How far his industrial and political contributions would be remembered, in his colony or around the wider federated Australia, beyond his day remained to be seen. However, the Ayers name would continue to resonate around the world, drawing countless individuals to make a kind of pilgrimage to one of the most remote places on the planet. Could Henry, watching the retreating headlands of Plymouth Sound as he farewelled Olde England and his youthful self, have ever imagined what a mark he might make? Never a mark such as this, surely?\n\nAyers_final2.indd 20\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n1\n\nKk ‘IN SEARCH OF A PLACE TO ASCEND’\n\nSunday July 20 – Ayers Rock. Barometer 28.07 in., wind east. I rode round the foot of the rock in search of a place to ascend; found a waterhole on the south side, near which I made an attempt to reach the top but found it hopeless. . . . Seeing a spur less abrupt than the rest of the rock, I left the camels here, and after walking and scrambling two miles barefooted, over sharp rocks, succeeded in reaching the summit, and had a view that repaid me for my trouble. . . . This rock is certainly the most wonderful natural feature I have ever seen . . .\n\nScribbled in his diary, that southern winter morning in 1873, surveyor William Gosse thus recorded his awe as the first white person to reach the central Australian monolith that he named Ayers Rock. Today, the image of its moulded reddish brown form is as familiar to many across the world as the Great Barrier Reef and the more human-­scaled Sydney Opera House. Within Australia, the Rock’s ancient indigenous name, Uluru, has rightly supplanted the nineteenth-­ ¯ century commemoration, but the name of Ayers rings on around the world well over a century after the ‘discovery’ of the Rock. Yet how many of us have ever paused to wonder what sort of man was he after whom this stunning landmark was named? Was he – could he have been – someone who measured up in any way to the giant accolade accorded him? The signs are encouraging when one discovers that Henry Ayers served in the highest elected office of the South Australian polity, as its Premier, no\n\n1\n\nAyers_final2.indd 1\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n2\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nfewer than seven times. An easy task, then, one would think, to find a solidly bound biography of the man, to discover his achievements, if only through the tinted lenses of a late nineteenth-­century hagiography – but there is none. Ayers’ granddaughter, Lucy Lockett Ayers, intended to write his biography, but bequeathed us only a little printed pamphlet of half a dozen or so pages in the 1940s. Otherwise, Ayers is largely – one might almost say conspicuously – missing from accounts of Australian history. As late as the Depression years of the 1930s, his memory could be invoked by the press as an inspirational model for the young generation facing challenging times, but soon afterwards, memories of the man faded. The name of Ayers became simply synonymous with the Rock. Yet, he was a complex character who played an integral and leading role in the development of the then British Province of South Australia. Born on May Day, 1821, his journey to high political office began with migration as an artisan from his native England in 1840. How did this emigrant, who described himself as a carpenter, come to be a serial Premier of South Australia, President of its Legislative Council, knight of the realm and respected ambassador for his colony’s interests at several of the intercolonial conferences that paved the way towards Australian federation? What, in fact, led him to leave his native shores in the first place?\n\nAiming for ‘Improvement’ It would have taken a brave man to commit himself to the adventure of migration to the fledgling colony of South Australia, which was a mere four years old in 1840. Perhaps the impetuosity of youth was Henry Ayers’ catalyst, for he was only 19 when, with his new wife and in-­laws, he took ship for the long passage. The sea, though not exactly in his blood, was a near neighbour as he had been born and raised in the briny air of Portsmouth, a British naval base. Well within Ayers’ father’s memory, Admiral Nelson had joined His Majesty’s Ship Victory from the town itself, for his determined pursuit of the combined French and Spanish fleets. Ayers’ father, William, was a shipwright who married Elizabeth Breaks. His parents’ longevity preoccupied Henry in later life, even calculating their average age at death, namely ‘79 years 78 days’, with the parental generation overall reaching an even greater average of ‘84 years and 264 days’. He seemed to be desperately seeking guidance, in his maturity, about his own life expectancy. Well he might have, because the record of his own generation was far less encouraging. William’s status might have been no grander than that of a skilled artisan but he recognized education as the best route to success in life. He ensured with\n\nAyers_final2.indd 2\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n‘In search of a place to ascend’\n\n3\n\nwhatever means he had that Henry, though not his eldest son, enjoyed at least a minimal education. Henry entered the Beneficial Society’s school the day before his sixth birthday. Doubtless it was the three Rs that were inculcated. Like the Army and Navy, the school used flogging as an ‘encouragement’ to its more reluctant pupils, boys receiving their punishment embracing a pillar of the Georgian-­style building. The school was not without its forward-­looking methods, though, as a pupil-­teacher, or monitor, system had been introduced just before Henry’s enrolment, known as the ‘Madras’ System. Carrot, stick or both must have been effective because Henry was sufficiently advanced to be able to take up a position in the Portsea office of S. Blyth, solicitor, at the age of 11 years. These were not exciting times, though, in Portsmouth. The Navy was in the doldrums and the Napoleonic War a decade in the past. Since the war, high unemployment in Britain had encouraged unrest. The ordinary people were seeking ways of righting some of the wrongs they felt they had to bear due to the oppressive impacts of the Industrial Revolution, then gathering pace. The ideas of that novel breed, economic theorists, were being lapped up by a working people thirsting for knowledge; as Asa Briggs (1959) reports it, the politician Henry Brougham observed: ‘The schoolmaster has been abroad in the land.’ Religious Nonconformists, and some Evangelical Anglicans, encouraged this aspiration for an improved lot in this life as well as, perhaps, in the next. Not until Henry Ayers was a toddler did that gloomy era start to give way to one embracing a more relaxed outlook. Just before Henry started school, Britain experienced its first cyclical boom period. Inevitably, bust followed, with unrest simmering again. In 1830, George IV’s brother, William, took to the throne and with the new king came a more forward-­looking government. The new reign began at a worrying time, though, with the French having embroiled themselves in another Revolution. Uncertainty across the Channel reignited unrest in Britain, and the new government had to offer the enticements of reform. As Henry stepped into the world as an employee – or employé, as he would have written it – Parliament passed the First Reform Bill, somewhat enlarging the number of the voting public. However, it would be another half century before the majority of adult males could vote, and almost a century before women could do so, at least in Britain. Henry Ayers would see that happen sooner, elsewhere. The ‘Great’ Reform Act was passed, but it was a tepid compromise. The 1830s, Henry’s teenage years, were increasingly a period of unrest and agitation. A run of bad harvests, coupled with commercial recession stemming from the United States, resulted in high living costs and high unemployment. The industrial north, in particular, was badly affected. A million were without work and facing the hated workhouse, systematically\n\nAyers_final2.indd 3\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n4\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nintroduced to be as unpleasant as possible, to deter the supposedly work-­shy. Jobs, when available, entailed virtually unlimited hours and even the regime of a ten-­hour day for six days a week was not enacted by Parliament until 1847. Political reform had fallen short and some idealists worked from newer forums to try to effect ‘Improvement’ – the goal of the age for all but the most reactionary and complacent. Furthermore, certain thinkers turned their attention to the possibility of creating a new, fairer, though still recognizably British, society overseas. At 15 years of age, in 1836, Henry found himself in the very place where a ship was being readied to carry a body of early emigrants to the brand new colony of South Australia. HMS Buffalo, a naval store-­ship, was being converted for this pioneering voyage in Portsmouth dockyard. The Governor-­to-­be, Captain John Hindmarsh, was also to command the vessel on the lengthy voyage. He had been at sea, man and boy, and was used to expressing his wishes in suitably salty language, which offended the ears of some of the pious, middle-­class family members who shared the Captain’s Table. The Buffalo put out into the Channel in August 1836, with a good proportion of the emigrant party from the Portsmouth area. Whether Henry then knew his future wife, Anne Potts, is unknown, but we do know that her brother, Frank, was aboard as an emigrant. Frank Potts, at 21, was a retired seafarer. He had trained from the age of nine on Victory herself and at 14 had sailed aboard HMS Challenger, witnessing the raising of the Union flag inaugurating the colony of Western Australia. He went on to sail Arabian and Indian waters before returning Home, via Australia, the Pacific islands and Cape Horn – passing the Beagle carrying Charles Darwin in the opposite direction. With the Challenger’s crew paid off, Frank stayed with his parents, at St Mary’s Street, Portsea, working as a tallow chandler. Perhaps this was comfortable enough for a while, but after three years he took the emigration plunge and became a South Australian pioneer, working initially as a crewman for the colony’s Harbour Master. Flushed with the enthusiasm of a thrusting young colonist, Frank must have sent the message Home that prospects looked good. The ‘systematic’ migration theorists, such as the celebrated Edward Gibbon Wakefield, had wanted to avoid the taint of convictism associated with the existing Australian colonies. They looked to the creation of new homelands for serious-­minded, thrifty, hard-­working, young married couples, who could go forth and multiply, freed from the backward-­looking establishment of the Mother Country. With a modest capital, they could buy land for a reasonable sum, work it steadily and hope to improve their holdings. They could be assisted by labourers who might amass sufficient funds to acquire their own\n\nAyers_final2.indd 4\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n‘In search of a place to ascend’\n\n5\n\nsmallholdings and thus move up the social ladder. In theory, at least, the only lands to be purchased were those with which the local Aboriginal population was happy to part. The money from the sale of these ‘Crown’ lands would fund the emigration of further struggling families. Where the numbers of young couples fell short, the difference should be made up by marriageable youngsters in roughly equal proportions of males and females, the high-­minded theorists believing that the preponderantly male ‘convict’ colonies encouraged all sorts of sinfulness. These young emigrants were to be God-­fearing, to meet the expectations of the religious idealists, found in some numbers alongside the purely commercially minded colonizing theorists. A vast tract of land suitable for this new colony had been earmarked. South-­central Australia’s coast had been charted by the Royal Navy’s Matthew Flinders some 30 years earlier, and the area had since been visited by sealers and whalers, some from as far away as the United States. These had over-­wintered in the area, sometimes upsetting the local Kaurna and Ramindjeri peoples by absconding with some of their womenfolk to Kangaroo Island. More recently, Captain Charles Sturt had made his way from New South Wales exploring the length of the mighty River Murray system, hoping to prove it a viable communication link between the east coast and the lands bordering these sealing and whaling waters. Wakefield and his friends at Westminster, such as the Radical MP, George Grote, put up a parliamentary bill which saw the formation of the Province of South Australia in 1834. It is ironic, for these forward thinkers and frustrated radicals that, as the proclamation of the Province happened at the very end of William IV’s reign, the capital was politely named after his queen, Adelaide; she was certainly believed to have strongly opposed recent reforms. The colonizing enthusiasts were anxious to get the venture under way and preparations were supported particularly by Tyneside entrepreneur George Fife Angas, a staunch Baptist who saw the advantages for Nonconformists of living and flourishing in a community free from the ‘establishment’ influences of the Anglican Church. Possibly, the Potts family took little persuasion to follow Frank, with the bad harvests in Britain, recession and the country awash with agitation. This disquiet focused itself in 1838 in the movement symbolized by the National Charter, a wish-­list of reforms, such as universal (male) suffrage, voting by secret ballot and the abolition of the requirement to be a property owner in order to stand for Parliament. Another point was payment for MPs, which would have enabled a person from society’s lower echelons to take a seat. Henry would have a view on politicians’ pay. When the Chartists’ demands were rejected by Parliament in 1839, it fell to Sir Charles Napier to quell unrest in the north. Napier had ruled himself\n\nAyers_final2.indd 5\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n6\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nout from becoming South Australia’s first Governor. Briggs (1959) quotes Napier, who, harbouring sympathy for the oppressed masses, found his duty unpleasant: ‘Would that I had gone to [South] Australia and thus been saved this work, produced by Tory injustice and Whig [read proto-­Liberal] imbecility;’ adding: ‘the doctrine of slowly reforming while men are starving is of all things the most silly: famishing men cannot wait’. Late in life, Henry Ayers gave a celebrated address to the Australian Natives’ Association, still delivered in the brogue of his native Hampshire, with his dropped ‘h’s and country burr. In it, he outlined some of the attitudes prevalent among young prospective colonists in the later 1830s. In his pencilled notes, he observes that many young couples hastened their marriages in anticipation of emigration, and so may it have been for Henry and Anne: There is no better period at which a man may commence a great or important or an arduous undertaking than when he has the enthusiastic help and sympathy of a loving wife. It is a time when new enterprises may be undertaken with better hope of success, for man and wife are possessed of double strength with twice the amount of hope and exhilaration than they have at any other era of their existence.\n\nWhat induced Henry to leave his office position and risk life, limb and career in ocean voyaging and colonial pioneering is nowhere made clear. Coming of a family that was at least nominally Anglican, he was apparently not fleeing the oppression of an uncongenial established Church. Perhaps there was a dead-­ men’s-­shoes situation over promotion at work. He certainly later acknowledged the unsettled and unpromising state of Britain as strongly motivating educated young people and those with trades to emigrate. By 1840, Henry Ayers had determined on a life in South Australia. A positive impetus may have come from his prospective in-­laws. Lawrence Potts had brought his young family to Portsmouth from Hounslow some time between 1816 and 1820. As a widower with an eight year old, Anne, and Frank at five, Lawrence had married Elizabeth Lockett. Elizabeth appears the breadwinner, as a milliner and dressmaker, with Lawrence, somewhat getting on in years, no longer practising linen-­drapery. They were living in much the same part of town as the Ayers family, but how Henry and Anne met and resolved on a life together on the other side of the globe must remain a matter of conjecture. Elizabeth Potts’ elder daughter, also an Elizabeth, had married John Churcher in 1830 and, by 1838, her younger sister Margaretta (Margaret) had followed her down the aisle. Stepsister Anne was to follow their example in not marrying young.\n\nAyers_final2.indd 6\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n‘In search of a place to ascend’\n\n7\n\nAn 1869 copy of Henry and Anne’s marriage certificate shows that elderly father-­in-­law Potts was by 1840 carrying on the light trade of bookseller. The certificate answers a few basic questions, but also deepens a mystery: was Henry and Anne’s marriage, at the outset, a love-­match at all? The age disparity is somewhat unusual; he was just 19, she getting on for a decade older. The certificate dates her baptism at New Year, 1813, and indeed the Hounslow register records her birth as 28 November 1812. Many years later Henry noted her birth date as November 1813. Had Anne knocked a year off her age in an attempt to minimize the difference between them, or was she herself simply mistaken? Did Henry go along with Anne’s accepted age, reducing the gap for the sake of his vanity? Perhaps he thought a slightly smaller gap would help to overcome any family disapproval; he was the ‘baby’ after all. In his application to the Emigration Commissioners for a free passage, he gave his own age correctly, but lopped a few more years off Anne’s, claiming for her a rather generic 21. On the copy of the marriage certificate, they are both noted as simply ‘of full age’, which of course Henry was not. The other question thrown up by the certificate concerns the wedding venue. There were several churches on the east side of Portsmouth harbour, where Henry worked and both families lived, including St Mary’s, Kingston with which both families were associated. So why did they marry in St Mary’s, Alverstoke? This church was well to the west side of the harbour, beyond the imposing Fort Blockhouse. A possible, though very faded, signpost to this venue is the fact that Alverstoke was home to Churchers, of whom there were very few in the rest of Hampshire. Anne’s stepsister, Elizabeth Churcher, had not yet emigrated to Canada, following her sister, Margaret Baker and brother, William Lockett; she witnessed Henry and Anne’s marriage. Possibly, a Churcher family connection enabled the ceremony to take place in Alverstoke. At all events, the circumstances surrounding this wedding do not seem quite normal. Was it initially a marriage of convenience? If the Potts’ main aim was to reunite with Frank – Elizabeth Potts wrote revealing such a desire – it made sense for Anne at least to get a free passage as part of a needed, young, productive married couple. Perhaps she even instigated, and drew young Henry into, the plan. From Henry’s viewpoint, as he would not qualify for a free passage as a lawyer’s clerk, he had to convince emigration agents that he was skilled with his hands. What better way to prove this than to have it in black and white on the marriage certificate? Henry Ayers was a ‘carpenter’. With father William a shipwright, and eldest brother William himself a carpenter, Henry could probably talk at least a little ‘carpenterese’. St Mary’s, Alverstoke, may have been sufficiently isolated from the Portsea world of the Ayers and Potts families as to allow the best chance of success for Henry’s subterfuge.\n\nAyers_final2.indd 7\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n8\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nThe incumbent of St Mary’s, Kingston, might have done more than just raise a quizzical look had Henry tried his gambit there.\n\nThe State of the Colony The Potts and Ayers couples received news of the young colony from Frank but, since it generally took four or five months for correspondence to travel back Home, they could not know that, by the time they set sail in July 1840, South Australia’s prospects had turned quite ugly. The theories of the Wakefields, Angases and Grotes had failed to work as efficiently in practice as these Systematic Colonizers had hoped. Difficulties in preparing city and country land for sale, while also seeking other sites for settlements and harbours, meant the first colonists were slow in establishing farming. Furthermore, the theorists had not accounted for problems arising from land-­purchasers who had no intentions of experiencing personally the rigours of a pioneering life, preferring to have agents do the task or, worse still, do nothing and wait for the property values to rise before walking away with the profits. In many cases, the earliest colonists were forced to remain in the security of the nascent city of Adelaide, where land speculation quickly absorbed their interest and, often, their funds. Fortunes, even modest ones, could be lost as well as made. At several moments, whether the new colony could actually feed itself was in doubt. Governor Hindmarsh faced dissatisfied colonists and rubbed up regularly against his co-­authority figures, Resident Commissioner James Hurtle Fisher, and Surveyor-­General Colonel Light. Hindmarsh’s performance caused dissatisfaction, both within the colony and at Home, resulting in his recall. His replacement, Lieutenant-­Colonel George Gawler, resolved to keep the South Australian venture afloat at all costs. Fairly large-­scale public works were undertaken, not only to turn the Government Hut into a Government House, but also to otherwise adorn this rough and ready young capital. When Gawler’s lavish spending rang alarm bells at the heart of the British government, which would be footing the bill, it became clear that he, too, would have to be recalled; it was by then too late for second thoughts by Henry, Anne and her parents. The shock of insolvency hit the colony. With the Adelaide Treasury empty, the first signs of unemployment were recorded in June 1840, the same month that Henry abandoned the Portsea solicitor’s office and took the ferry to marry Anne. After just a month of wedlock, the couple set sail on 15 July, aboard the Fairfield, bound for South Australia. Whether those aboard ever expected to see their home shores again, we cannot know; it would be something for which Henry longingly wished. His,\n\nAyers_final2.indd 8\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n‘In search of a place to ascend’\n\n9\n\nafter all, had been the sacrifice of leaving Home, and family, behind. What did his brothers, William and John, and his sister – another Elizabeth – make of the adventure? Were they quietly envious of their little brother’s courage and the opportunities that might come his way? One can only guess at the emotions that William and Elizabeth Ayers must have experienced at the departure of their youngest, suddenly a married man, and just as suddenly sailing for an experiment of a colony on the far side of the world.\n\nA Fresh Start The Ayers and the Potts shared the experience of thousands who voyaged to Australia under sail. The care of passengers was quite closely scrutinized. Medical attention was mandatory aboard these ships and some captains’ remuneration was held over as a bonus, paid out once their charges had provided a glowing reference for their paternal qualities displayed during the vicissitudes of the voyage. By 17 December, the Fairfield came to anchor in South Australian waters in Holdfast Bay, Colonel Light’s prized anchorage. Frank Potts was undoubtedly able to put out to the Fairfield before she even came finally to anchor – perhaps in the boat he had built, Musquito – to be reunited with his family after over four years. Even if he had known his new brother-­in-­law previously, he would only have remembered Henry as a lad. He now met a wavy-­haired young man of average height, still with the slimness and wispy beard of youth. But what a mix of emotions Frank must have experienced to find him accompanied by only his father and sister. Despite the comparative safety of the Australian voyage, tragedy could and did strike during the months at sea. On 8 October, short of Cape Town, Mrs Potts had died, racked by seasickness. She was 66. Consigning her body to the deep, it only remained for Anne and Henry to try to comfort old Lawrence Potts in the loss of a second wife. Henry wasted no time pretending to live up to claims of carpentry skills. Following Christmas celebrations, he began work in the law office of J.H. Richman, on Adelaide’s desirable North Terrace. For a while, the Ayers would have to settle for accommodation in less significant parts of town. Lucy Lockett Ayers says their initial address is unknown but, by 1843, they were right in the centre of the ‘square mile’, in Wakefield Street. Henry could count himself extremely lucky to have secured a position in his true field so soon. There was a surfeit of young middle-­class professional men, in a colonial population of about 16,000, which was thinly spread over an area some 100 miles by 50, though still heavily centralized in the city. Four years of development, even with Gawler’s boost to public works, had not raised the capital to any great heights of amenity. New arrivals often suffered\n\nAyers_final2.indd 9\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n10\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nfrom dysentery, as a result of a less than satisfactory water supply. This was sourced largely from the sluggish waterholes in the bed of the River Torrens, which meandered through the shallow valley it had long ago cut, now serving to decorously separate Colonel Light’s North Adelaide from his city proper. The Torrens, or as the Kaurna Aboriginal inhabitants knew it, the Karrawirraparri, could sometimes run over-­vigorously in winter, but the Ayers had arrived in the first of the hot summer months, which was a testing time for Europeans each year. New arrivals suffered eye afflictions and, as the visitor Edward Lloyd described in 1844, the dry north wind could induce a feeling of fever and the very copper coins in one’s pocket felt ‘odiously hot’. Lloyd described the red dust from the mere three streets that were reasonably developed, caking buildings, as well as citizens striding purposefully about the town. The residents of the young metropolis had just been given a chance to make improvements for themselves. Governor Gawler, who personally embodied the powers of British Government representative and Colonial Commissioner, had encouraged the formation of an elected City Council. It is as well to remember that this privilege was then a novelty for many sizeable British towns; some old boroughs had charters dating from the Middle Ages, but many of the newer towns, growing through the effects of the Industrial Revolution, had only just been given the opportunity to form representative bodies. Perhaps Gawler’s timing was not the best, though. The Council was formed just when many colonists were heading out of the security of Adelaide into the surrounding districts, applying what little farming expertise they had in a novel environment of both soil and climate. The city’s population was actually declining, then, at a time when a rate needed raising for the Council to be able to make improvements and generally fulfil its obligations. The first mayor was the former Resident Commissioner alongside Hindmarsh, James Hurtle Fisher, whose powers had now been combined with those of Governor Gawler. Henry had only been in the colony for six months when Gawler was replaced by a much younger army officer, Captain George Grey, who had made a name for himself as an explorer in Western Australia. At 27, his youth was held against him both by the local press and, naturally, by the recalled Governor’s family. It was Grey’s duty to rescue South Australia from Gawler’s profligate regime – as it was perceived by the Colonial Office in Whitehall. Retrenchment was Grey’s order of the day, bringing an end to governmental support for any surplus labour. Hard times ensued for the colonists and Grey’s resolve was tested when the hungry unemployed and the bankrupt marched on Government House. With coinage short and land values plunging, Grey plumbed the depths of local unpopularity, although he did do something to alleviate distress by\n\nAyers_final2.indd 10\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n‘In search of a place to ascend’\n\n11\n\ncharitable giving out of his personal resources. As 1841 wore on, Henry must have counted himself extremely lucky to have continued in employment at all and, during 1842, numbers of pioneering colonists simply gave up and left. At some point during their first year in the colony, Anne, at least, found prospects dispiriting, and put her feelings into verse addressed to their pet cockatoo: I wander’d forth in this new Land to think upon my [H]ome, To heave a sigh to absent friends, and ask why did I roam? Why leave the peaceful happy vale, and cot that once was mine, But leagues divide me from that spot, ’tis useless to repine. I’ll think on this poor captive bird, and learn from him to bear The cruel loss of [H]ome, and friends, a fate he seems to share. Sweet bird to ease my exiled heart, Ah! say thou dost not pine For thy early scenes, and mountain range, that ne’er again is thine. Happily thou dost forget the past, not dread the coming morrow, Nor wear thy heart, in vain regret in hopeless, ceaseless, sorrow. Such tiny limbs to bear a chain, humanity ’twould shock ye, The gentle creature raised his head, and answered, ‘Pretty Cockey.’\n\nCockey seems a good listener and capable, with a couple of well-­chosen words at just the right moment, of taking the sting from Anne’s melancholy. The one bright light was an overwhelming harvest which, even with the assistance of many unaccustomed reapers, could not all be gathered in. Perhaps Henry turned out to help. This is not as far-­fetched as it might seem because, over the following two years, Henry owned a small farm, to the city’s south-­west. Whether he worked on it himself, providing for the family table ‘allotment’-style, or had someone work it for him is not clear. Financially, it was not a great success, as he lost almost £60 on the deal when disposing of the property. He had the upkeep of a ‘poney’, as well, which he also parted with – at a loss – and one can readily picture the little animal’s short legs going nineteen-­to-­the-­dozen in carrying Henry down to dig over his plot. In March 1842, Anne gave birth to their first child; she was in her thirtieth year and Henry a couple of months off his age of majority. Perhaps feelings of apprehension during her pregnancy had contributed to the nostalgic mood captured in her poem to her confessor Cockey. She had been facing the ordeal of childbirth and motherhood without a mother-­figure, or even her older\n\nAyers_final2.indd 11\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n12\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nstepsisters. She faced the dread ‘coming morrow’ with only a very youthful husband, and an elderly father, for reassurance. The Ayers heir, safely delivered, was named after, perhaps, the two most influential people in Henry’s new life so far – Frank, his brother-­in-­law, and Richman, in whose service the Ayers had enjoyed some security during this very difficult period. The following month, Ayers moved into the joint practice which J.H. Richman formed with his new partner, Macdonald, in Wakefield Street. This was a come-­down after North Terrace and a good step from the main business streets. This may have had immediate implications for their legal business as Henry notes a more prestigious address alongside the entry in his Memorabilia: ‘afterwards King William Street’. Within a year, though, Henry moved to a position in the Stephens Place law practice of James Hurtle Fisher, ex-­Resident Commissioner, and now ­ex-­Mayor of Adelaide to boot; Fisher had resigned when an even higher rate could not be raised to pay off the debts that the Council had already incurred. At the following municipal election, a mere 135 citizens had bothered to enrol to vote, making polling pointless. Governor Grey made a feint of trying to rescue the municipality’s honour by co-­opting influential citizens onto the Council, but he happily acquiesced in London’s decision to end the local government experiment, when that instruction arrived by mid-­1843. The seeming civic apathy and failure of the Council was not a good advertisement for the colony, boding ill for its chances of successfully achieving representative government, which had already been promised, once its population reached 50,000. Henry and Anne were blessed with a second son, Harry Lockett, in April 1844. His second name kept alive the former married name of Anne’s stepmother, after her sad death at sea. Henry immediately ‘hopped’ law practices again, becoming employed by Smart, Johnson, and Bayne, solicitors, also of Stephens Place. This would prove the crucial, positioning move in shaping his career, and in deciding the sort of life his family could enjoy. The Ayers’ three and a half years in South Australia had coincided with the poorest conditions and prospects that the colony was to know until the threat to its very survival presented by the gold-­rush in neighbouring Victoria. Despite this, industrious Henry had obviously made the best of his opportunities. He augmented his income through a sideline in supplying law stationery. He was also picking up plenty of extra pay through ‘overworking’ and, by 1844, had built a house in Pulteney Street and was no longer paying rent. Rather, he was collecting rent on three properties, one a present from a very generous Frank Potts. Having paid back modest loans to his brother, John, and brother-­in-­ law Potts, the astute Ayers would soon be in a position to lend money, to\n\nAyers_final2.indd 12\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n‘In search of a place to ascend’\n\n13\n\ne­ rstwhile employer J.H. Richman for one. Henry was using the downturn in the economy to his advantage and, all told, circumstances were starting to vindicate the decision to emigrate. Yet even greater opportunities soon beckoned.\n\nAyers_final2.indd 13\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n2\n\nKk THE SECRETARY\n\nThe colony’s fortunes turned in 1844. Governor Grey’s stringencies were starting to pay off, and the working of a sizeable body of copper ore about 50 miles to Adelaide’s north-­east, at Kapunda, indicated a future for the colony beyond wool and wheat. This mineral discovery by a son of local pastoralist Captain Bagot, while out tending his father’s flock, must have had a consonantly Old Testament ring about it to the more pious colonists. Mineral fever ensued. Every shepherd and country bumpkin seemed able to turf out metalliferous pebbles from the deep recesses of a smock or greatcoat, to tantalize the greedy or gullible in town with sufficient capital to underwrite a small mining venture. Nor were speculators at Home behindhand, once the outlook for a return on investment in the colony looked brighter. In 1845, extraordinary copper lodes were discovered near the Burra Burra Creek by distinctly poor shepherds on ‘Crown’ land – actually country of the Ngadjuri people. The name of this large watercourse was not in fact Aboriginal, but derived from the Hindi for ‘Big Big’. The area was almost twice as far from Adelaide and its port as Kapunda, a critical consideration in realizing the potential of the find. The raw material needed processing with expertise born of long experience, best found within the arc of the South Wales coalfield, where copper had been smelted since Queen Elizabeth I’s time. Capitalizing on the Burra Burra finds would call for deep pockets, not only to purchase the land and work the lodes, but also to organize ore transport by land and sea.\n\n14\n\nAyers_final2.indd 14\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nThe Secretary\n\n15\n\nCaught up in the mineral fever, a group of reasonably well off city shopkeepers pooled their capital to invest in any newly discovered mineral lands, taking the name South Australian Mining Association – the SAMA. The two Burra Burra finds could be acquired in a single purchase, a ‘Special Survey’. These large acreages, well beyond the pockets of genuine small settlers, had been introduced by Governor Gawler to attract major investment from Home into the colony. The Burra Burra land was available only as an enormous ­20,000-­acre Special Survey at £1 per acre, in cash. It seemed doubtful that anyone in the colony could lay hands on such a sum. Ian Auhl, in his book The Story of the ‘Monster Mine’ (1986), quotes the rhyme doing the rounds summing up the panic: The snobs they are hurrying up and down Some lend them a sovereign and some a crown They have not a shilling in all the town To pay for a pint of wine.\n\nHe tells of elderly ladies producing what cash they had, secreted in their stocking-­tops, to help make up the total. Pivotally, Henry Ayers now became involved in SAMA activities. To understand his rise in colonial society, in its commerce, its politics and its cultural life, one must grasp the significance of the Burra enterprise and its prominent contribution to the success of an eight-­year-­old South Australia, still recovering from its first depression. Ayers himself devised a history of the SAMA, 40 years on, drafted thriftily on scraps of paper, such as the backs of Adelaide Choral Society flyers. His intention was to give some idea to the then citizens, living in something of a ‘mining depression’, of how the earlier generation had countered bad times and a want of money. It was hoped that the grouping of interested parties would prevent new mineral resources falling into the hands of single proprietors. The SAMA’s Provisional Committee first met on 5 April 1845, with Henry, he tells us, as ‘provisional Secretary’. The Association pushed its shares and petitioned the Governor to speedily put up for sale any new mineral lands. A Board of Directors was elected and a ‘secret and confidential Committee’ deputed to work with the Trustees to purchase certain Crown lands. Several of these gentlemen had recently raised their profiles in agitation to quash the ‘Parkhurst Boys’ scheme. The colony was threatened with a whiff of convictism, given the British Government’s plans to send young offenders to South Australia as supported emigrants with free pardons. The SAMA’s new committee-­men had pointed out that, if the\n\nAyers_final2.indd 15\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n16\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nscourings of Parkhurst and Pentonville were sent, it would be against the letter of the Act which had set up South Australia. On 21 April, Henry was elected Secretary. Smart and Bayne were confirmed as the Association’s solicitors and Henry’s close connection with them probably weighed with voters beyond any knowledge of his particular suitability. His duties were initially restricted to minute keeping and document copying, but on his twenty-­fourth birthday the first letter bearing his signature as Secretary was issued from Smart and Bayne’s premises. Compared with the madcap month of April, during which his family could have seen very little of Henry, May saw a welcome slackening in the break-­neck pace of meetings. According to Henry, it was to him that the shepherd, Streair, brought specimens for inspection from a lode discovered near the Burra Burra Creek, in June 1845. If the bank managers could be satisfied as to the quality of the copper find, funds for a Special Survey might be forthcoming. Henry noted that the Bank of South Australia had just over £20,000 at its command. However, in the light of previous colonial profligacy, as viewed from Home, manager Stephens was on a tight rein from London in terms of speculative lending. Perhaps he authored the letter in The South Australian Register urging people not to be distracted from the ‘main’ aim of colonizing – presumably, agrarian pursuits. Speculation, he added, would only make something of a bad name for the colony even worse. Stephens’ competitor, the more recently arrived Bank of Australasia, could only boast a quarter of the first bank’s cash on hand. The dearth of funds forced a temporary marriage of necessity between the SAMA and some wealthy landowners, to fund the land purchase. The landowning ‘Nobs’ were agreeable to then draw lots with the shopkeeping ‘Snobs’ for ownership of either Streair’s southern lode or the northern lode, spotted by shepherd Thomas Pickett. The SAMA had promised ample rewards for information about finds, and its directors later became subject to finger pointing regarding a failure to recompense the shepherds whose finds would lead others to great wealth, and the same mud stuck to Henry. Public outrage especially followed Pickett’s death through slumping – drunk – face first into his camp fire. Henry indeed tells us that he gave Streair no assurance of recompense, citing the great distance involved, estimated at over 90 miles and a three-­day journey from Adelaide. He referred him to Director Bunce, who does seem to have given him something for his trouble. Perhaps Henry’s retrospective explanation of his own role constituted self-­defence, but it does demonstrate that rewards were a matter for the directors, not the Secretary, which was at that stage a fairly lowly administrative position.\n\nAyers_final2.indd 16\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nThe Secretary\n\n17\n\nThe Register described the whole population as ‘agog’ with the antics, as though ‘mesmerised . . . from greybeard to spinster, from sedate matron or spinster of a certain age to sweet seventeen’, and carried articles on mesmerism and clairvoyance in the same edition. Not that the editor was disinclined himself to capitalize on the mesmerized; in his premises, where he also sold books, stationery and patent medicines, he added a line of geologists’ hammers. His stock of books was expanded, too, with titles to interest mineralogists and explorers. Following a cursory land survey by William Jacob – later to lend his name to one of South Australia’s most popular wine exports – Surveyor-­General Frome prepared to do the Special Survey. The Association deputed one of its own members to attend. George Strickland Kingston, formerly less-­than-­ competent deputy to founding Surveyor-­General Light, had returned to practising his real calling, as the City Council Engineer, while also dabbling in architecture. After considerable toing and froing between Frome and the pernickety Kingston, the survey was agreed and on 20 September the meeting for the divorce of Nobs and Snobs was held, as Henry later described, at Platts’ Rooms, fronting on Hindley Street. If they felt peckish, they could be well supplied with sandwiches and pastries from the little café adjoining, though each probably had a stomach full of butterflies in any case. The lots were drawn. The lucky Snobs drew the desirable northern lode, which became known as the Burra Burra Mine. The Nobs took the booby prize, the short-­ lived Princess Royal Mine. Henry had good cause for being thankful that his horse had been hitched to the SAMA’s wagon. Right in the middle of this feverish commercial activity, Anne’s father died. The Register went a little overboard in describing Lawrence Potts as approaching his ninetieth year; he was 84. It was correct, though, in believing him one of the oldest colonists, and accorded him the title ‘father of the colony’. The little notice also commended Anne Ayers and Frank Potts for their devoted care during their father’s ‘decline’, of which papa Potts could never speak highly enough. As a dutiful son-­in-­law, Henry organized and funded the funeral. Most of South Australia’s early colonists were comparatively young people, separated from the older generations of their families; so it now was for Henry and Anne.\n\nExploiting the Prize The SAMA’s Board turned to the task of exploiting its prize. Cornish copper miner Thomas Roberts was engaged to undertake the initial blasting. Before heading north, he received full instructions in the hand of Henry Ayers, specifying in businesslike form the terms of Roberts’ engagement. This was the first of many such outward letters to be copied into an enormous new tome, far\n\nAyers_final2.indd 17\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n18\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nlarger than a family Bible. In Henry’s neat, unostentatious hand, Roberts’ pay was confirmed at £3 a week. A cart, pulled by two horses, was to convey him, his men and their immediate requirements to the Burra Creek and they would have to ride in turns as the cart would not carry them all. They should call en route at F.H. Dutton’s sheep station for tools. On reaching their destination, and if they were not ‘too jaded’, they should send the cart back for the stragglers. Any delay should be avoided in providing ore for trading; the SAMA knew it would be months before they could expect any return on their outlay, through sheer distance. Tarpaulins would prevent wasted time constructing anything as substantial as a hut. This focus on immediate attention to duty and apparent lack of concern for the well-­being of the workforce was to be an ongoing hallmark of the SAMA directors, relayed to the mine officers through their mouthpiece, Henry Ayers. Though he was only the messenger at that stage, the beginnings of a reputation as a hard man were being established. The transport question was also addressed, through two bullock-­drawn drays belonging to J.B. Hack. Henry instructed that tools and stores be taken up and the first few tons of ore brought back – and one of Roberts’ carthorses. Hack should also scout for stopping stations for regular runs. While at the mine he should not be idle as the drivers should take every opportunity to help draw wood to assist the miners in constructing, despite previous instructions, their ‘temporary’ huts. With mining and carting in hand, a third element needed addressing: smelting. The SAMA engaged German smelters Captain Augustus Ey and Georg Ludwig Dreyer and his son, who were on the spot. Confirming the novice Mining Association’s determination to be as independent of overseas smelting expertise as possible, Henry commissioned designs from architect-­ surveyor-­engineer Kingston, not only for cottages for the miners and their families, but also for a fully fledged ‘Smelting House’. This was not a great triumph. Kingston failed to adequately consult the engaged experts and his partially constructed smelter, its walls barely risen, had its two furnaces badly positioned, preventing free access to their interiors. The name of the mining hamlet of original cottages was to have been Redruth, no doubt aimed at giving the Cornish miners some sense of Home, but it was soon renamed Cooringa, or Kooringa, an Aboriginal name meaning ‘place of she-­oaks’. Kingston’s miners’ cottages constituted a small-­scale example, in a pioneer colonial context, of the forward-­thinking attitude of some contemporary British industrialists who thought it responsible to provide model housing for their workforce. However, hundreds would turn down ­21-­year leases of these attractive cottages, voting with their feet – and a pick and shovel – to dig their own dwellings into the banks of the Burra Burra Creek.\n\nAyers_final2.indd 18\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nThe Secretary\n\n19\n\nThe workers knew only too well that the mine could prove a dud any day, as indeed would be the fate of the Princess Royal Mine. The creek dwellings soon housed a population of some one and a half thousand. Inevitably, the creek became polluted from mining run-­off and the general detritus of human activity, including slurry from pig-­keeping. Squalid ‘Creek Street’ was far from the ideal place for families to live, and the SAMA could not understand why so many continued to shun the available housing. The directors also deplored the lack of rents. The attack on the exposed lode began on 29 September 1845, though the availability of experienced miners was somewhat problematic, with ‘poaching’ between mines occurring. Thomas Roberts was replaced as Mine Captain by Ferdinand von Sommer, again with a Henry Ayers ‘special’ by way of a letter of instruction. Von Sommer’s letters to Ayers reveal a good grasp of English, tinged with occasional Germanisms, such as a delicious coinage when, asked to send a poor specimen of a grey horse back to Adelaide, he says he will send it ‘townwards’. He implemented the ‘tutwork’ system, or sinking of shafts by miners paid at so much per fathom – vital work, but not immediately productive like ‘tributework’, the raising of ore on commission. Von Sommer’s spelling ‘Totwork’ is a nice German–English hybrid, signifying ‘deadwork’. From von Sommer, we learn further that Kingston had constructed the smelting house furnaces out of non-­heat-­resistant soft clay, and with no protection for the bellows. Worse still, no access was allowed for the bellows to connect with the furnaces. In the middle of 1846 Henry’s salary was raised to £200 per annum, having risen steadily from his temporary starting salary of £50. The SAMA directors now required him to attend exclusively to SAMA matters. Presumably, he had previously continued some work for Smart and Bayne, where the SAMA leased a room for £10 a year. More formalized office arrangements came with tighter SAMA board procedures, making a Secretary’s task easier: discussion was to be of the business only, and there was to be no smoking either. Henry and his family must again have counted themselves fortunate. Having worked for several Adelaide employers, it was pure luck that Henry found himself with a sufficient level of expertise and experience in the firm of Smart and Bayne when it was chosen as the SAMA’s solicitors, providing him with his opening into the thriving new concern.\n\nTeething Troubles February 1846 brought both success and near failure. Ore was being raised, but the miners’ mates were threatening to leave on account of low pay. That valuable auxiliary, the cook, was also just persuaded from leaving; whether\n\nAyers_final2.indd 19\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n20\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nhis intended departure was from dissatisfaction with his rewards or a lack of appreciation of his culinary skills is not clear. At any rate, von Sommer managed to convince his workers to continue, if only until the visit to the mine of the directors. Tours of inspection to Burra, as the mine and surrounding settlements became commonly known, were a regular feature and Henry was frequently required to be in attendance. His first official trip came in the October of 1845. Numbers of directors, and Kingston, were going up to see the results of the mine’s opening. Henry greatly enjoyed these opportunities to get out of the office and they seem to have been undertaken in a merry spirit by the carriageful of directors. When they travelled, the owner of the livery stable, Jamie Chambers, took the reins himself. Comfort was generally absent in these early days, and the journey could be quite hazardous. On one occasion, the party had to cross the swollen River Para in an ox-­skin punt. Another carriageful of people, attempting a crossing of the Light a few years later, was swept away; all five aboard, including a doctor bound for Burra, lost their lives. Apart from the hazards of travel over unmade roads and occasionally swollen creeks, accommodation could be problematic. Initially, the visitors relied on the enforced hospitality of their mine officers, which encouraged an undesirable over-­familiarity between master and servant. When writing Home to the mine’s largest shareholder, J.B. Graham, Henry expressed his relief at the improvement once the Burra Hotel was opened, late in 1847; he appreciated both the comfort and the independence from the mine’s staff. Before the end of January 1846, the board decided that they needed more direct control of mine operations, with von Sommer too costly to retain. They installed Samuel Stocks Jnr. as their Resident Director. His salary of £400 plus house, water and candles was still not to be sneezed at. The directors’ largesse did not extend to the workers, though; the men had been given nothing for their first Christmas Day holiday, nor for their afternoon off on Christmas Eve. Some years later, the secretary of another mining company asked Henry whether the SAMA paid for a Whit Monday holiday. Not much was accomplished on that day, Henry admitted, but added that the Association had only ever paid men for work done, and never paid holidays. Samuel Stocks, too, carried a letter of instruction in Henry’s hand on taking up his post in February. A general merchant and prominent committee-­man of the young Mining Association, Stocks nevertheless had little knowledge of mining, and had to rely on the experienced mine captains. He got no more than had his predecessor out of the Dreyers’ smelting experiments, and they had their own problems with their bellows mechanism – provided by an Adelaide pipe-­organ builder. On occasion, father and son preferred the comforts of town\n\nAyers_final2.indd 20\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nThe Secretary\n\n21\n\nto standing before a glowing furnace, thus breaching their contract. It became clear that a reliance on Swansea, Liverpool or London smelters could hardly be avoided. Henry’s duties therefore broadened to include correspondence negotiating terms for shipping and insuring the richer ores. The board’s unhappiness with Stocks’ performance quickly showed. Replacement Captain Henry Chipman came more cheaply, at £225, and Henry’s own salary nosed ahead in mid-­1847, at a straight £250. Little extras included the odd five-­guinea fee for attending an audit. Chipman, too, struggled and Ayers eventually had to write a letter of dismissal, referring to his drunken unpleasantness during one of the directors’ inspections. Despite the personnel problems, progress was such that the second AGM, in April 1847, was a ‘harmonious’, if not ‘jocular’ affair, according to the Register: ‘the volumes of smoke from the cigars above stairs being responded to by the jingling of brandy and water glasses below and many a smart joke was exchanged between the teetotallers and those who are only temperance men’. It is safe to include Henry Ayers among the latter, although it is extremely doubtful that he was among the smoking fraternity. Incidentally, within a month of that occasion, the paper published a long list of unpleasant symptoms a Dr Laycock had discerned in heavy smokers. Henry was an inveterate collector of newspaper articles on such health matters, yet he does not appear anything of a hypochondriac; in fact, on occasion, he could be quite careless with his health. When news arrived in the colony – taking only a record 57 days from London, via Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Mauritius – that the £5 Burra shares had risen as far as £80 each, it came with a sour-­grapes comment that that might still be a little too low for the ‘spoiled children of fortune of South Australia’. Better news still for SAMA shareholders was published in the Register in July; £5 Burra shares stood at a value of £100, although some might have wished they had shares in the Princess Royal, which had risen to £259!\n\nBurr at the Burra The directors finally felt they had found the right man to run their on-­site establishment, just before the second anniversary of the mine’s opening. Thomas Burr was well respected as the colony’s Deputy Surveyor-­General. The fact that his father was Professor of Mineralogy at Sandhurst College had to be a plus, too. Burr’s letter of engagement as mine Superintendent laid down, as usual, his wide-­ranging duties, for which he was to receive a very handsome sum of £700 per annum, along with a house, fuel and water. Salaries were on the rise all round and Henry’s was raised to £350 – a sizeable improvement.\n\nAyers_final2.indd 21\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n22\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nBurr was not quite the catch the directors had anticipated. Henry believed that, coming from the public service, Burr was not well suited to the demands of a private enterprise. Burr’s shortcoming, though, proved to be his certifications of the percentage of copper in the ores sent to Port Adelaide. Independent assayers found these seriously ‘optimistic’. This embarrassed the SAMA, and Henry as Secretary, when those ores were assayed on reaching London or Swansea and found to be wanting. Furthermore, Burr’s reputedly wild personal life unsettled his workforce. It was alleged that he and his wife hit the bottle very hard. If this were not enough, Burr had an eye for the workmen’s wives as well. Neither were their daughters considered safe, even in daylight, as John Adams reported he had heard it from Henry. Adams was stepfather to John Benjamin Graham, the Burra’s largest shareholder who had returned to Britain early in 1848. Adams further reported to Graham, though, that the SAMA directors were not entirely as one on the latter vice; Captain William Allen was inclined to feel that the Superintendent should be allowed to ‘get his greens where he [could]’. As an ex-­captain with the East India Company’s fleet, perhaps this director’s sentiment was not too surprising, but it was ironic, really, that Allen was simultaneously helping to found the Collegiate School of St Peter, which was about to open its doors to the boys of ‘respectable parents’, as it was advertised. Henry’s sons would be educated there. A hand-­drawn cartoon in one of Henry’s scrapbooks graphically depicts a lubricious Burr, caricatured as a strawberry plant. Its leaves represent arms, the face is reminiscent of the classic image of Mephistopheles, and a shoot stemming from his lower parts has a large strawberry at its end. The caption reads: ‘the large strawberry as grown at the Burra and cut by the Superintendent’. Maybe Burr had exceptional horticultural skills. Such a fruit would have been unusual, as Burra was an acknowledged desert in terms of private gardens. Dangling from the arm-­like right leaf is a pair of scales. This appears an allusion to Burr’s responsibilities in ore evaluation. They were turned into a weapon against him, however, by the cartoonist who balanced ‘gentleman’ in one pan against ‘Dangerous, Inebriant, Proud, High, Life’, on top of each other in the other pan. The significance of ‘Life’ is a matter of conjecture; undoubtedly, High and Life were meant to go together, an allusion to Burr’s racy goings on. One imagines that this cartoon was circulated only among the gentlemen of the board and was certainly not for any lady’s eyes. A rather more decorous cartoon is a nice satirical depiction of the Burra area; it is either a play on this inland district’s summer dryness, or it uses hyperbole regarding a wet season, which the southern spring of 1848 was. It portrays a fjord-­like vista down a gorge between the Burra hills with a couple of three-­masted barques at anchor in the distance! Satire on Burr seems the\n\nAyers_final2.indd 22\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nThe Secretary\n\n23\n\nmore prevalent mood, though, with another sketch, of an anthropomorphic wild animal of sorts, carrying the legend ‘A live Boar as seen superintending Burra Burra Mines’.\n\nToasting Success By the middle of 1848, disillusionment with Burr coincided with the Year of Revolutions on the European continent. The initial outbreak, in France, caused chaos in trade and industry in Britain. The plight of British workers on French rail projects, thrown out of work and their savings appropriated by the revolutionary government, was relayed to one of Henry’s friends by a relative in Wales. The demand for copper fell, not surprisingly when it is considered that, for example, each railway engine contained about 10 tons of it. News of the fall in the value of copper ore, the world price of which was set in Swansea – ‘Copperopolis’ – reached Adelaide by the April. Up to this point, all had been going swimmingly for the Burra shareholders. The price of their £5 shares had risen astronomically, to a peak of over £200, with juicy dividends to match. J.B. Graham, as largest shareholder, was deriving an annual income of at least £16,000 from his investment in 400 shares. Stepfather Adams teased him with the promise of a large increase in his earnings the following year. In the current year, he expected Graham would gain only £20,000. As the revolutionary outbreaks spread through mainland Europe the share values fell and the directors looked to cost cutting. The men would have to take lower wages and Mr Superintendent Burr, on his fat £700 salary, locked in for three years, would have to go. The over-­optimistic assays were the pretext, and one wonders whether accusations of drunkenness and philandering were exaggerated as a fallback for the directors. Dr von Sommer had had his lawyer out-­face similar accusations – nothing to do with the SAMA – against himself in the press the previous year. Acting for him, R.D. Hanson made it clear that, while his client had been found guilty of drunkenness, he had been acquitted of wishing to ‘deflower an innkeeper’s daughter and servant’. In Burr’s case, though, Ayers had warned the Superintendent in the August that, when the directors visited, he would want a word with him about matters other than those covered in the official correspondence. It is ironic that the Illustrated London News later in the year credited none other than Superintendent Burr as being the one who had cleared ‘bad characters’ out of the Burra mining community. Luckily for the SAMA, the right man to hold the fort was already in its employ. Another Cornish migrant, Captain Henry Roach served as Chief Captain under Burr with distinction enough for the board to advance him to\n\nAyers_final2.indd 23\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n24\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nthe overall on-­site management of the mining operations. Ayers’ contemporaries would not have recognized the term ‘downsizing’ but they would certainly have recognized the concept. Roach could be relied on to continue his activities as Chief Captain and take on the duties of Superintendent, if without the title, on his modest £300 salary. Nothing could have pleased the board more, except perhaps a sudden steep rise in the value of their ore again, than to have the combined management roles at a fraction of the former cost. To cement Roach’s position in the organization, he was given both a private party and a dinner, attended by the Ayers. The party was held at Prospect House, the luxury residence of J.B. Graham. In Graham’s absence, his stepfather, John Adams, had the run of the grand house. Adams recounted the evening’s activities in the journal he kept as a basis for his letters to J.B. Graham. The party had a homely, in-­house feel, with even Henry Ayers’ city-­ office staff, MacDonald and Brodie, whom he considered ‘all good and true’, invited. At table, Mrs Adams, Graham’s mother, took the Chair, with Henry Roach on her right and Henry ‘Ayres’, as Adams often spelled it, on her left. The spelling of his surname was obviously a touchy point with Henry; even the newspaper notice of his appointment as Secretary had got it wrong. Henry set his mine officers straight: ‘“Ayers” is the correct way.’ It is curious, though, that on one occasion, in the index of one of his scrapbooks, he slipped, spelling his own name in the Ayres manner. At the party, there was singing, dancing and little acted scenes, with Adams confessing that he had never enjoyed such performances more since he ‘became a playgoer’. They were in a ‘continual roar of laughter the whole of the evening’, all agreeing that it was the most enjoyable night of their lives – ‘Ayers was never more at home as well as Capt. Roach and all parties’. The Adams looked on benignly as the younger element caroused but were not found wanting during the singing; Adams performed his ‘Bluebells’ and his wife sang her ‘Violets’. Although Adams does not report it on that occasion, Henry may have sung ‘Have you not heard of the Monster Mine?’ As Ian Auhl (1986) tells us, this was Ayers’ favourite party-­piece. Henry pasted two copies of the text in his own handwriting into a scrapbook: Have you not heard of the Monster Mine? There’s devil a man to be got to dine, There’s devil a clerk who will pen a line, At my behest or thine. They are all gone forth to the homeless North\n\nTo gaze on the Monster Mine. [ J.W. Macdonald, Acting Colonial Treasurer – later Stipendiary Magistrate in Kooringa]\n\nAyers_final2.indd 24\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nThe Secretary\n\n25\n\nMost of the revellers drifted off by 1 a.m. and, with the house quiet, Adams, Roach and Ayers kept the fire warm, talking of the mine into the small hours. It is interesting that it was Adams, who saw himself as proxy for his shareholder stepson, together with Roach, the new overall mine captain, and Ayers, the Secretary, who chewed over the mine’s future development, while the directors were unrepresented; it is perhaps an indication of a more managerial role, which Henry was steadily assuming. The Ayers were staying the night anyway, and in the morning, following a hearty breakfast, they were carried back to town in the Adams’ carriage. What sort of a night they had passed, though, is questionable as a ferocious storm had blown up. Notwithstanding Adams’ best efforts, a blind from the main house and part of the verandah of a cottage in the grounds were carried away. In the aftermath, Adams fell down on his Christian duty the following morning. Despite a personal invitation from the newly enthroned Bishop, he was too unwell to attend the consecration of Walkerville Church, to the city’s north-­east. Adams assuaged his conscience with a five-­guinea donation. Roach’s more public ‘do’, a couple of nights later, was a dinner given by the directors at the Freemasons’ Tavern in Pirie Street. Adams was not there, but noted that Director John Waterhouse was missing, still feeling the effects of yet another party they had all attended, the week before, at Prospect House, on ‘declaring Dividend Day’, as Adams called it. That, too, had been a wild night, in Adelaide terms, with local musician Bennett providing entertainment. The party-­goers arrived merrily shouting ‘sharp 6’ as Adams had written upon the invitations. When Henry Ayers’ health was being drunk ‘with all the usual encomiums’, Adams brought the excited crowd to a sudden silence; he said he could not let the moment pass without bringing a serious charge against the Secretary. He played it straight, with all desperate to know what dire accusation might follow and, despite the chill of a winter’s evening, Henry must have broken out in a sweat. The ‘crime’ turned out to be that Adams had called at the Ayers’ house, one Sunday, and found Henry surrounded with business papers and books instead of observing a day of rest. It cannot be said to be much of a joke, retold for today’s reader. In a fairly devout colony, though, with Adams the committed churchman, it made its point and the company was uproariously amused – at least, Adams told his stepson that they were – and ‘all ended extremely well’. Some overdid the drinking and John Waterhouse, particularly, put the fear of God in the others by saying he would ‘knock every man down in the room’. He was packed off home in Jamie Chambers’ trap, under the eye of Charles Beck. The Chairman, however, insisted on riding outside, afraid of what Waterhouse might otherwise do to him. As Adams informed Graham, Waterhouse, by his\n\nAyers_final2.indd 25\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n26\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nown admission, had ‘never come to himself since he came to our party’ – and he, a good Methodist! The Adams went to town, taking overnight guests, the Ayers, with them. Before the Mesdames Ayers and Adams went for a spot of shopping in Hindley Street, a ‘snack of sausages’ was enjoyed by them all at the Ayers’ house. On other occasions, after attending a function in town, the Adams had their hospitality returned. After February 1849, the Ayers could conveniently put Mr and Mrs Adams up in their ‘New Bedroom’. Three years of the Burra Mine had seen it become the most prominent enterprise in the South Australian economy. It immediately supported a thriving mining town of almost 5,000 people and served as a strong catalyst for advancing the colony in which the Ayers had cast their lot. Henry was establishing himself more and more at the centre of the SAMA’s activities, and of its social world, embraced by the likes of its suddenly wealthy directors and shareholders. The importance of the wealthiest – J.B. Graham – to him, and of Henry to Graham, was about to grow, shaping both their lives.\n\nAyers_final2.indd 26\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n3\n\nKk FRIENDS WHEN AND WHERE YOU NEED THEM\n\nJohn Benjamin Graham’s blood must have run cold, thinking about his dividends, when a whisper reached him in London of rumpus at the mine, added to the problems with Burr and falling ore and share prices with Europe in ferment. Reassured that it was just a rumour, he must have drawn a huge sigh of relief because the previous few months had seen considerable expenditure. His visit to Britain had several purposes. He could visit the SAMA’s various agents and associates, and repay debts of honour that he felt on account of his late father’s bankruptcy. His third errand was more personal. As a 35-­year-­old bachelor, and recognized by The Times editor no less as the ‘lucky emigrant’, Graham was seeking a wife. There may also have been an unspoken, fourth reason for the trip, resulting from a strange anonymous letter he had received later in 1847. Signed ‘Eureka’, the letter ardently urges secrecy, citing Graham’s recent initiation into the brotherhood of Freemasonry, Graham’s ‘Passport to every grade of society throughout the privileged world’. The writer urges Graham not to sell out prematurely, his share values rocketing even as Eureka writes. He is also urged to hurry to Europe to broaden his mind, and return fully rounded, ready to endow charitable institutions, which will perpetuate his name. Whether or not prompted by this letter, while visiting the Swansea smelting sphere in August 1848, Graham dined with the ‘leading philosifer of England’ – probably Michael Faraday – at the convention of the British Society for the\n\n27\n\nAyers_final2.indd 27\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n28\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nAdvancement of Science. He also visited ‘Mr. Nevel’, the proprietor of a sizeable copper smelter at Llanelli. Nevill’s nearby competitor, the ‘Spitty’ works, was in process of seeking direct access to the Burra’s ores, bypassing purchase by auction at the Swansea ‘ticketings’. Graham confided to his journal that one of Nevill’s daughters had no liking for music, ‘so she would not suit me’. Another unsuccessful South Wales candidate for Graham’s affections was Jane Coke, sister of South Australian immigrant James Charles Coke. Jane told her Adelaide brother that the family was ‘agreeably disappointed’ with the Burra magnate. Amused by Graham’s conceit about his singing voice, she admitted they had to make allowances for his lack of education – perhaps as obvious to the Cokes as to ‘Eureka’. The magnate was more than generous, though, in presenting his new friends – or possibly their church – with a powerful organ, costing £1,000. Jane conceded that her lack of real keyboard proficiency had made a closer relationship with the wealthy visitor impossible – ‘we were good friends and as such we parted’, she joked. Besides, for heirs to his brand new fortune, Graham would need to look to someone younger than a Jane Coke already into her forties. Back in London, Graham soon found a girl meeting his requirements. He took Louisa Rymill to choose a piano for his new house in Brompton, Vere Lodge. Costing £165, it did have a ‘most splendid tone’. The Lodge’s 15 rooms they decorated lavishly, including with artworks bought at Stowe House, home of the Dukes of Buckingham. He also spent an agreeable evening with the celebrated artist Landseer, of ‘Monarch of the Glen’ fame, and probably purchased a work from him. Add to the list a diamond ring for Louisa, and a coach for £1,200, second-­hand after the Duke of Buckingham, and expenditure was mounting. When news of the Duke’s vehicle reached Prospect House, Adams salivated over the ‘commotion’ it would cause when Graham brought it back to Adelaide. There was the rub – would he return? Louisa would not leave her family. Graham reported her ‘all in a fidget’ about living in South Australia, as well she might have been; the whole romance had been a whirlwind. Graham would therefore have to settle down in married bliss on that side of the world, the wedding taking place in March 1849.\n\nTrouble at the Mine By February 1849, the bombshell of Graham’s non-­return struck his Adelaide circle and Henry Ayers therefore penned a newsy letter. The rumour of trouble at the mine was true after all, and was nothing less than an all-­out strike. He told Graham that the workers on ‘tribute’, the men who contracted in ‘pares’\n\nAyers_final2.indd 28\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\nFriends when and where you need them\n\n29\n\nor ‘pairs’ to work a certain lode for a percentage of the value of the ore they raised, had refused to bargain for ‘pitches’ at the October 1848 lettings. It was in retaliation against the SAMA after the directors declined to settle their grievances over their losses through Burr’s incompetent assays. The rewards on offer from the cost-­cutting, and punitive, board were simply below what they could stomach. The board’s September carriage jaunt to Burra had begun as usual, with Ayers and the deputation of directors setting out light-­heartedly. Adams and Graham’s mother had saluted the carriage, she with a ‘White Flag’ – doubtless her handkerchief – from a window, and he waving his hat from the garden as they passed along the wall around Prospect House. Jocularly, the travellers rose in their seats to return the salutations and the visitation began in the confident, easy-­going spirit with which the week had begun, when the new Governor and his wife had honoured the SAMA office with an official visit. From his physiognomy, Adams concluded that Governor Young would not be short of something ‘in his noddle’. Lady Young had her accomplishments, too. A fine horsewoman, with the agility of her mere 20 years, she saved herself from a nasty fall by turning a ‘Somerset’ – and that while in the early stages of pregnancy. The couple’s greatest achievement, though, was to go about the town ‘from shop to shop as if they were nobody’, making themselves ‘very familiar’. From the point of view of mining shareholders, Governor Young had an extra appeal, in removing the royalty charged on ore exports, a policy of his predecessor that had generated the colony’s first rumblings of ‘independence’ sentiments from the Mother Country, and these in a colony barely out of its first decade. The new gubernatorial couple were received in the SAMA’s office by Secretary Ayers and two directors. This was not the £10-­a-year, one-­room affair at Smart and Bayne’s. Henry now operated from an administrative centre prominently positioned on the corner of King William and Rundle Streets, at the heart of commercial Adelaide. With Governor and Lady Young visiting, John Adams obviously could not keep his nose out and, on his way home, he happened upon Captain Roach at the ford over the Torrens, on his way back to Burra. Everything in the SAMA garden must have seemed lovely, its premises hallowed by an official visit, its new Captain-­in-­charge returning to take up control, and now a ‘holiday’ to follow for Ayers and the directors in their hotel, in their mining town. It turned out no holiday. The men were striking and ‘taking possession of the mine’, with Henry and the visiting directors besieged in the Burra Hotel. The editor of the Register joked that they were protected from the vehemence of their predominantly Cornish workforce due to the name of its landlord,\n\nAyers_final2.indd 29\n\n3/11/10 3:28 PM\n\n30\n\nHENRY AYERS\n\nWren. As the old Cornish proverb went: ‘Neither strike robin nor wren, be you boy, maid, or man.’ In town, meanwhile, the Secretary’s ‘good"
