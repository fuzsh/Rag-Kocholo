        "text": "The Rabbitohs have announced the first new signing of the Wayne Bennett era, with Scotland international Euan Aitken signing until the end of the 2027 season.\n\nAitken, 29, will move with Bennett from the Dolphins at the end of the season and is expected to play in the second-row after beginning his career as a centre at the Dragons in 2015.\n\nAitken, 29, has scored 55 tries in 192 NRL games and represented Scotland on five occasions, while also playing one match for Country Origin in 2016 and representing the Australian Prime Minister’s XIII in 2015.\n\nInjured Cowboys utility Jake Granville has played his last match for the club he is a life member of after announcing he will depart North Queensland at the end of the 2024 season.\n\nGranville, who has appeared in 207 games for the club after arriving in North Queensland in 2015, has indicated a desire to play overseas.\n\nHe will miss the remainder of the 2024 season with a pec injury, meaning the club legend has donned Cowboys colours for the final time.\n\nThe 35-year-old played a pivotal role in the club’s historic maiden premiership in 2015, throwing the final pass for two of the Cowboys’ three tries in the 17-16 grand final triumph over the Broncos.\n\nGranville became the 12th Cowboys life member, and just the ninth player to appear in 200 games for the Cowboys in Round 5 against the Titans earlier this season.\n\nTongan prop Tevita Pangai Junior is the latest NRL signing for French Super League club Catalans Dragons.\n\nPangai, who was off contract at the Dolphins, has signed a one year deal with Catalans and will join Sydney Roosters five-eighth Luke Keary and Melbourne Storm centre Reimis Smith at the club next year.\n\nFormer Dolphins team-mate Jarrod Wallace has already made the move to Perpignan in recent weeks.\n\nSince his NRL debut for Brisbane in 2016, Pangai has 20 tries in 143 NRL appearances.\n\nHe played for Tonga at the 2017 World Cup and represented NSW in 2023.\n\nCatalans coach Steve McNamara said: \"After many conversations with Tevita, it seemed obvious that he would be an excellent signing for the club. He wants to give the best of himself in the Super League. His power, technical and athletic qualities will sow chaos in the opposing defences. We are looking forward to his arrival.\"\n\nBroncos utility back Tristan Sailor has signed a two-year deal with English Super League club St Helens for the 2025-2026 seasons.\n\n\"To be able to play in an elite competition at a good team, St Helens are a really historic club, and see that part of the world is something I wanted to look into,\" Sailor said.\n\n\"I am grateful for the Broncos giving me that opportunity and releasing me with a year left on my contract.\"\n\nSt Helens coach Paul Wellens shared his thoughts on welcoming Sailor to the club, saying he would help improve their team.\n\n“The fact he can play at fullback or at six, similar to Jack [Welsby] gives us options, but we don’t need to make decisions too soon on where he plays. What we do know, and what we are confident in, is he will add a lot to our team,\" Wellens said.\n\nThe Warriors have announced the re-signing three players, with New South Wales Cup captain Kalani Going, promising front rower Tanner Stowers-Smith and exciting outside back Motu Pasikala recommitting.\n\nGoing and Stowers-Smith have been secured on development contracts for 2025 while Pasikala has signed a three-year deal to the end of the 2027 season.\n\nEarlier, Warriors halfback Shaun Johnson has called time on his 14-season NRL career, announcing he’ll retire at the end of the season.\n\nJohnson, who’ll turn 34 next month, informed his teammates of his decision before confirming it publicly.\n\n“There’s an entire generation of kids in this country who picked up a rugby league ball because of Shaun Johnson,” One New Zealand Warriors CEO Cameron George said.\n\n“His impact on not only this club but also rugby league is New Zealand is something that will be remembered here forever.\"\n\nManly Warringah Sea Eagles have further extended the contract of prop Taniela Paseka until the end of 2029.\n\nOff contract at the Sea Eagles at the end of 2026, the new three-year-deal will give the 26-year-old front-rower an opportunity to finish his career as a one-club player.\n\n“He is still in his mid-20s, so his best footy is going to continue to develop over the next four of five seasons, which is the reason why we have signed him long term,\" Sea Eagles coach Anthony Seibold said.\n\nHis extension comes after the recent re-signing of fellow prop Josh Aloiai who signed a two-year contract extension that will see him remain with the club until at least the end of the 2027 season.\n\nAloiai, 28, has played 150 NRL games, 60 of those for Manly, while also representing Samoa at international level.\n\nElsewhere, Melbourne Storm has landed the signature of representative prop Stefano Utoikamanu on a three-year contract until the end of the 2027 season.\n\nUtoikamanu, who advised Wests Tigers officials earlier this week that he was leaving, last year made his Origin debut for New South Wales and represented Samoa in the Pacific Championships.\n\nA Parramatta junior, he has played the last four seasons at Wests Tigers, but exercised a get out clause in his contract and the Storm were among the clubs interested in his services.\n\n“Stefano is an exciting young forward and also an impressive young man,” Storm GM of football Frank Ponissi said.\n\n“I’m sure he’s going to come with a working hard attitude and be ready for a big pre-season when he joins us later this year. We are excited to welcome Stefano and his family to the club.\"\n\nParramatta's effort to retain exciting youngster Blaize Talagi has fallen short with the outside back to depart the club.\n\nRetaining the 19-year-old emerged as a priority for incoming coach Jason Ryles after Talagi declined an option in his favour to explore opportunities elsewhere.\n\nA number of rivals have circled the fullback and the Eels confirmed in a statement he has informed the club of his decision to leave at the end of the season.\n\n“The club made a very strong offer to Blaize, provided a clear path for his football future and consistently made it clear to Blaize and his family that we wanted him to be part of the club long term,\" CEO Jim Sarantinos said in the statement.\n\n“While we are disappointed, particularly given the opportunities provided to Blaize during his time at the club, we wish him all the best.”\n\nMeanwhile, long-serving forward Jazz Tevaga will leave the Warriors at the end of the season.\n\nThe off-contract forward will part ways with the club after a career which has seen the Tevaga represent the Warriors for nine seasons in the NRL.\n\n“We’re grateful for all Jazz has done for the Warriors. We have appreciated his efforts during his time with us and wish him and his family all the best for the future,” said Warriors general manager recruitment, pathways and development Andrew McFadden.\n\nThe Storm have released Kiwis international Reimis Smith to take up an opportunity in the Super League with Catalans. Smith will make the move effective immediately.\n\nSmith joined the Storm from the Canterbury Bulldogs in late 2020 and was in his fourth season at Melbourne, having played 69 games for the club including 4 finals which included 2 Preliminary Finals in 2021 and 2023.\n\nThe departures comes as the Roosters announced veteran Daniel Tupou will remain a one-club player after signing a two-year contract extension.\n\nThe deal will keep the 33-year-old at the club until the end of the 2026 season.\n\nThe Roosters' all-time leading try-scorer and their sixth-most capped player, Tupou said it's an honour to continue his career with the Tricolours.\n\n“I'm incredibly grateful to be able to continue my journey with the Sydney Roosters,\" Tupou said. \"This is my home, and I'm honoured to have the opportunity to keep representing in the jersey that means so much to me.\"\n\nEngland international John Bateman has been released by Wests Tigers to join English Super League club Warrington Wolves for the remainder of the 2024 season.\n\nBateman remains contracted to Wests Tigers for the 2025 and 2026 seasons.\n\nWests Tigers CEO Shane Richardson commented: “John leaving Wests Tigers for the back end of the season is something that all parties are comfortable with.”\n\nCook Islands international Kayal Iro has signed a two-year contract extension with the Sharks, keeping the centre at the club until at least the end of 2026.\n\nAfter biding his time over the past few seasons, Iro has been a revelation in 2024, having played every game since breaking into the team in Round 4.\n\nSharks coach Craig Fitzgibbon is eager to see Iro progress as he gains more experience.\n\n\"We've always rated Kayal extremely highly,\" Fitzgibbon said.\n\n\"He worked hard while waiting for his opportunity and has taken it with both hands this year.\n\n\"Kayal is still just 15 games into his NRL career and will only get better in the seasons ahead.\"\n\nDolphins fullback Trai Fuller has agreed to a two-year deal that elevates him to the club's Top 30 full-time squad and will cover the 2025 and 2026 seasons.\n\nFuller has made a big impression on his 10 games at NRL level, scoring five tries and filling in admirably at the back for Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow,\n\n\"Trai has done everything right to get himself into this position,\" said Dolphins CEO Terry Reader.\n\n“Last year he had limited opportunity in the NRL but demonstrated his talent and development by being named Player of the Year in the Queensland Cup competition.\n\n“This season he has showed he belongs in the NRL and the new contract is the reward for that.\"\n\nFormer Queensland Origin prop Jarrod Wallace has joined French Super League club Catalans for the remainder of the season.\n\nWallace began his career at Brisbane Broncos, making his NRL debut in 2012. He then made the switch to the Titans ahead of the 2017 season, where he made 118 appearances, scoring 15 tries. He moved to the Dolphins in 2023.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who played 212 NRL games and 24 tries in his career, has also represented Queensland on six occasions.\n\nTongan strike forward Sitili Tupouniua is set to join the Bulldogs on a four-year deal after being granted a release by the Sydney Roosters at the end of the season.\n\nTupouniua, who made his NRL debut in 2018 after progressing through the club's pathways, has played 96 NRL games for the Roosters, scoring 28 tries.\n\nThe 27-year-old backrower has also played three Tests for Tonga.\n\nYoung Manly playmaker Jamie Humphreys will join the Rabbitohs in 2025 on a two-year deal.\n\nThe 22-year-old made his NRL debut for the Sea Eagles in Sunday's big win over the Knights, scoring the game's opening try in a 44-6 romp at 4 Pines Park.\n\nSydney Roosters five-eighth Luke Keary will join Raiders captain Elliott Whitehead at Catalans next season after deciding to play on in the Super League.\n\nKeary, who has won premierships with South Sydney and the Roosters, while representing NSW, Australia and Ireland, had announced his retirement earlier this year but will now continue playing in France.\n\nKeary represented his Irish heritage at the 2022 World Cup and will still be playing when the next World Cup is staged in the Southern Hemisphere in 2026.\n\nEngland second-rower Elliott Whitehead will also join Catalans next season after agreeing to return to Perpignan on a one-year deal after a decade in the NRL.\n\nWhitehead played for the Dragons from 2013 to 2015 before joining the Raiders in 2016 and has played 198 NRL matches, as well as 36 Tests, including the 2017 and 2022 World Cups.\n\nHis departure coincides with the arrival of fellow English forward Matty Nicholson, who will join the Raiders on a new three-year deal from the beginning of the 2025 season.\n\nNicholson made his Super League debut for Wigan in 2022, before joining Warrington in 2023, where he has gone on to cement himself in the starting line-up under the coaching of Sam Burgess.\n\nThe 20-year-old made his Test debut for England in 2023 alongside current Raiders forward Morgan Smithies against France.\n\nHe recently played in Warrington's narrow loss to Wigan in the 2024 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nTitans skipper Kieran Foran has signed a one-year extension to remain at the club until the end of the 2025 season.\n\nNext year will mark the New Zealand international's 17th season in the NRL after debuting in 2009.\n\nThe news comes after the Gold Coast's rugby union convert Carter Gordon was granted an early release to begin training with the club. The 23-year-old will be part of Gold Coast's extended squad this season before joining the club's top 30 roster in 2025.\n\nOfficial 2024 NRL squad lists\n\nSee the official signings tracker hub\n\nUpdated NRL Telstra Premiership rosters for the 2024 season are below.
