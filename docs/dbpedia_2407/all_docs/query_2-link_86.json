        "text": "Uncommon history with an unconventional pair. Join married hosts Rebecca Robbins (a Broadway actress) and Kim Kimmel (her college history instructor) as they delve into topics that run the historical gambit. A gifted storyteller, Kim taught history at the collegiate level for 29 years during a year of which Rebecca, as a student, sat in the front row of his Western Civilizations class soaking up every word he said. For the record, she made an A in his class. She went on to pursue a Broadway career (The Phantom of The Opera, A Tale of Two Cities) while he continued to teach at her alma mater (Curtis Institute of Music). Though you couldn't get more different than these two with their 23-year age difference, together they bring history to life with their unique perspectives, entertaining banter, and shared love of the past. Sometimes quirky, sometimes obscure, this is the kind of history youâ€™ll actually want to remember. Now in our Second Season. New episodes drop bi-weekly on Thursday mornings.\n\n8/24/22\n\nLegend has it that there once was a King named Arthur who allegedly lived in the late 5th and early 6th centuries and who, with his many companions, successfully fought off numerous enemies in Britain. But was there actually an historical Arthur of real flesh and blood? The Arthurian stories are arguably the greatest legends in Western history, and here in our 50th Episode we explore how the fabled Arthur compares with the historical one.\n\nThese episodes are the conversations you would have over the dinner table with a knowledgeable friend. And the history professor I wish I had had. She asks the questions you would, and he seems to know everything! I love the unscripted style and have learned so much! Bravo!\n\n-bobbacita\n\nWhile we make every effort to make sure our facts and stories are 100% accurate, occasionally history contradicts itself and there can be two completely different accounts of the exact same event. In the unlikely instance that you may hear us say something that contradicts what you have heard or read elsewhere, please don't panic, but remember the sage words of America's 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, \"Don't believe everything you read on the internet.\""
