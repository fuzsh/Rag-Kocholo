The Works Department seems to be in\n\n(want of reform-to wit, the railway bridge\n\nover the Log in which has been in proa ss\n\n(of rebuilding, on and off for nearly twelve\n\nmonths, and is not yet finished, to the great loss\n\nand annoyance of every settler in the district It\n\nwould be my duty to get arranged a different\n\nclassification of goods with a view of getting\n\ntimber farm and garden produce taken at a rate\n\nthat would make these industries remunerative\n\nThe attempts at dredging the rivers in these\n\ndistricts has been a farce in the past, and I would\n\nearnestly advocate the sending of sufficiently\n\n(powerful dredges to the Nerang, Coomera Albert\n\nand Logan rivers, and would make them speedily\n\nnavigable There are other matters which claim\n\nattention and which I will speak on when visiting\n\nShe different centres later on\n\nI can assure you, gentlemen, that if you honour\n\n\"me by placing me at the head of the poll I will\n\ngive my very best to advance the best interests of\n\nevery portion of our splendid electorate, from\n\nPoint Danger to Mount Lindsay)\n\nI remain gentlemen\n\nYours faithfully\n\nTHOMAS PLUNKETT\n\nTambourine, 9th February, 1888\n\nVALVES ION (Ti KIAN WAY WE\n\nBrisbane,\n\n10th February, 1888\n\nI, the undersigned, hereby motif) that NOMINATIONS\n\nof CANDIDATES for election as\n\nMEMBERS and AUDITORS for the division of\n\nKianawah will be received by me until 4 o'clock in\n\nthe afternoon of the 24th day of February,\n\n1888, being the day next preceding the day of\n\nnomination and that I will be in attendance at\n\nthe Post Office, at Tingalpa, on that date, for the\n\npurpose of receiving the nomination papers of\n\ncandidates for election, the forms for which can\n\nbe obtained from me on application\n\nEach nomination paper must be signed by not\n\nless than three persons duly qualified to vote in\n\nthe division, and every candidate or his agent,\n\nwhen duly ering his nomination paper, is required\n\nby law to deposit with the returning officer the\n\nsum of £5\n\nED KELK,\n\nReturning officer\n\nDreHsinuIem;\n\nRVF\n\nMO\n\nand Milliner v.\n\nWALKER\n\nFROM AIRS\n\nADELAIDE-STREET\n\nMRS WALKER is now offering the balance\n\ni her choice SUMMER DRESSES, made up, at\n\nprices intended to clear the remainder of the\n\nseason's goods\n\nFrench Cambric Dresses, made up .. £2\n\n~^~V<> \" \" I\n\nCanvas\n\nTennis Flannel\n\nBoucle Zephyr\n\njubilee Mushu\n\nChecked Zephyr\n\nFigured Mublru\n\nIndian Muslin\n\nStriped Zephyr\n\nPlain Zephyr\n\nsummer I « eed\n\nEsmerelda Cloths\n\nItesorviste Cloths\n\nVestings \"\n\nfigured do Lain\n\nVoile Dresses . ,,\n\nCashmere Dresses ....
