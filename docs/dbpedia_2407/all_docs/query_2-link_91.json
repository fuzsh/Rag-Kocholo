        "text": "So, Krakoa… Anyway, back in the States, the X-Mansion is being turned into a prison, and the Warden, one Corina Ellis, she’s nasty. Down in Mexico, three amigos are checking out the local wildlife. And in Oregon, a young woman runs for her life. Uncanny X-Men #1 (Legacy number, God Only Knows) is a wonderful […]\n\nRead More Uncanny X-Men #1 review\n\nResistance is futile! It’s a sci-fi cliche, but not one the heroes who have escaped Amanda Waller’s power-sapping Amazo androids believe. They’re gathered in Superman’s Fortress of Solitude and making plans to take the world back from ‘The Wall’. First order of business, choose a leader. As the veterans argue among themselves, a hero from […]\n\nRead More Absolute Power #2 review\n\nThe Justice Society were attacked in New York by one of Amanda Waller’s power absorbing androids. The Amazo absorbed Jesse Quick’s speed, and the energy and shadow powers of Jade and Obsidian, prompting the rest of the team to flee to Coast City in the hope of harnessing help from Green Lantern Hal Jordan. The […]\n\nRead More Absolute Power: Task Force VII #3 review\n\nIf you’re planning on ruling Earth in the DC Universe you can’t ignore Atlantis, kingdom of Aquaman, ruler of the Seven Seas. Amanda Waller, in her vendetta against the planet’s metahumans, has tasked one of her super power-stealing Amazos with getting the Atlanteans on side. He’s codenamed Depth Charge, and while he’s speaking words of […]\n\nRead More Absolute Power: Task Force VII #2 review\n\nWhat is Oliver Queen up to? He’s publicly allied himself with Suicide Squad chief turned dictator Amanda Waller, helping her oppress his fellow superheroes. He’s not out hunting heroes – the souped up Amazo androids are doing that – but he is passing on their secrets and cataloguing the weapons ‘The Wall’ has stolen from […]\n\nRead More Green Arrow #14 review\n\nSo, what do you reckon to the news from DC this week? The New 52 is long gone, DC Rebirth is so 2016, and as for all those mini line refreshes… well, did anyone ever have a handle on what exactly Dawn of DC was? So, coming up in October we have DC All In, […]\n\nRead More It’s DC revamp time! Again\n\nWe begin with a world in turmoil as the religiously oppressed populace tremble at the coming of the Phoenix. Their fear is understandable but misplaced. Across the galaxy, a prison breakout is in progress. As Nova and friends try to put a lid on things Jean Grey, having saved a world, talks to husband Scott […]\n\nRead More Phoenix #1 review\n\nThe Man of Steel is pretty much the Man of Flesh as this issue begins, his powers taken, his flesh pierced by bullets. Amanda Waller’s world coup has taken out most of the heroes, but while Superman is down, he isn’t out, with two of the best surgeons on the planet looking after him. Elsewhere, […]\n\nRead More Superman #16 review\n\nThe modified Amazo androids gifted Amanda Waller by the Brainiac Queen and Failsafe have captured the majority of Earth’s heroes. Among the good guys on the run are Billy Batson and Mary Bromfield, most of their Shazam powers having been drained. They’ve taken refuge at the Rock of Eternity, the extradimensional hideaway connected to their […]\n\nRead More Absolute Power: Task Force VII #1 review\n\nAfter a couple of months crossing over with Superman, the Superman Superstars experiment continues, with the latest featured creators being writer Gail Simone – back in Action after a wonderful, far too short run years ago – and artists Eddy Barrows and Danny Miki. The story is set in no fixed part of continuity – […]\n\nRead More Action Comic #1067 review"
