I first of all went to A.J.S. Bank and obtained from them £75 in sovereign to carry with me on the voyage. From thence to Water Police Court, sent Constable Flaherty with several boxes to the wharf and went with Milly and little Jack on board about XI. Found a great concourse of people (and friends) came to wish us good bye. Lady Manning and daughter, Mrs James Manning and Annie, Fanny and Wise, the Stephens, Captain Preston, C. Cowper, W.W. Stephen.\n\nThe solicitors headed by Levie M.P. had proposed to present me with a gold locket as a mark of their respect and it was arranged after some difficulty with Captain and Health Officers, that I should go down with them in the Police Launch “Nemesis” as faar as Bradley’s Head and that the Steamer should stop at that point and take me no board there. I therefore left the ship and went down the harbour as far as the point arranged. On board were the following solicitors:-\n\nW Roberts sen, H. Levien M.P., F. Gannan, Hill, Lowe, Wallace, Barry Hourigan, Brady and Inspectors Anderson, Walen, Donahue and Attwell, also Joseph of [Nousance?] Seymour and three of my colleagues, Addison, Abbott and Johnson, (Buchanan, Clarke and Yates not being able to get across from the Police Courts). Roberts as Senior Solicitor addressed me in very complimentary terms and then presented the locket in question. Inspector Anderson also expressed himself favourably on the part of the Police, and Inspector Seymour on the part of the Corporation of its Officers. I did not get on board the “Ganges” till 10 o’clock, when I found all the passengers were at lunch, Grace however, was on deck, watching the proceedings of the Nemesis, and she and I, after I got on board, remained waving our handkerchiefs till we got as far as the “Heads” and the launch was out of sight and we bid adieu to our many kind friends for awhile. This saying good bye is a terrible wrench to one’s feelings, as the poet Shakespeare says “in every parting there is an image of death.”\n\nSaturday 13th December 1884\n\nLovely weather. Our passengers consist of Mr, Mrs and Miss McConnell from Queensland, Mr, Miss and young Douglas, also from Queensland. Miss Millat, a pretty ladylike girl, who is going only to Adelaide to meet a lady friend and return again to Sydney.\n\nMiss Boodle, who came out as Governess to Mrs Drysdale, the pretty widow.\n\nMr McCutcheon, a young Civil Service Officer, (who has been staying at the Mitchells) on sick leave.\n\nMr Dubern, a clever Electrician, going to Colombo, there to await orders.\n\nMr Farquhar Scott, a young Bank Inspector en route to “Perth.”\n\nMr Grunow, a German Naturalist who has 6,000 specimens of seaweed, going to write a book.\n\nIn the evening had music and singing in the “Music Hall.” Miss McConnell, Miss Douglas and the Captain (Andrews) the performers. He has a good voice. And Miss McConnell plays well and has been well taught by some good master abroad, on the Continent.\n\nGrace and I occupy a 2 berth cabin midships, opposite the Engine. I had previously chosen a 3 berth one aft, but the fear of the vibration of the screw induced Grace, on the advice of Lady Manning, to change it. But the noise and thumping of the Engine, all night, disturbed y rest and I am [treating?] for a 4 berth cabin aft, which the Agents and Purser have promised me, in the event of no one taking it in Melbourne.\n\nSunday 14th December 1884\n\nVery cloudy drizzly weather. We arrived at Williamstown Pier about 4 o’clock in afternoon, and on the opposite side of Pier the Orient Steamer “Sorata” (just arrived from England) lay. We were inundated with sightseers from Melbourne who regularly rushed the decks, and saloon shortly after our arrival. The Stewards were busy looking after the cabins for fear of intrusion. Indeed this was very necessary for the crowd appeared certainly wanting in manners, and sat themselves down in the chairs in the cuddy as well as the passenger chairs on deck.\n\nThe Captain changed his seat at dinner today, and took the bottom of the table instead of his usual place in the middle opposite Grace and myself, and having on his left Miss Nuttal and Miss Boodle and on his right Miss Douglas. This change seemed to arise from his having 2 lady friends dining with him, and who came, I believe from Melbourne and as they were not introduced and kept aloof, I do not know their names or their “genus.” The Captain is a very attentive man, especially to young ladies, to whom he has commenced to give “afternoon teas” in his cabin, interspersed with (I hear) his views of the different kinds of “Love” in the World, the Parent’s, the wife’s, the child’s, the Lover’, &c &c, and he is a married man and supposed to be a safe specimen of humanity.\n\nMonday 15th December 1884\n\nGreat noise throughout the ship. The discipline hitherto (at sea) kept up, very much released whilst alongside the Pier. The morning broke with rain clouds and a bleak wind, and shortly after breakfast heavy showers fell. The Captain, as at dinner yesterday, located himself at the end of the Cuddy Table, instead of in the centre, and entertained two of his lady friends, (evidently from the shore). Douglas and McConnell started before and for the purpose of “foraging,” for some Inn to stay at for the next few days; Grace, Miss Millat and I started a little while after them but they missed the train, and we overtook them at the Station, and then we went altogether on to Melbourne, by train 9d each. We passed through a flat and uninteresting country. Many of the houses appeared built of wood, and only temporary structures. On reaching the station, we hired a one horse waggonette, and drove to a Miss Goulds, Parliament Place, where we took lodgings. Had lunch at 1, and then Grace, Miss Millat and I went sight-seeing, first to the R.C. Cathedral, St Patricks, where we saw several female devotees on their knees worshipping. We then strolled to the Picture Gallery, and saw the fine painting of “Esther” not long since purchased from London by this gallery. Miss Millat saw it in the Exhibition in London shortly before she came out. Another oil painting “A Question of Propriety,” representing a dancing girl, before the Priests and Officers of the Inquisition. There were a great many other nice pictures, but though the Gallery itself was much better than the Sydney buildings, yet I do not think the pictures themselves were either so numerous or so valuable. Not so the statuary. This was far superior to ours. A fresh purchase, a group of goats by a young artist (Summers) attracted our attention and a cast of Dr Johnson’s head which no doubt was a faithful likeness of the lexicography brought up the memories of the past. There were several large portraits, one of Lord Melbourne, Sir Henry Barclay, a former Governor, and a large one of that huge mountain of flesh, the late Sir John O’Shagnatty. As the rain had somewhat moderated we made a start “for home.” Miss Nuttal however preferred returning to the Ship “Ganges” having a sample about leaving a Miss Boodle (another passenger) alone by herself, and not being brought with her any of the paraphernalia of dress. I forgot to mention that at “Lunch at the Boarding House,” I found two Sydney people, one a Mr April Haviland who married a Miss [Budda? Kindsa?] who is a wonderful medium and wrote the poem “Dorothy” while in a trance, he too is a thorough believer in Spiritualism. The other person was my namesake, Digby Marsh, son of Colonel Marsh of the Royal Engineers, and cousin of Frederick Marsh of Wellington N.S.W. In the evening a still greater number of lodgers sat down to dinner, mostly young men, one the Doctor of the “Sorata.” Miss Gould, the Proprietoress has two adjoining houses which she rents. Posted letters from Grace for Fanny, Mrs M.H. Stephen, Marie, and George Pinnock and I sent one to Aunt Sophy and another to Fanny under cover of Wise. And in Melbourne I sent a registered letter to Milly with cheques inclosed for Mr Calvert, £6.11, a Newman Photograph £2.13.6.\n\nTuesday 16th December 1884\n\nHad breakfast at 8.15. Very cold and occasional showers of rain. Grace writing to Milbourne and others. About 2 we went in to Melbourne, and drove to the Post Office, where Campbell Yorke, (who has been staying in Victoria some weeks or so) agreed to meet us at 1. He took us to the Melbourne Coffee Palace for lunch. He informed Grace, that he had made arrangements for taking a curacy in Melbourne, subject to the consent of the Bishop of Brisbane, in whose Diocese (Rockhampton) he now is. His own health, (when he means, Cecil’s health being, or likely to [?] hot wind prejudiced by the Queensland climate. I purchased Holman’s Liver [pad?] for Yorke, as he said he had for the first time suffered so much from sea sickness, when coming from Sydney, and which I had escaped from (I think) wearing one. Strolled a little about the town, and then Grace and Yorke walked to the Fitzroy Gardens, whilst I remained to have my hair cut at a shop near the Church of England Cathedral. The man who cut it, knew me, he reminded me that I had fined at the Water Police Court, some short time ago, for Sunday [thieving, drinking?]. Met Mrs A Cruickshank and her daughter, Jessie just outside the shop, they are going to New Zealand tomorrow at 12 o’clock. I went to Coles Book Shop afterwards but as it was coming on to rain, I returned to the lodgings about 5, Grace coming from her walk just at the same time.\n\nAfter dinner at the lodgings Grace and I walked to the Oriental Hotel, in Collins St, not far from our lodgings to see Mrs Cruikshank and her daughter, stayed talking till nearly 11 o’clock. Agnes C, much annoyed at the extravagant charges a livery stable keeper has made for an afternoon drive (from 2 to 5.30) about the town, no less than £1.15! Ashley Moore ordered it for them. On going to bed found the bed room full of gas. Opened both the door and windows but without much advantage. Tried to sleep through it, but could not, eyes and tongues effected by tasting it as it were. Felt nervous about the possibility of an explosion, and danger to our health.\n\nHeard Sir E. Strickland and John [Mann?] were both in Melbourne.\n\nWednesday 17th December 1884\n\nKept awake all night, owing to the escape of gas. One of the lodgers upstairs neglected to turn off the screw and our bedroom was filled with it, had to open the window all night. After breakfast took a cab, drove to the Agents of the ship and obtained a letter for Grace from T. Icely. Thence on in the direction of the Bishop and Deans residences near Fitzroy Gardens. On our way met Broderick of Sydney who made us turn back a few yards to see his wife who is staying with her daughter, Mrs Purves, the barrister, to whom Broderick introduced me. The house is a very handsome one, and furnished accordingly. I got out of the cab and walked a little way with Grace in the Fitzroy Gardens which is more noticeable for its shrubberies and trees than for its gardens. From hence we drove to the Yorke Diocese Registry Office, where we had agreed to meet Yorke at XI o’clock. He was very punctual as he was going to leave for Sydney by steamer at 12. I gave him the travelling bag I borrowed form Milly, and asked him to deliver it to Chris Russell on arrival in Sydney. We afterwards went to the Markets, a heavy shower made us undetermined where next to go but as the storm cleared away, we got in to an omnibus and drove to the Zoological Gardens, some little distance away, passing on the road there the University and Colleges on the right hand side, catching sight of the Exhibition Building, large Brewery &c &c. We were much pleased in walking through the Zoological Gardens, not only are the gardens themselves well kept, with numerous parterres with dozens[?] of flowers in full bloom scenting the atmosphere, but the animals seemed all choice ones, well fed and attended to. A magnificent Lion, Tiger, Panther, Leopard attracted our especial attention, the Ourangontang, Esquimaux dog, were next to this. We returned by 1 o’clock in a waggonette to Melbourne, had lunch at the Melbourne Coffee Palace, where we lunched with Yorke yesterday. And then walked about Bourke, Collins, Swanston, Elizabeth Streets. Purchased Christmas cards, and one or two books for light reading. Returned to Miss Gould’s lodgings ( Parliament Place, No.3, Bella Vista) packed up our boxes, paid the bill 16/- a day for two of us, and hired a waggonette to take us to the Pier at Williamstown where the “Ganges” was lying. The distance from Melbourne is nearly 10 miles. And the fare by train 9d each. We commenced on reaching the shop to change our cabin we had occupied amidship two berth cabin on Port side, nearly opposite the Engines, from the noise of which I suffered considerably and we were allowed to go into No.37, a 4 berth cabin, aft but which though far more roomy and comfortable was rendered also uncomfortable from the proximity to the screw, which caused us to feel the vibrating motion more than in the other cabin. We found it very cold today, on board a cold wind blowing from S.West.\n\nGrace and I occupied in the evening writing letters for Sydney.\n\nLanding and staying in Melbourne cost all together £5.10.\n\nThursday 18th December 1884\n\nSent the following letters off by the Postman who came on board to deliver letters, viz;\n\nLady Manning from Grace.\n\nLady Stephen from Grace with Christmas card.\n\nMarie Russell from Grace.\n\nMrs Garvin from Grace with Photograph.\n\nMrs O’Brien from Grace with Christmas Card\n\nMiss Campbell from Grace.\n\nMilbourne, from Grace\n\nMrs Wise from Grace.\n\nMrs Wise from myself.\n\nMilly from myself\n\nS.F. Wise from myself.\n\nPlunkett from myself with date of lease.\n\nMcDonald from myself.\n\nMrs M.H. Stephen from myself with Christmas Card.\n\nJack from myself.\n\nWe did not leave our moorings till between 12 and 1 o’clock and a great many more passengers came on board for various ports. Amongst others Mr Fenwick, who is going as far as King George’s Sound, in his way to “Perth” where he has received a [home?] appointment of Harbour Master. Mr Fenwick was formerly in H.M.S. “Elio[?]” and subsequently Clerk in the [Emmigration, Transportation?] Office under Wise, and he has asked Grace and myself to call and see his father, Admiral Fenwick, on arrival in England. He sings and plays on the piano agreeably, and in the evening in the Music Hall, was the only one who sang. Miss Douglas played a few waltzes, and Miss Millat and Miss Boodle, lay on the benches, the former feeling headachy and having recourse to [Someling?] Salts.\n\nAfter the ship had left Williamstown, the Steward delivered to us the following letters which had been sent by the Agents to the ship, too late however, to answer them.\n\n1 from Milly to me.\n\n1 from Fanny.\n\n1 from Wise with inclosure.\n\n1 from Griffiths (official) with £5 for Post Box.\n\n1 from Mrs Donkin.\n\n1 from Scholes milkman (receipt).\n\nAmused tonight by Miss Millat satirically describing (to herself) the Captain as partly a Bacchus and partly a Cupid with a monkey jacket round him. The Captain’s rejoinder seemed to take for a fact, when he remarked that Cupid was very seldom represented with any clothes on!.\n\nFriday 19th December 1884\n\nHad a very rough night of it. Heavy swell on, off “Cape Otway” which we passed during the night, and the ship rolled from side to side all night long. Could not sleep and awoke this morning with great pain in back of head and nape of neck, could hardly turn my neck round from a feeling of stiffness, could not shave myself, and had to send for the ship’s Barber to shave me, ( a Lascar). Very few ladies at the breakfast table. Mrs and Miss McConnell, Miss Millat, Miss Boodle all suffering from mal-de-mer and those whose names I do not know. Miss Millat and Miss Boodle occupy the same cabin together now and at about 11,they came on deck, reclining in chairs, and [carried?] by Captain and Mr DeBuen, from one part of the deck to the other, withersoever they whims or caprices desired.\n\nLost my silver pencil case, and it must have tumbled out of my pocket I suppose and rolled along somewhere.\n\nSaturday 20th December 1884\n\nAbout 9 o’clock in the morning, we anchored in the Roadhead opposite “Glenelg” which is built on a very broad beautiful beach extending some distance, upon which carriages and horsemen were driving and riding along. The Pier too extended far into the sea and puts me in mind of the old Pier at Ryde. Many of the passengers with the Captain went on shore soon after arriving. Grace and I went off in the Tug about XI o’clock. The train left in about a quarter of an hour and we reached Adelaide in about 20 minutes. We walked to the Port Office and posted our letters.\n\n1 to Fanny from Grace and myself.\n\n1 to Milbourne from me.\n\n1 to Griffiths inclosing the £5 he had sent me for Poor Box, W-\n\n1 to Marie inclosing another to Chris.\n\n1 to George Pinnock from Grace.\n\n1 to Mrs Donkin.\n\n1 to Dr Viyngdon[?]\n\n1 to Mrs Dowling.\n\n1 to A. McDonald (McDonald Smith esq.)\n\nWe then took a hansome cab, drove up King William St, then two smaller streets to a Coffee Palace where we had lunch, and at 1.15 took the same cab and drove to the Botanical Gardens. Got out and walked about, admiring the way the gardens were laid out, and how well kept under the supervision of a Dr Schonkey[?] (a German). The Greenhouses too appeared full of rare exotics. Adelaide is a pretty town, some of the public buildings, which are all concentrated in a large square are remarkably fine. And the trams, which are worked with horses appeared to me far preferable to those of Sydney worked with [horses, undes?] All the Banks are large, fine buildings, and one in particular “Bank of South Australia” a most admirable piece of architecture, Corinthian pillars introduced in every part of the building. The Hospital adjacent to the Botanic Gardens appeared to be a very handsome edifice, and several other public institutions along that line of road attacked attention. King William Street is a fine large wide street. Adelaide is built at the [front?] of a lofty range of hills, which act as a background to the town and looked at from seaward gives it a very pretty effect. There are two lines of Railway from the Pier to the Town, we went one way and returned the other, reaching the Pier on our return little before 4, where we found several of our fellow passengers, McConnell, Douglas, &c, also awaiting the Tug Boat to take us to the ship. Several other passengers came on board but whose names as yet, have not been made known. The day was beautifully fine, and much warmer then any we had experienced since leaving Sydney. Notwithstanding, I felt very unwell all day, having had a severe and sudden attack of pain in the kidneys, which rendered walking unpleasant. Had recourse to Dr Fischer’s medicines, which relieved me to a certain extent of the pain. Our pretty fellow passenger from Sydney (Miss Mallet) left the ship for good today, she is to remain in Adelaide till the arrival of the “Austral,” (Orient Line) from England, in which steamer she expects a young lady, who is coming out as her assistant, in the School or College at Ashfield, of which she is appointed Principal, and the Government of N.S. Wales. We met her in the tram from Glenelg to Adelaide where she got out with two other young lady friends, whom she did not introduce, but added as she left, in an offhand way, that she intended being at the Pier at 4 to bid adieu to the passengers, but we never saw her again! She is a perfect paradox, young, pretty, clever, sarcastic, seeking attention and getting it, and yet cold and heartless apparently. She says so herself, which at first I thought was merely ‘facon de parler’ on her part, but on further insight into her character, is, I fear, too painfully true. She does not look more than 24, and yet she has been chosen in England for the Head of College at Ashfield, at £300 a year. She had a similar offer to go to India at £600 a year but being consumptive her Doctors recommended her going to N.S. Wales instead. I should not be surprised at her turning Roman Catholic one of these days.\n\nWe sat down at the table at dinner about 50 people in all. One of the new comers, a lday, in the cabin next to our’s desperately ill, all night, from sea sickness.\n\nThe fare going to Glenelg in the Tug and back here 8/- for two\n\nRailway 2/\n\nLunch 4/6\n\nCab 6/\n\nFruit 3/5\n\n£1.3.5\n\nLeft Glenelg about 5 o’clock pm.\n\nSunday 21st December 1884\n\nHeavy sea on all last night. A head wind blowing, a good deal of rolling and some pitching. Neither of which seem to affect me, to my surprise! Number of passengers absent. Miss McConnell did not make her appearance all day, nor Mr McCutcheon.\n\nAt XI o’clock the Captain read the Morning Service in the cabin. About 20 people attending. The wind very cold and I went on deck for a short time. In consequence of the rolling of the Ship this morning, I was obliged to send for the Lascar Barber to shave me. The Captain at dinner amused Miss Boodle with a description of his wife’s “first attempt at making a task!” [tash?] And also with the examination he went through by the Medical Officer, preparatory to having his life assured, and who pronounced he had “too large a heart”!! The Captain of a facetious turn of mind, and in figure and face would not be a bad representative at a Faery Ball, of Henry VIII, or even “Blue Beard” at a Pantomime. He never the less read the Service uncommonly well, has a capital voice, admirable intonation, and properly emphasizes his words at the proper time and place. He is a sharp, clever man, has seen the World, good reader of character, and he knows a thing or two “as he could express himself, withal a kind hearted man I believe.\n\nMonday 22nd December 1884\n\nVery cold on deck, cold wind. Suffering much from pain in kidney, and pain in head and nape of neck. Too Dr Fischer’s medicine for kidney (No.2 Pulsatilea)\n\nTuesday 23rd December 1884\n\nVery heavy sea, cold wind blowing, writing letters all day long.\n\nI wrote to Fanny.\n\nMilly\n\nWise (inclosing copy of letter to Plunkett)\n\nGertrude Manning\n\nMarie\n\nWilliams (Crown Solicitor, as to extension of Leave)\n\nPlunkett (Under Secretary as to Leave.)\n\nHeron\n\nM.H. Stephen\n\nGrace wrote to Mrs O’Brien\n\nLady Manning\n\nPhillip Pinnock\n\nMiss MacIntyre\n\nMrs James Manning\n\nMrs M.H. Stephen\n\nMrs Dowling\n\nSo rough obliged to get Ship’s Barber (a Lascar) to shave me fro the third time.\n\nWednesday 24th December 1884\n\nReached King George Sound at about 9 o’clock a.m. and we applauded getting into smooth water after rolling about last night. After breakfast the Health Officer (Dr Rogers) came on board as a matter of form for our examination took place. And then the passengers, 3 young girls and their mother (Muir by name) left together with Fenwick who is going to Perth as Harbour Master there, and Woodcott who is going to inspect the Banks of Perth. We accompanied them on shore to Albany which is not more than a mile from where our ship “Ganges” lay. The names of the passengers were Mr Schwartz, Shaw, Miss Soloman, we landed at the Pier, and went straight to the Post Office and got stamps and posted our letters for Sydney, which will probably remain some time before an opportunity of a steamer coming in to forward them. I met on the way Mr Loftie who is Government Resident and P.M. at Albany. He introduced himself to me and to his wife and insisted on my lunching with him which I did, he is sending his son, Henry, a boy of 10 years old, to England for his education and under the immediate charge of Miss Brown (pronounced Brun) a lady who came out to Perth to look after some people [purpose?]. She lives in Western Australia, her brother is Chief Officer on board the P.O. vessel, [“Albany”?) is engaged to Miss Boodle in our ship. And Loftie told me her other brother, though he does not claim the title, is the present Baronet, Sir – Brown. Mr Loftie is worthy his name, a very tall man upwards of 6 foot 3 inches. And I like him much, a gentlemany, well mannered man, perfectly thrown away in such a little town as Albany is, with a population of only 1,000 inhabitants! His brother in England, a clergyman, was formerly lecturer at the Savoy Chapel, London and has written a great number of books of an Archeological character. One especially (in 2 volumes) on London. A great man on Heraldry, specimens of which while Government Resident, seeing I liked the sort of thing showed me, in which the Loftie family is traced from the times of one of the King Edwards. He bears the same arms, motto and crest as Lord [Acgurin?] Loftus, whose family (the Ely) is a younger branch, and when Lord Loftus, ancestor, was made Lord Chancellor and enobled, they changed their name of Loftie to Loftus. From being Government Resident, Mr Loftie keeps a sort of open house and entertains every one of any position, who calls is coming from or going to England in the different steamers. When the Flag Squadron went to Sydney some years ago, the young Princes spent a fortnight with him. And I believe in addition to his salary of £500 a year, he has lately been allowed an extra £100 a year for the expenses such [pricey?] entertainments as a cast upon him.\n\nIn addition to Miss Brown and young Loftie, two other passengers came on board from “Albany.” Miss Burley and Miss Sadler, the former connected with the Scholastic Institution at Perth (under the supervision of the Bishop) and a proficient in music and gold medalist besides. The latter, a Miss Sadler, has been a pupil Teacher in one of the schools Miss Burleigh has had the management of, and is going to Germany (being clever though only 17) to study and finish her education in Germany.\n\nWe did not leave the Roadstead at Albany which is a very land locked harbour till nearly 5 having had more cargo in the shape of wool and tin. The weather was fine but cold with a strong wind blowing, which together with the roughness of the sea, caused us to ship much water when going in the Tug boat from the ship to the Pier.\n\nIn the evening the ladies were practicing chants and hymns on the Harmonium in the Saloon, to prepare themselves for tomorrow’s Christmas services.\n\nMiss Burley has only been 6 months from England, and is now unexpectedly returning there. She was engaged for 3 years to be at the head of a Government Educational Department, but on the voyage out from England, met a Doctor on board who is a resident of India, she became engaged to him, hence her contract with the Perth Authorities came to an end, though I understand, not without some considerable sum of money being given to absolve her from the agreement she had entered into. She appears clever, and is evidently one of the ‘advanced progress women” of the day. Has a Certificate of Merit from the Academy of Middlesex, London.\n\nPosted all the letters Grace and I wrote yesterday at the Post Office, Albany, this morning.\n\nPaid 2.4 postage\n\nSteamer 2\n\nPhoto\n\nThursday 25th December 1884\n\nChristmas Day. We had a very disturbed night of it last night. Ship rolling much. Still cold and windy. I sat on deck however in the day time with two great coats on and rug wrapped round me. Had service at 11, read by the Captain, and the young ladies formed themselves with the aid of Mr and Mrs Bowen, into a capital choir.\n\nThe Saloon was decorated with evergreens and numbers of flags and “Union Jacks.”\n\nThe Captain gave us a capital dinner and a large cake covered with sugar, more like a wedding cake, surmounted with a good effigy of Father Christmas. As dessert was finished, I asked permission of the Captain to propose a Toast, he not knowing what to was coming. I therefore rose and said to the ladies and gentlemen, That on a festive occasion like the present where everyone was enjoying a happy Christmas, that I felt it incumbent on me to rise and propose the health of our Entertainer, who had provided us with so much comfort and [music?] throughout the voyage. And with much pleasure would ask one and all to drink to the health of Captain Andrews, whom I trusted would live long to command the good ship “Ganges.”\n\nThe Captain’s health was then drunk with music and honours “he is a jolly good fellow” &c. and then he returned thanks [amus—ly?] but adding that the Company and Purser were the chief persons to be thanked for whatever good arrangement had been carried out.\n\nIn the evening dancing on the Quarter deck, (Miss Brown and Miss [Mumans?] playing) Miss Sadler and Mr Schwartz, Mr Conlan and Miss McConnell, Miss Douglas and Frenchman, Mr Grunow and Miss Boodle dancing. The gentlemen subscribed 2/6 each to give the Stewards a Christmas Box, and Grace and Mrs McConnell went round and got 1/- each from the ladies for the 2 stewards (in all £1)\n\nSpoke to Mrs Conlan for first time. Her husband (in a Bank) has some affliction of the eyes, and he is going home to consult some [dentis?] in London. She was a Miss McLachlan of Melbourne, who was a partner of Firebrace, Mrs James Manning’s brother. She knows the Manning family well, and used to go to Lady Manning’s tennis parties when she was last in Sydney.\n\nStill taking Dr Fischer’s medicine for kidneys No.2\n\nFriday 26th December 1884\n\nA much quieter night. I slept better and had less pain in nape of neck and kidneys. Sat on deck from after breakfast till ¼ to 1, then lunched.\n\nThere is a Mr Cooper who comes from New Zealand, and is on his way to India. He is a bit of an artist, and has been sketching the different people on board, (in colour) he was so like in look, tone of voice, and person, dress &c that I thought he must be a brother of the man who married Miss [Moes?] and today I asked him the question, and he said that he was, I asked him if his brother had been in New Zealand and he said yes, and as a last question I put it to him direct, whether his brother has been divorced from his wife, which he said was the case. I asked him what was her maiden name, he said “Winter,” and her father he believed lived in Melbourne.\n\nThe Steward who attends our bedroom found my silver pencil case, which I lost some days ago.\n\nTaking Dr Fischer’s medicine No.1. for kidneys.\n\nSaturday 27th December 1884\n\nGetting into a warmer latitude. All the portholes of Saloon open. Left off my overcoat. Mrs Bray (wife of the Chief Secretary of Adelaide) made her first appearance at dinner today.\n\nIn the evening music and singing in the Music Hall. A Miss King who has been very unwell lately played and sang excellently one of her [says?] Tennyson Brook. Mr and Mrs Bowen also sang a duet. And the Captain several songs, which as he has a good voice were much applauded.\n\nMade the acquaintance of Mr Addington for the first time today. He is a son, I believe, of Lord Sidmouth, and is on his way to India to join his Regiment, the 61st.He is returning from New Zealand where he has been paying a visit to his brother who is settled there, and leaves the ship at “Colombo.” He tells me he is well acquainted with Admiral Sir Antony and Lady [Hawkins?] who are some connection of his, and that his younger brother went out in H.M.S. [Wanderer? Wantrereme?] as a Midshipman and used to stay at the Hoskin’s house in Musgrave St, Sydney.\n\nSunday 28th December 1884\n\nMuch warmer, thermometer 75º. Lovely day, and the sea much smoother, and its colour reflected from the blue skies above very beautiful. Flying fish make their appearance. Left off my warm coats and the other gentlemen passengers put on their white suits and white hats. All the ports in the ship wide open to admit of the air. At X.30 the crew were mustered Poop, and the Lascars in their colored habitiments and refined countenances and figures looked most picturesque. At XI the Captain read the morning service, much enhanced by the effective choir that had been so suddenly improvised. Miss McConnell at the Harmonium and Mr, Mrs Bowen, Miss King, Miss Burley, Miss Sadler, Mr Schwartz, Miss Brown, composed the singers. Some of the 2nd Class passengers attended and I dare say there were 40 or 50 persons composing the congregation. The scene would have made an interesting photograph.\n\nFelt somewhat better today so far as the pain in my kidneys went. But my knees, ankles, and joints felt stiff and uncomfortable and a feeling of great fullness in the head. Taking No.3 medicine, prescribed by Dr Fischer (Banyglotis).\n\nGrace not well either, complaining the last few days. And is taking alternatively [Nasc?] Vormica and Sulphur, in accordance with directions in the Book I got from Dr Fischer.\n\nAs I sit in the Cuddy or Saloon, now writing at 8.30pm I cannot help noting what a handsome room it is, large enough to seat at dinner 130 or 140 people, fitted up in the medieval style, and the effect of being lighted with 15 oil lamps is admirable.\n\nMonday 29th December 1884\n\nVery warm. Thermometer rising 77º degrees. Reading the “French King of the court of George 2nd”. Playe backgammon this evening with Mrs McConnell. The young people rehearsing the two plays they are to perform on Friday.\n\nMusic and singing in the evening in the Music Hall. Miss King the chief vocalist.\n\nTaking Dr Fischer’s medicine No.3 for the kidneys. Decidedly better, but feel a numbness in back still. Great fullness about head on awaking.\n\n“Punkahs” at dinner time introduced for the first time. The first time I ever saw them worked.\n\nTuesday 30th December 1884\n\nShip going 13 knots an hour. Thermometer 84.º Very warm and all the passengers nearly in summer attire.\n\nWe have our port holes open day and night since Sunday. Taking Dr Fischer’s medicine No.3. Feel better as far as pain in kidneys is concerned.\n\nHad a game of chess with Grunow (the Captain[?]) neither he (he said) nor I had played the game for 30 years.\n\nYoung Loftie complaining of being unwell. Late dinner and Lobster cutlets are not the thing for small boys. Miss Burley and I had a long talk about books &c.\n\nWednesday 31st December 1884\n\nMade 306 miles today, the best run yet make. Last night was insufferably warm. Could not sleep for the intensity of the heat. Grace and I “took tea” with Mrs Conran:- this “taking tea” is a peculiar kind of institution on board of ship. You ask, or your friend ask, half a dozen passengers to come to take tea at a separate table in Saloon at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. You possibly have a private supply of tea, a tea pot and a few cups and saucers. If not then Steward supplies them, and you then get a few of the passengers to gather round you, drink a couple of cups of tea and talk for half an hour or so, and then return on deck to read, lie down, or talk with the rest of passengers: it is a sort of “playing at giving a party” or perhaps, it may be better likened to a lot of little girls drinking tea out of baby cups and saucers. It is etiquette to invite the those that have invited you, to this - - “entertainment” at your table. So that the farce is carried on indefinitely, as ever [?] to the end of the voyage or till the private supply of tea is exhausted.\n\nThis evening being the end of the year 1884, was celebrations, by some of the passengers getting up which was called an “Exhibition of Mrs [Savoy’s?]” wax work figures.” And at 8.30 a sort of Theatre was marked off, by the suspension of various flags, forming the drop scene as it were and lamps put in front as “footlights.”\n\nMr Bowen acted as the showman, and did his part cleverly. Miss Pope represented the Sewing Madames, Mr Conran, being very tall, Chang the Chinese Giant, Mr [Wenz?] (the Frenchman) a Maori Chief. Mr McCutcheon a Gens D’arme. Miss Douglas Mother [Pigat’s?] Sortez [Syness?]. Miss MacConnell ‘Little Bo Peep.’\n\nThey were all supposed to be inanimate wax works figures but which moved by mechanism, it was supposed, and therefore had to be “wound up,” and this duty fellto the showman’s boy, young Arthur Douglas. After the Exhibition had been gone through, there were repeated calls for an “Encore,” and after a while the curtain was raised and the showman, appealed to our pity pointing out that all his valueable collection (owing to the heat) had melted away and that therefore he was sorry to say he was unable to give the audience “a repetition” of the scene.\n\nThe different actors in the “Exhibition” has slipped away in the mean time, and joined the rest of the passengers on deck and joined in the dances which followed. Polkas and Waltzs. I went to bed at XI. But the rest of the passengers kept up the old year until the new one was ushered in at 12pm overhead my cabin, I could hear the music of Sir Roger de Coverly, and the beats of the feet on deck. And a little time after I understand some of the Stewards and 2nd class passengers came aft, drawing behind them, (and addressing the Captain for some time)the figure of a man laid in a coffin, symbolical of the dead year, which they threw overboard. They then in procession marched back to the forward part of the ship, and a second time returned in similar procession, bringing with them a newborn baby, symbolical of the birth of a new year. I understand I was well and cleverly devised.\n\nThursday 1st January 1885\n\nAnother good day’s run, 300 miles. About lunch time the sea, which has been very smooth the last few days, became rough, or there was a much greater swell, which caused the ship to pitch. Clouds too are gathering round, so that it will not be surprising if we get rain soon.\n\nI heard today there was another lady passenger who has not yet made her appearance on deck or at the table, has her meals taken to her in her cabin, and takes exercise at “peep of day” on the Hurricane deck. She is a widow, and some say her husband was Purser on board the “Sutley,” and that she is now engaged to our Purser of the “Ganges.” Mrs Boyle, and that she has £1500 a year. Mrs Boyle says £8,000. After writing this she passed through the Saloon, a stout, pale faced, plain looking woman of about 40 years of age, and dressed in deep black minus, however, a widow’s cap! The lines, “fat, fair and forty are most applicable to her!\n\nFriday 2nd January 1885\n\nClouds gathering, sea rough, ports screwed down, cabins very warm. Thermometer 83 to 84 during the mornings. The young people who are going to act in the plays, “Pillicoddy” and the “Dumb Belle” are nervously anxious as to whether the weather will improve or get worse.\n\nHad not much appetite today. Feet and ankles much swollen. Early this morning light squalls of rain fell, which drove some (who were sleeping on deck) below. Just before lunch, more frequent and heavier storms of rain fell. A change of wind and a head sea, and towards 8 o’clock a regular downpour, which lasted all the night and completely prevented the Theatricals taking place. Notwithstanding, the place had been fitted up on deck by ship’s carpenter, as a Theatre, and all the ladies were dressed ready for the performance. Some suggested performing in the Saloon, it was, however, decided to postpone the Entertainment till tomorrow.\n\nGrace had a party at 4 o’clock, the McConnells, Miss Brown, Miss Boodle, Mr Addington, Mr Schwarz, Mr McCutcheon and young Loftie.\n\nWe only ran 276 miles today.\n\nWeather so warm, with all the Ports closed, that several ladies had their beds made up in the after Saloon, on tables and on floor.\n\nSaturday 3rd January 1885\n\nWeather cleared and enabled us to have our Ports opened again, giving more light and air. I felt very unwell, pain in bones, giddiness in head, numbness at back about the region of the kidneys. Commenced again taking Dr Fischer’s medicine No.1.\n\nMr Bowen told me today that Mr Bray who has been Chief Secretary of Adelaide for 3 years is likely to be knighted on his arrival in England on accordance to political services. He is a very popular man there and has represented one constituency for 10 years. He is a Solicitor by profession. Mr Bowen, who gave me this information, is an intelligent young man, and clever besides, a native of Adelaide; sings well and is the moving [spiner?] or the Chief of the Theatricals to take place, the life and soul of the whole affair. I gather from his conversation that he is in business (perhaps an importer of goods).\n\nAt 8 o’clock we were all summoned on deck by the ringing of the Bell, and a few minutes after the curtain (several curtains from the cabin doors taken for the occasion) of the little Theatre was drawn not up, but on one side; and Mr Schwarz 9in evening Costume, read a sort of Prologue written in verse, by the 2nd Officer Mr Davis. The first play was “Little Pillicoddy” and the following was the cast of characters.\n\nMr Pillicoddy – Mr Brown.\n\nCaptain O’Scuttle – Mr Bray\n\nMrs Pillicoddy – Miss Boodle\n\nMrs O’Scuttle – Miss Burleigh\n\nSarah (servant girl) – Miss Sadler\n\nIn the 2nd play which was called “The Dumb Belle”\n\nHenry Vivian – Mr Schwarz\n\nMr Manvers – Mr Cooper\n\nPhelia O’Smirk (Valet) – Mr McCutcheon\n\nEliza – Miss McConnell\n\nMary (servant) – Miss Douglas\n\nStage Manager - Dr Egan\n\nThe first piece was the most amusing, and kept one in a perpetual roar of laughter: Mr Pillicoddy married a widow whose first husband was supposed to be drowned, who Pillicoddy believes has suddenly turned up to claim Mrs Pillicoddy, in the shape of Captain O’Scuttle the brother of the drowned man, whose wife is indignant and jealous, that she leaves him, and he is in search of her when Pillicoddy and he meet at the same house, where the denouement takes place. Miss Boodle as Mrs Pillicoddy looked remarkably handsome and well dressed. Miss Sadler was [memotable?] as Sarah the servant girl. In the second piece Henry Vivian, a young officer has been half inclined to marry Eliza, but as she is talkative he writes to say that he should prefer to marry one who is “comparatively dumb.” So Eliza shams to have suddenly become both deaf and dumb and he has to converse through a speaking trumpet which is trying to the lover, and makes him recant. Eliza acted her part extremely well.\n\nSunday 4th January 1885\n\nPouring rain nearly all day. Service held at Xi o’clock and a strong effective choir formed today, perhaps the best we shall have. In fact it will be necessarily weakened by next Sunday, owing to the many leaving at Colombo tomorrow. Miss McConnell played the Harmonium, Mr and Mrs Bowen, Miss Brown, Miss Burleigh, Miss Salder, Miss Solomon. Mr Schwarz and the Captain (who read prayers) were the singers.\n\nWriting several letters today to Fanny, Milly and Addison, which Grace did likewise to Philip Pinnock, Fanny and Marie (with journal inclosed) which I intend posting tomorrow, as we hope to reach (early) “Colombo” in the morning.\n\nMonday 5th January 1885\n\nA fine morning, but we had a rather rough night, with sea rolling. Early land seen, and at 8 o’clock, “Colombo” (in the Island of Ceylon) was very distinct. “Adams Peak,” a high mountain, in the distance completely overtopping the rest of the coastline. The difference in the appearance of the trees, nothing but long stemmed cocoa nut trees and the peculiar greenness of the sea, sowed we had changed our clime, if not our natures. The long break walls near which the Ganges was to be placed was and this feature is the scene, and then Pitchboat, half whale boat, half pike boat, manned by an almost naked crew of Cingalese and Tammils, the former a handsome sleek copper skinned people, the others dark as negroes. Catamarans also swarmed about the ship trying to obtain passengers for the shore. We had breakfast as usual at 9, and in about half an hour several of the passengers prepared to land, some to spy out the place, others to re-embark in the P.& O. Company’s Steamer “Messalia” lying a few cable lengths from us. Of this number Mr Addington, Mr Schwarz, Mr Wendz, Mr Shaw, Mr Cooper and Mrs Solomon were for the “Messalia” for India. Mr and Mrs Bowen were going to remain in Colombo for some time, also Mr Gronow (the Austrian) and Mr de Burn (the electrician and Frenchman). Mr McCutcheon and Mr Hislop. We have thus lost ten, or eleven, of our passengers. The greatest loss will be the Bowens, who were so musical and good natured types. I understand Mrs Johnson [Solomon?] was a Bar-maid at Melbourne, which perhaps may account for her keeping herself aloof very much from the Lady passengers on board. As “coaling” (which is a most disagreeable process to go through or be endured) was about to take place almost immediately, it was necessary for those passengers who could afford it to seek refuge on shore as well as to indulge in sight seeing. Grace and I therefore, also the McConnells, Conrans, Miss Brown, and Miss Boodle, and Mr Stone and Mr Caldy, went on shore about 10, in a rough sort of steam launch which landed us on a pier next Customs House. We were soon surrounded with a troop of natives of all sizes and colours, and at first difficult to tell the sexes, for the young men of 14 or 15 are so delicately and gracefully formed, with fine eyes and an absence of hair about their faces, which makes them (particularly as they were long hair and turned up in a knot behind, like a woman) appears quite a feminine type of figure and faces, and a very pleasing type too. Some half a dozen at a time would seize one of our bags, another half dozen our umbrellas and sticks and in self defence we were obliged to hire one of them (Antony by name) who acted as our guide and warded off the rest of his fellows. We went to the Oriental Hotel, left our bags and baggage, and then with our Cingalese attendant, took a drive round about Ceylon. The carriage was a four wheeled one of peculiar built with hood to it, a sort of low humble dog cart holding 4. We drove to the Barracks, Gallegace Hotel, through the native village, Slave Island, for about an hour, and then returned to the Inn, as we had agreed to lunch together with Mr, Mrs Conran at ¼ to 1. We found two of our other passengers in the Coffee Room (Mr and Mrs Solomon) who were desirous of lunching at our table, so that when the Conrans came in we made 6 at the table. They gave us all sorts of dishes at lunch, but I did not care very much for any of them, and the fish (I don’t know it name) was in my opinion inedible. The room is a very spacious one with innumerable tables, all laid for customers; all the attendants are Cingalese and dressed in flowing white habitements and all the time we were at lunch, the Punkahs were kept continually pulled. At 1.30 the Conrans and ourselves in one carriage, and the Solomons in another started for the Railway Station, as we had determined to go to Kandy, about 80 miles by Railway. We then met the McConnells (who had been lunching with the Pattersons, he the Collector of Customs) and Douglas’s, and a Mr Hislop, another of our passengers. I was very tired before starting, suffering very much from pains in my head (the ‘occiput’[?]) and back which added to the heat of the day made me rather indisposed for sight seeing, however having paid my fare, getting Return tickets for Kandy and back to Colombo (for which I paid 15/-) for each of us) I was obliged to go. I nevertheless was delighted with the view from beginning to end, particularlary the last portion of the journey, just after making the ascent up the Hills. The railway it is said is the best laid lines in any part of the World, and being broad guage was much easier to travel on than those in Australia. We went seventy[?] over 11 miles an hour. This Railway was opened at the time Sir H. Robinson was Governor. The train was a lengthy one, and crowded, as people who had been passing their Christmas Holidays at Colombo were now returned to Kandy and the hill country. Kandy is situated about 1,000 feet above the sea, and is comparatively a healthy climate. But all the low lying parts suffer from Malaria, or rather did suffer once, before the country got cleared and cultivated as it is now. Indeed at the time of the making of the Railway about 20 years ago, which was made by Cingalese labor, alone, the mortality that occurred amongst the labourers was so great an exercise that the Government of the day studiously avoided letting it be known, in fact concealed the actual number of deaths, lest it might act as a deterrent to them undertaking similar employment.\n\nThe first station we came to after leaving Colombo was what is named Maradeena (Maradana) Junction, which occurred only 7 miles, the next stations were as follows-\n\nKelaniya\n\nHunapitiya\n\nMakara\n\nHenaralgoda\n\nVeyangoda\n\nNurigama\n\nAmbepussa\n\nPolgahawela\n\nRambukhana\n\nKadugannawa\n\nPeredeniya Junction\n\nKandy\n\n13 stations in all. We reached Kandy about 6.15,just getting dark, sufficiently dark however, to distinguish the fire flys shooting from tree to tree in part of the Inn. We all intended going to the Queen Hotel, (of which a Mr A.H. Campbell is manager) and we accordingly got in to the carriage sent down by the Innkeeper to bring the passengers to his Inn. The distance from Railway to Inn about ¼ of a mile I suppose. After alighting we were surrounded by numbers of the Cingalese wishing to sell their different articles of merchandise to us, gems of all kinds, jewellery,[thank?],silver bangles, caps, tortoishell, sandal wood boxes &c &c. We all hurried past them, in search of a bedroom and some rest. Every one seemed to be inclined to adopt the motto “Everyone for himself.” We willingly were all housed or ‘rather bedroomed’ in due time. Ours had two beds in it, of very primitive manufacture, a dressing table, and looking glass. 1 chair. Of course the waiter and chambermen were natives and very polite as dinner did not take place till 7.30. I ordered some tea and bread butter as a stop gap. At dinner numbers of other persons were dining too, and as tomorrow is the first day of the Assizes here and at which the Chief Justice of the Colony is to preside, some of these people may have been either litigants, jurymen or others connected with the Courts.\n\nThere were several courses, but I can’t say I enjoyed my dinner and the fish was of the same tasteless [tribe?] that we partook of at Colombo.\n\nAfter dinner we all retired to the Hall of the Inn where a numerous concourse of natives had ensconced themselves, and had opened out, on the floor, different goods for sale. First there was, or there were dealers in gems and jewellery, all kinds, Tortoise shell combes, Crepe shawls, caps for smokers, sticks of all kinds, necklaces gold and silver, card cases and boxes made of sandal wood, toys for children, and a thousand and one other nick nacks.\n\nMrs Conran bought 2 silver bracelets. Mrs McConnell, brass plate, mats &c &c. I looked at sapphires unset. One the vender asked me £8 for, but I told him I would not buy any till I had the advantage of daylight to look at it in. He then offered it to me for £5, then for £3, and then for £2. Some of the passengers went to the Buddhist Temples about half a mile away but as I found it necessitated my taking off my boots and going barefooted before “entering there,” I gave it up rather than catch a cold or cough. We all went to bed at about X.30, as we have to get up early tomorrow and have breakfast before taking the train back tomorrow which leaves at 7 o’clock in the morning.\n\nI forgot to mention that shortly after our landing from the ship this morning I posted the following letters, and paid 5/6 for Postage Stamps.\n\n1 from myself to Mrs Wise.\n\n1 from myself to Milly\n\n1 from myself to Addison\n\n1 from Grace to Mrs Wise\n\n1 from Grace to Marie (with journal)\n\n1 from Grace to Philip Pinnock\n\nI understand however there is no Mail going to Australia for the next 10 days or a fortnight.\n\nI must enter my protest again at the numbers of Australians who have been at Colombo, and who have never alluded to it but in a passing remark, as it were, it is most astonishing that the beauties of the places, and the extreme difference of manners and customs that prevails, has never in my hearing been enlarged upon. Personally I would not have missed seeing this quaint town for a good deal. And as I first entered it, and saw the motley crowds coming towards me dressed in all the colors of the rainbow, and driving all sorts of vehicles, and animals the whole scene changing by fresh groups coming and then going away, without intermission I could not help contrasting what met my eye to the varied hues and patterns which as children, we were all apt to admire through the Kaleidoscope. Not a single European labourer was to be seen. Not a drunkard, not a vagrant, and the very antipodes of Sydney Larrikinism had it’s home here. It was refreshing to see the absence of loaders and swearers that continually annoy us in our part of the world.\n\nThe 102nd Regiment is stationed here, commanded by Col. [blank] and a Battery of Artillery under Col. Carey. I wonder if he is the Carey who was in Australia some years ago in the Artillery when Lovell was in command.\n\nTuesday 6th January 1885\n\nAwoken by the Cingalese chamberman at a little after 5. I was however, quite awake hours before, as I had, owing to the hardness of the bed, no sleep. And I heard it also (lay before,) pouring with rain, “as I lay a thumbing” would not be a very pleasant accompaniment for a long journey. Had a wretched and hurried breakfast, and drove away in a pour of rain, from the Inn, reaching the Railway in time for the 7 o’clock train to Colombo. Just as I got in the carriage box, the Cingalese again brought me the sapphire (as I supposed) which he offered me last night, at £8. He [pertineously?] pressed it on me, and in hopes of getting rid of him told him I had only half a sovereign with me, and that I could not give more, which to my surprise he at once consented to take, and he then exchanged our respective commodities with each other, he taking my half sovereign and I the ‘Sapphire.’ At least I hope it is a sapphire. Grace took up her seat in the Saloon carriage with the McConnells, Conrans and Douglas’s, and the Solomans in a carriage to themselves and I in one by myself but into which afterwards came, a planter (as it appeared to me) from the Courts, having left some place, his Bungalow or station,in the middle of the night to catch our train. He had been 17 years a resident of Ceylon and gave me much and interesting information about the different places as we passed by. Shortly after we left Kandy the rain ceased, and we had a beautiful view of the scenery the whole way down. I took particular notice of the rice fields (or as they are called here the Paddy fields) which everywhere met the eye, not only in the valleys underneath, but on the very ridges, and where too high to lay them and the water (as is their want,) cocoa plants, and in many places tea, for of late years the Coffee plants have been destroyed by some fungus that it did not pay to grow it, and so the tea plant has been successfully substituted, and has already obtained a name for itself. All through our journey, I was particularly struck at there being no fences or hedges or any apparent division of properties but my fellow traveler pointed out that all the Paddy fields were marked off in divisions of a sort of mud embankment of 1 foot by 1 foot wife and another thing remarkable was a native ploughing with a miserable little native bullock hardly bigger than a large Newfoundland, and with the one wooden plough of centuries ago invention. Another picture in the scene I caught and [?] was a set of [fern?] similar little bullock treading out the ear of the rice, being driven round and round in circle, then threshing the seed out, as the ancient Egyptians are represented to have done 4000 years ago. On our way my intelligent companion pointed out a well defined road at the foot of the valley, made by Col. Dawson of the Royal Engineers who died just as it was completed, and to whose memory has been erected a lofty monument visible as we passed the road in our carriage. The railway was almost superseded the use of the road, but which as far as I could see is beautifully made, not a rut visible and more like a road leading through a Park. Connected with this road there was a sort of Prophesy to the effect, that whenever a road connected Colombo to Kandy, that is Kandian King would cease to have power or influence and which prophesy literally came true I believe. On our road over the passes we came to a curious precipice, which we could look over some 3 or 400 feet, the wheels of the carriage apparently not being more than 6 or 7 inches from the edge of the precipice. And this point was called the “Sensation Rock”! In the distance we noticed two remarkable hills, o’looking[?] the rest, the Bible Rock and the Sentry Rock, both within sight at the same time. The Bible Rock was called so, not because of its being in any wise similar a shape to the Book, but simply that the name of the rock sounded something like\n\nBible and thence the conception[?] of the word.\n\nWe passed through several native villages, the people who were all owners of the property on which they lived, having their titles to their possessions duly registered. But at the same time paying a little of their produce with the Government or a sort of tax, which produce the Government sold on their behalf and then paid themselves. The whole of the native population appeared well fed and nourished and all gaily attired in the most lively colours and head dresses. Where ever you met them driving in their 2 bullock wagons covered with [pallen?] leaves or at their agricultural operations in the rice fields, or in the women’s washing grounds (where the washing is done by merely sorting the clothes and then beating the ground afterwards to get the water out) at all times and seasons, they appear beautifully clean in person and in dress, the front hair fastened back by a circular tortoise shell comb, and the back hair rolled into a knot behind, their dresses draped gracefully across their shoulders after the fashion of the Greek maidens of old.\n\nThe Cingalese do not work for others as a general rule, what with the coconuts, rice (two crops a year) and other products they manage to raise enough for their immediate wants, and I should judge a very little went far, for through every village we passed we saw numbers lying on the ground in their verandahs doing nothing, but taking, I suppose, a siesta. They also plant and sell for forage the Guinea Grass which is an excellent horse feed. It is fortunate our visit was paid at this time of the year to Ceylon, which is now [tesured?] the Autumn time, the end of the North East Monsoon. We arrived at the Railway station at 11.15am and the Conrans and ourselves drove to the Oriental Hotel, where we were yesterday, and where Grace and I and Mrs McConnell, her daughter and Miss Douglas had a small breakfast consisting of tea, eggs and a bread butter for which we paid one shilling each. Grace and I then (with our Cingalese attendant) hired the 4 wheeled carriage again, and then drove to the Cinnamon Gardens, to the Museum which we inspected and with which we were deeply interested. Specimens of sharks of all kinds, one in particular called the Tiger Shark, with a mouth large enough to swallow two grown people at once, then the Saw Fish with teeth like a pit saw on both sides projecting from a sort of bone in shape like a flat ruler of about two feet long. Specimens of Butterflies, Moths of all kinds. Skeletons of animals, elephants, a huge wildboar, a huge stone pedestal 10 feet high representative of a Lion, a [fun legs?], and in which the throne of the ancient Kings is in the years 1100 to 1200 were placed. Altogether a most interesting collection and had there been time, we certainly would have like to have devoted many more hours, or even days, than we did. We then drove in another direction where apparently the wealthy people resided, as we passed large Bungalows, one after the other, in large gardens and shrubberies, and then past the Galle [fine, free?] Hospital, facing the sea, past the Barracks and Hospital and to the street in which the Tower and light house combined stand. And then shortly after to the Oriental Hotel, adjoining which, along a sort of arcade are the chief jewellers shops into which (Ismail and Co, 1 York St) we were with Mrs McConnell and Miss Douglas, and where we were shewn jewellery and gems of all kinds. Sapphires, Rubies, Diamonds, Pearls, Cats Eyes.\n\n[in pencil at bottom of page - Arabi is –led near Colombo in consequence of several cases of cholera in Ceylon lately and now in the country.]\n\nOne Sapphire he, Ismail, brought out was worth £120, another catseye £90, and so on as to prices. We found the peculiarity of these dealers was, always to take less than asked in the first instance. I bought a sapphire pin for £1.10 for which the Dealer had asked £2.0. And a Cinnamon stone for £1.4 for which £1.15 was asked. We were perfectly tired with inspecting the contents of this man’s shop, and other jewellers seeing us come out of Ismail’s took us by the arm and insisted on our looking at their wares. However, we bought nothing more. At 4 o’clock we drove down to the jetty for the purpose of going on board as the ship was advertised to sail at 6. On reaching the vessel we beheld a most wretched sight, the awning drenched with water, and all the doors and windows of the Saloon and Cabin shut down, and the heat in consequence insufferable. The P. & O. Steamer “Nepaul” which was laying close to us and had just arrived from India, was sent on with the letters to England, and left, I understand, at 4 this afternoon. We saw, however, the “Missalia” leave her anchorage and steam out of Colombo for Bombay, India, our former fellow passengers, Mr Addiginton, Mr Schwartz, Mr Cooper, Mr Shaw were on deck and kept up cheering us as they departed.\n\nTwo new passengers have just come on board. I don’t know their names, but they look very like each other, as though mother and son. Felt very unwell all day, great pain in back of head, extending towards shoulders and which prevented my sleeping last night.\n\nWednesday 7th January 1885\n\nHad afternoon tea with Miss Douglas, and just before Grace and I paid a visit to Mr Stone in his cabin as he wished to show us what things he had purchased at Colombo, but which consisted only of Tortoise shell manufacture.\n\nSaw a vessel in sight about a mile or so to our West.\n\nWe made 220 miles from last night to 12 today.\n\nIt was so warm last night, as all the scuttles were fastened down, to prevent the sea from being shipped that numbers of the ladies had their beds placed on the ground in the afternoon saloon.\n\nI find I spent exactly £8.4.6 at Colombo viz-\n\nBy Railway to Kandy and back £1.10.0\n\nExpenses incurred at “Qeens Hotel, Kandy £1.2.0\n\nBooks -.10.0\n\nSapphires 10/- Cinnamon Stone £1.10 - £3.4.6\n\nPhotos -.8.4\n\nHire of carriages -.9.-\n\nLunches -.9.6\n\nPostage -.5.6\n\nBoat hire to and fro -.3.0\n\nStick -.1.8\n\nEcectras -.1.0\n\n£8.4.6\n\nPlayed whist in the evening with McConnell, Douglas and Roderick.\n\nThursday 8th January 1885\n\nBeautiful weather, ship going very steadily, sea particularly smooth and very blue. Last night we had all our Port holes open, so I had a comparatively good night and slept well.\n\nThermometer at Xam. Mr Boyle (the Purser’s) cabin 80 degrees. Felt much better today, my headache (which I have never been without) not so severe as usual, and particularly, also much improved.\n\nSaw by the European Mail of 12 December (which McConnell got at Colombo) that the J.B.Watts, Knox’s &c leave England in the P. & O. S. “Parramatte” on the 15th January inst.\n\nMade 306 miles up to today. Heard today that Dr Egan (the ship’s Doctor) had proposed to Miss Douglas, and a conclave of married women were to hold a council today, to report on the desirability of the engagement, or otherwise. He is an Irishman, son of a clergyman, I understand, has a slight brogue, but is looked upon by the ladies as a very handsome young man. He reads the lessons very Sunday, when the Captain officiates and reads the morning service. And old Douglas knows nothing of what is going on!\n\nFriday 9th January 1885\n\nRan 302 miles since yesterday. Thermometer [blank[. At request of Mr Stone, at X o’clock, I read a manuscript Journal, of a fellow passenger of his,(Mr Stone’s) who came out with him to Melbourne by the sailing ship “Sobram[?]” which arrived Melbourne on the 12th December. This person asked Mr Stone to take it back to England and deliver it to his friends there; for this reason and to save him postage, Mr Stone consented to be the bearer of it, provided he left it open, and having also the permission tor read it. Therefore, for the edification of his fellow passengers of the “Ganges” he proposed it being read publicly in the Saloon, which I did. The McConnells, Douglas’, Conrans, Solomons, the Cochrane’s (our new passengers) Rodericks, Miss Burleigh, Miss Sadler, Mr Stone, Mr Caley, Miss Brown, Mr Bray being present. It took me 1 ¼ hours to read it. I am sorry to say it was the most unedifying badly written journal I ever read. Besides being vulgarly expressed [exposed?] in some parts, evidently the man who wrote it is not a gentleman, and only indifferently educated. My audience however, were very attentive whilst it was being read, and thanked me one and all for having done so.\n\nPlayed whist in the evening with Douglas, Roderick and McConnell, the latter my partner throughout. We were the losing players. Raining middle day, in consequence Port Holes on Starboard side closed, ours on the Port Side open all night as well as day. Drank tea with McConnell.\n\nSaturday 10th January 1885\n\nLattitude 10º 23N\n\nLongitude 61º 23 E\n\nRan 290 miles since yesterday.\n\nA fine day, warm but cool breeze. A great swell and headwind, N.E Monsoon. Sea making the steamer roll and pitch, in consequence many of the passengers feeling “very queer,” even young Conran is lolling about the deck on a chair seemingly perfectly enchanted. Also Miss Boodle. Miss McConnell and King all more or less affected.\n\nThermoment 77º and 79º – steering house.\n\nTook Dr Fischer’s medicine No.3\n\nPlayed whist with Douglas, McConnell, and Roderick, the latter my partner and this time we were the winning party.\n\nSunday 11th January 1885\n\nLatitude 11º.03 N\n\nLongitude 56º.18. E\n\nRan 302 miles since yesterday.\n\nAnother fine day, our Ports still open, day and night, being on port side and starboard side having theirs shut.\n\nService at XI, read by the Captain. The choir consisted of Miss McConnell (at the Harmonium) Miss Burleigh, Miss Sadler, Miss Douglas, Miss Brown, Mrs Conran, Mr Cochran, and there were about 30 people present. Mr Stone strange to say rarely attends, he is one of the Plymouth Brethren and though strict in some of his notions, and I believe a very good man, yet does not countenance the Church of England service. The Captain complaining of being unwell at dinner time, cold and feverish, Miss Boodle dosed him with homeopathic mixture/complain. About 20 drops. Eastward bound steamer seen about 8 o’clock pm. Last night, about 9, the engine was stopped as the machinery was getting heated, it was said.\n\nTook Dr Fischer’s Medicine No.3.\n\nMonday 12th January 1885\n\nLovely morning. Early passed the Island of Socotra about 20 miles distant, but plainly visible. The hills are upwards of 4656 feet, that is the highest peak; the island is about 70 miles long by an average of 18 miles wide. The inhabitants a sort of Arab though very friendly. Cattle and sheep are to be found here. About X o’clock we passed another island Abd-al-Kuri; hills here about (the highest) 1537 feet. Distant from Socotra 57 miles, and about 50 miles from the African coast on the Eastward, which was visible. We shall in a few hours or so be entering the Gulf of Aden. The last land seen was Cape Guadafin on the African coast.\n\nThe temperature apparently much cooler today, 78º in steering house. Ran only 278 miles up to today. The young people on board are rehearsing on Hurricane deck, preparatory to acting charades, and Tableaux vivants in a day or two. So Mr Stone, Mr Caley and I who were sitting up there, had to retire, to allow them, the ladies, to be unobserved whilst reciting their parts. Another steamer seen, ahead of us. Awoke with very severe headache, attributable to eating ham yesterday at dinner.\n\nWe expect to reach “Aden” tomorrow night, to coal there, and then proceed on our journey again at X o’clock pm, so that it is questionable if we shall be able to land at all, and see the Tanks which it is said, are worth looking at, on account of their age.\n\nThe Captain did not make his appearance at breakfast though he is better, and sitting on deck, outside his cabin door. I am indebted for the information about “Socrata” and the coast, to the second Officer Mr Davis, who took me into the chart room and showed me the exact position on the charts kept there. By the bye I should mention that he, Mr Davis, has had the good fortune in his day (being and expert swimmer) of saving life, by rescuing at different times, 4 or 5 persons from drowning: the last time in the docks, in London, he had previously received the medal from the Humane Society, and now he has got the clasp, the highest honor that can be given. The “P. & O. Company” in addition, gave him 1 years seniority in the service as a sort of promotion. He is a manly fellow, and like all courageous men, thinks nothing of what he has done, as he puts it all down, as he says, “to his being a good swimmer, and that is all”! I understand that on the 2nd Officer devolves all the duty and responsibility of working and steering the ship her course, taking the observations &c.\n\nIn the afternoon we saw a large steamer ahead of us, about 14 miles away, ahead of us. Supposed to be the “Nepaul.” Later on we met another steamer, something like a collier but we could not distinguish her name or country, and there was no disposition either on her part or that of the “Ganges” to find out by signaling or otherwise. About the same time, to the East of us, a fast sailing large boat with [Lattern?] sails came in view about a mile distant, said to be a slave ship, and called a Dhow. Great shoals of Porpoise, playing about, about 1 mile away, and Mr Cochran informed us that just a little before he had seen a large monster of a fish, the like of which he had never witnessed, having an immense tail, exposed out of the water. We all tried to look at it, but the animal never again showed. Drank tea with Mrs Conran, who had the married people. The Douglas’ (Miss) entertaining the single ones. Played whist till 9.30 with McConnell, Douglas, and Roderick who was my partner again, we lost 4 points tonight. On deck a new sort of Swedish dance was introduced by Mrs Cochran, a sort of country dance to the time of “Sir Roger de Coverley.” After this waltzes, and the Lancers. I was induced to enter in to the fun of the Swedish dance, and also danced with Mrs Conran in the Lancers.\n\nMr Cochran also took another waltz and polka, which was introduced in Sydney year ago as the [Jijo?] Polka.\n\nTaking Dr Fischer’s Medicine No.3\n\nAs we anticipated we entered the Gulf of Aden about 5 o’clock and shortly after lost sight of land. The last land we saw was Cape Quardafrie on the African Coast, to the East.\n\nTuesday 13th January 1885\n\nThe steamer which was ahead of us yesterday evening is now astern of us, she is supposed to be the “Nepaul.” She is 1000 horsepower less than the “Ganges,” and a smaller vessel, besides. Another muggy day, thermometer 79º in the steering room forward.\n\nRan 316 miles since yesterday. The Captain still unwell, was not at breakfast. Nor did he come into the Saloon the whole of yesterday.\n\nI taking Dr Fischer’s remedy No.2. Pulsatilla.\n\nThe Captain made his appearance at Lunch today. I had a warm salt water bath; bathing my head with cold water before and after immersion.\n\nWrote from “Aden,” the following letters.\n\nI, to Milly\n\nGrace, to Marie\n\nGrace to Fanny (a journal letter double)\n\nThe Captain advises that in addressing our letters to New South Wales, we should be careful in adding the word “Australia” upon every one of them, as otherwise the Post Office authorities (being foreigners) might forward them to some other part of the world, which might bear the name of Wales.\n\nAbout 6 o’clock pm, in sight of “Aden,” and at 8 or thereabouts Pilot (Macalister) in his boat (manned by Arab sailors) came on board; we had previously thrown up blue lights, which were duly answered by the firing of a gun. About 8.30 we anchored near Light House or Light ship. The Agent of P&O Company came on board and some of the passengers went on shore in one of the many boats that were lying round us (Douglas and son, McConnell, Conran, Bray, his son and young Loftie) they returned about X after perambulating the place, and buying baskets and feathers. There was, they said, a Concert going on. I understand the 44th Regiment are quartered at this wretched looking place. I sent our letters (to Milly, Fanny and Marie) by the Pilot, not feeling well enough to go on shore. Paid 8d postage on the single ones, and ¼ on double ones to Fanny. Shortly after Pilot left numbers of the native Arabs, came on board to sell Ostrich feathers, they wanted in some instances £4, £3 and £2 for a set of 4 feathers. Some were white, some brown, a few of the ladies beat the sellers down to 15/- and £1, but like the Cingalese with their Gems, it is difficult to say whether the ladies or the Arabs got the best of the bargain. The Captain after they had been an hour or more trying to sell their feathers turned them very unceremoniously off the ship, and indirectly seemed, in loud tones, to censure the Officers and Quarter Master on duty, for letting them come on board. We passed and met several steamers before getting into Aden, and some hours after us, we saw the “Nepaul” whom we had left behind in the afternoon, come in and anchor within sight. Coaling commenced about 10 o’clock pm, which was not so disagreeable a process, as at “Colombo” as the coal was put through the porthole instead of being carried over the deck, begriming and blackening everything near.\n\nTaking “Pulsatilla” Dr Fischer’s remedy No.2\n\nPaid for wine £1, washing 2/8, Postage 2/4 (10/-)\n\nWednesday 14th January 1885\n\nNot much sleep during the night, owing to the noise of putting the coal on board. The process was over by 5 am, when steam was got up and we started again on our travels: Aden, as we left it behind, looked like a huge black cinder of a mountain; we are now commencing to go through the Gulf of this name.\n\nAt X.30am came in sight of the Straits of Babel-el-Maudeh, which are not more than 2 ½ miles in width, from shore to shore, and the mid-channel through which ships are navigated not over a mile! The current too, is very strong, running 7 or 8 miles an hour, but with us. On one side of these Straits, on the East, is Babel Maudeh, which was once taken up and fortified by the French, but which they had to give up being barren and waterless, they purchased it form the Egyptian Government. On the other side, is the Island of Perim, in possession of the British, and on which stands a Light House, and on it also is stationed a few military, an Officer with a Sergeant and 10 privates. At and around “Perim” we saw no less than 3 wrecks. One the ship “Hutton,” a steamer, the first of the Anchor line, which was wrecked 18 months or 2 years ago. There now remains only half of her visible, the stern all gone. A few hundred yards, another vessel lies on the rocks, and which ship was wrecked a very short time ago, namely on Christmas Eve, the Officer on duty could not tell me her name. She is close in shore, and how or why she got into that position it is difficult to guess. Of the third vessel nothing but her masts appear, the hull under water.\n\nThe heat today very great. In coming down the companion steps from the Hurricane deck at 12 o’clock I could not keep my hands on the rails, so hot were they! The Straits we have just passed through are, I understand, what are called the “Smaller or Lesser Straits,” but those on the Westward of “Perim” are much wider and safer. A curious story is related of this “Island of Perim;” some time ago (perhaps years) the Admiral of an English Man-of-War, stationed at Suez, invited the officer of a French Man-of-war to dinner; conversation and wine flowed quickly and merrily when one of the French officers, “let out” the object of the Commander’s mission, ie, that they were about hoisting the Tricolor and going to take possession of the Island. The British commander, overheard the remark, and instantly called one of his officers, and ordered him at once to proceed to “Perim” and to hoist the British Ensign, which was accomplished and caused no little surprise and disappointment to the French on their subsequent arrival; finding they were out-generalled, it was then, it is said, they purchased this country, opposite “Perim” from the Egyptians, as before mentioned.\n\nThe distance from “Aden” to “Perim” is about 95 to 100 miles, and during this run and for some time after, land and high hills devoid of trees, or verdure (though prettily formed) met our gaze. After breakfast, passed, or rather met an outward bound steamer, said to be one of the Orient Line, the “Iberia” for Sydney. Hoisted colors to each other. McConnell obtained last night at “Aden” a Home news of the 26th December, giving the latest English intelligence.\n\nFelt very unwell all day. I begin to question the advisability of taking Saltwater Baths, for I always appear worse the next day. Taking Dr Fischer’s remedy (No. 2 Pulsetilla)\n\nAbout 5.30, towards sunset we came in sight on the Eastward, of the town of Mocha (or as it is spelt on the chart Mokka), built on the sea shore, at the foot of lofty hills; as the rays of the setting sun were reflected right upon it, we saw it to advantage. Through the glass we could distinctly see that it was comparatively a large size town, and three or four tall spires or chimeys overtopping the rest of the buildings were very visible. These spires looked at the distance we were off, (perhaps 20 or 30 miles) like the chimneys of some manufactory. After passing Mocha we met another large steamer going towards Aden. This Mocha was where the celebrated coffee used to be imported from, but of late years this industry ceased and coffee that is grown in these parts come some distance away to [?] of the country.\n\nPlayed whist at 8 o’clock. McConnell, Roderick and Douglas. Roderick and I were partners and afterwards McConnell, but in each game I was on the winning side. Douglas was tired of being always on the losing side, and after 3 or 4 rubbers retired.\n\nI then played at Napoleon for the first time, with Miss Boodle, Miss McConnell, and Miss Burleigh, the latter like myself, a novice at the game.\n\nWent to be at X.30\n\nMade 80 miles today from Aden.\n\nJanuary 15th 1885, Thursday\n\nThe sea (on awaking) as ‘smooth as glass’ and shortly after breakfast (for the first time since entering the Red Sea0 that it was for a time perfect red that is, streams of red came floating, which is to be accounted for by the fact of its colour being produced by sea weed of a reddish hue. Just as we were looking at and considering at it , a large steamer hove in sight, apparently a man of war painted white going towards Aden. The Captain says she is the Gunboat ordered by the Queensland Government. Hoisted our colours, British.\n\nRead the “Tales of Sind,” (published by Thacker) and in which poems appear, versified, the tale about “Perim,” and how possession was obtained by the British of the Island; pretty much the same description as I have given already. Miss King, who has been more or less of an invalid very low and hysterical today, the Captain says, “thinking of her mother.” Passed another steamer about 12, going towards Aden.\n\nMade 268 miles today.\n\nCharades, and tableaux vivants at 8 o’clock tonight – Programme\n\n1st Syllable\n\nMaria – Miss Douglas\n\nJulia – Miss Burleigh\n\nFather – Mr Bray\n\nMan Servant – Douglas jun.\n\nDoctor – Dr Egan Port\n\n2nd Syllable (Man)\n\nAesthetic Sisters – Miss McConnell\n\nDitto – Miss Douglas\n\nDitto – Miss Boodle\n\nDitto – Miss Burleigh\n\nSignorina Mancini – Miss Sadler\n\n3rd Syllable (Toe)\n\nAuthor - Mr Bray\n\nMan Servant – Douglas Jun’\n\nBeggar – Mr Conran\n\nWhole World\n\nJane – Miss Boodle\n\nArabella – Miss Sadler\n\nFelix – Douglas jun’\n\nArthur – Mr Conran\n\nWord “Port-man-teau\n\nTableaux Vivants\n\nSleeping Beauty\n\nCinderella in 4 scenes\n\nGrand Tragic Tableaux\n\nBlue Beard and his wives\n\nBlue Beard - Mr Bray\n\n(with the (serangsturchan?) burrowed for the occasion)\n\nThe acting and the dresses were both admirable, and the dialogue (entirely written by Miss McConnell) was clever and witty. The scene of the “Aesthetic Sisters” was “realistic” in the extreme! And each young lady managed to “get herself up,” to the very highest “pitch of perfection,” each in her own style, looked captivating and bewitching. Miss Boodle with her long hair, let loose over her shoulders, was “simply attractive.” Miss McConnell with her musical voice, and nicely turned head and expressive-speaking eyes, merited a larger if not a World wide stage, to exhibit her histrionic talents upon.\n\nMiss Sadler, full of humour and that naïveté of manner, peculiarly her own!\n\nMiss Douglas (also with her hair down) attracted more eyes “than one!”\n\nMr Bray acted as though “to the manner bread.”\n\nDr Egan “as real as life.”\n\nWhilst Mr Conran was made to look more handsome than ever, in his garb of a “Prince,” the dress evidently arranged and effectively put on, and pinned on, no doubt by the ‘lissome fingers’ of his ‘bright eyed’ wifes!\n\nYoung Douglas astonished the audience by his performance, and did justice to his early Preceptress (The Miss Mallet) who ‘drew him out’ on first arrival on ship board when only “an unsophisticated youth!”\n\nNor must I omit to mention the soulful Rebecca (young –‘s wife) whose first appearance in public, made quite a “page in his --.\n\nAfter the place, our powers of admiration were again called into action, in witnessing the beautiful phospherence of the waters, (as far as the eye could reach) every one declaring that they had never seen it in such magnitude of such perfection before!\n\nThe sea still as smooth as ever, and as we have all our ports open on both sides every probability of a quiet night.\n\n16th January 1885, Friday\n\nJust 5 weeks today since we left Sydney! The sea, rather more disquieted then yesterday and the temperature already cooler. Before breakfast a steamer (one of the French messenger line) seen on her way to Australia. I did not see her myself. Miss Douglas’ birthday, 21 years of age today! Birthday cards placed by some unknown hand on her plate, at breakfast time, and some acrostie lines written by Mr Davis, the 2nd Officer who is a bit of a poet.\n\nRan – miles today\n\nThermometer\n\nSaw after breakfast a steamer going towards Aden, of a very peculiar build, depressed, as it were, in the middle and her two opposite ends exactly similar, and therefore difficult to determine which was the stern or head of the vessel.\n\nReading the Life of the “Princess Alice.” I can’t say it interests me. There are and have been hundreds equally good and affectionable in all relations of life, and not for the adventurous circumstances of her being the daughter of a Queen would have passed away “unknown and unsung.”\n\nAt dinner Champagne and an iced plum cake introduced in honor of Miss Douglas’ birthday, who attained her 21st birthday today.\n\nPlayed whist with Roderick, McConnell, and Douglas; McConnell and Roderick my partners alternately, and I again on the winning side, whilst Douglas always on the losing side. Mrs McConnell and Conran playing Backgammon. Miss McConnell hard at work at “Patience;” Mr Conran writing. Miss Sadler playing; Miss Burleigh writing and reading, the rest on deck.\n\nMiss Douglas and her father had all (or nearly all) the passengers at tea in afternoon, except Mr and Mrs Rigby and Miss Robinson, who had tea by themselves in after saloon. They appear to keep by and to themselves. He Rigby, looks like a retired Innkeeper who was perhaps his own best customer. There is an evident desire on the part of the passengers to keep them at a distance.\n\n17th January 1885, Saturday\n\nA lovely day, the air fresh and invigorating. Saw a steamer shortly after breakfast going ‘Aden-wards’ and another one after lunch, a P&O Steamer , it was said to be the “Ancona” for Calcutta. About the same time land visible to the North Westward, on the Egyptian Coast, about 79 miles distant and called “Jable-Madi-la-Hamah.” The hills very distinct. We expect to see Dedalus Light house about dinner time. Ran 266 miles today, we are not hurrying, as the Captain does not wish to get in to ‘Suez’ before Monday morning.\n\nThe McConnells and Miss Brown and Miss Boodle busily engaged re-packing their trunks, to be in readiness to land at Suez, Monday. Mr Cockran exhibited 2 cases of Butterflies he got at Kandy, Ceylon, for which he paid only £1 and the skin of a Boa Constrictor, 10 feet 11 inches, for which he gave (blank).\n\nThermometer 72°\n\nGave McConnell, at his request, a copy of my journal with account of the Charades and Tableaux vivants, which seemed to amuse him. Just as the Captain has stated, we came in sight of the Dadalus Light house, built on a shoal, as the dinner bell rang at 6 o’clock, the sun just setting. It was a most lovely sight, magnificent sunset, of a deep orange and crimson hue, and which sort of colour I never saw before, except in pictures representing Egyptian scenes. The light house stands as it were by itself, in advance of the line of hills named “Jabel-Mada-la-hamah” on the Nubian coast. The light house is supervised by the English, and two men formerly Quarter Masters in the P&O Service remain constantly resident, a third man remaining ashore and relieving one of the two every three months. The weather is now perfect, the sea smooth and all our portholes on both sides open.\n\n18th January 1885, Sunday\n\nLovely weather, land visible on all sides. At 7 o’clock passed a steamer outward bound on our Portside, to the eastward, at 9.30, whilst at breakfast, great commotion on board arose, as it was announced that the P& O S. “Assam” bound to Bombay, was close to us; this being the ship on which Miss Brown’s brother (and Miss Boodle’s intended) is Chief Officer; every one nearly, made a rush to the side to see if he could be discerned. Rather a disappointment for Miss Boodle to be so near and not either of them to have the opportunity of meeting, or exchanging a word with each other! After breakfast, on going on deck saw two more steamers outward bound, one was a Dutch Ship, who hoisted her colours, going to Batavia. The other the “Knight of St. Patrick.” Also outward bound. Shortly after another large steamer, passed us, the “Duke of Buccleigh,” with Emigrants for Queensland, apparently a great number on board, and the poop crowded with women. On the East, the Coast of Sinai, now appeared with its well defined line of lofty hills, amongst which we looked for in vain, the “Mount Sinai” but no one could fix upon the exact locality, instead the Captain seemed to think it was not so lofty a mountain as the Range that met our view, and that it lay much further back. On our West was the Solante of Schianda, a perfectly barren rock, without a morsel of verdure, but notwithstanding as the sun shone brightly upon it, was a most picturesque object, particularly as the indentations and irregularity formed outlines gave it a rather imposing character.\n\nDuring the night, or rather about 3am, we passed the Island “The Brother” lying mid channel and at 5.30 saw Ras Charib Light house on the West, and on the East, the same range of hills, on the Sinai Coast, the highest of which is the surprise of all (even the Captain) one capped with snow, and which gave to the air a coolness not before felt. This range of hills must be very lofty, for “Mt Sinai” is marked on the chart as being 7450 feet high.\n\nAfter lunch came in sight of the Light house called (Ashrip?) 140 feet, built of iron.\n\nPassed the afternoon in Dr Davis’ cabin, the 2nd Officers and with him also Mr Chichester, the 3rd Officer).\n\nSaw the new moon just as we went to dinner at 6 o’clock, the wind changing just at this time, and blowing strongly Southerly.\n\nThe Doctor (Egan) read prayers in place of Captain, Miss McConnell (on the Harmonium) and Miss Benleigh, Mrs Sadler, Miss Douglas, Miss Soloman, Miss Brown and Mr Conran forming the choir, about 30 person being the congregation, of a collection in aid of the Seaman’s fund made, Plate carried round by Mr Bray, and £5.10 collected.\n\nThe Doctor ordered me a hot mutton chop for lunch every day.\n\nRan 260 miles today. Thermometer 72.°\n\nFelt very unwell all day, particularly in afternoon. I had (yesterday and this morning been taking Dr Fischer’s medicine No.4, for functionary and prostration, changed it and have been taking No.3, “The main remedy.”\n\n18th January 1885, Monday\n\nAbout 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning came to anchor at Suez, very great change in Atmosphere from heat to cold. Thermometer only 64. Shortly after we arrived the P&O Nepaul (which left Colombo a few hours before we sailed) came in and anchored near us, previously to her coming in saw a Russian Man of War get under weigh, she had just come through the canal. After breakfast the McConnells, Miss Brown and Miss Boodle, also young Loftice, left in an open sail boat for “Suez” en route to Cairo.\n\nGot a Home News of 9th January 1885.\n\nThe Douglas’, Conran, and Bray also accompanied them, intending to return by 1 o’clock. Suez is only a short distance away, quite visible, but owing to the shoal lying between it and the ship, the boats have to go round a long way and so increase the distance thereby. Saw several ships, as we lay at anchor, coming out of the Canal, in fact we could not enter until they had all come out, one a large Man of War, painted white, an iron clad turret ship of 8,000 tons, which anchored near us, H.M.S. Agamemnon, bond to China, to protect British interests during the French and Chinese disputes. A Spaniard came on board with photographs, I purchased 6/- worth.\n\nMr Stone purchased 12 doz or more, for which the Spaniard tells me he only gave £4, and that he had received 15 dozen and that he was a great loser, so much so that he offered Mr Stone to give him back his £4 if he would let him have his photographs back again, which he refused to do. I cannot understand this as Mr Stone appears a man of extreme rectitude. Saw 8 or 9 ships besides the ‘Agamemnon’ coming through the Canal, two of them were French Men of War, also bound to China.\n\nSome time after lunch the sailing boat returned with the Ganges passengers who had left in the morning in the arab boat, namely Conran, Bray, the Douglas’, Mr and Mrs Rigney and baby, Miss Robinson and Miss Soloman. As the sea and the wind had risen since morning they had rather a wet and rough sail back, but the Arabs managed their boats cleverly in bringing alongside the ship. The Captain had previously sent a Steam Launch to pick them up at “Suez,” but as she returned without them, the Captain seemed put out at the possibility of being detained by their delay. However they came back in very good time, for the Pilot (a foreigner) did not take charge of our ship till 4 o’clock p.m., and we did not enter the Canal till 4.30. The passengers who went to Suez, though they managed to get donkeys to ride, could not get any thing to eat, and returned to the ship very hungry. Mrs Rigney had, I understand, a fall from her donkey.\n\nThe Reverend Mr Strange who has been stationed between Port Said and Suez for the last 2 ½ years in his clerical capacity, came on board in order to return to his home at Port Said, and he is a gentlemany pleasant and – young man.\n\nI felt very unwell all night, great pains in back of neck, extending to right shoulder, with twitch in joints, fingers and toes, and altogether ill, otherwise, I should have felt inclined to go on shore at Suez. At 5.30 the “Ganges” was brought to a stand still and made fast to posts fixed on the ground on one side of Canal about 7 miles from Suez. No ships go faster than 4 or 5 miles an hour and are not allowed to travel after dark\n\n19th January 1885, Tuesday\n\nIn bed nearly all day, with a most excruciating head ache, or rather pains in nape of neck extending to left shoulder, throbbing on top of head, side of head and forehead, in fact pain charging from one spot to the other that not diminishing in force or acuteness: all day long, this continued, the glands of the neck on both sides appear considerably swollen. Took “Pulsatilla” 3 times during the day, and towards 8 o’clock pm, I felt somewhat relieved and got up for a couple of hours, though having a very bruised sensation about the neck and head and a slight feeling of nausea.\n\nWe left our mooring this morning about 6 o’clock, we had barely come last evening, about 7 miles from Suez. In the course of the day, I saw through my Port Hole, the Steamer “Essez” which we passed as she lay fastened to her moorings; shortly after we met the Dutch ship “Prince Henrico” of Amsterdam on boar of which appeared many passengers of a very pleasing type of face. Shortly after another passenger ship, the “Clan Cameron” of Glasgow. There were many others I understand but being in my bed they escaped my notice. There was also seen in the distance the Palace built for the Khedive at (blank) and also the house for the Empress Eugenie when she came to these parts for the purpose of inaugurating the opening of the Suez Canal.\n\nAbout 5.30 pm just as the light was disappearing, we came again to an anchor or rather the ship was moored by cables fastened to posts fixed deeply into the banks on shore.\n\nWe passed several stations and saw several half lame young Egyptians running along the banks of the Canal begging for money. Some one on board threw them a penny, which had been inserted in a potatoe, to facilitate the throwing it, but on reaching the land, the penny must have slipped out, and the indignation of the little Egyptians on finding that there was nothing in it, was great in the extreme, venting his passion by beating himself with his hat, or head dress, and not any of them wear anything but a sort of huge looking night cap on their heads, and something like a monk’s cowl. The scenery (or rather there is no scenery) is dreary in the extreme. Steaming between sand banks, the whole live long day, and wondering how it is that the Canal has not long since been filled up by the drift sand caused by natural gravitation as well as by wind against the possibility of which no safeguards appear to the casual observer to have been taken. The Purser (Mr Boyle) informed me of the great and sudden change of tempuratures the last few days (the day before yesterday) the Thermometer in the cabin then was 84°, and to night only 60°, a difference of 24 degrees!\n\n20th January 1885, Wednesday\n\nWe left our ‘moorings’ (a few miles beyond Kantara) about 6 o’clock a.m., the first ship we met today in the Canal outward bound was the “Winchester” and shortly after the P&O Steamer “Chusan” bound for Bombay, and in her the Duke of Connaught, the Captain says, is expected to return to England. She is a new ship with all the modern improvements, having electric lights &c. Apparently a great number of nice looking passengers in her. And from the conversation that passed between our Captain and theirs, we learn that she had met with very severe and cold weather since leaving England. Not very cheery news for us just entering it. Another vessel we met was the (blank).\n\nOn going on deck after breakfast three strange lights met our view, first the ‘mirage’ of land and water being apparently visible, next the thousands and thousands of Flamingos which at a distance looks like large regiments of soldiers, clad in white and extended in single file. And lastly numbers of tufts of (which looked like) grass with sticks rising out of them, and placed in straight lines one after the other, the Captain asked us all to guess what we thought them to be, but of course no one was able to answer; according to the Captain they are placed there by the Egyptians for the purpose of catching Quail, as after a long flight they get weary on the wing, and are thus attracted by these artificial mounds of grass and rest there, at night time the natives go out with nets in their hands and easily capture them, whilst comfortably ensconced in their nests.\n\nAbout 7 o’clock a.m. we passed a building on the banks of the Canal, which we saw was an ‘Hotel’ kept by a Frenchman ‘De Conti,’ by name, and at about 8, to a large dredging machine, somewhere in this neighbourhood tradition assigns the place where Joseph was sold by his brothers.\n\nI understand that the Canal duties are very excessive, this ship the ‘Ganges’ (of 4,000 tons) will have to pay £1,400 and for each passenger the pay at the rate of 11/- per head, but this is inclusive of the £1,400. The English Man of War, the “Agamemnon” with her large complement of man, of 8,000 tonnage, must have had a very large Bill to pay I imagine, by the bye I hear she had, owing to her size, great difficulty coming through the Canal, it took her six days and as her beam was upwards of 68 feet and the width of the Canal only a few feet wider the risk was great, so great indeed that I understand the Commander does not intend his return to go through the Canal.\n\nArrived at Port Said at 11.30 followed shortly after by our companion de voyage the ‘Nepaul.’ Alongside of us lay a Russian Man of War, two Frenchmen, and one Turkish Man of War ahead of us. Immediately we anchored (boats?) with Egyptian labourers came alongside and commenced loading us with coal. We had lunch at 1, and then several of the passengers, the Douglas’ Conrans, Brays, Solomans and ourselves were taken to the shore only a few hundred yards off, in a ferry boat, for which 3d each was charged. Mr Caley asked if he might accompany us and made up our party. We saw Conran with young Bray and little Roddick riding donkeys about the town. I purchased a Fez cap from one of the shops for 3/- and a (horchel, parcel?) for 2/-. We were surrounded by Egyptian lads who insisted on cleaning my boots, one of them seized one leg and the other the other leg and I had to give them 1d each before I was released. We walked through the different streets, what they called the ‘fruit market.’ The oranges are said to be very good and of an oval shape. W"
