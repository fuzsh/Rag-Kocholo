        "text": "JULY 1, 1886.] THE AFRICAN TIMES. 103.\n\nTHE COLONIAL AND INDIAN EXHIBITION.\n\nCHANCERY OF THE ORDER OF S. MICHAEL AND S. GEORGE, DOWNING STREET, JUNE 28, 1886.\n\nThe Queen has been pleased to give directions for the preparation of a Special Statute of her Most Distinguished Order of S. Michael and S. George, to provide for the admission into the said Order, without permanently increasing the total number of the ordinary members thereof, of such persons as have rendered special and important services in connexion with the Exhibition of the Products, Manufactures, and Arts of her Colonial and Indian Dominions now being held in London, and to ordain that all persons upon whom Her Majesty may think fit to confer the honour of being admitted into the said Most Distinguished Order on account of such special services shall be Additional Members, but with rank and place in their respective classes among the Ordinary Members thereof, according to the dates of their appointment; and that the Statutes of the said Most Distinguished Order shall in all matters and things apply in the same manner to the Additional Members as to the Ordinary Members of the said Most Distinguished Order.\n\nHer Majesty has also been pleased (on the recommendation of the Prince of Wales, as President of the Royal Commission for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886) to give directions for the following appointments to, and promotions in, the said Most Distinguished Order, in recognition of services rendered in connexion with the aforesaid Exhibition:—\n\nTo be Additional Members of the Second Class, or Knights Commanders of the said Most Distinguished Order: Sir Samuel Davenport, Knt., Assistant Executive Commissioner for South Australia; Francis Knollys, Esq., C.B., for special services in connexion with the Colonial and Indian Exhibition; Arthur N. Birch, Esq., C.M.G., formerly Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary of Ceylon, Executive Commissioner for that Colony; Arthur Hodgson, Esq., C.M.G., a Royal Commissioner and General Secretary to the Reception Committee; John Francis Julius Von Haast, Esq., Ph.D., C.M.G., Commissioner in charge of New Zealand Exhibits; Augustus John Adderley, Esq., C.M.G., late Member of the Legislative Council of the Bahama Islands, a Royal Commissioner, also Executive Commissioner for the West Indian Islands; James Francis Garrick, Esq., C.M.G., a Member of the Executive Council of Queensland, Agent-General for the Colony in London, and a Royal Commissioner, also Executive Commissioner for the Colony; Graham Berry, Esq., formerly Premier of Victoria, Agent-General in London, and Executive Commissioner for the Colony.\n\nTo be Additional Members of the Third Class, or Companions of the said Most Distinguished Order: Sir James Marshall, Knt., Executive Commissioner for the West African Colonies; Hector Fabre, Esq., late Senator of the Dominion of Canada, Honorary Commissioner for the Dominion; Joseph Bosisto, Esq., Member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, President of the Victorian Commission; Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn, Esq., LL.D., Director of the Canadian Geological and Natural History Survey, and Assistant to the Canadian Commissioners; George Hammond Hawtayne, Esq., Administrator General of British Guiana, Executive Commissioner for that Colony; Henry Ernest Wodehouse, Esq., Special Commissioner for Hong-Kong; Henry John Jourdain, Esq., Honorary Commissioner for Mauritius; Edward Cunliffe-Owen, Esq., Assistant Secretary to the Royal Commissioners; Arthur James Rickens Trendell, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, Assistant in Catalogue Department and Compiler of the Handbook.\n\nOUR WEST AFRICAN FRIENDS IN LONDON.\n\nWe are pleased to see that in the great Colonial gathering, drawn from all parts of the British Empire, the natives of West Africa are well represented. Among the visitors from Lagos are Mr. and Mrs. Payne, who arrived in London, via the Brazils, early in June; Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Thomas and Miss Thomas; and Mr. N. T. B. Shepherd. These latter, indeed, though in England, have not come to London direct, but will be in the metropolis shortly.\n\nBy command of the Queen, a Levée was held in the afternoon of Friday, the 25th June, at St. James's Palace, by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, on behalf of Her Majesty. Presentations to His Royal Highness were, by the Queen's pleasure, considered as equivalent to presentations to Her Majesty in person. Among the presentations made on this occasion, we find the names of Mr. J. A. Payne, the Registrar of the Supreme Court, Lagos, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.\n\nAt the grand Colonial Reception and Ball given by the Lord Mayor and Corporation of London, on the night of the 25th June at Guildhall, Mr. and Mrs. Payne were among the guests who had the honour of being invited, numbering altogether over 4,500, many of whom were Colonial and Indian visitors. They were received in the Reception Hall by the Lord Mayor who kindly shook hands with our distinguished guests and welcomed them in the name of the Corporation. The Daily Chronicle, in its descriptive account of the proceedings, says: \"Distinct from the Colonists, the swarthy native Indians, of course, challenged recognition by their picturesque Eastern dress; and a remarkable couple also were a dark coloured lady and gentleman of true African type, the former wearing a black satin dress with red roses, and the latter a uniform of some kind.\" (Mr. Payne wore Levée dress.)\n\nMr. Payne, with other Colonists, had the honour of being invited by the Lord Mayor to meet H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, K.G., Executive President of the Royal Commission of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, at dinner, on Tuesday, the 29th June, at the Mansion House, at 7.30 p.m. There were about 450 present at the table, and as they entered the waiting-room the Lord Mayor received them and shook hands. Levée dress was worn on this great occasion. After dinner, before the Prince of Wales left the Hall, His Royal Highness graciously shook hands with several of the Colonists, including our African guests.\n\nMr. Payne also had the honour of invitations from Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., and Lady Marshall, at Richmond House; Sir Thomas and Lady Brassey, at Normanhurst Court, Battle, near Hastings; from the Duke of Bedford, at Woburn Abbey; from the Worshipful Master, Bro. Sir Philip Cuncliffe Owen, K.C.M.G., the Wardens and Brethren of the Empire Lodge of Ancient Freemasons, at the Criterion, Piccadilly; from General and Mrs. Beynon, at Ashburn Place; from the Rev. F. E. and Mrs. Wigram, at Oak Hill House, Hampstead; from His Grace the Duke of Sutherland, K.G., at Stafford House; and from the Bishop of London and Mrs. Temple, at Fulham Palace. He also had the honour of going into the Houses of Parliament to hear the great orators of England, through the kindness of Sir John Kennaway, Bart., M.P. Mr. Payne was also introduced to the Committee of the C.M.S. at Salisbury Square, and to the Committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society at the Bible House, and had audiences of them respectively. We doubt not that our African friends are much pleased with their reception in England.\n\nTransvaal Mining News.\n\nThe Pilgrim's Rest Correspondent of the Natal Advertiser writes: \"The Transvaal Gold Mining Company are busy carting ore to Brown's Hill battery. They continue driving in the slate on the reef. At the junction of the granite formation with slate the reef pinched out. The vein is unquestionably a 'true fissure,' as it occurs in a rent in the horizontal slate which is peculiar to the district. From what I have seen of the ore, I do not think too highly of it, but appearances may lie. Anyway, the average small prospects one gets do not justify the belief of the ore running an ounce to the ton. Mr. Geo. Hudson, the late British Resident, has taken up his quarters near, and is watching the hydrauliciking on behalf of his Cape friends and himself. The accounts are very unsatisfactory. Graskop No. 3 have oceans of water, and yet they are not hydrauliciking, but ground sluicing, under Mr. Hamilton's management. Mr. Alprovitch, the manager of the Balkis Company, has tendered his resignation, and leaves for England soon. The company are deeply indebted to him, and he cannot get his money. The Lisbon-Berlyn Company are not likely to commence work again for some time owing to pending litigation. The shaft which the Barrett's-Berlin Company sank for the reef failed to find it, and they covered it up again. Colonial shareholders must be very guarded in buying such stock for investment. A few ounces of gold seem to turn them all crazy. I have seen all the gold discoveries which have been made of late, and Barrett's among them, and I would not hold any scrip in a company with capital of more than £50,000 on any of them, however good the reef may be. I think the owners should show their faith by having a small capital and benefiting by the results, which, if good, will always command a handsome premium for the stock.\"\n\nThe Congo Executive.\n\nWe learn from Brussels that \"the station of M. Janssen, Administrator-General of the Congo State, and his staff has been definitively transferred from Vivi to Boma.\"\n\nAfrican Direct Telegraph Company.\n\nThe opening of a station at Bathurst, Gambia, on the West Coast of Africa is announced with a direct service of submarine cables from England via St. Vincent."
