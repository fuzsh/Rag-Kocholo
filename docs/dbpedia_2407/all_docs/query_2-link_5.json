        "text": "Government representative of certain Commonwealth countries in the UK\n\nThis article is about the quasi-diplomatic post. For the clerical representatives in the Kingdom of France, see Agent-General of the French Clergy. For the official overseeing emigration from Britain (1837–1840), see Agent General for Emigration.\n\nAn agent-general is the representative in cities abroad of the government of a Canadian province or an Australian state and, historically, also of a British colony in Jamaica, Nigeria, Canada, Malta, South Africa, Australia or New Zealand and subsequently, of a Nigerian region. Australia's and Canada's federal governments are represented by high commissions, as are all Commonwealth national governments today.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, a growing number of British colonies appointed agents in Great Britain and Ireland and occasionally elsewhere in Europe to promote immigration to the colonies. Eventually, agents-general were appointed by some colonies to represent their commercial, legal, and diplomatic interests in Britain and to the British government and Whitehall.[1] They were appointed, and their expenses and salaries provided, by the governments of the colonies they represented.[2]\n\nStarting in 1886, Quebec and the federal Canadian government also appointed agents-general to Paris. The first, Hector Fabre, was dispatched by the province of Quebec but was asked by the federal government to represent all of Canada. He and his successor, Philippe Roy, continued to represent both Quebec City and Ottawa in France until 1912 when the federal government asked Roy to resign his Quebec position to avoid conflicts of interest. Canadian provinces have also appointed agents-general (called delegates-general by Quebec beginning in the 1970s) to other countries and major cities.\n\nFollowing a military coup in Nigeria in 1966, the federal system was abolished, and the posts of the agents-general of Nigerian regions in London were subsumed in the Nigerian High Commission.\n\nBy the 1990s, some Australian state governments regarded the office of their agent-general in London as a costly anachronism, even for promoting tourism and investment, and have since been closed and subsumed into the Australian High Commission. The majority of Australian states continue to have agents-general in London, but operate from Australia House rather than maintain separate premises.\n\nMany Canadian provinces similarly are no longer represented by an agent-general, although Quebec continues to have a Government Office in London (Délégation générale du Québec à Londres) and in several other cities around the world. Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have representatives who work out of the Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC.[3]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nAgents-general for New South Wales\n\n[edit]\n\nAgents-general for Queensland\n\n[edit]\n\nAgent-general Years John Douglas 1869–1870 Archibald Archer 1870–1872 Richard Daintree 1872–1876 Arthur Macalister 1876–1881 Thomas Archer 1881–1885 William Hemmant (acting) 1885–1885 Sir James Garrick 1885–1888 Thomas Archer 1888–1890 Sir James Garrick 1890–1895 Charles Shortt Dicken (acting)[13] 2 October 1895 – 31 October 1895 Sir Thomas McIlwraith (acting)[14] 31 October 1895 – 25 November 1896 Sir Henry Wylie Norman[15][16] 1896–1897 Charles Shortt Dicken (acting) 29 December 1897 – 1898 Sir Horace Tozer 2 March 1898 – 1909 Thomas Bilbe Robinson 1910–1919 John McEwan Hunter 1 January 1920 – 1922 John Arthur Fihelly 8 February 1922–1924 John Huxham 1 August 1924 – 31 July 1929[17] Edward Henry Macartney 1 August 1929 – 14 August 1931 Leonard Henry Pike 14 August 1931 – 30 September 1951 Sir David Muir 3 October 1951 – 9 January 1964 Sir William Summerville 1 April 1964 – 1970 Sir Peter Delamothe 1971–1973 N.

In 1936, legislation was passed by the government of Maurice Duplessis closing all Quebec government offices abroad. The government of Adélard Godbout repealed the legislation and opened an office in New York City in 1940. When Duplessis returned to power in 1944, his government retained the New York City office and its agent-general but opened no others. In the early 1960s, the government of Jean Lesage began to open additional offices abroad appointing in Paris (1961), London (1962), Rome and Milan (1965) and subsequent governments opened offices in Chicago (1969), Boston, Lafayette, Dallas and Los Angeles (1970), Munich and Berlin (1971), Brussels (1972), Atlanta (1977), Washington (1978), Mexico City and Tokyo (1980), Beijing and Santiago (1998), Shanghai and Barcelona (1999), Mumbai (2007), São Paulo (2008) and Moscow (2012).[37] In 1971, the title of agent-general was officially changed to delegate-general although previous title is still often used, particularly for the government's representative to London.\n\nAs of 2024 , the Government of Quebec has 35 offices abroad, including 9 delegates-general.[38]\n\nto the United Kingdom\n\nJean-Marie-Joseph-Pantaléon Pelletier (1911–1924)[39][40]\n\nLouis-Joseph Lemieux (1925–1936)[41]\n\nvacant (1936–1961)\n\nHugues Lapointe (1961–1966)[42]\n\nGuy Roberge (1966–1971)[43]\n\nJean Fournier (1971–1977)[43]\n\nGilles Loiselle (1977–1983)[44]\n\nPatrick Hyndman (1983–1987)[45]\n\nReed Scowen (1987–1992)\n\nHarold Mailhot (1992–1995)\n\nRichard Guay (1995–2000)\n\nDaniel Audet (2000–2003)\n\nGeorge R.
