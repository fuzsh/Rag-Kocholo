        "text": "On Monday night, Swedish pole vaulter Armand “Mondo” Duplantis set a new world record and won an Olympic gold medal. Both of these achievements could be considered the pinnacle of any athlete’s career, yet with Duplantis, it feels like the opening chapters of what will undoubtedly be a long and illustrious biography. Watch fans worldwide may have noticed a UHO (unidentified horological object) on his wrist. But it wasn’t the usual Zoop or Garmin that you might expect an athlete to wear. The watch on Mondo’s wrist was a new special edition Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 150m Titanium. There was no e-mail, no announcement, and no press release. It’s a rather bold way to launch a new watch. Still, with the world captivated by the Olympic Games and an ambassador like Duplantis in your arsenal, you can’t blame Omega for doing so in this way.\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment. The Stade de France collectively held its breath as Duplantis, having already secured gold, had the bar set 15cm higher for three attempts at breaking the standing world record (which he set earlier this year). After two failed attempts, the pressure was on. At that point, no other event was taking place in the stadium. All 80,000 spectator’s eyes were firmly set on him. Among them was Noah Lyle, who had just received his gold medal for the men’s 100m sprint, which he won with a Speedmaster Dark Side Of The Moon Apollo 8 on his wrist. As you know by now, Mondo’s third attempt was successful and sporting history was made.\n\nBreaking records with a titanium Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 150m Ultra Light on the wrist\n\nAs remarkable an athlete as the 24-year-old Swede may be, we’re here today to talk about the watch on his wrist. Since Monday’s first sighting, we now know that it is, in fact, a new version of the titanium Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 150m Ultra Light. The AT Ultra Light was first released in 2019 in three colorways. Omega describes it as “the ultimate athlete’s watch.” It features a blasted Gamma Titanium case (41 × 13.5 × 49.2mm) and weighs just 55 grams. This particular alloy, often used in the aerospace industry, is lighter and stronger than the standard grades of titanium.\n\nIts bezel is ceramic, and its dial comprises grade-five titanium engraved with the AT’s signature teak deck pattern. As its name indicates, the watch has a water resistance rating of 150m. Its screw-down crown (decorated with a yellow Omega logo) nestles nicely into its flowing crown guard, barely protruding from the case.\n\nOmega’s Master Chronometer certified caliber 8928 Ti powers the Seamaster Aqua Terra 150m Ultra Light. It’s a hand-winding movement with 72 hours of power reserve. This was the brand’s first titanium caliber and is no less impressive five years after its introduction. It’s a great-looking movement, so I’m not surprised that Omega made it visible through the sapphire case back window.\n\nMondo’s watch is a special edition of the standard Ultra Light. The watch proudly wears the blue and gold colors of Sweden. It features a blue dial, blue end links, and a bright yellow textile strap. The same vaulting pole seconds hand we know from Duplantis’ special edition Aqua Terra 150 released earlier this year also makes a comeback.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe Seamaster Aqua Terra 150m Ultra Light Mondo Duplantis Edition (ref. 220.92.41.21.03.002) has a price tag of €56,900. It may come as a surprise for those unfamiliar with the model and its price. But what’s more surprising is that this is €2,300 less than the standard model. Our guess is that it’s due to the difference in the strap included (or rather the one not included). The standard model (ref. 220.92.41.21.06.001) comes on a rubber strap with a titanium clasp and a lightweight “sports strap.” This latest model features only the latter. This signature Seamaster comes in a zippered case signed with the name of the man who made Olympic pole vaulting history earlier this week with this very watch on his wrist.\n\nIf you’ve been tuning in to the Olympic Games, you’ll have noticed that Mondo Duplantis was not the only athlete with an Omega on his wrist. Keep your eyes on the site, as we’ll bring you an overview of other Omega-wearing athletes and their remarkable achievements. But for now, we’d love to hear from you: what do you think of this latest release from Omega? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below."
