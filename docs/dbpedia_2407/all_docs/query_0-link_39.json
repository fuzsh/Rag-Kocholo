        "text": "Space Radar Image of Canberra, Australia\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nAustralia's capital city, Canberra, is shown in the center of this spaceborne radar image. Images like this can help urban planners assess land use patterns. Heavily developed areas appear in bright patchwork patterns of orange, yellow and blue. Dense vegetation appears bright green, while cleared areas appear in dark blue or black. Located in southeastern Australia, the site of Canberra was selected as the capital in 1901 as a geographic compromise between Sydney and Melbourne. Design and construction of the city began in 1908 under the supervision of American architect Walter Burley-Griffin. Lake Burley-Griffin is located above and to the left of the center of the image. The bright pink area is the Parliament House. The city streets, lined with government buildings, radiate like spokes from the Parliament House. The bright purple cross in the lower left corner of the image is a reflection from one of the large dish-shaped radio antennas at the Tidbinbilla, Canberra Deep Space Network Communication Complex, operated jointly by NASA and the Australian Space Office. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) on April 10, 1994, onboard the space shuttle Endeavour. The image is 28 kilometers by 25 kilometers (17 miles by 15 miles) and is centered at 35.35 degrees south latitude, 149.17 degrees east longitude. North is toward the upper left. The colors are assigned to different radar frequencies and polarizations as follows: red is L-band, horizontally transmitted and received; green is L-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received; and blue is C-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian, and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth.\n\nSerratia sp. bacteremia in Canberra, Australia: a population-based study over 10 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nEngel, H J; Collignon, P J; Whiting, P T; Kennedy, K J\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThe purpose of this paper was to determine the population incidence and clinical features of Serratia sp. bacteremia in Canberra, Australia. Demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively for episodes of Serratia sp. bacteremia over a 10-year period, and was confined to Canberra residents using residential postal codes. Thirty-eight episodes of Serratia sp. bacteremia occurred, with a yearly incidence of 1.03 per 100,000 population. The majority of episodes occurred in males (68%). The respiratory tract was the most common focus of infection (21%). Twenty-nine percent of episodes were community-associated. A further 18% of episodes had their onset in the community but were healthcare-associated. The 7-day and 6-month mortality rates were 5 and 37%, respectively. Antibiotic resistance to gentamicin (3%) and ciprofloxacin (0%) was low. Serratia sp. bacteremia is more common than generally appreciated, with a large proportion (47%) of episodes having their onset in the community.\n\nThe evaluation of a trial of syringe vending machines in Canberra, Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcDonald, David\n\n2009-07-01\n\nSyringe vending machines (SVMs) have been trialled in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia, as an intervention aiming to increase the availability of sterile injecting equipment for use by IDUs. This study evaluated the 12-month trial. A utilisation-focused evaluation model, with both formative and summative components, was employed. Four SVMs were installed, each dispensing packs containing four 1 mL syringes and associated injecting paraphernalia. The trial participants were the clients of the SVMs and other key informants. The core measurements used were the number of syringes dispensed in Canberra by SVMs and other outlets, SVM clients' demographics and experiences of and attitudes towards SVMs, perceived impacts of SVMs on needle sharing, unsafe disposal of used syringes in the vicinity of SVMs, and community and stakeholder attitudes. The trial was implemented successfully, with no adverse consequences identified. The SVMs appear to be serving both the usual clients of the other outlets for sterile injecting equipment (community pharmacies and the Needle Syringe Program outlets) and others who are reluctant to use such outlets or find them inconvenient. The out-of-business-hours provision of syringes through the SVMs was particularly welcomed by both SVM clients and other stakeholders. The continuing operation of the initial four SVMs is widely supported, and additional machines are requested by clients and others. Owing to the success of the trial in terms of feasibility and outcomes for both IDUs and for the broader community, it is desirable that providing sterile injecting equipment through SVMs continues and be expanded as an integral component of harm reduction strategies.\n\nBeyond Aspirations: Addressing the Unique Barriers Faced by Rural Australian Students Contemplating University\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFleming, Michele J.; Grace, Diana M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCentral to the widening participation agenda in Australia is a focus on rural and regional students given their continued underrepresentation in higher education.

However, the two-way interactions between fire behaviour and the atmospheric conditions are not well understood. A numerical model is used to simulate wildland fires so that the nature of these fire-atmosphere interactions, and how they might affect fire behaviour, can be further investigated. The 2003 Canberra bushfires are used as a case study due to their highly destructive and unusual behaviour. On the 18th January 2003, these fires spread to the urban suburbs of Canberra, resulting in the loss of four lives and the destruction of over 500 homes. Fire-atmosphere interactions are believed to have played an important role in making these fires so destructive. WRF-Fire is used to perform real data simulations of the 2003 Canberra bushfires. WRF-Fire is a coupled fire-atmosphere model, which combines a semi-empirical fire spread model with an atmospheric model, allowing it to directly simulate the two-way interactions between a fire and its surrounding atmosphere. These simulations show the impact of the presence of a fire on conditions within the atmospheric boundary layer. This modification of the atmosphere, resulting from the injection of heat and moisture released by the fire, appears to have a direct feedback onto the overall fire behaviour. The bushfire simulations presented in this paper provide important scientific insights into the nature of fire-atmosphere interactions for a real situation. It is expected that they will also help fire managers in Australia to better understand why the 2003 Canberra bushfires were so destructive, as well as to gain improved insight into bushfire behaviour in general.\n\nThe work of forensic physicians with police detainees in the Canberra City Watchhouse.\n\nPubMed\n\nSturgiss, Elizabeth Ann; Parekh, Vanita\n\n2011-02-01\n\nForensic physicians provide both medical care and forensic consultations to detainees in police custody. There is a paucity of Australian data regarding characteristics of detainees and the type of work provided by forensic physicians in this setting. This retrospective audit of a clinical forensic service in Canberra, Australia will assist with service planning, future data collection and the training of forensic physicians.

R.\n\nOn May 14-15, 1985, 63 discerning geomagnetists flocked to Canberra to attend the Geomagnetic Workshop coorganized by the Australian Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) and the Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University (ANU). With an aurorally glowing cast that included an International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) president, former president, and division chairman, the Oriental Magneto-Banquet (which was the center of the meeting), was assured of success. As a cunning ploy to mask the true nature of this gastronomic extravagance from the probings of income tax departments, a presentation of scientific papers on Australian geomagnetism in its global setting was arranged.The Australian region, including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and a large sector of the Antarctic, covers one eighth of the Earth's surface and historically has played an important role in the study of geomagnetism. The region contains both the south magnetic and geomagnetic poles, and two Australian Antarctic stations (Casey and Davis) are situated in the region of the south polar cusp (see Figure 1).\n\nGeochemical and microbiological fingerprinting of airborne dust that fell in Canberra, Australia, in October 2002\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Deckker, Patrick; Abed, Raeid M. M.; de Beer, Dirk; Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe; O'Loingsigh, Tadhg; SchefuÃ, Enno; Stuut, Jan-Berend W.; Tapper, Nigel J.; van der Kaars, Sander\n\n2008-12-01\n\nDuring the night of 22-23 October 2002, a large amount of airborne dust fell with rain over Canberra, located some 200 km from Australia's east coast, and at an average altitude of 650 m. It is estimated that during that night about 6 g m-2 of aeolian dust fell. We have conducted a vast number of analyses to \"fingerprint\" some of the dust and used the following techniques: grain size analysis; scanning electron microscope imagery; major, trace, and rare earth elemental, plus Sr and Nd isotopic analyses; organic compound analyses with respective compound-specific isotope analyses; pollen extraction to identify the vegetation sources; and molecular cloning of 16S rRNA genes in order to identify dust bacterial composition. DNA analyses show that most obtained 16S rRNA sequences belong mainly to three groups: Proteobacteria (25%), Bacteriodetes (23%), and gram-positive bacteria (23%). In addition, we investigated the meteorological conditions that led to the dust mobilization and transport using model and satellite data. Grain sizes of the mineral dust show a bimodal distribution typical of proximal dust, rather than what is found over oceans, and the bimodal aspect of size distribution confirms wet deposition by rain droplets. The inorganic geochemistry points to a source along/near the Darling River in NW New South Wales, a region that is characteristically semiarid, and both the organic chemistry and palynoflora of the dust confirm the location of this source area. Meteorological reconstructions of the event again clearly identify the area near Bourke-Cobar as being the source of the dust. This study paves the way for determining the export of Australian airborne dust both in the oceans and other continents.\n\nA Personal Memoir of Policy Failure: The Failed Merger of ANU and the Canberra CAE\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nScott, Roger\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe more immediate context of the events the author describes in this article is needed in order to identify the policy framework within which the Australian National University (ANU)-Canberra CAE (CCAE) merger was placed as a component of a wider public policy initiative undertaken by John Dawkins.

M.; O'Brien, D. M.; Campbell, S. K.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe extensive fires in southeastern Australia in January 2003 culminated in the Canberra firestorm of 18 January. The fires generated a pall of smoke that blanketed the Canberra area for the following week and affected the region for most of the following month. Analysis of Sun photometer data shows that aerosol optical depths Ï500 > 7 were observed during the week following the firestorm. During the subsequent month the smoke aerosol dispersed, although background conditions (Ï500 < 0.1) did not return until after significant rain in late February. Analysis of aerosol optical properties retrieved from sky radiance scans shows remarkably high single scattering albedo (Ï440 Ë 0.96) with only a small depression evident in the week following the firestorm. This indicates that the aerosols were significantly less absorbing than would be expected from smoke freshly generated by flaming combustion, possibly a result of inefficient combustion due to the extreme intensity of the fire, and marks them out as quite distinct from the more absorbing biomass burning aerosols encountered in the savannas of tropical Australia. The high single scattering albedo gave rise to mean radiative forcings of -50 W m-2 at the top of the atmosphere and -172 W m-2 at the surface during the week following the firestorm. Maximum heating rates are depressed by a factor of two at Ï440 = 0.96 compared with Ï440 = 0.88. Nevertheless, for plausible atmospheric profiles the large optical depths caused heating rates peaking at more than 10 K/day near the top of the smoke layer. The layer stabilized the lower troposphere through a combination of reduced surface heating and a positive gradient in heating rate through most of the layer. The enhanced stability suppressed surface temperatures and winds during the week following the firestorm, reducing the risk of renewed fire danger, and suggesting a useful role for aerosol effects in weather prediction models.\n\nMapping Participation in Situated Language Learning\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGroves, Olivia; Verenikina, Irina; Chen, Honglin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nResearch on the international student experience in Australia has highlighted the challenges that international students face when obtaining tertiary qualifications in an Australian university [AEI.

Universities have a responsibility to their communities and more broadly as leaders in society. Settings-based health promotion is an effective method for increasing healthy environments and an organisational culture that supports health. \"Healthy Universities\" and the Okanagan Charter aim to embed health within the university structure through committed policies and programs. Collaboration across Australia can support this sector-wide adoption. Leadership is required from Australian universities to invest in health promotion. This is the time for higher education in Australia to consider its role in shaping the health of its local and global communities. Â© 2018 The Authors.

Ian was born in Melbourne, Australia. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering (with honors) in 1973 and his Master of Engineering Science in Civil Engineering in 1975, both from Monash University. After completing his Ph.D. in Agricultural Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1979, he joined the Department of Agricultural Engineering at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, as an Assistant Professor. In 1983 he returned with his family to Australia to work as a Senior Research Scientist in the Canberra Laboratory of the then CSIRO Division of Water and Land Resources as a hydrologist in the Physical Hydrology and Water Quality Program. He left the Canberra Laboratory in 1986 for an appointment as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Engineering at the University of Minnesota, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1989.\n\nClaims Against a University: The Role of Administrative Review in Australia and the United Kingdom\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRochford, Francine\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe recent decision of the High Court of Australia in \"Griffith University v.

Newer electronics modules, such as the Lynx, were not supported under the VMS based operating system. The LYNX module was provided as the standard acquisition electronics following the release of the Windows based CHKED software. This report compares the electronics dead-time, gain shifts, detector resolution and measurement performance of the HKED system operated with the two types of acquisition modules. The comparison was performed using measurements obtained with the ORNL HKED system. The original intent ofmoreÂ Â» this study was to take advantage of both the timing and energy outputs from the HPGE detector to acquire data with both sets of electronics in parallel. Although this approach has been applied successfully with other systems, in this case we found the timing output produced a significant amount of noise such that a comparison between the electronics would be invalid. So the comparative measurements were performed sequentially. The ICB-NIM data was acquired over the course of 12 months with 255 measurements while the LYNX data was acquired over a period of 10 months with 75 measurements. To simplify the comparison, all data used in this study was acquired using the Canberra CHKED (V1.0) software package. The performance analysis was based primarily on the peak locations, peak widths and concentration values reported by the CHKED software. The raw spectra from the XRF measurements were also examined to extract additional 109Cd peak location and width data for the hybrid measurements (the standard hybrid report template does not report these values).Â«Â less\n\nThe Hidden Topography of Australia's Arts Nation: The Contribution of Universities to the Artistic Landscape\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWilson, Jenny\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn \"Arts Nation\" 2015, the Australia Council documented the current landscape of artistic endeavour in Australia, acknowledging that there are still gaps that need to be filled to build a greater public understanding of the arts in Australia.

Tenderness was objectively measured using Warner-Bratzler (WB) shear force. Muscle pH and cooking loss were determined on all samples and colour was measured on a sub-sample of loins. A total of 909 midloins from retail butcher shops and supermarkets located in four Australian capital cities (Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, and Perth) were evaluated at four sampling times (December 1997 and March, June, and October 1998). Overall, 20.3% of all midloins purchased had a WB shear force value above the threshold level of 5 kg. Generic samples from Melbourne butcher shops were similar for WB shear force on average to the generic samples from Canberra and Sydney, whereas those from Melbourne supermarkets had significantly (P<0.001) higher WB shear force and were in line with generic samples from Perth. In both Canberra and Perth, alliance (branded) lamb had a greater WB shear force (P<0.05) than generic lamb. No relationship was found between price per kg and shear force (r=0.02) for loins purchased in Sydney (n=220). Price per kg differed between months (P<0.001) and suburbs (P<0.001), but not between retail butcher shops and supermarkets. Of the midloins tested, 10.3% had a pH above the critical point of 5.8. Midloins from the December 1997 sampling had a lower pH (P<0.01) than those sampled at other months. Those sampled in Melbourne and Perth had a similar mean pH, which were lower (P<0.001) than Canberra and Sydney samples. The findings from this quality audit suggest that there is room to improve the tenderness of Australian lamb sold in the domestic market. A lamb eating quality assurance system, based on set protocols, is one approach that is currently being investigated in Australia to ensure the supply of consistently high eating quality lamb to consumers.\n\nA University-Wide ePortfolio Initiative at Federation University Australia: Software Analysis, Test-to-Production, and Evaluation Phases\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHains-Wesson, Rachael; Wakeling, Lara; Aldred, Peter\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper describes an ePortfolio implementation strategy at Federation University Australia, Victoria (formerly the University of Ballarat).

The entry-level standards cover the competencies required by a person entering the profession without therapeutic endorsement of their registration. The therapeutic competency standards address the additional competencies required for therapeutic endorsement of registration. This paper presents a revised version of the universal (entry-level) and therapeutic competency standards for the profession of optometry in Australia in 2008. Expert members of the profession and representatives from schools of optometry, registration boards in Australia, state divisions of Optometrists Association Australia and the New Zealand Association of Optometrists were consulted in the process of updating the standards. Three new elements of competency have been added to the standards. Twenty-three new performance criteria with associated indicators have been added. Some performance criteria from the earlier document have been combined. Substantial alterations were made to the presentation of indicators throughout the document. The updated entry-level (universal) and therapeutic competency standards were adopted on behalf of the profession by the National Council of Optometrists Association Australia in November 2008. Competency standards are used by Australian and New Zealand registration authorities for the purposes of registration and therapeutic endorsement of registration via the Optometry Council of Australia and New Zealand accreditation and assessment processes. They have also been used as the basis of the World Council of Optometry Global Competency-Based Model.\n\nPublic health response to a measles outbreak on a university campus in Australia, 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, J; Banu, S; Young, M; Francis, D; Langfeldt, K; Jarvinen, K\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis report describes the effective public health response to a measles outbreak involving a university campus in Brisbane, Australia. Eleven cases in total were notified, mostly university students. The public health response included targeted measles vaccination clinics which were established on campus and focused on student groups most likely to have been exposed. The size of the university population, social interaction between students on and off campus, as well as limited vaccination records for the university community presented challenges for the control of this extremely infectious illness. We recommend domestic students ensure vaccinations are current prior to matriculation. Immunisation information should be included in university student enrolment packs. Incoming international students should ensure routine vaccinations are up-to-date prior to arrival in Australia, thereby reducing the risk of importation of measles and other infectious diseases.\n\nBackground frequency of Bacillus species at the Canberra Airport: A 12 month study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGahan, Michelle E; Thomas, Rory; Rossi, Rebecca; Nelson, Michelle; Roffey, Paul; Richardson, Michelle M; McNevin, Dennis\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAnthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis, is a naturally occurring disease in Australia. Whilst mainly limited to livestock in grazing regions of Victoria and New South Wales, movement of people, stock and vehicles means B. anthracis could be present outside this region. Of particular interest is the \"background\" prevalence of B. anthracis at transport hubs including airports. The aim of this study was to determine the background frequency of B. anthracis and the commonly used hoax agent Bacillus thuringiensis at the Canberra Airport over a 12 month period. Samples were collected daily for seven days each month from August 2011-July 2012 and analyzed using species specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fourteen samples (of a total of 575) were positive for the B. anthracis PL3 genomic marker, 24 for the cya (pXO1) plasmid marker and five for the capB (pXO2) plasmid marker. Whilst five samples were positive for both PL3 and cya, no samples were positive for all three markers hence there is no evidence to suggest the presence of pathogenic B. anthracis strains. B. anthracis targets were detected primarily in February 2012 and B. thuringiensis peaked in October and November 2011 and again in April and May 2012. This study provides a rapid method to screen for, and differentiate, Bacillus species. Armed with this information investigators will be able to discriminate a \"threat\" from \"background\" frequencies should the need arise. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The findings indicated that in Australia/New Zealand, paediatrics made up 20% of the total curriculum, but only 13% in Canada. Canadian reference materials were utilized less often in Canadian universities than in Australia/New Zealand. Theories taught most often in Australia/New Zealand were: Sensory Integration, Neurodevelopmental Therapy, Client-Centered Practice, Playfulness, and the Model of Human Occupation. In Canada, the most frequent theories were: Piaget's Stages of Cognitive/Intellectual Development, Neurodevelopmental Therapy, Erikson's Eight Stages of Psychosocial Development and Sensory Integration. The most frequently taught paediatric assessment tools in both regions were the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency and Miller Assessment for Preschoolers. Paediatric intervention methods taught to students in all three countries focused on activities of daily living/self-care, motor skills, perceptual and visual motor integration, and infant and child development.\n\nTowards 2000: Directions for Australia’s Military Strategy\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1985-03-01\n\nMcBride, KCMG, MP, Minister for Defence, Canberra, 28th September 195^Â« 73.

By the time it was under control, four people were dead and more than 500 homes were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the Mount Stromlo campus of the Australian National University, the location of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics. In response to the fires, the University initiated its emergency management strategy and business continuity plans. These allowed the School to recommence limited operations within two weeks of the disaster. This paper details a case study of the impact of the fire (in part using personal recollections of staff and students), and the emergency response implemented by the University. It describes the development of the University's emergency management strategy, with its emphasis on the key elements of clear chain of command and flexibility in developing an incident-specific response. The paper also provides an assessment of how the plan worked during an actual incident and some of the lessons learned, including the importance of the early response, managing the impact on people, media management, insurance and communications.\n\nInternational Student Flows for University Education and the Bilateral Market Integration of Australia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMin, Byung S.; Falvey, Rod\n\n2018-01-01\n\nStudy at a foreign university can be an important way of developing international human capital.

This approach substantially extends existing deterministic methods for the analysis of engineered flow networks (e.g. Newton's method or the Hardy Cross scheme). The network is represented as an undirected graph structure, in which the uncertainty is represented by a continuous relative entropy on the space of internal and external flow rates. The head losses (potential differences) on the network are treated as dependent variables, using specified pipe-flow resistance functions. The entropy is maximised subject to \"observable\" constraints on the mean values of certain flow rates and/or potential differences, and also \"physical\" constraints arising from the frictional properties of each pipe and from Kirchhoff's nodal and loop laws. A numerical method is developed in Matlab for solution of the integral equation system, based on multidimensional quadrature. Several nonlinear resistance functions (e.g. power-law and Colebrook) are investigated, necessitating numerical solution of the implicit Lagrangian by a double iteration scheme. The method is applied to a 1123-node, 1140-pipe water distribution network for the suburb of Torrens in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia, using network data supplied by water authority ACTEW Corporation Limited. A number of different assumptions are explored, including various network geometric representations, prior probabilities and constraint settings, yielding useful predictions of network demand and performance. We also propose this methodology be used in conjunction with in-flow monitoring systems, to obtain better inferences of user consumption without large investments in monitoring equipment and maintenance.\n\nUniversity Student Finances in 2012: A Study of the Financial Circumstances of Domestic and International Students in Australia's Universities\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBexley, Emmaline; Daroesman, Suzanne; Arkoudis, Sophie; James, Richard\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe aim of the Australian University Student Finances Survey 2012 is to provide an evidence-based understanding of the financial circumstances of the student population in Australia (both international and domestic) through the collection of quantitative data on: access to income support and scholarships, income from paid employment and the impactâ¦\n\nProfessional misconduct: the case of the Medical Board of Australia v Tausif (occupational discipline).\n\nPubMed\n\nColton, Caroline\n\n2015-03-01\n\nIn 2014, the Australian Capital Territory Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal (ACAT) made a finding of professional misconduct against a Canberra general practitioner working in two bulk-billing medical practices established by a corporate medical practice service company, Primary Health Care Limited (Medical Board of Australia v Tausif (Occupational Discipline) [2015] ACAT 4). This column analyses that case, particularly in relation to the ACAT finding that the practitioner's professional misconduct was substantially contributed to by an unsafe system of care, specifically, the failure of Primary Health Care to provide supervision and mentoring for clinicians working at its medical centres. The case highlights the professional pressures carried by general practitioners who practise medicine within the framework of corporate bulk-billing business models. The column also examines the related issue of general practitioner co-payments in Australia and their impact on business models built around doctors purportedly characterised as independent contractors, bulk-billing large numbers of patients each day for short consultations.\n\nMuslim Students' Cultural and Religious Experiences in City, Suburban and Regional University Campuses in NSW, Australia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPossamai, Adam; Dunn, Kevin; Hopkins, Peter; Worthington, Lisa; Amin, Faroque\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlthough there has been much research about the growing ethnic and religious diversity on university campuses across the world, relatively little is known about the religious and cultural experiences of Muslim students on university campuses in Australia.

However, the larval development of this species is poorly understood. In this study, we determined the number of instars in this pest using three batches of field-collected larvae from Guiyang, Guizhou, China. The postgenal length, head capsule width, mandibular phragma length, and body length of 773 individuals were measured, and k-means clustering was used for instar grouping. Four distance measures-Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, and Canberra-were determined. The reported instar numbers, ranging from 4 to 11, were set as initial cluster centers for k-means clustering. The Canberra distance yielded reliable instar grouping, which was consistent with the first instar, as characterized by egg bursters and prepupae with dark histoblasts. Females and males of the last cluster of larvae were identified using Feulgen-stained gonads. Morphometric differences between the two sexes were not significant. Validation was performed using the Brooks-Dyar and Crosby rules, revealing that the larval stage of S. quinquestriatum is composed of eight instars.\n\nUniversal post-arrival screening for child refugees in Australia: isn't it time?\n\nPubMed\n\nPatradoon-Ho, Patrick S; Ambler, Rosemary W\n\n2012-02-01\n\nIt is known that the refugee population in Australia is at risk of tuberculosis (TB) and children with TB infection can develop active disease with devastating consequence. Currently, in New South Wales (NSW) and possibly other Australian States and Territories, there are different and complex health-screening pathways for newly arrived refugees. This is compounded by various factors, such as social and language difficulties for refugees to access healthcare and limited pre-embarkation screening. In this Viewpoint article, we present a child refugee in Australia with TB and use this case to reason why a universal post-arrival health screening programme should be established.

Higher education students may be at an increased risk of importing infectious disease as many undertake multiple visits to regions with higher infectious disease endemicity. Little is known about the health behaviours of domestic or international university students, particularly students from low resource countries who travel to high-resource countries for education. This study aimed to assess travel-associated health risks and preventative behaviours in a sample of both domestic and international university students in Australia. In 2010, a 28 item self-administered online survey was distributed to students enrolled at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Multiple methods of distributing links to the online survey were utilised. The survey examined the international travel history, travel intentions, infection control behaviours and self-reported vaccination history. A total of 1663 respondents completed the online survey, 22.1% were international students and 83.9% were enrolled at an undergraduate level. Half had travelled internationally in the previous 12 months, with 69% of those travelling only once during that time with no difference in travel from Australia between domestic and international students (p = 0.8). Uptake of pre-travel health advice was low overall with 68% of respondents reporting they had not sought any advice from a health professional prior to their last international trip. Domestic students were more likely to report uptake of a range of preventative travel health measures compared to international students, including diarrhoeal medication, insect repellent, food avoidance and condoms (P < 0.0001). Overall, students reported low risk perception of travel threats and a low corresponding concern for these threats.

Lewis researchers accelerated their studies of high energy propellants in the early 1950s. In late 1954, Lewis researchers studied the combustion characteristics of gaseous hydrogen in a turbojet combustor. It was found that the hydrogen provided a very high efficiency. Almost immediately thereafter, Associate Director Abe Silverstein became focused on the possibilities of hydrogen for aircraft propulsion. That fall, Silverstein secured a contract to work with the air force to examine the practicality of liquid hydrogen aircraft. A B-57B Canberra was obtained by the air force especially for this project, referred to as Project Bee. The aircraft was powered by two Wright J65 engines, one of which was modified so that it could be operated using either traditional or liquid hydrogen propellants. The engine and its liquid hydrogen fuel system were tested extensively in the Altitude Wind Tunnel and the Four Burner Area test cells in 1955 and 1956. A B-57B flight program was planned to test the system on an actual aircraft. The aircraft would take off using jet fuel, switch to liquid hydrogen while over Lake Erie, then after burning the hydrogen supply switch back to jet fuel for the landing. The third test flight, in February 1957, was a success, and the ensuing B-57B flights remain the only demonstration of hydrogen-powered aircraft.\n\nAttitude to the subject of chemistry in undergraduate nursing students at Fiji National University and Federation University, Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrown, Stephen; Wakeling, Lara; Peck, Blake; Naiker, Mani; Hill, Dolores; Naidu, Keshni\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAttitude to the subject of chemistry was quantified in first-year undergraduate nursing students, at two geographically distinct universities. A purpose-designed diagnostic instrument (ASCI) was given to students at Federation University, Australia (n= 114), and at Fiji National University, Fiji (n=160). Affective and cognitive sub-scales within ASCI showed reasonable internal consistency. Cronbach's alpha for the cognitive sub-scale was 0.786 and 0.630, and 0.787 and 0.788 for affective sub-scale for the Federation University and Fiji National University students, respectively. Mean (SD) score for the cognitive sub-scale was 10.5 (5.6) and 15.2 (4.1) for students at Federation University and Fiji National University, respectively (P<0.001, t-test). Mean (SD) score for the affective sub-scale was 13.1 (5.1) and 20.7 (4.3) for students at Federation University and Fiji National University, respectively (P < 0.001, t-test). An exploratory factor analysis (n=274) confirmed a two-factor solution consistent with affective and cognitive sub-scales, each with good internal consistency. Quantifying attitude to chemistry in undergraduate nursing students using ASCI may have utility in assessing the impact of novel teaching strategies used in the education of nursing students in areas of bioscience and chemistry. However, geographically distinct populations of undergraduate nurses may show very different attitudes to chemistry.\n\nMaking Progress: Women in Management in Primary & Secondary Education in Australia.

While Australia has maintained a rate of 5 to 6 cases per 100,000 for TB since the mid-1980s, there has been a steady increase in incidence over the past decade. In 2011, Australia's overseas-born population continued to represent the majority of TB notifications (88%) with a notification rate of 20.2 per 100,000. The incidence of TB in the Australian-born Indigenous population has fluctuated over the last decade and showed no clear trend; however, in 2011 the notification rate was 4.9 per 100,000, which is a notable decrease from the 7.5 per 100,000 recorded in 2010. The incidence of TB in the Australian-born non-Indigenous population has continued to remain low at 0.9 per 100,000. Australia continued to record only a small number of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases nationally (n=25), all of which were identified in the overseas-born population. To ensure that Australia can retain its low TB rate and work toward reducing rates further, it is essential that Australia maintains good centralised national TB reporting to monitor trends and identify at-risk populations, and continues to contribute to global TB control initiatives.

The prevalence of smoking was 26.6 per cent among students in Malaysia and 18.8 per cent among students in Australia (average 23.4%). Both samples have similar patterns in terms of age of starting smoking, time of the day when they smoked, family and peer history of smoking, and whether or not they inhaled deeply during smoking. The smokers tend to be male, studying beyond the first year, staying with peers outside the hostel, having financial sources other than a scholarship, and abnormal mental health score. However, the smokers from the Australian samples were noted to smoke less and made fewer attempts at quitting the habit.\n\nPREFACE 12th International Workshop on Slow Positron Beam Techniques\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuckman, Stephen; Sullivan, James; White, Ronald\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSLOPOS-12 included: Positron Interactions with Surfaces Positron Beam and Detector Technology Positron Interactions with Atoms and Molecules Positronium Science Defects and Vacancies in Materials Porosity and Open Volume in Materials Antimatter in Biomedical Science Anti-hydrogen Studies Positron Transport Annihilation On a sad note, delegates paid tribute to the contributions of one of our colleagues, Chris Beling, who tragically passed away shortly before the meeting. Chris' contributions to positron science and to the education of young scientists were noted in a number of the invited presentations.

This represents a rate of 5.8 per 100,000 population in 2012 and 5.5 per 100,000 population in 2013 and a reversal of the upward trend in TB incidence reported since 2007. In 2012 and 2013, Australia's overseas-born population continued to represent the majority of TB notifications with an incidence rate of 19.5 per 100,000 and 18.4 per 100,000 respectively. The incidence of TB in the Australian-born Indigenous population has fluctuated over the last decade; however, it remained reasonably steady in 2012 and 2013 with an incidence rate of 4.5 per 100,000 and 4.6 per 100,000 respectively. The incidence of TB in the Australian-born non-Indigenous population has continued to remain low at 0.7 per 100,000 in 2012 and 0.8 per 100,000 in 2013. Australia continued to record only a small number of multi-drug resistant TB cases nationally (2012: n=20; 2013: n=22) of which nearly all were identified in the overseas-born population. This report demonstrates excellent and sustained control of TB in Australia and reflects Australia's commitment to reducing the global burden of TB. This work is copyright.

Consequently, water is one of South Australia's highest priorities. Focus on water research and sources of water in the state became more critical during the Millenium drought that occurred between 1997 and 2011. In response to increased concern about water sources the South Australian government established The Goyder Institute for Water Research - a partnership between the South Australian State Government, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Flinders University, University of Adelaide and University of South Australia. The Goyder Institute undertakes cutting-edge science to inform the development of innovative integrated water management strategies to ensure South Australia's ongoing water security and enhance the South Australian Government's capacity to develop and deliver science-based policy solutions in water management. This paper focuses on the integrated water resource assessment of the northern Adelaide region, including the key research investments in water and climate, and how this information is being utilised by decision makers in the region.\n\nThe Impact of Pecha Kucha Presentations in the Assessment of a Translation Studies Unit at the University of Western Australia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nColombi, Anna Gadd\n\n2017-01-01\n\nResults of a case study on the implementation of Pecha Kucha presentations undertaken at The University of Western Australia in 2015 are presented and discussed here.

Given the high accessibility of gambling in Australia and its association with entertainment, students from overseas countries, particularly those where gambling is restricted or illegal, may be particularly vulnerable. This study examines problem gambling and its correlates among international and domestic university students using a sample of 836 domestic students (286 males; 546 females); and 764 international students (369 males; 396 females) at three Australian universities. Our findings indicate that although most students gamble infrequently, around 5 % of students are problem gamblers, a proportion higher than that in the general adult population. Popular gambling choices include games known to be associated with risk (cards, horse races, sports betting, casino games, and gaming machines) as well as lotto/scratch tickets. Males are more likely to be problem gamblers than females, and almost 10 % of male international students could be classified as problem gamblers. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that male gender, international student status, financial stress, negative affect and frequency of gambling on sports, horses/dogs, table games, casino gaming machines, internet casino games and bingo all significantly predicted problem gambling. Results from this study could inform gambling-education programs in universities as they indicate which groups are more vulnerable and specify which games pose more risk of problem gambling.\n\nDeutsch in Australien (German in Australia)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nApelt, Hans-Peter\n\n1975-01-01\n\nGerman studies have expanded in the last 25 years in Australia.

Ten students who study at the University of Newcastle in Australia participated in semi-structured interviews. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. The findings indicated that a variety of food was consumed by the students. Students classified snacks generally as unhealthy. Four major themes that emerged were: the perception of healthy and unhealthy snacks, the factors related to selection of healthy and unhealthy snacks, feelings related to consumption of snacks, and ways to avoid unhealthy snacks. Factors influencing choices about healthy or unhealthy snacks were environment, availability of the snacks, study pressure, health problems, habits, and social activity. The limitation of this study was the small size of the sample, resulting in the fact that no general conclusions could be drawn. The results however, could help school nurses to gain a deeper understanding of university students ' snacking patterns. It might also assist school nurses in the development of healthy eating guidance for university students.\n\nMathematical Sciences in Australia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nThomas, Jan; Muchatuta, Michelle; Wood, Leigh\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis article investigates enrolment trends in mathematical sciences in Australian universities.

The largest such storm occurred on 22-23 September 2009 and had a front of an estimated 3000km. A 24hr average PM10 concentration of over 2,000Î¼g/m3 was recorded in several locations and an hourly peak of over 15,000Î¼g/m3 was recorded (Leys et al. 2011). Over two time periods duplicate aerosol samples were collected on 47mm diameter cellulose nitrate membranes at a location removed from anthropogenic influences. One set of samples was collected in the afternoon the dust event started and another was collected overnight. Additionally, overnight rainfall was collected in a sterile bottle.DNA was directly extracted one membrane from each time point for molecular cloning and high throughput sequencing, while the other was cultivated on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA). High throughput sequencing was performed using the 454 Titanium platform. From the three samples, 19,945 curated sequences were obtained representing 942 OTUS, with the three samples approximately equal in number. Unclassified Rhizobiales and Stenotrophomonas were the most abundant groups which could be attributed names. A total of 942 OTUs were identified (cutoff = 0.03), and despite the temporal relation of the samples, only eleven were found in all three samples, indicating that the dust storm evolved in composition as it passed over the region. Approximately 800 and 500 CFU/m3 were found in the two cultivated samples, tenfold more than was collected from previous dust events (Lim et al, 2011). Identification of cultivars revealed a dominance of the gram positive Firmicutes phylum, while the clone library showed a more even distribution of taxa, with Actinobacteria the most common and Firmicutes comprising less than 10% of sequences. Collectively, the analyses indicate that the concentration of cultivable organisms during the dust storm dramatically\n\nSome New Hypotheses Concerning Word Families in Chinese\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPulleyblank, E.

Australian adults (n=1002) living in Townsville (19Â°S, 146Â°E), Brisbane (27Â°S, 153Â°E), Canberra (35Â°S, 149Â°E) and Hobart (43Â°S, 147Â°E) were recruited between 2009 and 2010. Data on sun exposure behaviours were collected by daily sun exposure dairies; personal UVR exposure was measured with a polysulphone dosimeter. Meteorological data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology; ambient UVR levels were estimated using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument data. Higher daily maximum temperatures were associated with reduced likelihood of wearing a long-sleeved shirt or wearing long trousers in Canberra and Hobart, and higher clothing-adjusted UVR dose in Canberra. Higher daily humidity was associated with less time spent outdoors in Canberra. Higher ambient UVR level was related to a greater clothing-adjusted personal UVR dose in Hobart and a greater likelihood of using sunscreen in Townsville. The current findings enhance our understanding of the impact of weather conditions on the population's sun exposure behaviours. This information will allow us to refine current predictive models for UVR-related diseases, and guide future health service and health promotion needs. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Prospective laboratory and field study. Samples were collected from nine brands of previously unopened bags (new bags) of dry food and 20 field sources of stored dry food in homes in Sydney and Canberra, Australia. All samples were initially examined for the presence of mites using a stereo-binocular microscope and then placed in separate filter-paper-sealed containers. Field samples were incubated at an average temperature of 29Â°C and 78% relative humidity (RH) for 5 weeks and then at average 26Â°C/83% RH for 8 weeks. Paired new-bag samples were stored under room conditions (average 23Â°C/47% RH) and controlled incubator conditions (average 26Â°C/80% RH) for 6 weeks. All samples were thoroughly examined for mites, mite eggs and visible mould once weekly using a stereo-binocular microscope. Storage mites were not visualised in any of the field samples or in new-bag samples stored at room temperature. Storage mites, identified as Tyrophagus putrescentiae, were visualised in increasing numbers in seven of nine new-bag samples after incubation, with first mites and then eggs evident after 3 weeks of incubation. We confirmed the presence of viable storage mites in a range of previously unopened commercial dry dog foods in Australia and confirmed the possibility of heavy storage mite contamination for dry food stored under conditions of moderate temperature and high humidity. These findings have relevance to storage mite and/or dust mite sensitivity in canine atopic dermatitis.

This may reflect the impact of childhood VZV vaccination programs introduced universally in Australia in late 2005. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in incidence of HZ and PHN in Australia over time, and associated healthcare resource utilisation. Methods Australian data on general practice (GP) encounters for HZ, specific antiviral prescribing data from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, emergency department presentations from the states of NSW and Victoria and national hospitalisation data for HZ were analysed for time trends using regression models. Two time periods (2000-2006 and 2006-2013) were compared which correspond broadly with the pre- and post- universal VZV vaccination period. Results All data sources showed increasing rates of HZ with age and over time. The GP database showed a significant annual increase in encounters for HZ of 2.5 per 100,000 between 1998 and 2013, and the rates of prescriptions for HZ increased by 4.2% per year between 2002 and 2012. In the 60+ population HZ incidence was estimated to increase from 11.9 to 15.4 per 1,000 persons using GP data or from 12.8 to 14.2 per 1,000 persons using prescription data (p<0.05, between the two periods). Hospitalisation data did not show the same increasing trend over time, except for the age group â¥80 years. Most emergency visits for HZ were not admitted, and showed significant increases over time. Discussion The burden of HZ in Australia is substantial, and continues to increase over time. This increase is seen both pre- and post-universal VZV vaccination in 2005, and is most prominent in the older population. The substantial burden of HZ, along with ageing of the Australian population and the importance of healthy ageing, warrants consideration of HZ vaccination for the elderly.

The aircraft was being prepared for the October 1966 Inspection of the center. The Inspection also marked Lewisâ twentieth anniversary. Lewis researchers had been studying engine noise for almost a decade, but the problem seemed to be increasing in the mid-1960s with heavier airline traffic and larger engines. Researchers discovered early on that the majority of the noise did not emanate from the engine itself, but from the mixing of the hot exhaust gasses with the atmosphere. Attempts to reduce the turbulence using new exhaust nozzles were successful but often resulted in decreased engine performance. The researchers decided to try to lower the jet nozzle exit velocity without decreasing its thrust. The inlet mass air flow had to be increased to accomplish this. The Lewis B-57B was powered by two Wright Aeronautical J65 turbojets. Lewis engineers modified the stators on the two engines to simulate the noise levels from more-modern turbofan engines. A noise suppressor was added to only one of the two engines, seen here on the left. The engines were run one at a time at power levels similar to landing while the aircraft sat on the Lewis hangar apron. A microphone and recording equipment was setup to capture the noise levels. The engine with the suppressor produced 13 fewer decibels than the standard engine.\n\nRural medical education: five medical students spend a year in rural Port Lincoln, Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaillie, Sue; Matena, Jenni; Yerxa, John; Newbury, Jonathan\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia established the Spencer Gulf Rural Health School (SGRHS) as a joint venture to facilitate rural health professional education and research. Annually a cohort of medical students from the University of Adelaide volunteer and are placed in various SGRHS 'learning centres' throughout rural South Australia for the 5th year of their medical training. This article addresses the issues encountered in one of these 'learning centres' in Port Lincoln, rural South Australia. The challenge was to integrate five students into a general medical practice and the local hospital and to provide high quality medical education for the academic year. Medical practice, student and university requirements were identified and a range of strategies implemented to address these. To date, four groups of medical students have successfully completed their rural academic year in Port Lincoln since 2003. The local systems have evolved to allow five students to integrate into the practice and hospital using a range of teaching and learning methods and resources.\n\nHoward's End: A Narrative Memoir of Political Contrivance, Neoconservative Ideology and the Australian History Curriculum\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTaylor, Tony\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn August 2006, Australia's conservative prime minister John Howard convened a "
