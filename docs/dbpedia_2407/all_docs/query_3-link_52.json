        "text": "Mary Robinson ( )\n\nreproduced by permission of the Trustees of the Wallace Collection, London\n\nRobinson [née Darby], Mary [Perdita] ( ), author and actress, was probably born on 27 November 1758 at Minster House, College Green, Bristol, although she may have been the 'Polly Derby' baptized at St Augustine-the-Less, Bristol, in 1756. She was the third of the five children (two daughters and three sons) of Nicholas Darby (c.1720–1785), a sea captain and merchant, and his wife, Hester Vanacott (c.1725–1793), of North Petherton in Somerset. Her father, who was of Irish extraction, was probably born in St John's, Newfoundland. He married Hester Vanacott in 1749, and about 1753 the couple settled in Bristol, where Darby's mercantile interests were based.\n\nYouth\n\nMary was educated in Park Street at a school run by the sisters of Hannah More and by a succession of private tutors. Her parents pampered her: 'To sing, to play a lesson on the harpsichord, to recite an elegy, and to make doggrel verses, made the extent of my occupations' (Perdita, 25). In 1765 her father embarked on a 'wild and romantic' scheme (ibid., 23): an attempt to establish permanent cod, salmon, and seal fishing posts on the southern coast of Labrador. He invested most of his wealth but lost heavily, and during March 1768 the family's possessions were sold and Mary's parents separated. Shortly afterwards Mary and her youngest surviving brother, George, went to London, where Mary recommenced her education under an alcoholic called Meribah Lorrington in Chelsea. Then, when that failed, she was placed with a Mrs Leigh in Battersea. About 1771 her mother opened her own school at 5 Park Walk, Little Chelsea, where Mary taught English for about eight months. 'Assistants of every kind were engaged, and I was deemed worthy of an occupation that flattered my self-love, and impressed my mind with a sort of domestic consequence' (ibid., 31). Darby, however, was shocked by this example of his wife's enterprise. Believing himself compromised, he demanded its closure, and Mary was sent instead to a sort of finishing school at Oxford House in Marylebone.\n\nNow there was talk of her going on the stage. She went to see Thomas Hull and David Garrick. 'The drama, the delightful drama, seemed the very criterion of all human happiness' (Perdita, 37). Garrick was delighted with everything she did. He said that her voice reminded him of his favourite, Susannah Cibber; and he organized rehearsals for her at Drury Lane and arranged that he would himself play Lear at her début as Cordelia. Meanwhile, in 1772 or early 1773 she met her future husband, Thomas Robinson (fl. 1750–1802). A louche but charming articled clerk, he claimed to be the nephew of a wealthy Welsh tailor, Thomas Harris, when in fact he was really his illegitimate son. Bullied by her mother, Mary agreed to marry Robinson. Consequently, her stage début was deferred. The couple were married on 12 April 1773, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. For a while Robinson insisted that the marriage was kept secret. After the honeymoon, which was at Maidenhead, Mrs Robinson moved with her mother to a house in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, while Robinson continued to reside with his employers. Mrs Robinson did not love her husband; she told her mother that she was the 'most wretched of mortals' (ibid., 43). None the less, following a trip to Tregunter in Wales to visit Robinson's ‘uncle’, the couple at last set up home together at 13 Hatton Garden.\n\nSociety\n\nHenceforth, Mary Robinson devoted herself to fashionable life. She became a conspicuous figure at Ranelagh Gardens and the Pantheon. She met the broker John ‘Jew’ King, who later claimed to have had an affair with her, and the libertines Thomas, second Lord Lyttelton, and George Robert Fitzgerald, both of whom attempted but failed to seduce her. Robinson meanwhile neglected his affairs; he fell deeply into debt, and during the autumn of 1774 the couple fled London for Tregunter, where at Trefeca House on 18 October Mrs Robinson gave birth to her first child, Maria Elizabeth. They returned to London probably before the end of the year and took lodgings near Berners Street. Robinson was arrested by his creditors, and, on 3 May 1775, committed to the Fleet prison.\n\nMary Robinson shared her husband's confinement in the Fleet. For nine months and three weeks she never left his side. She supported the family with miscellaneous work, and published her first book, Poems by Mrs Robinson, which sold badly. Later she sent a copy of the poems to the whig hostess Georgiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire, who invited her to Devonshire House. Thereafter the duchess became her patron.\n\nAfter her husband's release on 3 August 1776 the couple moved to Lyne's the confectioner in Old Bond Street, following which they moved to Newman Street, Marylebone. Still short of money, Mary Robinson again suggested that she should go on the stage. This time Robinson did not object, and shortly afterwards she was introduced to Sheridan, who engaged her at a 'handsome salary' (Perdita, 90).\n\nTheatrical career\n\nMary Robinson first appeared at Drury Lane on 10 December 1776, playing Juliet to William Brereton's Romeo. Garrick, who had tutored her in her part, sat in the orchestra. In the green room much was made of her beauty and education. The critical response was encouraging. 'Her person is genteel', noted the Morning Post, 'her voice harmonious, and admitting of various modulations;—and her features, when properly animated, are striking, and expressive' (Morning Post, 11 Dec 1776). Soon afterwards she appeared as Statira in Nathaniel Lee's Alexander the Great, as the original Amanda in Sheridan's The Trip to Scarborough, and, for her benefit on 10 April 1777, as Fanny in Garrick's and Colman's The Clandestine Marriage. She would have been the original Maria in Sheridan's The School for Scandal too, had not she been heavily pregnant with her second child, Sophia, who was born about 20 May. The child lived just six weeks.\n\nDuring her second season Mary Robinson appeared as Ophelia, as Lady Anne in Richard the Third, as Araminta in Congreve's The Old Batchelor, as The Lady in John Milton's Comus, as Emily in Hannah Cowley's The Runaway, as Araminta in Vanbrugh's The Confederacy, as the original Fanny in Samuel Jackson Pratt's Joseph Andrews, as Octavia in Dryden's All for Love, as Juliet, and, for her benefit on 30 April, as Lady Macbeth (for which she provided the afterpiece, The Lucky Escape). By now it was clear that she excelled in light comedy roles. During the summer she joined George Colman's company at the Haymarket Theatre, but did not perform, a mix-up with Elizabeth Farren about a favourite part having led to an argument with Colman.\n\nDuring the 1778–9 season Mary Robinson's new parts included the original Lady Plume in Sheridan's The Camp, Palmira in James Miller's Mahomet, Miss Richly in Frances Sheridan's The Discovery, the original Alinda in Robert Jephson's The Law of Lombardy, Jacintha in Benjamin Hoadly's The Suspicious Husband, Fidelia in William Wycherley's The Plain Dealer, and, for her benefit on 14 April 1779, Cordelia. For at least one of her performances as Lady Plume she wore the Devonshire colours, thus signalizing her continued attachment to the duchess of Devonshire. At the end of the season she wore Jacintha's breeches at a masquerade.\n\nMrs Robinson's final season was more remarkable for her life off stage than on it, as it was about this period that details of her private life began to appear regularly in the newspapers. During the late autumn she was said to have been having an affair with Sir John Lade, a sporting baronet. Among her new parts were Viola in Twelfth Night, Perdita in The Winter's Tale, Rosalind in As You Like It, Oriana in Farquhar's The Inconstant, Mrs Brady in Garrick's The Irish Widow, and the original Eliza Campley in Lady Craven's cross-dressing comedy The Miniature Picture. Her last performance at Drury Lane was on 31 May 1780.\n\nThe prince of Wales, and other lovers\n\nIt was as Perdita that Mary Robinson caught the attention of the prince of Wales (the future George IV), thus beginning a relationship that was to affect her life profoundly. The prince first saw her at a command performance on 3 December 1779; four days later he claimed to be passionately in love with her. He sent her a letter via his friend George Capel, Viscount Malden, later fifth earl of Essex (1757–1839); Mrs Robinson replied, and by the spring of 1780—on paper at least—‘Florizel’ and ‘Perdita’ were lovers. Apparently they did not meet until June. Pressed by the prince, Mrs Robinson then gave up her theatrical career; he had already sent her a bond for £20,000, payable when he would come of age, and promised her her own establishment.\n\nPerdita (as she was widely known) now devoted herself to a life of extravagance. She moved to Cork Street and fell deeply into debt. She bought paintings and furniture and took to advertising her triumph at Vauxhall and Ranelagh. Unfortunately, love proved fickle, and when the prince became semi-independent during December 1780 he transferred his attentions to the courtesan Elizabeth Armitstead.\n\nMrs Robinson responded with blandishments and threats. An ugly newspaper war broke out. She threatened to publish the prince's letters, and, inevitably, there was talk of blackmail. Eventually the affair was compromised by Lord Malden (who by now was Mrs Robinson's lover) and the prince's treasurer Colonel George Hotham, who acted for the king; and during September 1781, in exchange for returning the prince's letters, Mrs Robinson was 'rewarded' with £5000 and the tacit promise of an annuity.\n\nDuring October, Mary Robinson went to Paris, where she was wooed by the duc de Chartres. Her notoriety was now at its height. Apparently she had an affair with the duc de Lauzun. She was fêted at the opera house. Marie Antoinette expressed a wish to see her. After returning to London on Boxing day, she hired a house in Berkeley Square. During May she then sparked an affair with Colonel Banastre Tarleton, who was succeeded by Charles James Fox, who, during September, was, in his turn, succeeded by Tarleton again. Fox now settled the prince's annuity at £500. However, Mrs Robinson remained short of money. Day after day the Morning Post and Morning Herald chronicled her busy social life. She popularized the ‘chemise de la reine’ and introduced new styles in fashion and carriages. Unfortunately, during the summer of 1783, her health was undermined by what appears to have been a paralytic stroke, possibly brought on by a miscarriage (later she was also crippled with rheumatism). Partly recovered, she campaigned and wrote ‘puffing’ paragraphs for the Foxites until the summer of 1784, when she was forced abroad by her creditors. From Paris she went to the south of France, then to Aix-la-Chapelle, where, during the autumn and winter of 1786, she apparently helped Tarleton write his History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America. During the summer of 1787 she was at St Amand, where she attempted a mud cure, but without success. She returned to London during the following January.\n\nPoet and novelist\n\nDuring the autumn of 1788, under the pen-name Laura, Mary Robinson sparked a poetical correspondence with ‘Leonardo’ (Robert Merry) in the pages of The World, thus adding her voice to the burgeoning ‘school of Della Crusca’. Her poems were a success, but not everyone approved, and during the following February she was attacked by a jealous ‘Anna Matilda’ (Hannah Cowley). From now until her death her lively and prolific pen was rarely unemployed. She wrote poems for The Oracle (1790–93) and the Morning Post (1797–1800), plays, pamphlets, translations, miscellaneous journalism, autobiography, and several novels. The first volume of her collected poems (1791) was heavily subscribed and well received, but the second volume (1794) did comparatively badly. Much of her work was influenced by the political situation in France; like many writers she was, initially at least, a strong supporter of the French Revolution. She deeply sympathized with Marie Antoinette. She hated Pitt and mocked him in a series of odes in the Morning Post under the pen-name Tabitha Bramble. As a novelist she left few contemporary topics untouched: Vancenza, or, The Dangers of Credulity (1792) vindicates the privileges of talent over rank; Hubert de Sevrac: a Romance of the Eighteenth Century (1796) is a Gothic romance; Angelina (1796) and Walsingham, or, The Pupil of Nature (1797) satirize fashionable life. All of her novels are strongly feminist. In 1799 she published a feminist tract under the pen-name Anne Frances Randall, A Letter to the Women of England, on the Injustice of Mental Subordination (later republished under her own name as Thoughts on the Condition of Women, and the Injustice of Mental Subordination). Her last book of poems, Lyrical Tales (1800), was influenced by Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads. In metrical terms she was, often, an innovator. Her huge productivity can be explained partly by her need to support her affluent lifestyle and partly by a genuine need for self-disclosure and publicity. She made many enemies, and during November 1794 her play Nobody, an uncompromising attack on female gamesters, was booed off the stage by a fashionable clique. She was also attacked by William Gifford and other tory apologists.\n\nMrs Robinson was at Bath during the summer of 1791; during the summer of 1792 she was again in France, then early in September returned to London. She lived in Clarges Street for two years (1790–92), at 14 St James's Place for five years (1792–7), then, as her financial situation once more deteriorated, at houses and apartments in Clifford Street, Curzon Street, Piccadilly, and South Audley Street. She also often stayed with her daughter Maria Elizabeth at Englefield Cottage at Englefield Green, near Egham (1798–1800). Among her friends during the last years were Eliza Fenwick, John Wolcot, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. She separated from Tarleton in May 1797. Although she no longer moved among the aristocratic whigs, there is some evidence that the duchess of Devonshire continued to support her. Like Coleridge, she was interested in the effects of opium on the creative imagination. The first printed reference to ‘Kubla Khan’ appears in one of her poems. Her last months are a chronicle of increasing debts, ill health, and despair; during May she was arrested by a creditor. She died at Englefield Green on 26 December 1800, apparently of a 'dropsy in the chest' (Perdita, 152). Five days later she was buried in the parish churchyard at Old Windsor.\n\nMary Robinson achieved much in her short, vicissitudinous, and paradoxical life. She was a merchant's daughter who satirized the merchant class; a feminist who had few women as friends; a former royal mistress who wrote ‘Jacobin’ novels; a ceaseless self-publicist; and a sometimes morbid personality. For a time during the 1780s London knew no more notorious figure. She was an exhibitionist who loved fashion and excess. No woman was more frequently caricatured and painted. Her turbulent emotional life is pictured, melodramatically, in her Memoirs, poems, and novels. Her best poems, once ignored, are now read as significant contributions to Romanticism. In spite of her compromising personal life, many people admired her; Coleridge called her a 'woman of undoubted Genius'. 'I never knew a human Being with so full a mind', he wrote to Southey some seven months before she died, '—bad, good, & indifferent, I grant you, but full, & overflowing' (Collected Letters, ed. Griggs, 1.562)."
