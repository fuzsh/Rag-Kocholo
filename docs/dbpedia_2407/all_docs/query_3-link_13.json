Students will experience and learn different welding techniques such as MIG, TIG, Stick, and Oxyacetylene welding. Actual practice with the latest technologies such as MIG and TIG will reinforce concepts and provide practical hands-on experience. Several sample test parts will be welded in a lab and broken with a tensile tester to evaluate the calculated load compared to the welded joint strength. Weld samples will also be microscopically inspected to determine the HAZ (heat affected zone) of the material. Oxyacetylene and plasma cutting will be experienced. Interpreting weld symbols on drawings will be learned and applied. **Possible lab fee associated with this course.**\n\nMECA-436\n\nEngineering Economics\n\n2 Credits\n\nThis course provides coverage of the financial side of engineering decisions relating to product development and operations. Course topics provide a foundation for engineers to effectively analyze engineering systems and operations with respect to financial considerations of product development, analysis, and operations. This course prepares students for the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination, Engineering Economics section.\n\nIn the News\n\nFeatured Work\n\nRIT Researchers Push Boundaries of Human-Robotic Interactions\n\nFerat Sahin, Jamison Heard, Yangming Lee, Robert Garrick\n\nSeveral RIT faculty researchers are pushing the boundaries of human-robotic interactions.\n\nView More about RIT Researchers Push Boundaries of Human-Robotic Interactions"
