OBJECTS OF THE ROYAL COLONIAL INSTITUTE. \"To provide a place of meeting for all gentlemen connected with the Colonies and British India, and others taking an interest in Colonial and Indian affairs ; to establish a Beading Koom and Library, in which recent and authentic intelligence upon Colonial and Indian subjects may be constantly available, and a Museum for the collection and exhibition of Colonial and Indian productions ; to facilitate interchange of experiences amongst persons representing all the Dependencies of Great Britain ; to afford opportunities for the reading of Papers, and for holding Discussions upon Colonial and Indian subjects generally ; and to undertake scientific, literary, and statistical investi- gations in connection with the British Empire. But no Paper shall be read, or any discussion be permitted to take place, tending to give to the Institute a party character.\" (Eule I.) There are two classes of Fellows (who must be British subjects), Kesident and Non-Besident, both elected by the Council on the nomination of two Fellows, one of whom at least must sign on personal knowledge. The former pay an entrance fee of £3, and an annual subscription of £2 ; the latter an entrance fee of £1 Is., and an annual subscription of £1 Is. (which is increased to £2 when in the United Kingdom for three months). Besident Fellows can compound for the annual subscription by the payment of £20, or, after five years' annual subscription of £2, on payment of £15 ; and Non-Besident Fellows can compound for the Non-Resident annual subscription on payment of £10. The privileges of Fellows whose subscriptions are not in arrear include the use of the Institute building, which comprises Beading, Writing, and Smoking Booms, Library, Newspaper Boom, &c. All Fellows, whether residing in England or the Colonies, have the Journal and the annual volume of Pro- ceedings forwarded to them. Fellows are entitled to be present at the Evening Meetings, and to introduce one visitor ; to be present at the Annual Conver- sazione, and to introduce a lady.

S THE COLONIAL COLLEGE AND TRAINING FARMS (LIMITED), HOLLESLEY BAY, SUFFOLK. T710UNDED in January 1887, under the auspices of Agents -General for the Colonies, leading Members of the Eoyal Colonial Institute, the Head-Masters of Eton, Westminster, Shrewsbury, Marlborough, Clifton, Haileybury, &c. The College provides for those intending to Emigrate such Practical Training as will test their fitness and qualify them for Colonial Life. It is situated on its own estate in a fine and very healthy position on the Sea-coast. Farms of over 1,800 acres are carried on by the College, for the instruction of its Students, who thus have unrivalled facilities for becoming practically, as well as theoretically, acquainted with all branches of Agriculture, and with Horse, Cattle, and Sheep Breeding, &c., on a large scale. Instruction is also given in Dairying, Veterinary Science and Practice, Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy, Forestry, Horticulture, Land Sur- veying and Building Construction, Book-keeping, Engineer's, Smith's, Carpenter's, Wheelwright's, and Harnessmaker's Work, Biding, Ambu- lance, and various other subjects necessary to the Young Colonist. Many Students of the College are settled in almost every part of the Empire, with whom, as well as with other trustworthy Correspondents able to render valuable assistance to new-comers, regular communication is kept up. The work of the Institution has been periodically recognised as of great value by Statesmen of the highest rank at home and in the Colonies. Prospectus may be obtained from the Resident Director.

The Minutes of the last Ordinary General Meeting were read and confirmed, and it was announced that since that Meeting 9 Fellows had been elected, viz. 3 Resident and 6 Non-Resident. Resident Fellows :— Edmund P. Godson, Arthur C. Mackenzie, Qwyn Vaughan Morgan* Third Ordinary General Meeting. 225 Non-Kesident Fellows : — James Alexander (New Zealand], Leicester P. Beaufort, M.A., B.C.L., Barrister-at-Law (British North Borneo], Harry Franks (New South Wales], Gerald C. Roosmalecocq (Ceylon], Reginald W. Wickham (Ceylon), Josiah Williams, F.R.G.S. (East Africa). It was also announced that donations to the Library of books, maps, &c., had been received from the various Governments of the Colonies and India, Societies, and public bodies both in the United Kingdom and the Colonies, and from Fellows of the Institute and others. The name of Mr. Peter Redpath, on behalf of the Council, and that of Mr. W. G. Devon Astle for the Fellows, were submitted and approved as Auditors of the accounts of the Institute for the past year, in accordance with Rule 48. The CHAIEMAN : This is emphatically a red-letter day in the his- tory of the Institute. In the quarter of a century of our existence we have had papers from a variety of distinguished individuals — military and naval heroes, men of science and art, statesmen at home and from the Colonies, and travellers of experience. But this is the first occasion on which we have had the honour of welcoming a lady, a veritable heroine ; and the lady whom it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce is so well known, she has such a high reputation, not only in this country but throughout the whole of the colonial portion of the Empire, that but very few words are neces- sary on my part. Miss Shaw's graphic descriptions of what she has seen in the various Colonies are replete with criticisms both admir- able and profound, and they have become the text for the study of statesmen, historians, and philanthropists. For this occasion Miss Shaw has written a paper well worthy of her high reputation. There is not a page that does not rivet attention. It is marked by deep thought and is interspersed with lighter touches of her picturesque pen — word-painting that might well pass for copies of the brilliant productions and gorgeous colouring of a Burne Jones. Without detaining you further, I will ask Miss Shaw to read her paper on THE AUSTRALIAN OUTLOOK. IN venturing to speak of the Australian outlook before an audience of which many distinguished members must be much better qualified than I am to form an opinion upon the subject, I do not propose to enter into vexed questions of the public debt, the borrowing policy, 226 The Australian Outlook. the railway administration, the parliamentary or tariff reform of a continent whose affairs of late have been interesting us all so much. Vital as these questions doubtless are to the future of Australia, they have been discussed and rediscussed till there is little which can be said about them that has not been said, and I have thought that it might perhaps be more interesting to-night to approach the Australian outlook from the general and simpler point of view which is suggested by personal observation. It has been said that Australia is uninteresting because she has no past ; but the interest of Australia lies forward, not behind. It is not so much for what she is, still less for what she has been ; it is for what she is going to be that the southern continent is so pro- foundly attractive. The problems which she is working out are new problems — some of them so new that they have hardly shaped themselves yet — the problems, not of our children, but of our grandchildren. In this sense Australia is supremely interesting ; for what is to be seen and studied there to-day gives us the glimpse that we are all constantly desirous to take into the history which is to follow after our time. Already Australia bears towards modern civilisation the position of a divining glass in which it used to be held that persons gifted with second sight could see the future. The total population of the continent is less than 4,000,000, but within the ocean ring which girdles it developments of life and thought are to be studied under the influence of which generations of Englishmen yet unborn will carry on the history of the race. It is difficult to put into words, for anyone who has not felt it, the extraordinary stimulus which is derived from the perpetual attitude of expectation. What is it going to be ? is the question with which everything is approached. The future, with which we languidly pro- fess to concern ourselves in England, is an intense and vivid reality in Australia. There is no looking down, there are no half-longing glances towards the past. Every face is set eagerly, hopefully, deter- minately forward. Progress is the keynote of the whole. Evils are noted only as a weed that has grown in the night to be uprooted. Everything is open to remedy. Enduring misfortune, permanent failure, is rejected from the creed of the Australian. A young con- tinent lies blank before him to carve his will upon, and the air which sweeps through his native bush seems to carry with it from Port Darwin to Port Phillip a buoyant confidence that makes the biggest schemes seem trifles of fulfilment. The extraordinary elasticity with which Australia has recovered from a financial crisis that The Australian Outlook. 227 might have been expected to throw her back for a generation is for the moment a sufficient illustration of what I mean. I have, I think, said enough, possibly more than was at all necessary, to vindicate the right of Australia to dispense with many ordinary sources of attraction, and to claim to be approached frankly in a modern spirit on the modern ground upon which her people have elected to take their stand. She alone of all the continents has no history. So be it ! She is content. She offers the intro- ductory chapter of a new history and bases her claim to the atten- tion of the world upon the future which she is shaping for herself. The first strong impression in relation to this future which a journey through Australia conveys is that while we have always been in the habit of reading, and thinking, and talking of the conti- nent as one, there are in truth two Australias — two Australias which are likely to modify each other profoundly as they grow to maturity side by side, and which are, also, likely to develop totally different social and political problems. One is temperate Australia, the other is tropical Australia. The life, the commerce, the labour, and consequently the politics, of tropical Australia will of necessity be cast in a different mould from the life, the commerce, the labour, and the politics of temperate Australia. While the frontiers of the southern part of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales appear to be mere accidental lines of political division running through one area which is essentially the same, and therefore effaceable at will, the difference between this district and Northern Queensland, to which no doubt the northern territory of South Australia and West Australia might be added, strikes the stranger as absolutely radical. The climate of New South Wales, Victoria, and southern South Australia varies as does the climate of Yorkshire, Surrey, and Devonshire. Each has its characteristics upon which the inhabitants of each are fortunately ready to congratulate themselves, but to the passing visitor there seems to be only such difference between them as you might easily experience by spending Monday in one part of the United Kingdom and Wednesday in another. Whereas between them and northern Queensland certainly — to take the extremes of the comparison — between Tasmania and northern Queensland there is as much difference as between Italy and Russia. Throughout the whole journey from Adelaide by train, through Melbourne and Sydney, to the Queensland frontier, the features of the scenery are the same. Except where cultivation has modified the natural characteristics, grass and gum forests prevail. But from Brisbane 228 The Australian Outlook. northward the palm intervenes, the hills are clad with cedar, the aspect of the country is completely changed, luxuriant vegetation takes the place of grass upon the coast, and tropical jungle, dense and matted, replaces the scant-leaved gum tree. It is impossible to helieve, as one looks from the windows of the train at the rapidly changing scene, that the habits, aims, and pursuits of the people who occupy the one country can remain for many generations identical with those of the other. The evidences of occupation which present themselves confirm the impression. Instead of the English-looking fruit orchards of South Australia, and the familiar cornlands and vineyards of Victoria and New South Wales, the cultivation which meets the eye in Northern Queensland is of emerald green tracts of sugar cane, ruddy acres of rose-tinted pine- apple, low-growing rice fields, and seemingly limitless banana groves. Mango orchards are common ; strange fruits, such as the pommelo, the chinee-wampee, the Brazilian cherry, and the rose- apple, mix with citrons and cinnamon, papaw and tamarinds, in the gardens. The sweetbriar hedges of New South Wales and the yellow flowering gorse of Tasmania entirely disappear, and slow flowing streams, of which the edges are plumed with palms and the water is often hidden by beds of pink or purple lilies, divide the land. The labourers who are engaged in producing these un- familiar crops are no less strange than the natural features of the country itself. The wiry, auburn-haired Australian, whose pale, regular features and independent glance have im- pressed themselves as the characteristics of a distinct type in the southern colonies, gives place in the furrows of the torrid zone to the South Sea Islander, who has made his concession to civilisation by putting on the blue shirt and trousers issued under Government regulations, to black-hatted industrious Chinese, to Javanese and Japanese, Malays and Singalese, whose bright costumes harmonise with the landscape. And with the exception perhaps of the negro and the Indian coolie, who have not yet made good their footing on the continent, there are specimens to be found in the fields and sugar plantations of almost every type of people accustomed to work under a tropical sun. The jungle which grows upon the richest soil, and defies the efforts of white men to clear it, is almost entirely cleared by China- men, who in return for the service are allowed to rent it at a low rate for a few years. During those years they cultivate various fruits, flowers, and vegetables, many of which are introduced from China an$ Japan. Spices that look like fruits, fruits that taste like The Australian Outlook. 229 spice, and flowers of which the parent stock must surely have grown, one thinks, upon an Oriental screen, decorate their fertile patches, and in spite of a very limited market the owners manage, as white men have told me with disgust, to make a profit where an Englishman would starve. When the short clearing lease is up, the Ckinaman moves on to clear more jungle. He leaves a garden where he found a wilderness, and the European owner of the land is proportionately enriched. Though this practice is common, and the presence of Chinamen in the north is marked by a constant extension of cleared land avail- able for crops, I cannot remember ever to have heard their services recognised with an expression of gratitude. The fact that the service was valuable was not denied, but \" I don't like a Chinaman\" was universally considered to be a sufficient explanation of the absence of any thanks. There was no persecution of them, and apparently, in the north, no strong feeling of annoyance in connec- tion with their presence in the community. The place they filled appeared, so far as I could see, to be that of excellent self-acting machines, who cleared the jungle even more efficiently and cheaply than the Mallee scrub of Victoria and South Australia is cleared by the roller and stump-jumping plough. The position of agricultural implements, and nothing more, is the position at present assigned to the servile races whose labour is made use of in the tropical parts of Queensland. Only, in accordance with the requirements of humanity, and it may be added also of common sense, the care of these living implements is made the subject of very thorough and minute regulations. This brings us at once face to face with one of the problems in the solution of which the statesmanship of tropical Australia is likely to be forced to differ from that of temperate Australia. The business of the politician of temperate Australia will be to regulate the working of a constitution based upon universal suffrage, in which every member of the community, women probably as well as men, will exercise the rights and responsibilities of self-govern- ment. The business of the politician of tropical Australia will, on the contrary, in all probability be to find means by which the affairs of a large servile population may be justly administered by a rela- tively small, and consequently aristocratic, body of white men. In fact, the place of servile races in the world is one of the big questions of future history which temperate Australia may refuse to consider, but to which tropical Australia must join with Africa, Asia, and America in finding an answer? 280 The Australian Outlook. The portion of Queensland of which I am speaking now is princi- pally the strip lying upon the sea-level between the waters of the Pacific and the wall of mountains known as the Old Coast range which divide it from the higher lands of the interior ; but what is true of it applies in general terms to the whole extension of the tropical coast through the northern territory of South Australia and West Australia. It is the sugar district ; it will be some day become the cotton district, the tobacco and the rice district, the coffee and the tea district of an immensely rich Northern Australia. There is no kind of tropical production which does not appear to flourish in profusion when it is introduced. The most important of the present centres of cultivation are along the coast from Brisbane to Bundaberg and north of Bunda- berg, round Eockhampton, Mackay, Townsville, the Burdekin Delta, the Herbert and the Johnstone Eivers and Cairns. This belt of about 1,000 miles practically limits the present area of sugar cultivation, and it is throughout the sugar belt that the cheap labour of alien races is employed. Details of the Kanaka question lie outside my subject to-nigh fc. I will only say there- fore in passing that the outcome of a very careful personal in- quiry into the conditions of their lot has been to convince me that in no country which I have yet visited in any quarter of the globe is the manual labourer so well provided for, so liberally paid, or so carefully safeguarded from oppression, as the South Sea Islander employed in Queensland. Whether it is good for the islands that the majority of their able-bodied population should go away to work upon the mainland is another question. I am not for the moment concerned with it. The difference between a Kanaka, a Javanese, or Malay labouring in the fields under a tropical sun and a white man working under the same conditions is as the difference between a humming-bird and a sick sparrow. The one is as bright as the other is dejected. White men can do profitably a good deal of the lighter and more open work, but when it comes to heavy work under the cane those whom I have questioned have told me more than once that they do not expect to do much more than half the work of a Kanaka. On one small plantation upon which they were employed in about equal numbers, and were all on task work, the Kanakas finished in the morning at half-past ten and in the afternoon at three, while the white labourers with exactly the same amount to do worked in the morning until twelve and in the later part of the day until the moon rose. I was myself in the fields and noted the hour at which the respective tasks were finished. This The, Australian Outlook. 231 fact, combined with the greater reliability of what is generally classed as servile labour, weighs more with employers than actual cheapness. It is a mistake to suppose that the Kanaka is ex- tremely cheap. Employers calculate that they cost about £40 a year, or 15s. a week, each man and woman, and the extremely favour- able conditions under which they are able to live for that sum are consequences of the climate and the cheapness of land and food. It seems on general grounds natural to suppose that labour which is produced in the tropics should be suitable to tropical requirements, and without wishing to prejudge the immediate development of future events, it is to be noted as one of the effects of the late reor- ganisation of the sugar industry that the small growers who are encouraged under the new system to take up land have begun to realise that it pays them better to employ Kanakas and cultivate land for themselves than to work for wages, however good, under someone else. On the Herbert Eiver and in the neighbourhood of Mackay there are already settlements of men who, from the position of ploughmen, carpenters, and labourers, have become owners of farms of 100 or 160 acres in extent, and employ from eight to ten Kanakas apiece, earning for themselves a gross income of £800 to £1,000 a year. When this system becomes universal, and the present race of white labourers becomes converted, as it may, into a future race of white masters, employing coloured labour freely over an immense area, the real difficulties in connection with the regulation of the conditions under which such labour may be employed will be likely to arise. It is perfectly easy to understand in the face of these the reluctance with which the leaders of opinion in temperate Australia are disposed to regard any relaxation of the laws by which the immigration of alien labour is admitted. Men who are accustomed to govern themselves and to respect the self- governing power in others have no wish to complicate their con- stitutional machinery by the introduction of an inferior mass of people who must be both governed and protected. But the developments of history do not wait permanently upon the will of statesmen, however able, nor, we may believe, upon the will of labour parties, however powerful. There are forces of nature so irresistible that the strongest opposition must go down before them, and if such forces are declaring, as some people think they are, for the employ- ment of an inferior by a superior race in Northern Australia, the ability of North Australian statesman will inevitably before long be engaged in finding the means by which the relations of the two 232 The Australian Outlook. races can be most desirably governed. It is scarcely possible to escape the conclusion that if North Queensland obtains the political separation for which it is agitating, the nucleus of the development of tropical Australia will have been formed, and the creation of other tropical Colonies, in which the habits of thought, the aims, and the traditions will differ widely from those of the existing Australian communities, will be only a question of time. I do not wish to be supposed to say, even passingly, that in no part of tropical Australia can the white man work. Behind the coast lands of which I have been speaking comes the mountain wall which may be said roughly to encircle the whole continent. This wall contains the mineral wealth of Australia, and upon it is the white man's throne. In Queensland there are two main plateaux, one at the southern and one towards the northern end of the coast range — both of them some thousands of feet above the sea, both of them of great extent, and both of them eminently suited in soil, climate, natural vealth, and the beauty and charm of their sur- roundings for the settlement of a large white population. All along the range between them the mining centres are fitted for occupation by white races, who can work easily in the dry and bracing air. Behind the wall the interior of the country is one vast extent of rolling grass plain, lightly timbered, where, at present, men are rare, and herds of sheep and oxen, which are to be counted by millions, roam at will. The whole of this vast territory needs only sufficient water to become capable of sustaining multitudes of men. Within the last five years it seems to have become apparent that Nature, so lavish in every other respect, has not omitted this essential gift. She has only stored in the cool depths of the earth what would have evaporated upon the surface, and under the greater part of the sandstone formation immense beds of artesian water have been found. Many of the principal stations have now artesian bores which guarantee their cattle against droughts in the event of the failure of surface water, and few sights on a station are prettier than the enjoyment of the thirsty flocks when the fountain is set playing, and the water allowed to run down its prepared channels for them to drink. At Charleville, where the Government bore had to be carried down for 1,300 feet, the water rises in a magnificent jet of about a hundred feet, and the sunshine playing on the spray creates a perpetual rainbow, under which 3,000,000 gallons can be poured out every day. There are now few important bush townships in which bores are not being sunk, and though as The Australian Outlook, 233 yet the water has been insufficiently utilised, the possibilities which its existence introduces are almost too great in magnitude to be estimated. It is conceivable that what has been hitherto a pastoral country, counting its extent by thousands of square miles instead of acres, may under the influence of these fertilising streams be transformed into an agricultural country with homesteads elbowing each other upon its plains. If this picture of close cultivation were at any future time to become a reality, it is open to question whether the greater part of the heavy work would be most profitably done by white or by coloured labour. The main fact which is, I fancy, beyond dispute to anyone who has had the opportunity of travel in Norther Australia is that if the tropical half of the continent be left free to develop in accordance with the requirements of its nature and situation there are scarcely any limits which could be safely set to the addition which it may make to the wealth of the world. Wealth is the distinctively, to some people the objectionably, modern characteristic of Australia. Whatever some financial critics may say— and I am trying to-night to avoid the introduction of a single figure— the wealth of the continent is simply prodigious. It is not that she has a Mount Morgan mine in which gold seems at a far distant period to have been thrown up from some underground store almost as freely as the water of the Charleville bore is leaping up to-day. It is not that she has a phenomenal horse- shoe of silver at Broken Hill from which something like one-fifteenth of the annual silver output of the world is produced, or that, if all late reports are true, she has a scarcely less remarkable third marvel in the copper deposit of Mount Lyall in Tasmania. It is not that throughout the old rocks of the coast range coal and tin and the more homely minerals alternate with abounding gold ; that fresh beds of mineral wealth are being opened every day ; that diamonds and rubies, topazes and emeralds are scattered through her hills ; that even in the sandstone plains of the interior, where no gems were looked for, opals wait to be picked up ; or that the warm waters which wash her shores bring pearls and coral in their waves. These are mere incidents in her good fortune. Her true wealth lies in the common earth. As with her political, so with her natural history. The virgin continent has spent herself in no efforts in the past. She has produced neither the varied vegetation nor the immense mammalia of the prehistoric periods of the northern hemisphere ; but, isolated by the oceans which surround her, she has remained apart from the general evolution and reserved herself wholly for futurity. The savage races which haunted her western forests had 234 The Australian Outlook. no message of life for her. She has waited for the best that history has produced, and now at last, wedded to cultivation, she seems destined to become the fruitful mother of the wealth of half a world. The climate of Australia is a perpetual summer. There is nothing which can be planted in the soil that will not grow. I have spoken already of the oriental fruits of the tropics. It is almost impossible to speak without what must seem exaggeration of the extraordinary size and beauty of the English fruits which flourish in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. At Orange, in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, I was given cherries, black and white, which seemed more like Orleans plums and those little red and white apples that we see wrapped in silver paper in the fruit- erer's shops, than like any cherries that I had ever seen before. They were exquisite in flavour and sweetness, and the orchards on either side of the roads were weighed down with the heavy crop. In Victoria all the small fruits were equally plentiful and equally fine. By the time I reached South Australia the summer was more ad- vanced, the vintage was beginning, and the country all red and gold with fruit suggested no other comparison than the land of Canaan as we used to read of it in our childhood. Acres of vines spreading up the hill-sides, the summits crowned with chestnut woods and apples, the hollows filled to overflowing with plums and pears, peach trees, apricots and medlars, and every fruit that ripens in an English garden. Olive trees bordered an avenue here and there, and oranges were everywhere showing yellow against the dark green foliage of the orange groves. The Tintara vineyard, of which we see advertisements on all the railway- station walls, is in this portion of South Australia, and a branch vineyard is within an easy drive of Adelaide. On the day on which I visited it the thermometer registered 105° in the shade. In the blazing sun of the hill sides oxen were dragging waggons filled with the white and purple fruit, and I remember gratefully a certain cool, dimly-lighted cellar where on a table beside wine of a kindivhich, with all his enterprise, I may say that Mr. Burgoyne has not yet succeeded in securing for the public, there were heaped bunches of various sorts of grapes. Possibly they were selected bunches ; I only know that when I was asked to take one away I had some difficulty in lifting it, and I was told that it weighed over twenty pounds. Nor could this have been very un- usual, for at the hotel just such a pyramid was put down before me every morning for breakfast. The wine industry of Soutfr Australia points, almost as strongly The Australian Outlook. 235 as the sugar industry of Queensland, the radical difference which exists between the present requirements of temperate and tropical Australia. Both industries promise to be of the utmost importance to the country, both are in every way native to the soil, but while the crying need of the one is at this moment cheap and plentiful labour, the equally pressing necessity of the other is skilled Euro- pean labour. The immense area, the suitable soil, and the pecu- liarly steady climate of Australia, are in every way adapted to the production of wine. It is believed that the very best kinds of European wine can be rivalled there, if not surpassed, and that if the technical perfection of manufacture were once attained, the in- variability of the climatic conditions would almost entirely do away with the European fluctuations of good years and bad years, thus giving to Australian vintages the superiority of unfailing trust- worthiness. If so there would be practically no limits to the value of the trade. But in order to achieve this result the utmost care and knowledge is required for the manufacture of the wine, and the \"successful producers are those who have placed their wine -presses under the supervision of highly-paid European experts. It is felt that the success of the wine industry depends upon the introduction of these experts in sufficient number, and far from any inclination to employ cheap labour in the vineyards, the tendency is rather to place the vines as well as the making of wine under the care of experts. The deliberate intention everywhere expressed was not to compete with the cheap wines of Algeria and other markets of low class labour, but to employ the best labour that could be got, and to do everything which trained intelligence can suggest to produce wine which shall compete with the best wines of the world. Throughout temperate Australia and especially in connec- tion with fruit and wine growing and what is generally known as \" intense culture \" under conditions of artificial irrigation, one of the most interesting movements that is to be observed is the tendency to place upon the land a higher class of intelligence than has ever before been associated with agricultural pursuits. The future \"rustic\" of Australia will be the descendant of two classes who form at present the most striking elements of Australian society. There is the workman who is determined to better his condition and to leave his family in a happier position than that to which he himself was born, but who does not intend to cease to be a workman ; and there is the gentleman who is prepared to accept manual labour, but who dees not intend for that to cease to be a gentleman, These two classes meet on equal terms upon the land, 23G The Australian Outlook. especially in the irrigation colonies where science and training art! useless without the practical quality of industry, and industry alone without intelligence is out of count. Each class has much to learn from the other. In some districts, where neighbours are rare, they intermingle freely. Their material position is already often fairly equal, and it is easy to see in these new groups of population the found- ation of a very valuable society of the future. Much might be said upon irrigation and its effect upon the cul- tivators as well as upon the soil. The general result, as one may study it in Australia, throws rather a curious and interesting light upon the history of some of the oldest civilisations. We were taught when we were young that the reason why the populations of Egypt, India, and certain portions of Asia Minor were so much more early civilised than the inhabitants of Northern Europe was that the soil of those countries being fertile the necessaries of life were more easily obtained, and people began soon to have leisure to develop their higher powers. Exactly the same process is now at work on those portions of new land, of which the fertility is doubled or trebled by means of irrigation ; but it is not only the fact that necessaries are easy to procure which gives men leisure, and disposes them to the higher forms of cultivation. It is that on highly productive land a much smaller portion suffices for the maintenance of a given number of persons ; consequently men live nearer together, and they are able to employ their leisure in social intercourse, which is at once natural and mutually stimulating. It is a feature of life in new countries which is, I think, worth dwelling upon, especially from the point of view of young Englishmen, and I hope some day English women, who may go from the accustomed amenities of a closely populated country to settle in the Colonies. It is to be observed in its highest development in irrigation settlements where land will yield a return of <£30 an acre, and ten acres will support a modest family. But it is also generally true as between the pastoral and the agricultural districts. The pastoral districts are those in which, for any reason, land has not yet become valuable for other than grazing purposes, and immense tracts are usually held under lease. The largest station which I visited was 1,500 square miles in extent, and carried 500,000 sheep ; the smallest was 220 square miles, and carried 66,000 sheep and 5,000 cattle. Du :ing a drive of 500 miles in the bush, although I was on station land the whole way, I only crossed twelve stations. It is easier to speak of, than to imagine, the oppressive The Australian Outlook. 237 isolation of life without any family ties in the out-stations of those immense estates. Two boundary riders may share a hut. Within a radius of twenty-five miles there may be, perhaps, no other living creatures. One of these men may be a decent fellow, the other a ruffian, or one may be possibly an English gentleman, the other a man who at home would have occupied the position of his father's herd. Their main occupation is to ride for miles and miles every day. They come in at night hungry and tired to find no food cooked till they cook it, no beds made till they make them, no house cleaned till they clean it. Half the time they are too tired. They eat cold meat from yesterday's joints, and roll into unmade beds, glad in the morning to leave the dirty shelter which they have no courage to keep clean. Of course this picture varies. Where a man and his companion chance to be congenial, or where the out-stations, as is the case on some estates, are properly appointed, life may be less disagreeable in its daily detail, but the general facts of solitude and the absence of legitimate pleasure remain. Few men can bear the strain without mental and moral degradation, and I was told again and again by pastoral - ists that nothing would induce them to subject their own sons to the trial. The difference between such a condition of things and the life of the agricultural districts is made very apparent in any of the more closely populated fertile centres of New South Wales, South Australia, or Victoria. Scientific fruit-growing, wine-making, dairying, all offer examples of the best sort of settlement. But nowhere can it be, perhaps, more fairly appreciated than in the new mallee country of Victoria. There in a comparatively remote portion of the Colony, away from the influences of railways and seaports, and under conditions which differ in no other important respect from the conditions of the pastoral industry, it has been found that land which was once thought worthless is admirably fitted for the production of wheat, and farms of from 500 to 1,000 acres are being rapidly taken up. Though the life is necessarily rough, though everything is as new as in three-year-old agricultural settlements it must needs be, there is nothing which need prevent an English or Australian gentleman from sending his son with confidence to earn his living. On the edges of the still uncleared mallee copse little home- steads are springing up side by side, and as the mallee retreats before the advances of the roller and the stump-jumping plough fresh links are added to the chain of civilisation. The fact that VOL. xxv.— 3, T 238 The Australian Outlook. a man can walk across his own five hundred acres and find a neighbour interested in the same pursuits upon the next lot, and that he has a fair chance of counting among all his neighbours at least one or two of his own, or of a perhaps higher mental calibre, makes an extraordinary difference to life. There are books to read, there are papers to discuss, there is your neighbour's opinion to consider. The houses at present are mostly log huts, but they have their flower garden and orchard, their fence and their gate, their pine tree or other distinctive feature. There is no labouring population in the ordinary sense. Everyone is young, and everyone, whether he be a ploughman or an undergraduate, is working for himself. The general tone is of a prosperous, intelli- gent, self-respecting independence, and of a consequently enlarged plane of interest which enables the man who appears to be wholly absorbed by the varieties of American ploughs at one moment to be equally keen upon the diversities of American poets in the next. One of the needs of the society appeared to me to be young unmarried women, and in visiting the homesteads and finding young men engaged, as they easily may be, in washing dishes, scrubbing kitchen tables, feeding the fowls, or attending to the flower garden, one cannot but think that for such colonisation as this there would be a good deal to say in favour of allowing the girls of big families to accompany their brothers. Many and many an English girl who, unless she marries, has no other prospect at home than to be a governess or a telegraph clerk, would, I believe, be glad to go out under the safe guardianship of her brother, sharing his hardships, mitigating the first loneliness of the great wrench, which is the cause perhaps of more of the recklessness of young Englishmen abroad than has ever been admitted, and taking her part in that most entertaining of natural interests, the creation of a home. No healthy, sensible girl fears work. It is the dulness of the left-behind which makes so many of those whose circum- stances are not altogether prosperous discontented. Such a settlement as that of the mallee country in Victoria is essentially characteristic of temperate Australia. The rich lands of Northern Queensland allow of even closer settlement, for 100 acres under sugar will probably give as valuable a return as 1,000 acres under wheat. This close settlement will not fail to produce a high level of civilisation of its own, but the employment of an inferior class of labour not only introduces an entirely new element of population, it will evidently modify to a very considerable extent the character of the governing race. If any conclusions as to the The Australian Outlook. 239 future may be drawn from existing indications, I should say that temperate Australia is destined to represent the democratic, and tropical Australia the aristocratic, forces of the continent. It will, of course, be objected that the labour party is as strong in Northern Queensland as in any other portion of Australia, and that, far from being aristocratic in her tendencies, the danger is that Northern Queensland should be entirely controlled by the labour vote. It may be so, but it seems difficult to believe that the intel- ligent Australian labourer, converted into an employer, will resist any more than his predecessors, under more or less similar circum- stances, have resisted natural influences which tend to develop the aristocratic sentiment. He will find himself a landowner, a master, a voter, a producer of wealth, in other words a member of a privileged class enjoying certain dignities and acknowledging certain responsibilities. The instincts of a leader are not so difficult to cultivate in men of English race that they are likely under such conditions to remain dormant. Australia has already given us a democracy which is good. It is within the possibilities of her future that she may yet give us an aristocracy which is better, Looking at the broad issues of Australian history the division of the continent into tropical and temperate appears to me to be the great political, and land settlement the great social, question of the future. These two either include wholly or affect all the more familiar subjects of controversy or discussion with which we are occupied every day. The sessions of the Australian Parliaments in the year which has just closed were almost entirely taken up with questions of finance and land settlement. It is because the lesson of the crisis has been that finance and land settlement are, in fact, the same things. I have tried to touch for a moment on the principal sources of Australian wealth. All of them are in the soil. What Australia needs is that they should be dug out of the soil, and so placed upon the markets of the world. How best to get labour into direct operation upon her natural wealth is the problem which she has set herself to solve. She is attempting it in ways which have not yet been tried elsewhere. The Bills for the establishment of village settlements, co-operative communities, -homestead associations, and labour colonies which passed into law last year are nearly all of them accompanied by provisions under which Government funds may be used to advance loans on mortgage to cultivators desirous of taking up the land. The theory of the movement is that, as the Government T 2 240 The Australian Outlook. has everything to gain by the improved value that labour will give to the land, it runs practically no financial risk in putting labour under certain carefully defined conditions upon the land. If this theory be proved to be correct, and the movement should take dimensions of any importance, the back of the unemployed difficulty will be broken not only for Australia but for the Empire. As the problem stands at present, we have on the one side in all crowded centres a surplus of hands and a deficiercy of bread and money. Mr. Giffens's statistics go, I think, to prove that we pro- duce every day in England alone 1,200 pairs of arms more than we want, assuming the present density of population to be sufficient. We have on the other side in the outlying portions of the Empire immense beds of natural wealth : corn and meat and wine and gold are waiting only for hands to bring them out of the earth in which they lie. The question is one of intelligent organisation. How to get this labour on to that land ? If it were solved our surplus pairs of arms should become no less valuable as an export to us than surplus wool or mutton is to Australia. It seems incon- ceivable that with the factors of the sum so plain, and the need to find the solution so pressing, it should remain for ever without an answer. Australia, at least, is making a vigorous attempt to find the answer. The want of capital, it is said, is the great difficulty. Again, intel- ligence replies that capital to invest in a really profitable enterprise can never be long wanting. Apart this labour and that wealth are useless. Together they become practically priceless, and can well afford to pay for the little link which joins them. Australia, where the wealth that is in her soil is better known than it can be any- where else, has not feared to act upon this view. The little link is to be supplied. The cultivator, it is presumed, will in his bettered circumstances be able to repay both capital and interest. But if the experiment succeeds, Australia will want labour for generations to come. There will be an end of the refusal to admit the working man. He will be a factor in the sum of national wealth. His presence will be as much desired as it is now in some circles dreaded. For he will no longer hang about the towns dividing with an already overstocked labour market the small amount of what may be called secondary employment, which the wants of civilisation provide for those who have the skill to satisfy them. He will go straight out upon the land and produce wealth where there was none before. There need be practically no limit to the employment of this class of labour until every acre of unoccupied The Australian Outlook. 241 land is not only taken up, but producing all that science and nature can enable it to produce. I have tried to show that in temperate Australia the labour which is likely to be employed upon land will be of an in- creasingly high intellectual level. I think it can hardly be doubted that the conditions of agricultural occupation will tend more and more to become agreeable, and it is easily conceiv- able that if these State experiments in land settlement succeed, and it comes to be generally known in England that an intelligent workman has only to go out to Australia in order to find himself after a few months' residence qualified to take up land under Australian laws, to borrow money upon that land from Government, and then to have a fair chance of working his way to the position of an independent landowner, the first effect of the movement may be to deprive us rather of our better class labouring population than of those nondescript masses who are at present classed under the name of \" the unemployed.\" It will be in the first instance our loss, and correspondingly Australia's gain. But if by such a general moving onwards a lower layer of English labour rises to take the place from which in the present fierce press of competition it is squeezed out, and room is made by a natural easing of the situation for inferior labour in the cheap ranks, to which alone it can aspire, a very great contribution will surely have been made to the settlement of the social questions that now agitate the world. I have, I hope, indicated some reasons for believing that the Australian outlook is one which promises prosperity and interest to Australia, and is at the same time replete with pos- sibilities of general advantage to the Empire. These are the possibilities which render the consideration of Imperial ques- tions so intimately and engrossingly attractive. If it be true, as we are constantly told by social reformers, that the difficulty in such a country as ours is the want of room ; if by expansion we can give the room and then find that the people of our own race in all portions of the world where they are organising the development of this expanded Empire are in very truth providing opportunity for the happier, healthier, more intelligent, and more prosperous life of the multitude ; that natural conditions, instead of being against, are in these circumstances in favour of the majority ; that children born hereafter will have their chances of being born to joy indefinitely increased by the extension of the area of civilisation which this century has witnessed — then, I think, we may legitimately feel that 242 The Australian Outlook. the work of Empire-making is work in which none of us need be ashamed to join. Australia is specially interesting as a field of social development, and I have been asked to-night to speak of Australia. But had I been asked to speak of South Africa or of Canada, there would have been no less to say of the always increasing value of these great Colonial groups. Each has its problems no less interesting than those of Australia, and there is one question common to the out- look of all three which. I cannot quit the subject of the Australian future without touching. It is the question of separation from the Empire. There can be no doubt left in the mind of anyone who has enjoyed the opportunity of free discussion in Australia that it is a subject which occupies much local thought. Some of the best aspirations of the rising generation are centred upon the ideal, which they believe to be a patriotic and disinterested one, of an entirely independent national life. The radical democratic ideal may, I think, generally be said to favour separation. A good deal of the mature liberal thought of Australia preserving the remem- brance of what used to be resented as undue interference from home in local affairs, and not fully recognising perhaps how entirely any desire to interfere has passed from the traditions of the Colonial Office, is disposed also to nourish the belief that the best possibilities of the Australian future can only be attained under conditions of complete freedom from Imperial restrictions. These different currents of thought, although restrained by practi- cal considerations from any possibility of becoming effective, at pre- sent are very strong. They carry with them some of the most thoroughly respect-worthy sections of Australian opinion, and they deserve very serious consideration. Against them there is still, fortu- nately, from the point of view of those of us who care for the preserva- tion of the unity of the Empire, to be put what may, I think, at present be described as a much stronger collective body of opinion in favour of a continuance of the Imperial tie. The question of the future is, Which of these two bodies is likely to gain in strength ? To us, as English people, it is a question which outbalances in importance every other that can be asked about Australia. We should like to know for certain when we speak of Australia whether we are speaking of our own country or not. If not, we must necessarily approach Australian ques- tions in a different spirit. The wonder and the wealth of the new continent will be always interesting, but they will be no longer our concern. If, on the contrary, Australia is to remain with us, and the The Australian Outlook. 243 Empire, at the creation of which we are assisting, is to be the inheritance of our children, it is difficult to conceive of any- thing which concerns us more intimately than the future of this vast estate. The prospect which is involved is equally important to all citizens of the existing Empire. It presents to all of us, whichever portion of the Empire we inhabit, exactly the same alternative of being the citizens of a greater or a smaller State, and of bearing our part in a greater or a smaller national life. We cannot lose Australia without Australia also losing us. If the question of the predominance of the forces which make for unity or for separation is the most important of all questions for us in the Australian out- look, it is no less important for Australia. I think that few thought- ful Australians would be prepared to give an absolutely decided opinion one way or the other as to the event. All that can be done is to reckon up the forces on either side, and endeavour to clear our minds a little as to the causes which tend to produce or to develop them. Such a task lies beyond the scope of my present Paper, but I would like to mention one among what must have been regarded once as the natural forces making for disintegration, which seems likely to yield more and more to the influences of modern develop- ment. It is the ignorance of the Colonies with regard to each other. I fancy that no traveller round the Empire can fail to be struck with the fact that, while each of the outlying parts knows something of England, and takes interest in what happens at home, none of them know or care anything for each other. Canada knows nothing of Australia, Australia ignores South Africa, South Africa is profoundly indifferent to them both. This state of feeling, if it continued, must end in disintegration. But the signs are hopeful that it will not continue. Not many years ago we were nearly as ignorant here of all the Colonies as they are now of each other. The development of easy and rapid communication, bringing with it an immense increase in our Colonial trade, has relegated that state of things to ancient history. The affairs of the Colonies are watched here now with an interest which grows greater every day. The same causes seem likely to bring about the same result between the Colonies themselves. Inter-Imperial communication is being rapidly developed. In the year which has just closed it has been, for the first time, made possible to travel by steam round the the world without touching any but British territory. The establish- ment of the Canadian- Australian line of steamers between Sydney 244 The Australian Outlook. and Vancouver has clasped the girdle of the Empire, and has already so stimulated the intercourse between Canada and Australia that the demand for cable communication across the Pacific has become urgent. A scheme has been drawn up for the construction of it which may or may not be practical. That is a question for experts to decide. A conference in any case is to assemble in Canada in June to consider the possibility of providing funds from the Colonial exchequers for the execution of the scheme if accepted. If this year is to give us the beginning of cable communication between two great groups of Colonies across the Pacific, and the establishment, as it is hoped that it may do, of a new fast line of Atlantic steamers from an English to a Canadian port, besides bringing to successful fruition some of the schemes for an extended trade with each other and with us that Colonial Governments have been active in de- veloping, a big step will have been made in the direction of Imperial unity. To know each other better is, I strongly believe, all that we need in order to realise how impossible it is to let each other go. Channels of communication, if this is so, are at once the gentlest and the strongest, the most insidious and the most irresistible of the bonds of union, and it is hardly possible in this connection to exaggerate the importance of the development of inter-Imperial intercourse. It may be that every one of the great groups of Colonies contains all the elements that go to the building up of nations, and that the desire which they experience for a national life is legitimate and inevitable. If so, this is no reason for separation. It has been the pride of British administration that it has known how to nourish the dignity and respect the independence of its subjects in all parts of the world. In dealing with the developments of the future the word finality has no place. And if we are to have unity in no other form, a race which has already given to history the United States of America has no need to flinch from an ideal of the United Nations of Great Britain. DISCUSSION. Sir JAMES GARRICK, K.C.M.G. : I consider myself extremely fortunate in having had the opportunity of hearing Miss Shaw's Paper, but after all it is but an additional contribution — but one more link in the chain of important services Miss Shaw has rendered not only to Australasia but to all the Colonies of this Empire for several years past. Miss Shaw had available in this The Australian Outlook. 245 country the very best sources of information with respect to Australasia. This information was derived not only from books and statistics but from personal sources, and all of us who repre- sented the Colonies in this country had at all times the greatest pleasure in communicating to Miss Shaw all we ourselves knew, and in placing at her disposal official information, so that she might go forth as completely equipped as possible, as representative of the Colonies in the press of England. But I am glad to say Miss Shaw resolved to see for herself, and I wish many of our public men would follow her in this. She determined to see whether all she had heard and read could be justified. For all who are interested in the Colonies, I think her visit was a piece of good fortune, for there resulted from it a series of articles wonder- fully complete and accurate. Queensland was almost conspicuously dealt with. I hardly know whether Miss Shaw liked our Colony or not, but I do know, though I dare not say in her presence, what golden opinions she won from all politicians and from all sorts and conditions of colonists during her sojourn there. She honoured the Colony by giving it wide notice in her letters. So much was I impressed with what she said on several leading matters that, on my own initiative, afterwards sanctioned by my own Government, I circulated them broadcast in this country. We who are inter- ested in Australasia do not want persons to see only with our eyes — to hold, as it were, a brief for us. On the other hand, we do object to persons forming their impressions first and then en- deavouring to write up to them afterwards. What we seek is intelli- gent but impartial criticism, and I am glad to say that in Miss Shaw we have found a critic intelligent and impartial, and we are satisfied with the representations she has felt herself justified in making, though we may not in every particular agree with these. I do not intend to go through the many matters Miss Shaw has dealt with, but I had a little curiosity to know how she would steer her course, and I could not help feeling she was right in avoiding what I may say is, at the present moment, the barren track of financial criticism and Australasian extravagance. In one paragraph of the Paper, Miss Shaw says : \" The extraordinary elasticity with which Australia has recovered from a financial crisis that might have been expected to throw her back for a generation is for the moment a sufficient illustration of what I mean.\" I can only say I hope our hostile critics have arrived at the opinion Miss Shaw has indicated ; but if they have not, Miss Shaw has clearly pointed out the course which, even in the opinion of the persons to whom I refer, must pull us 246 The Australian Outlook. out of the difficulties into which they allege we have got. She says truly that what we have to do is to develop our resources, now we have learnt two lessons. We admit freely that both people and Governments of the Australian Colonies have been extravagant. We also admit we have neglected those resources Miss Shaw has so eloquently described. We have made resolutions that we will be prudent. W7e have resolved to devote ourselves energetically to the development of the great estate we have the good fortune to possess. It is not merely a resolution, however, for both Governments and people are striving to live within their means, and they are doing it ; and, next, they are learning not to live on money derived from this country, but, rather, on the resources extracted from Nature herself. Having resolved on these two things, and pursuing them, there is no doubt whatever, I think, that we shall arrive, even in the opinion of hostile critics, at that state of soundness and prosperity we never perhaps should have lost. Miss Shaw's ideal is the unity of the Empire. For myself, looking at the map of the vast territory we possess, I cannot say — no man can say — what will be the ultimate position of the great Colonies ; but I do say that, so far as one can at present see, there is a sufficient field for the efforts of the most ardent patriot in assisting to consolidate the great Empire of which we are a part. Sir SAUL SAMUEL, K.C.M.G., C.B. : I am quite certain you will agree with me that we have this evening heard a most able and eloquent Paper, the result of Miss Shaw's visit to Australia. Those who know those Colonies must have marvelled at the extra- ordinary way in which that lady travelled over the country, in a manner very few men would have done, encountering and defying difficulties which would have been faced with reluctance by expe- rienced bushmen. She has acquired information with which very few people, even those long resident in the Colonies, are acquainted, and she has imparted this to us this evening in a manner which must be agreeably surprising to all present. I notice Miss Shaw speaks of Australia as not having a past — not having a history. Now from one point of view I think Australia has a marvellous history. I can recollect — and I am not a very old man — when the whole population of Australasia was only 120,000 ; now it is 4,000,000 ; when New South Wales was, in fact, all Australia, and the other Aus- tralian Colonies had no existence on the map of the world. I can remember too the time when the whole trade was not more than £120,000 ; it now amounts to £°120,000,000. Is not this a wonderful progress — a history of which any country may be proud ? It is said The Australian Outlook. 247 the Australasian Colonies are indebted to the extent of £200,000,000 ; hut what has heen done with this? We have settled 4,000,000 people on the lands of the country, and we have made a trade for Eng- land, which has benefited the old country as much as the Colonies. Miss Shaw has proved herself a true friend to the Colonies, as by her able writings in her articles in the Times she has set forth some facts with regard to the Colonies which were an able defence against the libellous publications in which the Australasian Colonies were traduced in a manner almost unparalleled ; and not satisfied with having brought ruin on many thousands of people, some of these writers are now trying to produce the same effect in this country by their attacks on the Bank of England. The financial panic in the Australian Colonies has been indeed most serious ; but their recuperative power is so great that already they are recovering, and the capitalists of the Mother Country have regained confidence, and the securities of Australia are now favourite stocks on the English market. On behalf of the Colony I represent I beg to thank Miss Shaw most sincerely for the valuable Paper she has so eloquently read to us this evening. Lieut-General Sir ANDREW CLARKE, G.C.M.G., C.B., C.I.E. : I should have liked to have seen this assembly depart after the reading of the Paper with the echoes of Miss Shaw's eloquent words still vibrating in their ears, so that the impression might not be in any degree blurred and obliterated by subsequent discussion. That is my own feeling in the matter. But being called upon as the repre- sentative of a Colony and of a country with which more than nearly forty years ago I had some little to do I could not fail to respond to the challenge. I will only say, with reference to this very remarkable Paper, that I look on that Paper as the beneficial result of Miss Shaw's mission from this country to the Australian Colonies, and that it will be regarded there as constituting an additional tie with the Mother Country. It is not only a practical Paper ; it is, what is much more important, a highly sympathetic Paper ; and sympathy in these matters does much more to build up an Empire than any mere piling up of the facts of progress and prosperity. I shall content myself, then, with offering to Miss Shaw, on behalf of the Colony I represent, our grateful thanks for what she has done in tho heart of the Empire this night. This Paper has, with reference to the Australian Colonies, great signifi- cance, and, further, I believe that within its four corners are con- tained elements which, properly applied by thoughtful and foreseeing statesmen, will be fruitful in guiding the destinies of this Empire 248 The Australian Outlook. as a whole, and binding still closer together its various parts ill union and common sympathy. Mr. SANDFOBD FLEMING, C.M.G. : As I am perhaps the last arrival from Australia, I feel that I should be among the first to express the pleasure I have had in listening to the remarkable Paper which has just been read, full of thought, full of information, and clothed in the most graceful language. I must, however, leave to other speakers, better fitted to perform it, the pleasant duty of saying how much we are indebted to the lady who has just addressed us. I will simply remark that I was passing through London from Aus- tralia to Canada, and hearing of Miss Shaw's Paper delayed my departure until the morrow in order to hear it, and I have been amply rewarded for remaining longer in London. I am full of the subject myself, and would like to say a great deal about Australia, a country of amazing natural wealth and wonderful possibilities. I should like, too, to refer to my cordial reception in every Colony I visited — Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Aus- tralia— and express my deep regret that the time at my disposal did not admit of visiting all the Colonies, more especially New Zealand. I will confine my remarks, and they will be but a few words, to the concluding sentences of the Paper. I quite agree with Miss Shaw that Canada and Australia know practically nothing of each other ; and why do they know so little ? Did they not spring from the same origin ? Do they not speak the same language ? Are they not goveined by the same laws ? Have they not the same aspira- tions ? And under the same flag do they not look forward to having the same mission and destiny ? To realise the noblest hopes of these now separated peoples they should, as Miss Shaw has so well pointed out, be united as closely as possible by the best means of intercourse which science and art can devise. It is felt that by thus drawing these two great divisions of the Empire nearer to- gether both will be brought nearer to the heart of the Empire here in these little islands. The first practical steps have been taken to accomplish this end. A line of excellent steamers has been established, and in some respects these steamers are the best if they are not the largest I have ever travelled in. It is hoped before long to have even faster steamers and many more of them. One thing more is needed — a cable across the Pacific Ocean is of primary importance, and practical steps in that direction have like- wise been taken. The Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce, Mr. Bowell, has been on a visit to Australia in relation to trade and telegraphic connection, and nothing could have been heartier than The Australian Outlook. 249 the reception given by everyone to his proposals. The outcome of it all is that a conference is to take place in Canada in a few months, when Australian statesmen will among other things see before them a great object lesson, which will be of service to them at home. They will see a number of provinces once disunited and separated now united to each other in a great Dominion, and they will return to the southern hemisphere imbued with that spirit of union which will enable them to carry out what they so much require — federation among themselves. Mr. J. F. HOGAN, M.P. : I think there will be absolute unanimity in the opinion that the first contribution of a lady to the Proceed- ings of the Royal Colonial Institute has been an unqualified success, and that, as regards literary merit, closeness of reasoning, careful collection of facts, and well-informed soundness of judgment, the Paper we have just heard read need fear no comparison with any of the Papers contributed by the many distinguished men who have appeared on the platform of the Institute during the past twenty- five years. Most of us have no doubt read the admirable series of \" Letters from Australia \" which Miss Shaw recently contributed to the Times — a journalistic performance calculated to make the most gifted of male special correspondents feel somewhat uneasy as to the retention of their laurels. In the Paper of this evening Miss Shaw bases a forecast of the Australian future on the observations and impressions gathered during her extensive Colonial tour. The forecast, coming as it does from a very acute observer, and the pos- sessor of the latest first-hand information on the Australia of the present, is certainly entitled to the highest respect and attention. To me the most interesting and striking portion of Miss Shaw's forecast is the distinction she draws between temperate and tropical Australia, and the different lines on which they are likely to develop. To those like myself who have spent most of their lives in Australia, and have insensibly come to regard it as a homo- geneous continent, this distinction has not appealed very directly as an element of special importance in estimating the prob- abilities of the future ; but Miss Shaw has certainly given the case a new and important complexion, and provided us with much food for thought. I agree with Miss Shaw in the opinion that the problem of transplanting the surplus labour of the Mother Country to the fertile, far-reaching, and now untenanted plains of interior Australia is one that should not be regarded as im- possible of solution. No doubt there are difficulties in the way, but they are difficulties that earnest-minded and far-seeing statesmen 250 The Australian Outlook. both in Great Britain and Australia could soon brush aside if fully resolved on co-operating in this great Imperial duty. As Miss Shaw truly says, \" the question is one of intelligent organisation.\" With respect to Miss Shaw's concluding remarks on the possibility of the severance of Australia from the Empire, I am disposed to think that she has somewhat exaggerated the strength of the republican sentiment. It is no doubt true that a certain amount of cheap and irrepressible republicanism finds vent at the meetings of the Aus- tralian Natives' Associations ; but too much importance must not be attached to these undisciplined ebullitions and soaring aspirations of ardent Colonial youth. It would also be a great mistake to draw hasty conclusions from the fact that the one Australian republican weekly — the Sydney Bulletin— h&a a large circulation all over the continent. Not one reader in a hundred glances .at or is in the least impressed by its republican editorials. People purchase it because it is a lively, original, up-to-date journal, packed with items of news and personal gossip not accessible elsewhere. I believe that in the future, as in the past, public opinion in Australia will be over- whelmingly in favour of the maintenance of the Imperial connection. Apart altogether from patriotic and sentimental motives, it is not likely that the great body of thinking and intelligent Australians, knowing that France and Germany have secured footholds in their waters, and that Russia is within striking distance in the North Pacific, will lightly cast off that Imperial protection which is now the surest and the strongest guarantee for the peace, progress, and prosperity of all our great Colonies. The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of BRISBANE : I entirely sym- pathise with the remarks of a previous speaker in one point, viz. that we should have done well if after hearing Miss Shaw's Paper we had departed in silence, and not have allowed our attention to be diverted by any subsequent remarks. As one thinks of the Paper, one may contrast its thoughtful utterances with those inflictions from which we sometimes suffer at the hands of some who are com- monly known as \" globe-trotters.\" Too often it has been the case that persons have come to Australian shores, and enjoyed Australian .hospitality for a few days, and then have gone home, deeming them- . selves competent to write an exhaustive account of Australia and the Australians. Miss Shaw has happily taught us a very different lesson. Not only has she in the most painstaking manner investi- gated all the facts for herself, but she has shown, moreover, that she is possessed of that penetration which sees at once the bearing of the facts ; and her Paper, which none of us can forget, lays us The Australian Outlook. 251 under a deep obligation. If we were to sum up in a single sentence the practical and immediate outcome of the Paper, it would be this, that the primary need of Australia, as a condition of advance, is more population. I lay stress on that, because from my own experience I know that, particularly among the working classes, there is at this moment a great delusion prevalent, viz. that there are too many people in Australia, — and, indeed, some few are finding their way back. Now, I think that Miss Shaw's Paper has made it abundantly clear that what we are suffering from is rather the absence of adequate population — population of the right sort. You have sometimes, perhaps, sent out to your Colonies persons of the wrong sort. There are persons who come out — I will not say that they expect to pick up gold in Queen Street, for they do not expect to take so much trouble. They expect to lean against the lamp-post at the street corner, while somebody else picks it up and hands it to them. If we were to get consignments of the better class of labour — men fitted for the work which waits to be done — we should begin to solve some of those problems which still await solution. I join with those who have already spoken in tendering to Miss Shaw— whom it was my privilege to meet in Queensland — our most sincere thanks for her eminently suggestive and valuable Paper. Mr. H. B. HALLENSTEIN (New Zealand) : The substance of what I had intended to say has already been expressed by previous speakers, and I will therefore detain you for only one moment to say that, having resided for something like forty years in Australia and New Zealand, and travelled a great deal through those countries, I can bear testimony to the very able manner in which Miss Shaw has treated the subject. I have seen the ups and downs of New Zealand, which some years ago passed through a similar crisis to that which has been experienced by the Australian Colonies, and I am able to say that in my opinion Miss Shaw has well gauged the future of Australia. Sir ROBERT G. W. HERBERT, G.C.B. : I am obliged to our Chair- man for giving me the opportunity of saying how cordially I endorse all the compliments paid this evening to Miss Shaw. I have had some peculiar opportunities of observing Miss Shaw's remarkable ability in acquiring information in regard to Colonial problems, and her great capacity in solving them. When I was at the Colonial Office she used occasionally to visit me for the purpose of seeking such explanations as I might be able to give her, but those visits generally resulted in my receiving some of that information which, 252 The Australian Outlook. you have been led to understand, Downing Street is generally defi- cient in. Miss Shaw has devoted herself most successfully to Colonial policy, and she has given us to-night, as you see, a very thoughtful and statesmanlike exposition of the Australian situation. It must be the feeling of all members of this Institute. I think that the day may not be long distant when she will give us her observa- tions with regard to some other principal group of Colonies ; we shall look forward to that day with impatient interest. I do not think Miss Shaw has it in her heart to refuse us, although, of course, we must not trespass upon her good nature by pressing her to reappear here at too early a date. I will not attempt to follow in detail the admirable Paper we have heard to-night, because, as the Lord Bishop of Brisbane has observed, the Paper is one which we should do well to take home with us, and seriously ponder over before attempting any criticism of it. The CHAIRMAN : It now becomes my duty to propose that you should give a hearty vote of thanks to the eloquent and gifted lady who has addressed us this evening. Every speaker has declared how admirably Miss Shaw has dealt with the question, and this must be also the impression of everyone present. For myself I feel that no words of mine can definitely express my enthusiastic admiration for Miss Shaw's splendid Paper, which will form one of the most valuable, as well as instructive, contributions to the archives of the Royal Colonial Institute. In the name of all present to-night I beg to offer her our best and warmest thanks. Miss SHAW : I cannot thank you enough for the extremely kind reception you have given me to-night. I can only say that it is a continuation of the kindness and help which I have received everywhere, both at home and in the Colonies, and without which it would have been impossible for me to do my work. And now you will, I am sure, join with me in a most cordial vote of thanks to Sir Frederick Young for so kindly presiding over our proceedings. The Chairman having responded, the Meeting terminated. 253 NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS RELATING TO THE COLONIES AND INDIA. (By JAMES R. Boos6, Librarian E.C.I.) AUSTRALASIA. The Antipodean : an Illustrated Annual. Edited by George Essex Evans, and John Tighe Ryan. 8vo. Pp. 116. London : Chatto & Windus. 1893. (Price Is.) This annual, which made- its first appearance last year, continues to maintain its high tone and interesting records of Australian life and character. The Editors have been fortunate in securing the co-operation of many of the leading literary men of Australasia, the result being a collection of stories, sketches, and verse of a characteristically Australasian tone, colour, and flavour, racy of the soil, and, with one exception, a work of Colonial writers and artists only. Amongst the Authors are such well-known names as Rolf Boldrewood, Eobert Louis Stevenson, Sir Charles Lilley, Nat Gould, Ernest Favenc, &c., whilst the stories comprise such subjects as \"Travel Scenes and Fugitive Thoughts in Maoriland,\" \"An Australian Pantomiiie,\" \" Eacing in Australia,\" \"Art at the Antipodes,\" \"A Tale of the Western Desert,\" &c. The illustrations, which are very numerous, are well drawn, and the general turn-out of the work all that could be desired. Fraser, Malcolm A. C. — Western Australian Year-look for 1892-93. 8vo. Pp. viii-275. Perth. 1893. The present edition of this annual has been considerably enlarged, and now contains a comprehensive account of the history and resources of the Colony, which has been thoroughly revised and brought up to date. Owing to the recent development of the mineral resources of the Colony the section devoted to that subject embodies a very complete account of the recent discoveries of gold and other minerals which has been contri- buted by Mr. H. P. Woodward, the Government Geologist. Other subjects of equal interest to those outside the Colony, viz. its financial position, immigration, fisheries, agriculture, &c., are all treated in a masterly manner by the Editor, who occupies the position of Registrar- General of the Colony. A new map has been added, containing useful VOL. XXV,— 3, U 254 Notices of Neto Books. and accurate information regarding the land divisions, gold fields, stock routes, agricultural areas, steam and mail routes, railways open and in course of construction, telegraphs, lighthouses, rainfall, &c. As a work of reference the Year-book will be found useful alike to persons living within the Colony or at a distance, and more especially to that increasing number of persons who are looking to Western Australia as a field for investment and settlement. Parsons, Harold G. — A Handbook to Western Australia and its Gold Fields. 12mo. Pp. 134. London : Swan Sonnenschein &Co. 1894. The Author of this handbook makes no claifn to originality, but frankly states that he has been mainly dependent upon the Year-books of the Registrar- General, the Eeports of the Government Geologist, and of the Agriculture Commission, as well as the Blue-books and Official Keturns of the several departments for the information which he has embodied. The Compiler commences by giving a description of the various towns of the Colony, and then deals seriatim with its agricultural and pastoral resources — wine-growing, forest resources, geology, and the various gold fields scattered throughout the Colony, including the Kimberley, Murchison, Ashburton, Coolgardie, &c. Regarding the latter, which has recently attracted so much attention both in England and Australia, the Author states that in August last there were about 3,000 men at and about Coolgardie, with new arrivals reaching the Colony at the rate of several hundreds a week. Alluvial gold was found in various parts of the district ; but, as has so often been the case in other parts of the Colony, much difficulty was experienced from the outset in obtaining water even for drinking. This difficulty is now gradually being overcome, and the output of gold rapidly increasing ; in fact, it is stated that of late the total returns from Western Australia were twice as large as were the returns from South Africa seven years after the gold fever first set in there. Mr. Parsons embodies also some useful information regarding work and wages, cost of living, &c., together with many hints of use to those contemplating settlement in the country. Stones1 Wellington, Hawkes Bay, and Taranaki Directory, and- Neio Zealand Annual, 1893-94. 8vo. Pp. xxvi-790, Dune- din : Stone, Son & Co. (Price 12s. Gd.) The enterprising Publishers of this directory have considerably increased the scope of the present issue of the work by embodying much additional information regarding the districts named in the title. In compiling such a work considerable care has to be taken in order to render it complete, and so of service to the general inquirer ; but the information embodied is stated to have been obtained by means of a house-to-house canvass, as Notices of New Books* 255 -.veil as from official sources. The work is not confined to a simple directory, but embraces separate directories of the trades, municipalities, societies, &c,, containing local information which is difficult of access elsewhere. The New Zealand Annual, which is attached, comprises a comprehensive and useful almanac, and a vast amount of commercial, statistical, and general information relating to the Colony as a whole. The work is one which cannot fail to prove of great value to the com- mercial man as well as tp that section of the general public in any way having dealings, or connected, with New Zealand. Eomilly, Hugh H. (C.M.G.)— Letters from the Western Pacific and Hashonaland, 1878-91. 8vo. Pp. xii-384. London: David Nutt. 1893. (Price 7s. Gd.) The letters of Hugh Bomilly which are contained in this work will be read with considerable interest by his numerous friends in various parts of the world. They contain incidents in the life of one who, had he lived, would undoubtedly have risen to high distinction in connection with the Colonial Empire of Great Britain. In an able introduction Lord Stanmore bears testimony to the great ability displayed at all times and under various circumstances by Mr. Eomilly whilst a member of his staff. He states : \" He had a quick intelligence, great physical strength, and an easy temper, and he knew how both to obey and command,\" qualities most needed in the administration, of a rough country. Hugh Eomilly, being imbued with a spirit of adventure, set forth in 1879, at the age of twenty- three, to seek his fortune in the islands of the Pacific, an opportunity having offered itself of accompanying Sir Arthur Gordon (now Lord Stanmore) in his capacity of Governor of the Colony of Fiji. He started with no official position of any sort, and no very definite prospect beyond looking about him in the young Colony. After, however, a space of six months an official position as stipendiary magistrate of a district in the Colony was given him, and from that moment his future career was practically ensured. The duties of a magistrate in Fiji at that time were most varied, many of them being far from unimportant, and necessitating continual travel through many of the islands of the South Pacific. In this way Mr. Romilly was enabled to visit in an official capacity the Friendly Islands, Eotumah, Samoa, &c., and many of the letters from those islands are well worthy of perusal, containing interesting details — in some instances of little importance, although amusing — of events in con- nection with the history and administration of the islands. The year 1881 finds Mr. Eomilly holding the position of Deputy Commissioner of the Western Pacific, in which capacity he made his first acquaintance with New Guinea and the adjacent islands, and in which country so many of his future years were spent, and where he temporarily assumed charge of the protectorate. Mr. Eomilly's references to the position occupied by Queensland in regard to New Guinea are both u 2 256 Notices of New Books. instructive and entertaining reading. It is needless to say that a large section of the Queensland press, as well as many of the prominent officials of the Colony, were especially bitter against him for the opinions expressed on more than one occasion. After taking an active part in the adminis- tration of the new Colony of New Giiinea, Mr. Komilly was appointed Consul in the New Hebrides, a position he did not hold for any length of time ; in fact, on being told that he was to receive the appointment he states in one of his letters that he had no wish to gp into the consular service, and would sooner remain in New Guinea than live in the New Hebrides. After enjoying a well-earned rest in England, Mr. Komilly was attracted to South Africa by the reports of the discovery of gold in Mashonaland and the opening up of that country by the British South Africa Chartered Company. Various expeditions were being organised to proceed through the country in search of gold and farming land, and amongst others was one promoted by a small syndicate largely interested in the Chartered Company. The command of this expedition was offered to Mr. Romilly, whose letters regarding the country &c. possess considerable interest at the present time. The work is edited by Mr. S. H. Komilly, who contri- butes a chapter setting forth the chief incidents in the life of his brother, who at the age of thirty-six succumbed to one of the many attacks of malarial fever,[from which, after his long residence in New Guinea, he never was entirely free.
