        "text": "THE BULLETIN\n\nVol. 2.—No. 20.\n\nSYDNEY, SATURDAY, JUNE 12, 1880.\n\nPrice—3d.\n\n®lje §nl(dut.\n\nSATURDAY, JUNE 12, 1880.\n\nMr. Dillon and Judge Meymott.\n\nIt is satisfactory to find that a man of the in-\n\ntellectual capacity and judicial attainments of\n\nAir. Davis has been appointed to enquire into\n\nthe charges against Judge Meymott ; and the\n\nfact that to so capable a commission has been dele-\n\ngated this most onerous and important duty se-\n\ncures the community and Judge Meymott\n\nagainst a danger with which they might under\n\nother circumstances have been seriously threa-\n\ntened. An article appeared the other day in a\n\nSydney paper stating that it was not intended to\n\nconfine the commission appointed in connexion\n\nwith Mr. Dillon’s charges to evidence taken in\n\naccordance with the rigid laws which regidate\n\nthe reception of testimony in our courts of jus-\n\ntice. In other words, the public were informed\n\nthat to the gentleman or gentlemen composing the\n\nboard of enquiry was to be given a roving com-\n\nmission, empowering the examination of wit-\n\nnesses of all kinds on all sorts of subjects,\n\nwhether directly connected or not with the\n\ncharges under investigation. Nmv we know\n\nnothing of Judge Meymott or his doings be-\n\nyond what has been related in the news-\n\npapers. We are aware that popular feeling is\n\nagainst him, and we are therefore extremely de-\n\nsirous that that his ease shall be dealt with on a\n\nbasis which which will ensure his receiving fair\n\nplay. Judging from various statements which\n\nhave been made in the Assembly and Press, it\n\nwould appear that Government are bent on treat-\n\ning the indicted official after a style which must\n\ninevitably place him, whatever be the merits of\n\nhis defence, in a very awkward and unfair posi-\n\ntion. Mr. Dillon is, it seems, not to be confined\n\nto specific charges, but every old woman in\n\nthe country is to be invited to appeal' before the\n\nlearned Commissioner and deliver her impeach-\n\nment of the District Court Judge —who will no\n\ndoubt thus be confronted with numberless alle-\n\ngations relating to occurences which took place\n\nyears ago, and which may only be remembered\n\nby those chiefly interested, viz., the accusers.\n\nNearly everyone who has lived long in New South\n\nWales Jmows that there is in the country dis-\n\ntricts a not inconsiderable class to whom judges\n\nand policemen arc specially obnoxious, and whose\n\ndelight it is at all times to impute unworthy mo-\n\ntives to those who make them feel the power of\n\nthe law; and fully appreciating this fact, we are\n\nby no means unprepared for a most wonderful\n\narray of further charges against Judge Mky-\n\nkott. We think that the reception of evidence\n\noutside the charges submitted to Parliament will\n\ngreatly prejudice the judge’s case and unneces-\n\nsarily embarrass a man who is on his trial for\n\nmore than his life. Air. Dillon should submit\n\nspecific charges and be held to them. The justice\n\nwhich the meanest citizen is entitled to in a\n\ncourt of law should not be withheld from the\n\nJudge. Wo say this without for a moment deny-\n\ning that should any one of the allegations brought\n\nforward by Mr. Dillon be substantiated, Judge\n\nMeymott should at once leave the public ser-\n\nvice for ever. The proposed basis of the enquiry\n\nis bad, but it is satisfactory to find that the in-\n\nvestigation will be conducted by an accomplished\n\nlawyer and not by a layman.\n\nChurches and Hotels.\n\nWhat may happen to a man in New South Wales\n\nis forcibly shown by the experience of Bernard\n\nBogan, of AVoolloomooloo, the frequency and\n\nunsuccessful ness of whoso applications for a\n\npublican’s license have passed into a proverb.\n\nBogan, concerning whose case innumerable letters\n\nhave reached us, wants to obtain a license for very\n\nfine and commodious premises, but a» these happen\n\nto be near a church — though, so far as wo cun\n\nlearn, not in such close proximity to the place of\n\nworship in question as to render the granting of\n\na license peculiarly offensive —his application\n\nmeets with strenuous opposition. It cannot be\n\ndenied that as matters at present stand there is\n\nbut little in common between sermons and\n\nwhisky, and wo therefore do not impute the\n\nslightest blame to those who conscientiously\n\noppose Bogan’s application on the ground that\n\npublic-houses should not stand near churches.\n\nBut the one feature in Bogan’s case deserving\n\nof special notice is the means which have been\n\nemployed to prevent him from attaining his long-\n\nsought object, and which means, it must be\n\naffirmed, are not justified by the end that those\n\nwho use them have in view. Whenever Bogan\n\napplies for a license, the Bench is packed by\n\nhostile Justices of the Peace—some of whom, it\n\nis alleged, have on more than one occasion\n\ntravelled very long distances for the purpose of\n\nrecording their votes against the establishment\n\nof the proposed hotel. Sometimes Bogan thinks\n\nto catch the enemy unawares, but they are too\n\nwatchful for him, and a renewed application\n\nonly eventuates in a fresh refusal. There can be\n\nnothing more scandalous than this continued\n\nfight between an applicant and a number of\n\nprejudiced magistrates—for Justice* of the Peace\n\ncan have little regard for their oaths of office\n\nif they go to a court with minds committed to a\n\nparticular course of action. We do not say\n\nthat there are not men on the other side equally\n\nto blame —men who before taking their seats on\n\nthe bench are as fully determined to vote in the\n\naffirmative as their friends are in the negative.\n\nBogan has been and still is a shuttle-cock\n\nbetween two contending factions. He bears a\n\nmost excellent character, held a license many\n\nyears ago, when security bad to be found for a\n\nlicensee’a good behaviour, and has spent his all\n\nin improving tho house which he desires to have\n\nlicensed as an hotel, A good hotel, however\n\nnear a church, would do less harm than a bad one\n\nhowever far away; but those who oppose tin-\n\nlicense are right from their point of view, and\n\nBogan is right fromB. is. The community, we\n\nthink, will hail with satisfaction the day on\n\nwhich such matters are first settled by a respect-\n\nable and impartial tribunal; and those most\n\nimmediately interested in churches and hotels\n\nrespectively will bo glad to have some definite\n\nmeans of ascertaining the rights of each in\n\nregard to the licensing law.\n\nMr. William Saurin Lyster.\n\nWe h avc much pleasure in presenting our readers\n\nto-day with the “counterfeit presentment” of\n\nMr. William Saurin Lyster, the. leading and in\n\nfact the only operatic entrepreneur of Austra-\n\nlasia, Mr. Lyster, a fuller sketch of whose re-\n\nmarkably adventurous career will, we hope, find\n\na place ere long in the columns of this journal,\n\nwas bom in Upper Ragot-street, Dublin, on the\n\n21st March, 1828, and is consequently now 52\n\nyears of age. He comes of a good old stock, and\n\nhis father, Captain Chaworth Lyster, the scion\n\nof a well-known Irish family, served in the\n\nBritish army throughout the Irish rebellion\n\nof 1798. On his marriage with the mother of\n\nthe subject of our present notice (Anne\n\nKeightley, eldest daughter of Thomas Kcightley,\n\nNewtown Park, County Kildare, and sister of\n\nthe historian of that name) Captain Lyster\n\nretired from the army and accepted the agency of\n\nseveral Irish estates, including those of the Earl\n\nof Orkney, Colonel Percival, his own brother-in-\n\nlaw the Bishop of Dromore, and of Mr. W. S.\n\nLystcr’s godfather and namesake the Hon.\n\nWilliam Saurin Lyster, then Attorney-General\n\nof li'eland.\n\nAfter passing through a very severe illness\n\nyoung William Saurin Lyster was, at the age of\n\nthirteen, sent by bis father on a voyage round the\n\nworld. He visited Alelboume and Sydney in the\n\nyear 1812, returning home after an absence of\n\ntwenty months. He was then sent to Calcutta\n\nwith letters to Judge Alexander, his father’s\n\nintention being that he should become an indigo\n\nplanter, but getting homo-sick ho returned after\n\nlittle more than a year’s absence. Then he\n\nvisited fhe Cape of Good Hope where, in fhe\n\nyear 1817, he served as a volunteer during the\n\nKaffir war under, Sir Hurry Smith. In 18f8 bo\n\nsailed for America and, being the possessor of a\n\nsplendid voice, adopted the theatrical profession,\n\nin which he remained with varying success until\n\n1855, when he joined General Walker during the\n\nrevolutionary war and served as a captain in the\n\nNicaraguan army in fhe battles of Grenada, St.\n\nLeon and Rivas. Fortunately for himself, and\n\nwe may add, for the Australian colonies, ho was\n\nsent to the United States on a recruiting\n\nservice and thus escaped the massacre which\n\nfollowed Walker’s insane attempt to have him-\n\nself elected President of the Nicaraguan Republic,\n\nIn 1857 Mr. Lyster organised an opera company,\n\nand after a successful campaign through the\n\nUnited States and California, arrived h*\n\nMelbourne in March, 1861, his career since which\n\ndate is too well known to call for description.\n\nWe need tell the profession nothing about\n\nMr. Lyster; but to those of fhe general public\n\nwho have not the pleasure of his acquaintance\n\nwe may say that lie has proved himself during\n\nthe course of his long Australian career to be a\n\nfirm friend, an honorable gentleman and a most\n\ncapable ami considerate manager. He has just\n\ntaken a benefit at Melbourne Opera House, and\n\nwe hope ere long to welcome his familiar face to\n\nSydney.\n\nMR. WILLIAM SAURIN LYSTER.\n\nCONCERTS.\n\nBY PEA-BLOSSOM.\n\n(Forwarded per favour of THE BULLETIN.)\n\nMr Beak, Bear-Blossom\n\nThe opportunity for a letter comes more quickly\n\nthan I thought. We have been enjoying a succession\n\nof the most exquisite Pianoforte Concerts by that\n\nprince of pianists, “Henri Ketten.” His playing hi»\n\nmarvellous, his execution grand. No critique, however\n\nclever, can do him justice. His rendition of the grand\n\nold “ masters ’* is perfect, and although he plays a full\n\nj>rogramme every night with constant changes, he\n\nnever has a sheet of music before him, so that hia\n\nmemory is as wonderful as his playing. He sits like one\n\ninspired and brings out such columns of sound that\n\none can hardly credit that it is produced by but one\n\nman and one piano. We h&ve had a crowded half\n\nnightly, and such strict silence is maintained that\n\nwhen the people turn the leaf of their programme, the\n\nfaint crackling sound made by the paper is instantly\n\nsuppressed. I have been to nearly all —you know well\n\nwhat such-a musical treat is to me. To one of these\n\nconcerts a “ lady who keeps a large boarding-school\n\nbrought sixty girls. Picture then, my dear Bean-\n\nBlossom,” slowly filing in two and two, sixty “bread\n\nand butter misses.” From their inexpressive faces few,\n\nif any, had a soul for music. It looked more like a\n\npublic advertisement for the college. Sixty chairs fully\n\noccupied by sixty well-conditioned girls beaming all over\n\nwith rude health and exuberant spirits, all in their\n\nSunday frocks, which, like Joseph’s coat, were of divers\n\ncolors. The want of uniformity was painful, because\n\nthose who did not know they were school girls might\n\nwonder how such a heterogenous mass of girl-idiid\n\nmanaged to he admitted. I suppose girls ore considered\n\nto be more musical than boys, for there has been no\n\nattempt on the part of head masters to bring their sixty\n\nboys. Imagine a music hall for grand musical concerts\n\nalmost wholly occupied by two schools of opposite sexes,\n\nwith the heads of the two establishments glowing with\n\npride and beaming all over with satisfaction, os their\n\neyes mentally take note of the effect such an astounding\n\nlot of hoys and girls must have ou the rest of the house,\n\nnot excepting the brilliant pianist, who must he aware\n\nwhat a tribute they are all paying to his genius.\n\nApparently he was not at all overpowered by tide\n\njuvenile effort ou the port of Australia’s daughters,\n\nwho, let us hope, caught uo colds by their contact with\n\nthe night air and were conducted by the Principal\n\nsafely hack to their dormitories. We have lost Ketten\n\nfor a time. Melbourne claims him for the next six\n\nweeks and there ho is sure of a good reception *and »\n\nbrilliant career duriug his stay, although ho cannot\n\npossibly have a more appreciative aud packed audience\n\nthan that who nightly welcomed him in Sydney. Of\n\ncourse such a word as “ circus” should not be breathed\n\nin the same paper that mentions \" Ketten.” As dross\n\nis to silver or gold, so is “ Chiarini ” to “ Ketten,” but\n\nthe purer the metal, the more necessary there should\n\nbo a little alloy, and so it is that while \" Ketten \" draws\n\nhis appreciative hearers by hundreds “ Chiaxini **\n\ngathers ibis sawdust-loving admirers by thousand*\n\nunder his’ great big tent.

Fifteen years\n\nago the brass works here spoken of were\n\nestablished, and after a long\n\nperiod of struggling they have\n\ndeveloped into an industry\n\nemploying a large number of\n\nhands and competing in respect\n\nof its productions with the\n\nvery best description of im-\n\nported brass work. All de-\n\nscriptions of plumbers' and\n\nengineers’ brass work is done\n\nat the establishment, and\n\nbesides winning the highest\n\nawards at our great Exhibi-\n\ntion the proprietor has secured\n\nalmost exclusively the pa-\n\ntronage of the trade for his\n\nproductions. The workman-\n\nship exhibited in every article\n\nturned out is substantial and\n\nsolid, and the prices being\n\nlower than for the imported\n\ngood-. The best result cannot but be predicted.\n\nOne of the principal lines made here is Watson «\n\nbeer engines, a sketch of which engine is given\n\nabove. These won the highest award at the\n\nInternational Exhibition as colonial productions,\n\nand to onr credit, be it said, their admitteo ex-\n\ncellence has won for them a. good demand and ready\n\nsale in the capital of the adjoining protectionist\n\ncolony. For the speedy and efficient manufacture\n\nof articles of this kind the factory is well suited,\n\nhaving several handy furnaces and numerous\n\nlathes, dressing and polishing appliances, etc. It\n\nis however in another branch that the works have\n\ncome prominently before the public of Late. Mr.\n\nWatson has established in connection with the\n\nbrass works the entirely new industry ot cleetro-\n\nnickel plating, which has already reached the\n\nhighest degree of excellence. The very newest\n\nmechanical inventions have been imported tor the\n\npurpose, and a portion of the premises has been\n\nspecially set apart and built for the work. _ Ihe\n\nmost experienced workmen have been obtained,\n\nand this new branch of electroplating is carried\n\non with a success in point of workmanship that\n\ncannot be surpassed in London or Paris. It was\n\nthe excellence of the nickel plating on the beer\n\nengines that attracted so much attention at the\n\nExhibition, and now that this description of\n\nplating is found to bo cheaper yet more brilliant\n\nand lasting than silver plating the capabilities of\n\nthe work are tested to the utmost. Articles ot\n\ndomestic use, such as spoons, forks, cruets, sal-\n\nvers, tea and coffee services, <fco., can hero bo re-\n\nfurbished at a very low figure, and made equal to\n\nnew. Gold and silver plating is likewise done oh\n\nthe works. All descriptions of coachbnilders’ re-\n\nquirements, such as stalk hoops, caps, &c.. are-\n\ndone in the very highest stylo, as also jewellers\n\nwork, in the shape of watch-oases, Ac. This is\n\nquite a new industry, and is carried on on a\n\nscale that must be of absolute advantage to the-\n\ntrade. A visit will bo well repaid. No manufac-\n\ntory can come up to these works in point of price\n\nor workmanship for the nickel plated beer engines\n\nmade here, and the matter is well worthy the\n\nattention of hotel proprietors who care to make\n\nsome kind of appearance at their bars. The en-\n\nergetic proprietor deserves all the success he has\n\nwon, .\n\nTHE AUSTRALIAN.\n\nThis periodical is again to hand and it a con-\n\ntents fully justify the care and taste displayed in\n\nthe form in which they are placed before the\n\npublic.

The front part of tho premises i.s employed\n\nas a book and stationery warehouse, in which a\n\nvery large and well-conducted trade is carried on ;\n\nthe promises from cellar to garret being well filled\n\nwith ©very article pertaining to the supply of\n\nliterature in every form, and also with stock to fill\n\nthe wants of merchants, lawyers, and all who use\n\nstationery: and, in this age of penny poets and\n\nGovernment education, who does not? At tho\n\nrear of the shop is a large room which forma the\n\nlibrary, and which from early morning to dusk is\n\nthronged with tho fashion and wealth of our city,\n\nthe ladies being certainly the more numerous, as\n\nwe pres race the class of three-volume literature\n\nprovided for their more especial delectation ia\n\nsooner got through and is more captivating than\n\nthe more solid pabulum for the male sex. Wo feel\n\nalmost inclined to qualify our last sentence, how-\n\never, us we have half an idea that the three-\n\nvolume novel is not always tho special perquisite\n\nof the fair sex ; we confess, for our own part, that\n\nMiss Braddon and a good cigar are very pleasant\n\ncompanions on a holiday afternoon. Haddocks’\n\nis the Sydney Mndie’s. and although we do not\n\nhear of 1200 copies of Tennyson’s last poem being\n\nput on the shelves the supply of every class of\n\nreading matter, novels, travels, biography. Ac., is\n\nvery ample. Tho library has been established\n\nabout 15 years, and beside enjoying the patronage\n\nof all the elite of the city ami of many of our\n\nwealthy landed proprietors throughout the country\n\nhas been patronised by our representatives of\n\nroyalty in succession since its establishment.\n\nSome little time ago the proprietor, Mr. Haddock,\n\ninterested himself with the Commissioner for Rail-\n\nways to obtain a reduction in the rates of carriage\n\nper rail on library exchanges, and the Commis-\n\nsioner, after due consideration, was pleased to\n\nreduce the charge to one-fourth of ordinary par-\n\ncels’ rates. This must bo a great boon to country\n\nresidents living witliin rail communication of the\n\ncity, and wo hope in no very long time to see a\n\nsimilar process every morning from Ma*block's as\n\nthere Ls from Mndie’s when boxes of now books\n\nare sent off by rail all over England. Nothing\n\ncan bo more pleasant, or can form a more perfect\n\nlink with civilization for those who are buried in\n\ntho dull districts of tho interior than a constant\n\nchange of new books and magazines, nndthosocan\n\nbo had from Haddock’s within about six weeks of\n\ntheir publication in London. We heartily wish\n\nthe courteous proprietor of the library every suc-\n\ncess andan increase inliis task of purveying for the\n\nvarious tastes of those in search of mental\n\npabulum or recreation*\n\nLATE SPORTING.\n\nCoonamble Races.\n\nBy Electic Telegraph.\n\ni’iyinv' Handicap—Marobcme, 1; Ma voumeen, ii.\n\nTime, 1 min 51 secs.\n\nJockey Club Handicap.—Bainbow, 3 ; Gila, 1‘; little\n\nNell, It.
