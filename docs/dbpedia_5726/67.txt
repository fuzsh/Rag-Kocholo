Ian and Pat look at a very different kind of war movie, Robert Mulligan's 1971 coming-of-age drama, Summer of ‘42!

The film centers on three WWII-era teen boys whose lazy summer is spent roughhousing, pursuing girls, and generally blocking out the world outside their idyllic beach-front community. When Hermie (Gary Grimes) falls in love with an older woman named Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill), his ideas about the opposite sex are challenged in ways the characters and the audience may find surprising.

In this wide-ranging review, the guys explore how Summer of ‘42 compares and contrasts from the teen sex comedies that would flood cinemas a decade later; why the film makes them feel at once cozy and uncomfortable; and its unlikely modern-day successor.
