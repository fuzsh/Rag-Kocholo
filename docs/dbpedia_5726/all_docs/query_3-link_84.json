        "text": "I don't know why it took me so long, but I finally saw this movie for the first time the other night. What a wonderful little film.\n\nGreat performances from the youngsters (it's a hoot to see Jerry Houser before be became a ubiquitous commercial voiceover presence). The cinematography and music score are gorgeous. And that's to say nothing of Jennifer O'Neill...\n\nI sure wish I'd had a summer like that!\n\nUnfortunately, no. The love scene is damnably discreet.\n\nTo tell you the truth, though, I really don't mind because her FACE is what really does it for me anyhow. (\"Show me the FACE of a beautiful woman\", remember?)\n\nI like it as a war movie, yes. It's sort'a the WW2 version of Cold Mountain, in a sense.... I think it could of used a bit more of the war in it. I would of added a few washed up bodies from the submarine war that was close to our shores that first full year for us.\n\nAs much as I like the movie as is. I wish it had a few more pinches of war. So many bodies were washing up in the summer of '42. Having one wash up would of been very authenic. I met a man who was employed clearing the beaches of bodies in the Hatteras, North Carlonia's outer banks, vicinity. He singled out '42 as the big year. The war moved east after that.\n\nI like the movie just the same.....\n\nVery interesting, Rachael. I actually had no idea the war was fought so close to \"home\".\n\nMore info here:\n\nhttp://www.newsobserver.com/print/tuesday/opinion/story/715010.html\n\nA \"beach body\" scene in the movie would have been a wonderful foreshadowing of the flim's climax (no pun intended, seriously)... was there any reference to this in the book?\n\nWasn't sure what her current views were but I found her website and I guess she's apparently joined the God Squad. Still looks pretty damn good though."
