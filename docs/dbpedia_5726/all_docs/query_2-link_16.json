        "text": "what3words does not aim to replace street addressing. Rather, it is a useful addition when street addresses are not accurate enough, and an instant, scalable solution where addresses do not exist.\n\nCompared to current street addressing systems, 3 word addresses are far more accurate, as they refer to a specific 3m x 3m area. As the entire what3words grid is fixed, the 3 word address for a particular location will never change even if buildings or streets are redeveloped.\n\n3 word addresses are unique, unlike street names which are often duplicated, and they are easier to communicate and share with others.\n\nwhat3words is much faster to set up and more cost-efficient than any regular street addressing system, as every 3 word address has already been pre-assigned, providing an instant, scalable solution.\n\nwhat3words is the only addressing system optimised for voice, making it the ideal location system for the voice-enabled solutions of the future.\n\nwhat3words AutoSuggest prompts intelligent suggestions based on the userâ€™s location, making it a truly human friendly solution.\n\nWithout phone signal, the app functions the same as when you have no data connection: you can view the location of any what3words address you enter. You can also navigate to it using compass mode.\n\nTo share a what3words address over the phone or in a text message you need phone signal. To load maps, or share in other apps or social media, you need a data connection.\n\nWatch our CEO Chris explain how what3words works offline here."
