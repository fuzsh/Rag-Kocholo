        "text": "JENNIFER O'NEILL, the beauteous, mysterious, ethereal Dorothy of the hit movie, “Summer of '42,” is passed out cold. Zonked. Gone are her days as the grieving young war widow, and now she is playing Miranda Graham, an aspiring actress, currently unconscious on an examining table in Room H‐224 of Flower & Fifth Avenue Hospitals. Surrounding her are a doctor who is taking her pulse. (James Coco), a worried‐looking friend (Dyan Cannon), her bearded boyfriend (Ken Howard), and, in the background amidst a cluster of lights and a camera, a movie director with a bellowing voice and a gleaming paid pate (Otto Preminger). A blonde nurse shoves a yellow vial of nitroglycerin under Miranda's nose until the faintee, clad in, gray hot pants and ??own lace‐up Roman sandals, to.\n\n“For Christ's sake,” she says groggily, as Preminger's crew records it for Paramount and posterity. “Haven't you ever seen anyone faint before? I faint at: the dentist's. I faint when. I get vaccination. Sometimes I faint just because it's Tuesday.”\n\nBut all of us out there in the audience, especially those who have read Lois Gould's spicy novel, “Such Good Friends,” will know why Miranda really faints in Preminger's movie of same. Miranda isn't weak from donating blood as she says she is, but has passed out instead because she couldn't stand to see Julie's soon‐to‐die husband, Richard (Laurence Luckinbill), in his ghastly yellow death mask in the Intensive Care Unit. Although Julie doesn't know yeti Miranda had been having an affair with Richard, and was probably the worst of Julie's such good friends, of which there are quite a few.\n\nAnd that, folks, is the latest love story from Paramount.\n\n“RELAX!” Otto screams, one‐fourth jokingly, after about the fifth take. His voice carries all the way down the corridor of the hospital wing, empty, according to one crew member, “because patients don't get sick in August because doctors go on vacation then.” Preminger's vocal histrionics cause some of the crew members to blink rapidly and look very tense around the mouth corners. But others grin at the absurdity of trying to “RELAX!” while the Main Man is shouting like that. “It's the only time Otto gets to act,” one smiling apologist says.\n\nThings aren't too much calmer these days in Jennifer's breathtaking new on West 67th Street. She and daughter Aimee, 4, have been there only a week following a move from Jennifer's cavernous Tudor home in Mount Vernon, N. Y., after her six‐year marriage broke ûp, and things aren't just the way she'd like them yet.\n\nDPLX apt. with 4 be??rms and 2‐str Ivg rm. fplc, A/C, sep. dng rm, elev. bldg.\n\nAnd then there are the phone calls. they come about every five minutes, and where a more established actress might take her phone off the hook, Jennifer races to answer every call. And then, on this particular evening, Friday, she has a stream of visitors (notably, parents and a male friend) who seem very eager to go out to dinner.\n\nSomehow, in the midst or the chaos, I manage to learn a little bit about the 23‐year‐old actress, whose face first hit the newspapers when she was winning trophies at horse shows in her teens, and then the covers of national magazines when she went on to become one of Manhattan's “top five” models, and then, of course, the silver screen in several minor roles that culminated in the raves she received for “Summer of '42.”\n\n*\n\n“After ‘Summer of '42,’ people kept sending me scripts that weren't very good,” she recalls. “‘Such Good Friends’ ‘was the first one that I really liked, even though it didn't have the challenge of '42.’ It's not that it's a comedown, having the second woman's part after Dyan Cannon. Miranda is important—she's sort of like a catalyst. But she's just kind of there. I got the part in way you won't believe. I first met Otto on a Joe Franklin show about a year ago after “Rio Lobo,” a movie I made with John Wayne, came out. It was the first TV talk show I'd ever done, and Otto went on first. He was a very strong character, and I was getting more and more edgy. I was afraid I wouldn't get a word in edgewise. But once I did get on, he was very nice. Joe Franklin said, ‘How would you like to be in an Otto Preminger picture?’ and Otto said, ‘Well, in my next film there's a part that might be right for you.’ And so after Summer of '42’ came out, I went over to see him, and now you're going to think this is one of those unbelievable success stories ... but he didn't even remember me! There were lots of girls outside, and when it was my turn, he asked me what I'd done. It seemed like I was back to good old appointment time again. Finally, my agent got him to see '42, and after that he seemed to recognize me. At least the next time went to see him, he talked to me little more, and finally he gave me the part.”\n\nRingggg. Ringgg. Jennifer jumps up and runs to the kitchen, her long coltish legs seeming to reach up to her armpits. Her 5‐foot‐8‐inch, 120‐pound model's body is encased in a patchwork hot pants outfit with knee‐high, blue‐denim booty. She has shoulder‐length chestnut hair topped by an interesting layer of gray that she doesn't bother to color, hazel eyes, and she could probably pass for Jacqueline Bisset's twin sister.\n\nShe returns, spreads some cheese be tween two Ritz crackers, and begins to tell in her confident‐and‐candid manner how she really doesn't appreciate working under Preminger's atmosphere of “creative tension.”\n\n“I don't think he means to be harsh,” she says evenly. “He directs differently from any other director I've worked with, and basically, it's his temper that is different. It's just like a whole atmosphere blows up and settles down, and blows up and settles down [she makes giant mushrooming gestures with her arms], and then you can't remember what it's all about. I don't understand it at all ... why he's that way. It's shame, because he can be such a fantastic person. I always think of him as two people. But when he loses his temper, it's contagious and it creates an atmosphere of tension. We lost a few crew members because of it. None of the cast has left, and that makes me happy. They're a fun group—but we would have had ten times more fun.\n\n“One day he almost had me in tears, but he knew it, so he stopped. It was scene where he kept telling me that was moving my head. I didn't think was, but lie did. So he yelled, ‘VY YOU DO DAT?!’ And in the scene that you saw where I fainted, he kept saying that I was slurring my words. Well, the fact was that I was stoned out of my mind from the nitro the nurse kept putting under my nose. It was real, and I couldn't even see straight.”\n\nAccording to Jennifer, the filming of “Summer of '42” was a honeymoon in comparison. Directed by Robert Mulligan, it was shot in eight weeks on location around Mendocino in northern California, and Jennifer's eyes tend to get a little misty when she reminisces about it. “The people all really fit together,” she says, “and they really cared about what they were doing. We worked six days a week and we weren't even exhausted. We were tired, and yet we weren't. We couldn't wait to get up in the morning and start shooting. After Richard Roth, the producer, had seen the rushes of the last scene, he was so excited that he posted a notice saying the rushes would be shown at 9 Sunday morning. And do you know, 90 per cent of the crew showed up—on a Sunday morning! That's just how incredible the atmosphere was.”\n\nThat last scene, in which Dorothy, the 26‐year‐ald war widow, goes to bed with Hermie (Gary Grimes), a 15‐year‐old naïf who has admired her all summer, is the most dramatic scene in the film—and one that has been rapped by some critics for being “unrealistic.” Does Jennifer think that Dorothy really would have gone straight to bed with a teen‐ager after learning her husband had been killed in World War II? “I thought about that a lot,” she says, “and I don't know. Dorothy had had some drinks, and she was absolutely paralyzed with sorrow. And she was fantasizing. When she began to dance with Hermie, she thought that it was the comfort of her husband, somebody sympathetic, real and alive. If Hermie had arrived three hours later, or the next day, it never would have happened.\n\n“We shot that scene last,” she remembers. “I wiped myself out emotionally before we did it. I sat and thought about every depressing thing I could think about. It took two days to shoot it, and I sort of sat in a dark corner for two days. When we finally finished, the cameraman was crying, and the prop man who's been in the business for 40 years was crying, and the wardrobe lady was crying. I looked at her and said, ‘Here, you do the scene.’”\n\nThe atmosphere is getting heavy, and for comic relief, blonde, blue‐eyed Aimee runs into the living room carrying a black and white plush toy that looks like a panda bear. “No, it's Snoopy!” she proclaims, hugging him close to her. Aimee also has four real live cats and two real live dogs to play with, and a live‐in nanny to care for her while her mother is working And leaning against a wall in the dining room are two bicycles for riding in Central Park—a big one for a mother, and a little one for a little girl.\n\nAlthough Jennifer's marriage to Deed Rossiter, a photographer's agent, recently went on the skids, she says she still believes in marriage and hopes to remarry some day. Two of her steadier companions are Chuck Pfeifer, a Green Beret veteran of Vietnam who is now film producer (“He works for Wilde Films—W‐I‐L‐D‐E,” she says), and man who says he is Stanley Glick, handsome, dark‐haired dress manufacturer who is sitting in the kitchen with her parents, waiting to go out for dinner.\n\n“I'm an incurable romantic,” she says, fingering the wedding rings she still wears on the index finger of her left hand. “I'm absolutely all for love, marriage, a commitment, and devotion. I think that's what life is all about. But I don't believe in marriage for the sake of marriage. You've got to find someone you really love, and that's rare. I got married when I was 17, and at that point it's almost luck—or chance—if you grow together. I hated dating to begin with. I had been working as model for two years already, so wasn't your average teen‐ager. I was romantic. I wanted to be with one person. I wanted to have what my parents had. Next time I'm going to be very, very sure.”\n\nJennifer was born in Brazil, where her grandfather, Oscar O'Neill, was president of the Bank of Rio de Janeiro. Her father, Oscar O'Neill Jr., is a former World War II bomber pilot who was shot down on his next‐to‐last mission and spent two years in the German prison camp about which the Steve McQueen movie, “The Great Escape,” was made. Today Mr. O'Neill is silver‐haired and Hollywood handsome, and heads Manhattan.firm that exports dental and hospital supplies.\n\nJennifer attended the exclusive Dalton School and then switched to the Professional Children's School because; at the age of 15, she was already a top professional model. Her career was lucrative one — she earned as much as $80,000 a year — and her face was on the cover of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Seventeen and Glamour, and on The Tube she was the beautiful face plugging products for Revlon, Clairol, English Leather and Camay soap.\n\nToday, she talks about modeling with considerable distaste. “I really don't relate to being a model,” she says hollowly. “The money was terrific, but I didn't enjoy the work, and at the end, it wasn't a challenge. It didn't tap that many resources, it wasn't that creative, and it wasn't that personal. One of the worst things about it is that it tends to make you too aware of physical things ... about how you look. Models get ‘old’ when they're 28, and that's absurd. There is too much competition on the superficial levels. And that Beautiful People syndrome ... what a drag! And most models for some reason marry idiots. There are a lot of leeches around, and they attach themselves to models. I don't know why it is, 1 met my hus band through modeling, but I certainly don't mean to imply that he's a leech. He isn't.”\n\nDuring her modeling years, Jennifer had signed a year's contract with Paramount, which came to naught first because she had Aimee, and then, she says, because she refused to do nude scenes. Eventually, she snagged a three‐line part in Sidney Poitier's “For Love of Ivy,” and followed it up with a whopping six lines in a film whose title she has forgotten (“It had the word Fuzz in it somewhere”), with Dick Van Dyke.\n\n“Then came ‘Glass Houses,’ sort of an experimental film that Columbia hasn't released yet,” she says. “People are either gonna love it or hate it. It's about what motivates married men in their 40's to have affairs. [She plays the mistress of the male lead, Bernard Barrow.] The whole thing was a pain in the neck. They kept insisting I do nude scenes, and I refused. I would always have something covering me here and there”—she motions toward her breasts and pelvic area — “and in one shot wore nude underwear. Nobody else in the film seemed to mind, so there was, out in California, with a whole lot of pressure on me, and a lot of aggravation.\n\n“I simply refuse to do nude scenes,” she almost shouts. “In fact, if Robert Mulligan would have made me do them for ‘Summer of '42.’ I would have refused the part — as much as I wanted it. I just hate the whole idea. I don't feel I have to take my clothes off in order to act. I'm sort of a private person. I've never stood in front of a camera without any clothes on, and never will. A lot of people are going to say I'm nude in '42, but that was just my back. I had something taped on my front. I mean, if an actor wants to go nude, fine. But why should you have to if you don't want to? The whole thing just aggravates the hell out of me!”\n\nAll of that championship horseback riding in her teens came in handy last year when she played a waif of the plains in “Rio Lobo,” with John Wayne. (She still owns two horses, stabled in White Plains, and she rides them regularly — even though she suffered a fractured spine five years ago when a horse fell on her at a Scarsdale horse show.) She and Wayne got on well, and it may have had something to do with the fact that she, too, is something of a super‐patriot. “I'm just sick and tired of people knocking this country,” she says fervently. “I adore this country. don't think there's anything that's any better. It has a lot of problems, but it's a nice place, and generally, what stands for is good.”\n\nThe future? First she takes time out to answer the umpteenth phone call, and then returns to say she is sure her future is in films. She has nothing lined up after “Such Good Friends,” but would like to do a comedy, “something like N?? il'Simon.” In fact, she tried out for the movie version of “Star Spangled Girl,” but lost out to Sandy Duncan. “I was in a car accident two days before the test,” she says, “and I felt like I was gonna die.”\n\nThose constant comparisons with Jacqueline Bisset, she feels, probably won't do much to harm her career. “I think she's super looking,” Jennifer says sincerely. “I take it as a compliment. went by a newsstand once and she was on the cover of Life or Look, and couldn't figure out what I was doing on that cover. We're pretty much the same type, and our eyes are alike, and our coloring, but I'm taller, and on film we don't photograph the same.\n\n“And besides,” she says, as the phone starts jangling again, “if you start letting things like that bother you, you'll go crazy. Life is just too short for that.”"
