        "text": "I started noticing the trend about a month ago. First there was the detail in Made of Honor, when one of the macho buddies of the main character (Patrick Dempsey, age 42) has to strap on a truss to play basketball. Then there was the scene in The Visitor, when the widower professor played by Richard Jenkins (61) gets visibly winded playing his drum. And there was the intimate bedroom moment in Sex and the City, when Sarah Jessica Parker (43) reaches over to borrow Chris Noth's (53) reading glasses.\n\nBut what really convinced me were the superheroes: As the lead character in The Incredible Hulk (which opened yesterday), Edward Norton (38) needs reading glasses, too. As the lead character in Hancock (opening in July), Will Smith (40 in September) sports grizzle in his stubble and bags under his eyes. And the entire plot of Iron Man revolves around its lead character's (Robert Downey Jr., 43) bouts of angina. As Mark Harris recently wrote in Entertainment Weekly, \"I've never seen anything in a superhero movie quite like the expression on Downey's face when he's trying out the jet packs in his new boots and looking like he's really hoping [he]won't throw out his lower back when he lands.\"\n\nHot diggity, it's the summer of 42 - age 42, that is. Or 43, or 53. Middle-aged-crazy (meaning \"insane\") has morphed into middle-aged-krayzy (meaning \"potentially still relevant\"). You can't turn on MTV without seeing Madonna (50 in August) squishing the pipsqueak Justin Timberlake between her mighty yoga thighs. The epic fistfight in You Don't Mess with the Zohan occurs between Adam Sandler (who turns 42 in September) and John Turturro (51); and the epic high jinks in Step Brothers are perpetrated by Will Ferrell (turning 41 this summer) and John C. Reilly (43). The midlife crisis is suddenly the midlife circus.\n\nThis summer, a wedding-themed musical Mamma Mia! revolves around the sexual promiscuity of, not a dewy bride, but her seasoned mother (Meryl Streep, 59). The bumbling detective in Get Smart, who simultaneously evokes nostalgia (for the midlifers) and hipness (for their kids), is played by Steve Carell, who will soon turn 46. And the ultimate boundary-pusher of this middle-aged mania is Indiana Jones's Harrison Ford, still slinging his whip at 66.\n\nFortysomethings have always been in the movies, of course. It's just that they usually stand down in the summer, ceding the school's-out box office to pretty kiddies and their big, loud gadgets. This year the grownups are the gadgeteers, albeit with younger sidekicks - Shia LaBeouf in Indiana Jones, Jennifer Hudson in Sex and the City, Amanda Seyfried in Mamma Mia! - to help them retrieve their e-mails and program their iPods and whatnot.\n\nI'd love to believe that Hollywood has finally recognized the dramatic potential of midlife. That people struggling to cope with growing kids and aging parents, or with their own wasted potential, missed opportunities and compromises, is as much the stuff of cinema as shooting spies. That falling in love for the fifth time can be as - or more - interesting than falling in love for the first. And that sometimes we don't need or want a second childhood, but would greatly appreciate a second crack at adulthood.\n\nSeveral current and upcoming movies do address the notion that midlife can be a profound place to be. In Then She Found Me, Helen Hunt, 45, faces infertility and divorce (from Matthew Broderick, 46), then reconciles with her birth mother (Bette Midler) and opens up to a new romance (with Colin Firth, almost 48). Of course, to get the film made, Hunt had to write, direct, produce, star in and probably dip into her own chequing account, but she put it out there.\n\nIn When Did You Last See Your Father?, Colin Firth again - he's the It Man of the summer, appearing in this and Hunt's film, as well as The Accidental Husband opposite Uma Thurman, and Mamma Mia! - faces the ambivalence he feels for his charismatic, competitive dying father. In Finding Amanda, an alcoholic TV producer (Matthew Broderick again, It Man No. 2) re-embraces adulthood by helping his niece. And in the comedy Diminished Capacity - there's a title that says it all - Broderick (again, again) copes with an Alzheimer's-afflicted uncle (Alan Alda) and renewed feelings for his high-school sweetheart (Virginia Madsen).\n\nYet despite the dramatic potential of midlifers, it's much more likely that Hollywood is, if anything, waking up to our box-office potential. Sex and the City, whose stars' ages range from Cynthia Nixon's 42 to Kim Cattrall's 52, grossed $105-million (U.S.) in its first week. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has hauled in $258-million and counting. The Visitor, this summer's low-budget sleeper, has made $6-million and has the critics raving.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that this spurt of midlife movies could be simply the last roar of that terrible beast, the baby-boomer ego - the cinematic equivalent of a perimenopausal woman firing off her extra eggs before her womb goes dark. Never before has a generation held so fiercely to the belief that it's the only one that matters; some of summer's films make hay with that belief.\n\nKevin Costner must have had a gas playing the lead character in Swing Vote, about a sozzled loser who becomes the focus of the world's attention when a U.S. presidential election comes down to his one vote. Steve Coogan surely had a hoot playing a failed actor turned high-school drama teacher who casts himself as the lead in his own rock opera in Hamlet 2. And so what if Ferrell and Reilly, who play the men-children living at home with their newlywed parents (Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen) in Step Brothers, are probably in real life trying to get their own teenagers out of the house? We boomers hang on like grim death - which feels a lot closer than it used to.\n\nBut come on, don't we deserve some movies of our own, after all the money we've spent on them? And be honest, who would you rather hear crack wise about sex, the interchangeable twentysomething girls in Mamma Mia!, or the actresses who play Streep's lifelong buddies, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters? Can you imagine a younger actor squeezing anywhere near the juice out of Iron Man's worldly wise arms-dealer Tony Stark than Downey did? When he says, \"Face it, you've seen me doing lots of things weirder than this,\" it's extra-delicious, because we have, oh, we have.\n\nThe power-crazed villain in The Incredible Hulk played by Tim Roth sums it up: \"If only I could know what I know now, but have the body I had 10 years ago.\" We fortysomethings nod at that line, not least because Roth looks every minute of his 47 years. And if Hollywood is the only place that can make that dream come true? For this brief summer, at least, it is."
