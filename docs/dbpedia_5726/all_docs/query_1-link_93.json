        "text": "In the summer of 1942, when New York author and screenwriter Herman Raucher was a young boy spending a family vacation on Nantucket Island, he had a romantic experience with an older woman. That one night they spent together haunted Raucher for years. Until he decided to revisit his memories and put what happened that summer on paper.\n\nIt first became a movie screenplay, written in the 1950s; then at the same time a book and a successful 1971 film directed by Robert Mulligan. Of course, I’m talking about “Summer of ‘42”, the coming-of-age story that has been defining generations ever since.\n\nThe script-based book, published shortly before the film’s release, was a best seller. The movie, produced by Warner Bros., was an instant blockbuster and one of the most successful films of 1971, with four Academy Award nominations: Best Original Music Score (by Michel Legrand), Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay, having won only the first one."
