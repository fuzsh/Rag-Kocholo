        "text": "Post by wmcclain on\n\nSummer of '42 (1971), directed by Robert Mulligan.\n\nDuring summer vacation on \"the Island\", a teenaged boy falls in love at a distance with a married young woman, a neighbor. When her husband goes off to war he may be able to spend time with her. They are only a few years apart in age, but that is a gulf of experience and maturity. Raging hormones and earnest adoration make for pain and confusion. As they say: it's complicated.\n\nAdolescents understand that lust and love are different things, but that doesn't mean they are easy to untangle. Our hero struggles.\n\nA good bit: dating girls their own age, the boys try furtive groping in the dark theater while elegant Bette Davis and Paul Henreid are projected in Now, Voyager (1942).\n\nAlso the reminder of those days when a glimpse of the loved one seemed a bit of heaven.\n\nAnd something you find in literature more often than in films: people sometimes have sex to assuage grief.\n\nThe coming of age story is a well-worn genre. This was the blockbuster entry of the early 1970s, earning 30x its budget. Michel Legrand's theme song became an omnipresent standard, the ambient background music of those years. The lyrics are not used in the film: \"The summer smiles / The summer knows / And unashamed / She sheds her clothes...\"\n\nJennifer O'Neill (23) is lovely as a dream. She insisted on no nudity in the film. I know her name better than her filmography, recalling her clearly only from Cronenberg's Scanners (1981). She did quite a lot of TV work.\n\nPhotographed Robert Surtees, a soft look. The outdoor scenes seem particularly hazy and I wonder if there isn't something about Mendocino, standing in for Nantucket. Dead & Buried (1981) was also filmed there and has that same soft atmosphere.\n\nAvailable on Blu-ray from Warner Archive.\n\nPost by wmcclain on\n\nI'll copy something someone else posted in response to this review on another forum:\n\nInterestingly, Herman Raucher disclosed that he and the real \"Dorothy\" (she is never named in the film) didn't \"go all the way,\" just held each other. He said she was drunk, and kept calling him by her husband's name, which must've been painful. For the film, they left it vague for the viewer to decide. (One of my favorite hallmarks of Mulligan, never completely answering every question about characters.) ... He did hear from her after the book and film phenom, among many women who claimed they were \"my Dorothy.\"\n\nIn one of those \"there is justice\" Hollywood stories, Warner Bros. had such little confidence in the film (despite the respected director) they offered Raucher a percentage of the profits (\"points\") versus a flat fee. He accepted. Gee, there's a sucker born every minute, right? And they asked him to pen a novelization to promote the film, a little extra gravy y'understand. He wrote the book in about three weeks and it was released a few months ahead of the film's release. ... The novel was a bestseller, translated into many languages. As you said, the film, released as \"from Herman Raucher's national best seller,\" was a huge hit as well. Raucher said in an interview recently that the proceeds let him nearly retire, and he still gets healthy checks from it decades later. (Interviews are linked from the film's and novel's Wikipedia pages if anyone'd like to read them.) We should all be so lucky.\n\nPost by teleadm on\n\nHow appropiate to post about a Robert Mulligan movie on his birth date (23 August)!\n\nThe first time I heard about the movie was in a Mad Magazine parody, a few years after it had primeired.\n\nIt's been some time since I last watched it, but I thought it was a lovely bittersweet movie about the first sexual adventure of a young man-to-be, or coming of age. Legrand's music helped a lot too.\n\nUsed to have the soundtrack (the pic is of the single), but apparently I've sold it, many years ago when I sold many of my old Soundtrack vinyls.\n\nPost by Prime etc. on\n\nI forgot she was in Scanners. I knew about her from this movie although I have never watched it-but it appears in the Shining.\n\nI watched THE CAREY TREATMENT recently which has O'Neill. Surprised how little she is famous for. Seems like she didn't have all that many well known projects-the last being the tv show where Jon-Erik Hexum accidentally shot himself.\n\nI think Katherine Ross must have been competing for some of her parts.\n\n\"We need a brunette for this.\"\n\n\"How about the one from Summer of '42? Katherine something..\"\n\nPost by cynthiagreen on\n\nI forgot she was in Scanners.

Ross was already well established with GRADUATE, BUTCH CASSIDY and an Oscar nomination before SUMMER OF 42 came out, but agreed they were the same \"type\"....New Hollywood poster girls. Must admit I always thought Ross a much bigger star- I'd say she'd be competing with Candice Bergen & Ali Macgraw rather than O'Neill. Somewhat incredibly Wikipedia tells me a Ms Streisand was in the frame for the part....\n\nRival? Katharine Ross\n\nAs to the paucity of O'Neill's CV, she did have 9 husbands so I guess t was hard to fit a proper career in there too.\n\nThree that have not been mentioned\n\nSUCH GOOD FRIENDS - Preminger's bitterly funny look at adultery - O'Neill has second lead as mistress of Dyan Cannon's husband.\n\nTHE INNOCENT - Visconti - probably her \"classiest\" credit\n\nCARAVANS - a big bucks adventure from James Michener novel, with Anthony Quinn and her PETER PROUD co-star Michael Sarrazin (Barbara Dickson had a UK hit with the theme song)\n\nSUMMER OF 42 a big one - but always felt it inferior to the same year's THE LAST PICTURE SHOW which offered a more jaundiced and less romantic view of sexual awakening.\n\nPost by cynthiagreen on\n\nInteresting to think of Ross and O'Neill as rivals...

THE STEPFORD WIVES her best chance imho but even though the term has entered our language, at the time it was not particularly popular - it took 4 years to even get a UK release (and director Forbes a big name here)."
