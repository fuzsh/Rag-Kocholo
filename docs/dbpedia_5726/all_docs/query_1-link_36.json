        "text": "Directed by Robert Mulligan, this coming-of-age film stars Jennifer O'Neill as a young army wife in Nantucket who begins a romance with a teenage twink (Gary Grimes). It was a major box-office hit and a pop culture phenomenon at the time of its release, but it strangely seems to be a forgotten film today. I recently watched it and thought it was beautifully shot, and features a gorgeous score by Michel Legrand. It has an at times otherworldly feel. It is more or less the heterosexual originator of something like \"Call Me by Your Name\", which it seems the writer of that novel/the film's director, Luca Guadagnino, may have taken cues from.\n\nGary Grimes didn't have much of a career and he quit acting by the early '90s. I'm not sure what happened. He was pretty good in this movie, and I think perfectly struck the naivety, fabricated precociousness, and sexual curiosity of being a teenage boy (probably because he WAS a teenage boy—he was 15 when they filmed this; O'Neill was about 23). Probably not so shocking in 1971, but I imagine that casting would draw a lot of ire today, even though the film is fairly tame. Grimes grew up to be pretty handsome, a bit similar in appearance to Michael Ontkean.\n\nR2 \"Grimes appeared in only six films, and largely retired from show business in the late 1970s (except for an episode of Matt Houston in 1983). He still lives in Los Angeles and has remained out of public view since that time, working for a charitable organization. \"I got to the point where the work wasn't up to the quality that I wanted,\" Grimes told American Profile magazine in 2011. \"I'm very happy in my decision.\" \"\n\nHe turned 68 last Friday.\n\nThe infamous love scene where Hermie visits her and finds her in mourning over the news of her husband's death is truly heartbreaking and wonderfully acted by both of them. While I'm sure it could be subject to a legion of modern think-pieces on statutory rape, there is no less a sad, quiet beauty to that entire sequence. The minor details of it (such as O'Neill observing their moving shadows on the wallpaper as they slow-dance to the Victrola) make it feel immediate and emotionally-charged.\n\n[quote] It is more or less the heterosexual originator of something like \"Call Me by Your Name\", which it seems the writer of that novel/the film's director, Luca Guadagnino, may have taken cues from.\n\nAndre Aciman (who wrote the novel on which the movie is based) has actually aid the main inspiration is a short 1949 lesbian novel by Dorothy Strachey (Lytton's sister) called \"Olivia.\" He originally planned to entitle \"Call me By Your Name\" \"Oliver\" as a result.\n\nWasn’t O’Neill a nut? Married a ton of times and to the gay guy involved in the Chippendales murder? Or maybe killed in that murder.\n\nI’m too lazy to look it up. And I know one of you guys will have the gossip.\n\nAnyway, loved this movie. Was a big deal for any teen in the 70s. Was surprised reading the O’Neill was kind of awful because she was perfect and lovely in this.\n\nI had seen a lot of dramatic movies before 1971, and preferred them over kids movies. I saw Summer of 42 when I was seven years old; thus began my love affair with cinematography of films. I was the weird kid a couple summers later who sneaked into the Exorcist and Papillon while my friends saw American Graffiti and the World's Greatest Athlete. Mom thought I went to watch the stupid comedies and musicals. Summer of 42 holds a special place in my formation though.\n\nR26 O'Neill has certainly had a weird life. She was born in Brazil to an English mother and Brazilian father, but had an uppercrust Manhattan upbringing (I'm not sure what her father/mother did career-wise, but she was an equestrienne and studied at the Dalton School, so I'm assuming the family was wel-off/had connections). She mad a shit ton of money as a teen model before transitioning into acting. Her acting career had a weird trajectory. \"Summer of '42\" was obviously a huge deal, but she later ended up in a number of Italian films later on, and had a lead in David Cronenberg's \"Scanners\".\n\nAnd yeah, she was married to the gay closet-case choreographer Nick De Noia, who was later murdered. According to articles about it, she was apparently deeply upset by his death. She became a born-again Christian and anti-abortion activist in her late-thirties. Today, I think she fancies herself a motivational speaker. I don't blame her for being traumatized by her abortion, but I am always skeptical of people who use their experience as a blanket reality for mankind:\n\n[quote]I was told a lie from the pit of hell: that my baby was just a blob of tissue. The aftermath of abortion can be equally deadly for both mother and unborn child. A woman who has an abortion is sentenced to bear that for the rest of her life.\n\nI saw the movie at the Is was part of a double feature at a drive-in when I was eleven. I thought Oscy (Jerry Houser) was hot.\n\nMom bought the book, and I asked her if I could read it. She said \"no\", so I got up at 6:00am several days to read it when Mom was still sleeping.\n\nI read the book hoping there would be some dialogue about Oscy's pubic hair. I figured by the amount of hair in his armpits and his eyebrows, he had a huge one I wanted to see. I was disappointed. I stuck with my fantasy."
