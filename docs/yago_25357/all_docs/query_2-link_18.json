        "text": "On May 17, 2024 Larry Bean of Chelsea, Michigan, 64, took his last breath and peacefully passed into the world of endless Caves, Rocks and Coke. What an amazingly special person he was in so many ways! Even on his deathbed, he had that sweet, calm, Larry smile that always warmed the hearts of those around him. I didn't just lose my husband but truly my best friend and partner in life! He was an amazing man and lived every day of his life to the fullest. I do rejoice in the fact that he will no longer suffer, which he has tremendously in the last 3 years, from the cancer beast that moved into our home. Our son Jasper and I shared his last moments together and it was so good to see him finally out of pain. My heart is broken but I am so blessed that he gave me Jasper, and 33 years of endless love and fun!\n\nLarry grew up in the shadow of the Shrine of the Little Flower church in Royal Oak and attended the catholic schools there. He acquired a Master’s degree in his passion in life, Geology, from Wayne State and used that to hold a 34 year career with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, where he regulated landfills as a dual district supervisor. We met at the State District Office, married in 1991, traveled for 10 years and had our son Jasper (named after a Michigan rock of course) in 2001 who has been the complete joy of our life.\n\nThe Fisher Ridge Cave System that is one of the longest caves in the world was discovered, explored and mapped by Larry and several other cavers. This was the love of his life before he met me! He loved rock collecting and even collected rare copper crystals in Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula with other geology friends. The rock theme continued into Rock Climbing, and teaching Geology as an adjunct professor at the University of Michigan Dearborn and Eastern Michigan University. He taught many local people, young and old alike, a love of rocks at the Waterloo Geology Eddy Center for many years.\n\nHe loved reptiles and snakes and cared for several box turtles as pets for over 30 years which gave him the name “Uncle Turtle” by his many nieces and nephews. Larry and I shared a love of all things old and found our dream 1870 historic home in Chelsea and filled it with antiques from our hobby of going to auctions. Trains of all sizes were another passion of his and he held the position of President of the Chelsea Depot Association for several years.\n\nLarry was a one in a million person who had an infectious lifelong childlike wonder of everything around him. He was a little boy in a man’s body and he made life fun for all around him. He never had a mean thing to say about anyone and was very loving, forgiving and patient. I will carry him in my heart forever and look for him at the rainbow bridge in paradise!\n\nFuneral will be held at the Chelsea Depot on Wednesday, May 22, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. with viewing from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Larry would not have wanted flowers, but for donations to go to the Chelsea Depot Association which he loved dearly!"
