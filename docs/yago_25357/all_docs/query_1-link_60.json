        "text": "Today is the 45th anniversary of One Life to Live, which premiered on July 15, 1968 originally on ABC. In 2013, the show continues to be groundbreaking, and to fight back against all odds.\n\nAfter it was canceled in 2011, and aired its last episode in January 2012, Prospect Park remounted, relaunched, and revitalized the show, bringing it online to Hulu and now to cable television on OWN, with the first episodes beginning to air this week.\n\nTo mark the big 45th, TV Guide talked with series stars: Erika Slezak, Kassie DePaiva, Jerry verDorn, Tuc Watkins and Melissa Archer to get their picks for the Best Moments in the history of the show. Here are a few of their choices:\n\nViki Goes to Heaven (1987, 2008, 2012): Victoria Lord (Slezak) has been to heaven and back no less than three times on One Life to Live. During her first out-of-body experience, she ascends during brain surgery and meets up with deceased friends and loved ones, including her ex-husband Joe Riley. “I love the heaven story line,” says Slezak. “It was so different and so unusual.” In 2008, show creator Agnes Nixonappears during Viki’s celestial visit as “The Creator.” And Viki’s late daughter, Megan (Jessica Tuck) escorts Viki to the pearly gates one final time in 2012 before the show stopped airing on ABC.\n\nKelly Kills Blair’s Baby (1997): “I love the drama,” DePaiva says of her 20-year (and counting) run as Blair on One Life to Live. “I’ve had so many great stories. Blair’s just been front-burner for so many things.” In one of the juicier plot lines in the late ’90s, Blair and her cousin Kelly (Gina Tognoni) clash after Blair discovers that Kelly was the one behind the wheel of a car that crashed into her, killing her unborn baby — who was also a match to donate much-needed bone marrow to Blair’s other daughter, Starr.\n\nDavid Finds Out He’s Bo’s Son (2009): After originally thinking Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) was his brother, David Vickers discovers that Bo is actually his father, having had a one-night stand with his mother years prior. The two eventually form a close bond. Watkins says he appreciated the opportunity the story line afforded him to work with Woods. “We have a lot of laughs,” he says. “It was nice for two actors who had been on the same show for a long time who had one kind of relationship, which was acrimonious — because he was basically a good guy and I was a bad guy, and I was always trying to get away with stuff, and he was always trying to prevent me from getting away with stuff. And then all of a sudden, we found out we’re father and son, so it completely changes the dynamic between us. It’s really been fun to play that second part.”\n\nViki vs. Dorian (ongoing): From the show’s early episodes, the central story line pitted Viki against her stepmother, Dorian — and their frequent clashes have carried on right up to the present. Over 40 years of affairs, blackmail and betrayals, the two might be considered the original frenemies. Their latest dustup? Dorian, now a senator, is involved in a CIA cover-up scandal, which was brought to light by none other than The Banner, Viki’s newspaper. “Everything Dorian does, as evil and horrible as it is, she does because she believes it is the right thing to do,” Says Slezak. Adds Watkins: “I think in a nutshell One Life to Live is good versus evil. And it all stems from Viki versus Dorian. And I believe that there is no One Life to Live without Viki versus Dorian.”\n\nSo now we throw it to you our beloved fans of One Life to Live, today being anniversary day? What is your favorite storyline or moments in the history of the iconic series? Share your thoughts below!\n\nOn General Hospital, viewers will now see Lindsay Hartley stepping back into the role of Sam McCall temporary filling-in once again for Kelly Monaco.\n\nHartley began airing on today’s Thursday, August 22nd episode and reportedly via Soap Opera Digest, is only back for a “short-term stint.” Lindsay is no stranger to the soaps having also appeared as Theresa on Passions; Arianna on Days of Our Lives; and as Cara on All My Children.\n\nBack in 2020, when Kelly Monaco had to step away from GH for a bit, Hartley first took on the part. Later, she returned to play Sam in 2021, and once again in January of 2024. Taking to her Instagram Story, Hartley wrote, “Grateful to be stepping in again.” She was pictured in a photo from the funeral of Molly (Kristen Vaganos) and TJ’s (Tajh Bellow) baby alongside her on-screen mother, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) and also Kristina played by Kate Mansi.\n\nThe timing of Kelly’s temporary exit comes at a pivotal time for the character as her man, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) awaits to see just what the prognosis is of his ex-wife, Lulu, who has been in a coma in a longterm care facility, plus all the drama between the Davis sisters.\n\nLast fall, Monaco celebrated her 20th anniversary with General Hospital and her fans have been clamoring for her to have more story as Sam has been a bit back-burnered of late. Is that all about to change? Stay tuned.\n\nSo, glad that if anyone was replacing Kelly, it was soap vet, Lindsay Hartley? Share your thoughts via the comment section below.\n\nJust a few weeks before its season five premiere on Monday, September 9th, CBS Media Ventures had already renewed daytime’s The Drew Barrymore Show for its sixth season, which means the talker will continue on at least through the 2025-2026 season.\n\nWhile The Drew Barrymore Show will continue airing on CBS stations in its current time slot, it also has been given a higher profiles spots in the schedule in seven of the top 20 markets.\n\nIn a statement, Wendy McMahon, President and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures announced on Thursday, “Drew is a one-of-a-kind talent who is an integral part of the CBS and Paramount family. This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nMcMahon added, “Over the last few seasons, stations have realized that The Drew Barrymore Show’is like no other series in daytime, bringing Drew’s brand of positivity and ad-friendly content to viewers on a consistent basis. Many of these upgrades now pair ‘Drew’ with a CBS Mornings lead-in, which has proven to be a powerful combination.
