        "text": "I am sitting here watching womens pool quarter final match and it is the family Laurence acting as commentators and Ewa is pretty good and Mitch is as usual fairly irritating to listen to and after having watched quite a few streams lately each if which have a budget that pales in comparison with anything on TV I start to listen and there is so many little things he does that trigger me, I almost wish he would just pull out an old school chalk board and grate his fingernails on it because he stays pretty much stays just under that threshhold. Nothing major it is a death of a thousand cuts kind of thing.\n\nHere is a single example of what irritates me about him. Ewa is talking about a situation on the table and give her opinion about it and Mitch waits till Ga Young Kim shoots and then he answers Ewa's question in future tense even though the shot is off and the outcome is obvious.\n\nEwa - \"I think she has a shot on the one ball in the corner pocket\"\n\nThe commentator's pause and Ga Young shoots, she make the one no problem slight cut\n\nAfter the shot is hit and the one ball is down Mitch says - \"She does\"\n\nMitch I doubt you read AZ but if you do come upon this in the future try to use past tense when this happens again, since the shot has already happened, I would like to hear you say \"She did\"\n\nI could add to this list constantly, the man has been commentating on women's matches for years he is married to a great pool player but he comes off as a complete newbie, why not represent himself to be a knowledgeable pool rail bird versus whatever it is he trying to act like he is from the booth currently. There is no way he is truly that clueless in real life about pool. But then again maybe Mitch is being completely real and if so I have to ask myself why is he in the booth?\n\nWe all know the WPBA is in big trouble - and some feel they brought it upon themselves because of their attitudes and actions. I think the model just won't work in these economic times - but they never did learn to adapt.\n\nI think their biggest mistake was basically forcing Peg Ledman to quit.\n\nSo - the question is: How much does the WPBA pay to Mitch and Ewa to commentate these matches.\n\nLets assume there are 3 matches per event (although I think some events may have more). I also assume they get paid more if there are more TV matches.\n\nAt one time I knew what they got paid - I don't know what it is now. I do know you would be shocked at the number.\n\nMitch just does not get it - he never gets any better. I was watching one match earlier today. I think it was Ga Young - who had the 8 and 9 ball. They make the 8-ball the shot of the match. It is a no-brainer 3 rail position. If you make the ball it was natural (or close to it).\n\nIt i really is pathetic. Don't know if it is ESPN or WPBA or the production company or the directors. But the coverage and the excitement is pretty sad.\n\nNot to mention what it costs everyone. So-how much does Ewa and Mitch get paid??? What do you think they SHOULD get paid. If it was your gig, how much would you pay them - or someone else?\n\nMark Griffin\n\nIt i really is pathetic.

So-how much does Ewa and Mitch get paid??? What do you think they SHOULD get paid. If it was your gig, how much would you pay them - or someone else?\n\nMark Griffin\n\nWhat to pay them I guess expenses plus $500 to $1000 apiece per match I think would be top dollar I expect they get more than that but if so I think they are overpaid in comparison with what the tournament pays.\n\nI have heard that ESPN pays ~$250k for a tourney including the right to replay as much as they want and they require fairly high production level so they do the production for the same amount 250k thus being on TV does not pay any money into the women's tourney fund. I expect this amount probably includes paying the on air talent. In comarison much of any and all pro sports depend heavily on their TV contract, not so in pool we depend mostly on entry fees and promotr added money.\n\nWell, Mitch is Mitch, in my opinion, he does a decent job. Commentating is a way to avoid the dreaded dead air. He's no more silly than the announcers for the NFL NBA OR MLB.\n\nMy friend those people in all of those sports come off as if they understand their specific sport from a high level and they all seem know details (Dennis Leary was an exception). They know what is easy and what is hard, they know some history, they are not amazed if a player jogs or throws a ball they are amazed when a player jumps and catches a ball stretched out and hold on after getting hit. TV baseball watchers have long been watching the a baseball game on TV and listening to it on the radio. This say there is a difference in people who commentate on a sport and it is recognized by people who follow that sport.\n\nMitch Larence comes off as someone who does not understand pool beyond a low introductory level. We the people who love pool (I am including you) need announcers who speak about the game in a knowledgeable manner. The announcer represents the game and the game deserves to be represented better. I guarantee that pool needs really good commentary.\n\nI suggest better commentary would elevate the value of our sport in the mainstream. I see it on Accu Stats and streams and most of that is all live I believe the stuff on TV is dubbed in later so it should be even better.\n\nElvicash:\n\nWe obviously have different sources - lol.\n\nI have heard the production costs for a WPBA event are in the $50-$60,000 range per event (assuming 3 matches). Sometimes they do 5 or matches (I think).\n\nI know ESPN gives them something but it is NOWHERE near the $250,000 you heard. I am betting it is close to zero - but they get part of revenue when they are shown - here or abroad.\n\nThe question of Laurence salaries for commentary. I believe it would be worth maybe $1,000 per match (for them both).\n\nI have heard it is 5 times that amount. That comes out to $15,000 per tournament (based on 3 matches). I think that is excessive, especially knowing what the top players make.\n\nI think this might be the status because of Ewa's past with the WPBA. Which is a bad reason. They shoud be compensated by performance.\n\nI was looking for confirmation of these figures. But I will throw out what I heard and see if it is confirmed.\n\nMark Griffin\n\nHe's a super nice guy in person, a complete idiot as an announcer, but super nice Guy.\n\nHow else are you going to keep all the girls knicknames alive without him?\n\nIts pretty hard to comment in 9 ball tho.... \"What do you think she's going to do here?\" \"She's gonna shoot the next ball in line! Duh. \"\n\nHe seems like a genuinely nice guy and that is probably a big reason he is there, that they feel he is likeable to the audience. I don't think the WPBA telecasts are even geared towards us more knowledgeable fans but more to the casual observer. While Mitch does come off as not having a clue about the game I think it is just the style of the telecasts that he asks the obvious question (that we all know the answer to so interpret it as stupid) just to give the \"expert\" commentator (Ewa, Jeanette...) the opportunity to provide the insight for the uninformed audience tuning in. I mean I'd have a hard time believing he knows so little about the game after all these years.\n\nBTW, if I hear Ewa, after a player makes a shot and gets shape, say \"How'd she hit that?\" one more time, it will be too many.\n\nCommentators are a important cog in the wheel, when it comes to watching pool, to me anyways. I guess it's because, unless I mute it, I hear every word they say. I'm not able to \"tune them out\" or down consciously.\n\nI'm also the type of person that tends to get bothered by little things that most people don't even pick up. I find it difficult to express a opinion about a commentator, without them or someone that likes them, not getting offended by it. Commentating is something that is very personal to each person. What they say, how they say it, the tone of their voice and many other things all play a part in each person's experience. So while I could not stand someone's commentating, it doesn't mean I would not enjoy that person's company in real life. It's a action that is not tied to anything else.\n\nIt's kind of like that question from the wife \"Do I look good in this\"? You can love that person to death, think they're the greatest person in the world, but if you answer that question, your answer has the whole enchilada riding on it.\n\nHaving said all that, Mitch has always bugged the living crap out of me, AS A COMMENTATOR.\n\nThe ridiculous clapping at every shot, is also something that ruins my experience when watching pool. If there was anyway you could mute the sound of the commentating and the audience, but still be able to hear the balls, then I would be happy. If you clap at everything, then what meaning does clapping have? Can you imagine hearing your opponent telling you \"Good Shot\" after EVERY shot you shoot?:smile:"
