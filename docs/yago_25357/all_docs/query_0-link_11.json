Thanks.\n\n> --\n\nOLTL's Mitch Lawrence - Roscoe Born\n\nSome people die for their art, but Mitch Lawrence died because of art.\n\nDorian klled the cult leader/drug leader/lunatic with a piece of\n\nsculpture -- because he tried to rape her daughter, Cassie.\n\nWhen Llanview was looking for a cult leader, Mitch Lawrence was happy to\n\nprovide the service. He lured many townspeople into his cult, including a\n\nvulnerable Tina, and hypnotized a majority of them into killing people.\n\nThankfully, Tina never became a murderer. Actually Mitch was running his\n\ncult as a cover for a drug ring, but that didn't make him any less crazy. He\n\nwas a maniac who tried to rape Cassie, then a neophyte reporter who was\n\ninvestigating him on one of her first big stories. When he got in trouble,\n\nKevin wasn't around to rescue her (he was in grade school instead). Her\n\nmother, Dorian had to come to her rescue. Dorian hit Mitch over the head\n\nwith a sculpture and killed him. Dorian was convicted of murdering this nut\n\nand was sent to Statesville Prison. She was let out a few months later when\n\nevidence revealed that she had murdered Mitch in self -defense.\n\nactually this is a good site\n\nhttp://www.roscoeborn.com/press/post1997.htm#eos092002\n\nhope I helped cause I had no idea who he was either... I've only been\n\nwatching OLTL since 1991 ish\n\nî—“\n\nOn Wed, 23 Oct 2002, Suzanne D. wrote:\n\n> I wasn't watching when Mitch was on, so could someone please give answers to\n\n> these questions?\n\n>\n\n> 1.

What is his relevance to Viki/Jess/Natalie/Allison?\n\nOkay, I'm going to try and answer all these in the following.\n\nWhen Mitch first arrived in Llanview, he was with Tina. He knew of a\n\nlittle known detail in Victor Lord's will that read: \"If Viki becomes\n\nNiki, she loses the fortune\" which made Tina inherit it all. He also knew\n\nthat Tina was really Victor Lord's only other surviving child (no one knew\n\nof Todd then). At a Banner dinner, they rigged things hoping Niki would\n\ncome out, then Mitch proceeded to gaslight Viki. He set it up eventually\n\nto make it look like Viki killed Harry O'Neill (I may be a little off here\n\nbut its the gist of the material), and instead the crime was pinned on\n\nTina. At the trial, Viki became Niki and cleared Tina, caught Mitch, and\n\nwe were stuck with Niki for awhile.\n\nMitch was shipped off to prison (part of the reason why I won't buy him as\n\nthe twins' father, the other being Viki did not have a part in the cult\n\nstory). While in jail, he found \"religion\" and set up a phony jail break\n\nwhich he came across as all good and pure. In reality, he was the\n\nmastermind and had others take the fall. He was let out by pardon for his\n\npart in controling the prison revolt and he added to Llanview where he set\n\nup a ministry (ie. cult). He ensnared pretty young women and gullible\n\nyoung men. He drugged them (or that was the excuse) and picked one of the\n\nfaithful to sleep with him at night. Marilynn Dennison refused which\n\nbrought Tom (her father) to town. He was a dead ringer for Viki's dead\n\nhusband Joe.\n\nAnyway -- Cassie went undercover to get the goods on the cult, got\n\ndrugged, picked by Mitch to be his disciple and worship in his room/bed\n\none night. Dorian arrived, conked him over the head, got Cassie out, went\n\nto jail. Mitch is dead and buried -- we've even seen his headstone and\n\nhad Tina remark on not much loss.\n\nThe next time we see Mitch is during Viki's heaven visitation. She is on\n\nthe ship and must face issues, one of which is Niki. Mitch is there as an\n\nantagonist (sic). When she defeats him, he is sentenced to a life of\n\nsilence."
