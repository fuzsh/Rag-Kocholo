She attended and graduated from the High School of Performing Arts, and later attended the Yale School of Drama on a full scholarship. She is a founding member of the American Conservatory Theatre, and began her extensive daytime career in 1967. She is best known for her role as Dorian Lord on the soap opera Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968), and as 300-year-old witch Hecuba on the soap opera Passions (1999). She announced in late 1999 that she will leave her Emmy-winning role of Dorian Lord in January 2000, in order to devote her energies to promoting women's health issues, namely menopause awareness."
