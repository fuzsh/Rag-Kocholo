        "text": "1. Dr. Ted Hale’s “murder,” 1968\n\nMeredith Lord loved Dr. Larry Wolek, but her overbearing father, Victor, pushed her to get engaged to Dr. Ted Hale. Meredith eventually broke off the engagement and soon after, Dr. Hale’s body was found at the bottom of a fire escape staircase. Larry was arrested for murder, with Nurse Karen Martin confirming that she’d heard Wolek threaten Ted. Larry was freed when it was revealed that Ted simply lost his footing and tripped.2. Victor Lord’s “murder,” 1976\n\nWhen stroke patient Victor died under mysterious circumstances, his murder remained a mystery for decades. Finally in 1994, his daughter, Viki, presented evidence which led to the arrest of his widow and Viki’s rival, Dorian. Viki’s alter Tori was revealed to be the real killer, but then in 2003, they learned that Victor hadn’t died! Mitch was caring for the elderly man (who suffered from a heart problem), and attempted to remove Natalie’s ticker so he could give it to Lord. However, she was saved and Victor died for real … we think.3. Marco Dane’s “murder,” 1978\n\nSchemer Marco planned to market doctored racy photos of Tina, but instead blackmailed Viki with them. When she came to pay him, Viki found him dead and was charged with his murder. During the trial, Marco’s twin, Mario, testified that Marco had been concerned about Viki’s threats. Viki was indicted, but housewife Karen — who’d been working as a hooker for Marco — knew that a fellow prostitute, Katrina, had seen the real murderer. Karen was forced to confess her profession on the stand, and between her and Katrina’s testimonies, there was enough evidence to exonerate Viki. However, soon after, Karen learned that Mario was Marco, who hadn’t died after all.4. The Blood Moon murders, 1982\n\nDuring the filming of Marco’s murder mystery, Blood Moon, life began imitating art when the lead, Rudy, was killed. Marco and Ed set out to trap the killer, but their plan went awry when Edwina was shot and almost died. The murderer turned out to be Kyle Dickinson, the son of the serial murderer on whom the movie was based. 5. Harry O’Neill’s murder, 1985\n\nTina’s ex, Mitch Laurence, came to town with plans to marry the rich, young woman who’d recently learned she was Victor’s child. In order for Tina to gain full possession of Vic’s estate, Mitch attempted to bring out Viki’s alter Niki, kill Clint and frame Viki for the crime. His plan worked … sort of. He succeeded in luring out Niki, but Tina soon confronted him about his scheme. They fought over the gun and in the ensuing struggle, Mitch shot Niki’s boyfriend Harry. Tina was tried for murder, and unfortunately for her, Viki reverted to herself and couldn’t remember the incident. The charges were eventually dropped when Dr. Polk coaxed Niki out and she cleared Tina of the crime. Mitch was sent to prison.6. Mitch Laurence’s “murder,” 1986\n\nAfter being released from prison, Mitch threatened Tina and then tried to rape Dorian’s daughter Cassie. Understandably, La Lord went ballistic and whacked Mitch over the head with a candlestick. Dorian was jailed for her crime, but when an audiotape of the incident emerged proving that she’d acted in self-defense, she was exonerated."
