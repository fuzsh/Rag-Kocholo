        "text": "What to pay them I guess expenses plus $500 to $1000 apiece per match I think would be top dollar I expect they get more than that but if so I think they are overpaid in comparison with what the tournament pays.\n\nI have heard that ESPN pays ~$250k for a tourney including the right to replay as much as they want and they require fairly high production level so they do the production for the same amount 250k thus being on TV does not pay any money into the women's tourney fund. I expect this amount probably includes paying the on air talent. In comarison much of any and all pro sports depend heavily on their TV contract, not so in pool we depend mostly on entry fees and promotr added money.\n\nMy friend those people in all of those sports come off as if they understand their specific sport from a high level and they all seem know details (Dennis Leary was an exception). They know what is easy and what is hard, they know some history, they are not amazed if a player jogs or throws a ball they are amazed when a player jumps and catches a ball stretched out and hold on after getting hit. TV baseball watchers have long been watching the a baseball game on TV and listening to it on the radio. This say there is a difference in people who commentate on a sport and it is recognized by people who follow that sport.\n\nMitch Larence comes off as someone who does not understand pool beyond a low introductory level. We the people who love pool (I am including you) need announcers who speak about the game in a knowledgeable manner. The announcer represents the game and the game deserves to be represented better. I guarantee that pool needs really good commentary.\n\nI suggest better commentary would elevate the value of our sport in the mainstream. I see it on Accu Stats and streams and most of that is all live I believe the stuff on TV is dubbed in later so it should be even better.\n\nYeah, well, I don't have anything to say about Denis Leary because I don't know what sport he was or is a commentator on. However, Dennis Miller did MNF, is that what you are talking about? A bit of irony if so.\n\nI watched a little pool on ESPN yesterday it was pretty sad. The camara man keep getting in the way of the shooter as they were walking around the table. The player would have to wait for him to get out of the way and then set up for the shot. Even the camaras that were shooting from a distance kept showing strange angles and switching right in the middle of shots. Then the next match had Jeanette Lee vs some unknowen. In one game Jeanette slopped two ball to get out and the crowd was cheering like she played them, completey clueless. I was shocked to hear Ewa say she slopped in a couple of balls to win that game. That is the first time I've ever heard any one call it what it was slop. My hats off to her.\n\nI watched a little pool on ESPN yesterday it was pretty sad.

I to noticed the crummy camera work , there were 3 or 4 balls on the rail opposite the camera during the Kim/Villarreal match that i couldn't identify and they never did a close-up. Those people in Detroit , Chicago and Texas know what bad play by play commentating is , know Mitch Laurence doesn't hold a candle to Josh Lewin's irrelevant commentary during baseball games ."
