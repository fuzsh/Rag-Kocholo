        "text": "It’s so much fun watching One Life to Live these days which, with its current LGBT equality storyline, is reflecting what is going on in the real world right now. On Monday’s episode, we have the aftermath of mayoral candidate Dorian Lord’s announcement that not only is she a lesbian, but she is engaged to her campaign manager, Amelia.\n\nThe Oliver-Kyle-Nick storyline is center stage with Fish knowing the Dorian lesbian thing is a sham. Amelia and Nick are afraid he’ll spill the beans. Kyle defends his college lover so vehemently that it is clear he’s still in love with Oliver.\n\nEveryone is a bit overwrought in this episode so the one-liners from David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) are most welcome!\n\nNOTE: The clips may overlap a bit because I had to go to two different sources to get all the scenes."
