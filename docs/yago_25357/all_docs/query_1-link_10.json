Their cat-fights are fabulous, but there hasn’t been a good one between them since the night of Asa’s funeral when Dorian finally confessed to Viki that she killed her father, Victor Lord. I had watched Dorian (then Nancy Pinkerton) smother Victor Lord with a pillow in his hospital bed, and I’ve been waiting years for Viki to find out. But, instead of pursuing this potentially great story-line, the writers had Viki running off to Paris TX, becoming a waitress, and meeting Charlie. Dorian goes to Paris TX, meets Charlie; and, now we have yet another Dorian chasing after Viki’s man story! (Don’t get me wrong - I adore Charlie!)\n\nThere is no statute of limitations on murder. While Viki had no love left for her sexually-abusive father, I’m sure she would like to bring his killer to justice. Then again, maybe not. But, this would be a great little tidbit to hold over Dorian’s head and make her squirm (for a change). The great Doctor Dorian Lord a murderer…that would certainly rock the citizens of Llanview! But, Dorian could surprise Viki by confessing that she killed Victor to make him pay for sexually abusing Viki all those years. For a brief moment in their hate-hate relationship, Dorian had actually felt compassion for her arch enemy!\n\nThere are a lot of possibilities for Dorian’s revelation to Viki. Maybe one day the writer’s will actually pursue some of them and give us more Viki vs. Dorian!\n\nQuote bolin: One of my favorite things to watch on OLTL is Viki vs. Dorian.

Originally he died due to Dorian’s withholding his medication. Michael Malone’s version had him killed by Viki (acting as Tori) for the years of incest/abuse she had suffered at his hands. She held a pillow over his face.\n\nPersonally I dont care how he croaked, as long as hes dead, we hope. It seems whatever site you go to, states something different. But I do know that Dorian didnt smother him. The writers are nuts.\n\nQuote SOAPKID: To me ... the only good reason to have Viki around is to spar with Dorian. As mean as Dorian gets at times ... I still like her 100% better than Viki. Viki's too goodie 2 shoes. Do as I say not as I do and she's raising 2 clones ... so for me ... Dorian is the more interesting character.\n\nI won’t go that far (Dorian is my favorite), but I love the scenes between Vicki and Dorian. I thought Dorian’s reveal was a little off (Dorian was accused years ago then he comes back from the dead), but I did like that she was that she only had One Life. Vicki is more interesting around new characters. Charlie doesn’t even know about Vicki’s DID yet.\n\nP.S. Where is Addie? I thought she had a secret (and I hope it wasn’t just that she likes Miles). She hit it right on the head that Dorian needs to find her own man and stop competing with Vicki!\n\nQuote SOAPKID: To me ... the only good reason to have Viki around is to spar with Dorian.
