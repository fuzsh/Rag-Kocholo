        "text": "The Economist consulted bibliophile data scientists to bring you the answer\n\n“A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short,” wrote Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher of the 19th century. People are living longer than they did in Schopenhauer’s day, but the number of books has increased by a much bigger factor. So his dictum ought to carry even more weight now than it did then.\n\nIn issuing it, the famously pessimistic philosopher was uncharacteristically optimistic. He thought that readers could reliably discern which books deserved their time and which did not. That faith has waned. The idea of a literary canon has come under attack. Some readers would pry it open to admit more works by women and non-white authors; others would just sink it. Critics have lost cultural clout. The number of newspapers with book-review sections has dwindled. These days, it seems, everyone has their own personal canon.\n\nAnd yet the need for winnowing persists, so much so that book recommendations seem to be almost as popular as the books they suggest. Influencers on BookTok, a bookish corner of TikTok, a video app, have replaced the credentialled judges of yore. Thousands of readers rate and review books on Goodreads, a website with tens of millions of members. Rebind, an app that is now in a test version, will let readers of classic books use artificial intelligence to question experts about the texts. The Economist periodically publishes best-book lists, plus reviews and recommendations on specific subjects.\n\nStill, the number of texts that people are told they should read seems overwhelming. One way to prune is to see where best-book lists overlap, on the theory that books that appear most often must be really worth your while. That is what a website called thegreatestbooks.org has done. Its creator, Shane Sherman, a computer programmer in Texas, has used more than 300 lists to come up with a list of lists, which he calls, not entirely seriously, the “greatest books of all time” (GBOATs). It has more than 10,000 books, ranked by how often they appear on the constituent lists. You can search the top 500 below and sort them by decade or century of publication, year of publication, language and length.\n\nExplore the 500 highest ranked books\n\nFilter by\n\n1\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nGabriel García Márquez, 1967\n\n7 hours and 40 minutes to read\n\nAdd to list\n\n2\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nF.

To help readers spend time wisely, we’ve included roughly how long it would take to read each book on this list of lists using estimates provided by Harry Tong, the co-founder of howlongtoread.com, a search engine. (He uses the length of an audiobook to calculate roughly how much time it would take to read it silently.) People read at different speeds, and some books are slower-going than others: one book club took 28 years to read “Finnegans Wake” by James Joyce (ranked 325th), a book you can polish off in 12 hours, our data say.\n\nThe book at the very top of Mr Sherman’s list on July 1st was “One Hundred Years of Solitude”, a pioneering work of magical realism. Mr Tong estimates that it should take only seven hours and 40 minutes of solitude to read, about average for a GBOAT. Second-ranked “The Great Gatsby”, a slim novel of Jazz-Age America, should take a mere two hours and 51 minutes. But number three, Joyce’s “Ulysses”, published at around the same time, demands a commitment of nearly 15 hours. If you spend 15 minutes a day reading, as the average American does, that’ll take you two months, which seems like a cheeky demand for a book whose action takes place on a single day. “Where The Wild Things Are” (421st GBOAT) takes just one minute to read, if you don’t dwell on the delightful illustrations. Impatient readers may be relieved to know that there is no correlation between length and greatness.\n\nA list of lists by its nature reflects a cultural consensus. If that’s the case, the culture is making some odd choices. The highest-ranked book that isn’t a novel is Dante Alighieri’s “Divine Comedy”, a 14th-century poem about the author’s journey from hell to purgatory to paradise. It appears at number 27. The Bible, by “Unknown”, is the 34th gboat. “Hamlet”, the first of Shakespeare’s six entries, is number 83. The “First Folio”, a compendium of his plays, ranks 126th.\n\nMost GBOATs were originally written in English and since the start of the 20th century. And the literary compass points almost due West. After “One Hundred Years of Solitude” (set in a country that resembles Colombia, the birthplace of its author) nothing else both set in and by an author based in the global south appears until “Things Fall Apart”, a historical novel set in Nigeria, at number 50.\n\nThe Bible aside, the first non-fiction book to appear, at number 60, is “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank, who hid from the Nazis in Amsterdam but was discovered, and murdered at Bergen-Belsen in 1945. Among GBOATs popularity can pull rank on profundity. “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” is 134th, eight places higher than “The Republic” by Plato, a canonical Greek philosopher. Schopenhauer, sadly, does not make the top 500.\n\nAlthough Mr Sherman is mainly doing statistics, he’s also doing some old-fashioned gatekeeping, mainly by varying the weights of the lists in his database. (He updates both the weightings and, as new lists appear, the rankings.) His adjustments seem sensible. He subtracts points from lists that use only books published over short time periods, for example. Lists that rely too much on non-experts and ones from a single region also lose points. Alongside the GBOATs Mr Sherman has come up with a choosier “global literary canon”, which limits each country to three books and imaginative literature to 80% of the entries (you can vary some of these weightings on his website).\n\nYet readers hungry for self-improvement as well as entertainment may yearn for the bracing smack of 19th-century-style prescriptiveness, the sort you would have got from Sir John Lubbock’s “one hundred best books”, a version of which was published in 1887. The spirit of Lubbock, described by a journalist as the “godfather” of best-books lists, lives on in the syllabuses of great-books courses at some universities. Homer, Virgil and St Augustine appear on Lubbock’s list and among the recent readings for Literature Humanities, a course that freshmen at Columbia College are required to take. (They’re all GBOAT authors, too.)\n\nFor Schopenhauer, shunning whatever is popular was an important part of reading wisely: “You should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public.” That is probably too dogmatic for the BookTok generation. But the more tempered advice of C.S. Lewis, a scholar of literature and author of “The Chronicles of Narnia” series for children, is worth heeding: “It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between.” And if you’re reading mainly GBOATs, the odds are it will be time well spent. ■\n\nCorrection (July 29th 2024): The reading time of some books has been updated since we first published."
