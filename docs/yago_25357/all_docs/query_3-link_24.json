She was a powerful\n\ncharacter and was my main reason for watching OLTL for a while there.\n\nSome of her most memorable work, I guess, was her affair w/ Tommy Lee Jones\n\nas the starting-off-heroic Dr. Mark Toland. Their adulterous affair scenes\n\nwere hot stuff, let me tell you. Those two were on fire together. NP Dorian\n\nwas tremendously seductive in a black widow sort of way.\n\nI'll never forget her scenes fighting for her job at the hospital when she\n\ncame under fire for the affair w/ Mark and whatever negligence of theirs\n\nthat contributed to the death of the terminally ill Rachel Wilson, w/ whom\n\nlonely Larry Wolek was smitten. She tried so valiantly to maintain composure\n\nand dignity while she made a plaintive case to Viki and to Dr. Craig. The\n\nscene of Dr. Craig coming to her after the board vote to give her the news\n\nthat she was being expelled is burned in my memory. She was crushed, it was\n\nplain to see, but fought to hold on to the personal dignity as she took the\n\nnews. Her request to know how the vote went was refused by Dr. Craig, who\n\nwas clearly sympathetic but said the vote had to remain confidential. She\n\nmistakenly, and tragically, took this to mean the vote was unanimous, an\n\nespecially stinging thought as it would mean her private case to Viki fell\n\nupon deaf ears. Her bitterness over this is what fueled her years of feuding\n\nand rivalry w/ Viki, all the more tragically ironic in that Dorian never\n\nknew Viki alone voted to save Dorian's post.\n\nI remember how she returned home to her sister Melinda after Jim fired her,\n\nher pain and humiliation building to fury. Trying to be comforting, Melinda\n\nsuggested maybe not everyone voted w/ the decision and Dorian said they must\n\nhave because Jim would have given her at least the satisfaction to know it\n\nwas not unanimous. But Dorian was wrong...she underestimated how exactingly\n\nJim executed his grim duty as chief of medicine. The ballot was to be\n\nsecret, and Jim would never betray this necessity.\n\nMelinda asked her sister what would she do, and Dorian looked off at the\n\ncamera, her eyes shining w/ the tears she held back as she stated in a\n\nsteely, icy firmness that belied the fires burning behind her promise: \"What\n\nwill I do?\" she repeated. \"I'll get even w/ them...each and every last one\n\nof them!\"\n\nShe was a very effective soap villian. Her plots usually succeeded, even\n\nwhen forced to take a circuitous route. She manipulated things very\n\ncleverly, seldom missing the mark. She was smart, decisive, effective,\n\nstrong and surprisingly passionate when she unleashed her seductive powers.\n\nThose were the days when soap writers knew how to design and deliver strong,\n\nsolid female villians, w/ multi-dimension and nuances. <sigh>\n\nNatasha\n\n\"Natasha\" <star...@attbiNOSPAM.com> posted:\n\n>She [Dorian as played by Nancy Pinkerton] was a very effective soap villian.\n\nHer plots usually succeeded, even\n\n>when forced to take a circuitous route.

She was smart, decisive, effective,\n\n>strong and surprisingly passionate when she unleashed her seductive powers.\n\nThis is what I remember too. (Also, NP could be absolutely *chilling* in her\n\ncold-blooded, calculating fury.) Unlike today's villains, who come across\n\ngenerally as bothersome little gnats who could reasonably be stopped if anyone\n\nwould bother to swat them hard enough, Dorian plotted cleverly and worked hard\n\nto make her schemes come off, and since she was, as you said, generally\n\neffective at pulling them off, she was a villainness folks couldn't just\n\ndiscount. People in Llanview had good reason to sit up and take notice of her\n\nwherever and whenever she showed up.\n\nI was 15 or 16 when I started watching. Pinkerton's Dorian actually used to\n\nscare me.\n\nMalis tried hard, but she just did not have that glint-in-the-eye,\n\nknife-in-the-back, ice-in-the-heart mien and delivery that made Pinkerton's\n\nDorian so formidable. Malis's Dorian just came off, as I said previously, as\n\nfeckless and aimlessly malevolent, rather than focused, directed, and\n\ndetermined, as Pinkerton's was.\n\nThen Strasser's was a different interpretation yet, with a lot more\n\nvulnerability showing through than Pinkerton's, but it worked, and Dorian\n\nbecame a force again--if a force of a somewhat different kind.\n\n>Those were the days when soap writers knew how to design and deliver strong,\n\n>solid female villians, w/ multi-dimension and nuances. <sigh>\n\n>\n\nI'll match your sigh and raise you two.

Great drama, or at least great melodrama, could come from that.\n\nThe problem with villains now is that they are thought of only in the short\n\nterm. Even long-term stories have short-term planning by the writers (\"we'll\n\nhave so-and-so fake a pregnancy and then she can fake a miscarriage so that the\n\npoor chump will stay with her even longer!\"). The soaps don't think about how\n\nto keep the villains redeemable or malleable. This leaves them with cartoons\n\nlike Caleb on PC, Lindsay (saved only by Cat Hickland) or Jen on OLTL, or, back\n\non AW, Grant. Villains are designed only to further plots, to be plot devices,\n\nand their own feelings or beliefs are as one-note/cartoonish as you can get.\n\nAt times there is also a tone, especially with villainesses, of \"isn't she just\n\nTERRIBLE, you HAVE to watch her\", because fans are supposed to be shocked and\n\nenthralled by what this crazy person will get away with next. This was\n\ndefinitely the intention with Jen, considering all the scenes of Jen smirking\n\nfor the camera where only the viewers could see her. But as you said, if the\n\ngood characters are made into saps solely for the bad character to triumph,\n\nthere's no reason to care. I can't remember the last time I saw an effective\n\nvillain or villainess who did not have to be surrounded by morons. It says a\n\nlot about how smart OLTL's good set are now that only two of the \"evil\"\n\ncharacters like Todd and Shawna were allowed to expose Jen's manipulations.\n\nMichelle wrote:\n\n> Which actors did you think best fit the role?\n\n>\n\n> Viki:\n\n> Gillian Spenser\n\n> Joanne Dorian\n\n> Erika Slezak\n\nES is the only Viki I've really known.\n\n> Blair:\n\n> Mia Korf\n\n> Kassie DePaiva\n\nHmm, tough one!

There was a very, very brief period when Todd & Blair first became a real\n\ncouple (after the first wedding, maybe?) when they set out to sort of thumb\n\ntheir noses at the rest of Llanview and flaunt their status as newly rich.

Then she got her\n\njob at OLTL and immediately hired him, and since he doesn't exactly have a\n\nrange (I much preferred the Gary who replaced him, although few others did),\n\nshe made Kevin a brooding drunk.
