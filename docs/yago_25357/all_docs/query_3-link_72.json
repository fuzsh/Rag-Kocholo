        "text": "The narrator describes the opening chapter in a more positive way compared to the yellow wallpaper which opens foreshadowing the upcoming event of the gothic genre. “The studio was filled with the rich odor of roses”, juxtaposes with the other text I’ve analysed which is set in a darker environment than the “summer” setting of The Picture Of Dorian Gray. Dorian is well known for his “good looks” as the narrator Basil compares him to a “brainless beauty thing, who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at”. Which connotes to the fact that there may slight references to Basil being a homosexual. The chemistry between Dorian and Basil is shown strongly at the beginning as they always were in each other’s presence. During the error of the 1900s homosexuality wasn’t accepted as you would be arrested and imprisoned for the sin and in some scenarios were killed. linking this to The Picture Of Dorian Gray, I personally think Oscar Wilde was aware of the punishments and therefore hinted the theme of homosexuality but didn’t go into detail due to him being punished for this. Along with this, Oscar himself could be talking about himself in the text as he doesn’t want to reveal his sexuality due to people not accepting it, this is shown through the character of Basil in which Oscar Wilde says ‘I knew that if I spoke to Dorian I would become absolutely\n\nThe representation of all things good and evil. Sibyl Vane represented the untouched purity of art, innocent, beautiful and graceful in her acting. Sibyl’s purity was destroyed by Dorian’s evil and cruelty that is represented by his portrait. To Dorian, art is an escape from his sins and a pleasure in life. His love for Sibyl was purely about her being able to act so Dorian respects art, “I loved you because you were marvelous, because you have genius and intellect, because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art” (94). To Basil, art is his not only his life but his escape from life. He lives his dreams in art. Basil usually painted mythical scenes with exception to Dorian’s portrait. Ironically, art is his life and art was the end of his life. Lord Henry does not seem to discuss art very much however he likes books. Henry only seems to like art that applies to him. A good example of this is the yellow book that he gives Dorian. It fits Henry’s\n\nDorian is introduced to Lord Henry Wotton. Lord Henry Wotton seems at the beginning of the novel to be the most corrupting character in the book, being the catalyst of Dorian Gray?s change in character, or realization of true character. Wotton is a cynical character, and is somewhat of a hypocrite, as Hallward rightly says (paraphrasing Charles 2nds epigram), \"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing\" (4). For all his talk, Lord Henry remains a married man who chooses a life as a spectator rather than a carouser (Miller 385). From the instant of their acquaintance, Lord Henry causes an instantaneous difference in Dorian. \"Lord Henry lives vicariously on the emotions and experiences of other people\" (Shewan 376). Lord Henry awakens in Dorian feelings and thoughts Dorian has never had before, and Dorian feels overcome with awe. When asked about his negative influence on people, Lord Henry says,\" There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral?Because to influence a person is to give him one?s own soul?\" (17). Dorian immediately develops an attachment to Lord Henry, one which Henry claims will be everlasting. Jeffrey Meyers explains, \"If Hallward is the masochistic creator of Dorian?s aesthetic glorification, Wotton (who manipulates the vanity stimulated by the portrait) is the sadistic catalyst of his moral degeneration\"(372). In fact, Ted Spivey claims that\n\nBasil Hallward and Henry Wotten are quite the opposite of each other—Basil is unwaveringly conventional in his values while Henry instead enjoys entertaining the idea of radical and inappropriate ways of thinking (on page 4, he claims that “the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary,” to which Basil responds that he “hate[s] the way [Henry] talks about his married life). Because of their profoundly contrasting ideas, they are not so much foils for each other as they are for Dorian Gray. It is by these two men that one measures Dorian’s place on the scale of morality.\n\nThe grasp Lord Henry has on Dorian Gray is evident in the first few chapters. However, Dorian is quite oblivious to this. While strolling through the garden, Lord Henry finds “Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac blossoms” (23) giving Lord Henry the sign to use his power to start ‘influencing’ Dorian. He says to him that “nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul” (23) causing Dorian to “[feel] suddenly awakened” (23). Dorian at this point is “[feeling] afraid” (23) but is “ashamed of feeling afraid” (23) because someone crosses path with him who understands life’s mystery, this is the point where readers know Lord Henry gains his firm grip on Dorian. Dorian is now upset over the fact he “[will] grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young” (28) because Lord Henry told Dorian that\n\nAnd both of them handle it in a similar way. Dorian feels bad about what he has done, only realizing that this after looking at his portrait and how it has grown to be a “foul parody” (Wilde 203) of what Basil originally painted. Instead of facing his problems, rationalizes his actions, all the while he feels “keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life.” This quote shows us that he is not the least bit ashamed about his actions, he is very well aware of the wicked rumours that surround him, but also aware that people do not really believe them because his face continues to look youthful and innocent. All the while the portrait of him is truly changing to reflect Dorian’s inner sins. Dorian seems ever interested in the bad behaviors that Lord Henry introduced to him, Lord Henry said this to Dorian, “You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.” This quote shows us how little Lord Henry cares about how much he has negatively influenced Dorian, and probably finds it as amusing as a game to see how far he can go before Dorian snaps. It is also a true statement to an extent. Throughout the book Dorian keeps in contact with Lord Henry. Dorian is fascinated by the lifestyle that he lives, asking him on advice on what to do and how to act. Every time he receives a piece of advice from Lord Henry it is another piece of Dorian that is\n\nOne conflict shown in Dorian Grey is the conflict of identity portrayed in the novel by Oscar Wilde. The character Basil describes Lord Henry to be a very influential character to another’s identity, for example, ‘Don’t spoil him. Don’t try influence him. Your influence would be bad.’ Spoiling Dorian shows that he is pure, and should not be tainted by Lord Henry’s character; this shows that Lord Henry is impure in thought and in his actions and this impacts his approach towards others. As Basil says this, it shows that he understands the flaws in Lord Henry’s character, but also his power in manipulation, especially towards someone like\n\nHe is even told by Lord Henry he is far too charming to go into philantropy. This remark may be the beginning of the flattery that opened Dorian's mind up to his corruption. Dorian is being moved by Harry's speech about cherishing youth and enjoying it. His mind was being challenged by the thought of his own passions until the point when he proclaimed \"stop! You bewilder me. I do not know what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Do not speak. Let me think. Or rather let me try not to think\". Dorian allows himself to be corrupted. He begins to fear aging and begins to think that everything will be loss with the loss of his youth and beauty. Dorian goes from no worries to this thought as Harry speaks. He was convinced that this \"new Hedonism\" was the way. This shows the weakness of his mind in his youth it is also the begginning of his fate. With this flaw of character, Dorian seemed to write his fate unknowingly. When Basil Hallward, the painter, rewarded Dorian with the portrait he replied \"If I were to be the one always young, and the picture grow old! For that-for that-Iwould give everything!…Iwould give my soul for that!\". This was just a plea at the depth of his sorrow, a remark made totally through whim.\n\nIn The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, Lord Henry’s influence on Dorian changes his character that was presented in the beginning of the book. Dorian was like a blank canvas that had no personality due to him not having a proper childhood. Due to this, he didn’t have any morals to follow. Lord Henry saw this opportunity and he awakened from him a man who turned into a immoral aestheticist who looks at things just as they are instead of what they are like personally. In The Picture of Dorian Gray, Lord Henry’s influence was significant to Dorian and to the work as a whole because of the impact it had on Dorian, and the impact it had on people close to Dorian.\n\nHe is infatuated with Dorian's beauty in the beginning. He appreciated Dorian's beauty but did not wish to possess it for himself. Basil exclaims, “When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale... I knew that I had come face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.” His love for Dorian changed the way he perceived art. Basil eventually paints a portrait of Dorian to capture his beauty forever. Basil’s portrait marks a new phase in his career. Once he has painted Dorian, he fears that he has put too much of himself into the work. Basil reluctantly introduces Dorian to Lord Henry, who he fears will have a damaging influence on Dorian. He admits, “Yes, that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you.” Basil is later envious of the relationship between Lord Henry and Dorian. Lord Henry upsets Dorian with a speech about the transient nature of beauty and youth. Basil, wishing to protect and defect him, voices his objection to Lord Henry’s influence over Dorian. Dorian felt Basil had come to realize his true personality and that he would bring it to someones attention. Basil is murdered by Dorian. The murder of Basil marks the beginning of Dorian's end. He cannot overcome the realization that he killed his friend."
