        "text": "In a new interview on her website, Erika Slezak (Viki), the six-time Daytime Emmy-winning star of One Life to Live, weighed in on a myriad of subjects, including DAYS move to the streaming platform Peacock, plus working opposite the various Dorians over the years on One Life, and none more so than the incomparable Robin Strasser.\n\nWhen discussing Days of our Lives upcoming exclusive move to Peacock on September 12th, Slezak made reference to her experience in 2013 when Prospect Park produced new episodes of One Life to Live and moved it online; following the ending of its run on network television and ABC in 2012. As OLTL fans know, unfortunately, the online version lasted only one season on Hulu.\n\nBelow are a few excerpts from Erika’s conversation had with her longtime fan club president, Walter Miller.\n\nOn DAYS’ move to Peacock, Erika expressed: “I think that’s fantastic! I emailed Ron (Carlivati, head writer) when I heard it because he was our head writer. I was delighted for him, and I asked him if he was staying? He said, ‘Yes, as far as I know I’m staying!’ I think it’s wonderful. The whole point of us going online was such a good idea. Unfortunately, it was so mishandled by the producers at Prospect Park. They knew nothing about what our audience was looking for, what THEY wanted. It was about stories and relationships and a lot of our audience was extremely offended by some of the things they were doing. We went through four head writers in three months because they kept saying, ‘We can’t write this stuff, or we don’t want to write this stuff.’ The idea behind it, Rich Frank and Jeff Kwatinetz who put it together, was a wonderful idea and we would have been the first to go online (Hulu). It was just five minutes ahead of its time and it was run by people that didn’t know what they were doing. They didn’t know how to produce a daytime drama and they pushed the envelope too far, too quickly, and then they spent too much money and then they ran out of money.”\n\nOn the rivalry between One Life to Live’s Viki and Dorian that went on for decades, Slezak discussed all the Dorian’s she worked with by noting: “They were all different, obviously. As far as I’m concerned, Robin (Strasser) WAS Dorian. Nancy Pinkerton was wonderful in the beginning, but then she left, and thank God we got Robin because she was the absolute ultimate Dorian. The wonderful thing about Robin is that she played Dorian with all the conniving and scheming, but she always had some warmth about her. Even when she was being just horrible, there was warmth there. She was just perfect! There could not have been a better Dorian, although Nancy was very good in the beginning because she had to establish the character and what they were looking for was a villain, and she was. The other ladies, I certainly remember them all: Dixie Carter, Claire Malis, Elaine Princi…they were all slightly different but, as I say, there was one Dorian and that was Robin. Dixie, Claire, and Elaine were all very good in what they were asked to do, but they never had a chance to establish a character because they were never there long enough. Robin is an actress who is so talented and who is so clever, and I have always said that she brings a Thanksgiving Day feast to every performance. She wasn’t “performing”…from the moment she walked on set, she WAS Dorian.”\n\nIf you would like to receive updates from Erika’s Fan Club, please go to the homepage at erikaslezak.com and sign up with your email.\n\nNow, what do you think of Erika’s comments on DAYS upcoming shift to Peacock as its new exclusive home? What did you think about her thoughts on Robin Strasser and the Dorians? Let us know in the comment section.\n\nOn General Hospital, viewers will now see Lindsay Hartley stepping back into the role of Sam McCall temporary filling-in once again for Kelly Monaco.\n\nHartley began airing on today’s Thursday, August 22nd episode and reportedly via Soap Opera Digest, is only back for a “short-term stint.” Lindsay is no stranger to the soaps having also appeared as Theresa on Passions; Arianna on Days of Our Lives; and as Cara on All My Children.\n\nBack in 2020, when Kelly Monaco had to step away from GH for a bit, Hartley first took on the part. Later, she returned to play Sam in 2021, and once again in January of 2024. Taking to her Instagram Story, Hartley wrote, “Grateful to be stepping in again.” She was pictured in a photo from the funeral of Molly (Kristen Vaganos) and TJ’s (Tajh Bellow) baby alongside her on-screen mother, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) and also Kristina played by Kate Mansi.\n\nThe timing of Kelly’s temporary exit comes at a pivotal time for the character as her man, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) awaits to see just what the prognosis is of his ex-wife, Lulu, who has been in a coma in a longterm care facility, plus all the drama between the Davis sisters.\n\nLast fall, Monaco celebrated her 20th anniversary with General Hospital and her fans have been clamoring for her to have more story as Sam has been a bit back-burnered of late. Is that all about to change? Stay tuned.\n\nSo, glad that if anyone was replacing Kelly, it was soap vet, Lindsay Hartley? Share your thoughts via the comment section below.\n\nJust a few weeks before its season five premiere on Monday, September 9th, CBS Media Ventures had already renewed daytime’s The Drew Barrymore Show for its sixth season, which means the talker will continue on at least through the 2025-2026 season.\n\nWhile The Drew Barrymore Show will continue airing on CBS stations in its current time slot, it also has been given a higher profiles spots in the schedule in seven of the top 20 markets.\n\nIn a statement, Wendy McMahon, President and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures announced on Thursday, “Drew is a one-of-a-kind talent who is an integral part of the CBS and Paramount family. This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nMcMahon added, “Over the last few seasons, stations have realized that The Drew Barrymore Show’is like no other series in daytime, bringing Drew’s brand of positivity and ad-friendly content to viewers on a consistent basis. Many of these upgrades now pair ‘Drew’ with a CBS Mornings lead-in, which has proven to be a powerful combination.
