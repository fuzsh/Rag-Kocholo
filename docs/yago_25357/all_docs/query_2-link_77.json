        "text": "David Laurence Hunt, 68, passed away peacefully Friday, December 18, 2020, due to complications from a stroke. Dave was born July 21, 1952, in Twin Falls, Idaho to Mitchell Wiggins, Jr. and Elizabeth Lucille Reiser Hunt.\n\nDave grew up in Menlo Park, California, and graduated from Menlo-Atherton High School. He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the England Central Mission, where he first met his beautiful sweetheart, Nancy Larson. They were married for eternity November 21, 1973 in the Salt Lake City Temple.\n\nA life-long member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Dave served in many capacities. His Christ-like love was a product of his devotion to the teachings of the gospel. He was always willing to share his unwavering testimony in a way that made others want to be better people. Others wanted to know God because they knew Dave.\n\nWhile attending college at BYU, Dave discovered an instant passion for teaching, information systems, and computer programming. His career was in IT departments for notable companies including Oracle, Tenfold, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His work took him all over the world, with home bases in California, Georgia, and Utah.\n\nFamily meant everything to Dave. He celebrated being “of good stock” and being a part of a grand eternal family. He and Nancy were loving parents to Kristie (Kevin) Moreton, James Hunt (Brook), Lisa (Bret) Peterson, Katherine (James) Helsby, Sarah (Tyler) Donaldson, and Matthew Robert (Ryan) Burton. They delighted in their 15 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild. He is also survived by his siblings: Murray (Maryjo), Rebecca (Rodney) Savage; in-laws: Warren (Sharon) Larson, David (Colleen) Larson, Janet (Royce) Otte, and Mark (Marilee) Morris, a life-long friend and brother. He was preceded in death by his parents, parents-in-law, and brother Mitchell III.\n\nDave was always seeking an opportunity to share all he had, feed the hungry, or make friends of strangers. Our desire is to keep that love alive, as Dave is alive in our hearts. To honor his memory, and in lieu of flowers, Dave would love for you to:\n\n*Be watchful for people in need and be their solution\n\n*Give someone a \"Secret Santa\" (Giving Tree)\n\n*Pay another’s debt, lighten someone’s load\n\n*Give a stranger a compliment\n\n*Donate to a charity (Utah Food Bank or Primary Children’s E.R Hunt \"Bless the Babies\" fund)\n\n*Love everyone a little more today\n\nThe family would like to thank Dr. Brady Blackham, the nurses and staff at Gunnison Valley Hospital, and Therapy West for their sincere love and care for Dad.\n\nA private family service will take place immediately. Due to current restrictions, a celebration of Dave and his effulgent life will take place in July 2021, so that we can enjoy each other’s company. If you would like further information on that gathering, or for a complete life sketch, or to share memories, please email RememberingDaveHunt@gmail.com . Online guestbook at www.maglebymortuary.com\n\nDue to COVID-19, all attendees are required to wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines."
