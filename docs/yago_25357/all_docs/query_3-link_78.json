Later, she returned to play Sam in 2021, and once again in January of 2024. Taking to her Instagram Story, Hartley wrote, “Grateful to be stepping in again.” She was pictured in a photo from the funeral of Molly (Kristen Vaganos) and TJ’s (Tajh Bellow) baby alongside her on-screen mother, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) and also Kristina played by Kate Mansi.\n\nThe timing of Kelly’s temporary exit comes at a pivotal time for the character as her man, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) awaits to see just what the prognosis is of his ex-wife, Lulu, who has been in a coma in a longterm care facility, plus all the drama between the Davis sisters.\n\nLast fall, Monaco celebrated her 20th anniversary with General Hospital and her fans have been clamoring for her to have more story as Sam has been a bit back-burnered of late. Is that all about to change? Stay tuned.\n\nSo, glad that if anyone was replacing Kelly, it was soap vet, Lindsay Hartley?

This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nMcMahon added, “Over the last few seasons, stations have realized that The Drew Barrymore Show’is like no other series in daytime, bringing Drew’s brand of positivity and ad-friendly content to viewers on a consistent basis. Many of these upgrades now pair ‘Drew’ with a CBS Mornings lead-in, which has proven to be a powerful combination. This season, in markets where ‘Drew’ airs at 9:00 a.m., its ratings are +21% higher among total viewers when CBS Mornings is the lead-in.”\n\nThe announced station upgrades will be given to CBS stations in six markets, which include five of the top 10 markets, along with a station and time slot upgrade in Houston.\n\nComing up, The Drew Barrymore Show will get the 9:00 a.m. timeslot block following “CBS Mornings” in three major markets, New York (WCBS), Dallas (KTVT) and Boston (WBZ). In three other markets, the talk show will air as an hour block at 3:00 p.m., including in Philadelphia (KYW), San Francisco (KPIX) and Miami (WFOR). In Houston, ‘Drew’ is moving to NBC affiliate KPRC and will air at 10am.\n\nMeanwhile in an interview released with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday, Barrymore addressed audience criticism for her touchy-feely nature with her guests. She told ET, “I’ll try to practice physical distance, which is not my strong point.” She added, “Do you know how hard the pandemic was for me? I was alone in a studio by myself! I like to be around people. It’s not everyone’s favorite, but I’m sorry to those people.”\n\nAre you glad that The Drew Barrymore had been picked up for a 6th season? Do you like Drew’s touchy-feely nature when hosting and chatting with her guests?
