Dr. Dorian Lord Vickers Buchanan (née Cramer; formerly Callison, Santi, Vickers, Hayes, and Laurence) is a fictional character and matriarch of the Cramer family on the American soap opera One Life to Live, most notably played for 23 years by actress Robin Strasser.

Dorian is best remembered as the long-time frenemy of Victoria Lord (Erika Slezak). Their enmity began when Dorian thought that Viki, a member of the hospital board had cast the vote having her removed from practicing medicine at Llanview Hospital. However, it was later revealed that Viki had cast the sole vote against her termination.

Dorian and Viki had been at loggerheads for many years due to this misunderstanding, but as often as they fought, they also had a lot of respect and even some kind of love. Dorian knew some of Viki's past as she had hated what her husband at the time, Victor, had done to her.

As Viki said to her, "You've made my life hell, but, in many ways, you MADE my life."

As much as either one of them would not admit it, Dorian and Viki are quite alike. At times, they would fight, but they would also team up against the common enemy.
