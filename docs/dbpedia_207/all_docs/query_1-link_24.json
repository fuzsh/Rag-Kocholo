In 1972, a group of shell collectors saw the need for a national or¬ ganization devoted to the interests of shell collectors; to the beauty of shells, to their scientific aspects, and to the collecting and preservation of mollusks. This was the start of COA. Our membership includes novices, advanced collectors, scientists, and shell dealers from around the world. In 1995, COA adopted a conservation resolution: Whereas there are an estimated 100,000 species of living mollusks, many of great economic, ecological, and cultural importance to humans and whereas habitat de¬ struction and commercial fisheries have had serious effects on mollusk populations worldwide, and whereas modem conchology continues the tradition of amateur naturalists exploring and documenting the natural world, be it resolved that the Conchologists of America endorses respon¬ sible scientific collecting as a means of monitoring the status of mollusk species and populations and promoting informed decision making in regulatory processes intended to safeguard mollusks and their habitats.

Baldinger 2 Fig. 1. A sinistral sacred chank shell, Turbinella pyrum (left) and the more common dextral form (right), both from the Joseph George Claud-Mantle collection donated to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, June 24, 2011. Scale in mm. Thrilling can be defined as producing a sudden, strong, deep emotion or excitement, often producing trembling or quivering. Discovery is quite simply finding something. These were definitely some of the feelings I, Ed Nieburger, experienced on the night of January 3, 2012, when I was attending the meeting of the Boston Malacological Club, which has met for over a half-century on the first Tuesday of the month in the Museum Lecture Room at the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The program for this particular night included a presentation titled, “The Mollusk Department: Past and Future” and a guided tour of the Mollusk Department by Curatorial Associate, Adam Baldinger. Following Adam’s talk, club members were allowed to look through some of the thousands of drawers of shells. As the bewitching hour of ten o’clock neared, Adam said: “Time to close the cabinets and head back to the elevator.” I had spent my time looking through some of the drawers containing shells from a collection I recently appraised online. I was just picking up one last shell. It was about the third or fourth shell that I touched, in a collection of thousands. I was feeling quite light-headed as I asked my friend Dan Teven, standing to my right, to verify if one particular shell opened on the left or on the right. Dan said: “left.” So, we both knew the significance of the find, the ultimate rare and valuable seashell, a sinistral sacred chank shell [ Turbinella pyrum (Linnaeus, 1758)] (Fig. 1). I never thought I would see one in person. I certainly never thought I would hold one in my hand. And to be the first in eighty years to hold such a treasure, and then to realize that it was a treasure, made me delirious. Shock, excitement, and embarrassment overwhelmed me as the Club members headed for the elevator. Embarrassment because I had just evaluated this huge collection for the family and heirs of the collector and had completely missed seeing the left- handed specimen of what is “always” right handed. How could I have missed it? This will certainly go down as the classic “missed identification” of conchological history. My name, Edward Nieburger, will remain forever as the person who missed such an identification! This shell was part of the Joseph George Claud-Mantle collection that was donated to the MCZ on June 24, 2011. With 5,200 shells, and with almost 4,000 species, the collection does contain rarities, including this most valuable of all shells, a sinistral sacred chank shell of India. Born in Calcutta, India, in 1858, Joseph George Claud-Mantle located to London as a young boy. His education is unknown. He went to sea as a young man and made Chief Engineer at the age of twenty-six. He arrived in America in 1882, married in 1887, and was widowed in 1907. They had three sons (one died in infancy), three daughters (one died at age eight), seven grandchildren, and fifteen great-grandchildren. Joseph George Claud-Mantle (Fig. 2) lived in New York City and assembled this large shell collection between 1880 and 1930. The shell cabinet (Fig. 3) was a remarkable built-in arrangement, with what appears to contain an equally valuable shell-book library that was located at 111 Ames Avenue in Leonia, New Jersey. Joseph George Claud-Mantle died in 1934 in Trumbull, Connecticut. He also collected rocks and minerals. Most of his shells were purchased from Hugh C. Fulton, the famous shell-dealer of London, England. Few, if any specimens, appear to be self- collected, with the possible exception of some from Long Island Sound, New York. Claud-Mantle’s grandson, George Ferrera (Fig. 4) of Trumbull, Connecticut, remembers his grandfather Joseph as a March 2012 American Conchologist Page 5 Fig. 2. Joseph George Claud-Mantle, circa 1888 (photo courtesy of Cindy Arendt). “genteel man.” Ferrera said in The Hartford Courant newspaper interview (Adinolfi, 2011), “An accomplished engineer, esteemed by his neighbors, he always carried an umbrella and looked dandy in a black jacket and tie. ‘All my neighbors would remark about how he was a great man, a real gentleman,’ He was also an enigma who, according to family legend, was the son of a British officer and an Indian woman who died of cholera while aboard a ship bound for England. He worked as an engineer, manufacturer, and inventor. He registered at least one engineering device with the United States Patent Office. He eventually founded a successful engineering firm, Mantle and Company, Park Avenue, New York City, before retiring in 1916 and moving to Leonia, a wealthy hamlet in Bergen County...” northern New Jersey. He was a member of numerous scientific organizations and museums. “After retiring, Claud-Mantle immersed himself in hobbies, particularly in his collection of shells.” He enjoyed eighteen years of retirement with his growing collections. Over the years, Ferrera offered the collection to several museums, including The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, “but none would accept it without an accompanying donation to catalog and maintain it.” In early 2008, his daughter Laura Ferrera of Norwalk, Connecticut, and her two cousins, Deborah Lasnier of Canton, Connecticut, and Cindy Arendt of Oxford, Connecticut, resolved to accomplish George’s dream. They documented the collection, taking inventory using their great¬ grandfather’s original logbooks, and then created an electronic database and online photo gallery of the shells (Figs. 5, 6, & 7). Also from The Hartford Courant newspaper article Fig. 3. (Above) Joseph George Claud-Mantle shell cabinet and library (photo courtesy of Cindy Arendt). Fig. 4. (Below) George Ferrera and Deborah Lasnier holding a drawer of Claud-Mantle specimens on June 24,2011 - transfer day of the collection to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. (Adinolfi, 2011), Adam Baldinger said “It isn’t unusual to receive collections from private collectors, but I have rarely seen a collection that was so diligently catalogued. The collection’s true value is scientific, and lies in the precise way Claud-Mantle recorded data about each of his shells. The technique that he used is a technique that was commonly used by early natural-history museums. They kept a ledger and recorded the appropriate data for the specific specimens. Small strips of paper are affixed to each of Claud-Mantle’s shells, listing its name and a number that corresponds with the logbook entry where he recorded information such as the shell’s origin and when it was purchased. I’m very interested in this collection because of the data and the careful work of the family, and particularly the great-grandfather, that was put into the collection. Claud-Mantle probably corresponded with professional scientists and collectors from around the world, who taught him how to preserve and record his shells. It will take several months to catalogue and study the collection. Until then, we cannot determine which shells have the most scientific value.” In the meantime, family members can view their ancestor’s full collection, online in images posted on their private website.

(right) The drawer (left) in its original condition as Ed first saw it with the sacred chank shell, aperture down, and (right) after the cousins cleaned the drawer and shells (photos courtesy of Cindy Arendt). Joseph George Claud-Mantle was connected to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City while he lived there. After he died in 1934, the 120 cabinet drawers of shells were carefully removed by family members and stored, without the cabinets, then moved about the Northeast five more times, in New Jersey, to Vermont, then Connecticut. Then in early 2008, Deborah, Cindy, and Laura took on the project of cleaning and photographing the collection (Figs. 5, 6, & 7). This project took almost four years. Eighty years had taken only a small toll on the arrangement of shells, and the shells cleaned up well for the transfer to the MCZ (Figs. 4 & 8). My appraisal was based on viewing the photographed shells online. These cousins spent infinite hours photographing the drawers and most of the shells, individually, but not the chank shell. Their extensive and exhaustive time involved has to be considered a labor of love. For eighty years this sacred chank shell avoided re¬ discovery, sitting in a drawer with many much more attractive shell specimens. The cousins were right when they speculated that there was a really rare “sleeper” shell in the collection, and it would be a “plain Jane.” The shells were now sitting in MCZ drawers (Fig. 9) during that first week of January 2012, eighty-five years after Joseph George Claud-Mantle had bought the sacred chank from Hugh C. Fulton, in 1927, for five pounds sterling, just waiting to be re-discovered. It took just overnight for Adam and me to start checking. Adam double-checked that the specimen was indeed part of the Claud-Mantle collection, and it did appear in one of the thousands of photographs of the collection that I had used during the online valuation of the collection for the family. It was “hiding,” aperture down in a drawer (Figs. 5 & 6) with other stellar shells, including two Austrotrophon catalinensis (Oldroyd, 1927), shells that had distracted me from recognizing this “ultimate” valuable shell. A similar sinistral sacred chank shell is wonderfully documented in American Conchologist (June, 2011), in Harry Lee’s detailed article about his own specimen, which is destined for the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Dr. Lee estimated that there are several hundred such specimens in Asia today. The sinistral, or left- handed, chank is revered as a religious object in Hindu temples, as the place where Vishnu, the god of the sea, had hidden sacred scrolls (Rose, 1974, 2011). Dr. Lee estimated that there are probably just three specimens of the sinistral sacred chank shell in North America. Rice (2011) then wrote an article that appeared in the same June 2011 issue of American Conchologist answering the question: “What shell is the most valuable?” Coincidentally, his conclusion was that the sacred chank shell was the most valuable, not just for its rarity in nature, but also because of its value as a religious object. The sacred chank shell comes from shallow water, off India. The shell coils dextrally, or is “right-handed,” almost always. A great rarity is one that coils sinistrally, or is “left- handed,” opening on the left with the spire pointed up. Only one in six hundred-thousand coils sinistrally (Lee, 2011)! It was in Rice’s (2011) article that the sinistral specimen was valued at $45,000. The normally right-handed specimens sell for under $10. The five pounds sterling that Claud-Mantle paid for his sinistral specimen was a lot of money in the 1920s, but what Joseph George Claud-Mantle paid for the chank can be compared to what he paid for a glory of the seas cone, Conus gloriamaris Chemnitz, 1777, also in that same time period: eighty pounds sterling, also bought from Hugh C. Fulton, of London. The family and heirs of Joseph George Claud-Mantle are very excited with this newest discovery. They are thrilled that their great-grandfather’s shells are safe and being appreciated by others. As fate would have it, this newly re-discovered specimen stimulated Adam to review the literature and the department’s database and he notified me of yet another sacred chank shell in the collections (Fig. 10). This one came from the Duchess of Portland collection from the 1700s. This older specimen is a bit smaller than the Claud-Mantle specimen, but how remarkable is it to have two such specimens in the same place? Harry Lee was very insightful in stating that there are “three specimens in North America” (Lee, 2011). It appears that there are no others known either in private collections or in museums in North America. March 2012 American Conchologist Page 7 Fig. 7. Some of the original drawers containing Claud-Mantle specimens that total over 5,200 shells and almost 4,000 species (photos courtesy of Cindy Arendt). Page 8 Vol. 40, No. 1 Fig. 8. Specimen drawers neatly wrapped and stored in preparation for transferring the Claud-Mantle collection to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. The Duchess of Portland collection provided the first sinistral sacred chank shell specimen that came to the MCZ (Johnson, 1999). The Duchess Dowager of Portland, Margaret Cavendish Bentinck (1714 - 1785), was a member of the British elite. She made friends with “Dr. David Solander and Sir Joseph Banks, who would soon accompany Captain James Cook on his first voyage of discovery to the South Seas (1768 - 1771)” (Johnson, 1999). Many rare shells found their way from that voyage into the Duchess’s cabinet. “Ayear after the Duchess’s death, in 1786, a sale catalog of her shells was made up by her chaplain and librarian, Rev. John Lightfoot. Lightfoot, a botanist and conchologist himself, printed over twelve hundred copies of The Portland Catalogue , which would eventually be recognized as a legitimate descriptor of new species, with Lightfoot as their author. The Portland Catalogue claimed that the Duchess of Portland collection was the finest in Europe.” (Johnson, 1999) It probably was. The sale took thirty-eight days to complete. On its final day, Lot 4023, the Duchess’s sacred chank shell “a very fine reversed Voluta ponderosa , S. (Solander ms - as in label only) or Heavy Volute, extremely scarce , from the East-Indies. A direct (dextral) one is figured in Favanne, pi. 35, fig. 1” (Johnson, 1999) was sold. Lot 4023 eventually came to Boston, but not before being in multiple important European collections between 1786 and 1938. It is most interesting that this “Portland chank” came from England to America through the hands of the same London shell dealer, Hugh C. Fulton, who had handled the Claud-Mantle chank shell. They came eleven years apart. The Duchess’s shell came in about, or soon after, 1938. “The Duchess’s Portland chank arrived to the collection of Gretchen Osgood Warren, a wealthy Brahmin, at 8 Mount Vernon Place, Beacon Hill, Boston,” (Johnson, 1999) a very aristocratic address. From her daughter, Rachel, the shell was given to the Boston Museum of Science, and then in 1962 most of the museum’s collection was transferred to the MCZ (Johnson, 2004). The Duchess’s shell came to America at almost the same time that Harry Lee’s specimen arrived. Presently the Claud-Mantle sacred chank shell has less provenance. Claud-Mantle was living in Leonia, New Jersey, in 1927 and must have been putting the finishing touches on his collection. The three cousins still have a file of correspondences Fig. 9. The Claud-Mantle collection safely housed within specimen cabinetry within the Department of Malacology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. between Joseph George Claud-Mantle and Hugh C. Fulton. Perhaps the details and history of the sacred chank shell in Claud- Mantle’s collection will emerge, maybe even its locality data and earlier chain of ownership. Could it be that this sacred chank came from a famous European collection? The Claud-Mantle collection (Fig. 11) also contained two golden cowries, Lyncina aurantium (Gmelin, 1791); one Barycypraea fultoni (Sowerby III, 1903), for which he paid twenty pounds sterling; Bernaya teulerei (Cazenavette, 1846) from Aden, Arabian Sea, for which he paid eighty pounds; two Erronea nymphae (Jay, 1850) from Mauritius; a rhododendron cone, Conus adamsonii Broderip, 1836; a Conus timorensis Hwass in Bruguiere, 1792; a noble cone, Conus nobilis nobilis Linnaeus, 1758; a Cymbiola (Cymbiolacca) thatcheri (McCoy, 1868); two Austrotrophon catalinensis (Oldroyd, 1927) from California; a Lyria ( Harpeola ) anna (Lesson, 1835) from Mauritius; a Carinaria cristata (Linnaeus, 1767) from the Moluccas, a tiny shell that looks like a glass ice-cream cone; a violet spider conch, Lambis violacea (Swainson, 1821); Cymbiola (Cymbiola) cymbiola (Gmelin, 1791); a ribbed harp, Harpa costata (Linnaeus, 1758); and freshwater snails such as Io fluvialis (Say, 1825) from Tennessee and an elaborately ornamented snail Tiphobia horei E.A. Smith, 1880, from Lake Tanganyika. Claud-Mantle even had a drawer of pteropods, pelagic or free-swimming mollusks from mid-ocean. The Joseph George Claud-Mantle collection is a wonderful historical record of what an outstanding collection of its time looked like. The species selection is remarkable, even though (and perhaps because) there are almost no self-collected shells! Each genus has complete runs of the available species of the time. It must have been one of just a handful of such collections March 2012 American Conchologist Page 9 Fig. 10.

Scale in mm. world-wide a century ago. Since Hugh C. Fulton was the premier dealer of the day, and we believe that Claud-Mantle was probably his prime customer at the time, this collection is likely the star collection of its era. It is remarkable that his heirs preserved this collection. I am certain that Joseph George Claud-Mantle would be very proud to have his collection appreciated by descendants he never got to know. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to experience such a thrilling discovery.

Lee Fig. 1 The original display with the shells glued to the top of the box and the labels attached inside. The label under the shell provides the name and locality while the additional label(s) inside the box expand the information. The Acquisition Phase; the “Adanson Family Collection” The peripatetic Alain Allary, noted French shell-dealer and frequent participant in COA Convention bourses, and I go back quite some time. I recall getting some very interesting, both biologically and historically, shells from him as far back as the Panama City (1993) event, but our conversations and transactions have unfortunately been relatively few and far-between. Consequently I was pleasantly surprised at the recent Port Canaveral bourse when he showed me a sizable sample of curatorially time-worn tropical land snails. Alain informed me that they were from a collection belonging to the extended family of pioneer malacologist Michel Adanson. He went on to say the shells began to accumulate in the Eighteenth Century and increased in number through the efforts of certain members of later generations. Fascinated as much by the fame and antiquity of the material as my need to know more about Partula snails, obviously the dominant group in the assortment, I happily purchased the entirety of his offering. The state of conservation of this little collection certainly warrants more than passing comment. Firstly, Alain found this material in a somewhat less well-curated condition than I did. He had labored to place what seemed to be all the constituents of each lot in a Ziploc®-style plastic bag. I found one to eight specimens constituting each lot. The shells were, or had been, glued to the outside of the bottom of mostly uniform cardboard trays (75X60X10 mm); a neatly handwritten, uniformly-formatted, label with the scientific name, author, and a brief indication of the locality was glued next to them. On the inside of the tray were glued one to three labels with less disciplined handwriting - often clearly that of more than a singular scribe, and usually containing more information as to provenance [Fig. 1], The vagaries of time and neglect were quite apparent, and no shell or label escaped them. Dust, detachment of shells and labels from the glue, insect and rodent depredations on the labels, foxing of all the trays and labels, and (rarely) a missing label or shell had to be dealt with. Then there came the task of freeing the majority of labels and specimens from their holdfasts. Actually the process of rehabilitation went well, but it was quite tedious and time-consuming, lasting several days. An added dimension of complexity in the (re)curation effort was the inaccuracy of some labels (over 20% misidentifications, sometimes wanton, as well as incorrect locality, e.g., the extensive use of the designation “lies Sandwich,” then exclusively applied to the Hawaiian Islands, an ipso facto inaccuracy. All this notwithstanding, the results were gratifying. The shells for the most part had escaped permanent damage from Byne’s Disease and other threats, loose specimens and labels matched up eventually, and ultimately the labels were almost all decipherable [Figs. 2, 3], I had before me a total of 183 specimens in 58 lots, all seeming of a single vintage, the mid-Nineteenth Century. Of the total, 175 specimens in 54 lots are partulids. Of these partulids, 166 specimens in 52 lots were collected in French Polynesia and are comprised of 31 species [Plate 2] Most of the remaining 21 lots are taxa subordinate to the 31 species, and a few are duplicate lots. The other partulid material, two lots, two species, originated in Micronesia (Guam and Ponape). The remainder, eight non-partulid specimens comprising four lots, are phylogenetically and zoogeographically diverse land snails ( Macroceramus, Cerastoides, Orobaphana, Tropidophora ). This acquisition and the process of its (re)curation taught me more than I ever expected to learn about Partula and Partulidae. Taxonomy and other aspects of the natural history of the Partulidae The family Partulidae Pilsbry, 1900, is deployed throughout the high islands of south and western Oceania as well as New Guinea. Its metropolis is in French Polynesia, particularly the Society Islands. Here the nominotypical subgenus of Partula Ferussac, 1819, is limited to the Society and Hervey Is. (Pilsbry, 1909). It has more than 76 species, with several subspecies in addition (Brewer, Czekanski-Moir, and Rundell, 2007). Most P. March 2012 American Conchologist Page 11 Fig. 2 (above) and Fig. 3 (below) show details of the original display and labels as well as the authors new labels. The shells are obviously in excellent condition. Fig. 4 William Harper Pease (1824-1871) who, along with Andrew Garrett (1823-1887), spent numerous years exploring and collectiong in the tropical Pacific. In all, Pease named 31 partulids while Garret named 11. (Partula ) species are limited to a single island even though several inter-island distances are rather small (Pilsbry, 1909). Although predominantly arboreal, there are several terrestrial species (Pilsbry, 1909). Among the four genera (eleven subgenera) in the family (Schileyko, 1999), many taxa in this subgenus distinguish themselves with a variety of color patterns, more conspicuous in the tree-dwelling species. Most islands have more than a single species and ecological as well as geographical forces seem to have driven their evolution. The steep terrain isolates many deep valleys, in which the snails prosper. Besides allowing divergence of species, such topographic barriers have allowed infraspecific variation (forms and subspecies) to evolve within taxa distributed over relatively wide areas with varying landscape. Examples of this include P. (P.) otaheitana (Bruguiere, 1792) [Plate 2, figs. 22- 27] on Tahiti and P. (P.) rosea [Plate 2, figs. 31-32] on Huahine. The type, and first-named, species of Partula is [Limax] faba Martyn, 1784 (2: pi. 67), described from shells brought home to England under the command of Captain James Cook (1728- 1779), who visited Raiatea, Society Is., aboard HMS Endeavour in July 1769 on the first of his three voyages. Because the Universal Conchologist of Thomas Martyn (1735-1825) (see Dali, 1906, 1908) was not a consistently binominal work, the International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature exercised its plenary powers (ICZN, 1957) to declare most of its names unavailable for the purposes of taxonomic nomenclature.* Fortunately Gmelin (1791: 3623) had already validated the name, as Helix faba [Plate 1; Plate 2, fig. 10], which, albeit mislocalized in Tahiti, nonetheless limited nomenclatorial confusion. By the next year, Cook material somehow reached the French malacologist Jean Guillaume Bruguiere (1749-1798), who named Bulinus otaheitanus, which he believed to be an inhabitant of fresh waters. * Nine well-known New Zealand marine gastropod species, also the product of Cooks explorations, were spared suppression by the ICZN: (1) [Patella] denticulata, now Cellana denticulata (Martyn, 1784) [Patellidae]; (2) [Trochus] granosus, now Turbo (Modelia) granosus (Martyn, 1784) [Turbinidae]; (3) Trochus heliotropium, now Astraea heliotropium (Martyn, 1784) (Turbinidae]; (3 ) Buccinfum] linea, now Buccinulum linea linea (Martyn, 1784) [Buccinidae]; (5) Buccin[um] maculosum, now Cominella maculosa (Martyn, 1784) [Buccinidae]; (6) [Limax] opalus, now Cantharidus opalus opalus (Martyn, 1784) [Trochidae]; (7) Buccin[um] papulosum, now Struthiolaria (Struthiolaria) papulosa (Martyn, 1784) [Struthiolariidae]; (8) [Trochus] punctulatus, now Maurea punctulata (Martyn, 1784) [Calliostomatidae]; and (9) Buccin[um] vermis ; now Struthiolaria (Pelicaria) vermis (Martyn, 1784) [Struthiolariidae]. Page 12 Vol. 40, No. 1 Fig. 5 (left to right) compares (1) Samoana attenuata ; (2) a mirror-image of the no. 3 shell, a possible hybrid; (3) the shell found with a group of Partula otaheitana that is obviously not that species; and a typical P. otaheitana lot-mate of the no. 3 shell. I’ll let the reader decide if this constitutes a reasonable case for hybridization. The next century saw more intensive exploration of Oceania by the leading seafaring nations. Dr. Rene Primevere Lesson (1794-1849), having served as naturalist aboard the French Corvette La Coquille ** returned in March 1825 from its three- year-long circumnavigation. He accumulated a rich booty of novel natural history objects including Birds-of-Paradise and an ample helping of Partula species collected in Tahiti, Bora Bora, the Carolines, and New Guinea. He described a handful of the latter years later (Lesson, 1831). Partula were also among the myriad treasures brought home by pioneering conchologist Hugh Cuming (1791-1865). Known to many as “The Prince of Shell Collectors” (Dance, 1986), he, in the tradition of countryman Cook, visited French Polynesia in 1827-1828 on the first of his three voyages of exploration in the Pacific. Cuming’s Partula species were named by Englishmen William John Broderip and Lovell Reeve as well as Ludwig (Louis) Pfeiffer in Germany. Plate 1 features figures of Partula appearing in three of the six aforementioned authors’ works. Three decades would pass before the Society Islands became the scene of the great epiphany in Partula discovery and understanding. This enlightenment wasn’t wrought by the French or English but through the labors of Andrew Garrett (1823- 1887) and William Harper Pease (1824-1871) [Fig. 4; note the “cadaverous” countenance (Thomas, 1954)], expatriate Americans who spent most of their lives on tropical Pacific Islands. These halcyon years of discovery, and dissemination of knowledge of Partula , seem to have been coeval with the collection Alain provided. Pease and Garrett were friends and worked closely together from 1857 until 1863, when Garrett left Hawaii for the final time. From then until Pease’s death in 1871, they maintained an extensive correspondence. Although of two different dispositions and backgrounds, their collaboration was quite fruitful. Garrett was the intrepid traveler, collector, and (well) self-taught field naturalist; Pease, although not neglectful of fieldwork, was more Fig. 6 Michel Adanson (1727-1806) produced the Histoire na- turelle du Senegal in 1757 (see Fig 7). Published a year before the Tenth Edition of the Systema Naturae (Linnaeus, 1758), it is not considered available for nomenclatorial purposes (ex¬ cluded by Article 3.1 of the Code (ICZN, 1999), but is still of import for its contribution to malacology. Adanson is the be¬ ginning of the paper trail of these shells. the armchair collector, articulate writer, tutor, and sometimes sponsor (Thomas, 1979; Kay, 1975; Johnson, 2002). Garrett visited the Society Islands briefly in 1856-1857, and he returned there in 1860 for a more extensive stay. Commenting on the work of his scientific predecessors (notably Cook and crew, Lesson, and Cuming), he wrote: “During the years 1860-1863 I made a much more thorough exploration than any of my predecessors, and, by searching in nearly every valley of the group, discovered 50 new species...” (Thomas, 1979). In 1863 Garrett returned to Hawaii and shortly quit those islands for the Central Pacific, where he spent the next seven years traveling to the islands of Tuamotus, Marquesas, Samoa, and Fiji groups. All the while he sent shells to Pease, who named them promptly. Although usually published, many such nomina, noticeably among the Partula , existed in manuscript only (Clench, 1975; Crosse and Fischer, 1873). Shells bearing such names, e.g., Partula radiata “Pse.” [Fig. 3], were ** Within a year of her return to France, La Coquille was refit, re-christened l’Astrolabe, and launched on another three-year circumnavigation of geographic and scientific exploration (1826-1829). Jean Rene Constant Quoy (1790 - 1869) and Joseph Paul Gaimard (1796-1858) succeeded Dr. Lesson in the role of expedition naturalists. Their report on the Mollusca (Quoy and Gaimard, 1832-1835) contained a great many new species, including two Melanesian partulids, and some of the finest illustrations ever drawn (Dance, 1986).

During his final 17 years, which he spent on Huahine, and only after Pease’s demise, did Garrett produce significant scientific papers. Although mostly short communications describing new marine shells, one was a sentinel work indeed, the pages of which often contain extensive descriptions of the ecology, habits, and zoogeography of virtually all the Partula known from the Society Islands (Garrett, 1884). Alongside the over 10,000 specimens, not among the great many lost in two devastating shipwrecks, successfully reaching his many correspondents, e.g., Pease and Newcomb in HI, Hartman in NH (Smith, 1901), Anthony in Cincinnati, L. Agassiz at Harvard, and Godeffroy in Hamburg, and his extensive collection of 8,000 species and 30,000 specimens (Spoehr, 1963), now at the Bishop Museum, Honolulu (Clench, 1979; Johnson, 1994), this contribution stands as his most treasured legacy to malacology, evolutionary genetics, and terrestrial ecology. Fortunately for taxonomists, he also synonymized or validated [as demonstrated in Fig. 3] all of his mentor’s extensively-circulated manuscript Partula nomina. In all, Pease named 31 valid partulid species- level taxa, the lion’s share from the Society Islands, and virtually all supplied by Garrett, who added eleven of his own, nine of which were based on Pease manuscript names. That his contributions were not limited to malacology is perhaps most notably exemplified by a work based on some 470 of his high quality paintings of the fishes of Oceania (Gunther, 1873, 1873-5, 1909 fide Spoehr, 1963: 101 ). Variability and genetics in Partula Reference to Plate 2: figs. 31,32 and to Figs. 2 and 3 will give the reader a hint of the variation in color and pattern expressed in about half the species of Partula (Partula). These characters vary within as well as between colonies. Other plastic characters include shell-size and direction of coil (mutation to sinistrality). I make no secret of being fascinated by the latter phenomenon and admit the passion fed my impulse to get involved with the “Adanson Family Collection” in the first place. All told, there are about a half dozen exclusively sinistral and about that number of enantiomorphic (relatively frequent occurrences of both left- and right-coiling shells) species in Partula (Crampton, 1916, 1932). In the Partulidae, reversal of coil is seen in only two other instances: within certain colonies of Marianella gibba (Ferussac, 1821) in the Marianas (dextral specimens were in the purchased assortment), and characteristically in the small, obscure genus Draparnaudia Montrouzier, 1859, centered in New Caledonia. With easy access to large numbers of the protean snails, it’s not surprising that geneticists enthusiastically (and successfully) adapted Partula snails to their labs. Indeed, in the tradition of Gregor Mendel’s iconic pea plant, a century of research on the inheritance of these traits has earned Partula poster-child status of “model organism.” All the aforementioned characters are for the most part genetically determined and generations of laboratory and field workers (not to mention dozens of generations of snails) have devoted valuable time and energy to the elucidation of these processes (e.g., Crampton, 1916, 1924, 1932; Murray and Clarke, 1968, 1976a, 1976b). Hybridization in Partula With relatively penetrable ecological and geographic boundaries between species of Partula cohabiting an island in the Society group, it comes as no surprise that inter-species hybrids occasionally crop up under certain conditions. Garrett (1884) recorded such cross-breeding not uncommonly between Partula elongata and P. taeniata, P. garretti and P. thalia, P. faba and P. virginea, P. faba and P. radiata (arboreal and terrestrial respectively), P. faba and P. fusca, P. fusca and P. navigatoria , as well as the latter and P. faba [the parent species are figured on Plate 2], All these hybrids were observed on Moorea or Raiatea; Garrett made a point of reporting that none was seen on Tahiti or Huahine. Among the shells obtained, one specimen in a suite of seven sinistral Partula otaheitana , a Tahiti endemic, has a very different look to it - more elongate and gracile, with a narrower aperture, more flared labrum, straighter columella with a longer fold at its apical aspect, and a more extensive parietal reflection than its lot-mates. These characters all tend toward Samoana attenuata , with which it occurs on Tahiti. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of four shells, L to R: S. attenuata ; an artificial mirror- image of the shell under discussion; the shell under discussion; and a typical P. otaheitana lot-mate of it. I’ll let the reader decide if this constitutes a reasonable case for hybridization. S. attenuata lives high in the canopy, and P. otaheitana , while arboreal, is found much closer to the ground (Garrett, 1884). It appears that their isolation is more ecological than geographic, but what of the remote taxonomic relationship between the two putative parents? Based on the “genetic distance” between the two taxa, partulid expert Dr. Diarmaid 6 Foighil (personal communication 13 December 2011; Lee et al., 2009) is skeptical of my hypothesis. Such discord typifies the chinks in our knowledge of this wondrous group of snails. Page 14 Vol. 40, No. 1 Fig. 8 Le Chateau de Balaine (sometimes rendered Baleine ), home to the Adanson family, was completed in 1850 and now serves as an upscale country inn within a 20-hectare botanical garden in France. Man meddles with nature; Paradise Lost? Readers are likely familiar with the far-flung introductions of the giant African snail, Lissachatina fulica (Bowditch, 1822), and the fragile nature of oceanic island ecosystems. The Society Islands fell prey to the invasion in the Twentieth Century and the adverse impact, most noticeably to agriculture, led to the deliberate introduction of the carnivorous rosy wolfsnail, Euglandina rosea (Ferussac, 1821), on Tahiti in 1974, Moorea in 1977, and on other Society Islands in the 1980s and 1990s (Coote, 2007). While having little impact on the target giant African snail, this nonselective predator produced mass extirpations of partulids and the rapid extinction (in the wild) of the large majority of the 61 described endemic Society Islands partulid tree snails (4 Samoana and 57 Partula species). The impact is best documented on the island of Moorea (Clarke et al., 1984; Murray et al., 1988), where, within a decade of the arrival of Euglandina , all the once abundant partulids, 7 Partula and 2 Samoana species, were deemed extirpated (Murray et al., 1988; Lee et al., 2009). There is some room for optimism, however: (1) Intensive on-going field surveys have detected scattered relict populations, seven (of the original nine) on Moorea, and several on a number of other islands (Lee et al., 2009; J. Slapcinsky, personal communication September 2011). (2) Perhaps in anticipation of the calamity, and certainly abetted by of the interest of laboratory geneticists as noted above, a number of Society Island partulids have been captively bred for decades (Coote and Loeve, 2003). Attempts at reintroduction have thus far been unsuccessful, but the possibility looms on the horizon (6 Foighil, 2009). Despite the carelessness of humanity, perhaps partulids will someday reach the level of prosperity to which Andrew Garrett and others bore historic witness. The Adanson Dynasty; their scientific activities and the “Adanson Family Collection” The primogenitor and most famous member of a noble succession of naturalists, collectors, and horticulturalists was Fig. 9 Partula data labels showing that Major Emile Doumet received these shells from J. Rothschild, Editeur du Libraire de la Societe Botanique de France, Paris, in 1862. The Roths¬ child source was indicated on most of the labels. Michel Adanson (1727-1806) [Fig. 6], From 1749 tol753 “Le Savant,” as he came to be known, endured the rigors of life in Senegal, then a French colony. His charge was to observe, and gather specimens of, the biota of this wild tropical west African region. Adanson’s intention was to publish several accounts of all elements of the flora and fauna that came under his notice (Dance, 1986), but only one major iconography [Fig. 7] was produced. Fortunately for malacology, it dealt exclusively with the mollusks (Adanson, 1757). Besides being a lavishly illustrated and logically- organized iconography greatly superior to anything of its ilk that appeared earlier, it contained a novel system of classification based on the animals’ soft anatomy. Adanson also employed a system of nearly consistent binominal nomenclature using Latin and Senegalese epithets. Readers may note that the date of publication (1757) anticipated that of the Tenth Edition of the Systerna Naturae (Linnaeus, 1758) by one year. Apparently there was considerable debate about the acceptance of Adanson’s names, the French School retaining them for some decades. Nonetheless, this work precedes the (admittedly arbitrary) beginning of zoological nomenclature (ICZN Art. 3.1), so Adanson’s names are not available, except as validated by later authors. The mild controversy notwithstanding, Adanson’s taxonomic system was a sentinel contribution to malacology, and posterity has exalted him into the pantheon of malacological Masters. In ca. 1760 Adanson gave what was thought to be his most important shells to King Louis XV along with plants and other natural history objects collected in Senegal in return for a life annuity. It appears that the politics of the First Republic interfered with delivery of this largesse inasmuch as Michel Adanson spent March 2012 American Conchologist Page 15 Plate 1.

Adanson website, 2011). It also appears this royal shell collection has been lost (Lamy, 1929). Once again fortunately for malacology, Adanson (and his heirs) actually retained the most important of the Senegal shells, including virtually all those figured in his magnum opus. These specimens were discovered in 1939 and given by Adanson’s great-great-great grandson, Hugues Marie Auguste Michel de Rocquigny-Adanson (see below), to the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle (MNHN), Paris (Fischer-Piette et al., 1942). Also included in the donation was material gathered by Michel in various parts of France and from the West Indies, likely brought to him in Senegal by slavers. Likely his brother, Jean-Baptiste Adanson (1732-1804), a professional interpreter to royalty and amateur archaeologist living for a half century in Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia, accounted for the portion of material collected on those shores (Lamy, 1929; Fischer-Piette, 1942). Here follows a climb down the Adanson family tree with attention to family members sharing their antecedents’ taste and talent for natural science, especially malacology. Michel Adanson was: Father of Aglae-Catherine Adanson Doumet (1775-1852), his only daughter, who in 1804 began creation of an arboretum in an area with optimal climate, soil, and terrain in the countryside 18 km from Moulins, in the Departement of Allier. In 1812, at age 30, and in the wake of a divorce, she retired to the premises and began construction of a grand residence, Le Chateau de Balaine (sometimes rendered Baleine), completed in 1850, but with some elements said to date to the Fourteenth Century. The edifice is now an elegant country inn [Fig. 8], The arboretum, perhaps better termed a botanical park, presently covers 20 hectares and is the largest privately-owned botanical garden in France. Continuously maintained for over 200 years, it contains 2,500 varieties of plants, including many installed by Aglae herself. Glowing testimonials to its excellence (e.g., Anon., 1902) are many and continue to the present. Uncle to an as yet anonymous man whom J.C.H. Crosse (1826- 1898) credited with sparking his interest in shells when the latter was fifteen years of age (Poyard, 1899). All efforts by me and my referee, Dr. D. Callen, failed to clarify this genealogical connection. Grandfather of Paul-Anacharsis Doumet (1801-1880), brother of Emile, horticulturist and botanist who directed the Arboretum at Balaine created by his mother, Aglae. Grandfather of Major Emile Doumet (1796-1869), son of Aglae and an accomplished conchologist and prodigious general collector, he lived and collected in Cette (rendered “Sete” after 1827), in the south of France, for much of his life and eventually accumulated collections of “all sorts” over a span of “sixty years” (Crosse and Fischer, 1870; Lamy, 1929: 316). After his death, his son, Paul-Napoleon Doumet-Adanson, created “Le Musee” on the grounds of the Chateau de Balaine in 1879-1880 (Lamy, 1929: 316; Fischer-Piette etal., 1942: 109-113; Anon., 1902). The Musee was an extensive and eclectic museum containing fine and spectacular paintings, statuary, porcelains, archaeological and ethnological artifacts, Napoleon Bonaparte memorabilia, and other compelling pieces among some 200,000 objects in all, mostly accumulated by the Major (Anon., 1902). This Partula assortment I received from Alain was certainly assembled by Major Emile Doumet. It was part of a shell collection once containing over 100,000 specimens of 10,000 species already suffering from curatorial neglect a century ago (Anon., 1902). The Major almost certainly assembled this Partula collection in great part through purchase from, and/or exchange with, contemporaries A.C. Bernardi (d. 1863; Crosse and Fischer, 1864) and J. Rothschild, Editeur du Libraire de la Societe Botanique de France, Paris [see Fig. 9], the latter source being indicated on most of the labels [see Figs. 1, 2, 3], These collectors apparently provided material to Emile in July 1856, Sept. 1862, and August 1864. During those times, opportunities for travel to Partula country were limited for a variety of reasons, there were very few field collectors, and none is thus identified on Emile’s labels. Some of the Cook, Cuming, and Lesson material was probably still circulating, but clearly much newer material was flowing into the collection. Andrew Garrett hadn’t seen Tahiti until several months after the first date, but he was well-traveled in the Society Islands and certainly sent much material to Pease by the two later dates. Since Pease had extensive correspondence with European Page 16 Vol. 40, No. 1 collectors (Clench, 1979), it seems the two Americans were the first links in the chain of ownership and that the bulk of material Emile was receiving had been “freshly-picked.” In further support of this scenario are the several attributions of unpublished names to Pease years before validation (Garrett, 1884) [see Fig. 3], As for the two lots accompanying the July 1856/Bernardi provenance, if Pease wasn’t involved, perhaps they had a much earlier origin. Great grandfather of Paul-Napoleon Doumet-Adanson (1834- 1897) , who added to, and cared for, the collections of his father, Emile. Apparently unsuccessful at convincing the municipalities of Sete and Moulins to adopt these extensive holdings, he moved them from Sete and installed them at Balaine. At his death he left (to his family, it seems) a fine shell collection and library (Crosse, 1898) . I found no evidence of any later member of the Adanson dynasty showing a particular interest in shells. Father of Marie. Great-great grandfather of Marie Cecile Louise Doumet-Adanson (1863-1892).

In 1939, he played host to MNHN malacologist Edouard Fischer-Piette at Chateau de Balaine. At that time Fischer-Piette discovered Michel Adanson’s Senegal collection. Hugues released this valuable material to the Paris Museum shortly afterward (see above). At the time Hugues was placed among the accomplished naturalists descendant from Michel (Fischer-Piette et. al., 1942: 110). Natica rocquignyi Fischer-Piette, 1942, was named in his honor, probably in consideration of unselfish service to the MNHN and posterity. Hugues had four children, the two youngest of whom, Francois (b. 1921) and Catherine, are still living. All were at the Chateau when the Michel Adanson Senegal Collection was released (Fischer-Piette et al ., 1942). Great-great-great-great grandfather of Guillaume de Rocquigny (1919-1973), second son of Hugues. Guillaume served as Proprietor of the Chateau, Musee, and Arboretum de Balaine and restored part of the chateau, and arboretum during his tenure. Great-great-great-great-great grandfather of Louise Courteix- Adanson, who is serving her 39 th year as Proprietor of F Arboretum de Balaine, having assumed that position at the time of her father’s death. Thus, although there appears to be a prodigious shell collection at Chateau de Balaine, it is unlikely that any specimens that were in the hands of “Le Savant” remain. This material derives from the labors of his grandson, Major Emile Doumet and great grandson Paul-Napoleon Doumet-Adanson. These remnants, although vastly larger than Michel Adanson’s material in terms of diversity and any other numerical metric, are of a lesser scientific value than that which was surgically excised and placed in Paris by Fischer-Piette seventy years ago. Nonetheless, this resource at Balaine may legitimately be characterized as the “Adanson Family Collection,” a vibrant cultural asset that has survived successive monarchies, empires, and republics, and a measure of neglect hopefully to illuminate and entertain future generations.

Summary and Conclusions The acquisition of a small collection of pretty shells from far-away and long ago has compelled me to place these objects in an historical and biological context to better understand the manifold levels in which people and mollusks interact. Conchology may be a “light form of study” (Eliot, 1872: 113) to some, yet a contemporary of equal literary renown and, like Garrett before him, interred in Partula country, held that this form of study reaps greater rewards than those conferred by vast pecuniary riches (Stevenson, 1911: 45). The players and their works revealed in this Partula chronicle certainly conform far better to the latter perception.

Lee - shells@hglee.com SHELLS IN THE NEWS From Josy Wiener of Boynton Beach, Florida, comes news of a display at the Ft. Lauderdale Museum of Art, titled “Jour¬ ney Through Faith and Art.” One of the displays is a model of a church in Amman, Jordan that is made of white marble with inlaid polished sea shells around the windows and doors. The model is made of inlaid shell pieces. The shells are Haliotis iris Gmelin, 1791, also called the paua or blackfoot paua, a New Zealand endem¬ ic renowned for its blue and silver nacre and often used for jewelry. (Photo credit unknown.) From Ed Sossen of Hollywood, Florida, as printed in the Broward Shell Club newsletter, The Busycon, comes this, \"Ed was recently at an antique show in Miami where he no¬ ticed a tiger cowrie - a common $1.00 \"bin shell\" on a dealer's ta¬ ble with a price tag of $200! When Ed asked why the high price the dealer replied...'Well, just look at the quality they don't make them like that anymore.' Buyer be¬ ware.\" (Photo from Wikipedia.com.) The July 2011 issue of Scientific Ameri¬ can reported snails being sold in Paris, in which a land snail shell is purchased from “dustmen and ragpickers” and then stuffed with “lights or cats’ meat,” cut into a corkscrew form to fit the shell. The fake escargot is sealed with fat and sold to unsuspecting con¬ sumers. On Conch-L, David Campbell pointed out that “cats’ meat” is actually meat intended for cats, rather than the meat of cats. Dick Petit then added that “lights” are lungs. As a closing comment, David Campbell stated the basic principle that, “...anything with enough garlic butter will taste like garlic butter sauce.” (Photo from Wikipedia.com.) Page 20 Vol. 40, No. 1 Shrimp boats are a-comin’ - there’s shelling tonight: A high seas adventure to Trujillo Bay, Honduras Karen VanderVen Shell collectors have pursued the hunt for molluscan specimens from every type of floating object ranging from World War II landing craft to tiny inflatables. A lucky few recently had the opportunity to live aboard and shell from a 100-foot fully-fitted shrimp boat. The shells retrieved from this vessel were not the by- catch cast aside by shrimpers, but rather those found by an intrepid group of divers who, every night as the sun slipped below the horizon, stepped backwards into the black wavy Caribbean waters below. The destination for this adventure was Trujillo Bay, a five mile semi-protected body of water surrounded on the coastal side by high mountains and the small town of Trujillo at the base of the mountainous Honduras coastline. Several rivers flow down from the mountains carrying rich nutrients that have produced a rich and varied ecosystem, including many forms of shell life that live and flourish on the Bay’s sand and grass bottom. Robert Masino was organizer and trip leader. Charles Rawlings, Steve Zinn, Marc Nathanson, and I were the divers who got to go along last April (2011). We were lured by the promise of such rare shells as Conus harlandi Petuch, 1987, Conus sunderlandi Petuch, 1987, Vokesimurex cabritii (Bernardi, 1858) (f .donmoorei Bullis, 1964), Volutapolypleura hennequini Petuch, 1995, as well as the potential for top adventure. We spent the night before our embarkation for Trujillo at the Turquoise Bay resort on Roatan. There was time for an afternoon snorkel to a special spot where in the past there had been a colony of Strombus pugilis Linnaeus, 175 8. They seemed to be more scarce this time, but I was quite happy with several beautiful black and cream striped bivalves, Chione cancellata (Linnaeus, 1767) and a small Fasciolaria tulipa (Linnaeus, 1758). Next morning we boarded the shrimp boat Captain Ron and embarked on the five hour cruise to Trujillo Bay. With Robert’s leadership Boarding the Captain Ron. (Photo by M. Nathanson) Above: Our leader Robert Masino checks our gear for a final time before heading to Trujillo Bay. (Photo by M. Nathanson) Below: A view of the mountainous terrain around Trujillo Bay and our gear laid out in preparation for the night’s dive. (Pho¬ to by M. Nathanson) and expertise on all aspects of the trip, and a large, helpful, and pleasant crew, we knew we’d be in good hands all the way. Scuppers and Suppers Prior to the trip there was a bit of buzz. How would the divers enter the water when a shrimp boat rides high and there is no obvious opening or platform from which to step off? Even more challenging ... how would they get back on after each dive? These questions were answered for good that first night. Here’s how we did it. The divers, carefully steadied by the attentive and muscular crew, would step over the railing, one leg after another and put March 2012 American Conchologist Page 21 Conus harlandi crawling on a broken piece of coral. Although photographed during the day, like the other specimens, it was collected during a night dive. (Photo by author) their fins through the scupper, the square opening in the metal wall going around the boat. They would be held while holding on to the railing, and putting one hand tightly over their mask then take a reverse ‘giant stride.’ I added an additional step of breathing. “Bombs away” I mumbled into my regulator as I stepped off and in a nanosecond - the time it took to fall about 6 or 7 feet - hit the water, soon to continue my journey downward. Getting back on? The crew would place a wooden ladder over the side and cluster at the top holding it down tight. I made a point of being sure to surface right under the ladder, coming up after the preceding diver had climbed up. Off with the BC and tank in the water where strong hands would hand it up to a crew member on deck. Then scamper up the ladder and over the railing where more helpful hands provided a steadying effect. Once on deck we could not wait to open our collecting bags and review the bounty we had brought up from the bottom. Nights, Lights, and Delights Most of the dives were between 30 and 40 feet deep, allowing us lots of time on the sandy and grassy bottom. We scanned this terrain with our bright dive lights and began to come up with the anticipated finds. There is no bigger thrill than when, in the beam of your light, there is a perturbation in the sand that you know will be something ‘ interesting. ’ For the cone aficionados (that is, everybody) there were the hoped-for fine specimens of the endemic rare cones, Conus harlandi and Conus sunderlandi. The Conus harlandi were particularly large, with distinctive brown markings. The Conus sunderlandi , with yellow orange dorsums and a band of white around the middle and at the base, brought joy to us all when we spotted them. There were also Conus spurius Gmelin, 1791, handsome shells that were more abundant. These would be out on top of the sand and each was a thrill to find. Collectively we all ended up with a beautiful size and pattern series to bring home.

(Both photos by author) 1792 as well. Of course we ended up with some ‘mystery cones’ that nobody could quite place. On one lucky night dive, I no sooner reached the bottom than I spotted two of the lovely Vokesimurex cabritii f. donmoorei out for a little walk (crawl?) in the grass. All of us found several specimens of this stunning shell with its perfect spines and rich orange brown, spiny dorsum. Adding to our murex finds were smaller Haustellum rubidus panamicus Petuch, 1990. Each night we found several darkly marked olives, Oliva reticularis Lamarck, 1811, in an endemic form. The Strombus species found were: Strombus pugilis, Lobatus costatus Gmelin, 1791, and Lobatus raninus (Gmelin, 1791). The latter were exceptional in that they were dwarfs and more colorful than their more northerly counterparts. The Strombus pugilis were hardly ho-hum with incredibly rich dark orange apertures and large spines. One night we wanted to try deeper water and headed down to 60 feet. Here, even a finger probe in the sand raised a cloud of visibility-killing silt. We started up at once. In spite of this, Robert not only miraculously retrieved several really lovely Polystira albida (G. Perry, 1811), but also generously shared them with us once we were on top. Members of the ‘ Voluta musica complex’ are always a treasure and, as with many of the other local forms, were richly colored. We all brought up the rich brown and purple Voluta polypleura hennequini Petuch, 1995. Other notable gastropod finds included Xenophora conchyliophora (Born, 1780), Prunum oblongum (Swainson, 1830), Phalium granulatum (Born, 1778), Cymatium nicobaricum (Roding, 1798,), Natica canrena (Linnaeus, 1758), Turritella exoleta (Linnaeus, 1758), and an unidentified Terebra species. Not to be ignored were the bivalves. Robert told us that the egg cockles found here were vibrant orange and yellow. I picked up a few small pairs, but Marc saved the day by sharing with me a large specimen as brilliant as the sunrise. Also dark and colorful were the brown mottled Argopecten nucleus (Born, 1778), that I found and added to my pecten collection. As a bonus, Robert handed me a colorful Euvola ziczac (Linnaeus, 1758). Even the areas ( Anadara transversa (Say, 1822) and turkey wings (Area zebra (Swainson, 1853)) were attractive. Pairs of checkerboard clams (Macrocallista maculata (Linnaeus, 1758)), and king’s Venus (Lirophora paphia (Linnaeus, 1767)) further enriched the bivalve take. Between the first and second night dives our chef served up a hearty dinner that we hungrily scarfed down while standing up on the deck, using it to warm us as we looked forward to our next jump into the shell-filled waters. When we came up again, we’d have a snack and head for bed. Nothing felt better than climbing into my dry bunk and sipping a few drops of the firewater rum I bought in Roatan. Sun and a Gun Preceding the night dives were day-time photographing activities. Each night, selected live shells were placed in an aquarium to ‘pose’ for photographs in the morning. Charles rose at the crack of dawn - the sun came up early here - and took the shells and his underwater camera down to the bottom to photograph them in situ. Often I’d go down with him, circling the photography site like a shark, but without getting so close I spooked the operation. March 2012 American Conchologist Page 23 (This was learned from a previous trip when I, with tunnel vision, made a beeline for a large cone I had spotted. My hand was just about to snatch it up when I saw Charles with his large underwater camera poised to photograph it and I backed off... just in time). These morning excursions were extra exercise for me and an opportunity to work off the bountiful meals I had been eating. There were few if any shells out, justifying our emphasis on the very productive night diving. We’d be out of the water before 7:00 AM. Otherwise we didn’t dive until the sun slipped below the horizon, and one might wonder how we whiled away the daytime hours. We would keep ourselves busy on the boat all day and the time flew by. A canopy was put up on the deck during the day to shelter us from the sun’s bright rays. We could be found each day on deck treating our shells, showing them to the admiring eyes of the others, organizing our dive equipment, and reading (I was thankful for my Kindle). With time out for an ample lunch followed by an hour or so of spirited conversation, I would also retreat to my topside bunk where I could watch the lines on the masts as the wind came up in the afternoon. The more they shook and vibrated back and forth, as a wind indicator, the higher the waves we might expect to encounter for the night’s dives. Mercifully there was no current and conditions permitted diving every night. The weather was nearly impeccable and I don’t believe there was a drop of rain the entire time. We all marveled at the stunning sunsets each night as we anticipated it becoming just dark enough for us to take our first dive. Of course it is not a live-a-board adventure trip in the Above: A Prunum oblongum photographed alive by R. Masino. tropics without being boarded by the local militia. Sure enough, Be|ow .

I went out to stand on the deck with the men and it was not long until, having found everything in order, they were chatting pleasantly with all of us before they disappeared as fast as they had come, climbing down into their vessel and chugging off.

These beautiful shells are seemingly endemic to this area and both were greatly anticipated prizes we looked forward to collecting. (Photo by M. Nathanson) To Shore and More Adding to the excitement of the trip were occasional trips away from the ‘mother boat,’ taking the dinghy to the shore, where Charles, Steve, and the crew explored both mangroves and shoreline. I was the lucky one since they slipped me some of the shells they brought back, which were different from those found diving. Charles handed me a clump of mossy oysters that I happily accepted. Cleaned up and displayed, they turn out to be Isognomon bicolor (C.B. Adams, 1845) and are beautiful with their unusual shape and nacreous interiors. Steve added a set of bubble shells {Bulla striata Brugiere, 1792) and a Melongena bicolor (Say, 1826). Even the crew got in the picture, bringing us a little bag of coquinas and periwinkles. All of these extended the scope and variety of my collection from this trip. All too soon the eight days of diving were over and we prepared for the return to Roatan. Flying from Roatan to San Salvador, to Washington DC, and on to Pittsburgh, was enervating, but the opportunity for such a unique experience, with both the variety and rarity of specimens collected and the camaraderie with fellow shellers and crew, made the trip memorable and worthwhile.

Crepidula fornicata (Linnaeus, 1758), and 3. Crepidula plana Say, 1822, are all shells com¬ monly collected along the east coast of the US, and yet there is still much unknown about these common species. I am interested in how organisms can adapt to ongoing climate change and how patterns of adaptive evolution are influenced by dispersal. In marine invertebrates this means comparing species with dispersing planktotrophic larvae that can live in the water for weeks with direct-developing species whose young crawl away from their mother (or egg sac) as juveniles. In my dissertation research, I am hoping to answer questions relating to how different dispersal types in the gastropod genus Crepidula can influence extant and potential adaptation to warming temperatures. During the summer and fall of 2011,1 conducted research funded in part by a fellowship from Conchologists of America to investigate local adaptation to temperature in larvae and juveniles of Crepidula fornicata , C. plana , and C. convexa , three species native to the east coast of North America. C. fornicata and C. plana have planktotrophic larvae that live in the water for 2-4 weeks and C. convexa has direct-developing larvae. In previous dissertation work, I found that C. convexa has much lower gene exchange among populations than C. fornicata (see also Collin 2001), but I wanted to know if that translated to ecologically relevan"
