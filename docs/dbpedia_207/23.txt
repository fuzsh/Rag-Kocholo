Background The Raphitomidae family in the Mediterranean Sea is under revision. Accordingly, new data are of taxonomic and comparative relevance. In this study, new material from the Hellenic Seas is presented. Results The Raphitomidae fauna of Greece was collected and investigated during the period from October 2008 to February 2018. Thirty-five (35) species were identified and their status was compared with existing checklists and other collections. This effort revealed two new Raphitoma species, and one new record for the Mediterranean Sea. Also from the present collection, four species are new records for the East Mediterranean, 10 for the Hellenic fauna and six are reported for second time. The main identification characteristics and baseline ecological information are given and discussed. Conclusions By this report, the Hellenic Raphitomidae biodiversity is enriched by 10 new records, out of which, two are new species, one is new record for the Mediterranean Sea, and four for the East basin.

Fauna Norvegica

This monograph gives a taxonomic treatment of all 54 ‘species’ of Pyramidellidae reported from Norwegian and adjacent waters. Two species, Parthenina wikanderi n.sp.and Eulimella frielei n.sp., are described as new and three are ‘resurrected’ from synonymy. Nine previously described species are reported as new records for Norway, while three species are removed from the Norwegian fauna list. All species are illustrated with LM photographs (and, in a few cases, SEM photographs), and drawings of soft parts and operculae when available. An attempt is made to upgrade the generic taxonomy of the species included. © 2014, Norwegian University of Science and Technology. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the authors deal with Raphitoma corbis (Potiez et Michaud, 1838) (Gastropoda Conoidea), a poorly-known taxon differently interpreted over time, by fixing a neotype in order to stabilize the nomenclature because the type material has been lost
