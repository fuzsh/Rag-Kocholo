THE VELIGER © CMS, Inc., 2006 The Veliger48(31:136-142 (November2. 2006) A New Genus of Indo-West Pacific Turridae (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia) ANTONIO BONFITTO Dipartimento di Biologia e. s., via Selmi, 3, 40126 Bologna, Italy (e-mail: [email protected]) AND MAURO MORASSI via dei Musei, 17, 25121 Brescia, Italy (e-mail: [email protected]) Abstract. Based on specimens collected in the Gulf of Aden at bathyal depths and stored primarily in Museo di Zoologia delTUniversita di Bologna, Acanthodaphne sabellii, gen. & sp. nov. is here described and figured. The Recent Pleurotomella abbreviata Schepman, 1913, from Ceram Sea, Indonesia, and Puha pusula Laws, 1947, from the Early Miocene ofHokianga, New Zealand, are recognized as belonging to the new genus. SEM photographs oftype specimens of both previously known Acanthodaphne species are provided. INTRODUCTION Daphnellinae Casey, 1904), previously included in the family Turridae, is transferred to the Conidae.
