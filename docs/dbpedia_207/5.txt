Conoidean gastropods of the genera Kermia, Oliver, and Pseudodaphnella Boettger, (Raphitomidae) are common in shallow-water habitats of the tropical Indo-Pacific. They form a distinct morphologically homogeneous complex, easily recognizable by sculpture and colour pattern, encompassing around 80 described species. Examination of a vast material accumulated during recent expeditions in various regions of the Indo-Pacific revealed a number of undescribed species of this complex. Our material included 32 morphospecies available for molecular phylogenetic study; phylogenetic reconstruction based on the COI gene confirmed the species hypotheses based on morphological characters. A total of 18 terminal taxa were attributed to known species and 14 were identified as new species. Of these, 12 species, for which sufficient material was available, are described. Phylogenetic analysis indicated close relationships of the genera Kermia and Pseudodaphnella with members of some other conoidean genera (specifically Exomilus Hedley, , Paramontana Laseron, and Thetidos Hedley, ) and taxonomic implications of the data obtained are discussed. To test the taxonomic value of protoconch and review its wide use in classification of Conoidea, the evolution of the protoconch morphology was reconstructed using a phylogenetic tree. It has revealed that protoconchs of different types may appear in closely related species, sometimes hardly distinguishable by teleoconch morphology. A switch from planctotrophic to non-planctotrophic mode of development occurred at least four times in the evolutionary history of the KermiaPseudodaphnella complex, indicating high developmental plasticity of the group. Its role in radiation of the KermiaPseudodaphnella complex and applications for use of protoconch morphology in the classification of Conoidea are discussed.

The deep sea of temperate southeastern Australia appears to be a 'hotspot' for diversity and endemism of conoidean neogastropods of the family Raphitomidae. Following a series of expeditions in the region, a considerable amount of relevant DNA-suitable material has become available. A molecular phylogeny based on this material has facilitated the identification of diagnostic morphological characters, allowing the circumscription of monophyletic genera and the introduction of several new genus-level taxa. Both named and new genera are presently being investigated through integrative taxonomy, with the discovery of a significant number of undescribed species. As part of this ongoing investigation, our study focuses on the genera Famelica Bouchet & Warén, 1980, Glaciotomella Criscione, Hallan, Fedosov & Puillandre, 2020 and Rimosodaphnella Cossmann, 1914. We subjected a comprehensive mitochondrial DNA dataset of representative deep-sea raphitomids to the species delimitation methods ABGD and ASAP that recognised 18 and 15 primary species hypotheses (PSHs) respectively. Following additional evaluation of shell and radular features, and examination of geographic and bathymetric ranges, nine of these PSHs were converted to secondary species hypotheses (SSHs). Four SSHs (two in Famelica and two in Rimosodaphnella) were recognised as new, and formal descriptions are provided herein.

Molecular phylogenies of cone snails have revealed that the c. 350 sequenced species are divided into four main lineages, Conus, Conasprella, Californiconus and Profundiconus. In a recent study, minute species (less than 8 mm) were for the first time included in a molecular phylogenetic tree and were shown to correspond to deep lineages, of similar status to the four previously recognized, and sister-group to Californiconus. They were attributed to the available generic names Lilliconus and Pseudolilliconus. In this article, we analyse, using morphological (shell and radula) and molecular characters (cox1 gene), several species of minute cone snails, and we conclude that the species considered as Pseudolilliconus in the previous study should actually be placed in a new genus, Pygmaeconus. By comparing the cox1 genetic distances calculated among the species of Lilliconus, Pygmaeconus and Californiconus with the genetic distances calculated among other cone snails species included in different subgenera and genera, and by comparing the estimated ages of Lilliconus and Pygmaeconus with the ages of other caenogastropod genera, we conclude that Lilliconus and Pygmaeconus can be considered at the genus rank.
