The Penn Central Transportation Company, commonly abbreviated to Penn Central, was an American railroad name that was used at the Class I railroad level from 1968 until 1976. The railroad system that applied the Penn Central name was a combination of railroad systems from three railroads: the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), New York Central Railroad (NYC) and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NH). The railroad system started off as a combination of the PRR and New York Central systems first as the system began as a merger between the PRR and the New York Central in 1968, the New York, New Haven and Hartford was added in 1969.

The legal entity that eventually became the Penn Central Transportation Company was the former Pennsylvania Railroad, which absorbed the New York Central as part of the 1968 merger and at the same time began using the Penn Central name to reflect the merger with the New York Central. The company remained headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after its merger with the New York Central. By 1970, the company had filed for what was, at that time, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.

The company has since escaped bankruptcy and is now known as American Premier Underwriters and currently serves as a subsidiary of Carl Lindnerâ€™s American Financial Group
