        "text": "The New York was the major freight and passenger railroad in southern New England until 1969, and is now split between a number of companies. Lines formerly operated by it or a subsidiary should be tagged old_railway_operator=NYNH&H in addition to railway=rail (if still in use) or railway=abandoned.\n\nSee Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/ICC valuations for a chronology (which may have some errors) of lines constructed by the NYNH&H and predecessors, compiled by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1915-18.\n\nBelow is a list (roughly complete) of ex-NYNH&H lines, approximately separated by divisions as they existed at the time the RDBR codes were assigned (ca. 1970), with mapping status.\n\nBoston Division\n\nName Name (1969) RDBR
