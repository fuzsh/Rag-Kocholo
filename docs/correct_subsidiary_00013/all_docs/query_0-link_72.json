It operated from 1845 to 1893. From 1845 to 1893, the OC network grew extensively largely through a series of mergers and acquisitions with other established railroads, until it was itself acquired by the New York-New Haven & Hartford Railroad under lease agreement on March 1, 1893 for its entire 617-mile network. After this date, all trains, lines, and stations became known as the \"Old Colony Division\" of the huge \"New Haven\" system. During this period, the New York-New Haven & Hartford Railroad enjoyed a virtual monopoly on all passenger and freight rail service in southern New England.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOld Colony Railroad\n\nItem: 6-O Price: $125.00\n\nRemarks: Operated 1845-1893\n\nForged by the Wilson Bohannan Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nHandsome accent ring barrel.\n\n125 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nOther parts of the former OC system continue to be used for freight service by CSX Transportation and other short line railroads, including the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad which operates on Cape Cod and in southeastern Massachusetts.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOil Creek Railroad\n\nItem: 9-O Price: $145.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1800s\n\nPocket worn stamp marks with great\n\ngold patina.

The company was chartered on August 17, 1860, by railroad investor Thomas Struthers of Warren, Pennsylvania, and several other Warren businessmen. The charter authorized the construction of a railroad from any point on the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad to Titusville, Pennsylvania, along the Oil Creek to Oil City and Franklin.\n\nFrom 1864 to 1865, the OCRR's primary function was to transport oil from the oil-producing regions of Pennsylvania to the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in Corry, Pennsylvania. The OCRR existed independently until 1868 when it was purchased by the Warren and Franklin Railway and combined with other short line oil transporting railroads in western Pennsylvania to form the Oil Creek and Allegheny River Railway.\n\nThe company was sold at foreclosure on December 29, 1875, and was acquired on February 8, 1876 by the Pittsburgh, Titusville and Buffalo Railway, which eventually became part of the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railway and the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOmaha Railway\n\naka \"The Chicago-St. Paul-Minneapolis & Omaha Railway\"\n\nSOLD Price: $85.00 $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nNice pocket worn lettering and gold patina.\n\nGiven the moniker, \"The Granger Line.\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe Chicago-St. Paul-Minneapolis & Omaha Railway or Omaha Road (reporting mark CMO) was a railroad in the U.S. states of Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota. It was incorporated in 1880 as a consolidation of the Chicago-St. Paul & Minneapolis Railway and the North Wisconsin Railway. The Chicago & North Western Railway (C&NW) gained control in 1882. The C&NW leased the Omaha Road in 1957 and merged the company into itself in 1972.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOmaha Railway\n\naka \"The Chicago-St. Paul-Minneapolis & Omaha Railway\"\n\nItem: 12-O Price: $85.00 $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOneida Railway\n\nItem: 14-O NY trolley line Price: $100.00 $90.00\n\nRemarks: operated 1907-1930\n\nOwned by the - NYCS, also has a\n\nToledo & Ohio Central style bit.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Oneida Railway, which was an interurban rail, was established in 1907 when the New York Central Railroad electrified 49 miles of the West Shore Railroad between Syracuse, New York and Utica, New York. The interurban railroad used nontraditional third-rail pickup for power instead of the typical overhead catenary. In 1909 the system merged with the New York State Railways system which remained in business until 1930.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOregon Short Line Railroad\n\nItem: 19-O early 1881-82 issue Price: $165.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nEarly A&W hex stamp = 1st series.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and carmel patina.\n\nLow three digit serial #\n\nKey bit style similar to Clinchfield Key\n\n125 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Oregon Short Line Railroad (OSL) was a railroad in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Montana and Oregon. The line was organized as the Oregon Short Line Railway in 1881 as a subsidiary of Union Pacific Railway. Union Pacific intended the line to be the shortest route (\"the short line\") from Wyoming to Oregon. In 1889 the line merged with the Utah & Northern Railway and a handful of smaller railroads to become the Oregon Short Line & Utah Northern Railway. Following the bankruptcy of Union Pacific, the line was taken into receivership and reorganized as the Oregon Short Line Railroad.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOregon Short Line Railroad\n\nItem: 20-O CS-2 Price: $95.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nNice stamp marks and two-tone gold patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nThe OSL was independent for a short period of time until October 1898 when the newly reformed Union Pacific Railroad took control of a majority of the board of directors. During the early part of the 20th century the railroad publicized tours of Yellowstone National Park by way of a spur constructed from Idaho Falls, Idaho to West Yellowstone, Montana. In 1938, Union Pacific began consolidating operations and leased for operation a number of its subsidiaries including the Oregon Short Line. The railroad operated under the lease until December 30, 1987, when the OSL was fully merged into the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOregon Short Line Railroad\n\nItem: 21-O switch key Price: $125.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOregon Short Line Railroad\n\nItem: 22-O Special Price: $195.00 $175.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nEarly A&W hex stamp = 1st series.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nKey listed in the \"American Railway's Switch Key Directory.\"\n\n125 year + centenarian!\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOregon Short Line Railroad\n\nItem: 23-O Price: $195.00 $175.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and copper patina.\n\nShows better in your hand.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nOregon, Washington Railroad & Navigation Co.\n\nItem: 25-O post 1910 UP/OWRR&N Co. merger key Price: $115.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and two-tone patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Oregon Railway and Navigation Company's purchase of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company in 1880 gave it a partial route on the south (Oregon) side of the Columbia River. The company then pursued expansion of its Columbia River route, surveying from where the Oregon Steam Navigation tracks ended at Celilo and continuing east to Wallula. By 1882 the route along the Columbia River was complete.\n\nOR&N was initially operated as an independent carrier, but Union Pacific (UP) purchased a majority stake in the line in 1898. It became a subsidiary of UP titled the OregonâWashington Railroad and Navigation Company in 1910. In 1936, Union Pacific formally absorbed the system, which became UP's gateway to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nP\n\nPacific Coast Railroad\n\n(California)\n\nItem: 7-P Price: $175.00 $165.00\n\nRemarks: Operated 1873-1941\n\nForged by the E.T. Fraim Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pacific Coast Railway was a 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge railway on the Central Coast of California. The original 10-mile (16 km) link from San Luis Obispo to Avila Beach and Port Harford was later built southward to Santa Maria and Los Olivos, with branches to Sisquoc and Guadalupe.\n\nSan Luis Obispo was a town totally trapped by mountains. The only way building materials could arrive, and farming goods could leave the area was aboard steamships anchored in San Luis Obispo Bay (Avila Beach). This was the start of what would become the PCR.\n\nOregon Improvement Company obtained controlling interest in the Pacific Coast Steamship Company in late 1882, reorganized the railroad as the Pacific Coast Railway, and extended the line to Los Alamos. The increased agricultural business was shortly overshadowed by discovery of oil in the Santa Maria Valley. By 1902 the railroad had converted its engines to burn oil and was strapping tanks from standard gauge cars onto their flatcars at the rate of ten per month.\n\nProfits peaked in 1921 and declined as automobiles became more common. After a brief period of hauling gravel for construction of U.S. Route 101 in 1928 and 29, the Pacific Coast Railway started to crumble slowly. The gravel business required purchase of two 2-8-0s from the recently standard-gauged Nevada-California-Oregon Railway to replace Pacific Coast 2-8-0s dismantled for parts to keep the other engines running. Service to Los Olivos was reduced to a twice-weekly mixed train by 1930 and ended in 1933. Most of the remaining equipment was cut up for scrap by 1948, but caboose number 2 has been preserved at the California State Railroad Museum.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPacific Great Eastern Railway\n\nItem: 9-P Price: $115.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nNice stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nHistory\n\nBritish Columbia's largest railroad and Canada's third largest was the Pacific Great Eastern Railway of the early 20th century. The system languished for years as an incomplete, money-losing operation with a few hundred miles in service north of Vancouver. This changed after World War II when government funding helped expand the PGE by several hundred miles and it continued to grow throughout the 1980s. By then the railroad was renamed as the British Columbia Railway and efforts were in place to extend it to the Alaskan border, finally allowing that state to connect with the North American rail network. This proposal would ultimately fall through due to rising costs. Later, the BC Rail system disappeared into Canadian National, which now leases the entire railroad from the local government.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPacific Electric Railway\n\nItem: 11-P Price: $125.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nEarly A&W hex stamp = 1st series.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\n125 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nPacific Electric, also known as the Red Car system, was a privately owned mass transit system in Southern California consisting of electrically powered streetcars, interurban cars and buses. The PE was the largest electric railway system in the world in the 1920s. Organized around the city centers of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, it connected cities in Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Bernardino County and Riverside County. The system shared dual gauge track with the 3 ft 6 in narrow gauge Los Angeles Railway, \"Yellow Car\", or \"LARy\" system on Main Street in downtown Los Angeles (directly in front of the 6th and Main terminal), on 4th Street, and along Hawthorne Boulevard south of downtown Los Angeles toward the cities of Hawthorne, Gardena and Torrance.\n\nFollowing these acquisitions, PE was the largest operator of interurban electric railway passenger service in the world, with 2,160 daily trains over 1,000 miles of track. It operated to many destinations in Southern California, particularly to the south and east.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPacific Electric Railway\n\nItem: 12-P Price: $95.00\n\nRemarks: ca. post 1930\n\nForged by the Fraim Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and two-tone patina.\n\n80 year + octogenarian!\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPennsylvania Seashore Lines\n\nSOLD New Listing Price: $145.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines was a railroad that operated in southern New Jersey in the 20th century. It was created in 1933 as a joint consolidation venture between two competing railroads in the region.\n\nOn March 4, 1931, New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) ordered the two companies to join their southern New Jersey lines into one company. The Consolidation Agreement decreed that the Pennsylvania Railroad had two-thirds ownership, and the Reading Company had one-third ownership. While the P-RSL did not enter bankruptcy, its owners, the Penn Central, (successor to the PRR) and the RDG did. As a result, Conrail took over the P-RSL on April 1, 1976.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPennsylvania Railroad\n\naka \"The Pennsy / Penna Lines\"\n\nItem: 15-P switch key Price: $100.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early-mid 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and carmel patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad was an American Class I railroad that was established in 1846 and was headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Edgar Thomson, an engineer from the Georgia Railroad, to survey and construct the line. He chose a route that followed the west bank of the Susquehanna River northward to the confluence with the Juniata River, following its banks until the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains were reached at a point that would become Altoona, Pennsylvania.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPennsylvania Railroad\n\naka \"The Pennsy / Penna Lines\"\n\nItem: 17-P switch key Price: $55.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nNice stamp marks and bright gold patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nBy 1882, the Pennsylvania Railroad had become the largest railroad (by traffic and revenue), the largest transportation enterprise, and the largest corporation in the world. Its budget was second only to the U.S. government. The corporation still holds the record for the longest continuous dividend history: it paid out annual dividends to shareholders for more than 100 consecutive years.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPennsylvania Railroad\n\naka \"The Pennsy / Penna Lines\"\n\nItem: 18-P Stamped \"PRR\"/NYC Price: $95.00 $80.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-late 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co\n\nVery nice stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nDifferent but nice.\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nOn June 15, 1887, the Pennsylvania Limited began running between New York and Chicago. This was also the introduction of the vestibule, an enclosed platform at the end of each passenger car, allowing protected access to the entire train. In 1902 the Pennsylvania Limited was replaced by the Pennsylvania Special which in turn was replaced in 1912 by the Broadway Limited which became the most famous train operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. This train ran from New York City to Chicago, via Philadelphia, with an additional section between Harrisburg and Washington (later operated as a separate Washington-Chicago train, the Liberty Limited).\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPennsylvania Railroad\n\naka \"The Pennsy / Penna Lines\"\n\nItem: 19-P knobby car key Price: $95.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1921-30\n\nForged by Fraim/Slaymaker Co.\n\nSuperb serif stamp marks and dark patina.\n\n80 year + octogenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nEarly in the 20th century the PRR tried electric power for its trains. First was the New York terminal area, where tunnels and a city law restricting the burning of coal precluded steam locomotives. There a direct current (DC) 650-volt third rail powered PRR locomotives (and LIRR passenger cars). The system was put into service in 1910.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPennsylvania Railroad\n\naka The Pennsy / Penna Lines\"\n\nItem: 20-P knobby car key Price: $95.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1879-1917\n\nForged by the E.T.

When the PS&N declared bankruptcy in 1905, the B&M was spun off into a separate entity and was renamed in 1909 due to confusion with the Boston & Maine Railroad's initials. Like its parent, the P&S was also financially troubled in its early years. The company struggled until corporate fortunes improved with the war mobilization of the 1940s. Coal was the principle commodity for the line for its entire existence. Doodlebugs and passenger trains ran on the route in the early years but had all been eliminated by 1939.\n\nThe company acquired a ten mile section of Conrail track running from Sligo to Lawsonham in 1989 and reorganized it as the Red Bank Railroad. On December 31, 1991 the company purchased about 110 miles of \"low grade secondary\" track from Lawsonham to Driftwood, Pennsylvania from Conrail and organized it as the Mountain Laurel Railroad.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPenn Central Railroad\n\nItem: 38-P Original Pennsy cut Price: $25.00\n\nRemarks: Operated 1968-1976\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Penn Central Transportation Company, commonly abbreviated to Penn Central, was an American Class I railroad headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that operated from 1968 until 1976. It was created by the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads. The New York-New Haven & Hartford Railroad was added to the merger in 1969; by 1970, the company had filed for what was, at that time, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPenn Central Railroad\n\nItem: 39-P Original Pennsy cut Price: $55.00\n\nRemarks: Operated 1968-1976\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nThe legal entity that eventually became the Penn Central Transportation Company was the former Pennsylvania Railroad, which absorbed the New York Central as part of the original 1968 merger and, at the same time, began using the Penn Central name to reflect its merger with the New York Central.

Buck Co.\n\nVery nice elongated tapered barrel\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nHistory\n\nThe streetcar system in Pensacola can be traced to Conrad Kupfrian, a German immigrant who was reportedly inspired by the horsecars he saw in St. Louis on a business trip. He formed a partnership, the Pensacola Streetcar Company, with Henry Pfeiffer and John Cosgrove. The men raised $50,000 in capital for the project and, on November 15, 1882, convinced the Pensacola City Council to pass an ordinance allowing steel track to be placed in the roadways.\n\nAn economic downturn affected the streetcar company in 1897. It was reorganized again as the Pensacola Electric Terminal Railway Company, with Captain William H. Northrup as president. During the course of it's operation, the PE had exchanged owners a few times. The PE was plagued by union strikes, segregation problems and later, the automoblie. At its peak, a total of 30 trolley cars carried four million passengers per year (1920). Partially covered tracks and barely concealed right-of way are clearly visible in various places along the former routes, including on West Gadsden Street, West DeSoto Street, and East Jackson Street.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPeoria Railway Terminal\n\nItem: 45-P Peoria short line Price: $55.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nRustic serif lettering and patina.\n\nOnce owned by the Rock Island, Chicago & Alton\n\nand Peoria & Pekin Union Railroads.\n\n100 year centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Peoria Terminal was incorporated January 18, 1926, under the general laws of Illinois, to acquire the property of the Peoria Terminal Railway Company.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPublic Belt Railroad Co. - New Orleans\n\nItem: 47-P Price: 125.00 $110.00\n\nRemarks: mid-1900s\n\nNice stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nHistory\n\nThe New Orleans Public Belt Railroad is a Class III railroad, and a subsidiary of the Port of New Orleans. It connects with six Class I railroads serving the city, and provides switching and haulage service. It is estimated that one-third of the United States' east-west rail freight crosses the Mississippi on the Huey P. Long Bridge segment of the railroad.\n\nThe railroad is managed by the Public Belt Railroad Commission, which also owns and maintains the Huey P. Long Bridge.

In 1907, the PRT and the city negotiated a contract giving PRT management of all transit lines and their construction. This contract secured PRT's monopoly and provided the city with regulatory authority and profit-sharing in the operation of the rapid transit system.\n\nIn 1940, PRT was officially reorganized into Philadelphia Transportation Company. The old company union was long gone by the mid 1940s, and employees were organized by the Teamsters and the Transit Workers Union. Control of the city's transit lines passed to National City Lines in the 1950s, which was then consolodated into SEPTA in 1968.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad\n\nItem: 55-P Price: $85.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1904-21\n\nForged by the S.R.

At the time of its incorporation the PS&N operated four physically-disconnected divisions. The expense of connecting the divisions and upgrading the physical plant to handle through coal trains, coupled with the failure of the PS&N's principal bond underwriter, forced the company to declare bankruptcy in 1905.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPittsburgh & West Virginia Railway\n\nItem: 62-P Price: $175.00 $160.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nEarly A&W hex stamp = 1st series.\n\nExcellent stamp marks and two-tone patina.\n\n125 year + centenarian!.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway was a railroad in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Wheeling, West Virginia, areas. Originally built as the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway, a Pittsburgh extension of George J. Gould's Wabash Railroad, the venture entered receivership in 1908 and the line was cut loose.\n\nThe Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway was another western Pennsylvania/northern Ohio system serving Pittsburgh's once prolific steel industry. Ironically, the P&WV was a relative latecomer to the industry; much of its network was not constructed until after 1900 and the road only truly came of age during the 1930s. As a result it moved considerable coal, coke, and iron ore. However, the railroad is perhaps best remembered for its status as a bridge line and member of the famous \"Alphabet Route.\"\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPere Marquette Railroad\n\nItem: 65-P Price: $85.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nVery nice pocket worn lettering\n\nSuperb dark patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pere Marquette Railroad was incorporated on November 1, 1899 in anticipation of a merger of three Michigan-based railroad companies that had been agreed upon by all parties.

In the 1920s the Pere Marquette came under the control of Cleveland financiers Oris and Mantis Van Sweringen. These brothers also controlled the New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate), the Erie Railroad and the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, and planned to merge the four companies. However, the ICC did not approve the merger and the Van Sweringens eventually sold their interest in the Pere Marquette to the C&O, with which it formally merged on June 6, 1947. The C&O has since become part of CSX Transportation.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPomeroy & Newark Railroad\n\nItem: 69-P Price: $225.00 $195.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nPennsy predecessor and a 125 year + centenarian beauty!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pomeroy & Newark Railroad was a predecessor of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the U.S. states of Delaware and Pennsylvania. It connected Pomeroy, Pennsylvania to Newark, Delaware, and has mostly been abandoned.\n\nThe Pomeroy & Newark Railroad was the final step in a series of consolidations and a foreclosure. The earliest predecessors were the Delaware and Pennsylvania Railroad, incorporated February 1857 in Delaware, and the Pennsylvania and Delaware Railroad, incorporated August 1868 in Pennsylvania as the Doe Run and White Clay Creek Railroad, and renamed August 1870. The two companies completed a line from Pomeroy, on the Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line, south to Newark and southeast to Delaware City on the Delaware Bay, in about 1873, and merged in May of that year to form the Pennsylvania and Delaware Railway.\n\nThis company's property was sold at foreclosure in August 1879 to two new companies, the Pomeroy and State Line Railroad (incorporated February 1880 in Pennsylvania) and the Newark and Delaware City Railroad (incorporated April 1880 in Delaware). After the former sold the line southeast of Newark to the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B), which it crossed at Newark, in 1881, those two companies merged in December as the Pomeroy and Newark Railroad. It became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system, and in December 1917 the line was sold to the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, Pennsylvania subsidiary and successor to the PW&B.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nPeoria & Pekin Union Railroad\n\nItem: 71-P Price: $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nNice pocket worn lettering and bright\n\ngold patina.This key stamped \"RR\" + key\n\nbelow stamped \"RY\" = nice set.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Peoria & Pekin Union Railway (PPU) is a switching and terminal railroad in Illinois that began operating in 1881 and was leased to the Tazewell & Peoria Railroad in 2004.

Key listed in the\n\n\"American Railway's Switch Key Directory.\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pickering Valley Railroad was a short line railroad in Chester County, Pennsylvania. It ran from Phoenixville to Byers, near Eagle, in Upper Uwchlan Township, a distance of approximately 11 miles (18 km), over which distance it gained 316 feet (96 m) in elevation. The company was incorporated June 4, 1869, under the provisions of a special act of the Pennsylvania government approved April 3, 1869, and organized June 22, 1869, with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company subscribing to the bulk of the stock. In or about 1870, the still-unbuilt railroad was leased to the Reading Railroad; it opened in September 1871.\n\nPassenger service on the Pickering Valley was discontinued in 1934, and the portion of the line from Kimberton to Byers was abandoned in 1948. The remaining track served the Phoenix steel mill (a portion was also briefly used by the Valley Forge Scenic Railroad until abandoned by Conrail (successor to the Reading) in the 1980s.
