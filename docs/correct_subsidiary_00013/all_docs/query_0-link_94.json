        "text": "What Conrail is Today\n\n\"Conrail still exists, as a terminal operator for owners Norfolk Southern and CSX in three \"shared assets areas\" in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, and sent out this summary of its role. Conrail's heritage of providing safe and efficient rail service continues today for many local rail freight customers in Detroit, New Jersey, and Philadelphia. As of June 1, Conrail owners CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern absorbed most of Conrail's former operations in 12 Northeastern and Midwestern states, so today Conrail's role is to provide customers along its remaining lines with access to CSX, NS and, through them, to the nation's rail network. Although Conrail no longer handles most commercial matters for customers, it plays a critical role in serving shippers and receivers as agent for its owners. As agent, it's Conrail's job as local rail service provider to make sure that customers' freight shipments are safely and efficiently moved between their sidings and the long distance freight trains operated by CSX and NS. In addition, CSX and NS operate trains over Conrail tracks to reach major yards, terminals, and distribution facilities located in Detroit, New Jersey, and Philadelphia. In the Detroit area, Conrail operations over nearly 90 miles of railroad are focused in the north-south corridor connecting Trenton, Detroit, and Sterling Heights/Utica, Mich. Major yards served by Conrail include Livernois, North, River Rouge, and Sterling yards. Geographic limits include Trenton on the south, Carleton on the southwest, and CP Townline in Dearborn on the west. In northern New Jersey, Conrail operates nearly 200 miles of railroad concentrated in Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union counties. The hub of CR activities is Oak Island Yard in Newark, with smaller yards in Bayonne, Greenville (Jersey City), Linden, Manville, Metuchen, Newark, Old Bridge, Port Reading (Woodbridge), and Red Bank. Conrail also operates new automobile distribution facilities in the area on behalf of its owners, and provides local freight service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor between Newark and Trenton. In the Philadelphia/southern New Jersey area, Conrail operates about 250 miles of railroad, providing local freight service on virtually all lines south of Trenton, and provides connections with the short lines serving the remainder of the region. In Pennsylvania, Conrail lines serve many customers in Philadelphia, and along or near the Delaware River in Chester and lower Bucks counties. Conrail also provides local service for customers along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor between Philadelphia and Trenton. The hub of Conrail operations in the region is Pavonia Yard in Camden, N.J., with local yards in Chester, Morrisville, and the Midvale, Port Richmond, and South Philadelphia areas of Philadelphia. In New Jersey, local yards are at Burlington City, Mount Holly, Paulsboro, and Woodbury. Conrail's company headquarters are located at 2 Commerce Square, Philadelphia. In addition to the company's office of the president, other functions located in the Center City headquarters include community relations, employee and corporate communications, finance and administration, human resources, labor relations, and law. Conrail's Mount Laurel (N.J.) office houses Conrail's operations functions, including engineering, mechanical, police, and transportation, including a computer-assisted train dispatching facility. A customer service office will be transferred to Mount Laurel from Pittsburgh later in 1999. \" (Trains)"
