        "text": "Local Union No. 25 of the International Brotherhood of\n\nTeamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of\n\nAmerica v. New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Co.\n\nNo. 33\n\nArgued November 10, 1955\n\nDecided January 9, 1956\n\n350 U.S. 155\n\nSyllabus\n\nAn interstate railroad which engaged in hauling loaded truck-trailers \"piggy-back\" brought an action in a state court to enjoin a labor union from conduct which interfered with such operation and which allegedly violated the Labor Management Relations Act. Employees of motor carriers with which the union had collective bargaining agreements had been persuaded by agents of the union to refrain from delivering loaded trailers to the railroad for \"piggybacking.\" The union was not concerned in any way with the railroad's labor policy, nor was there any claim that the union interfered in any manner with the railroad's employees.\n\nHeld: the case is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, the railroad may seek any remedy it may have before said Board under the Labor Management Relations Act, and the state court had no authority to enjoin the union's conduct. Pp. 350 U. S. 156-161.\n\n(a) A railroad subject to the Railway Labor Act is not precluded from seeking the aid of the National Labor Relations Board in circumstances unrelated to the railroad's relations with its own employees. Pp. 350 U. S. 158-161.\n\n(b) The question whether there was a violation of the Labor Management Relations Act is for the National Labor Relations Board to determine. P. 350 U. S. 161.\n\n(c) Even if the union's conduct is not prohibited by ยง 8 of the Labor Management Relations Act, it may come within the protection of ยง 7, in which case the State is not free to enjoin the conduct. P. 350 U. S. 161.\n\n(d) Weber v. Anheuer-Busch, Inc., 348 U. S. 468, followed. P. 350 U. S. 161.\n\n331 Mass. 720,122 N.E.2d 759, reversed."
