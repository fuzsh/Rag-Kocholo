        "text": "The New York Central’s moving spirit was Erastus Corning (1794–1872), four times mayor of Albany, who for 20 years had been president of the Utica and Schenectady, one of the consolidated roads. He served as president of the New York Central until 1864. In 1867 Cornelius Vanderbilt won control, after beating down the Central’s stock, and combined it with his New York and Hudson railroads running from Manhattan to Albany.\n\nVanderbilt joined it to the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway in 1873, extending his system from Buffalo to Chicago. He added the Michigan Central in 1871. Under his son William, the Central acquired the New York, West Shore, and Buffalo Railroad on the west side of the Hudson River in 1885. The system grew until it had 10,000 miles (16,090 km) of track linking New York with Boston, Montreal, Chicago, and St. Louis.\n\nAfter World War II the New York Central began to decline. Between 1946 and 1958 it dropped four of its six fast daily passenger runs between New York and Chicago. Efforts to merge with its chief competitor, the also ailing Pennsylvania Railroad Company, culminated in 1968 with the creation of the Penn Central Transportation Company—a merger that later included the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, in 1969. The new colossus had 21,000 miles (33,790 km) of track. Its creators hoped to achieve a division of labour, sending freight to New York and New England north along the New York Central’s water-level route while the Pennsylvania main tracks served the industrial needs of Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the Delaware and Schuylkill valleys."
