        "text": "Raritan River Railroad (RRRR) No. 10 was originally built in 1942 as New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad No. C559 at the Pullman Company (former Osgood-Bradley) plant in Worcester, MA. This caboose lasted in service through the January 1, 1969 absorption of the New Haven by the Penn Central Transportation Company. It was sold to the Raritan River Railroad by Penn Central on May 7, 1969, along with sister car No. C682, for $1,400. There was an additional $2,000 in freight costs plus repairs, for a total cost of $3,400 for both cars. No. C682 became RRRR No. 9, and No. C559 became RRRR No. 10.\n\nThe Raritan River Railroad, which operated between South Amboy and New Brunswick, NJ, became part of Conrail on April 24, 1980, and No. 10 became Conrail class NE5 No. 19796. The car was stored at the former Reading Railroad yard in Rutherford, PA, where Tri-State's equipment committee, led by John Sobotka and Bob Bahrs, found the car in 1986. Tri-State obtained the caboose from Conrail in 1986, along with DL&W No. 896 and L&NE #580. RRRR No. 10 is one of only five surviving pieces of Raritan River Railroad equipment.\n\nToday it is owned and operated by the Tri-State Railway Historical Society, and was restored inside and out in 2013 by a team of Tri-State volunteers led by the late Don Oberding. RRRR No. 10 is maintained in operational condition, and is currently stored at the United Railroad Historical Society of NJ's restoration facility in Boonton, NJ."
