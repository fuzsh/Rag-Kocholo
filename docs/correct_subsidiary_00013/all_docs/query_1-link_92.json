To the right is a switcher leading some freight cars in the opposite direction. Check out the nice looking State of Maine box car on the right. Also seen on the right are four classic semaphore blade style block signals. Notice the vintage vehicles located in the left foreground, of which many are sought after today. Downtown Boston is seen in the background.

Actually these locomotives provided a change of appearance from most of the other New Haven Railroad electric locomotives, because with the use of DC motors along with solid wheels as compared to the quill drive wheels found on most other NHRR locomotives, it was quite different. This locomotive was utilized for testing purposes until some time in the late 1950's. Of interest, there is padlock used to secure the locomotive's front entrance door. You may notice that along the locomotives's side that the Condemned \"C\" has been placed below the locomotive's side struck through number. When these locomotives were in service from 1926 until 1948, they were mostly operated in pairs, however, they could and were operated independently. Notice the wheel chocks placed under the front pilot wheels. These electric freight locomotives were also use at times in passenger service on mail-baggage-express trains and on troop train assignments during WWII. When they used in passenger train service these motors would be provided with a steam heat trailer.\n\nThe name of the photographer that captured this image on film is unknown.

These MUT cars are of the older vintage of open platform style cars that were built by the Standard Steel Car Company between 1909 and 1912. This combination of MU cars has a motor coach at both ends and a trailer coach in the middle A large number of these open platform MU cars lasted until 1955..\n\nThe name of the photographer that captured this image on film is Richard H.

These Mountain locomotives which were copies of the Boston & Maine R1-d class steam locomotives were handsome and powerful engines in my opinion. The L&HR Railway only had 3 of these Mountain locomotives numbered 10 - 12. The start of the yard area is situated to the far right.\n\nThis photo came from my photo collection and the photographers name is James D. Bennett.

This heavyweight open platform was built by the Standard Steel Car Company in 1912. A good portion of the steel constructed open platform MU cars made it through until 1955, however, this trailer combo did not. Spotted on the track to the left is a New Haven baggage-express car. With that large bumper post station sign you know exactly where this branch line train will have scheduled stops along it short route.\n\nThe name of the photographer that captured this image on film is unknown.

I also like electric railways and this one was interesting - much of the 1903/5 - 1915 overhead structures survived and I was also fortunate enough to be shown around the original but then closed Cos Cob power station that served the electrification when it was inaugurated using Westinghous technology. It was ground breaking stuff, one of the pioneers to move from DC and relatively low voltages to AC and at 11kv, 25hz, it packed a punch. Although the lines into the terminus at Grand Central required a change to 3rd rail (and still does at Woodlawn?) as did the tunnel connections that linked the NYNH&H to the Pennsylvania system reached over the wonderful Hell Gate Bridge, the overhead represented a substantial portion of their system - as it also would of the Pennsylvania en route to Washington. The poster shows the overhead - the first phase used a triangular section of catenary that the guys who showed me around Cos Cob were terrified would collapse one day given its age (I suspect it has been replaced now!) and the only other railway to use such a similar design was the long removed London \"Elevated Electric\" overhead electrification of the London Brighton & South Coast Railway that lasted from 1909 - 1929 when the Southern converted it to 3rd rail.\n\nThis is one of a set of possibly four posters issued c1950s to a similar template, the others publicising steam, diesel and dining cars, it does almost echo some of the Pennsylvania's famous use of their iconic GG-1 electric locomotives. The motive power seen here is I think one of the freight EF-3a class, batches I believe were built by both GE and Westinghouse and delivered in the 1940s. A passenger version, the EP-4 class, was also constructed all by GE in the late 1930s. It is telling a story of the importance of freight transport to the railroad in the North Eastern states it served, not mentioning that the electrics stayed resolutely south of New Haven. Electrification to Boston, a long term aim, finally came under recent Amtrak patronage in 2000.\n\nNew Haven Railroad eastbound middle era Clerestory MUT (Multiple Unit Train), with trailer coach # 4245 in the lead, is seen while stopped at a station platform in Stamford, Connecticut, ca late 1940's. These middle era Clerestory MUT's were originally delivered to the New Haven Railroad between 1921 and 1922 and came in two versions, motor coaches and trailer coaches. These MUT's ran well for years and provided good service to the New Haven Railroad.\n\nThe name of the photographer that captured this image on film is unknown.

This photo is sort of sad because it was taken only two months prior to the New Haven Railroad being absorbed into the PC. Not many years after this observation-lounge car went into service, a diaphragm was added to the observation end to make the car usable in mid-train operation. Information regarding the yard's location as being New Haven was provided on the original slide, however, I did not recognize the location as New Haven, and perhaps someone else can verify the location. However, I did view another similar photo and it also said New Haven, so it probably is.\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for the purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Both the EF-2's 0113 and # 0114 lived on after the other locomotives were condemned in 1948, and lasted until the late 1950's in this capacity. When in service these 1,260 hp motors usually were operated in pairs and they used DC traction motors, much like in diesel electric locomotive practice. Evidently the motor generator units themselves provide quite a few problems and the locomotives were often found out of service for required repairs. In this scene you may observe the electrical equipment that is connected to the stationary locomotive.\n\nThe name of the photographer that captured this image on film is unknown.

Notice that only one rear marker lantern is used on this MUT, You can see with the learn of the train that this curved track is super-elevated. This must be a warm summer day, because a good portion of the windows are open on each car.\n\nThe name of the photographer that captured this image on film is unknown.

This scene was taken about 2-1/2 years after the end of the New Haven Railroad, however, at this time all four platform tracks were still in place. At this time I believe Paul told me that he was riding an early day Amtrak train on this line.\n\nThe station platform tracks are main line tracks, and freight trains also pass through this passenger station.\n\nIt is interesting that the Trailways Bus Station is now situated in the north end of the station building, because numerous years prior the old Connecticut Company buses used this same location for their bus station. Across the street (Union Place) many of the old establishments that have been here for years are still in operation, such as \"Connecticut Lunch\" cafeteria. In the background you can clearly see the State of Connecticut Capitol Building.\n\nPaul Coe the railfan photographer and friend, which has numerous catalog photos of passenger cars, also including their interiors, that were published in many books and magazines provided me with a small 3 x 5 color print that I scanned to present this photo.\n\nThis still extant but non-functioning coaling tower represents the final remains of the once vast rail yards on the New Haven Railroad in New Haven, Connecticut. The last vestiges of the old railroad somehow escaped the wrecking ball.\n\nIn the foreground is an Amtrak work train carrying welded rail for the USA's only high speed rail route, which is along the northeastern corridor from Boston to Washington. The USA is a laggard among nations in the advance of high speed rail and relatively cleaner forms of mass transportation.\n\nUSA HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION FACTS:\n\n* In major American cities, the length of the combined morning-evening rush hour has doubled, from under three hours in 1982 to almost six hours today.\n\n* The average driver now spends the equivalent of nearly a full workweek each year stuck in traffic.\n\n* Congestion costs Americans $78 billion a year in wasted fuel and lost time.\n\n* Truckers and the businesses that depend on them say clogged roads are choking off economic growth and reducing the nation's competitiveness.\n\n* Studies repeatedly show that people making long commutes are at a higher risk for a host of maladies. High blood pressure, sleep deprivation, and depression top the list.\n\n* On a typical day, the average married mother with school-age children spends 66 minutes driving; taking more than five trips and covering 29 miles.\n\n* Some 42,000 people are killed in auto crashes each year, and 3 million are injured.\n\n* All this congestion comes with a price: $78 billion a year in wasted time and burned gasoline.\n\n* Increased congestion has also led to a rise in road rage.\n\nThe Maybrook Line of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad provided a crucial east-west freight transportation route between Maybrook, New York, and Derby, Connecticut. The line's centerpiece was the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge, which spanned the Hudson River and was one of the longest of its kind in the United States upon its completion in 1888. The Maybrook Line played a significant role in the NH's operations until its merger with Penn Central in 1969.\n\nHowever, in 1974, a fire caused the closure of the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge, rendering the Maybrook Line inaccessible for through traffic. As a result, a substantial portion of the line was abandoned. Nonetheless, some sections of the line were repurposed for public use, including the Hudson Valley Rail Trail, the Dutchess Rail Trail, the Maybrook Trailway, and the Walkway Over the Hudson. Moreover, several short-line operators and Metro-North continued to operate on certain portions of the line and still do so to this day. More recently, a 14-mile stretch of the Maybrook Line from Danbury, Connecticut to Brewster may either be abandoned for a rail-to-trail or repurposed as a commuter rail line for Metro-North.\n\n➤ Check out more photos, map, and a history of the Maybrook Line at abandonedonline.net/location/new-york-new-haven-hartford-...\n\n➤ Learn more about the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge at bridgestunnels.com/location/walkway-over-the-hudson/\n\nAmtrak welcoming for EMD E8 diesel electric locomotive # 4036, leading the reinstated Montrealer seen along with a large crowd standing on the platform with numerous flags, just after it arrived at the station in Meriden, Connecticut, September 30, 1972. It's 10:47 PM as indicated by the station clock, and the crowd was quite large for such an event. The train operated as a night time train from Washington, D.C. via New York City to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, plus provided sleeping and lounge car service. Back during prohibition the southbound return trip version of the train was called \"The Washingtonian,\" was also known quietly as the \"Bootlegger,\" for obvious reasons. The return Amtrak train that operated between 1972 through 1974 was also called the Washingtonian. This train is seen operating on the former New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Springfield main line for this portion of the trip. The photographer was able to capture the engineer nicely within the locomotive cab. Photo courtesy of DP\n\nThis station was built in 1916 by the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. It replaced 2 small stations that were considered too close together -- one for Central Falls and one for Pawtucket. The entire station is built on a bridge above the tracks.\n\nThis station is abandoned now and it's kind of a wreck. Nonetheless it is still clear that this large, elaborate station was impressive in its day. The size and grandeur of this station is odd for its location -- this isn't a major city and Providence (which at the time had its own large, elaborate station) is only a few miles away.\n\nUntil 1981, MBTA commuter trains stopped here, and there's some support for reinstating this stop (but I doubt it will happen.)\n\nThis wreck of a building is located along the Northeast Corridor, where I have tried to get pictures of it from trains many times. (This time, I got off the train...)\n\nAccording to the Guilford Preservation Alliance, this building and the adjacent water tower were built in the 1870s. (The responsible railroad was probably the New York, New Haven & Hartford RR, which took control of this line in 1872.) The Guilford Preservation Alliance apparently had lofty hopes about restoring these 2 buildings and using them again, but the last update on their website was dated over a year ago and they may have given up on that pipe dream by now.\n\nThe Maybrook Line of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad provided a crucial east-west freight transportation route between Maybrook, New York, and Derby, Connecticut.

I don't know the exact year, but it was probably around 1905 when Paragon Park (big amusement park) opened at this location. Paragon Park's popularity was probably the reason for having such a relatively large and elaborate station here, since Hull at that time wasn't very populous. The building is in great condition currently (but the clock isn't running) and now houses an ice cream parlor.\n\nThe railroad line through Hull was originally built in 1880 by the short-lived Nantasket Beach Railroad, and initially operated in isolation with no connections to other railroads. It was later connected to the rest of the Old Colony RR system, and from 1893 on was operated by the New Haven RR.\n\nThe New Haven's Nantasket Branch was one of the first examples in the country of electrification of a heavy-rail (not streetcar) line. In the late 19th century the line briefly used a central third rail (just like Lionel toy trains, which weren't around yet) -- a poorly planned idea that turned out to be too much of a safety hazard and was swapped for catenary power. During the 20th century, streetcars ran on this route and made 13 stops between Nantasket Junction in Hingham and Pemberton Point at the northern tip of Hull (a distance of about 7 miles, which I traveled along today by bike.) The line was abandoned in 1937, the rails have been removed, and besides this building there are no other signs that there was ever a railroad here.\n\nThe New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad built this bridge in 1900. It now carries the Northeast Corridor. I put a note on the photo to show the hand-written notation 190.49. This is NEC mile 190, and everywhere along the NEC where there's a bridge or a tunnel, there's a hand-written mileage notation somewhere (not sure of the reason for that.)\n\nThe bridge's stone and concrete construction has allowed it to continue carrying trains for 113 years with no problem, but its very narrow and low underpass area is only barely adequate for modern auto traffic. It's also located on a blind curve. Signs warn drivers to sound their horn before passing under the bridge, which most of them do. Having cars repeatedly come up behind me honking their horn was making me jumpy, so I didn't hang around to try to get a decent shot of a train on the bridge. (And no I wasn't standing in the street like here, and they weren't honking at me, it's just what the signs say to do. I do have one shot with a train, but it's not that great, since there wasn't really any good vantage point anyway.)\n\nThe building immediately adjacent to this bridge, and visible through it here, is a maximum-security prison called the Wyatt Detention Facility. The city of Central Falls -- formerly an important industrial area -- supported and partially funded this prison's construction, apparently thinking it would be a great way to \"replace\" (in terms of employment) all the mills that the city used to have. (Probably a more literal replacement too -- since the prison is right next to both the Blackstone River and the railroad, it's very likely located on the site of a former mill. Welcome to the modern era -- we don't have manufacturing anymore, but we sure have prisons!) Apparently it didn't really provide many local jobs after all, and furthermore the prison has been the subject of controversy over the past several years, having to due to with how inmates were treated and questionable remarks made by prison officials.\n\nThe crane was built in 1914 by Industrial Crane Works of Bay City, Michigan. The crane was co owned by the New York Central Railroad and The New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. It was built specifically for the tunnels in and around Grand Central Terminal. The crane has lifting booms at each end so that it doesn't matter in which direction it was headed into a tunnel, it would be in a position to work at re-railing cars.The crane was powered electrically from the third rail in the tunnels, however,i t required a large number of storage batteries which were ganged-up in series in the ceiling of the wrecker to provide constant power. The crane was capable of lifting 100 tons.The crane worked on Penn Central and Metro-North Railroad before going to the Danbury Railway Museum in 1998.
