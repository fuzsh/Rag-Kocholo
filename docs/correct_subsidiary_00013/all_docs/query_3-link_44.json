The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, reversed, finding that Penn Central, the plaintiff, had not been unconstitutionally deprived of its property. This decision was affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals. In a six to three decision, the United States Supreme Court affirmed. Held: Plaintiff's property was not taken unconstitutionally because the combined effect of the restrictions and the allowed transfer of unused development rights permitted the owner a reasonable beneficial use of its property.
