        "text": "WHEREAS disputes exist between the carriers represented by the National Railway Labor Conference, designated in List A attached hereto and made a part hereof, and certain of their employees represented by the United Transportation Union, a labor organization; and\n\nWHEREAS these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and\n\nWHEREAS these disputes, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive the country of essential transportation service:\n\nNow, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate these disputes. No member of the board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier.\n\nThe board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the disputes within thirty days from the date of this order.\n\nAs provided by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the carriers represented by the National Railway Labor Conference, or by their employees, in the conditions out of which the disputes arose.\n\nRICHARD NIXON\n\nThe White House\n\nJuly 7, 1970\n\nLIST A\n\nEASTERN RAILROADS\n\nAkron & Barberton Belt Railroad Company\n\nAkron, Canton & Youngstown Railroad Company\n\nAnn Arbor Railroad\n\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad Company\n\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (Buffalo Division) Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (Strouds Creek and Muddlety Territory)\n\nBaltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad\n\nBangor and Aroostook Railroad Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Boston and Maine Corporation Buffalo Creek Railroad\n\nCentral Railroad Company of New Jersey\n\nNew York and Long Branch Railroad\n\nCentral Vermont Railway, Inc.
