What I realized was that I had no one central (no pun intended) place where someone could go and find everything I have plus what others have too.\n\nLike great passenger trains, we added a second section.\n\nDisclaimer: As the New York Central system-wide timetable, Form 1001, used to read:\n\n“Subject to change without notice, not responsible for errors and ommissions.”\n\n**********\n\nRailroad Station at Troy, New York\n\nThe station in Troy was owned by the Troy Union Rail Road. The TURR lasted from the mid 19th Century till the mid 20th Century. It was owned by the New York Central, Delaware & Hudson and Boston & Maine. Access from the South was from Rensselaer; from the West, via the Green Island Bridge; from the North was street running almost the entire length of Troy.\n\nThe station consisted of 6 thru tracks and towers at each end. The Central had at least one switcher assigned here.\n\n**********\n\nGirl Of The Century\n\nThe Century Girl, or, if you prefer…The Girl of the Century\n\nJoan Jennings Scalfani\n\nGetting ready to reprise her role as a “Century Girl” for the 20th Century Limited express passenger train brought back these memories and more for Joan Jennings Scalfani.\n\n“It was a fabulous job because I love to talk and I love to listen,” said Scalfani, 80, recalling her days in the early 1960s as a hostess aboard the historic line. “Those were happy days.”\n\nThe Williamsville, NY resident returned to New York City’s Grand Central Station recently as a featured guest for one of the events of the iconic hub’s centennial celebration. A collection of railway cars, including an observation car from the 20th Century Limited, was on display.\n\nThe train would leave Grand Central Station at 6 p.m. and arrive in Chicago by 9 the next morning. It had about 26 cars with staterooms, smaller compartments, and dining and lounge cars.\n\nOne Century Girl was assigned to each trip.\n\n“The train was beautiful,” she said. “In the center lounge car there were love seats. … It was a very classy-looking interior. It wasn’t trainlike; it was like a living room,” Scalfani said.\n\nIt was the sort of car where Harry and Bess Truman might have stayed when she asked them during their breakfast whether they had rested well.\n\n“The president said, ‘Won’t you join us?’ And I certainly couldn’t say no,” she said. “They were very pleasant and very down-to-earth.”\n\nSilent-movie comedian Harold Lloyd asked her to join him for lunch. “You’ve been so kind to me,” he told her. “I’d love you to join me for lunch.”\n\n“He really appreciated the fact that I spent so much time there at his doorway,” Scalfani said.\n\nDecades later, she still regrets not accepting his offer.\n\nAs she remembers it, Hemingway was less talkative. The author “was more interested in having dinner,” she said. “I didn’t stay too long.”\n\nHorne, traveling with her jazz pianist husband, Lennie Hayton, was lovely but even less interested. The singer and actress “looked like she wanted me to get out of there,” Scalfani said. “In person, she was even more gorgeous.”\n\nIn 1961, after 15 months on the job, the Century Girls were among the thousands laid off after a railroad strike. Scalfani, who grew up in Baltimore, eventually moved to Buffalo in a marriage that ended in divorce. She raised two daughters here. Her career in nonprofit management included almost a decade as director of Episcopal Charities.\n\nScalfani said she found train passengers to be in-depth people with a leisurely attitude. They had time to sit, look out the windows and think about the towns and countryside rolling by. And they talked.\n\n“It’s like, ‘We’ll never see each other again, so I can bare my soul,’ ” Scalfani said. “They took the time, and it was just special.”\n\nShe looks forward to putting on the Century Girl suit that always made her feel stylish.\n\n“It’s like being able to turn the clock back,” she said.\n\nSee a YouTube presentation featuring Joan Jennings Scalfani in Grand Central Terminal\n\n***********\n\nA New Hudson Bridge, Revived Beacon Line, HYPERLOOP and More\n\nThe Maybrook Line was a line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad which connected with its Waterbury Branch in Derby, Connecticut, and its Maybrook Yard in Maybrook, New York, where it interchanged with other carriers.\n\nIf one looks at the most popular Pages on our WebSite, over half directly reference the Maybrook Line. Lot’s of folks have an interest in it. The “Maybrook Line” was important to New England before the advent of Penn Central and before the Poughkeepsie Bridge burned. This piece of the railroad carried freight from Maybrook Yard, across the Poughkeepsie Bridge to Hopewell Junction where it joined a line from Beacon. The railroad then went to Brewster, then Danbury, and finally to Cedar Hill Yard in New Haven.\n\nWHY and How To Fix The “MAYBROOK LINE”?\n\nContainer port/intermodal facility/rail bridge\n\nThe construction of a railroad bridge between New Hamburg and Marlboro is likely the least expensive place to build a Hudson River crossing between Manhattan and Albany. The stone for ramps, sand and gravel for concrete and a steel beam assembly and storage area would be right on sight. All materials and equipment could be transported by barge or boat. The bridge itself would have only four or five piers (the most costly part to build) since the Hudson River is about the same width as it is in Poughkeepsie.\n\nThe Hudson River component connects Dutchess, Ulster and Orange counties to the world economy (finished goods, spare parts, components parts, raw materials, food stuffs) and the railroad and interstate road components connect these NY counties to the rest of North America (US, Mexico, Canada).\n\nWith the container port/intermodal facility/rail bridge, the flow in and out of raw materials, spare parts, partially finished goods, foodstuffs and components will allow for new industries and businesses to locate near this facility and add to the tax base of these three NY counties: Dutchess, Ulster and Orange counties.\n\nAlthough the Dutchess County Airport is a tiny regional airport with a 5,000 foot runway, it has some big potential. The airport land extends a mile Northeast of the present runway end at New Hackensack Road and borders on the former New Haven Maybrook Line/Dutchess Rail Trail. As the NY Air National Guard gets crowded out by international air traffic at Stewart International Airport their operation could be moved over to Dutchess Airport without disrupting the lives of the guard members and their families through forced relocation.\n\nBeacon itself is exploding with “developer” activity, and it needs a trolley or light rail for the city only to transform back into a pedestrian oriented city.\n\nOther activities include: Solidization of rail links in Connecticut to handle increased traffic; a possible HYPERLINK for improved service along the Beacon Line and in/out of New York City\n\n************\n\nInterested in Penn Central?

(The)\n\nTivoli Hollow Railroad Co. (chartered in 1893. It was completed 1.23 mi. in City of Albany, prior to 1903 (exact date not known).\n\n**********\n\nOrgin of Spuyten Duyvil\n\nThere are multiple ‘hypotheses’ for the origin of the term “Spuyten Duyvil.” The one that’s generally accepted as the most “authoritative” can be found in Washington Irving’s A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty. Irving tells the story of a messenger sent by New Amsterdam colony governor Peter Minuit (he of the famous $24.00 purchase) to go north and warn the folks there of a potential English invasion. When the messenger reached the creek at the north end of Manhattan Island it was, to use a line famous in writing classes “a dark and stormy night,” and the local boat operator refused to take him across to “The Bronck’s.” (I use the old Dutch spelling). Having been fortified by rum for his journey, the messenger said he would swim the creek im spijt den duyvil ** (“in spite of the devil”), jumped into the water and was never seen again.\n\n**********\n\nRailroads To The Adirondacks\n\nWebb’s Wilderness Railroad\n\nWebb’s Wilderness Railroad opened up the Adirondack wilderness. Although educated as a physician, William Seward Webb built two hundred miles of railroad and opened up the Adirondack wilderness where others had failed. New York Central tracks reached into the Adirondacks. One line even went across the Canadian border to Ottawa.\n\nRead the entire article.\n\nSee More About NY Central in the Adirondacks\n\n**********\n\nLong time Central employee and watchmaker Jacob Bachtold adjusts one of the more famous clocks in a 1946 photo (from New York Central HEADLIGHT)\n\nNew York Central Lines Magazine 1919-1925 and 1925-1931 and some of our other history sources: 1921 article from Transportation World and a story of “Health & Pleasure” from the 1890’s. Commodore Hotel , Chauncey Depew; “A Chronicle of R.W.& O. Days Since 1851” Contributed by Richard Palmer . New York Central Pacemaker Service .\n\nThe magazine contained articles by veterans such as W.I. Boyle who described the building of the famous locomotive “999” at West Albany. Dr. Plimmon H. Dudley, the railroad’s expert on rail metallurgy, would also accurately predict the weather. He was considered the “scientist of rails”. He died in 1924 at age 81. He had joined the New York Central in 1880 and had lived in the Hotel Commodore since it was built.\n\nAppearing frequently in the magazine was Lt. Col. Hiram W. Taylor (“Hi” Taylor). He was appointed Supervisor of Athletics in 1922. He had been a division paymaster and was known personally to most New York Central employees. He had served with honor in the First World War and remained a National Guard officer. His sports programs included a baseball “world series” pitting the Line East champions against the Line West champions with the winners being given a New York City harbor tour on a railroad tugboat or other similar trips. The Albany baseball league of 1930 contained six teams: car shop; locomotive shop; Mohawk Division; Albany Division; Rensselaer; and Selkirk. Taylor formed very competitive bowling leagues and golf matches. In 1925, Albany, the New York Central champions, played baseball against the Pennsylvania RR champions at the D&H field in Colonie before 10,000 spectators.\n\nOne article described a “typical” day at Grand Central Terminal: (1) A special train from Vassar College arrives just before a holiday. All the girls were greeted at the station or else found their destinations except for one who was helped by Traveler’s Aid. (2) A political candidate is escorted through the terminal by the Stationmaster. (3) Several immigrants wait for their train, sitting quietly together eating dark bread. (4) A high school team is going off to play a championship game in Chicago and is sent away by a large crowd of students. (5) A group of convicts changing prisons is escorted uneventfully through the station in handcuffs. (6) Boy Scouts bound for a “jamboree” are met at the station by other scouts. (7) All the Red Caps in the station run to meet the “20th Century”. The New York Central Police Force was always a topic of articles. Its first chief (Humphrey) retired in 1919 and had served with Teddy Roosevelt. The police were referred to as the men who see you without being seen.\n\nDuring this period Daniel Brady died. He was the brother of “Diamond Jim” and worked for the New York Central between 1871 and 1880. He was the founder of Brady Brass. George A. Harwood died in 1926 at age 52. He was a Tufts graduate who began railroad service in 1900. In 1906 he was placed in charge of electric improvement and is credited with completing the construction of Grand Central that William Wilgus had started. Chauncey Depew died in 1928. He was a Yale graduate of 1856. He was buried in Peekskill. In his honor, the huge concourse of Grand Central Terminal was draped in mourning.\n\nLCL Terminal at Utica, New York. (Photo clipped from the Utica Observer-Dispatch)\n\nNot until 1964 did the NY Central Annual Meeting move away from Albany. In Albany, the meetings were usually held in the Ten Eyck Hotel, or sometimes the Palace Theater. One exception was the proxy battle where Robert Young captured control of the railroad. This meeting was in the massive Washington Avenue Armory.\n\nIn 1950, NY Central’s stockholders held their annual meeting in Albany at the Hotel Ten Eyck. To encourage more holders to attend, a special train was run from New York to Albany, N. Y. (site of the meeting as fixed by the company’s charter). Stockholders, wives, husbands, and children (families were invited). Some of the directors and chairman Harold Vanderbilt are shown in photo. (Photo clipped from the Utica Observer-Dispatch)\n\nThe May 15, 1914 issue of what was then called “Railway Age Gazette,” described NYC&HR’s new electric crane delivered as GCT No. 1. The 100-ton capacity crane was designed with low clearance booms to work within the confines of Grand Central or the Park Avenue Tunnel. Builder was Industrial Works of Bay City Michigan. The unit was equipped with third rail shoes and double-ended with a boom and operating compartment at each end. I found fascinating that the self-propelled crane had 800 hp available for traction and was rated at 25 mph, yet reached 34 mph (with an 80-ton trailing load) during tests. The machine also had a 230-cell battery for service off the third rail or when power was interrupted.

It was in the area where a Grand Union supermarket was constructed. There were a couple of sidings and freight loading ramps too. I remember a station there, but it was only like a freight house or maintenance house in my times.\n\nSouth Street was actually East Utica, so couldn’t have been construed as “South Utica”. Remember, the West Shore cut diagonally across Utica from Genesee Street in a South-East direction. It crossed numerous streets with only a pair of cross-bucks for protection. They actually had to flag across Genesee Street! And it was double track too!\n\nEven the DL&W had gates (and even a gateman within my memory until they automated). DL&W still had passenger service after West Shore and O&W were well out of it. When DL&W discontinued their train to Binghamton, I remember the Short Line bus that replaced it struggling up Paris Hill in New Hartford with black/brown gas fumes spewing out the back, and hoped somebody would shoot it and put it out of its misery so the train would return It was a really cool train ride from Utica to New Hartford.\n\n**********\n\nRobert Young. The New York Central Railroad. Some of the most fascinating railroad literature of the 1940’s are transcripts of this unusual man’s testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission.

There is more on the Buffalo Central Terminal too; plus some great links to Buffalo Central Terminal. Something very interesting to me was that the entire terminal used 25-cycle electric power. This type of power was not unusual when industrial locations where nearby. The General Electric plant in Schenectady had it’s own power plant which made 25-cycle DC as well as 110V AC. In my time there, plant switchers were diesel, but they used DC electrics at one time, especially inside manufacturing buildings. (New York Central RR content: The General Electric Company Main Plant/Schenectady Works was definitely the largest on-line customer between North Tarrytown and Rochester/Buffalo)\n\nBuffalo Central Terminal Opened in 1929.\n\nBut Buffalo changed, railroads changed and the World changed after 1929.\n\n**********\n\nIn Montreal, New York Central trains came in to Windsor Station.\n\nThis massive station was the headquarters of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.

It bypassed Rochester, had no manufacturing industries and was too close to the New York Central.\n\nThe Lake Ontario Shore wasn’t able to make the grade and was sold to the RW&O in 1875 at a court sale for a bargain basement price. By building a short connection at Oswego, the RW&O now had a through route from Suspension Bridge to Norwood where connections were available to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**********\n\nThe first Budd RDC-1 went to the New York Central for service on the Boston & Albany in 1950.\n\nOur feature articles are the Budd RDC and Budd RDC’s in Connecticut.\n\nSee our Budd RDC Reference Material and read about the continuing saga of the Budd RDC.

At that time, the Rutland job still came down on a daily basis and the yard at Chatham still had two yard jobs one of which was maned by a B & A crew and the other by a Harlem crew. There were still two towers at Chatham at the time 66 and 65.\n\nThe entire Harlem was intact and in use for passengers until March 1972 and freight until March 1976.\n\nThe 1949 timetable shows three round trips of passenger service between New York and Chatham. There were 24/7 block stations at Brewster (B) and Chatham (SS-65) and 14 block stations open various hours between the two end points at this time. There was a wide variance in the running times of the above passenger trains on this line, the fastest one on the line was a Sunday evening train that made the run from Chatham to Grand Central Terminal in three hours and six minutes while some of the others took up to four hours or even more. All of the trains had to change engines at North White Plains and probably they were mostly steam between North White Plains and Chatham.\n\n**********\n\nTo clarify the ISSUES regarding the “NYC” Passenger Service.\n\nIn plain simple English, Bob Timpany, AVP Administration and in charge of the infamous New york Central Operating Management Trainee Program – which, is said to have generated some seven ( 7) railroad presidents – told everyone “we are losing our tails and we have reached the point of NO RETURN regarding passenger train deficits.” Costing cutting measures did not work. The operating unions would not agree to any changes in work rules. For example, engine service employees,, changed at Erie, PA, but the train crews when through between Buffalo, NY and Cleveland, OH! All of the states that were served by The “NYC” refused to contribute any form of financing to off-set the loses to provide a service the public DID NOT WANT. The company ran The Jet Train experiment in Northwestern Ohio as a way to induce governmental and public assistance. But alass, NO form of aid. The hearts and pocketbooks were with the love affair the American public had with the automobile and the concrete highways. “NYC” received a Million Dollars of FREE advertising and publicity to show that its existing right of way could handle an improved method of passenger train travel. Sadly, no one took the bait! Knowing full will that the railroad could not pull the plug on its total passenger service it elected to establish “The Empire Service” in the state of New York while consolidating the remaining trains west of Buffalo, NY. Remember, NY Central was two ( 2) different entities; Lines East of Buffalo and Lines West of Buffalo. Folks today could never realize the amount of planning and implementation which went into setting up “The Empire Service”. Each diesel locomotive had to be equipped with dual steam generators; three ( 3) car all coaches or one ( 1) cafe car and two ( 2) coaches with EVERYTHING WORKING; two ( 2) vestibules placed next to one another to enable fast loading and unloading of passengers; etc. The plan worked. The deficit was cut and it estabolished a new train of thought. The future for railroad passenger service was in the short haul markets. Further, the NYC finally convenienced the state of New York to start to generate funding for any remaining and expanded passenger services. Finally, the other eastern and midwestern states found out that The “NYC” was serious about finding a Godfather to pay for the service which the American public did not want. To think that Mr. Perlman and his staff wanted to trash all passenger service was a false statement. A the top of the morning report was the performance of both 20th Century Limiteds. This also included passenger counts, names of VIP’s on the trains, OS times at key terminals and the status of the next day’s Nos. 25 and 26. Below that came The Rielly (Cincinnati, OH and Chicago, IL). Below that came the “Van Trains” and the performance of NYC Motor Transport which sole purpose in live was to support “Flexi-Van Service”. Below that came the numbers for the electronic yards, viz., Avon (Big Four); Elkhart (Robert F. Young); Cincinnati (Sharonville), Toledo (Stanley); West Detroit (Livernois); Buffalo (Frontier); DeWitt; and Selkirk. The Morning Report and then The Head Count, which was generated by 1:00 PM every Friday, had better be right, including the coveted 20th Century Limited Trains. The “NYC” was in the business of generating a lot of cash to pay its bills and a profit. In fact, the saying around 466 Lexington Avenue was “MAXI-PROD” (Maximumize Profits). You could never perform that mission with a big passenger train drain.\n\n**********\n\nNew York Central might have been slow to start dieselization (still buying steam in late 1940’s), but once they started, they FLEW\n\n(Photo clipped from an old New York Central Headlight)\n\n**********\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nAs the New York Central system-wide timetable, Form 1001, used to read:\n\n“Subject to change without notice, not responsible for errors and ommissions.”\n\n**********\n\nInteresting and Important Dates on the New York Central Railroad\n\n1851 Twelve men are convicted of conspiring to burn down the Michigan Central Depot in Detroit in protest over high rates and autocratic business dealings by the railroad.
