MTA Metro-North Railroad 217 (Penn Central Heritage) made its revenue debut in its new colors on Train 734 on Monday, March 11, 2024, seen passing under the High Bridge in the Bronx New York. For the occasion, as has been done with the previous three, the set was turned for the locomotive to face south/east. This unit commemorates the New York State/Penn Central paint scheme used on FL9s during this era as part of Metro-North's ongoing 40th Anniversary celebrations, it's fourth wrap that joins the four Connecticut DOT New Haven tribute units. Penn Central's interlocked \"PC\" was commonly called \"mating worms\" From February 1, 1968 to April 1, 1976, Penn Central Railroad bridged the gap between New York Central and Conrail as the operator of today's Metro-North east of Hudson New York State Lines, and it was the inclusion of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad in 1969 that brought FL9s to the Hudson and Harlem Lines for the first time in revenue service.\n\nYouTube Video: https://youtu.be/64eZY7PZcSQ\n\nFull resolution pics and prints: \nhttps://www.riverrailphoto.com/metro-north/ee09dfdca\nhttps://www.riverrailphoto.com/metro-north\n\n#trb_express #tv_transport #railfannation #trains_r_the_best #railways_of_our_world #rsa_theyards #end_of_track #Train #Railroad #Train_Nerds #rail_barons #railstagram #Splendid_Transport #daily_crossing #bnw_society #ig_captures #instagram #igshotz #igers #pocket_rail #rla_theyards #jj_theyards #railsupremacy #gtrailfan_productions #trains_worldwide\".",
