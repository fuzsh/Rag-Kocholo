        "text": "The New Haven Railroad HomePage\n\nA half-century ago, everything in Connecticut was under the New Haven Railroad. Today is a lot different, Amtrak, Metro-North., several freight-only railroads and even some abandoned lines that could be re-started. Check out the best available map of all these with the Connecticut CDOT rail map.\n\n**********\n\nThe “Ride to Choate” ; The Railroad from Norwalk to Pittsfield; The Central New England Railway ; Connecticut Trolley Museum; Connecticut Freight Railroads ; Cape Cod Railroads\n\n**********\n\nA New Hudson Bridge, Revived Beacon Line, HYPERLOOP and More\n\nThe Maybrook Line was a line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad which connected with its Waterbury Branch in Derby, Connecticut, and its Maybrook Yard in Maybrook, New York, where it interchanged with other carriers.\n\nIf one looks at the most popular Pages on our WebSite, over half directly reference the Maybrook Line. Lot’s of folks have an interest in it. The “Maybrook Line” was important to New England before the advent of Penn Central and before the Poughkeepsie Bridge burned. This piece of the railroad carried freight from Maybrook Yard, across the Poughkeepsie Bridge to Hopewell Junction where it joined a line from Beacon. The railroad then went to Brewster, then Danbury, and finally to Cedar Hill Yard in New Haven.\n\nWHY and How To Fix The “MAYBROOK LINE”?\n\nContainer port/intermodal facility/rail bridge\n\nThe construction of a railroad bridge between New Hamburg and Marlboro is likely the least expensive place to build a Hudson River crossing between Manhattan and Albany. The stone for ramps, sand and gravel for concrete and a steel beam assembly and storage area would be right on sight. All materials and equipment could be transported by barge or boat. The bridge itself would have only four or five piers (the most costly part to build) since the Hudson River is about the same width as it is in Poughkeepsie.\n\nThe Hudson River component connects Dutchess, Ulster and Orange counties to the world economy (finished goods, spare parts, components parts, raw materials, food stuffs) and the railroad and interstate road components connect these NY counties to the rest of North America (US, Mexico, Canada).\n\nWith the container port/intermodal facility/rail bridge, the flow in and out of raw materials, spare parts, partially finished goods, foodstuffs and components will allow for new industries and businesses to locate near this facility and add to the tax base of these three NY counties: Dutchess, Ulster and Orange counties.\n\nAlthough the Dutchess County Airport is a tiny regional airport with a 5,000 foot runway, it has some big potential. The airport land extends a mile Northeast of the present runway end at New Hackensack Road and borders on the former New Haven Maybrook Line/Dutchess Rail Trail. As the NY Air National Guard gets crowded out by international air traffic at Stewart International Airport their operation could be moved over to Dutchess Airport without disrupting the lives of the guard members and their families through forced relocation.\n\nBeacon itself is exploding with “developer” activity, and it needs a trolley or light rail for the city only to transform back into a pedestrian oriented city.\n\nOther activities include: Solidization of rail links in Connecticut to handle increased traffic; a possible HYPERLINK for improved service along the Beacon Line and in/out of New York City\n\n************\n\nBridgeport Station (old)\n\n**********\n\nThe Connecticut Railfan: All About Railroads in Connecticut\n\nOur feature article is “Railroads of Connecticut” .\n\nYou should see our historical sketch of the New Haven Railroad\n\nFor those interested in the New Haven Railroad, we have 1937 and 1949 Fan Trips . For a modern prospective, we offer “Connecticut Freight Railroads and the Towns they Serve” and extensive coverage of railroad stations in Connecticut .\n\nNext, we cover specific railroads and towns.

You will also enjoy “Could George Alpert have saved the New Haven?” as well as “What if the New Haven never merged with Penn Central?”\n\n**********\n\nThe New Haven Railroad ran some great passenger trains. The New Haven’s crack train between New York (Grand Central Terminal) and Boston was the last all-parlor-car train in North America, retaining its exclusive all-first-class status until mid-1949. See the Merchants Limited, March 1949 schedule.\n\nThe Pennsylvania and the New Haven combined on this overnight train connecting Boston and Washington, DC via New York. The Federal – April, 1971\n\n**********\n\nBrill gas car #9022 at Millerton station ready to depart for Poughkeepsie as train #917 due out at 7:50am.

It was designated a National Historic Engineering Landmark in 1982 by the ASME and the IEEE. Despite being listed on the National Register of Historic Places and local and national debate, the plant was decommissioned in 1987 and demolished in 2001.\n\n**********\n\nThe two railroad lines serving Canton were – the Collinsville branch of the Canal Line of the New Haven Railroad and the Central New England Railroad.\n\nThe New Haven line went on to New Hartford, where there was a turntable so they could reverse direction. The Central New England (formerly Connecticut and Western) came from Hartford Ct. via Tariffville and Simsbury to the Farmington River in Canton, where it backed down to the station in Collinsville. It then proceeded west through Winsted, Norfolk and Canaan, Ct. to New York State.\n\n**********\n\nOld station at Meriden, Connecticut on the Hartford – New Haven line.\n\n**********\n\nOld Railroads of Connecticut, the Armory Branch between East Hartford and Springfield via East Windsor.\n\nWe have a great section on key dates in Connecticut railroad history and a story with pictures of New Haven railroad bridges along the Shore Line .\n\nYou can find out about the Highland Line between Hartford and Waterbury as well as see many New Haven railroad pictures .

Cedar Hill became in the 1920’s the keystone of the whole New Haven Railroad freight operation. It seems to have started out as a more local facility, then grown into that larger role.
