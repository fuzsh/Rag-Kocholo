        "text": "THE OAK POINT YARDS OF THE NEW HAVEN ROAD\n\nSome impression of the magnitude of the freight traffic interchanged between the New York New Haven & Hartford and the lines terminating in Jersey City may be conveyed by the statement that in addition to the large yard at the Harlem River terminus of the Harlem River branch of the New Haven Road that company has in operation south of New Rochelle two yards with approximately 15 miles of tracks in each, and this year has finished a third yard with no less than 200 miles of tracks.\n\nThe one last mentioned, known as the Oak Point Yard, is situated at Casanova Station, on the East River, about 2 miles from the Harlem River. It may be stated here, for the information of those unfamiliar with the layout, that the Grand Central Station and its approaches are used by the New York New Haven & Hartford for passenger business exclusively. All of that company's freight business originating in, destined to or passing through New York is handled over the Harlem River branch, the southern terminus of which is on the north side of the Harlem, just beyond One Hundred and Twenty-ninth street, New York, while the point of junction with the main line is at New Rochelle, 12 miles from Harlem River and 164 miles from the Grand Central Station.\n\nThe Oak Point Yard is designed primarily as an overflow yard. During the rush of traffic last spring it was brought into use for two or three months, immediately upon its completion. Since that time, business having dropped off, it has remained unoccupied, but available for use whenever needed. No thought of transferring the passenger service carried on by means of the steamer Maryland, which conveys two trains each way daily between the New York New Haven & Hartford and the Pennsylvania, is entertained. In one respect the Harlem River location is preferable, the East River at Oak Point having at flood tide a current of 6 or 8 miles an hour. The East River at this point is open and broad.\n\nFrom the accompanying map, for which the Railway Age is indebted to Mr. C. M. Ingersoll, Jr., Chief Engineer, and Mr. Edward Gagel, Assistant Engineer in charge of the Western district, the arrangement of the yard may be determined at a glance. Mr. W. J. Black, Division Engineer at Harlem River Station, is in immediate charge.\n\nThe broad space intervening the northern and southern wings of the yard is now occupied by a low hill. This may be removed if occasion shall demand, so that ultimately, if necessary, the entire space may be filled with tracks, thus more than doubling the present extent of the yard. The northern wing will be used chiefly for storage, and, to a less extent, for drilling cars received from Jersey City. The outer half of the south wing will be likewise available. At present trains brought to the Harlem River branch from the east are arranged and classified chiefly at the Van Nest Yard, 2Â½ miles east of Casanova. Eastbound cars are arranged for divisions or stations partly at Harlem River and partly at Westchester. The expectation is that Oak Point will supplement the two last named in the particulars specified.\n\nOn the whole, the distinguishing characteristic of the Oak Point arrangement is the number of slip lines introduced. It is said, indeed, that no other yard in the country has so many slips and double slips. The cross-overs just above the bridges are also regarded as an important innovation, particularly by the operating department, inasmuch as by the arrangement here made the transfer floats may be loaded and unloaded simultaneously. In some ways this method is more convenient than at Harlem River.\n\nIn the construction of the bridges, and the works pertaining to them, some unusual features were introduced necessarily, because of the fact that the foundation close under the inner end is solid rock, while at the outer end the channel of the river is some 50 feet deep and piles had to be driven in rip-rap. With this exception no extraordinary difficulty was encountered in the construction of the yard and its appurtenances. The precise arrangement adopted is due in some measure to the fact that lack of room east of Leggett Avenue compelled the close contraction of the throat of the yard that is indicated in the plan.\n\nThe Railway Age - Volume 30\n\nAugust 26, 1900"
