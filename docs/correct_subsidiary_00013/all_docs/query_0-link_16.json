        "text": "Scope and Content:\n\nConsists of reports, legislation, and hearings related to the bankruptcy and reorganization of select railroad lines, most of which Langdon played a major role. Subseries A comprises a series of preliminary reports from the 1930s and 1940s and covers regulations and law related to major freight carriers throughout the United States, as well as reports on the status and trends of various industries crucial to the success of motor, water, and rail freight carriers. Contained in Subseries B is a smaller amount of material dealing with the ICC's reorganization plan for the Erie Railroad in 1940. Langdon’s involvement with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad is documented in Subseries C, and includes testimony, ICC dockets, and other material related to the prospective merger of Rock Island with the Union Pacific and the former’s potential to develop into a profitable line. There is also correspondence between Langdon and Maury Klein, a Hagley fellow, regarding the Rock Island non-merger. Subseries D consists of material from Langdon’s effort to revitalize the bankrupt Penn Central Transportation Company (Penn Central). These include prospective reports, Langdon’s deposition regarding the company’s valuation and reorganization, as well as testimony from the valuation proceedings. Some maps are included and highlight lines to be acquired by Penn Central and other carriers. There are also several reports discussing Penn Central’s reorganization and the need for extensive financial existence from the government. Lastly, Subseries E contains reports touching on the problems of the Conrail organization, including inventory, its financial situation, and performance reviews. Other reports cover Conrail’s profitability, freight statistics, and operational comparisons with other freight carriers.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) was incorporated in October 1974. It was formed under the auspices of the United States Railway Association, a quasi-public agency established for the purpose of solving the problems of bankrupt railroads in the Northeast and Midwest. The Conrail photograph collection consists of a large number of images from its company files, but the majority of the material comes from its predecessor companies: Pennsylvania Railroad and Penn Central Transportation Company. These items are predominanatly composed of photographs, negatives, transparencies, lantern slides, and films.\n\nAbstract:\n\nDavid Crumley Bevan (1906-1996) was the Chief Financial Officer of the Penn Central Transportation Company during its financial collapse in the early 1970s, the result of a poorly planned merger between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the New York Central Railroad Company in 1968. The papers document the initial bankruptcy of Penn Central in 1970 and the proceeding court cases against both the company and David Bevan personally, who was accused and later acquitted of financial mismanagement.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Pennsylvania New York Central Transportation Company was the creation of a 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads. In 1970, the \"Penn Central\" Transportation Company filed for bankruptcy and auctioned off Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad memorabilia, pictures, and other materials. This collection consists of a poster for the auction of Penn Central railroad memorabilia. The poster includes images of lanterns and a locomotive, both in black, on brown paper with text announcing dates for auction and preview."
