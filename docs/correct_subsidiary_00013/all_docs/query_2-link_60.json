        "text": "Details\n\n521.29 cubic feet + 24 microfilm reels, 1 microfilm index, 527 ledgers\n\nThis collection includes records from eight record groups, which are not reflected in the current arrangement: 1. Pennsylvania Railroad; 2. New York Central Railroad; 3. Penn Central Transportation Company; 4. Clearfield Bituminous Coal Corporation; 5. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad; 6. Union Depot of Columbus; 7. Bethlehem Steel Corporation; 8. Pennsylvania Company\n\nThe content of the records in the collection reflects the history of the middle years of the two dominant companies. The surviving New York Central records consist mostly of minute books, accounting records and annual reports. The records of the former Pennsylvania Railroad contain correspondence, location files and maps, plans and drawings, as well as accounting records, annual reports and minute books. Non-rail properties of the Pennsylvania Railroad found in the collection include ferry companies, Northwestern Coal & Iron, the Pittsburgh Provision Company and subsidiaries and the Pittsburgh Joint Stock Yards Co. The New York Central's non-rail properties include the Dixon Run Land Company and several coal and coke companies. Some of the Clearfield Bituminous Coal and Clearfield Supply Company records are also included in the New York Central holdings\n\nIncorporated in 1846, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company (PRR) began as a single-track railroad between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In 1857 the PRR acquired multiple lines from Chicago through Pennsylvania, expanding quickly to 800 subsidiary companies. In terms of capital and trackage, the PRR was well-situated for its imminent task of mobilizing troops, munitions, and supplies during the Civil War. Following the Panic of 1873, a series of wage cuts at the Pennsylvania, New York Central, and other railroads precipitated a violent outbreak of strikes in the summer of 1877, the most hostile of which were directed at the PRR in Pittsburgh. Stone-throwing mobs supporting workers formed in Altoona, Johnstown, and Harrisburg while looting, destruction, injury, and death continued in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Previous to binding arbitration, this labor dispute ended with a strengthening of the Knights of Labor for workers, the enlargement of federal forces, and a strengthening of laws controlling the disruption of commerce by labor. In 1910, the first tunnel under the Hudson River allowed the PRR Railroad to establish a new terminal in New York City. Pennsylvania Station was, at the time of its completion, reputed to be the world's busiest train station\n\nFounded in July of 1853 as a consolidation of ten small railroads, the New York Central Railroad Company later merged with the Hudson River Railroad, forming the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company in 1869. Its creator, Erastus Corning, served as president until 1864. Under the leadership of Cornelius Vanderbilt, ten thousand miles of track connected New York with Boston, Chicago, Montreal, and St. Louis as the railroad grew to acquire more than 600 subsidiaries. The New York Central began to languish after World War II. After a lengthy legal dispute that reached the Supreme Court, the PRR and the New York Penn Central Railroad, former business rivals, merged in 1968 to create the Penn Central Transportation Company. The Penn Central Company acquired the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad in 1969, but filed for bankruptcy two years later. A new national passenger rail service, Amtrak, was formed in the same year, 1971, followed by the establishment of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) in 1976. Shortly thereafter, the Penn Central became a holding company composed primarily of energy, electronics, manufacturing, and real estate subsidiaries\n\nIn Historical Collections and Labor Archives, University Libraries, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pa.
