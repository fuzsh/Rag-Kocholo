Several of these are just paper railroads which are owned by another class 1 railroad. Until 1967 Texas had a law that any railroad operating there had to be headquartered in the State. I have included several other railroads (without numbers) for various reasons.\n\nOne benefit of having 127 class 1 railroads in the 48 contiguous States was that most of the States had their own interesting list of class 1s.\n\nClass 1 Railroads operating in each State during 1950-\n\nAlabama- AGS, ASAB, ACL, CG, GMO, IC, LN, NC, SLSF, SAL, SOU, WA\n\nArizona- ATSF, SP\n\nArkansas- RI, IC, KCS, LA, MV, MP, SLSF, SSW, TP\n\nCalifornia- ATSF, GN, NWP, SN, SP, UP, WP\n\nColorado- ATSF, CBQ, RI, CS, CW, DRGW, MP, UP\n\nConnecticut- CV, NH\n\nDelaware- BO, PRR, RDG\n\nFlorida- ASAB, ACL, FEC, GF, GSF, LN, SLSF, SAL, SOU\n\nGeorgia- AWP, ACL, CG, CWC, GA, GF, GSF, LN, NC, SAL, SOU, WA\n\nIdaho- MILW, GN, NP, SI, UP\n\nIllinois- ATSF, BO, CO, CEI, CIM, CNW, CBQ, CGW, CIL, MILW, RI, EJE, ERIE,\n\n....GTW, GMO, IC, ITC, LN, MSTL, SOO, MP, MI, NYC, NKP, PRR, SSW, SOU\n\n....TPW, WAB, WC\n\nIndiana- BO, CO, CEI, CIL, MILW, EJE, ERIE, GTW, IC, LN, NYC, NKP, PRR, SOU, WAB\n\nIowa- ATSF, CNW, CBQ, CGW, MILW, RI, CMO, GN, IC, MSTL, TPW, UP, WAB\n\nKansas- ATSF, CBQ, CGW, RI, KCS, KOG, MV, MKT, MP, SLSF, UP\n\nKentucky- BO, CO, CBQ, CIL, CNTP, CRR, GMO, IC, LN, NC, NYC, NW, PRR, SOU, TC\n\nLouisiana- ATSF, RI, GMO, IC, KCS, LA, LN, MP, NONE, SSW, SOU, SP, TNO, TP\n\nMaine- BAR, BM, CN, CP, MEC\n\nMaryland- BO, NW, PRR, WM\n\nMassachusetts- BM, CV, NYC, NH\n\nMichigan- AA, BO, CO, CNW, MILW, DM, DTS, DTI, DSA, GTW, LSI, SOO, NYC,\n\n....PRR, WAB, WC\n\nMinnesota- CNW, CBQ, CGW, MILW, RI, CMO, DMIR, DWP, DSA, GN, GBW, IC,\n\n....MSTL, SOO, NP, WC\n\nMississippi- AGS, C&G, GMO, IC, LN, MSC, MP, NONE, SLSF, SOU\n\nMissouri- ATSF, BO, CEI, CBQ, CGW, MILW, RI, GMO, IC, ITC, KCS, LN, MKT, MP,\n\n....MI, NYC, NKP, PRR, SLSF, SSW, SOU, UP, WAB\n\nMontana- CBQ, MILW, GN, SOO, NP, UP\n\nNebraska- ATSF, CNW, CBQ, CGW, MILW, RI, CMO, IC, MP, UP, WAB\n\nNevada- SP, UP, WP\n\nNew Hampshire- BM, CN, CV, MEC\n\nNew Jersey- BO, CNJ, DLW, ERIE, LHR, LNE, LV, NYC, OW, NYSW, PRR, PRSL, RDG, SIR\n\nNew Mexico- ATSF, RI, CS, DRGW, SP, TP\n\nNew York- BO, BM, CV, CO, DH, DLW, ERIE, LHR, LNE, LV, LI, NYC, NKP, NYCN, NH,\n\n....OW, PRR, RUT, SIR, WAB\n\nNorth Carolina- ACL, CRR, LN, NW, NS, SAL, SOU\n\nNorth Dakota- CNW, MILW, GN, SOO, NP\n\nOhio- ACY, AA, BO, BLE, CO, CNTP, DTS, DTI, ERIE, LN, NYC, NKP, NW, PRR, PLE,\n\n....PWV, WAB\n\nOklahoma- ATSF, RI, KCS, KOG, MV, MKT, MP, OCAA, SLSF\n\nOregon- GN, NP, SP, SPS, UP\n\nPennsylvania- BO, BLE, CI, CNJ, DH, DLW, ERIE, LHR, LNE, LV, MGA, MTR, NYC\n\n....NKP, OW, PRR, PS, PLE, PWV, RDG, WM\n\nRhode Island- NH\n\nSouth Carolina- ACL, CWC, CRR, GF, SAL, SOU\n\nSouth Dakota- CNW, CBQ, MILW, RI, CMO, GN, IC, MSTL, SOO\n\nTennessee- AGS, CG, RI, CNTP, CRR, GMO, IC, LN, MP, NC, SLSF, SSW, SOU, TC\n\nTexas- ATSF, BSLW, RI, FWD, IGN, KCS, KOG, LA, MKT, MP, NOTM, SLBW, SLSF\n\n....SSW, SAUG, SP, TNO, T&N, TP, TM\n\nUtah- DRGW, SP, UP, UTAH, WP\n\nVermont- BM, CN, CP, CV, DH, MEC, RUT\n\nVirginia- AD, ACL, BO, CO, CRR, LN, NW, NS, PRR, RFP, SAL, SOU, VGN\n\nWashington- MILW, GN, NP, SI, SPS, UP\n\nWest Virginia- BO, CO, MGA, NYC, NKP, NW, PRR, PWV, VGN, WM\n\nWisconsin- AA, CO, CNW, CBQ, MILW, CMO, DMIR, DSA, GTW, GN, GBW, IC, SOO\n\n....NP, WC\n\nWyoming- CNW, CBQ, CS, CW, UP\n\nDist of Col.- BO, CO, PRR, RFP, SOU\n\nMileage, total operating revenue, revenue ton-miles, and number of locomotives (diesel,steam,electric) are based on 1950.\n\n1-Akron, Canton and Youngstown - ACY\n\n171 miles, $5,051,782 tor, 282,730,000 rtm, 18 (7d,11s).\n\nStates served- OH\n\nFrom theClassic Trains Magazine website-\n\nAkron, Canton & Youngstown incorporated in 1907, completed its line in 1913.

The Southern also owned the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific running north from Chattanooga, and the New Orleans and Northeastern, between Meridian and New Orleans. Together the 3 class 1 subsidiaries connected Cincinnati and New Orleans, a route still important to Norfolk Southern today.\n\nx-Alton, 959 miles, became part of GM&O in 1947.\n\nStates served- IL, MO\n\nFrom the Classic Trains Magazine website-\n\nAlton & Sangamon chartered in 1847, renamed St. Louis, Alton & Chicago in 1850's. Chicago & Alton organized in 1861 to buy StLA&C. C&A controlled by Union Pacific and Rock Island 1904-07, then Clover Leaf 1907-1912. C&A entered receivership and was bought by Baltimore & Ohio in 1929, renamed Alton Railroad in 1931, restored to independence March 10, 1943, and acquired by Gulf, Mobile & Ohio May 31, 1947.\n\nThe Gulf, Mobile and Ohio merged with Illinois Central during 1972 to form Illinois\n\nCentral Gulf. ICG realized it had too much track, and began selling their non-core lines. The former Alton lines were sold off on May 17, 1987, creating the Chicago, Missouri and Western. The CM&W went bankrupt, and Southern Pacific bought the St. Louis to Chicago line, now part of Union Pacific. The line to Kansas City became the Gateway Western, now part of Kansas City Southern.\n\n3-Ann Arbor - AA\n\n294 miles, $9,400,000 tor, 636,189,000 rtm, 46 (23d,23s).\n\nStates served- MI, OH, WI\n\nFrom the Classic Trains Magazine website-\n\nAnn Arbor's first ancestor dated from 1869.

The State of Michigan bought AA from DT&I, and designated Michigan Interstate as operator October 1, 1977. Operation split in 1983 among MI on south end, Tuscola & Saginaw Bay in middle, and Michigan Northern on north end. T&SB took over MN in 1984. Ann Arbor Railroad, established October 7, 1988, runs Toledo-Ann Arbor.\n\nFallenFlags Photos\n\n4-Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe - ATSF\n\n13,073 miles (longest in USA 1950),$522,675,610 tor, 29,800,000,000 rtm, 2,022(967d,1,055s).\n\nStates served- AZ, CA, CO, IL, IA, KS, LA, MO, NE, NM, OK, TX\n\nFrom the Classic Trains Magazine website-\n\nChartered in 1859 as the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe.
