Later, these special reporting marks were not used, and the reporting marks \"PC\" were used as before for these railroad cars.\n\n\"TOC\" was also used as a reporting mark on PC-painted equipment (box cars and some cabooses), and stood for Toledo & Ohio Central, that actually was an NYC subsidiary that was merged into the NYC in the 1950's. Decades later, PC revived the TOC reporting marks basically more for tax purposes.\n\nPC Paint Schemes Info (Click Here)\n\nThe PC Logo Information (Click Here)\n\nPC Locomotive Info (Click Here)\n\nClick Here for a NEW PC-Related Discussion Forum (For your needed PC-related info and questions)\n\nPC Pictures (Click Here)\n\nFor Further Details About the PC (Click Here)\n\nBack To PC Home Page (Click Here)\n\nSubmitting Material (Click Here)\n\n(This site is updated on an irregular basis and whenever possible.)\n\nÂ©2001-2009-2016 pcrrusa; All Rights Reserved.
