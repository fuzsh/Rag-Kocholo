It may have property, p[ossible, as an intellectual or maybe even physical in nature that will have on going value to others. The SPRINT system of former Southern Pacific ownership is a case in point.\n\nSome of the discussions on the posted-linked Thread so how property as well can become under some circumstances, a legal football as well. So the Case for Penn Central still existing, in-part, as an entity owning Real Estate, could be a case in point.\n\nBecause the corporate entity is no longer a railroad, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I've read that some of the other railroads that went into Conrail, after selling their railroad assets and being released from bankruptcy continued as corporate entities. They no longer were operating railroads and may have changed their names. Some still had real estate holdings that wasn't conveyed to Conrail, plus at the time there were tax credits from past years where they had lost money that they could use to offset any future earnings.\n\nThe Rock Island's corporate structure continued after the railroad quit operating. In 1984 it came out of bankruptcy as the Chicago Pacific Corporation. After paying off their creditors there was cash and assets (including the tax credits from the years of losses) and they became a holding company. Eventually being merged into Maytag, who wanted the home appliance companies C-P Corp had acquired.\n\nJeff\n\nFrom Wikipedia-( In short Reading is a movie theater company)\n\nPost-railroad: 1976-present\n\nOn April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail), leaving it with 650 real estate assets, some coal properties, and 52 abandoned rights-of-way. As of 1999, most former Reading lines are now part of Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), as a result of the Conrail split between NS and CSX Transportation. It had sold 350 of the real estate tracts by the time it left bankruptcy in 1980.\n\nIn the late 1980s a Los Angeles lawyer named James Cotter gained control of the corporation through his holding company, the Craig Corporation, and liquidated the rest of its assets to finance his cinema chains in Puerto Rico, Australia and New Zealand. The company sold one of its last railroad-related asset, the Reading Terminal Headhouse, in 1991. In 1996, Cotter reorganized the company as Reading Entertainment. The Craig Corporation merged in 2001 with Citadel Holding Corporation, another Cotter company, and became Reading International, Inc. RDI still ownes 317 acres of former railroad property, mostly in upper Pennsylvania, along with the Reading Railroad publicity files of approximately 300-600 lin. feet (as of 2011).\n\nMost of Reading Entertainment's operations are in Australia, New Zealand, and United States under the Reading Cinemas trade name. [17]Its logo is a railroad transforming into a film strip the logo depicts a railroad transforming into a filmstrip to tell the story of the history of the brand.\n\nLos Angeles company-based Pacific Theatres decided to sell 15 of the 29 theaters operated by Pacific Theatres Exhibition Corp. and its affiliates, comprising 181 screens in Hawaii and throughout California, outside of Los Angeles, as Pacific wanted to become an exclusive entertainment company primarily in Los Angeles. Reading International had interest in purchasing these theatres in late 2007, finally coming to an agreement in finalizing the purchase February 22, 2008. These theaters reportedly generate around $80 million in revenue annually. Nine of the theaters, comprising 98 screens, are located in Hawaii and operate under the Consolidated Theatres brand name and represented nearly 70% of the Hawaiian box office receipts reported in 2007. Six theaters, comprising 83 screens, in San Diego, Bakersfield, and Rohnert Park California, operated as Pacific Theatres have been converted to the Reading Cinema brand name. Reading's purchase was financed principally by a combination of debt financing from GE Capital Corporation and seller financing. During 2009 and 2010, much of the seller financing was forgiven as part of contingent purchase price adjustment terms and tests in the original purchase agreement.\n\nIn October 2008, Reading Entertainment and Screenvision entered into a long-term contract to provide digital, satellite-based pre show to all Reading Cinemas locations in the United States. Replacing traditional slide show presentation, the digital preshow by Screenvision would cover advertisements from television shows such as: E! Entertainment, ABC Family. and MTV, upcoming films, and business advertisements such as: Verizon Wireless, Dodge, and National Guard, pending on the movie's MPAA rating. The digital preshow would also cover local businesses who purchase time on the pre show.[18] All Reading Cinemas locations in the United States officially began the digital preshow December 2008.\n\nReading Cinemas began installing digital projection in 4 of its theatres in the United States using DLP projection technology. These projectors are also capable of showing Digital 3-D presentations. Per Reading's 2009 10-K filing: By mid-year (2010), it anticipates Reading will have 3D projectors in not less than 28 out of the 53 cinema locations that it either wholly owns or consolidates.[19]"
