Shaun Livingston is joining the Warriors as director of player affairs and engagement, a league source confirmed to the Bay Area News Group.

Livingston, 35, had long been interested in a potential front office role with the Warriors. In his role, he will mentor players in their careers off the court and help serve as a line of communication between players and the front office. His duties will also include scouting and other basketball operations matters, and will report directly to general manager Bob Myers.

“Shaun is the epitome of class and professionalism and is everything you’d want in a teammate, both on the court and off,” Myers said in a statement. “What he helped us accomplish in his five years with the organization pales in comparison to who he is as a human being, and we can’t wait to work with him again in another capacity as a part of our basketball staff.”

As The Athletic was first reported, Livingston becomes the highest ranking African American in the Warriors’ front office since Mitch Richmond served as director of player personnel in 2008.

Last summer, Livingston retired after a 15-year NBA career in which he played for nine teams after being drafted No. 4 overall in the 2004 draft out of Peoria Central High School in Illinois. In 2007, his career was nearly ended by a left knee injury that required reconstructive surgery. Several years later, he resuscitated his career with the Brooklyn Nets. Then in 2014, he signed a three-year, $16 million contract with the Warriors.

In five seasons in Golden State, Livingston played a key role for teams that made five straight Finals appearances and won three championships. During his time, he earned the reputation as a respected voice and steadying presence in the locker room.
