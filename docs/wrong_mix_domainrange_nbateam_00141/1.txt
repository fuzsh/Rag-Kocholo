While Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant was on his way to a 60-point night in the final game of his career, even the Warriors couldn t turn away from going on despite their games being played at the same time Wednesday.

Man, I was checking his stats at halftime, at halftime of our game, Warriors guard Shaun Livingston told ESPN Peoria on Thursday. I mean, seriously. It was that serious. I had to know. Kobe, he s the greatest player that I ever faced. He s the hardest player that I ever had to guard. I m not ashamed to say that he gave us (Los Angeles Clippers in a 2006 game) 50, and I took the majority of that 50.

Just knowing the type of competitor he is, I mean, he s the closest thing I think that we ll ever see to Michael Jordan, and he is our generation s Michael Jordan. What he was able to with the game of basketball and how he was able to evolutionize the game for the new generation and for the kids is truly amazing. And it s truly an honor to be able to face him for the 11, 12 years that I had in the NBA. So shoutout to Kobe Bryant, and Mamba Day, and what a way to go out with 60 points.

Both teams went on to attention-getting wins, with Bryant going out in style and the Warriors winning their NBA-record 73rd of the season.
