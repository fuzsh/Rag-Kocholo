Shaun Livingston has been a solid point guard for the Nets this season and he has looked even better of late as the Nets have gotten hot — in his last 5 games he has averaged 11.8 points on 53 percent shooting, plus dishing out four assists a game. He is a quality veteran backup point guard now. Which considering the injury ravaged start to his career — his 2007 knee injury was as bad as you will ever see — and the long road back it is a great accomplishment to be at this level (and a lot of people around the league are rooting for him).

That quality play is going to get him a nice payday as a free agent this summer, a number of teams will be interested.

And those teams will offer more money than the Nets can — Brooklyn is hamstrung by being so far over the salary cap.

Which means Livingston could bolt this summer, something he hinted at in an interview with the New York Daily News.

It sounds like Livingston isn’t going to bolt Brooklyn for just a few more dollars. But what if a team under the tax line offers the full regular mid-level exception — four years and $21.2 million (estimated)? Or even three years and nearly $16 million?

That’s a lot of money to leave on the table.

This is what Brooklyn has really done with their utter disregard for the luxury tax system — it’s not just the tax money, it’s that once you pay the tax the rules restrict what you can offer free agents. Even your own free agents.

It’s going to make it hard for Brooklyn to keep bringing in players. For years. Because remember in the 2015-16 season Joe Johnson and Deron Williams alone will make nearly $46 million, and the summer before is when Brook Lopez can opt out and try to get a max deal. Brooklyn has some cap challenges in its future to say the least.

Livingston is just the first wave of this.
