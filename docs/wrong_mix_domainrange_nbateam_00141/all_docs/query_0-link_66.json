        "text": "I've been meaning to get this posted for a long time now, so please forgive my lazy ass. Dariusz Ejkiewicz, known to a wider crowd since 2001 as Fartman and the very same dude who brought us the legendary 82 nights of Destruction a few months back, has delivered again. This time, Morris Peterson takes […]\n\nI'm sure Ron'll get it up in the headlines to the right soon, but I decided I wanted to put it here too. Chris Paul is the Western Conference Player of the Month as he ballhawks his way towards a historical season. He's also #4 in the NBA.com Race to the MVP.\n\nHolidays for me mean a big backlog of work – so forgive me if I don't give my usual game preview today. Here's some key stuff about the Hornets game at the Clippers tonight: Elton Brand(Ruptured Achilles), Shaun Livingston(Ruptured Knee), Sam Cassell(Various Geriatric disorders), and Tim Thomas(Soft Loser) are all out/or have been out this season. As a […]\n\nI'm gonna take a pass on the usual game flow notes today, and just jump straight to crunch time of Hornets-Raptors last night. After Chris Paul uncharacteristically missed two free throws that would have put the Hornets up one with 25 seconds left, the Raps grabbed the board and called timeout. They inbound in the […]\n\nI'll now take a break from my Chris Paul worship and give you a game preview for tonight. Here we go: Game Preview!Matchup: Raptors(16-15) vs. Hornets(20-10)Relevant Blogger: Raptors HQ The Raptors come to New Orleans for a New Years day game, having somehow managed to lose to Houston two days ago after beating San Antonio […]\n\nWe've received a request from the Golden State of Mind Blog to answer some questions of theirs about our team in preparation for our upcoming January 4th game against the Warriors. Since one of the questions, inevitably, was about Chris Paul and Baron Davis, I've decided to post here an piece I did back in September on The Hornets […]\n\nComing into the game yesterday, the Hornets had a nice-but-flawed winning streak going on. Sure, we'd won four straight by an average of 20 points, but those opponents had the combined winning percentage of Tim Floyd: NBA Edition. Then along came the Cleveland Cavaliers. True, they've got a losing record, too, but they had just […]\n\nBam! Make it a four-game winning streak, and we just sneaked ahead of Dallas in the standings. Yup, the Hornets done beat the Bobcats on this fine evening, and not even an NBA TV blackout in New Orleans could ruin it for me. Here's the usual dose of notes regarding said game of splendid basketball… […]\n\nI must be feeling ambitious today, so have a second post! If you want the game preview, scroll down, then come back and read this one. Do it for the children. And Chris Paul. A lot has been written about Chris Paul over the last few weeks as he's become a favorite target for stat-focused […]\n\nGAME PREVIEW! Matchup: Hornets(18-10) @ Bobcats(10-16)Opposing Blogger: Queen City Hoops or Bobcats Bonfire The Hornets roll into their old home in Charlotte tonight to see if they can put down some Bobcats before being forced to rush back home and defend New Orleans from some Cavalier invaders and their so-called King. The unfortunate Cats were declawed from […]\n\nWhoo! Damn that was an impressive win last night. I'm late writing this thing up because a couple bars got in my way coming home from Cooter Brown's last night. Those folks have League Pass and threw the game on a big screen for me and Mikey SeasonTickets. Add to that an alligator sausage po-boy […]\n\nI'm fat and sleepy right now, having had a very nice Christmas, but I'm still going to do my duty and produce something for you to read prior to the game tomorrow. But ya'll owe me, alright? GAME PREVIEW! Matchup: Hornets (17-10) @ Grizzlies (8-19) Opposing Blogger(and personal favorite): 3 Shades of Blue (Their Preview) To […]\n\nTwas three nights before Christmas, and all through New Orleans Arena, the Hornets kicked ass. Oh yeah, our guys took care of business last night, crucifying the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 110-76 (box | recap). I was in the building with a pen and a pad and one of my better shirts. Here's how it all […]\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves roll into New Orleans today with their league-worst 4-21 record. Our 16-10 Hornets will be waiting, as they try to build on their demolition of the Sonics in Seattle on Wednesday. Today's game really should be another easy one for the Hornets, but then the T-Wolves have already beaten us up in […]\n\nYeah, the Sonic's announcers said that last night. Brings to mind fluffy bunnies, green meadows, and open skies, not Tyson slamming home three alley-oop jams in a five minute stretch or out-rebounding the three Sonics Big Men(16 total rebounds) by himself(17 rebounds). Anyways, I told Ron I'd do a game recap, and that I'd try to do something […]\n\nLet's face it, our bench sucks. While the second unit continues to be excellent defensively, anyone who watches the Hornets can tell they just can't score. Armstrong, Wright, Butler, Jackson and Pargo score 1 point for every 1.2 points the opposing team scores. That's obviously not supportable. So I spent about an hour last night […]\n\nThe Hornets were in Portland last night, and as expected, Peja Stojakovic sits out once again with that groin strain. I guess it's a good sign though that he's on this road trip. The Hornets start with the same five as they did for Phoenix: Chris Paul, Morris Peterson, Rasual Butler, David West and Tyson […]\n\nAlright, I'm doing another game preview, but I suppose I should warn you. I went back and took a look at the last game preview I wrote for a Hornets v Portland game(on Nov 2nd), and it had some great gems like these: \"Peja, however, is not inconsistent\"\"Julian Wright should play, and I'm sure he'll […]\n\nBeer: $1Water: $3 That was the price list at the pregame BuzzFest yesterday, and the evening only got crazier from there. The BuzzFest delivered that same party atmosphere outside the Arena, something methinks I could never tire of. There was a dude on stilts dancing with random people, dozens of kids descending on a toppled […]\n\nDammit, that game sucked. Not only did we get beat 80-89 by the Mavericks, but pretty much everyone played like a dog and Peja Stojakovic aggravated that groin strain again. It doesn't look good for Phoenix tomorrow. But before we look too far ahead, let me revisit the misery of today's game… First Quarter It […]"
