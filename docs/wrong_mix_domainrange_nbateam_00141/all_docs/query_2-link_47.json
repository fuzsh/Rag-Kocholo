        "text": "Two of the four major free agents will return for the reigning champions.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have agreed to sign point guard Shaun Livingston to a three-year, $24-million contract, sources told Jon Krawczynski of the Associated Press.\n\nThe first two years of the contract are fully guaranteed at $8 million, but the third year is only partially guaranteed for $2 million, a source told ESPN's Zach Lowe.\n\nLivingston will return as a backup for Stephen Curry, who reportedly inked a five-year, $201-million contract to stay in Golden State. Kevin Durant is also widely expected to re-sign.\n\nThe 31-year-old Livingston likely took a discount to remain with the best organization in basketball. Nevertheless, his deal puts a dent in Golden State's available funds for Andre Iguodala, who is reportedly taking free-agency meetings with other teams before deciding on his future with the Warriors.\n\nLivingston averaged 5.1 points and 1.8 assists last season as a low-usage floor general while continuing to serve as a dynamic and versatile defender."
