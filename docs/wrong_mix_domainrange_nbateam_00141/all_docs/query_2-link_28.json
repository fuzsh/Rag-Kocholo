        "text": "PEORIA — Shaun Livingston took center stage Saturday and talked about his family, the influence his late grandfather had on him as a kid, and the impact growing up with Manual and Central basketball had on him.\n\nThe 36-year-old Peoria native talked about a life worth celebrating, built in the time between way back when and his induction Saturday into the Greater Peoria Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nAnd something else.\n\n\"A legacy,\" Livingston said. \"This induction tonight is important to me because it's about building a legacy for my kids to see, and leaving a path for others to follow. The time that we all have is limited. Our greatest resource is the younger generations. Hopefully they have more time, more potential than we have.\n\n\"So you try to provide those opportunities for them where you can. And hopefully, provide some inspiration and some hope they can do great things themselves.\"\n\nRelated: NBA's Shaun Livingston leads Greater Peoria Sports Hall of Fame class for 2021\n\nThe three-time NBA champion and Peoria High School graduate was the headliner at the GPSHOF induction banquet at the Peoria Civic Center ballroom.\n\nHe was joined by fellow inductees Jerry Rashid, Eric \"Sheik\" Monti, Rick LeHew, Zach Glavash, Jeff Simons and Fred Miller. Team inductees included 1975 Princeville football, 1983 Washington football and 1985 Limestone softball.\n\nAlso honored were Shawn Stever (Neve Harms Award for Meritorious Service to Sports), Lauren Doerr (Female Athlete of the Year), Seth Glatz (Male Athlete of the Year), Lindsey Lox (Female Coach of the Year) and Brett Charlton (Male Coach of the Year).\n\n\"It's about family and all the people here tonight, it will be fun,\" Livingston said ahead of a banquet in which he drew a standing ovation from about 400 spectators. \"For me, being inducted is more about my family, people who helped me get here in my journey. We don't always think this way, but nobody gets to where they are at by themselves. It's just impossible. This is a special night for my family, for all my loved ones.\"\n\nRemembering his late grandfather\n\nLivingston was there with his wife, Joanna, and his children Tyson, 5, and Jonah, 3. His father, Reggie, was on hand, too.\n\nHis grandfather, Frank, died in December, but left a lasting impression on Livingston.\n\n\"My grandfather was a Marine and the pillar of our family,\" Livingston said. \"Somebody who was rock solid that I could rely on. He kept me grounded. He was solid and unbiased, which is hard to do.\n\n\"He always had these one-liners he'd take from people he read about — he liked to read a lot — and he had one that really stuck with me: 'You don't know what you don't know.'\n\n\"The smartest people I've met understand that.\"\n\nFrank Livingston was something else, too: Honest with his grandson, and unfazed by his growing success and fame.\n\n\"He was there to support me, never got caught up in the hype and all the glory and fame ... the lights,\" Livingston said. \"He treated me with respect and I always respected him because he just never got caught up in the whirlwind. I could rely on him to be honest and give me the truth.\n\n\"His legacy and one-liners and our talks and conversations continue to live on, his principles live on with me and I'll do the same to instill them with my kids.\"\n\nMore coverage: Why NBA champion and Peoria native Shaun Livingston cherishes his annual basketball camp\n\nThe growth of a champion\n\nLivingston, meanwhile, knew at a young age what path he wanted to follow. He drew inspiration and guidance from coaches, teachers and teammates. He sang in the Trinity Lutheran Church choir, played basketball pick-up games with the church elders and inherited a cross from the church's Rev. Gerald Freudenburg after his death.\n\nAnd he was riveted by Manual and Central basketball teams.\n\n\"In my dad's era they had some hoopers, Tony Wysinger, a playground legend named GG, Kenny Drummond who they called 'The Fox,' \" Livingston said. \"In my era, Howard Nathan, widely considered the greatest player to come out of Peoria, if not the greatest and someone we all looked up to. Willie Coleman, Ivan Watson, Frank Williams, Sergio McClain, AJ Guyton, Mike Hughes, Chris Reynolds, all those great Central and Manual teams and the pride and heart and effort they had, the skill.\n\n\"Those were legacy teams, they rubbed off on a generation after them. They really created a fertile basketball ground for Peoria.\n\n\"And it drew me into the game.\"\n\nLivingston went on star at Peoria High School, and went right to the NBA as the fourth overall pick of the Los Angeles Clippers in 2004. He played 833 NBA games over parts of 14 seasons, overcame a brutal knee injury, and was part of the Golden State Warriors championships in 2015, 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe generosity of a champion\n\nAll the while, Livingston never forgot where he came from.\n\nHe formed the Shaun Livingston Foundation, a non-profit organization he says is his passion.\n\nHe provided the weight room at his high school alma mater and donated $1 million to a capital fund that built Concordia's gym.\n\nHe provides free basketball camps to over 300 youth in the area every summer. He also awards scholarships for less privileged minority students to attend Concordia, where he went to school.\n\nLivingston has teamed with the Peoria African-American Police League to sponsor a bicycle ride to encourage positive police interaction. He provides Thanksgiving meals and Christmas gifts to deserving families.\n\n\"I tell people everywhere I go how proud Peorians are of what they accomplish here and provide for their families,\" Livingston said. \"Playing on the Warriors, being in the NBA in general, I always liked coming back home and letting kids see me, approach me, look me in the eyes and have a conversation. It feels more real. It's about providing a platform for them from which they can achieve great things.\n\n\"It's important. It means a lot. It's less about me and more about them. I'm so honored to go into this Hall of Fame. But it's an opportunity for me to thank everyone and acknowledge them. I feel like one of the lucky ones to be able to figure out it's about service to others.\n\n\"That's the biggest impact we can have.\"\n\nDave Eminian is the Journal Star sports columnist, and covers Bradley men's basketball, the Rivermen and Chiefs.
