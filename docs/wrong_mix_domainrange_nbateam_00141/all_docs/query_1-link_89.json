        "text": "The Associated Press\n\nThe way Peja Stojakovic was hitting 3-pointers and Chris Paul was passing the ball, the New Orleans Hornets made scoring look easy.\n\nStojakovic made a franchise-record 10 3s, and Chris Paul established another team mark with 21 assists Tuesday night in New Orleans’ 118-104 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n“The way he shot the ball tonight was unbelievable. When he’s lights out like that, you’ve got to give him the ball,” said Paul, who also scored 19 points. “When you’ve got shooters like that and Tyson (Chandler) rolling to the rim, it makes my job so much easier.\n\nThe win improved the Hornets to 4-0, matching last season’s franchise-best start.\n\nStojakovic missed just three of 13 shots from behind the arc and finished with 36 points. His 3-point bonanza rewrote the Hornets’ record of eight, set by David Wesley in 2002. Only three guys in NBA history have hit more 3s in a game.\n\n“I got most of my shots in transition. Later on, they had to help on Chris playing pick-and-roll with David (West) and Tyson (Chandler), and somehow I was wide open. The guys were looking for me, particularly Chris.”\n\nPaul bested the former team mark for assists, which was 19 by Muggsy Bogues in 1989.\n\nKobe Bryant had 28 points for the Lakers, taking just 20 shots and making 11 of them. He also had seven assists and\n\nsix rebounds. Ronny Turiaf had 15 points and seven rebounds, and Andrew Bynum had 13 rebounds.\n\nKNICKS 119, NUGGETS 112\n\nAt New York, Zach Randolph had 22 points and 17 rebounds, three other players scored more than 20 points, and New York erased a series of double-digit deficits to win in Denver’s first trip to Madison Square Garden since last year’s brawl.\n\nJamal Crawford led the Knicks with 25 points and Eddy Curry added 24, nine in the fourth quarter. Stephon Marbury had 21 and nine assists.\n\nAllen Iverson scored 32 points and Carmelo Anthony had 24 for the Nuggets, who led by as many as 15 and were still ahead by 10 going to the fourth quarter.\n\nROCKETS 89, SPURS 81\n\nAt Houston, Yao Ming had 28 points and 13 rebounds to help Houston snap a four-game, home-court losing streak to San Antonio.\n\nBonzi Wells added 14 points and 15 rebounds for the Rockets, who controlled Tim Duncan and outrebounded the Spurs 55-28. Duncan had 14 points and 10 rebounds, but went only 5-for-15 from the field.\n\nManu Ginobili scored 23 points and Tony Parker added 21 for the Spurs.\n\nCAVALIERS 108, WARRIORS 104\n\nAt Oakland, Calif., LeBron James had 24 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, and Damon Jones’ 3-pointer with 2:30 to play put visiting Cleveland ahead for good.\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas had 22 points and 13 rebounds for the defending Eastern Conference champions, who kept the Warriors winless.\n\nBaron Davis had 29 points and 10 assists for Golden State.\n\nKINGS 104, SUPERSONICS 98\n\nAt Seattle, Francisco Garcia hit a go-ahead baseline 3 with 29 seconds to play to give new Sacramento coach Reggie Theus a victory in his Arco Arena debut.\n\nSeattle rookie Kevin Durant had 27 points, seven rebounds and four assists for the Sonics, who are 0-4\n\nfor the first time in 30 years.\n\nMAGIC 111, T-WOLVES 103\n\nAt Minneapolis, Dwight Howard had 28 points and 16 rebounds in visiting Orlando’s victory against winless Minnesota.\n\nCarlos Arroyo had 18 points and six assists, and Rashard Lewis scored nine of his 27 points in the fourth quarter for the Magic.\n\nAl Jefferson led Minnesota with 25 points.\n\nSUNS 115, BOBCATS 83\n\nAt Charlotte, Leandro Barbosa, Raja Bell and Shawn Marion led eight players in double figures with 16 points apiece and Phoenix continued its dominance of the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Bobcats, who had been 2-0 for the first time in their four-year history, trailed by as many as 34 points against the Suns.\n\nPhoenix has now won 15 of its last 16 road games against Eastern teams dating to last season.\n\nCharlotte also lost point guard Raymond Felton to a left knee injury late in the third quarter. He was to undergo tests later Tuesday night.\n\nNETS 87, HAWKS 82\n\nAt Rutherford, N.J., Richard Jefferson scored 25 points to lead host New Jersey. Jason Kidd had nine points, 12 assists and nine rebounds in nearly collecting his second straight triple-double and helping the Nets win for the third time in four games.\n\nJosh Smith and backup forward Josh Childress had 18 points apiece to lead the Hawks.\n\nBUCKS 112, RAPTORS 85\n\nAt Milwaukee, Desmond Mason was 10-for-10 from the field and scored 21 points to lead host Milwaukee.\n\nJuan Dixon led the Raptors with 20 points.\n\nCLIPPERS 97, BULLS 91\n\nAt Chicago, Cuttino Mobley scored 33 points and Corey Maggette added 18 points, 10 rebounds and five assists to lead visiting Los Angeles.\n\nThe Clippers improved to 3-0 despite missing Elton Brand and Shaun Livingston with\n\ninjuries. The Bulls are 0-4 to start the season for the first time since 2004-05.\n\nLuol Deng scored 22 points for Chicago and Joe Smith added 17."
