        "text": "Three-Team, Eight-Player Deal Moves Jimmer Fredette to Sacramento; Stephen Jackson to Milwaukee\n\nOn June 23rd, 2011, in a three-team trade, the Milwaukee Bucks traded the draft rights of guard Jimmer Fredette and guard-forward John Salmons to the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats traded the draft rights of forward Tobias Harris, guard-forward Stephen Jackson and guard Shaun Livingston to the Bucks.\n\nThe Bucks traded forward Corey Maggette to the Bobcats. The Kings traded the draft rights of center Bismack Biyombo to the Bobcats and traded guard Beno Udrih to the Bucks.\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats were stuck in neutral, out of the playoff picture every year since the franchise’s birth in 2004, but yearning to get into the final steps of the full NBA season. In need of an offensive boost, the Bobcats made a trade early in the 2009-10 season, acquiring Stephen Jackson and Acie Law from the Golden State Warriors for Raja Bell and Vladimir Radmanovic.\n\nUnhappy in Golden State, Charlotte wasn’t Jackson’s ideal choice, but the move offered him a chance to be a central offensive option for a team. Under head coach Larry Brown, the Bobcats were an outstanding defensive unit.\n\nCharlotte was 3-6 when it acquired Jackson. Though the team fell to 3-9 after the trade, wins would accumulate. In January of 2010, a 9-1 stretch lifted the team above .500 at 21-19. It was the latest point in the season the team had been higher than that win threshold since it came into the league as an expansion franchise in 2004.\n\nThough the Bobcats would teeter below .500, they went 16-7 in the final 23 games to finish 44-38, the franchise’s best record since its inception. Though Jackson wasn’t the most efficient, he carried the team’s offense along with All-Star Gerald Wallace, averaging 21.1 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 2.6 APG, 1.6 SPG and 0.5 BPG in 72 games and 39.3 MPG.\n\nCharlotte finished seventh in the East and faced the 59-23 Orlando Magic in the first round. In the series opener, the Bobcats fell behind by as much as 22 points in the third quarter. Though the Bobcats cut the lead down to four points, they fell to Orlando 98-89.\n\nThe second game saw all five Magic starters reach double figures. Vince Carter led the way for Orlando with 19 points as the Magic took a 2-0 series lead with a 92-77 win.\n\nIn Charlotte, Game Three was tight. Magic guard Jameer Nelson was dominant with 32 points. Charlotte took an 80-79 lead with 3:32 left in the fourth quarter but Orlando made 9 of 10 free throws and outscored Charlotte 11-6 to win 90-86.\n\nIn the fourth game, Charlotte took a lead early in the first half. Orlando managed to gain control in the second half, pulling away in the middle of the fourth quarter. Carter had 21 points as the Magic used a key 14-4 run to win 99-90 and sweep Charlotte.\n\nJackson had a tough series, averaging 18.0 PPG on 35.8% from the field. The veteran shot just 3-18 (16.7%) from three in the sweep. He also managed 5.0 RPG, 3.8 APG and 1.3 SPG in 39.0 MPG.\n\nIn the offseason, the Bobcats dealt center Tyson Chandler to the Dallas Mavericks in a five-player deal and let starting point guard Raymond Felton leave in free agency. They were relatively quiet, signing free agents off the scrap heap such as Kwame Brown and Shaun Livingston (two years and $7 million with a third year team option).\n\nCharlotte’s owner Michael Jordan had hopes to improve on its first playoff appearance, saying that he expected a playoff appearance as the lowest bar for team expectations.\n\nThe Bobcats had a rough start, losing six of their first seven games. Just a month into the 2010-11 season, Charlotte canvassed the league for potential trade interest in Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson. The team continued to lose often, falling to 9-19 after 28 games.\n\nAt that point, head coach Larry Brown stepped down and Paul Silas was hired as interim head coach. Charlotte eventually found a trade for Wallace, dealing the one-time All-Star at the trade deadline to the Portland Trailblazers for Dante Cunningham, Sean Marks, Joel Przybilla and two future first round picks.\n\nLooking to cut payroll, the Bobcats essentially gave up on the season by dealing Wallace. They were 25-32 and just one and a half games behind the Indiana Pacers for the eighth seed. The move did not sit well with Jackson. After Jackson left the Bobcats he later said that the Wallace deal affected his feelings with being on the team in a December 2011 conversation (via The Charlotte Observer):\n\n“When Gerald left, I really left,’’ Jackson said at morning shootaround at Time Warner Cable Arena.\n\n“Considering what we did (getting to) the playoffs, and then all those changes. To take Gerald away really took a lot out of me. I still was trying to do my job as best I can, but it was a lot harder. When they got rid of Gerald, that let me know they didn’t want to win. I didn’t want to be part of a place like that.’’\n\nCharlotte went 9-16 over the final 25 games, finishing 34-48 and three games out of the last playoff spot in the East. Jackson played in 67 games (all starts) and managed 18.5 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 3.6 APG and 1.2 SPG in 35.9 MPG.\n\nLivingston continued his reemergence as a viable NBA player after a devastating injury suffered in 2007. With Charlotte, he was in a backup role, and contributed 6.6 PPG, 2.0 RPG, 2.2 APG and 0.6 SPG over 73 appearances and 17.3 MPG.\n\nBy the 2011 offseason, the Bobcats had fully committed to a rebuild. Jackson was next to go. Dealing Jackson and acquiring lottery pick Bismack Biyombo meant Charlotte was likely out of playoff contention heading into the next season.\n\nJackson ended his run in Charlotte with a stat line of 19.8 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 3.6 APG, 1.4 SPG and 0.5 BPG in 139 career games. The wing shot 42% from the field, 34% from three and 80% from the free-throw line. Livingston was also thrown into the deal with just one guaranteed year remaining on his contract.\n\nJohn Salmons joined the Milwaukee Bucks at the 2010 trade deadline in a deal with the Chicago Bulls. Known for his ability to score and create his own shot, Salmons was added to provide an offensive boost to a Bucks team in need of scoring.\n\nWith a promising duo of rookie point guard Brandon Jennings and center Andrew Bogut, the Bucks were hoping to complement the two with the Salmons acquisition. Milwaukee was just 24-28 and ninth in the East, two games out of the eighth and final playoff spot.\n\nThe addition of Salmons paid dividends immediately as Milwaukee won 15 of its next 17 games. The Bucks finished the year 46-36, going 22-8 after making the trade deadline deal for Salmons. Defense became the team’s calling card as it posted a 99.9 defensive rating over the final 30 games which was tops in the NBA.\n\nAfter an uneven first half of the season with Chicago, Salmons became a premier option in the Bucks offense. In 30 games, the wing appeared in 30 games (28 starts) and produced 19.9 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.1 SPG in 37.6 MPG.\n\nThough the Bucks went on a hot streak in the second half of the year, they lost a big part of the team when defensive lynchpin Andrew Bogut suffered a devastating arm, elbow and hand injury on a fall after he was pushed on a dunk.\n\nThe injury occurred with just six games left in the season, and de-fanged a Bucks team that had galvanized its fanbase—earning the phrase “fear the deer”—and started to build a case as a difficult first round opponent.\n\nThe Bucks entered the postseason as the sixth seed where they faced the third-seeded Atlanta Hawks. In the first game, Jennings had 34 points, but didn’t get much help. Six Hawks recorded at least 12 points as Atlanta won 102-92 in the series opener.\n\nThe second game saw Joe Johnson lead the Hawks with 27 points. The Bucks shot just 4-for-24 from three as Atlanta took a 2-0 series lead with a 96-86 win.\n\nMilwaukee’s outside shooting would turn around in Game Three at home. The Bucks shot 10-for-23 from long distance and built an early 36-19 lead in the first quarter. They never looked back, winning Game Three easily 107-89.\n\nIn the fourth game, Jennings (23 points), Salmons (22) and Carlos Delfino (22) carried the Bucks to a closer 111-104 win. The fifth game was back in Atlanta and the Hawks controlled much of the second half.\n\nAtlanta was up 82-73 after a Josh Smith jumper with 4:09 remaining. The Bucks went on a 14-0 charge behind Salmons (19 points) and held on for a 91-87 victory and a 3-2 series lead.\n\nWith a chance to win the series at home, Milwaukee struggled in the second half. Outscored 52-35 in that time frame, the Bucks lost 83-69. Salmons shot just 2-of-13 in that game.\n\nIn the seventh and final game, Atlanta built an early double digit lead and never looked back. Sixth man Jamal Crawford led the Hawks with 22 points as they cruised to a 95-74 rout.\n\nThe Bucks were heavy underdogs in the series and gave the Hawks a scare, but still couldn’t close the deal. Salmons finished the series with 17.0 PPG on 40.4% shooting and 17.4% from the three-point line. He also produced 3.7 RPG, 4.0 APG and 1.4 SPG in 40.4 MPG.\n\nLooking to add scoring to the roster, the Bucks acquired Corey Maggette from the Golden State Warriors in a three-player deal. The team also added big man Drew Gooden on a five-year, $32 million free agent deal.\n\nSalmons became a free agent in the 2010 offseason after opting out of his contract. The Bucks re-signed the wing on a five-year, $39 million contract. with the last year of the deal partially guaranteed.\n\nThere was a buzz around Milwaukee heading into the 2010-11 season. Though they weren’t title contenders, the return of Bogut from injury, the growth of Jennings, and the additions of Gooden and Maggette with the re-signing of Salmons created some hope of a competitive team that could aim for one of the mid-tier playoff seeds in the East.\n\nA 1-4 start to the season would be the early signs of a disappointing season. The Bucks managed to get to 5-5, but subsequently lost seven of their next eight games.\n\nInjuries would prove to be a major issue and an offense that ranked dead last in the NBA was a hinderance to Milwaukee having success. Bogut missed 17 games, Jennings was out for 19 games. Delfino also was absent for 33 games while Gooden only played in 35 games that year.\n\nThough the Bucks still managed to stay in the East playoff race, they ended up falling short two games of the eighth seed with a 35-47 record. Salmons had an uneven year, producing 14.0 PPG, 3.6 RPG, 3.5 APG and 1.0 SPG in 73 games and 35.0 MPG.\n\nMaggette was excited to join the Bucks, looking to provide scoring while seeing the young team as a contending team. Those feelings would change as injuries and ineffectiveness would lessen his chance to make an impact. Maggette lost his spot in the rotation late in the year. In the final 22 games, he played in just 13 and averaged just 12.8 MPG.\n\nOverall, the veteran scorer played in 67 games and averaging 12.0 PPG, 3.6 RPG and 1.3 APG in 20.9 MPG.\n\nTrying to shake up the roster, the Bucks agreed to the three-team deal with Charlotte and Sacramento, dealing Salmons to the Kings and Maggette to the Bobcats while acquiring Stephen Jackson. On the draft front, the Bucks essentially traded down, dealing the 10th pick (Jimmer Fredette) for the 19th pick (Tobias Harris).\n\nSalmons ended his tenure in Milwaukee with 15.7 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 3.4 APG and 1.0 SPG in 103 career games. The wing shot 43% from the field, 38% from the three-point line and 83% from the charity stripe.\n\nThough he was a two-time NBA champion, Beno Udrih had yet to establish himself in the NBA. Stuck on the bench behind Tony Parker in San Antonio, Udrih had never averaged more than 14.4 MPG in his first three seasons with the Spurs.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, the Spurs dealt Udrih to the Minnesota Timberwolves after he fractured his left index finger and had fallen out of the rotation. Minnesota waived Udrih immediately, and the Sacramento Kings acquired the guard, signing him to fill in for injured guard Mike Bibby on a one-year minimum contract.\n\nUdrih returned from his finger injury and soon rose to starter. The point guard began putting up career numbers, but the team’s poor play began to outweigh his individual rise. The Kings were below .500 immediately, dropping nine of their first 13 games.\n\nIn the middle of the season, Bibby returned from injury and Udrih was moved to a reserve role. After 12 games, Bibby was dealt to the Atlanta Hawks for four players and a second round pick.\n\nUdrih took back the starting role and held it for the rest of the season. Overall, he performed in 65 games (51 starts) and compiled 12.8 PPG, 3.3 RPG, 4.3 APG and 0.9 SPG in 32.0 MPG. The effort earned Udrih 17 voter points and a ninth-placed finish in the ‘07-‘08 season Most Improved Player of the Year award race.\n\nLed by Ron Artest and Kevin Martin, the Kings were competitive as a team and exceeded expectations, but finished 38-44 and out of the playoffs that year.\n\nIn the 2008 offseason, Udrih was rewarded for his career year and re-signed for five years and $32 million with a player option in the final year.\n\nArtest decided not to opt out of his deal in 2008, but later publicly regretted the move. The Kings eventually decided to move Artest to the Houston Rockets in a six-player deal.\n\nThough Artest was a volatile player, he was Sacramento’s best two-way talent and the Kings got little in return in veteran Bobby Jackson, prospect Donte Greene and a late first round pick.\n\nThe move took the Kings from mediocre to flat out bad. The Kings started 4-5, but went 4-24 over their next 28 games. During that stretch, head coach Reggie Theus was fired and replaced by Kenny Natt for the rest of the season.\n\nAs the losses began to pile up, the Kings began to build for the future. Near the 2009 trade deadline, the Kings traded Brad Miller and John Salmons to the Chicago Bulls in a six-player deal.\n\nThe Kings finished 17-65 that season, the worst winning percentage the club had posted ever. Udrih continued to be a steady presence at point guard, managing 11.0 PPG, 3.0 RPG, 4.7 APG and 1.1 SPG in 73 games and 31.1 MPG.\n\nThough they had the worst record in the NBA, the Kings were unlucky, earning the fourth selection in the 2009 NBA Draft. Sacramento ended up selecting guard Tyreke Evans from Memphis. The team also selected forward Omri Casspi 23rd in the same draft.\n\nInterim head coach Kenny Natt was let go and the Kings hired head coach Paul Westphal. The drafting of Evans who was capable of playing the point guard position and the acquisition of guard Sergio Rodriguez signaled Sacramento’s readiness to find a different option than Udrih.\n\nHeading into the training camp, Westphal decided to hand the role of point guard to Evans, placing Udrih on the bench to start the season. Udrih was in the starting lineup occasionally when starting shooting guard Kevin Martin missed time due to injury.\n\nThough Evans was a solid addition—and would later win the Rookie of the Year—the Kings were still one of the NBA’s worst teams. Off to a decent 14-16 start after 30 games, Sacramento dropped 23 of its next 27 games. Around the end of that stretch, Martin was traded to the Houston Rockets in a three-team deal that brought in forward Carl Landry.\n\nSacramento went 5-18 over its final 23 games, finishing 25-57, third-worst in the NBA. Udrih moved into the starting lineup after the Martin trade. He finished his third year in Sacramento with 12.9 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 4.7 APG and 1.1 SPG in 79 games (41 starts) and 31.4 MPG.\n\nIn the 2010 offseason, Sacramento beefed up its frontline drafting University of Kentucky center DeMarcus Cousins fifth overall and trading for center Samuel Dalembert.\n\nSacramento began the 2010-11 season 3-1, but lost the next 22 of 24 games to fall to 5-23. Though Cousins and Evans were solid building blocks, the Kings continued to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, finishing with the second-worst record in the West at 24-58.\n\nUdrih began the season as a starter at point guard and held the role until late in the season when coach Paul Westphal inserted guard Marcus Thornton into the starting lineup. Overall, Udrih played in 79 games (64 starts) and managed 13.7 PPG, 3.4 RPG, 4.9 APG and 1.2 SPG in 34.6 MPG.\n\nHeading into the draft, the Kings had their eyes on guard Jimmer Fredette. Owning the seventh pick, the Kings were able to trade down in the draft, while dealing Udrih and the two years and $14.2 million remaining on his contract to the Milwaukee Bucks and acquiring John Salmons and the over $24 million and three years left on his deal.\n\nUdrih ended his time in Sacramento with 12.6 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 4.7 APG and 1.1 SPG in 296 games. The Slovenian guard shot 48% from the field, 36% from beyond the arc and 85% from the free-throw line.\n\nAfter the trade, the Bucks hoped to get back into the postseason with Stephen Jackson added to its Andrew Bogut-Brandon Jennings core.\n\nJackson was a starter for the first 13 games of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, but his relationship with Skiles soured quickly. First, Jackson was benched in the second half of a 105-95 loss to Denver, but the turning point was when the veteran missed a shoot-around ahead of a game on the road against the New York Knicks.\n\nAfter the Nuggets game, Jackson sounded dispirited about his relationship with Skiles (via the Journal Times):\n\n“We don’t have no relationship like I’ve had with other coaches and I don’t expect to have one. Too much stuff has happened.”\n\nJackson did not play against the Knicks and came off the bench four games later. He was suspended for the next game after a verbal altercation with an official, and benched for three of the next four games.\n\nThough he returned to the rotation for a handful of games, Jackson was benched the rest of his time with Milwaukee.\n\nHe was dealt near the trade deadline to the Golden State Warriors with Andrew Bogut for Monta Ellis, Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh. The landing place of Golden State wouldn’t be for long as the Warriors dealt Jackson to the San Antonio Spurs two days later.\n\nHe ended his brief tenure with the Bucks with 10.5 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 2.0 APG and 1.0 SPG in 26 games (13 starts) and 27.4 MPG.\n\nUdrih had a much smaller role in Milwaukee compared to his time in Sacramento. Though the guard was solid, he appeared in 59 games and contributed 5.9 PPG, 1.7 RPG, 3.8 APG and 0.6 SPG in 18.3 MPG.\n\nWith Brandon Jennings and Udrih at point guard, Shaun Livingston found his niche in Milwaukee as a two-guard. He appeared in 58 contests (27 starts) and posted 5.5 PPG, 2.1 RPG, 2.1 APG and 0.5 SPG in 18.8 MPG.\n\nIn Harris’ rookie season, he was in and out of the rotation. The forward played in 42 games, making nine starts. In 11.4 MPG, Harris managed 5.0 PPG, 2.4 RPG and 0.5 APG.\n\nMilwaukee had been a middling team for much of 2011-12. The franchise reached .500 after 56 games with a 28-28 record, but went 3-7 over the final 10 games to finish 31-35. Ninth in the East, the Bucks finished four games behind the eighth-place Philadelphia 76ers for the final playoff spot.\n\nAfter the season, Livingston was traded near the 2012 draft to the Houston Rockets in a multi-player deal. Udrih opted into the final year of his contract.\n\nHarris appeared in Las Vegas Summer League for Milwaukee’s team and played well. The forward put up 20.8 PPG on 53% shooting and 7.0 RPG in five exhibition games.\n\nWith the team now focused on building around Brandon Jennings and Monta Ellis, Milwaukee won six of its first eight games during the 2012-13 season. The Bucks would prove to be just average, falling to .500. After 32 games, the team was 16-16. At that point, Skiles and the team mutually parted ways and he was replaced by assistant coach Jim Boylan on an interim basis.\n\nThe Bucks went through a stretch where they lost eight of 10 before the trade deadline. To shake things up and improve the team, Milwaukee dealt Udrih and Harris along with Doron Lamb to the Orlando Magic for guard J.J. Redick, center Gustavo Ayon and guard Ish Smith.\n\nUdrih had a similar second year with Milwaukee compared to the previous season. He played in 39 games before the trade, putting up 6.7 PPG, 2.0 RPG and 3.5 APG in 18.4 MPG.\n\nUdrih ended his stay in Milwaukee with a stat line of 6.2 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 3.7 APG and 0.5 SPG in 98 games. The Slovenian guard shot 45% from the field, 28% from the three-point line and 72% from the free-throw line in that time.\n\nLike Udrih, Harris had also seen a similar role in his second season. The forward had played in 28 games (14 starts) and recorded 4.9 PPG, 2.0 RPG and 0.5 APG in 11.6 MPG.\n\nHis brief run in Milwaukee ended with a stat line of 4.9 PPG, 2.3 RPG and 0.5 APG in 70 contests. The former Tennessee Volunteer shot 46% from the field, 29% from the three-point line and 84% from the free-throw line.\n\nHeading into its first full season of a rebuild phase, the Bobcats had little hope for collecting wins. Charlotte won its first game of the season, but would then lose 26 of its next 28 games. The losses continued to pile up during the lockout-shortened season. Charlotte ended the campaign with 23 consecutive losses. The team finished 7-59, the worst record by winning percentage (10.6%) in NBA history.\n\nBismack Biyombo was a raw and unfinished product heading into the NBA and it showed in his rookie season. Though he showed a penchant for protecting the rim (1.8 BPG), Biyombo was limited on the offensive end.\n\nThe 19-year old rookie came off the bench initially, but started later in the season. Overall, he saw action in 63 contests (41 starts) and amassed 5.2 PPG and 5.8 RPG in 23.1 MPG.\n\nThe Bobcats had hoped Maggette would be able to provide a reliable scoring presence, but he dealt with numerous injuries including a strained right achilles tendon, left hamstring issue and lower back contusion.\n\nThe veteran was limited to 32 games, posting 15.0 PPG on just 37.3% from the field, 3.9 RPG, 1.2 APG and 0.7 SPG in 27.5 MPG.\n\nAfter the season, Maggette’s time was cut short in Charlotte as the Bobcats dealt the forward to the Detroit Pistons for Ben Gordon and a future first round pick.\n\nThe Bobcats hoped to get the first overall selection in the 2012 draft and pick Anthony Davis, but they ended up second in the draft lottery and took his college teammate at the University of Kentucky, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. The team also added free agents Ramon Sessions and Brendan Haywood to the team. Charlotte let go of coach Paul Silas and hired Mike Dunlap.\n\nAfter missing Summer League for his rookie season due to the NBA Lockout, Biyombo played for Charlotte’s Las Vegas Summer League entry in 2012. In five games, the center averaged 8.6 PPG, 6.0 RPG and 1.8 BPG in 21.0 MPG.\n\nBiyombo began the year off the bench, but was inserted into the starting lineup in early December and held the spot for the rest of the year. He showed limited growth on offense, averaging just 4.8 PPG in 80 games and 27.3 MPG. The center also posted 7.3 RPG and 1.8 BPG.\n\nUnder new head coach Dunlap, the Bobcats managed a 7-5 record after 12 games. Trouble would ensue as the team lost its next 18 games. Charlotte finished just one game ahead of worst record in the NBA with a 21-61 record.\n\nDunlap was fired after just one season in Charlotte. The team replaced him with Steve Clifford.\n\nOn the personnel front, the Bobcats beefed up their frontcourt, drafting center Cody Zeller fourth overall and signing center Al Jefferson to a three-year contract.\n\nBiyombo played in Summer League after his sophomore season, managing 5.5 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 1.3 APG and 1.5 BPG in 23.4 MPG for Charlotte’s squad in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Bobcats began the year 15-23 and in ninth place. Thanks to a stout defense, Charlotte managed to go 19-9 in its final 28 games to finish seventh in the East with a 43-39 record.\n\nWith Jefferson and Zeller on the roster, Biyombo saw a significant decrease in playing time for his third season. The center played in 77 contests (nine starts) and posted 2.9 PPG, 4.8 RPG and 1.1 BPG in 13.9 MPG.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bobcats faced the defending champion Miami Heat. Charlotte suffered a major setback when Jefferson strained the plantar fascia in his left foot early in the first game of the series. Charlotte got off to a good start, but Miami won 99-88 thanks to an 18-4 run in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn Game Two, the Heat led for much of the game. Though the Bobcats fought, LeBron James’ 32 points and eight assists was enough in a 101-97 Heat win. In Charlotte, the Bobcats managed to take an early lead in game Three. The Heat took over midway, building a 26-point lead and held on for a 98-85 final score.\n\nIn the fourth game, Jefferson sat out and Biyombo started for him. James had 31 points and nine assists as Miami comfortably won 109-98 and took the series in a four-game sweep. Biyombo played in three of the four games and managed 2.7 PPG, 3.7 RPG and 0.7 BPG in 16.1 MPG.\n\nAfter the season, the Bobcats underwent many changes. First, the franchise changed its name to the Hornets. On the personnel front, the team signed Pacers guard Lance Stephenson in free agency to a three-year deal.\n\nThe Hornets were expected to build upon the previous season that saw them make the playoffs for the first time in four years. Charlotte went 4-15 to begin the year The team was 10-24 when a 12-3 run placed them seventh in the East at 22-27.\n\nAfter 61 games, Charlotte was seventh with a 28-33 record. A 5-16 finish ended postseason hopes as the team finished with a 33-49 mark. Perimeter shooting was an issue as the team was last in the league in three-point shooting percentage (31.8%).\n\nBiyombo appeared in 64 games (21 starts) and contributed 4.8 PPG, 6.4 RPG and 1.5 BPG in 19.4 MPG.\n\nAfter the season, the Hornets went in a different direction from Biyombo who was a free agent. Acquiring center Spencer Hawes in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers and the drafting of center Frank Kaminsky made a Biyombo return even more unlikely.\n\nCharlotte decided not to tender a qualifying offer to Biyombo, making the center an unrestricted free agent. Biyombo ended up leaving Charlotte, signing a two-year, $6 million deal with the Toronto Raptors with a player option in the final year.\n\nIn four years with the Charlotte franchise, Biyombo failed to live up to his lottery status, amassing 4.4 PPG, 6.1 RPG and 1.6 BPG in 284 games. The big man shot 50% from the field and 53% from the charity stripe in that time.\n\nThough he wasn’t the number one overall pick, there was a considerable amount of interest in Jimmer Fredette. Arguably the most famous draft pick that year, Fredette had captured the nation’s attention at BYU with long-distance threes and 28.9 PPG, the highest mark in the NCAA that year.\n\nFredette was so popular that the title “Jimmermania” had become a common sports buzz word. Though there was excitement, it was hard to envision where Fredette fit with Sacramento already having perimeter options like Tyreke Evans and Marcus Thornton deeply embedded in the team’s offense.\n\nAlso a point of issue was the Kings’ dysfunctional roster as well as the franchise’s constant pursuit of relocation.\n\nDuring the 2011-12 season, the Kings began the year 2-5 when head coach Paul Westphal was fired and replaced by Keith Smart after Westphal battled consistently with center DeMarcus Cousins.\n\nThe coaching change didn’t alter much as Sacramento continued to be one of the worst teams in the NBA with a 22-44 record.\n\nIn his first taste of NBA action, Fredette was decent with an ability to score off the bench, but defense was an issue and his lack of a true position on the floor as an undersized shooter was problematic. In 61 games (seven starts) Fredette compiled 7.6 PPG, 1.2 RPG, 1.8 APG and 0.5 SPG in 18.6 MPG.\n\nThe surprise for Sacramento was Fredette’s fellow rookie Isaiah Thomas. Picked last in the same draft, Thomas passed Fredette in the rotation and received regular minutes at point guard.\n\nSalmons was a starter most of the year, but had his smallest offensive role. He took the lowest amount of field goal attempts (9.9) per 36 minutes in five years. Salmons recorded 7.5 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 2.0 APG and 0.8 SPG in 46 games and 27.2 MPG.\n\nIn the 2012 offseason, the Kings drafted forward Thomas Robinson fifth overall. Fredette had a rough go of it for Summer League with Sacramento. In five contests the guard averaged 18.0 PPG, but shot just 36% from the field and 22% from the three-point line.\n\nThe Kings began the 2012-13 season a disappointing 2-8 and never recovered. Though the team had built a nice nucleus of young talent, Sacramento still finished out of the playoffs with a 28-54 record. Defense was the issue as the team finished second to last in defensive efficiency (111.4 points allowed per 100 possessions).\n\nFredette had a similar role in his second year, posting 7.2 PPG, 1.0 RPG and 1.3 APG in 69 games and 14.0 MPG. Salmons was a full-time starter, putting up 8.8 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 3.0 APG and 0.7 SPG in 30.0 MPG and 76 contests.\n\nThe Kings entered a new era in the spring of 2013. The Maloof family sold the team to Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadivé for $535 million. With a new owner came changes across the board. Team president Geoff Petrie was replaced by incoming general manager Pete D’Alessandro and head coach Keith Smart was let go with Michael Malone taking his spot.\n\nIn a sign of the lack of interest in Fredette, the Kings drafted shooting guard Ben McLemore in the lottery. The franchise also traded former Rookie of the Year Tyreke Evans to the New Orleans Pelicans in a three-team deal that netted them guard Greivis Vásquez.\n\nIn a surprise move, the Kings declined the fourth-year team option for Fredette at the start of the 2013-14 season. The move made the guard an unrestricted free agent for the 2014 offseason.\n\n18 games into the new season, Salmons was traded with Chuck Hayes, Patrick Patterson and Greivis Vásquez to the Toronto Raptors for Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray. Salmons had seen his role decline slightly early on as he played 18 games and managed 5.8 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 2.4 APG and 0.7 SPG in 24.7 MPG.\n\nSalmons ended his second stint with the Kings with 8.0 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 2.6 APG and 0.7 SPG in 140 games. He shot 40% from the field, 35% from the three-point line and 75% on free-throws.\n\nSacramento had reshaped its core around DeMarcus Cousins, Gay and Thomas, but still was largely a train-wreck, dropping 18 of its first 25 games.\n\nFredette played in 41 games with the Kings, averaging 5.9 PPG, 1.1 RPG and 1.5 APG in 11.3 MPG. He was waived by the team in February of 2014. In his second to last game, he had a career-high 24 points against the Knicks.\n\nFredette later signed a contract for the rest of the season with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nFredette finished his time in Sacramento with a stat-line of 171 games (seven starts), 7.0 PPG, 1.1 RPG and 1.5 APG. The BYU-product shot 42% from the field, 40% from behind the arc and 85% from the free-throw line.\n\nIt was clear that Fredette’s best skill, three-point shooting was available in Sacramento, but he wasn’t able to develop into a passer or respectable defender to complement what the Kings needed.\n\nStephen Jackson on trying to be a leader for the Bucks (via Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel):\n\n“I have to be because it’s not something that he (Skiles) is going to have to ask me to do. It comes natural. Being a leader is nothing you can teach. With me having a lot of success in this league, I think guys will respect that. But at the same time, I’m going to lead by example. I’m going to gain my respect by playing harder and going out and trying to win games every night.”\n\nHow leaving Charlotte was inevitable:\n\n“Deep down inside, they didn’t want me there on a rebuilding team. And I didn’t really want to be a part of that. I think this was inevitable. Winning now is important to me, and this is a great place to win now. I know what it takes to get to the playoffs, and I think definitely we’’ll be there come the end of the season.”\n\nHow he’s earned a reputation as a volatile player:\n\n“I know what I’m doing. I know how to get a tech, and I think toward the end of the season I started being smarter with my technical fouls. Over the last four years, I’ve gotten better.\n\n“Sometimes my emotions are to a fault. But at the same time, I’d rather play the game with that emotion and that pride than not play with it at all. I’ve got to be smarter about it, but I’m going to play with the same passion and desire every night, and no one is going to change that.”\n\nHow the position he plays affects his weight:\n\n“I need to know where I’m starting at because that’s how I approach my weight. If I play two-guard I’ll probably come in at 215 (pounds), like I am now. If I’m playing the 3, I’ll probably come back at 230, a little bulkier. I’ll talk to coach and figure out where they want me.\n\n“As I got older, I learned how to use my advantages, my weight and size, on guys. Especially at two-guard, because I’m one of the biggest two-guards in the league.”\n\nOn Bucks guard Brandon Jennings (via the Racine Journal Times):\n\n“My job is just to push him. I’m going to constantly let him know how good he is. I’m going to continue to push him, let him know this team will only go as far as he goes. I might be the oldest guy on the team with the most years, but he is the leader of this team.”\n\nHow he plans on being a leader:\n\n“For us to win, we have to be all on the same page. And I’m pretty sure that coach is going to give me the room to police all that. If guys don’t want to play, you need to let us know that, because you’re not going to be a part of us. And I’m going to make that known.”\n\nBeno Udrih on his offensive game (via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel):\n\n“I don’t think it’s a secret; it’s just playing the right way. I’m not trying to force and shoot over three people. If I see help coming from the weak side, I’m trying to kick out for the open shot. If I’m wide open, I go all the way. I’m not perfect; I’ll make mistakes.”\n\nOn his role:\n\n“My thinking is it doesn’t really matter who starts the game. It matters more what you do during the game and what you do with the minutes you get. Whatever minutes are given to me, I’m going to go out there and play hard and try to help my teammates.”\n\nShaun Livingston on getting back to playing a bigger role after serious injury and being a key defender (via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel):\n\n“It was my first (full) season back from my injury and it did a world of difference for my confidence. Before my injury I played for (Mike) Dunleavy and he used to put me on some of the top scorers, for my length and being able to contest shots, being able to get in passing lanes.\n\n“That’s something I’m looking to bring with me and also get better as my body picks up as well. I felt great (last season). I started feeling better and better the more minutes I played. I started to feel stronger and my confidence started to pick up.”\n\nTobias Harris on joining the Milwaukee Bucks during the draft (via ASAP Sports):\n\n“I think it’s a great honor to be drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks. I just feel like it’s a great fit for me as a player, coming in and bringing a winning attitude and just a great work ethic to the table.\n\n“I believe that we have a great organization, and we are on the rise to doing big things in the conference, and being a hometown kid from New York, getting to go to this draft, and being in front of all my family and friends and fans, and get drafted is just a great opportunity and is just a blessing from God.”\n\nCorey Maggette on returning to the state of North Carolina and playing for Bobcats owner and former NBA superstar Michael Jordan (via The Charlotte Observer):\n\n“It’s a pleasure to be back in the North Carolina area and playing for one of the greatest players to ever play the game.”\n\nOn playing with a young roster in Charlotte:\n\n“I think it’s really going to rejuvenate me to play with these younger guys. We have a real opportunity to excel.”\n\nBismack Biyombo on if he knew the Bobcats would draft him (via Bobcats.com):\n\n“The last meeting I had with the two guys you see right there [points to Bobcats GM Rich Cho and President of Basketball Operations Rod Higgins], I have a lot of respect for them. Rich, especially. Before he came to Charlotte, he was in Portland and everybody knows he was trying to move up to pick me. So, when I first met him, he was like, ‘Man, when I was in Portland, I wanted to move up. Now, I have the No. 9, so we’ll pick you up. Yeah, no problem.’\n\n“Then, after workouts, he was like, ‘No, no, no, you’re not getting to nine [laughs]. I’m going to have to move up again.’ I was so excited to be here. I was thinking I might get drafted by Toronto, but I wanted to be here. My agent was like, ‘Take it easy; you will be there.’ And right after they called Valanciunas at five and we were waiting for the six, [his agent] Igor got an email from Rich saying that Bismack will be a Bobcat. I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, I made it!’”\n\nJimmer Fredette on joining the Sacramento Kings after the draft (via ASAP Sports):\n\n“Obviously Sacramento King, officially. Took a little while waiting back there. But it’s a great moment for me and for my family, and for the Sacramento Kings organization. Hopefully their fan base is excited because I’m really excited to get out there and start the season with them and have a great year. So I’m looking forward to it.”\n\nOn playing with Kings guard Tyreke Evans:\n\n“He’s a slashing guard and able to get into the lane, very physical guy who can guard the point and the two, because he is so big. So that’s an advantage. Hopefully I think we’ll be able to play really, really well together.\n\n“Like I said, it’s a young team, young nucleus of guys they have out there. But we are an exciting team that likes to get up-and-down and score the basketball, so it’s a great fit.”\n\nIf he knew Sacramento was a real possibility:\n\n“When they made the trade to No. 10, I thought that was a possibility for sure. We worked out with five teams and I thought I would land with one of those five teams and I worked out with Sacramento, so I knew I had a shot. They liked me out there, the Maloofs and Coach and Petrie, they liked me. So I had a pretty good workout and I knew it was a possibility, and now it’s a reality.”\n\nOn the Kings’ style of play:\n\n“[It’s] the style of play that I like, up-tempo system, ball screens, I like to score the basketball. So it plays right into my style of play. That’s how I’ve played my whole entire life at college and in high school. So this is no different. So hopefully we can get out there and have a great team. Be able to excite the fans and get more wins this year.”\n\nJohn Salmons on the shock of being traded back to Sacramento (via The Sacramento Bee):\n\n“[I didn’t have] any inclination I was getting traded or anything like that. That’s what made it even more shocking. I just never thought I’d be back to a team I’d played for.”\n\nOn how making the playoffs with Chicago was big for his career (via The Sacramento Bee):\n\n“That was a big moment in my career. Just by being in the playoffs and just playing in that environment.”\n\nOn the Kings having a young team:\n\n“I feel like we have a lot of young talent. It’s just a matter of piecing it together.”\n\nMilwaukee Bucks general manager John Hammond on acquiring rookie Tobias Harris in draft trade (via Wisconsin State Journal):\n\n“We were thrilled to be able to pick with the 19th pick Tobias Harris. He’s just an amazing guy. You’re going to love getting to know him and spending time with him and I think he’ll be a great addition to this organization and a guy who we’ll love to see walk in this door every day. And he has a chance to be a very good player.”\n\nOn Stephen Jackson:\n\n“We know Stephen is the ultimate competitor, warrior. You start with tough guys and guys who are willing to compete and he’s always at the top of the list. And he can score the ball.”\n\nOn reports Jackson was unhappy with trade (via Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel):\n\n“Most guys aren’t happy when they’re traded. It’s a transition period, and we’ll find a way to make him comfortable.”\n\nOn John Salmons:\n\n“Nothing happened with John. If we make a decision on a player like John, we hope he becomes an asset for us. I think it says something about John Salmons that he has value like that. The Sacramento Kings have already signed him to one contract, a very good contract before he came and played for us.\n\n“You talk about what we did today and losing a man like John Salmons, that’s not good. At the wing spot you can look at our roster and say it’s a combination of Carlos Delfino and Stephen Jackson, and I think those guys are capable of manning those positions.”\n\nHow he thought the Bucks would hold on to the 10th pick originally:\n\n“I really thought the other day we would keep 10. I think we could have gotten a good player there. Especially over the last 48 hours we started looking at opportunities. We thought if we could improve our team and stay in the draft, that was the real goal. I think we have done that.”\n\nOn a call he had Udrih after the trade happened (via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel):\n\n“When I hung up the phone with Beno, the two things that stuck out with me is he talked about the team and he talked about winning. This guy can start for a lot of teams in the NBA. We’ll see how things play out here.\n\n“A lot of guys could have concerns about themselves on a call like that. Never once did he ever mention himself. I could tell he wanted to win and be on a good team.”\n\nSacramento Kings president of basketball operations Geoff Petrie on acquiring John Salmons and Jimmer Fredette (via Kings.com):\n\n“The acquisition of John Salmons, whom we had before, gives us a versatile small forward that can score the ball and defend a number of different positions. He obviously brings some experience back to our team and was extremely productive in his former stint as a King. We’re looking forward to have him come back and join our team.\n\n“Jimmer was one of the most exciting players in college basketball the last couple of seasons. If not the best shooter in the draft, he was certainly one of the best. He’ll add a new dimension to our team offensively. He’s an exciting player and I think our fans will enjoy him as well.”\n\nCharlotte Bobcats president of basketball operations Rod Higgins on trading Stephen Jackson but getting something back in return (via the Charlotte Observer):\n\n“To make these big deals, sometimes tough things go with it. For us, that was trading our top scorer. But we also brought in a guy who can put points on the board, and I’m talking about Corey Maggette.”\n\nOn losing Stephen Jackson and trying to replace his scoring (via Bobcats.com):\n\n“I think we all know what Stephen brought to the table. His positives were – he was tough-minded, he could make a clutch shot., he could put up a lot of points for you, he had leadership qualities. I think the one thing that people don’t see is that he was a very good teammate and he’s always been with these guys.\n\n“I’m sure that’s going to be missed. Scoring those 20 points per game, that’s something we’re going to have to figure out. Corey Maggette’s going to come in here, and that’s one of his strong points. He’s going to get up and down the floor, he’s going to get to the free-throw line, he’s probably going to make 85 percent of his free throws over the course of the season.\n\n“He’s going to be a guy that we’re going to lean on. Not just Corey; there’s going to be an opportunity for a lot players to pick up the slack. We’re looking forward to getting those guys on the court. I’m sure Coach Silas and his staff will have them in a good position.”\n\nBobcats general manager Rich Cho on acquiring Bismack Biyombo in the draft and what stood out about him (via the Charlotte Observer):\n\n“He seems really confident, yet humble. He’s very mature and yet you can see he’s still a kid. It’s an infectious personality and he has the DNA of the person and player we want to bring in here.”\n\nMilwaukee Bucks head coach Scott Skiles on acquiring Jackson, Udrih and Livingston (via Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel):\n\n“If you really dissect some of our offensive woes, (part of it was) our inability to make the easy pass and the more difficult passes. Stevie Jackson always has been able to put the ball on the floor and make plays. Beno has been able to do that. Shaun Livingston has great vision. Those three guys create offense for other guys and draw attention. That’s big for us right now.”\n\nOn reports that Stephen Jackson was unhappy with the trade to Milwaukee:\n\n“Most guys aren’t happy when they’re traded. It’s a transition period, and we’ll find a way to make him comfortable.”\n\nOn Jackson:\n\n“I was in Phoenix when we drafted him; I was an assistant coach. So I’ve known him a long time. We had a great talk. I don’t think it’s fair to think because somebody tweets something it’s necessarily true or goes on TV and reports it. We want all our guys to be comfortable. He’s a competitor and I don’t anticipate any issues at all.”\n\nOn Beno Udrih:\n\n“You can pretty much go year by year with him [Udrih]. He’s going to shoot upper 40s (from the field). He’s going to shoot upper 30s from three and he’s going to shoot mid-80s from the line. And he’s a very good pick-and-roll player and another guy who plays with some toughness. With his size and he’s got some thickness to his body, I don’t see why he and Brandon [Jennings] couldn’t play together some. He knows how to play the NBA game and personally I’ve always been a fan of his.”\n\nOn acquiring draft pick Tobias Harris:\n\n“He has the chance to be really versatile. You like him immediately the moment you meet him, and if you like his game anyway… you feel by watching him whatever his ceiling is going to be, he’s going to reach it. He’s another guy who moves around the floor well. He can do things with the basketball, and he can make a shot.”\n\nOn Jackson’s competitive nature (via Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel):\n\n“The season is so long and all the players want to win. But the really highly competitive guys can make a difference and get you through the season. And Stephen has always been that.”\n\nOn Livingston playing multiple positions for Bucks (via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel):\n\n“He’s going to have to learn several positions because we think he can play those positions, and we know he can guard those positions.”\n\nOn Udrih’s positional fit:\n\n“By anybody’s measure, most franchises, most coaches, most GMs would say Beno is a point guard. That’s the type of game he plays. But that doesn’t mean he can’t do other things. There are times when both of our guards (Brandon Jennings and Udrih) or three point guards are going to be in the game together.”\n\nKings head coach Paul Westphal on Jimmer Fredette (via The Sacramento Bee):\n\n“We think he’ll fit in really well with our roster. I hesitate to say until we get out there and get after it, but I think of him as a point guard. He plays the pick-and-roll really well. He’s a good passer, obviously he’s a great shooter.”\n\nOn John Salmons:\n\n“I think he’s going to help us tremendously.”\n\nHow Salmons helps the Kings attack smaller guards on offense if teams try to hide them on him (via The Sacramento Bee):\n\n“When they play a small guard, we like to post them up. After people figured that out, they stopped putting small guards on Tyreke [Evans]. They started putting them on our (small forwards) or Beno [Udrih] if he was in there.”\n\nBobcats head coach Paul Silas on Corey Maggette’s role (via the Charlotte Observer):\n\n“Corey has got to come through. He can be a 20-point scorer. He’s going to be the focal point of our offense. We’re going to rely on him to get it done for us, and he can.”\n\nOn Maggette’s role (via The Charlotte Observer):\n\n“He wants to play the 3, so that’s what he’s going to do. He wants to start, and that’s what he’s going to do. So we’re giving him everything he needs to be successful.”\n\nBucks guard Brandon Jennings on the addition of Stephen Jackson (via Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel):\n\n“I feel like we got a piece in here that can control the locker room, a vet that is well-respected and wants to win. And he won an NBA championship before (with San Antonio). And a guy I know personally before I even started hooping in the NBA. It’s just going to be great for us. He’s going to bring a lot of scoring here, something we missed last year.\n\n“And I think you’re just going to see a different Bucks team, overall. Just our attitude is going to be different and our passion.”\n\nFredette’s father Al on why Sacramento was attractive (via The Sacramento Bee):\n\n“He’s not used to people crowding up against him. But this is where he wants to be. He thinks he has an opportunity to get major playing time, and if you’re a competitor, you want playing time.”\n\nImage Credit:\n\nJimmer Fredette: via Getty Images/Ethan Miller\n\nTobias Harris: via Getty Images/Jonathan Daniel\n\nBismack Biyombo: via Getty Images/Streeter Lecka\n\nBeno Udrih: via US Presswire/Kim Klement\n\nCorey Maggette: via US Presswire/Sam Sharpe\n\nStephen Jackson: via MCT\n\nShaun Livingston: via AP\n\nJohn Salmons: via AP/Rich Pedroncelli"
