        "text": "NEW ORLEANS — The Washington Wizards found a way to win, making a miserable March a little more bearable.\n\nMike Miller scored a season-high 27 points and the Wizards snapped a franchise-record 16-game losing streak with a 96-91 victory over the New Orleans Hornets on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Wizards avoided an 0-17 March with their first win since beating New Jersey on Feb. 28. Andray Blatche scored 23 points, and Shaun Livingston added 18 for the short-handed Wizards, who played without four regulars but still led for the last 46 minutes. In addition to Gilbert Arenas, suspended for the season in January, Josh Howard (torn ACL), Randy Foye (wrist injury) and Al Thornton (hip flexor) were out of the lineup.\n\n“People were saying we were not going to get a win in March, and we got one,” Wizards guard Nick Young said. “We got that monkey off our back and we have to keep going.”\n\nDavid West had 18 points for the Hornets, coming off a home win against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday. Chris Paul added eight points and nine assists.\n\nWashington almost blew a 12-point lead in the last 4:20. After trailing 87-75, the Hornets had two chances to tie in the final 15.3 seconds, but James Posey missed a free throw and West was off target on a 3-point attempt.\n\nMiller’s two free throws sealed the victory with 4.4 seconds left.\n\n“We had a 5-point lead, and I said to myself, ‘Thank you, man, this streak is finally over,’” Blatche said. “We were tuned in and we made the right decisions.”\n\nWashington, which had a fourth-quarter lead at Houston on Tuesday before losing 98-94, was in control of this one almost all the way. The Wizards led by 4 at the half, 70-59 at the end of the third quarter and answered every Hornets run.\n\nAfter New Orleans pulled to 80-75 on a floater by Darren Collison, Miller drilled a 3-pointer, Livingston hit a mid-range jumper and Blatche converted two free throws to give Washington a 87-75 lead with 3:32 left.\n\nEven that advantage was not safe.\n\nThe Hornets went on an 11-2 run, closing the gap to 88-86 on a 3-pointer by Marcus Thornton. The Wizards went back up by 6 on baskets from Blatche and James Singleton, but the Hornets forced three consecutive turnovers in the final minute and had a chance to tie when Posey went to the free-throw line with 15.3 seconds left.\n\nHe missed the first foul shot, and Livingston’s free throws put Washington ahead 94-91 with 13.6 left.\n\nWest missed a contested 3-point attempt on the Hornets’ next possession, setting up Miller for his clinching foul shots."
