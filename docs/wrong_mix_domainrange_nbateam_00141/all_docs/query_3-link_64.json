        "text": "I agreed to do this diary because I believe there is a perspective that isn’t told enough. I recognize as much as anyone how special the talent is in the NBA. Some of my brothers in this amazing fraternity are marvels of the game. I understand the idea of getting caught up in the talent and mystique. But we are so much more than basketball players and there is so much more to life.\n\nEspecially on this team, the Golden State Warriors, we have a special group of guys. And part of that is because we have good people who are also spectacular basketball players. Life is about perspective, seeing all of this from the proper view point — from a healthy viewpoint.\n\nWhich is why I have to start this with something that really matters.\n\nI believe I speak for our teammates and coaches when I say our hearts are broken by the news that Erin Popovich died. My heart is with Pop. Yes, he is our opponent. But I feel for him. I feel for his family and his kids. To lose something that powerful is just tragic.\n\nSee. Perspective. We’re all consumed with what really is a child’s game. Don’t get me wrong. I am grateful for this game. We are able to take care of our families and make a life off of it. It’s changed my life and the life of my family, for sure. But we’re talking about somebody’s life. This man just lost his wife, his life partner of 40 years. You can’t duplicate or replicate that. In all honesty, life should be at a halt for him and his family because of this loss. But we’re going to continue on and be consumed by basketball because the reality is life keeps on happening.\n\nBut that’s why I love this team. We feel. We take the time to let life matter more than this fantasy we’re in. It starts with Bob Myers and Steve Kerr. They’re great at separating what matters in life from what matters in basketball.\n\nSo we are going to press on. We’ll go into Game 3 focused and ready to play. But we must value each other and recognize the humanity in each of us. So I offer my condolences to Popovich and I am in prayer for him and his family for their loss.\n\nIt’s going to be a spirited environment at the AT&T Center for Game 3. The crowd is always intense in this arena and the Spurs are a first-class organization who are always tough to beat at home. It’s going to be our first road game in these playoffs and Game 3s usually navigate the road map for the series.\n\nTruthfully, the passion to play at this level, that spark we need, is not always easy to find. You know. You’ve watched us this year. We haven’t always had it. Kerr has done a great job of pacing us. He has had the difficult task of fighting against complacency and also keeping us fresh. We’re fortunate as players that he has a good pulse of the team. He understands the grind, and the balance of staying fresh while striving to get better. Steph has also set a standard for our team with his passion and joy. He makes it a fun culture to be a part of and they both really set the tone for us.\n\nSo when we got together for Game 1, in the locker room and in the huddle, maaaaan. We had that appropriate fear. Nobody knows what’s going to happen. We’re all confident. We’ve won championships. But we haven’t lost like we did that last month or so of the season. That was something new for everybody. Many outside our locker room are thinking there is blood in the water. And, honestly, human nature makes us question, “Is blood in the water?”\n\nThe beauty of it, though, was how we responded. We played for each other. That’s where the passion comes from. That’s where we found our edge. You could see it. Everybody talks about the switch. At the end of the day, it’s a look in everybody’s eyes. In the locker room before the game, when we came together before taking the court, you could tell. We were ready. This was it. We knew we had to be there for each other. It was one of those moments where you’ve got to pinch yourself.\n\nThis is what it feels like. This is why you play. For these moments: It’s us or them.\n\nYeah, we’re able to have an awareness about us. We can step outside of our box. We see what’s happening in the world — the events, world politics, what Pop is going through. But what all that tells us is that what we have is something that doesn’t happen every day. You don’t get a combination of guys that care about each other, play for each other, and also are skilled enough to win at this level. It doesn’t happen every day. You have to take advantage of that moment because WHO KNOWS?!\n\nAt this point in my career that’s what it’s about. Finding the joy and the passion. And it comes from these guys. Playing with them. For them. My wife and my daughter. These are my motivations.\n\nNow, Game 2, the Spurs got after us. We came out how we were supposed to in Game 1 and kinda blitzed them. Game 2, they came out how they were supposed to play. That’s a real playoff game. They are so well coached. They put their group out there that was going to fight — and they did. We were able to take those punches and then make the adjustment in the second half. That’s playoff basketball. We know what that feels like. We know how to lean on each other in those times of adversity.\n\nThere was one play that really jumped out to me in the two games. It happened in the third quarter during Game 1, somewhere near the three-minute mark. We had created some separation and we were going for the knockout blow. Kevon Looney blocked a fadeaway by Kyle Anderson and got the rebound. He found me and we were off. I made my way to the middle and hit Draymond, he was streaking towards the lane. He drew the defense and kicked it back out to Klay in the corner. Bang. They called a timeout. I think we were up by 19. That was defense, pace, ball movement and unselfishness. That was Warriors basketball. It felt like we were back.\n\nBut with all the great runs and great performances, what really makes us special is what we saw from Zaza Pachulia and JaVale McGee. Z didn’t play a second in the first two games, but he showed all you need to know about him. He has championship pedigree — which means you do what’s in the best interest of the team. Coach pushes those buttons and he makes those decisions. If it were me, I wouldn’t want a DNP. I’m sure Z didn’t want one either. But instead of being, like, “This is bullshit,” he made the sacrifice and was supportive of his team. That’s championship pedigree. You’re playing for something bigger than yourself. I commend Z for taking that backseat and still staying ready, because you never know what can happen.\n\nAnd the guy who took his place in the starting lineup, JaVale, is a prime example of what it means to stay ready. No matter what, whether he’s playing or not playing, he is the first one off the bench during timeouts, greeting and encouraging his teammates. Him being able to get his shot now, to see him getting his shine, that’s the story.\n\nWhat makes us special is the kind of guys we have in that locker room. It’s an honor to be with this group on another pursuit of a ring.\n\n(Top illustration includes photo by Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty Images)"
