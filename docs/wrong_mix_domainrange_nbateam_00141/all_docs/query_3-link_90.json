        "text": "OAKLAND–This is a very level-headed Warriors squad, and the most level-headed (level-headedest?) of them all is probably Shaun Livingston, who has gone through so much more injury issues than anybody else in the NBA.\n\nSo it was good to sit down with him after the Warriors’ light practice today to chat about the season so far, the changes and new rhythms created by the addition of Kevin Durant, Livingston’s budding interest in a future front-office career and how much he thinks about Game 7 against the Cavaliers (and how badly he still wishes he played more in that game).\n\nWe also talked about Livingston’s pending free-agent status, his desire to play as long as he can, and the understanding that the Warriors also have a few other situations–namely, the pending free agencies of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.\n\nAnd Livingston’s long-range focus and passion came through loud and clear when he discussed his recent $1M to his childhood school in Peoria, Illinois, to fund an expansion in the name of two very important figures in his education, life and career.\n\nWhere did he find the faith and commitment to keep going through his devastating leg injury in 2007 and eight different NBA stops before landing with the Warriors in 2014 and turn into a key part of their championship run?\n\nYou can hear where. Just listen to him describe it."
