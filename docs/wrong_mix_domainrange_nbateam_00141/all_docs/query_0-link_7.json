        "text": "I know you’re nervous. I know you’re uneasy about this upcoming series.\n\nI get it. New Orleans has been one of the better teams since the end of the regular season. Anthony Davis is a superstar. One of the best players in the NBA and worth the price of admission. The way they just destroyed Portland in the first round, and how we’ve been battling injuries, I know that’s got you uneasy.\n\nBut let me assure you of this one thing: we love this.\n\nI do. I know the guys in the locker room do. This is the best time of year. It’s fun. It’s exciting. It’s the second round of the NBA playoffs. The way New Orleans is playing, coming in with a lot of momentum, this is the type of basketball people want to see.\n\nBut first, salute to San Antonio. That team forces you to play the right way. That’s part of why people alike have the ultimate respect for those guys. They don’t have the most talent on their team, but they compete and respect the game. And if you don’t, there is a price to pay against them.\n\nSo it’s about building our good habits for what’s to come. It’s understanding that, yes, we do have a lot of talent, but we’re capable of getting beat if we aren’t mindful of the little things. So, to me, that was a good matchup for us to set a tone for these playoffs.\n\nSteph said something Friday to the media that perfectly fit how I feel. He is fighting to get back on the court. Everybody is watching him, waiting on him, speculating about him. And I know he is dying to get back on the court. But he talked about the appreciation he has for his teammates and the pride he has in being part of this team. I know how he feels because it’s a layer of what our team has been built on the past four years.\n\nThen I see KD, carrying the extra weight and pressure with Steph being out. It’s a lot of attention on him, even more attention than you know. With him being one of the faces of the NBA, everything he does is under a microscope. The guys in this locker room, we just encourage people to be themselves. That’s part of why he came here, so he can be himself and just play basketball. (He’s pretty good at it! Lol) I think the growth has come even more for him at just trying to encourage guys, staying with guys, staying positive. Those things are just as important as getting buckets. It’s easy money out here with him, but with the other 12-13 guys, there’s some hard-earned money in the bank.\n\nFor example …\n\nKevon Looney, one time, he had a turnover off of a pick-and-roll with KD. I think it was Game 1. And K stayed in his ear, kept him positive and telling him to stay aggressive after the turnover. Those things pay dividends to a teammate’s confidence, especially a young player. So if you encourage him on the offensive end, it’s going to help him do a better job at what he really does best — defend.\n\nThat’s just a little insight into the team and how the veterans operate. It’s all about staying positive and encouraging each other. That’s our responsibility as veterans. Steady the ship by bringing a mentality to encourage guys and keep them focused on what we’re trying to get accomplished. Andre, David as well, we help carry out the game plan. We’re an extension of the coaches on the court trying to keep everybody locked in.\n\nSo much of this is mental. We’re in the playoffs, so the intensity and the effort will be there. But it’s about who can still think, keep a steady head, on the court.\n\nAs far as off the court, family time is huge! That’s how I recharge the batteries. Steve is always talking about filling up the cup. It’s crucial during these times because the playoffs is a whole other beast — not physically but mentally.\n\nIt felt good to get back with the little one. After being on the road, coming home and seeing her smile as I walk in the house is priceless. The joy I get from that is irreplaceable. But getting outside to get some sun and fresh air with the fam is really all it takes.\n\nI had some daytime fun with the wife, too. Called the sitter, hit up Grand Lake Theater and caught a flick. That’s our favorite spot because it’s by the lake and we’re right in the mix. So, yeah, we enjoy that whole area. We went to see “A Quiet Place.” That movie was scary as hell! But good, so if you haven’t seen it …\n\nWelllllllll, the batteries are recharged. So it’s GO TIME. Again.\n\nIt’s fine that you’re a little nervous. Just know this — we love this time of year. You should, too."
