He played college basketball for the Xavier Musketeers, earning National College Player of the Year honors from the Associated Press (AP) and United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) as a senior in 2003. West is a two–time NBA All–Star (2008 and 2009) and a two–time NBA champion (2017 and 2018).\n\nHigh school and college career[]\n\nWest attended Garner Magnet High School in Garner, North Carolina and Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia. As a senior in 1998–99, he earned First–team All–State honors playing for Hargrave.\n\nIn his freshman season at Xavier, West was named to the Atlantic 10 All–Rookie Team after leading the A–10 in rebounding (9.1) and finishing fourth on the Musketeers in scoring (11.7).\n\nIn his sophomore season, West led Xavier in scoring (17.8 ppg), rebounding (10.9 rpg, tops in A–10 and fourth nationally), and blocks (2.1 bpg). He recorded five 20–point, 20–rebound games throughout the 2000–01 season as he earned his first A–10 Player of the Year Award.\n\nIn his junior season, West was named the A–10 Player of the Year and the league's Defensive Player of the Year, while also winning A–10 Tournament MVP honors. He averaged 9.8 rebounds (26th in nation) and 2.5 blocks (22nd in nation) per game, and recorded the first triple–double in school history with 15 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists against Long Island University.\n\nIn his senior season, West garnered two of the five major college basketball Player of the Year honors, being named AP National Player of the Year and National Player of the Year by the United States Basketball Writers Association. He became the first three–time Atlantic 10 Player of the Year, and was named first–team All–America by the Associated Press in 2002–03. In addition, he became just the third player in Xavier history to surpass 2,000 points and only the second to eclipse 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds, joining Tyrone Hill.\n\nIn October 2007, Sports Illustrated released Sports Illustrated: The Basketball Book, which featured West on its NCAA All–Decade Team for the decade beginning in 2000. He was joined by Connecticut's Emeka Okafor and three Duke players, Jay Williams, JJ Redick, and Shane Battier.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nNew Orleans Hornets (2003–2011)[]\n\nWest was drafted by the New Orleans Hornets with the 18th overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. After recording modest production in his first two seasons, in 2005–06, West enjoyed a breakthrough as he averaged 17.4 points and 7.4 rebounds with a .512 FG% in 74 games. That year, he finished second in the voting for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, behind Boris Diaw of the Phoenix Suns. He also saw some time at Center, due to the team's lack of a true big man and demonstrated an ability to perform under pressure, as he converted three game–winning jump shots.\n\nIn 2006–07, West ended the season averaging 18.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game. Despite missing 30 games due to an elbow injury, West recorded five games of 30 or more points and 13 games of 20 or more points.\n\nWest again increased his statistical production in 2007–08, and was selected to his first NBA All–Star Game as a reserve, along with teammate Chris Paul. Paul later stated that he would rather not play with a Power Forward in the league other than West, because \"he's not in it for the spotlight, all he cares about is getting buckets [scoring].\" West reinforced his desire to be a team player in a 2008 postseason interview, saying that he does not care about being overlooked, but would rather \"play and be as effective as possible\" when he is out on the court.\n\nIn 2008–09, West repeated as an All–Star and posted a new career high by scoring 21.0 points per game.\n\nOn March 25, 2011, during one of the Hornets' last games of the season against the Utah Jazz, West came down awkwardly after a dunk. The event occurred with 22.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter. West tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and was ruled out for the rest of the season.\n\nOn June 27, 2011, West opted out of the final year of his contract to become a free agent.\n\nIndiana Pacers (2011–2015)[]\n\nOn December 13, 2011, West signed a two–year, $20 million contract with the Indiana Pacers. On April 21, 2012, West led the Pacers in scoring with 32 points and rebounding with 12 rebounds during a 109–106 overtime loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nOn January 12, 2013, West recorded his first career triple–double with 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists in the 96–88 win over the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, West re–signed with the Pacers to a three–year, $36.6 million contract. In June 2015, he opted out of his contract with the Pacers to become a free agent.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (2015–2016)[]\n\nOn July 17, 2015, West signed with the San Antonio Spurs. He made his debut for the Spurs in the team's season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on October 28, recording 8 points and 2 rebounds off the bench in a 112–106 loss. On January 6, 2016, West, starting in place of LaMarcus Aldridge, recorded season–highs of 18 points and 13 rebounds in a 123–98 win over the Utah Jazz, helping the Spurs extend its franchise–record home winning streak to 30 straight regular–season games dating to 2014–15.\n\nGolden State Warriors (2016–2018)[]\n\nOn July 9, 2016, West signed with the Golden State Warriors. West emerged as a key bench player for the Warriors, particularly for his skilled passing abilities. Throughout January and February 2017, West missed 14 games with a non–displaced fracture in his left thumb. On March 29, 2017, West recorded a season–high 15 points and a game–high plus-23 in a large comeback win against the San Antonio Spurs. The Warriors finished the season as the first seed in the West with a 67–15 record. Following a 129–115 victory in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals over the Spurs, the Warriors were undefeated in the first three playoff series, reaching their third straight NBA Finals series. West played in every playoff game, as the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–1 in the 2017 NBA Finals. The Warriors' 16–1 playoff record was the best ever postseason winning percentage in NBA history.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, after winning his first championship ring, West re–signed with the Warriors for one more year, with expectations to retire after the 2017–18 season. On January 8, 2018, in a 124–114 win over the Denver Nuggets, West became the 127th player in NBA history to play in 1,000 regular–season games, recording 10 points, six rebounds, and four assists. After reaching that milestone, he noted that he might consider signing again for the 2018–19 season, saying, \"It all depends on how my body feels. Right now I feel good.\" The Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight season, where they won their second straight championship with a four–game sweep of the Cavaliers, giving West his second NBA championship.\n\nRetirement[]\n\nWest announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons on August 30, 2018.\n\nCareer statistics[]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high † Won an NBA championship\n\nNBA[]\n\nRegular season[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2003–04 New Orleans 71 1 13.1 .474 .000 .713 4.2 .8 .4 .4 3.8 2004–05 New Orleans 30 8 18.4 .436 .400 .680 4.3 .8 .4 .5 6.2 2005–06 New Orleans 74 74 34.1 .512 .273 .843 7.4 1.2 .8 .9 17.1 2006–07 New Orleans 52 52 36.5 .476 .320 .824 8.2 2.2 .8 .7 18.3 2007–08 New Orleans 76 76 37.8 .482 .240 .850 8.9 2.3 .8 1.3 20.6 2008–09 New Orleans 76 76 39.2 .472 .240 .884 8.5 2.3 .6 .9 21.0 2009–10 New Orleans 81 81 36.4 .505 .259 .865 7.5 3.0 .9 .7 19.0 2010–11 New Orleans 70 70 35.0 .508 .222 .807 7.6 2.3 1.0 .9 18.9 2011–12 Indiana 66* 66* 29.2 .487 .222 .807 6.6 2.1 .8 .7 12.8 2012–13 Indiana 73 73 33.4 .498 .211 .768 7.7 2.9 1.0 .9 17.1 2013–14 Indiana 80 80 30.9 .488 .267 .789 6.8 2.8 .8 .9 14.0 2014–15 Indiana 66 66 28.7 .471 .200 .739 6.8 3.4 .7 .7 11.7 2015–16 San Antonio 78 19 18.0 .545 .429 .788 4.0 1.8 .6 .7 7.1 2016–17† Golden State 68 0 12.6 .536 .375 .768 3.0 2.2 .6 .7 4.6 2017–18† Golden State 73 0 13.7 .571 .375 .759 3.3 1.9 .6 1.0 6.8 Career 1,034 742 28.2 .495 .265 .817 6.4 2.2 .7 .8 13.6 All–Star 2 0 15.0 .545 .000 .000 3.5 .5 .5 .0 6.0\n\nPlayoffs[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2004 New Orleans 7 0 15.9 .536 – .846 4.3 1.1 .3 .6 5.9 2008 New Orleans 12 12 40.4 .466 .500 .891 8.5 2.8 1.1 1.9 21.2 2009 New Orleans 5 5 35.6 .400 – .897 7.4 1.2 1.0 .4 18.0 2012 Indiana 11 11 37.8 .446 – .818 8.5 2.0 .7 .5 15.3 2013 Indiana 19 19 36.3 .462 .000 .766 7.6 2.1 .7 .8 15.9 2014 Indiana 18 18 36.3 .483 .222 .705 6.9 4.1 .8 .8 15.1 2016 San Antonio 10 0 17.6 .455 .500 .556 3.7 1.3 .6 .7 5.8 2017† Golden State 17 0 13.0 .576 .500 .778 2.7 2.1 .4 .8 4.5 2018† Golden State 18 0 9.7 .600 .500 1.000 2.1 1.8 .3 .6 3.3 Career 118 66 26.6 .476 .320 .796 5.6 2.2 .6 .8 11.3\n\nCollege[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1999–00 Xavier 33 33 29.4 .532 .000 .667 9.1 1.7 1.6 1.1 11.7 2000–01 Xavier 29 29 33.7 .551 .000 .740 10.9 2.0 1.4 2.1 17.8 2001–02 Xavier 32 32 34.2 .536 .321 .768 9.8 1.6 1.2 2.5 18.3 2002–03 Xavier 32 32 36.5 .513 .346 .816 11.8 3.2 1.3 1.6 20.1 Career 126 126 33.4 .531 .327 .757 10.4 2.1 1.4 1.8 16.9\n\nExecutive career[]\n\nIn November 2018, West became the first Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Historical Basketball League (HBL), a college basketball league set to launch in 2020. The HBL later changed its name to The Professional Collegiate League, with West explaining that the organization produces a more equitable system to \"challenge the exploitation at the collegiate basketball level. ... Predominantly young black men, working, not being paid for their labor, and that labor being directly, monetarily beneficial for everyone but them.\"\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nWest is the son of Amos and Harriet West. He and his wife Lesley have one daughter, Dasia, and one son, David Benjamin.\n\nWest is very interested in education, \"black history, philosophy and various societal issues\". He also loves to make mixtapes for his teammates, saying that it is a healthy habit that keeps him \"in the house and off [his] feet\".\n\nWest has a Xavier \"X\" tattooed on his arm which displays, on either side, \"My life, my way\".\n\nPolitical views[]\n\nIn mid–2019, West appeared as a panelist and commentator on The Young Turks political news program to discuss Juneteenth.\n\nIn a July 2020 interview with Black Agenda Report, West lamented the lack of understanding about China among Americans and denounced anti–China foreign policy hawks as \"warmongers.\" Regarding the NBA's rift with China following Daryl Morey's tweet supporting the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, West stated that the Hong Kong issue is more complicated than how it is portrayed in the American media, and that he contacted NBA players to caution them about being used as political pawns against China, stating: \"I got on the phone with a bunch of NBA guys, and I was like 'Don't let them pull you into this bullshit, because it's the Iraq war-, weapons of mass destruction–type propaganda again.\" Regarding the manner in which China is presented in the American media, West stated: \"As people in the world, as Americans and people in American society, we have been misled.\""
