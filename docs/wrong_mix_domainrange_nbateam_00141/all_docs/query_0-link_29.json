        "text": "Even though these teams aren’t that close on paper, expect a tough game tonight when the Golden State Warriors head to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans. While they are indeed playing without Anthony Davis, the Pelicans aren’t going to just let the Warriors waltz in for an easy win.\n\nDue to the absence of Zaza Pachulia (injured shoulder) and Shaun Livingston (suspension) our starting lineup and bench units are all going to look a little different tonight. Steph Curry’s hand still looks like it’s transforming into a mummy, so expect heavy minutes for Patrick McCaw and Andre Iguodala as they share ball handling duties.\n\nIt was just announced that Javale McGee will get the start in place of Zaza.\n\nAs you may have heard by now, Shaun Livingston was suspended over some bullsh.... a weird interaction with a referee during last night’s game. I’m not going to pretend like Livingston is blameless, but let’s just say that I am please to see the NBA suspend the referee as well. Livingston’s suspension was automatic since he made contact with the referee - the inclusion of a suspension for the ref at least signals that the league understands he was partly to blame for the flare-up.\n\nCenter Zaza Pachulia was also a late scratch, as the team moved him from “questionable” to “out” about an hour and a half before tipoff.\n\nZaza has always played a critical role in frustrating Demarcus Cousins into a bad night. The Pelicans are without star Anthony Davis for a while, so this isn’t as bad as it could have been for the Warriors, but he will be missed.\n\nStill, great opportunity for Javale!"
