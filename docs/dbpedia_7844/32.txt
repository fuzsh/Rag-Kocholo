The anterior tibial recurrent artery is an artery that connects with the genicular network after coursing in an upward direction through the leg. It forms the patellar plexus by connecting with the highest genicular artery and the genicular branches of the popliteal artery.

The anterior tibial recurrent artery branches off of the anterior tibial artery in the interosseous (between bones) space. It is reinforced on the front and sides of the joint of the knee. It also serves as a secondary blood supply to the knee.
