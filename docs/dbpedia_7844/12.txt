The anterior tibial recurrent artery (Latin: arteria recurrens tibialis anterior) is a branch of the anterior tibial artery. It contributes to supplying the knee joint. The artery ascends to the popliteal fossa and joins the patellar network, where it anastomoses with other blood vessels forming this network.

The patellar network is located around and above the patella. The blood vessels contributing to this network are as follows: inferior medial and superior medial genicular arteries, inferior lateral and superior lateral genicular arteries, descending genicular artery, descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, and the anterior tibial recurrent artery. The patellar network supplies the knee joint and provides collateral circulation to the leg.
