Recurrent branch of anterior tibial artery

- Discussion:

- normally separates from the anterior tibial artery as it perforates the interosseous foramen;

- this branch heads superiorly and in the direction of patellar tendon, supplying the skin overlying patellar tendon,

- supplies the anterior aspect of the knee, the superior tibiofibular joint, and the lateral condyle of the tibia;

- contributes to the patellar plexus thru its anastomosis w/ inferior medial and inferior lateral genicular arteries;

- See genicular artery system
