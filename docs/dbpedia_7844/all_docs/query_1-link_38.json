        "text": "Lower Limb\n\nRui Diogo, Drew M. Noden, Christopher M. Smith, Julia Molnar, Julia C. Boughner, Claudia Barrocas, Joana Bruno in Understanding Human Anatomy and Pathology, 2018\n\nAfter giving rise to these branches, the popliteal artery runs as the single major artery in the proximal region of the leg. So now, there is the opposite problem that occurs with the femoral artery at the thigh: The femoral artery lies anteriorly in the thigh, and therefore it has to do a “trick”—giving rise to the deep femoral artery—to supply the posterior side of the thigh; in contrast, the popliteal artery lies posteriorly on the leg, and thus it has to do a “trick” to go to the anterior side of the leg to give blood supply to the anterior leg muscles and surrounding tissues. The “trick” is a bifurcation of the popliteal artery in the proximal leg, giving rise to the anterior tibial artery (which pierces the interosseous membrane to enter the anterior side of the leg: Plate 5.9) and to the posterior tibial artery (which continues on the posterior side of the leg: Plate 5.11). The posterior tibial artery subsequently—more distally—gives rise to the fibular artery. The configuration of the blood vessels of the leg is thus remarkably different from that seen in the forearm. As can be seen in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 and Plates 5.9 and 5.11, the anterior tibial artery runs together with the deep fibular nerve in the center of the anterior compartment of the leg, while the posterior tibial artery runs together with the tibial nerve through the center of the posterior compartment of the leg. The fibular artery runs mainly alone in the lateral region of the posterior compartment of the leg, whereas the superficial fibular nerve runs mainly alone through the lateral compartment of the leg.\n\nVenous malformation as source of a tarsal tunnel syndrome: treat the source or the cause of the complaints? A case report\n\nPublished in Acta Chirurgica Belgica, 2018\n\nH. Mufty, G. A. Matricali, S. Thomis\n\nOn physical examination, we have a normal weight patient (body mass index of 23.37). The presence of varicosis veins was seen on the right medial lower limb and foot (Figure 1). This was accompanied by discrete edema of the foot. No other skin changes were present. His lower extremities were well perfused with bilateral normal pulses. Clinical examination did not show sensory or motor deficits. However, a positive Tinel’s sign, evoking a needle sensation by slightly tapping the tibial nerve path, was noted. Venous duplex revealed a sufficient vena saphena magna bilateral without evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The varicosis veins in the right lower limb were partially thrombosed. New LMWH was administered and compressive stockings class two were prescribed. After two weeks, a positive evolution was noticed. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which illustrated an extensive venous malformation in the whole right lower limb. The largest component was seen anteromedian subcutaneously with a deeper connection towards the fibular artery and posterior tibial artery. There were both a muscular component, with ingrowth in the posterior tibial muscle, flexor hallucis longus muscle and flexor digitorum longus muscle, and osseous component with ingrowth in the tibial diaphyse."
