        "text": "- See posterior tibial artery\n\n- Anatomy:\n\n- anterior tibial artery passes from behind through gap above interosseous membrane to enter anterior compartment of leg and supply its muscles;\n\n- as it crosses membrane, it gives off a recurrent branch;\n\n- ref: The risk of injury to anterior tibial artery in posterolateral approach to the tibia plateau: A cadaver study.\n\n- it continues on dorsum of foot as dorsalis pedis artery, which gives off medial and lateral tarsal branches;\n\n- ends by dividing into arcuate artery and the larger deep plantar artery;\n\n- arcuate artery has three metatarsal branches that, in turn, divide into dorsal digital arteries;\n\n- deep plantar artery sends digital branches to great toe and second toe and passes between heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle to the plantar surface;\n\n- Exposure:\n\n- anterior tibial artery is exposed thru a longitudinal incision in lateral calf over the mid portion of anterior compartment;\n\n- dense fascia of the anterior compartment is incised and dissection deepened between the bellies of the long extensors;\n\n- tibialis anterior and EHL muscle bodies are frequently fused, and neurovascular bundle is usually exposed between these and the extensor digitorum muscle;\n\n- here artery, its paired tibial veins, and the tibial nerve lie along surface of the interosseous membrane;\n\n- presence of a dorsalis pedis pulse does not rule out injury to A.T.A., since there may be retrograde blood flow from posterior tibial artery\n\nPrevalence and surgical significance of a high-origin anterior tibial artery.\n\nArterial injury complicating knee disruption. Third place winner: Conrad Jobst award.\n\nSuccessful management of trifurcation injuries.\n\nArteriography in club foot.\n\nOptimal management of tibial arterial trauma.\n\nOptimal management of tibial arterial trauma.\n\nTraumatic popliteal and trifurcation vascular injuries: determinants of functional limb salvage.\n\nMicroarterial anatomy of the lesser toe proximal interphalangeal joints."
