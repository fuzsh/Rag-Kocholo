        "text": "Origin\n\nAt the distal margin of the popliteus muscle, the popliteal artery bifurcates into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. However, the terminal bifurcation of the popliteal artery may occur proximal to popliteus muscle, or occasionally, it may trifurcate directly into the anterior and posterior tibial and fibular arteries (Standring, 2016).\n\nThe ratio of the diameter of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries may vary. In general, the posterior tibial artery is the larger of the two tibial arteries. The caliber of the fibular artery is inversely proportionate to the size of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.\n\nCourse\n\nThe posterior tibial artery travels distally in a medial direction and lies deep to gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and the transverse intermuscular septum. It descends over the tibialis posterior muscle, then between the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus muscles.\n\nThe posterior tibial artery continues distally, deep to the flexor retinaculum and accompanied by, from medial to lateral, the tendons of tibialis posterior and digitorum longus muscles, tibial nerve, and the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle.\n\nDistally, its terminal bifurcation occurs deep to abductor hallucis muscle, near the mid-point between the medial malleolus of the tibia and the calcaneal tubercle of the calcaneus. It divides into the medial and lateral plantar arteries.\n\nSupplied Structures\n\nThe posterior tibial artery provides the bulk of the vascular supply to the deep muscles of the posterior compartments of the leg, including tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus. It also supplies the soleus muscle.\n\nIt contributes to the supply of the knee joint, tibia, and fibula, ankle joint, and calcaneus, as well as the connective tissue structures and the overlying cutaneous tissue."
