Popliteal artery\n\n2,1. Overview\n\nOrigin\n\nContinuation of femoral artery after it passes through the adductor hiatus\n\nCourse\n\nRuns through popliteal fossa\n\nPasses between gastrocnemius heads\n\nBecomes the tibiofibular trunk, after giving rise to the anterior tibial artery\n\nBranches\n\nAnterior tibial artery\n\nDistribution\n\nPopliteal fossa\n\nKnee joint\n\n2,2. Major branches of popliteal artery\n\nCourseBranchesDistributionAnterior tibial artery\n\nBranch of popliteal artery\n\nAccompanied by two veins and, in its inferior aspect, by deep peroneal nerve\n\nPasses through interosseous membrane of leg and courses on its anterior aspect\n\nPasses posterior to extensor hallucis longus tendon\n\nBecomes the dorsalis pedis artery\n\nPosterior + anterior tibial recurrent artery\n\nLateral + medial anterior malleolar artery\n\nDorsalis pedis artery (terminal branch of anterior tibial artery)\n\nAnterior lower leg\n\nDorsum of foot\n\nFrom a surgical viewpoint, it is customary to divide the popliteal artery into three segments (P1–P3) which determine the surgical access routes:\n\nSegment\n\nFeature\n\nAccess\n\nP1\n\nFrom adductor hiatus to the top of the patella\n\nDistal medial thigh\n\nP2\n\nFrom top of the patella to center of the knee joint\n\nPosterior (popliteal fossa)\n\nP3\n\nFrom center of the knee joint to anterior tibial artery origin\n\nProximal medial lower leg\n\nThe popliteal artery lies in a nerve-vascular (NV) bundle encased in fatty connective tissue. In segments P1 and P2, the artery is anteromedial to the popliteal vein, while in segment P3, it is surrounded by its accompanying veins. The tibial and common peroneal nerves lie posterolateral to the popliteal artery and vein. In the popliteal fossa, the nerves follow a rather superficial course, which must be taken into account when exposing the popliteal artery from the posterior aspect.\n\nThe superficial and deep lymphatic drainage is bundled in the popliteal fossa via three to five perivenous lymph nodes.\n\nDue to its location, the popliteal artery is subjected to considerable mechanical loading, which is why, as a muscular-type artery, it has strong muscle and fiber layers (tunica media vasis, internal elastic membrane. Its mural characteristics thus resemble those of central elastic arteries.\n\n3. Posterior tibial artery\n\n3,1. Overview"
