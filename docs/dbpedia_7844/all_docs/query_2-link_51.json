It accounts for <1% of all knee injuries.\n\nThe typical mechanism of injury is a fall onto an adducted and flexed knee. They can also occur as a result of high-energy trauma.\n\nCommon clinical features include inability to weight-bear, lateral knee pain and tenderness/prominence of the fibular head."
