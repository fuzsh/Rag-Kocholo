        "text": "Introduction: Tibial intramedullary nailing remains a common tibial fracture fixation method. Tibial nailing indications continue to expand. Neurovascular complications from tibial nailing have been described; however, the proximity of distal tibial locking bolts to the anterior tibial artery (ATA) variants has not. Materials and Methods: 52 cadaveric legs were dissected identifying three common ATA variants. Each ATA variant received an intraluminal wire to facilitate fluoroscopic identification. Three different intramedullary tibial nails were inserted in each of the three ATA variant specimens. With fluoroscopy, the proximity of the distal locking holes of each tibial nail to the intraluminal wire representing the ATA variant course was measured. Results: Of the 40 measurements, the intraluminal wire was directly in the bolt insertional path in 8 of 40 (20%) and within 5 mm in 16 of 40 (40%). All specimens had the wire cross the locking bolt insertional path at least once in each...\n\nThe posterior tibial artery normally arises from tibial-fibular trunk at the popliteal fossa, together with the fibular artery. The classic course of the posterior tibial artery is to run between the triceps surae muscle and muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg before continuing its course posteriorly to the medial malleolus, while the fibular artery runs through the lateral margin of the leg. Studies of both arteries are relevant to the fields of angiology, vascular surgery and plastic surgery. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of an anastomosis between the posterior tibial artery and the fibular artery in their distal course. The two arteries joined in an unusual \" X \" format, before division of the posterior tibial artery into plantar branches. We also provide a literature review of unusual variations and assess the clinical and embryological aspects of both arteries in order to contribute to further investigations regarding these vessels. Resumo A artéria tibial posterior e a artéria fibular se originam do tronco tibiofibular, na fossa poplítea. A trajetória clássica da artéria tibial posterior é correr entre o tríceps sural e os músculos do compartimento posterior da perna, e, então, seguir posteriormente ao maléolo medial. Já a artéria fibular corre na margem lateral da perna, seguindo profundamente aos músculos. O estudo dessas artérias é relevante para o campo da angiologia, cirurgia vascular e cirurgia plástica. O presente trabalho é o primeiro relato de caso de uma anastomose entre ambas artérias, na porção distal de suas trajetórias. Tais artérias se anastomosaram em formato de \" X \" , antes da divisão da artéria tibial posterior em ramos plantares. Foi feita uma revisão de literatura das variações de tais artérias, dando ênfase ao aspecto clínico e embriológico, de modo a contribuir para novas investigações sobre esses vasos.

The furthest posterolateral corridor described in the distal tibia is through the fibula. This limits the crossing angle and stability of the frame. In this paper we describe a new, safe Retro-Fibular Wire corridor, which provides greater crossing angles and increased stability. In a cadaver study, 20 formalin-treated legs were divided into two groups. Wires were inserted into the distal quarter of the tibia using two possible corridors and standard techniques of dissection identified the distance of the wires from neurovascular structures. In both groups the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle was avoided. In group A the peroneal artery was at risk. In group B this injury was avoided. Comparison of the groups showed a significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). We recommend the Retro-Fibular wire technique whereby wires are inserted into the tibia mid-way between the post...\n\nAim To perform an in-depth review of the safe vascular corridor around the femur in order to decrease possible vascular injury. Background Despite regular use of half pins in the femur, there is no region entirely safe for percutaneous pin placement. Damage to a major nerve or vessel must be avoided at all costs. Vascular complications during Ilizarov fixator surgery to the femur are rare but serious. Case description Of 306 cases of Ilizarov fixation to the femur in the period from 2002 to 2016, two cases had vascular complications. The first case developed a delayed superficial femoral artery (SFA) pseudoaneurysm and the second case sustained an early deep femoral artery (SFA) injury. Conclusion The in-depth review of the vascular anatomy around the femur with relevance to the placement of half pins indicates that the femoral shaft segment greatest at risk to lead to a vascular injury lies between the two points: 8 and 24 cm proximal to the adductor tubercle.
