        "text": "The anterior tibial artery (ATA) is at risk of injury during high tibial osteotomy, Ilizarov wire placement, pin placement in external fixation, or proximal locking screw insertion, as the artery is not visualized intraoperatively. The ATA is anchored to the oval foramen of the interosseous membrane on the proximal tibia by the deep fascia and recurrent genicular vascular branches. Segment 1 (from the bifurcation of the popliteal artery to the level of the interosseous foramen) and the proximal part of segment 2 (from the interosseous foramen to the level where the artery crosses the anterior border of the tibia) may be damaged when pin, wire or screw placement is directed posterolaterally at that level. Distally, a straight mediolateral pin or Ilizarov wires may lacerate the artery. Segment 2 of the ATA descends against the interosseous membrane in its proximal part, which is projected on the posterior third of the tibia relative to the sagittal plane; in its middle part, it runs close to the lateral cortex of the tibia, it is projected on the middle third of the tibia; in its distal part it runs gradually towards the anterior third of the tibia and contacts with the anterior third of the tibial cortical surface. This information may help reduce risk of injury to the ATA during high tibial osteotomy, external fixation and pin placement or insertion of locking screws."
