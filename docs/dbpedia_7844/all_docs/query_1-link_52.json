The most frequently observed abnormalities are the early bifurcation of the common or superficial femoral artery (Fig. 13.6) and the early origin of the tibial artery from the popliteal segment (Fig. 13.7).\n\nThe persistent sciatic artery is a rare congenital vascular anomaly occurring in approximately 0.025 to 0.04% of the population. The sciatic artery supplies blood during the early stages of embryonic development and regresses to form the proximal part of the inferior gluteal artery after the third month of embryonic life following the development of the femoral artery from the external iliac artery (Mandell et al., 1985) (Fig. 13.8). Patients with persistent sciatic arteries may be asymptomatic or have a painful pulsatile gluteal mass due to the development of an aneurysm (which occurs in approximately 46% of cases) or possible embolic events. (Fung et al., 2008).\n\n13.2 13.2 CTA Technique\n\nPatient Preparation\n\nSupine position, feet first;\n\nLegs close to each other with a slight internal rotation of the feet;\n\nPeripheral venous access (at least 18 G);\n\nRemove any metal material present in the abdomen and legs.\n\nImage Acquisition\n\nAcquire topogram on a coronal plane and place the scan volume (from the diaphragm to the feet; approximately 130 cm longitudinal extension).\n\nPlace the region of interest (RoI) on the suprarenal abdominal aorta, avoiding possible calcifications of the vessel wall (if a bolus tracking technique is used); start the scan when a 150–200 Hounsfield Unit value is reached. If an aortic aneurysm is present, the RoI may be placed within the dilated lumen in order to reach optimal opacification of the aneurysm and avoid image acquisition too early compared to contrast medium circulation (the presence of an aneurysm may in fact cause flow turbulence that leads to contrast medium dilution).\n\nAcquire images in the craniocaudal direction. Achieving adequate and uniform arterial opacification for the entire duration of the CT scan is critical for diagnostic quality CT angiography. When scanning the peripheral arteries it is mandatory to have (Tables 13.5–13.6):\n\na fast injection rate (at least 4 mL/s) with multi-detector scanners (from 64 to 128 MDCT, dual source MDCT);\n\nhigh iodine concentration contrast agents (370–400 mgI/mL);\n\nan optimal scan duration (about 38–40 s).\n\n4 MDCT\n\n16 MDCT\n\n64 MDCT\n\n128 MDCT\n\nDual source\n\nkVp\n\n120\n\n120\n\n120\n\n120\n\n120\n\nmAs\n\n140\n\n160\n\n190*\n\n190*\n\n190*\n\nCollimation\n\n4 × 2.5\n\n16 × 1.5\n\n64 × 0.6\n\n128 × 0.6\n\n64 × 0.6 × 2\n\nSlice thickness (mm)\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nRecon increment (mm)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nCm\n\n4 MDCT\n\n16 MDCT\n\n64 MDCT\n\n128 MDCT\n\nDual source\n\nConcentration (mgI/mL)\n\n370-400\n\n370-400\n\n370-400\n\n370-400\n\n370-400\n\nVolume (mL)\n\n125\n\n120\n\n115\n\n115\n\n115\n\nSaline solution volume (mL)\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\nFlow rate (mL/s)\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n4.5\n\n4.5\n\n4.5\n\nThe scan duration is fundamental in order to obtain optimal opacification of the arteries, in particular at the distal level where vessels are very small and can be difficult to evaluate in case of severe disease.\n\nIn fact, when a late scan is performed, there will be poor opacification of the arteries and enhancement of the veins, thus affecting the diagnostic quality of the images; contrarily, an early scan can cause poor opacification of the arteries due to the lack of iodine in the distal vessels (Fig. 13.9). In these latter cases, performing a delayed caudocranial scan can help in recovering previously missed data; this can be helpful in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease (severe stenosis or aneurysms) or with a vascular prosthesis such as bypass.\n\nHowever, sometimes asymmetric arterial opacification or venous overlap between the two legs is inevitable because of diseases causing unilateral delay (Fig. 13.10) or acceleration of the patient’s circulation (Fig. 13.11).\n\n13.3 13.3 MRA Technique\n\nPatient Preparation\n\nSupine position, feet first;\n\nPeripheral venous access (at least 20–22 G);\n\nRemove any metal material present in the abdomen and legs;\n\nSuperficial coils for the abdomen and legs.\n\nImage Acquisition\n\nTime of Flight (ToF) Sequences\n\nThese sequences remain well validated and useful primarily in the distal runoff vessels (Fig. 13.12). (Cambria et al., 1997; Ho KY et al., 1997). The main limitations are (Table 13.7):\n\nlong acquisition times;\n\nsignal loss due to turbulent flow or wrong positioning of the scan volume;\n\nflow void or ghosting due to saturation artifacts or pulsatility.\n\nAcquire localizer on three planes;\n\nPlace the scan volume on a transversal plane (flow direction must be perpendicular to that of the sequence).\n\nTR (ms)\n\n30\n\nTE (ms)\n\n3.9\n\nFoV (mm)\n\n180 × 140\n\nSlice thickness (mm)\n\n1\n\nMatrix\n\n256 × 224\n\nAcquisition time (min)\n\n5\n\nT1-Weighted 3D Gradient-Echo (GRE) Sequences\n\nThese sequences are most often used thanks to their high spatial and contrast resolution that enables diagnostic accuracy similar to that of conventional angiography.\n\nThey also can be used together with time-resolved sequences in a so-called hybrid protocol.\n\nThe parameters for contrast administration are summarized in Table 13.8; technical parameters of T1 GRE 3D sequences are shown in Table 13.9.dfdfdfd\n\nConcentration (M)\n\n0.5\n\nVolume (mL)\n\n15\n\n(0.2 mL/kg)\n\nSaline solution volume (mL)\n\n20\n\nFlow rate (mL/s)\n\n1.5-2\n\nAbdomen\n\nLegs\n\nFeet\n\nTR (ms)\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nTE (ms)\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1.4\n\nFlip angle\n\n25°\n\n25°\n\n25°\n\nSlice thickness (mm)\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\nMatrix\n\n384 × 384\n\n384 × 384\n\n512 × 512\n\nAcquisition time (s)\n\n15\n\n16\n\n21\n\nThree-Step Protocols\n\nAcquire a localizer on three planes in the abdomen, thigh, and calf region;\n\nAcquire a GRE 3D as a pre-contrast mask on the coronal plane for each region;\n\nUse a fluoro-MR sequence to visualize the contrast agent arrival;\n\nAcquire the contrast-enhanced sequence (GRE 3D) identical to the mask when the abdominal aorta is enhanced. Images are acquired for all three regions in the craniocaudal direction;\n\nSubtract the last-acquired sequence from the mask.\n\nHybrid Protocol (Fig. 13.13)\n\nThe combination of a standard bolus-chase MRA and time-resolved sequences offers a valuable alternative for the assessment of the vascular status of patients with asymmetric circulation in the peripheral arteries or when an optimal arterial phase of the distal vessels is required (i.e. in diabetic patients), allowing, moreover, the visualization of small collateral vessels not identified at the first pass.\n\nAcquire time-resolved MRA of the calf and foot on a coronal plane by injecting a small bolus of the contrast agent (8–10 mL);\n\nAcquire conventional contrast-enhanced sequences (GRE 3D) of the remaining two regions (abdomen and thigh) by injecting a second small bolus of the contrast agent (10–15 mL).\n\nOnly gold members can continue reading.
