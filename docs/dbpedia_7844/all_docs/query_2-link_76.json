        "text": "What is posterior tibial tendon dysfunction?\n\nPosterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD) is an issue that causes foot and ankle pain. It’s also known as posterior tibial tendonitis or posterior tibial tendon insufficiency. The posterior tibial tendon connects your calf muscle to bones on the inside of your foot. The main purpose of the tendon is to support the arch on the inside of your foot. When the tendon is injured or breaks down, it may no longer be able to support the arch. It can be a painful injury that negatively affects foot and ankle movements, including walking and running. PTTD is the most common cause of adult-acquired flatfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat are the stages of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction?\n\nThere are four posterior tibial tendon dysfunction stages:\n\nStage I: The tendon is injured but otherwise intact.\n\nStage II: The tendon is torn (ruptured) or not working properly. The foot is deformed.\n\nStage III: The foot is significantly deformed. There are degenerative changes to the connective tissue (cartilage) in the back of the foot.\n\nStage IV: There are degenerative changes to the ankle joint.\n\nWho does posterior tibial tendon dysfunction affect?\n\nPTTD most frequently affects women and people over the age of 40. The tendon often degenerates, or breaks down, as you get older. However, it can also affect those with conditions including:\n\nObesity.\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension).\n\nDiabetes.\n\nFoot or ankle tissue injuries.\n\nJoint disorders.\n\nPrior surgery.\n\nSteroid use.\n\nThe tendon can also experience damage from a fall or overuse. People who participate in high-impact sports or activities, including football, basketball, soccer, track and long-distance running, may tear the tendon from repeated use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does posterior tibial tendon dysfunction affect my body?\n\nPTTD is a painful condition. If you have PTTD, making certain movements will be difficult for you. These movements may include standing, walking, running or standing on your toes.\n\nHow is posterior tibial tendon dysfunction diagnosed?\n\nYour healthcare provider will look for swelling along the posterior tibial tendon in your ankle and foot. They’ll move your foot from side to side and check your ankle’s range of motion. Swelling, tenderness and pain or weakness when moving your foot or ankle are early signs of PTTD.\n\nYour provider will examine your foot from behind to look for any changes in its structure or shape. Your heel may point outward, and your inner arch may rest flat on the ground. The front of your foot may also move away from your body to counterbalance the changes to the heel and inner arch.\n\nFrom behind your foot, your provider will also look for a “too many toes” sign. In a normal foot, only the fifth toe (pinky toe) and part or all of the fourth toe (ring toe) are visible on the outside of the foot. In those with PTTD, more toes may be visible.\n\nA single-limb heel rise test can also determine the health of your posterior tibial tendon. For this test, you’ll stand next to a wall or chair to support your balance. Then you’ll raise your healthy foot off the ground and attempt to lift onto the toes of your affected foot. With a healthy tendon, you should be able to complete eight to 10 heel raises comfortably. In the early stages of PTTD, it may not be possible to complete one single heel rise.\n\nWhat tests can diagnose posterior tibial tendon dysfunction?\n\nImaging tests can help your healthcare provider confirm the diagnosis, including:\n\nX-rays: X-rays of the front, back and sides of both feet will provide detailed images of the bones. X-rays help spot arthritis or fallen arches. They also help spot joint degeneration in later stages of PTTD.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI can determine the health of your tendon and any surrounding muscles. In the early stages, an MRI may be used to plan nonsurgical treatments. In later stages, an MRI may be used to plan surgical treatment.\n\nComputerized tomography scan (CT scan): A CT scan creates a 3D image of your soft tissues and bones. It provides more detailed images than an x-ray. A CT scan may help spot arthritis or confirm PTTD.\n\nUltrasound: An ultrasound can examine the size of your tendon, observe any tendon degeneration or spot fluid in the tissue that surrounds the tendon, which may appear in the early stages of PTTD.\n\nHow is posterior tibial tendon dysfunction treated?\n\nPTTD treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are. If tendon damage is identified in its earliest stages, many symptoms will go away with nonsurgical treatment, including:\n\nRest: Stop participating in activities that cause or worsen the pain. Low-impact exercises can help you maintain your overall health without affecting the tendon. These include bicycling, yoga, elliptical training and swimming.\n\nIce: You can apply an ice pack covered in a light towel to the most painful areas of your foot or ankle for up to 20 minutes three or four times a day.\n\nMedications: Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, will reduce pain and inflammation. Not everyone can take NSAIDs, so it’s a good idea to check with your healthcare provider before use.\n\nPhysical therapy: Physical therapy exercises can strengthen the tendon.\n\nOrthotics: Over-the-counter shoe inserts or braces can provide support for your tendon and arch. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a walking boot or cast, or custom orthotic brace specifically molded to your foot.\n\nIf your pain doesn’t improve or completely go away after at least six months of nonsurgical treatment, you may be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon. Surgical treatments vary according to where your foot or ankle hurt. Treatments also vary according to the amount of damage to the tendon.\n\nHow soon after treatment will I feel better?\n\nPTTD is a painful injury, and it can take several months to heal. You may have to change the ways you approach your daily activities. Slowly and carefully ease yourself back into any activities or exercises that you participated in before your injury."
