Reverse Mortgage Specialist

Short Business Description

At its most basic, I provide a home equity conversion mortgage (HECM) that is a non-recourse loan or line of credit which allows homeowners 62 and older the ability to access the equity in their home without having to sell their home, give up the title, or continue making monthly mortgage payments. The product is highly regulated and is a government-insured product.

A few benefits of a HECM:

* Access to a line of credit.

* Purchase a new home.

* Liquidity for long term care planning.
