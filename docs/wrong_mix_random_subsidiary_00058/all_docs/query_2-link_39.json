Compliance testing must be performed by a credentialed tester. Individuals on this list have taken CARB’s online Tester Training Course and passed the accompanying exam authorizing them to perform vehicle compliance tests including on-board diagnostic, smoke opacity, and visual inspections. The credentialed testers listed have also granted CARB staff permission to include them on this publicly available list. Inclusion on this list does not represent an endorsement by CARB.\n\nTesters’ contact information can be searched by State, County, and ZIP Code, to assist vehicle owners in locating a tester in their area. Testers that have acquired a CARB-verified OBD testing device are identified with a \"Yes\" in the “OBD Testing Capability” column of the table. CARB will update this list periodically to ensure it is as current as possible. If you are a credentialed tester and wish to update your contact information, or be added to or removed from this list, please contact hdim@arb.ca.gov."
