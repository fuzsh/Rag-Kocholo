        "text": "Adaptive Lighting – New Standards adopted by California Title 24\n\nIn the interest of our customers, W. Bradley Electric is paying close attention to the recent changes in California Title 24. At the end of May the California Energy Commission adopted new, more stringent energy efficiency standards, which include a new requirement for interior commercial lighting – multi-level control for interior lighting systems.\n\nAdaptive lighting—lighting that automatically dims or shuts off when it’s not needed—represents one of the largest near-term opportunities for energy savings, and its inclusion in the state’s building code marks vital progress.\n\nTo learn about all the newly adopted codes, please visit The California Energy Commission News Release.\n\nWBE COO Mike Murphy, left, and Electrical Foreman, Mark Yates in the heart of San Francisco, where WBE has multiple clients who will be affected by the new code regarding adaptive lighting.\n\nAt a special event on September 11th, W. Bradley Electric, Inc. received the distinguished honor, for the 5th time, as one of the North Bay’s “Best Places to Work”. The award is based on several criteria, including the results of an anonymous employee survey and a company application that provided information on issues such as diversity, family-friendly workplace, community involvement and employee benefits.\n\n“Our employees are our greatest asset and we do our best to treat them like family.” said CEO Leslie Murphy. “And we’d like to sincerely thank each of them for their participation in the BPTW Survey.”\n\nOn September 7th, our Executive Director of Human Resources, Laura Masset accepted the award for one of the Bay Area’s “Healthiest Places to Work”. Our company believes strongly in offering programs that support a healthy lifestyle both at home and work.\n\nHR Executive Director Laura Masset accepting the award for Bay Area Healthiest Place to Work\n\nWBE Traffic Division’s Ann Fowler found this recipe for Thanksgiving Turkey that is coated with a pound of Bacon! Not only will the flavor of the turkey be amazing, but can you imagine how the gravy will taste with the drippings of both the turkey and the bacon!\n\nHere’s the recipe, or you can grab it online at Allrecipes:\n\n1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed\n\n1 medium onion, peeled\n\n1 large carrot, peeled\n\n1 stalk celery\n\n1 apple, stem removed\n\n1 orange\n\n¼ cup vegetable oil\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper\n\n1 teaspoon soul food seasoning\n\n1 pound sliced smoked bacon\n\n1 turkey sized oven bag\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\nRinse the turkey, pat dry and place in a large roasting pan. Insert the onion, carrot, and celery into the cavity of the bird. Poke holes in the apple and orange so they will release their juices, and stuff them into the bird. You may have to cut some things in half to get them all inside. Spread oil all over the outside of the bird, and season with salt, pepper and soul food seasoning.\n\nPlace the turkey into an oven bag, and set back into the pan with the breast facing up. Lay strips of bacon over the entire top. Close the bag.\n\nRoast the turkey for about 4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) when taken in the thickest part of the thigh. Let the turkey rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving, and use the drippings in your favorite gravy recipe."
