That part of the mission statement is more than just words on a page. It is a value proposition that we should all take seriously and work toward. Under my presidency, ensuring health equity will be a priority for me and CMA as we move toward changes in both public policy arena and in the house of medicine to make that a reality.” Wailes served as president-elect over the last year and has served as chair of the CMA Board of Trustees for three years and as vice chair for three years.

Gray has been serving the Knox County and East Tennessee region for more than 14 years. As chief medical officer of the University of Tennessee Medical Center, Gray works to serve his community through healing, education and discovery. For Gray, that means improving the health of patients and giving them the knowledge and health literacy necessary to make informed decisions. During the pandemic, Gray provided updates on hospital numbers, answered questions through calls with the faith leaders and provided vaccines for several community clinics. Gray said doing so aligned with the medical center’s health equity strategy to provide quality health care access to its entire community. “At that time, we were reading about disparities across the country about people who wanted access to the vaccine,” Gray said. “We realized that a couple of those barriers were trust and access. We also realized not everybody can, should or will come to the UT campus to get their vaccine. So, we met both of those head on and took the vaccine to the community, to the populations that were most vulnerable.”\n\nPerrin W. Jones, MD ’99, Greenville, N.C, has been elected and sworn in to serve on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Board of Trustees.

Gold Foundation and is selected by students in the graduating medical school class to express gratitude to a faculty member who has been most impactful on their understanding of humanism in medicine. Denizard-Thompson oversees the health equity curriculum and ensures that each student is trained to care compassionately and properly for underserved populations. Students commented that “Dr. Denizard-Thomspon is clearly dedicated to training physicians who are socially conscious and care for the whole patient,” and that her health equity curriculum “really gave me an appreciation of the underserved population.” Award recipients demonstrate both clinical excellence and outstanding compassion in the delivery of care and show respect for patients, their families and health care colleagues. They demonstrate attitudes and behaviors that are sensitive to the values, autonomy, cultural and ethnic backgrounds of others.\n\nTanaka J.

During the pandemic, she worked on the ACTT2 trial (which looked at the use of remdesivir/baricitinib in hospitalized COVID patients) and authored the work that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. She has been very involved with the phase 3 adult COVID vaccine studies for Moderna (also an author on that paper published in NEJM) and the phase 3 Johnson & Johnson vaccine studies. She also has worked with the Centers for Disease Control as a hematology expert for the vaccine safety division and has been involved as they investigate the clotting syndrome associated with the J&J vaccine and was an author on a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) paper describing that syndrome. Walker also wrote a summary piece for JAMA about COVID vaccines available in the U.S. and internationally. Walker has developed and validated a risk-prediction model published in Pediatrics that identifies high-risk pediatric patients who are hospitalized and at risk for developing blood clots. She’s currently running a randomized trial that takes all the children admitted to Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital and runs them through the model. She also has written a book chapter on novel pediatric transfusion strategies and a case report about a pediatric sickle cell patient with COVID who improved following an exchange transfusion.\n\nLauren Elizabeth Kratky, MD ’21, Branford, Conn., received the 2021 United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Excellence in Public Health Award. The award program is an opportunity for the USPHS to recognize medical students who have positively impacted public health in their communities.
