        "text": "Julie Christine Kelly of Saginaw, Michigan\n\nBeloved mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend passed away peacefully, with her family by her side, on Thursday, November 23, 2023, following a brief battle with brain cancer (glioblastoma). She was 51 years old. Julie Christine Greene was born on December 31, 1971, in Saginaw, Michigan, to Harold Charles and Linda Marie (Evans) Greene. She was a proud 1990 graduate of Swan Valley High School. While in high school, she met the love of her life, Sean Kelly. They reunited years later, fell in love, and were married on June 2, 2007. Julie was employed as an Office Administrator with CMU Health on Colony Drive for many years. The role of her lifetime, one she truly treasured and cherished, was to be a loving and devoted mother. She was of the Lutheran Faith and attended St. Mark Lutheran Church. Throughout her life, Julie had impeccable and exquisite taste. She enjoyed spending time shopping, both in store and online, for the best holiday d√©cor. Julie's little piece of heaven was to gather and entertain her family and friends. Whatever the gathering, she was always at the center, making people feel loved and welcomed. Julie loved her daughters to the moon and back and always attended their sporting and school events. She held a special place in her heart for babies and children, always able to connect with their tiny and loving souls. Julie also enjoyed listening to country music, dancing, and on a rare occasion having a glass of wine. She will forever be remembered for her selflessness and generosity to anyone in need, for the love and care she had for those she loved, and for truly living an amazing life filled with many beautiful memories and stories.\n\nSurviving are two daughters: Amanda Kelly of Saginaw; Taylor Kelly of Saginaw; husband, Sean Kelly of Saginaw; mother, Linda (Jim) Doyle of Saginaw; father, Harold (Sherrie) Greene of Saginaw; brother, Nathan Greene of East Lansing; sister, Kara (Jeff) Endaya of Novato, CA; her beloved dog, Emma; and best friend, Pam (Mike) Root of Freeland. Also surviving are many aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, extended family, and friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her grandparents, an aunt and uncle, Sharon and Mike Armato."
