        "text": "More than half a century after starting her education career as an instructional assistant, Mary Jane Burke is ending it as the superintendent who faced down a pandemic.\n\nBurke, 70, of Novato relinquishes her post at the Marin County Office of Education on Monday after a 28-year run.\n\n“My job right now is really to take the time to reflect on what is going to bring me the most joy and sense of purpose,” she said.\n\nHer elected successor, John Carroll, said Burke’s “superpower is her ability to get adults to focus on what is best for all students.”\n\n“For years, she has communicated a moral imperative that steers us all in the right direction,” said Carroll, 58, of Woodacre, most recently the superintendent of the Lagunitas and Bolinas-Stinson Union school districts.\n\nAs county superintendent, Burke has overseen an agency that provides services for 18 school districts and 30,000 students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. Its services include special education, alternative education, career technical education, outdoor education and professional development to enhance teaching and learning.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic expanded those duties. For almost the last three years, Burke and county public health officials worked to inform, reassure and lead schools through the emergency.\n\nEven as schools went into lockdown mode in March 2020, Burke was immediately planning for how and when students could return to the classrooms.\n\n“Mary Jane Burke is an MVP in Marin’s pandemic response,” said Dr. Matt Willis, the county’s public health officer. He said his agency “couldn’t have hoped for a better partner.”\n\n“Together, we were able to reopen schools soon after the lockdown, and do it safely,” he said.\n\nFirst elected superintendent in 1995, Burke said she is most proud of the high-quality mix of people she has been able to hire at the Marin County Office of Education.\n\n“I interviewed almost all of them myself,” she said. “I’m very proud of the remarkable talent and their unwavering focus on what’s best for kids.”\n\nKen Lippi, a deputy superintendent, has worked with Burke for the last 22 years. He said Burke’s partnership with public health officials during the pandemic is an extension of how she has forged relationships and collaborations throughout her record seven terms in office.\n\n“Mary Jane led during the pandemic with the same courage, commitment and remarkable vision that has been consistent throughout her 28 years as superintendent,” Lippi said.\n\n“Because of that leadership, Marin’s schools, public and private, were among the very first in our state to open,” he said. “This was vitally important as we learn more about the very significant impacts of social isolation and learning loss on our children during the pandemic.”\n\nWillis and his deputy, Dr. Lisa Santora, joined Burke on dozens of online events to keep communication lines open for parents, students, staff and teachers. Webinars took place weekly for the schools community and for a group of school liaisons who oversaw the protection plans set up for each school in Marin.\n\nThrough the process, Burke stayed optimistic and determined, Willis said.\n\n“To Mary Jane, it was obvious we should all come together that way, and her vision is contagious,” Willis said.\n\nBecause of the partnership among Burke and health officials, “Marin now has some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the country,” Willis said.\n\n“Mary Jane is a fierce advocate for children,” Santora added. “Through smoke, fires, extreme heat, power outages and pandemics, she championed creating safer, healthier school environments where students can thrive.”\n\nBurke, a mother of two and grandmother of four, was born and raised in Stockton as the eldest of eight children.\n\nShe came to Marin when she was 18 to seek a degree at Dominican College of San Rafael, which is now called a university. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1973 and a master’s degree there in 1976.\n\nBurke later earned education credentials in administrative services and multiple subjects and as a specialist working with disabled students.\n\nHer husband, Larry Lyon, a former superintendent of what is now the Miller Creek School District, died in 1997. Her longtime partner is Mike DeVoy, a defense attorney in San Mateo County.\n\nAn instructional assistant starting in 1971 and then a special education teacher from 1974 to 1977, Burke advanced to principal and program manager posts through the next decade. Starting in 1985, she held several director positions working in due process, special education and employee relations.\n\nShe was named a county assistant superintendent in 1990 and a deputy superintendent in 1994 before being elected superintendent in 1995. She ran unopposed for six of the seven four-year terms.\n\nSome of Burke’s major accomplishments include the creation of SchoolsRule-Marin in 2001, which has allowed underserved students in Marin school districts to receive an equal amount of enrichment program funds through private community donations. The program has raised more than $6.5 million in the past 12 years for school enrichment programs.\n\nBurke also founded Phoenix Academy, a ”sober classroom'” school for students with addiction issues. The charter school is now run in partnership with Marin’s Community School, an alternative school on the grounds of the Marin County Office of Education campus in San Rafael, and is no longer just for students with addictions. Both schools offer therapeutic services as well as academics.\n\nBurke also is credited for her outreach to the state Attorney General’s Office over inequities in the Sausalito Marin City School District. Her efforts led to the two-year state investigation that culminated in a historic 2019 desegregation order.\n\nThe desegregation order — the first such order in California in 50 years — led to the creation of what is now a unified school, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Academy, on two campuses in Sausalito and Marin City.\n\nBurke has also championed services and support to families with children who have special needs. In 2001, she founded the Technology Resource Center, a centralized location in San Rafael where special needs children can be helped with augmentative learning devices.\n\n“At every stage of her career, Mary Jane rose to the challenge of leadership when faced with a crisis,” said Bob Lenz, chief executive of PBLWorks, an education professional development coaching group based at the Buck Institute for Education in Novato.\n\nAs one of her post-employment activities, Burke has accepted an appointment by the California State Board of Education to the board of WestEd, a western regional education group. She also will continue in her role as a trustee of Dominican University.\n\nFor the most part, however, Burke said she plans to spend time with family and friends and to relax and rejuvenate from what has been an intense five decades — not to mention the extreme challenges of the pandemic.\n\nBurke, whose annual salary was $345,262 in 2021 according to Transparent California, said she will miss having more chances to make changes to benefit children.\n\n“I have come to learn quite well,” she said in a recent goodbye letter to the Marin community, “the meaning of this passage by A.A. Milne, the creator of Winnie the Pooh: ‘How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.'”"
