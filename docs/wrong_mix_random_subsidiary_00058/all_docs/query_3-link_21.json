She is a past board member and Life Member of the Environmental Forum of Marin, part chair of Mill Valley Planning Commission, past state President of the Association of Environmental Professionals nad director of the National Association of Environmental Professional. Nona served on the St. Vincent’s/Silveira Advistory Task Force and on the Sutatinabiliyt Working Group for the Marin County Plan update.\n\nNona served as President of MCL from 2008-2011.\n\n2nd Vice President\n\nPamela Reaves, San Rafael\n\nShe is a past member of San Rafael 2040 General Plan Steering Committee and the San Rafael Climate Change Action Plan Update Working Group.

She was a Marin County Integrated Pest Management Commissioner for six years and helped revamp the County IPM Ordinance to improve oversight, transparency, and collaboration.\n\nBecause 53% of Marin County’s greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation, Pamela is particularly interested in helping our County move towards electrification of all vehicles and to increase access to Electric Vehicles and infrastructure to all income levels. She is also interested in how carbon sequestration via creek restoration and ranch management practices can help combat climate disruption.\n\nShe and her wife have lived in San Rafael for over 20 years and have created a waterwise luscious garden with many citrus, stone fruit, apple trees, and vegetables as well as bird, bee, and butterfly habitat.
