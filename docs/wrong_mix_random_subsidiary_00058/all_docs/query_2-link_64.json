        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- The Bay Area is recovering from major weekend storms that brought flood watches, damaging winds, and power outages to the region.\n\nHere are the latest updates.\n\nWATCH: Latest AccuWeather forecast\n\nLIVE: Track rain in San Francisco Bay Area with Live Doppler 7\n\n4 p.m.: Here are the most recent PG &E outage numbers\n\nSan Francisco\n\n186\n\nPeninsula:\n\n7,915\n\nNorth Bay:\n\n23,721\n\nEast Bay:\n\n95\n\nSouth Bay:\n\n7,485\n\nTotal:\n\n39,402\n\nPG &E issued a statement on Tuesday writing:\n\n\"PG &E has more than 3,000 employees engaged in this atmospheric event to assess damage, make repairs, and handle emergency calls, and hundreds more staffed in emergency operations support centers across our service area. This unprecedented storm prompted the first-ever warning for hurricane-force winds in the state's history and brought down healthy trees across our coverage area. Now that the brunt of the storm is over, we are focusing our efforts on safely restoring power.\"\n\nTUESDAY\n\n11 p.m. Extreme Bay Area weather brings insurances crisis\n\nExtreme weather is hitting homeowners already dealing with an \"insurance crisis.\"\n\nPhilip 'Charlie' Porter is a longtime insurance agent out of Menlo Park.\n\n\"It is literally the hardest market I have seen in my 35 years - I've never seen a time where insurance companies don't want to sell insurance,\" Porter said.\n\nThe state continues to see an exodus of big and small insurance companies. Some companies have cited wildfire risk, inflation, and construction costs.\n\nSome agents say price controls within the state's system makes it difficult for insurance companies to increase rates.\n\nPorter said consumers should expect rates will increase dramatically for companies to get back into the market.\n\n\"I think that, and this is going to sound scary - I think consumers need to brace for large rate increases, for home insurance I don't think companies are going to get back in the market until they can get 50-70% rate increases in the preferred markets,\" Porter said.\n\nPorter says consumers will have to pay a bigger deductible.\n\n\"I would look and think of insurance as something that's going to ruin your year or ruin your life, not for something that's going to ruin your week or your month - so that means you want to take a big deductible as consumers - we're going to have to start taking a bigger share of the risk,\" Porter said.\n\n11 p.m. Rural San Mateo County residents vent PG &E frustrations over cycle of power outages\n\nFor yet another night, Julie and her husband Alex have come home to a house with no power.\n\nThe couple, who live on the outskirts of Half Moon Bay with their young family, have had no electricity since it was knocked out by Sunday's intense storm.\n\n\"You need power for a lot of things. A baby monitor, sound machine, things that parents know are pretty critical for making day-to-day life easier,\" Julie said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Julie and Alex have had trouble keeping the lights on either.\n\nAt one point during last year's winter storm season, they had no electricity for weeks at a time.\n\nJulie tells ABC7 News that while she appreciates the hard work that PG &E crews do, the struggle to keep the power on during weather events has become a seemingly constant worry.\n\n\"It's really frustrating to feel like we're forgotten about, frankly, being in a more rural setting. And it's just as hard for anyone to go day-in-day without power,\" she said.\n\nThe electricity is only one concern Julie and her neighbors have too.\n\nDrive along the road leading up to their small, mountainside community, and you come across thick mud and heavily damaged roads.\n\nRemnants left behind from previous storms, that Alex says are still not fixed after over a year of waiting.\n\n\"We had a power line go down. We had a large tree go down making our road inaccessible,\" Alex said.\n\nPG &E estimates the couple's power will turn back on sometime Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut after many disappointing experiences in the past, Julie says she's not counting on it.\n\n\"We are expecting right now that we're going to be out of power for a while.\"\n\n6 p.m. San Francisco's Stern Grove, Pine Lake remain closed due to storm cleanup\n\nSan Francisco's Stern Grove and Pine Lake will remain closed due to storm cleanup, San Francisco Recreation and Parks announced on their website Tuesday.\n\nTPC Harding, Fleming and Gleneagles golf courses also remains closed.\n\n5:45 p.m. Cal State East Bay's Hayward campus to be closed on Wednesday due to power outage\n\nCal State East Bay's Hayward campus will be closed on Wednesday due to an ongoing power outage, the University announced Tuesday. Classes will be operating remotely.\n\n5 p.m. PG &E utilizing clear days to restore power to thousands in South Bay\n\nTwo relatively clear days are giving PG &E precious time to restore power to thousands of people. The utility has more than 3,000 workers working 24/7 since the storm. PG &E's Teresa Alvarado says the work requires multiple steps for safety reasons and that takes time. She hopes the lights will be back on soon.\n\n\"We've experienced the third most outages in PG &E's history,\" Alvarado said. \"It was pretty intense on Sunday with hurricane-force winds, a first-ever for our California coast. There's one that I know of in Willow Glen that had 3,000 customers out yesterday and today it's down to 900. So, we are trying to restore people, even in a step fashion as quickly as we can.\"\n\nIn Willow Glen, neighbors hadn't seen any of the PG &E crews by mid-afternoon. Several trees has kept power off since Sunday. They say the cold, dark conditions have been difficult.\n\n\"PG &E has told us three times that it was going to be such and such a time and they didn't show up,\" Danny Hooper said. \"They said it was going to be on at 3:30 yesterday. Then it got moved to 10. Then I heard from other neighbors that it wasn't going to be until 4 a.m. tomorrow.\"\n\n\"To be honest, it's been pretty brutal,\" Lacy Balog said. \"We've been without heat, power for three days now. We're trying to do our best. We went out on a walk today and we saw the powerline that was down. So, we figured, are they working on it? But, doesn't seem like it yet.\"\n\nThe PG &E outage map says power should be restored early Wednesday morning.\n\n11 a.m.: Some Peninsula residents have been without power for days as restoration could take until Thursday\n\nTuesday is day three of no power for folks in parts of the Bay Area, including Montara.\n\nTodd Miller had a front row seat to the wrath of Sunday's storm in his Montara neighborhood, as PG &E says wind gusts more than 60 miles per hour tore through the Bay Area.\n\n\"And then finally a gust just pushed the whole thing down, including our fence as well,\" Miller said.\n\nThe downed communication line next to his house opened up a whole new ocean view, but still, he's been without power since Sunday.\n\n\"No power, which is hard because I'm on a CPAP machine, so I don't have that going, no wifi but we do have cellular, I have Verizon so we do have limited service here, but it's been kinda fun hanging out with the family with candles out,\" he said.\n\nAnd some of his Montara neighbors say, they can't even get a 911 call out.\n\n\"It went out for the last three days, no internet which is concerning because people can't call 911 for emergency services, we don't get any notifications from PG &E so yeah, we're sort of disconnected down here,\" Michael Uniacke, a Montara resident said.\n\nAnd on day three of the outage, some say it feels like camping in their own homes.\n\n\"No hot water for a couple days, you miss a lot of the bare necessities pretty quickly,\" John Smith, a Montara resident said.\n\nMany neighbors in the Montara area were told by PG &E that power is expected to be restored by Wednesday night.\n\nA spokesperson for PG &E explains what's taking so long in this neighborhood.\n\n\"In areas like Montara, we are having access issues, so things like downed trees, loose soil heavy water, that makes it not only hard for our crews to get to certain areas and access our equipment, it can also be dangerous,\" Tamar Sarkissian, PG &E spokesperson said.\n\nPG &E says right now, they have about 3,000 crews on the ground working around the clock to get power restored as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nThey're expecting power for most Bay Area customers to be restored by Thursday night.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Some North Bay schools remain closed after storms\n\nA number of schools in Sonoma County will remain closed Tuesday due to power loss and storm-related issues, the county Office of Education said Monday evening.\n\nThe schools and/or districts to remain closed are:\n\nDunham School District\n\nFort Ross Elementary\n\nHarmony Union School District\n\nKashia School District\n\nApple Blossom, Orchard View and Twin Hills Charter Middle schools will be closed in the Twin Hills School District\n\nFor more information, visit scoe.org.\n\nMONDAY\n\n10:45 p.m. South Bay business owners suffer financial losses from power outages\n\nHisham Abdelfattah, the owner of El Halal Amigos and Willow Street Pizza in San Jose, said his restaurants lost power Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"We're at bay with PG &E right now - we're just waiting,\" Abdelfattah said.\n\nOn Monday, Abdelfattah rented a refrigerated van to transport food to another of his restaurants in Los Gatos.\n\n\"Twenty years in the business - I have never had to close a restaurant due to a storm longer than a day,\" Abdelfattah said.\n\nHe estimates a loss of $8,000 in inventory and $12,500 in sales - so far.\n\n\"We couldn't run away from the spoilage. So we ended up losing a lot,\" Abdelfattah said.\n\nThe restaurant owner asks the community to support their local spots when power returns.\n\n\"When power kicks back on especially when you know your local restaurants, your favorite places to eat have been down - go out and eat,\" Abdelfattah said.\n\nLincoln Avenue in Willow Glen had virtually no foot traffic on Monday.\n\nBusinesses had signs posted they were closed due to the outage.\n\nSan Jose resident Laura Colvert said it felt bizarre.\n\n\"Weird, very weird I mean this is one of my favorite places to be,\" Colvert said.\n\nThe dark didn't keep people from grabbing a slice or a drink at Bibo's NY Pizza.\n\nFred Elian, the owner, said they were fortunate to hook up to a generator quickly thanks to a customer.\n\n\"So we're able to keep the bake line going kind of keep things rolling, we got a little bit of light and the oven is gas so fortunately we can still cook. As long as we have business and people hanging out and orders coming in - we're going to keep the doors open,\" Elian said.\n\nSome high schools in San Jose to remain closed Tuesday due to power outages\n\nSan Jose's Oak Grove High School and Yerba Buena High School in East Side Union High School District will remain closed on Tuesday, Feb. 6 due to power outages, school district officials said.\n\nAll other district schools will be open on Tuesday.\n\nStorm topples trees, causing power outages in North Bay\n\nIn the North Bay, the big storm left a trail of damage and destruction in its wake. The cleanup is just beginning and could take weeks.\n\n\"I had a premonition when I was over there,\" said Boon Lim.\n\nBoon Lim says a premonition that a tree would fall on his Santa Rosa home came true Sunday after a 100-foot fir tree fell on his property crushing his garage.\n\nThe home on Knob Hill Drive is now red-tagged, unsafe to occupy.\n\n\"Luckily no one was injured so it's OK, this is actually a healthy tree, so I have no idea. Maybe the wind was really strong,\" said Lim.\n\nThe mega storm uprooted dozens of trees across Sonoma County.\n\n\"Pure panic, just panic,\" said Darina Valoshina.\n\nDarina Valoshina and Blake O'Connor are stuck at home in Forestville after strong winds toppled a giant tree, which took part of their asphalt driveway and powerlines with it.\n\n\"We're kind of stranded up here. We can't take our car down the driveway - we can't cross the powerline until they come and clear it,\" said Valoshina.\n\nHeavy rain caused tributaries on the Russian River to spill over into vineyards, flooding portions of Wohler Road.\n\n3:30 p.m. Person killed by fallen tree in Boulder Creek home identified\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Sherriff's Office says Robert Brainard III was killed at his home along Highway 9 after the winds brought a tree down. A second person in the home escaped and called 911, but EMS and fire were unable to save Brainard inside.\n\nWhile the front of the house looked undamaged, the back showed the devastation from the impact. Cars in the driveway were crushed by the fallen tree, but the sound of the falling tree was not the most terrifying thing neighbor Chris Lowth heard.\n\n\"The thing we we heard was someone screaming, but then the screaming stopped,\" Lowth said. \"Like have you ever heard a wounded dog? It was like that. But it wasn't a dog, it was a person. When you live in the mountains, we don't know each other, but it's a small community. I'm pretty sure someone I know knows the person. And it's more so tough because it was a tree. He could've been watching TV in his living room and then boom, gone\"\n\nThe county tells us there were several reports of trees crushing homes as damage was felt throughout the region. But thankfully there were no more lives lost across the county during the busy and hard-hitting storm.\n\n2:45 p.m. Muir Woods to remain closed through Wednesday, park officials say\n\nOfficials at Muir Woods in the North Bay announced the park will remain closed through Wednesday, Feb. 7 following Sunday's major storm.\n\nThe park initially said Monday it would reopen Tuesday.\n\nBut now, they say the closure will allow staff time to fix some minor damage to areas around the park.\n\n2 p.m.: More than 162,000 customers remain without power\n\nThe latest power outage numbers from PG &E shows more than 162,000 are currently without electricity. The regions with the highest number of people in the dark is in the North Bay, South Bay and the Peninsula.\n\nNoon: More than 185,000 customers remain without power\n\nWhile there is progress, PG &E says there are thousands still without power following the weekend's major Level 4 storm. As of noon, 185,097 customers in the Bay Area are without electricity, according to the agency.\n\n11 a.m. PG &E working to restore power to thousands of customers\n\nPG &E says crews are still working to restore power to more than 204,000 customers in the Bay Area, according to their 10 a.m. update. They say the greatest concentration of outages are on the Peninsula and up in the North Bay.\n\n\"I wish I could,\" Yuri Hoker, a manager of the 24:7 gas station off of Westborough Boulevard shouted to someone looking for gas Monday morning.\n\nHoker has spent the better part of his morning and Sunday night, turning people away from the gas station he manages in South San Francisco.\n\n\"It's a little bit difficult because this location, I think, is one of the busiest locations here in South City so we push through a lot of gas and to tell our regular customers no, it's kinda like you feel impotent to the situation you know?\" he said.\n\nThey originally lost power at 3 p.m. Sunday afternoon and his team stayed busy, cleaning up, well before the sun even came up.\n\nUnder the light of just moonlight, still taking deliveries and waiting for the lights to come back on after dealing with mixed messaging from PG &E.\n\n\"First they said 5 p.m. and then 5 p.m. rolled around and then 7 and then 10 and now we're here and it's 11 a.m. to noon so we're hoping there's no more pushback,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, just down the road, lined with traffic signals that weren't working, people like June Dayao were turned away from Safeway, which was also in the dark.\n\n\"I said oh no, there goes my idea of getting hot coffee and hot food,\" June Dayao, a Daly City resident said. \"My husband helped me get the car out from the garage manually and to charge my phone because this is the only way I can get power.\"\n\nPG &E says at 5 o'clock Monday morning, there were more than 235,000 customers without power across the Bay Area, blaming the wind from Sunday's storm.\n\n\"Wind even more so than rain is what can really cause power outages, so you see downed trees, trees falling into power lines, wires getting knocked down as a result of the heavy winds, those kinds of things are the kinds of hazards that our crews are running into,\" Jeff Smith, a spokesperson for PG &E said.\n\nAnd they say, their crews are out in full force, expecting to make some progress with a break in the rain.\n\n\"We hope to get many of those customers restored today but there will be some that will extend out tomorrow but we'll work to restore as many as possible as we can today,\" Smith said.\n\nWith the storm continuing to move through the Bay Area on Monday, PG &E said they are likely going to have a new handful of outages to deal with.\n\nAnd another important reminder, if you see any downed power lines, do not approach, treat them as if they are live and report it by calling 911 and PG &E.\n\n8:30 a.m. Person killed after tree fell on Santa Cruz Co. home\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office confirms a storm-related death in Boulder Creek.

First responders have been busy responding to toppled trees and flooding from heavy rain.\n\n\"I left for work at 2 a.m. The street was bare. I came back and water was up to our ankles and knees,\" said Novato resident Sergio Melendez.\n\nMelendez couldn't believe how fast flood water rose on Armstrong Avenue in Novato. Some brave drivers decided to venture past the closed road signs but folks living in the Novato RV Park were feeling stranded.\n\n\"There's a lot of cars stuck in, people trapped. Folks have stuff to do, being held against our own will,\" Melendez said.\n\nAcross town, flooding left Garden Court inundated.\n\n\"We woke up, and it was all flooded out here,\" said Justin Sheets.\n\nThe water was about two to three feet deep and coming close to homes, some cars stalled out. Neighbors say, it's runoff from nearby Novato Creek.\n\n\"There's a drain pipe here. Once it starts going backwards, we're done. It's not draining anymore,\" said Jim Stokes.\n\nWe found slow traffic on Northbound Highway 101, where the left lane was underwater, Caltrans on scene trying to drain it.\n\nIn Santa Rosa, first responders say the driver of a crushed car survived after a Redwood tree fell onto Northbound Highway 101 near Todd Road.\n\n\"We received a report of a tree down onto a motorist.

You can call your own contractor, to help you break up that tree and get it out of the way. If you need help from the city, please don't hesitate to call.\"\n\nSan Jose fire officials tell us they have received several calls due to the wind including arcing wires, some wires down, a few other electrical emergencies, and a power outage northeast of downtown.\n\nThe fire department has upstaffed four additional Urban Search and Rescue personnel in case of any possible water rescues.\n\n8:15 a.m. Northbound Hwy 101 in Santa Rosa partially closed after tree falls on car\n\nA driver is injured after a tree fell onto a car on northbound Highway 101 near Todd Rd. in Santa Rosa, according to the Sonoma County Fire District.\n\nThe driver was taken to the hospital, but it's not clear the extent of his injuries.\n\nThat section of the freeway is closed as crews clean up.\n\nIt's unknown when lanes will reopen.\n\n6:30 a.m. Seton Medical Center Emergency Room closed in Half Moon Bay\n\nSan Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller say the emergency room at Seton Medical Center in Half Moon Bay (not Daly City) is currently closed due to a power outage.\n\nHe says for the time being, any patients will be to sent to another hospital.\n\n5 a.m. Tree falls on cars in Santa Rosa\n\nA tree was uprooted from the ground and fell onto multiple cars in Santa Rosa overnight Sunday.\n\nIt happened along the 1200 block of McMinn Ave.\n\nSATURDAY\n\n11 p.m.: Atmospheric river has South Bay officials on high alert, residents urged to stay aware\n\nLate Saturday, with forecasts now predicting a stronger weekend storm, a local emergency was declared in San Jose.\n\n\"The City of San Jose, given this news -- an update from the National Weather Service -- has issued a proclamation of local emergency, which now allows us to evacuate our waterways,\" said Mayor Matt Mahan at a press conference.\n\nMahan said the storm will be bigger and stronger than previously predicted, bringing the flood warnings to areas along the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"If you live along the Guadalupe River, in particular, it is possible that you may have some street level flooding. Please do not get anywhere near the water way,\" Mahan said.\n\nModerate flooding could begin just after 5 a.m. on Sunday, cresting to just above flood stage around 10 a.m.\n\n\"Our priority through this event is to save lives. As such, our Emergency Operations Center opened a few hours ago. We will be running through the night. And again into the morning,\" said Assistant City Manager Lee Wilcox.\n\nFurther south in Santa Cruz County, officials are bracing for massive flooding as well.\n\n\"Certainly if we get upwards of five or six or more inches of rain in our watershed, we could see really catastrophic levels of flooding. Because we were just hit with that atmospheric river just a couple of days ago,\" said Dave Reid, director of the Santa Cruz County Office of Response, Recovery and Resilience.\n\nReid said the newly forecasted strong storm with stronger winds is creating concerns. But the main issue is the saturated soil from this week's earlier rain.\n\nSignificant rain is expected in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which will then feed into the Guadalupe River. The San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz County is also at risk of flooding.\n\n\"We are definitely concerned that the saturated soils will cause the river to rise higher faster. And right now, the National Weather Service has put us into a Flood Warning for the San Lorenzo River,\" Reid said.\n\nOfficials advise residents to monitor city and county social media and to sign-up for their alerts.\n\n11 p.m.: Peninsula residents gear up for heavy rain, flooding\n\nThe Peninsula is bracing for possible flooding Saturday night.\n\nWe talked with residents in some of San Mateo County's most flood-prone spots.\n\nThe signs are up and sandbags are out as San Mateo County gets ready to weather this major weekend storm.\n\n\"I would tell people to be vigilant and be aware, because what we're expecting. And this is from meteorologists, is something that is really intense. And so, the volume of water and the way it comes down. I just hope people are prepared,\" said San Mateo County Supervisor David Canepa.\n\nCanepa says Daly City and Broadmoor Village have historically been hit the hardest by flooding.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is make sure people are people are prepared. We're trying to make sure, through our regional operations center, we're able to coordinate -- whether it's through the sheriff's department, local jurisdictions, we're ready,\" he said.\n\n\"When it rains a lot this whole area is flooded,\" said Broadmoor Resident Mariia Nezhdanova.\n\nAnd as this Broadmoor resident explains, some have it worse than others.\n\nKevin McKeon was one of those people preparing.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm just trying my best to prepare for it, because I don't really have a proper game plan,\" McKeon said.\n\nHe's lived in Broadmoor most of his life and says he's become accustom to flooding.\n\n\"Last Thursday or Friday, my garage got completely flooded. I had to help my mom out just dumping water and getting replacement sandbags there,\" McKeon said.\n\nAnd you can see the sandbags stacked up in front of his house now, ready for the next round of heavy rain.\n\n\"Right now, we've been going to the center, so we get our own sand. We've been buying up Home Depot just trying to cover up all of the entrances,\" McKeon said.\n\nAnd he's certainly not the only one hitting up Home Depot. The Daly City store was bustling Saturday.\n\nSandbags were being stocked up. And while most were concerned about flooding, others had different reasons for resisting the rain.\n\n\"I don't want it, because it's ruining baseball season right now and our field's flooded, so I guess it's going to make it worse,\" said SF resident Noah Vigil.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the neighborhoods, underground garages were emptied out to avoid getting trapped by floodwaters.\n\nAnd officials once again are asking people to take precautions.\n\n\"Always remember have your emergency kit. Preparation is key. So having an emergency kit, being stocked up will carry the day,\" Canepa said.\n\nIn addition to being prepared at home, officials are also warning people to be aware of downed trees, hazardous roads and high surf.\n\n10:30 p.m.: Tesla Road in Livermore closed due to severe weather, CHP says\n\nTesla Road will be closed to through traffic from Cross Road in Livermore to the Alameda County Line, California Highway Patrol said.\n\nIn a social media post, photos of a large sinkhole on the road that links Livermore to Tracy could be seen.\n\nAuthorities said said they will reassess the situation on Sunday.\n\n10 p.m.: Damaging wind gusts predicted for mountains in Monterey Co., NWS says\n\nDamaging wind gusts of 75 mph or more may strike the coastal Santa Lucia Mountains of Monterey County, the National Weather Service said Saturday night.\n\nForecasters predicted widespread tree and power line damage.

Storms in 2023 brought serious damage that's still being felt.\n\n\"When we had those series of atmospheric rivers blow through over several months, we lost over one thousand trees in the city of San Jose,\" said San Jose Dept. of Transportation PIO Colin Heyne.\n\nWith Sunday's storm expected to bring more rain to already saturated soil, more fallen trees are possible.\n\nAnd they can, not only block streets and take down power lines, but also make flooding even worse.\n\nValley Water crews have been using the break in the rain to clear trees and anything else that's still left over.\n\n\"People may think that, 'oh yeah, creeks and streams naturally just flow and there's no concern about something blocking them,'\" said Valley Water Spokesperson Matt Keller. \"And when you see those pictures, you see the leaves, debris, sticks, trees and all those kinds of things that can be obstructions in our local waterways.\"\n\nThe year 2023 was a challenge. But with every storm comes the chance for responders to learn and to be better prepared for the next one.\n\n3 p.m.: Sonoma Co. braces for weekend flooding, expected to shut down select roads\n\nThe North Bay is preparing for another soaking after getting drenched this week.\n\nSonoma County is preparing to preemptively close some roads prone to flooding.\n\nThen, there are the leaky roofs.\n\n\"Clearly, the last atmospheric river and the one forecasted has generated a ton of inbound calls. My office is on at least three or four lines sun up to sun down,\" said Gary Harvey, president and CEO of Wedge Roofing.\n\nFor Harvey, that means jam-packed days, with the team broken up into two-person emergency response crews seeing between 30-to-60 clients a day. They are now working through the weekend.\n\n\"Those crews are trained and equipped to temporarily stop leaks of any type in any roofing system,\" he said. \"Their secondary responsibility is to generate a follow-up proposal for a permanent repair.\"\n\nAhead of this weekend's looming storms, Sonoma County officials are planning to preemptively shut down a handful of roads that have been notorious for flooding, including Mark West Station Road near Starr Road. This is where someone drove past the roadblocks, through high water and had to be rescued on Wednesday.\n\nCounty officials say the closures are also expected to happen at Slusser Road between River Road and Mark West Creek, Trenton-Healdsburg Road between River Road and Eastside Road and Mark West Station Road between Trenton-Healdsburg Road and Starr Road.\n\n\"The most common assumption is that 'it doesn't look bad, I can drive through it,'\" said Officer Andrew Barclay, a spokesperson for CHP's Golden Gate Division. \"Well what most people don't realize is that on many vehicles, the air intake for your engine is on the bottom of your car.\n\nSo as soon as you drive through a few inches of water, and it brings that water into the engine, the engine's done and you're stuck.\"\n\nBarclay urges drivers: if you're not sure about standing water on the roadway, don't risk it and don't assume that just because the road isn't closed, that it's automatically safe.\n\n\"Especially with it coming on the weekend. If you don't have to be out, stay home, stock up now, get what you need. If you can just stay home, stay home. It's the safest thing you can do,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, roofers say the break in between the rain is also a good time to make sure your gutters are clear and make sure your roof is free of any debris.\n\nTHURSDAY\n\n5:30 p.m.: Sonoma County crews prepare for water rescues as North Bay rain intensifies\n\nAs the storm intensifies and thunderstorms are projected throughout the North Bay, Sonoma County Fire crews are using any slight break in the rain to prepare.\n\n\"It's the calm after the storm. So, people think it's no big deal. They can pass through these areas that otherwise might have been flooded and think it's safe, but it's not always the case,\" said Ryan Osborne, Sonoma County fire inspector.\n\nWe joined Osborne as he put out barriers in high flood zones.\n\nThese are signs that residents like Jodie Norberg are thankful for. She has lived in the area for 40 years and knows just how fast floods can happen. She witnessed it Wednesday night.\n\n\"Thank God for the rescues. I would never push it. If I can't see the yellow lines through the water, I don't do it,\" Norberg said.\n\nAs more rain is expected, crews are constantly monitoring the Russian River.\n\n\"All the water that came over last night and yesterday -- it's draining into our lower creeks, which ultimately drains into the Russian river and then out into the ocean. So, right now with the break in the rain that is great because it's allowing that water to be released. However our soils are saturated and we have a lot of ponding water,\" said Karen Hancock, public information officer for Sonoma County Fire District.\n\nThe Swift Water rescue team is taking advantage of the high water levels. Around this time last year, they were deployed to at least 12 rescues.\n\n\"These are pre-positioned from OES, and so each of the boats has a staffing of at least three people, and we also have a jet ski,\" said John Selfridge with the Sonoma County Fire District.\n\nOn Wednesday night, crews rescued a person stuck inside their vehicle during the storm.\n\n\"A motorist was stranded in flooded waters with water rising into their vehicle. This person actually went around the road signs the barricades that said flooded road closed,\" said Hancock.\n\n3 p.m.: Chance of more thunderstorms this afternoon\n\nScattered storms are dumping more rain onto the Bay Area, only a day after an atmospheric river drenched parts of the region. A Flood Warning is in effect for parts of Marin and Sonoma counties, and there's a Flood Watch for every other part of our area.\n\n10:50 a.m.: Lightning in parts of Bay Area amid thunderstorm\n\nLightning is striking over Daly City late Thursday morning, moving into San Francisco.\n\nThe thunderstorm is heading to the East Bay, bringing lightning strikes and heavy rain. Residents are advised to move indoors immediately.\n\n5 a.m.: Fallen tree on Daly City apartment building\n\nNo one was hurt after a massive tree fell and crashed into a two-story apartment complex in Daly City.\n\nIt happened Wednesday night during heavy rain and gusty winds off of 500 King Drive.\n\nThe tree crashed through a fence first and then onto the building.\n\nThe apartment maintenance team says only exterior damage has been reported and only minor cosmetic damage to the side of an apartment building could be seen from the road.\n\nEven at least 12 hours after the tree fell, damage still had a road closed inside of the apartment complex.\n\nCrews were on scene Thursday morning working to get this cleaned up, throwing pieces of the tree into a wood chipper as they go.\n\nThere is no estimated time of getting the road reopened inside of the apartment complex.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n11 p.m.: Kashia School District in Sonoma Co. to close Thursday\n\nThe Kashia School District in Sonoma County will be closed Thursday due to weather, the county Office of Education said.\n\nThe district has one school, Kashia Elementary, located in Stewarts Point on Skaggs Spring Road in the northern coastal area of the county.\n\nThe Sonoma County Office of Education said the closure is due to a power outage and other storm-related impacts.\n\n10:16 p.m. Driver rescued from car taking on floodwater in Sonoma County\n\nSonoma County fire crews rescued a person from a vehicle taking floodwater on Mark West Station Rd. at Starr Rd. Person, the department posted on X.\n\nFire officials are warning drivers to not risk it by driving on flooded roads.\n\n10 p.m.: As storm pummels North Bay, nonprofits help those most in need\n\nAs the atmospheric river drops rain on the North Bay, many local residents have been preparing.\n\nAt the Ritter Center in San Rafael, staff have been giving out supplies to help the city's homeless population.\n\n\"Giving them some opportunities to pick up tents, blankets, clothing, tarps, all those things,\" said Rachelle Valenzuela.\n\nValenzuela works at the center. She tells us she and her colleagues work closely with Marin County officials during major weather events.\n\n\"That kind of helps us to prepare. So okay we need to initiate a severe weather campaign. We do that pretty much every time a big storm is happening,\" Valenzuela said.\n\nThat severe weather campaign is exactly what the Ritter Center is in the middle of right now - collecting donations from the public to help them continue to provide for those most in need.\n\nDuring our visit Wednesday afternoon, we met Robert, who came to get a poncho for the evening.\n\n\"It'd be miserable without them. And, for some people, it could be life or death,\" Robert said.\n\nFurther north in Novato, the heavy rain wasn't enough to stop a soccer game at San Marin High School.\n\nScott and Tanya Madsen's son was playing in the game.\n\n\"You're prepared. You layer up. You get prepared with everything. We ended up buying bigger umbrellas at one point because it rained so much last year. So you figure out a way,\" Scott said.\n\nThe Madsens say even though these conditions aren't necessarily fun, they were determined to be here.\n\n\"It's the last game so it's a big one, it matters. But not loving it. Soccer in the rain is not as fun for the spectators,\" Tanya said.\n\n7:54 p.m.: Fallen tree prompts road closure in Santa Cruz County\n\nA fallen tree has closed Soquel San Jose Road, north of Rancho Soquel Road in Santa Cruz County Wednesday evening, according to CHP. Drivers are asked to take alternate routes.\n\n6 p.m.: Oakland Zoo to remain closed on Thursday\n\nThe Oakland Zoo was closed Wednesday and will be closed Thursday due to the weather.\n\nThe San Francisco Zoo closed at 1 p.m. on Wednesday also because of the weather.\n\nIt has not said what its plans are for Thursday.\n\n5:15 p.m.: Town of Danville, rest of East Bay preparing for Wednesday night's Level 3 storm\n\nA year after the historic flooding and torrential downpours, the town of Danville had crews trimming trees and clearing storm drains ahead of Wednesday night's storm. Many residents say they learned from last winter and are more prepared for this time.\n\nThe Balk family live on an elevated property. Even so, their front lawn still flooded last winter. They have cleaned their gutters and did extra maintenance of their yards. And, they are happy to see crews getting ready.\n\n\"Ever since last year, there has been a lot of clean-up, which is much appreciated. Especially since, down the road, there were cars which were underneath the water, which was crazy! And we went to go check it out and it was up to (our knees),\" says Emily Balk.\n\nKelly Kalfsbeek, with Contra Costa County Public Works Department, says, \"As always, we are encouraging our customers to be proactive. To make sure they are cleaning up leaves, clearing their drains and gutters. Checking their property for any trouble spots.\"\n\nShe advises residents to check areas for erosion or where water may be pooling. Know your flood risk, she add. And, call the city or county for help immediately after a problem arises.\n\n\"A lot of cities have different things like 'See Click Fix' or ways to report issues to them. We have something called our customer portal, as well as the mobile citizen app. So, there are a lot of great ways for people to contact the city or town or county to let them know about any issues that arise,\" explains Kalfsbeek.\n\nOfficials remind residents to check their city and county social media for updates.\n\n3:30 p.m. Santa Cruz Mountains prepare for high winds, heavy rain in first major storm of 2024\n\nThings have been relatively calm in the Santa Cruz Mountains this winter, but residents here know that's about to change.\n\n\"I want to prepare because a lot of people are talking about that it's going to hit pretty hard. We haven't had a hard rain from late last year to now,\" Boulder Creek Resident Gary Klemz said. \"They said it might go 18 hours and we could get, maybe, 7-8 inches of rain. That's a lot.\"\n\nNeighborhoods like Soquel Village and Rio Del Mar Flats along with Felton Grove, Paradise Park and the Interlaken area near Watsonville have been notified about the danger of flooding and high winds from this storm.\n\nThe county says taking steps now to prepare for everything else the storm could bring can prevent damage and save lives.\n\n\"The ground is already saturated and there's nowhere for that water to go, which is why we're concerned about flooding in some of these areas that frequently see flooding,\" Santa Cruz County PIO Jason Hoppin said. \"Those trees come down, they affect the roads, they take out power lines, they cause outages, they take out communication lines and it takes us awhile to get that cleaned up.\"\n\n11 a.m.: East Bay prepares for heavy rain, possible power outages\n\nWith storm preparations underway in the East Bay, local hardware stores are stocked and ready for a rush.\n\nAce Hardware says tarps are one of their most popular products ahead of the storms.\n\n\"I think we have been selling more tarps in the past couple of months than usual just for the rain that's come through, people wanting to cover up motorcycles, and patio furniture or they discover there's a leak in the shed roof or something like that,\" Karen Bardsley, an Ace Hardware employee said.\n\nPublic works departments across the East Bay are setting up sandbag stations, urging residents to bag up before the heavy rains come, since runoff could happen quickly with the soil already supersaturated.\n\nPG &E says they don't have any planned public safety power outages at this time but they're telling customers to prepare for anything.\n\n\"We are prepared, we want our customers to be prepared as well,\" Tamar Sarkissian, a PG &E spokesperson said. \"It's always good to be prepared for the possibility of an outage so having flashlights with fresh batteries instead of candles for safety, if you do experience an outage, you can unplug your large appliances but leave one light on.\"\n\nThey say they're taking lessons learned from last year's New Year's Day storm and putting them to use this year, keeping their staff on standby to help as outages pop up.\n\n\"They're continuing to do regular work but with the knowledge that we may have to shift and send people to outages due to the storm and certainly if there is a need, we can bring staff from lesser hit areas to harder hit areas,\" Sarkissian said.\n\nPG &E says if you see any low or downed power lines in this storm, always assume that they are live, stay away from them and call PG &E and 911 immediately.\n\nIf you've having trouble viewing this map, visit this page.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Two Sonoma County schools close Wednesday\n\nTwo schools in Sonoma County closed on Wednesday ahead of expected heavy rainfall in the region.\n\nThe Sonoma County Office of Education confirmed in a notice the closure of Kashia School, a K-8 school near the coast, and SunRidge School in the Twin Hills Union School District in Sebastopol.\n\nNo other public school district or school in the county has announced a storm-related closure.\n\n7:30 a.m.: Bay Area shelters set up ahead of atmospheric river\n\nShelters were set up for residents of the greater Bay Area ahead of expected severe weather conditions likely to cause flooding in the region starting Wednesday.\n\nForecasters earlier said there will be impactful weather into Wednesday night with strong gusty winds and locally heavy rainfall. Residents are advised to expect downed trees, power outages, and flooding of roadways and streams.\n\nDue to these weather conditions, residents are urged to evacuate to the following sites if needed:\n\nDepot Park at 119 Center St. in Santa Cruz (until Friday)\n\nVeterans Memorial Hall at 215 E. Beach St. in Watsonville (until Friday)\n\nHomeless Services Center of Catholic Charities' Caritas Center at 301 Sixth St., Suite 108 in Santa Rosa (until Friday)\n\nRoosevelt Community Center at 901 E. Santa Clara St. in San Jose (until Monday)\n\nMarin Health and Wellness Campus at 3240 Kerner Blvd. in San Rafael (until Thursday)\n\nJack London Square Aquatic Center at 115 Embarcadero in Oakland (until Thursday)\n\nEast Oakland Sports Center - 9161 Edes Ave. in Oakland (until Thursday)\n\n6 a.m.: Newsom activates State Operations Center\n\nIn anticipation of Wednesday's storm, Governor Newsom is activating the State Operations Center.\n\nThe Center allows for a coordinated emergency response among state, local, and federal agencies.\n\nCalfire also taking precautions ahead of the intensifying weather.\n\nThey're reminding the public to prepare for a potential danger.\n\nCheck to make sure your emergency equipment like flashlights and generators are working.\n\nCheck your local county websites for where you can get sandbags and create a \"family communication plan\" in case you get separated from loved ones.\n\nTUESDAY\n\nEast Bay braces for atmospheric river storm, possible flooding\n\nOn New Year's Day in 2023, those who live in the East Bay remember the torrential rains flooding many local waterways, especially on El Capitan Drive in Danville where homes were inundated with water. The Trucco family had water up to their front door and had to be rescued.\n\n\"Actually, the fire department had to take us out of our house,\" Joy Trucco said.\" I couldn't get out of my house.\n\n\"That was last year so now you must have a little bit of fear?\" ABC7 News reporter Leslie Brinkley asked.\n\n\"Anxiety. Oh yes, I do and my two next-door neighbors - we all do. Very scary,\" Trucco answered.\n\nPublic works departments say last year's storm was problematic because it swept through as all the leaves fell from the trees, clogging the drains. This time, the late January timing means the leaves are already cleared out.\n\n\"We're in storm prep mode. As always, we're doing our due diligence and we're making sure we're clearing out our storm drains, catch basins and roadside ditches,\" Kelly Kalfsbeek, spokesperson for the Contra Costa County Public Works Department said. \"We have all staff and all hands on deck.\"\n\nSandbag stations around the county are stocked up with officials urging residents to bag up before the heavy rain comes since runoff could happen quickly with the soil already super saturated.\n\n\"With the ground saturated, trees are more likely to fall,\" Kalfsbeek added.\n\nDanville residents say they've seen a lot of debris removed in many locations but say more could be done to mitigate flood risks.\n\nMORE: How to prep your home for rain storms and other emergencies\n\nThe operations chief with San Ramon Valley Fire District said that along with other Contra Costa agencies, they've gotten OES approval to have extra resources on standby for this atmospheric river including five extra engines, a dozer, a hand crew and a swift water task force - just in case.\n\nSanta Cruz Co. residents fear for potential flooding, power outages\n\nIn the Santa Cruz Mountains, volunteers with the county alerted residents in high-risk areas heavy rain is coming.\n\nPublic information officer for Santa Cruz County Jason Hoppin said they're expecting the storm system to be short but impactful.\n\nOfficials say there is a potential for flooding at local creeks and rivers.\n\n\"We had a rain event about a week to 10 days ago where the San Lorenzo River came in about 4 feet above predicted levels, so that shows us the ground is very saturated,\" Hoppin said.\n\nAlong the San Lorenzo River behind the Felton Covered Bridge, is Tamara Boole's equestrian center. The property boards around 60 horses.\n\nBoole said they have 20 acres in the back that often go underwater in the winter during certain emergencies, they have evacuated for fires and floods.\n\n\"We flooded last year and we did we had all the horses leave the property, so we do have a pretty extensive evacuation plan,\" Boole said.\n\nA bulletin gives others a heads-up to plan ahead of time.\n\n\"What we ask our boarders to do so ahead of time to find someplace for their horse to go,\" Boole said. \"Whether it's a different stable or whether its someone's backyard, we have lists of that too of people that'll help out.\"\n\nBoole will remain at the property and watch the weather closely.\n\n\"Water is powerful and we need the rain. We'll probably be up and watchful,\" Boole said.\n\nMORE: What to do if you're returning to a flooded home\n\nPG &E said the Santa Cruz mountains could see the most adverse weather so they're activating their emergency operation centers in the region.\n\nAyzin Uludag, a Bonny Doon resident said over the summer they cut douglas fir trees that were facing her house. They're prepared in case of outages.\n\n\"We have a generator already and we also got a battery as a backup and we are storing some food,\" Uludag said.\n\nThe staggering toll of last year's series of storms damaged homes, businesses and beloved destinations.\n\nThe pier at Seacliff State Beach was deemed irreparable and was removed.\n\nDue to unsafe weather conditions this week, Seacliff State Beach will be closed from Wednesday to Thursday.\n\nBay City News contributed to this story.\n\nABC7 News reporters Anser Hassan, Lauren Martinez, Lena Howland, Cornell Barnard, Tim Johns, Tara Campbell and Dustin Dorsey contributed to this report."
