We have expertise in fully leveraging the synergies that exist in matching the needs for affordable housing at the local level with the tax credit investment objectives of our investor clients. Our depth of talent in effectively structuring quality tax-advantaged investments, coupled with the strength of RBC in worldwide financial markets, makes us a premier tax credit syndicator.\n\nRBC Community Investments’ team of originators, underwriters and closing specialists works with developers nationwide to provide solid deal execution and follow-up through closing. We deploy substantial resources in all major markets to meet the dynamic development needs of affordable housing sponsors. Our capabilities include the flexibility to close a transaction with RBC funding within a developer’s timeframe.\n\nOur mission is to find quality investment opportunities for our clients and our syndication platform is built on the principle of providing strategic diversification for tax credit investors. We are disciplined in maintaining dual distribution channels – looking to syndicate tax credit investments equally through proprietary funds as well as multi-investor funds. This balance allows us to provide flexible capital to meet the needs of our developer partners and to provide strong investment opportunities to our investor partners. In the last five years, we have worked with 55 different institutional investors and have closed on tax credit investment funds totaling $4.7 billion.\n\nOur Asset and Fund Management teams are structured to effectively monitor our entire portfolio of properties at any stage of the asset lifecycle.

This specialization strategy enhances our ability to deliver best in class service."
