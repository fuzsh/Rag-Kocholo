        "text": "This week's highest-profile Top 25 basketball game will unfold at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Cintas Center when No. 5 Xavier hosts No. 1 Villanova in a Big East showdown of epic proportions.\n\nXavier had a crack at Nova in its Big East opener on the Wildcats’ court and lost 95-64. The game was characterized by point guard Edmond Sumner’s hard fall and concussion several minutes into play.\n\nThe Musketeers never recovered.\n\nRyan Arcidiacono scored a season-high 27 points behind seven 3-pointers and Jay Wright’s team dictated an outing in which Xavier committed 19 turnovers. Villanova scored 26 points off the mistakes.\n\n“They really pressure you and we didn’t handle it well,” XU coach Chris Mack said in his December post-game press conference. “It wasn’t so much the shot selection because we didn’t shoot a bad percentage in the first half. We just didn’t shoot. We kept on giving them live ball turnovers.\n\n“We talked about that a lot leading up, but talking about it and being about it are two different things. You have to be strong with the ball. You have to get ball reversal in order to compete with Villanova and we did not do that well enough and really got behind the eight-ball.”\n\nXavier (24-3, 12-3 Big East) has gone 12-2 since the blowout and enters the matchup ranked sixth in the NCAA’s RPI with a No. 2 spot in the conference standings. League leader Villanova (24-3, 13-1) has posted a 13-1 record in the same stretch and is No. 2 in the RPI.\n\nJust how big is this game? FOX Sports 1 is hosting a live studio show at Cintas Center featuring pre-game, halftime and post-game analysis by Kevin Burkhardt and Steve Lavin. The contest itself will be called by Gus Johnson and Bill Raftery.\n\nWednesday marks Xavier’s first meeting with an AP No. 1 since the 2007 postseason, when it lost to Ohio State in the NCAA tournament in Lexington. The Musketeers’ last victory over a No. 1 was against Saint Joseph’s in the 2004 Atlantic 10 tournament in Dayton.\n\nPOLL POSITION: The Wildcats retained their perch at No. 1 in the Associated Press Top 25 for the third straight week when Monday’s edition was released. After downing then-No. 23 Providence at home and Georgetown on the road, the Musketeers ascended from No. 8 to a program-record-tying fifth.\n\nNova was also No. 1 in the USA Today Coaches Poll. Xavier ascended two slots to No. 5.\n\nPLAYERS OF THE WEEK: Xavier swept the Big East weekly awards Monday as Trevon Bluiett was named conference player of the week and Sumner secured freshman of the week honors.\n\nBluiett averaged 18 points and 5.5 rebounds in the Musketeers’ 2-0 week. He scored 23 points with six boards against Providence and contributed 11 of his 13 points at Georgetown after halftime.\n\nMack praised the sophomore after the latter outing in Washington, D.C.\n\n“He’s a potent scorer. He’s starting to be an even more complete player, driving the ball, making plays,” Mack said. “Even though he didn’t score (much) in the first half, he got a couple open threes for our team because he drove (Marcus) Derrickson and got in the lane. He’s a tough matchup. I’m really proud of his development.”\n\nSumner nabbed freshman honors for the fifth time this season. He averaged 16.5 points with zero turnovers last week, including a career-high 22 points at Georgetown. Sumner shot 71.4 percent and was 11-for-11 from the free-throw line in both games combined.\n\nBRACKET CHECK: Xavier held strong in the latest major NCAA tournament mock brackets. The Musketeers retained a projected No. 1 seed in Jerry Palm’s bracket on CBSSports.com and stayed at No. 2 in Joe Lunardi’s bracket on ESPN.com.\n\nLunardi, when asked Monday about the chances of XU nabbing a one-seed, said this: “Because of the way the schedule sets up, both for Xavier and others in the hunt for a one-seed, their chances are a little better than one might think. I'd put the odds at one-in-three, presuming a win on Wednesday.”\n\nODDS AND ENDS: The first 3,000 fans at Cintas Center Wednesday will receive a rally towel courtesy of Rockin’ Refuel ...Tickets are sold out, including standing-room only seats, but premium seats are still available at Xavier's preferred ticket reseller, vividseats.com ... Doors open 90 minutes before the game.\n\nNo. 5 Xavier vs. No. 1 Villanova\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Wednesday\n\nWhere: Cintas Center (10,250)\n\nTV/Radio: FOX Sports 1 / WLW-AM (700)"
