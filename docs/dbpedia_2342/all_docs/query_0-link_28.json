Last year was USU's eighth and final season in the WAC before joining the Mountain West on July 1, 2013. The 2012-13 campaign was USU's 14th-straight 21-win season, as Utah State is just one of just five teams in the country to win at least 21 games in each of the past 14 seasons along with Duke, Gonzaga, Kansas and Syracuse. Furthermore, it was the 23rd time in school history that USU had won 20 or more games in a season.\n\nThe 2013-14 edition of Aggie men's basketball is veteran-led with four seniors returning in guard/forward Spencer Butterfield, guards Preston Medlin and TeNale Roland and center Jarred Shaw. A fifth senior, forward Sean Harris, is still recovering from a knee injury that kept him out all of last season, and his progress continues in the early going this season.\n\nLOOKING AT UTAH STATE\n\nUtah State has started a season 5-1 for the second year in a row and the third time in the last four year as part of a total of 11 times in Stew Morrill's 16 seasons as head coach. The Aggies suffered their first defeat of the season on Nov. 30 with an 85-74 loss to BYU at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City. A season-high 20 points from senior guard/forward Spencer Butterfield and a double-double from senior center Jarred Shaw weren't enough to boost the Aggies. Butterfield tied a career-high with four three-pointers Saturday, on the way to a team-leading and season-high 20 points. Shaw logged his second double-double of the season and 10th of his career with 12 points and a game-high tying 13 rebounds, a new season-best. Sophomore forward Kyle Davis posted double-digits for the second game in a row and third this season with 16 points Saturday, just missing his second-straight double-double with nine rebounds, while senior guard Preston Medlin was the fourth Aggie in double-figures with 10 points, while dishing out a season-high seven assists for the second game in a row.\n\nThe Aggies have three players averaging in double-figures for the season, led by Shaw with 15.7 points per game, while Butterfield logs 14.2 ppg and Medlin tallies 14.8 ppg. Meanwhile, Davis is just shy of double-digits at 9.5 ppg. Shaw adds a team-leading 8.0 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game. He is shooting 53.0 percent (35-of-66) from the field as well as 85.7 percent (24-of-28) at the free throw line. Butterfield also averages 5.8 rebounds and 2.0 assists per contest, shooting a team-best 51.9 percent (14-of-27) behind the arc, as part of 52.5 percent (32-of-61) field goal shooting, along with 78.6 percent (11-of-14) at the free pitch stripe.

Davis also averaged 1.2 blocks per game.\n\nAs a team, USU is averaging 79.5 points per game, while making just under half of its field goals at 49.6 percent (167-of-337), including 43.1 percent (44-of-102) from beyond, as well as 75.6 percent (99-of-131) at the free throw line. Defensively, the Aggies are limiting the opposition to 68.3 ppg, while holding them to 42.8 percent (149-of-348) field goal shooting, including just 24.7 percent (24-of-97) from three-point range, as well as 70.4 percent (88-of-125) at the charity stripe. USU has a +9.5 rebounding margin (38.8-29.3), while averaging 17.3 assists, 3.2 blocks and 3.2 steals per game.\n\nAGGIES IN MW STATISTICS\n\nEntering games on Dec. 2 Utah State is first in the Mountain West statistics in three-point field goal percentage defense (.247), as well as second in field goal percentage (.496), free throw percentage (.756), three-point field goal percentage (.431), assists (17.3) and assist/turnover ratio (1.50).

USU suffered its first loss of the season in sliding to 5-1 on the season, being denied its first 6-0 start under head coach Stew Morrill. BYU improved to 6-2 with the win. The Aggies trail in the all-time series, 138-92, in what is USU's oldest and most-played series in school history, with BYU now holding a 2-0 neutral court edge, winning both match-ups at EnergySolutions Arena, Saturday and on Dec. 6, 2008. Butterfield, a senior guard/forward, tied a career-high with four three-pointers Saturday, on the way to a team-leading and season-high 20 points. Fellow senior, center Shaw, logged his second double-double of the season and 10th of his career with 12 points and a game-high tying 13 rebounds, a new season-best.

The Cougars opened a 12-6 lead after a Haws jumper at the 16:27 mark of the first half, but USU closed to tie it at 19-all after a trey by Butterfield with 13:07 on the first half clock. Later, a Carlino jumper put BYU ahead, 31-26 with 8:31 left in the half, but Aggie sophomore guard Marcel Davis later hit a jumper at the 4:13 mark to knot the score at 37-37, the seventh tie of the half. From there, USU closed out the half with a 7-2 run, started by a Medlin three-pointer and capped by a Shaw jumper for a 44-39 Aggie advantage with 2:04 remaining in the first stanza and neither team scored the rest of the half, as the teams went into intermission leading by that score. BYU scored the first six points of the second half to take a 45-44 lead on a Mika layup just 2:28 into the half. USU countered with a 9-2 run, again capped by Shaw, this time with a dunk for a 53-47 Aggie advantage at the 15:11 mark. The Cougars clawed away at the gap and later took a 58-55 lead after a Halford layup with 11:08 to go, but the Aggies countered with a trey from the corner by freshman forward Jalen Moore to knot the score at 58-all at the 11:02 mark. However, that would be the closest USU would get, as BYU pulled away for the win.\n\nPOST-GAME NOTES FROM BYU GAME\n\nTEAM NOTES\n\nâ€¢ USU has now won 34 of its last 44 overall games against in-state opponents and is 42-14 against the state of Utah in the last 14 years.
