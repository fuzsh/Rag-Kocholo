        "text": "The Top-10 SDSU Football Wins in Mission Valley—From GO AZTECS!\n\nNo Comments\n\nBy Ken Ables\n\n(All photos by Aztec Hall of Fame Photographer Ernie Anderson unless noted otherwise)\n\nOn September 15, 1967, the Aztecs kicked off their inaugural season in their new home in Mission Valley with a 16-8 victory over Tennessee State. It was the first of 336 games and 222 Aztec wins in San Diego Stadium, a facility that would change its name in coming years to Jack Murphy, Qualcomm (the “Q”) and SDCCU Stadium. I was in the stands for that first game, along with my parents, Tom and Nancy Ables, and my brother. And I was there for the 222nd and final win in 2019, a 13-3 win over hated BYU. In fact, I was there for all but one of those 222 victories (I missed North Texas State in 1975), and in the stands for 332 total games. And I plan to be at the first game at Snapdragon Stadium September 3rd when the Aztecs kickoff against Arizona on national TV.\n\nIf you are familiar with my family’s history with the Aztecs, you know that my Dad was the greatest college football fan of all time, attending 788 Aztec football games, between his freshman year at State in 1946 and his passing in 2017. He was at every single home game for those 72 seasons, and only missed six games on the road. And when you include college games the Aztecs did not play (Rose Bowls, Holiday Bowls, random college games on bye weeks), he attended more than 825 college football games.\n\nThe Q is gone, of course, and Snapdragon Stadium has been built in the northwest corner of the old stadium’s parking lot on land that is now a part of San Diego State. After two years of “home” games 115 miles away, the Aztecs open the 2022 season on CBS in the first game played on campus since 1966.\n\nSports fans love lists and rankings. The Sons of Montezuma asked me what I considered the Top 10 Aztec wins at the Q. With 222 wins to choose from, that could have been a daunting task. Fortunately, my Dad had already done the heavy lifting. In his book GO AZTECS!, [link?] he lists his favorite games (he would wouldn’t limit himself to a number and wouldn’t rank them within the list).\n\nTo kick off the 100th season of Aztec football – and my 61st and my family’s 77th – and the first season in Snapdragon Stadium, here are my top 10 Aztec wins in Mission Valley from GO AZTECS!, in chronological order:\n\n#10. Southern Mississippi (1968)\n\nThe Southerners, as they were known then, came to San Diego leading the nation in total defense, and had just lost a last-minute heartbreaker to Alabama the week before. While they may have played Alabama close, Southern Miss had never seen anything like Don Coryell’s aerial attack – or his defense. Less than a minute into the game, Fred Dryer returned a USM interception 28 yards for a touchdown. Tom Nettles caught four of Dennis Shaw’s seven touchdown passes. The night before a USM coach had said they wanted to score 100, but that they would try to hold it down. Mission accomplished: Aztecs 68, Southern Miss 7. It was the Aztecs 34th win in their past 35 games. Don Coryell and Fred Dryer are members of the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\n#9. Florida State (1977)\n\nBobby Bowden’s Seminoles came to San Diego 8-1 and ranked #13. FSU alum (and former Seminole RB) Burt Reynolds drove down from Hollywood for the game. FSU was looking to avenge their 1973 loss to the Aztecs and to work on a few things before their game with arch-rival Florida and their bowl. Claude Gilbert’s Aztecs had other ideas. David “Deacon” Turner rushed for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns. QB Joe Davis was 21 for 30 for 228 yards and threw three touchdown passes to Ron Smith. Final score: Aztecs 41, Florida State 16. Aztecs are 2-0 vs. Florida State.\n\n#8. BYU (1986)\n\nThe Aztecs and Cougars met in the final game of the season with the WAC championship – and trip to the Holiday Bowl – on the line. The Aztec D held the high-powered BYU offense to 167 total yards and a single field goal. Chris Hardy rushed for 98 yards and scored on a 17-yard TD run; Kevin Rahill kicked a 39-yard field goal with 5:27 left. It was the second of three games at the Q where the Aztec D held the Cougars without a touchdown. Final: Aztecs 10, BYU 3.\n\n#7. Pacific (1991)\n\nThe Marshall Faulk game. In a game he didn’t even start, Marshall came off the bench and rushed for an NCAA-record 386 yards as a true freshman. And he scored 44 points (7 TDs and a 2-point conversion), another NCAA record. Marshall set nine NCAA records in that game (six still stand), and overnight became the talk of college football. Final score: Aztecs 55, Pacific 34. In his three years with the Aztecs, Marshall was a three-time All-American and a Heisman runner up (and he should have been the winner!). Marshall is a member of the Aztec, College Football and Pro Football Halls of Fame.\n\n#6. Oklahoma (1996)\n\nThe second game of a home-and-home with Oklahoma matched the Aztecs and Sooners in the third week of the season. The Aztecs scored on offense and defense. Billy Blanton threw five touchdown passes (3 to Az Hakim, 2 to Leandrew Childs) and Ricky Parker, who set the Aztec record for interception yardage (146) the previous year in Norman, scored on a 60-yard pick six. He still holds the Aztec career record for interception return yards with 355. Final: Aztecs 51, Oklahoma 31.\n\n#5 Navy (2010)\n\nBowling for the first time in 12 seasons, and looking for their first bowl win in 41, Brady Hoke’s second Aztec team earned a spot in the 2010 Poinsettia Bowl with an 8-4 record. The first half was close after Navy scored with :07 left to cut the Aztecs’ lead to 21-14. Ronnie Hillman scored two second half TDs – a 15 yard pass from Ryan Lindley and a 1 yard run – and the Aztec D shut the Midshipmen out to give the Aztecs a 35-14 win. Ronnie rushed for 228 yards and was named offensive MVP of the game.\n\n#4. Boise State (2013)\n\nMost of the Mountain West seems to be flummoxed by the Boise State’s reputation and their weird field. But not the Aztecs. A year after beating the Broncos in Boise in 2012, the Aztecs went for two in a row, this time on green grass, as the football gods intended. With the Broncos up 28-21 with 4:04 left, Tim Vizzi returned a Bronco punt 41 yards for a touchdown to tie the game. The Broncos got the ball first in overtime and were held to a field goal. Aztec ball. Quinn Kaehler’s 10-yard touchdown pass to Colin Lockett ended the game. Final score: Aztecs 34, Boise St. 31. Colin’s catch was the perfect bookend to the 2012-13 Boise State games: in 2012 he returned the opening kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. For good measure, the Aztecs went to Boise to play Buffalo in the 2013 Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. A 49-24 win. That gave the Aztecs 3 wins versus or in Boise in two seasons.\n\n#3. Air Force (2015)\n\nRocky Long’s 2015 Aztecs ran the MW table with a perfect 8-0 record and earned the right to host the Mountain West Championship Game. Freshman QB Christian Chapman, in his first career start, was 9-14 for 203 yards and a touchdown pass to RB Donnel Pumphrey, who also rushed for 90 yards. Donny Hageman’s 46-yard field goal with 5:10 left gave the Aztecs a 3-point lead. Final score: Aztecs 27, Air Force 24. It was the first of back-to-back MW Championships.\n\n#2. Cal (2016)\n\nRecords broken, winning streaks begun. Donnel Pumphrey rushed for a career-high 281 yards and broke Marshall Faulk’s Aztec career rushing record. Rashaad Penny returned a Cal kickoff 100 yards for his fourth career kickoff return TD, breaking Colin Lockett’s Aztec record. And they didn’t stop there: DJ finished his career as the all-time NCAA rusher with 6,405 yards. Rashaad returned three more kickoffs and a punt for touchdowns, tying the NCAA record for career kickoffs returned for touchdowns (7) and all kicks (8). The 45-40 victory over the Golden Bears was sealed with a Damontae Kazee interception with less than a minute to play. Since that game in 2016, the Aztecs are 7-2 vs. the PAC-12. DJ finished the season with 2,133 yards and Rashaad with 1,018, making the 2016 Aztecs the only team in NCAA history with a 2,000- and 1,000-yard rusher.\n\n#1. Stanford (2017)\n\nRanked power 5 opponent. Brother vs. brother. Blackout. Last-minute win. Fans rushing the field. The Aztec-Stanford game featured everything an Aztec fan could ask for. The Cardinal came to town ranked #19, 1-1 and looking for their first win in the United States (they opened with a win 62-7 win over Rice in Sydney, Australia). The game was close, with neither team leading by more than four points. Aztec receiver Mikah Holder and his twin, Cardinal DB Alijah faced off for the only time in college, with family bragging rights for life on the line. Down 17-13 with 6:15 left, the Aztecs started their game-winning drive on their own 25. Five plays later, the Aztecs had moved to the Cardinal 42. And then the lights went out. For 22 minutes. Momentum killer? Hardly. Rashaad Penny carried three times for 11 yards and Christian Chapman completed all three of his passes; the final one a perfectly executed play action where the linebacker bit on a fake to Penny, leaving TE David Wells open. He made the catch and dove into the end zone for the final score of the game with :54 left. Kameron Kelly’s interception on the final Stanford drive sealed the W: Aztecs 20, Stanford 17. Fans had been gathering around the edge of the Plaza and Field levels, and once the game ended, they rushed the field for the only time in 53 seasons at the stadium.\n\nThere were other great wins, including Miami, Wisconsin, Arizona State, the first win over Florida State, closing out the Q with wins over long-time rivals Fresno State and BYU. But these are my favorite 10. My Dad may not have wanted to pick a favorite, but I’m not a bit hesitant. Whether or it’s recency bias or not, the 2017 Stanford game is my favorite win at the old stadium. What’s yours?\n\nSnapdragon Stadium: Where Aztecs Family Legacy Calls Home\n\nNo Comments\n\nThis past Saturday marked the first live event ever to have taken place at the newly completed Snapdragon Stadium. SDSU’s second major sports & entertainment facility is officially an on campus stadium, however the surrounding expansion research campus may take some time to fill in. Until then, Sons of Montezuma took the opportunity to document the new stadium grounds with our first tailgate and the insides of the general admission and field club levels.\n\nFinishing on time and under budget were not the first two conclusions some San Diego residents believed would be the fate of the SDSU West plan. A city full of pro sports agony in terms of ownership relations with our political system, had taken it’s toll on the psyche of America’s finest city.\n\nAfter seeing for ourselves the fullness of the Friends of SDSU’s vision come to life in this opening scrimmage, we are sure glad not everyone fed into this woe is me mentality. And certainly YOU, the fan, the San Diego City voter did not as well.\n\nSo what are the coolest features of this new Snapdragon Stadium?\n\nInside, some features that you must experience are The Piers.\n\nTaking the stairs up on the south endzone you can get an unbelievable view hanging over the field just enough where you feel you are out in OB looking over Sunset Cliffs. Some are even beginning to rename the Piers to the “Diving Board” given the slight bounce that you feel when someone jumps up & down on the structure. Maybe not the best feeling for everyone but it is slight and adds to the excitement of the experience.\n\nNext up would be the Field Club Team Entrance. Now this was by far the coolest feature. The field club is exactly what it says—Field Club ticket access. So this is a premium experience. We were fortunate to have this access for the first scrimmage game and it is worth the price of admission.\n\nWatching the team uncaged from their players locker room to walk out in the middle of the club lounge and onto the 50 yard line of Bashor Field is incredibly exciting stuff. The sights and sounds of the energy builds up between you and the players ready to run out. We can’t imagine that first night game when certainly lights and effects will come in to add to the experience. A great idea would be to have camera’s inside for this moment to share on the big screens for all the fans to watch from their seats. But if that doesn’t happen, the field club level is the place to be and buy into.\n\nTake a brief look at some of the general highlights of our Snapdragon Stadium visit all though the lends of riding a mobility scooter. It was a great way to get around the stadium quickly and all the staff was very nice and courteous.\n\nFor over 50 years SDSU had been a tenant of the City of San Diego owned San Diego Stadium (Jack Murphy, Qualcomm, SDCCU). For the beginning of that half century time period San Diego County witnessed all the highs and lows of an Aztecs football program could have.\n\nAztecs fans during all this time, had witnessed the high flying offenses led by Don Air Coryell with a bevy of future NFL Hall of Fame coaches & players, to the majestic Marshall Faulk taking the college football world by storm, and lastly the unprecedented Rocky Long regime led by some incredible defenses and Donnel Pumphrey shredding the NCAA record books.\n\nOne man was able to see up to 788 of these games through SDSU history, some even predating the old San Diego Stadium, back to Aztec Bowl and Balboa Stadium. That man was the late great Tom Ables.\n\nThe Sons of Montezuma are honored to have on board one of Tom’s sons, Ken Ables as one of our article contributors to our SoM team. Ken who was often by his father’s side, was there for so many games with the family and can clearly recount his earliest games of the Aztecs back in the silver helmet & pants days.\n\nLast season we sat down with Ken to record our SDSU Football history podcast episode. The Able’s family tradition of SDSU football has been collected and published in the form of the ‘GO AZTECS’ book now available on Amazon and other retailers.\n\nKen was able to share a few words on what this new stadium means to him now that the memories live on with him and his family. NBC 7 San Diego’s Joe Little caught up with Ken just before the scrimmage day.\n\nWalking around Snapdragon for the scrimmage, you definitely could get a sense of the family atmosphere all around. Friendly faces smiling and taking it all in. For the Ables family their father Tom’s old seats still remain on the concourses as a reminder and celebration of what and who was once here before us—cheering on our Aztecs.\n\nThere’s a San Diego State football legacy there for all to see and embrace. And perhaps for some other young boy or girl, the beginnings of their own family’s Aztec football legacy.\n\nSWISH!—The Sound of San Diego’s Premier Summer Pro-Am Basketball League\n\nNo Comments\n\nFor college basketball fans, once confetti falls and the “One Shining Moment” song plays at the conclusion of the national championship game, reality sets in that it will be another 6 months before college basketball tips off again. Historically, summer has been a painful waiting period for Aztec hoop heads like myself. Fortunately, since 2019, the Swish Pro-Am League has filled the void with summer basketball entertainment.\n\nThe premier summer pro-am league in San Diego County which runs from June 23rd-August 6th at La Jolla Country Day School will feature many current and former Aztec players.\n\nLast summer, Matt Bradley, the coveted transfer from Cal, made his debut in the Swish Pro-Am and social media began buzzing about the talent he was bringing to San Diego State. Watching that game in person, I witnessed a true 3 level scorer and the next great Aztec hooper. Bradley went on to lead his team to a Swish League title and took home MVP honors of the league.\n\nThis summer, 13 current players on the 2022-2023 SDSU roster are on teams for the Swish League. The only notable absences are Adam Seiko and Aguek Arop. Most Aztec players will not be playing in the league until they return to campus for 2nd semester summer school which begins on July 5th.\n\nThe former players and Aztecs4Life who are on rosters include Trey Pulliam, Devin Watson, Kam Rooks, Skylar Spencer, D.J. Gay, Billy White and Deshawn Stephens.\n\nIn addition to Aztec players, Swish showcases the best professionals and college basketball players in San Diego County. Two years ago, Evan Mobley, the 3rd pick in the 2021 NBA draft, was the MVP of Swish and won the championship alongside his brother Isaiah who played at USC and declared for the 2022 NBA draft.\n\nFormer college standouts like Evan Fitzner, who played for Saint Mary’s and Indiana, San Diego legend Johnny Dee and Tommy Rutherford, a starter at UC Irvine, have been fixtures in the summer league. Kale Catchings, a Duke transfer portal signee will also be playing.\n\nSteve Lavin, the new coach at little brother USD, has pulled in an impressive haul of college transfers to stock his roster for next year. Among them, transfers Eric Williams Jr. from Oregon and Jaiden Delaire from Stanford are listed on Swish League rosters. The level of competition in the league this summer will be very high and exciting to watch.\n\nThe Seeds of Swish League\n\nKwaku Amaoku, also known as Coach Ku, is the co-founder/CEO of the Swish Foundation and Commissioner of the Swish Pro-Am League. Coach Ku moved to the San Diego area around 1991-1992. He played basketball at San Marcos High and Mira Costa Junior College but had no college offers after he finished JUCO.\n\nA San Diego pro-am league just formed by the father of San Diego high school basketball legend Josh Merrill was the showcase Coach Ku needed to get the attention of college basketball coaches. His play in the summer league led to a full athletic basketball scholarship to Grand Canyon University.\n\nNow Coach Ku is giving back to the community that helped him pursue his college dreams. He co-founded the Swish Pro-Am League in 2019 with Michael Howell whose son Mikey is the all-time leader in assists at UCSD and other son Chris is a redshirt freshman guard at Saint Mary’s.\n\nHowell and Amoaku wanted to create an opportunity for local high-level players to “be able to get the work in in the summer instead of just doing workouts and playing pickup ball at LA Fitness. Good competitive runs against good competitive players.”\n\nCoach Ku would like the pro-am league to have a long existence in the San Diego basketball community. “We’re trying to get this to be something that runs for 40 years. The same thing like the Drew [League in L.A.] or the thing they do in Houston [No Excuses Summer Pro League]” Coach Ku said.\n\nThe Swish League is in its 4th season and continues to grow. A 4 team women’s league will debut this year in addition to the 12 team men’s league.\n\nA.Y.B.O. – African Youth Basketball Organization\n\nCoach Ku is also the founder of the African Youth Basketball Organization (AYBO) which has brought several high school and college prospects to the United States from Ghana. Per AYBO’s website, their goal is to give students from Africa “the opportunity to gain high school diplomas and college degrees as well as play the game of basketball at the highest levels.”\n\nAmong those players who Coach Ku has helped is current Aztec player Nathan Mensah and former player Joel Mensah who is now playing at Cal State San Marcos.\n\nAYBO holds basketball camps in Ghana to identify young student-athletes who can excel both in the classroom and on the basketball court. Those who are fortunate to be selected and want to participate in the program, receive assistance through AYBO to make the transition to studying and playing basketball in the U.S.\n\nNathan and Joel Mensah are two prime examples of success the A.Y.B.O has been able to bless in their basketball careers. San Diego’s rich diversity is the perfect atmosphere to embrace this international outreach. But not every player will receive the same notoriety as both Nathan and Joel Mensah.\n\n“There’s a lot of kids that we’v brought here to the U.S. from Africa. Nathan is just the most recognizable because of SDSU being a National program. So they don’t get the same recognition, but there’s a lot of kids out there that we’re trying to help, that have similar stories as Nathan, where they’re just trying to do this for their families.” details Amoaku.\n\n“If anyone knows Nathan, that’s why he’s here, that’s why he’s doing this…he sacrificed a lot to be here and there’s a lot of kids that will do the same.”\n\nFor more information about AYBO, read the stories of the youth they are reaching out to or if you would like to make a donation to help their cause, please visit www.aybohoops.com.\n\nAn All-Time Aztec? Willie Steele Jumps to the top of a long List\n\n1 Comment\n\nMessage boards and Twitter threads have replaced the water cooler as the forum for discussing and arguing sports today. Boomers and millennials, each sure their generation’s athletes are the best, try to convince the others that their contemporaries are superior, with little luck in changing anyone’s mind.\n\nWhile comparing generations in basketball, football or baseball are all subject to personal bias, some sports, like track and field or swimming are easy to decide: the fastest or highest or longest is the best, regardless of when it happened.\n\nA great example – and one with an Aztec angle – is the men’s long jump. The 2022 NCAA champ in the men’s long jump is Wayne Pinnock from Tennessee, with a winning jump of 26’3” on June 8. Congratulations.\n\nSo why are we talking about an athlete from another school in a sport in which San Diego State doesn’t even field a team? Because of a great Aztec athlete whose name you may or may not know. If you don’t, you really should if you consider yourself an Aztec fan.\n\nWillie Steele, a long jumper on the Aztec track and field team was the first world-class athlete from San Diego State. Willie was also the first Aztec to win a D-1 individual national championship with a winning jump of 26’6”. In 1947.\n\nLet that sink in. The winning long jump (known then as the broad jump) from 75 years ago would have won the 2022 NCAA title by 3 inches. 75 YEARS!\n\nWillie was also the 1947 National AAU champion and won the gold medal at the London Olympics in 1948. Interestingly, neither of those jumps were farther than 26’6”.\n\nWillie’s jumping ability also had a direct impact on the Ables family. My Dad Tom, just out of the Navy, was a freshman at State and sports editor of the Aztec (before it became a daily) for the 1946-47 school year. The school had a general PR guy, but no one dedicated to sports publicity or information.\n\nWith Willie and javelin thrower Bill Morales both qualifying for the NCAA finals, the athletic department determined that a dedicated sports publicity director was needed. Since he was the sports editor, Tom was asked first. He accepted immediately, and it launched a 70 year career in marketing and publicity, and a love of Aztec sports.\n\nTom, Willie and Bill, along with head coach Choc Sportsman and athletic director Bill Terry drove to the finals at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Here’s how Tom described Willie’s winning jump in the foreword to his book GO AZTECS!:\n\n“At the meet, Willie was absolutely incredible! I happened to be down on the field at the time. His winning jump of 26’6” just barely missed Jesse Owens’ world record at the time, 26’8¼”.\n\n“I remember standing there watching Willie as he jumped several inches back on the board to make sure he did not foul. From toe to landing, he had to have flown at least 26’9”. And the world record would have come back with him to little San Diego State College!”\n\nWith all that jumping talent one might think that Willie would concentrate only on track and field. Nope. Other Aztec teams needed Willie and he was happy to oblige. He played basketball, jumping center at 6’1”, and first base on the baseball team.\n\nHe gave football a try, but was injured in a scrimmage and never got in a game. Tom, who had seen thousands of Aztecs compete in nearly every sport SDSU sponsors (and some it no longer does) said Willie was the greatest pure Aztec athlete he had ever seen.\n\nWillie defended his NCAA title in 1948. Other championships include the 1948 Olympic trials and Olympics, 1946 and 1947 AAU.\n\nWillie is a member of the inaugural class of the Aztec Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame and the Hall of Champions in San Diego. After track, Willie spent most of his working career in Oakland as a director in the parks department. He passed away at age 66 in 1989.\n\nTrack and Field is one of the most successful programs in SDSU athletics history, with numerous national champions and Olympic medalists for both Aztec men and women, including Arnie Robinson, Whitney Ashley, Bob Smith, Shanieka Thomas Ricketts and many others. And, of course, Willie Steele.\n\nThe Aztec women’s team has won the last two Mountain West outdoor championships, four of the past five, and have sent athletes to 24 of the past 25 NCAA Outdoor Championships, including the 4×100 and 4×400 relay teams this year.\n\nBut there’s no men’s team, and that’s a shame. One of SDSU’s most successful programs was discontinued 30 years ago. And it’s also personal to the Ables family. Not only did the program launch my Dad’s career (which I continue, along with my son), I was a member of the 1976 and 1977 men’s track team as a discus and hammer thrower, and my cousin Mark was a hurdler on the 1972-75 teams.\n\nGO AZTECS! – and bring back Men’s Track!\n\nWatch below for the first of our All-Time Aztecs Basketball player list, Milton “Milky” Phelps.\n\nThe Fighting Aztecs of WWII\n\n1 Comment\n\nStudents at what was then called San Diego State College in early 1941 were living the high life. The majority of them were involved in Greek life, organizations, and clubs like acapella, fencing club, and the Ice-Tecs (ice-skating) — to name a few. With a population of just over 200,000 people at the time, the sights of SD were more accessible and the beaches were far less crowded. Peaceful paradise.\n\nUp on the beautiful new Montezuma Mesa campus, Walter R. Hepner was the university president and the Aztecs had just won the NAIA Basketball National Championship. Being runners up the previous two years, the Aztecs finally got over the hump in the 32-team single-elimination tournament in Kansas City by beating Murray State 36-34 in the championship game. The third time was the charm. Students and the community celebrated their victory with a parade and greeted the returning champs at the Sante Fe Depot Station in downtown San Diego. It was an exciting time for all who attended.\n\nThe Aztec, March 18, 1941. “Cagers” was a popular term for basketball players because games were played in a cage at the time. Eerily foreshadowing WW2, an SBD Dauntless Divebomber is pictured on the front page\n\nTheir celebration didn’t last long. Just 9 months later, the country was at war with the Axis Powers. The championship trophy hadn’t even accumulated dust yet. Like most men around the country, many who had graduated from, attended, or would eventually attend San Diego State sprung to answer the call of military service. It is estimated that there were more than 3,500 Fighting Aztecs involved in the conflict. At least 152 of them were confirmed to have perished by the war’s end.\n\nThe Aztec Newsletter was the brilliant idea of Dr. Lauren C. Post, a San Diego State College geography professor and football coach. The newsletter was created so that students, alumni, families, and soldiers could stay up to date with information on the men scattered around the globe that attended San Diego State.\n\nSDSU was a whole lot smaller than it is today—try around 2,000 students total. Most people knew each other. These were classmates, friends, and neighbors that waved at each other with friendly smiles.\n\nThe newsletter started off as a collection of letters but as the war progressed, included a list of fatalities, casualties, MIA, promotions, awards, and other updates. It launched on May 6th, 1942, and spanned 48 issues until March 1946. Each issue was mailed to around 3000 monthly readers at home and abroad. Dr. Post did an excellent job keeping the SDSU community connected, wherever they were in the world. Each edition was extremely detailed with as much information as he could collect. It was the only newsletter of its kind in the nation that compiled students’ wartime experiences from a single university. Not only did the newsletter preserve history, but it also served as a testament to San Diego State’s pride during wartime.\n\nThe Fighting Aztecs\n\nThe first Aztec lost his life at the hands of battle in May 1940, a full year and a half before America’s involvement in WW2. Richard D. Aubert was originally from Canada but graduated from San Diego High and attended SDSU shortly after. He sensed a war brewing in Europe and figured that North America would be involved sooner or later. In 1938, he returned to Canada without telling his mother and became a pilot in the Royal Air Force.\n\nOnce war broke out in Europe, Aubert was stationed in England and would readily fly across the English Channel to combat the German Luftwaffe. Piloting an RAF Supermarine Spitfire fighter, Aubert was credited with one kill of a Nazi Ju-88 Bomber before being shot down near Dunkirk, France. His body was never recovered as the British Expeditionary Forces were already retreating out of the country because of the overwhelming German blitzkrieg during The Battle of France.\n\nBack home, fears of the European war were brewing but life carried on as normal until Pearl Harbor was suddenly attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan in December 1941. Eventually, each player of the San Diego State College 1941 national championship team, a team manager, and head coach Morris Gross left San Diego to serve during the Second World War. Three of them did not return home.\n\nThe first-ever death reported in the Aztec Newsletter was of Aztec basketball great, Atwell Milton “Milky” Phelps. Milky was a co-captain of that 1941 national championship team, a 3x team MVP, a 1000+ point scorer, and was the first major-school First Team All-American in school history. In November of 1942, he died in an overland US Navy aerial training exercise in Corpus Christi, Texas. He was going to become a pilot and would have likely served in the Pacific. His death was reported across the nation in the New York Times because of his accomplishments on the basketball court. Milky was eventually inducted into the SDSU HOF Class of 1988 and has had his #22 jersey “retired” by the university.\n\nThe student newspaper, The Aztec, now named The Daily Aztec, announced his death with the following statement: “‘Milky’ Phelps is dead, and with his death passes an age in San Diego State College athletic history. An age in which by the ability and magnetism of one person, another who gave others rise to talents long hidden in them and pulled themselves to unscaled heights.”\n\nThe news of Phelps’ death made the war a reality on campus. One student wrote, “Perhaps all of us will awaken — awaken and realize that it is going to take a lot more cool thinking and a hell of a lot more hot fighting before we come out on top”. A few Fighting Aztecs expressed that they now had a personal reason to fight after hearing the news. For many students, he was the first person that they knew whose death was tied to the conflict. Unfortunately, many more would follow on various fronts.\n\nTo keep up spirits following more early student deaths, President Hepner wrote in Aztec Newsletter no. 10, “The Aztec spirit and service extend throughout the world!… From all sections of the globe we receive splendid reports of Aztec action and contribution and always, dare I say, with a feeling of “fatherly pride!” The sons of Montezuma carry on!”\n\nPaul Arthur Fern, known as “Stump”, was the manager and mascot of the national championship team. Beyond that, he was heavily involved on campus. Fern served as the President of Associated Men’s Students, was a member of the Blue Key Honor Society, the Delta Eta Omega Fraternity, most recently known at SDSU as Kappa Sigma, Glee Club, and played on the freshman basketball team in 1937.\n\nThe Navy Ensign had a sense of humor. He wrote Professor Post in January of 1943, “Please tell Doc. [Lewis] Lesley I’d like to be sitting in on one of his Modern Germany lectures, at this present time. I’ll bet the Furher’s ears are burning”.\n\nIn August 1943, Fern was killed during a beach landing operation for the land Battle of Vella Lavella in the South Pacific. He left behind a wife, Dorothea, and a few-week-old baby girl, Linda, whom he had never met. Linda Fern eventually attended SDSU in the early 1960s and, to Dr. Post’s surprise, he emotionally discovered that she was a student in one of his geography courses.\n\nMason Willard “Tex” Harris went from being a co-captain of the 1941 national championship team to an Army Captain serving with the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion in Europe.\n\nHarris fought with his unit and the 101st airborne at the strategically important crossroad town of Bastogne during the Battle of the Buldge. Bastogne is storied as a battle with some of the harshest fighting conditions in Europe. Being severely under-equipped with minimal supplies and summer clothing during that brutal Belgian winter of December 1944, he, along with his fellow soldiers, held out the surrounded city of Bastogne and defended its northeastern flank until General George Patton’s Third Army relieved and rescued them. Throughout the siege, with incredible efficiency, Harris’ battalion destroyed around 40 German tanks and lost only six M18 Hellcat Tanks.\n\nIn a letter to Dr. Post, dated January 30th, 1945, Harris recalled the Battle of Bastogne as “Quite an event and a job well done.” He wrote, “We were getting low on supplies and we got our first supply by air. I have never seen anything so beautiful as those C47s & fighter protection as they came in low circled and got their signal from pathfinders who were dropped the day before and then came back & started their drop of supplies. Those colored chutes as they floated down were beautiful & words can’t describe the feeling… Doc it’s not possible to put on paper what one feels in those instances.” Harris also mentioned that there were many stories from that battle that he simply could not bring himself to describe.\n\nHarris was killed in action pushing toward the Rhine River in Germany on March 3rd, 1945, just two months before the Allies achieved victory in Europe. He was survived by a wife and daughter. He never met his 3-month-old baby girl who was born while he was fighting in Bastogne.\n\nD-Day\n\nThere were a great many San Diego State students who stormed the beaches and parachuted onto the lands of Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, 1944. Each whose sole mission was to liberate the oppressed people of Europe and take down the German war machine.\n\nFollowing D-Day, in Aztec Newsletter no. 29, Dr. Post’s opening address stated, “As of this date (July 13), I have checked various sources, and really, it seems that State College did not lose a single man in Normandy or the English Channel… only Lt. James White was injured… It is almost unbelievable that we could have made the invasion without a single Aztec being lost.” Indeed, it was too good to be true.\n\nLater, it was discovered that SDSU graduate, Herman Addleson, was killed parachuting into Normandy during the early hours of D-Day when he landed in a flooded field and drowned. Nazis were ordered to flood fields as a part of the Atlantic Wall defense. He is the only known Aztec to be killed in action during the Day of Days.\n\nAddleson participated in the choir, ran track for SDSU, and graduated from the university in 1941. Some knew him as “the guy who sold Coke’s at San Diego State’s basketball games”.\n\nAddleson didn’t have to enlist in the military. His cleft lip made him 4F, or unfit for military service. The Army informed him that if he had that fixed, he would be eligible to enlist. He didn’t have enough funds to pay for the operation. However, baseball Hall of Famer and local San Diegan, Ted Williams, heard of Addleson’s story and the Red Sox legend fully paid for the procedure.\n\nOn the 1st of May 1944, while stationed in England just a month before the invasion and his death, Addleson wrote Dr. Post, “Seems like a lot of Aztecs are over here, yet I haven’t been able to get around to locate any, except Tom Rice and Guy Sessions, buddy paratroopers. We are going to give those Nazi[s] hell on “D” Day, so you can see old Aztec is well represented in the Airborne outfit.”\n\nHerman Addleson and Tom Rice were both members of the newly formed 101st Airborne Division, known as the Screaming Eagles. The unit was popularized in HBO’s ‘Band of Brothers’ WW2 Miniseries, which debuted in the early 2000s and now has a cult-like following. The Airborne recruited athletes and college students. Addleson and Rice checked off both boxes because they both ran track together for the Aztecs.\n\nTom Rice was a risk-taker, which he noted as his motivation for joining the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the 101st Airborne. There he was the number one jumper of an 18-man paratrooper squad on D-Day and served as a platoon leader for half a year.\n\nShortly before Rice made his jump into Normandy, he was violently thrown out of his C-47 aircraft and dangled there by his wedged arm. He was able to release himself, but during the experience lost his prized watch, which he jokes that he “hopes some good Frenchman found it.” Upon parachuting into France, he destroyed communication outposts around the Cotentin Peninsula and fought to control small towns in that region including Sainte-Mère-Église and the town of Carentan, where he is now an honorary citizen.\n\nIn addition to Rice serving in Normandy, highlights of his service include helping liberate Holland by taking part in Operation Market Garden, fighting in the Battle of the Buldge, where he was pinned down in Bastogne for hours and shot in the leg and arm by a German sniper, and assisting in capturing The Eagle’s Nest, the nickname for Hitler’s retreat in the Bavarian Alps town of Berchtesgaden in southern Germany.\n\nWhile Rice was in Berchtesgaden, the war came to a close with the death of Hitler and the full surrender of Germany. The 101st had some downtime and some formed a track team. With Rice being on that track team at San Diego State, he ran in the 5,000-meter race there and lost to another soldier from UCLA by 20 yards. Of course, Rice was still recovering from the bullet wounds he received in Belgium. Years later, while Rice was coaching cross-country for Chula Vista High School, he had met the man again as an opposing coach at a meet. The soldier from UCLA didn’t recognize him, nor did Rice mention Berchtesgaden, but Rice made sure that his team came out victorious that day.\n\nTom Rice was honorably discharged from the Army in December 1945 and returned to SDSU to earn his degree. He received 6 elective units for his service — Those who served as officers were granted 9 units. He went on to teach history and government at San Diego schools for more than 40 years, married his wife Brenda, and had five children.\n\nHe again parachuted into Normandy from a C-47 aircraft for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion at age 97, made another jump into Holland at age 98, and lastly freefell into Coronado, California for his 100th birthday in 2021. Tom Rice is still alive and well, being one of the last living WW2 veterans. He currently lives in his childhood home in Coronado.\n\nDedicated to the 152 Fighting Aztecs who made the ultimate sacrifice. For more on all of their stories, read Supreme Sacrifice, Extraordinary Service: Profiles of SDSU Military Alumni by Robert Fikes Jr., Emeritus Librarian of San Diego State University.\n\nTo everyone in and around the SDSU community who has or is currently serving, thank you for your service and sacrifice. We hope to never again lose another son or daughter of Montezuma to the hands of battle.\n\nSaturdays Are For the Sons: Caden & Cooper McDonald—Brothers in Blood, Football and Business\n\nNo Comments\n\nEarlier this week it was the Sons of Montezuma’s absolute pleasure when both Caden & Cooper McDonald put pen to paper and immediately became the 3rd & 4th members to our Sons of Monty N.I.L. Team.\n\nCaden, the super senior linebacker and team captain, returns to SDSU to open up a soon to be San Diego landmark at Snapdragon Stadium (which coincidentally just got the green light to complete its final sale of a sliver of land to build out the rest of the development). But more importantly to #54, is to conquer the Mountain West Conference and tackle the program’s elusive 22nd football championship.\n\nThe motivation to be a champion undoubtedly drives this competitor. But the prospects of returning for an extra season and accomplish his goals just got sweeter in the off season. Not that an NIL partnership agreement with the Boot Barn wasn’t enticing enough of course.\n\nWith younger brother and fellow linebacker Cooper deciding to enter the transfer portal after attending the University of Washington, the writing was on the wall and all the makings of a brotherly reunion in San Diego seemed highly likely.\n\nAnd so it came to pass that Cooper McDonald did indeed pack his bags and headed out of the Pacific Northwest, down the trail to Sunny San Diego, and became a prized addition to the vaunted Aztecs defense.\n\nSons of Montezuma knew immediately that we wanted the McDonald brothers on our team! With 2021 being the first season of legally permissible NIL agreements with student athletes, Sons of Montezuma had an overwhelmingly positive experience working with SDSU stand out players Greg Bell and Matt Araiza.\n\nSigning Caden & Cooper to this 2022 Sons of Monty Team is a huge deal for us. To represent a family this way is an ultimate honor. The greatest aspect of College football that makes it better than almost any other form of the game, IS the close knit family aspect.\n\nEveryone wants the NFL dream of playing at the highest level of your position. But often times the business and harsh realities of the league, don’t always shine the brightest of lights on a footballers time in the machine. These signings helped fulfill one of the most important visions for the SOM brand.\n\nOur desire is not only to be a hub of information for SDSU Alumni and fans, or just to create fun experiences and unique products. But Sons of Montezuma seeks to create opportunities and an outlet that bridges the gap between the Aztecs men who put on the greatest football helmet in all of Collegiate Sports and their faithful family & friends they call, Aztecs4Life.\n\nThe Specifics\n\nOur partnership agreement with Caden & Cooper provides them each with their own Shersey (T-shirt/Jersey) with the Sons of Montezuma brand name on the front chest, their official number front and back, and most importantly their proud McDonald last name big and bold on the backside for all to see.\n\nArtistic renderings are still pending final sign off by the McDonald duo and the release date will be officially announced at a later time. But for a glimpse of what this style will reflect, look no further than our Sons of Montezuma Official Matt Araiza t-shirt, still for sale now in our online shop!\n\nAlso included is a separate t-shirt style that will feature both McDonald brothers on the front in an illustration style with much more creativity and fun for those fans that want something more unique.\n\nLastly, we look forward to featuring exclusive interviews with both Caden & Cooper McDonald on the original and longest tenured Aztecs football podcast show, the Sons of Montezuma Podcast.\n\nWe thank Caden & Cooper McDonald for seeing this vision and partnering with Sons of Montezuma. And we look forward to many more collaborations and partnerships with more Aztecs footballers this 100th season of SDSU football.\n\nListen below for the latest episode of the Sons of Montezuma Podcast featuring San Diego high school recruiting tracker Ruben Peña Sr of SDFNL. Also our resident coach, former SDSU assistant Coach C gives his full QB transfer Braxton Burmeister scouting report. Listen & Subscribe today!"
