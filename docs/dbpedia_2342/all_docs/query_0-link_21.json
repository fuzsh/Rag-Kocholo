Visit www.gocreighton.com and click on the Live Stats tab on the left-hand side of the page for links the exact link.\n\nHome games can also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nUpdates are also provided on the athletic department's Twitter page (@gocreighton).\n\nScouting Creighton\n\nCreighton brings a 22-14 record into Monday night's game, the program's 12th 20-win season in the past 13 years.\n\nThe Bluejays have posted three double-digit victories in the CBI thus far, an 85-74 victory over San Jose State on March 15, a 102-92 win over Davidson on Monday and a 82-64 triumph over UCF last Wednesday.\n\nThe Bluejays tied for fourth in the MVC after finishing with a 10-8 league record.\n\nFreshman Doug McDermott, son of first-year head coach Greg McDermott, leads Creighton in scoring (15.0 ppg.) and in rebounding (7.6 rpg.). He's been in double-figures in 30 of 36 games and paces the MVC with nine double-doubles. He is the first MVC freshman to be named first-team all-MVC since 1951-52, and has averaged 24.3 points and 7.3 rebounds in three CBI games.\n\nSecond on the team in scoring is junior point guard Antoine Young. Young averages 13.3 points per game and leads the MVC in assists (178), assists per game (4.9), assist/turnover ratio (2.62) and minutes (1,288). He owns 27 assists and no turnovers in three CBI games.\n\nGiving the Jays a big tandem inside is sophomore Gregory Echenique (10.3 ppg., 5.6 rpg., 1.8 bpg.) and senior Kenny Lawson Jr. (9.2 ppg., 5.6 rpg.). Lawson was voted preseason MVC Player of the Year and has paced the league in blocked shots each of the previous two seasons, while Echenique is second in rejections this season. Echenique leads the MVC in blocked shots per game and field goal percentage.\n\nCreighton owns an impressive 520/424 assist/turnover ratio and has made almost as many free throws (490) than the opposition has attempted (544).\n\nScouting Oregon\n\nLed by former Creighton coach Dana Altman, Oregon is 19-17 on the season, including five wins in the last six games. The Ducks finished 7-11 in conference play, then advanced to the Pacific-10 Conference Tournament semifinals with wins over Arizona State and UCLA.\n\nSecond-team all-conference pick Joevan Catron leads the Ducks in scoring (15.5 ppg.) and rebounding (6.7 rpg.).\n\nE.J. Singler, brother of Duke standout Kyle Singler, is second on the team with 11.7 points per game. He's shooting 39.5 percent from three-point range and is second on the club with 51 three-point baskets.\n\nMalcolm Armstead paces the Ducks with 80 steals and 153 assists while chipping in 8.6 points per game.\n\nOregon averages 70.0 points per game and allows 69.2 per contest. They are outrebounded by 1.8 caroms per contest, but force 15.4 turnovers per game.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his first season as head coach at Creighton, but is no stranger to coaching in the state of Nebraska or in the Missouri Valley Conference. McDermott was hired in April after spending the previous four seasons as head coach at Iowa State (2006-10). He has also been a head coach at Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nMcDermott owns a head coaching record of 302-209 in 17 seasons, a 171-145 mark in 10 Division I years and an 22-14 mark in his first year at Creighton.\n\nHe is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Steve Merfeld.\n\nDana Altman (Eastern New Mexico, 1980) is in his first year as head coach of the Ducks. He owns a 19-17 mark at Oregon and a career record of 430-260 (.623) in his 22nd year as a NCAA Division I head coach. Creighton's all-time winningest coach with 327 wins, Altman Altman was named a coach on the MVC's All-Centennial Team in 2007. He has led his teams to the postseason in 14 straight seasons, and is assisted by Kevin McKenna, Brian Fish and Tony Stubblefield.\n\nThe Series With Oregon\n\nOregon won the only previous meeting with Creighton, 75-64 on Dec. 26, 1974 in Portland, Ore. The Ducks were ranked 19th at the time, and the contest was played as part of the Far West Classic.\n\nGreg McDermott has never faced Oregon, and is 2-9 when coaching against Dana Altman. Altman has never coached against Creighton.\n\n20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton's March 15 win over San Jose State gave the Bluejays 20 or more wins for the 12th time in the last 13 years, an unprecedented feat in Missouri Valley Conference history that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nMost 20+ Win Seasons, Last 13 Years\n\nSeasons School\n\n13 Duke\n\n13 Florida\n\n13 Gonzaga\n\n13 Kansas\n\n13 Syracuse\n\n12 Creighton\n\n12 Kent State\n\n12 Kentucky\n\n12 Texas\n\n12 Utah State\n\n12 Xavier\n\nPostseason x 14\n\nCreighton has made the postseason in 14 consecutive seasons, the longest streak of postseason bids in MVC history.\n\nThe only nine schools to make the postseason in each of the last 14 years are Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State, Oklahoma State and Syracuse.\n\nPostseason History\n\nCreighton is a combined 20-30 in the postseason all-time. The Bluejays have gone 9-17 in 16 NCAA Tournaments, 5-10 in 10 National Invitation Tournaments, 1-2 in two National Catholic Invitational Tournament appearances and 2-1 all-time after their first CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament appearance.\n\nCreighton is 3-0 in its first appearance in the CBI.\n\nLast year marked the first time in school history that Creighton won consecutive postseason games, a mind-boggling fact for a program that has now made 30 all-time postseason appearances.\n\nThis season's three postseason wins are the most in school history for one year.\n\nAgainst Common Opponents\n\nCreighton and Oregon share just one common opponent this season.\n\nCreighton beat San Jose State, 85-74, in Omaha, on March 15 in the CBI opener. Oregon suffered its first loss of the season on Nov. 20 to the same San Jose State team in a game played in Eugene. The score of that game was 75-72.\n\nAgainst Postseason Opponents\n\nOregon is 10-13 against teams that made the postseason this season. That includes a 5-8 mark vs. NCAA Tournament qualifiers (two wins over USC and one win each over UC Santa Barbara, Washington and UCLA), a 2-3 mark vs. NIT teams (wins over Washington State and Texas Southern), a 3-1 mark vs. CBI qualifiers (wins over Weber State, Duquesne and Boise State) and a 0-1 mark vs. the CIT field.\n\nCreighton is 10-10 against teams that made the postseason this season. That includes a 2-3 mark vs. NCAA Tournament qualifiers (wins over Indiana State and Alabama State), an 0-6 mark vs. NIT teams, a 5-0 mark vs. CBI qualifiers (two wins over Evansville, one win vs. San Jose State, Davidson and UCF) and a 3-1 mark over CIT teams (two wins over Northern Iowa and one over Northern Arizona).\n\nMonday will be Creighton's ninth consecutive game against a team that reached the postseason. The Jays are 5-3 in the first eight games of that run.\n\nOregon/Creighton Connections\n\nOregon head coach Dana Altman coached at Creighton from 1994-2010, where he went 327-176 in 16 seasons. He took the Jays to 13 straight postseasons, including seven NCAA Tournaments, and won three MVC regular-season and six MVC Tournament titles.\n\nHis son, Oregon video coordinator Jordan Altman, is a Creighton graduate.\n\nOregon assistant coach Brian Fish spent two seasons at Creighton as a film coordinator (1994-96) and six more as an assistant coach (2004-10).\n\nOregon assistant coach Kevin McKenna was a 1998 inductee into the Creighton Hall of Fame as one of the top players in school history. He was an assistant at Creighton for nine seasons (1994-2001 and 2005-07). He earned his undergraduate degree from Creighton in 1993 and his Master's in 1997.\n\nCreighton assistant coach Darian DeVries worked with Dana Altman, Fish and McKenna, as did current Creighton Diversity & Inclusion Officer Len Gordy.\n\nOregon guard Jay-R Strowbridge has competed against Creighton once before and has played twice before at Qwest Center Omaha. On Nov. 24, 2007, he had two points and two assists in 21 minutes of a 74-62 Creighton win over Nebraska. Strowbridge also had 10 points and five assists for Nebraska against Oregon on Dec. 15, 2007 in a game played at Qwest Center Omaha.\n\nOregon's Bench at Qwest Center Omaha\n\nOregon head coach Dana Altman had a home record of 97-18 (.843) in seven seasons at Qwest Center Omaha, but he never coached on the visiting bench.\n\nOregon assistant coach Brian Fish was 0-1 on the visiting bench at Qwest Center Omaha. The San Diego team he was an assistant on lost the first regular-season game in venue history, 79-44.\n\nOregon assistant coach Kevin McKenna has never won on the visiting bench either. He was 0-3 as a head coach at Indiana State, and also went 0-1 in an exhibition game from the visiting bench as head coach at Nebraska-Omaha.\n\nBoth Joevan Catron and Jay-R Strowbridge also are 0-1 from the visiting bench at Qwest Center Omaha. Strowbridge lost to Creighton, while Catron lost to Nebraska.\n\nHistory Lesson\n\nWinning game one is key in any best-of-3 series, and the numbers in the brief history of the CBI back that up.\n\nIn the first three years of the CBI championship series, the team that hosted game one has won all three championships.\n\nIn addition, the team to win game one has won all three championships.\n\nIn 2008, Tulsa won game one and three at home to topple Bradley.\n\nIn 2009, Oregon State won the first game at home before UTEP tied the series in El Paso in game two. The Beavers then beat the Miners in the third and final game, which was contested at UTEP.\n\nIn 2010, VCU beat Saint Louis in game one in Richmond, then won the title with a game two victory in St. Louis.\n\nPacific-10 To Qwest Center Omaha\n\nOregon's visit to Qwest Center Omaha will mark just the third time a Pacific-10 Conference team has played in the venue. Each of the first two trips resulted in a loss for the Pac-10.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2007, Nebraska defeated Oregon, 88-79, in overtime. The only current Ducks player to play for Oregon that day was Joevan Catron, who had four points and nine rebounds before fouling out. Current Ducks guard Jay-R Strowbridge played for Nebraska that day. He had 10 points and five assists vs. his future teammates.\n\nOn March 20, 2008, Kansas State upended USC, 80-67, in the NCAA Tournament. That game was among the most highly-anticipated first-round match-ups, as it paired freshman sensations Michael Beasley and O.J. Mayo.\n\nCreighton has not played a home game against an active Pacific-10 school since Oregon State visited the Omaha Civic Auditorium on Nov. 25, 1978.\n\nAgainst Former Coaches?\n\nCreighton is 4-7 all-time when facing former head coaches. The Jays went 3-6 against Eddie Hickey (0-2 at Saint Louis, 3-4 at Marquette), and more recently were 1-1 against Eddie Sutton when he was at Oklahoma State. Below is that list:\n\nFormer Creighton Coaches vs. Creighton\n\nDate Former Coach New School CU Score\n\n12/20/98 Sutton Oklahoma State W 66-60\n\n11/22/97 Sutton Oklahoma State L 86-70\n\n01/23/64 Hickey Marquette W 84-57\n\n03/06/63 Hickey Marquette L 74-68\n\n02/05/62 Hickey Marquette W 79-72\n\n01/14/61 Hickey Marquette L 89-64\n\n03/04/60 Hickey Marquette W 69-66\n\n12/20/58 Hickey Marquette L 70-49\n\n12/09/58 Hickey Marquette L 53-49\n\n02/20/48 Hickey Saint Louis L 40-27\n\n01/31/48 Hickey Saint Louis L 38-25\n\nFormer Cyclones Taking Title Turns\n\nGreg McDermott is after something two former Iowa State co-workers have done this year, win a national postseason event.\n\nGene Chizik was head coach of Iowa State football for two years before accepting a head coaching job at Auburn. At Auburn, he went 8-5 in his first year before going 14-0 and winning a national title (against Oregon, no less) in year number two.\n\nCael Sanderson was head coach of Iowa State wrestling for three years before accepting a head coaching job at Penn State. At Penn State, he recently won a national title in his second season with the Nittany Lions.\n\nMcDermott served as Iowa State men's basketball coach for four seasons from 2006-10 before joining the Bluejay program 11 months ago.\n\nFor All The Marbles\n\nThis will be the fourth straight season that the Missouri Valley Conference will have a men's basketball team playing for a postseason national title, the longest active streak of any league.\n\nIn 2008, Bradley faced Tulsa in the CBI final, while the Braves faced Pacific in the 2009 CIT championship game. In 2010, Missouri State won the CIT over Pacific.\n\nThis season, Creighton is playing for the CBI title.\n\nPostseason Titles\n\nThe only recognized postseason title in Creighton Athletics history was won in 2004, when the women's basketball team won the WNIT.\n\nIn 1918-19, the Creighton men's basketball team capped its second straight undefeated season by winning a two-game series against the U.S. Army's Camp Grant. By winning the series, the March 20, 1919 Creighton Chronicle reported “the Creighton team is recognized as the champions of the west, not only among the college teams, but professionals.”\n\nDr. Floyd Paynter took the success one step further when he wrote in the March 1934 Creighton Alumnus, “After this great season we claimed the basketball championship of the nation for Creighton University.”\n\nPostseason Success\n\nCreighton's seven postseason wins in the past four years is the best in any four-year span in program history. The group from 2007-10 combined for four postseason wins to hold the previous mark.\n\nOn HDNet?\n\nCreighton has never lost when playing on HDNet, going 4-0 while averaging 90.8 points.\n\nThe Jays defeated IUPUI 99-52 on Nov. 25, 2002, then beat Notre Dame 80-75 the following night. Both of those games took place in Kansas City as part of the Guardians Classic, which was also run by the Gazelle Group.\n\nCreighton defeated Davidson 102-92 last Monday and beat UCF 82-64 last Wednesday to improve to 4-0 on the channel.\n\nHome Sweet CBI Home\n\nHaving the home-court advantage during the CBI continues to be a tremendous edge.\n\nIn the four-year history of the event, home teams are a combined 45-19, including a 26-6 mark after the first round and a 13-1 record this year.\n\nHome Court Records, CBI, By Round\n\nYear Rd. 1 Rd. 2 Rd. 3 Finals Total\n\n2008 5-3 4-0 1-1 3-0 13-4\n\n2009 4-4 3-1 1-1 2-1 10-7\n\n2010 3-5 3-1 2-0 1-1 9-7\n\n2011 7-1 4-0 2-0 - 13-1\n\nTotals 19-13 14-2 6-2 6-2 45-19\n\nHistorical CBI Crowds\n\nThe CBI averaged more than 5,000 fans per game in both 2008 and 2009 before falling to an average of 2,570 per gate last season, with just one total crowd of more than 5,000.\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011\n\nLargest 1st round crowd 5,365 6.647 3,542 4,375\n\nSmallest 1st round crowd 1,169 1.045 665 989\n\nAverage 1st round crowd 3,813 2.833 1,712 2,414\n\nLargest quarterfinal crowd 6,460 8.812 4,235 5,913\n\nSmallest quarterfinal crowd 3,082 2.541 640 3,949\n\nAverage quarterfinal crowd 5,433 5,801 2,347 5,016\n\nLargest semifinal crowd 5,852 4.759 4,682 6,392\n\nSmallest semifinal crowd 5,339 2.363 3,352 6,157\n\nAverage semifinal crowd 5,596 3,561 4,017 6,275\n\nLargest finals crowd 9,014 12,000 5,612\n\nSmallest finals crowd 7,337 8,029 4,386\n\nAverage finals crowd 8,269 10,676 4,999\n\nAverage crowd (all rounds) 5,190 5,001 2,570 3,709\n\nMVC Teams In The CBI\n\nThough this is just the fourth year of the College Basketball Invitational, Creighton isn't the first Missouri Valley Conference team in the field. The MVC owns an all-time record of 10-5 in the event.\n\nIn 2008 the MVC went 4-2 in the the CBI, as Bradley won its first three games before alternating losses and wins in a best-of-3 championship series loss to Tulsa.\n\nIn 2009, the MVC went 1-1 in the CBI. Wichita State defeated Buffalo before falling to Stanford.\n\nLast year the MVC went 0-1 in the CIT, as Indiana State fell at Saint Louis, 63-54.\n\nIn addition to Creighton's 3-0 start in the CBI this year, Evansville went 1-1 and was eliminated by Boise State last Monday.\n\nLike A Gazelle\n\nCreighton's 3-0 performance in the 2011 CBI, presented by Zebra Pen, has extended the program's streak to 11 straight wins in events promoted by the New Jersey-based Gazelle Group.\n\nCreighton went 4-0 in both 2002 and 2004 in the Guardians Classic (promoted by the Gazelle Group), and is now 3-0 in the 2011 CBI.\n\nOf course, Oregon head coach Dana Altman is also 11-0 in Gazelle Group events too.\n\nPostseason Features Last-Second Endings\n\nEight of Creighton's previous nine postseason runs have included a game that was decided in the final seconds.\n\nIn fact, Creighton's postseason openers in the past 10 years have had three games decided by one point (including a double-OT finish), two by two points, two by six points (including an OT finish) and three games by 11 points.\n\nIn 2009, Creighton rallied from a 14-point deficit and would hang on to beat Bowling Green, 73-71 in the first round of the NIT. The Jays needed a last-second defensive stand, as BGSU's Darryl Clements' game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark.\n\nThe following game, Creighton led Kentucky by one with 36 seconds left, only to miss two free throws and see UK All-American Jodie Meeks convert a three-point play. CU's Booker Woodfox, the nation's No. 2 three-point shooter, missed an open trey as time expired, and Creighton lost 65-63.\n\nIn 2008, Creighton rallied from a 12-point deficit in the final 3:07 to top Rhode Island, 73-72, in the first round of the NIT. Cavel Witter hit the game-winner with 3.2 seconds left to give CU its first lead of the game since 3-0.\n\nIn 2007, Creighton had the ball for a final shot in a tie game against Nevada in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Nate Funk's shot attempt missed, and a tip-in try was also not converted. The Jays would eventually lose 77-71 in overtime.\n\nIn second round of the 2006 NIT, Miami (Fla.) guard Guilermo Diaz drained a free throw with 2.6 seconds left to beat Creighton 53-52. A last-second shot attempt by Bluejay senior Johnny Mathies was knocked out of his hands.\n\nIn the 2005 NCAA Tourney, Nate Funk had his three-point try with seven seconds left blocked by Tyrone Sally, and Sally raced downcourt for a breakaway dunk with 2.4 seconds left to give West Virginia a 63-61 win. Funk's three-point try from the corner missed at the buzzer.\n\nIn 2004, Creighton fell 71-70 to Nebraska in the NIT. The Jays led nearly the entire second half before NU's go-ahead basket with 12 seconds left. Nate Funk's game-winning jumper from 18-feet away was blocked by Husker guard Jake Muhleisen.\n\nIn 2003 Creighton lost 79-73 to Central Michigan in the NCAA's. The Jays trailed 50-24 with 16:24 left but a furious rally got them within two points (72-70) with 1:20 left, only to turn it over the next three possessions.\n\nIn the 2002 NCAA's, Creighton beat #15 Florida, 83-82, in Chicago. Terrell Taylor hit a game-winning trey with 0.2 seconds left in double-overtime, his final three of 28 points after a scoreless first half.\n\nDoes The CBI Help?\n\nHas playing in the CBI served as a springboard for future success?\n\nOne needs to look no further than this season's Sweet 16 darling, VCU, for proof. Last year VCU won the CBI, and this year the Rams have already won three NCAA Tournament games, defeating USC, Georgetown and Purdue.\n\nOf last year's CBI “Final Four”, VCU, Princeton and Boston all reached this year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nSix teams playing in this year's NCAA Tournament participated in last year's CBI.\n\n2010 CBI 2011 2011\n\nTeam W-L W-L Postseason?\n\nVCU 5-0 26-11 NCAA*\n\nSaint Louis 3-2 12-19 --\n\nPrinceton 2-1 25-7 NCAA\n\nBoston 2-1 21-14 NCAA\n\nMorehead State 1-1 25-10 NCAA\n\nGreen Bay 1-1 14-18 --\n\nCharleston 1-1 26-11 NIT\n\nIUPUI 1-1 19-14 --\n\nOregon State 0-1 11-20 --\n\nHofstra 0-1 21-12 CBI\n\nEastern Kentucky 0-1 15-16 --\n\nAkron 0-1 23-13 NCAA\n\nColorado State 0-1 19-13 NIT\n\nDuquesne 0-1 19-13 CBI\n\nIndiana State 0-1 20-14 NCAA\n\nGeorge Washington 0-1 17-14 --\n\n*still playing as of March 24\n\n2009 CBI 2010 2010\n\nTeam W-L W-L Postseason?\n\nOregon State 5-1 14-18 CBI\n\nUTEP 4-2 26-7 NCAA\n\nRichmond 2-1 26-9 NCAA\n\nStanford 2-1 14-18 --\n\nNortheastern 1-1 20-13 NIT\n\nVermont 1-1 25-10 NCAA\n\nWichita State 1-1 25-10 NIT\n\nCharleston 1-1 22-12 CBI\n\nBoise State 0-1 15-17 --\n\nHouston 0-1 19-16 NCAA\n\nTroy 0-1 20-13 NIT\n\nBuffalo 0-1 18-12 --\n\nGreen Bay 0-1 22-13 CBI\n\nSt. John's 0-1 17-16 NIT\n\nNevada 0-1 21-13 NIT\n\nWyoming 0-1 10-21 --\n\n2008 CBI 2009 2009\n\nTeam W-L W-L Postseason?\n\nTulsa 5-1 25-11 NIT\n\nBradley 4-2 21-15 CIT\n\nHouston 2-1 21-12 CBI\n\nVirginia 2-1 10-18 --\n\nUtah 1-1 24-10 NCAA\n\nValparaiso 1-1 15-17 --\n\nOhio 1-1 15-17 --\n\nOld Dominion 1-1 25-10 CIT\n\nRichmond 0-1 20-16 CBI\n\nRider 0-1 19-13 CIT\n\nBrown 0-1 9-19 --\n\nNevada 0-1 21-13 CBI\n\nCincinnati 0-1 18-14 --\n\nMiami (Ohio) 0-1 17-13 --\n\nWashington 0-1 26-9 NCAA\n\nUTEP 0-1 23-14 CBI\n\nMcDermott In The Postseason\n\nCreighton coach Greg McDermott is making his first postseason appearance at Creighton, and fourth overall as a Division I head coach if you include his time at Northern Iowa.\n\nMcDermott's Division I teams own a 3-3 record in four postseason appearances, including a 3-0 mark at Creighton.\n\nMcDermott's Division I Postseason Appearances\n\nYear Tourney Postseason W-L\n\n2003-04 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2004-05 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2005-06 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2010-11 (CU) CBI 3-0\n\nCombo Number Five\n\nThe College Basketball Invitational presented by Zebra Pen is the fourth different postseason event that Creighton has participated in during the last five years.\n\nIn 2007, Creighton played in the NCAA Tournament. Creighton was in the 2008 and 2009 NIT. Last year the team was in the CIT, and this year it's the CBI.\n\nOn a national basis, the only schools to be in all four tournaments in the past five years are Creighton and Austin Peay. However, Austin Peay has no fifth-year seniors that have been on the roster for each event, while Creighton has fifth-year seniors Kenny Lawson Jr. and Casey Harriman who can claim that.\n\nMcDermott Wins 300th\n\nCreighton head coach Greg McDermott picked up his 300th career win with the March 15 victory over San Jose State. It also marked the eighth time in 17 seasons as a head coach that he's won 20 games in a year.\n\nMcDermott owns a career mark of 302-209, including 22-14 this year in his first season at Creighton.\n\nBig Mac's Attack\n\nGreg McDermott has led Creighton to a 22-14 mark so far this year, the most wins by any first-year coach in school history. Tom Apke had the previous mark when he went 20-7 in 1974-75.\n\nMcDermott's 22 wins are more than the combined number of first-year wins by his two predecessors, Dana Altman (7 in 1994-95) and Rick Johnson (9 in 1991-92).\n\nNew Coaches Update\n\nGreg McDermott is one of 53 head coaches at a new school this winter. His 22 wins are tied for fourth-most of that group.\n\nAmong his peers, the only other Valley coaches to more than 20 games in their first year was Illinois State's Tim Jankovich (25 in 2007-08) and Indiana State's Greg Lansing (20 this season).\n\nBelow is a list of the new coaches with 20 or more wins so far this season, through March 25.\n\nSchool Coach W-L Next Game\n\nUTEP Tim Floyd 25-10 --\n\nIona Tim Cluess 24-11 3/26\n\nColorado Tad Boyle 24-13 3/29\n\nCreighton Greg McDermott 22-14 3/28\n\nMarshall Tom Herrion 22-12 --\n\nClemson Brad Brownell 22-12 --\n\nBoise State Leon Rice 22-13 -\n\nUCF Donnie Jones 21-12 --\n\nNorthern Colorado B.J.

Creighton has three wins (so far) in the CBI, while Wichita State has three wins (so far) in the NIT.\n\nAll-Around Doug\n\nDoug McDermott enters Monday's game with 541 points, 272 rebounds and 42 three-point baskets during his remarkable freshman season.\n\nAccording to research by Creighton Sports Information Director Rob Anderson and STATS Inc., the last two men to attain 525 points, 270 rebounds and 40 three-pointers in a season were über-freshmen Kevin Durant (Texas) in 2006-07 and Carmelo Anthony (Syracuse) in 2002-03.\n\nThe previous two men before them to do so, Quentin Richardson (1998-99 at DePaul) and Eddie Griffin (2000-01 at Seton Hall), like Durant and Anthony, were also named the National Freshman of the Year.\n\nDurant had 903 points, 390 rebounds and 82 three-point baskets, Anthony had 778 points, 349 rebounds and 56 three-pointers, Griffin had 533 points, 323 rebounds and 41 three-pointers and Richardson had 586 points, 327 rebounds and 44 trifectas.\n\nBelow is the list, compiled by STATS Inc., of all 29 Division I players since 1996-97 to have McDermott's current levels of 541 points, 272 rebounds and 42-three pointers:\n\n541+ Pts., 272+ Reb., 42+ 3FG Since 1996-97\n\nSource: STATS Inc. & Creighton Sports Info\n\nName, School Year 3FG Reb.

Those 11 wins have been by an average of 11.5 points, with six coming by double-digits, and none decided by fewer than six points.\n\nHowever, in that same span, the Jays have lost all three postseason home games against members from those same leagues. Each loss was decided on a play in the final 10 seconds.\n\nCreighton hosts Oregon at Qwest Center Omaha on Monday.\n\nBCS Schools at Creighton, Last 13 Years\n\nRegular-Season Games Only\n\nDate Score\n\n12/06/09 Creighton 67, Nebraska 61\n\n11/24/07 Creighton 74, Nebraska 62\n\n11/09/07 Creighton 74, DePaul 62\n\n12/11/05 Creighton 70, Nebraska 44\n\n12/10/03 Creighton 61, Nebraska 54\n\n12/12/01 Creighton 76, Nebraska 70\n\n12/09/99 Creighton 89, Nebraska 72\n\n11/27/99 Creighton 85, #23 Iowa 76\n\n12/20/98 Creighton 66, #18 Oklahoma State 60\n\n12/02/98 Creighton 73, Baylor 59\n\n12/10/97 Creighton 84, Nebraska 73\n\nBCS Schools at Creighton, Last 13 Years\n\nPostseason Games Only\n\nDate Score\n\n03/23/09 Kentucky 65, Creighton 63\n\n03/20/06 Miami (Fla.) 53, Creighton 52\n\n03/16/04 Nebraska 71, Creighton 70\n\nWin It For 'Merf'\n\nCreighton will be without assistant coach Steve Merfeld on the bench for this week's CBI championship series. Merfeld undergoes long-scheduled hip surgery on Monday.\n\nIn 2008, Merfeld was an assistant coach on Bradley's team that reached the CBI finals.\n\nThis is the 10-year anniversary of his most famous moment in coaching. He led the 15th-seeded Hampton Pirates to an upset victory over second-seeded Iowa State in the 2001 NCAA Tournament.\n\nBench Carries Some Rare 0-Fer's\n\nDespite Creighton averaging a staggering 89.7 points in three CBI games to date, it has done it despite some 0-fer's in the starting backcourt.\n\nIn the San Jose State game, Antoine Young was held scoreless.\n\nAgainst Davidson, Kaleb Korver was scoreless, while Jahenns Manigat was 0-for-3 from the floor.\n\nMost recently against UCF, Korver was scoreless and Manigat 0-for-3 from the field.\n\nHelping to step up for Creighton has been strong play by its bench. The Bluejay bench has scored 87 points during the three CBI games, including an average of 12.3 points per game by Josh Jones, 8.7 ppg. by Kenny Lawson Jr. and 6.3 per contest from Wayne Runnels.\n\nOffensive Floodgates Open\n\nCreighton has scored 80 or more points in all three CBI games to date. It's their first streak of three-straight games of 80 or more points since opening the 2008-09 season with three such contests.\n\nCreighton has also shot 50 percent or better in each of its last six home games.\n\nLast but not least, Creighton has won each of its last three games by double-digits for the first time since Jan. 27-Feb. 4, 2009.\n\nDown To A Dozen\n\nBy the time Creighton takes the floor on Monday night, only 12 schools will still be playing nationwide.\n\nThere will be four teams headed to Houston for the the NCAA Tournament Final Four, four teams headed to New York City for the NIT semifinals, two teams in Omaha for the CBI championship series and two teams meeting in the CBI final on March 30th.\n\nTwo of those 12 remaining schools will be from the Missouri Valley Conference, is Wichita State is still alive in the NIT.\n\nMake Room For Gregory\n\nCreighton big man Gregory Echenique missed the first nine games of the season, as he was required to miss the first semester due to his mid-year transfer from Rutgers one season earlier.\n\nEchenique, however, has played in Creighton's last 27 games, which is enough for him to finally reach the league's minimum 75 percent participation requirement to show up among the league's statistical leaders.\n\nEchenique's impact is made immediately evident. He's first in the league in field goal percentage (.595) and blocked shots per game (1.8), fourth in offensive rebounds per game (2.22) and ranks 10th with 5.6 rebounds per game.\n\nDoug vs. Greg\n\nDoug McDermott's 31 points and 10 rebounds vs. Davidson on March 21 moved him past his father, Bluejay head coach Greg McDermott, for family bragging rights in several areas.\n\nDoug's career-high 31 points was two more than Greg's career-best of 29 points (vs. Western Illinois on March 1, 1986) when he played at UNI.\n\nIt was also Doug's ninth career double-double, one more than the eight his father attained in four years at UNI.\n\nEarlier this year Doug had 17 rebounds at Bradley. Greg's career-high was 15 on Dec. 8, 1984 at Kansas State.\n\nQwest For 10,000\n\nCreighton has scored 10,005 points all-time at Qwest Center Omaha, surpassing 10,000 points in the building last Wednesday after a basket by Kenny Lawson Jr. vs. UCF.\n\nCreighton has currently outscored the opposition 10,005-8,516 in 136 career games in the eight-year old facility.\n\nCreighton is now 9-1 all-time in games where it moves over any 1,000 point milestone, as seen below:\n\nDate Pts-Opp (QCO Game #) Who/How vs. Opp.\n\n02/18/04 1,000-787 (14) Lindeman FG vs. Indiana State\n\n02/05/05 2,000-1,696 (28) Funk FG vs. Missouri St.\n\n01/18/06 3,000-2,504 (41) Watts FT vs. Bradley\n\n01/09/07 4,000-3,359 (56) Tolliver FG vs. Drake\n\n12/17/07 5,000-4,174 (69) Korver 3FG vs. Hou.

Illinois\n\n03/23/11 10,000-8,500 (136) Lawson FG vs. UCF\n\nLittle Mac, Big Production\n\nDoug McDermott had a season-high 31 points in a March 21 win vs. Davidson, the most by a Bluejay freshman since Rodney Buford lit up Illinois State for 36 points on Feb. 5, 1996.\n\nThe 31 points were also the most by a Bluejay in any postseason game in school history, the most by a Bluejay in any game since Cavel Witter had 42 in a double-overtime game on March 1, 2008 vs. Bradley, and the most by a Bluejay in regulation since Nate Funk had 33 vs. Missouri State on March 3, 2007.\n\nMcDermott From Downtown\n\nDoug McDermott was just 15-for-53 (28.3 percent) from three-point range in the first 20 games of his Bluejay career, but he's been a marksman in the 16 games since January 19th.\n\nIn that span, McDermott is 27-for-53 from downtown (50.9 percent). He's hit at least one trey in 15 of those 16 games, and is 15-for-28 (53.6 percent) from deep in his last eight games.\n\nMcDermott ranks second on the team with 42 three-point baskets and 39.6 percent accuracy from long-range.\n\nForever Young\n\nAntoine Young had 22 points and nine assists in Creighton's win over Davidson last Monday while finishing his second straight game without a turnover.\n\nCreighton had not had a player with 20 or more points and nine or more assists in the same game since Duan Cole had 21 points and nine assists vs. Notre Dame on Feb. 18, 1991.\n\nTo find a game with 20 or more points and 10 or more assists, you'd have to go all the way to Vernon Moore's 21 point, 12 assist performance vs. Southern Illinois on Jan. 17, 1985.\n\nYoung, with 16 points and 10 assists vs. UCF on Wednesday, had Creighton's first point-assist double-double since Tyler McKinney in 2002.\n\nFor the CBI, Young has a perfect 27 assist/0 turnover ratio. The impressive three-game stretch has seen him improve his assist-to-turnover ratio from 2.22/1 (50th nationally) to 2.62/1 (20th nationally).\n\nPostseason Win Streak\n\nThanks to a win over San Jose State on March 15, the Creighton men's basketball team has now won a postseason game in a school-record four straight seasons. The previous mark was three in a row from 1962-64.\n\nEntering this year, Creighton was one of 18 teams with to win a postseason game each of the previous three postseasons. That list was as follows: Creighton, Dayton, Duke, Kansas, Kansas State, Maryland, Memphis, Michigan State, North Carolina, Old Dominion, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Syracuse, Texas A&M, Villanova, Virginia Tech, Wisconsin and Xavier.\n\nThe following 10 teams are the only ones that extended it to four straight seasons, including this year: Creighton, Duke, Kansas, Kansas State, North Carolina, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, and Wisconsin.\n\nTaking it a step further, there were only seven schools that won both men's and women's basketball postseason games in each of the previous three years (not including 2010-11). That ultra-elite list consisted of Creighton, Duke, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan State, Purdue and Texas A&M.\n\nNot Ready To Hang It Up\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. has played with an increased urgency as his senior year winds down. The center from Oceanside, Calif., has averaged 11.2 points and 5.6 rebounds in just 16.8 minutes per game in March.\n\nLawson is shooting 57.1 percent from the field, including 53.3 percent from three-point range and 88.9 percent at the line.\n\nLast Monday, his three-point play in the final 15 seconds helped Creighton crack the century mark and moved him past baseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson for 18th on Creighton's all-time scoring list.\n\n20-20-20 Vision\n\nDuring last Monday's 102-92 win over Davidson, Creighton had three men score more than 20 points in the same game for the first time since Jan. 21, 1998.\n\nOn that night, Doug Swenson (23), Ben Walker (20) and Rodney Buford (20) turned the trick vs. Missouri State.\n\nMonday, it was Doug McDermott (31), Antoine Young (22) and Josh Jones (21) that went for 20 or more points.\n\nPoints By The Bunch\n\nCreighton put up 102 points vs. Davidson last Monday, its most points since a 111-110 double-OT victory over Bradley on March 1, 2008.\n\nThe Jays hadn't gone over 100 points in regulation since a 110-73 win over Houston Baptist on Dec. 17, 2007.\n\nCreighton is now 43-2 all-time when scoring 100 or more points, and has won 16 straight games when scoring 100 or more since Feb. 26, 1977 vs. North Texas State.\n\nCreighton's 102 points were a CBI record, as were the 194 combined points between Creighton and Davidson.\n\nCreighton's 102 points were first time a Greg McDermott squad reached the century mark in a Division I game. His Wayne State team did so 15 times, most recently four times during the 1999-2000 season.\n\nAnd Allowing Nearly As Many\n\nCreighton's 92 points allowed to Davidson on March 21 were the most by a Bluejay opponent since Bradley had 110 in double-overtime on March 1, 2008, and most in regulation by a CU foe since Western Kentucky hung 95 on the Jays on Dec. 19, 2001.\n\nCreighton head coach Greg McDermott had never won a Division I game when allowing more than 90 points, entering last Monday with an 0-3 mark.\n\nNewcomers Lead The Way\n\nThree players making their postseason debuts, sophomore Gregory Echenique and freshmen Doug McDermott and Jahenns Manigat, led the way in Creighton's CBI-opening victory over San Jose State on March 15.\n\nEchenique had 18 points, his most in 25 games as a Bluejay, while also hauling down five rebounds and blocking two shots.\n\nMcDermott had team-high totals of 26 points and nine rebounds and tied a personal best with four three-point baskets. His 26 points were the most by a Bluejay in the postseason since Terrell Taylor's 28 vs. Florida in the 2002 NCAA Tournament, and the most ever by a Creighton freshman in a postseason contest.\n\nManigat had a season-high 17 points, and career-best five three-point baskets.\n\nEchenique and McDermott had Creighton's first 20 points after halftime as the team rallied from a 43-40 halftime deficit to take the lead for good.\n\nOn Tuesday vs. Davidson, Creighton's freshman class scored 34 points while its sophomores combined for 31 points.\n\nGame Tested, Parts I, II & III\n\nMonday will mark the 37th game of the season for Creighton, setting a school record. Creighton played 35 games in 2008-09 for the previous mark.\n\nMonday will also be Creighton's 22nd and final home game of the season, easily the most in program history. The 2008-09 team previously had 19 home games to hold the standard. Creighton currently has 18 home wins, another record. The 2002-03 team went 17-0 in the final full season at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nGame Tested, Part IV\n\nFifth-year senior Kenny Lawson Jr. has played in 140 games as a Bluejay, more than any other player in school history.\n\nBelow is a list of the all-time Creighton leaders in games played:\n\nGP Name Years\n\n140 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2006-Pres.\n\n135 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n132 Kaleb Korver 2007-Pres.\n\n130 Dane Watts 2004-08\n\nRewriting Qwest Center Omaha Records\n\nCreighton's 36 free throws made last Monday were a CBI and Qwest Center Omaha record.\n\nCU's 43 free throw attempts were a CBI record, and one shy of the Qwest Center Omaha mark.\n\nJosh Jones' 4-for-4 showing from three-point range tied the Qwest Center Omaha mark for a Creighton player for most attempts from long-range without a miss.\n\nCreighton is averaging 89.7 points in three CBI games this year. The CBI record for scoring average by one team is 87.3 by Boston University in 2010. Creighton is also on pace to set CBI team records for scoring margin (+13.0) and field goal percentage (.532).\n\nClose Games This Year\n\nCreighton has not had a game decided by more than 19 points this season, the first time it can say that since 1939-40.\n\nThe last time Creighton had a season without a 20-point win was 1994-95. The last time the Jays had a season without a loss by 14 or more points was 2004-05.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Jays led 82-52 with three minutes to play until UCF closed the game with a 12-0 run to trim CU's final margin to 18.\n\nSix Out Of 13 Tourney Titles\n\nDespite its current four-year drought, Creighton still owns six league tournament titles in the last 13 years. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Duke (10), Gonzaga (10), Winthrop (9), Creighton (6), Kansas (6), Kentucky (6) and Utah State (6).\n\nCreighton's 10 Valley Tournament titles all-time are twice as many as the next closest school, Southern Illinois (5).\n\nAward Winning\n\nCreighton had quite the haul of conference awards this season.\n\nDoug McDermott was named MVC Freshman of the Year, MVC Newcomer of the Year, first-team all-MVC and also had spots on the all-Newcomer and all-Freshman teams. He was the first freshman to be named first-team all-Valley since Wichita State's Cleo Littleton in 1951-52.\n\nIn addition, Antoine Young was named second-team all-MVC and to the Most Improved Team, Jahenns Manigat was named all-Freshman and all-Bench, and Gregory Echenique was named to the All-Newcomer and All-Defensive squads.\n\nAll About The Bench\n\nIn Creighton's 22 wins, the bench has scored 497 points (22.6 ppg.), but in the 14 losses it's scored just 162 points total (11.6 ppg.), with a high of 18.\n\nCreighton is 19-1 this season when its bench scores 18 points or more, but just 3-13 when it scores 17 or fewer.\n\nCreighton's bench had a season-high 36 points vs. Davidson last Monday.\n\n10 Conference Wins x 15\n\nCreighton went 10-8 in MVC play this year to extend its streak of 10 or more conference wins to 15 straight years.\n\nOn a national basis, the only other current school with at least 15 straight years of 10 or more league wins is Kansas, which extended its streak to 17 earlier this season.\n\nConsistent Challengers\n\nCreighton has finished in fourth place or better in each of the last 14 years, with nine of those teams finishing first or second in The Valley's regular-season race. Two of the five that didn't won the MVC Tournament.\n\nThe Bluejays won the MVC in 2000-01 and tied for the title in 2001-02 and 2008-09. CU was second in the MVC in 1997-98 and 2006-07, tied for second in the MVC in 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2005-06, and finished tied for third in 2004-05. The 1999-00 club was fourth in the MVC, but won the MVC Tournament.\n\nCreighton's MVC Finishes, Last 14 Years\n\n1st Place 2000-01\n\nTied for First 2001-02 (won MVC Tourn.), 2008-09\n\n2nd Place 1997-98, 2002-03 (won MVC Tourn.), 2006-07 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\nTied for 2nd 1998-99 (won MVC Tourn.), 2003-04, 2005-06\n\nTied for 3rd Place 2004-05 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\n4th Place 1999-00 (won MVC Tourn.); 2007-08; 2009-10\n\nTied for 4th Place 2010-11\n\n“State” Games Give Jays Issues On Road\n\nCreighton has played seven games away from home against teams with the word “State” in their name. They beat Illinois State by 11 points, but lost the other six games by a combined 18 points.\n\nCreighton lost to Iowa State by three at the buzzer (though photos later showed the game-winning shot was late), by two on a tip-in at the buzzer at Indiana State, by one at Missouri State on a lay-up with 14.2 seconds left, and by two at Wichita State on a lay-up with 1.5 seconds left.\n\nCreighton is 1-5 in games decided by three points or less this season.\n\nI Am Iron Man\n\nAntoine Young logged all 40 minutes in Creighton's Nov. 28 game at Northwestern, and again on Jan. 26 at Northern Iowa and Feb. 1 at Bradley. He was the first Creighton player to play from tip to buzzer, without a rest, since Ryan Sears on March 15, 2001 vs. Iowa. Since then, Creighton had played 329 games.\n\nYoung is second in the MVC with 35.8 minutes per game this season. Young's minutes per game average is the most by a Bluejay since Matt Petty averaged 39.1 minutes per game in 1992-93.\n\nYoung has played an MVC-high 1,288 minutes this season. According to available records, that's the most by any player in Creighton history, as seen below:\n\nMost Minutes, Season\n\nMinutes Name Year\n\n1,288 Antoine Young 2010-11\n\n1,193 Benoit Benjamin 1984-85\n\n1,182 Rod Mason 1987-88\n\n1,169 Vernon Moore 1983-84\n\n1,164 Vernon Moore 1984-85\n\nYoung's Passing Fancy\n\nAntoine Young ranks seventh in the MVC in scoring with 13.3 points per game. His team, however, sometimes succeeds when he takes on a secondary scoring role. Creighton is 16-2 this season when Young takes 11 field goal attempts or less.\n\nYoung, who also leads the MVC with 4.9 assists per game, is seeking to become the first Valley player to lead the MVC in assists per game and finish in the top-10 in scoring since MVC Player of the Year Curt Smith from Drake in 1992-93.\n\nYoung owns 479 points and 178 assists so far this year. It had been 25 years since Creighton has had a player with 400 or more points and 150 or more assists, as Vernon Moore in 1984-85 (671 points/159 assists) was the last to do so.\n\nYoung has become the first Creighton player with 475 points and 175 assists in a season.\n\nYoung's 178 assists this season are fourth-most in Creighton single-season history.\n\nSenior Class\n\nCreighton has five seniors, a group consisting of Darryl Ashford, Casey Harriman, Kaleb Korver, Kenny Lawson Jr. and Wayne Runnels. Over the past four years, Creighton is 89-49 with three 20-win seasons, seven postseason wins and four postseason appearances (two NIT's, one CIT, one CBI).\n\nThe five seniors are the most by Creighton in one year since 2001, when it had six men honored on Senior Day.\n\nAshford is in his second season at Creighton after transferring in from Jacksonville Junior College. He's played in 69 games, including 34 starts, and has 408 points, 216 rebounds and 43 blocked shots.\n\nHarriman is in his fifth season at Creighton, including his redshirt season in 2006-07. Harriman had 336 points, 242 rebounds and 44 charges taken before undergoing season-ending labrum surgery on January 5th.\n\nKorver is in his fourth season at Creighton. The younger brother of MVC Hall of Famer Kyle Korver, Kaleb owns 404 points, 270 rebounds and 159 assists. He is a career 39.0 percent shooter from three-point range, making 112 of those attempts. He was recognized on the MVC Scholar-Athlete Team as a sophomore, junior and senior.\n\nLawson is in his fifth season at Creighton, including a medical redshirt season in 2006-07. Lawson's name is littered throughout the school record books, ranking third with 152 blocked shots, seventh with 747 rebounds and 18th with 1,284 career points. He was a second-team all-MVC pick a year ago.\n\nRunnels is in his second year at Creighton after transferring in from Northern Oklahoma-Enid. Runnels owns 256 points, 206 rebounds and 45 assists at Creighton.\n\nDouble-Double Doug\n\nDoug McDermott had 31 points and 10 rebounds vs. Davidson on March 21, his Valley-best ninth double-double of the season. McDermott's nine double-doubles are the most in one season by a Creighton player since Nate King had nine double-doubles in 1993-94.\n\nMcDermott's 272 rebounds are also the most by a Bluejay since Chad Gallagher's total of 280 in 1990-91.\n\nCurrently second in the MVC with 7.6 rebounds per game, McDermott is seeking to join Valley Hall of Famer Bob Harstad (in 1988-89) as the only Creighton players to pace the MVC in rebounding over the course of an entire season.\n\nFather/Son Duo\n\nDoug McDermott is the only player in Creighton men's basketball history to play for his father, head coach Greg McDermott. The previous closest relationship between a player/coach had been when Rick Apke (1974-78) played for his older brother, head coach Tom Apke (1974-81).\n\nThe McDermott's are one of six father-son duos in college basketball this season. Other pairs include Bob and Brendan McKillop (Davidson), Ray McCallum Sr. and Ray McCallum Jr. (Detroit), Ernie Zeigler and Trey Zeigler (Central Michigan), Dave Boots and Jordan Boots (South Dakota), and Bruce Pearl and Steven Pearl (Tennessee).\n\nSites The Difference\n\nCreighton is 10-8 in its last 18 games. That includes a perfect 9-0 mark at home, 1-1 at neutral sites, and an 0-7 road record in that same span. The 10 wins have been by a combined 118 points, while the eight losses have been by a combined 40 points.\n\nAn Impressive Start\n\nFreshman forward Doug McDermott led all players with 18 points in his Nov. 4 exhibition debut, making 6-of-9 shots from the field and grabbing a team-high seven rebounds. His 18 points were the most by a Bluejay in their exhibition debut since Rodney Buford scored 24 points on Nov. 14, 1995 vs. Poznan (Poland).\n\nMcDermott was equally impressive on Nov. 12 vs. Alabama State, finishing with 16 points and seven rebounds on 7-of-13 shooting. McDermott's 16 points and seven rebounds made him the first Bluejay freshman since at least 1973 to have 15 or more points and five or more rebounds in the season-opener.\n\nMcDermott's 541 points this season are second-most in Creighton history by a newcomer. Only Paul Silas, with 551 in 1961-62 had more. That was Silas' sophomore season since freshmen were ineligible for varsity competition then.\n\nMcDermott Chases History\n\nCleo Littleton of Wichita State holds the league's freshman scoring record, notching 555 points in his first year with WSU in 1951-52. Littleton remains the only player in MVC history to earn first-team all-league honors in four-straight years.\n\nAccording to research by associate MVC commissioner Mike Kern, Doug McDermott joined former Wichita State standouts Cleo Littleton and Cliff Levingston as the only freshmen in MVC history to have more than 400 points and 200 rebounds.\n\nWith 541 points this season, McDermott has already destroyed Creighton's freshman scoring record, passing Rodney Buford's 421 points in 1995-96.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that every MVC player to score more than 435 points as a freshman would go on to earn multiple first-team all-MVC accolades in their career.\n\nMVC -- Top Scoring Freshmen, 400+ Points\n\nName, School (Year) Pts.

Here's a look at how he compares in his career to some of his predecessors:\n\nName Young Dotzler McKinney Sears\n\nGames 104 117 110 124\n\nStarts 69 96 97 124\n\nPoints 887 422 570 1311\n\nPPG 8.5 3.6 5.2 10.6\n\nAssists 332 388 430 570\n\nAPG 3.2 3.3 3.9 4.6\n\nTurnovers 150 200 188 252\n\nA/TO Ratio 2.21 1.94 2.29 2.03\n\nSteals 71 196 119 283\n\nSPG 0.68 1.68 1.08 2.29\n\nMin./Game 25.4 23.0 26.5 33.7\n\nMVC Tourn. Titles 0 1 3 2\n\nPostseason Wins 6 3 1 1\n\nSweet 16\n\nDoug McDermott had 16 rebounds against Akron, the second time this season he's had 16 or more in a game (he also had 17 at Bradley).\n\nThat makes McDermott the first Bluejay since Bob Harstad in 1990-91 to have multiple games of 16 or more rebounds in the same season.\n\nMaking the feat all the more impressive is that prior to this year Creighton had not had a player grab 16+ rebounds in any game since 1995.\n\nStraight Shooter\n\nJosh Jones had a (then) career-best 15 points on Feb. 16 vs. Illinois State thanks to 6-for-6 shooting from the field. That was the most hoops by a Bluejay without a miss since Kenny Lawson Jr. went 7-for-7 on March 1, 2008 in a 111-110 double-overtime victory over Bradley.\n\nJones had owned 13 previous career games with six or more shot attempts, but had at least two misses in each of those contests.\n\nThe Wing's The Thing\n\nCreighton has won seven of its last 10 games, and the play of wings Jahenns Manigat and Josh Jones has been a key reason why.\n\nIn the last 10 games, Manigat and Jones have averaged a combined 16.6 points per game on 56-of-98 shooting from the field (57.1 percent), 31-of-59 shooting from downtown (52.5 percent) and 23-of-31 at the line (74.2 percent) to go with a 38/21 assist/turnover ratio.\n\nCreighton is 10-2 when either Jones or Manigat score in double-digits.\n\nCreighton is also 10-2 when Manigat and Jones combine for 13 points or more and 9-0 when Manigat, Jones and fellow wing Darryl Ashford combine for 20 or more points.\n\nManigat had a career-high 17 points in the first round of the CBI, while Jones had a career-best 21 points in the CBI quarterfinals.\n\nFree And Easy\n\nFor the season, Creighton is 11-0 when making more than 15 free throws, and has won 14 straight dating to last year when doing so.\n\nForeign Aid\n\nCreighton has had just seven foreign players in its history, but two of them played a big role in Creighton's 69-50 win over Southern Illinois on Feb. 13.\n\nJahenns Manigat (Canada) had a career-high 14 points, while Gregory Echenique (Venezuela) had his first double-double as a Bluejay with 12 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nIt was the 75th game in Bluejay history in which two foreign players saw action in the same game, but first time that both would score in double-figures.\n\nOther previous simultaneous foreign tandems include Livan Pyfrom (Bahamas) and Nerijus Karlikanovas (Lithuania) in 1999-2000, as well as Brice Nengsu (Cameroon) and Manny Gakou (France) from 2005-07.\n\nHe's The Manigat\n\nFreshman Jahenns Manigat has started 13 of Creighton's last 14 games and appears to be showing no signs of hitting the proverbial 'freshman wall'. In those 13 starts, Manigat is making 50.8 percent of his shots from the floor and averaging 7.8 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 0.9 steals per game. Creighton is 9-4 in those starts.\n\nLook At These Numbers\n\nDoug McDermott has averaged 15.0 points and 7.6 rebounds per game so far this season. He ranks fourth in the MVC in scoring and is second in rebounding in all games.\n\nSince 1998-99, the only MVC player to have season averages at least 15.0 points and 7.6 rebounds per game was Wichita State's Jason Perez in 1999-2000, when the senior averaged 20.2 points and 8.0 rebounds per contest.\n\nFreshman Sensation\n\nWith seven MVC Newcomer of the Week honors to his name, Creighton freshman Doug McDermott was a slam-dunk candidate to capture MVC Freshman of the Year accolades. McDermott is averaging 15.0 points, 7.6 rebounds per game.\n\nAccording to MVC associate commissioner for communications Mike Kern, McDermott became the first freshman to be named first-team all-conference since Cleo Littleton of Wichita State in 1952. Littleton likely is the only freshman to make first-team all-league all four seasons.\n\nRodney Buford of Creighton was the last player in league history to earn all-league honors four straight years -- he was a second-teamer as a freshman, then a first teamer his last three years. The freshman of the year award has been around since 1986 and no winner of the award has ever made first-team All-MVC.\n\nDouble-Digits For Doug\n\nAccording to STATS Inc., Creighton freshman Doug McDermott was the nation's only freshman to open the 2010-11 season by scoring in double-figures in each of his team's first eight games.\n\nAdditionally, McDermott is among the national freshmen leaders in double-figure scoring games and double-doubles, as seen below:\n\nDouble-Figure Scoring Games, Freshmen\n\nSource: STATS Inc. • Through March 24, 2011\n\nStreak Name, School Next Game\n\n33 Brandon Knight, Kentucky 3/25\n\n33 J.J.

SIU's Mamadou Seck (13) was next in that category.\n\nNot surprisingly then, Doug McDermott was far ahead in the number of league games with 15 or more points and seven or more rebounds, with 11.

No other school in the history of the MVC has ever done so even once.\n\nIn 2009-10, Creighton averaged 14,495 fans per game, which ranked 15th nationally. Creighton averaged 15,883 in 15 games at Qwest Center Omaha (which would have ranked 10th) before two CIT crowds below 5,000 at the Omaha Civic Auditorium dropped the average precipitously.\n\nThis year the team ranked 14th at the end of the regular-season with an average of 15,026 before the CBI has brought down the crowds.\n\nCreighton has finished in the top-15 of the national attendance leaders in each of the previous four seasons.\n\n2010-11 Attendance Leaders (through 3/27)\n\nRk.

Winn calls them “the most surprising father-son combination in Division I”. The story can be found on-line at http://tinyurl.com/si-mcd-story.\n\nNot Half Bad\n\nDoug McDermott had 21 points in the first half against Davidson on March 21, most by a Bluejay in one half since November of 2008.\n\nBelow is the most points in any half by a Bluejay individual this year:\n\nPts.

It's worth noting that before this season, Creighton's last player with 10 or more rebounds in a half was Brody Deren (11) at Bradley on Jan. 5, 2004.\n\nMcDermott would finish with 17 rebounds for the game, most by a Bluejay freshman since Bob Harstad pulled down 17 rebounds at Southern Illinois on Jan. 28, 1988.\n\nBelow is the most rebounds in any half by a Bluejay individual this year.\n\nPts.

Young had 10 helpers once again on March 23 vs. UCF.\n\nBuilding A Lead\n\nCreighton's 49-25 lead at halftime on Jan. 19 vs. Bradley was its largest halftime lead at Qwest Center Omaha since a 47-20 advantage over Nebraska on Nov. 24, 2007.\n\nCreighton's 49 points in the first half was its most at Qwest Center Omaha by intermission since Houston Baptist also had 49 on Dec. 17, 2007.\n\nWhat's Your Twenty?\n\nCreighton has been .500 or better after 20 games in each of the last 16 seasons, including this season.\n\nCreighton -- First 20 Games, Last 16 Years\n\nYear First 20 W-L Final W-L Postseason\n\n2010-11 13-7 ? ? ?

That list includes Doug McDermott, Antoine Young, Kenny Lawson Jr., Kaleb Korver, Jahenns Manigat, Josh Jones and Ethan Wragge.\n\nIn addition, Darryl Ashford had a game with four three-pointers last season, while Casey Harriman owns five career games with three treys.\n\nNBA Jays\n\nKyle Korver and Anthony Tolliver give Creighton a pair of alums in the NBA for the third straight year.\n\nKorver plays for the Chicago Bulls and is in his eighth year in the NBA, including previous stops in Philadelphia and Utah.\n\nTolliver plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves and is in his third year in the NBA, including previous stops with Cleveland, San Antonio, New Orleans, Portland and Golden State.\n\nCreighton has now had an NBA player in 27 of the last 28 years, and 44 of 47 seasons since 1964-65.\n\nIn addition, Creighton alum Paul Silas is the head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nGoing Over .500, Again\n\nCreighton has been better than .500 in either the first or second-half of the league season in 31 straight trips through the league, including this year's first half.\n\nCreighton's 31 consecutive halves above .500 in league play is easily the Valley's longest active streak, far ahead of Wichita State (5), Indiana State (3), Missouri State (2), Evansville (1).\n\nHere's how Creighton's teams have fared in the various halves of the MVC season since 1995-96. Notably, this is the fourth straight season Creighton has been 5-4 at the midway point. In 2008-09 (as well as in 2000-01), Creighton went 9-0 in the second half of the Valley slate.\n\nYear 1st Half 2nd Half\n\n2010-11 5-4 5-4\n\n2009-10 5-4 5-4\n\n2008-09 5-4 9-0\n\n2007-08 5-4 5-4\n\n2006-07 6-3 7-2\n\n2005-06 7-2 5-4\n\n2004-05 5-4 6-3\n\n2003-04 7-2 5-4\n\n2002-03 8-1 7-2\n\n2001-02 8-1 6-3\n\n2000-01 5-4 9-0\n\n1999-00 5-4 6-3\n\n1998-99 6-3 5-4\n\n1997-98 5-4 7-2\n\n1996-97 5-4 5-4\n\n1995-96 4-5 5-4\n\nTotal 91-53 (.632) 97-47 (.674)\n\nArmy of Iowans\n\nEvery Creighton team since 1988-89 has had at least one Iowa native, and this season is no exception.\n\nCreighton has five players from Iowa on this season's team, continuing a long trend of relying on some of the Hawkeye State's top preps. CU's native Iowans this season include seniors Casey Harriman (Ida Grove) and Kaleb Korver (Pella) as well as redshirting sophomore Grant Gibbs (Marion) and freshmen Doug McDermott (Ames) and Will Artino (Waukee).\n\nOther past notable Iowans include Kyle Korver and Pierce Hibma (Pella), Ryan Sears (Ankeny), Brody Deren (Harlan), Tyler McKinney (Urbandale), Nate Funk (Sioux City) and Michael Lindeman (Iowa Falls).\n\nCreighton has played at least one Iowa native in 547 straight games. That streak dates to a Feb. 5, 1994 win against Wichita State.\n\nJays Earn 10 Home Wins, Again\n\nThe Jan. 19 win against Bradley was Creighton's 10th home victory this season. Creighton has now won 10 or more home games in 15 straight seasons.\n\nThe streak is a school-record, three more than the previous standard of 12 straight seasons from the 1969-70 season to the 1980-81 campaign with 10 or more home wins.\n\nCreighton To Visit San Diego State In 2011\n\nCreighton learned that it will visit San Diego State on Nov. 30, 2011 to open play in the third annual Mountain West Conference/Missouri Valley Conference Challenge Series.\n\nThe event pits teams in head-to-head format against each other. The Valley won the inaugural competition in 2009 by a 5-4 margin, before the MWC claimed an 8-1 victory in 2010.\n\nCreighton is 3-1 all-time against SDSU, though the teams have not met since 1974.\n\nHome Cooking\n\nCreighton is 58-14 at home all-time at Qwest Center Omaha in MVC games (.806) compared to a 34-38 (.472) road record in the MVC during that stretch.\n\nOnly six MVC visiting schools (DU, ILS, MSU, UNI, SIU and WSU) have ever won a game in the eight-year old Qwest Center Omaha. The other three Valley schools (BU, UE, INS) have an Omaha losing streak of 10 or longer.\n\nBelow is a look at Creighton's current home winning streaks over current league foes:\n\nOpponent CU Home Win Streak CU W-L at QCO\n\nBradley Won 13 8-0\n\nDrake Won 2 6-2\n\nEvansville Won 12 8-0\n\nIllinois State Won 1 5-3\n\nIndiana State Won 12 8-0\n\nMissouri State Lost 1 6-2\n\nNorthern Iowa Won 1 6-2\n\nSo. Illinois Won 4 4-4\n\nWichita State Lost 1 7-1\n\nRare Combo Sinks Jays\n\nCreighton lost at Northern Iowa on Jan. 26 despite shooting 50.0 percent from the field and owning a +11 edge on the glass.\n\nThe last time the Jays shot at least 50 percent from the field and were +10 on the glass in a loss was Jan. 12, 1985, when Nolan Richardson's Tulsa team topped Creighton by a near-identical 70-66 score. In that contest, Creighton shot 21-39 from the floor and won the battle of the boards, 48-36. CU had won its previous 42 games with a +10 glass edge and 50% shooting from the floor.\n\nTake things a step further, and you'll see that the loss on Jan. 26 was historic. It was the first time since the inception of the three-point shot (1986-87) that Creighton lost despite shooting 50 percent or better from both the floor and three-point arc, and also winning the boards by 10 or more. Creighton had been 9-0 previously when doing that, winning those games by an average of 27.0 points.\n\nLawson Was Up For Senior CLASS Award\n\nSenior center Kenny Lawson Jr. was one of 30 candidates nationwide for the Senior CLASS Award. The award – presented annually to the NCAA Division I Student-Athlete of the Year in 10 sports – focuses on the “Four C's” of classroom, character, community and competition. He did not make the list of the 10 finalists.\n\nAn acronym for Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School, the award was launched during the 2001-02 season to honor the attributes of college basketball seniors who remain committed to their university and pursue the many rewards that a senior season and complete college education brings.\n\nLawson is the one of two MVC men's athletes named this year (joining Bradley guard Dodie Dunson), but the fourth Creighton candidate since 2003. Kyle Korver was a finalist for the award in 2003, while Anthony Tolliver was a finalist in 2007. Both were also named Senior CLASS All-Americans. In addition, Dane Watts was a candidate in 2008 but did not advance to the final stage.\n\nCreighton, which also has Sam Schuett as a candidate for the women's award, is one of just five schools nationally (Creighton, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Lehigh and Duke) with a candidate on both the men's and women's side.\n\nThe 2011 men's candidate class includes three CoSIDA Academic All-Americans from a year ago, nine student-athletes on the preseason watch list for the John R. Wooden Award, 16 players with grade point averages of 3.0 and above and eight from teams ranked in the Associated Press preseason top 25. It also includes 2010-11 Creighton opponents Dodie Dunson (Bradley), Jimmer Fredette (BYU) and Cameron Jones (Northern Arizona).\n\nCreighton Prep Alum Scores, Ends Drought\n\nTaylor Stormberg scored his first points as a Bluejay when his two free throws with 1:18 left closed the scoring on Jan. 12 vs. Wichita State.\n\nIncredibly for a hometown kid who attended a high school with as much athletic success as Creighton Prep, Stormberg's points marked the first by a former Junior Jay since Mark Johnson scored one point in a 98-77 win over West Texas State on Jan. 21, 1984.\n\nRare Comeback Against Jays\n\nCreighton had won 49 straight home games in which it had owned a lead of 10 or more at any point in the game, before blowing a 31-20 lead against Missouri State on Jan. 4th.\n\nIn fact, the 11-point rally matched the largest comeback in Qwest Center Omaha history by a visiting team, previously done by Drexel in 2007.\n\nCreighton had been 9-0 all-time in games at Qwest Center Omaha in contests that saw both teams claim double-digit leads previously.\n\nThe last time Creighton lost a lead came after leading by 12 or more points at home came on Super Bowl Sunday in 2002 (Feb. 3, 2002), when SIU overcame a 16-point first-half deficit (and 48-34 at half) to beat the Jays, 79-77, on two free throws by Kent Williams with 0.3 seconds left. Williams is currently an assistant on for Missouri State.\n\nDouble-Double Duo\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. had 14 points and 16 rebounds, while Doug McDermott had 28 points and 10 rebounds, as Creighton topped Drake on January 1.\n\nIt marked the first time Creighton had two double-doubles in the same game since Lawson (17/11) and Justin Carter (10/13) did so vs. Bradley on March 5, 2010 in the State Farm MVC Tournament.\n\nIronically, each of the previous two times Creighton had two men with a double-double in the same game, it had lost. The last Bluejay win with two double-doubles was Feb. 1, 1999, when Rodney Buford (11/11) and Doug Swenson (19/10) double-dipped at SIU.\n\nChairman Of The Boards\n\nFreshman Doug McDermott is having one of the best rebounding seasons by a Bluejay in years. McDermott's 7.6 rebound per game average is ahead of the 7.3 per game by Rodney Buford in 1997-98 for the best by a Bluejay in the past 17 seasons.\n\nThe Jays have not had a player average more than 7.4 rebounds per game since Nate King averaged 9.0 rebounds per game in 1993-94.\n\nHarriman Opts For Surgery\n\nPlagued by a pair of partially torn labrums, among other maladies, senior forward Casey Harriman elected to have season-ending shoulder surgery on January 5th.\n\nHarriman made the decision on January 3rd, but was given once last chance to play. He played in the final minute of a 12-point home loss to Missouri State, receiving standing ovations both when he checked in, then again 19 seconds later when he checked out.\n\nHarriman played 13 minutes total in six games this season, finishing with two points and two rebounds. For his career, Harriman started 16 of 104 games played and finishes with 336 points, 242 rebounds and 44 charges taken.\n\nOn A Roll\n\nCreighton won a season-high six straight games from Dec. 11-Jan. 1. The Bluejays have now put together at least one five-game win streak in 13 of the last 14 seasons.\n\nSince 1988-89, the Bluejays have made the NCAA's, NIT or CBI all 16 times they've had a five-game winning streak in a season, but missed the NCAA/NIT/CBI all seven times they haven't.\n\nA Sketch on Ech\n\nGregory Echenique has made an immediate impact for Creighton, as the Jays are 17-10 since he became eligible on December 17th.\n\nWith the big Venezuelan in the line-up, Creighton has held the opposition to 63.8 points per game (compared to 67.7 per game before he became active) and 42.8 percent shooting from the floor (compared to 43.2 percent).\n\nIn addition, Creighton has outrebounded foes by +4.8 rebounds per game, compared to a +1.0 advantage before he arrived.\n\nOffensively, Creighton's field goal percentage has jumped from 42.1 percent to 47.1 percent and its three-point percentage has improved from 31.7 percent to 38.7 percent.\n\nThe Echenique Effect\n\nWhile the addition of Gregory Echenique's 10.3 points per game to the line-up has been a big boost, he's made a similar impact on the defensive end of the floor in the lane. Echenique has blocked 47 shots, already good enough to lead the team and rank second-most in The Valley.\n\nImpact Player\n\nGregory Echenique scored 12 points in his Creighton debut on Dec. 18 vs. Idaho St., then added 16 more on Dec. 20 vs. Western Illinois.\n\nEchenique was just the third Creighton player in the last 15 years to start with 12 points or more in each of his first two games, joining Darryl Ashford (2009-10) and Edward St. Fleur (1995-96).\n\nQwest Center Records Fall\n\nCreighton set one Qwest Center Omaha record and tied another in its Dec. 22 home win over Samford.\n\nCreighton set a building record by outrebounding the Bulldogs 45-19. That mark was Creighton's largest margin since an identical +26 differential over Mississippi Valley State on Dec. 29, 2001 back when it played at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nCreighton also held Samford to a season-low 40 points, which tied the fewest points ever in a Qwest Center Omaha game. Alcorn State also had 40 on Nov. 15, 2004.\n\nDefensive Gem\n\nCreighton held Samford to just 40 points on December 22nd. That was the best defensive effort by the Bluejays since limiting Indiana State to 38 points in an MVC Tournament quarterfinal victory on March 2, 2007.\n\nCreighton, which held Jim Molinari's Western Illinois club to 47 points on Dec. 20, held consecutive opponents under 50 points for the first time since Dec. 3-6, 2003.\n\nThe 87 points allowed over those two games was the best stretch by Creighton in any set of back-to-back games since Dec. 5-9, 1958 (86).\n\nJosh Jones Provides Offensive Boost\n\nSophomore Josh Jones entered the Dec. 29 game at Illinois State mired in a 9-of-38 shooting slump to start the season, including 0-of-16 from three-point range.\n\nAgainst the Redbirds, Jones hit 2-of-3 shots from long-range, and he tied his season-high with six points. The Jays outscored ISU 15-10 in the 8:51 with Jones on the floor.\n\nCreighton is 21-7 over the past two seasons when Jones scores five or more points, but 13-21 when he plays and doesn't score five points or more.\n\nEchenique Debuts\n\nDec. 18 marked Creighton's first game with the services of Gregory Echenique, who was an ineligible transfer until Dec. 17. He became eligible at the end of Creighton's fall semester.\n\nEchenique, a 6'9”, 270-pound center, came to Creighton after spending three semesters at Rutgers from 2008-09. He averaged 9.2 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots per game in 39 contests with the Scarlet Knights, which included 37 starts and an average of 27.5 minutes per game.\n\nHe had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocked shots in 18 minutes vs. Idaho State in his Creighton debut. He followed that up with 16 points, four rebounds and four blocked shots in 21 minutes vs. Western Illinois. At the time, Echenique's four blocked shots on Dec. 20 were tied for the most in the MVC in any game this year by one player. He now owns the top two efforts this season in the MVC, with seven blocks at Missouri State (Jan. 22) after six at Indiana State (Jan. 16).\n\nRed-Hot Start\n\nCreighton made its first eight field goal attempts from the field to open its Dec. 18 win over Idaho State, with six of those shots coming from long-range. That helped Creighton build a 22-13 lead which it never surrendered.\n\nInterestingly, it was the second straight game that Creighton had a stretch of six straight three-point attempts that were all made, having done it on six straight possessions vs. Saint Joseph's.\n\nIn eight seasons of games at Qwest Center Omaha (136 games), Creighton's best had been 6-for-6 starts from the floor vs. High Point (Dec. 2, 2004) and Illinois State (Jan. 22, 2005).\n\nIn fact, this was just the seventh occasion all-time that Creighton had started as well as 4-for-4 from the field. Creighton started 5-for-5 vs. UCF on March 23, 2011 for its eighth 4-for-4 start.\n\nCreighton is 54-for-136 all-time in its first shot of the game at Qwest Center Omaha, including a 6-for-21 mark this winter.\n\nNo TV, No Problem\n\nCreighton is a perfect 45-0 in regular-season non-televised games at Qwest Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton has also won 27 straight non-televised home games at Qwest Center Omaha, dating to a March 20, 2006 loss to Miami (Fla.) in the NIT.\n\nPractice Pays Off\n\nAntoine Young is frequently the last player in the gym after practice, staying late to work on his shot. The dedication is clearly paying off.\n\nYoung entered this season a career 25.6 percent shooter from three-point range (23-90). This season, he's at 31.9 percent (38-119) from downtown.\n\nAt the line, Young entered the year as a 64.3 percent shooter (101-157). He's currently at 75.5 percent from the stripe (117-155).\n\nYoung connected on a career-high four three-point attempts vs. Idaho State on Dec. 18. His 4-for-4 shooting from downtown was a Qwest Center Omaha record for three-point shots without a miss by a Bluejay, eclipsing previous 3-for-3 displays by Johnny Mathies, Pierce Hibma, Dane Watts and Booker Woodfox. Josh Jones tied that mark on March 21 vs. Davidson.\n\nLikewise, his 10-for-10 marksmanship from the line on Jan. 1 vs. Drake was a Qwest Center Omaha record for most free throws in a game without a miss.\n\nA Fan Of The A-10\n\nSophomore Ethan Wragge had a career-high of 22 points on Dec. 11 vs. Saint Joseph's, eclipsing his previous best of 21 that came last year in 17 minutes vs. fellow Atlantic-10 power Xavier.\n\nJust like the game against Xavier, Wragge had his points in fewer than 20 minutes of playing time. When he did it last season, he became the first CU player to score more than 20 points in less than 20 minutes since Vernon Moore put up 21 points in 19 minutes against Nebraska-Kearney on Nov. 24, 1984.\n\nIn three career games against the Atlantic-10 Conference, Wragge has scored 54 points (18.0 ppg.) in 48 minutes (16.0 mpg.) of play, connecting on 14-of-24 three-point attempts (58.3 percent) and 18-of-28 shots overall (64.3 percent).\n\nSolid Stretch\n\nEthan Wragge will be hard-pressed to have a better four-minute stretch than what he had on Dec. 11 in a win over Saint Joseph's.\n\nWragge drained consecutive three-pointers with 15:55, 15:10, 13:56, 13:06 and 12:26 left in the second half. He also assisted on a Kaleb Korver trey at the 13:29 mark, and took a charge with 13:13 remaining.\n\nShades Of The Dynamic Duo\n\nDoug McDermott's 20 points and 12 rebounds vs. No. 21 BYU on Dec. 1 were special numbers for any player, but even moreso considering he's just a freshman.\n\nCreighton had not had a freshman record a double-double since Bob Harstad had 18 points and 13 rebounds at No. 14 Bradley on March 9, 1988.\n\nThe last Bluejay freshman to have at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in the same game was Chad Gallagher, who had 20 points and 10 rebounds vs. Nebraska-Kearney on Jan. 20, 1988.\n\nMcDermott owns nine double-doubles this winter.\n\nMcDermott Chalks Up Four Straight Honors\n\nDoug McDermott was named MVC Newcomer of the Week for a fourth straight week on Dec. 6th.\n\nIn the 104-year history of the league, McDermott is the only basketball (men's or women's) player to win Player or Newcomer of the Week in four consecutive weeks.\n\nMcDermott's seven Newcomer of the Week honors (he also won it on Jan. 3, Jan. 24 and Jan. 31) thus far are the most ever for an entire season in league history. Bradley's Marcellus Sommerville won the award six times during his debut season in the league in 2003-04.\n\nLawson Named Player of the Week\n\nCreighton senior Kenny Lawson Jr. was named MVC Player of the Week on December 13 following his career-highs of 30 points and 18 rebounds in a win over Saint Joseph's. He played a career-high 34 minutes and also registered a season-best three blocked shots.\n\nThis was the first MVC Player of the Week honor of Lawson's career.\n\nLaying Down The Law\n\nKenny Lawson Jr.'s 30-point, 18-rebound game vs. Saint Joseph's on Dec. 11 kept the pages of the Bluejay record book busy.\n\nHis 18 rebounds were the most by a Bluejay since Bob Harstad had 20 rebounds on Jan. 23, 1989. Harstad, ironically, had his jersey retired at halftime and spoke to the team before its pre-game shootaround earlier that Saturday.\n\nHis 18 rebounds were also a Qwest Center Omaha record, three more than the previous mark set by Creighton's Justin Carter (vs. Kentucky) and by Akron's Romeo Travis (vs. Creighton).\n\nLawson's 30 points were the most by a Bluejay since P'Allen Stinnett had 30 points against New Mexico on Nov. 16, 2008.\n\nLawson was the first Bluejay with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in the same game since Rodney Buford had 30 points and 10 rebounds at Northern Iowa on Dec. 30, 1997. Doug McDermott had 31 points and 10 rebounds vs. Davidson on March 21.\n\nLawson was the first Bluejay with at least 30 points and 18 rebounds in the same game since Feb. 7, 1983, when Gregory Brandon had 32 points and 18 rebounds in a win over West Texas State.\n\nLawson is believed to be the first player in the MVC with a game of 30 points and 18 rebounds since Wichita State's Xavier McDaniel had 33 points and 22 rebounds on Feb. 23, 1985 against Bradley.\n\nFinally, Lawson had 14 points and 11 rebounds in the second half alone. The last Bluejay with a double-double in one half was Brody Deren, who had 12 points and 11 rebounds in the second half of a Jan. 5, 2004 win at Bradley.\n\nDoubling Up From The Start\n\nDoug McDermott scored 10 or more points in each of his first eight games this season. The last previous Creighton player to start a career with 10 or more points in each of the first eight games was Benoit Benjamin in 1982-83, who had also eight in a row to start his career.\n\nMcDermott was the first Bluejay (of any class) to score 10 or more in eight straight games to start the season since then-senior Rodney Buford in 1998-99 had 13 in a row.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's longest double-figure scoring streaks to start a season since 1979-80.\n\nConsecutive Double-Figure Scoring Games\n\nTo Start Year, Since 1979-80\n\nConsec. Name, Class Year\n\nall 32 Vernon Moore, Sr. 1984-85\n\n28 Benoit Benjamin, Jr. 1984-85\n\n27 Bob Harstad, Sr. 1990-91\n\n16 Rod Mason, Sr. 1987-88\n\n13 Rodney Buford, Sr. 1998-99\n\n12 Gary Swain, Sr. 1986-87\n\n10 Chad Gallagher, Sr. 1990-91\n\n9 Rodney Buford, So. 1996-97\n\n8 Benoit Benjamin, Fr. 1982-83\n\n8 Gregory Brandon, Sr. 1983-84\n\n8 Doug McDermott, Fr. 2010-11\n\nAll-Tournament Honors\n\nBoth Doug McDermott and Antoine Young were named to the All-Tournament Team of the Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge.\n\nMcDermott averaged a team-high 15.0 points per game in the event, shooting 54.5 percent from the field and 9-for-9 at the line. He also added six assist, a steal and a block.\n\nYoung averaged 13.8 points per game and added 16 assists and seven steals. He shot 44.1 percent from the floor, 50 percent from three-point range and 79.2 percent at the line.\n\nIowa State won the event with a 4-0 record, while Creighton finished 3-1.\n\nIowa State's Diante Garrett was named tournament MVP, while Melvin Ejim (Iowa State), Cameron Jones (Northern Arizona) and Spencer Dixon (Kennesaw State) were also honored on the squad with McDermott and Young.\n\nRare Freshman Start\n\nWith his start on Nov. 12, Doug McDermott became the first Creighton freshman to start the season-opener since Ryan Sears in 1997-98. Sears would go on to earn MVC Freshman of the Year honors, starting all 124 games of his Bluejay career and remains the MVC's all-time leader with 283 steals. Sears also dished a Creighton-record 570 career assists.\n\nA Strong Fall\n\nCreighton has already placed three teams into the NCAA Tournament during the 2010-11 school year, as Bluejay teams in women's soccer, men's soccer and women's volleyball have all made the “Big Dance” within the past month.\n\nOn a national basis, only 10 schools nationally can say this, an elite list that consists of Creighton, California, Duke, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio State, Penn, Penn State and UCLA.\n\nCreighton men's basketball has seven NCAA Tournament appearances in the past 13 years (including this season), most in the MVC in that time.\n\nHarstad Honored on Dec. 11\n\nAlready inducted into both the Creighton Athletics (2002) and Missouri Valley Conference (2008) Hall of Fame's, former Creighton men's basketball standout Bob Harstad was honored during the Dec. 11 game vs. Saint Joseph's.\n\nHarstad's jersey was retired during a halftime ceremony. The Loveland, Colo., native wore No. 30 during his career from 1987-91 with the Jays, but the number will still be available for current (such as Antoine Young) and future Bluejays to wear.\n\nThe only other previous players to have their jersey's retired in Creighton men's basketball history are Bob Portman (#33), Paul Silas (#35) and Bob Gibson (#45).\n\nHarstad is one of only four MVC players -- joining Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson, Indiana State's Larry Bird and Wichita State's Xavier McDaniel -- to score 2,000 points (2,110) and grab 1,000 or more rebounds (1,126).\n\nA first-team All-MVC choice from 1989 to 1991, he was named the Missouri Valley Conference's Player of the Year in 1990 and earned State Farm MVC Tournament Most Outstanding Player honors in 1991.\n\nHe led CU to regular-season titles and postseason tournament crowns in 1989 and 1991. He also powered the Jays to two NCAA Tournament appearances and a win over New Mexico State in the first round in 1991.\n\nActive Leader\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. leads all active Missouri Valley Conference players with 747 rebounds, 152 blocked shots and 107 games started. He also ranks 18th in Creighton history on the all-time scoring list:\n\nMost Points, Creighton History\n\nRk. Pts.

Lawson, who now stands at 698, ranks second in Qwest Center Omaha scoring history. Nate Funk holds the facility record with 735 career points.\n\nLawson (402 rebounds) is atop the Qwest Center Omaha rebound list, just ahead of Dane Watts (351).\n\nLawson also owns 80 blocks in his career at Qwest Center Omaha. That's a facility record, seven more than the former mark held by Anthony Tolliver. The top shot blockers in Bluejay history (at all sites) are listed below:\n\nMost Blocked Shots, Creighton History\n\nBlk.

The 21 losses have been by a combined 137 points (6.5 ppg.). Creighton has led wire-to-wire 29 different times, including four times this winter.\n\nCreighton's win on Nov. 17 vs. Louisiana was its 100th all-time at the facility, coming in just 118 games. By comparison, Creighton needed 138 games to reach 100 wins at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nCreighton is also a mind-boggling 19-12 at Qwest Center Omaha in games in which it trails by 10 or more points at any juncture.\n\nCreighton is 9-1 in Qwest Center Omaha games in which both teams own leads of 10 or more points, and 28-1 in games at Qwest Center Omaha in which there are no lead changes.\n\nBig Shoes To Fill\n\nCreighton's Greg McDermott replaced the school's all-time wins leader, Dana Altman, who was named head coach at Oregon in April. The winningest coach in school history, Altman was 327-176 in 16 years at Creighton, leading the program to seven NCAA Tournaments and 13 straight postseason bids.\n\nAltman's win total ranks third in Missouri Valley Conference history and he was named coach of the Missouri Valley Conference's All-Centennial Team in 2007.\n\nReturn Of The Mac\n\nGreg McDermott is the 10th MVC head coach to coach at two different league schools and first since Ken Hayes got hired away from Tulsa to go to New Mexico State in 1975.\n\nHe is the first to go to a different league and coach there, then come back to the MVC.\n\nMcDermott went 90-63 in five years at Northern Iowa from 2001-06, advancing to the NCAA Tournament each of his final three seasons.\n\nLong-Distance Streak Alive\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 571 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993. That's the longest active streak in the MVC.\n\nUNLV, Vanderbilt and Kentucky are the only three schools that have made at least one three-point basket since the rule was adopted prior to the 1986 campaign.\n\nQuick Starts Key To Playing in Postseason\n\nCreighton has started off 3-0 (or better) in 11 of the past 13 seasons, including this season. Each of Creighton's last 12 starts of 3-0 or better have been culminated in a postseason tournament appearance at the end of the year, including this year's CBI appearance\n\nJays Sweep Weekly Awards\n\nCreighton swept the weekly awards handed out by the Missouri Valley Conference on Nov. 15, as Antoine Young was named MVC Player of the Week and Doug McDermott named MVC Newcomer of the Week.\n\nYoung averaged 16.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.5 steals per game in wins over Alabama State and Northern Arizona. He opened the year with 21 points against ASU while also grabbing a career-high seven rebounds. He scored the first four points and assisted a three-pointer in the 11-0 second half run that gave Creighton the lead for good. On Nov. 14, he had 11 points, four rebounds, three steals and three assists in a win over NAU.\n\nMcDermott averaged 13.0 points and 4.5 rebounds in his first weekend of play. He began his career with 16 points and seven rebounds against Alabama State, becoming the first freshman to start the opener since 1997-98. He then had 10 points in Creighton's 74-70 win over Northern Arizona.\n\nMcDermott repeated his honors on Nov. 22 after averaging 14.0 points and 5.5 rebounds in two games.\n\nMcDermott won his third straight award on Nov. 29 after averaging 16.0 points and 4.5 rebounds per game vs. Kennesaw State and Northwestern, shooting 70 percent (14-20) from the floor.\n\nMcDermott made it 4-for-4 on Dec. 6th, earning the honor after averaging 15.0 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in losses to No. 21 BYU and Nebraska.\n\nForeign Invasion\n\nCreighton has a pair of foreigners on the roster for just the third time in school history with Canadian Jahenns Manigat and Venezuelan Gregory Echenique.
