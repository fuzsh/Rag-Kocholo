        "text": "Tuesday, February 18, 1997\n\nM. HOOPS:\n\nWin on the road puts UCLA ahead of USC and CaliforniaBy\n\nEmmanuelle Ejercito\n\nDaily Bruin Staff\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. — The No. 17 UCLA men’s basketball team completed\n\nits sweep in the desert with a victory over Arizona State on\n\nSaturday, 92-81.\n\n\"(UCLA) is much better and keeps getting better,\" ASU head coach\n\nBill Frieder said. \"They’ve come together. (The media) panics\n\nsometimes, but they are right there where they want to be.\"\n\nAnd where they want to be is alone in first place in the Pac-10\n\nconference standings.\n\nWith crosstown rival USC falling to Arizona 101-77 on Saturday,\n\nthe Bruins (15-7 overall, 10-3 Pac-10) own a one-game lead over the\n\nTrojans and California.\n\n\"(The sweep) is important because we lost the home game to Cal\n\n(on Feb. 6),\" UCLA head coach Steve Lavin said. \"With that loss to\n\nCal, we knew we had to get one back somewhere down the road and\n\nthat meant that we had to sweep a road trip, and we were able to do\n\nthat. I’m really proud of our guys.\"\n\nWhile a victory over the Sun Devils (10-14, 2-10), who have lost\n\n17 straight to the Bruins, seemed like a given, there was a danger\n\nof a letdown for UCLA. After the emotionally and physically\n\ndraining win two nights before against No. 11 Arizona, Lavin needed\n\nto make sure his team did not lose its concentration against ASU.\n\nHis answer: full court press.\n\n\"I was a little concerned about us coming from Arizona and\n\nbecause of our energy not coming out aggressive and attacking,\"\n\nLavin said. \"I thought that if we pressed, that would get us into a\n\nmore aggressive mind-set, a more attacking mode. It gets the heart\n\nstarted, it gets the blood flowing, it gets the adrenaline pumping\n\nin the game.\"\n\nThe full court press forced ASU to commit 15 turnovers while the\n\nBruins only gave up 14, half the number of turnovers they had\n\nagainst Arizona.\n\nUCLA’s defense also held the Sun Devils to a field-goal\n\npercentage of 42.7. Meanwhile, the Bruin offense was shooting a hot\n\n53.6 percent, thanks in part to Toby Bailey’s 9 for 11 shooting.\n\nBailey led the Bruins with 20 points.\n\nSenior Cameron Dollar added a career-high 19 points. In\n\naddition, he snatched three steals to complement his four assists\n\non the offensive end.\n\n\"I felt the need to come out and be aggressive and set a tone,\n\nnot necessarily with the shot or scoring but just overall,\" Dollar\n\nsaid. \"I was just trying to be everywhere. I was just trying to get\n\nmy hand on the ball, trying to make things happen so that we\n\nwouldn’t come out dead.\"\n\nUCLA took control early in the game. The last time the Bruins\n\ntrailed was two minutes into the game, when they fell behind, 6-4.\n\nAfter that, it was all UCLA.\n\nThe biggest lead UCLA had was 15, when Jelani McCoy slammed home\n\na rebound with five minutes left in the first half.\n\nHowever, Arizona State would come back and threaten the Bruin\n\nlead behind freshman Eddie House’s game-high 24 points. The Sun\n\nDevils cut the lead down to three with 16:40 left in the second\n\nhalf, but UCLA responded with a 6-0 run and ASU would never get\n\ncloser.\n\nAARON TOUT"
