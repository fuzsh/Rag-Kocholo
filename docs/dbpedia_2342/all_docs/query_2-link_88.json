That night the also-rans of the league (seeds 11-14) will play a doubleheader that will attract only the true diehards (otherwise known as DePaul and Seton Hall fans). PC's best Big East run of success in four seasons has bumped the Friars into the second round of games on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a quick look at what could unfold. First, the Friars have three games remaining, hosting St. John's and Seton Hall and traveling to Connecticut. This Saturday's St. John's game has all sorts of delicious implications, but let's just say that the Friars will really help themselves with a win. PC (7-8) is a game behind the Red Storm (8-7) and is currently grouped with Steve Lavin's boys in any postseason tournament discussions. If the Friars can take care of business against SJU and beat lowly Seton Hall (which has lost nine in a row!), they'll be assured of at least a 9-9 record. The other teams currently lumped with PC in the standings are Cincinnati (7-8) and St. John's. Both teams have significantly tougher finishes to their schedules than PC does.\n\nThe Bearcats, who lost at PC and have dropped three in a row and five of six, finish with UConn and South Florida at home, and at Louisville. St. John's comes to PC, stays on the road at Notre Dame and closes out with a home game against Marquette. If Vegas wanted to place bets on the finish of those three teams, it could easily fall with PC (9-9), Cincinnati (9-9) and St. John's (8-10). That would give PC the number 8 seed, followed by Cincinnati and St. John's. In that scenario, the Friars would play Cincinnati in at noon on March 13.\n\nThe other local DI team\n\nOf course if Bryant is the numero uno seed in the NEC tourney, it would be time to dream about a three-game sweep and an NCAA bid. Bottom line is Bryant is in excellent shape to lock down a first round home game and maybe even more in the NEC tournament (March 6, 9 and 12). That's a long, long way from winning two games just a season ago.\n\nBy the way, we do not mean to slight what Rhode Island College or other local teams will do in the coming weeks in postseason play. The Anchormen are becoming too good for their own league after winning the Little East title for the fifth time in seven years. The Anchormen (25-3) will advance to the NCAA Div. III men's basketball tournament for the seventh consecutive season. The NCAA announced its D-3 field this afternoon and RIC will host Hobart on March 2.\n\nThis is high school playoff time and just like the Rhode Island Interscholastic League and New England Prep School league, other states are staging their biggest games right now.\n\nHere's how some local recruits are faring. Sunday was a big day for PC signees Brandon Austin and Rodney Bullock. With Austin rolling for 23 points, six rebounds, and five steals, his Imhotep Prep team won the Philadelphia city title with a 67-66 win over Roberts Vaux. Austin's team barely eclipsed the 45-point explosion of Roberts' guard Rysheed Jordan, one of the top unsigned (Temple, UCLA, St. John's) players in the country.\n\nBullock (18 points, 15 rebounds) kept his Kecoughtan (Va.) High team alive in the Virginia state tournament with a tight win. They'll play in the region finals tonight against Great Bridge.\n\nURI's E.C. Matthews has his Romulus High (18-1) team ready for the Michigan state playoffs. Hassan Martin and Curtis High on Staten Island (21-4) are poised to make a run in the New York City Public School League playoffs.\n\nIt's getting tougher and tougher to put together my Top 25 vote for the Associated Press poll. At this time of the year even the best teams will lose games in the heat of conference play. Or at least teams that play in the Big Ten and Big East. How do you measure a team ripping through the soft ACC (like Miami) or the West Coast Conference (Gonzaga) against a team like Michigan State, which lost last week to Indiana and Ohio State?\n\nHere's how we measure it this week:\n\n1. Indiana2. Michigan3. Duke4. Gonzaga5. Michigan St6. Georgetown7. Miami8. Kansas9. Florida10. Arizona11. Syracuse12. Kansas St13. Louisville14. Ohio St15. Oklahoma St16. New Mexico17. Wisconsin18.
