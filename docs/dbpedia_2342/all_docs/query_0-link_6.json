        "text": "Men's Basketball 4/29/2011 4:35:00 PM None\n\n2010-11 Men's Basketball Recap\n\nCreighton Bluejays (23-16, 10-8 MVC) Year-End Recap For 2010-11\n\nThe 2010-11 season will be remembered as a year of near-misses in coach Greg McDermott's first year on the Creighton sideline, but also one in which the fan base was rejuvenated by an influx of players and coaches who helped continue one of the most successful runs in MVC history.\n\nMcDermott won 23 games, most ever by a first-year coach at Creighton, but six losses by three points or less left one to wonder what could have been had the ball bounced the Jays way on a few more occasions.\n\nAfter a four-year run at Iowa State, McDermott was hired in April of 2010 with the tough task of replacing Dana Altman, who accepted a similar job at Oregon. Little did both men know that their paths would cross again to end the first season on the job for both.\n\nUpon his hiring, McDermott announced that his son, Doug McDermott, had been released from his signed letter-of-intent at Northern Iowa and would be coming to Creighton. The proclamation received only modest attention at the time, but when all was said and done Doug McDermott had one of the best debut seasons in Missouri Valley Conference history as he became the first freshman in 59 years to earn first-team all-Valley honors.\n\nCreighton opened the year with a three-game homestand, including two games in the Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge. Creighton dispatched Alabama State in coach McDermott's regular-season debut on the Bluejay bench on Nov. 12th, scored the final four points to beat Northern Arizona on Nov. 14th, and topped Louisiana on Nov. 17th, to start 3-0.\n\nThat led Creighton into a Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge title tilt vs. coach McDermott's former school, Iowa State, in Des Moines. Both teams scored at will, shooting more than 50 percent from the field and three-point arc, while owning less than 10 turnovers each. Creighton trailed by five in the final 20 seconds, but tied it with 1.6 seconds left on two free throws by Antoine Young. ISU big man Jamie Vanderbeken would then catch the inbounds pass, take two dribbles and drain a 35-foot three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Cyclones the win. Officials called the shot good, and without a courtside television monitor to confirm, left the court to end the game. It wasn't until minutes later that photographs surfaced that showed the shot should not have counted since time expired with the ball still in Vanderbeken's hand.\n\nAfter a win over Kennesaw State, Creighton suffered its only three-game losing streak of the season. Creighton lost at Northwestern before dropping a home game against No. 21 BYU despite holding eventual National Player of the Year Jimmer Fredette to a season-low 13 points. Creighton's losing streak was extended when Nebraska overcame an eight-point halftime deficit to topple the Jays, 59-54, in Lincoln. Creighton's Kenny Lawson Jr. had a three-point shot to tie it in the final 10 seconds that was off the mark, and Nebraska scored the final points on a lay-up in the last second after the Jays crashed the boards with all five men.\n\nCreighton answered the three-game losing streak with a season-best six-game winning streak. Lawson's monster game of 30 points and 18 rebounds helped lead the Jays to a 82-75 win over Saint Joseph's, which also included 22 points off the bench from a red-hot Ethan Wragge.\n\nThe December 18th win over Idaho State featured the highly-anticipated debut of sophomore center Gregory Echenique. A transfer from Rutgers, Echenique had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocked shots after becoming eligible the day after the first semester ended on the Creighton campus. Creighton then beat Western Illinois and Samford to enter Missouri Valley Conference play with an 8-4 mark.\n\nCreighton entered league play on the road with a 64-53 win at Illinois State before returning home to post a 16-point triumph over Drake. Creighton then dropped a rare home game with a 67-55 loss to Missouri State, the eventual regular-season champ in the MVC.\n\nThe Jays then took the road to pick up an overtime win at Southern Illinois, followed by a five-point win at Evansville, to stand at 4-1 in league play. CU dropped to 4-2 in league play with a home loss to Wichita State on Jan. 12th, the Shockers first win in Omaha since 1992.\n\nCreighton went on the road at Indiana State on Jan. 16th and suffered a loss at the buzzer. With the score tied and time winding down, Creighton forced a contested airball by Jake Odum as time wound down, only to have Carl Richard follow Odum's miss with an over-the-shoulder tip-in that beat the buzzer, and the Jays, 61-59.\n\nCreighton returned home to beat Bradley before another heart-breaking road loss. The Jays led Missouri State nearly wire-to-wire, only to miss some late free throws and allow a game-deciding lay-up to league Player of the Year Kyle Weems with 14.2 seconds left. Creighton would turn the ball over on its ensuing possession, losing 67-66 in an intense JQH Arena environment.\n\nFour days after the MSU loss, Creighton went to the old stomping ground of coach McDermott, and the school that his son Doug had signed with, Northern Iowa. A nationally-televised audience saw Creighton hang with UNI, but lost to the hot-shooting Panthers by five in another tight road setback.\n\nCreighton returned home on Jan. 29 to avenge its road loss to Indiana State, only to sputter away from home with a loss to a last-place Bradley team. Just hours before the scheduled 7 pm tipoff, the start time was moved up to 3 pm due to a blizzard that shut down the city of Peoria. Fewer than 800 fans were in the facility by tip-off for the rare Tuesday afternoon start.\n\nOnce again Creighton responded from a tough road loss with a home win, this time beating Evansville. However, the road frustrations continued, as Drake edged Creighton 67-64 when Young's game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.\n\nCreighton came back home to beat Southern Illinois and Illinois State, only to lose at Akron in a non-televised BracketBusters game. Creighton returned to league play with a game at Wichita State. With the score tied late, WSU's Aaron Ellis hit a lay-up with 1.5 seconds left to hand CU another frustrating road loss, 67-65.\n\nCreighton closed the regular-season with an eight-point win over Northern Iowa. That win secured a 15th straight season of 10 or more league wins as well as a 14th straight finish of fourth place or better in Valley play.\n\nCreighton's reward for its Senior Day win over Northern Iowa was a rematch with the Panthers six days later. Creighton topped the Panthers, 60-57 in St. Louis, after UNI star Kwadzo Ahelegbe missed a last-second three-pointer that could have sent the contest to overtime.\n\nCreighton's tournament title quest ended in the semifinal round against top-seeded Missouri State, 60-50. The Jays led 30-25 at the half before a stifling MSU defense controlled the second stanza.\n\nCreighton accepted a bid to the College Basketball Invitational, a 16-team tournament in its fourth year of existence.\n\nCreighton fell behind 16-7 in the opening minutes of its first-round game vs. San Jose State, but eventually came back to post an 85-74 win over the Spartans. The second round was an offensive display for the ages, with the Jays eliminating Davidson, 102-92 in the highest-scoring game in CBI history.\n\nThe Davidson win pushed Creighton into the semifinals, where it took on UCF. The Knights, which faced major travel issues and arrived just four hours prior to tip-off, were lethargic from the get-go and Creighton cruised to an 82-64 win to reach the unique best-of-3 championship series format.\n\nCreighton's opponent in the finals was Oregon, coached by Altman. A CBI record crowd of 12,381 turned out to see Creighton claim an 84-76 win over the Ducks and put CU just one win away from a postseason title.\n\nThe series shifted to Eugene for the second game, where Oregon dominated in a 71-58 contest that tied the series at 1-1.\n\nThe third game, also played in Eugene, was everything a title game should be. The teams exchanged 14 leads and 10 ties, and the score was tied in the final 25 seconds.\n\nWith the shot clock off, Creighton intended to hold the ball for a final shot. But not long after an inbounds pass to Young, the junior point guard would step back over a nearly-invisible half-court line that gave Oregon the ball back with 17.2 seconds left. E.J. Singler would make the game-winning hoop with 2.0 seconds left, giving the Ducks the title in yet another excruciating road defeat for Creighton.\n\nCreighton finished the season 23-16 overall, including a school-record four postseason victories. Doug McDermott led the Jays with averages of 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. In addition to his all-MVC first-team accolades, McDermott also swept the Valley Freshman and Newcomer of the Year Awards and became the top-scoring freshman in league history.\n\nYoung was a second-team all-MVC pick and averaged 13.1 points and league-high 5.0 assists per game while also winning his second straight MVC assist/turnover ratio title.\n\nDespite missing the first nine games of the season, Echenique still wound up leading the MVC in both blocked shots (55) and field goal percentage (.609). He was named to the MVC's All-Defensive Team and All-Newcomer Team at season's end.\n\nJoining McDermott on the Valley's All-Freshman Team was guard Jahenns Manigat, who averaged 5.4 points per game and provided a constant lift with his energy.\n\nFive seniors (Lawson, Kaleb Korver, Wayne Runnels, Darryl Ashford and Casey Harriman) helped ease the transition to the new coaching staff and combined for 20.9 points and 14.3 rebounds per game.\n\nLooking ahead to 2011-12, Creighton will return five of its top six scorers, and also its rebound, assist, steal and block shot leaders.\n\nRadio Broadcast Information\n\nKXSP (“AM 590 - Omaha's ESPN Radio”) broadcasted all Creighton men's basketball games during the 2010-11 season. T. Scott Marr (play-by-play) and Nick Bahe (analyst) called most the action, with Kevin Sarver, Brody Deren and Jimmy Motz also serving as analyst occasionally. The audio was also webcast live at www.AM590espnradio.com.\n\nTelevision Broadcast Information\n\nCreighton had 28 games televised in 2010-11, matching a school record previously set in 2007-08. Creighton had eight games air on KMTV, seven on Fox Sports Net, five on HDNet, three on NET-1, two on ESPNU and one each on ESPN2, Mediacom and Big Ten Network.\n\nTravis Justice and Nick Bahe served as the KMTV broadcast team.\n\nVideo Webcast Information\n\nVideo webcasts were available for 24 of Creighton's games in 2010-11, including the exhibition contest vs. Northern State.\n\nThirteen of the games were part of the Jays Video subscription package, 10 were free to everyone as an ESPN Full Court, ESPN2 or NET Sports webcast, and one was available by subscribing to Evansville's webcast package.\n\nLive Stats Information\n\nAll of Creighton's games this season had free live stats, the first year Creighton teamed with Stat Broadcast Systems after nearly 10 years with CSTV's Gametracker software.\n\nHome games could also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nUpdates were also provided on the athletic department's Twitter page (@gocreighton).\n\nSummarizing Creighton\n\nCreighton earned the program's 12th 20-win season in the past 13 years, finishing 23-16 on the season. The Jays tied for fourth in the Missouri Valley Conference with a 10-8 league mark.\n\nCreighton also played six postseason games, going 4-2 to finish second in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI).\n\nFreshman Doug McDermott, son of first-year head coach Greg McDermott, led Creighton in scoring (14.9 ppg.) and in rebounding (7.2 rpg.). He was in double-figures in 32 of 39 games and paced the MVC with nine double-doubles. He was the first MVC freshman to be named first-team all-MVC since 1951-52, and also became the top scoring freshman in league history.\n\nSecond on the team in scoring was junior point guard Antoine Young. Young averaged 13.1 points per game and leads the MVC in assists (195), assists per game (5.0), assist/turnover ratio (2.38) and minutes (1,393). He was named second-team all-MVC.\n\nGiving the Jays a big tandem inside was sophomore Gregory Echenique (10.5 ppg., 5.8 rpg., 1.8 bpg.) and senior Kenny Lawson Jr. (9.2 ppg., 5.5 rpg.). Lawson was voted preseason MVC Player of the Year and had paced the league in blocked shots each of the previous two seasons, while Echenique led the league in rejections this season. Echenique also topped the league in field goal percentage (.609).\n\nCreighton owned an impressive 568/470 assist/turnover ratio and made almost as many free throws (534) than the opposition has attempted (581).\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) was in his first season as head coach at Creighton, but no stranger to coaching in the state of Nebraska or in the Missouri Valley Conference. McDermott was hired last April after spending the previous four seasons as head coach at Iowa State (2006-10). He has also been a head coach at Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nMcDermott owns a head coaching record of 303-211 in 17 seasons, a 172-147 mark in 10 Division I years and a 23-16 mark after his first year at Creighton.\n\nHe was assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Steve Merfeld.\n\n20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton's March 15 win over San Jose State gave the Bluejays 20 or more wins for the 12th time in the last 13 years, an unprecedented feat in Missouri Valley Conference history that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nMost 20+ Win Seasons, Last 13 Years\n\nSeasons School\n\n13 Duke\n\n13 Florida\n\n13 Gonzaga\n\n13 Kansas\n\n13 Syracuse\n\n12 Creighton\n\n12 Kent State\n\n12 Kentucky\n\n12 Texas\n\n12 Utah State\n\n12 Xavier\n\nPostseason x 14\n\nCreighton made the postseason for the 14th consecutive season, the longest streak of postseason bids in MVC history.\n\nThe only nine schools to make the postseason in each of the last 14 years are Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State, Oklahoma State and Syracuse.\n\nPostseason History\n\nCreighton is a combined 21-32 in the postseason all-time. The Bluejays have gone 9-17 in 16 NCAA Tournaments, 5-10 in 10 National Invitation Tournaments, 1-2 in two National Catholic Invitational Tournament appearances and 2-1 all-time after their first CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament appearance. Creighton went 4-2 in its first appearance in the CBI.\n\nLast year marked the first time in school history that Creighton won consecutive postseason games, a mind-boggling fact for a program that has now made 30 all-time postseason appearances.\n\nThis season's four postseason wins were the most in school history for one year.\n\nAgainst Postseason Opponents\n\nCreighton went 11-12 against teams that made the postseason this season. That included a 2-3 mark vs. NCAA Tournament qualifiers (wins over Indiana State and Alabama State), an 0-6 mark vs. NIT teams, a 6-2 mark vs. CBI qualifiers (two wins over Evansville, one win vs. Oregon, San Jose State, Davidson and UCF) and a 3-1 mark over CIT teams (two wins over Northern Iowa and one over Northern Arizona).\n\nCreighton's final 11 games came against teams that reached the postseason. The Jays were 6-5 in the 11 games of that run.\n\nApril At Last\n\nAided by a six-game run to the CBI championship round, Creighton played its final game of the season on April 1st. It was Creighton's first game ever played in the month of April.\n\nBefore this year, the latest game ever played in any Bluejay season was March 29, 1950, when the Jays played St. Francis (N.Y.) in the National Catholic Intercollegiate Tournament in Albany, N.Y.\n\nPostseason Victors\n\nCreighton has won eight postseason games in the last four years, including two in the NIT, two in the CIT and four in the CBI. On a national basis, Creighton's eight postseason wins since 2008 rank tied for 10th nationally.\n\nAmong teams without an NCAA victory in that group, Creighton's eight wins is tied for the most with Oregon State's eight.\n\nMost Postseason Wins, Last 4 Years\n\nWins School\n\n17 North Carolina\n\n12 Kansas\n\n11 Duke\n\n11 Michigan State\n\n11 Butler\n\n11 Connecticut\n\n10 VCU\n\n9 Kentucky\n\n9 Ohio State\n\n8 Creighton\n\n8 Dayton\n\n8 Florida\n\n8 Memphis\n\n8 Oregon State\n\n7 Baylor\n\n7 Bradley\n\n7 Syracuse\n\n7 Villanova\n\n7 West Virginia\n\n7 Xavier\n\nMost CBI/CIT/NIT Combined Wins, Last 4 Years\n\nWins School\n\n8 Creighton\n\n8 Oregon State\n\n7 Bradley\n\n7 Dayton\n\n6 Mississippi\n\n6 Tulsa\n\n6 Virginia Tech\n\n6 Wichita State\n\nPostseason Success\n\nCreighton's eight postseason wins in the past four years are easily the best in any four-year span in program history. The group from 2007-10 combined for four postseason wins to hold the previous mark.\n\nAgainst Former Coaches?\n\nCreighton is now 5-9 all-time when facing former head coaches. The Jays went 3-6 against Eddie Hickey (0-2 at Saint Louis, 3-4 at Marquette), and were 1-1 against Eddie Sutton when he was at Oklahoma State.\n\nCreighton went 1-2 against Dana Altman, who coached at Oregon this season.

In 2010, Missouri State won the CIT over Pacific.\n\nThis season, Creighton played for the CBI title, while Wichita State won the NIT.\n\nHome Sweet CBI Home\n\nHaving the home-court advantage during the CBI continues to be a tremendous edge.\n\nIn the four-year history of the event, home teams are a combined 48-19, including a 29-6 mark after the first round and a 16-1 record this year.\n\nHome Court Records, CBI, By Round\n\nYear Rd. 1 Rd. 2 Rd. 3 Finals Total\n\n2008 5-3 4-0 1-1 3-0 13-4\n\n2009 4-4 3-1 1-1 2-1 10-7\n\n2010 3-5 3-1 2-0 1-1 9-7\n\n2011 7-1 4-0 2-0 3-0 16-1\n\nTotals 19-13 14-2 6-2 9-2 48-19\n\nHistorical CBI Crowds\n\nThe CBI averaged more than 5,000 fans per game in both 2008 and 2009 before falling to an average of 2,570 per gate last season, with just one total crowd of more than 5,000.\n\nThis year's crowd rebounded to average 4,795 fans per game, including a CBI record crowd of 12,381 in Omaha on March 28 to see Creighton host Oregon.\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011\n\nLargest 1st round crowd 5,365 6.647 3,542 4,375\n\nSmallest 1st round crowd 1,169 1.045 665 989\n\nAverage 1st round crowd 3,813 2.833 1,712 2,414\n\nLargest quarterfinal crowd 6,460 8.812 4,235 5,913\n\nSmallest quarterfinal crowd 3,082 2.541 640 3,949\n\nAverage quarterfinal crowd 5,433 5,801 2,347 5,016\n\nLargest semifinal crowd 5,852 4.759 4,682 6,392\n\nSmallest semifinal crowd 5,339 2.363 3,352 6,157\n\nAverage semifinal crowd 5,596 3,561 4,017 6,275\n\nLargest finals crowd 9,014 12,000 5,612 12,381\n\nSmallest finals crowd 7,337 8,029 4,386 7,875\n\nAverage finals crowd 8,269 10,676 4,999 9,864\n\nAverage crowd (all rounds) 5,190 5,001 2,570 4,795\n\nMVC Teams In The CBI\n\nThough this was just the fourth year of the College Basketball Invitational, Creighton wasn't the first Missouri Valley Conference team in the field. The MVC owns an all-time record of 10-7 in the event.\n\nIn 2008 the MVC went 4-2 in the the CBI, as Bradley won its first three games before alternating losses and wins in a best-of-3 championship series loss to Tulsa.\n\nIn 2009, the MVC went 1-1 in the CBI. Wichita State defeated Buffalo before falling to Stanford.\n\nLast year the MVC went 0-1 in the CIT, as Indiana State fell at Saint Louis, 63-54.\n\nIn addition to Creighton's 4-2 mark in the CBI this year, Evansville went 1-1 and was eliminated by Boise State in the quarterfinal round.\n\nPostseason Features Last-Second Endings\n\nNine of Creighton's last 10 postseason runs have included a game that was decided in the final seconds, including this year's run.\n\nIn fact, Creighton's postseason openers in the past 10 years have had three games decided by one point (including a double-OT finish), two by two points, two by six points (including an OT finish) and three games by 11 points.\n\nIn 2011, Creighton and Oregon were tied with 25.4 seconds left. The Bluejays had the ball with the shot clock off. The ball was inbounded to Antoine Young, who took a few dribbles and stepped back over a barely visible half-court line for an over-and-back violation. Oregon took over with 17.2 seconds left, and E.J. Singler scored the game-winner with 2.0 seconds to go.\n\nIn 2009, Creighton rallied from a 14-point deficit and would hang on to beat Bowling Green, 73-71 in the first round of the NIT. The Jays needed a last-second defensive stand, as BGSU's Darryl Clements' game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark.\n\nThe following game, Creighton led Kentucky by one with 36 seconds left, only to miss two free throws and see UK All-American Jodie Meeks convert a three-point play. CU's Booker Woodfox, the nation's No. 2 three-point shooter, missed an open trey as time expired, and Creighton lost 65-63.\n\nIn 2008, Creighton rallied from a 12-point deficit in the final 3:07 to top Rhode Island, 73-72, in the first round of the NIT. Cavel Witter hit the game-winner with 3.2 seconds left to give CU its first lead of the game since 3-0.\n\nIn 2007, Creighton had the ball for a final shot in a tie game against Nevada in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Nate Funk's shot attempt missed, and a tip-in try was also not converted. The Jays would eventually lose 77-71 in overtime.\n\nIn second round of the 2006 NIT, Miami (Fla.) guard Guilermo Diaz drained a free throw with 2.6 seconds left to beat Creighton 53-52. A last-second shot attempt by Bluejay senior Johnny Mathies was knocked out of his hands.\n\nIn the 2005 NCAA Tourney, Nate Funk had his three-point try with seven seconds left blocked by Tyrone Sally, and Sally raced downcourt for a breakaway dunk with 2.4 seconds left to give West Virginia a 63-61 win. Funk's three-point try from the corner missed at the buzzer.\n\nIn 2004, Creighton fell 71-70 to Nebraska in the NIT. The Jays led nearly the entire second half before NU's go-ahead basket with 12 seconds left. Nate Funk's game-winning jumper from 18-feet away was blocked by Husker guard Jake Muhleisen.\n\nIn 2003 Creighton lost 79-73 to Central Michigan in the NCAA's. The Jays trailed 50-24 with 16:24 left but a furious rally got them within two points (72-70) with 1:20 left, only to turn it over the next three possessions.\n\nIn the 2002 NCAA's, Creighton beat #15 Florida, 83-82, in Chicago. Terrell Taylor hit a game-winning trey with 0.2 seconds left in double-overtime, his final three of 28 points after a scoreless first half.\n\nMcDermott In The Postseason\n\nCreighton coach Greg McDermott made his first postseason appearance at Creighton, and fourth overall as a Division I head coach if you include his time at Northern Iowa.\n\nMcDermott's Division I teams own a 4-5 record in four postseason appearances, including a 4-2 mark at Creighton.\n\nMcDermott's Division I Postseason Appearances\n\nYear Tourney Postseason W-L\n\n2003-04 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2004-05 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2005-06 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2010-11 (CU) CBI 4-2\n\nDoes The CBI Help?\n\nHas playing in the CBI served as a springboard for future success?\n\nOne needs to look no further than this season's Final Four darling, VCU, for proof. Last year VCU won the CBI, and this year the Rams won five NCAA Tournament games, defeating USC, Georgetown, Purdue, Florida State and Kansas.\n\nOf last year's CBI “Final Four”, VCU, Princeton and Boston all reached this year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nSix teams playing in this year's NCAA Tournament participated in last year's CBI.\n\n2010 CBI 2011 2011\n\nTeam W-L W-L Postseason?\n\nVCU 5-0 28-12 NCAA\n\nSaint Louis 3-2 12-19 --\n\nPrinceton 2-1 25-7 NCAA\n\nBoston 2-1 21-14 NCAA\n\nMorehead State 1-1 25-10 NCAA\n\nGreen Bay 1-1 14-18 --\n\nCharleston 1-1 26-11 NIT\n\nIUPUI 1-1 19-14 --\n\nOregon State 0-1 11-20 --\n\nHofstra 0-1 21-12 CBI\n\nEastern Kentucky 0-1 15-16 --\n\nAkron 0-1 23-13 NCAA\n\nColorado State 0-1 19-13 NIT\n\nDuquesne 0-1 19-13 CBI\n\nIndiana State 0-1 20-14 NCAA\n\nGeorge Washington 0-1 17-14 --\n\n2009 CBI 2010 2010\n\nTeam W-L W-L Postseason?\n\nOregon State 5-1 14-18 CBI\n\nUTEP 4-2 26-7 NCAA\n\nRichmond 2-1 26-9 NCAA\n\nStanford 2-1 14-18 --\n\nNortheastern 1-1 20-13 NIT\n\nVermont 1-1 25-10 NCAA\n\nWichita State 1-1 25-10 NIT\n\nCharleston 1-1 22-12 CBI\n\nBoise State 0-1 15-17 --\n\nHouston 0-1 19-16 NCAA\n\nTroy 0-1 20-13 NIT\n\nBuffalo 0-1 18-12 --\n\nGreen Bay 0-1 22-13 CBI\n\nSt. John's 0-1 17-16 NIT\n\nNevada 0-1 21-13 NIT\n\nWyoming 0-1 10-21 --\n\n2008 CBI 2009 2009\n\nTeam W-L W-L Postseason?\n\nTulsa 5-1 25-11 NIT\n\nBradley 4-2 21-15 CIT\n\nHouston 2-1 21-12 CBI\n\nVirginia 2-1 10-18 --\n\nUtah 1-1 24-10 NCAA\n\nValparaiso 1-1 15-17 --\n\nOhio 1-1 15-17 --\n\nOld Dominion 1-1 25-10 CIT\n\nRichmond 0-1 20-16 CBI\n\nRider 0-1 19-13 CIT\n\nBrown 0-1 9-19 --\n\nNevada 0-1 21-13 CBI\n\nCincinnati 0-1 18-14 --\n\nMiami (Ohio) 0-1 17-13 --\n\nWashington 0-1 26-9 NCAA\n\nUTEP 0-1 23-14 CBI\n\nOn The Road, Again\n\nCreighton ended the year with nine straight road losses since its last win in an enemy gym on Jan. 9 at Evansville. Those nine losses have been by a combined 45 points, and have seen the opponent score the go-ahead points in the last 15 seconds four times, as well as two other games where Creighton had a shot to tie in the final 15 seconds but missed a three-pointer.\n\nCreighton went 3-11 in true road games this season, and lost won a non-conference road game on Dec. 6, 2008, beating Saint Joseph's at The Palestra.\n\nDish Network\n\nCreighton assisted 110 or 164 field goals (67.1 percent) in the CBI.\n\nJahenns Manigat had a career-high with seven helpers on March 28th, while Antoine Young had his fourth straight game with eight or more assists in that same contest.\n\nYoung became the first Bluejay with four straight games of eight or more dimes since Ryan Sears from Jan. 8-19, 2000. Young's 195 assists this year were third-most in school history, and most by any Bluejay since Randy Eccker had 205 assists in 1976-77.\n\nMarch 28 was also the first time that Creighton had two players with seven or more assists in the same game since Feb. 10, 1991. In that game, Duan Cole had seven assists and Darin Plautz had eight assists.\n\n23 Wins\n\nCreighton finished with 23 wins in 2010-11, tied for fifth-most in school history for one season.\n\nW-L Season Head Coach\n\n29-5 2002-03 Altman\n\n27-8 2008-09 Altman\n\n24-8 1990-91 Barone\n\n24-8 2000-01 Altman\n\n23-5 1921-22 Kearney\n\n23-7 1973-74 Sutton\n\n23-9 2001-02 Altman\n\n23-10 1999-00 Altman\n\n23-11 2004-05 Altman\n\n23-16 2010-11 McDermott\n\nSchool Records Fall\n\nDue in part to the fact that Creighton played in more games than any other season before it, the Jays broke several long-standing school records.\n\nCreighton's 39 games played were a school record, four more than the previous high in 2008-09.\n\nCreighton's 22 home games was three more than the previous record set in 2008-09, and its 19 home wins exceeded the previous mark of 17 set in 2002-03.\n\nWith 2,684 points, Creighton broke the record of 2,668 points in a season set by the 2002-03 club. The 2,549 points allowed this season were also most ever, surpassing a mark of 2,524 points allowed by the 1965-66 squad.\n\nCreighton allowed 958 field goals, breaking the previous mark of 957 set in 1984-85. Creighton opponents also had 2,209 field goal attempts, smashing the previous high of 2,088, also in 1984-85.\n\nCreighton attempted 759 three-pointers, breaking the previous school-record of 748 set in 2007-08.\n\nCreighton allowed 239 three-pointers to the opposition, 20 more than the previous mark set in both 2006-07 and 2007-08. Creighton also allowed 691 three-point attempts, erasing the previous high of 614 in 2008-09.\n\nCreighton opponents had 490 assists, breaking the previous high of 479 in 1987-88.\n\n200 Or More Rebound Tandem, Again\n\nFor the second straight season, Creighton had two players with more than 200 or more rebounds. Last year it was Kenny Lawson Jr. (230) and Justin Carter (200), while this season it was Doug McDermott (280) and Lawson (215).\n\nBefore last season, the Jays hadn't had two men over 200 rebounds in the same season since 2006-07, when Anthony Tolliver (220) and Dane Watts (212) did so.\n\n500 Point Duo\n\nDoug McDermott led Creighton with 581 points, while Antoine Young had 511 points.\n\nCreighton hadn't had two men go over 500 points in the same season since the “Dynamic Duo” 20 years ago. In 1990-91, Chad Gallagher had 620 points, while Bob Harstad had 570 points.\n\nCombo Number Five\n\nThe College Basketball Invitational presented by Zebra Pen was the fourth different postseason event that Creighton has participated in during the last five years.\n\nIn 2007, Creighton played in the NCAA Tournament. Creighton was in the 2008 and 2009 NIT. Last year the team was in the CIT, and this year it's the CBI.\n\nOn a national basis, the only schools to be in all four tournaments in the past five years are Creighton and Austin Peay. However, Austin Peay has no fifth-year seniors that have been on the roster for each event, while Creighton has fifth-year seniors Kenny Lawson Jr. and Casey Harriman who can claim that.\n\nMcDermott Won 300th\n\nCreighton head coach Greg McDermott picked up his 300th career win with the March 15 victory over San Jose State. It also marked the eighth time in 17 seasons as a head coach that he's won 20 games in a year.\n\nMcDermott owns a career mark of 303-211, including 23-16 this year in his first season at Creighton.\n\nBig Mac's Attack\n\nGreg McDermott led Creighton to a 23-16 mark, the most wins by any first-year coach in school history. Tom Apke had the previous mark when he went 20-7 in 1974-75.\n\nMcDermott's 23 wins were more than the combined number of first-year wins by his two predecessors, Dana Altman (7 in 1994-95) and Rick Johnson (9 in 1991-92).\n\nNew Coaches Update\n\nGreg McDermott was one of 53 head coaches at a new school this winter. His 23 wins were fourth-most of that group.\n\nAmong his peers, the only other Valley coaches to win more than 20 games in their first year was Illinois State's Tim Jankovich (25 in 2007-08) and Indiana State's Greg Lansing (20 this season).\n\nBelow is a list of the new coaches with 20 or more wins this season.\n\nSchool Coach W-L Next Game\n\nUTEP Tim Floyd 25-10 --\n\nIona Tim Cluess 25-12 --\n\nColorado Tad Boyle 24-14 --\n\nCreighton Greg McDermott 23-16 --\n\nMarshall Tom Herrion 22-12 --\n\nClemson Brad Brownell 22-12 --\n\nBoise State Leon Rice 22-13 -\n\nUCF Donnie Jones 21-12 --\n\nNorthern Colorado B.J.

He finished first in the league in field goal percentage (.609) and blocked shots per game (1.8), fourth in offensive rebounds per game (2.2) and 10th with 5.8 rebounds per game.\n\nDoug vs. Greg\n\nDoug McDermott's 31 points and 10 rebounds vs. Davidson on March 21 moved him past his father, Bluejay head coach Greg McDermott, for family bragging rights in several areas.\n\nDoug's career-high 31 points was two more than Greg's career-best of 29 points (vs. Western Illinois on March 1, 1986) when he played at UNI.\n\nIt was also Doug's ninth career double-double, one more than the eight his father attained in four years at UNI.\n\nEarlier this year Doug had 17 rebounds at Bradley. Greg's career-high was 15 on Dec. 8, 1984 at Kansas State.\n\nQwest For 10,000\n\nCreighton has scored 10,089 points all-time at Qwest Center Omaha, surpassing 10,000 points in the building on March 23 after a basket by Kenny Lawson Jr. vs. UCF.\n\nCreighton has currently outscored the opposition 10,089-8,592 in 137 career games in the eight-year old facility.\n\nCreighton is now 9-1 all-time in games where it moves over any 1,000 point milestone, as seen below:\n\nDate Pts-Opp (QCO Game #) Who/How vs. Opp.\n\n02/18/04 1,000-787 (14) Lindeman FG vs. Indiana State\n\n02/05/05 2,000-1,696 (28) Funk FG vs. Missouri St.\n\n01/18/06 3,000-2,504 (41) Watts FT vs. Bradley\n\n01/09/07 4,000-3,359 (56) Tolliver FG vs. Drake\n\n12/17/07 5,000-4,174 (69) Korver 3FG vs. Hou.

Illinois\n\n03/23/11 10,000-8,500 (136) Lawson FG vs. UCF\n\nLittle Mac, Big Production\n\nDoug McDermott had a season-high 31 points in a March 21 win vs. Davidson, the most by a Bluejay freshman since Rodney Buford lit up Illinois State for 36 points on Feb. 5, 1996.\n\nThe 31 points were also the most by a Bluejay in any postseason game in school history, the most by a Bluejay in any game since Cavel Witter had 42 in a double-overtime game on March 1, 2008 vs. Bradley, and the most by a Bluejay in regulation since Nate Funk had 33 vs. Missouri State on March 3, 2007.\n\nMcDermott From Downtown\n\nDoug McDermott was just 15-for-53 (28.3 percent) from three-point range in the first 20 games of his Bluejay career, but he was a marksman in the 19 games since January 19th.\n\nIn that span, McDermott was 32-for-63 from downtown (50.8 percent). He hit at least one trey in 17 of those 19 games, and was 20-for-38 (52.6 percent) from deep in his last 11 games.\n\nMcDermott tied Kaleb Korver for the team lead with 47 three-point baskets and led the team with his 40.5 percent accuracy from long-range.\n\nForever Young\n\nAntoine Young had 22 points and nine assists in Creighton's win over Davidson on March 21 while finishing his second straight game without a turnover.\n\nCreighton had not had a player with 20 or more points and nine or more assists in the same game since Duan Cole had 21 points and nine assists vs. Notre Dame on Feb. 18, 1991.\n\nTo find a game with 20 or more points and 10 or more assists, you'd have to go all the way to Vernon Moore's 21 point, 12 assist performance vs. Southern Illinois on Jan. 17, 1985.\n\nYoung, with 16 points and 10 assists vs. UCF on March 23, had Creighton's first point-assist double-double since Tyler McKinney in 2002.\n\nPostseason Win Streak\n\nThanks to a win over San Jose State on March 15, the Creighton men's basketball team has now won a postseason game in a school-record four straight seasons. The previous mark was three in a row from 1962-64.\n\nThe following 10 teams are the only ones that have won a postseason game in four straight seasons, including this year: Creighton, Duke, Kansas, Kansas State, North Carolina, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, and Wisconsin.\n\nAmong The Best\n\nThe Missouri Valley Conference was 12-6 in the postseason this season, its most postseason wins in league history for one year.\n\nEvansville won one game in the CBI, Missouri State won one game in the NIT, Northern Iowa won one game in the CIT. Creighton had four wins in the CBI, while Wichita State had five wins in the NIT.\n\nNot Ready To Hang It Up\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. played with an increased urgency as his senior year wound down. The center from Oceanside, Calif., averaged 10.6 points and 5.4 rebounds in just 17.8 minutes per game in March/April.\n\nLawson shot 54.2 percent from the field, including 52.2 percent from three-point range and 81.8 percent at the line in those eight games.\n\nOn March 21 vs. Davidson, his three-point play in the final 15 seconds helped Creighton crack the century mark and moved him past baseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson for 18th on Creighton's all-time scoring list. He also moved past Elton Tuttle and Ryan Sears in his final game to wrap up his career 16th on Creighton's all-time scoring list.\n\n20-20-20 Vision\n\nDuring Creighton's March 21st 102-92 win over Davidson, Creighton had three men score more than 20 points in the same game for the first time since Jan. 21, 1998.\n\nOn that night, Doug Swenson (23), Ben Walker (20) and Rodney Buford (20) turned the trick vs. Missouri State.\n\nThis time around it was Doug McDermott (31), Antoine Young (22) and Josh Jones (21) that went for 20 or more points.\n\nPoints By The Bunch\n\nCreighton put up 102 points vs. Davidson on March 21, its most points since a 111-110 double-OT victory over Bradley on March 1, 2008.\n\nThe Jays hadn't gone over 100 points in regulation since a 110-73 win over Houston Baptist on Dec. 17, 2007.\n\nCreighton is now 43-2 all-time when scoring 100 or more points, and has won 16 straight games when scoring 100 or more since Feb. 26, 1977 vs. North Texas State.\n\nCreighton's 102 points were a CBI record, as were the 194 combined points between Creighton and Davidson.\n\nCreighton's 102 points were first time a Greg McDermott squad reached the century mark in a Division I game. His Wayne State team did so 15 times, most recently four times during the 1999-2000 season.\n\nAnd Allowing Nearly As Many\n\nCreighton's 92 points allowed to Davidson on March 21 were the most by a Bluejay opponent since Bradley had 110 in double-overtime on March 1, 2008, and most in regulation by a CU foe since Western Kentucky hung 95 on the Jays on Dec. 19, 2001.\n\nCreighton head coach Greg McDermott had never won a Division I game when allowing more than 90 points, entering March 21st with an 0-3 mark.\n\nNewcomers Lead The Way\n\nThree players making their postseason debuts, sophomore Gregory Echenique and freshmen Doug McDermott and Jahenns Manigat, led the way in Creighton's CBI-opening victory over San Jose State on March 15.\n\nEchenique had 18 points, his most in 25 games as a Bluejay, while also hauling down five rebounds and blocking two shots.\n\nMcDermott had team-high totals of 26 points and nine rebounds and tied a personal best with four three-point baskets. His 26 points were the most by a Bluejay in the postseason since Terrell Taylor's 28 vs. Florida in the 2002 NCAA Tournament, and the most ever by a Creighton freshman in a postseason contest.\n\nManigat had a season-high 17 points, and career-best five three-point baskets.\n\nEchenique and McDermott had Creighton's first 20 points after halftime as the team rallied from a 43-40 halftime deficit to take the lead for good.\n\nAgainst Davidson, Creighton's freshman class scored 34 points while its sophomores combined for 31 points.\n\nDuring the CBI, Creighton's freshman class scored 158 points, the sophomores 140, junior Antoine Young had 70 points, and the senior class owned 112 points.\n\nGame Tested, Part IV\n\nFifth-year senior Kenny Lawson Jr. played in 143 games as a Bluejay, more than any other player in school history. Below is a list of the all-time Creighton leaders in games played:\n\nGP Name Years\n\n143 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2006-11\n\n135 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n135 Kaleb Korver 2007-11\n\n130 Dane Watts 2004-08\n\nRewriting Qwest Center Omaha Records\n\nCreighton's 36 free throws made on March 21 vs. Davidson were a CBI and Qwest Center Omaha record.\n\nCU's 43 free throw attempts were a CBI record, and one shy of the Qwest Center Omaha mark.\n\nJosh Jones' 4-for-4 showing from three-point range tied the Qwest Center Omaha mark for a Creighton player for most attempts from long-range without a miss.\n\nClose Games This Year\n\nCreighton did not have a game decided by more than 19 points this season, the first time it could say that since 1939-40.\n\nThe last time Creighton had a season without a 20-point win was 1994-95. The last time the Jays had a season without a loss by 14 or more points was 2004-05.\n\nOn March 23rd, Creighton led 82-52 with three minutes to play until UCF closed the game with a 12-0 run to trim CU's final margin to 18.\n\nSix Out Of 13 Tourney Titles\n\nDespite its current four-year drought, Creighton still owns six league tournament titles in the last 13 years. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Duke (10), Gonzaga (10), Winthrop (9), Creighton (6), Kansas (6), Kentucky (6) and Utah State (6).\n\nCreighton's 10 Valley Tournament titles all-time are twice as many as the next closest school, Southern Illinois (5).\n\nAward Winning\n\nCreighton had quite the haul of conference awards this season.\n\nDoug McDermott was named MVC Freshman of the Year, MVC Newcomer of the Year, first-team all-MVC and also had spots on the all-Newcomer and all-Freshman teams. He was the first freshman to be named first-team all-Valley since Wichita State's Cleo Littleton in 1951-52.\n\nIn addition, Antoine Young was named second-team all-MVC and to the Most Improved Team, Jahenns Manigat was named all-Freshman and all-Bench, and Gregory Echenique was named to the All-Newcomer and All-Defensive squads.\n\nAll About The Bench\n\nIn Creighton's 23 wins, the bench scored 519 points (22.6 ppg.), but in the 16 losses it scored just 207 points total (12.9 ppg.), with a high of 23.\n\nCreighton was 20-3 this season when its bench scored 18 points or more, but just 3-13 when it scored 17 or fewer.\n\nCreighton's bench had a season-high 36 points vs. Davidson on March 21.\n\n10 Conference Wins x 15\n\nCreighton went 10-8 in MVC play this year to extend its streak of 10 or more conference wins to 15 straight years.\n\nOn a national basis, the only other current school with at least 15 straight years of 10 or more league wins is Kansas, which extended its streak to 17 earlier this season.\n\nConsistent Challengers\n\nCreighton has finished in fourth place or better in each of the last 14 years, with nine of those teams finishing first or second in The Valley's regular-season race. Two of the five that didn't won the MVC Tournament.\n\nThe Bluejays won the MVC in 2000-01 and tied for the title in 2001-02 and 2008-09. CU was second in the MVC in 1997-98 and 2006-07, tied for second in the MVC in 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2005-06, and finished tied for third in 2004-05. The 1999-00 club was fourth in the MVC, but won the MVC Tournament.\n\nCreighton's MVC Finishes, Last 14 Years\n\n1st Place 2000-01\n\nTied for First 2001-02 (won MVC Tourn.), 2008-09\n\n2nd Place 1997-98, 2002-03 (won MVC Tourn.), 2006-07 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\nTied for 2nd 1998-99 (won MVC Tourn.), 2003-04, 2005-06\n\nTied for 3rd Place 2004-05 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\n4th Place 1999-00 (won MVC Tourn.); 2007-08; 2009-10\n\nTied for 4th Place 2010-11\n\n“State” Games Give Jays Issues On Road\n\nCreighton played seven games away from home against teams with the word “State” in their name. They beat Illinois State by 11 points, but lost the other six games by a combined 18 points.\n\nCreighton lost to Iowa State by three at the buzzer (though photos later showed the game-winning shot was late), by two on a tip-in at the buzzer at Indiana State, by one at Missouri State on a lay-up with 14.2 seconds left, and by two at Wichita State on a lay-up with 1.5 seconds left.\n\nCreighton finished 1-6 in games decided by three points or less this season.\n\nI Am Iron Man\n\nAntoine Young logged all 40 minutes in Creighton's Nov. 28 game at Northwestern, and again on Jan. 26 at Northern Iowa and Feb. 1 at Bradley. He was the first Creighton player to play from tip to buzzer, without a rest, since Ryan Sears on March 15, 2001 vs. Iowa. Since then, Creighton had played 329 games.\n\nYoung finished second in the MVC with 35.7 minutes per game this season. Young's minutes per game average is the most by a Bluejay since Matt Petty averaged 39.1 minutes per game in 1992-93.\n\nYoung played in an MVC-high 1,393 minutes this season, second-most nationally behind Connecticut star Kemba Walker. That's the most by any MVC player since at least 1996-97. According to available records, that's easily the most by any player in Creighton history, as seen below:\n\nMost Minutes, Season\n\nMinutes Name Year\n\n1,393 Antoine Young 2010-11\n\n1,193 Benoit Benjamin 1984-85\n\n1,182 Rod Mason 1987-88\n\n1,169 Vernon Moore 1983-84\n\n1,164 Vernon Moore 1984-85\n\nYoung's Passing Fancy\n\nAntoine Young ranked seventh in the MVC in scoring with 13.1 points per game. His team, however, sometimes succeeded when he takes on a secondary scoring role. Creighton was 17-3 this season when Young took 11 field goal attempts or less.\n\nYoung, who also led the MVC with 5.0 assists per game, became the first Valley player to lead the MVC in assists per game and finish in the top-10 in scoring since MVC Player of the Year Curt Smith from Drake in 1992-93.\n\nYoung owned 511 points and 195 assists this year. It had been 25 years since Creighton had a player with 400 or more points and 150 or more assists, as Vernon Moore in 1984-85 (671 points/159 assists) was the last to do so.\n\nYoung became the first Creighton player with 500 points and 160 assists in a season.\n\nYoung's 195 assists this season were third-most in Creighton single-season history.\n\nSenior Class\n\nCreighton had five seniors, a group consisting of Darryl Ashford, Casey Harriman, Kaleb Korver, Kenny Lawson Jr. and Wayne Runnels. Over the past four years, Creighton went 90-51 with three 20-win seasons, eight postseason wins and four postseason appearances (two NIT's, one CIT, one CBI).\n\nThe five seniors were the most by Creighton in one year since 2001, when it had six men honored on Senior Day.\n\nAshford was in his second season at Creighton after transferring in from Jacksonville Junior College. He played in 72 games, including 34 starts, and had 418 points, 225 rebounds and 44 blocked shots.\n\nHarriman was in his fifth season at Creighton, including his redshirt season in 2006-07. Harriman had 336 points, 242 rebounds and 44 charges taken before undergoing season-ending labrum surgery on January 5th.\n\nKorver was in his fourth season at Creighton. The younger brother of MVC Hall of Famer Kyle Korver, Kaleb owned 419 points, 279 rebounds and 165 assists. He was a career 39.1 percent shooter from three-point range, making 116 of those attempts. He was recognized on the MVC Scholar-Athlete Team as a sophomore, junior and senior.\n\nLawson was in his fifth season at Creighton, including a medical redshirt season in 2006-07. Lawson's name is littered throughout the school record books, ranking first with 143 games played, third with 153 blocked shots, sixth with 762 rebounds and 16th with 1,313 career points. He was a second-team all-MVC pick a year ago.\n\nRunnels was in his second year at Creighton after transferring in from Northern Oklahoma-Enid. Runnels owned 262 points, 211 rebounds and 48 assists at Creighton.\n\nDouble-Double Doug\n\nDoug McDermott had 31 points and 10 rebounds vs. Davidson on March 21, his Valley-best ninth double-double of the season. McDermott's nine double-doubles were the most in one season by a Creighton player since Nate King had nine double-doubles in 1993-94.\n\nMcDermott's 280 rebounds were also the most by a Bluejay since Chad Gallagher's total of 280 in 1990-91.\n\nFather/Son Duo\n\nDoug McDermott is the only player in Creighton men's basketball history to play for his father, head coach Greg McDermott. The previous closest relationship between a player/coach had been when Rick Apke (1974-78) played for his older brother, head coach Tom Apke (1974-81).\n\nThe McDermott's were one of six father-son duos in college basketball this season. Other pairs include Bob and Brendan McKillop (Davidson), Ray McCallum Sr. and Ray McCallum Jr. (Detroit), Ernie Zeigler and Trey Zeigler (Central Michigan), Dave Boots and Jordan Boots (South Dakota), and Bruce Pearl and Steven Pearl (Tennessee).\n\nSites The Difference\n\nCreighton was 11-10 in its last 21 games. That included a perfect 10-0 mark at home, 1-1 at neutral sites, and an 0-9 road record in that same span. The 11 wins were by a combined 126 points, while the 10 losses were by a combined 55 points.\n\nMcDermott Chased History\n\nDoug McDermott had 581 points this season, most by a freshman in MVC history. Cleo Littleton of Wichita State held the league's previous freshman scoring record, notching 555 points in his first year with WSU in 1951-52. Littleton remains the only player in MVC history to earn first-team all-league honors in four-straight years.\n\nAccording to research by associate MVC commissioner Mike Kern, McDermott joined former Wichita State standouts Littleton and Cliff Levingston as the only freshmen in MVC history to have more than 400 points and 200 rebounds.\n\nWith 581 points this season, McDermott destroyed Creighton's freshman scoring record, passing Rodney Buford's 421 points in 1995-96.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that every MVC player to score more than 435 points as a freshman would go on to earn multiple first-team all-MVC accolades in their career.\n\nMVC -- Top Scoring Freshmen, 400+ Points\n\nName, School (Year) Pts.

His 18 points were the most by a Bluejay in their exhibition debut since Rodney Buford scored 24 points on Nov. 14, 1995 vs. Poznan (Poland).\n\nMcDermott was equally impressive on Nov. 12 vs. Alabama State, finishing with 16 points and seven rebounds on 7-of-13 shooting. McDermott's 16 points and seven rebounds made him the first Bluejay freshman since at least 1973 to have 15 or more points and five or more rebounds in the season-opener.\n\nMcDermott's 581 points this season were most in Creighton history by a newcomer. Paul Silas, with 551 in 1961-62, had the previous record. That was Silas' sophomore season since freshmen were ineligible for varsity competition then.\n\nYoung Follows His Elders\n\nJunior point guard Antoine Young has 349 assists in his career, eighth-most in school history. Young has played in seven postseason victories during the past three years, more than the combined totals of predecessors Josh Dotzler, Tyler McKinney and Ryan Sears.

Titles 0 1 3 2\n\nPostseason Wins 7 3 1 1\n\nSweet 16\n\nDoug McDermott had 16 rebounds against Akron, the second time this season he had 16 or more boards in a game (he also had 17 at Bradley).\n\nThat made McDermott the first Bluejay since Bob Harstad in 1990-91 to have multiple games of 16 or more rebounds in the same season.\n\nMaking the feat all the more impressive is that prior to this year Creighton had not had a player grab 16+ rebounds in any game since 1995.\n\nStraight Shooter\n\nJosh Jones had a (then) career-best 15 points on Feb. 16 vs. Illinois State thanks to 6-for-6 shooting from the field. That was the most hoops by a Bluejay without a miss since Kenny Lawson Jr. went 7-for-7 on March 1, 2008 in a 111-110 double-overtime victory over Bradley.\n\nJones had owned 13 previous career games with six or more shot attempts, but had at least two misses in each of those contests.\n\nThe Wing's The Thing\n\nCreighton won eight of its last 13 games, and the play of wings Jahenns Manigat and Josh Jones was a key reason why.\n\nIn the last 13 games, Manigat and Jones averaged a combined 15.8 points per game on 69-of-130 shooting from the field (53.1 percent), 39-of-83 shooting from downtown (47.0 percent) and 29-of-41 at the line (70.7 percent) to go with a 51/31 assist/turnover ratio.\n\nCreighton was 11-3 when either Jones or Manigat scored in double-digits.\n\nCreighton was also 11-3 when Manigat and Jones combined for 13 points or more and 10-0 when Manigat, Jones and fellow wing Darryl Ashford combine for 20 or more points.\n\nManigat had a career-high 17 points in the first round of the CBI, while Jones had a career-best 21 points in the CBI quarterfinals.\n\nForeign Aid\n\nCreighton has had just seven foreign players in its history, but two of them played a big role in Creighton's 69-50 win over Southern Illinois on Feb. 13.\n\nJahenns Manigat (Canada) had a career-high 14 points, while Gregory Echenique (Venezuela) had his first double-double as a Bluejay with 12 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nIt was the 75th game in Bluejay history in which two foreign players saw action in the same game, but first time that both would score in double-figures.\n\nOther previous simultaneous foreign tandems include Livan Pyfrom (Bahamas) and Nerijus Karlikanovas (Lithuania) in 1999-2000, as well as Brice Nengsu (Cameroon) and Manny Gakou (France) from 2005-07.\n\nHe's The Manigat\n\nFreshman Jahenns Manigat started 16 of Creighton's last 17 games and showed no signs of hitting the proverbial 'freshman wall'. In those 16 starts, Manigat made 48.1 percent of his shots from the floor and averaged 7.7 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.1 steals per game. Creighton went 10-6 in those starts.\n\nFreshman Sensation\n\nWith seven MVC Newcomer of the Week honors to his name, Creighton freshman Doug McDermott was a slam-dunk candidate to capture MVC Freshman of the Year accolades. McDermott averaged 14.9 points, 7.2 rebounds per game.\n\nAccording to MVC associate commissioner for communications Mike Kern, McDermott became the first freshman to be named first-team all-conference since Cleo Littleton of Wichita State in 1952. Littleton likely is the only freshman to make first-team all-league all four seasons.\n\nRodney Buford of Creighton was the last player in league history to earn all-league honors four straight years -- he was a second-teamer as a freshman, then a first teamer his last three years. The freshman of the year award has been around since 1986 and no winner of the award has ever made first-team All-MVC.\n\nDouble-Digits For Doug\n\nAccording to STATS Inc., Creighton freshman Doug McDermott was the nation's only freshman to open the 2010-11 season by scoring in double-figures in each of his team's first eight games.\n\nAdditionally, McDermott was among the national freshmen leaders in double-figure scoring games and double-doubles, as seen below:\n\nDouble-Figure Scoring Games, Freshmen\n\nSource: STATS Inc.\n\nStreak Name, School Next Game\n\n35 Brandon Knight, Kentucky --\n\n34 J.J.

SIU's Mamadou Seck (13) was next in that category.\n\nNot surprisingly then, Doug McDermott was far ahead in the number of league games with 15 or more points and seven or more rebounds, with 11. Next up with five such contests was Warren, Seck and Kyle Weems with five.\n\nMost MVC Games, 15+ Points\n\n15+ Pt.

His seven blocks at Missouri State were the most by a Jay since Kenny Lawson Jr. at Evansville on Jan. 3, 2010.\n\nNearing The Top Five\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. ranks sixth in Creighton history with 762 career rebounds.

No other school in the history of the MVC has ever done so even once.\n\nIn 2009-10, Creighton averaged 14,495 fans per game, which ranked 15th nationally. Creighton averaged 15,883 in 15 games at Qwest Center Omaha (which would have ranked 10th) before two CIT crowds below 5,000 at the Omaha Civic Auditorium dropped the average precipitously.\n\nThis year the team ranked 14th at the end of the regular-season with an average of 15,026 before the CBI has brought down the crowds.\n\nCreighton had finished in the top-15 of the national attendance leaders in each of the previous four seasons.\n\n2010-11 Attendance Leaders (Final)\n\nRk.

It's worth noting that before this season, Creighton's last player with 10 or more rebounds in a half was Brody Deren (11) at Bradley on Jan. 5, 2004.\n\nMcDermott would finish with 17 rebounds for the game, most by a Bluejay freshman since Bob Harstad pulled down 17 rebounds at Southern Illinois on Jan. 28, 1988.\n\nBelow is the most rebounds in any half by a Bluejay individual this year.\n\nPts.

Winn calls them “the most surprising father-son combination in Division I”. The story can be found on-line at http://tinyurl.com/si-mcd-story.\n\nDishing Dimes\n\nJunior point guard Antoine Young had a career-high with nine assists on Jan. 16 at Indiana State, then surpassed that with 10 helpers in the Jan. 19 win over Bradley.\n\nYoung became Creighton's first player with consecutive games of nine or more assists since Edward St. Fleur had nine in games on both Jan. 16 and Jan. 18, 1997.\n\nThe 10 dimes by Young on Jan. 19 matched a Qwest Center Omaha record by a Creighton player, and were the most by a Creighton player (regardless of site) since Josh Dotzler also had 10 assists on Dec. 9, 2007 vs. Saint Joseph's. Young had 10 helpers once again on March 23 vs. UCF.\n\nWhat's Your Twenty?\n\nCreighton has been .500 or better after 20 games in each of the last 16 seasons, including this season.\n\nCreighton -- First 20 Games, Last 16 Years\n\nYear First 20 W-L Final W-L Postseason\n\n2010-11 13-7 23-16 CBI\n\n2009-10 10-10 18-16 CIT\n\n2008-09 15-5 27-8 NIT\n\n2007-08 14-6 22-11 NIT\n\n2006-07 13-7 22-11 NCAA\n\n2005-06 15-5 20-10 NIT\n\n2004-05 13-7 23-11 NCAA\n\n2003-04 17-3 20-9 NIT\n\n2002-03 18-2 29-5 NCAA\n\n2001-02 14-6 23-9 NCAA\n\n2000-01 14-6 24-8 NCAA\n\n1999-00 14-6 23-10 NCAA\n\n1998-99 14-6 22-9 NCAA\n\n1997-98 14-6 18-10 NIT\n\n1996-97 10-10 15-15 ---\n\n1995-96 11-9 14-15 ---\n\nBuilding A Lead\n\nCreighton's 49-25 lead at halftime on Jan. 19 vs. Bradley was its largest halftime lead at Qwest Center Omaha since a 47-20 advantage over Nebraska on Nov. 24, 2007.\n\nCreighton's 49 points in the first half was its most at Qwest Center Omaha by intermission since Houston Baptist also had 49 on Dec. 17, 2007.\n\nTrèy's Bien\n\nCreighton had seven different players that drained at least four three-pointers in a game this year. That list includes Doug McDermott, Antoine Young, Kenny Lawson Jr., Kaleb Korver, Jahenns Manigat, Josh Jones and Ethan Wragge.\n\nIn addition, Darryl Ashford had a game with four three-pointers last season, while Casey Harriman owned five career games with three treys.\n\nNBA Jays\n\nKyle Korver and Anthony Tolliver give Creighton a pair of alums in the NBA for the third straight year.\n\nKorver plays for the Chicago Bulls and is in his eighth year in the NBA, including previous stops in Philadelphia and Utah.\n\nTolliver plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves and is in his third year in the NBA, including previous stops with Cleveland, San Antonio, New Orleans, Portland and Golden State.\n\nCreighton has now had an NBA player in 27 of the last 28 years, and 44 of 47 seasons since 1964-65.\n\nIn addition, Creighton alum Paul Silas is the head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nGoing Over .500, Again\n\nCreighton has been better than .500 in either the first or second-half of the league season in 31 straight trips through the league, including both halves this year.\n\nCreighton's 31 consecutive halves above .500 in league play is easily the Valley's longest active streak, far ahead of Wichita State (5), Indiana State (3), Missouri State (2), Evansville (1).\n\nHere's how Creighton's teams have fared in the various halves of the MVC season since 1995-96. Notably, this is the fourth straight season Creighton has been 5-4 at the midway point. In 2008-09 (as well as in 2000-01), Creighton went 9-0 in the second half of the Valley slate.\n\nYear 1st Half 2nd Half\n\n2010-11 5-4 5-4\n\n2009-10 5-4 5-4\n\n2008-09 5-4 9-0\n\n2007-08 5-4 5-4\n\n2006-07 6-3 7-2\n\n2005-06 7-2 5-4\n\n2004-05 5-4 6-3\n\n2003-04 7-2 5-4\n\n2002-03 8-1 7-2\n\n2001-02 8-1 6-3\n\n2000-01 5-4 9-0\n\n1999-00 5-4 6-3\n\n1998-99 6-3 5-4\n\n1997-98 5-4 7-2\n\n1996-97 5-4 5-4\n\n1995-96 4-5 5-4\n\nTotal 91-53 (.632) 97-47 (.674)\n\nArmy of Iowans\n\nEvery Creighton team since 1988-89 has had at least one Iowa native, and this season is no exception.\n\nCreighton has five players from Iowa on this season's team, continuing a long trend of relying on some of the Hawkeye State's top preps. CU's native Iowans this season include seniors Casey Harriman (Ida Grove) and Kaleb Korver (Pella) as well as redshirting sophomore Grant Gibbs (Marion) and freshmen Doug McDermott (Ames) and Will Artino (Waukee).\n\nOther past notable Iowans include Kyle Korver and Pierce Hibma (Pella), Ryan Sears (Ankeny), Brody Deren (Harlan), Tyler McKinney (Urbandale), Nate Funk (Sioux City) and Michael Lindeman (Iowa Falls).\n\nCreighton has played at least one Iowa native in 550 straight games. That streak dates to a Feb. 5, 1994 win against Wichita State.\n\nJays Earn 10 Home Wins, Again\n\nThe Jan. 19 win against Bradley was Creighton's 10th home victory this season. Creighton has now won 10 or more home games in 15 straight seasons.\n\nThe streak is a school-record, three more than the previous standard of 12 straight seasons from the 1969-70 season to the 1980-81 campaign with 10 or more home wins.\n\nCreighton To Visit San Diego State In 2011\n\nCreighton learned that it will visit San Diego State on Nov. 30, 2011 to open play in the third annual Mountain West Conference/Missouri Valley Conference Challenge Series.\n\nThe event pits teams in head-to-head format against each other. The Valley won the inaugural competition in 2009 by a 5-4 margin, before the MWC claimed an 8-1 victory in 2010.\n\nCreighton is 3-1 all-time against SDSU, though the teams have not met since 1974.\n\nHome Cooking\n\nCreighton is 58-14 at home all-time at Qwest Center Omaha in MVC games (.806) compared to a 34-38 (.472) road record in the MVC during that stretch.\n\nOnly six MVC visiting schools (DU, ILS, MSU, UNI, SIU and WSU) have ever won a game in the eight-year old Qwest Center Omaha. The other three Valley schools (BU, UE, INS) have an Omaha losing streak of 10 or longer.\n\nBelow is a look at Creighton's current home winning streaks over current league foes:\n\nOpponent CU Home Win Streak CU W-L at QCO\n\nBradley Won 13 8-0\n\nDrake Won 2 6-2\n\nEvansville Won 12 8-0\n\nIllinois State Won 1 5-3\n\nIndiana State Won 12 8-0\n\nMissouri State Lost 1 6-2\n\nNorthern Iowa Won 1 6-2\n\nSo. Illinois Won 4 4-4\n\nWichita State Lost 1 7-1\n\nRare Combo Sinks Jays\n\nCreighton lost at Northern Iowa on Jan. 26 despite shooting 50.0 percent from the field and owning a +11 edge on the glass.\n\nThe last time the Jays shot at least 50 percent from the field and were +10 on the glass in a loss was Jan. 12, 1985, when Nolan Richardson's Tulsa team topped Creighton by a near-identical 70-66 score. In that contest, Creighton shot 21-39 from the floor and won the battle of the boards, 48-36. CU had won its previous 42 games with a +10 glass edge and 50% shooting from the floor.\n\nTake things a step further, and you'll see that the loss on Jan. 26 was historic. It was the first time since the inception of the three-point shot (1986-87) that Creighton lost despite shooting 50 percent or better from both the floor and three-point arc, and also winning the boards by 10 or more. Creighton had been 9-0 previously when doing that, winning those games by an average of 27.0 points.\n\nLawson Was Up For Senior CLASS Award\n\nSenior center Kenny Lawson Jr. was one of 30 candidates nationwide for the Senior CLASS Award. The award – presented annually to the NCAA Division I Student-Athlete of the Year in 10 sports – focuses on the “Four C's” of classroom, character, community and competition. He did not make the list of the 10 finalists.\n\nAn acronym for Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School, the award was launched during the 2001-02 season to honor the attributes of college basketball seniors who remain committed to their university and pursue the many rewards that a senior season and complete college education brings.\n\nLawson is the one of two MVC men's athletes named this year (joining Bradley guard Dodie Dunson), but the fourth Creighton candidate since 2003. Kyle Korver was a finalist for the award in 2003, while Anthony Tolliver was a finalist in 2007. Both were also named Senior CLASS All-Americans. In addition, Dane Watts was a candidate in 2008 but did not advance to the final stage.\n\nCreighton, which also has Sam Schuett as a candidate for the women's award, is one of just five schools nationally (Creighton, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Lehigh and Duke) with a candidate on both the men's and women's side.\n\nThe 2011 men's candidate class includes three CoSIDA Academic All-Americans from a year ago, nine student-athletes on the preseason watch list for the John R. Wooden Award, 16 players with grade point averages of 3.0 and above and eight from teams ranked in the Associated Press preseason top 25. It also included 2010-11 Creighton opponents Dodie Dunson (Bradley), Jimmer Fredette (BYU) and Cameron Jones (Northern Arizona).\n\nCreighton Prep Alum Scores, Ends Drought\n\nTaylor Stormberg scored his first points as a Bluejay when his two free throws with 1:18 left closed the scoring on Jan. 12 vs. Wichita State.\n\nIncredibly for a hometown kid who attended a high school with as much athletic success as Creighton Prep, Stormberg's points marked the first by a former Junior Jay since Mark Johnson scored one point in a 98-77 win over West Texas State on Jan. 21, 1984.\n\nRare Comeback Against Jays\n\nCreighton had won 49 straight home games in which it had owned a lead of 10 or more at any point in the game, before blowing a 31-20 lead against Missouri State on Jan. 4th.\n\nIn fact, the 11-point rally matched the largest comeback in Qwest Center Omaha history by a visiting team, previously done by Drexel in 2007.\n\nCreighton had been 9-0 all-time in games at Qwest Center Omaha in contests that saw both teams claim double-digit leads previously.\n\nThe last time Creighton lost a lead came after leading by 12 or more points at home came on Super Bowl Sunday in 2002 (Feb. 3, 2002), when SIU overcame a 16-point first-half deficit (and 48-34 at half) to beat the Jays, 79-77, on two free throws by Kent Williams with 0.3 seconds left. Williams was an assistant on for Missouri State in 2010-11.\n\nDouble-Double Duo\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. had 14 points and 16 rebounds, while Doug McDermott had 28 points and 10 rebounds, as Creighton topped Drake on January 1.\n\nIt marked the first time Creighton had two double-doubles in the same game since Lawson (17/11) and Justin Carter (10/13) did so vs. Bradley on March 5, 2010 in the State Farm MVC Tournament.\n\nIronically, each of the previous two times Creighton had two men with a double-double in the same game, it had lost. The last Bluejay win with two double-doubles was Feb. 1, 1999, when Rodney Buford (11/11) and Doug Swenson (19/10) double-dipped at SIU.\n\nHarriman Opted For Surgery\n\nPlagued by a pair of partially torn labrums, among other maladies, senior forward Casey Harriman elected to have season-ending shoulder surgery on January 5th.\n\nHarriman made the decision on January 3rd, but was given once last chance to play. He played in the final minute of a 12-point home loss to Missouri State, receiving standing ovations both when he checked in, then again 19 seconds later when he checked out.\n\nHarriman played 13 minutes total in six games this season, finishing with two points and two rebounds. For his career, Harriman started 16 of 104 games played and finishes with 336 points, 242 rebounds and 44 charges taken.\n\nOn A Roll\n\nCreighton won a season-high six straight games from Dec. 11-Jan. 1. The Bluejays have now put together at least one five-game win streak in 13 of the last 14 seasons.\n\nSince 1988-89, the Bluejays have made the NCAA's, NIT or CBI all 16 times they've had a five-game winning streak in a season, but missed the NCAA/NIT/CBI all seven times they haven't.\n\nA Sketch on Ech\n\nGregory Echenique made an immediate impact for Creighton, as the Jays were 18-12 after he became eligible on December 17th.\n\nWith the big Venezuelan in the line-up, Creighton held the opposition to 64.7 points per game (compared to 67.7 per game before he became active) and outrebounded foes by +4.8 rebounds per game, compared to a +1.0 advantage before he arrived.\n\nOffensively, Creighton's field goal percentage jumped from 42.1 percent to 47.3 percent and its three-point percentage improved from 31.7 percent to 38.8 percent.\n\nThe Echenique Effect\n\nWhile the addition of Gregory Echenique's 10.5 points per game to the line-up has been a big boost, he's made a similar impact on the defensive end of the floor in the lane. Echenique blocked 55 shots, most in the MVC this year.\n\nImpact Player\n\nGregory Echenique scored 12 points in his Creighton debut on Dec. 18 vs. Idaho St., then added 16 more on Dec. 20 vs. Western Illinois.\n\nEchenique was just the third Creighton player in the last 15 years to start with 12 points or more in each of his first two games, joining Darryl Ashford (2009-10) and Edward St. Fleur (1995-96).\n\nQwest Center Records Fall\n\nCreighton set one Qwest Center Omaha record and tied another in its Dec. 22 home win over Samford.\n\nCreighton set a building record by outrebounding the Bulldogs 45-19. That mark was Creighton's largest margin since an identical +26 differential over Mississippi Valley State on Dec. 29, 2001 back when it played at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nCreighton also held Samford to a season-low 40 points, which tied the fewest points ever in a Qwest Center Omaha game. Alcorn State also had 40 on Nov. 15, 2004.\n\nDefensive Gem\n\nCreighton held Samford to just 40 points on December 22nd. That was the best defensive effort by the Bluejays since limiting Indiana State to 38 points in an MVC Tournament quarterfinal victory on March 2, 2007.\n\nCreighton, which held Jim Molinari's Western Illinois club to 47 points on Dec. 20, held consecutive opponents under 50 points for the first time since Dec. 3-6, 2003.\n\nThe 87 points allowed over those two games was the best stretch by Creighton in any set of back-to-back games since Dec. 5-9, 1958 (86).\n\nJosh Jones Provides Offensive Boost\n\nSophomore Josh Jones entered the Dec. 29 game at Illinois State mired in a 9-of-38 shooting slump to start the season, including 0-of-16 from three-point range.\n\nAgainst the Redbirds, Jones hit 2-of-3 shots from long-range, and he tied his season-high with six points. The Jays outscored ISU 15-10 in the 8:51 with Jones on the floor.\n\nAfter Dec. 29th, Jones shot 51.8 percent from the field (57-110), including 47.1 percent from downtown (33-70).\n\nCreighton is 22-8 over the past two seasons when Jones scores five or more points, but 13-22 when he plays and doesn't score five points or more.\n\nEchenique Debuts\n\nDec. 18 marked Creighton's first game with the services of Gregory Echenique, who was an ineligible transfer until Dec. 17. He became eligible at the end of Creighton's fall semester.\n\nEchenique, a 6'9”, 270-pound center, came to Creighton after spending three semesters at Rutgers from 2008-09. He averaged 9.2 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots per game in 39 contests with the Scarlet Knights, which included 37 starts and an average of 27.5 minutes per game.\n\nHe had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocked shots in 18 minutes vs. Idaho State in his Creighton debut. He followed that up with 16 points, four rebounds and four blocked shots in 21 minutes vs. Western Illinois. At the time, Echenique's four blocked shots on Dec. 20 were tied for the most in the MVC in any game this year by one player.\n\nHe owned the top two efforts this season in the MVC, with seven blocks at Missouri State (Jan. 22) after six at Indiana State (Jan. 16).\n\nRed-Hot Start\n\nCreighton made its first eight field goal attempts from the field to open its Dec. 18 win over Idaho State, with six of those shots coming from long-range. That helped Creighton build a 22-13 lead which it never surrendered.\n\nInterestingly, it was the second straight game that Creighton had a stretch of six straight three-point attempts that were all made, having done it on six straight possessions vs. Saint Joseph's.\n\nIn eight seasons of games at Qwest Center Omaha (137 games), Creighton's best had been 6-for-6 starts from the floor vs. High Point (Dec. 2, 2004) and Illinois State (Jan. 22, 2005).\n\nIn fact, this was just the seventh occasion all-time that Creighton had started as well as 4-for-4 from the field. Creighton started 5-for-5 vs. UCF on March 23, 2011 for its eighth 4-for-4 start, and 6-for-6 vs. Oregon on March 28, 2011 for its ninth 4-for-4 start or better.\n\nCreighton is 55-for-137 all-time in its first shot of the game at Qwest Center Omaha, including a 7-for-22 mark this winter.\n\nNo TV, No Problem\n\nCreighton is a perfect 45-0 in regular-season non-televised games at Qwest Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton has also won 27 straight non-televised home games at Qwest Center Omaha, dating to a March 20, 2006 loss to Miami (Fla.) in the NIT.\n\nPractice Pays Off\n\nAntoine Young is frequently the last player in the gym after practice, staying late to work on his shot. The dedication is clearly paying off.\n\nYoung entered this season a career 25.6 percent shooter from three-point range (23-90). This season, he shot 31.7 percent (39-123) from downtown.\n\nAt the line, Young entered the year as a 64.3 percent shooter (101-157). He was at 74.9 percent from the stripe (128-171) this year.\n\nYoung connected on a career-high four three-point attempts vs. Idaho State on Dec. 18. His 4-for-4 shooting from downtown was a Qwest Center Omaha record for three-point shots without a miss by a Bluejay, eclipsing previous 3-for-3 displays by Johnny Mathies, Pierce Hibma, Dane Watts and Booker Woodfox. Josh Jones tied that mark on March 21 vs. Davidson.\n\nLikewise, his 10-for-10 marksmanship from the line on Jan. 1 vs. Drake was a Qwest Center Omaha record for most free throws in a game without a miss.\n\nA Fan Of The A-10\n\nSophomore Ethan Wragge had a career-high of 22 points on Dec. 11 vs. Saint Joseph's, eclipsing his previous best of 21 that came last year in 17 minutes vs. fellow Atlantic-10 power Xavier.\n\nJust like the game against Xavier, Wragge had his points in fewer than 20 minutes of playing time. When he did it last season, he became the first CU player to score more than 20 points in less than 20 minutes since Vernon Moore put up 21 points in 19 minutes against Nebraska-Kearney on Nov. 24, 1984.\n\nIn three career games against the Atlantic-10 Conference, Wragge has scored 54 points (18.0 ppg.) in 48 minutes (16.0 mpg.) of play, connecting on 14-of-24 three-point attempts (58.3 percent) and 18-of-28 shots overall (64.3 percent).\n\nSolid Stretch\n\nEthan Wragge will be hard-pressed to have a better four-minute stretch than what he had on Dec. 11 in a win over Saint Joseph's.\n\nWragge drained consecutive three-pointers with 15:55, 15:10, 13:56, 13:06 and 12:26 left in the second half. He also assisted on a Kaleb Korver trey at the 13:29 mark, and took a charge with 13:13 remaining.\n\nShades Of The Dynamic Duo\n\nDoug McDermott's 20 points and 12 rebounds vs. No. 21 BYU on Dec. 1 were special numbers for any player, but even moreso considering he's just a freshman.\n\nCreighton had not had a freshman record a double-double since Bob Harstad had 18 points and 13 rebounds at No. 14 Bradley on March 9, 1988.\n\nThe last Bluejay freshman to have at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in the same game was Chad Gallagher, who had 20 points and 10 rebounds vs. Nebraska-Kearney on Jan. 20, 1988.\n\nMcDermott owned nine double-doubles this winter.\n\nMcDermott Chalks Up Four Straight Honors\n\nDoug McDermott was named MVC Newcomer of the Week for a fourth straight week on Dec. 6th.\n\nIn the 104-year history of the league, McDermott is the only basketball (men's or women's) player to win Player or Newcomer of the Week in four consecutive weeks.\n\nMcDermott's seven Newcomer of the Week honors (he also won it on Jan. 3, Jan. 24 and Jan. 31) thus far are the most ever for an entire season in league history. Bradley's Marcellus Sommerville won the award six times during his debut season in the league in 2003-04.\n\nLawson Named Player of the Week\n\nCreighton senior Kenny Lawson Jr. was named MVC Player of the Week on December 13 following his career-highs of 30 points and 18 rebounds in a win over Saint Joseph's. He played a career-high 34 minutes and also registered a season-best three blocked shots.\n\nThis was the first and only MVC Player of the Week honor of Lawson's career.\n\nLaying Down The Law\n\nKenny Lawson Jr.'s 30-point, 18-rebound game vs. Saint Joseph's on Dec. 11 kept the pages of the Bluejay record book busy.\n\nHis 18 rebounds were the most by a Bluejay since Bob Harstad had 20 rebounds on Jan. 23, 1989. Harstad, ironically, had his jersey retired at halftime and spoke to the team before its pre-game shootaround earlier that Saturday.\n\nHis 18 rebounds were also a Qwest Center Omaha record, three more than the previous mark set by Creighton's Justin Carter (vs. Kentucky) and by Akron's Romeo Travis (vs. Creighton).\n\nLawson's 30 points were the most by a Bluejay since P'Allen Stinnett had 30 points against New Mexico on Nov. 16, 2008.\n\nLawson was the first Bluejay with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in the same game since Rodney Buford had 30 points and 10 rebounds at Northern Iowa on Dec. 30, 1997. Doug McDermott had 31 points and 10 rebounds vs. Davidson on March 21.\n\nLawson was the first Bluejay with at least 30 points and 18 rebounds in the same game since Feb. 7, 1983, when Gregory Brandon had 32 points and 18 rebounds in a win over West Texas State.\n\nLawson is believed to be the first player in the MVC with a game of 30 points and 18 rebounds since Wichita State's Xavier McDaniel had 33 points and 22 rebounds on Feb. 23, 1985 against Bradley.\n\nFinally, Lawson had 14 points and 11 rebounds in the second half alone. The last Bluejay with a double-double in one half was Brody Deren, who had 12 points and 11 rebounds in the second half of a Jan. 5, 2004 win at Bradley.\n\nDoubling Up From The Start\n\nDoug McDermott scored 10 or more points in each of his first eight games this season. The last previous Creighton player to start a career with 10 or more points in each of the first eight games was Benoit Benjamin in 1982-83, who had also eight in a row to start his career.\n\nMcDermott was the first Bluejay (of any class) to score 10 or more in eight straight games to start the season since then-senior Rodney Buford in 1998-99 had 13 in a row.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's longest double-figure scoring streaks to start a season since 1979-80.\n\nConsecutive Double-Figure Scoring Games\n\nTo Start Year, Since 1979-80\n\nConsec. Name, Class Year\n\nall 32 Vernon Moore, Sr. 1984-85\n\n28 Benoit Benjamin, Jr. 1984-85\n\n27 Bob Harstad, Sr. 1990-91\n\n16 Rod Mason, Sr. 1987-88\n\n13 Rodney Buford, Sr. 1998-99\n\n12 Gary Swain, Sr. 1986-87\n\n10 Chad Gallagher, Sr. 1990-91\n\n9 Rodney Buford, So. 1996-97\n\n8 Benoit Benjamin, Fr. 1982-83\n\n8 Gregory Brandon, Sr. 1983-84\n\n8 Doug McDermott, Fr. 2010-11\n\nAll-Tournament Honors\n\nBoth Doug McDermott and Antoine Young were named to the All-Tournament Team of the Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge.\n\nMcDermott averaged a team-high 15.0 points per game in the event, shooting 54.5 percent from the field and 9-for-9 at the line. He also added six assist, a steal and a block.\n\nYoung averaged 13.8 points per game and added 16 assists and seven steals. He shot 44.1 percent from the floor, 50 percent from three-point range and 79.2 percent at the line.\n\nIowa State won the event with a 4-0 record, while Creighton finished 3-1.\n\nIowa State's Diante Garrett was named tournament MVP, while Melvin Ejim (Iowa State), Cameron Jones (Northern Arizona) and Spencer Dixon (Kennesaw State) were also honored on the squad with McDermott and Young.\n\nRare Freshman Start\n\nWith his start on Nov. 12, Doug McDermott became the first Creighton freshman to start the season-opener since Ryan Sears in 1997-98. Sears would go on to earn MVC Freshman of the Year honors, starting all 124 games of his Bluejay career and remains the MVC's all-time leader with 283 steals. Sears also dished a Creighton-record 570 career assists.\n\nHarstad Honored on Dec. 11\n\nAlready inducted into both the Creighton Athletics (2002) and Missouri Valley Conference (2008) Hall of Fame's, former Creighton men's basketball standout Bob Harstad was honored during the Dec. 11 game vs. Saint Joseph's.\n\nHarstad's jersey was retired during a halftime ceremony. The Loveland, Colo., native wore No. 30 during his career from 1987-91 with the Jays, but the number will still be available for current (such as Antoine Young) and future Bluejays to wear.\n\nThe only other previous players to have their jersey's retired in Creighton men's basketball history are Bob Portman (#33), Paul Silas (#35) and Bob Gibson (#45).\n\nHarstad is one of only four MVC players -- joining Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson, Indiana State's Larry Bird and Wichita State's Xavier McDaniel -- to score 2,000 points (2,110) and grab 1,000 or more rebounds (1,126).\n\nA first-team All-MVC choice from 1989 to 1991, he was named the Missouri Valley Conference's Player of the Year in 1990 and earned State Farm MVC Tournament Most Outstanding Player honors in 1991.\n\nHe led CU to regular-season titles and postseason tournament crowns in 1989 and 1991. He also powered the Jays to two NCAA Tournament appearances and a win over New Mexico State in the first round in 1991.\n\nActive Leader\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. leads all active Missouri Valley Conference players with 762 rebounds, 153 blocked shots and 107 games started. He also ranks 16th in Creighton history on the all-time scoring list:\n\nMost Points, Creighton History\n\nRk. Pts.

Lawson, who finished with 707, ranks second in Qwest Center Omaha scoring history. Nate Funk holds the facility record with 735 career points.\n\nLawson (406 rebounds) is atop the Qwest Center Omaha rebound list, finishing ahead of Dane Watts (351).\n\nLawson also owned 80 blocks in his career at Qwest Center Omaha. That's a facility record, seven more than the former mark held by Anthony Tolliver. The top shot blockers in Bluejay history (at all sites) are listed below:\n\nMost Blocked Shots, Creighton History\n\nBlk. Name Years\n\n411 Benoit Benjamin 1982-85\n\n183 Chad Gallagher 1987-91\n\n153 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2006-Pres.\n\n138 Brody Deren 2001-04\n\n136 Anthony Tolliver 2003-07\n\nQwest To Be The Best, 116 Times Over\n\nCreighton has played 137 regular and postseason contests at Qwest Center Omaha all-time in its eight seasons at the facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 116-21 (.847) record all-time at the facility, including a 27-2 figure on Wednesday's, a 6-0 mark on Thursday's and a 3-0 mark on Friday's.\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 10,089-8,592 in games at Qwest Center Omaha, an average margin of 10.9 points per game. The 21 losses have been by a combined 137 points (6.5 ppg.). Creighton has led wire-to-wire 29 different times, including four times this winter.\n\nCreighton's win on Nov. 17 vs. Louisiana was its 100th all-time at the facility, coming in just 118 games. By comparison, Creighton needed 138 games to reach 100 wins at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nCreighton is also a mind-boggling 19-12 at Qwest Center Omaha in games in which it trails by 10 or more points at any juncture.\n\nCreighton is 9-1 in Qwest Center Omaha games in which both teams own leads of 10 or more points, and 28-1 in games at Qwest Center Omaha in which there are no lead changes.\n\nBig Shoes To Fill\n\nCreighton's Greg McDermott replaced the school's all-time wins leader, Dana Altman, who was named head coach at Oregon in April. The winningest coach in school history, Altman was 327-176 in 16 years at Creighton, leading the program to seven NCAA Tournaments and 13 straight postseason bids.\n\nAltman's win total ranks third in Missouri Valley Conference history and he was named coach of the Missouri Valley Conference's All-Centennial Team in 2007.\n\nReturn Of The Mac\n\nGreg McDermott is the 10th MVC head coach to coach at two different league schools and first since Ken Hayes got hired away from Tulsa to go to New Mexico State in 1975.\n\nHe is the first to go to a different league and coach there, then come back to the MVC.\n\nMcDermott went 90-63 in five years at Northern Iowa from 2001-06, advancing to the NCAA Tournament each of his final three seasons.\n\nLong-Distance Streak Alive\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 574 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993. That's the longest active streak in the MVC.\n\nUNLV, Vanderbilt and Kentucky are the only three schools that have made at least one three-point basket since the rule was adopted prior to the 1986 campaign.\n\nQuick Starts Key To Playing in Postseason\n\nCreighton has started off 3-0 (or better) in 11 of the past 13 seasons, including this season. Each of Creighton's last 12 starts of 3-0 or better have been culminated in a postseason tournament appearance at the end of the year, including this year's CBI appearance\n\nJays Sweep Weekly Awards\n\nCreighton swept the weekly awards handed out by the Missouri Valley Conference on Nov. 15, as Antoine Young was named MVC Player of the Week and Doug McDermott named MVC Newcomer of the Week.\n\nYoung averaged 16.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.5 steals per game in wins over Alabama State and Northern Arizona. He opened the year with 21 points against ASU while also grabbing a career-high seven rebounds. He scored the first four points and assisted a three-pointer in the 11-0 second half run that gave Creighton the lead for good. On Nov. 14, he had 11 points, four rebounds, three steals and three assists in a win over NAU.\n\nMcDermott averaged 13.0 points and 4.5 rebounds in his first weekend of play. He began his career with 16 points and seven rebounds against Alabama State, becoming the first freshman to start the opener since 1997-98. He then had 10 points in Creighton's 74-70 win over Northern Arizona.\n\nMcDermott repeated his honors on Nov. 22 after averaging 14.0 points and 5.5 rebounds in two games.\n\nMcDermott won his third straight award on Nov. 29 after averaging 16.0 points and 4.5 rebounds per game vs. Kennesaw State and Northwestern, shooting 70 percent (14-20) from the floor.\n\nMcDermott made it 4-for-4 on Dec. 6th, earning the honor after averaging 15.0 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in losses to No. 21 BYU and Nebraska.\n\nForeign Invasion\n\nCreighton has a pair of foreigners on the roster for just the third time in school history with Canadian Jahenns Manigat and Venezuelan Gregory Echenique. Echenique is the nation's only returning Venezuelan who also played NCAA ball last season.\n\nThe last pair of simultaneous international teammates at Creighton was Brice Nengsu (Cameroon) and Manny"
