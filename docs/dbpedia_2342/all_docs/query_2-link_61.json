        "text": "Drew Metz Promoted to Assistant Coach; Brandon Hall Hired as Director of Men’s Basketball Operations\n\nPOUGHKEEPSIE, New York – Marist head men's basketball coach John Dunne has announced a promotion and addition on his coaching staff.\n\nDrew Metz has been promoted to assistant coach after serving as director of men's basketball operations last season. Brandon Hall will serve as the Red Foxes' new director of men's basketball operations.\n\n\"We're excited to promote Drew and bring Brandon onto our staff,\" Dunne said. \"Drew has an extremely strong work ethic. He's as organized as anyone who's ever worked for me, and he has a strong ability to get along with people. I believe he's going to help us keep elevating our program.\n\n\"Brandon is one of the toughest and most selfless players I've ever coached. He has leadership qualities that will help him have success in this business. His strong work ethic will serve him well in our director of operations position.\"\n\nMetz is entering his second season on Coach Dunne's staff at Marist after initially being hired as director of operations in June of 2021. He came to Marist after working the previous five years as an assistant coach at Long Island Lutheran High School and serving as program director and 17U coach of the New York Jayhawks AAU program.\n\nMetz is a two-time St. John's graduate (Bachelor's 2014, Master's 2016) who worked as a manager and administrative assistant for the Red Storm's men's basketball program from 2011-15 under head coach Steve Lavin.\n\n\"I am extremely grateful and excited for the opportunity that Coach Dunne has given me to continue to be part of his staff in a new role,\" Metz said. \"Coach Dunne has elevated the Marist program since his arrival and I'm fortunate to be a part of it. I am excited to continue to learn under Coach Dunne's leadership and work alongside my colleagues, Dalip Bhatia and Dorian Long, as we continue to help our student-athletes succeed on and off the court.\"\n\nHall played collegiately at Saint Peter's from 2008-12 while Dunne was the Peacocks' head coach. He appeared in 120 career games, was part of the Saint Peter's 2011 MAAC championship team, and served as team captain as a senior when he ranked ninth in the NCAA in KenPom steal percentage (4.91).\n\nHall led Colonia High School to a 17-10 record as head coach in the 2017-18 season. This included an appearance in the Greater Middlesex Conference (GMC) Tournament final and a trip to the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) North 2, Group III Tournament semifinal after an upset quarterfinal win over top-seeded Rahway. Hall served as a graduate assistant at Seton Hall of the Big East Conference from 2018-21 and helped the Pirates reach the 2019 NCAA Tournament. He most recently worked as an assistant coach at Fairleigh Dickinson in the 2021-22 season.\n\n\"I want to thank Coach Dunne for the opportunity to join his staff at Marist College,\" Hall said. \"Coach Dunne gave me a scholarship 14 years ago and one of my fondest memories of my entire career is winning a MAAC championship under his leadership in 2011. I am excited to continue to learn and develop as a coach, and look forward to getting to know our student-athletes while also helping them grow on a daily basis.\"\n\nDunne is entering his fifth season as head coach of the Red Foxes in the 2022-23 season. In addition to Metz and Hall, Dalip Bhatia is entering his fifth season as an assistant coach with the Red Foxes, and Dorian Long will be in his fifth season with the program and second as assistant coach."
