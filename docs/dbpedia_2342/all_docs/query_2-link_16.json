        "text": "There is life for Steve Lavin after St. John’s.\n\nThe former Red Storm coach will return to his West Coast roots, joining the Pac-12 Network as a studio and game basketball analyst, the network announced. He also will work with FOX Sports, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe 51-year-old Lavin, a San Francisco native, coached the Johnnies for five years, reaching two NCAA Tournaments, producing three 20-win seasons and an 81-55 record, before he parted ways with the Queens school in March with one year left on his contract. Despite his regular-season success, Lavin’s team’s struggled in the postseason, producing a 2-8 mark, and went a combined 6-13 in late March. Lavin produced two NBA draft picks, Maurice Harkless and Sir’Dominic Pointer. He was replaced by Red Storm legend Chris Mullin.\n\n“I have an inherent comfort level and familiarity with the Pac-12 Conference, having already spent 12 years coaching basketball at UCLA,” Lavin said in a statement. “That history makes returning to the Pac-12 as a broadcaster an ideal opportunity.\n\n“I’m eager for the college basketball season to begin and look forward to contributing as an analyst on the Pac-12 Networks’ coverage.”\n\nBefore coming to St. John’s, Lavin served as a college basketball analyst for ABC and ESPN from 2003-10 after a seven-year tenure as the head coach at UCLA, where he reached six NCAA Tournaments."
