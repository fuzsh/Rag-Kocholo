The Bluejays own wins over No. 9 Wisconsin, No. 12 Butler, No. 16 Butler, No. 22 Xavier, North Carolina State, Ole Miss, Buffalo, Akron, Nebraska, Arizona State, Seton Hall, St. John's, Providence, DePaul and Georgetown.\n\nKansas State transfer Marcus Foster (18.8 ppg.) leads the BIG EAST in scoring, and is averaging the most points by a Bluejay newcomer since Cyril Baptiste in 1969-70. He's scored 12 points or more in all but two games so far, and has already been named Paradise Jam MVP and a two-time BIG EAST Player of the Week.\n\nTwo Omaha products in the starting line-up are also doing big things. Vastly improved Khyri Thomas averages 12.0 points per game, and is second on the team in blocks, assists and rebounding, in addition to being a defensive stopper. Redshirt freshman big man Justin Patton averages 13.3 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. He's shooting 69.3 percent from the field (second nationally) and has 62 dunks already.\n\nScouting St. John's\n\nSt. John's is 13-16 on the season, including a home win over No. 13 Butler and a 33-point romp at Syracuse. The Red Storm are 7-9 in BIG EAST play and in a heated race to avoid the play-in round for seeds 7-10 during next week's tournament at Madison Square Garden.\n\nAll three double-figure scorers for St. John's are in their first year on the court for the Red Storm, a trio headed by freshmen Shamorie Ponds (17.3 ppg., 4.6 rpg., 3.2 apg., 2.0 spg.) and Marcus Lovett (16.9 ppg., 3.1 rpg., 3.9 apg.), as well as junior college transfer Bashir Ahmed (13.5 ppg., 5.5 rpg.).\n\nFederico Mussini (8.3 ppg.) and Malik Ellison (7.6 ppg.) lead the returners, while Tariq Owens (67 blocks) and Kassoum Yakwe (59 blocks) headline a frontcourt that leads the BIG EAST in blocked shots.\n\nSt. John's scores 77.6 points per game and have made 254 three-pointers to date.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his seventh season as head coach at Creighton. He is 163-79 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 443-274 in his 23rd season and is 312-210 in his 16th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Preston Murphy.\n\nChris Mullin (St. John's, 1998) owns a 21-40 record in his second season at St. John's, which also doubles as his career mark. The three-time BIG EAST Player of the Year and NBA Hall of Famer, who led St. John's to the 1985 Final Four, returned to his alma mater to replace of Steve Lavin. Mullin is assisted by Mitch Richmond, Matt Abdelmassih and Greg St. Jean.\n\nThe Series With St. John's\n\nCreighton and St. John's have split 14 all-time meetings, but the Bluejays are a perfect 5-0 against the Red Storm in Omaha.\n\nCreighton has won the last three meetings, all by double-figures, including an 85-72 wire-to-wire win in Queens earlier this year and a 100-59 victory in Omaha last year on Feb. 28 on CU's Senior Day.\n\nGreg McDermott is 5-2 against St. John's and 3-0 against Chris Mullin.\n\nDynamic Duo Duel\n\nBoth Creighton and St. John's feature a pair of newcomers leading the team in scoring.\n\nFor Creighton, Marcus Foster (18.8 ppg.) and Justin Patton (13.3 ppg.) have combined for 932 points, 262 rebounds, 48 steals and 46 blocked shots.\n\nFor St. John's, Shamorie Ponds (17.3 ppg.) and Marcus Lovett (16.9 ppg.) have combined for 942 points, 212 rebounds, 94 steals and nine blocked shots.\n\nFoster (Saturday at Villanova) and Ponds (Dec. 8 vs. Fordham) are the only BIG EAST players and among six players nationally with a game of at least 25 points, eight assists and six or more three-pointers this season.\n\nFoster At His Finest\n\nMarcus Foster had 25 points and eight assists on Saturday at Villanova, sinking 6-of-9 three-point tries.\n\nIn the process, Foster became the first Bluejay with at least eight assists in a game with six or more three-pointers since Duan Cole on Jan. 8, 1991 against Iowa State.\n\nFoster has averaged 25.3 points, 5.3 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game in CU's last four contests. In that time, he's made 50.7 percent of his shots from the floor, 51.9 percent from three-point range, and 75 percent at the line. He's also been durable, playing an average of 35.8 minutes in those contests.\n\nSenior Day Looms\n\nCreighton will honor three senior players following Tuesday's game, as Zach Hanson, Cole Huff and Isaiah Zierden will be recognized. Hanson is in his fourth year with the program, Huff in his third, and Zierden his fifth campaign.\n\nDuring the past five years, Creighton has gone 111-57. The team has been to the NCAA Tournament two times, winning a game each trip, in addition to last year's run to the NIT quarterfinals.\n\nCreighton is 5-0 with five double-digit victories against in-state rival Nebraska since Zierden arrived on campus, 6-3 in conference tournament play, and the trio have combined for 1,906 points, 757 rebounds and 199 assists in a collective 275 games and 101 starts in a Bluejay uniform.\n\nSenior Citizens\n\nBelow is a list of statistics by the Creighton players honored during Senior Day since 2003. Last year Geoffrey Groselle (22 points, 11 rebounds) became Creighton's first senior with a double-double on Senior Day since Randall Crutcher in 1997.\n\nName Pts. Reb. Ast. Stl.

Among those that may be within reach...\n\nMarcus Foster is currently tied for third in CenturyLink Center Omaha history with 103 three-pointers attempted in a season, three behind the mark shared by Booker Woodfox and Doug McDermott.\n\nJustin Patton has made 69.2 percent of his career field goals attempts at CenturyLink Center Omaha, second only to Geoffey Groselle's .706 (127-180) from 2012-16.\n\nJustin Patton has made 69.3 percent of his overall field goal attempts , trailing only Geoffrey Groselle's .702 (146-208) in 2015-16, among players with 200 or more attempts in a single-season.\n\nCole Huff has made 47.7 percent of his three-point attempts this season. That ranks fifth-best in school history, but within reach of Doug McDermott's 49.0 percent in 2012-13.\n\nTaking Care Of Business\n\nCreighton has won 98 straight home games against teams that enter with a record of .500 or worse. The last team to pull such an upset was Feb. 25, 2002, when Drake won at the Omaha Civic Auditorium on a Senior Day (though CU had no seniors that year).\n\nSt. John's enters Tuesday's match-up with an 13-16 record this season.\n\nMcDermott Chases 100 Home Wins\n\nGreg McDermott will enter Tuesday night's game vs. St. John's with a 99-24 home record as Creighton head coach, one shy of the century mark. All of those home games have come at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nIn Creighton history, only Dana Altman (199-46 at home) and Arthur A. Schabinger (108-30) at home) have previously reached 100 home wins.\n\nSchabinger coached at Creighton from 1922-35, when Creighton played its games at the Vinardi Center's \"Old Gym\" on campus.\n\nAltman was 102-28 at the Omaha Civic Auditorium and 97-18 at CenturyLink Center Omaha as CU head coach. Altman's Oregon team went 1-1 at CenturyLink Center Omaha in the 2015 NCAA Tournament was 0-1 in the 2011 CBI at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nIn Case Of A Tie\n\nCreighton can finish as high as third place in the BIG EAST standings, but could also drop several spots with losses in any of its final two regular-season games.\n\nIn the event of ties, here's how those will be broken according to the BIG EAST Tournament Manual tie-breaking procedures:\n\nTwo-Team Tie\n\n1. Regular-season head-to-head results.\n\n2. Each team's record vs. the team or group of tied teams occupying the highest position in the standings.

Teams are viewed as a \"mini-conference\" when comparing head-to-head results. The team with the best record vs. the other teams in the mini-conference gains the advantage. The team with the worst record vs. the other teams in the mini-conference is seeded the lowest.\n\na. If only two teams have the same best winning percentage in the mini-conference, the higher seed goes to the team winning the head-to-head series.\n\nb. If the two teams split their two games, then proceed to Step 2 under \"Two-Team ties\" (above). To seed the remaining team(s) in this mini-conference, proceed to (e) below.\n\nc. If three or more (but not all) teams have the same best winning percentage in the original mini-conference, then those tied teams create a new mini-conference and follow this same procedure beginning of Step 1 (Multiple Team Tie).\n\nd. If all teams in the mini-conference have the same mini-conference record, proceed to Step 2 below.\n\ne. After the top or bottom teams in a mini-conference are determined, the remaining teams are ranked by their record in the original mini-conference.\n\ni.

If the teams split two games, then proceed back to the two-way breaking procedure.\n\niii. If there are at least three teams remaining tied by their record in the mini-conference, they would then form a new mini-conference and follow the procedure again at the beginning of Step 1 (Multiple-Team Tie).\n\n2. Compare each team's record vs. the team or group of tied teams occupying the highest position in the standings. If an advantage is not determined, proceed to the next team or group of tied teams in the standings for comparison. Continue down through the standings until one or more teams gains an advantage. If two teams have the exact same advantage (i.e., having the same and better record against a compared team relative to their mini-conference), they are separated at that point by the two-way tiebreaker procedure. The next step would take you back to Step 1 (e) (Multiple-Team Tie).\n\n3. If more than two teams are still tied, a comparison of the tied teams Conference game only road records.\n\n4.

Once a team is eliminated from a multi-team comparison, it is dropped from further comparisons.\n\n5. Coin flip.\n\nAgainst The BIG EAST\n\nSince joining the BIG EAST in 2014, Creighton is unbeaten at home against St. John's, the only team it can say that for.\n\nGeorgetown remains the only place it hasn't won a visiting game in BIG EAST play, while DePaul is the only school where Creighton has not lost a road game.\n\nTeam CU Home Games CU Road Games\n\nButler 3-1 2-2\n\nDePaul 3-1 4-0\n\nGeorgetown 3-1 0-4\n\nMarquette 2-2 2-1\n\nProvidence 1-3 1-3\n\nSeton Hall 2-2 2-2\n\nSt. John's 3-0 2-2\n\nVillanova 1-3 1-3\n\nXavier 2-2 2-2\n\nTotal 20-15 16-19\n\nTop 25 Success\n\nCreighton has four wins over top-25 teams this season, more than any campaign in program history. Five previous teams had two top-25 victories in the same season.\n\nMost Top-25 Wins, Season\n\nWins Season Top-25 Victims\n\n4 2016-17 #9 Wisconsin, #12 Butler,\n\n#16 Butler, #22 Xavier\n\n2 1973-74 #6 Marquette, #16 Louisville\n\n2 2001-02 #15 Florida, #17 Western Kentucky\n\n2 2006-07 #11 Southern Illinois, #24 Xavier\n\n2 2013-14 #4 Villanova, #6 Villanova\n\n2 2015-16 #5 Xavier, #18 Butler\n\nFoster Takes Over BIG EAST Scoring Lead\n\nCreighton guard Marcus Foster has scored in double-figures each of the last 12 games and now leads the BIG EAST Conference with 18.8 points per game.\n\nThat puts him just ahead of Villanova's Josh Hart (18.6 ppg.) and Georgetown's Rodney Pryor (18.2 ppg.) for the league lead.\n\nIn conference-only action, Foster's 18.5 ppg. rank just ahead of Hart (18.0) and St. John's Shamorie Ponds (17.4 ppg.).\n\nShould Foster remain on top of the ledger, it'd be the fourth time in the last six seasons that a Creighton player has led his league in points per game (all games), as Doug McDermott did so in 2011-12 (MVC), 2012-13 (MVC) and 2013-14 (BIG EAST).\n\nNon-Conference Unbeatens\n\nOnly six teams in the country went unbeaten in non-conference play this year. That list includes Creighton (13-0), Villanova (13-0), Baylor (13-0), Gonzaga (12-0), UCLA (13-0) and USC (13-0).\n\nRoad Warriors\n\nCreighton is 10-3 away from home this winter (7-3 road, 3-0 neutral), outscoring foes by an average of 8.7 points per game. Creighton's victims in that time include Washington State, North Carolina State, Ole Miss, Nebraska, Arizona State, St. John's, Providence, No. 22 Xavier, No. 16 Butler and DePaul.\n\nPrior to a Jan. 25 loss at Georgetown, Creighton had last won its first eight games away from home in 1942-43.\n\nThis year also marked the first time that Creighton has won its first five true road games since the 1942-43 club won its first eight.\n\nEach of Creighton's last 11 NCAA Tournament teams have won 10 or more games away from home, and 10 of those teams had a winning record in true road contests.\n\nCreighton is shooting 44.6 percent from three-point range in road/neutral games this season while holding foes to 29.3 percent marksmanship from deep. In these games, Creighton's senior class is shooting a combined 51.8 percent (71-137) from three-point territory in those games.\n\nShooting Stars\n\nCreighton ranks second in the nation in field goal percentage, connecting at a 51.6 percent clip. Only UCLA (52.9 percent) and unbeaten Gonzaga (51.6 percent) are over 51 percent through games of Sunday.\n\nCreighton is also shooting the ball well in league play, draining 50.0 percent of its attempts. That would rank as the BIG EAST's best league mark since Georgetown (50.5 percent) in 2006-07. No team has shot better than 50.6 percent since Syracuse (51.3%) in 1988-89.\n\nA Special Winter\n\nCreighton men's basketball (22) and Creighton women's basketball (22) each have surpassed 20 wins this season, the 11th time in school history that both teams have 20 or more wins in the same winter (also 1984-85. 1990-91, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14).\n\nCreighton was one of 12 schools with 22 or more wins in both men's and women's basketball this season, through games of Feb. 26. That elite group includes Baylor, Belmont, Bucknell, Creighton, Duke, FGCU, Florida State, Gonzaga, Louisville, Maryland, Notre Dame and UCLA.\n\nThe 44 combined wins between the Creighton MBB and WBB programs is tied for eighth-most in school history for one winter. That record is 53, set during the winters of 2002-03 and 2012-13.\n\nAdditionally, Creighton's .772 combined winning percentage (44-13) ranks as the second-best combined mark for one winter in program history, trailing only the .791 mark set in 2002-03 (42-11).\n\nAmong The Nation's Best Under McDermott\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranks nationally in the since Greg McDermott took over in 2010-11, per Basketball-Reference.com:\n\n2010-11 to Feb. 26, 2017\n\nCategory Stat NCAA Rank\n\n3FG Percentage .389 4th\n\nFG Percentage .481 4th\n\n3FG Made 2,035 6th\n\nAssists 3,903 6th\n\nFG Made 6,448 12th\n\nWins 163 T-27th\n\nWinning Percentage .674 37th\n\nFoster Distributes, Too\n\nMarcus Foster had a season-high eight assists in the Feb. 25 game at Villanova. He has now distributed 37 helpers in his last nine games after dishing just 32 dimes in the first 20 games of the year.\n\nAgainst Seton Hall, Foster became the first Bluejay since 2000 to have at least 23 points, six rebounds and six assists in the same game. On that occasion, Ryan Sears had 25 points, eight rebounds and assists at Southern Illinois on January 8, 2000.\n\nThe only other BIG EAST players with a game of at least 23 points, six rebounds and six assists this year have been Xavier's Edmond Sumner and St. John's Shamorie Ponds.\n\nFoster's game against Georgetown of 35 points, five rebounds and five assists. He's Creighton's first player with a 35/5/5 line since Benoit Benjamin had 45 points, 16 rebounds and five assists vs. Indiana State on January 19, 1985.\n\nFoster Reaches 500\n\nMarcus Foster has scored a team-high 546 points this season, including a career-high 35 points on Feb. 19 vs. Georgetown.\n\nDoug McDermott (581 as a freshman in 2010-11) and Paul Silas (551 in 1961-62 as a sophomore, back when freshmen were ineligible) are the only previous players to score 500 points or more in their first season on the court for Creighton.\n\nSellout Streak Stands At Nine\n\nCreighton has sold out each of its previous nine home games. The team will seek a 10th straight sellout on Feb. 28 when it hosts St. John's.\n\nThe longest home sellout streak in program history is 12, which stretched from Dec. 22, 2013 to Nov. 14, 2014.\n\nCreighton has played in front of 13 sellout crowds this season, including 10 at home and three on the road.\n\n3-Ball Returns\n\nCreighton was leading the nation in three-point percentage (45.3 percent) when it took the floor to open BIG EAST play vs. Seton Hall on December 28th.\n\nCreighton struggled in the first half of BIG EAST play, making just 54-of-180 (30.0 percent) of its attempts in the first nine league games.\n\nThe Bluejays have regained their shooting stroke in the last six games, draining 76-of-160 three-point shots (47.5 percent). That stretch started not long after a dreadful 1-for-18 showing from long-range at Georgetown on January 25th.\n\nCreighton has made 13 or more trifectas seven times this winter, and 10 or more in 13 contests.\n\nHere's a look at the three-point shooting statistics of the 11 Bluejays who have attempted a trey in CU's last seven games:\n\nName 3FG-FGA 3FG%\n\nJustin Patton 2-2 1.000\n\nMartin Krampelj 1-1 1.000\n\nDavion Mintz 6-11 .545\n\nCole Huff 15-29 .517\n\nToby Hegner 8-16 .500\n\nKhyri Thomas 14-28 .500\n\nMarcus Foster 19-43 .442\n\nIsaiah Zierden 9-22 .409\n\nTyler Clement 2-6 .333\n\nJordan Scurry 0-1 .000\n\nRonnie Harrell Jr. 0-1 .000\n\nTeam Totals 76-160 .475\n\nPatton Chasing History\n\nJustin Patton has made 69.3 percent of his field goal attempts this season, good enough to lead the BIG EAST and rank second nationally in 2016-17.\n\nThe best season-ending mark in NCAA history, with a minimum of 5 FG/game, is 74.6 percent in 1980-81 by Oregon State's Steve Johnson, while the best mark by a freshman in NCAA history is currently 67.8 percent by Hampton's Michael Freeman (162-239) in 2006-07.\n\nThe top two field goal percentage marks in history by a \"major conference\" freshman (ACC, BIG EAST, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC) are 66.5 percent by Arkansas' Sidney Moncrief in 1975-76 and 66.4 percent by Duke's Jahlil Okafor in 2014-15.\n\nThat being said, Patton's marksmanship this season trails one other man who are also on pace to challenge the NCAA record for field goal percentage, as UNCW sophomore Devontae Cacok is at 78.7 percent this season.\n\nThe chart below lists the top-15 single-season marks for field goal percentage in NCAA history entering 2016-17:\n\nBest FG %, NCAA History\n\n(minimum 5 FG/game)\n\nRk.

He's 25-for-52 (48.1 percent) from downtown during this stretch.\n\nIsaiah Zierden has made 17 straight free throws, a streak that started on Jan. 4 at St. John's. For the season, Zierden is 25-of-27 (92.6 percent) from the charity stripe.\n\nMarcus Foster has scored at least 10 points in each of his last 12 games.\n\nNo Doubting This Thomas\n\nKhyri Thomas has been on quite a roll of late. In the last eight games, the sophomore from Omaha has averaged 12.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game, doing all that with a 35/14 assist/turnover ratio.\n\nFor the season, Thomas leads Creighton in steals and is second on the team in rebounds, assists, and blocks.\n\nJays Ranked In 16th Straight Polls\n\nThe Creighton men's basketball team fell out of the top-25 for the first time all season when Monday's (Feb. 27) poll was released.\n\nThat snaps a 16-week stretch of rankings that had been one shy of the school-record.\n\nThe 16 weeks the Bluejays have been ranked this year tie a school-record for one season, first done in 2012-13.\n\nEarlier this year on Jan. 16 Creighton was ranked as high as seventh in both the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches poll\n\nCreighton has now been ranked in 84 weeks in program history, with 56 of those under the direction of seventh-year head coach Greg McDermott.\n\nBelow is a list of the best weekly rankings in the AP poll in program history:\n\nBest Weekly AP Rankings, Creighton History\n\n7th - 1/16/17\n\n8th - 1/9/17\n\n9th - 3/1/14\n\n9th - 12/19/16\n\n10th - 1/20/03\n\n10th - 11/28/16\n\n10th - 12/5/16\n\n10th - 12/12/16\n\n10th - 12/26/16\n\n10th - 1/2/17\n\nMost Consecutive Weeks in AP Poll, Creighton History\n\nWeeks Dates\n\n17 Feb. 27, 2012 - Feb. 4, 2013\n\n16 Nov. 11, 2016 - Feb. 20, 2017\n\n15 Dec. 14, 2002 - March 20, 2003\n\n8 Jan. 27, 2014 - March 17, 2014\n\n5 Feb. 12, 1974 - March 12, 1974\n\n5 Feb. 4, 1975 - March 4, 1975\n\n5 Jan. 9, 2012 - Feb. 6, 2012\n\nMost Weeks in AP Poll, Same Season, Creighton History\n\nWeeks Season Final W-L Postseason\n\n16 2012-13 28-8 NCAA (1-1)\n\n16 2016-17 22-7 so far TBD\n\n15 2002-03 29-5 NCAA (0-1)\n\n12 2011-12 29-6 NCAA (1-1)\n\n11 2013-14 27-8 NCAA (1-1)\n\n20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 17 of the last 19 seasons (including 2016-17), a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust three schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the previous 18 years (entering 2016-17): Duke, Gonzaga and Kansas.\n\nKentucky , Florida, Texas and Syracuse have each done it in 17 of the previous 18 seasons (entering 2016-17).\n\nAlong with Arizona, Xavier and Connecticut, Creighton was one of four schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 16 of the previous 18 years (entering 2016-17).\n\nThis is the 28th time in program history that Creighton has won 20 or more games in a season.\n\nThe win also matched Creighton's victory total (20) from all of last season in 35 games.\n\nBelow is a list of the teams with at least 16 seasons (entering 2016-17) of 20 or more wins since 1998-99, with records through games of Feb. 26th.\n\n20+ Wins - Each of Last 18 Seasons (entering 2016-17)\n\nTeam 2016-17 W-L Next Game\n\nGonzaga 29-1 3/4\n\nKansas 26-3 2/27\n\nDuke 22-7 2/28\n\n20+ Wins - 17 of Last 18 Seasons (entering 2016-17)\n\nTeam 2016-17 W-L Next Game\n\nKentucky 24-5 2/28\n\nFlorida 23-6 3/1\n\nSyracuse 17-13 3/4\n\nTexas 10-19 3/1\n\n20+ Wins - 16 of Last 18 Seasons (entering 2016-17)\n\nTeam 2016-17 W-L Next Game\n\nArizona 26-4 3/4\n\nCreighton 22-7 2/28\n\nXavier 18-11 3/1\n\nConnecticut 14-14 3/1\n\n20 Wins Reached, Again\n\nCreighton picked up its 20th win of the season on Tuesday, Jan. 31, with a victory at Butler.\n\nIt's the second time in program history that Creighton has reached the 20-win milestone before the end of January.\n\nThe 2011-12 team that tied a school-record with 29 victories improved to 20-2 with a win on January 28, 2012.\n\nClement Honored By CoSIDA\n\nCreighton men's basketball guard Tyler Clement has been named to the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) Academic All-District 7 First Team. A junior from Shawnee, Kan., Clement owns a perfect 4.00 GPA in Creighton's Heider College of Business as a Financial Analysis and Marketing major.\n\nClement is Creighton's first men's basketball student-athlete to receive Academic All-District acclaim since Anthony Tolliver in 2006-07.

Last season Clement was also named to the NABC Honors Court.\n\nTalented Thomas\n\nBest Defensive Player? Most Improved? Most Underrated? There's a lot of titles you could bestow on Khyri Thomas, who continues to fly under the radar as one of the BIG EAST's top players.\n\nThe sophomore from Omaha leads the team in steals and is second on the squad in rebounding, assists and blocked shots.\n\nThomas tied a career-high by sinking 4-of-5 three-point shots in Creighton's Jan. 31 win at Butler. Creighton is 15-2 this year, and 24-7 in his career, when he drains a trifecta.\n\nSince arriving on campus, Thomas has made 42-of-91 (46.2 percent) three-pointers in Creighton wins compared to 17-of-56 (30.4 percent) marksmanship from deep in Bluejay losses.\n\nThomas has scored in double-figures in 11-of-16 BIG EAST games this winter after never doing that as a freshman.\n\nThomas entered that Butler game 9-for-55 (16.4 percent) in his career against BIG EAST foes from three-point range, compared to 36-of-64 (56.3 percent) shooting from deep in games against all other clubs.\n\nFoster A Naismith Trophy Candidate\n\nCreighton guard Marcus Foster is one of 30 players in consideration for the 2017 Naismith Men's College Player of the Year.\n\nFoster leads the BIG EAST in scoring at 18.8 points per game, which puts him on pace for the highest scoring average by a Bluejay newcomer since 1969-70. He's been a two-time BIG EAST Player of the Week (Nov. 28, Dec. 26), and was also named MVP of the Paradise Jam in November. The Wichita Falls, Texas, native, has scored 12 points or more in 27-of-29 games to date, including a season-high 30 vs. Marquette on Jan. 21. Foster owns 521 points so far at Creighton after scoring 875 points in his first two years at Kansas State.\n\nFoster has started all 29 games this season for the Bluejays, who are off to a 22-7 start. He is one of three BIG EAST players on the list, joining the Villanova duo of Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson.\n\nThe 10 semifinalists will be announced March 1, 2017. Foster is looking to become Creighton's second Naismith Men's College Player of the Year winner in the last four years, as Doug McDermott hauled in the honor following the 2013-14 season.\n\nFoster Up For Jerry West Award\n\nCreighton men's basketball guard Marcus Foster is one of 10 finalists for the 2017 Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nNamed after Hall of Famer and 1959 NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player Jerry West, the annual honor in its third year recognizes the top shooting guards in Division I men's college basketball.\n\nThe winner of the 2017 Jerry West Award will be presented at the ESPN College Basketball Awards Show live from The Novo by Microsoft in downtown Los Angeles on Friday, April 7, 2017.

The electrifying 7-footer ranks second nationally in field goal percentage (.693), including 62 dunks.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar played for legendary coach John Wooden at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1966-1969. He is a three-time NCAA Champion who earned numerous accolades including three-time Final Four Most Outstanding Player, three-time National College Player of the Year and three-time Consensus First-Team All-American (1967-1969).

Hanson underwent surgery on Nov. 28th, and the senior played five minutes at Georgetown on Jan. 28 in his first action in nearly two months.\n\nHanson has made 24-of-34 shots since he's returned, contributing 53 points and 17 rebounds in 93 minutes of work.\n\nA Pierre, S.D., native, Hanson is averaging 6.6 points and 2.4 rebounds per game while shooting 69.5 percent from the field in 11.4 minutes per game.\n\nEven though he wasn't on the court while injured, Hanson maintained a strong leadership role on the team as he mentored freshmen centers Justin Patton and Martin Krampelj.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over in 2010, Creighton is averaging 79.39 points per home game (9,765 points in 123 home games).\n\nSince a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000, Creighton had been 127-0 at home (97-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more, and 107-0 at home (80-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to that same setback, before a January 21st, 102-94 loss to Marquette. Creighton also lost on Feb. 4 vs. Xavier, 82-80.\n\nBIG EAST > \"Football 5\" ???\n\nCreighton has knocked off teams from the Big Ten (Wisconsin and Nebraska), Pac-12 (Arizona State and Washington State), ACC (North Carolina State) and SEC (Ole Miss) this year, all by nine or more points.\n\nThose six non-conference wins over the \"Football 5\" leagues are the most of any other team in the nation.\n\nThe BIG EAST owns 27 non-conference wins over \"Football 5\" leagues, second-most of any league in the nation.\n\nBoth figures are through games of February 26.\n\nMBB Non-Conference Wins Over\n\n\"Football 5\" Leagues, By Team\n\n6 Creighton\n\n5 Butler\n\n5 Gonzaga\n\n5 UCLA\n\n5 Kansas\n\n4 Xavier\n\n4 Seton Hall\n\n4 Clemson\n\n4 Baylor\n\nMBB Wins Over \"Football 5\" Leagues, By Conference\n\n31 Atlantic Coast\n\n27 BIG EAST\n\n21 Big 12\n\n18 Southeastern\n\n17 Big Ten\n\n12 Pac-12\n\nMintz Shows His Stuff\n\nFreshman Davion Mintz showed what he was capable of on January 21 vs. Marquette in his first extensive playing time with the regular rotation.\n\nMintz came off the bench and established or tied season-highs in virtually every category, including minutes (26), points (17), assists (8), rebounds (3), field goals (4), free throws (7) and blocks (1). Creighton outscored Marquette 69-63 with him on the floor.\n\nMintz is one of seven BIG EAST players in the last seven years with a game of at least 17 points and eight assists against Marquette, joining star guards such as Ryan Arcidiacono, Bryce Cotton, Sterling Gibbs, Isaiah Whitehead, Trevon Bluiett and Maurice Watson Jr. Of that group, Mintz was the only one to do it in a reserve role.\n\nAmong Creighton players, Mintz joins Austin Chatman (twice), Grant Gibbs (once), Maurice Watson Jr. (six times) and Antoine Young (once) as the only players with a game of 17 points and eight assists in the seven-year era of Greg McDermott.\n\nNo other Bluejay has had a game of 17 points and eight assists off the bench in the last 35 seasons (going back to 1981-82).\n\nWatson Out With Torn ACL\n\nCreighton University senior guard Maurice Watson Jr. tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during Creighton's 72-67 win at No. 22 Xavier on Jan. 16, head coach Greg McDermott confirmed the following day.\n\nWatson was leading the nation with 162 overall assists and 8.5 assists per game at the time of his injury, also leads the nation's active players with 801 career assists. He is ranked ninth in Creighton history with 391 assists. The Philadelphia, Pa., native spent the first two years of his college career at Boston University.\n\nWatson was a Preseason All-BIG EAST selection and was one of 25 men on the Wooden Award Midseason List, as well as one of 30 men up for the Senior CLASS Award. Sites such as CBSSports.com and NBCSports.com had him among their top-10 in the National Player of the Year standings.\n\nWatson underwent surgery on February 6 in his hometown of Philadelphia and on Feb. 13 was suspended from all athletic-related activities for alleged actions that are contrary to University policies and core values.\n\nPaint It Blue\n\nCreighton's offense is known for its proficiency from three-point range, but don't overlook the work done inside the paint, as well.\n\nCreighton has outscored opponents 1,102-872 in the paint this year, the program's best margin in that category since the school started tracking the stat in 2003-04.\n\nOnly five opponents all year have outscored CU in the paint this season over the course of a game.\n\nQuick Out Of The Gates\n\nCreighton continues to race to the lead in the opening minutes on a regular basis this season.\n\nIn fact, Creighton owned a double-digit lead at some point in each of its first 19 games this year, and all but three games overall (Marquette; at Georgetown; at Seton Hall, at Villanova) this season.\n\nBelow is a list of some of Creighton's runs to start the game this season:\n\nOpponent Score Time Left in 1st Half\n\nUMKC 15-2 14:25\n\n#9 Wisconsin 8-0 18:39\n\nWashington State 12-4 17:27\n\nBuffalo 15-6 13:18\n\nAkron 12-3 15:20\n\nNebraska 14-2 15:17\n\nLongwood 11-2 16:42\n\nOral Roberts 6-0 19:10\n\n#1 Villanova 19-9 14:30\n\nSt. John's 7-0 16:25\n\nProvidence 10-0 16:31\n\n#12 Butler 19-9 12:12\n\nTruman State 17-3 13:56\n\n#22 Xavier 11-4 15:16\n\nDePaul 15-2 13:15\n\nGeorgetown 11-4 16:34\n\nIt's Been 100 Years\n\nJanuary 12th marked the 100th anniversary of the first recorded game in Creighton men's basketball history, as Creighton topped Peru State 30-17 on January 12, 1917 in Omaha.\n\nCreighton went 17-3 in that first season despite never scoring more than 40 points in any game.\n\nThomas E. Mills was the coach of that team.\n\nOmaha's population in 1920 was 191,601, while Creighton has hosted 279,007 fans this season in 16 home games.\n\nThree-Point Options\n\nToby Hegner's fourth and final trey at Arizona State was the 100th trifecta of his career. He now owns 115, and is the fourth active Bluejay with 100 or more three-pointers, joining Marcus Foster (200, with 64 at CU), Isaiah Zierden (165) and Cole Huff (181, with 114 at CU).\n\nZierden stands in 10th place in Creighton history with 165 career three-pointers.\n\n3FG Name Years\n\n371 Kyle Korver 1999-03\n\n334 Ethan Wragge 2009-14\n\n274 Doug McDermott 2010-14\n\n245 Ryan Sears 1997-01\n\n212 Rodney Buford 1995-99\n\n206 Jahenns Manigat 2010-14\n\n200 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n185 Matt Roggenburk 1986-90\n\n177 Duan Cole 1987-92\n\n165 Isaiah Zierden 2013-17\n\n147 Booker Woodfox 2007-09\n\nAbout That 13-0 Start\n\nCreighton started this season 13-0 for the first time since the 1942-43 team started 16-0.

Villanova was picked first with 81 points and nine first-place votes, while Xavier and Creighton round out the top three. Seton Hall and Georgetown tied for fourth place, while Butler, Marquette, St. John's, Providence and DePaul rounded out the bottom half.\n\nCreighton guard Maurice Watson Jr. was named Preseason All-BIG EAST First Team, while Marcus Foster was picked to be a Preseason All-BIG EAST Honorable-Mention choice.\n\nNBA Representation\n\nThis year marks the third straight season that Creighton has three NBA players at the same time, as Kyle Korver (Cleveland Cavaliers), Anthony Tolliver (Sacramento Kings) and Doug McDermott (Oklahoma City Thunder) are all in the league.\n\nIncluding 2016-17, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 33 of the last 34 years.\n\nKorver ranks fifth in NBA history with 2,014 three-pointers and is also seventh in league history with 43.1 percent marksmanship from three-point range (through February 26). He set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range in 2009-10, and is the only player in league history to lead the NBA in three-point percentage three times. He's currently averaging 10.3 points per game while making 45.8 percent of his three-point attempts this year.\n\nTolliver is averaging 7.2 points and 3.9 rebounds per game this season for the Kings, his 11th NBA organization.\n\nMcDermott was traded last Thursday by the Chicago Bulls to the Oklahoma City. He is averaging 9.9 points per game and shooting 44.2 percent from the field and 36.8 percent from three-point range.\n\nFull House\n\nCreighton is averaging 17,438 fans per home game this season, fifth-best nationally. That figure would rank 17th best in the NBA, ahead of 14 franchises.\n\nLast year was the 11th straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and the fifth straight season in the top-10 nationally in attendance, as well.\n\n2016-17 Attendance Leaders (2/26)\n\nRk.

The 302,887 home fans last season ranked as the most in school history.\n\nCreighton had never attracted more than 141,000 home fans in any season prior to the opening of CenturyLink Center Omaha, and now has done it in the last 14 seasons (including this year).\n\nCreighton has led its conference in home attendance every year since moving into CenturyLink Center Omaha, which is in its 14th season.\n\nCreighton's Most Home Fans, Season\n\nRk.

The streak is the nation's 21st-longest active streak through games of February 26.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (2/26)\n\nRk.

On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Gonzaga (14), Duke (10), Winthrop (9), Creighton (8), Kansas (8) and Kentucky (8).\n\nTop-20 Crowds\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's top-20 home crowds all-time. The Villanova crowd of 18,831 Dec. 31 was third-most in school history.\n\nRank Att.

While respectable, that pales in comparison to CU's 79-14 (.849) mark the last six years when shooting better than 40.00 percent from downtown.\n\nLower the standards to 30%, and it's still impressive. Creighton is 121-35 in the last six years when shooting 30 percent or better from deep, compared to 18-28 when shooting 29.99 percent or less.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 16 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point. Nine of those comebacks came away from home, including the win over Ole Miss in the Virgin Islands on Nov. 21st.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2014, Creighton trailed 42-24 to No. 18 Oklahoma with 18:30 to go before putting together a comeback for the ages. It was CU's largest comeback victory under Greg McDermott (see chart below), and the second-biggest in the history of CenturyLink Center Omaha (see chart, left column on page four).\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 142-12 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 130 of the last 138 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under Greg McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n11 vs. Ole Miss 11/21/16\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Dramatics\n\nProvidence's Kris Dunn hit a game-winning shot as time expired to beat Creighton last Jan. 12th. It was the first game-winning shot with no time left to ever to beat Creighton at CenturyLink Center Omaha, exceeding the previous low with 1.9 seconds left by Butler's Roosevelt Jones in 2014-15.\n\nDunn's shot was the first to beat Creighton (at any site) with no time left on the clock since Anthony James drained a game-winning three-pointer for Northern Iowa in a 65-62 win on Feb. 4, 2012 in Cedar Falls, Iowa.\n\nCreighton is 7-7 in games with a game-winning go-ahead score in the final 10 seconds in the 14-year old facility.\n\nCreighton's Go-Ahead Scores in Wins at CLCO, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n11/26/05 Dayton W 91-90* Funk FG :5.7\n\n01/28/06 Wichita St. W 57-55 Tolliver FG :0.0\n\n11/25/06 George Mason W 58-56 Watts FT :7.5\n\n03/18/08 Rhode Island W 74-73 Witter 3FG :3.2\n\n01/13/10 Southern Illinois W 71-69 Young FG :1.3\n\n02/18/12 Long Beach St. W 81-79 Young FG :0.3\n\n01/28/14 St. John's W 63-60 McDermott 3FG :2.8\n\n*double-overtime\n\nOpponent Go-Ahead Scores in CU Losses at CLCO, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n03/20/06 Miami (Fla.)
