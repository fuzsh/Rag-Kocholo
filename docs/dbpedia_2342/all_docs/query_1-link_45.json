Even advanced students can struggle with electrochemistry, but with this approachable experiment, students can easily control and apply potential to a chemical system and measure the response as a current. In this workshop, develop strategies for teaching students how to assess a voltammogram and modify operational settings to improve data quality.\n\nParticipants should bring goggles and wear laboratory appropriate attire.\n\nK-12 - Curriculum and Cognition\n\nSunday, 28th July 08:30 AM-10:00 AM\n\nMelissa Hill, mhill@vernier.com, Vernier\n\nLaboratory based, Workshop 283, Cost $10\n\nExperiential Chemistry: A hands-on laboratory-based course for non-majors - This workshop is a hands-on introduction to Experiential Chemistry, a course designed specifically for non-science majors. The approach used in this course reverses the traditional pattern of science education where early mastery of factual material is required before the students are allowed to explore the interesting problems. Students are first presented with a series of exciting experiments and are allowed to experience the excitement of chemistry. Unlike other non-majors course, Experiential Chemistry is taught exclusively in the laboratory, with no lecture component. This workshop will give participants a chance to explore many of the experiences developed for the course and to discuss how the course is implemented. Copies of the course text and other supporting materials will be provided.\n\nParticipants should bring goggles and wear laboratory appropriate attire.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nMarc Richard, marc.richard@stockton.edu, Stockton University\n\nElizabeth Pollock, elizabeth.pollock@stockton.edu, Stockton University\n\nLaboratory based, Workshop 111, Cost $10\n\nIntroduction to Integrating Green Chemistry and Sustainability in Undergraduate Teaching Laboratories - Green Chemistry is a framework that helps \"minimize or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances\" in chemical processes and products. It is our responsibility as instructors to educate our students with respect to green chemistry, sustainability, and environmental issues to prepare them as future members of the workforce and agents of change in the world. Importantly, this has recently been recognized in the new ACS Guidelines for Bachelor's Degree Programs as a critical requirement, whereby curricula must provide students with a working knowledge of the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry.\n\nThis interactive half-day (3h) workshop is aimed towards laboratory instructors at two- and four-year undergraduate institutions teaching curricula in all areas of specialization. We will illustrate the connection between fundamental principles of green chemistry, safety, and traditional teaching laboratory protocols (further examples provided in the accompanying symposium, see below for details). Participants will gain an understanding of not only practical aspects of greening undergraduate labs, but also ways of modifying assessments and content to improve pedagogical aspects of laboratory learning to include more topics around green chemistry and broader sustainability concepts. Participants will then divide into small sub-discipline specific groups to share experiments currently used in their courses, and discuss possible modifications to their own lab manuals to make them \"greener.\" After reflecting on current curricula, we will explore a number of useful resources for integrating theory into practice, such as the new online Green Chemistry Teaching and Learning Community (GCTLC). The workshop will conclude by creating personal action plans for implementing sustainable changes, both practically and pedagogically, to current experiments or potentially new experiments to be developed.\n\nThis workshop complements the symposium entitled \"Frontiers in Integrating Green Chemistry and Sustainability into the Teaching Laboratory,\" which will provide recent examples of \"greener\" teaching experiments.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nJonathon Moir, jonathon_moir@beyondbenign.org, Beyond Benign\n\nJohn De Backere, john.debackere@utoronto.ca, University of Toronto\n\nDavid Laviska, d_laviska@acs.org, ACS Green Chemistry Institute\n\nJane Wissinger, jwiss@umn.edu, University of Minnesota\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 116, Cost $10\n\nChemMatters: Building Curiosity and Encouraging Science Literacy - Looking for a new way of building your students' curiosity of the world around them? Or just to encourage them to read science and non-fiction? ChemMatters publishes four issues annually on topics such as frost, 3-D printing of food, and vaping, with high school level explanations of the relevant chemistry. In this workshop, we will explore the most recent ChemMatters issues from 2023-2024 and their related teaching aids to build a lesson plan that can be used during a specific learning module. We will explore different ways of incorporating the story and how to link it to course learning goals and reading initiatives across the curriculum.\n\nThe workshop will begin with a brief mock lesson using one of the articles from the 2023-2024 production year. We will work through the lesson plans provided and then brainstorm about when might be a good time to introduce the topic. Working in groups, we will create lesson plans for other Quick-Read and feature articles. The focus will be on improving the facilitation of a lesson around a ChemMatters article that is designed to introduce, reinforce, or expand on a topic typically presented in high school, AP, or first year college chemistry courses.\n\nAttendees will receive a set of ChemMatters issues (2023-2024) and the lesson plans to accompany the feature articles for each issue. At the end of the workshop, participants will have prepared and, if time allows, piloted a lesson on a ChemMatters article with workshop participants. Ample time will be allowed for discussion and idea sharing.\n\nK-12 - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 08:30 AM-10:00 AM.\n\nKelley Donaghy, k_donaghy@acs.org, American Chemical Society\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 121, Cost $10\n\nActivities to develop international standards for ethics in chemistry - In 2022, at the BCCE in Purdue, an initial workshop was conducted to begin the production of ethics examination items. This first workshop addressed the challenges to ACS and all chemical organizations about how to engage all members (from students to retired chemists) toward the construction of ethical policies for the profession. Participants at BCCE in Purdue (2022) began the development of an ethics exam that models after the ACS Anchoring Concepts Content Map (ACCM) model used for standardized examination development by the ACS Exam Institute. Since that time, assessment items were developed at Towson University to ascertain student mastery of ethical expectations in the chemistry profession. During this 2024 subsequent workshop, these items will be analyzed, and further development of questions will take place. During the 2024 workshop, input will be sought from diverse programs, and multiple levels of proposed examinations. These will be designed for testing aspects of validity and reliability during 2024, and results will be disseminated and used for expansion of curricular incorporation. Teaching of ethics throughout all levels of education should be connected to assessment of education materials and practices. This workshop will seek to connect assessment and pedagogy.\n\nK-12 - Assessment and Research Methods\n\nSunday, 28th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nSusan Schelble, sschelbl@msudenver.edu, Metropolitan State University of Denver\n\nKelly Elkins, kmelkins@towson.edu, Towson University\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 78, Cost $10\n\nDesigning and implementing high-engagement collaborative group work activities in chemistry classrooms - Research in chemistry and science education indicates that students' active and interactive engagement in the learning process is critical to develop meaningful understandings. Nevertheless, our investigations suggest that chemistry instructors struggle to design and implement collaborative group work activities that cognitively and socially engage all students in productive discussions of central chemical concepts and ideas. In this workshop, we will analyze actual tasks and recordings or transcripts of students working in small groups to identify and apply criteria to design and implement collaborative group activities more effectively in chemistry classrooms.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will be able to\n\nIdentify major challenges students face to productively engage, cognitively and socially, in collaborative group activities in college chemistry classrooms.\n\nApply design principles in developing tasks that support high cognitive and social engagement in collaborative group activities in chemistry courses.\n\nRecognize implementation strategies that foster student cognitive and social engagement during in-class tasks.\n\nMajor Workshop Activities\n\nParticipants will work in small groups to apply criteria to evaluate the type, cognitive level, and modes of reasoning fostered by different types of classroom activities.\n\nParticipants will work in small groups to analyze social processing and knowledge dynamics in collaborative groups in chemistry classrooms (video or transcript analysis).\n\nParticipants will work in small groups designing and evaluating collaborative group activities that foster high cognitive and social engagement.\n\nParticipants will collectively discuss strategies to guide and support student work during designed activities.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nRenee Cole, renee-cole@uiowa.edu, University of Iowa\n\nGregory Rushton, grushton@mtsu.edu, Middle Tennessee State University\n\nVicente Talanquer, vicente@arizona.edu, University of Arizona\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 67, Cost $10\n\nCultivating Inclusivity and Equity in the Classroom - Despite increased numbers of underrepresented students enrolling in STEM majors over the past decade, there remains a significant attrition gap. Less than half of students who enter STEM majors at freshmen level complete degrees in these areas, and STEM students from minority groups, low-income, and first-generation college backgrounds graduate at nearly half the overall rate. A 2019 study specifically examined factors contributing to persistence in STEM majors and found that instructor pedagogy and curriculum design were two of the top factors. A large body of research supports the benefits of inclusive curricular and pedagogical practices for not only historically underrepresented students, but for all students. In terms of pedagogy, the choice of specific activities and methods of instruction in a classroom has been shown to impact students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy, particularly for underrepresented students. Barriers to student learning shown to arise from pedagogical choices include stereotype threat and microaggressions, which impact underrepresented students' grades, sense of belonging, and motivation to persist in STEM fields.\n\nIn this workshop, we will discuss how pedagogical choices can introduce barriers in the classroom and identify some of the barriers our students face. We will provide examples and resources of how faculty can support their students through inclusive and equitable classroom practices. The workshop attendees will develop approaches they can use in their own chemistry classrooms to support their students. Opportunities to share ideas and provide constructive feedback with other workshop attendees will be included. Due to the collaborative nature, attendees are asked to bring their own electronic device, such as a laptop or tablet.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nAndrea Carter, aacarter@meredith.edu, Meredith College\n\nAlexandra Ormond, ormonda@meredith.edu, Meredith College\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 207, Cost $10\n\nMoving Students From Description to Explanation with VisChem - Participants will experience the VisChem Approach. This approach uses carefully produced, dynamic particle-level animations, combined with constructivist teaching strategies, all informed by a cognitive learning model and the latest research on learning through multimedia, to foster conceptual understanding of chemistry. A key strategy of the approach is refinement of the learners’ internal visualizations using storyboards (drawings with explanation) of chemical and physical changes. Educational research has repeatedly shown that use of particle-level models is vital to building student understanding of reactions in solution. Participants will get access to a suite of VisChem resources during the workshop (animations and storyboard templates) and will be able to download them and use them indefinitely. The workshop builds teacher expertise in pedagogy that simultaneously implements molecular-level models and addresses the cognitive challenges of molecular visualizations. It supports teacher learning to help move students from phenomena description to explanation to deepen conceptual understanding in alignment with the NGSS. VisChem is aligned with the follow NGSS SEPs: developing & using models and constructing explanations; and critical disciplinary core ideas: matter & its interactions, motion & stability: forces & interactions, and energy.\n\nLearning outcomes:\n\nUse the particulate level to explain core chemistry concepts; relate these explanations to macroscopic phenomena, symbolic representations (formulas, equations), and mathematical relationships (e.g., concentration as a crowding of particles in a given volume of solution represented as c = n/V).\n\nIdentify the limitations of dynamic molecular models generally (and specifically VisChem animations) and recognize how limitations influence student thinking and generate inaccurate ideas.\n\nExperience VisChem tools (e.g., frames from animations, static models, sample drawings and graphics) and strategies (e.g., peer discussion, storyboarding, attention focusing, segmenting) in a learner role.\n\nBegin to plan how to implement VisChem animations and the VisChem Approach in your classroom.\n\nK-12 - Professional Development\n\nSunday, 28th July, 08:30 AM-04:15 PM\n\nEllen Yezierski, yeziere@miamioh.edu, Miami University\n\nRoy Tasker, roytasker@icloud.com, Western Sydney University\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 302, Cost $10\n\nTeaching Essential Chemistry Content Through Demonstrations - It is often difficult to decide what demonstrations to use to support your instruction and excite students. The hundreds of classroom resources available in the American Association of Chemistry Teachers (AACT) resource library can help you plan demos to support the units you teach. In addition, many include the idea of modeling. Attendees will learn about engaging AACT demonstrations and walk away with resources to use with their students.\n\nParticipants should bring goggles and wear laboratory appropriate attire.\n\nK-12 - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 10:15 AM-11:45 AM,\n\nJeramy DeBry, j_debry@acs.org, aact\n\nLaboratory based, Workshop 55, Cost $10\n\nPlay It to Remember It; Effective Activities to Engage Student Learning - In this workshop, participants will engage in concept activities which focus on areas where students have more difficulty. Students are able to use the hands-on strategies which address curriculum outcomes in a different way to support diverse learning needs. Students are not judged by errors they make but they are encouraged to discuss their ideas with peers and the teacher. They make informed decisions as they play independently, in small groups, or with the entire class. Students play without the stress of summative assessment.Templates, game cards/rules, cardsorts, overviews, review mats, 3-D printing files, laser-cut files, and more resources are available for download for FREE at playeducateinspire.pbworks.com.\n\nK-12 - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 10:15 AM-11:45 AM\n\nPeggy Au, mpau@cbe.ab.ca, Calgary Board of Education\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 134, Cost $10\n\nTeaching Essential Chemistry Content Through Demonstrations - It is often difficult to decide what demonstrations to use to support your instruction and excite students.

Participants will be actively participating in teams in which each member who attends this workshop will be divided into teams of 3 to 4 people per team. Teams will write a mini contract that will govern how the team will function during this session. Participates will be engaged in a mini-experiment using household goods to actively explore team-based collaborative learning laboratory techniques in chemistry. The team will decide who will take on the roles of team captain, research assistant, chief recorder, and clean-up artist. In this laboratory model, members experience self-management, effective communication, and leadership skills. Each position has specific tasks within the experiments and lab reports [along with other duties as assigned by the team captain or instructor]. Participants will experience a protocol written like while X happens Y needs to happen to provide every member a chance to contribute the overall experiment and complete the experiment within the workshop period. Throughout the experiment, participants will have team meetings and debriefing meetings to gather data from other members of the team and help each other learn what everyone did in the experiment. I believe this overall model design in which every student has specific jobs to advance the overall experiment can even be applied to any form of a team, including pairs. Because of the wide-spread potential adaptability, I hope to be able to share what I have accomplished in my 20 years of chemistry laboratory teaching using this method.\n\nParticipants should bring goggles and wear laboratory appropriate attire.\n\nK-12 - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 01:00 PM-04:15 PM\n\nKameyo Johnson, ochem_tutor@yahoo.com, University of Pikeville\n\nLaboratory based, Workshop 115, Cost $10\n\nUsing Pipet Bulb Rockets to Introduce Stoichiometry - Participants will generate oxygen gas and hydrogen gas using an inexpensive microscale setup. The oxygen and hydrogen gases are collected in a disposable pipet bulb with three different hydrogen:oxygen ratios (1:2; 1:1; 2:1). Using a charcoal lighter fitted with stereo wire, participants are able to deliver an energy of activation into the reaction chamber (pipet bulb). Participants determine the best empirical ratio for converting chemical energy into heat. When less than optimal stoichiometry is tested energy is lost in the forms of sound and light.The activity covers eight National Science Standards. Students love the activity. They feel like real chemists as they generate oxygen gas by decomposing 3% hydrogen peroxide with manganese metal chips as a catalyst. They produce hydrogen in a single displacement reaction with mossy zinc and 1.0 M hydrochloric acid. Participants learn how to collect gas reaction products. They see how potential energy is contained in the reactants until an energy of activation is introduced. In my class, students are graded based on the flight distance of their pipet rocket. They are able to repeat tests using different reactant ratios and different amounts of water in the pre-flight rocket until they are ready for their graded demonstration.\n\nParticipants should bring a pair of safety glasses/goggles and an empty charcoal lighter if they have one.\n\nK-12 - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nSunday, 28th July, 01:00 PM-02:30 PM\n\nBean Burr, chs_burrb@hotmail.com, National Science Teachers Association\n\nLaboratory based, Workshop 107, Cost $10\n\nAssessment of Impacts of Green Chemistry Curriculum - New ACS Guidelines for Bachelor's Degree Programs advocate for integrating green chemistry into university chemistry courses. However, assessing students' understanding of these principles remains challenging due to a lack of established tools. This workshop aims to assist green chemistry educators with assessing students' cognitive and affective outcomes.\n\nThe workshops will start with an introduction to backward design. Participants will learn the three stages of backward design: i) identify desired results, ii) determine acceptable evidence, and iii) plan learning experiences. The first part of this workshop will focus on two different approaches to capture changes in students' knowledge - using multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Specific attention will be paid to using case comparison prompts to assess students' knowledge of green chemistry principles. In these prompts, two reaction alternatives were presented, and students were asked to identify which of the two reactions would be the \"greener\" option and explain their reasoning.\n\nThe second part of the workshop will focus on assessing affective outcomes related to green chemistry education. Green chemistry's relevance to real-world problems could motivate students toward chemistry. Therefore, theory-based instruments will be used to collect student responses to examine the effects of green chemistry projects on students’ affective outcomes, such as self-efficacy, attitudes, hope, meaningful learning, etc.\n\nThe workshop will cover an introduction to measurement, research designs (pre-/post-test, treatment/control, multiple groups), measurement alignment with constructs of interest, data collection practices, data analysis, and reporting. The participants will be given templates for administering assessment instruments and examples of appropriate narratives to convey the assessment part of their curriculum innovations.\n\nCollege and University - Assessment and Research Methods\n\nSunday, 28th July, 01:00 PM-04:15 PM\n\nAlexey Leontyev, alexey.leontyev@ndsu.edu, North Dakota State University\n\nYujuan Liu, y.liu@csus.edu, California State University Sacramento\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 127, Cost $10\n\nIt's All Fun and Games When Everyone Learns! - Come see for yourself how chemistry games can help your students learn in an engaging, meaningful, and fun way.

Most of them focus on verification of a particular theory or phenomenon found in the lecture course. While there is an inherent value in such experience, the disjointed nature of topics covered in the lab lends itself to cursory exposure to chemistry lab skills at best. Reimagining a curriculum involves taking a pause and asking questions regarding the role of each laboratory course in the broader chemistry curriculum. What if a laboratory curriculum existed to train students with fundamental laboratory techniques, rather than being a service component to a lecture course? How does a laboratory curriculum in STEM provide an opportunity for the underserved population to gain confidence in their skills? This workshop will probe the questions by reimagining the introductory chemistry laboratory curriculum by implementing skills-based, competency-focused laboratory curriculum. Through presentation and discussion of existing models of curriculum design, participants will work in groups to come up with a lab curriculum development scheme or topic-based outlines and assessments to begin the transformation in their introductory laboratory curriculum.

This presents significant challenges, as atoms and molecules are far removed from experience and behave in ways that are difficult to intuit from macroscopic experience alone. By carefully orienting class work toward constructing and refining causal accounts for phenomena, the learning environment can bound student sensemaking and support students' use of science and engineering practices. This workshop will engage participants in reflecting on pedagogical tools and practices supportive of student molecular-level sensemaking. The following question will guide our discussion:Workshop participants will focus on answering our focal question for their own institutional settings. Teachers in attendance will have the opportunity to experience perplexing phenomena, construct questions about how and why those phenomena occur, and work as a community to make sense of what they observed. Participants will further have the opportunity to reflect on how they would enact analogous phenomena-centered lessons in their local context.

While the activities themselves are designed to engage students in the learning process, sometimes the activity content does not engage the students. One approach to help engage students is to show them the relevance of the content. Real-world context can be incorporated into models and/or used in the application of the content. Participants in this workshop will have the opportunity to work through a sample activity, will be introduced to different approaches to incorporate real-world context and will be given time to brainstorm how real-world context could be used in their own discipline. how these activities might be incorporated into a general chemistry curriculum.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nMonday, 29th July, 02:00 PM-05:15 PM\n\nDaniel King, dk68@drexel.edu, Drexel University\n\nCharity Lovitt, lovittc@uw.edu, University of Washington Bothell\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 180, Cost $10\n\nA Chemical Inquiry: Let's Master Equilibrium! - Chemical equilibrium is a central topic to the understanding of both Chemistry and Biology-yet students have many misconceptions. The NGSS standard HS PS1-6 covers this important topic. In a recent AP Chemistry Exam, the vast majority of students did poorly on the topic and had misconceptions about equilibrium-73 % of the students received a zero or had no response to the equilibrium question. Students are most familiar with equilibrium problems and experiments where the K value is small-usually less than 1. Exam questions dealing with a large K value cause the majority of students to do poorly. In this presentation, participants will take part in a \"hands on\" inquiry activity with a equilibrium having a large K value. Participants will learn methods to overcome student misconceptions of equilibrium. Join this workshop to take an inquiry lab back to use in your classroom. Handouts will be provided.

During weekly instructional team meetings, LAs provide feedback to faculty about how students are experiencing the course, and the team prepares for the upcoming week. LAs receive additional support and training through a pedagogy course, often with LAs from other disciplines across an institution's LA Program. Together, the instructional team meetings and pedagogy course provide structure, community, and resources for LAs to utilize and improve inclusive practices when interacting with students. This workshop will serve as an introduction to the LA model. Participants will analyze videos, engage with data from LA-supported courses, and consider how working with LAs could work in their own contexts. Workshop organizers and facilitators are leaders within the Learning Assistant Alliance (https://learningassistantalliance.org/) and have experience working with LAs in various chemistry class settings and modalities.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nMonday, 29th July, 02:00 PM-05:15 PM\n\nIra Caspari-Gnann, ira.caspari@tufts.edu, Tufts University\n\nBrittney Morgan, brittney.morgan@colostate.edu, Colorado State University\n\nKathryn N.

A major problem, though, is what happens after the lab experience: students may struggle completing the data analysis and results part of a laboratory experience. Worse yet, students may not see the chemical principles behind the experiment: they cannot see the forest for the trees. How do you level the playing field for everybody? That's where we come in!\n\nIn this hands-on, immersive workshop, participants will learn (with apologies to Charles Dickens) about Macmillan Learning's online learning platform, Achieve, and our partner, Learning Science UK, tool inside the Achieve platform, Smart Worksheets, and how both of these programs work together to transform a laboratory experience into an equitable digital learning environment that covers both students and instructors before, during, and after an in-person laboratory experience.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to both Achieve and Smart Worksheets, participants will get the full student experience by completing an introductory chemistry experiment and then experience Achieve and Smart Worksheets as students to see how the systems work together. Afterwards, we will have a debriefing session led by several professors to tell us their own curriculum re-development story using both Achieve and Smart Worksheets. Finally, we will discuss how to implement both Achieve and Smart Worksheets at your home institution.\n\nWe would like to invite lab coordinators at two- and four-year schools. Lunch and breaks/snacks will be provided.

During this workshop participants will evaluate the extent to which their syllabus centers learning rather than policies and procedures, identify components of the syllabus they could modify to increase the learning focus of the document, begin making modifications, and explore strategies to encourage students to interact with the syllabus in meaningful ways. We will use Palmer's Measuring the Promise rubric along with results from our nationwide study of Physical Chemistry syllabi to structure the workshop for instructors of any Chemistry course. We will encourage participants to focus on high impact changes, such as ensuring transparent alignment between assessments and learning goals and objectives in the syllabus. While the focus of the workshop will be on the document itself, participants may find that modifying their syllabus prompts them to reflect on the learning-focus of their course design as well. Participants should bring a syllabus for one of their courses or a device they can use to access a syllabus.\n\nCollege and University - Professional Development\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 08:30 AM-10:00 AM\n\nJulie Donnelly, julie.donnelly@ucf.edu, University of central florida\n\nKurt Winkelmann, kwinkelmann@valdosta.edu, Valdosta State University\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 53, Cost $10\n\nLibreTexts: Building your OER textbook for your class - This workshop will show attendees how to use the LibreTexts system to build custom chemistry textbooks for their curriculum and students. Libretexts provides easy and global online access to open educational resources (OER). Inexpensive printed copies are available.\n\nStarted over fifteen years ago as the ChemWiki, LibreTexts has over 500 chemistry textbooks spanning the curriculum available for use, remixing or revision. Materials from the biology, mathematics, physics and statistics libraries can be mixed into your texts as needed or used as supplements. There is a plethora of other materials including exercises and an online homework system. LibreTexts operates on a commercial cloud server with high up time, users do not have to provide IT support. Features include online annotation (hypothes.is), online computation via a Jupyter hub, import into LMSs using the LTI Common Cartridge, 3D images (JSMol, GLMol, etc), and more.\n\nIn the Chemistry Library, students from ~150 college and universities can access their course LibreTexts directly within branded course shells. Roughly 60% of online traffic comes from outside the US. The system can display any Unicode symbol and LibreTexts in Spanish, Chinese and French already exist. Machine translations of all the roughly 120 centrally curated textbooks are available in Spanish and Ukrainian, with basic books available in French, Portugese, Chinese, Hindi, Kishwali and Arabic. LibreTexts Polyglot Engine can provide machine translation on demand for any of books using Amazon Web Services AI translator.\n\nAn online construction guide is available (attendees will receive a printed copy) and there are videos to help new users as well as video conferencing. This will be a hands on workshop. Registered attendees will be able to start using the system to create LibreTexts on the spot.

Participants will experience a simulated POGIL laboratory experience and examine its components and structure. The criteria for a POGIL laboratory experiment will be introduced and applied to the written description of an experiment. After attending this session, participants will be able to: (1) articulate the components of a POGIL laboratory experiment and correlate them with the components of the Learning Cycle, (2) describe several differences between a POGIL laboratory experiment and a traditional laboratory experiment, and (3) determine the extent to which an experiment meets the POGIL laboratory criteria.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nMichael Garoutte, michael@michaelgaroutte.com, Missouri Southern State University\n\nCraig Teague, cteague@cornellcollege.edu, Cornell College\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 182, Cost $10\n\nBackward-Design Your Laboratory Course - We have worked collaboratively for several years to develop a first- and second-year inquiry-based laboratory course where students are challenged to individually isolate caffeine from a consumer product as a culminating lab practical. We have found backward design to be the most effective method for developing a course structured around what students are expected to be able to do at the end of the semester. Starting with the end in mind ensures that the course is designed to achieve specific learning outcomes rather than simply covering a broad range of topics or activities without a unifying purpose. Now, we are eager to guide our colleagues through the process of backward-designing their own laboratory course or laboratory module!\n\nIn this workshop, participants will identify what skills they want their students to be able to do at the end of the course or module, and then choose a culminating experiment that allows students to demonstrate those skills. This may be incorporated as a lab practical, like our culminating experiment, or just an experiment that students complete late in the semester. We use a published experiment that we have modified over time to best suit our needs.\n\nAfter selecting the culminating experiment, participants will identify the thinking and technical skills that students will need to master in order to perform the culminating experiment. This will allow them to start to envision the overall arc of their laboratory course or module, and they may be able to fill in some ideas or experiments as they backward design. Participants will go home having selected their culminating experiment as well as creating an outline of experiments and assessments leading up to the culminating experiment.\n\nCollege and University - Curriculum and Cognition\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nAnnette Neuman, annette.neuman@emory.edu, Emory University\n\nBrenda Harmon, bharmon@emory.edu, Emory University\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 147, Cost $10\n\nSummative rubric evaluation for the assessment of mechanism questions in the second-year organic chemistry course sequence - This workshop is invitation only. This final follow-up workshop is designed for attendees of any of the three previous workshops run at BCCE 2018 and 2022. Specifically, as a group we will review the initial rubrics created in the previous workshops and optimize them for future use in grading mechanism questions. We intend to generate a set of assessable metrics that lead to rubrics for practitioners to utilize in the assessment of mechanism-focused problems in organic chemistry.\n\nCollege and University - Assessment and Research Methods\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nJay Wackerly, wackerlyj@central.edu, Central College\n\nMichael Wentzel, wenztelm@augsburg.edu, Augsburg University\n\nSarah Zingales, szingales@usj.edu, University of Saint Joseph\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 19, Cost $10\n\nBeyond \"verbatim\" transcription: Using techniques from applied linguistics to enhance the analysis of classroom talk in chemistry education research - Chemistry education researchers are increasingly looking at classroom talk to understand aspects of teaching and learning. Many of these researchers draw on approaches from discourse analysis, and these approaches have provided insight into students' argumentation, sensemaking, and discourse moves, among other features. An essential first step in these studies is transcription. While it is common to refer to \"verbatim\" transcriptions, the meaning of verbatim is not necessarily transparent. Even a transcript that accurately captures every word that was spoken can hide important aspects of conversational dynamics that are relevant to determining what is happening in the recording.\n\nThis workshop demonstrates how techniques from applied linguistics can be used to enhance transcripts for the purposes of chemistry education research. Participants will learn more about the kinds of features that applied linguists pay attention to when transcribing classroom talk as well as conventions that can be used to capture these details in a transcript. Using examples from the workshop leaders' research in the context of general chemistry, participants will compare different transcriptions of the same interactions and discuss how additional layers of detail might change their interpretation of the data. The workshop leaders will explain how these kinds of additional details shaped their development of a codebook for cognitive engagement and open a discussion of the potential advantages and disadvantages of applying these kinds of tools and techniques in other contexts.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:\n\nExplain how a verbatim transcript can hide important features of classroom talk\n\nIdentify transcription conventions for capturing details related to participants' manner of speaking and nonverbal actions\n\nDescribe data collection techniques that can be used to enhance transcripts\n\nCompare how different transcription conventions capture relevant aspects of conversational dynamics\n\nEvaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using more detailed transcripts\n\nCollege and University - Assessment and Research Methods\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 10:15 AM-11:45 AM,\n\nAlissa Hartig, ahartig@pdx.edu, Portland State University\n\nSafaa El-Mansy, selmansy73@gmail.com, Reed College\n\nJack Barbera, jbarbera@pdx.edu, Portland State University\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 93, Cost $10\n\nA Culminating General Chemistry Laboratory Experiment that Reviews Key Learning Goals Using Natural Pigments - Lab is a unique learning environment that allows students to explore and ask questions with one-on-one attention from faculty and peers. Participants will perform an experiment developed over ten years to serve as the culminating lab for first-semester general chemistry students. Starting with a fresh spinach leaf, we will consider the chemical structure-property relationships of pigment molecules by extracting, separating, and studying their spectroscopic characteristics. We will use a molecular modeling program to build molecules and analyze their molecular orbitals. In addition to reinforcing techniques like spectroscopy and computer modeling, the lab also serves as an introduction to some of the techniques that students will encounter in organic chemistry like column chromatography.\n\nThe experimental methods rely on concepts like molecular polarity and solubility that are reinforced by pigment separation using mixtures of polar and non-polar solvents. Using spectroscopy, students correlate the color of the pigment to the absorbance spectrum, demonstrating that the color you see is the complement to the absorbed color. Building molecular models of smaller molecules with a variety of double bonds correlates the degree of conjugation with energy transitions. Students apply the wavelength and energy equations they learned for the H-spectrum to complex molecules and correlate the color of molecules with the magnitude of the HOMO-LUMO energy gap.\n\nExtract and isolate photosynthetic spinach pigments using chromatography.\n\nAnalyze absorbance spectra of colored compounds.\n\nBuild and analyze molecular orbitals in a molecular modelling program.\n\nCalculate energy transitions and perform wavelength calculations.\n\nCorrelate compound color to features of their chemical structures.\n\nWorkshop participants will learn to set up and perform the experiment and incorporate molecular modeling into the general chemistry curriculum. The experiment will also be used as a point of discussion on how participants may develop a cumulative experiment based on the curriculum of their home institution.\n\nParticipants should bring goggles and wear laboratory appropriate attire.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 02:00 PM-05:15 PM\n\nJennifer Schmeisser, jschmeiss@stlawu.edu, St. Lawrence University\n\nNadia Marano, nmarano@stlawu.edu, St. Lawrence University\n\nEmily Metzger, emetzger@queenbsuryschool.org, Queensbury High School\n\nLaboratory based, Workshop 262, Cost $10\n\nReducing Barriers to Learning with Digital Chemistry Notebooks - Designing active-learning modules that function across in-person, hybrid and remote learning spaces remains challenging and nontrivial for chemical educators at all levels. One route to future-proof course modules is via interactive electronic notebooks. Through demonstrations and hands-on activities, participants learn how to create new or distill existing activities into digital Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition (W|ANE) notebooks. W|ANE notebooks bridge multiple learning spaces by combining molecular visualization, chemical data exploration and natural language computing into one document all while quietly teaching programming along the way. Example activities for use in an introductory chemistry course at the high school or undergraduate level are provided. Time is allocated for notebook explorations with emphasis on significant digits, chemical conversions, chemical reactions, 2D & 3D visualization along with cloud publishing.\n\nParticipants should bring their own device such as a laptop or tablet and have access to W|ANE. A trial version of W|ANE is available at https://account.wolfram.com/access/wolfram-alpha-notebook-edition/trial.

This process has produced exams that speak to many variations of teaching the targeted course(s) with input on the content coverage, depth of coverage and difficulty of items. However, even with this process, it is possible that testing needs for your institution could vary such that the standardized exam is not an ideal match for your course. In the past, building a custom exam has been a possibility but without the ability to have any national data available for comparison. Through recent work by the ACS Exams research team, we are now able to provide custom exams with national comparison data. This workshop will share the capabilities of custom exams as well as take you through a process of building a custom exam using specialized software that provides content arrays and national norms to consider in the design process. This is available for single-semester or full-year general, organic and inorganic (foundational) chemistry.\n\nCollege and University - Assessment and Research Methods\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 02:00 PM-05:15 PM\n\nOlga Michels, olga.michels@luther.edu, Luther College\n\nDavid Schreurs, schreurd@uwm.edu, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee\n\nJaclyn Trate, trate@wisc.edu, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nSachin Nedungadi, snedungadi@unomaha.edu, University of Nebraska at Omaha\n\nChrystal Bruce, cbruce@jcu.edu, John Carroll University\n\nPatricia Kreke, kreke@msmary.edu, Mount St. Mary's University\n\nThomas Pentecost, pentecot@gvsu.edu, Grand Valley State University\n\nKristen Murphy, kmurphy@uwm.edu, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 259, Cost $10\n\nClassroom Exercises for General and Organic Chemistry Involving Wildlife Forensics and Food Fraud - Chemistry, now and in the future, has a pivotal role in combating the growing global criminal entities associated with wildlife and food crimes. Why not teach some aspects of general or organic chemistry in the context of these real-world issues?\n\nThe goals of this 90 minute workshop are to: 1) familiarize participants with the use of three common active learning teaching methods- Think/Pair/Share (TPS), Jigsaw, and Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT), and 2) incorporate wildlife forensic and/or food fraud problem-based learning (PBL) classroom exercises into the General or Organic Chemistry curricula.\n\nIn this workshop faculty participants will do what we ask our students to do. Participants will be exposed to TPS, Jigsaw, and JiTT active learning teaching methods, along with the use of small whiteboards, to solve real-world problems related to wildlife crime and food fraud. The wildlife forensic and food fraud problem sets were designed by the presenter to be used by students in General Chemistry 1 and Organic Chemistry 1/2.\n\nThe PBL classroom exercises related to wildlife forensics/crime and food fraud center around seminal principles or concepts taught universally in general and/or organic chemistry- namely, stable isotopes (C-13, H-2, N-15, O-18, Sr-88, and so on), interrogating graphs and other data visualizations, proposing a plausible molecular structure or quantitative conclusion supported by the data, and/or interpretation of spectroscopic evidence (for organic, 1D 1H and 13C NMR (decoupled and DEPT), IR, and mass spectrometry).\n\nTime permitting, participants will work together to create a new classroom exercise focused on either wildlife forensics or food fraud, broadly defined.\n\nTwo-Year - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 02:00 PM-03:30 PM\n\nscott donnelly, scott.donnelly@azwestern.edu, Arizona Western College\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 35, Cost $10\n\nADAPT: LibreTexts Online Homework System - ADAPT is a new online homework system being developed by LibreTexts to serve the Open Education community. This workshop will showcase the ADAPT online homework system which incorporates LibreStudio for building H5P questions and sophisticated learning analytics. We will demonstrate how to use ADAPT to augment existing and newly constructed OER textbooks and embed them in LMSs, LibreTexts textbooks, as a standalone application for summative testing and to use with cell phones as in-class clickers.Today, online homework systems are the most commonly required curricula materials. With the support of the California Educational Learning Lab, ADAPT is designed to combine adaptive learning with culturally responsive pedagogy at minimal cost.\n\nThe workshop will demonstrate how the ADAPT homework system empowers faculty to use existing questions in multiple modalities. Participants will learn how to build autograded questions based on four technologies – H5P, WebWork, IMathAS, and native (QTI) – that can be used interchangeably to allow for maximal impact. Open ended questions can be evaluated using a sophisticated checker to rapidly mark text, audio or other files for grading.\n\nWe will also introduce the LibreStudio platform for construction, storage and distribution of H5P assessments. Participants will be able to join LibreStudio to create and share H5P assessments, review the H5P of other authors, and build/join a community within Studio.\n\nThe workshop will conclude with an overview of the associated analytics infrastructure to provide real-time learning analytics to instructors on student progress with pre-defined learning objectives.\n\nParticipants will need to bring their own laptop to this workshop.\n\nCollege and University - Professional Development\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 02:00 PM-05:15 PM\n\nDelmar Larsen, dlarsen@libretexts.org, Libretexts\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 94, Cost $10\n\nThe POGIL Project Workshop: Student-Centered Learning in the Laboratory: The Science Writing Heuristic Approach - In this session, participants will explore an active learning strategy known as the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH). Features of SWH including beginning questions, procedures and results, and claims and evidence will be demonstrated through a lab simulation experience. After attending this session, participants will be able to: (1) articulate the components of an SWH laboratory experiment, (2) describe methods for soliciting and facilitating the generation of beginning questions, (3) show students how to derive evidence-based claims that are drawn from the actual data collected in lab, (4) articulate the structure of the SWH laboratory experience and contrast it with the laboratory report format.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 02:00 PM-05:15 PM\n\nSteve Gravelle, steve.gravelle@stvincent.edu, Saint Vincent College\n\nBrandon Fetterly, fetterlyb@uwplatt.edu, University of Wisconsin Platteville\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 183, Cost $10\n\nActive Learning in Organic Chemistry: Backward Design - Active, student-centered pedagogies can dramatically improve student outcomes, but before implementing new teaching methods, it is essential to clarify, both to yourself and to the students, what students should be learning. This workshop will apply principles of backward design to the undergraduate organic chemistry curriculum based on Wiggins and McTighe's Understanding by Design (2006), Fink's Creating Significant Learning Experiences: An Integrated Approach to Designing College Courses (2013), and Zakrajsek and Nilson's Teaching at Its Best: A Research-Based Resource for College Instructors (2023). Participants will develop course and topic-level learning objectives as well as various types of assessments by cognitive level. This clearer understanding of goals and assessment methods provides the foundation for instructional change. While the backward design process aids in the development of any course, the workshop leaders will be focusing on its application to an organic chemistry course. High school teachers who wish to participate should be teachers of organic chemistry.

The Labflow Experiment Library (LEL) has been developed as an Open Educational Resource (OER) of General, Introductory, GOB, and Organic chemistry laboratories. Over the two years of development, we have had the opportunity to look at student responses (over 70,000 students in Fall 2023, alone!), we have built a data-informed approach to organizing lab topics (streamlined \"Broader Topics\"), assigning learning objectives and laboratory skills (over 200 pre-written LOs and Skills), and working to create more formative assessment structures to help students achieve those objectives. This workshop will expect faculty to bring along their own lab experiment(s) they wish to improve, and then to walk through thinking about the framework for their lab courses, the objectives they wish to implement, and then how to streamline the experience for their students to bring the focus of laboratory learning back to reiterative learning rather than summative reports. Participants should expect to leave with a framework of topics for their lab courses and a plan for reworking their assessment materials, including learning objectives and skills to incorporate.\n\nParticipants will need to bring their own laptop to this workshop.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 02:00 PM-05:15 PM\n\nJustin Shorb, justin@catalystedu.com, Catalyst Education, LLC\n\nMandy Dark, mandy@catalystedu.com, Catalyst Education, LLC\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 148, Cost $10\n\nWriting equitable assessments: Strategies for chemistry educators and chemistry education researchers to construct more accessible and inclusive assessments - Constructing equitable assessments is crucial for promoting accessibility, inclusivity and accurate evaluation of students' content knowledge and skills. Since language plays a fundamental role in comprehension, we will explore evidence-based techniques to writing chemistry assessment items that reduce the academic language barrier in chemistry and enhance accessibility of assessment items. We will discuss approaches of universal design and linguistic simplification to mitigate the cognitively demanding features within items and ways to include features that elicit understanding. By learning to craft items with simplified linguistic features, we can ensure that the focus of the assessment remains on chemical concepts, not the complexity of the language itself. This approach encourages better understanding, reducing the risk of misinterpretation or confusion among students.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to bring their own assessment items to revise for the purposes of linguistic simplification. Participants will spend the majority of the workshop time discussing and applying linguistic modifications to revise existing assessment items.\n\nCollege and University - Assessment and Research Methods\n\nTuesday, 30th July, 03:45 PM-05:15 PM\n\nEshani Lee, egl51@psu.edu, Pennsylvania State University, Hazleton\n\nJack Barbera, jbarbera@pdx.edu, Portland State University\n\nAnna Eunji Kim, aek5559@psu.edu, Pennsylvania State University\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 200, Cost $10\n\nBack to top of page\n\nWednesday Workshops\n\n3D Printable Resources for Engaging Students in the Exploration of Instrument Design and Performance: Inexpensive and User-Friendly Instrument Kits for STEM Educators - While much has been accomplished in developing low-cost instruments using children’s building blocks and household items, greater access to 3D printing via community makerspaces and university fabrication centers allows educators to transcend the limitations of conventional tooling. The recent and accelerating advances in computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D printing methods provide access to innovative approaches in the development of new educational tools. While this evolving technology offers great potential, the barrier to entry is often intimidating for those unfamiliar with CAD software and fabrication equipment. This workshop will guide participants in the design of a colorimeter or fluorimeter instrument for lab use. Each participant will be provided with a 3D printed instrument kit to take home to use in their classrooms. Additionally, participants will receive a user-friendly set of computer-aided design (CAD) models and stereolithography (STL) files for the production of simple and inexpensive 3D printed analytical instruments. These designs allow educators to provide active learners with tools for constructing instruments in activities aimed at exploring the technology and fundamental principles related to quantitative analysis. These digital models are flexible in design, printed quickly, and each requires less than a dollar’s worth of plastic filament. Once printed, the resulting instruments perform very well when compared to commercially available tools. No previous CAD, 3D printing, or electronics experience is required. This workshop welcomes both beginners and those with some experience.\n\nParticipants should bring goggles and wear laboratory appropriate attire.\n\nCollege and University - Professional Development\n\nWednesday, 31st July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nLon Porter, porterl@wabash.edu, Wabash College\n\nLaboratory based, Workshop 44, Cost $25\n\nActive Learning in Organic Chemistry: Improve student learning and engagement with formative assessment and collaborative learning - Many faculty are excited about using more technology and the \"flipped\" classroom is making headlines, but these alone don’t improve student engagement and learning. This workshop will introduce proven active learning pedagogies, discuss why they are effective, and provide key characteristics of effective instruction that can use technology and work within the “flipped” paradigm. Participants will develop activities and materials for a particular class session of their choosing. Workshop facilitators will use examples from their experience teaching active-learning organic chemistry courses with enrollments of 20-200 students. Emphasis will be placed on effective in-class use of collaborative learning and formative assessment techniques such as classroom polling, concept maps, structured problem solving, categorization grid, round table, and background knowledge probe.\n\nCollege and University - Classroom Practice and Learning Environments\n\nWednesday, 31st July, 08:30 AM-11:45 AM\n\nJustin Houseknecht, jhouseknecht@wittenberg.edu, Wittenberg University\n\nJanell Mahoney, jmahoney@unr.edu, University of Nevada, Reno\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 240, Cost $10\n\nIntroduction to Machine Learning in Chemistry using Python. Part 1: Working with a data set and building a chemistry machine learning model. Part 2: Building data sets and cheminformatics models - Machine learning has exploded in popularity and use in chemistry over the past five years. Maybe you have heard the term machine learning but aren’t really sure what it is or why it matters for chemists. Or maybe you are excited about incorporating machine learning into your curriculum and want to learn more. Either way, this workshop is for you. The workshop will introduce fundamental concepts in machine learning and discuss how they apply to chemistry using the python programming language. No prior experience with machine learning or python is required. The workshop will consist of live coding examples and hands-on coding activities, where every participant will learn to build and evaluate machine learning models. Topics covered will include: what is machine learning, basic python syntax, importing data sets, the pandas data science library, EDA tools, visualizing data with seaborn, building machine learning models with sci-kit learn, evaluating the quality of ML models, molecular representations, and building a cheminformatics dataset with RDKit.\n\nParticipants should bring their own laptop computers. We will use a cloud computing environment that has all the required software installed; participants will not need to install software on their own computers. The session will conclude with a group brainstorming/discussion section about incorporating machine learning into chemistry courses. No prior experience with machine learning or python is required to attend the workshop.

If we want our chemistry labs to develop highly skilled chemistry researchers, those labs need to allow students build specific research skills.Many teaching labs do a great job of that in terms of technical skills (e.g. handling glassware, manipulating solutions, operating an instrument), but may not be so good at offering opportunities to practice the kinds of thinking that expert chemists do. Using an adaptation of Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman's inventory of such thinking, or 'cognitive tasks', this workshop will get you started on determining which cognitive tasks are required of students as they work through your lab experiments.We'll start with a brief over-view of the cognitive tasks and a discussion of where they typically show up in chemistry experiments. Then you'll get hands-on, assessing which tasks are present in one or more of your lab experiments. We'll wrap up with suggestions for easy adjustments to lab manual wording to offer additional opportunities for students to practice cognitive tasks.Bring your lab manual and, if possible, a couple example student submissions for one experiment of interest (e.g. a lab report). Lab courses from 1st to 4th year are suitable.\n\nCollege and University - Curriculum and Cognition\n\nWednesday, 31st July, 08:30 AM-10:00 AM\n\nRobin Stoodley, stoodley@chem.ubc.ca, University of British Columbia - Vancouver\n\nClassroom based, Workshop 197, Cost $10\n\nThe POGIL Project Workshop: Classroom Facilitation - There is no single way to implement POGIL—each time there are unique characteristics that can influence how particular goals are achieved.
