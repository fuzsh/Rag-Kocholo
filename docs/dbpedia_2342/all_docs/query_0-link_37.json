The ESPN version has the Irish opening in Chicago against #15 Milwaukee, with #7 George Mason and #10 Michigan State facing off in the other game. The Sports Illustrated web version also has the Irish in Chicago, facing #15 Long Island, with #7 UCLA meeting #10 Virginia Tech in the other game. The FOX Sports version has Notre Dame in Chicago facing #15 Coastal Carolina – with #7 UNLV and #10 Michigan State the projected teams in the other game.\n\n2. Kevin Ridgway, a senior defenseman on the Notre Dame men’s lacrosse team, today was named the BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Week. Ridgway and the Fighting Irish defense were key in Sunday’s 6-2 win at Penn State. The two goals allowed by the Notre Dame defense were the fewest since a 12-2 win over St. John’s during the 2009 season. The Irish defense surrendered just 19 shots, including only 10 on goal, to the Nittany Lions. Ridgway forced a game-highthree turnovers. This was the first career BIG EAST player-of-the-week award for Ridgway. The senior captain was named a first-team preseason All-American by Inside Lacrosse and was selected to the 2011 All-BIG EAST Preseason Team. The Hamilton Nationals selected Ridgway in the third round (18th overall selection) of January’s Major League Lacrosse draft.\n\n3. The Notre Dame men’s foil and women’s sabre fencing squads claimed gold at the inaugural U.S. Collegiate Squad Championships at the Jerome S. Coles Sports Center on Sunday in New York City. Foilist Ariel DeSmet (Troutdale, Ore.) led the men with a 7-1 overallbout record, while Eileen Hassett (Beaverton, Ore.) paced the women’s sabrewith a perfect 9-0 ledger. The men’s foil squad entered the bracket as the No. 1 seed and advanced to the championship bout with wins over Hunter College (45-20) and NYU (45-21). In the championship bout, the Irish held off second-seeded Yale for a 45-33 victory and the gold medal. The women’s route to the sabre finals was handled with relative ease, as the second-seeded unit knocked off Haverford College (45-17) and NYU (45-15) to earn their spot in the weapon finals. Once there, the Irish trio held off top-seeded Columbia, 45-42, to claim the gold medal. Individually for the men’s foil, DeSmet earned seven wins, including a critical 7-5 decision over Yale’s Jonathan Holbrook in the championship bout. The rest of the rotation saw Zach Schirtz (Rochester, N.Y.) and Enzo Castellani (Keller, Texas) finish unbeaten at 6-0 and 5-0, respectively. Reggie Bentley (Little Rock, Ark.) finished the draw with a bout record of 4-1. Only three competitors took to the strip for the women’s sabre unit, paced by Hassett’s nine wins. Sarah Borrmann (Beaverton, Ore.) concluded the tournament at 7-1, while Abigail Nichols (Concord, Mass.) ended 6-3 over the three matches. The full Irish team returns to competition this weekend as they welcome in the 19 other Midwest Fencing Conference (MFC) teams for the MFC Championships on Saturday and Sunday at the Joyce Center Fieldhouse.\n\n4.

The three-time monogram winner also has been named atwo-time BIG EAST Academic All Star selection in her time within the program. Gretsch enters her senior season having risen through the ranks within the team.

The Notre Dame women’s lacrosse team snapped its two-game losing streak on Sunday afternoon as the Irish rallied from a 7-4 halftime deficit to defeat Duquesne, 12-10, at Rooney Field in Pittsburgh. Senior midfielder Shaylyn Blaney paced the Notre Dame attack with three goals and three assists to equal a career high with six points in the game. Fellow senior Ansley Stewart added three goals while Jenny Granger and Kaitlyn Brosco scored twice and Kailene Abt and Kaitlin Keena added one in the win. Duquesne was led offensively by Katie Rekart with three goals. Caitlin Prince chipped in twowith Meredith Dunn, Haley Marafioti, Casey Denk, Elise Caldwell and Cailin Colegrove adding single markers. The victory improves the 10th-ranked Irish to 2-2 on the season while the Dukes fall to 1-2 this year. Notre Dame now owns a 7-0 all-time record against Duquesne, including a 3-0 mark in Pittsburgh. In a game that was postponed from Saturday to Sunday afternoon due to bad weather in Pittsburgh, Notre Dame started fast, but then fell victim to a four-goal run in the first half by Duquesne that put the Irish behind on the scoreboard for most of the game. Duquesne took control of the opening half as the Dukes went on a four-goal run in just over eight minutes on goals by Rekart, Marafioti, Colegrove and Dunn for a 5-2 lead with 13:31 left in the half. Notre Dame outshot Duquesne, 29-21, in the second half. The Irish are now off for 11 days and return to action on Thursday, March 10, when they play host to Ohio State in a 4:00 p.m. game at Arlotta Stadium.\n\n3.

The win gives the Irish their first win against Virginia in program history.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive match, and seventh time overall on the season, the Irish jumped out to a 1-0 lead after securing the doubles point. The freshman pairing of Jennifer Kellner (Smithtown, N.Y.) and Julie Sabacinski(Plantation, Fla.) earned their most impressive win to-date as members of the Irish, knocking off the 51st-ranked pairing of Maria Fuccillo and Rashmi Teltumbde, 8-4, at No. 3 doubles. The win also improves the duo to 2-3 since joining forces against Michigan. Juniors Kristy Frilling (Sidney, Ohio) andShannon Mathews (Birmingham, Mich.), ranked 57th, clinched the point at No. 1 doubles. The duo took down the Cavaliers’ 10th-ranked duo of Emily Fraser and Hana Tomljanovic, 8-6, also marking their most impressive victory as a tandem. Frilling and Mathews’ win streak now stands at five matches. Senior KristenRafael (Grand Prairie, Texas) and sophomore Chrissie McGaffigan (Davenport,Iowa) were all square with 67th-ranked Lindsey Hardenbergh and Erin Vierra atNo. 2 doubles, 7-7, when the match was abandoned.\n\nMcGaffigan got the Irish rolling in singles, earning her second consecutive win at the No. 5 position. She took down Fuccillo in straight sets, 6-4, 6-0, to push the Notre Dame advantage to 2-0. The Irish sophomore is now 2-0 at No. 5 and 3-6 overall on the dual season. Rafael then earned her first win of the weekend after her first two matches went unfinished. She took care of #54 Vierra at No. 3 singles in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1. The victory is her second consecutive at No. 3 and improves her dual record to 5-4. It also represents the first ranked opponent she has defeated on the campaign. With the Irish sitting on match point, Mathews closed out the Cavaliers by knocking off #67 Hardenbergh at No. 2 singles, 6-4, 6-4, to improve her singles record to 10-0 on the year.

The Irish have now won four consecutive matches to run their record to 7-4 and enjoy a brief break before returning to action against Indiana on Friday at 3:00 p.m. (ET) at the Varsity Tennis Courts in Bloomington, Ind.\n\n4. Ten years ago, the Notre Dame softball team started the 2001 campaign with eight straight wins. One decade later, the Irish bettered that school-record streak with nine straight wins after earning a pair of wins Sunday at the College of Charleston’s Cougar Classic in Mount Pleasant, S.C. Notre Dame began the day at Patriots Point with a five-inning, 10-1 victory over Marist. The team then went to work for a 6-4 win over Liberty for the program’s 900th win in 23 seasons. A perfect 4-0 record at the Cougar Classic was made largely possible by a pitching corps which posted a 0.54 ERA in 26.0 innings. Jody Valdivia, Laura Winter, Jackie Bowe and Brittany O’Donnell each recorded a win with Valdivia also posting a save. The Irish hit .316 as a team in the four-game invite while out-scoring the opposition, 19-5. Alexa Maldonado hit .545 with six hits and six runs to pace the offensive unit. Notre Dame willnext be in action March 4-6 at the Diamond 9 Citrus Classic in Kissimmee, Fla.\n\n5. Tim Abromaitis’ hustle plays were the difference in helping the No. 9 Notre Dame men’s basketball team move closer to securing a double-bye in the Big East tournament. Abromaitis scored 22 points, Ben Hansbrough had 21 and the Irish beat Seton Hall 60-48 Saturday night at Purcell Pavilion to remain insecond place in the conference. Notre Dame (23-5, 12-4) can lock up a bye inthe first two rounds of the league tournament when it faces Villanova on Monday night. Abromaitis came up big at the end of the first half as he gathered in a loose rebound and made an off-balance 3-pointer as time expired to pull theIrish to 27-24 after a half in which they shot only 32 percent and committedseven turnovers. The teams played close early in the second half, with the Irish taking a 31-30 lead. Then, Abromaitis made another key play in the middle of Notre Dame’s 13-0 run. After several near misses by Notre Dame, the ballbounced toward a couple of Seton Hall players but Abromaitis dove on it andpassed it to Hansbrough, who converted a three-point play. Seton Hall pulled to 44-43 on a rebound by Fuquan Edwin with 6 minutes remaining but consecutive3-pointers by Abromaitis and Scott Martin sealed the Irish’s win. Notre Damewarmed up to shoot 40 percent from the field, while the Pirates shot 30 percent. Jeff Robinson had 16 points for Seton Hall (11-17, 5-11), and Jeremy Hazell added 14.\n\nSeton Hall jumped out to an early 6-0 lead as Hazell and Robinson hit quick 3-pointers, before both teams struggled from the field. Seton Hall still led 11-8 after nearly 8 minutes were gone in the first half. Notre Dame started 3-for-14 shooting and Seton Hall was 4 for 17 from the field. Robinson converted a 3-point play by Robinson that gave Seton Hall a 20-11 advantagewith 5:51 to go in the first half. The Pirates stretched the lead to 11 before Notre Dame staged a late rally to pull within three at halftime.\n\n6. Becca Bruszewski made sure it was a sweet Senior Day in South Bend. Bruszewski scored 12 points in her final home game, and No. 8 Notre Dame cruised past Cincinnati 66-48 in women’s basketball before a sellout crowd on Saturday at Purcell Pavilion. Skylar Diggins scored 12 points for Notre Dame (24-5, 13-2 BIG EAST), which jumped out to a 7-0 lead in the first 2 1/2 minutes, pushed it to 15-6 with 8:24 remaining in the first half and then started the second half with a 21-0 run that put the game away. Kayla Cook had 18 points for Bearcats (8-19, 1-14). Shareese Ulis added 14 points. Devereaux Peters also had 12 points and Natalie Novosel finished with 11 for Notre Dame on Senior Day atPurcell Pavilion. The Irish wrap up the regular-season Monday at No. 7 DePaul.\n\nCincinnati trailed only 28-20 at halftime before the Irish went on their big run. The Bearcats’ bench was hit with a technical foul with 17:19 remaining, and Kaila Turner hit back-to-back 3-pointers that made it 61-30 with about 9 minutes left as the rout was on. An injury-riddled roster limited Cincinnati to just seven dressed players, making it an uphill battle against a team that has never lost to the Bearcats in seven previous matchups. Cincinnati has lost 13 straight games and wraps up its regular season against No. 24 Marquette on Monday night. The Bearcats’ last win was against South Florida, 57-56 on Jan. 5.\n\nNotre Dame logged its 13th conference win of the season, the most for the Fighting Irish in a BIG EAST campaign since 2004-05, when they went 13-3 during conference play. The Fighting Irish senior class earned its 100th victory (now 100-29, .775), becoming the sixth senior class in school history — and first since 2002-03 (Alicia Ratay and Karen Swanson) — to reach the century mark in career wins. The Fighting Irish finished with a 15-2 home record, the second consecutive season and fifth time in program history that Notre Dame has registered 15 home wins in a season. Notre Dame attracted its fifth selloutcrowd of the season, one shy of last year’s school record. The Fighting Irish set a single-season home attendance average record, welcoming 8,553 fans per game to Purcell Pavilion this season to break last year’s average attendance mark of 8,377 …\n\n7. Western Michigan senior goaltender Jerry Kuhn stopped all 35 shots he faced and the Broncos scored twice in the first period and held on for a 2-0 hockey win over Notre Dame in front of a sold-out Joyce Center on Saturday night on the Notre Dame campus. Ian Slater and Trevor Elias had first-period goals for Western Michigan while the Irish were shut out for the first time this season and the first time in just over a year (Feb. 25, 2010) — although the Irish did have two goals waved off and T.J. Tynan was stopped on a penalty shot with 29 seconds left in the game. The loss, coupled with Michigan’s 5-0 win at Northern Michigan, dropped the Irish into second place in the final regularseason CCHA standings. Notre Dame finished the regular season with a 21-10-5overall record and an 18-7-3-2 mark in the CCHA, good for 59 points. The Wolverine victory moved them into the top spot with 61 points for the year. The loss also snapped Notre Dame’s five-game winning streak and eight-game unbeaten streak (6-0-2) that started on Jan. 22.\n\nThe win was big for Western Michigan as it moved the Broncos back into fourth place in the CCHA with a 10-9-9-5 record, just one point ahead of Ferris State. Overall, Western Michigan finished the regular campaign with a 16-10-10 record. Both the Broncos and the Bulldogs will get first-round byes in the opening round of the CCHA playoffs but in the second round, the fourth-place team will host the fifth, meaning Ferris State will be at Western Michigan, the weekend of March 11-13. The Irish also will have a first-round bye and willhost a second round series against an opponent to be determined next weekend.\n\n8. Former Notre Dame greats Brian Walsh, Dave Poulin, Bill Nyrop andJack Brownschidle team up with recent Irish hockey standouts David Brown andErik Condra as the six players selected to the All-Joyce Center first team. The first-team selections along with the previously announced second- and third-team members were honored at the Joyce Center Saturday at the final regular-season home game versus Western Michigan. As part of the celebration of the final full season of hockey at the Joyce Center, former coaches, players, administrators and fans selected an 18-man All-Joyce Center team that covers the 43-year history (1968-2011) of the home of Irish hockey.\n\nEarlier this winter, all-decade teams were selected, covering four eras of Irish hockey – 1968-1980, 1980-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000 through 2010. The first and second teams that were selected then went to a ballot that Irish hockey fans were able to vote on from Jan. 24 through Feb. 20 and now the final totals are in. With the assistance of over 7,000 fan votes that provided full ballots, selecting three goaltenders, six defensemen and nine forwards, thethree All-Joyce Center teams were selected. The second team was announced Thursday and those six players named were goaltender Jordan Pearce (2005-09), defensemen Ian Cole (2007-10) and Benoit Cotnoir (1995-99), along with forwards Greg Meredith (1976-80), Eddie Bumbacco (1970-74) and Mike McNeill (1984-88). On hand at the Joyce Center Saturday night were Brian Walsh, Greg Meredith and Mike McNeill.\n\n9. The 26th-ranked Notre Dame men’s tennis team fell to No. 17 Texas Tech in a 4-0 decision Sunday at the Blue Gray National Tennis Classic at the Lagoon Park Tennis Center in Montgomery, Ala. Junior Casey Watt (Gibsonia, Pa./Pine-Richland) and freshman Greg Andrews (Richland, Mich./Gull Lake) grabbed a win at third doubles. The duo downed Raphael Pfister and Gabriel Wanderley, 8-6. The 28th-ranked Tyler Davis (Nashville, Tenn./Father Ryan) and Stephen Havens (Cincinnati, Ohio/Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy) dropped 8-6 to No. 76 Raony Carvalho and Rafael Garcia at first doubles. Watt and Andrews were able to keep the doubles match going, pulling away to an 8-6 win over Pfister and Wanderley at third doubles. The win wasn’t enough to gain the point, as 51st-ranked junior Niall Fitzgerald (Wicklow, Ireland/Blackrock College) and sophomore Spencer Talamdge (Hillsborough, Calif./Junipero Serra) were edged 9-7 by No. 59 Gonzalo Escobar and Vitor Manzini at second doubles to give the Red Raiders a 1-0 lead. No. 77 Watt was downed by No. 18 Escobar in identical 6-2 sets at the No. 1 position. The junior concluded the weekend tournament with a 1-2 singles record. Havens fell to 22nd-ranked Carvalho in straight sets, 6-1, 2-0. Senior Daniel Stahl (Bethesda, Md./Walt Whitman) was defeated by No. 116 Garcia in a two-set match (6-1, 6-1). The Irish have the week off before they have a three-match homestand, beginning with No. 14 Texas A&M on Friday, March 4, followed by No. 67 Northwestern Sunday, March 6, and No. 7 Illinois on Tuesday, March 8. All three matches will be played at the Eck Tennis Pavilion in Notre Dame, Ind.\n\n10. Notre Dame got back-to-back quality starts from senior RHP Cole Johnson and senior RHP Todd Miller in its baseball doubleheader with Seattle, but each went in defeat as the Irish offense managed just two runs on sevenhits in 1-0 and 7-2 losses Saturday afternoon at a frigid Husky Ballpark inSeattle. Notre Dame evened its record at 3-3, while the Redhawks improved to 4-3. Johnson (Hudson, Ohio) was nearly flawless in the opener of the twin bill. The righty blanked Seattle over the first six innings. Johnson settled into a nice grove over the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh inning. He sent down 15 of the next 17 Seattle batters, but Notre Dame was not able to mount anything against Redhawk starting pitcher Brandon Kizer. Kizer tossed 8.0 scoreless innings and limited the Irish to five hits. He struck out a pair and did not issue a walk. Notre Dame did tag Kizer with hits in each of the first three innings, but two of those hits were followed by double plays and the other, a one-out double from sophomore 2B Frank DeSico (Cleveland, Ohio) in the third inning, went for naught. The game remained scoreless into the eighth inning. Johnson surrendered back-to-back singles with one out before leaving the game. Freshman RHP Dan Slania (Tucson, Ariz.) replaced Johnson, but was unable to keep thegame scoreless.\n\nAfter being shut out in the opener, the Irish wasted no time in the nightcap of the doubleheader. Petzold and freshman 1B Trey Mancini recorded RBI singles in the top of the first inning off Seafth Howe to give Notre Dame a 2-0 advantage. Miller allowed a run in the bottom of the first, but settled down and retired 10 straight at one point before Doug Kincaid’s solo home run tied the game, 2-2. Howe sent down the final 16 batters he faced in the game. Infact, the final 19 Irish batters overall were retired. Notre Dame did not have a base hit after the first inning and did not have a base runner of any kind after the third. Notre Dame returns to action next weekend at the Coca ColaClassic on the campus of Winthrop University. The Irish opened the tournament at noon on Friday against Manhattan. Notre Dame then plays the host Eagles at 4:00 p.m.\n\n11. SLAM published a special issue featuring its selection of “The 500 Greatest NBA Players of All Time.” Former Irish on the list were #83 Adrian Dantley, #202 Kelly Tripucka, #232 Orlando Woolridge, #233 Austin Carr, #235 Bill Laimbeer, #369 John Shumate, #428 Troy Murphy and #464 LaPhonso Ellis.\n\n12. Notre Dame was well represented at the two-hour funeral for former Irish football great Dave Duerson Saturday at the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church on thesouth side of Chicago. Former Irish players in attendance included Rod Bone,Joe Johnson, John Mosley, Jon Autry, Luther Bradley (he and Duerson were both Muncie, Ind., products), Jerome Heavens, Jim Stone, Mark Green, Mike Larkin, Phil Carter, Greg Bell and Kris Haines. Former Notre Dame Monogram Club president Julie Doyle, an Irish volleyball player at the same time Duerson was playing football on campus, offered some remembrances and a prayer. Also representing the Monogram Club were Reggie Brooks, former executive director Bill Scholl, former president Mike Heaton and current vice president Dick Nussbaum. Among the many Chicago Bears present were Richard Dent, Otis Wilson, (former San Francisco 49er coach) Mike Singletary and (current Minnesota Viking head coach) Leslie Frazier. Also present was former Irish and Bear assistant Johnny Roland. Among the speakers were Wilson and the Rev. Jesse Jackson (he said he talked to Duerson about once a week). Said Jackson, “Looking at the box score, Dave was a winner. You’ve lost a lot, but you’ve got a lot left. Dave left more than he found. He ran as far as he could.” Said Wilson, “He couldn’t do anything halfway. When he got his teeth into something, he got it done. We shared a lot. We accomplished a lot.” Duerson’s son Brock spoke for the family and said the Duerson children will start a foundation to deal with certain mental illnesses in conjunction with sports. Said Brock Duerson, “Who would have thought a small-town guy from Muncie, Ind., would become such a success?” Members of Duerson’s immediate family returned to campus today for a private ceremony with Dave’s former Irish teammates in the Notre Dame Stadium locker room.\n\n13. On the same evening when Austin Carr was inducted into Notre Dame’s Ring of Honor inside Purcell Pavilion Saturday, a second honor was bestowedupon the program’s career scoring leader. Carr, who nearly 40 years after playing his final collegiate game in an Irish uniform still holds the school career scoring marks for points (2,560) and average (34.6), will have the lower concourse of the Joyce Center bear his name as it will now be called AustinCarr Concourse. The Purcell Pavilion upper concourse area was part of the overall renovation of the Joyce Center that was completed in October of 2009. The concourse area features a variety of theming elements that highlight the history of the venue and the various programs and events that have occurredwithin the building over the past 42 seasons. The building opened in the fall of 1968 and was originally named the Athletic and Convocation Center. The lower concourse area soon will recognize former Irish men’s and women’s basketball and volleyball student-athletes and their accomplishments.\n\nDuring his three seasons (1968-71) at Notre Dame, Carr led his Irishteams to a 34-6 (.850) mark at home and helped begin a list of upsets for which the building has become famous throughout the years. The first, and one of the most celebrated upsets to occur inside the building, took place on Jan. 23,1971, when Carr scored 46 points in an 89-82 win over top-ranked UCLA. The Bruins entered the contest that day riding a 19-game win streak and had defeated 48 straight non-conference opponents. UCLA went on to finish the season 29-1 and won its fifth consecutive national crown.\n\nAn emotional Carr learned of the concourse honor just a few moments before meeting with the media two hours before tipoff – and he required a box of tissues to get through his press conference. A packed house at Purcell Pavilion gave Carr a rousing, prolonged standing ovation after Notre Dame’s all-time great was introduced by athletics director Jack Swarbrick. President John Jenkins also made remarks and directed the unveiling of the Carr banner in the rafters. About a dozen of Carr’s former teammates came back for the ceremonies and they stood on the Purcell Pavilion floor as Carr was honored – and Carr greeted each of them individually after the formal event was over.Meanwhile, Notre Dame students honored Carr by wearing white t-shirts resembling the Irish script jerseys of the Carr era – with Carr’s name and #34 on them. Carr received a shadow box with a replica of the raised banner, aswell as a ring commemorating his selection to the Ring of Honor.\n\nThursday, February 24, 2011\n\n1. Notre Dame appeared to be in total control, then all of a sudden the Fighting Irish were lucky time ran out on Marshon Brooks. Ben Hansbrough scored a career-high 32 points and Tim Abromaitis had a season-high 28 as No. 9 Notre Dame hung on for a 94-93 win over struggling Providence on Wednesday night despite a Big East-record 52 points by Brooks. The Irish (22-5, 11-4 Big East) are off to their best start ever in 11 seasons under coach Mike Brey. NotreDame, in second place in the conference, has won eight of nine. Brooks’ 52 points was the most ever scored against Notre Dame, which hadn’t allowed a 40-point scorer since Danny Manning in 1987. Brooks, only the third player in Providence history to score 40 points or more twice in a season, surpassed the previous high of 45 by Michigan State’s Julius McCoy on Dec. 21, 1955. The Irish hadopened an 81-70 lead on Tyrone’s Nash’s layup with just under 6 minutes to play. Then, Brooks started an incredible run to cap his 35-point second half. He scored 15 of his points in the closing 2:57, narrowing the deficit to two points on three occasions and to the final margin with a 3-pointer with 2 seconds left. Providence (14-14, 3-12) has lost six of seven after beating then-No. 19 Louisville and No. 8 Villanova four days apart in late January.\n\nThe Irish, who led by 10 at halftime, pushed it to 55-39 on Abromaitis’ fourth 3-pointer 2 1/2 minutes into the second half. They maintained a double-digit advantage until the Friars closed to 72-64 on Duke Mondy’s 3 from the left corner with 9:22 to play. Notre Dame, which lost 72-58 at West Virginia on Saturday, shot 58.2 percent, including 9 of 21 on 3-point attempts. The Irish won their eighth straight against the Friars. Providence cut it to 74-67 on Brooks’ baseline jumper, but Hansbrough’s three-point play made it79-68 with just over 7 minutes to go. Brooks hit a spinning jumper from theright wing, making it 83-79 with just under 3 minutes left, but the Irish hitjust enough from the line to hang. Brooks’ two free throws cut it to 88-86, but Hansbrough hit two on the other end with 29 seconds to play. He made two more with 13 seconds left. After the Friars had the initial two baskets of the game, the Irish – mainly behind Abromaitis’ quick start – made things look easy offensively. Notre Dame went on a 14-2 run over the next 3:21 with Abromaitis scoring 12 points.\n\n2. Fighting Irish football legend Paul Hornung will return to the Notre Dame campus this summer as he will be a featured guest for one day at the 2011 Notre Dame Football Fantasy Camp. Hornung will speak to the campers as well as bearound for an entire day interacting with this year’s group including signing autographs and snapping photos with camp participants. Other Notre Dame legends already announced to attend include Joe Theismann and Jerome Bettis. The Notre Dame Football Fantasy Camp will be directed by Irish head coach Brian Kelly, as well as his entire Notre Dame coaching staff, current Irish players and plenty of other former Notre Damelegends. They will provide daily hands-on instruction and interaction. They also will share priceless personal experiences from their time under the Golden Dome and in the NFL. Camp dates are Tuesday, May 31, through Saturday, June 4, 2011. Participants will stay at the Fairfield Inn & Suites located across thestreet from campus and adjacent to the new Eddy Street Commons, and mere steps from the shadow of Notre Dame Stadium. In order to maximize the experience of each participant, there is a limited number of spaces available for the 2011 Notre Dame Fantasy Football Camp and the camp is expected to sell out in the near future. An outstanding all-around athlete who played quarterback, lefthalfback, fullback and safety, Hornung remains the only player from a losingteam (Notre Dame finished 2-8 in ’56) ever to win the Heisman Trophy.\n\nWednesday, February 23, 2011\n\n1. Zach Brenneman, a senior midfielder on the Notre Dame men’s lacrosse team, has been named the BIG EAST Offensive Player of the Week for his career-high five-point performance in a 12-7 season-opening victory over No. 5 Duke on Sunday. Brenneman (East Hampton, N.Y./East Hampton) tallied three goals and two assists versus the Blue Devils. This is Brenneman’s first-ever BIG EAST player-of-the-week accolade. Brenneman’s first goal gave Notre Dame a 7-4 lead late in the third quarter. He ignited a 4-0 Irish run in the fourth quarter by scoring the first two goals of the surge and assisting on the third. He also assisted on the final goal of the game. The senior captain has registered a hat trick in three straight games dating back to last season. Brenneman has nine career hat tricks, including three versus Duke over the course of the past two seasons. Brenneman was tabbed as the 2011 BIG EAST Preseason Offensive Player of the Year in addition to being a preseason All-American. He was selected fifth overall by the Long Island Lizards in January’s Major League Lacrosse draft.\n\n2. Bracketology from CBS Sports this week projects the Irish men’s basketball team to Chicago as a #3 NCAA seed to play #14 Bucknell, with #6 Missouri and #11 Harvard in the other game.\n\n3. Former Irish football defensive back Ray Herring is now a graduate assistant and recruiting coordinator at Florida Tech while he pursues an MBA at the Melbourne, Fla., school. Herring is a 2010 Notre Dame graduate.\n\n4. As part of the celebration of the final full season of Notre Dame hockey at the Joyce Center, former coaches, players, administrators and fans have gotten together to select an 18-man All-Joyce Center team that covers the 43-year history (1968-2011) of the home of Irish hockey. Earlier this winter, all-decade teams were selected, covering four eras of Irish hockey – 1968-1980, 1980-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000 through 2010. The first and second teams that were selected then went to a ballot that Irish hockey fans were able to vote on from Jan. 24 through Feb. 20 and now the final totals are in. With the assistance of over 7,000 fan votes that provided full ballots, selecting three goaltenders, six defensemen and nine forwards, the three All-Joyce Center teams were selected.\n\nYesterday, the third team was announced, followed by the second team on Thursday, with the first team announcement coming on Saturday, Feb. 26, at the final regular-season home game at the Joyce Center.

His 56 career wins were a Notre Dame record that stood until 2009.\n\nTwo outstanding blue liners who played the game well at both ends of the ice represent the third-team defense. Jeff Brownschidle ’81, from East Amherst, N.Y., was a first team selection on the 1980-90 all-Decade Team and followed in his brother Jack’s footsteps to play in 146 games at Notre Dame, beginning in 1977.

Four Notre Dame fencers concluded competition at the 2011United States Fencing Association (USFA) Junior Olympics Monday at the Dallas Convention Center. Michael Rossi (men’s epee) and Abigail Nichols (women’s sabre) both placed in the top 10 of their respective weapons. Rossi ended the four-day event in seventh place overall in men’s epee. He advanced first out of his pool with a perfect 6-0 record and a +17 indicator, seeding him 13th in the direct elimination rounds. The freshman advanced into the table of eight with a convincing 15-7 victory over Alen Hadzic, before falling to Logan Cros Koester in the quarterfinals, 15-11. James Kaull also competed with Rossi in men’s epee competition, finishing 12th overall and just missing out on the table of eight after a 15-8 loss to Edward Kelly.

The four Irish combatants and their fellow teammates return to the strip March 5-6 at the Midwest Fencing Championships, which the team plays host to at the Joyce Center Fieldhouse.\n\n6. Notre Dame’s constant layup drill and upsized shooting percentage paid big dividends against West Virginia. Natalie Novosel scored 22 points and the No. 8/7 Irish overcame 30 turnovers to beat the No. 19/18 Mountaineers 72-60 Tuesday night in women’s basketball in Morgantown, W.Va. The Irish (23-5, 12-2 BIG EAST) saw their nine-game winning streak end in a 78-57 loss at No. 2 Connecticut on Saturday in which they shot just 36 percent from the floor. Notre Dame bounced back against West Virginia, hitting 58 percent of its field goals to make those turnovers seem less painful. Twenty-two of Notre Dame’s 30 baskets came on layups and the nation’s sixth-best offense more than handled the fifth-best scoring defense. Devereaux Peters added 16 points and Skylar Diggins and Becca Bruszewski each scored 10 for the Irish (23-5, 12-2 Big East). Sarah Miles scored 16 points and Madina Ali added 12 for West Virginia (21-7, 7-7). The Mountaineers trailed by double digits for most of the second half and fell for the fourth time in five games. The Irish didn’t need any help from their bench. The starters scored all but five points and Notre Dame outrebounded West Virginia 40-31. West Virginia had 16 steals but committed 23 turnovers, shot just 35 percent (24 of 68) from the floor and made only 10 of 18 free throws. Notre Dame kept its attack-the-basket mantra going after building a 13-point halftime lead. Ali, who’s been bothered by a stress fracture in her lower leg most of the season, played just 4 minutes in the first half but answered after the break with hit a 3-pointer and a layup 27 seconds apart to bring West Virginia within 53-44 with 11 minutes left. Peters then made a layup, Brittany Mallory followed with a 3-pointer and Notre Dame kept its lead in double digits therest of the game. Peters scored the final six points of a 13-1 run that put the Irish ahead 28-14 with 5:54 left in the half. West Virginia went 6 minutes between field goals before Miles hit the Mountaineers’ final three baskets and they trailed 38-25 at halftime. Notre Dame shot 65 percent (15 of 23) from the floor in the first half and beat West Virginia for the 18th time in 20 all-time meetings.\n\nNotre Dame picked up its fourth win over a ranked opponent this season. The Fighting Irish collected their first road win at a Top 25 opponent since Nov. 19, 2009, when they edged No. 21 Michigan State, 68-67 in East Lansing, Mich. This marked the largest margin of victory for Notre Dame on the road at a ranked opponent since Feb. 16, 2008, when it posted a 79-67 win at No. 21/23 Syracuse. The Fighting Irish reached a program milestone on Tuesday, becoming just the third BIG EAST Conference school to record 200 BIG EAST regular-season victories, improving to 200-62 (.763) in less than 16 seasons as a conference member (1995-96 to present); BIG EAST charter members Connecticut (377) andVillanova (250) are the only other BIG EAST schools with at least 200 regular-season conference wins. The Notre Dame senior class collectively recorded its 99thcareer win (now 99-29, .773), with an opportunity to reach the century mark Saturday on Senior Day vs. Cincinnati at Purcell Pavilion. How uncharacteristic was Notre Dame’s 30-turnover night? It was the most by the Fighting Irish in a single game since Nov. 15, 2003, when they had a similar 30 giveaways in a 67-63 overtime loss at 20th-ranked Colorado in the title game of the WBCA Classic.\n\n7. Due to current conditions at Everett Memorial Stadium, as well as the forecast of continued precipitation over the next 48 hours, the baseball coaches for Seattle University and the University of Notre Dame have agreed to adjust the schedule for this weekend’s series. The teams will no longer play a game Friday night at Everett Memorial Stadium. The series will begin with adoubleheader at noon PT on Saturday, Feb. 26, at Bannerwood Park in Bellevue. The three-game series will still conclude with a single game at noon PT on Sunday, Feb. 27, also at Bannerwood Park. All three games can still be heard live in South Bend on WHME / Harvest 103.1 FM and worldwide on UND.com.\n\n8. The 15th-ranked Notre Dame women’s golf team Tuesday concluded the Central District Invitational in 10th place (904/+40) after two days of competition at the River Wilderness Golf Club in Parrish, Fla. Freshman Nicole Zhang (Calgary, Alberta/Bishop Carroll) finished tied for 10th place by registering a three-under par 69 in the final round of the tournament which brought her three-round total 219 (+3). Zhang logged five birdies in her final 18-holes and bested her first-round score by seven strokes and her second-round total by five strokes. The overall finish marked Zhang’s fifth top-10 showing in less than one full season at Notre Dame. Senior So-Hyun Park (Seoul, South Korea/Bradenton Prep Academy) continued to improve her score in each round. Beginning the invite with a 77 (+5), Park carded a 76 (+4) in the second round before concluding the tournament with a 75 (+3). Park’s 12-over total of 228 placed her in a tie for 41st. Junior Becca Huffer (Denver, Colo./Littleton) registered a 229 (+13) and finished tied for 45th. Huffer carded two birdies in the final round, one on the par-four fourth hole and another on the par-five 15th hole.

Each member of the Irish lineup improved her score in the final round of the tournament. No. 16 Iowa State claimed the tournament crown. The Cyclones registered a five-under par 283 on the day and a three-round total of 868 (+4).

With Austin Carr headed to the Joyce Center Saturday to be added to the Purcell Pavilion Ring of Honor, the Dish remembers watching the Notre Dame freshman men’s team defeat Michigan State 136-88 back in 1967-68 as Carr scored 52 points and Collis Jones added 25. Carr’s effort qualified as the most points ever scored in any basketball game ever played at the old Notre Dame Fieldhouse. Carr actually set all his varsity scoring records, amazingly, in two and a half seasons (freshmen were not eligible then, plus he missed half his sophomore campaign with a broken foot) and with no three-point field goal in play.\n\n10. With the NFL Combine happening this week in Indianapolis, here’s how some of the former Irish players stand. Lindy’s has tight end Kyle Rudolph as the 30th best player overall – and predicts in its mock draft that Rudolph will go to Buffalo as the second pick in the second round. The magazine has Rudolph rated as the #1 tight end, Robert Hughes #8 among fullbacks and Ian Williams #14 among defensive tackles. Williams is predicted as a fourth-rounder, while Hughes is listed as a likely free agent. The Pro Football Weekly 2011 Draft Guide has Hughes #6 among fullbacks, Rudolph the #1 tight end, Chris Stewart #22 among offensive guards and Williams #17 among defensive tackles.\n\n11. The Kickoff puts NotreDame’s 2011 football recruiting class 10th nationally, with Irish signees averaging 3.66 stars.\n\n12.

Today’s version of Bracketology on the USCHO college hockey site projects the Irish as the #10 overall seed, playing #7 Minnesota-Duluth in Green Bay. The other side of the Green Bay bracket projects #2 North Dakotaversus #15 Western Michigan. Other projected CCHA entrants are #6 Michigan to Manchester (N.H.) and #12 Miami to St. Louis.\n\nTuesday, February 22, 2011\n\n1. Freshman goaltender Steven Summerhays (Anchorage, Alaska) has been named the CCHA rookie of the week for his play in Notre Dame’s weekend sweep at Ferris State on Feb. 18-19. This marks the ninth week this season that a Notre Dame player has been named the conference rookie of the week. Summerhays, who has a personal three-game unbeaten streak (2-0-1) dating back to Jan. 29, stopped a career-best 29 shots in the 5-2 Irish win at Ferris State on Feb. 19. Both goals that the freshman goaltender surrendered came on Bulldog power-play chances. The win improved Summerhays to 5-2-1 on the season with a 3.01 goals-against average and a .858 save percentage. In his three-game unbeaten streak that covers his last three starts, the 6-0, 193-pound goaltender has surrendered just five goals for a1.62 goals-against average and has stopped 55-of-60 shots for a .917 save percentage.\n\n2.

Notre Dame freshman 1B Trey Mancini and senior OF Herman Petzold were each honored on Monday following stellar weekends at the 2011 BIG EAST/Big Ten Challenge. Mancini was named to the BIG EAST Weekly Honor Roll and earned honorable mention all-BIG EAST/Big Ten Challenge, while Petzold was named first team all-BIG EAST/Big Ten Challenge presented by CollegeBaseball360.com. Petzold(Saint Clair Shores, Mich.) entered last weekend with exactly three base hits and no RBI in 10 at-bats over 11 career games – all of the bench. He also had played exclusively as a middle infielder, but Petzold started the season opener against Michigan State in right field and performed as if he has played hisentire career there. He batted .417 (5-for-12) with a walk, hit by pitch, sacrifice bunt, two doubles, three runs scored and five RBI in three startsagainst Michigan State, Purdue and Penn State. Petzold also played a flawless right field. He recorded four put outs without an error. Without a doubt, Petzold’s biggest hit of the weekend came in the 19-2 rout of Purdue. With the Irish trailing 2-0 in the top of the third inning, Petzold drilled an 0-2 offering into the left centerfield gap for a one-out, three-run double to give Notre Dame a 3-2 lead. Notre Dame continued the momentum with an 11-run fourth inning and never looked back. He went 3-for-6 against the Boilermakers with two runs scored and four RBI – career-bests in hits, at-bats, runs scored and RBI. Mancini (Winter Haven, Fla.), who was plunked in a pinch-hit appearance in the season opener against Michigan State, started the final two games of the BIG EAST/Big Ten Challenge. He proceeded to hit .500 (4-for-8) with a stolen base, sacrifice fly, triple, home run, three runs scored and three RBI over his first two career starts. Mancini went 1-for-3 with a run scored, stolen base and RBI sacrifice fly in the victory over Purdue. He backed up his debut performance with an even better one against Penn State. Mancini went 3-for-5 with a triple, solo home run, two runs scored and two RBI. His home run was the fifth of six over the 24 games in the challenge.\n\n4. Notre Dame junior outfielder Alexa Maldonado was named the BIG EAST Conference Softball Player of the week, as announced by the league Monday afternoon. Maldonado played a key role in leading Notre Dame to a 5-0 record at last week’s UCF Invitational, as the program is off to its best start to open a season since 2001. The Millburn, N.J., native went 7-for-14 from the dish with three hits for extra bases (double, triple, home run) for a slugging pct. of .929 during the invitational. She also scored six times while driving in six more runs. An all-BIG EAST selection in 2010, Maldonado had two multi-hit contests, three multi-RBI contests and scored in four of six games on the week. Furthermore, her five flawless putouts extended her streak of games without an error to 106 (last error came during the third week of her 2009 freshman campaign). Also earning recognition from the league was freshman pitcher Laura Winter, who was a part of the conference’s weekly honor roll. On the first day of her collegiate career, Winter earned a win and a save without surrendering an earned run in just 3.1 innings of work in outings against Miami (Ohio) and UCF. She gave up five hits – only one for extra bases – and one run in 8.1 frames of work over three appearances for a 0.84 ERA and a 2-0 record. Winter had two games with more than five strikeouts, one of which came in 2.1 innings in the season-opener with Miami (Ohio).\n\n5. The No. 15 Notre Dame women’s golf team concluded the first two rounds of the Central District Invitational in a tie for 11th place with a first round 303 and second round 308, making the Irish +35 Monday at the River Wilderness Course in Parrish, Fla.

Irish standout Tim Abromaitis (Unionville, Conn.) has been named to the Capital One Academic All-America Men’s Basketball first team for the second consecutive year. Abromaitis becomes the first Notre Dame men’s basketball player to earn first-team Academic All-America honors in back-to-back seasons since Pat Garrity in 1997 and 1998. To be eligible, a student-athlete must be a varsity starter or key reserve, maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.30 on a scale of 4.00, have reached sophomore athletic and academic standings at his/her current institution and be nominated by his/her sports information director. Currently, Abromaitis is enrolled in a one-year intensified MBA program within the Mendoza College of Business and has a 3.615 grade-point average. He graduated one full year ahead of his class in May 2010 from theMendoza College of Business with a degree in finance. A three-time member ofthe Dean’s List, he earned a 3.72 grade index over his eight semesters. Joining Abromaitis on the five-man first team were Devon Beitzel of Northern Colorado, Matt Howard of Butler, Tyrell Reed of Kansas and Tyler Zeller of North Carolina. In addition to earning first-team honors, Howard was selected as the men’s basketball Academic All-American of the Year.\n\nAbromaitis becomes just the fourth player in program history to earnfirst team Academic All-America honors on multiple occasions. In addition toGarrity, Bob Arnzen and John Paxson were both multi-year first-team honorees. Arnzen ranks as Notre Dame’s only three-time Academic All-America honoree as he garnered first-team recognition in 1967, 1968 and 1969, while Paxson earnedfirst-team recognition in both 1982 and 1983. Notre Dame’s other men’s basketball Academic All-America honorees include: Gary Novak (second team in 1972 and first team in 1974); Kelly Tripucka (first team in 1979); Rich Branning (first team in 1980) and Chris Quinn (first team in 2006). In all,Notre Dame has had eight different players in the 106-year history of the men’s basketball program garner Academic All-America recognition on 14 occasions. Abromaitis is the third Notre Dame student-athlete during the 2010-11 school year to be named an Academic All-American. Irish kicker David Ruffer was a first-team football selection, while All-American Lauren Fowlkes earned a spot on the women’s soccer first team. Overall, Notre Dame ranks second all-time in thenumber of Academic All-Americans it has produced with 219.\n\nCurrently, Abromaitis is averaging 14.1 points as Notre Dame’s second-leading scorer, and a career-best 6.3 rebounds. Last season, he averaged 16.1 points and 4.7 rebounds. He is 50 points shy of becoming the 51st player in Notre Dame history to score 1,000 career points. Abromaitis has played in 73 career outings in an Irish uniform and been in the starting lineup on 52 occasions. He has scored in double figures in 49 career outings, and in 17 of those contests, has registered 20-plus points. Abromaitis has scored 30 or more points on two occasions, grabbed 10-plus rebounds four times and recorded three career doubles. This season, he was named MVP in November at the 2010 Old Spice Classic as Notre Dame claimed the team title with wins over Georgia, California and Wisconsin. Abromaitis’ Irish are currently ranked ninth in both the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today rankings with a 21-5 record overall and 10-4 mark in BIG EAST play, good for second place in the regular-season standings. He also has been named to the BIG EAST’s Weekly Honor Roll on two occasions this season.

This Notre Dame-Duke men’s lacrosse matchup wasn’t for the national championship like the one last May was. But this convincing Irish win was plenty satisfying for a season opener on a perfect 75-degree day in Jacksonville, Fla.

Howard gave a valiant effort as he dove head first across the finish line to earn all-BIG EAST honors.\n\nPatrick Feeney (Indianapolis, Ind./New Palestine) earned his first BIG EAST title at his first conference meet, winning the 400-meter dash in 48.11. The freshman defeated Villanova’s Carlton Bowers who finished in 48.37. In the men’s 3,000-meter run, Carlson earned his second all-BIG EAST honor of the day after taking second place in 8:20.52. Senior Denes Veres (Ellwood City, Pa./Riverside) earned BIG EAST honors in the shot put. The senior had a throw of 17.33m to earn the honor, his sixth of his Notre Dame field career. The Irish return home for the Alex Wilson Invitational Fri. and Sat., March 4-5.\n\n4. Meeting for the second time in three days, Notre Dame defeated Miami (Ohio), 4-1, Sunday at the UCF Softball Complex in Orlando, Fla. The victory wrapped up a 5-0 season-opening weekend for Notre Dame in claiming the UCF Invite title by rolling through the competition. The Irish allowed eight earned runs through five contests while out-scoring opponents, 27-8. Much of that offensive spark came behind the efforts of Alexa Maldonado, whose deep, deep, deep fourth-inning home run against the Redhawks not only plated a pair of Irish runs, but went down as her third hit for extra bases on the weekend. Maldonado’s junior season picked up right where the 2010 all-BIG EAST selection left off, as she hit .500 (7-for-14) and scored six times while driving in six runs. The lefty slapper also stole two bases while connecting for one double, triple and home run in the tournament. Six hits were recorded by Amy Buntin, Dani Miller and Alexia Clay, as Heather Johnson drove in five scores on four hits.\n\nJody Valdivia held the Redhawks (3-2) to six hits and one earned run in the complete-game effort for her second win of the season. The reigning BIGEAST Pitcher of the Year was matched at the tournament by first-year tosserLaura Winter, who logged a 0.84 ERA in 8.1 innings across three appearanceswhile earning two wins and a save. Brittany O’Donnell earned Notre Dame’s fifth win after tossing 5.0 innings of one-hit ball. The Irish made quick work of the Redhawks by scoring one run in each of the first two innings. Katie Fleury’s sacrifice moved Maldonado to second, and the speedster then scored on Miller’s single up the middle. Buntin’s second-inning single scored Brianna Jorgensborg, who led off the inning with a double, to make it a 2-0 contest. Notre Dame left two ducks on the pond in the third but cashed in a pair of scores in the fourth on Maldonado’s home run, the sixth of her career. Miami (Ohio) used consecutive hits to begin the fifth to score its only run. The Redhawks left seven runners stranded. Jessica Simpson (2-2) gave up eight Irish hits in 6.0 innings. Each of Notre Dame’s four runs were earned. Next up for Notre Dame will be four games Feb. 26-27 at the College of Charleston Invite. The Irish open the event Saturday at 2:00 p.m. (ET) against the host Cougars.\n\n5. Senior RHP Todd Miller tossed a career-high 6.1 innings and struck out a career-best six to help Notre Dame knock off Penn State, 8-5, in its third and final game from the 2011 BIG EAST/Big Ten Baseball Challenge at the Walter Fuller Baseball Complex Sunday morning. After dropping their season opener to Michigan State (2-1), the Irish closed the weekend with back-to-back victories over Purdue and Penn State. Miller, who missed just over seven weeks last season with a shoulder injury, improved to 1-0 on the year. The right-handed hurler scattered seven hits and allowed three earned runs in his first start of 2011. Miller did not issue a walk alongside his six strikeouts. He tossed 93 pitches, 68 for strikes. Freshman LHP Anthony McIver and junior RHP Will Hudgins came out of the bullpen and slammed the door shut. McIver tossed 1.2 scoreless innings of relief with three strikeouts and Hudgins needed just 10 pitches to strikeout the side in the ninth. He picked up his first save of the season and fourth of his career.\n\nFreshman 1B Trey Mancini paced Notre Dame at the plate. The rookie went 3-for-5 with a couple runs scored and two RBI, including a solo home run – the first of his career. Mancini added a double and finished just a double shy of the cycle. Sophomore 2B Frank DeSico was the only other Irish player with amulti-hit effort. He went 2-for-4 with an RBI. Freshman LF Eric Jagielo scored two runs, while senior RF Herman Petzold reached base three times and chipped in a run scored and RBI. Penn State, just as Michigan State and Purdue on Friday and Saturday, grabbed the first lead of the game. The Nittany Lions used a leadoff triple from Sean Deegan. After Miller picked up his first strikeout of the season, Jordan Steranka followed with an RBI single through the right side to give Penn State a 1-0 lead. Steranka moved into scoring position following Miller’s wild pitch, but the righty retired the final two batters of the inning to keep the deficit one run. Miller settled into a nice groove over the second and third innings. He sent down eight consecutive Penn State batters and allowed the Irish offense to grab the lead.\n\nNotre Dame took advantage of a pair of Nittany Lions errors in a five-run third inning. Senior DH David Casey led off the inning with a walk and advanced to second base following junior CF Alex Robinson’s sacrifice bunt.Senior SS Mick Doyle followed with a routine fly ball to centerfield, but Deegan, the Penn State centerfielder, dropped the ball, which not only allowed Casey to score, but Doyle raced all the way to third base. Petzold followedwith another routine fly ball to center that Deegan lost in the sun for a double, which gave the Irish a 2-1 lead. Jagielo then reached base on an error, which allowed another run to score. After sophomore C Joe Hudson lined out,Mancini tripled in a run to give the Irish a 4-1 lead and DeSico made it 5-1with an RBI single.\n\nPenn State clawed back with a pair of unearned runs in the top of the fourth inning to cut the Irish lead to 5-3, but Miller was able to evade any significant damage. He then retired the Nittany Lions in order in the fifth and sixth innings before maybe running out of gas in the seventh. With Notre Dame holding a 7-3 advantage, Penn State drew within two runs, 7-5, after seventh inning doubles from Ryan Clark and Deegan, but McIver got the final two outs of the inning and cruised in the eighth inning. Hudgins was almost perfect in the ninth inning. The sidewinder struck out the side on just 10 pitches. Hudgins nearly tossed an immaculate inning – an inning with three strikeouts on nine pitches.\n\nNotre Dame returns to action next weekend with a three-game series in the Great Northwest against Seattle University. The Irish and Redhawks open the weekend set at 6:00 p.m. PT on Friday at Everett Memorial Stadium in Everett, Wash. The final two games of the series will be played at Bannerwood Park in Bellevue, Wash.\n\n6. Notre Dame sophomore guard Skylar Diggins (South Bend, Ind./Washington) is among a group of 11 players who have been selected as semifinalists for the 2011 Nancy Lieberman Award, given to the nation’s top point guard, it was announced Saturday by the award’s organizer, the Rotary Club of Detroit. Diggins is the only underclass player among the 11 remaining nominees, joining eight seniors and two juniors in contention for this year’s award. Diggins is the first Notre Dame player to be chosen as a Nancy Lieberman Award semifinalist since All-American Megan Duffy in 2006, and the third since the award’s inception in 2001 (when another Notre Dame All-American and currentFighting Irish assistant coach Niele Ivey was a finalist). This year’s 11 nominees were selected by a panel of sportswriters from around the country,based on the criteria of floor leadership, play-making and ball-handling skills that personified Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame selection Nancy Lieberman during her career. That same sportswriter panel will choose the three finalists and this year’s award recipient during the weekend of the NCAA Women’s Final Four (April 3-5), with the recipient to attend an awards luncheon on April 27 at the Detroit Athletic Club.\n\n7. You can’t ask for a better finish than this: The CCHA regular-season title comes down to the last weekend, with Notre Dame holding a one-point lead over Michigan, with both teams having two games left to play. The Irish play a home-and-home series with fourth-place Western Michigan – while Michigan plays both its games on the road at fifth-place Northern Michigan. Notre Dame already has guaranteed itself a bye in the first round of the CCHA playoffs (March 4-5-6) and will play host to a second-round series at the Joyce Center March 11-12-13.\n\n8. Winner of five straight to open the season, the Notre Dame softball team is off to its best start since 2001… that season’s squad rattled off eight straight wins to start the season en route to earning a program-record 54 victories.\n\n9. Andy Katz on ESPN.com today suggests that the national coach of the year in men’s college basketball should come from the BIG EAST – and he mentions UConn’s Jim Calhoun, Notre Dame’s Mike Brey, Louisville’s Rick Pitino and Steve Lavin of St. John’s as names that should be finalists.\n\n10. Jay Bilas on ESPN.com lists Notre Dame’s Ben Hansbrough as one of his”most-respected players” for this season, saying, “A worker who keeps his head down and keeps coming at you, Hansbrough has quietly joined the front-runners for Big East Player of the Year. He is skilled, strong willed, tenacious and never gives in to fatigue. He just keeps running and keeps competing. He scores and takes big shots, but he is also willing to trail Connecticut’s Kemba Walker around for 40 minutes. Hansbrough does the tough stuff, prepares like a pro and does it all without complaining.”\n\n11. The SI.com ranking of top 50 NFL draft prospects has Notre Dame’s Kyle Rudolph 50th overall.\n\n12. Former Irish #1 men’s tennis player Mike Sprouse has written the just-released book “The Greatness Gap” – with a subtitle of “Personal Strategies to Boost Your Professional Potential.” The foreword is by former Irish football coach Lou Holtz, the afterword by current Irish men’s tennis coach Bobby Bayliss. Sprouse played for Notre Dame from 1993-96, qualified for the NCAA singles bracket in ’95 and ’96 and for NCAA doubles in ’95.\n\n13. Today’s ESPN Bracketology from Joe Lunardi has the Notre Dame men a #3 seed in Denver against #14 Bucknell, with #6 Texas A&M and #11 Michigan State facing off opposite. Today’s SI.com projected bracket has the Irish a #3 seed in Chicago playing #14 Kent State, with #6 Texas A&M and #11 Butler/Memphis opposite.\n\n14. The Notre Dame’s men’s basketball game Saturday against Seton Hall – at which Austin Carr will be added to the Purcell Pavilion Ring of Honor – is sold out.\n\n15.

If you are planning to make the journey to Kansas or if you have any questions, email RockneMemorial@gmail.com or call Pat Reis at 612-636-3905.\n\n16. The Notre Dame men’s basketball team is 7-1 in its last eight games. The only other BIG EAST team that can say that is Georgetown.\n\n17. Notre Dame men’s tennis head coach Bobby Bayliss is set to be inducted into the Blue Gray Hall of Fame on Friday, Feb. 25, in Montgomery,Ala., as decided by the Blue Gray committee members. The Blue Gray Tournament is 62 years old, making it the second-oldest college tennis tournament after the NCAA Championship. Bayliss’ teams have brought home three championships (1993, 2001 and 2007) from the Montgomery, Ala. event. Bayliss, who is in his 24th season as the head coach at Notre Dame and his 41st season overall, spending 15 seasons at Navy and three seasons at Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, has a reputation of being a top-tier collegiate tennis coach. His testament to collegiate tennis is obvious as there have been few others whohave turned out as many standout student-athletes, have had as much team success and have earned as many honors as Bayliss. The veteran coach has led the Irish to 19 NCAA Championship appearances in the past 20 seasons, including 10 top-20 finishes. In 1992 he led his team to the NCAA title match. His teams have won 14 BIG EAST titles in 22 seasons, he has been named the national coach of the year on two occasions and is a five-time Midwest Regional coach of the year. Bayliss is fourth among active coaches in career victories, tallying over 700 wins during his coaching career. Although his tennis accomplishments are impressive, chairman of the Blue Gray committee Paul Winn says it is Bayliss’ character that sets him apart. “There has been no one else as loyal to the Blue Gray Tournament as Coach Bayliss,” says Winn. “Notre Dame has been coming to the Tournament the past 20 years and Bob is always so easy to work with. He and his team are so respectful, polite and appreciative of all we do for them. They have become such a hit in Montgomery that we have families fighting over who gets to keep Notre Dame.”\n\nSunday, February 20, 2011\n\n1. Notre Dame freshman hockey goaltender Steven Summerhays had a career-high 29 saves and the Irish got goals from five different players on the way to a 5-2 win over Ferris State Saturday night at a sold-out Ewigleben Arena on Senior Night for the Bulldogs in Big Rapids, Mich. Ben Ryan, Joe Lavin, David Gerths, Nick Larson and Calle Ridderwall scored for Notre Dame while Scott Czarnowczan and Aaron Schmit lit the lamp for Ferris State. The win gives the Irish a four-game winning streak and a seven-game (5-0-2) unbeaten streak that started Jan. 22 at Ohio State. The CCHA road sweep was the second of the season for Notre Dame (also Northern Michigan, Jan. 7-8) and the second consecutive weekend that the Irish have won both games of a series (Bowling Green). Notre Dame improves to 20-9-5 overall and is now 17-6-3-2 in the CCHA, good for 56 points. The win means that the worst the Irish can finish in the CCHA is second place as it eliminates Miami from a shot at the top spot. The Redhawks have 49 points with two games left to play. The Irish go into the final week of the season with a one-point lead on second place Michigan (55) as the Wolverines rallied from a 4-3 deficit, to tie the game with 20 seconds left and then win it with three seconds remaining in overtime Saturday night for a 5-4 win over Western Michigan.\n\n2. The Notre Dame women’s lacrosse team dropped its second consecutive game to a nationally ranked foe on Saturday evening as the Irish fell to second-ranked Northwestern, 14-11, in front of 703 fans indoors at the Loftus Center on the Notre Dame campus. Junior attack Maggie Tamasitis equaled career highs withfive points and four assists to pace the Notre Dame offense. Jenny Granger, Shaylyn Blaney, Kaitlin Keena and Kaitlyn Brosco each had two goals while Kailene Abt and Megan Sullivan joined Tamasitis with one goal each. Erin Fitzgerald led Northwestern with three goals while Jessica Russo, Brooke Matthews, Ali Cassera and Alex Frank had two goals each. Shannon Smith, Alyssa Leonard and Taylor Thornton each added a single goal for the Wildcats. The loss dropped 10th-ranked Notre Dame to 1-2 on the season while Northwestern won its season opener to go to 1-0 on the year. The Wildcats now lead theall-time series versus the Irish, 11-2, with Saturday’s game being the 11th consecutive win, dating back to the 2004 season. While the score was close,Northwestern dominated in the area of possession as they won the battle of the draws, 22-5, versus Notre Dame. This was also a game of runs where each team would take control for periods of time.\n\n3. Notre Dame failed to take advantage of numerous scoring opportunities in a one-run baseball loss to Michigan State on Friday. Safe to say, the Irish more than made up on Saturday. Notre Dame set BIG EAST/Big Ten Challenge single-game records for hits and runs as the Irish routed Purdue,19-2, at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. The victory was the first for new Notre Dame head coach Mik Aoki. Notre Dame totaled 19 runs on 25 hits. The 19 runs bested the previous tournament record of 18 set by St. John’s in 2009. The 25 hits bested the previous mark of 24 set by Louisville against Michigan State in 2010. The 17-run margin of victory also established a newchallenge record. The 19 runs, 25 hits and 17-run margin of victory were all the best for the Irish since Mar. 20, 2008, against Georgetown. Notre Dame routed the Hoyas, 25-1, that afternoon and recorded 28 hits. Junior CF Alex Robinson paced the Irish attack with a career-high five hits. He went 5-for-5 with three runs scored and one RBI. Senior RF Herman Petzold went 3-for-6 with two runs scored and four RBI, including a three-run double. Freshman RF Eric Jagielo went 4-for-6 with two runs scored and four RBI, including a three-run triple. Sophomore C Joe Hudson went 4-for-5 with three runs scored and two RBI. Senior DH Matt Scioscia also chipped in with three hits. He went 3-for-4 with two runs scored and three RBI. Senior RHP Cole Johnson picked up the victory. He allowed two earned runs on six hits in 6.0 innings of work. Johnson struck out four and walked two. Freshmen RHP Sean Fitzgerald and RHP Donnie Hissa combined for 3.0 scoreless innings of relief. Fitzgerald tossed a perfect inning of relief, while Hissa went 2.0 scoreless innings. He struck out one and walked one. Notre Dame spotted the Boilermakers a 2-0 lead, but the Irish scored the final 19 runs of the game, including 11 in a record-setting fourth inning. The 11 runs are the most in a single inning in BIG EAST/Big Ten Challenge history. Notre Dame sent 16 to the plate and registered 10 hits. The Irish have not eclipsed 10 runs in an inning since May 10, 2004, at Connecticut when Notre Dame plated 10 runs in the first inning. Notre Dame returned to action at 10 ET this morning at the Walter Fuller Baseball Complex against Penn State. Senior RHP Todd Miller was slated to take the mound for the Irish.\n\n4. Brittany O’Donnell and Shannon Kelly combined to toss a one-hitter during a five-inning, 11-1 win over Delaware on day two of the UCF Invitational for the Notre Dame softball team. Their efforts followed Saturday’s 4-1 non-conference win over Illinois-Chicago at the UCF Softball Complex in Orlando. Fla. The Irish (4-0) now play Miami (Ohio) at 11:00 a.m. (ET) on Sunday in the final game of the invite. Alexa Maldonado and Dani Miller each totaled three hits on the day as Amy Buntin, Heather Johnson and Alexia Clay chipped in a pair apiece. Miller drove in four runs, one of four Irish players with multiple RBI across the two games. Buntin homered and Maldonado crushed a triple, both of which were season-firsts for Notre Dame.\n\n5. One of the most dominant streaks in BIG EAST Conference history came to an end Saturday evening at Wright Natatorium in Louisville. After winning 14 straight league titles – the most of any team in any league-sponsored sport – the Notre Dame women’s swimming and diving team surrendered the top of the podium to host Louisville, who totaled 820.5 points to earn its first-ever conference crown. But the Irish did not go down without a fight. First-yearstandout Kelly Ryan continued her stellar league debut by having a hand in two more titles as Kim Holden won the 200 back, giving her a clean sweep of the 100 and 200 versions of the race for the second consecutive season. Ryan was victorious in the 100 free and had a hand in the 400 free relay quartet that ended the evening with a golden effort for another league title. Notre Damefinished second with 655.5 points. West Virginia (396) was third and Villanova (395.5) took fourth among the 11-team field.\n\n6. Louisville won its second straight team title Saturday evening at the BIG EAST Swimming and Diving Championships, earning 917 points in the winning effort. Notre Dame (713.5) finished in front of Pittsburgh (503) and West Virginia (470) among the 11-team field at Wright Natatorium in Louisville. Frank Dyer put the finishing touches on his outstanding league meet with a third-place finish in the 100 free. Throughout his first BIG EAST appearance, Dyer shelved four all-BIG EAST citations and an individual title. In all, Notre Dame set six school records throughout the four-day event.\n\n7. The Notre Dame men’s and women’s track and field teams concluded the first day of the BIG EAST Indoor Championships Saturday at the Stile Athletics Field House in Akron, Ohio. The men currently sit in second place with 30 points, while the women are in 10th place (8 points). Junior Kevin Schipper (Leo, Ind./Bishop Dwenger) won the pole vault (5.25m), making it his third-straight BIG EAST pole vault title. A Schipper has won the pole vault at the last five BIG EAST Championships. In addition to Kevin’s title Saturday, he also won both the 2010 indoor and outdoor BIG EAST pole vault titles. Kevin and his brother, Matt, a 2010 Notre Dame graduate combine for five BIG EAST pole vault titles. Greg Davis (Peachtree, Ga./Starr’s Mill) picked up eight points and a second-place finish for the Irish in theweight throw and with a throw of 19.68m the senior earned his fourth all-BIG EAST honor. The Irish will begin action Sunday with the men’s heptathlon at 8:30 a.m. at the Stile Athletic Field House in Akron, Ohio.\n\n8. Check out ESPN at 3 p.m. today for a men’s lacrosse rematch of the 2010 NCAA championship game between Notre Dame and Duke. Thegame is being played in Jacksonville, Fla., at the NFL Jacksonville Jaguars’ stadium. It’s the regular-season opener for the Irish.\n\nSaturday, February 19, 2011\n\n1. Freshman Bria Hartley had been struggling on offense so she changed her approach and just took what she was given. The move worked as she scored a career-high 29 points to help No. 2 Connecticut to a 78-57 win over eighth-ranked Notre Dame in women’s basketball on Saturday in Storrs, Conn. Hartley had been in a little bit of an offensive slump lately, scoring in double figures just once in the last six contests. Maya Moore added 12 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Huskies (26-1, 13-0 Big East), who have won 14 straight since their 90-game winning streak ended at Stanford on Dec. 30. The Huskies, who spent a record 51 weeks atop the poll before that loss, will likely move back to No. 1 on Monday because top-ranked Baylor lost 56-45 toTexas Tech on Saturday. Skylar Diggins scored 22 points and Natalie Novoseladded 18 to lead Notre Dame (22-5, 11-2), which had its nine-game winning streak end. On Jan. 8, UConn rallied for a 79-76 victory over the Irish. Notre Dame had won every game since by at least 15 points and had a week to prepare for this game. One thing that Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw might have noticed during the week was that so many teams get blown out at UConn before the first media timeout. Duke and Oklahoma were already out of their games by the 16-minute mark. McGraw decided to take her team off the court while the Huskies were being introduced. The move paid off as the Irish scored the first seven points before freshman center Stefanie Dolson got the Huskies on the board nearly 2 1/2 minutes in with a hook shot. Notre Dame – wearing its alternate road green uniforms for the first time this season – couldn’t sustain the early wave of momentum as UConn rallied behind the freshmen. Dolson and Hartley combined for 18 of the team’s first 24 points. Hartley’s 3-pointer gave UConn its first lead at 17-16. That started a 10-1 spurt in which Hartley scored the first eight points. Dolson capped it with another hook shot. The Huskies led 37-29 at the half as Diggins kept the Irish in the game with 17 points by the break. That’s the most an opposing player has scored in the first half against the Huskies this season – and more than Providence (12) and Duke (15) put up as a team. Tiffany Hayes and Moore hit back-to-back 3s to start the second half and UConn extended its lead to 23. The Irish couldn’t get within 14 the rest of the game. UConn has won 63 straight Big East games and 76 consecutive overall at home. Devereaux Peters, who had 17 points and 11 rebounds in the earliermeeting, was held scoreless. She picked up two quick fouls and sat out the final 14-plus minutes of the first half.\n\n2. One of Truck Bryant’s best games of the year gave West Virginia the start it needed to a difficult five-game stretch run. Bryant broke out of a slump by scoring 24, West Virginia took command early in the second half and beat No. 8 Notre Dame 72-58 on Saturday, ending the Irish’s seven-game men’s basketball winning streak in Morgantown, W.Va. The Mountaineers (17-9, 8-6 Big East) got a badly needed win against a ranked opponent to prop up their NCAA tournament hopes. West Virginia had been struggling since a 68-64 win over No. 11 Purdue on Jan. 16 that pushed its record to 12-4. The Mountaineers had lost five of nine entering Saturday. None more than Bryant, who single-handedly turned things around after West Virginia shot 29 percent (8 of 28) be"
