Networks of care for maternal and newborn health: an approach to strengthening relational elements for quality and respectful care\n\nKatherine Kalaris1, Allisyn Moran2\n\n1University of Oxford; 2World Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F1.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC96\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DASKP1096\n\nPanel description\n\nDespite global progress in reducing preventable maternal and newborn deaths, high rates of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality continue, mainly due to poor quality of care. Additional transformational and catalytic approaches are needed to provide high-quality respectful patient-centered care to further improve maternal and newborn well-being and survival. One documented successful approach is Networks of Care (NoC).\n\nNoC are an innovative approach to optimize health system functioning, intentionally creating and strengthening health system relationships to support transformational change in maternal and newborn health. NoC emphasize relational elements, such as empowered multidisciplinary teams, respect, teamwork, trust, communication, collaboration, leadership, and supportive supervision and mentorship, which differentiate it from other health systems strengthening approaches. Functional NoC enable collaborative learning and coordinated continuity of respectful and quality care to optimize linkages for efficient and resilient health systems, and to ultimately improve maternal and newborn survival and well-being. Future opportunities include scaling up the NoC approach at national and sub-national levels and addressing gaps in the evidence base.\n\nThe NoC approach has been implemented in many contexts. This panel will provide an overview of the NoC approach, and highlight examples and results of NoC from three countries: Kenya (Makueni County), Nepal (One Heart Worldwide), and Zambia (integrated sexual, reproductive, maternal, and newborn health program).\n\nF1.2. Improving quality of maternal and newborn care through the creation of networks of safety in rural Nepal\n\nSurya Bhatta1, Katherine Kalaris2, Sibylle Kristensen1\n\n1One Heart Worldwide; 2University of Oxford\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F1.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC204\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DASKP1096\n\nBackground\n\nAlthough improvements made in maternal and newborn health (MNH) have increased maternal and neonatal survival in Nepal, challenges remain for the country to reach Stage V of the obstetric transition. The international nongovernmental organization One Heart Worldwide (OHW) supports the Government of Nepal’s national plan to provide quality MNH services to pregnant women and their newborns living in rural areas. In collaboration with all levels of the health system, OHW forms Networks of Safety (NoS) to provide quality MNH care in some of Nepal’s most remote and difficult-to-access geographies. These NoS are examples of Networks of Care (NoC). All NoS exhibit core system-strengthening NoC functional elements, such as constructing new birthing centers and providing equipment, along with relational elements such as promoting local ownership, supporting mentorship, and connecting providers from the community level through to tertiary care.\n\nMethods\n\nNoS build local capacity through a participatory model and target infrastructure, local leadership, and local communities over a six-year period. Many network activities are co-financed by the municipalities leveraging a financially sustainable adoption-at-scale solution that addresses the systemic health care access disparities disproportionately affecting mothers and newborns in last-mile environments. NoS also spearhead innovative approaches such as a simulation-based mentorship program to maintain essential clinical skills among rural health care providers and an MNH helpline that supports these providers in clinical decision-making, particularly in emergencies.\n\nResults\n\nIn 2022, OHW’s NoS have been expanded to 28 districts across Nepal, reaching a third of districts in the country. As of today, OHW is implementing NoS in 20 districts, covering a population of 6.6 million with 165,000 annual pregnancies, and has completed the program in eight districts. Since 2010, the NoS have improved quality MNH care for more than 414,000 pregnancies in rural Nepal.\n\nConclusions\n\nOHW’s work shows how NoC are a sustainable approach to provide quality care for MNH in remote and rural areas through innovative strategies and solutions. We will continue to scale and adapt network interventions to ensure access and quality of MNH care and plan to reach 50% of districts by 2030.\n\nF1.3.

Black Mamas Matter Alliance: advancing the black maternal health, rights, and justice movement\n\nAyanna Robinson, Philicia Castillo, Angela Aina\n\nBlack Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F2.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1642\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DBXIN211642\n\nPanel Description\n\nThe United States (U.S.) is experiencing a maternal health crisis. To meet Sustainable Development Goals, many countries are working to decrease their maternal mortality ratios (MMR), currently achieving a 38% global decrease between 2000 and 2017. However, the U.S. continues to report a significant MMR increase and racial inequities with Black women dying at nearly three times the rate of white women. Black birthing women are also twice as likely as white women to experience severe pregnancy complications.\n\nThe Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA), founded in 2016, serves as a national voice and coordinating entity for stakeholders advancing Black maternal health, rights, and justice. We envision a world where Black Mamas have the rights, respect, and resources to thrive before, during, and after pregnancy. BMMA believes that community empowerment and mobilization are vital to its strategy to involve small-scale organizations, health workers, and everyday citizens interacting to increase education and engagement in preventive health promotion activities. Our approach utilizes the strengths of doulas, midwives, and other skilled maternal health actors working with the communities they serve.\n\nThis panel will provide an overview of BMMA; the work conducted within our four key pillars of policy, research, care, and culture shift; and the impact on maternal health in the U.S. Speakers will describe BMMA’s process for leveraging Black women’s lived experiences and scholarship to decolonize research, develop policy priorities, identify principles for holistic maternity care, and apply BMMA’s research principles across a variety of projects addressing Black maternal health.\n\nF2.2. Conducting research with, for, and by black birthing people and researchers: operationalizing black mamas matter alliance’s research principles\n\nSang Hee Won, Philicia Castillo, Ayanna Robinson, Angela Aina\n\nBlack Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F2.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1670\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DBXIN211642\n\nBackground\n\nBlack women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women in the United States (U.S.). Yet, research to understand the underlying causes of the inequities have historically marginalized and neglected Black birthing people. The Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA), a national network of Black women-led organizations and professionals, developed best practices for conducting research with, for, and by Black Mamas to redefine how research can, and should, be done in the U.S. to improve Black maternal health outcomes.\n\nMethods\n\nSince 2017, BMMA has been applying its research principles to projects dedicated to addressing inequities in maternal health in the U.S. Two such projects include research examining the role of disrespectful maternity care among Black women in Atlanta, Georgia, and increasing community engagement efforts within state and local maternal mortality review processes. Key activities have included centering community needs, voices, and experts to lead the research; utilizing its alliance structure to uplift Black researchers; instituting regular feedback loops with communities participating in the research; and prioritizing communities in the dissemination of results.\n\nResults\n\nApplying these research principles has enabled BMMA to be responsive to community needs and embrace communities as equal partners in the conduct of research. Key results include elevating the voices of Black birthing people to share their experiences with disrespectful maternity care; empowering communities most affected to provide direct feedback to government entities and funders who have dictated how maternal mortality reviews should be done; and centering community-driven, innovative approaches to improving maternal health in the U.S.\n\nConclusions\n\nBMMA’s research principles have led to a paradigm shift in how research is done with, for, and by Black Mamas. Application of the principles has transformed the ways in which research and programming around maternal health have traditionally been done in the U.S. by shifting decision-making power and ownership to communities that know best what they need. It has reframed the narrative of Black maternal health from that of deficit to asset-based thinking whereby the communities most affected have the expertise and solutions to fully address inequities in maternal health.\n\nF2.3. Often discussed, but never consulted: leveraging the expertise of the black perinatal workforce, scholars, and birthing people to develop principles and priorities addressing the maternal mortality crisis in the United States\n\nPhilicia Castillo, Ayanna Robinson, Sang Hee Won, Angela Aina\n\nBlack Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F2.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1656\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DBXIN211642\n\nBackground\n\nThe United States (U.S.) is experiencing a maternal health crisis with maternal mortality ratios increasing over the last 20 years and disproportionately affecting Black women who are dying from largely preventable causes at three times the rate of white women. Addressing this crisis requires maternal health care, policy, and research that is led by the group most affected but often left out of solution creation, Black birthing people. Recognizing this equity, the Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA) created working groups that use strategies grounded in Black birthing people’s lived experience, wisdom, and leadership to advance care, change policy, and cultivate research. These working groups created principles and priorities that the perinatal workforce, researchers, advocates, funders, and other stakeholders can use as guiding posts to combat maternal mortality and collectively achieve Black maternal health, rights, and justice.\n\nMethods\n\nBetween 2017 and 2019, BMMA convened alliance partners who are leading experts in maternal and reproductive health and created three working groups: Holistic Care, Policy, and Research. The working groups consisted of Black perinatal professionals, research scholars, policy professionals, and advocates. The groups assessed the current landscape of maternal, sexual, and reproductive health care, policy, and research, and identified gaps.\n\nResults\n\nPrinciples were created for achieving holistic maternity care, engaging in equitable research with Black communities, and advancing policy priorities grounded in frameworks around reproductive justice and human rights to improve Black maternal health outcomes. Each working group published a report with historical background and framing of the current public health problem that is the maternal mortality crisis among Black birthing people with a set of principles and priorities for widespread use.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe holistic care and research principles and policy priorities created by BMMA take a multi-pronged approach to equipping the perinatal workforce, researchers, advocates, funders, and other stakeholders with the tools and guidelines to collectively support Black Mamas and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. These principles and priorities are leading the way in a paradigm shift that highlights the expertise Black scholars and the perinatal workforce possess, while supporting and centering Black Mamas in care, policy, and research practices and decisions in the U.S. and globally.\n\nF2.4. Black Mamas Matter Alliance: advancing sexual, reproductive, and maternal health, rights, and justice\n\nAyanna Robinson, Philicia Castillo, Sang Hee Won, Angela Aina\n\nBlack Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F2.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1645\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DBXIN211642\n\nBackground\n\nThe maternal mortality ratio for Black women in the United States is two to three times greater than white women, with 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that 80% of these deaths are preventable, acknowledging the role of racism and the need to address disparities in pregnancy-related mortality. The Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA) is a national network of Black women-led organizations and professionals whose work is rooted in the birth/reproductive justice, respectful maternity care, and human rights framework. The alliance is made up of 40 community-based organizations and 25 individual collaborators.\n\nMethods\n\nBMMA approaches our work through four pillars: policy, research, care, and culture shift. We introduce and advance policy grounded in the human rights framework that addresses Black maternal health inequity and improves Black maternal health outcomes [Policy]; leverage talent and knowledge that exist in Black communities and cultivate innovative research methods to generate the evidence base for Black maternal health and inform the policy agenda to improve Black maternal health [Research]; promote holistic and comprehensive care for better outcomes for Black women, their children, families, and ultimately their communities [Care]; and redirect and reframe conversations on Black maternal health and amplify the voices of Black Mamas [Culture Shift].\n\nResults\n\nBMMA has made significant progress in advancing Black maternal health, rights, and justice in the United States. In 2018, BMMA founded the national Black Maternal Health Week, which led to the White House marking the first-ever federal Maternal Health Day of Action in 2021. BMMA also founded the Black Maternal Health Conference and Training Institute with more than 1,000 attendees in 2022. BMMA provides opportunities for professionals to gain continuing education credits and increase knowledge, skills, and competencies in Black maternal health through trainings and webinars. We convened our partners around strategic topic areas and created working groups, fellowships, and publications across our four focus areas.\n\nConclusions\n\nBy centering Black women’s leadership, BMMA’s work has the potential to change lives beyond maternal health and further support broader systems change by addressing racial and gender inequity and supporting holistic models of care.\n\nF3.1. My job, my voice: harnessing midwives’ demands at scale to strengthen the enabling environment for midwifery\n\nKimberly Whipkey, Angela Nguku, Elena Ateva\n\nWhite Ribbon Alliance\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F3.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC651\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDPCP78651\n\nPanel Description\n\nMidwives play a pivotal role in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality and stillbirths in low- and middle-income countries and providing women with sexual and reproductive health services. Yet, the midwifery workforce is in crisis. There is an estimated global shortage of 900,000 midwives due to fewer intakes into educational institutions; inadequate investment in recruitment, deployment, and remuneration; and a weak supportive environment.\n\nWhite Ribbon Alliance (WRA) pioneered an innovative programmatic approach that both increases political will to invest in midwives and accelerates national policy change, all in accordance with midwives’ priorities. Midwives’ Voices, Midwives’ Demands (MVMD) is a groundbreaking campaign launched in 2021 by WRA, the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), and partners. The campaign was based on an open-ended question: “What do you want most in your role as a midwife?” WRA and ICM selected nine focus countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe for intensive outreach. Trained mobilizers queried health care providers and recorded responses using the What Women Want Chatbot—a novel digital tool that uses WhatsApp and artificial intelligence to rapidly capture demands and analyze results. Responses from non-focus countries were collected via an e-survey.\n\nMVMD reached 56,000+ midwives in 100 countries. The two largest demands were for more and better-supported personnel, including increased salaries, and for supplies and functional facilities. This panel will explore how campaign partners have used the MVMD process and results to strengthen midwifery policy development and implementation in their countries, creating a more conducive environment based on what midwives say.\n\nF3.2. Amplifying midwives’ perspectives and priorities in the government of India’s rollout of midwifery-led care\n\nChaitanya Tupaki Sreepoorna1, Kimberly Whipkey2\n\n1Centre for Catalyzing Change; 2White Ribbon Alliance\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F3.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1419\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDPCP78651\n\nBackground\n\nThe Nurse Practitioner in Midwifery (NPM) is a new cadre launched by the Government of India (GoI) in 2018. Rollout of NPMs at the national and state levels was significantly stymied due to COVID-19. The Midwives’ Voices, Midwives’ Demands (MVMD) campaign refocused attention on midwives, mobilizing more than 10,000 responses nationwide from NPMs and other cadres providing maternal and newborn health services. Top asks included better facilities and adequate supplies, more staffing and better remuneration, better respect and recognition of the role, and improved autonomy and gender norms.\n\nMethods\n\nFollowing the mobilization effort, in 2022, the Centre for Catalyzing Change/White Ribbon Alliance India (WRAI) implemented strategic advocacy activities to disseminate MVMD findings and support midwifery research and action agendas. For example, WRA India developed a Charter of Demands with a Call to Action to maternal health experts at the national and state levels, and disseminated campaign findings with midwifery multi-stakeholders in consultations and convenings. WRA India also brought midwives’ demands to technical discussions on implementation research and practice and launched a communications campaign to mobilize policy and programmatic support for their demands.\n\nResults\n\nThe MVMD campaign helped fortify government efforts to integrate midwifery-led care in India’s public health system, with demands being particularly useful in supporting implementation of new policies. For example, in June 2021, the GoI launched a first-ever Scope of Practice for midwives. Although the scope of practice has been rolled out, awareness and understanding among practitioners have been uneven. WRA India used its MVMD Call to Action—which elevates midwives’ demands for better recognition of their role and increased autonomy—to socialize the scope of practice and call for empowering midwives to legally practice to their full scope. WRA India is now working with State Nursing Councils on additional licensure needed for midwifery practice that includes the full scope of practice.\n\nConclusions\n\nMVMD has contributed significantly to making midwives’ demands central to ensuring the success of the GoI’s national rollout of its midwifery program. An MVMD campaign effort can be especially valuable, formative, and catalytic in countries where midwifery cadres are being newly instituted.\n\nF3.3. Creating a national vision and strategic framework for the practice of midwifery in Pakistan reflective of midwives’ priorities\n\nRafia Rauf Shakeel, Kimberly Whipkey\n\nWhite Ribbon Alliance\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F3.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1415\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDPCP78651\n\nBackground\n\nMidwifery is at an inflection point in Pakistan. The country faces an eight-fold shortage of midwives, and the Community Midwives (CMWs) program has not been as successful as envisaged. The federal government, in response, has embarked on developing a new National Vision and Strategic Framework for Midwifery (Strategic Framework). At the same time, Forum for Safe Motherhood (FSM) launched its Midwives’ Voices, Midwives’ Demands campaign (MVMD). FSM heard from 6,145 midwives from across Pakistan including CMWs, Nurses, and Lady Health Visitors. More and better-supported personnel emerged as the top request.\n\nMethods\n\nTo shape and align the Strategic Framework with midwives’ priorities, FSM first performed a deeper analysis of campaign demands, examining the geography and cadre. FSM augmented this analysis with midwives’ personal testimonials, especially those of CMWs, to further characterize their challenges and solutions for change. Next, FSM shared MVMD findings and stories with all key stakeholders from the public and private sectors. To build additional buy-in, especially for policy implementation, FSM and partners organized provincial and regional consultative sessions across Pakistan with major academic institutions, provincial departments of health, and directorates of nursing.\n\nResults\n\nMVMD campaign demands not only influenced the architecture of the Strategic Framework, but also shaped the policy actions contained therein. The largest asks from midwives, especially from CMWs, were for government jobs, better support and pay, and a career pathway—all of which were incorporated. Specifically, the Strategic Framework calls for regularization and creation of vacancies for midwives in the government health system; proper policy implementation of the pay scale, with time-scale promotion, remuneration, and upgradation with additional qualification; and development of a proper career ladder, job description, and monitoring mechanisms for midwives.\n\nConclusions\n\nMVMD brought invaluable field evidence to policy discussions and compelled decision-makers to craft policy actions that responded directly to midwives’ concerns. It also enabled decision-makers to consider the perspectives of those rarely heard, such as CMWs working in rural and remote areas. In addition to guiding the national vision, the Strategic Framework will now serve as a roadmap for provincial midwifery strategies and midwives’ perspectives will once again serve as the evidence for action.\n\nF3.4. Midwives’ voices inform and catalyze a robust national midwifery agenda in Kenya\n\nSandra Mwarania, Kimberly Whipkey\n\nWhite Ribbon Alliance\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F3.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1406\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDPCP78651\n\nBackground\n\nAlthough midwives and nurses make up most of the health workforce in Kenya, government policies and investments have historically undervalued midwives. As part of the Midwives’ Voices, Midwives’ Demands (MVMD) campaign, White Ribbon Alliance (WRA) Kenya captured the perspectives of more than 3,500 midwives across the country, with top asks related to supplies, increased salaries, and more staff. The campaign coincided with the national government’s push to develop a new national policy on nursing and midwifery, presenting an opportunity to infuse midwives’ priorities.\n\nMethods\n\nIn 2021, prior to the launch of MVMD, WRA Kenya implemented a listening exercise with midwives in the Lake Region counties. The challenges they surfaced—shortage of midwives, lack of equipment and supplies, and absence of career pathways—were a harbinger of the MVMD findings to come. WRA Kenya shared these findings with decision-makers to inform early drafts of the national policy. WRA Kenya also organized workshops with MVMD participants to strategize and develop collective advocacy strategies. Several of these midwives were influential members of the taskforce that developed the national policy. Finally, as the national policy was being readied, WRA Kenya partnered with the Midwives Association of Kenya to host a national roundtable with 150 stakeholders and disseminate MVMD results.\n\nResults\n\nIn May 2022, the Kenyan Government launched its first-ever National Nursing and Midwifery Policy recognizing midwifery in Kenya as an independent profession. The policy responds directly to the needs of midwives, calling for strengthened education, better remuneration, increased supplies and facility-level investments to enable midwives to deliver quality care, and professional development pathways for the midwifery workforce. MVMD, moreover, helped accelerate other policy outcomes including an expanded scope of practice for midwives and positive governance changes in the professional midwives’ association.\n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough many actors contributed to midwifery policy action in Kenya, MVMD has proven to be both insightful and catalytic. The campaign also supported and emboldened midwives to self-advocate at decision-making tables and witness uptake of their voices in policy. The launch of this policy serves as an important first step to lay a foundation toward a sustainable future for the profession.\n\nF4.1. Innovations to support safe oxygen use with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) for the small or sick newborn care to achieve Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) target 4\n\nLeah Greenspan1, Tamah Kamlem2, Robert Neighbour3, Martha Franklin Mkony4, Harish Kumar5\n\n1United States Agency for International Development; 2Chemonics International; 3Diamedica (UK) Ltd; 4Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania; 5IPE Global Limited\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F4.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC676\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDYBT47676\n\nPanel Description\n\nEight years away from reaching the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) database suggests that 63 countries are not on track to meet these targets, noting that no country will reach the SDGs without providing quality small and sick newborn care (SSNC) at the facility level 2, which includes high-impact interventions for the management of respiratory distress. Providing safe oxygen and effective pressures to newborns with respiratory distress and pneumonia is critical to providing quality care to 30 million newborns requiring inpatient care each year. The World Health Organization’s Standards call for specific medical equipment appropriate for SSNC. In response, global innovators have designed equipment for respiratory support that provides effective pressure generation, blended oxygen, and oxygen saturation monitoring to prevent oxygen toxicity in premature newborns.\n\nENAP sets national targets for 2025; 80% of districts to have at least one functional level 2 inpatient unit for small and sick newborns, including CPAP. To guide countries’ efforts toward achieving global targets, the World Health Organization and UNICEF have developed standards for improving the quality of SSNC in health facilities and a model of level 2 care for small and sick newborns.\n\nThis session will feature global innovators presenting innovative CPAP decision-making tools, three different categories of CPAP devices, and in-country user experiences from the perspectives of the patient, parent, and health care provider.\n\nF4.2. Oxygen concentrator driven baby Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)\n\nRobert Neighbour1, Leah Greenspan2\n\n1Diamedica (UK) Ltd; 2United States Agency for International Development\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F4.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC830\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDYBT47676\n\nBackground\n\nThe benefits of properly controlled CPAP for a range of clinical conditions in neonates is well established. In low-resource settings the cost and logistics of providing the required levels of oxygen and air must be factored into equipment provision. A 6,000 litre oxygen cylinder may need to be replaced more than once a day, resulting in prohibitively high lifetime costs.\n\nThe requirements for appropriate CPAP are: adequate flowrates of both oxygen and air; stable controlled pressure reflected at the patient interface; independence between flowrate and pressure; and minimal imposed work of breathing (iWOB). Warming and humidification of the gases is also an established benefit to help avoid septum necrosis, nasal obstruction, and hypothermia.\n\nMethods\n\nOxygen concentrator technology is well established and accepted in most low-income settings. Diamedica (UK) Ltd utilized this base technology to develop a CPAP device that would deliver all the required elements of effective neonatal CPAP at lower running costs, namely the cost of electricity to run the concentrator. A novel design approach utilized the concentrator compressor to provide controlled flows of oxygen and air, warmed and humidified using waste heat from the concentrator. Two models were developed, providing either 5 or 10 L/min each of both oxygen and air, the full range of FiO2 is controllable. Everything required to deliver CPAP is provided in a single mobile unit, facilitating ease of setup and use. Voltage stabilization is supplied as standard, with optional battery backup.\n\nResults\n\nThe device met all the requirements for appropriate CPAP listed above, and achieved regulatory approvals. Diamedica’s CPAP device is currently used in 30 countries with more than 2,700 units supplied. Extensively tested and validated, independently published research from Uganda established that the introduction of this equipment resulted in a substantial reduction in neonatal mortality\n\nConclusions\n\nDiamedica’s CPAP device has fulfilled both technical and affordability requirements of the original design objective. The initial cost of the units was offset by their minimal running costs, providing a highly cost-effective device. An independent paper from Nigeria concluded that in circumstances of limited, or expensive oxygen provision, it was the only viable option for affordable neonatal CPAP.\n\nF4.3. Implementation of low-cost Effective Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bubble CPAP (bCPAP) in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to Address Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) for small and sick newborns\n\nKondwani Kawaza1, Leah Greenspan2, Harish Kumar3\n\n1Kamuzu University of Health Sciences (KUHES); 2United States Agency for International Development; 3IPE Global Limited\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F4.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC829\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDYBT47676\n\nBackground\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Dvelopment is currently demonstrating models for improving the quality of facility-based care for small and sick newborns (SSNB) being implemented in India and Malawi, with the use of innovative CPAP devices to improve newborn outcomes and to help the countries achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Studies have revealed challenges in health systems in the provision of safe oxygen use in LMICs. bCPAP is an evidence-based intervention for newborns with respiratory distress and if implemented safely can be an effective mode of therapy. Assessments have shown that there is a weak capacity among health care providers for the management of RDS, and limited availability of blenders and regulated devices.\n\nMethods\n\nTwo bCPAP models, both designed with input from in-country expertise, were implemented in secondary-level hospitals in Malawi and India. In Malawi, the Pumani bCPAP device was rolled out in 24 district hospitals. This device includes a driver unit with a bubble bottle for pressure control, an inspiratory tube connected to Hudson prongs, and a port for an external oxygen source. In India, the Sanns was implemented in seven facilities across two states. With a design similar to Pumani’s, it is a locally manufactured and approved low-cost bCPAP device. Its unique features include external display unit and backup battery. Prior to implementation, facility assessments and staffing practices and gaps for standards were evaluated.\n\nResults\n\nThe Sanns model was used for the care of 220 newborns with respiratory distress with no complications. Implementation of the Pumani model resulted in improvement of survival to discharge for neonates with respiratory distress (48.6% vs. 54.5%; P = .012). Providers are comfortable using the devices.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe implementation of CPAP devices in Malawi and India provide insightful learnings on ways to institutionalize a critical quality standard for newborn care.\n\nF4.4. Situational analysis of prevalence of improvised Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (bCPAP), 100% oxygen use, and pulse oximetry monitoring use in level 2 facilities in Ghana\n\nTamah Kamlem1, Leah Greenspan2\n\n1Chemonics International; 2United States Agency for International Development\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F4.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC693\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDYBT47676\n\nBackground\n\nCPAP devices have been widely supported for introduction at scale to reduce neonatal mortality from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a common cause of neonatal deaths. Every Newborn Action Plan set a target of 80% for level 2 facilities to provide CPAP by 2025.\n\nAlthough these efforts have increased the availability of CPAP devices, the global newborn community is concerned with the following: 1. A large number of bCPAPs in low- and middle-income countries do not have blenders or routine access to electricity and are relying exclusively on 100% O2; 2. Use of 100% oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity, which can result in retinopathy of prematurity or chronic lung disease; and 3. Without gradual data to drive prioritization of updating respiratory guidelines, demand for investments in innovative safe delivery of oxygen, and continued creative solutions, neonates may continue to receive unsafe oxygen delivery.\n\nMethods\n\nA mixed method approach will be used for the assessment with random sampling of level 2 health facilities in Ghana. This quantitative approach will seek to provide data on prevalence of improvised bCPAP, 100% oxygen use and pulse oximetry monitoring use in level 2 facilities in Ghana through the collection and analysis of numerical data. The qualitative approach will include a semi-structured interview guide to obtain feedback from providers, experts, and key informants on the use of CPAP.\n\nResults\n\nThe study will provide data on the prevalence of improvised bCPAP, 100% oxygen use, and pulse oximetry monitoring use in level 2 facilities in Ghana. Additionally, providers’ capacity, behavior, and availability and maintenance of devices will be investigated to determine potential gaps and areas of improvement.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe study will provide insight into the current state of respiratory mechanisms at level 2 facilities in Ghana for small and sick newborns and determine existing challenges regarding the supply chain of medical devices for newborn health. Results will inform the policy landscape of newborn health to stakeholders at the national level and beyond.\n\nF4.5. Novel high-quality Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (bCPAP) and oxygen blender systems for global access\n\nMartha Franklin Mkony1, Thomas Burke2, Leah Greenspan3\n\n1Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania; 2Vayu Global Health Foundation; 3United States Agency for International Development\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F4.5\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC685\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DDYBT47676\n\nNote the full manuscript published in December 2022 in PLOS ONE:\n\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9803298/)\n\nF5.1. Maternal mortality: levels, trends, and strengthening reporting\n\nJenny Cresswell1, Lale Say1, Imbulana Jayaratne2, Affette McCaw-Binns3\n\n1World Health Organization; 2Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka; 3University of the West Indies, Mona\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F5.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1353\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DFHYE111353\n\nPanel Description\n\nThe reduction of maternal mortality has long been a global health priority and remains a prominent part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda. The SDGs include a direct emphasis on reducing maternal mortality, while also highlighting the importance of moving beyond survival. SDG target 3.1—to reduce global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030—is an ambitious target and will require sustained commitments to ensure that women and adolescent girls get quality care and support when and where needed.\n\nThe United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Interagency Group, comprising the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division, has collaborated with external academic teams and technical experts on a new round of maternal mortality estimates covering the period 2000–2020. These new MMR estimates supersede all previous estimates and are based on the most up-to-date data and methods, assessing national, regional, and global trends monitoring progress toward 2030. The panel will also report updated causes of maternal death estimates from WHO.\n\nHaving targets for maternal mortality reduction is important; however, accurate data remain the key to robust policy and programming. Authors from Sri Lanka and Jamaica will share data and processes to quantify and reduce missed and misclassified maternal deaths. Enhanced reporting will allow better data use, informing maternal cause of death attribution, relevant interventions, and tracking including interpretation of the gaps in coverage.\n\nF5.2. Structured processes built upon the original Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) system: Sri Lanka\n\nImbulana Jayaratne1, Jenny Cresswell2\n\n1Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka; 2World Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F5.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1399\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DFHYE111353\n\nBackground\n\nSri Lanka is a lower middle-income country with low maternal mortality, and is considered a success story in terms of both reducing maternal mortality and improving its measurement. Sri Lanka has an established history of maternal death monitoring. The MDSR system was started in 1959, with the notification of probable maternal deaths being made mandatory in 1985. A decade later, a structured review of probable maternal deaths was initiated, and a national database has been in place since 2000.\n\nMethods\n\nMandatory death notification in Sri Lanka is a key strength of the MDSR system in ensuring high levels of completeness. This presentation will describe the steps and characteristics of the system, and how these features strengthen reporting and improve outcomes. For example, postmortems must be sought for all probable maternal deaths to confirm pregnancy or recent delivery or pregnancy loss/termination among women of reproductive age, contributing to delineating pathology and more accurately determining the cause of death. In addition, Sri Lanka also uses community health workers (field public health midwives) to notify of any potential maternal deaths that took place both inside and outside of health care facilities, minimizing the potential for underreporting.\n\nResults\n\nThe surveillance process in Sri Lanka has a clear and established “no name, no blame” policy at all stages. This assurance of confidentiality helps to give confidence in accurate reporting without the fear of repercussions or reprisals, ensuring that appropriate, evidence based actions can then be taken to make improvements. One challenge for the system has been a time lag between the notification of the death and the availability of review outcomes, which are needed for decision-making. To help to address this issue, the Ministry of Health has introduced an immediate response system, whereby the Director General of Health Services (the highest level administrator) convenes a fact-finding discussion with all caregivers in cases where service gaps have been identified.\n\nConclusions\n\nRobust systems with multiple checks and feedback loops strengthen maternal mortality reporting and help data improve outcomes to reduce preventable maternal mortality. These practices are demonstrated in the Sri Lanka model.\n\nF5.3. Vital registration as a reliable source of maternal mortality information: Jamaica’s experience with efforts to improve data quality and completeness, 2018–2021\n\nAffette McCaw-Binns1, Jenny Cresswell2\n\n1University of the West Indies, Mona; 2World Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F5.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1390\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DFHYE111353\n\nBackground\n\nReliable data systems are critical to monitoring survival for rare conditions like maternal deaths, given that small variations impact measurement accuracy. In 1998, Jamaica established an active maternal mortality surveillance system (MMS) and added death certification to the medical curriculum; however, between 1998–2007, just 126/428 (29%) of maternal deaths appeared in vital registration statistics. A pregnancy checkbox was added to the medical certificate of cause of death in 2014. We aim to determine if these interventions have improved retrieval of maternal deaths from vital registration.\n\nMethods\n\nVital registration data for 2018–2021 were triangulated with MMS information to determine completeness.\n\nResults\n\nOf 227 maternal deaths identified for 2018–2021, 62% (n=140) were registered as maternal deaths, including 24 (11%) missed by MMS. The MMS accounted for 80% (n=183) of cases, with 51% (n=126) common to both sources. Another 16% (n=37) were registered, but misclassified as non-maternal deaths, and 13% (n=30) were not registered. Misclassification included both inflation due to certification of late maternal deaths as maternal deaths, and under-reporting, with true maternal deaths missed because of certification/coding errors, and non-registration. In 2021, 43% of maternal deaths were due to COVID-19 (cause-specific MR=115; total maternal mortality ratio=258/100,000); and two-thirds of COVID-19 cases were misclassified.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe pregnancy checkbox has improved maternal mortality case identification through vital registration from 29% to 70% in 15 years; however, gaps remain related to non-registration of community maternal deaths/coroner’s cases. Certification/coding of indirect maternal deaths should reflect the changing disease profile of antenatal women, including their susceptibility to infections such as COVID-19. Global reporting should reflect these risks alongside the traditional direct complications of pregnancy.\n\nF5.4. Global and regional causes of maternal deaths 2009–2017: a World Health Organization (WHO) systematic analysis\n\nJenny Cresswell\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F5.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1385\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DFHYE111353\n\nBackground\n\nThe current level of maternal mortality remains unacceptably high and is not on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal targets. To successfully reach targets, information about cause of death is needed to inform interventions and programs. The aim of this study was to develop estimates of the causes of maternal deaths at global and regional levels for the period from 2009 to 2017.\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a systematic review of bibliographic databases, theWHO’s Member State websites, and WHO’s records for reports of maternal deaths, with no language restrictions. Civil registration and vital statistics data were extracted from the WHO Mortality Database. We assessed the reports according to pre-specified criteria. Regional and global estimates of the maternal cause of death distribution were estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical model.\n\nResults\n\nWe included data from 142 countries and 950 country years. Globally, the most common cause of maternal death was hemorrhage (26%; 80% uncertainty interval [UI]: 22%–30%), followed by indirect obstetric deaths (23%, 80% UI: 19%–29%), and hypertension (16%; 80% UI: 14%–19%). There was substantial regional variation in the proportion of deaths due to hemorrhage. Data on maternal suicide and late maternal deaths were very inconsistently reported. Few countries reported deaths due to maternal suicide in developed regions, with only five countries had data recording one or more maternal suicide deaths. In low- and middle-income regions, we estimated between 3%–8% of maternal deaths were due to suicide The ratio of late maternal deaths to maternal deaths up to 42 days was 0 to 0.1 among those countries that reported at least one such death.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe global distribution of the causes of maternal deaths remained similar in broad terms between 2003 to 2009 and 2009 to 2017. This update includes for the first time an analysis attempting to report on maternal suicide as a cause of death. Hemorrhage remains the leading individual cause of death, despite the existence of effective clinical interventions. Improving access to emergency obstetric care provided by competent health care providers and good quality referral networks therefore remain vital.\n\nF5.5. Trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2020: estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank Group, and United Nations Population Division\n\nLale Say, Jenny Cresswell\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F5.5\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1364\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DFHYE111353\n\nBackground\n\nTo monitor progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 3.1 of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70 by 2030, the UN’s Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (consisting of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and UN Population Division) (UN-MMEIG) develop and disseminate internationally comparable estimates of maternal mortality. The aim of this research was to estimate comparable global, regional, and country estimates of maternal mortality levels and trends covering the period 2000–2020.\n\nMethods\n\nWe updated the UN-MMEIG’s input databases using systematic searches. Data sources included were civil registration and vital statistics, censuses, special maternal mortality surveillance systems and studies, and national population-based surveys. We estimated maternal mortality levels and 80% uncertainty intervals using two statistical models: a Bayesian misclassification model to account for errors in reporting of maternal deaths and a Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model to estimate the MMR for each country year.\n\nResults\n\nNearly all maternal deaths were found to be due to preventable causes. The lifetime risk of dying from a maternal cause varies substantially globally: a 15-year-old in Africa has around a 1 in 37 chance of eventually dying due to a maternal cause compared to around 1 in ~3,750 in Europe. Countries that are humanitarian or fragile settings have a particularly high burden of maternal mortality.The average rate of reduction of maternal mortality has slowed in recent years. This is a concerning trend: progress is not currently on track to meet the SDG targets.\n\nConclusions\n\nDespite global progress in reducing maternal mortality, further action is needed to meet the ambitious SDG 3.1 2030 target, and ultimately eliminate preventable maternal mortality . There is a continued urgent need for maternal health and survival to remain high on the global health agenda—ensuring that women and adolescent girls have access to quality care when needed.\n\nF6.1. Enhancing maternal and newborn health in humanitarian and fragile settings with integrated service delivery\n\nChristopher Lindahl1, Renee Fiorentino1, Nancy Ibrahim2, Dan Wendo1, Samia Mohammed3, Grace Carina Viola4\n\n1MOMENTUM Integrated Health Resilience; 2Save the Children US; 3Building Foundation for Development; 4United Nations Population Fund\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F6.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1081\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DHMBK931081\n\nPanel Description\n\nIntegration of service delivery components is a challenge in the best of circumstances, not least because vertical funding streams often work against it. Yet, in all settings, truly patient-centered care is integrated, maximizing efficiency of contact between care-seeking families and their care teams. In settings characterized by conflict, post-conflict, the effects of climate change, frequent government turnover, and other shocks and stresses, quality integrated care becomes that much more of an imperative.\n\nThis panel will feature Save the Children speaking about the importance of supporting integrated primary health care in Somaliland; MOMENTUM Integrated Health Resilience will share immediate postpartum and post-abortion family planning trends in supported counties in South Sudan; Building Foundation for Development will present its lessons learned implementing mobile medical teams providing an integrated package of services in Yemen; and the United Nations Population Fund will speak about its success improving outcomes through the offer of cash assistance for healthy pregnancies and safe births in the Philippines.\n\nEach panelist will highlight the ways in which integration helped overcome difficulties particular to the setting in which they work and improved holistic care for mothers and their newborns.\n\nF6.2. Cash assistance for healthy pregnancies and safe births in the Philippines\n\nGrace Carina Viola1, Christopher Lindahl2, Renee Fiorentino2, Alice Golay1\n\n1United Nations Population Fund; 2MOMENTUM Integrated Health Resilience\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F6.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1094\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DHMBK931081\n\nBackground\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Philippines provided cash assistance to pregnant women in conflict-and typhoon-affected areas to address the increased economic barriers women and girls faced, resulting in delays in accessing quality and timely maternal care. Thanks to the cash assistance program, facility-based deliveries and attendance at checkup visits increased. The Philippines program is part of UNFPA’s global commitment to use cash as a tool to enhance access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for women and girls.\n\nCash assistance was provided in complement to interventions such as SRH medical missions and SRH, gender-based violence, and psychosocial support, and COVID-19 messaging, multiplying its impact. UNFPA is planning to implement similar approaches in Indonesia, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nMethods\n\nIn addition to regular program monitoring and evidence building, eligible pregnant women and adolescents registered into the cash assistance program and a comparison group are surveyed after receiving the cash support on its impact on key outcomes: 1) attendance at antenatal care visits; 2) facility-based delivery; 3) attendance at postpartum care visits; 4) perception of the service in terms of quality; and 5) safety. Evaluation findings will be available by the end of 2022, in time for the conference. Evaluation findings are available here.\n\nResults\n\nResults of the internal program monitoring are as follows: out of 1,000 pregnant women registered in the program, pregnant women attending a first antenatal visit increased from 31% to 96%, women delivering in a facility increased from 28% to 68%, and women attending at least one postnatal consultation increased from 38% to 87%.\n\nConclusions\n\nIntegrating cash assistance into SHR programming appears to be highly successful. The evaluation with Johns Hopkins University complements ongoing monitoring of maternal, infant, and child programming, and expands program learnings beyond current indicators to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of cash for SRH in the Philippines context and understand how efficiently and effectively financial incentives can help change attitudes and behaviors.\n\nF6.3. Mobile medical teams responding to health emergencies in humanitarian settings via the provision of integrated health services\n\nSamia Mohammed1, Christopher Lindahl2, Renee Fiorentino2\n\n1Building Foundation for Development; 2MOMENTUM Integrated Health Resilience\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F6.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1087\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DHMBK931081\n\nBackground\n\nFor women in Yemen, access to adequate and affordable health care has been significantly hampered by ongoing crisis and conflict. Most women from remote areas who suffer problems and complications during pregnancy or delivery are due to the poor health infrastructure capacity, lack of available facilities, and limited essential supplies and staff. To fill gaps in services, Building Foundation for Development, with funding from the United Nations Population Fund, is running emergency response mobile medical teams (MMTs) in Ma`rib, Yemen.\n\nMethods\n\nThe MMTs aim to bring lifesaving services closer to those in need by using mobile clinics to service remote areas. Each MMT includes qualified health workers who have community knowledge: one general practitioner, two midwives, two nurses, one pharmacist, and one psychologist. The composition of the MMTs allows for provision of an integrated package of services at the point of care, including: primary health care, antenatal care, and reproductive health services, nutrition, immunization, MHPSS, and referral services. Additionally, the teams can support survivors of gender-based violence and provide psychological care to internally displaced persons and host communities with both first aid treatment and referral to specialists if required.\n\nResults\n\nIn the first half of 2022, 55,391 people received services from the MMTs. This new program has allowed Building Foundation for Development to quickly adapt to population movements and conduct visits to multiple sites, ensuring that health services are equitably distributed across affected communities. The success of the MMTs has resulted in expanded access to high-quality services (including medicines and supplies). Moreover, the MMTs are appreciated by users as an effective strategy, particularly in the context of displacement and continuous conflict.\n\nConclusions: Thousands of people have been displaced following the conflict in and around Ma`rib. The majority of the displaced are women and children, many of whom have both physical and mental health care needs. MMTs have been an effective strategy for reaching populations in need in Ma`rib.\n\nF6.4. Immediate postpartum and postabortion family planning trends in counties supported by MOMENTUM integrated health resilience in South Sudan\n\nLou Eluzai, Renee Fiorentino, Christopher Lindahl, Dan Wendo, Mary Jackson, Zechariah James\n\nMOMENTUM Integrated Health Resilience\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F6.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1085\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DHMBK931081\n\nBackground\n\nSouth Sudan continues to experience decades-long humanitarian crises impeding access to quality maternal and neonatal services. Early marriages and childbirth, together with repeated closely spaced pregnancies, contribute to high maternal and infant deaths. Contraceptive use is low (4.3 %) and unmet need is high (29.7%); annually, 26% of pregnancies are unintended and 46% end in abortion. MOMENTUM Integrated Health Services (MIHR) is improving healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies by strengthening access to, and quality of, voluntary postpartum family planning (PPFP) services among women at facilities and in their communities.\n\nMethods\n\nMIHR supports demand creation at facility and community levels to improve care-seeking behaviors, and strengthens facility readiness to provide education, counseling, and PPFP services. MIHR implements a whole-site facility integration approach in which pregnant or postpartum women/men are reached at various clinics with information (including antenatal, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, antenatal, maternity, postnatal, nutrition, immunization, and outpatient). All but those in the maternity clinic, where FP services are provided immediately postpartum, are referred to the FP clinic for provision. Community-level Boma Health Workers conduct several integrated visits, before and after delivery, and provide/refer for FP.\n\nResults\n\nRoutine data from 24 facilities in eight counties from October 2021 to June 2022 show contraceptive uptake remained relatively the same—on average 2.3% of postpartum women/couples counseled per month voluntarily accepted an FP method. Roughly three-quarters of these acceptors came from a facility and one-quarter from the community. Half were adolescents and/or youth. These routine data echo population-level survey data findings, indicating only 3% of postpartum women use contraceptives.\n\nConclusions\n\nCausal factors behind high unmet need and low uptake of FP in South Sudan are particular. Social norms regarding abstinence after childbirth, large families, and home deliveries may be contributing. MIHR is using the demographics above and assessing factors contributing to low uptake (through an experience of care study and an assessment of facilitators and barriers among postpartum women), and testing innovations such as community-based immediate PPFP for women delivering at home.\n\nF6.5. Improving quality and availability of maternal newborn services in Somalia Puntland through delivery of adapted capacity-building packages to health care workers: Maternal and Newborn Health (MNH) program, save the children\n\nNancy Ibrahim1, Christopher Lindahl2, Renee Fiorentino2, Sarah Ashraf1\n\n1Save the Children US; 2MOMENTUM Integrated Health Resilience\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F6.5\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1083\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DHMBK931081\n\nBackground\n\nIn Somalia, more than 80% of newborn deaths are due to prematurity and asphyxia complications. Deaths can be prevented by well-trained midwives and nurses during antenatal and postnatal visits and delivering at a health facility.\n\nThe MNH program in Somalia focuses on improving the quality and availability of maternal and newborn care through contextualization and integration of the Helping Babies Survive (HBS) and Helping Mothers Survive (HMS) training programs.\n\nMethods\n\nSave the Children supported the translation into the Somali language of the adapted HMS curriculum obtained from Jhpiego and the HBS curriculum from the American Academy of Pediatrics. These translated training modules were endorsed by the Ministry of Health.\n\nTwenty-eight master trainers were trained. The master trainers conducted cascade trainings for 154 health care providers. The trainees subsequently passed on knowledge gained to 300 colleagues through coaching and supportive supervision at their respective workplaces and provided needed care to 6,000 women and their newborn babies.\n\nSave the Children then advocated for the scale-up of integrated newborn and maternal care training across the country to improve relevant practices and outcomes.\n\nResults\n\nThe proportion of newborns who received two or more essential newborn care practices (including skin-to-skin contact, cord care, and early breastfeeding) improved from 19.9% to 94.7% post-intervention. The study also showed significant skills retention, and improvement in knowledge and confidence among providers.\n\nOverall, the average change in knowledge was 22.54%, and 41.5% in skills. This indicates a huge baseline need among providers, crucial to fill in order to keep increasing the number of maternal and newborn lives saved. The skills retention score mean difference at 18 months after the trainings was 11.9 %.\n\nConclusions\n\nAdequate training, supportive supervision, and on-the-job coaching of providers can prevent deaths by proper management of the critical events newborns face such as hemorrhage, obstructed labor, eclampsia, sepsis, pre-term birth, and respiratory distress. Scaling up trainings is recommended.\n\nF7.1. A 13-year initiative to expand access to high-quality Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) and family planning services in Tanzania\n\nSunday Dominico1, Neena Prasad2, Florina Serbanescu3, Samantha Lobis4\n\n1Thamini Uhai; 2Bloomberg Philanthropies; 3Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 4Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F7.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC409\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DIPOP39409\n\nPanel Description\n\nThe Program to Reduce Maternal Deaths in Tanzania was a 13-year initiative that worked to expand mostly rural communities’ access to high-quality EmONC and family planning services. The Tanzanian Ministry of Health and its partners worked together to enhance the quality of maternal and perinatal care and improve health outcomes in Kigoma region.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa accounts for only 15% of the world’s population but bears nearly 70% of the global burden of maternal deaths and about 40% of global newborn deaths. More than half of maternal and newborn deaths result from complications during childbirth and are largely preventable. However, poor quality of care in low-resource settings is often a greater contributor to poor health outcomes than health coverage. The Tanzanian Program model of decentralized obstetric, reproductive, and newborn care from distant hospitals to more accessible, lower-level health facilities through infrastructure upgrades and training the non-physician health care providers staffing these facilities demonstrated substantial reduction in maternal and perinatal deaths. The panel will present the history of the Program, key Program interventions, a population-based multilevel decomposition analysis that shows how a rapid increase in facility deliveries is mostly attributable to the increase in quality of health facilities, and an innovative birth companionship model that was scaled up and led to a policy change in Tanzania.\n\nLessons learned from the Program can inform policymakers and program managers in settings where similar approaches could be used to improve and sustain the utilization of quality facility care at birth.\n\nF7.2. Introducing, sustaining, and scaling up birth companionship in Tanzania\n\nAlex Mputa1, Sunday Dominico1, Agness Mbanza1, Nguke Mwakatundu1, Dunstan Bishanga2, Shanon McNab3, Irene Mashasi3, Selemani Mbuyita3, Samantha Lobis3\n\n1Thamini Uhai; 2Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences; 3Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F7.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC413\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DIPOP39409\n\nBackground\n\nHaving a companion of choice who provides continuous emotional, practical, and informational support throughout childbirth is an essential component of good quality, respectful care. From 2016–2019, Thamini Uhai systematically introduced birth companionship as a pilot in nine government health facilities in Kigoma as part of a program to reduce maternal deaths in Tanzania. Building on the pilot’s positive results, birth companionship was integrated into national policy and scaled up in the Kigoma and Katavi regions. Implementation and sustainability lessons learned during the pilot were built into the scaled-up efforts.\n\nMethods\n\nModifications included developing accountability mechanisms to ensure good-quality implementation, training health care providers to promote birth companionship to women during antenatal care, and putting more emphasis on supporting companions to provide comfort measures (e.g., use of different birthing positions, relaxation techniques, and non-medical pain relief strategies). Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with women, health care providers, and government officials in both regions in 2021.\n\nResults\n\nBirth companionship is now being implemented in 23 government health facilities in two regions. By April 2021, more than three-quarters of women giving birth at facilities in Kigoma and 96% in Katavi had birth companions. Women who had recently delivered spoke of the benefits of having a companion: receiving a massage to relieve backaches, having their hands held as a way of extending psychological support, and escorting them to the washroom and bringing them back to bed to rest.\n\nThamini Uhai was able to take these results, leverage their strong relationships with the local-level government, and meet with national-level policymakers to advocate for the institutionalization of birth companionship in Tanzania. As a result of the program, birth companionship features in the national guidelines and training framework for respectful maternity care. Moreover, scale-up of birth companionship has received strong backing from the President of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Ministry of Health.\n\nConclusions\n\nBirth companionship is feasible, scalable, and highly acceptable among communities and health care providers in Tanzania, and now there is a policy framework and political will for scale-up countrywide.\n\nF7.3. Changes in individual, community, and health facility factors associated with using facility delivery services in rural Tanzania: a repeat multilevel and decomposition analysis\n\nFlorina Serbanescu1, Paul Stupp1, Alicia Ruiz1, Michelle Schmitz1, Sunday Dominico2, Samantha Lobis3, Jason Hsia1\n\n1Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2Thamini Uhai; 3Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F7.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC412\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DIPOP39409\n\nBackground\n\nDelivering in a health facility with skilled health care providers is a key component in improving maternal and newborn health and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals for health by 2030. It was also the goal of the Program to Reduce Maternal Deaths in Tanzania. Our study examined changes in individual, community, and health facility factors related to the use of facility delivery services between 2014 and 2018 in a predominantly rural region of Tanzania, with the goal of prioritizing interventions to increase use of such services.\n\nMethods\n\nWe analyzed data from women with recent births who participated in 2014 (n=1,628) and 2018 (n=4,165) population-based surveys in Kigoma Region, Tanzania. We combined data from surveys with data from health facility assessments (2013 and 2018) to determine what remains to be done to ensure adequate delivery services at facilitiies. We used a mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression analysis to assess the influence of individual-, community-, and facility-level factors on delivering in a health facility. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis quantified the extent to which the difference in facility delivery rates between 2014 and 2018 can be explained by changes in these factors.\n\nResults\n\nFacility delivery rate increased by 68% (from 44.7% to 75.4%). In both 2014 and 2018, women had significantly greater odds of facility delivery if they were literate adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.52 and 1.51; had high socioeconomic status (aOR: 2.3 and 1.4); had no previous births (aOR: 4.3 and 3.3); planned for transport (aOR: 4.8 and 2.4); resided in Kigoma town (aOR: 3.8 and 2.4) or Kibondo district (aOR: 4.1 and 2.5); and resided within 0–10 km of an adequate health facility (aOR: 5.8 and 6.7). Changes in the individual, community, and health facility factors evaluated explained 49% of the increase in facility delivery rate between 2014 and 2018. Most of the explained increase was accounted for by changes in two factors: proximity of an adequate health facility (55%) and transport planning (32%).\n\nConclusions\n\nEfforts to maximize increased use of facility delivery in rural Tanzania may benefit from focusing on transport planning for birth and provision of adequate delivery services close to women’s place of residence.\n\nF7.4. Improving access to quality emergency obstetric and newborn care in Kigoma, Tanzania\n\nSunday Dominico1, Nguke Mwakatundu1, Mkambu Kassanga1, Samantha Lobis2\n\n1Thamini Uhai; 2Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F7.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC411\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DIPOP39409\n\nBackground\n\nA 13-year program in Tanzania worked to expand underserved communities’ access to high-quality emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) in three regions, with a primary focus on Kigoma. To achieve this goal, the program decentralized and sustained high-quality EmONC to non-hospitals by training and mentoring doctor and non-doctor cadres and upgrading and equipping facilities. The program’s focus on interventions to ensure skills maintenance of providers contributed to its successes.\n\nMethods\n\nThe program provided extensive clinical support, which included: frequent on-site supervision and mentorship visits; in-person continuing medical education workshops; weekly teleconferences led by Tanzanian obstetricians to discuss cases and challenges; emergency call system for providers to access expert obstetricians 24/7 and receive clinical advice; and creation of an E-Learning Platform for continuous education of health care providers. A low-dose high-frequency training with simulation and a robust system of clinical audits were introduced and sustained. Action-oriented feedback was provided to health care providers,along with facility, and council and regional health management teams, to ensure improved quality of care. The program was externally monitored for target-tracking and real-time feedback.\n\nResults\n\nBetween 2013 and 2018, 14 of the 15 program-supported health centers started to provide obstetric surgery, a key goal of the program; supported dispensaries provided an average of five out of seven basic EmONC signal functions. The facility delivery rate increased by 73% (from 49% to 85%). Met need for EmONC increased to 61%, while the direct obstetric case fatality rate declined (from 1.8% to 1.4%). The institutional maternal mortality ratio across all health facilities declined from 303 to 174 deaths per 100,000 live births, and the intrapartum stillbirth rate declined from 14.4 to 6.0 per 1,000 births. Most institutional maternal deaths in Kigoma were averted through care provided by program-supported facilities. The program provided a major contribution to meeting the obstetric needs of the region.\n\nConclusions\n\nDecentralizing high-quality EmONC delivered mostly by associate clinicians and nurses improved the availability and utilization of lifesaving high-quality EmONC in Kigoma. The program’s approach is being replicated in other regions in Tanzania and should be considered by governments working to decrease maternal and newborn mortality in similar settings.\n\nF7.5. What does it take to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths in under-resourced, rural settings? Lessons from a 13-year initiative in Kigoma, Tanzania\n\nNeena Prasad1, Sunday Dominico2, Samantha Lobis3, Florina Serbanescu4\n\n1Bloomberg Philanthropies; 2Thamini Uhai; 3Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program; 4Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F7.5\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC410\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DIPOP39409\n\nBackground\n\nThe Program to Reduce Maternal Deaths in Kigoma (“Program”) was a 13-year collaboration (2006–2019) between the Government of Tanzania (GoT), nongovernmental organizations, and donors that sought to make high-quality care more available, accessible, and utilized.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Program decentralized obstetric, reproductive, and newborn care from distant hospitals to more accessible, lower-level health facilities through infrastructure upgrades and training the non-physician health care providers staffing these facilities. Regular evaluations allowed the Program to identify and respond to gaps, which meant the Program’s strategy evolved over time. Such evolutions included incorporating demand-generation activities; strengthening basic emergency obstetric care within dispensaries, where most deliveries occurred; targeting interventions to improve neonatal outcomes; and introducing birth companionship. Advocacy to ensure sustainability beyond Program tenure was incorporated in later years.\n\nResults\n\nThe Program achieved significant improvements in maternal and perinatal health indicators, meeting or exceeding targets established by the GoT. By mid-2019, the Program had fully transitioned to GoT oversight.\n\nConclusions\n\nDecentralizing high-quality obstetric, reproductive, and newborn health care is feasible and effective in under-resourced rural settings. Key lessons include:\n\nThe necessity of multistakeholder partnerships. A host of demand- and supply-side interventions are required to meaningfully address maternal and neonatal mortality—leveraging the comparative strengths of a diverse set of stakeholders working in close collaboration will make success more likely.\n\nProgram evaluation should be viewed not only as a tool to assess impact of interventions, but to inform program design. This approach requires flexibility on the part of donors to adapt the program’s design and a willingness to stay the course and invest longer-term.\n\nThe presence of health services does not automatically translate to high-quality and accessible services. Quality of care can be furthered by a supportive work environment, including ongoing mentorship of health care providers. Access can be strengthened by addressing the barriers women face in reaching a health facility and ensuring they are treated respectfully.\n\nSustainability cannot be an afterthought. Long-term sustainability requires centering government plans and priorities; strengthening the existing public health care system; and advocacy to ensures prioritization and funding.\n\nF8.1. Implementing Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR): new solutions and opportunities\n\nNatasha Sobers1, Francesca Palestra2, Sylvia Deganus2, Mary Kinney3, Gloria Mutimbwa Siseho3\n\n1Pan American Health Organization; 2World Health Organization; 3University of the Western Cape, South Africa\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F8.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC431\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DITJK34431\n\nPanel Description\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and partners in the MPDSR technical working group are working together to strengthen implementation of MPDSR to enhance the quality of maternal and perinatal care and to improve health outcomes.\n\nOur panel showcases practical solutions and innovative approaches to tackle specific challenges in documenting contributory factors leading to the deaths of women and their babies at facility, national, and regional levels in MPDSR implementation. Experiences will draw from the African and Latin American Caribbean region on health system’s quality improvements.\n\nOur session includes contributions from the audience on what more the WHO, partners, and policymakers can do to ensure further improvement and implementation of the MPDSR cycle at country and global levels.\n\nF8.2. Monitoring timing and drivers of newborn deaths: the role of maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response intervention in reducing perinatal deaths, Northeast Namibia\n\nGloria Mutimbwa Siseho1, Thubelihle Mathole1, Debra Jackson1,2\n\n1University of the Western Cape, South Africa; 2London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F8.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC436\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DITJK34431\n\nBackground\n\nEarly newborn deaths (0–7 days) are driving a large proportion of perinatal deaths within the newborn period (0–28days) in Namibia. This study assessed the timing (when?) and drivers (what?) of newborn deaths and describes the maternal perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) intervention system aimed to reduce maternal and newborn deaths.\n\nMethods\n\nA quantitative descriptive study design was applied. The intermediate hospital in northeast Namibia was purposively sampled as the only regional hospital in the area. An MPDSR review Excel performance monitoring tool with automated formulas was used to capture and analyze data from the hospital health information system. Analyzed data included deliveries, live births, maternal, perinatal, and newborn deaths from January 2019 to June 2020.\n\nResults\n\nWithin the perinatal mortality rate of 32/1,000 total births, neonatal deaths within the first week (0–7 days) was the majority (80%). Stillbirths were 58% antepartum and 42% intrapartum, respectively. After completion of the MPDSR skills workshops, 20 recommendations were developed from June 2019 to June 2020. At the time of data analysis, 65% (13 of 20) were completed, 15% (three of 20) were in progress and 20% (four of 20) were delayed. Of the recommendations, 60% (12 of 20) related to reducing perinatal deaths. In the first six months of the MPDSR program, the perinatal mortality rate increased (27 to 35/1,000) but maternal mortality decreased (366 to 139/10,000). For the perinatal deaths, this finding suggests that the surveillance and reporting of stillborn and newborn deaths increased after the MPDSR skills workshop.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis is the first study in northeast Namibia to document implications of a functional MPDSR approach in reducing newborn deaths. The first week of life is when a majority of newborn deaths occur. Unless quality of care is improved, and evidence- based strategic interventions implemented during labor, childbirth and immediate postnatal care period, preventable perinatal deaths will not decrease. Improved knowledge and skills by the MPDSR team on what, how, and why capture certain variables, calculation of proportions, ratios and rates played a crucial role in data quality improvement. Results confirm that skills building before introducing or strengthening the MPDSR system is crucial.\n\nF8.3. From pre-implementation to institutionalization: lessons from sustaining a perinatal audit program in South Africa\n\nNatasha Rhoda1, Francesca Palestra2, Sylvia Deganus2, Mary Kinney3, Anne-Marie Bergh4, Robert Pattinson4, Asha S. George3\n\n1University of Cape Town; 2World Health Organization; 3University of the Western Cape, South Africa; 4University of Pretoria\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F8.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC435\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DITJK34431\n\nBackground\n\nUnderstanding implementation of maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is critical for scaling up and strengthening the intervention process. Few countries report robust operational systems at scale in Africa. One exception is South Africa, which has been implementing a perinatal audit program, a form of MPDSR, to capture perinatal mortality, identify modifiable factors, and motivate change through a quality-of-care audit cycle. This study explores the history of initiating, scaling up, and institutionalizing this program in South Africa.\n\nMethods\n\nData collection was undertaken from 2019 to 2020 involving 56 individual interviews with key stakeholders at national, subnational, and facility levels, a desk review, and 10 non-participant observations of meetings related to the perinatal audit program. Data analysis included thematic content analysis of transcripts, content analysis of relevant document, and process mapping. Lessons learned from nearly three decades of implementation were organized by phase and through use of the health policy analysis triangle framework.\n\nResults\n\nMultiple factors influence institutionalization of an audit program, including tangible factors, such as focal points, policies and tools, as well as the societal and systems factors, such as actor interactions and motivations, political priority, and adaption. For South Africa, the national and subnational structures evolved over time and interacted to support implementation benefiting from a continuity of actors, who were able to expand and nurture the network. The perinatal audit program was integrated into national policy and guidelines until recently. Intentional and continuous efforts to demonstrate the impact and enable local adaption allowed for more ownership and buy-in during all phases of implementation. Stagnating mortality reduction along with declining coverage of deliveries reported through the program in recent year’s signaled that backsliding is possible without continuous effort to support implementation.\n\nConclusions\n\nLessons from South Africa’s experience of implementing a perinatal audit program reveal enabling factors, such as core structures, continuous buy-in and policy integration, as well as demonstrates the vulnerabilities to sustainability. To monitor MPDSR uptake and sustainability, we need research approaches that allow exploration of context, local adaption, and underlying issues that support sustainability.\n\nF8.4. Understanding factors affecting implementation of perinatal death reviews in Latin America and the Caribbean: convergent mixed methods study\n\nNatasha Rhoda1, Francesca Palestra2, Sylvia Deganus2, Selvi M Jeyaseelan3, Pablo Duran4\n\n1University of Cape Town; 2World Health Organization; 3University of the West Indies, Barbados; 4Pan American Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F8.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC434\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DITJK34431\n\nBackground\n\nTracking progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals requires timely, high-quality monitoring of data on maternal and newborn health (MNH). Studying perinatal death surveillance and response (PDSR) implementation can lead to continuous quality improvement and greater accountability in MNH. A recent scoping review of PDSR studies found that the use of implementation frameworks leads to more insightful findings that can better guide policy and health systems recommendations. In this paper, we describe country experiences of PDSR in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) and assess the barriers and facilitators in implementing regular perinatal death reviews in low- and middle-income countries and small island developing states.\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a desk review of previous Caribbean-based maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response reviews, followed by a sequential mixed methods design in an effort to build a comprehensive assessment of the factors influencing PDSR implementation. We used the CFIR deterministic framework to promote consistent organization of findings and systematic analysis, which can inform policy and practice of MNH enhancement programs in other contexts. We developed the coding framework based on the select constructs and examined the audit review reports using a content analysis.\n\nResults\n\nIn LAC, 22 countries have completed PDSR activities in the past five years. The desk review revealed that the inner setting (local clinics and hospitals) and outer settings (regional organizations and nongovernmental organizations) worked cohesively to implement infrastructural improvements and human resource capacity-building needed to enhance maternal and perinatal quality of care. Their interwoven structure allowed the completion of comprehensive audit reviews to assess maternal and perinatal deaths and near-miss cases. Competing priorities of the providers involved in MNH care, insufficient local human and technical resources, and the persistence of paper-based records were identified as major barriers to routine implementation of PDSR. Regional organizations were critical in the provision of technical and financial resources to facilitate PDSR processes.\n\nConclusions\n\nLowering perinatal mortality rates is highly dependent on the ability of health systems to learn from positive and negative outcomes through audits such as PDSR.\n\nF8.5. Analysis of National Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) reports from Sub-Saharan Africa: strengths and challenges\n\nSylvia Deganus, Francesca Palestra, Triphonie Nkurunziza, Assumpta W Muriithi, Leopold Ouedraogo, Chilanga Asmani, Hayfa Elamin, Pamela Amaka Onyiah\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F8.5\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC432\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DITJK34431\n\nBackground\n\nThe World Health Organization(WHO) and partners have promoted MPDSR as one of the key measures for accelerating progress toward reducing high rates of preventable maternal and newborn deaths. Countries in the African region have adopted the strategy and are at various stages of implementation. Surveys done have indicated that there are numerous challenges to overcome to maximize the benefits of MPDSR. Analyzing national MPDSR reports provides an opportunity to examine the successes, weaknesses, and threats to MPDSR in the region.\n\nMethods\n\nA desk review was conducted on readily available national MPDSR reports (2016–2022) that countries voluntarily shared with the WHO regional office. The review process focused on how countries implemented and reported on the outcomes related to the various MPDSR audit steps; the comprehensiveness and depths of analysis of findings; and program performance monitoring, and evaluation.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 23 national MPDSR reports were obtained and reviewed; about 50% of all potentially available reports in the region. The majority (56.5%) were from Eastern and Southern Africa. Countries in this these regions appeared to have achieved greater institutionalization of MPDSR systems compared to their Western and Central African counterparts. The release of national reports ranged in frequency from one to three per year. Five out of 23 national reports did not include data on perinatal deaths. Reports on PDSR were generally weaker in content compared to MDSR. The extent and depths of data analysis varied greatly. A notable observation was the finding that countries implementing the confidential enquiry systems had greater in-depth analysis of the contributory factors and risk conditions for the deaths. Some performance assessment of the country’s MPDSR program was included in 91% of reports.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe reviewed reports show that substantial progress has been achieved in the implementation of MPDSR in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly within the Eastern and Southern African zones, as compared to their Western and Central African counterparts. Stronger MPDSR performance was observed in countries implementing confidential enquiry approaches. Numerous opportunities exist for countries within the region to share best practices and support each other to strengthen country MPDSR.\n\nF9.1. Key Lessons from exemplars in Neonatal Mortality Rate/Maternal Mortality Ratio (NMR/MMR) and family planning: positive outliers in neonatal and maternal health and family planning\n\nRyan Fitzgerald1, Asha S. George2, Oona Campbell3, Sylvain Landry Birane Faye4, Sudha Sharma5\n\n1Gates Ventures; 2University of the Western Cape, South Africa; 3London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; 4Cheikh Anta Diop University; 5CIWEC Hospital and Travel Medical Center\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F9.1\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1674\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DKZAX101674\n\nPanel Description\n\nThis panel, led by in-country research partners, highlights key lessons emerging across nine countries that have been identified as positive outliers on the topics of maternal health, neonatal health, and family planning (FP). The three panelists focus on research findings from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, and Senegal, specifically spotlighting factors that have contributed toward progress in these countries. The presentations covers:\n\nInterrelated distal, intermediate, and proximal drivers that contribute toward declines in neonatal and maternal mortality in Exemplar countries. Key drivers typically contribute toward progress in a stepwise manner as countries progress through a transition from higher mortality to lower mortality. Lessons from Exemplars can provide useful insights for peer countries looking to emulate the successes of Exemplar countries.\n\nFP in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has generally made substantial progress in recent decades with select LMICs having demonstrated exemplary progress. This analysis considers drivers of change in FP within specific geographies, alongside a global analysis of drivers for FP. In tandem, this work contributes valuable insights from positive outliers that can be useful for other countries looking to achieve the third Sustainable Development Goal related to healthy lives and well-being.\n\nVoluntary FP empowers people to freely decide whether and when to have children and is also a key upstream contributor to improved health outcomes for mothers and children. Lessons from Exemplars demonstrate the importance of empowering women and improving access to quality health care services along the continuum of reproductive health.\n\nF9.2. Family planning: a key driver of neonatal and maternal mortality reduction in select countries demonstrating exemplary progress\n\nJordan-Tate Thomas1, Ryan Fitzgerald1, Asha S. George2, Oona Campbell3, Ties Boerma4, Sudha Sharma5, Agbessi Amouzou6, Allisyn Moran7, Ira Mrtopullo1, Uzma Syed7\n\n1Gates Ventures; 2University of the Western Cape, South Africa; 3London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; 4University of Manitoba; 5CIWEC Hospital and Travel Medical Center; 6Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; 7World Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F9.2\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1702\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DKZAX101674\n\nBackground\n\nNeonatal and maternal mortality are both valuable indicators that have historically been considered markers of health system strength. Although there have been substantial improvements in both the newborn mortality rate (NMR) and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) globally, certain countries have made particularly notable progress. This analysis—part of the Exemplars in Global Health program—presents findings related to neonatal and maternal health advancements in low- and middle-income countries over the last two decades. In particular, this novel analysis on positive outlier countries helps to expand the global evidence base showing that voluntary family planning helps to avert neonatal and maternal deaths.\n\nMethods\n\nTo identify countries that achieved exemplary progress in improving neonatal and maternal mortality, we compared observed progress to advancements that would have been expected based on change in gross national income. Seven countries were chosen based on reductions of NMR and MMR, data availability, geographical representativeness, and existing partnerships. Once identified, in-depth mixed-methods research was conducted in each country to assess key contributors to NMR and MMR progress.\n\nResults\n\nSeveral themes emerged as key contributors to neonatal and maternal health progress across Exemplar countries. Improvements in access to care during pregnancy and childbirth drove substantial portions of the NMR and MMR reductions. The most important upstream driver identified was fertility decline. In Exemplar countries with particularly sharp fertility declines, such as Bangladesh, decreases in fertility were found to respectively contribute toward 44% and 47% of MMR and NMR reductions. Access to modern contraception, female education, delayed age at first marriage, declining NMR itself, and broadly evolving views about the role of women in society all influenced fertility rates. These results can be synthesized with emerging findings from Exemplars in Family Planning to highlight approaches to increasing modern contraceptive prevalence.\n\nConclusions\n\nInterrelated distal, intermediate, and proximal drivers contribute toward declines in neonatal and maternal mortality in Exemplar countries. Voluntary family planning empowers people to freely decide whether and when to have children and is also a key upstream contributor to improved health outcomes for mothers and children. Lessons from Exemplars demonstrate the importance of empowering women and improving access to quality health care services along the continuum of reproductive health.\n\nF9.3. Key findings from exemplars in neonatal and maternal mortality\n\nRyan Fitzgerald1, Ties Boerma2, Oona Campbell3, Sylvain Landry Birane Faye4, Sudha Sharma5, Agbessi Amouzou6, Allisyn Moran7, Jordan-Tate Thomas1\n\n1Gates Ventures; 2University of Manitoba, South Africa; 3London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; 4Cheikh Anta Diop University; 5CIWEC Hospital and Travel Medical Center; 6Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; 7World Health Organization\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F9.3\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1701\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DKZAX101674\n\nBackground\n\nNeonatal and maternal mortality are both valuable indicators that have historically been considered markers of health system strength. Although there have been substantial improvements in the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) globally, certain countries have made particularly notable progress. This analysis—part of the Exemplars in Global Health program—presents findings on neonatal and maternal health advancements in low- and middle-income countries over the last two decades.\n\nMethods\n\nTo identify countries that achieved exemplary progress in improving neonatal and maternal mortality, we compared the rate of change in NMR/MMR to change in the gross national income to identify countries that performed exceptionally relative to their economic progress. Seven countries were chosen based on reductions of NMR and MMR, data availability, geographical representativeness, and existing partnerships. Once identified, in-depth mixed-methods research was conducted in each country to assess key contributors to progress, utilizing a mortality transition framework that includes five stages of mortality levels.\n\nResults\n\nSeveral themes emerged as key contributors to neonatal and maternal health progress across Exemplar countries. These contributors were identified to occur in successive stages along the transition from high-mortality to low-mortality states. Fertility decline was a critical driver of progress from high-mortality stage I to stage II, and was associated with higher rates of contraception use. Increased contact with key services such as antenatal care, institutional delivery, cesarean-section, and postnatal care were subsequently linked to further progress along the transition as countries entered stage III. Finally, improvements in equity gaps were associated with progress to the most advanced stages of the transition as quality interventions became available to poorer and more rural communities in stage IV. Together, Exemplar countries at distinct stages of this transition illustrate a stepwise path toward improved neonatal and maternal health outcomes.\n\nConclusions\n\nNew research shows that interrelated distal, intermediate, and proximal drivers contribute toward declines in neonatal and maternal mortality in Exemplar countries. The trajectory and drivers of change were not universal, but certain themes consistently emerged as contributors to success. Lessons from Exemplars in neonatal and maternal health provide useful insight for peer countries looking to emulate the successes that Exemplar countries have achieved.\n\nF9.4. What are we learning about exemplary progress and practices in family planning?\n\nIra Mrtopullo1, Jordan-Tate Thomas1, Ryan Fitzgerald1, Allisyn Moran2, Sylvia Landry Birane Faye3\n\n1Gates Ventures; 2World Health Organization; 3Cheikh Anta Diop University\n\nBMC Proceedings 2024, 18(5):F9.4\n\nSubmission ID #: IMNHC1699\n\nPanel ID# (if applicable): DKZAX101674\n\nBackground\n\nThere has been significant progress in family planning (FP) access and utilization in recent decades but it is not equitable across countries and regions. This Exemplars in Global Health analysis presents findings on FP advancements in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over the last decade, including linkages with reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality.\n\nMethods\n\nTo select Exemplar countries in FP, we compared observed progress in modern contraceptive prevalence (mCPR) and demand satisfied for modern contraception to expected advancements based on improvements in the Human Development Index (HDI) from 2010–2020 for 130 LMICs. Six positive outlier countries were identified, including one of the Exemplars in maternal mortality ratio (MMR)/neonatal mortality rate (NMR), accounting for regional representation, data availability, population size, and existing partnerships. In-depth mixed-methods research is underway in the first three countries and will begin in three additional countries in 2023 to explain key drivers of improvements. A complementary global Shapley decomposition assessed key drivers of progress in the same FP metrics globally at population level.\n\nResults\n\nPositive outliers from multiple models were evaluated as potential Exemplars. The first round of country selection identified Malawi, Kenya, and Senegal; three more countries will be confirmed by end of 2022. In-depth qualitative and quantitative findings from each country are being processed to provide a holistic explanation of exemplary improvement in FP, including the role of high-impact practices in family planning. Senegal is also an Exemplar in MMR/NMR, and we are coordinating to investigate the effects of improvement in FP. The global decomposition found that income and knowledge of methods are important drivers of mCPR and demand satisfied globally; we are exploring these relationships further at the country level.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur research describes FP advancements among LMICs, highlighting lessons learned from Exemplar countries. Considering drivers of progress in FP and NMR/MMR within specific geographies, alongside a global analysis of drivers for FP, can yield actionable insights toward achieving the third Sustainable Development Goal on healthy lives and well-being.\n\nF10.1.
