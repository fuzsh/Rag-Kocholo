        "text": "VERMILLION, S.D. - The No. 23-ranked South Dakota Coyotes look to continue their momentum after one of the biggest wins in school history this past weekend over defending FCS national champion and top-ranked Eastern Washington University 30-17. This week, the Coyotes host Northwestern Oklahoma State Saturday at 4 p.m. in the DakotaDome. The Coyotes stand at 1-1 on the year, while the Rangers are 0-2.\n\nScouting the Rangers The Rangers enter the week with an 0-2 record after a 41-0 setback Saturday at NCAA Division II foe Colorado State-Pueblo. In that game, the Rangers struggled offensively as CSUP out-gained NWOSU 339-295. The Thunderwolves raced out to a 34-0 lead at halftime and never looked back. NWOSU was led by 214 passing yards from Kyle Jech, 52 rushing yards from Jared Jackson and 113 yards receiving from Kent McDonald. In the Rangers' opener versus Southwest Oklahoma State, the Rangers were down early, but two fourth quarter touchdown passes by Jech brought his team within three with 30 seconds left, but NWOSU was unable to recover the onside kick. NWOSU was ranked 13th nationally in the NAIA poll to begin the season. Leading the way for the Rangers this season is Jech who is 36 of 68 for 455 yards with three interceptions and two touchdowns. On the ground the Rangers are led by Jackson who is averaging 83.5 yards per game and has two scores on the year. McDonald leads the team with 224 yards and two scores for a 112.0 average on 15 receptions. Defensively, the Rangers are led by Michael Ray who has a team-high 14 tackles with six solo stops and eight assists. Michael Harmon leads the team with 10 solo tackles, while Ray has an interception. The Rangers finished the 2010 season with an 8-3 mark including a 48-14 loss to South Dakota in the DakotaDome Sept. 18, 2010. NWOSU lost in the first round of the NAIA playoffs with a 33-14 setback at Sioux Falls who jumped to NCAA Division II this season. Head coach Keith Barefield is 30-16 in his fifth season at the helm of the Ranger program. He is 96-49-2 in his 15th career season. The Rangers return six starters on offense and six on defense finishing the 2010 season 15th nationally in NAIA. Scouting the Coyotes Coming off of arguably one of the biggest win in school history the Coyotes look to keep the momentum going this week. South Dakota, ranked 23rd in the latest FCS Coaches Poll, is led by senior veterans on both sides of the ball. Senior quarterback Dante Warren leads the offense as he is 23 of 41 for 310 yards with three touchdowns and four interceptions. Senior running back Chris Ganious is averaging 82 yards per game and has 164 total yards thus far. Senior wide receiver Jeremy Blount leads the team with two touchdown catches, including a thrilling 48-yard catch Saturday as he blew past the EWU defense. Junior Will Powell leads the team with eight catches and 101 yards. Defensively, the Coyotes are led by reigning Great West Conference Defensive Player of the Week in Adam Broders who tied his career-high with 15 tackles Saturday versus Eastern Washington. Broders leads the team with 22 tackles (11 unassisted and 11 assisted). Senior Shea Williams has 15 tackles, while sophomore Tyler Starr has had a huge first two games recording 12 tackles, a team and conference high three sacks, one pass breakup, a conference-leading three forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. Senior Jimmy Thompson leads the team with two interceptions, including a thrilling 66-yard touchdown return Saturday. Junior punter Cole Zwiefelhofer has continued to punt well this season. He has a 42.2 average with 10 punts for 422 yards. He kicked a career-long 72-yard punt at Air Force (Sept. 3) and followed with a 63-yarder Saturday. Sophomore place kicker, Kevin Robb, hit three huge field goals Saturday helping keep the Eagles at arm's length throughout. Robb earned GWC Special Teams Player of the Week honors for his efforts. He leads the team in scoring with 14 points. Head coach Ed Meierkort is 49-31 in his eighth season at the helm of the Coyotes. He is 35-5 in the DakotaDome. 19 starters and 22 seniors return for the Coyotes this season. Coyote History Versus the Rangers The Coyotes own a 1-0 record in the series as the teams met last season in Vermillion. South Dakota posted a 48-14 win Sept. 18, 2010. The Coyotes put together a dominating performance in their home-opener last season. The offense racked up 455 total yards, while Ganious notched his first 100-yard rushing effort of the season with 118 yards and a touchdown, while Warren threw four touchdowns on 13 of 19 for 156 yards. Powell had three catches for 99 yards and a touchdown.\n\nLast Time Out: South Dakota 30, No. 1 Eastern Washington 17 The South Dakota football team recorded one of the biggest wins in program history with a 30-17 win over No.1-ranked and defending FCS national champion Eastern Washington Saturday at the DakotaDome. It was the Coyotes' first-ever win over a No. 1-ranked team since moving to Division I FCS status. The Coyotes (1-1) used all phases of the game to upend the higher-powered Eagles. Their offense was efficient - rushing for 198 yards and finishing with 324 total yards. The defense held Eastern Washington (0-2) to only 11 rushing yards and forced two key turnovers, while the special teams converted three key field goals to help the Coyotes pull the upset. Senior running back Chris Ganious (Houston, Texas) had 85 yards rushing on 15 carries. Senior quarterback Dante Warren (Arlington Heights, Ill.) was 8-of-15 passing for 126 yards and a touchdown; he also rushed for 59 yards. Junior receiver Will Powell (Sioux Falls, S.D.) had five catches for 49 yards. Ganious moved into third all-time on the school's career rushing list as he has 2,564 career yards surpassing Jared Schwenn (1994-97) with 2,513 yards.\n\nSenior linebacker Adam Broders (Bloomfield, Neb.) had a game-high 15 tackles for the Coyotes, while senior linebacker Shea Williams (Alexandria, S.D.) had 10 stops. Reigning Great West Conference Defensive Player of the Week and CFPA National Defensive Lineman of the Week, sophomore Tyler Starr (Little Rock, Iowa) had two sacks to go along with five tackles. Broders tied his career-high in tackles matching last season's output against Northern Iowa. The Coyote defense controlled the first quarter, holding Eastern Washington to just 52 yards on 18 plays - and just three first downs. The Coyotes' first touchdown came as a result of a three-play, 45-yard drive - which included a 14-yard run by senior Jeremy Blount (Tampa, Fla.), and a big 26-yard run by Ganious. Warren capped off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown on a quarterback draw for a 7-0 lead. South Dakota added to the lead in the second quarter thanks to another big play. Warren found a streaking Blount down the middle for a 48-yard touchdown, giving the Coyotes a 14-0 lead with 10:55 left in the half. In the second half, Eastern Washington kicked a field goal to cut the Coyote lead to 21-10, but the Coyotes responded with a 33-yard field goal by sophomore Kevin Robb (Rapid City, S.D.) with 1:24 left in the third quarter to push the lead back to 24-10. Eastern Washington came back with a quick touchdown on four plays using just 1:16 off the clock to cut the lead to 24-17 as the third quarter closed. Wide receiver Greg Herd caught a 27-yard pass from Mitchell for the score. Each time the Eagles crept closer, the Coyotes answered. The Coyotes went on an eight-play, 44-yard drive - keyed by a 23-yard pass from Warren to Powell plus a 12-yard run by Powell - that was capped off by a 33-yard field goal by Robb with 11:40 left to give the Coyotes a 27-17 lead. The Eagles began driving on the ensuing possession, but the Coyote defense again answered the call. Senior Marquis Butler (Los Angeles, Calif.) intercepted Mitchell deep in Coyote territory, and his big 63-yard return gave South Dakota the ball in EWU territory with 9:54 left in the contest. South Dakota turned Butler's interception return into a 30-yard field goal by Robb with 4:23 left to make the scored 30-17. The Coyotes forced a turnover on downs on Eastern Washington's final offensive possession to ice the win.\n\n2011 South Dakota Football Media Guide Season Outlook Facing one of the toughest schedules in school history along with the loss of 12 starters, the South Dakota football team posted a 4-7 overall mark and a 1-3 mark in the Great West Conference in 2010. This fall finds the Coyotes with a much more seasoned roster as they return 19 of 22 starters from the 2010 squad, plus the 2010 Great West Conference Special Teams Player of the Year, punter Cole Zwiefelhofer, kicker Kevin Robb and kick returner Jeremy Blount. The Coyotes, under eighth year head coach Ed Meierkort, return 13 players who received All-Great West honors in 2010.\n\nOffense Lettermen Returning/Lost: 26/5 Starters Returning/Lost: 9/2 The offensive line remains a consistent strength of the Coyotes, who lose starting guard Scott Slotten, but return four starters. That group is led by first-team all-conference selection Tom Compton, a senior now entering his fourth year as a starter. Compton, an emerging NFL prospect, anchors the left-tackle position for the Coyotes and earned All-America status from PhilSteele.Com in 2010. All-GWC honorable mention selections Brent Johnson, a senior, and Tim Ross, a junior, return at right guard and center, respectively, while senior RJ Polley returns at right tackle. Other players battling for time on the offensive line include Broc Gullet, Steve Nelson, Cody O'Neill, Matt Porisch, Marc Murtha, Adam Praska and Andrew Schofield. Senior Erik Helland will likely start at fullback for the fourth consecutive season and will be supported by junior Quintin McMartin. Both will block for senior starter Chris Ganious at running back. Ganious earned All-GWC first team honors in 2010 for a second straight year after rushing for 817 yards. The Coyotes are deep in the backfield as junior Marcus Sims and sophomores Michael Burrus and Earv Archambeau, as well as freshman Noah Pearl all could factor into the mix. Senior Dante Warren is back for his second year as the Coyotes' starting quarterback. The versatile Warren, a threat to pass or run, was an All-GWC second team selection in 2010 after accounting for 2,530 yards of total offense. Redshirt freshman Josh Vander Maten and sophomore Kyle Cichos are battling for the backup spot. The Coyotes graduated the top two tight ends on the depth chart, London Landry and Mitch Mohr, both of whom earned All-GWC honors. Junior Joel DeJongh returns to lead the way at the position. Tyler Wilhelm, a converted quarterback, Michael Neilson, and junior college transfer Jay Burns provide depth at the position. Another position of strength for the Coyotes is wide receiver, led by junior Will Powell. Powell, a second team All-GWC selection a year ago, caught 47 passes for 933 yards and 10 touchdowns, all team highs. Senior Dustin Nowotny, senior Jeremy Blount, and sophomore transfer Anthony Williams give the Coyotes a diverse, talented receiving corps.\n\nDefense Lettermen Returning/Lost: 32/3 Starters Returning/Lost: 10/1 The defensive line returns a strong core group, led by seniors Jesse Weisbrod and Evan Capper. Juniors David Giese and Jordan Eaton also return. Adding to the mix on the defensive line are senior Andrew Meier, a converted linebacker, redshirt sophomore Tyler Starr, senior Sidney Bazemore, redshirt freshmen Chase Irvin-Salazar and Kenny Greer, and sophomores Mike Pharis and Taylor Moore. South Dakota's linebacking core has plenty of experience and depth returning. Inside linebacker will be anchored by returning senior starters Shea Williams and Adam Broders. The 'Yotes must replace starting linebacker Cory Kuehl, but have plenty of players in contention for spots, including senior Kyle Wheeler, juniors Darius Hogans, Tim Marlette, D'Angelo Butler, Kyle Shanker and Zack Wilson, along with sophomore Kelan Richardson and redshirt freshman Kyle Guziec. Defensive back returns all four starters from a year ago. Senior Shane Potter is back at strong safety, with sophomore Aaron Swift returning at the free safety spot after taking over for the injured Jim Thompson early in 2010. Thompson is healthy and is a strong contender to return at the free safety spot. At corner, senior Marquis Butler and sophomore Dametrius Turner are back as starters, with junior Alphonso Valdez, sophomore Chris Frierson and redshirt freshman Chris Lundy pushing for playing time.\n\nSpecial Teams Starters Returning/Lost: 3/0 The Coyotes welcome back the key pieces of their special teams, including Zwiefelhofer, one of the nation's top punters. Zwiefelhofer averaged 43.2 yards per punt in 2010, which was good for fourth in the nation, placing 18 inside the 20-yard line. Kevin Robb returns at kicker after a solid freshman campaign, with Blount back as a kick returner after another solid campaign in 2010.\n\n2011 Coyote Sports Hall of Fame Class Inducted Saturday The University of South Dakota inducted five former student-athletes, former women's basketball coach Chad Lavin, along with special contributor Jim Houtz and the 2007-2008 women's basketball team in the special achievement category, into the Coyote Sports Hall of Fame this morning in a ceremony at the Muenster University Center. Former Coyote athletes Craig Austin (Football, 1978-1981), Nathan Blessen (Men's Basketball, 1996-2000), Jason Leber (Football, 1993-1996), Lionel McPhaull (Men's Track and Field, 1994-1998), and Julie Tolstedt-LaFleur (Women's Track and Field, 1978-1983), join Lavin and Houtz as inductees for the Class of 2011.\n\nDefend the Dome South Dakota has a reputation for playing tough on its home turf. The Coyotes are 35-5 (.875) in the DakotaDome under Meierkort, including a 23-game winning streak from Nov. 15, 2003, to Nov. 10, 2007. Since the Dome opened in 1979, USD has a 125-58 (.683) record in the building.\n\nCount on Coach Ed Meierkort wasted no time in establishing himself as one of the best head football coaches in USD history. He is 49-31 in his eighth season with the Coyotes, including 23-16 in conference play, as his teams have broken more than 100 school records during that span.\n\nUSD posted nine wins his first three seasons, the first time in school history the Coyotes had accomplished the feat. His 49 wins put him fourth on USD's career victories list, while his .615 winning percentage also ranks fourth. Meierkort has posted a 35-5 record in the DakotaDome, including a 23-game win streak.\n\nCoyotes Ranked in FCS Coaches Poll After the 30-17 win over then-No. 1 Eastern Washington, the Coyotes are ranked 23rd in the latest FCS Coaches Poll released Monday. This is the first time the Coyotes have been ranked since a No. 20 ranking prior to a game at North Dakota State last season. South Dakota is the only team ranked in the poll from the Great West Conference this week.\n\nBig Time Broders Senior linebacker Adam Broders (Bloomfield, Neb.) tied his career-high with 15 tackles (seven solo and eight assisted) versus Eastern Washington Saturday. He was named Great West Conference Defensive Player of the Week for his efforts. Broders leads the team with 22 tackles (11 solo and 11 assisted) both are team-highs.\n\nRobb Earns Player of the Week Sophomore Kevin Robb (Rapid City, S.D.) had three huge field goals Saturday helping the Coyotes to a thrilling 30-17 win over then-No. 1 Eastern Washington. It was the first time Robb has converted three field goals in a game. He was good from 33, 33, and 30 yards all in the second half.\n\nThompson Interception Senior Jim Thompson (Hayward, Wis.) has two interceptions on the season to lead the team and the conference. His second pick came at the right time as he took a 4th and 3 Bo Levi Mitchell pass to the house for a thrilling 67-yard pick-six Saturday as the Coyotes upset defending national champion Eastern Washington.\n\nGanious Gaining Senior Chris Ganious (Houston, Texas)had 85 yards rushing Saturday as he moved into third-place on the school's all-time rushing yards record. He has 2,564 career yards surpassing Jared Schwenn (1994-1997) who had 2,513 yards.\n\nBlount Sets Career Mark Senior wide receiver/return specialist Jeremy Blount (Tampa, Fla.) returned the first kick of the game 25 yards setting the school record for career kick return yards against Eastern Washington Saturday. Blount entered the season 47 yards behind James Vann (1985-89). Blount now has 1,376 career kick return yards.\n\nVersus a No. 1 The Coyotes are 1-1 in their last two meetings with teams ranked No. 1. Prior to Saturday, South Dakota last played a No. 1 losing 35-17 at No. 1 Grand Valley State in the NCAA Division II playoffs, Nov. 26, 2006, in Allendale, Mich. Eastern Washington was the first Division I FCS team to visit the DakotaDome.\n\nAgainst Ranked Teams With the win over Eastern Washington Saturday, the Coyotes snapped an 11-game losing skid to ranked teams dating back to a 31-28 win over then-No. 17 ranked Northwood University (Michigan) in the first round of the NCAA Division II tournament Nov. 18, 2006.\n\nStarr Sacks Sophomore defensive end Tyler Starr (Little Rock, Iowa) continued his strong start to the season. He had a huge sack on EWU quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell Saturday for his team and conference-leading third sack of the year. Starr has 12 tackles on the year, including 10 solo tackles and has earned GWC Defensive Player of the Week honors and CPA National Defensive Player of the Week honors at Air Force (Sept. 3).\n\nStrong-Legged Zwiefelhofer Junior punter, Cole Zwiefelhofer (Chippewa Falls, Wis.) had a career-long 72 yard punt on at Air Force Sept 3. He was named CFPA Honorable Mention National Punter of the Week for his efforts. Zwiefelhofer then followed with a 61-yard punt against then-No. 1 Eastern Washington Saturday. He has punted 10 times this season for a 42.2 average.\n\nStrong 4th Quarter Last season the Coyotes started fast and faded in the fourth quarter. That was not the case in the season opener at Air Force as the Coyotes outscored Air Force 13-0 in the fourth quarter against a majority of the Falcons' first string players. The Coyote defense also stood strong late in the game, forcing a pair of fumbles and an interception. The Coyotes then added six points in the final frame to keep then-No. 1 Eastern Washington at arm's length en route to a 30-17 upset win. South Dakota has outscored its opponents 19-0 in the fourth quarter this season.\n\nNeilson Makes Impact Senior Michael Neilson (Gilbert, Ariz.) made his first catch as a Coyote in the season opener for 13 yards setting up the first touchdown of the season in the second quarter. Neilson started as a tight end last season, but switched to the defensive line. Neilson also had a big catch against EWU for 17 yards setting up another touchdown in the first half Saturday. He transferred to South Dakota from Mesa Community College.\n\nCoyotes in the GWC South Dakota ranks first in a number of areas in the Great West Conference. The Coyotes are first in net punting (37.5), third down percentage at a 43.3 clip. They are first in field goal percentage (1.000) and fourth down percentage (1.000).
