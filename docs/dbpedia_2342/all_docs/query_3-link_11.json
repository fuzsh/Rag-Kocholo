        "text": "The American Association of Equine Practitioners and the American Association of Feline Practitioners recently announced separate partnerships with Fort Dodge Animal Health to promote twice-a-year wellness examinations for horses and cats. Dubbed “America's Healthy Horse,” the AAEP campaign focuses on equine wellness issues such as disease prevention, parasite control, nutrition, and dentistry. The AAFP's campaign, called “Great Cat Watch,” urges cat owners to watch for behavior changes that can be subtle signs of illness. This photograph, submitted by Dr. George F. Sutton, won first place in the JAVMA 1996 National Pet Week Photo Contest.\n\nVeterinary medicine in California recently scored a major victory when a state court struck down a city ordinance banning the surgical procedure of animal declawing.\n\nVeterinarians in West Hollywood had been prohibited from performing onychectomies on domestic cats since April 2003 when the city council outlawed the surgery as inhumane.\n\nThe California VMA sued West Hollywood, however, asserting the city had infringed on veterinarians' state-granted rights to practice within the scope of their licenses. The Los Angeles Superior Court agreed and ruled against the West Hollywood prohibition on Nov. 30.\n\n“(The judge's) ruling sends a clear message to West Hollywood and all other California cities that local municipalities cannot pass ordinances that ignore the authority of California's state licensing and regulatory oversight boards,” said CVMA president, Dr. Eric Weigand.\n\nWest Hollywood, a progressive city where pet owners are pet guardians, made headlines when it became the first U.S. city to outlaw cat declawing within city limits. Earlier, council members had condemned onychectomies and directed the city attorney to investigate the legality of prohibiting veterinarians from performing the procedures (see JAVMA, June 1, 2003, page 1486).\n\nThe ordinance was criticized by the CVMA as well as the Cat Fanciers' Association, which, while opposed to declawing, considered the decision a private matter between the veterinarian and cat owner.\n\nThe CVMA filed a lawsuit against West Hollywood in Los Angeles Superior Court, challenging the city's ban in March 2005. The association contended the ordinance was in direct conflict with and preempted by the California Veterinary Practice Act and the Business and Professions Code, which invalidates the West Hollywood measure.\n\n“It is unfortunate that the CVMA is forced to pursue this issue through legal action,” said then CVMA president Dr. Jon Klingborg. “But clearly the West Hollywood City Council stands in direct opposition to the rights of veterinarians to practice medicine in the best interest of their patients and clients.”\n\nThe practice of veterinary medicine is highly regulated in California, the CVMA asserted, and the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act specifically regulates what veterinarians may or may not do within the scope of practicing veterinary medicine. Moreover, the California legislature has delegated to the California Veterinary Medical Board the authority to carry out and enforce the provisions of the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act.\n\nThe CVMA also argued the importance of having a single set of rules regulating the practice of veterinary medicine in California. If each one of the 478 California cities had its own set of rules, it would be confusing for pet owners and difficult for veterinarians to provide care for pets, the CVMA explained. Ultimately, this could create a chaotic situation.\n\nThe CVMA was not alone in its criticism of the ordinance. The California Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates the state's veterinarians, issued an opinion in 2004 that emphasized local governments are prohibited from enacting legislation in an area already regulated by a state agency.\n\n“Decisions regarding the practice of veterinary medicine should be left to veterinarians, who have the best interests of the patient and animal owners in mind,” Dr. Weigand said. “The court's decision ensures that pets in West Hollywood and throughout California will receive the best care available, as consistently regulated by California law.”\n\n—R.
