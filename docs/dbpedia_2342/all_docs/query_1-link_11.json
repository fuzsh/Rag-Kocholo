Picked to finish ninth in the preseason, the Bluejays are 8-7 in league play, which puts them in fourth place with three games to play.\n\nThe Bluejays are scoring 79.1 points per game and are 13-0 when scoring 80 or more points this season, though they haven't reached that mark since February 6th.\n\nBoston University transfer Maurice Watson Jr. leads Creighton with 6.5 assists per contest and 15.1 points per game, while Geoffrey Groselle tops the club with 5.9 rebounds per game and is third with 10.5 points per game. He's shooting 68.3 percent from the field this year, fourth nationally among players with at least five attempts per game.\n\nIsaiah Zierden (10.7 ppg., 1.5 spg.) is tied for the BIG EAST lead with 67 three-pointers made while also pacing the Bluejays with 42 steals and 85.9 percent marksmanship at the free-throw line.\n\nScouting St. John's\n\nSt. John's is 8-21 on the season and 1-15 in BIG EAST play. The Red Storm snapped a program-record 16-game losing streak with a 80-65 win over DePaul on February 17th, and followed that up with a one-point loss against Seton Hall last Sunday before losing at DePaul, 83-75, on Thursday.\n\nDurand Johnson, a graduate transfer from Pitt, is first on the team with 12.0 points per contest and second with 35 steals and 49 three-point baskets.\n\nFreshman Federico Mussini is second on the Red Storm in scoring (11.0 ppg.) but leads the club in assists (68) and steals (37), while also draining a team-high 54 three-point baskets and topping the club in free-throw percentage (.869).\n\nSix others average more than 7.1 points per game, a group paced by Missouri State transfer Ron Mvouika's 8.7 points per game.\n\nSJU had all five starters depart from last year's NCAA Tournament team that finished 21-12.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his sixth season as head coach at Creighton. He is 138-68 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 418-263 in his 22nd season and is 287-199 in his 15th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Preston Murphy.\n\nChris Mullin (St. John's, 1998) owns an 8-21 record in his first season at St. John's, which also doubles as his career mark. The three-time BIG EAST Player of the Year and NBA Hall of Famer, who led St. John's to the 1985 Final Four, returned to his alma mater in the spring in place of Steve Lavin. Mullin is assisted by Barry Rohrssen, Matt Abdelmassih and Greg St. Jean.\n\nThe Series With St. John's\n\nSt. John's leads the all-time series with Creighton by a 7-5 count, but Creighton has won all four previous meetings in Omaha.\n\nThe teams have traded wins and losses over the past eight meetings, including CU's 80-70 win in Queens on New Year's Eve this season.\n\nGreg McDermott is 3-2 against St. John's and 1-0 against Chris Mullin.\n\nSenior Day Looms\n\nCreighton will honor two senior players following Sunday's game, as Geoffrey Groselle and James Milliken will be recognized. Groselle is a fifth-year senior currently in graduate school, while Milliken transferred in prior to the 2012-13 season and is wrapping up his third year in the program.\n\nDuring the past five years, Creighton has gone 115-52. The team has been to the NCAA Tournament three times, winning a game each trip. Groselle also won two league tournaments and one regular-season conference title in 2012-13.\n\nCreighton is 5-0 against in-state rival Nebraska since Groselle arrived on campus, 9-2 in conference tournament play, and he and Milliken have combined for 1,018 points, 404 rebounds and 119 assists in a collective 52 starts.\n\nHome Season Finale History\n\nCreighton is 18-2 in the last 20 years in its final home game of the regular-season, losing only in 2002 to Drake, and last year to Xavier.\n\nEach of the last 16 Creighton teams to win on Senior Day would go on to reach the postseason.\n\n40 Points Possible?\n\nThere have only been four efforts of 40 points or more in a game at CenturyLink Center Omaha, as Cavel Witter (42 points vs. Bradley on 3/1/08), Evansville's Colt Ryan (43 points at CU on 2/21/12), Doug McDermott (41 points vs. Wichita State on 3/2/13) and McDermott again (45 points vs. Providence on 3/7/14) have done it.\n\nAll four 40-plus point outings came on a Creighton Senior Day.\n\nMcDermott's 45 points vs. Providence make him the last Bluejay to score 40 or more in a game, while Marcus Hatten is the last St. John's player to score 40 or more when he put up 44 vs. Rutgers on March 6, 2003.\n\nThis season, Creighton has not had a player score more than 32 points in any game, while St. John's single-game scoring high this season is 24.\n\nSenior Citizens\n\nBelow is a list of statistics by the Creighton players honored during Senior Day since 2003.\n\nName Pts.

Regular-season head-to-head results.\n\n2. Each team's record vs. the team or group of tied teams occupying the highest position in the standings. If an advantage is not determined, proceed to the next team or group of tied teams in the standing for comparison. Continue down through the standings until one team gains an advantage.\n\n3. Compare the Conference road record of the tied teams.\n\n4. Compare all tied teams Conference-games only road record vs. the team(s) occupying the highest position in the final Conference regular-season standings, and then counting down through the standings until one team gains an advantage.\n\n5. RPI ranking as published by RPIratings.com as of the last day of the regular season competition.\n\n6. Coin flip.\n\nMultiple-Team Tie (3 or More Teams)\n\n1. Teams are viewed as a \"mini-conference\" when comparing head-to-head results. The team with the best record vs. the other teams in the mini-conference gains the advantage. The team with the worst record vs. the other teams in the mini-conference is seeded the lowest.\n\na. If only two teams have the same best winning percentage in the mini-conference, the higher seed goes to the team winning the head-to-head series.\n\nb. If the two teams split their two games, then proceed to Step 2 under \"Two-Team ties\" (above). To seed the remaining team(s) in this mini-conference, proceed to (e) below.\n\nc. If three or more (but not all) teams have the same best winning percentage in the original mini-conference, then those tied teams create a new mini-conference and follow this same procedure beginning of Step 1 (Multiple Team Tie).\n\nd. If all teams in the mini-conference have the same mini-conference record, proceed to Step 2 below.\n\ne. After the top or bottom teams in a mini-conference are determined, the remaining teams are ranked by their record in the original mini-conference.\n\ni. If there are any remaining teams tied by their record in the mini-conference, then head-to-head results will determine the higher seed.\n\nii. If the teams split two games, then proceed back to the two-way breaking procedure.\n\niii. If there are at least three teams remaining tied by their record in the mini-conference, they would then form a new mini-conference and follow the procedure again at the beginning of Step 1 (Multiple-Team Tie).\n\n2. Compare each team's record vs. the team or group of tied teams occupying the highest position in the standings. If an advantage is not determined, proceed to the next team or group of tied teams in the standings for comparison. Continue down through the standings until one or more teams gains an advantage. If two teams have the exact same advantage (i.e., having the same and better record against a compared team relative to their mini-conference), they are separated at that point by the two-way tiebreaker procedure. The next step would take you back to Step 1 (e) (Multiple-Team Tie).\n\n3. If more than two teams are still tied, a comparison of the tied teams Conference game only road records.\n\n4. If more than two teams are still tied, a comparison of the tied teams Conference-games only road records vs. the team(s) occupying the highest position in the final Conference regular-season standings, and then continuing down through the standings until one team gains an advantage.\n\nWhen arriving at another group of tied teams while comparing records, use each team's record against the collective tied teams as a group (prior to that group's own tie-breaking procedure), rather than the performance against individual tied teams.\n\nIf at any point the multiple-teams tie is reduced to two teams, the two-team tie-breaking procedures above will be applied. Once a team is eliminated from a multi-team comparison, it is dropped from further comparisons.\n\n5. Coin flip.\n\nWatson Can Score, Too\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. has scored 10 or more points in each of Creighton's last 10 games. He's the first Bluejay with a double-figure streak that long since Doug McDermott finished his career with 28 straight games of 10+ points in 2014.\n\nThat streak is tied for the third-longest active spell in the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nActive Streaks of Consecutive Games With 10+ Points\n\nBIG EAST Players\n\nStreak Name, School Next\n\n25 Henry Ellenson, Marquette 2/27\n\n15 Isaiah Whitehead, Seton Hall 2/28\n\n10 Maurice Watson Jr., Creighton 2/28\n\n10 L.J.

The last team to pull such an upset was Feb. 25, 2002, when Drake won at the Omaha Civic Auditorium on a Senior Day.\n\nSt. John's enters Sunday's match-up with an 8-21 record this season.\n\nMcDermott Ties McManus On CU Wins List\n\nGreg McDermott currently has 138 victories, tying him with John J. \"Red\" McManus (1959-69) for third place on CU's all-time wins list.\n\nMcDermott's .670 winning percentage is Creighton's best since Arthur A. Schabinger's .714 win rate more 80 years ago.\n\nBelow is a list of the most victorious Creighton coaches in program history.\n\nMost Coaching Wins, Creighton History\n\nRk.

Hanson is 157-for-247 (63.6 percent) in his career and still has another year to go.\n\nField Goal Percentage, Career (min. 300 att.)\n\nRank Pct.

The only loss came on Jan. 9, 2005 to Southern Illinois.\n\nThe game vs. St. John's will be Creighton's only Sunday home game this season, and first since a Nov. 23, 2014 win over North Carolina Central.\n\n3D The Key\n\nCreighton's defense has gained some acclaim of late, and been a key indicator of success in recent weeks.\n\nIn Creighton's eight BIG EAST victories, Bluejay opponents are shooting just 30.6 percent from three-point range and only making 5.1 treys per game.\n\nIn Creighton's seven BIG EAST losses, Bluejay opponents are shooting 37.9 percent from downtown while sinking 8.3 trifectas per game.\n\nPlaying With The Lead At Home\n\nCreighton has not trailed in 8-of-16 home games this season, and 60-of-219 overall games played at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time.\n\nAgainst The BIG EAST\n\nSince joining the BIG EAST in 2014, Creighton is unbeaten at home against St. John's, the only team it can say that for. On Wednesday, CU treks to Providence, one of two places it hasn't won (along with Georgetown).\n\nTeam CU Home Games CU Road Games\n\nButler 2-1 1-2\n\nDePaul 2-1 3-0\n\nGeorgetown 2-1 0-3\n\nMarquette 2-1 2-1\n\nProvidence 1-2 0-2\n\nSeton Hall 1-2 2-1\n\nSt. John's 2-0 1-2\n\nVillanova 1-2 1-2\n\nXavier 2-1 1-1\n\nTotal 15-11 11-14\n\nWatson Named National Player of the Week\n\nCreighton guard Maurice Watson Jr. was named National Player of the Week by CBSSports.com and NBCSports.com on Feb. 15th after leading the Bluejays to a pair of wins in the previous week. He was also the BIG EAST Player of the Week for the second time this season for his efforts.\n\nWatson averaged 25.0 points, 7.5 assists, 6.0 rebounds and 2.0 steals as Creighton defeated No. 5 Xavier (70-56) and won at Marquette (65-62). Watson made 54.5 percent of his shots from the field and 81.3 percent of his free throw attempts.\n\nThe Philadelphia, Pa., native began his week with 32 points, seven rebounds, five assists and two steals in Creighton's victory over No. 5 Xavier. Watson scored 22 of his points after the intermission as Creighton picked up a win at home over a top-five team for the first time since 1970. Watson also became Creighton's first player since Benoit Benjamin (in 1985) with at least 32 points, seven rebounds and five assists in a game.\n\nWatson then had 18 points, 10 assists and five rebounds in a 65-62 win at Marquette. Watson tied the game with 2:32 left with a pair of free throws, and assisted on the go-ahead three-pointer with 1:05 left that helped CU move into sole possession of third place in the BIG EAST. The game was Watson's third double-double of the winter, and he became the first Bluejay since Duan Cole in 1989-90 with four games of 10+ assists in the same season.\n\nWatson was the first Creighton player named National Player of the Week by CBSSports.com since Doug McDermott was three times (Jan. 6, Jan. 13, Feb. 17) during a 2013-14 season that saw him sweep National Player of the Year honors. McDermott was also named NBCSports.com National Player of the Week on both Jan. 13 and Feb. 17 of that same season.\n\nLate Game Treys\n\nToby Hegner made three three-pointers in the second half of the Feb. 13 win at Marquette, none bigger than one that tied the game with 3:26 left.\n\nHegner improved to 10-for-15 from three-point range in the final five minutes of games this season, good for 66.7 percent. Hegner also leads the team with 21 rebounds, nine more than any other teammate, in the last five minutes of games this season.\n\nOn a related topic, James Milliken's go-ahead three-pointer with 1:05 left also was a key to victory. It was Creighton's first go-ahead three-point basket in the final 65 seconds of a game since Doug McDermott at Butler on Feb. 13, 2014, exactly two years earlier to the day. McDermott also drained a go-ahead trey to beat St. John's on Jan. 28, 2014, with 2.8 seconds left.\n\nKen Pom & RPI and Bracket Racket\n\nWith three weeks until Selection Sunday, it's that time of year when the computer rankings for contending teams start to get analyzed as more and more projected brackets are created.\n\nIn the rankings by KenPom.com, Creighton is ranked 50th overall. That website ranks Creighton with the nation's No. 48 adjusted defense, and No. 80 adjusted offense.\n\nIn ESPN's \"BPI\" rankings, Creighton is 51st.\n\nIn the NCAA's official RPI, Creighton is 88th.\n\nOn BracketMatrix.com, which compiles the picks of 94 bracketologists nationally, Creighton is currently in the field for just three of the projections.\n\nStat Sheet Stuffer\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. did a little bit of everything in carrying Creighton to a 70-56 win over No. 5 Xavier on Feb. 9, finishing with 32 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the victory.\n\nWatson is Creighton's second player with at least 32 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the same game since the 1980-81 season, joining Benoit Benajamin's monstrous game of 45 points, 16 rebounds and five assists vs. Indiana State on January 19, 1985.\n\nPer Basketball-Reference.com, Watson is just the third BIG EAST player in the last six seasons with a 32/7/5 game, joining UConn's Kemba Walker (33/12/5) vs. Syracuse on March 11, 2011, and Villanova's Maalik Wayns (39/13/6) at Cincinnati on Jan. 14, 2012.\n\nOne Of The Best Wins\n\nCreighton's Feb. 9th win over No. 5 Xavier was the program's eighth all-time victory over a team ranked in the top-10 of the Associated Press poll, and third in the last three seasons.\n\nEach of Creighton's last three wins against top-10 foes have come by 14 points or more.\n\nIt was Greg McDermott's third win over a top-10 foe as Creighton coach, matching the three such wins by Eddie Sutton from 1969-74.\n\nThe Feb. 13th win over Marquette improved Creighton to 7-1 in games following a victory against a top-10 foe.\n\nTop-10 Wins, School History\n\nDate Opponent (Score) Next Game\n\n12/13/1963 #4 Arizona State (84-83) Won\n\n12/01/1965 #10 Kansas State (83-75) Won\n\n01/29/1970 #5 New Mexico State (72-68) Lost\n\n02/17/1973 #7 Houston (78-77) Won\n\n02/09/1974 at #6 Marquette (75-69) Won\n\n01/20/2014 at #4 Villanova (96-68) Won\n\n02/16/2014 #6 Villanova (101-80) Won\n\n02/09/2016 #5 Xavier (70-56) Won\n\nDefense Limits Xavier\n\nCreighton held No. 5 Xavier to a season-low 56 points on Feb. 9th, well under the 80.8 points per game the Musketeers had been averaging.\n\nKeying that defensive effort was limiting Xavier from behind the three-point line, where the Musketeers where 1-for-21.\n\nThat game marked the first Bluejay opponent to make just one three-pointer since Indiana State on March 9, 2013 (1-for-13), and it was the first team to shoot less than 7 percent from three-point range against the Jays since Illinois State was 0-for-8 on Dec. 12, 1999.\n\nCreighton has held BIG EAST foes to 30.6 percent marksmanship (90-142) from three-point range in its eight league wins, compared to 37.9 percent (58-153) in its seven league setbacks.\n\nStuff On Huff\n\nCole Huff made his first seven shots and finished with a season-high 28 points vs. DePaul in Creighton's Feb. 6 win.\n\nHuff's 28 points were three shy of his career-high, set in 2014 in a double-overtime game vs. Fresno State while Huff played at the University of Nevada.\n\nEighteen of Huff's points came in the final 5:14 of the first half, a span during which Creighton scored 20 points as a team. Huff made seven straight shots.\n\nHuff's 28 points came in just 22 minutes, as he drained 9-of-11 shots overall. Huff's the first Bluejay with at least 28 points in 22 minutes or less since Larry House had 28 points in 22 minutes in his final home game, a March 3, 2003 win over Wichita State.\n\nHuff's 28 points were the most by a Bluejay reserve since Cavel Witter scored 42 points in a double-overtime win over Bradley on March 1, 2008.\n\nNew And Improved\n\nLast season's rare down year saw Creighton finish 14-19 overall, and just 4-14 in the BIG EAST. This year's team is 17-11 overall and 8-6 in league play.\n\nThe Bluejays have already greatly exceeded both win totals from a year ago.\n\nCreighton's four-win improvement in league play this season ties Seton Hall for the best in the BIG EAST this year. The only team to increase its BIG EAST win total by five or more since the league reconfigured in 2014 has been Butler (+8 in 2014-15).\n\nMore Points = Better Results\n\nHistory has shown that the more Creighton scores, the better the team does.\n\nCreighton is 3-2 against St. John's since the two became BIG EAST rivals, averaging 70.2 points per game in those meetings.\n\nPPG Opponent CU W-L\n\n79.4 DePaul 7-1\n\n77.0 Xavier 4-2\n\n74.7 Villanova 2-4\n\n71.8 Seton Hall 3-3\n\n70.2 St. John's 3-2\n\n70.0 Butler 3-3\n\n67.8 Marquette 4-2\n\n63.9 Georgetown 2-5\n\n63.3 Providence 1-5\n\nBench Impressive\n\nCreighton's bench contributed 51 points in its Feb. 6th victory over DePaul, with 28 of those points coming from Cole Huff.\n\nCreighton's 51 points by its reserves were the most since it scored 54 in a double-overtime win over South Dakota on Dec. 9, 2014 and its most in regulation since putting up 54 vs. Alcorn State on Nov. 8, 2013. Creighton last had 50+ points off the bench in a league game on March 1, 2008, when the reserves supplied 77 points in a double-overtime win over Bradley.\n\nThe Bluejay bench has scored 777 points so far this season, an average of 27.75 points per contest. That's the program's best figure since the 2007-08 team averaged 36.91 points per game.\n\nCreighton's bench has contributed 31 double-figure performances this season.\n\nCreighton's bench has outscored the bench of its opponents 777-542 this season, and 4,587-3,504 in Greg McDermott's six years on the Bluejay sideline.\n\nGoing For 20, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 15 of the last 17 seasons (through the end of 2014-15), a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust three schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 17 years: Duke, Gonzaga and Kansas.\n\nKentucky , Florida, Texas and Syracuse have each done it in 16 of the last 17 seasons.\n\nAlong with Arizona, Xavier, Kent State and Connecticut, Creighton is one of five schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 15 of the past 17 years.\n\nTriple Threat For Zierden\n\nJunior guard Isaiah Zierden is tied for first in the BIG EAST Conference with 67 three-pointers made, sharing the lead with D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera (Georgetown).\n\nIn Creighton's first year in the BIG EAST in 2013-14, Ethan Wragge led the league with 110 trifectas, while Doug McDermott was second with 96.\n\nZierden has made at least one three-pointer in 15 of his last 16 games, with the Feb. 13 game at Marquette the only exception.\n\nZierden With Efficient Eight vs. DePaul\n\nIsaiah Zierden's eight three-pointers at DePaul (Jan. 17) are tied for third-most in Creighton history for a single-game, and one shy of the record set by Kyle Korver (1/15/03 vs. Evansville) and Ethan Wragge (1/20/14 at #4 Villanova).\n\nZierden is one of four men with exactly eight trifectas in a contest, joining Korver (12/31/02 at #19 Xavier), Tad Ackerman (1/23/95 at Drake) and Terrell Taylor (3/15/02 vs. #15 Florida).\n\nOf the players to make eight or more three-pointers in a Creighton game, Zierden's 11 attempts are easily the fewest, two less than Ackerman and Korver (at Xavier). Both Korver (vs. Evansville) and Wragge needed 14 attempts, while Taylor set the school-record with 15 attempts against Florida.\n\nZierden's eight three-pointers vs. DePaul remain the most by any BIG EAST player in a game this season.\n\n30 Point Efforts\n\nIn Greg McDermott's first five years at Creighton, only Kenny Lawson Jr. (once) and Doug McDermott (27 times) ever scored 30 or more points in a game.\n\nIn the last six weeks alone, guards Maurice Watson Jr. (32 vs. No. 5 Xavier on Feb. 9) and Isaiah Zierden (31 points at DePaul on Jan. 17) have each surpassed 30 points in a game.\n\nThis is the first time since 2010-11 that Creighton has had multiple players reach 30 points in the same season (Lawson/D. McDermott).\n\nWatson's 32 points are the most by any Bluejay since Doug McDermott also scored 32 in a win over Xavier on March 14, 2014.\n\nCreighton has won 29 straight games in which an individual has scored 31 points or more. In addition to one such game from Zierden and Watson, that streak includes 31 point (or more) games from Doug McDermott (21 times), Nate Funk (3), Kyle Korver (1), Johnny Mathies (1) and Cavel Witter (1). The last time a Bluejay scored 31 or more in a loss came on Dec. 31, 2002, when Korver compiled 32 points in a two-point loss at No. 19 Xavier.\n\nDynamite Start For Watson\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. has 424 points in his first 28 games as a Creighton Bluejay.\n\nSince 1995-96, Watson's figure is the most among all Creighton newcomers through 28 games, 21 more than Doug McDermott's 403 points at this point.\n\nMcDermott would finish his career with 3,150 in 145 career games to rank fifth in NCAA history, while Buford finished with 2,016 career points as a Bluejay.\n\nMost Points In CU Newcomer's First Season Since 1995-96\n\nPts.

In addition to Milliken, Isaiah Zierden (2x), Cole Huff (2x), Maurice Watson Jr. (5x), Khyri Thomas and Geoffrey Groselle (4x) have all reached that mark.\n\nBy comparison, last year Creighton had five players all year reach 20+ points (Austin Chatman, Toby Hegner, Will Artino, Milliken and Zierden), and in the two previous years had only three players surpass 20 points in any game.\n\nThe last previous time that Creighton had six men have 20 or more points in a game during the same season was 1972-73, when Gene Harmon, Al Lewis, Ted Wuebben, Doug Brookins, Ralph Bobik and Gene Ellefson all did it.\n\nWinning Formulas\n\nBelow are the records for each current BIG EAST school over the last four, 10 and 16 (since 2000-01) seasons, ranked by overall wins, through games of Feb. 25.\n\nMost Wins - Last 4 Years (2012-13 - Present)\n\nTeam W L\n\nVillanova 106 26\n\nCreighton 86 46\n\nXavier 86 44\n\nProvidence 83 48\n\nButler 82 46\n\nGeorgetown 79 47\n\nMarquette 74 53\n\nSeton Hall 68 57\n\nSt. John's 66 62\n\nDePaul 44 80\n\nMost Wins - Last 10 Years (2006-07 - Present)\n\nTeam W L\n\nButler 250 93\n\nXavier 241 98\n\nVillanova 239 97\n\nCreighton 227 114\n\nGeorgetown 221 106\n\nMarquette 219 118\n\nProvidence 177 144\n\nSeton Hall 168 147\n\nSt. John's 160 161\n\nDePaul 111 203\n\nMost Wins Since 2000-01\n\nTeam W L\n\nXavier 378 152\n\nButler 376 155\n\nCreighton 366 166\n\nVillanova 361 169\n\nMarquette 345 180\n\nGeorgetown 339 178\n\nProvidence 277 225\n\nSeton Hall 264 231\n\nSt. John's 242 255\n\nDePaul 202 289\n\nPink Out Auction Raises More Than $21,000\n\nCreighton raised more than $21,000 during its \"Creighton vs. Cancer Pink Out\" game vs. Seton Hall on Jan. 30th.\n\nBluejay players wore pink shooting shirts and pink jerseys for the game and, like last year's event, fans had the opportunity to honor a friend or family member who has battled cancer or is currently battling cancer by purchasing the apparel via auction (the shooting shirt could be personalized – last name, nickname, etc.).\n\nThe first 16,000 fans entering the venue received a complimentary pink t-shirt courtesy of CHI Health and Methodist Estabrook Cancer Center.\n\nComplimentary \"Pink Out\" posters were also available to fans exiting the venue after the game.\n\nThis year's Creighton vs. Cancer jersey auction raised $16,527.90 and donations brought in an additional $5,000.

While it was three shy of his collegiate high accomplished while he was at Boston University, the 14 helpers were his most in a Creighton uniform.\n\nWatson's 14 assists tie Providence's Kris Dunn (twice) for the most by any BIG EAST player this season, and were the most in a regular-season BIG EAST game since Dee Davis had 15 assists vs. Providence on Feb. 7, 2015.\n\nWatson's 14 assists are tied for sixth-most nationally in a game this season, and directly led to 37 points by the Bluejays in that game.\n\nWatson's 14 assists were the most ever by a Creighton player in any conference game.\n\nWatson's 14 assists were the most by any Bluejay since Ralph Bobik tied his own school-record with 17 assist vs. Bradley on Jan. 22, 1974. Below is a list of the six occasions in CU history in which a player has had 13 or more assists.\n\nAst.

This year Groselle owns 10.5 points and 5.9 rebounds per game and has 294 points and 166 rebounds in 29 games (28 starts).\n\nWatson Dishes and Scores\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. continues to extend his team lead in both scoring and assists. In fact, in Creighton's last 19 games Watson has owned the outright team lead in assists 18 times and tied for the team lead on the other occasion.\n\nWatson is on pace to become Creighton's sixth player since 1970-71 to lead the club in both points per game and assists per game, as seen below:\n\nCreighton Leaders in PPG & APG, Since 1970-71\n\nName, Year PPG APG\n\nKevin McKenna, 1979-80 16.5 3.7\n\nMatt Petty, 1992-93 17.2 3.1\n\nKyle Korver, 2001-02 15.1 3.3\n\nNate Funk, 2003-04 11.1 2.7\n\nNate Funk, 2006-07 17.7 3.0\n\nAustin Chatman, 2014-15 11.5 3.7\n\nMaurice Watson Jr., 2015-16 15.1 6.5\n\nMo' Points, Mo' Assists\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. leads Creighton in both scoring and assists, and he's doing things at a rate that has never been approached in school history.\n\nSince the program began tracking assists in 1970-71, Watson is one of four men to average at least 12 points and five assists per game. However, he's the only one in that quartet that's scored 12 points per game while also averaging six assists per contest.\n\n12+ PPG & 5+ APG, Since 1970-71 at Creighton\n\nName, Year PPG APG\n\nRalph Bobik, 1971-72 14.1 5.2\n\nJames Farr, 1988-89 12.0 5.0\n\nAntoine Young, 2010-11 13.1 5.0\n\nMaurice Watson Jr., 2015-16 15.1 6.5\n\nStandard Five\n\nCreighton used the same starting line-up in each of its first 18 games this season before finally making a change on Jan. 17 (in game 19) when Toby Hegner replaced Cole Huff in the first five.\n\nCreighton tried a third combination on Feb. 3 at Villanova, as Zach Hanson replaced a gimpy Geoffrey Groselle.\n\nCreighton utilized a fourth combo on Feb. 9 vs. No. 5 Xavier when James Milliken started for Khyri Thomas.\n\nLast season Creighton used 10 different starting line-up combinations, its most in any season since using 11 pairings in 1994-95.\n\nCreighton used the same starting five combination for every game in 2011-12, and then again in 2012-13.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 15 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point, including DePaul (down 12) on January 17th. Eight of those comebacks came away from home.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2014, Creighton trailed 42-24 to No. 18 Oklahoma with 18:30 to go before putting together a comeback for the ages. It was CU's largest comeback victory under Greg McDermott (see chart below), the second-largest since 2000 (see chart below), and the second-biggest in the history of CenturyLink Center Omaha (see chart, left column on page five).\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 121-8 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 109 of the last 113 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under Greg McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Dramatics\n\nProvidence's Kris Dunn hit a game-winning shot as time expired to beat Creighton on Jan. 12th. It was the first game-winning shot with no time left to ever to beat Creighton at CenturyLink Center Omaha, exceeding the previous low with 1.9 seconds left by Butler's Roosevelt Jones last year.\n\nDunn's shot was the first to beat Creighton (at any site) with no time left on the clock since Anthony James drained a game-winning three-pointer for Northern Iowa in a 65-62 win on Feb. 4, 2012 in Cedar Falls, Iowa.\n\nAfter allowing just two game-winning go-ahead scores in the last 10 seconds in the first 11 seasons at CenturyLink Center Omaha, Creighton has allowed that to happen four times in the past 13 months alone.\n\nCreighton is now 7-6 in games with a game-winning go-ahead score in the final 10 seconds in the 13-year old facility.\n\nCreighton's Go-Ahead Scores in Wins at CLCO, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n11/26/05 Dayton W 91-90* Funk FG :5.7\n\n01/28/06 Wichita St. W 57-55 Tolliver FG :0.0\n\n11/25/06 George Mason W 58-56 Watts FT :7.5\n\n03/18/08 Rhode Island W 74-73 Witter 3FG :3.2\n\n01/13/10 Southern Illinois W 71-69 Young FG :1.3\n\n02/18/12 Long Beach St. W 81-79 Young FG :0.3\n\n01/28/14 St. John's W 63-60 McDermott 3FG :2.8\n\n*double-overtime\n\nOpponent Go-Ahead Scores in CU Losses at CLCO, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n03/20/06 Miami (Fla.) 53-52 G.

Watson had six such games at Boston University in his first two years as a collegian.\n\nWatson is the first Bluejay with four games of 10 or more assists in the same season since Duan Cole, who had four such games in 1989-90.\n\nMagic Number is 79\n\nCreighton has scored 79 points or more in 14 of its 17 wins thus far. Creighton averages 87.2 points per game in its 17 wins this winter, compared to 67.1 per game when it loses.\n\nSt. John's allows 75.2 points per game (last in the BIG EAST) and is 1-12 when allowing 79 points or more this season.\n\nSt. John's has allowed 62.4 points in its eight wins this year, compared to 80.1 points allowed in its 21 losses.\n\nWatson Reaches Milestones\n\nThough he's still relatively new to Creighton, that hasn't kept Maurice Watson Jr. from reaching a couple big milestones at the collegiate level.\n\nWatson owns 424 points and 183 assists at Creighton this season, and when combined with his 800 points and 410 assists in two seasons at Boston University, now owns career collegiate totals of 1,224 points and 593 assists.\n\nOnly two players have ever attained 1,000 points and 500 assists (all with CU) during their Creighton careers, Ryan Sears (1,309/570) and Antoine Young (1,342/505). Both Sears and Young got there as seniors.\n\nWatson is currently averaging 6.54 assists per game. Creighton's last player to average 6.0 assists per game or more for an entire season is Randy Eccker's 7.3 assists per contest in 1976-77.\n\nOverall, Watson's 1.97 assist/turnover ratio this year ranks eighth in the BIG EAST (min. 3.0 assists per game), and his career ratio (including Boston) of 2.08 assists per turnover ranks 15th-best nationally among active players with 400 or more career assists.\n\nThat ratio ranks better that such highly-touted men such as Ryan Arcidiacono (2.05), Yogi Ferrell (2.00), Denzel Valentine (1.94) and Kris Dunn (1.94).\n\nWatson surpassed 1,000 career points on Jan. 5 vs. Georgetown in the 81st game of Watson's collegiate career.

On Dec. 31 at St. John's, Groselle made his first eight shots before finishing 9-of-10. Groselle was also perfect from the field vs. Villanova on Jan. 2nd, though he only attempted one shot.\n\nThe streak of 21 straight field goals made was just nine shy of the NCAA record set this season by Yale's Brandon Sherrod.\n\nThe recent play has moved Groselle's field goal percentage to 68.3 percent, the fourth-best mark nationally (min 5 FGA/game) and best in the BIG EAST (min. 3 FG/game).\n\nIf you're curious, the NCAA record (min. 5 FG/game) was set in 1981 by Oregon State's Steve Johnson, who shot 74.6 percent, while the Creighton record (min. 200 attempts) is 67.4 percent set by Vernon Moore in 1984-85.\n\nGroselle's older brother, Mike Groselle, played at The Citadel from 2009-13 and ranks eighth in Southern Conference history with a 58.9 career field goal percentage and led the league in that category as a senior when he shot 57.4 percent from the floor.\n\nFG Percentage Leaders (through 2/25)\n\nMinimum 5 FGA/game\n\nRk.

It's the fourth different season in program history it's done that, and first time since 1989-90's squad did it three times.\n\nThe 1965-66 team cracked the century mark seven times, while the 1971-72 club reached triple-digits five times.\n\nThe Link Turns Into The Dunk Tank\n\nCreighton has put down 47 dunks in 28 regular-season games as a unit this year. By comparison, Creighton had 29 dunks in 33 games all last season.\n\nSeven different men have thrown down a dunk this winter, led by 13 from Geoffrey Groselle, 11 from Zach Hanson and 10 by Khyri Thomas.\n\nThe Fast And The Furious\n\nCreighton has 280 fast break points already this winter. By comparison, last year Creighton had a total of 143 fast break points (4.3 per game), and never had more than 11 in any contest.\n\nCreighton had a whopping 30 fast break points in its Nov. 14 win over Texas Southern, then added 24 more on Nov. 17 vs. UTSA.\n\nCreighton's 30 fast break points are believed to be its most since moving to CenturyLink Center Omaha in 2003, with the next highest mark on file (before Texas Southern on Nov. 14) was listed as 24 vs. Kennesaw State on Nov. 26, 2010.\n\nPace Makers\n\nCreighton ranks 44th nationally in scoring offense, averaging 79.07 points per game to date.\n\nThis year's team has scored 79 points or more in 14 of its 17 victories, significantly better than last year's team that reached 85 points just twice all winter.\n\nSince 2000-01, Creighton owns 54 games of 85+ points in the eight seasons it has made the NCAA Tournament, compared to 19 such outbursts in the seven years it has missed the Big Dance.\n\nYear 85+ Point Games Postseason?\n\n2015-16 10 TBD\n\n2014-15 2 None\n\n2013-14 12 NCAA\n\n2012-13 7 NCAA\n\n2011-12 13 NCAA\n\n2010-11 3 CBI\n\n2009-10 2 CIT\n\n2008-09 3 NIT\n\n2007-08 6 NIT\n\n2006-07 0 NCAA\n\n2005-06 2 NIT\n\n2004-05 1 NCAA\n\n2003-04 1 NIT\n\n2002-03 11 NCAA\n\n2001-02 6 NCAA\n\n2000-01 4 NCAA\n\nMan Of Steal\n\nIsaiah Zierden ranks fifth in the BIG EAST with 42 steals this season. He owns nine games this season with three steals or more, and had at least three in each of CU's first four BIG EAST victories this winter.\n\nBy comparison, Zierden had a total of three steals (in 28 games and 304 minutes) as a freshman, and 12 steals (in 20 games and 558 minutes) a year ago. Zierden owned just two steals in 23 career BIG EAST games entering the season.\n\nRelease, Rotation, Splash, Repeat\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 741 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993. The streak is the nation's 23rd-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nCreighton's streak of games with at least 15 trey attempts stands at 104, which is second-longest nationally.\n\nCourtesy Stats Inc., below is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (thru 2/26)\n\nRk.

Thomas sank 9-of-10 shots from the field, and was 4-for-4 from three-point range.\n\nThomas' 22 points were the most by a Bluejay freshman in a game since Doug McDermott had 31 vs. Davidson on March 21, 2011, and the most points by a Creighton freshman in a true road game since Rodney Buford also scored 22 points at Wichita State on Feb. 3, 1996.\n\nThomas' 90 percent marksmanship from the field was the second-best single-game showing by a Bluejay (minimum 8 FG) since 1994, trailing only an 11-for-11 outing from Anthony Tolliver vs. Illinois State on Jan. 1, 2007.\n\nThomas' 4-for-4 showing from three-point range was the most makes without a miss from downtown since Devin Brooks also went 4-for-4 from deep on Nov. 28, 2013 vs. Arizona State.\n\nCreighton hasn't had a player go 5-for-5 (or better) from three-point range since Michael Lindeman was 5-for-5 vs. Bradley on Feb. 8, 2003.\n\nTriple Threat\n\nKhyri Thomas entered the Dec. 9 game vs. Nebraska with five total assists in Creighton's first eight games, but the freshman guard would match that total in the first 14 minutes, and tallied seven helpers overall.\n\nThomas finished with seven points, seven assists and nine rebounds against the Cornhuskers. He is just the third Bluejay in Greg McDermott's six-year tenure to post at least seven points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the same game, joining Austin Chatman and Grant Gibbs. Both Chatman and Gibbs did it twice each. Maurice Watson Jr. has also done it once since then (Jan. 26 at Georgetown).\n\nCreighton has never had a traditional point/rebound/assist triple-double.\n\n7+ Point, 7+ Rebound, 7+ Assist Games, Since 2010-11\n\nPts.

McDermott would go on to be named First-Team All-MVC and, MVC Newcomer of the Year and MVC Freshman of the Year.\n\nAmong The Best\n\nSince the start of the 2010-11 season, which coincides with Greg McDermott's arrival, Creighton has been the nation's fifth-most accurate team from three-point range.\n\nThe Bluejays are 1718-4446 from deep in that time, shooting 38.6 percent.\n\nBest 3FG%, Since 2010-11\n\nRk.

The Detroit native responded in a big way, finishing with 10 assists in 20 minutes of work. The 10 assists led to 28 points from his Bluejay teammates.\n\nIn the process, Albert became the nation's third reserve with 10 or more assists in 20 minutes or less in a win against a Division I team since 2010-11. He joins Kansas's Naadir Tharpe (12 assists in 20 minutes vs. American on Dec. 29, 2012) and Louisiana Tech's Kenneth Smith (10 assists in 20 minutes on Nov. 20, 2013 vs. Central Arkansas).\n\nPer STATS Inc., Albert became the second BIG EAST reserve since 2004-05 with 10+ assists in 20 minutes or less against a Division I team, joining Marquette's Maurice Acker (12/28/08 vs. Presbyterian).\n\nAlbert is Creighton's only player in the last 30 years to have a game of 10 or more assists as a reserve.\n\nBig Margin Can Lead To Big Things\n\nCreighton's 104-77 win last year vs. Central Arkansas was the second straight season the team has cracked triple-digits in a season-opener.\n\nThe 2015-16 season saw Creighton reach 90 points in each of its first two games this season, just the fourth time that's happened. Each of the previous three times (1973-74, 2011-12, 2013-14), the Bluejays would reach the NCAA Tournament and then win at last one game in the Big Dance.\n\nNine of Creighton's 19 all-time NCAA Tournament teams have scored 90 or more points in their season-opener.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's last eight teams to score 90 or more in a season-opener, which shows that six of the previous seven to do so reached the NCAA Tournament.\n\nFinal Post-\n\nScore Opponent Date W-L Season\n\n93-70 Texas Southern 11/14/15 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n104-77 Central Arkansas 11/14/14 14-19 --\n\n107-61 Alcorn State 11/08/13 27-8 NCAA\n\n97-65 N.

Both McDermott (145 games) and Sears (124) started every contest of their four-year Creighton careers.\n\nHuff Earns MVP Honor\n\nNevada transfer Cole Huff returned to the Silver State and picked up MVP honors of the 2015 Men Who Speak Up Main Event after averaging 19.0 points and 5.0 rebounds in the two wins.\n\nHuff made 13-of-25 field goal attempts, including 7-of-15 three-pointers. He scored 26 points in the victory over Rutgers before a 12-point effort over UMass in the title game.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked to finish ninth in its third season as BIG EAST Conference members according to a preseason poll of league coaches. Villanova was picked first with 81 points and nine first-place votes, while Georgetown (70, 1), Butler (67), Xavier (55) and Providence (45) round out the top half. The predicted lower half was Marquette (44), Seton Hall (27), DePaul (25), Creighton (23) and St. John's (13).\n\nCreighton did not have any honorees on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Teams, which was led by Preseason Player of the Year Kris Dunn from Providence.\n\nZierden Returns From Second Knee Injury\n\nIsaiah Zierden had 15 points on Nov. 14 after missing the second half of last season after suffering a season-ending injury to his right knee for the second straight campaign.\n\nZierden was carried off the floor with 4:05 left in the first half on Jan. 21, 2015 at Butler and did not return.\n\nAn MRI two days later determined that Zierden partially tore the MCL in his knee, while also suffering an injury to his patella.\n\nUnlike his first injury, Zierden elected to have surgery this time around, as he underwent a medical procedure in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13, 2015.\n\nThe uncommon injury is very similar to one he suffered the previous March at Xavier, which caused him to miss CU's last seven games.\n\nNBA Representation\n\nThis year marks the second time since 1970 (joining last season) that Creighton has three NBA players at the same time, as Kyle Korver (Atlanta Hawks), Anthony Tolliver (Detroit Pistons) and Doug McDermott (Chicago Bulls) are all in the league.\n\nIncluding 2015-16, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 32 of the last 33 years.\n\nKorver ranks eighth in NBA history with 1,838 three-pointers and is also eighth in league history with 42.9 percent marksmanship from three-point range (through Feb. 25). He set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range in 2009-10. Last season he was named an All-Star and led the league in three-point percentage for the third time.\n\nTolliver is averaging 5.4 points per game this season for the Pistons, his 10th NBA organization.\n\nMcDermott is in his second season with the Chicago Bulls, where he's averaging 8.8 points per game and ranks seventh in the NBA, shooting 43.1 percent from three-point range for fellow Ames High alum Fred Hoiberg. Hoiberg, ironically, is the same man who replaced Greg McDermott as Iowa State's head coach in 2010.\n\nFull House\n\nLast year's Creighton team averaged 17,048 fans in 17 home dates, good for sixth-nationally, and better than 11 NBA franchises.\n\nIt's the 10th straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and the fourth straight season in the top-six nationally in attendance, as well.\n\nLast year Creighton was the nation's first team to average 17,000+ fans, despite a losing record, since Louisville in 2000-01.\n\nThis year's team is averaging 17,048 fans per game, which ranks eighth nationally through Feb. 26.\n\n2015-16 Attendance Leaders\n\nRk.

While respectable, that pales in comparison to CU's 69-10 (.873) mark the last five years when shooting better than 40.00 percent from downtown.\n\nLower the standards to 30%, and it's still impressive. Creighton is 100-26 in the last five years when shooting 30 percent or better from deep, compared to 15-25 when shooting 29.99 percent or less.\n\nNCAA Success\n\nCreighton is one of 18 schools to have won an NCAA Tournament game in at least three of the last four seasons.\n\nGonzaga, Kansas, Louisville, Michigan State and North Carolina are the only five teams to have won at least one game all four seasons.\n\nThe list of teams with an NCAA win in three of the last four campaigns consists of Arizona, Creighton, Florida, Iowa State, Kentucky, North Carolina State, Ohio State, Oregon, Saint Louis, San Diego State, Syracuse, Wichita State and Wisconsin.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 219 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in the 13-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 181-38 (.826) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (10-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 16,651-14,100 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 11.65 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 60 different times, including eight times this year (UTSA, Western Illinois, Nebraska, IUPUI, North Texas, Coppin State, DePaul and No. 5 Xavier).\n\nCreighton is also 25-22 all-time in the 47 games at CLCO in which it's fallen behind by double-figures.\n\nCreighton is 83-19 (.812) at CenturyLink Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including a 47-4 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 200-38 (.840) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nWhat A Start!\n\nGreg McDermott is 138-68 on the Creighton sideline midway through his sixth year at the helm. The 138 wins are easily the most in Creighton history in the first six seasons, way more than Tom Apke's 109.\n\nMost Wins at CU, First Six Seasons\n\nCoach Years W-L After 6 Yrs\n\nGreg McDermott 2010-Pres. 138-68 so far\n\nTom Apke 1974-80 109-55\n\nTony Barone 1985-91 102-82\n\nDana Altman 1994-00 99-78\n\nRed McManus 1959-65 91-63\n\nPizza Pie, Piled High = Wins\n\nThanks to a promotion with Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza, Creighton season ticket-holders can get a free mini pizza any time the Jays score 75 points at home.\n\nHistory has proven that when the team earns the fans pizza, it often leads to a victory as well.\n\nThe first three years of CenturyLink Center Omaha (2003-06), Creighton needed 70 points to earn its fans free pizza, and the Jays went 27-3 when reaching that threshold, closing out that run with 12 straight wins.\n\nSince upping the standard to 75 points prior to the 2006-07 campaign, Creighton is 95-1 when scoring 75 points or more at CenturyLink Center Omaha. In other words, Creighton is 107-1 in CenturyLink Center Omaha since Feb. 6, 2005 when scoring enough points to earn its fans some free pizza. The perfect streak of 101-0 was snapped on Dec. 2, 2015 when Arizona State scored three points in the final 15 seconds to sneak away with a 79-77 victory.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over in 2010, Creighton is averaging 78.43 points per home game (8,096 points in 104 home games).\n\nSince a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000, Creighton is 117-0 at home (88-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more, and 98-0 at home (71-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to that same setback.\n\nLast Season Recap\n\nCreighton went 14-19 last season, finishing 4-14 to tie for ninth place in the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nThe Bluejays started the season 5-0, including a win over No. 18 Oklahoma, before losing eight remaining games in the final minute.\n\nSenior point guard Austin Chatman led Creighton in scoring (11.5 ppg.) and assists (3.7 apg.), while fellow senior Devin Brooks paced the team in rebounds (5.0 ppg.) and steals (1.0 spg.).\n\nDespite the struggles on the court, Creighton still ranked sixth nationally with 17,048 fans per home game.\n\nShuttle Service Provided Again\n\nChief Bus will provide complimentary shuttle service from the Creighton University campus to CenturyLink Center Omaha for all men's basketball home games this season. The service is available to all fans, not just Creighton students.\n\nThe shuttle will start 75 minutes before tip-off and shuttles will continue to operate the route during the game. The three designated stops for pick-up around the CU campus are: 24th & California (nearside/southbound); 20th & Cass (nearside/eastbound) and at Billy Blues Alumni Grill (outside the Mike & Josie Harper Center in the turnaround which is on the east side of the building).\n\nThe shuttle will then go eastbound on Capitol Avenue and then go north up 10th Street for drop-off at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance. The route is designed for each shuttle driver to make a roundtrip every 15 minutes.\n\nFollowing the game's conclusion, the shuttle will start at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance on 10th Street and loop the original route with the first of three stops at 24th & California Streets.\n\nTicket Information\n\nSingle-game tickets for the 2015-16 season went on sale on October 29th.\n\nFans can purchase single-game tickets at CenturyLink Center Omaha Box Office, Ryan Athletic Center, all Ticketmaster locations (Baker's, Younkers), Ticketmaster online at http://www.ticketmaster.com or by calling Ticketmaster and charging by phone at (800) 745-3000. Only upper bowl seats will be available for any game.\n\nFor more information, call the Creighton Ticket Office at (402) 280-JAYS.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#12 Malik Albert\n\nG\n\n6' 2\"\n\nJunior\n\n#41 Geoffrey Groselle\n\nC\n\n7' 0\"\n\nSenior\n\n#40 Zach Hanson\n\nF\n\n6' 9\"\n\nJunior\n\n#32 Toby Hegner\n\nF\n\n6' 10\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#13 Cole Huff\n\nF\n\n6' 8\"\n\nJunior\n\n#23 James Milliken\n\nG\n\n6' 3\"\n\nSenior\n\n#2 Khyri Thomas\n\nG\n\n6' 3\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#10 Maurice Watson Jr.\n\nG\n\n5' 10\"\n\nJunior\n\n#21 Isaiah Zierden\n\nG\n\n6' 3\"\n\nJunior\n\n#31 Will Artino\n\nC\n\n6' 11\"\n\nSenior\n\n#5 Devin Brooks\n\nG\n\n6' 2\"\n\nSenior\n\n#1 Austin Chatman\n\nG\n\n6' 0\"\n\nSenior"
