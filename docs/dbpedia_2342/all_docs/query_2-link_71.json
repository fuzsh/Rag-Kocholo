        "text": "Starting Five: Sleeper teams from power conferences\n\nAfter a full week of college basketball, we've learned a number of truths. Among them: That the highly hyped freshman class is as splendid as advertised. We've also seen top 25 teams go down, and we'll likely welcome a new No. 1 in next week's polls.\n\nWith the 2013-14 season underway, It's a perfect time to take a look at some dark horses. While there are plenty of underrated mid-majors currently flying under the radar (Providence, Harvard and BYU to name a few), there also a number of sleeper teams hiding in power conferences.\n\nHere's a look at some of the best under-the-radar teams from power conferences that have the potential to surprise at some point this season and eventually solidify an NCAA tournament bid (even if it's as a bubble team for a play-in game).\n\nCalifornia (Pac-12): The Golden Bears lost Allen Crabbe to the NBA but return four starters and bring in a stellar recruiting class led by local product Jabari Bird, who had 14 points in the season-opening win against Coppin State. Senior combo guard Justin Cobbs is now the primary catalyst, while Tyrone Wallace stepped up with a 20-point performance in the opener and 16 points in Cal's rout of Denver. Mike Montgromery-coached Cal teams rarely underachieve and have yet to finish fourth in conference standings, so it's safe to pencil this team in as a top-tier Pac-12 team in a conference with seven potential NCAA bids.\n\nLSU (Southeastern Conference): Though they opened the season with a loss, expect the Tigers to bounce back and finish their non-conference slate strong. Second-year coach Johnny Jones hauled in the 10th-ranked recruiting class and will be tasked with blending a talented group of freshmen with a veteran-laden squad made up of NBA prospect Johnny O'Bryant III (13.6 ppg, 8.7 rpg) and the potent backcourt of Anthony Hickey and Andre Stringer. After a 19-12 finish last season, Jones has the Tigers poised to return to the NCAAs and challenge the top teams against a difficult SEC slate.\n\nSMU (American Athletic Conference): The Mustangs haven't reached the NCAA tournament since 1993, but the future looks promising under hall of fame coach Larry Brown, who returned to the college ranks last season. After a mediocre (15-17) first season, Brown's biggest accomplishment thus far was landing McDonald's All-American and top recruit Keith Frazier, who will join all five of SMU's starters from last season, including top catalyst Nick Russell. And unlike last season, Brown will have depth to work with thanks to an influx of eligible transfers. Yanick Moreira (South Plains CC), Nic Moore (Illinois State), Crandall Head (Illinois) and Markus Kennedy (Villanova) will all vie for playing time with last year's key returners as SMU tries to emerge from the American Athletic Conference as an NCAA tourney-caliber team.\n\nIowa (Big Ten): The Hawkeyes barely missed the field of 68 last season but return virtually every player on a 25-win team that reached the NIT final. If there was ever a formula for a breakout campaign, Iowa has it with nine of the team's top-10 contributors coming back, including consistent producers Roy Devyn Marble (14.9 ppg) and Aaron White (12.8 ppg). Like always, victories will come at a premium in the ultra-competitive Big Ten.\n\nSt. John's (Big East): A season-opening loss to Wisconsin might be deceiving for this St. John's team, which brings back 91.6% of its scoring and 88.3% of its rebounding from last year's NIT squad that narrowly missed the NCAA tournament including top big man JaKarr Sampson and guard Phil Greene IV. Coach Steve Lavin suspended leading scorer D'Angelo Harrison (17.8 ppg) for the last six games of the season and into the summer for conduct \"detrimental to the team,\" but Harrioson earned his way back before practice started. Harrison had 27 points and Sampson went for 21 points and seven rebounds in the opener, but outside shooting from the supporting cast is needed. Forward Orlando Sanchez, an All-America junior college player, transfer Max Hooper and redshirt big man God'sgift Achiuwa will add depth along with a talented recruiting class led by Rysheed Jordan, the No. 3 point guard, according to Rivals.com.\n\nOff the bench: Providence, Colorado, Iowa State."
