BeaverBlitz takes an in-depth look at the upcoming matchup in this game preview.\n\nOregon State and Washington State will play each other for the second time in four days, this time at 8:00 pm on Thursday at Beasley Coliseum in Pullman. BeaverBlitz takes an in-depth look at the upcoming matchup in this game preview.\n\nOregon State Beavers (3-25, 1-17) at Washington State Cougars (16-13, 9-9)\n\nThursday, March 3rd - 8:00 pm PT\n\nBeasley Coliseum (Pullman, Washington)\n\nTV: FS1 (JB Long and Steve Lavin)\n\nRadio: Beaver Sports Network (Mike Parker)\n\nStreaming Audio:Oregon State All Access andThe Varsity Network\n\nLive Stats:StatBroadcast\n\nTwitter:@BeaverMBB\n\nOn Monday’s bounce back from the blowout against #12 UCLA\n\n“That’s what we commented on in the locker room - big improvements. Big improvements, and the fact that we bounced back shows a sign of life. That’s what we’ve been asking for. It’s really disheartening because our guys fought hard and I thought really deserved this one but for a few plays offensively and defensively.”\n\n“From where we were Saturday, to be completely honest, we asked our guys, we begged our guys to respond and come together. I thought they really did that for the most part.”\n\nOregon State\n\nOregon State has scored 90-plus points in two of its last three games but lost both in overtime.\n\nThe Beavers are 2-3 this season when scoring 80-plus points; they were 28-1 the previous four seasons when scoring 80-plus points.\n\nRoman Silva scored a career-high 21 points and went 7-for-7 from the free throw line in the last game against Washington State.\n\nJarod Lucas moved into eighth on Oregon State’s career 3-pointers list with 169; next up is Gary Payton (178).\n\nDashawn Davis leads the Pac-12 in assists at 5.48 per game; the last Oregon State player to lead the conference in assists was Gary Payton in 1989-90.\n\nGlenn Taylor Jr. has gone 17-for-19 from the free throw line over the last four games.\n\nMaurice Calloo has gone 9-for-14 from beyond the arc over the last three games.\n\nThe Beavers have had eight scholarship players available the last three games; Rodrigue Andela (foot), Isaiah Johnson (concussion), Xzavier Malone-Key (back), and Tre’ Williams (knees) have all been out with injuries.\n\nWashington State\n\nDespite recent struggles, the Cougs defense continues to be among the elite ranking 37th in defensive rating at 95.5 per 100. WSU has allowed opponents to shoot an effective FG% of just 47.7%.\n\nWSU currently sits in 6th place in the Pac-12 looking at a date with Utah in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament next week. The last time the Cougs finished 6th or better was in 2011-12 which was also the last .500 or better season in conference play for WSU.\n\nEntering the week the Cougs continue their perch atop of the Pac-12 as the top three-point shooting team, leading the way with 9.0 3ptFG per game (39th in the country) on 26.7 3ptFGA per game (34th in the country).

He hit 6 3PT at OSU Monday while notching 27 points against the Beavers.\n\nMouhamed Gueye was named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week for the 4th time.
