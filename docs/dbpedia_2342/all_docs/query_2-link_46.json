        "text": "Regardless of what happens today, UCLA will finish the regular season in an unprecedented 10th place in the Pac-12 Conference. UCLA's previous worst place in the conference standings was seventh in Ben Howland's first season.\n\nIf the Bruins should lose, they will finish with their worst conference record since Steve Lavin's final season. Those are some pretty dismal facts.\n\nCertainly, they would seem to merit the dismissal of third-year coach Steve Alford. But, of course, Alford's fate won't be known until after the Pac-12 Tournament which is next weekend.\n\nIf you're heading to the game, let's see if we can start a Fire Alford chant with about five minutes left in the game.\n\nOf course, being the final home game, it's Senior Day. So, Tony Parker, the only senior on this year's team, will be honored in pre-game ceremony. So, let's all be sure to give Tony a hand for sticking it out for all four years when he could have easily joined Zach LaVine and Kyle Anderson and left school early.\n\nHow To Watch, Listen, and Stream:\n\nGame Date/Time:\n\nSaturday, March 5, 2016, 3:30 pm PT\n\nLocation:\n\nPauley Pavilion, Los Angeles, CA\n\nGame Notes:\n\nOregon State\n\nUCLA\n\nTV:\n\nPac-12 Networks (National, Los Angeles, and Oregon) with J.B. Long and Matt Muehlebach\n\nOnline:\n\nPac-12.com and the Pac-12 Now app\n\nRadio/Audio:\n\n570 AM in Los Angeles with Bill Roth and Darrick Martin\n\nSirius Ch. 137 and XM Ch. 197 (UCLA Call)\n\nAnd, of course, right here in the Bruins Nation Game Thread!!!\n\nThis is your Oregon State at UCLA State Game Thread.\n\nGo Bruins!!!"
