        "text": "Feb. 23, 2009\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, PA., Feb. 23, 2009 - Coming off another stunning upset of a Top 20 ranked team on the road in its last game, Penn State (19-8; 8-6 Big Ten) will travel to Columbus, Ohio Tuesday to take on Ohio State (17-8; 7-7 Big Ten) in a \"Super Tuesday\" showdown at 7:00 p.m. on ESPN. Brent Musburger, Steve Lavin and Erin Andrews will call the game.\n\nPenn State, 5-4 on the road this year, downed No. 16 Illinois in Champaign last Wednesday for its third Big Ten road win of the season. After a six-day lay-off, Penn State will look for a program record fourth Big Ten road win in Columbus, where it has not won since 2001. The Buckeyes have won the last 10 meetings in the series. Penn State comes in standing fourth in the Big Ten while the Buckeyes slipped to seventh after falling at home to Illinois (70-68) on Sunday.\n\nPenn State will look to add another scalp to an NCAA Tournament resume that includes three victories over Top 20 ranked teams (two on the road) and its most victories (19) since the 2000-01 season. Penn State is the only Big Ten team to have won two games on the road at teams currently in the top four of the conference standings. The Lions eight Big Ten wins thus far are their most since 1997-98.\n\nSenior forward Jamelle Cornley, a Columbus native, will play in front of his hometown crowd for the last time. He is 0-6 lifetime vs. the Buckeyes, but has posted four double-digit games and is averaging 13.0 ppg and 6.3 rpg vs. Ohio State. Cornley is expecting more than 300 family and friends in attendance for the game. Fellow senior Danny Morrissey, a Cleveland native, will also be playing his last game in Ohio and will also have numerous family and friends in attendance.\n\nAfter posting four straight Big Ten wins to get to seven conference wins, the Buckeyes have lost three-straight, including a 70-68 decision to Illinois in Columbus on Sunday. Guard Jon Diebler has led Ohio State in scoring the last two games and posted 17 points on four threes Sunday. Sophomore standout EvanTurner also had 17 on Sunday, and leads the team averaging 17.2 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 3.5 apg and 1.8 spg. Freshman center B.J. Mullens (7-0) has come off the bench recently and had eight Sunday.\n\nThe Buckeyes start three sophomores and a freshman and play five underclassmen in their top eight with no seniors. Ohio State leads the Big Ten in field goal percentage (48.2%) and is second in blocked shots (5.36). They rank among the bottom of the league in rebounding (31.4) and three-point percentage defense (35.4%).\n\nPenn State will return to the Bryce Jordan Center on Saturday for a \"Senior Day\" game vs. Indiana at 6:00 p.m. Fans are asked to wear white to the game. Penn State seniors Jamelle Cornley, Danny Morrissey, Stanley Pringle and Will Leiner will be honored. The Lions are 13-3 at home on the year and will look for a record 14th home win in the Jordan Center this season.\n\nNittany Lion basketball tickets can be purchased by calling the Penn State ticket office during regular business hours at 814-865-5555, visiting GoPSUsports.com anytime, or calling Tickmaster toll free at 800-745-3000."
