        "text": "By Christina Teller\n\nDaily Bruin Senior Staff\n\nThere’s no cause for alarm.\n\nThe earthquake-like motion that you might have felt last night\n\nwas not due to a natural disaster. It was just the Pac-10\n\nexperiencing another conference-wide shake-up.\n\nIn the matter of hours, Stanford defeated Arizona, UCLA beat\n\nOregon State and USC fell to Oregon, creating a four-way tie for\n\nthird place among UCLA, USC, Stanford and Arizona.\n\n“It’s like I said before, you need Alan Greenspan to\n\nfigure out this conference,” UCLA head coach Steve Lavin\n\nsaid. “It’s always topsy-turvy.”\n\nOregon beat USC at the buzzer, 67-65, and comes to Pauley\n\nPavilion on Saturday, which also happens to be Senior Day for the\n\nBruins.\n\nThe Bruins enter the game coming off a win that was dubbed by\n\nseveral team members as “ugly” and\n\n“sluggish,” but it wasn’t like the nail-biter\n\nthat went down at the Sports Arena.\n\nThis could be an advantage for the Bruins. When Cal beat USC in\n\novertime, the Bears had to face the Bruins just a day and a half\n\nlater, after expending a great deal of energy unseating the\n\nTrojans.\n\nBut this Oregon team isn’t going to give anything away,\n\nwhether or not they’re coming off a taxing win.\n\n“They’re the first-place team, and they know how to\n\nbounce back,” senior forward Matt Barnes said. “We lost\n\npretty bad up there, so we have some payback to do against\n\nOregon.”\n\nIn UCLA’s previous meeting with the Ducks, senior center\n\nDan Gadzuric was not much of a factor, going for eight points and\n\nseven rebounds. But he wasn’t alone. The team shot 42 percent\n\noverall and just 7 percent from downtown.\n\nBut Gadzuric has been the Bruins’ horse of late, racking\n\nup four double-doubles in seven games, forcing opposing defenses to\n\nhone in on him.\n\n“I don’t know exactly when it happened, but I feel\n\nas if I have been improving my game,” Gadzuric said.\n\n“I’ve started letting the game come to me.”\n\nTo upset the Ducks, UCLA has to have consistent games from a\n\nnumber of players, namely Jason Kapono, Cedric Bozeman and\n\nGadzuric, and a hot night from either Billy Knight or Matt\n\nBarnes.\n\nEven if UCLA does beat Oregon on Saturday, the Bruins’\n\nfinal position in the conference depends on the results of the\n\nCal-Arizona, Stanford-ASU and USC-Oregon State games. With a win\n\nover the Ducks, UCLA would hold an advantage over USC and Arizona,\n\nboth of which were swept by Oregon this season.\n\nBut the Bruins are confident.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Dijon Thompson said.\n\n“Have faith in Bruin pride. It will bring everything\n\nalong.”"
