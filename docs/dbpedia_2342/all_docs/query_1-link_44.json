        "text": "Wednesday, March 30, 2011\n\n1. A few late notes from Notre Dame’s women’s basketball regional title game victory in Dayton Monday night . . . . The 25-game Tennessee win streak that the Irish ended marked the second longest in Lady Vol hoop history. The Irish women may have taken some karma from the VCU men’s team that started its NCAA journey two weeks ago in Dayton in the First Four. The Irish dressed in the same Dayton Arena locker room as the VCU team and also ate dinner at the same Olive Garden restaurant.\n\n2. The Irish softball team’s home-opening defeat of Northern Illinois last week extended Notre Dame’s active home winning streak to 21 games, the fifth-best streak in the nation before it ended Tuesday in a loss to Western Michigan . . . the Irish had won their last home game of the 2009 season and went 19-0 in 2010 at Melissa Cook Stadium.\n\n3. US Lacrosse has selected team physicians and athletic trainers foreach of the four teams in the U.S. National Teams Program – and one of those is Notre Dame associate athletics trainer and physical therapist Mandy Merritt, who will serve as trainer for the U.S. Men’s Under-19 team. Individuals were selected following a national recruitment and review process led by the US Lacrosse Sports Science & Safety Committee. Each team will be covered by a primary care physician, a sports orthopedic surgeon and an athletic training staff. Merritt has extensive experience with men’s lacrosse, spending time as both a student and employed athletic trainer with the University of Delaware men’s lacrosse program, working with Towson’s University men’s lacrosse program, and also serving as the co-director (2002-2009) of athletic training services for one of the largest lacrosse team-camps in the country, Battle of the Hotbeds. She earned her doctorate degree in physical therapy at the University of Delaware and later passed the exam to become a sports certified specialist. Merritt is currently the athletic trainer for the men’s lacrosse program at Notre Dame and also oversees women’s swimming and diving. She is an active member of the BIG EAST Conference, involved in policymaking for standards of care for men’s lacrosse.\n\n4. Less than 24 hours after leading Notre Dame to the third NCAA Women’s Final Four appearance inschool history, sophomore guard Skylar Diggins (South Bend, Ind./Washington) collected another major honor, earning recognition as a third-team All-America selection by the Associated Press, it was announced Tuesday. Diggins, who copped honorable mention All-America status from the AP and Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) as a freshman in 2009-10, is the fourth Fighting Irish women’s basketball player to be named to one of the AP’s three five-player squads, which are selected annually by the 39-member national media panel that votes weekly in the AP Top 25 poll. This year’s balloting was conducted before the start of the NCAA Championship. Jacqueline Batteast (2005 third team) was the last Notre Dame player to earn a place on one of the three AP All-America teams, following in the footsteps of Ruth Riley (1999 third team; 2000 and 2001 first team) and Niele Ivey (2001 third team). Riley is the only other Notre Dame sophomore to make an AP All-America squad.\n\n5. Jeremy Rae (Fort Erie, Ontario/Lakeshore Catholic) and Kevin Schipper (Leo, Ind./Bishop Dwenger) of the Notre Dame men’s track and field team swept the BIG EAST Men’s Outdoor Track & Field weekly awards, as announced by the league Tuesday afternoon. Rae was named the BIG EAST Men’s Outdoor Track Athlete of the Week, while Schipper received the BIG EAST Men’s Field Athlete of the Week. Rae earned the honor after clocking the best collegiate time in the nation to date in the 1,500-meter run in 3:44.09 at the Stanford Invitational during last weekend’s competition. The sophomore was the first collegiate competitor to cross the line, following only Nike athlete David Torrence. Rae’s time is a personal best and is .32 seconds ahead of UTEP’s Elkana Rotich for the best collegiate time in the country this season. Schipper was named the BIG EAST Men’s Field Athlete of the Week after claiming the pole vault crown at the Arizona State Invitational during his competition last Friday. The 2011 BIG EAST indoor pole vault champion cleared 5.20m, which is currently the best height in the league this season and fourth-best performance in the nation.\n\n6. University of Notre Dame men’s soccer head coach Bobby Clark has announced dates for the program’s 2011 summer camps. A variety of camps will take place during the month of July. Residential Centres: “Advanced Camp” – Middle School: July 5-July 9, 2011 Boys (6-8th Grade), “Advanced Camp” – High School: July 5-July 9, 2011 Boys (9-12th Grade), “Elite Camp” – College Prep: July 10-July 14, 2011 Boys (10-12th Grade); Developmental Day Camps : Boys (1st-8th grades) & Girls (1st-5th grades) , Day Camp I: July 18-21, 2011 (9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.) , Day Camp II: July 25-28, 2011 (9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.) All five of Notre Dame’s 2011 recruits attended the summer camp program at Notre Dame and 20 players on the 2010 roster were former campers. This year saw four Notre Dame players get drafted to Major League Soccer (MLS), three of which were former campers. Several former campers also have gone to play in other top programs across the country. The summer camps provide a great opportunity to be trained by the Notre Dame staff, meet Fighting Irish players and get a feel for the magnificent Notre Dame campus. The “Advanced” middle school and “Advanced” high school camps for boys entering 6th – 12th grades are designed to train advanced players in a challenging and fun environment. Players will receive quality and individualized instruction from high-level coaches.\n\n7. Notre Dame plated all three of its runs in the sixth inning on four straight hits and the Irish bullpen did the rest en route to a nip-and-tuck, 3-2, baseball victory over Central Michigan on Tuesday night at Frank Eck Stadium. Notre Dame improved to 10-12-1 overall, while the Chippewas dropped to 9-16. Sophomore RHP Adam Norton evened his record at 2-2 on the season with 7.0 strong innings of work. He limited Central Michigan to just a pair of earned runs, a two-run home run in the top of the seventh, on nine hits. Norton struck out a career-high seven and did not issue a walk. Bryce Morrow was charged with the loss for the Chippewas. The right-handed hurler dropped to 0-3 on the campaign. Morrow allowed three earned runs, all in the Irish sixth inning, on six hits. He struck out three and walked one. Freshman RHP Dan Slania definitely earned his third save of the season. The Irish took a 3-2 lead into the ninth inning. Sam Russell tripled down the right field line to open the frame and put thegame tying run just 90 feet from home with no outs. Slania then walked Jordan Dean to put the go-ahead runner on base, but shut the door the rest of the way. Slania struck out both Tom Howard and Nate Theunissen, who stroked a two-run home run earlier in the game. Dean moved into scoring position on Theunissen’s punch out when the ball bounced away from sophomore C Joe Hudson, but Slania eventually got Eric Wrozek to ground out to end the game. Fifth-year senior RF Herman Petzold collected three of Notre Dame’s seven hits in the game. Petzold went 3-for-4 with an RBI double and walk. Freshman 1B Trey Mancini went 2-for-4 with a run scored and RBI single. Freshman CF Eric Jagielo and senior LF Matt Grosso each went 1-for-3. Jagielo had a double and run scored, while Grosso had a run scored and RBI single. Norton baffled Central Michigan over the first 6.2 innings before running into a little trouble in the seventh. With two outs,Norton allowed a single and Theunissen followed with a towering two-run home run to cut the Irish lead to 3-2. Norton ultimately worked into the seventhinning for the second straight start.\n\n8. The nation’s fifth-longest home winning streak was snapped Tuesday at Melissa Cook Stadium when the Notre Dame softball team fell to visiting Western Michigan, 3-2. The Irish, who had won 21 straight home games dating back to 2009, are now 17-7 overall heading into Thursday’s meeting at 5:00 p.m. (ET) against in-state rival Purdue. The Broncos (5-18) were out-hit by Notre Dame, 9-4, but scored three runs in the first two innings to break a 10-game skid to the Irish while posting their first road win in the series since 1999. Tara Buchanan’s first-inning, two-run homer off of Jody Valdivia (5-4) proved to be the difference in the contest. Buchanan’s bomb produced two of three runs on Valdivia in the opening 1.2 innings, as the Irish starter allowed a trio of earned scores with a pair of strikeouts. Valdivia was replaced in the second after surrendering a two-out RBI-single to Lexi Jager, and Brittany O’Donnell fanned four batters over the next 2.1 frames. Laura Winter combined with O’Donnell to leave the Broncos scoreless with a four-strikeout effort in 3.0 innings. Winter added four of Notre Dame’s 10 punchouts, as 23 of her 27 offerings were strikes. Kayla Houston (3-8) wentwire-to-wire from the circle for Western Michigan and gave up two earned runs. Both Alexa Maldonado and Heather Johnson were 3-for-4. Johnson’s two-run dinger in the third was the only knock to produce tally marks for Notre Dame on the day. The Irish left three runners on base in the frame. Even more, 10 ducksremained floating on the pond during the contest, including multiples in the second (2), fifth (2) and sixth (2) innings. Western Michigan overcame a pair of fielding errors and caught Maldonado stealing for just the second time in 11 attempts.\n\n9. The Notre Dame softball team has added a non-conference contest to its 2011 spring schedule, as announced Tuesday by the Irish coaching staff. Notre Dame will face IPFW on April 19 at 4:00 p.m. (ET). Live video, audio and stats will be available for the home game at Melissa Cook Stadium.\n\n10. Irish men’s basketball guard Ben Hansbrough (Poplar Bluff, Mo.) was named to the Associated Press All-America second team. It marks the first AP All-America honor for the senior guard and the fourth consecutive year that a Notre Dame player has earned AP All-America accolades. Hansbrough, the BIG EAST Player of the Year, becomes the 10th different player to be named an Associated Press and honored to one of the three teams. The AP first team was comprised of Jimmer Fredette (BYU), Nolan Smith (Duke), Jarred Sullinger (Ohio State), Kemba Walker (Connecticut) andJaJuan Johnson (Purdue). Joining Hansbrough on the second team was Marcus Morris (Kansas), Derrick Williams (Arizona), Jordan Taylor (Wisconsin) and Kawhi Leonard (San Diego State) Marshon Brooks of Providence College was the third BIG EAST player named to one of the three AP All-America teams as he was a third-team honoree. Also named to third team were Jordan Hamilton (Texas), Kenneth Faried (Morehead State), Jacob Pullen (Kansas State) and Tu Holloway (Xavier). Hansbrough finished this season as Notre Dame’s leading scorer with an 18.4 scoring average. In addition to averaging 3.9 rebounds per game, he led the Irish in assists (145) and steals (41). Despite only playing two seasons in an Irish uniform after transferring in June of 2008 from Mississippi State,Hansbrough scored 1044 points at Notre Dame and started all 69 career gameswith the Irish. He closed out his career at Notre Dame with a 15.1 career scoring average.\n\nMonday, March 29, 2011 – Part II\n\n1. The wait was certainly worth it for Notre Dame. Skylar Diggins scored 24 points and second-seeded Fighting Irish made up for 28 years of beatings at the hands of Tennessee, upsetting the top-seeded Lady Vols 73-59 Monday night in Dayton to earn a spot in the NCAA women’s basketball Final Four. The Fighting Irish (30-7) came in 0-20 all-time against the Lady Vols. But the operative number on this night was 3-0 — Notre Dame’s record in regional championship games. The Irish are headed to the Final Four for the first time since 2001, when they won the national championship. Natalie Novosel added 17 points and Becca Bruszewski — who didn’t practice Sunday and was listed as questionable to even play with a knee injury — had 13 for the Fighting Irish. Brittany Mallory chipped in with 10. Notre Dame advanced to the play the winner of Tuesday’s game between top-ranked Connecticut (35-1) and second-seeded Duke (32-3). Taber Spani and Shekinna Stricklen had 13 points for the Lady Vols (34-3). Glory Johnson added 12.\n\n“I’m so excited, I’m out of breath,” said Diggins, selected as the regional’s most outstanding player. It was a watershed win after years of losing — sometimes close, usually not so close — to mighty Tennessee. The day before the game, Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw and her players were clearly upset to be reminded about their long drought against the Lady Vols. It was also another disappointing end for the Lady Vols, who are accustomed to muscling their way into the national title picture under coach Pat Summitt. Freshman Meighan Simmons, their leading scorer at 13.8 points a game, was saddled with foul trouble and was scoreless until the waning minutes, finishing with two points. Senior Angie Bjorklund, the program’s all-time 3-point shooter and this season’s fourth-leading scorer at 11 points a game, didn’t score in the semifinal win over Ohio State and had only had one point against Notre Dame. Trouble seemed to be brewing for the Lady Vols all week. The players had a team meeting after a narrow win in the second round. Then Summitt had to reach back for a fiery halftime speech to inspire the team to overcome Ohio State in the regional semifinals.\n\nTennessee, down five at the half, picked up two quick baskets by Stricklen only to have the Fighting Irish score on five oftheir next six possessions. Diggins was the culprit almost every time, hitting two 3s and a long jumper and also assisting on Bruszewski’s short shot and also on Novosel’s spinning reverse layup. That swelled the lead to 41-32 — and suddenly that sea of orange filling up much of the University of Dayton Arena began to get nervous. With Spani twice hitting 3s, the Lady Vols remained in contact, but Diggins came up with big plays time and time again. She drove the lane through heavy traffic and flipped in a lefty layup with 11:16 left to keep Notre Dame in charge, 49-41.\n\nThe lead never dropped below six points again. During one physical exchange, Tennessee’s Kelley Cain was fouled by Bruszewski, but Cain was called for a technical. That seemed to fire up the Fighting Irish.After Natalie Novosel hit both technical shots, and Cain hit only one of herfree throws, the Irish pulled away. First Diggins drilled a high arching 3 from the right wing. After a Tennessee miss, the Lady Vols pressed fullcourt andNotre Dame threw a long inbounds pass to Novosel, who drove the length of the court and then fed Devereaux Peters for a bucket. Mallory then picked up a steal and Peters slipped behind the Tennessee defense to score again, muscling in a shot off an alley-oop pass from Diggins — for a 60-48 lead.\n\nThe teams came in with almost identical numbers — averaging around 79 points a game and allowing around 55. They were evenly matched in most regards. Each team also had seven players averaging at least 7 points a game. But the all-time series was anything but even. Since their first meeting in 1983, Tennessee had dominated, including three wins in the NCAA tournament. The last time the two teams had met, in the 2008 NCAA tournament, Tennessee had won 74-64 in Oklahoma City in the regional semis. But not this time.\n\n2. Notre Dame collected 12 hits, its most since Feb. 19, and second-most on the year, but were unable to deliver with runners in scoring position as UIC upended the Irish, 5-3, at Frank Eck Stadium Monday night. Notre Dame dropped to 9-12-1 on the year, while the Flames improved to 10-10 with their seven consecutive victory. The Irish went just 3-for-13 with runners in scoring position and stranded eight on the base paths, including six in scoring position. In fact, Notre Dame advanced a runner into scoring position with less than two outs in each of the third, sixth, seventh and eighth inning without producing a run. Freshman LHP Anthony McIver was charged with the loss and dropped to 1-2 on the season. The rookie worked 5.0 innings and was charged with four runs, all earned, on five hits. He walked three and struck out three. UIC starting pitcher Charlie Weinberg picked up the win. He improved to 2-3 on the year. Weinberg did exactly fool the Irish, allowing seven hits in 5.0 innings, but allowed just two earned runs. He struck out two and walked one. Notre Dame had five players with at least two hits for the second straight game. Sophomore 2B Frank DeSico went 2-for-5 with an RBI single. Freshman CF Eric Jagielo went 2-for-3 with a walk, run scored and double. Freshman 1B Trey Mancini went 2-for-4 with a run scored and double, while fifth-year senior RF Herman Petzold went 2-for-3 with a walk and RBI and senior 3B Greg Sherry went 2-for-4.\n\n3. Sean Rogers, a junior attackman on the Notre Dame men’s lacrosse team, has been named the BIG EAST Offensive Player of the Week. Fighting Irish sophomore goalie John Kemp was selected to the league’s weekly honor roll. Rogers tallied four goals and three assists over the course of two Irish victories last week. He matched a career-high total with three goals in an 8-7 win over #20 Ohio State. Rogers’ first goal tied the game 1-1, while his second tally gave Notre Dame a 3-2 lead. His final goal proved to be the game winner. Rogers dished out a career-high three assists in addition to scoring a goal in Sunday’s 8-3 victory at Rutgers, which was the BIG EAST opener for the Irish. Kemp made 15 saves and allowed just 10 goals while playing every minute in the two Fighting Irish victories. He had five saves in the victory over Ohio State and followed that up with a 10-save performance against Rutgers. Kemp and the Notre Dame defense stifled a Rutgers offense that entered the game averaging over 10 goals per game. The Irish held the Scarlet Knights to one goal in the final 45:02 of the game and scoreless for the final 23:50. Kemp boasts a 5.83 goals-against averagethis season. Notre Dame’s 5.83 team goals-against average leads the nation.\n\nMonday, March 28, 2011\n\n1. Notre Dame sophomore goaltender Mike Johnson stopped 37 of 38 shots on the night and got all the offense he needed on goals by StephenJohns and Billy Maday as the Fighting Irish hockey team downed New Hampshire, 2-1, Sunday night in front of 5,906 fans at the Verizon Wireless Arena. The win gives Notre Dame the NCAA Northeast Regional championship and a trip to the Frozen Four in St. Paul, Minn., on April 7. Johnson, who was selected to the all-region team and was named the regional’s most valuable player, was the key for the Irish as he held the Wildcats off the scoreboard early in the game and them withstood their third-period comeback attempt. The Verona, Wis., native finished the weekend with 69 saves and a pair of wins. The lone New Hampshire goal came with 6:23 left in the game and was scored by Mike Sislo. The victory improves ninth-ranked Notre Dame to 25-13-5 overall — while 11th-ranked New Hampshire finishes the year with a 22-11-6 mark. The Irish will face Minnesota-Duluth in one semifinal game at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul at 5 p.m. EDT, on Thursday, April 7, on ESPN2. This will be Notre Dame’s second trip to the Frozen Four, as the Irish played in the 2008 edition, advancing to the finals where they lost to Boston College in the title game. Michigan will face North Dakota in the other semifinal game.\n\n“Obviously, we’re thrilled to death,” said Irish head coach Jeff Jackson. “For this group to accomplish what they have this year with as many young players is incredible. It’s an exciting opportunity for all of us and we are looking forward to it.” New Hampshire dominated the first seven minutes of the game, outshooting Notre Dame by an 8-1 margin. Following a television timeout at the 7:11 mark of the period, the Irish got their second shot of the period and it found the back of the Wildcat net. Johns got Notre Dame on the scoreboard first, scoring on the second Irish shot of the night at 7:26 as he hammered a shot from the center point past UNH netminder Matt DiGirolamo’s stick hand. The Wildcats outshot the Irish, 13-7, in the first period. The Irish gained an edge in the play in the second period but could not get the puck past DiGirolamountil there were just five seconds left in the period. With time running down, the Irish dumped the puck into the New Hampshire zone where Riley Sheahan took control. He worked his way down to the goal line before centering a pass in front. The puck found Maday at the bottom of the left circle where he got off a backhander that beat the Wildcat goaltender over his blocker and under the crossbar at 19:55 to give the Irish a 2-0 lead. The goal wasMaday’s second of the weekend and 10th of the season. For the second period in a row, Johnson kept New Hampshire off the scoreboard, stopping all 16 shots he faced. He robbed Sislo who was all alone in front with 5:45 left in the second, rejecting a shot off his blocker. He then turned in a pair of big glove saves off the stick of Kevin Goumas in the waning moments of the middle period. “Mike’s (Johnson) biggest challenge is that he wants to do well so bad that he ends up thinking it too much,” said Jackson. “I keep reminding him of all the goalie drills we do, that it’s more about just getting into the game and stopping the puck. You don’t think, you just play. Tonight, he just played.”\n\nNew Hampshire broke up Johnson’s shutout bid at 13:37 of the third period on a goal by Sislo from right in front to make it a 2-1 game. From there the Irish held off the Wildcats, including a penalty kill in the final four minutes. Johnson was quick to credit his teammates for his success in the win. “They did a great job, the forwards and defense in front of me,” explained Johnson. “They got sticks in passing lanes and did a good job of deflecting pucks and blockingshots. I have to credit them. They were unbelievable tonight with the back pressure that allowed the defense to stay on the blue line and not allow them (UNH) into our zone as easily. They played a great game in front of me and we couldn’t have won without their hard work.” On the night, Notre Dame was outshot by New Hampshire, 38-36. DiGirolamo finished with 34 saves in the Wildcat goal. The win improved the Irish to 6-4 all-time in NCAA Tournament games. Four Notre Dame players were selected to the all-Northeast Regional Team. Johnson was selected as the all-tourney goaltender with Johns on defense. Maday and Anders Lee were selected as forwards on the squad. New Hampshire defenseman Blake Kessel and forward Mike Sislo rounded out the team with Johnson being named MVP of the tournament.\n\nWith back-to-back one-goal wins in the Northeast Regional this weekend, the Irish are now 10-5 on the season in one-goal games. Notre Dame’s 25 wins this season are the fifth-highest total in the program’s 43-year history. Notre Dame has played one other time in the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. That came on Oct. 7, 2000, when the Irish faced Minnesota in the Hall of Fame Classic. The Gophers defeated Notre Dame, 7-3, in that game.\n\n2. The Notre Dame women’s rowing team earned three race victories against Indiana, Purdue and Eastern Michigan on Sunday at the Eagle Creek Reservoir in Indianapolis. The Irish varsity four “A” boat got the day started with a 13 second win over the Hoosiers. The crew of coxswain Christina Dines, Kiersten DeHaven, Joanna Poinsatte, Sarah McShane and Ching-Ting Hwang coasted to the victory after crossing at 7:56.0. Indiana crossed next at 8:09.6 and were followed by the Notre Dame “B” boat of coxswain Jacqueline Gilhooly, Teresa Rubinger, Elizabeth Linnemanstons, Courtney Gaberino and Anna VanEgmond at 8:14.8.

In second varsity eight action, the Hoosiers held on for the victory after finishing in 7:32.0. The Irish crew of coxswain Rachael Louie, Teresa Blumenstein, Paige Aiello, Kelsey Murphy,Katie Suyo, Kelsey Haddad, Erin McConnell, Megan Keegan and Morgan Kelley finished second in 7:37.9, while Purdue placed third at 8:08.8. The second varsity eight “B” (third varsity eight) race saw the Irish turn in another wide margin of victory as the boat of coxswain Danni Schneider, Sarah Thompson, Meghan Salomon, Nicole Michels, Kathryn Monahan, Brianna Krafcik,Stephanie Boggs, Valerie Brencher and Paige White finished 18 second ahead of second place in 7:24.0. Purdue crossed in second at 7:42.6 with Eastern Michigan finishing third in 7:55.8. The closest race of the day came in varsity eight action as Indiana’s boat claimed the victory by one second over the Irish, crossing at 6:28.0. Notre Dame’s boat of coxswain Abby Meyers, Katherine Linnemanstons, Genevieve Malone, Carol Ann Michel, Olivia Kacsits, Molly Bruggeman, Emily Crosby, Stephanie O’Neill and Stephanie Gretsch just missed that mark, finishing at 6:29.0. Purdue and Eastern Michigan rounded out thefour-boat field, crossing at 6:46.9 and 7:25.0, respectively. In novice eight competition, Indiana led the whole way, claiming the win at 7:22.0.

The Irish next return to the water in three weeks when they head to the Gold River Challenge on April 16-17 in Sacramento, Calif.\n\n3. The 25th-ranked Notre Dame men’s tennis team picked up two victories Sunday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. The Irish defeated 50th-ranked USF 6-1, followed by a 7-0 win over Dayton. Against South Florida, the second doubles tandem of Casey Watt (Gibsonia, Pa./Pine-Richland) and Stephen Havens (Cincinnati, Ohio/Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy) picked up the first win for the Irish on the day as the duo downedRomain Deridder and Yannick Yoshizawa, 8-3.At the top of the doubles lineup, Niall Fitzgerald (Wicklow, Ireland/Blackrock College) and Spencer Talmadge (Hillsborough, Calif./Junipero Serra) clinched the doubles point over Jamal Adderley and Lucas Jovita in an 8-3 decision. The third doubles pair of Tyler Davis (Nashville, Tenn./Father Ryan) and Greg Andrews (Richland, Mich./Gull Lake) made for a perfect doubles record in the match as the duo handled Wael Kilani and Federico Sabogal, 8-4. With the doubles point in hand, the Irish entered the singles portion of the match with confidence as sophomore Blas Moros (Boca Raton, Fla./Pine-Crest) downed Sebastian Hagn in consecutive 6-0 sets at No. 6 singles. Andrews defeated Federico Sabogal in straight sets, 6-0, 6-1 to improve Notre Dame’s score to 3-0. The 73rd-ranked Lucas Jovita handed the Irish their only loss of the match as No.58 Watt fell 6-2, 7-6 (8-6). Daniel Stahl (Bethesda, Md./Walt Whitman) clinched the match for the Irish as the senior defeated Yannick Yoshizawa in a two-set match, 7-5, 6-3. Stahl improved his winning streak to five consecutive matches to make his overall record this dual season 12-6. With the match in hand, Havens defeated Wael Kilani, 6-4, 7-5 to move his dual season record to 5-10. Fitzgerald closed out the match and downed Juan Carlos Acuna Gerard in a three-set match, 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 1-0 (10-1), to conclude the match with a 6-1 score.\n\nAgainst Dayton, Matt Johnson (Portage, Mich./Portage Central) and Ryan Bandy (Cincinnati, Ohio/St. Xavier) teamed up at No. 2 doubles and downed Alex Crum and Robert Salcedo in an 8-1 decision, while Stahl and David Anderson (Sandwich, Mass./Sandwich) defeated Benton Benalcazar and Andrew Hanley 8-0 to clinch the match. Seniors Sean Tan (Lakewood, Calif./Lakewood) and Bryan Kelly (North Oaks, Minn./Mounds Parks Academy) handled Sean Bandy and Sam Pecyna 8-1 to conclude the doubles portion of the match.

The Irish return to action Saturday as they take on Ball State in Muncie, Ind., before returning to the Eck to play host to Southern Methodist University Sunday.\n\n4. Twenty-four hours after one Notre Dame team (hockey) advanced to the national Final Four, a second Irish squad attempts that feat tonight. For the first time in a decade, and the third in program history, #7 Notre Dame plays for a trip to the Final Four, as the second-seeded Fighting Irish women’s basketball team meets #1 seed (and fourth-ranked) Tennessee in the NCAA Dayton Regional final at 7 p.m. (ET) live on ESPNHD from the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio. Notre Dame (29-7) advanced to the regional title game with a convincing 78-53 win over #20 (and sixth-seeded) Oklahoma on Saturday afternoon. The Fighting Irish ended the first half on a 21-4 run, successfully avenging last year’s overtime loss to OU in the Sweet 16. Senior guard Brittany Mallory scored a season-high 20 points, canning 6-of-10 three-pointers, and senior forward Devereaux Peters had a double-double (17 points/13 rebounds) to pace Notre Dame to the win. Notre Dame is 2-0 all-time in NCAA regional finals, earning wins over George Washington (1997) and Vanderbilt (2001). The Fighting Irish are 17-2 (.895) all-time in NCAA Championship play when holding their opponent to 60 points or fewer. The Fighting Irish are 6-7 against ranked opponents this season, with those seven losses (the only defeats for Notre Dame to date) coming by an average of just 7.6 points per game, and only one by more than 11 points. Four of those setbacks came to the nation’s top two squads (76-65 at #2 Baylor on Dec. 1;79-76 vs. #2 Connecticut on Jan. 8; 78-57 at #2 Connecticut on Feb. 19; 73-64 at #1 Connecticut on March 8), with the first UConn contest being one of four in which Notre Dame led or had a chance to tie in the final 30 seconds of regulation (also 86-83 double-OT loss to #15 UCLA, a 81-76 loss at #9 Kentucky and a 70-69 loss at #11 DePaul). The Fighting Irish rank among the top 15 in the country in eight statistical categories, according to March 23 NCAA statistics report. Notre Dame ranks third in the nation in steals (now 13.0), fourth in field goal percentage (.480), sixth in scoring margin (+22.1), ninth in assists (17.6) and rebound margin (+9.0), 11th in scoring offense (77.5) and 15th in turnover margin (+4.83) and three-point defense (.269). These rankings are ironic for a Fighting Irish team that has just one player ranking higher than 50th in any category.\n\n5. Tickets to the 2011 NCAA Frozen Four for hockey figure to be hot items because the event is always sold out. Given the small institutional allotments, Notre Dame will not have a public ticket sale. More information is available at http://www.ncaa.com/info/icehockey-men/d1/tickets\n\n6. Jeff Jackson knows NCAA hockey. The Irish head hockey coach has seen his teams make the NCAA Tournament in 10 of his 12 seasons as a Division I head coach (four with Notre Dame and six with Lake Superior State). During that time, his teams own a record of 19-8 (.703) in the NCAA Tournament. That includes a 13-5 record at Lake State and a 6-3 record at Notre Dame. Jackson also has seen his teams make it to the Frozen Four five times (1992, 1993, 1994 at LSSU and 2008 and 2011 at Notre Dame), winning twice at Lake Superior. His record in the Frozen Four is 6-2 overall.\n\n7. Notre Dame (women’s soccer and fencing) is one of only three schools that has won multiple NCAA championships so far in 2010-11, joining Penn State (women’s volleyball and wrestling) and California (men’s swimming and women’s swimming)\n\nSunday, March 27, 2011\n\n1. For the eighth time in program history and third under the direction of head coach Janusz Bednarski, the University of Notre Dame fencing team has claimed the NCAA National Championship. The Irish held offPenn State to earn the title Sunday at the French Field House in Columbus, Ohio. Freshman Rachel Beck (Tucson, Ariz.), who battled through a tough day Saturday, clinched the championships with a 3-2 overtime victory over Katherine Chou of Harvard in foil. Bednarski, along with his staff of assistant coaches Gia Kvaratskhelia (foil), Marek Stepien (epee) and Ian Farr (sabre), coached the squad to their first title since winning in 2005. The Irish also have claimed the nationalchampionship in 1977, 1978, 1986, 1987, 1994 and 2003. After entering the day with 139 points with 54 bouts remaining for the team, the Irish wasted little to no touches, claiming 35 of those available points to take their team total to 174 points. Penn State could climb no closer than six points, totaling 168 points. St. John’s remained in third, finishing with 155 points. Beck was the bounce-back story of the tournament for the Irish, rebounding from a 3-11 opening day to put together a record of 6-3 Sunday, including running off astring of five straight wins through rounds five and six. With the Irish needing either one more team win or a Penn State loss, Beck posted the winning touch in the overtime period against Chou to clinch the title. Overall, sheended in 17th place with a record of 9-14.\n\nJunior Courtney Hurley (San Antonio, Texas) was the second story of Sunday, earning her first NCAA gold medal after defeating Harvard’s Noam Mills in the finals, 8-7. Hurley had reached the semifinals each of her first two seasons with the Irish, losing both times, before finally securing gold this season with an overtime touch. She is the 27th gold medalist in Irish program history. Overall, Hurley finished with a 19-4 pool play record with a +42 indicator. Her 60 round-robin victories in NCAA competition moves her into eighth all-time on the Irish list, one behind both Myriah Brown (’99, foil) and Kerry Watson (’05, epee). Hurley’s gold also marks the first timesince 2008 that the Irish have won multiple weapon titles, when Sarah Borrmann (sabre) and Courtney’s sister, Kelley Hurley (epee), both topped the podium. It also represents the first time in program history that the Irish have won a gold medal in both a men’s and women’s weapon in the same year, as Ariel DeSmet (Troutdale, Ore.) won the men’s foil title on Friday. Senior Hayley Reese (Crestwood, Ky.) also improved on her 8-6 record on day one in foil, dropping only two bouts on Sunday to secure a 15-8 record overall and eighth place, good for second-team All-America status. Reese becomes the 20th member of the Irish program to become a four-year All-American, joining fellow seniors Barron Nydam (Rancho Sante Fe, Calif.) and Eileen Hassett (Beaverton, Ore.) on that prestigious list. Junior Ewa Nelip (Katowice, Poland) climbed up the epee standing in her second day, putting together a record of 6-3 over the final three rounds to end in ninth place with a 12-11 record. She earned third team All-American honors for the top-12 finish and is now a three-time All-American.\n\nIn sabre, Hassett earned a berth into the top four for the first time in her career, finishing pool play with a record of 17-6 after a 6-3 final day. She faced off against top seeded Eliza Stone of Princeton in the semifinals, losing 15-14 on the final touch of the bout. After earning second team All-America distinction each of her first three years, Hassett grabbedfirst team honors for the first time in her career and became the 21st fourtime All-American. Sophomore Lian Osier (Battle Ground, Wash.) put together a 4-5 second day to finish in ninth place with a record of 12-11. She becomes an All-American for the first time in her career, earning third team honors for the top-12 result.\n\nOver the course of the first two days of the tournament (Thurs.-Fri.), the men staked the women to a six-point lead after claiming 90 points, dispersed amongst 34 points in foil, 33 in sabre and 23 in epee. DeSmet (Troutdale, Ore.) finished pool play with a record of 18-5, earning him thethree seed in the semifinal bouts. He then went on to put on a remarkable run against Penn State, dismissing David Willette in the semifinals, 15-6, before holding off Miles Chamley-Watson in the finals, 15-13, to claim the individual gold medal. In the process he became the second straight Irish men’s foilist to win gold, as Gerek Meinhardt accomplished that feat at the 2010 Championships, and became the first freshman to do so since Charles Higgs-Coulthard won in 1984. DeSmet became the 26th Irish fencer to win gold at the championships, and fifth overall in foil, joining the likes of Higgs-Coulthard, Meinhardt, Pat Gerard (’77) and Andy Bonk (’79). Reggie Bentley (Little Rock, Ark.) teamed with DeSmet in foil, finishing his two days with a 16-7 record and a +29 indicator to earn a fifth-place finish. The showing earned him second team All-America accolades, while DeSmet earned first team All-American for placing in the top four. Senior Avery Zuck (Portland, Ore.) made his final appearance at the NCAA’s count, earning his best career finish in sabre with his runner-up result against the reigning champion Daryl Homer of St. John’s, 15-14. He qualified for the top four with a pool play record of 18-5, earning the three seed. He then knocked off Penn State’s Aleksander Ochocki of PennState in the semifinals, 15-13. Zuck earned first team All-America status as a result of his top-four finish. Both Zuck and DeSmet appearing in the weapon finals marked the first time in men’s competition that had happened since ’05 whenMichel Sobieraj won the epee title and Patrick Ghattas finished second in sabre.\n\nNydam appeared in his fourth and final NCAA Championships, piecing together a 15-8 record for a sixth-place finish and second-team All-America distinction. Nydam closed his tournament strong for the Irish, sweeping his final round of competition with wins over Ohio State’s MichaelDouville (5-2) and Rhys Douglas (5-3) as well as Wayne State’s Jakub Gibczynski (5-2). With his second team All-America distinction, Nydam became the 19th four-time All-American in program history, and was later joined by both Hassett and Reese on the women’s side. Sophomore James Kaull (Washington, D.C.) made his second consecutive appearance for the Irish in epee, finishing in 14th place with a record of 12-11. Brent Kelly (Grapevine, Texas), in his second NCAA appearance and first with the Irish after transferring from Columbia, concluded his tournament with a record of 11-12, good for 16th place.\n\nTeam Results\n\nNotre Dame 174 Penn State 168 St. John’s 155 Princeton 150 Ohio State 148 Harvard 137\n\nIndividual Results\n\nAriel DeSmet, men’s foil, gold medal (first place), first-team All-American\n\nCourtney Hurley, women’s epee, gold medal (first place), first-team All-American\n\nAvery Zuck, men’s sabre, silver medal (second place), first-team All-American\n\nEileen Hassett, women’s sabre, bronze medal (tie/third place), first-team All-American\n\nReggie Bentley, men’s foil, fifth place, second-team All-American\n\nBarron Nydam, sabre, sixth place, second-team All-American\n\nHayley Reese, women’s foil, eighth place, second-team All-American\n\nEwa Nelip, women’s epee, ninth place, third-team All-American\n\nLian Osier, women’s sabre, ninth place, third-team All-American\n\nJames Kaull, men’s epee, 14th place\n\nBrent Kelly, men’s epee, 16th place\n\nRachel Beck, women’s foil, 17th place\n\n2. All season long the Notre Dame hockey team showed a penchant for being able to come from behind and pull out dramatic wins. They did it again Saturday night at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, N.H., rallying from a pair of two-goal deficits to pull out a 4-3 overtime win versus the Merrimack Warriors. Freshman left wing Anders Lee led the way, recording two goals, including the overtime game winner at5:18 of the first overtime to give the Irish the win. Junior Billy Maday and senior Calle Ridderwall added single goals in the win that will send the Irish to the NCAA Northeast Regional Final tonight versus New Hampshire. The Wildcats, the fourth seed in the regional, defeated first-seed Miami, 3-1, in the opening game of the day. Notre Dame and New Hampshire will face off at 8:00 p.m. in a game that will be televised live by ESPNU and ESPN3.com.\n\nMerrimack got goals from Kyle Bigos, Ryan Flanigan and Rhett Bly, as the Warriors would lead 3-1 midway through the second period. Notre Dame outshot Merrimack, 37-35, in the game. Irish goaltender Mike Johnson made 32 saves while the Warriors’ Joe Cannata had 33. The victory improves the ninth-ranked Irish to 24-13-5 on the season while seventh-ranked Merrimack closes its season with a 25-10-4 mark.\n\n“Obviously we are thrilled to be advancing but it certainly was an up-and-down game, a boxing match,” said Irish head coach Jeff Jackson. “They took the lead on some mistakes that we made early on but our guys kept on working. I think in the third period we started creating a few more opportunities for ourselves. I was hoping that we could finish the game in regulation because I knew if we took the period break that it would give them the advantage coming back and it did. I credit Merrimack for playing a great game. We are just fortunate that our guys never said never and were able tocome back.”\n\nThe Warriors jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first period scoring once on the power play and once short-handed. Notre Dame would get one back on the power play at 16:27 when Ridderwall ripped a shot from between the hashmarks, beating Merrimack’s Cannata to his stick side. The goal was the 15th of theseason for the senior left wing. Merrimack built the lead to 3-1 at 2:58 of the middle stanza capitalizing on an Irish turnover in front of their own net. An errant pass ended up on the stick of Shawn Bates to the left of Johnson. He fed the puck across the crease to Bly who backhanded a shot over Johnson for his fourth goal of the year. Notre Dame cut the lead to 3-2 at 13:29 when Lee fired a wrist shot over Cannata’s glove hand and into the upper right corner. TheIrish poured it on in the third period out shooting the Warriors by a 17-4 margin and scored the only goal of the period as Maday got the equalizer at5:32. While the Irish ended regulation with the momentum, Merrimack came out flying in the extra stanza putting the pressure on the Notre Dame goal with six shots in the first five minutes. With five minutes gone in the period, Notre Dame still hadn’t gotten a shot on goal and Jackson called a timeout. “I think any coach would have called that timeout. The pressure was on us. If I could have called it earlier I would have,” said Jackson. “I just told our guys to calm down. We were turning pucks over. Merrimack has threelines and anyone of them can score. If it weren’t for Mike Johnson, we wouldn’t be sitting here right now. Sometimes you call the timeout to change the momentum and that was one of those times.”\n\nThe timeout worked because, 18 seconds later, the Irish were celebrating on the ice with the victory. Off the faceoff, the Irish threw the puck into the Merrimack zone where a Warrior defender picked it up on the left side of the goal and moved out to the right with Lee in pursuit. As the defenseman cut inside at the right post, Lee took a swing at the puck and deflected it past Cannata to give Notre Dame its only lead of the night and the win, 4-3. “I was just going in hard on the forecheck and the defenseman cut up pretty quickly,” said Lee. “I just made a last ditch effort and swung at it and it was in the back of the net.” The overtime win was the second of the postseason for the Irish as they knocked off Lake Superior March 11 in the first game of the second round of the CCHA playoffs on a goal by Jeff Costello. Notre Dame is now unbeaten in its last 21 overtime games (5-0-16) dating back to its most recent overtime loss on March 21, 2008, a 2-1 loss to Miami in the CCHA semifinals. This season, the Irish are 2-0-5 in overtime.\n\n3. Hands with green fingernail polish – Notre Dame’s NCAA tournament tradition – seemed to swipe at every dribble and reach for every pass. Brittany Mallory scored season-high 20 points, and Notre Dame’s defensive pressure forced 24 turnovers and quicklytook its toll in a 78-53 win over Oklahoma on Saturday that sent the Fighting Irish to the women’s basketball regional final. Those green-painted fingers were everywhere. “Maybe they don’t get enough credit for their defense because their offense is so salty,” Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale said. Notre Dame (29-7) will play top-seeded Tennessee Monday (7 p.m. ET onESPNHD/ESPN3.com). The Lady Vols (34-2) pulled away from Ohio State in the second half for an 85-75 win – their 25th straight – in the other semifinal. Nicole Griffin scored 18 points for Oklahoma (23-12), which reached the Final Foureach of the last two years. Notre Dame’s go-for-the-ball pressure crumpled the Sooners’ guard-driven offense, which had only eight field goals and 14 turnovers in the decisive first half. It was the third time in the last four years that the Sooners and Fighting Irish met in the NCAA tournament. The first two games dripped with drama and went to overtime. Notre Dame won the firsttime, 79-75 in the second round in 2008. Oklahoma got the rematch, 77-72 last year in a regional semifinal in Kansas City. No overtime needed this time. Notre Dame’s defense ended all the drama right away. “Last year’s game was in the front of my mind the whole 40 minutes,” said Notre Dame point guard Skylar Diggins, who had 12 assists. Notre Dame had a 47-24 edge in rebounding, limiting the Sooners to two offensive rebounds. “Unfortunately, we didn’t give them much of a fight,” Coale said. “We got absolutely demoralized on the boards.” Natalie Novosel added 15 points, and Devereaux Peters had 17 points and 13 rebounds for Notre Dame, which got the better of a turnover-filled, up-tempo game. Notre Dame opened with a 9-4 run that included three 3s by Mallory, who hadn’t made more than three in any game this season. The senior guard was 0 for 10 from behind the arc in her last three games. She finished with a career-high six 3s. Notre Dame closed the first half with a21-4 run set up by the incessant defensive pressure. Notre Dame had nine steals and forced 14 turnovers in the first half. Notre Dame advances to the thirdNCAA Elite Eight (regional final) in school history, and first since its run to the 2001 NCAA national championship.\n\n4. Senior SS Mick Doyle gave Notre Dame a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the fourth inning with an RBI single and senior RHP Cole Johnson pretty much did the rest as the Irish baseball team shut out Georgetown, 1-0, Saturday afternoon at Frank Eck Stadium. Notre Dame improved to 9-10-1 overall and 2-0 in the BIG EAST, while the Hoyas dropped to 15-9 and0-2. The Irish have taken each of the first two games in the series and will look for the sweep Sunday afternoon. Johnson improved to 2-4 on the year with his sixth quality start in as many outings in 2011. The right-handed hurlerlimited Georgetown to five hits, four of which were singles, in 8.0 shutoutinnings of work. Johnson struck out six and walked one. Freshman RHP Dan Slania collected his second save of the season with a scoreless and perfect ninth inning. The rookie struck out one of the three batters he faced. Charles Steinman was charged with the loss for Georgetown. The righty allowed one earned run on three hits in 4.0 innings of work. Steinman issued four walks and struck out two.\n\n5. Freshman Frank Dyer swam the 100 free Saturday during the final day of the NCAA Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships at the University of Minnesota Aquatic Center in Minneapolis, Minn., the freestyler’s third race in as many days at the national event. Dyer, who one day earlier recorded the program’s highest finish at the NCAAs with a 26th-place showing in the 200 free, tapped in at 44.05 during the preliminary race of the 100 free during the morning session. His effort was good for 40th overall. The BIG EAST Conference champion in the 500 free swam the same event at the NCAAs, along with the 100 and 200 free. Dyer is just the second Notre Dame swimmer – and first freshman – ever to compete in the NCAA Championships.\n\n6. The #3 Notre Dame men’s lacrosse team opened BIG EAST play on Sunday afternoon with an 8-3 win overRutgers at the RU Turf Field in Piscataway, N.J. The Fighting Irish are 6-0 this season. Senior attackman Colin Igoe notched three points on two goals and an assist, while senior midfielder David Earl also chipped in two goals for the Fighting Irish. Junior attackman Sean Rogers registered one goal and a career-high three assists. Notre Dame carried a 4-2 lead into the intermission after neither team scored in the second quarter. “Today was probably our best all-around effort of the season,” said Notre Dame head coach Kevin Corrigan. “We played well in all areas. We rode well and cleared well and even got a goal off of the ride. Our defense played well and our settled offense was good. It was nice to see that we got eight assists on our eight goals and we had four different attackmen score.” Rutgers held a 30-26 advantage in shots. Irish sophomore John Kemp made 10 saves in goal to up his record to 6-0 this season. His counterpart Joseph Donnelly made seven stops for the Scarlet Knights. The Scarlet Knights, who entered the game averaging 10.14 goals per game this season, scored just one goal in the final 45:02 of Sunday’s contest. The Notre Dame defense kept Rutgers off the scoreboard for the final 23:50 of the game. The Irish defense is surrendering just 5.83 goals per game this season. The Fighting Irish will return to action on Saturday when they play host to #7 Villanova in BIG EAST action. Opening faceoff against the Wildcats is slated for 1:00 p.m. (ET) at Arlotta Stadium.\n\n7. The Notre Dame men’s and women’s track 800-meter runners concluded the Stanford Invitational Saturday at the Cobb Track in Palo Alto, Calif., led by Jack Howard (Libertyville, Ill./Libertyville) who was the third-place finisher in 1:51.22 in the first section of the 800-meter run. Rebecca Tracy (Barrington, Ill./Barrington) finished in 2:09.32 for second place in the fourth section, followed by Abby Higgins (Naperville, Ill./Benet Academy) in seventh place in 2:11.49 and Natalie Johnson (Englewood, Colo./Xavier College Prep) ran 2:16.48 for 11thplace.

Howard was the third-place finisher in 1:51.22 in the first section. Kevin Labus (Indianapolis, Ind./Brebeuf Jesuit) finished in 1:51.60 for second place in the third section. Mitchell Lorenz (Brainerd, Minn./Brainerd) was the second-place finisher in1:52.62 in the fourth section, while Randall Babb (Wheaton, Ill./Warrenville South) finished 10th in 1:54.76. The Irish sprinters, jumpers and throwers concluded the Arizona State Invitational Saturday at the Sun Angel Stadium in Tempe, Ariz. Denes Veres (Ellwood City, Pa./Riverside) claimed the shot putcrown as the senior posted a 17.50m throw. Rudy Atang (Houston, Texas/St. Pius X) bested her previous outdoor shot put record of 15.02m with a mark of 15.69, which earned her a third-place finish.\n\n8. Lindsay McKinnon’s free-position goal with eight seconds remaining in regulation capped a four-goal Hofstra rally in the second half to lead the Pride to a 10-9 come-from-behind women’s lacrosse victory over #17 Notre Dame Sunday at James M. Shuart Stadium in Hempstead, N.Y. With the loss, Notre Dame falls to 3-5 on the season, while the Pride improve its record to 4-5. The Irish suffered their second heartbreaking loss in as many games and their third one-goal setback of the season. Just one week ago against Cornell (March 20), Notre Dame dropped a 6-5 double overtime decision and earlier in the season fell to Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., 13-12. McKinnon’s game-winning goal was her second score of the game and ninth of the season. In addition to netting two goals, she also added two assists. Stephanie Rice and Jill Maier tallied three goals each to lead the Pride. Shaylyn Blaney led the Irish with three goals and an assist, while teammate Maggie Tamasitis added two goals and three assists. Betsy Mastropieri finished with a goal and an assist in the contest. After a first half in which there four ties and four lead changes, Notre Dame held a one-goal advantage, 6-5, at the intermission. Notre Dame outshot Hofstra 27-17 in the contest, but could only convert on three of its 10 shots in the second half while the Pride made good on five of their eight shot attempts. The Irish also owned a 15-6 advantage in draw controls and won seven of nine in the second half. Hofstra made good on four of their seven free position attempts, while the Irish converted just one of their five attempts. Pride goalkeeper Jackie Pandolf made 11 saves in the contest, while Ellie Hilling had four saves for the Irish in net. The win was Hofstra’s first-ever over the Irish in the four meetings between the two schools. Notre Dame entered the game having won the two previous matchups in Hempstead, N.Y. Looking to end its two-game slide, Notre Dame returns to action when it opens up BIG EAST Conference next weekend at Arlotta Stadium with two games scheduled againstRutgers (Friday at 7 p.m.) and Loyola-Md. (Sunday at 1 p.m.).\n\n9. Notre Dame loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, but Pablo Vinent struck out freshman CF Eric Jagielo to end the game and give Georgetown a 4-3 victory and salvage the final game of the BIG EAST baseball series Sunday afternoon at Frank Eck Stadium. The Irish captured each of the first two games of the series by a single run, but the Hoyas returned the favor this afternoon. Notre Dame dropped to9-11-1 overall and 2-1 in the BIG EAST, while the Hoyas improved to 16-9 and 1-2. Vinent picked up the victory in relief for Georgetown and improved to 3-1 on the year. The right-handed hurler allowed six hits in 3.2 innings of work, but limited the Irish to just one run. Vinent struck out three and walked one. Notre Dame senior RHP Todd Miller was charged with the loss and dropped to 2-2 on the season. The starter was charged with four runs, all earned, on five hits in 6.1 innings. Miller fanned three and walked one. The Irish did not go quietly in their half of the ninth inning. Sophomore P/DH Adam Norton singled back up the middle with one out. Senior 3B Greg Sherry followed with a sinking line drive to centerfield. Norton went more than half way toward the second base bag, but had to hold up to see if the ball was caught. Georgetown’s centerfielder Justin Leeson did not come up with the catch, but the ball caromed off his glove and a mere couple feet in front of the charging outfielder. Leeson gathered the ball and fired a high throw to second base, but Hoyas second basemen Andy Lentz lounged off the bag to catch the throw and landed on the bag just in time to force Norton. Now two outs and Sherry on first, sophomore 2B Frank DeSico followed with an infield single to move the tying run into scoring position. Vinent than helped the Irish cause with a wild pitch to advance both runners in scoring position. With the tying run only 90 feet away and the winning run at second, senior SS Mick Doyle drew a walk to load the bases for Jagielo, who had doubled in each of his last plate appearances. Jagielo fouled off Vinent’s first offering before taking a pitch outside to even the count 1-1. Jagielofouled off another pitch from Vinent to fall behind in the count 1-2, but again took a ball to event the count at 2-2. Vinent then got Jagielo to swing and miss at a changeup down and inside to end the game.\n\nThursday, March 24, 2011\n\n1. A goal from Sean Rogers with 33 seconds left was the difference as the third-ranked Notre Dame men’s lacrosse team topped #20 Ohio State 8-7 Wednesday afternoon at Arlotta Stadium on the Notre Dame campus. Rogers, a junior attackman, scored a game-high three goals. Notre Dame (5-0) grabbed a 7-4 lead with 7:22 remaining on a Zach Brenneman goal. Ohio State responded with three straight tallies to knot the game 7-7 with just over a minute left to play. With under a minute showing on the clock, Buckeye goalkeeper Greg Dutton picked off a Brenneman pass, yet Dutton could not keep the ball in the netting of his stick and Rogers grabbed the ball in midair and deposited the decisive goal. “We were very fortunate to get that last goal,” said Notre Dame head coach Kevin Corrigan. “We were lucky, but luck is when opportunity meets preparation. Sean (Rogers) was there and he made the play.” Junior midfielder Eric Keppeler had converted a Steve Murphy pass into a goal to put Notre Dame on top 5-2 at halftime. Notre Dame owned the faceoff circle by winning 16 of 19 attempts. Freshman Liam O’Connor went 13-16, while senior Jake Marmul was 3-3. The Fighting Irish held a 34-20 advantage in shots. Sophomore goalie John Kemp made five saves for the Irish to improve his record to 5-0 this season. Dutton had 12 stops for Ohio State. Irving and junior defenseman Jake Brems both had a game-high four ground balls for Notre Dame. Rogers’ three goals matched a career-high total that he achieved twice last season. The junior has a team-high nine goals this season. The Irish return to action Sunday when they open BIG EAST Conference play at Rutgers. Opening faceoff is slated for noon (ET) in Piscataway, N.J.\n\n2. Yesterday’s note on who will televise Notre Dame’s NCAA regional semifinal hockey game live (at 7:30 p.m. EDT against Merrimack) suggested the game was Friday – but it’s actually on Saturday. The game will be shown on Comcast Chicago (channel 101), Comcast SouthBend (channel 3), Time Warner Upstate (in upstate New York), MASN and Comcast SportsNet New England.\n\n3. Mike Golic, former Notre Dame football standout and current co-host of ESPN Radio’s Mike and Mike in the Morning, will participate in a variety of roles for the 2011 Notre Dame Football Fantasy Camp.

They will provide daily hands-on instruction and interaction. They also will share priceless personal experiences from their time under the Golden Dome and in the NFL. Camp dates are Tuesday, May 31, through Saturday, June 4, 2011. Participants will stay at the Fairfield Inn& Suites located across the street from campus and adjacent to the new Eddy Street Commons, and mere steps from the shadow of Notre Dame Stadium.\n\n4. Joe Philbin, offensive coordinator of the Super Bowl XLV Champion Green Bay Packers, will join former Florida head coach Urban Meyer and current Oregon head coach Chip Kelly as a guest speaker at the 2011 Notre Dame Football Coaches Clinic.

He originally joined the Packers on Feb. 10, 2003, as assistant offensive linecoach, then spent 2004 and ’05 as tight ends/assistant offensive line coach,and was promoted to offensive line coach on Jan. 17, 2006. In his four seasons at the offensive helm, Philbin has directed both a productive and sound unit. The team’s 1,703 points from 2007-10 are the most in franchise history over a four-year period. League-wide, the offense has ranked in the top 10 in total yards and total points each year, joining the New England Patriots as the only teams in the NFL to accomplish that feat. The point total is third in the league over that span, trailing only New England (1,944) and New Orleans (1,736). In addition to Philbin, Kelly and Meyer, each member of the Notre Dame coaching staff and a pair of head coaches from two of the top high school programs in Ohio and South Carolina will make presentations. Mickey Wilson, head coach at Myrtle Beach High School in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Rick Finotti, head coach at Saint Edward High School in Cleveland, Ohio, will serve as guest speakers.

Twelve members of the Notre Dame fencing team will participate in this weekend’s NCAA Championships, which begin today in Columbus, Ohio. The four-day event will take place at the Gordon Track Center and will be hosted by Ohio State University. Notre Dame qualified the maximum 12 fencers for the fifth consecutive season, as they will send four fencers to compete in each weapon (two men and two women). The Irish contingent will be in pursuit of the program’s eighth national title. Representing Notre Dame at the championship in women’s epee are Courtney Hurley (San Antonio, Texas) and Ewa Nelip (Katowice, Poland).

In women’s foil, Hayley Reese (Crestwood, Ky.) and Rachel Beck (Tucson, Ariz.) will compete for the Irish. Reese, a senior, will be making her fourth trip in as many seasons. Reese earned her best finish at the NCAA Championships in the 2009 season, finishing runner-up, while in 2008 she placed 11th and this past year she finished in fifth place. Beck, a freshman on the Irish roster, will get her first taste of the Championships with this appearance. Senior Eileen Hassett (Beaverton, Ore.) and sophomore Lian Osier (Battle Ground, Wash.) will represent the Notre Dame women’s sabre squad. Hassett, making her fourth consecutive appearance, turned in back-to-back-to-back second-team All-America performances, finishing fifth, sixth and seventh in2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In her second year with the Irish, Osierwill be making her first appearance.

Both DeSmet, a freshman, and Bentley, a junior, will be making their first career appearance at the NCAA Championships. In men’s sabre, the team of Barron Nydam (Rancho Sante Fe, Calif.) and Avery Zuck (Portland, Ore.) will also be representing Notre Dame for the third consecutive year. Two seasons ago, Zuck earned second-team All-American honors by finishing fifth, while last season he became a first-team All-American after earning a share of third place. Nydam has appeared each of the last three seasons, earning second-team honors in 2008 with his sixth-place finish, and earned third-team honors in each 2009 and 2010 by finishing 10th on each occasion. In both 2008 and 2009, the Fighting Irish placed second at the NCAA Championships in Columbus, Ohio and State College, Pa., while last season the Irish finishedthird in Boston, Mass. Notre Dame has won the combined national championship in 1994, 2003 and 2005, with the 2003 and 2005 titles coming under the watch of current head coach Janusz Bednarski. The Fighting Irish claimed the men’s title in 1977, 1978 and 1986. The Notre Dame women also captured the NCAA crown in 1987.\n\n8. Basketball Times named Notre Dame’s Mike Brey as its national coach of the year in men’s college basketball and selected Irish guard Ben Hansbrough as a third-team All-American.\n\n9. For the first time in program history, three Notre Dame women’s basketball players — sophomore guard Skylar Diggins (South Bend, Ind./Washington), junior guard Natalie Novosel (Lexington, Ky./Lexington Catholic) and senior forward Devereaux Peters (Chicago, Ill./Fenwick) — have been selected among the 40 finalists for the State Farm Coaches’ All-America Team, it was announced Wednesday afternoon by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA). The Fighting Irish are one of only two programs in the country (along with Stanford) to have threeplayers chosen as finalists this season, with Notre Dame having fielded fiveState Farm Coaches’ All-America Team finalists in the past two seasons. The group of 40 finalists was selected by the State Farm Coaches’ All-America Team selection committee from a slate of 52 all-region honorees across of the WBCA’s eight regions. These players remain in the running for spots on the 10-member State Farm Coaches’ All-America Team that will be unveiled at 9 a.m. (ET) April 2 in Indianapolis during events surrounding the NCAA Women’s Final Four. Notre Dame has had two players earn a place on the prestigious squad — Ruth Riley (2001) and Jacqueline Batteast (2005).\n\n10. The Fighting Irish women’s basketball team ranks among the top 15 in the country in eight statistical categories, according to Wednesday’s NCAA statistics report. Notre Dame ranks third in the nation in steals (13.0), fourth in field goal percentage(.480), sixth in scoring margin (+22.0), ninth in assists (17.4) and reboundmargin (+8.6), 11th in scoring offense (77.5) and 15th in turnover margin (+4.97) and three-point defense (.272). These rankings are ironic for a Fighting Irish team that has just one player ranking higher than 50th in any category.\n\n11. Saturday’s NCAA women’s basketball game will mark the fifth time Notre Dame and Oklahoma have met on the hardwood, and the fourth time in the past four years. The teams have split the previous four matchups, all of which took place at neutral sites (like this weekend’s encounter), as well as their prior two games in the NCAA Championship, both of which went to overtime (Notre Dame won 79-75 in 2008 second round; Oklahoma won 77-72 in 2010 regional semifinal). The last time Notre Dame and Oklahoma met Nyeshia Stevenson hit a three-pointer from the corner with 4.4 seconds left in overtime and third-seeded Oklahoma knocked off second-seeded Notre Dame 77-72 on March 28, 2010, in an NCAA Kansas City Regional semifinal at the Sprint Center inKansas City, Mo. Stevenson had 21 points and Abi Olajuwon added 20 points and 14 rebounds for the Sooners, who lost to Notre Dame in overtime in the second round in 2008. Oklahoma muffed a chance to win at the end of regulation, asDanielle Robinson slipped 30 feet from the basket. But in OT, Stevenson calmly drilled a three from the corner that proved to be the winner. Notre Dame then chucked a long baseball pass, but Stevenson snagged it and knocked down twofree throws to seal the win. Melissa Lechlitner had 22 points and Lindsay Schrader had 19 to lead Notre Dame, which lost its fourth straight regional semifinal dating back to 2001. The first four games in the series have been decided by 10 points or fewer, with two going to overtime, and a third decided by three points.\n\n12. Heading into their NCAA matchup Saturday, Notre Dame and Merrimack have met five times in the all-time hockey series with the last meeting coming on Nov. 26, 1991. The Warriors lead the series, 3-2-0. The first time the two teams met was on Dec. 18, 1969 in the championship game of the Merrimack Tournament in Billerica,Mass. Notre Dame won that tournament with a 5-1 victory. During the 1988-89season, the teams played three times with the Warriors winning twice at NotreDame’s Joyce Center, 3-1 and 4-3, on Nov. 23 and 25 and then at North Andover on Jan. 7, 1989, 6-0. The final meeting was on Nov. 26, 1991, at Merrimack with the Irish taking a 2-1 decision.\n\n13. The last time Merrimack was in the NCAA Hockey Tournament was 1988. That year, the Warriors defeated Northeastern in the first round and then were eliminated by Lake Superior State in the second. Current Irish head coach Jeff Jackson was an assistant on that Lakers team that was on its way to the first of three NCAA Championships.\n\n14. Only five members of the 2010-11 Notre Dame hockey team have seen action in an NCAA Tournament.\n\n15. T.J. Tynan and Anders Lee enter the NCAA Hockey Tournament with 22 goals each this season. This marks the first time that Notre Dame has had two 20-goal scorers in 20 years.\n\n16. For the past eight weeks, the Notre Dame hockey team has been in good company with the Notre Dame men’s and women’s basketball teams. All three programs are ranked in the top 10 in the nation in their respective polls, making Notre Dame the only school in the country with a top 10 program in all three sports. The Irish hockey team is ranked ninth in both the USA Today/American Hockey Magazine and USCHO.com polls. With a 27-7 overall record, the Irish men’s basketball team entered the week ranked fifth in the Associated Press poll and the ESPN/USA Today rankings. The Notre Dame women’s team is 28-7 and ranked ninth in the Associated Press poll and seventh in the ESPN/USA Today rankings. The week of Jan. 31, 2010 marked the first time since Dec. 9, 2002, that both basketball programs were ranked in the top 10 at the same time. Notre Dame is the only Division I school in the country to have its men’s and women’s basketball programs and its hockey program in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nWednesday, March 23, 2011\n\n1. The 77th annual Hyundai Sun Bowl between the Miami and Notre Dame generated $24.6 million in total economic activity during the last week of 2010, according to a surveyconducted by Texas Perspectives, Inc., that was released last week. The City of El Paso, El Paso County and Sun Metro realized just under $400,000 in tax revenue during the last week of December, 2010. The revenues generated from the Hyundai Sun Bowl have allowed for the creation of approximately 393 new jobs in the community according to the study.

The 25th-ranked Notre Dame women’s golf team notched a first-place finish Tuesday at the John Kirk/Panther Intercollegiate in Stockbridge, Ga. The Irish registered a three-round total of 888 (+24) to earn the honor. Junior Becca Huffer (Denver, Colo./Littleton) was the team leader and second-place finisher in the tournament as she carded a 54-hole total of 211 (-5). Huffer’s second-place notch marked her top-finish this season, as well as her career-best 54-holetotal (211). The junior’s previous top score was a 217, which was during the 2008 LSU Classic. Maryland finished runner-up to the Irish and recorded a 905 (+41), followed by East Tennessee State in third place (906/+42). Both teams improved from a tie in fourth place after the first day of play. Kristina Nhim (Cypress, Calif./Cypress) improved from a 17th-place tie after the first day to a tie for ninth place. The freshman carded a third-round score of 73 for a total of 223 (+7), which is her second-best performance this season.

Junior libero Frenchy Silva was named to the United States Women’s National A2 Team, it was announced Tuesday by USA Volleyball. The honor came on the heels of last month’s impressive two-day tryout for Silva at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. Silva was an alternate for the same team in 2010. “This is a tremendous honor for Frenchy and a testament to her great work ethic,” Notre Dame head coach Debbie Brown said. “After being selected as an alternate last year, she was so determined to make it this year. Her skills are very solid but what’s most impressive is her ability to make others around her better. I know Frenchy will make the most out of this great opportunity.” Silva anchored the Irish during her junior campaign with a team-high 398 digs for a 3.75 digs/set average. She broke a sweat in 106 of Notre Dame’s 111 sets played.\n\n6. Notre Dame men’s soccer alumni should mark their calendars for the upcoming alumni weekend/team banquet.

Former Notre Dame swimmer Ry Beville (he’s a ’97 Notre Dame graduate) is in Japan, working in the earthquake zone as an interpreter and logistics coordinator. He’s based in Ichinoseki (Miyagi) where he’s attached to an aid team that ferries supplies to evacuation centers in Kessenuma and Rikuzen-takata, two particularly hard-hit towns. The latter, in fact, has been completely wiped away. More than half of the town’s population is missing. The entire local swim team and coach are a part of those numbers.\n\n10.

By the time the Irish men’s basketball team took the floor at the United Center Sunday night, the San Antonio Regional already had taken on a decidedly Virginia flair – with Richmond qualifying Saturday and VCU in the opener last night pasting favored #3 seed Purdue.\n\nIt had been a long few days – as the Irish didn’t find out until very early Saturday morning what time tip-off would be tonight and many in the Irish contingent didn’t hear the word until they woke up Saturday. The Notre Dame players broke up the day with a half-hour shooting session at the United Center about two Sunday afternoon, but otherwise they spent most of their time around the hotel in downtown Chicago.\n\nIf routine meant anything, the Irish were in the same locker room, on the same bench and their fans were in the same sections as in Notre Dame’s win Friday over Akron.\n\nScott Martin suffered an early injury and left the game before it was three minutes old but was back seven minutes in and with the Irish down 14-9 after the Seminoles scored seven in a row. At the 12:33 timeout, Florida State had hit six of its first nine shots while the Irish were only four for 13. The ‘Noles were red-hot – hitting nine of their first 15 shots compared to only seven of 22 for Notre Dame, so it was 23-15 Florida State at the 7:36 mark. The ‘Noles banged in five of their first eight three-point tries. That went to six of 10 and a 28-16 Seminole edge at 5:55. At the half it was 34-23 Florida State in a bruising, physical 30 minutes that featured lights-out shooting by theFloridians who hit 67 fewer threes than Notre Dame as a team in the regularseason. The Irish box score at half hardly looked familiar – with TimAbromaitis three of nine shooting, Ben Hansbrough one of five, Scott Martinzero for three and Carleton Scott one out of five. Florida State managed only two more total field goals than the Irish in the opening half – but its halftime margin came thanks to six more threes than Notre Dame managed (with the Irish one of 10 from three-point distance).\n\nBut the second half didn’t start much better, as Florida State went up 43-26 after Scott’s fourth foul and then pushed it to 20 at 47-27. At that juncture the five Seminole starters were a combined 15 for 28 from the floor, and the margin jumped to 52-29 at the 11:59 media timeout — with the Irish making only 11 of 38 shot attempts so far. From there Notre Dame scored 11 straight to cut it to 52-40 at the 8:27 stop. But, with the Irish in the double bonus, the Seminoles salted it away mostly at the free-throw line. Hansbrough’s career ended when he fouled out at the 3:19 mark with 18 points. Abromaitis had 21 but only six in the first half.\n\n2. Notre Dame and Cornell traveled to Maryland to face each other in what became a defensive battle on Sunday afternoon as the Big Red handed the Irish a 6-5 loss in double overtime in a women’s lacrosse game played at St. Paul’s School in Lutherville, Md. Cornell’s Jessi Steinberg capped her three-goal afternoon when she beat Irish goalkeeper Ellie Hilling just 18 seconds into the second overtime stanza. Steinberg’s goal capped what turned into a defensive struggle all afternoon as the Irish scored four times in the first half, holding the Big Red off the scoreboard and Cornell returned the favor in the second, blanking the Irish while scoring four of its own. In the first overtime, the teams traded goals before Notre Dame surrendered the game winner in the sudden death extra stanza. Senior Kailene Abt led the Irish with two goals while Kaitlyn Brosco, Shaylyn Blaney and Kaitlin Keena had single goals. Cornell got single goals from Katie Kirk, Kelly Lang and Olivia Knotts to compliment Steinberg’s hat trick. The loss drops Notre Dame to 3-4 on the season while Cornell improves to 3-3 overall. The Irish are next in action on Sunday when they travel to Hempstead, N.Y., to face the Hofstra Pride in a noon game at Shuart Stadium.\n\n3. After a tough final round of play on Sunday, the 27th-ranked Notre Dame men’s golf team finished in 12th place (out of 15 teams) at the 32nd annual Schenkel Invitational at Forest Heights Country Club in Statesboro, Ga. The Irish final round saw them post a 22-over par, 310. Individually, Tom Usher (Bradford, England) led the Irish at the tournament, finishing tied for 20th at two-over par (218). Usher battled through the tough round to piece together the top Irish score of the day, carding a three-over par 75. He made the turn at one over after birdies on the seventh and eighth holes to recover his round after three straight bogeys on holes two through four. On the back side, Usher recorded seven pars to go along with a pair of bogeys. The finish gives Usher his fifth top-25 tournament result on the season.\n\n4. Notre Dame and Gonzaga played to a 3-3 tie after 12 innings on the final day of the 2011 Irish Baseball Classic from Wolff Stadium Sunday afternoon in San Antonio. The game was called due curfew as both the Irish and Bulldogs needed to catch flights. Notre Dame returns home from their spring break trip with a 7-10-1 record, while Gonzaga is now 10-7-1. The Irish had a golden chance to win the game in the bottom of the 12th inning. With the bases loaded and two outs, fifth-year senior Herman Petzold ripped a 1-2 offering from Gonzaga reliever Billy Moon right back up the middle. In complete self-defense, the southpaw pulled his glove up to his face and somehow managed to snag the liner to end the game. Irish senior RHP Todd Miller did not factor in the decision, but tossed another gem. He limited Gonzaga to a pair of earned runs of seven hits in 7.0 innings of work. Miller struck out five and walked two. Notre Dame took a 3-2 lead into the ninth inning, but the Bulldogs rallied off junior RHP Will Hudgins. The closer walked Acker to open the frame. After Edman executed a sacrifice bunt to move Acker into scoring position, Hudgins struck out Stanford and was one strike away from securing the victory and his second save of the season, but Moon laced a 1-2 offering into right center field to tie the score, 3-3. Freshman LHP Anthony McIver, freshman RHP Sean Fitzgerald, Hudgins and freshman Dan Slania limited Gonzaga to one earned run on five hits in 5.0 innings out of the bullpen. The quartet fanned three and walked two. Sophomore 2B Frank DeSico paced the Irish attack with three hits. Freshman OF Eric Jagielo went 2-for-5 with an RBI double. Sophomore 3B Adam Norton went 1-for-3 with two RBI. Senior DH Matt Grosso also chipped in with a pair of hits. Notre Dame returns to South Bend and hosts Oakland at 5:35 p.m. Tuesday in the 2011 Eck Stadium opener.\n\n5.

The Irish did not make the tournament last season and their last appearance came in 2008-09 when they were a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional and were upset by Bemidji State, 5-1, in the opening game at Grand Rapids. In 2007-08, Notre Dame was the last at-large team to make the tournament and advanced to the Frozen Four where they lost in the national championship game to Boston College, 4-1, after defeating Michigan, 5-4, in the semifinals. Notre Dame advanced out of the West Regional at Colorado Springs, Colo., as a No. 4 seed with a 7-3 win over top-seeded NewHampshire and then won the regional with a 3-1 win over Michigan State.

Notre Dame’s Brittany Mallory had no points and one assist in Saturday’s 67-54 first-round NCAA women’s basketball tournament win over Utah in Salt Lake City. What won’t show in the stats was her defensive effort in cooling off the hot-shooting Iwalani Rodrigues. Offensively, Skylar Diggins and Natalie Novosel scored 20 pointsapiece to lead the second-seeded Irish past 15th-seeded Utah. The Irish (27-7) face Temple (24-8) in a second-round game at 9:30 p.m. ET (7:30 p.m. MT) Monday on ESPN2. Utah led late in the first half and was within five points with 8minutes remaining, but the Irish went on a 10-2 run to put the game out of reach. Rodrigues would lead Utah with 21 points on 6-of-9 shooting but didn’t score another field goal after her string of eight straight points pulled Utah within 43-41. Notre Dame went on a 6-0 run after that, fueled by back-to-back scores by Diggins and Novosel. Then Notre Dame’s 6-2 forward Devereaux Peters came up big down the stretch and finished with four blocks. Janita Badon had three steals for Utah but struggled offensively, hitting only 4 of 21 shots. Utah (18-17) had the most losses of any team in the NCAA field, but entered Saturday’s game on a roll, having won four games in five days to claim the Mountain West Conference tourney title. The young Utes had hoped to pull off another shocker. But they couldn’t get their shots to fall Saturday. Utah shot just 32.7 percent and committed 18 turnovers. Four Notre Dame players scored in double figures, with Bruszewski adding 13 and Peters 12. Notre Dame has won its first-round game in the NCAA Championship in 14 of its last 16 appearances (1996-present).\n\n2. The weekend didn’t go as Notre Dame had hoped when they returned to Joe Louis Arena and the CCHA Tournament for the first time since winning the playoff championship in March of 2009. Instead, the Irish were handed a pair of losses, first by Miami, 6-2, in the CCHA semifinals on Friday night and then by Michigan, 4-2, in the third-place game on Saturday. Saturday’s loss was not for a lack of effort as Notre Dame peppered Michigan goaltender Shawn Hunwick with 44 shots but was only able to get goals from Riley Sheahan and T.J. Tynan on the afternoon. Four different Wolverines scored in the win as Louie Caporusso, Carl Hagelin, Jeff Rohrkemper and Luke Glendening contributed to the scoresheet in the victory. The loss drops the eighth-ranked Irish to 23-13-5 overall while fourth-ranked Michigan improves to 26-10-4 for the year. The Irish play in the NCAA Northeast Regional in Manchester, N.H. – as the #3 seed vs. #2 seed Merrimack. The other game features #1 Miami and #4 New Hampshire.

The 17th-ranked Notre Dame women’s tennis team ended its spring break trip on a high note, claiming a 5-2 win over 18th-ranked Tennessee on Saturday at the USF Varsity Tennis Courts in Tampa, Fla. The Irish finish the trip with a 1-2 record and are now 9-7 overall. The Irish took the 1-0 lead on the Volunteers, capturing the doubles point for the second time on the trip. After trailing 4-1 at No. 1 doubles, the 33rd-ranked team of Kristy Frilling (Sidney, Ohio) and Shannon Mathews (Birmingham, Mich.) went on to win seven of the next eight games to defeat Tennessee’s duo of Natalie Pluskota and Millie Nichols, ranked 59th, 8-5. Chrissie McGaffigan (Davenport, Iowa) and Kristen Rafael (Grand Prairie, Texas) then closed out the doublespoint for the Irish, taking down Rosalia Alda and Maria Sorbello at No. 2 doubles in a back-and-forth match, 8-6. The win brings an end to the tandem’s three-match losing streak. Tennessee captured the match at No. 3 doubles, as Jennifer Kellner (Smithtown, N.Y.) and Julie Sabacinski (Plantation, Fla.) fell to Jennifer Meredith and Kata Szekely, 9-7. Frilling, ranked third nationally, returned to her usual spot atop the Irish singles lineup and wasted little time making a statement. The junior downed #42 Pluskota in straight sets, 6-1, 6-0, to improve her dual record to a perfect 13-0. She has now knocked off four consecutive ranked opponents and is 14-2 overall against ranked foes this season.

Notre Dame returns to action on Thursday (March 24) when the team heads out to take on 20th-ranked Georgia Tech at the Bill Moore Tennis Center in Atlanta, Ga.\n\n4. Notre Dame got another superb pitching performance from senior RHP Cole Johnson, but it was not enough to overcome three errors that allowed three critical unearned runs as Gonzaga knocked off the Irish, 4-1, at the Irish Baseball Classic at Wolff Stadium Saturday afternoon in San Antonio. Notre Dame is now 7-10 and has dropped three consecutive games. The Bulldogs have won four straight and improved to 9-7. Johnson, now 1-4 on the year, was charged with the loss. The right-handed hurler registered his fifth quality start in as many outings and lowered his season ERA to 2.57. Johnson limited Gonzaga to a pair of runs, one earned, on fourhits in 7.0 innings of work. He struck out seven and walked just one. Johnson, who was the starting pitcher in the 19-2 rout of Purdue on Feb. 19, has garnered a total of six runs of support over his last four starts. Marco Gonzales (2-2) fired a complete game, six-hitter. He allowed one earned run and retired 10 of the last 11 Irish batters. Gonzales struck out seven and issued one walk. Clayton Eslick of Gonzaga was the only player in the game with more than one hit. He went 2-for-4. The Bulldogs managed just five hits, while the Irish registered six.
