        "text": "Toreros enter event as No. 5 seed, will take on eighth-seeded Waves on Friday night at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas\n\nLAS VEGAS — After a resurgent 2023-2024 campaign that saw it add six overall wins and four more conference victories from its totals a year ago to secure its best regular-season finish since 2014-2015 and its first winning record since 2018-2019, San Diego men's basketball (17-14, 7-9 WCC) is set to begin play in the 2024 Credit Union 1 WCC Tournament on Friday night as the event's No. 5 seed, taking on eighth-seeded Pepperdine (13-19, 5-11 WCC) at 6:00 p.m. PST in the Orleans Arena.\n\nUSD's second-round tournament matchup with the Waves will be streamed live on ESPN+ with J.B. Long (play-by-play), Darren Collison (analyst) and Jordan Robinson (sideline reporter) on the call.\n\nJack Cronin will have the call for a live radio broadcast of the game on USDToreros.com.\n\nLive statistics for all 2024 Credit Union 1 WCC Tournament games will be provided via StatBroadcast.\n\nMOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION\n\n• USD's 17-14 overall record in 2023-2024 marks a six-win improvement from the 11-20 mark it posted a year ago.\n\n• The Toreros' 7-9 WCC record this season is three wins better than their 4-12 WCC totals in 2023-2024.\n\n• San Diego's fifth-place finish in the 2023-2024 WCC standings came after it was picked to place last (ninth) in the 2023-24 WCC Men's Basketball Preseason Poll, and is its highest finish since 2014-2015, when it ended the regular season in fifth place at 15-16 overall and 8-10 in league play.\n\n• USD concluded the 2017-2018 regular season in a three-way tie for fourth place in the WCC standings with San Francisco and Pacific, but the Toreros lost both tiebreakers to slip to the sixth seed in the WCC Tournament.\n\n• With eight freshmen and nine total newcomers in 2023-2024, head coach Steve Lavin steered San Diego to its first winning campaign since 2018-2019, ending a four-year streak of losing seasons at USD.\n\nALL-TIME SERIES AGAINST PEPPERDINE\n\n• The Toreros are 52-67 against Pepperdine all-time, with the two teams' most recent meeting coming earlier this season on Saturday, January 27, when the Toreros earned a narrow 69-67 win over the Waves on the road at Firestone Fieldhouse by way of late-game heroics from junior guard Wayne McKinney III.\n\n• The Coronado High School graduate took the ball with 21 seconds to go and the score tied at 67-67 and waited until there were just a pair of seconds left on the clock to take his shot, a fadeaway jumper just above the free-throw line that was heavily contested by the Waves' 6-foot-11 forward Jevon Porter. When it went in, USD was up by two, and after Pepperdine failed to get a last-chance shot off, the Toreros had earned back-to-back wins on the road.\n\n• USD last hosted Pepperdine earlier this season on January 13, 2024, when it suffered a tough 83-77 decision against the Tigers at home in the Jenny Craig Pavilion.\n\n• San Diego has faced off against Pepperdine in the WCC Tournament 13 times since 1979, boasting a 13-5 record over the Waves in the postseason.\n\n• The two teams' last matchup in the postseason came on March 4th, 2022 in the 2022 WCC Tournament, when USD claimed a 74-67 victory over the Waves in the first round.\n\n• McKinney III, then a freshman, scored nine points on 3-for-6 shooting that night, going 1-for-1 from distance and 2-for-2 from the line while grabbing three rebounds and dishing out an assist across 18 minutes. He is the only player on the Toreros' current roster who appeared in that game, which remains San Diego's most recent WCC Tournament win.\n\nLAST TIME OUT: Turner Scores 30 as Toreros Beat Tigers in Regular-Season Finale\n\n• San Diego men's basketball took advantage of being inside the friendly confines of the Jenny Craig Pavilion last Saturday night as it defeated Pacific 81-69 to get back on track heading into the 2024 Credit Union 1 West Coast Conference Tournament.\n\n• Junior guard Deuce Turner recorded a game-high 30 points in USD's regular-season finale.\n\n• The Toreros, who snapped their three-game losing streak, recorded 23 points off 13 turnovers by the Tigers.\n\nNotable:\n\n• Turner recorded 30 points to lead all scorers. It marks the third time he has reached the 30-point plateau and the 12th time in the last 16 games a Torero has either achieved or been tied for the game scoring-high.\n\n• The 14 points for McKinney III marked his first double-digit scoring effort in three games. He added six rebounds and a team-high four assists.\n\n• Jamerson II's 13 rebounds marked his first game with double-digit rebounds in five games. He is averaging a team-high 8.3 rebounds this season.\n\n• Senior guard Deven Dahlke recorded 10 points, which is one away from his season-high.\n\n• With Turner, McKinney III and Dahlke in double figures, USD improves to 9-5 when it has three players with at least 10 points.\n\n• USD scored 23 points off 13 Pacific turnovers, compared to the Tigers scoring just five points off nine Torero turnovers.\n\nThey Said It:\n\nHead coach Steve Lavin on the growth of his team, especially with playing five freshmen routinely:\n\n• \"Measurable progress, that's what this (conference) season has been about. A year ago, won 11 games overall. Now we're at 17 with an opportunity to pick up some more wins in the conference tournament. In league play, a year ago we were at four wins and now we're at seven. That's progress as you climb the ladder in the West Coast Conference. It's difficult, it's challenging, but our players are taking strides in the right direction, both individually in their development and then as a group playing a good brand of basketball.\"\n\nTURNER HEADLINES TRIO OF WCC BASKETBALL HONORS\n\n• Junior guard Deuce Turner was named the 2023-2024 WCC Sixth Man of the Year alongside three All-WCC selections for the Toreros, the West Coast Conference announced on Tuesday morning.\n\n• Turner and fellow junior guard Wayne McKinney III were both selected to the All-WCC Second Team, and first-year guard Kevin Patton Jr. earned a spot on the All-WCC Freshman Team.\n\n• A native of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, Turner transferred to San Diego in 2022 after spending time at Bucknell and South Plains College. He established himself as one of the WCC's premier offensive players across 29 games and just 11 starts this season, leading USD with 15.8 points per game and 458 total points while making 61 three-pointers and shooting 37.9% from beyond the arc.\n\n• He has racked up 30 or more points on three occasions in 2023-2024, including a 34-point performance against Saint Mary's on January 4 that remains tied for the most in a single game by any WCC player this year, the sixth-most in a single game in San Diego history, and is the Toreros' most in a game since November 17, 2022, when graduate transfer Eric Williams Jr. scored 43 against Utah State and broke the previous USD record of 40 that dated back to 1972.\n\n• His WCC Sixth Man of the Year award and All-WCC Second Team selection mark the first conference honors of his USD career.\n\n• McKinney III received his second career end-of-year conference honor after becoming one of the league's most consistent and well-rounded players as a junior in 2023-2024. Through 30 games played (all starts), he leads USD in assists (88), made free throws (115), and double-digit scoring performances (24). McKinney III ranks second amongst his teammates in total points (411), points per game (13.7), and steals (39), and his 106 total rebounds and 85 defensive boards both rank third on the Torero roster.\n\n• He leads the WCC in made free throws (113) and ranks second in free throw attempts (154) this season while shooting 74.7% from the line. His 31 points at Pacific on February 10 made him the third San Diego player this season to total 30 points or more in a single game.\n\n• McKinney III, a graduate of nearby Coronado High School, received the Alex Smith Courage in Sports Award on February 5th at the San Diego Sports Association's 76th Annual Salute to the Champions.\n\n• He has previously earned All-WCC Freshman Team honors (2021-2022) and was named the WCC Player of the Week earlier this season on February 12.\n\n• Patton Jr. made an immediate impact for San Diego in his first college season and quickly emerged as the conference's most dynamic first-year player, earning a league-best four WCC Freshman of the Week awards while averaging 9.5 points per game and totaling 286 points, 133 rebounds, 72 assists, 42 steals, 42 blocks, and 23 three-pointers across 30 games (14 starts).\n\n• He leads USD in both blocks and steals, ranks second in assists, total rebounds, defensive rebounds, and rebounds per game, is third among his teammates in made free throws and field goals per game, and is fourth on the Torero roster in made threes, total points, and points per game.\n\n• Patton Jr.'s 42 blocks and 1.42 blocks per game were the most of any WCC player this season. His 42 total steals and 1.40 steals per game were both the fifth most in the conference.\n\nDOMINIC MUNCEY EARNS WCC ALL-ACADEMIC HONORS\n\n• Dominic Muncey has been selected to the 2023-2024 WCC All-Academic First Team, the West Coast Conference announced on Wednesday morning.\n\n• Muncey, a junior guard who graduated from nearby Cathedral Catholic High School, posted a 3.30 GPA this year while pursuing an undergraduate degree in Real Estate.\n\n• He appeared in 28 games in the 2023-2024 regular season, including 14 starts. Across 334 minutes (11.9 minutes per game) Muncey totaled 23 points while making three three-pointers alongside 28 rebounds, seven assists, 16 steals, and a block.\n\nTOP FIVE\n\nThrough 31 games in the 2023-2024 regular season, San Diego ranks among the West Coast Conference's top five teams in the following statistical categories…\n\n• Bench Points per Game 1st (26.13), 41st in the nation\n\n• Fastbreak Points Per Game 2nd (13.87), 28th in the nation\n\n• Free Throw Percentage 2nd (73.4)\n\n• Free Throws Made Per Game 2nd (14.0)\n\n• Turnovers Forced Per Game 2nd (12.94)\n\n• Blocks per Game 3rd (3.8)\n\n• Free Throws Attempts Per Game 3rd (19.1)\n\n• Steals Per Game 3rd (7.0)\n\n• Offensive Rebounds Per Game 5th (9.94)\n\n• Rebounds Per Game 5th (34.29)\n\n• Scoring Offense 5th (72.8)\n\n• Winning Percentage 5th (.548)\n\nLEADING THE WAY\n\nA San Diego player has either achieved or been tied for the game scoring high in 11 of the Toreros' last 15 contests.
