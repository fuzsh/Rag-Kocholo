        "text": "December 2001\n\nCougars Fall In Heartbreaker\n\nTampa scored 14 seconds into overtime and eliminated SIUE 2-1 from the semifinals of the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Tournament.\n\nKareem Escayg scored from 15 yards out just seconds into the extra period and dashed SIUE's hopes of winning a third national championship.\n\nThe Cougars completed the season with a 17-3-3 record with a run equaled since the Cougars advanced to the NCAA Division I semifinals in 1982.\n\nWith a picture remembrance of the 1979 national championship trophy safely guarding the bench, SIUE had taken the early lead as David Mwendapole scored from 15 yards out as he split defenders and accepted a pass from Yuzuru Takami at 13:44. \"The pass that Takami made was just incredible,\" Mwendapole said.\n\nTampa then went on the offensive by outshooting SIUE 12-5 in the game. The Spartans didn't tie the game until 86:55 when the team's leading scorer, Roy Fink, tied the game with a header that slipped past SIUE goalkeeper Matt Evers.\n\nEscayg came out blazing early in the overtime period and dashed past the SIUE defenders. \"He buried it. It was a good shot. It wasn't any kind of letdown in the defense,\" said SIUE's Evers.\n\nJustin McMillian, SIUE's leading scorer, was shut out by the Spartan defense. He said Tampa used an edge in the overtime. \"I certainly believe they had that play set up and it certainly worked,\" McMillian said.\n\nEngineering Building Wins CDB's Madigan Award\n\nThe School of Engineering Building, along with its building project construction partners, has been selected to receive the Illinois Capital Development Board's (CDB) 2001 Thomas H. Madigan Award.\n\nThe awards, given annually to the organizations involved in the successful completion of a state construction project, will be presented at a luncheon ceremony in Springfield on Friday, Nov. 30.\n\n\"'Partnership' was the key word in the successful design and completion of the School of Engineering's new building,\" said SIUE Chancellor David Werner, SIUE chancellor. \"From the project's inception to its completion, this building has been a cooperative (effort) between the university, the School of Engineering, its faculty, staff and students, the building's architects, contractors, the CDB, and the many individuals and companies who worked on its construction. The university is not alone in rightfully being proud of (this) magnificent new building.\"\n\nWith its striking blue glass and brick design, the School of Engineering Building stands on the west side of the central campus and first opened its doors to students for Fall Semester 2000.\n\nThe Madigan Awards, now in their 14th year, are not design or construction awards but are presented to all parties involved in the successful completion of a state project, including the building's user agency, the CDB project managers, contractors, and architects/engineers. The awards recognize the partnership essential to the successful completion of a CDB project. Since its inception, more than 50 projects have been honored with Madigan Awards, representing more than 350 project team members.\n\nThe SIUE building is receiving a special merit for new construction award. In addition to the university, those being recognized with the award are FGM Architects Engineers; William Brothers Construction Inc.; Rite Electric Company; GRP Mechanical Co. Inc.; Kane Mechanical Inc.; Belleville Mechanical Inc.; L&K Fire Protection Inc.; Central Electrical Contracting Inc.; Terry Phelan; Ross & Baruzzini of Illinois Inc.; Oates Associates Inc.; and Construction Value Specialists Inc. Each partner will receive a plaque commemorating the award.\n\nThe Madigan Awards judging committee consists of six industry professionals representing general and mechanical contractors, architects, engineers, user agencies, and the CDB.\n\nICBCHE Gives Excellence Award To SIUE's Initiatives\n\nThe Illinois Committee on Black Concerns in Higher Education (ICBCHE) has recognized SIUE for its minority recruitment and retention initiatives with its ICBCHE Excellence Award. The award was presented to the university at the committee's annual conference held at the University of Illinois Chicago at the end of October.\n\nThe ICBCHE Excellence Award was established to identify, recognize and honor successful, creative and effective approaches to areas that have an impact on the performance and achievement of students, faculty and staff. This year the committee used the award to recognize programs that encourage the recruitment and employment of African American faculty and staff.\n\n\"SIUE's desire to increase the presence of minority faculty and staff is a primary goal throughout the institution,\" said Rudolph Wilson, assistant provost for cultural and social diversity. \"We are pleased to have our efforts recognized in such a manner by the ICBCHE.\"\n\nAt the university, as new and replacement positions become available, search committees are encouraged to develop a recruitment plan to include strategies for inviting minorities to apply. Job descriptions are written in such a manner as to encourage qualified minority applications. Monitoring of the recruitment efforts by the chancellor, vice chancellors, deans, EEOC coordinator, and directors sends a strong message to search committees to commit to diversity in their recruitment efforts.\n\nThrough attrition, departments that are not diversified are encouraged to make a strong effort to seek minority applicants. Sometimes, at the urging of deans and directors, new positions are established due to enrollment increases or faculty replacement. Search committees are encouraged to increase the presence of minority faculty and staff at SIUE.\n\nThe Minority Recruitment and Retention fund supports programs that help SIUE faculty and staff become more knowledgeable and sensitive to minority recruitment efforts. They are encouraged to attend conferences, institutes and programs whose themes deal with minority recruitment and retention. By understanding the complexity of the development of a positive minority recruitment plan, these individuals come back to the University with the needed information to support diversity initiatives.\n\nSIUE has an outstanding history for the recruitment of minorities. Beginning in 1967, the Experiment in Higher Education on the East St. Louis campus-a recruitment model-was established. By 1968, an associate provost for minority affairs position had been created, charged with recruiting minority faculty at the Edwardsville campus. The Minority Recruitment and Retention fund was established in 1989 through the financial support of the Illinois legislatures and then-university President Earl Lazerson.\n\nThe Illinois Committee on Black Concerns in Higher Education was formed in 1982 with the intent of consolidating efforts toward monitoring, halting, and reversing decline of Black students, faculty members, and staff in higher education. The ICBCHE is an organization dedicated to addressing a multitude of pressing issues that confront Black people on college campuses.\n\nICBCHE is primarily composed of people who are involved in and concerned with various facets of post-secondary education. Memberships encompass the faculty, staff, students, and administrators, of public and private educational institutions, legislators, and others who embrace the ICBCHE vision.\n\nOpening\n\nSIUE launched its new disc golf course last month, and as part of that grand opening, Chancellor David Werner took a few tosses (see photo below). The opening was followed by a Scramble Disc Golf Tournament sponsored by the Office of Campus Recreation. Bringing a disc golf course-also known as Frisbee™ Gold - to SIUE was an idea of Werner's. \"Disc golf is one of those new 'cutting edge' recreational opportunities,\" he said. With the growing popularity of disc golf-there are more than 700 courses across the country-the sport has even gone pro with the creation of the Professional Disc Golf Association. To use the new course, students, faculty and staff need to show their ID at the Prairie Hall front desk to check out a set of golf discs and/or scorecards. There is no charge to check equipment out and individuals may use their own discs to play. For more information about the new disc golf course, call Chad Rodgers, assistant director of recreational programs, (618) 650-3242, or Shelly Wolfe, marketing coordinator for University Housing, (618) 650-4628. (SIUE Photo)\n\nTeachers, Aides Learn CPR At East St. Louis Center\n\nTeachers and teacher aides in the Project Success and Latchkey programs at the East St. Louis Center recently received certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid.\n\nLaura McCleod, American Red Cross certified instructor and St. Clair County Head Start staff member, taught the two-day training course to 17 participants. \"It is vital that our teachers and teacher aides know how to properly administer possible life saving techniques such as CPR,\" McCleod said. \"Teachers and teacher aides are trained each year in CPR and every three years in first aid.\"\n\nProject Success serves children ages six to 12 who are referred by the Department of Children and Family Services and are in need of special services. The main objective is to promote welfare of the whole child. Children receive daily balanced meals, counseling, tutorial services, cultural exposure, and stimulating positive socialization skills.\n\nLatchkey is an after-school child care program that provides a safe place for children to stay while parent are away from home, at work, in school, or in training. It also gives supplemental education support through tutorial service, academic enrichment and social, cultural and physical development. Janina Turley is program director of both programs.\n\nNovember 13, 2001\n\nNew Criminal Justice Program To Be Launched\n\nWith a growing number of criminal justice-related jobs in Illinois and a dwindling supply of people with the training to fill the demand, SIUE will launch a new degree in Criminal Justice Studies in January.\n\nHugh Barlow, professor of sociology and chair of that department, said the program will \"be very competitive\" with other criminal justice programs, and will have a strong liberal arts foundation.\n\n\"Our goal is to prepare graduates for a broad range of criminal justice careers,\" Barlow said. \"That means careers in the court system, probation and parole, correctional system, law enforcement, and related fields.\n\n\"We anticipate that there will be strong demand for this degree,\" he said,. \"particularly among people already working in the criminal justice system who do not have a four-year degree.\"\n\nPrior criminal justice coursework and grade point average will be among the determining factors for admission to the major. The program will meet the Illinois Articulation Initiative, which establishes guidelines for transfers of credit from one college or university to another throughout the state. Under this program, Illinois students will be able to transfer up to 15 hours of specified criminal justice coursework.\n\n\"Ideally, we'd like CJ students to be juniors when they declare the major,\" Barlow said. \"We also envision the program as one that allows place-bound and working adults to meet their educational and career needs. They may need a criminal justice degree in order to be promoted, or to change their career path.\"\n\nBarlow said courses will eventually be offered in both the day and evening, to accommodate traditional and non-traditional students. All students will be required to complete an internship in order to graduate.\n\n\"We're very enthusiastic about getting this program off the ground,\" said Barlow, adding that three new faculty members will be hired for the fall and one will be added in 2003. \"We are providing an educational opportunity that previously did not exist in Southwestern Illinois.\"\n\nThe curriculum will not be fully developed until next year. For this reason, no more than 20-25 students will be admitted this year, with an additional 40 in fall 2002. Interested students should contact Barlow or David Kauzlarich, (618) 650-3713), for more information.\n\nWater Supply, Terrorism Discussion At ERTC Nov. 16\n\nConsideration of heightened security measures for a wide range of public services has become prevalent as a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Among the homeland security issues being closely examined and discussed is the safety of the nation's water supply.\n\nAs part of the ongoing dialog and preparedness actions being taken, SIUE's Environmental Resources Training Center (ERTC) is presenting a panel discussion, \"Terrorism and Public Water Supply,\" at noon Friday, Nov. 16, at the center, one-half mile west of the North University Drive entrance on Poag Road.\n\n\"By now, most city councils have discussed the safety of their water supply,\" said Robert Whitworth, acting ERTC director. \"We hope this panel discussion will comfort people and get them to thinking about how to best protect their water systems.\"\n\nThe discussion group will focus on measures used by water suppliers to protect the public from terrorist acts via the water supply. Areas to be discussed include source water contamination, water treatment, water distribution systems, chemical delivery storage, types of contaminants, and other relevant topics.\n\nThe panel will be directly addressing issues faced by water plant operators, supervisors, and city officials responsible for the public water supply. Panel members, who will be answering questions related to their area of expertise, are:\n\n• Larry Skora, of the FBI;\n\n• Ellen Storment, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture;\n\n• Todd Rowe, of the Illinois EPA (IEPA);\n\n• Dave George, of George Alarm Company, Glen Carbon;\n\n• Mike Curry, an engineer with Curry and Associates, a Nashville;\n\n• Kim Bateman, of the ERTC.\n\n\"People pretty much take their drinking water for granted,\" said Whitworth. \"Without being alarmists, this is not a time to be complacent. With discussions such as this one, people will begin talking and generating good ideas for water supply protection. That will just make everyone feel safer.\"\n\nIn 1977, ERTC was designated by the IEPA as the Illinois center for the continuing education of personnel involved in the operation, maintenance, and management of drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. The ERTC offers courses designed to assist both entry level personnel who are preparing for a career in wastewater and drinking water treatment systems and persons already employed in such systems who desire additional education to upgrade job skills and prepare for more responsible positions. Additionally, the ERTC offers courses for licensed plumbers and water operators in cross connection control.\n\nPersons who complete ERTC courses are awarded continuing education units (CEUs) by the University that are applicable to certification requirements for water and wastewater treatment operators. Courses and CEUs are also issued to licensed plumbers in cross connection control under requirements administered by the IEPA and the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\nRegistration for \"Terrorism and Public Water Supply\" is $25 and limited to 90 people. CEUs will be awarded for the discussion. For registration information, call the ERTC, (618) 650-2030.\n\nReception\n\nThe former president of Poland, Nobel Prize-winner Lech Walesa, was on campus recently to speak for the Arts & Issues program. He also took time to meet members of the university community at a reception in his honor.\n\nESTL Center Hosts Partners' Reception\n\nMore than 150 people recently celebrated their years of collaboration with the East St. Louis Center at its first annual Partners' Reception.\n\n\"We could not do the job we do with our children, our clients, and our programs if it were not for the firm commitment and constant support we receive from our partners in the Metro East area,\" said Center Director Patricia Harrison.\n\n\"The reception was one small way of thanking everyone for their contributions and recognizing our powerful partnership,\" Harrison said. \"Because together, the SIUE East St. Louis Center and its partners help empower people and strengthen communities.\"\n\nPartners from the area and SIUE community enjoyed an evening of fellowship, entertainment and were able to learn more about the 16 programs at the center. Those at the reception representing SIUE included Chancellor David Werner, Provost Sharon Hahs, and Associate Provost David Sill.\n\nRepresentatives from local businesses, school districts and organizations were part of the crowd. The East St. Louis Center for the Performing Arts After School Theater Arts Program presented the dance number, \"Let the Good Times Roll,\" and Reggie Thomas, an associate professor of music, and the SIUE Jazz Combo performed throughout the reception.\n\nThe Original 'Babe' On Campus Nov. 30 For A&I\n\nSinger, songwriter, and comedienne Christine Lavin-the original \"Babe\" from the singing group, The Babes-will perform in concert Nov. 30 in Katherine Dunham Hall theater as part of the Arts & Issues series.\n\nWith only an acoustic guitar and an endless supply of witty anecdotes, Lavin takes audiences on a wonderful musical journey. She will appear at 7:30 p.m. in Meridian Ballroom on the first floor of the Morris University Center.\n\n\"Last year's appearance by The Babes was one of the high spots of the season, and now we have the woman who started it all,\" says Karen Bollinger, acting coordinator of the Arts & Issues series. \"Christine Lavin is a one-woman entertainment package, so look for an evening of quality musicianship and humor.\"\n\nLavin, who has recorded and released 13 solo albums of original material, has created, directed, produced, and taught performance courses in 1992 and 1993 at the Martha's Vineyard Singer/ Songwriters' Retreat for songwriters on that island to meet, collaborate, and record new material.\n\nShe has won several music awards and her songs have been performed in concert by such artists as the Dartmouth Decibelles, the Washington, D.C., Gay Men's Chorus, Scottish troubadour Brian McNeil, and singer Andrea Marcovicci.\n\nChristine performs 120 concerts per year in a career that continues to take her all over the U.S., Canada and Australia, singing songs and telling stories, and twirling glowing batons on-stage. She most recently incorporated a digital phrase sampler into her live concert, enabling her to create spontaneously improvised lyrics and intricate vocal harmonies.\n\nTickets for Christine Lavin are $16; students, $8. For ticket information, call (618) 650-5555, or, from St. Louis toll-free, (888) 328-5168, Ext. 5555; write: Arts & Issues, SIUE, Edwardsville, IL 62026-1083; or by e-mail, kbollin@siue.edu.

As part of the grand opening, Chancellor David Werner will dedicate the course, followed by a Scramble Disc Golf Tournament sponsored by the Office of Campus Recreation.\n\nBringing a disc golf course-also known as Frisbee™ Gold - to SIUE was an idea of Werner's. \"Disc golf is one of those new 'cutting edge' recreational opportunities,\" he said. \"I am excited that we are able to make it available as part of our ongoing efforts to provide a vibrant and dynamic campus life for our students.\"\n\nWith the growing popularity of disc golf-there are more than 700 courses across the country-the sport has even gone pro with the creation of the Professional Disc Golf Association.\n\nIndividuals interested in participating in the Disc Golf Scramble Tournament may register, at no charge, at the Student Fitness Center or on the day of the event, as space permits.\n\nTo use the new course, students, faculty and staff need to show their ID at the Prairie Hall front desk to check out a set of golf discs and/or scorecards. There is no charge to check equipment out and individuals may use their own Frisbees to play.\n\nFor more information about the new disc golf course and its grand opening, call Chad Rodgers, assistant director of recreational programs, (618) 650-3242, or Shelly Wolfe, marketing coordinator for University Housing, (618) 650-4628.\n\nCougars Fall In Heartbreaker\n\nTampa scored 14 seconds into overtime and eliminated SIUE 2-1 from the semifinals of the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Tournament.\n\nKareem Escayg scored from 15 yards out just seconds into the extra period and dashed SIUE's hopes of winning a third national championship.\n\nThe Cougars completed the season with a 17-3-3 record with a run equaled since the Cougars advanced to the NCAA Division I semifinals in 1982.\n\nWith a picture remembrance of the 1979 national championship trophy safely guarding the bench, SIUE had taken the early lead as David Mwendapole scored from 15 yards out as he split defenders and accepted a pass from Yuzuru Takami at 13:44. \"The pass that Takami made was just incredible,\" Mwendapole said.\n\nTampa then went on the offensive by outshooting SIUE 12-5 in the game. The Spartans didn't tie the game until 86:55 when the team's leading scorer, Roy Fink, tied the game with a header that slipped past SIUE goalkeeper Matt Evers.\n\nEscayg came out blazing early in the overtime period and dashed past the SIUE defenders. \"He buried it. It was a good shot. It wasn't any kind of letdown in the defense,\" said SIUE's Evers.\n\nJustin McMillian, SIUE's leading scorer, was shut out by the Spartan defense. He said Tampa used an edge in the overtime. \"I certainly believe they had that play set up and it certainly worked,\" McMillian said.\n\nDelta State Fends Off Cougars\n\nSIUE men's basketball came back from double-digit deficits in both halves but fell to Delta State 68-65 Tuesday night (11/20) at the Vadalabene Center.\n\nGarrett Thomas was the highlight for SIUE as he recorded a Cougar-record nine three-pointers. The previous record was held by Matt Fridley (1993-94).\n\nSIUE, 1-1, fell behind by 17 points in the first half after being outscored 20-3 in the first 10 minutes of the game. The Cougars clawed their way back by halftime and exchanged leads with less than a minute to play in the half. Delta State led going into halftime 37-36.\n\nThe second half was much the same as SIUE fell 14 points behind only to come back. The Cougars cut the lead to two at 67-65 as Tim Bauersachs notched a layup.\n\nRod Newton hit a free throw for Delta State with seven seconds left, but a final effort by Thomas to hit his 10th three-pointer of the night fell just short with one second left.\n\nSIUE now enters Great Lakes Valley Conference play on Saturday (11/24) as it plays host to Bellarmine University. Game time is set for 7:30 p.m.\n\nCougars Overpower McKendree\n\nRuth Kipping recorded her first double-double in a Cougar uniform as SIUE powered past McKendree 80-57 Tuesday night at the Vadalabene Center.\n\nSIUE improved to 1-2 overall. McKendree evened its record to 4-4.\n\nKipping poured in 22 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead all scorers. Megan Grizzle picked up 13 points. Heather Hillebrenner added 10 points off the bench.\n\nJacque Clark, the sister of SIUE assistant coach Misi Clark, was the leading scorer for McKendree with 12 points. Stephanie Sparks added 11 points for the Bearcats.\n\nSIUE led by just four points at 37-33 at halftime. The Cougars turned up the pressure in the second half, playing strong defense and outstanding offense. SIUE shot 62.5 percent from the field and held McKendree to 32 percent shooting.\n\nThe Cougars' next action is Saturday (11/24) when they host Great Lakes Valley Conference rival Bellarmine University in a 5:30 p.m. game.\n\nAll Roads Lead To Tampa\n\nThe SIUE men's soccer team travels to Tampa, Fla., the site chosen Monday morning (11/19) by the NCAA to be the host for the final four of the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championships on Nov. 30-Dec. 2.\n\nThe Cougars face host Tampa at 8 p.m. Nov. 30; Cal State-Dominguez Hills faces Dowling in the other semifinal at 6 p.m. on the same day. Winners advance to the championship game on Dec. 2 at 1 p.m.\n\nThis will be the first meeting between SIUE and Tampa. It also would be the first time SIUE would play either Cal State Dominguez Hills or Dowling.\n\nSIUE, ranked No. 10 in the nation in the final NSCA/NCAA Division II poll, advanced Saturday (11/17) by defeating Ashland 1-0 at Ralph Korte Stadium. Justin McMillian (Granite City) scored his team-leading 16th goal of the season on a quick pass from Chris Knopp (St. Louis) for the game-winner.\n\nSIUE brings a team into the final four which has not allowed a goal in two NCAA games. Matt Evers (Edwardsville) has recorded six saves in the two games. He lowered his season goals against average to 0.92.\n\nNCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championships at Tampa, Fla.\n\n• Fri., Nov. 30-Cal State-Dominguez Hills (19-2-1) vs. Dowling (15-0-3), 6 p.m. EST\n\n• SIU Edwardsville (17-2-3) at Tampa (17-0-2), 8 p.m. EST\n\n• Sun., Dec. 2 Championship Game, 1 p.m. EST\n\nFinally Final Four\n\nThe Cougars were able to hold their own in the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championships, defeating Ashland 1-0 at Ralph Korte Stadium.\n\nThe Cougars, 17-2-3, are now in the final four and are waiting to find out who their next competitors will be and where they will be playing on Nov. 30. Ashland completed its season 12-5-1.\n\nThe Cougars put their goal on the board at 63:18. Justin McMillian (Granite City), SIUE's senior forward, scored his team-leading 16th goal of the season. Chris Knopp (St. Louis) assisted on the goal with a crisp pass to McMillian, who scored from 10 yards out.\n\n\"There was not too much done on my part,\" said Knopp. \"I just got the ball to his (McMillian's) foot.\"\n\n\"It was just the perfect opportunity,\" said McMillian. \"The ball was set up perfectly so I just tucked it away in the corner of the goal.\"\n\nSIUE Coach Ed Huneke gave a great deal of credit to the Cougars' defense. \"We were under a lot of pressure,\" said Huneke.\n\nGoalkeeper Matt Evers (Edwardsville) was able to hold off the advances and collected three saves. \"I relied on my defense a lot this game,\" said Evers. \"There were times when there were bodies everywhere and they played tight defense in clutch situations.\"\n\nThe victory was definitely a team effort according to Knopp. \"It was a nice reward after all of the hard work we put in this year,\" said Knopp.\n\nAll SIUE can do now is just sit and wait until Sunday evening (11/25) when the Cougars find out who wins the Lander/Tampa game. All three of the other semifinals game are scheduled for Sunday. \"It would be nice to play in Edwardsville in front of our friends and families,\" said McMillian. \"But we'd be happy to get on a plane and fly somewhere too.\"\n\nNCAA-II Tournament (in bracket order)\n\n• Cal State-Dominguez Hills (18-2-1) at West Texas A&M (15-3-1), Sun., Nov. 18, 1 p.m.\n\n• Dowling (14-0-3) at Southern Connecticut State (17-3-2), Sun., Nov. 18, 1 p.m.\n\n• Lander (16-3) at Tampa (16-0-2), Sun., Nov. 18, 1 p.m. at SIU Edwardsville 1 Ashland 0\n\nSIUE Men's Soccer Advances To Final Eight\n\nDespite how exciting and thrilling Sunday's 2-0 victory over Lewis was for the men's soccer team, it's now time to look ahead.\n\nCoach Ed Huneke gave his players Monday off and will return to the practice field Tuesday afternoon to prepare for Saturday's (11/17) home NCAA Tournament game against Ashland University. Game time is set for 1 p.m. This is the farthest SIUE has advanced into the postseason since the 1982 season when the Cougars lost in their third NCAA Tournament game of that year, 1-0, to eventual champion Indiana.\n\nThe Cougars are now 16-2-3 overall and face Ashland, which defeated Mercyhurst 2-1 in its first-round game. Ashland comes into the game with a record of 12-4-1. Both teams were No. 2 seeds and won road games. This time, SIUE has the home field advantage.\n\n\"The main thing is that we don't linger too long on the Lewis victory,\" Huneke said. \"We have to realize we have a task ahead that will be as challenging as what we just accomplished.\"\n\nThe Cougars are closing in on the scoring record set by the 1997 team which advanced to the NCAA Tournament. In 1997, SIUE scored 64 goals. This season, the Cougars have 63 goals and counting.\n\nJustin McMillian (Granite City) continued to provide leadership for the Cougars. The Great Lakes Valley Conference's Player of the Year picked up assists on both goals against Lewis and leads the GLVC in scoring with 15 goals and eight assists. Brian Douglas (Centerville, Ohio) scored his third goal of the season on Sunday (11/11) as the eventual game-winner. He scored after two quick passes inside the 18-yard mark from McMillian and Ryan Stoddart (Springfield). Justin Huneke (Granite City) scored the goal with about 90 seconds remaining to retire the Flyers from postseason play.\n\nThe first 500 students who come to the Office of Intercollegiate Athletics and show a valid student ID can receive a free ticket to Saturday's 1 p.m. NCAA game against Ashland. Regular tickets will be available at the gate. The cost is $5 for the general public and $3 for students.\n\nNCAA-II Tournament (in bracket order)\n\n• Cal State-Dominguez Hills (18-2-1) at West Texas A&M (15-3-1), Sun., Nov. 18, 1 p.m.\n\n• Dowling (14-0-3) at Southern Connecticut State (17-3-2), Sun., Nov. 18, 1 p.m.\n\n• Lander (16-3) at Tampa (16-0-2), Sat., Nov. 17, 1 p.m.\n\n• Ashland (12-4-1) at SIU Edwardsville (16-2-3), Sat., Nov. 17, 1 p.m.\n\nSIUE Men's Soccer in NCAA Tournament (23-13)\n\n1969\n\nSaint Louis 4 SIUE 0\n\n1970\n\nSIUE 6 Cleveland State 0\n\nSaint Louis 2 SIUE 1\n\n1971\n\nSIUE 2 Akron 0\n\nSaint Louis 3 SIUE 1\n\n1972 (National Champions)\n\nSIUE 3 Akron 2\n\nSIUE 4 Baltimore 1\n\nSIUE 1 Oneonta 0\n\n1973\n\nSIUE 3 Northern Illinois 0\n\nSaint Louis 3 SIUE 0\n\n1974\n\nSIUE 2 Indiana 0\n\nSaint Louis 2 SIUE 1 (3 OT)\n\n1975 (Runner-Up)\n\nSIUE 3 Cleveland State 2\n\nSIUE 2 Saint Louis 1\n\nSIUE 3 Howard 1\n\nSan Francisco 4 SIUE 0\n\n1976\n\nSIUE 1 Saint Louis 0\n\nIndiana 1 SIUE 0\n\n1977\n\nSIUE 3 Indiana 2 (OT)\n\nSIUE 3 Cleveland State 2 (OT)\n\nSan Francisco 2 SIUE 1 (OT)\n\nSIUE 3 Brown 2\n\n1978\n\nSIUE 3 Saint Louis 2 (3 OT)\n\nIndiana 2 SIUE 0\n\n1979 (National Champions)\n\nSIUE 2 Saint Louis 1\n\nSIUE 2 Southern Methodist 1\n\nSIUE 4 San Francisco 0\n\nSIUE 2 Penn State 1\n\nSIUE 3 Clemson 2\n\n1980\n\nSouthern Methodist 2 SIUE 0\n\n1981\n\nEastern Illinois 2 SIUE 1\n\n1982\n\nSIUE 1 North Texas State 0\n\nSIUE 1 San Francisco 0\n\nIndiana 1 SIUE 0\n\n1997\n\nTruman State 2 SIUE 1\n\n2001\n\nSIUE 2 Lewis 0\n\nSIUE was \"small college\" for 1972 national championship and NCAA Division I for title in 1979. SIUE went back to NCAA Division II when joining the Great Lakes Valley Conference in 1995.\n\nMen's Basketball Opens With Monmouth\n\nOf the 89-77 loss at Bradley (11/10) is any indication of how the men's basketball team is going to play this season, SIUE's opponents had better think about defending the three-pointer.\n\nSIUE hit a Carver Arena record 15 three-pointers and took 37 total for the game. SIUE was even with the Missouri Valley Conference Bradley Braves with eight minutes to go and down by just two with four minutes to play.\n\nSIUE Coach Jack Margenthaler said he was a little disappointed the Cougars played 36 strong minutes and then had four minutes of weakness at the end of the game. \"In the last four minutes, I felt we lost our poise and weren't disciplined,\" Margenthaler said.\n\nSIUE begins the 2001-2002 season against Monmouth College on Saturday (11/7) at 7 p.m. Margenthaler said he expects Monmouth to use its experience as a catalyst for going after the Cougars. \"They'll come in and give us some good, hard basketball,\" he said.\n\nCougar fans shouldn't expect SIUE to put on the same type of display of three-point shooting the rest of the season. Much of that was the type of defense Bradley plays and the hot hands of Marty Perry (Jacksonville), Garrett Thomas (Riverton), Derrick Fomby (Hazel Crest) and Rob Baumgardner (Madisonville, Ky.). \"I don't want this team to think we can do that night in and night out,\" Margenthaler added.\n\nThe Cougars showed some good poise for a team which hasn't played together much. \"We had excellent effort (against Bradley). We didn't seem to be intimidated,\" Margenthaler said.\n\nCougar Women's Basketball Heads To CMSU\n\nThe SIUE women's basketball team opens its season at the Central Missouri State Tournament on Saturday (11/17) against the host school at 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe Cougars play a CMSU team which already has played three regular season games at the Disney Classic in Orlando, Fla. CMSU lost to Columbus State but came back for wins over Fort Valley State and Nebraska-Omaha. Drury and Fort Hays State are the other two teams in the tournament. SIUE faces one of the two on Sunday (11/18) in either the third-place game at 5:30 p.m. or the championship game at 7:30 p.m.\n\nSIUE Coach Wendy Hedberg said she saw some positives and negatives in her team's exhibition game last Friday (11/9) at Southeast Missouri State. \"We played with some intensity which I was happy to see,\" said Hedberg.\n\nThe Cougars picked up 29 points from junior Ruth Kipping (Quincy). Jessica Robert (Carlyle) added 15 points while Amanda Buldtman (Metropolis) added 11.\n\nHedberg said she played several different combinations to see which players felt comfortable with one another. The Cougar mentor said she also was looking for team weaknesses as well as strengths. Rebounding was a weakness against SEMO, which had more offensive rebounds in the first half than SIUE had for the game. \"That's something that can be corrected,\" said Hedberg.\n\nOctober 2001\n\nSON And LCCC Set To Launch New Program\n\nThe School of Nursing, in cooperation with Lewis and Clark Community College, is set to launch a \"2 Plus 2 RN to BS Program\" in the fall 2002. The curriculum will facilitate LCCC nursing program students' efforts to pursue a baccalaureate in nursing upon completion of their associate's degree at the Godfrey, Ill., college.\n\n\"This is a plus, plus, plus for everyone,\" Nursing Dean Felissa Lashley said. \"At a time when the medical field is suffering a shortage of qualified nurses, the program will help create greater educational opportunities for a wide range of nursing students. As the only four-year public nursing program south of Interstate 74, SIUE has a statewide mandate to provide access to nursing education in Southern Illinois.\"\n\nThe part-time program strives to meet the needs of working registered nurses who wish to advance from an associate degree to a bachelor of science. The RN to BS program offers most of its classes in the evening to meet the needs of working RNs.\n\n\"We are so pleased and excited about this joint venture,\" said Donna Meyer, LCCC nursing program coordinator.\n\n\"This opportunity supports Lewis and Clark Community College's mission of advancing lifelong learning,\" Meyer said. \"Working together with SIUE, we have developed a curriculum here for our associate degree students that is a seamless fit with the advanced courses that will be offered at SIUE.\"\n\nMeyer said that approximately 82 percent of the graduates of LCCC's nursing program continue to pursue their education beyond their associate's degree.\n\nWith the advanced coursework offered at SIUE, LCCC students will utilize the University's state-of-the-art psychomotor skills lab and its computerized human patient simulator. SIUE's School of Nursing is the only baccalaureate nursing program in the Midwest that offers the patient simulator experience.\n\nDiscussions about the \"2 Plus 2 RN to BS Program\" between the two schools began more than a year ago. A graduate of SIUE's School of Nursing, Meyer found the staff of the LCCC nursing program to be very supportive of the concept.\n\nFor additional program and admission information, contact either SIUE's southern region academic advisor, (618) 650-3904 (toll-free at 800 234-4844) or Donna Meyer, (618) 468-4436.\n\nESLHEC Closer To Reality With Groundbreaking\n\nRenovations at the East St. Louis Higher Education Center (ESLHEC) moved a step closer to reality last week with the center's official groundbreaking.\n\nFour buildings will be renovated and two new buildings will be built on the site at 601 James R. Thompson Blvd., two blocks from the intersection of Broadway and Eighth in East St. Louis. The complex will house East St. Louis Community College Center, SIUE's East St. Louis Center, and the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES). A skills center, library, classroom, and administration building will be used jointly by the community college center and the SIUE East St. Louis Center.\n\nThe $27.2 million project is funded by the state; construction will begin in October and will be carried out in four phases, with a projected completion date of May 2003. In funding the project, Gov. George Ryan envisioned the ESLHEC as a \"one-stop location\" for education and workforce training in East St. Louis.\n\nJoe Cipfl, president/chief executive officer of the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) said the idea is to make it easier for local residents to gain access to higher education and potential job opportunities. \"This integrated facility will serve as a model of partnership between higher education and state government,\" Cipfl said.\n\n\"The ESLHEC combines programs currently offered at three separate sites. Community college courses will be offered here, assistance in training and finding jobs will be provided by IDES, and the SIUE East St. Louis Center offers a variety of child care, education, and health services.\"\n\nEast St. Louis Center Director Pat Harrison said the SIUE facility will continue to administer its award-winning programs at the new site. \"Among the many quality programs, the SIUE East St. Louis Center houses a nationally recognized Head Start program, the Upward Bound project, the Talent Search program, and operates a charter school as well as several health care-related programs that provide services to the community.\"\n\nSIUE is responsible for operations and maintenance oversight at the ESLHEC. \"We have many good programs at the East St. Louis Center,\" Chancellor David Werner said. \"Now we will finally have a facility that is as good as the programs, and as good as any you will find on the Edwardsville campus.\"\n\nThe project will be carried out in four phases. Phases One and Two involve the renovation of the existing community college facilities, a total of about 128,000 square feet. Phase Three is the IDES building, about 12,000 square feet. A building exclusively for SIUE, about 50,000 square feet, will be completed in the fourth phase.\n\nAdministrative officials ICCB, IDES and SIUE, were joined at the groundbreaking by area legislators from Madison and St. Clair counties, representatives from the city of East St. Louis, regional administrators from the Capital Development Board, Korte Construction (the general contractor), and Woolpert Architects.\n\n'CougarDocs' Under Way; Imaging System In Place\n\nA file cabinet can contain as much as 20,000 pieces of paper and, at last count, SIUE had about 500 of these four-drawered receptacles in campus inventory. Do the math. That's a lot of paper and a lot of space taken up by heavy metal.\n\nIt's quite a task-management of myriad organizational records created by hundreds of administrators, faculty, and staff, as well as thousands of students. And, to make that task more efficient and to supplement its long-standing records management policies, the university has implemented a new digital document imaging and management system affectionately dubbed \"CougarDocs.\"\n\nBob Vanzo, director of Administrative Services, said the university carefully selected a digital document imaging system that has expansion capabilities campus-wide. \"After two years of investigating, planning, reviewing, obtaining funds, selecting a product, and training, we have begun the imaging process in the Office of Admissions and the Office of the Registrar,\" Vanzo said.\n\n\"The university's Imaging Task Force determined that the project would be phased in, beginning with operational areas in which the new system would have the greatest positive impact on service to students,\" he said. \"Admissions receives the greatest volume of paper subsequently shared with more units than any other on campus.\"\n\nVanzo, who is chair of the task force, said \"industrial strength\" scanners have been purchased to make digital copies of student transcripts, admissions records, and other documents that can add up to 20 or more pieces of paper in a student's file. In addition, the SIUE Office of Records Management is using the scanners to make electronic images of historic student transcripts and files that date back to the 1950s.\n\nChrista Oxford, assistant vice chancellor for Enrollment Management and Registrar, and a member of the task force, said the CougarDocs system already has improved access to needed documents. \"Before implementation of this imaging system, employees would photocopy each document in a new freshman's file and that file copy would then be hand-carried to academic counselors who advise incoming students,\" Oxford explained.\n\n\"Now, that same file is available as electronic images that can be called up immediately on the counselor's computer during the advising process.\" Oxford said the time lag between a counselor's request for a student's file and receipt of the file has been eliminated. \"This means advisors are able to provide better service to students, even when the Admissions office isn't open to search for and to photocopy files,\" she said.\n\n\"We are doing more with less and, as our enrollment continues to grow, this system may enable us to use resources for direct service to our students, rather than buying more file cabinets, paper, and photocopying machines.\"\n\nVanzo said the Office of Student Financial Aid is currently involved in the training process and will be the next unit to become part of the imaging network. \"The task force determines which units will join the project by assessing the greatest impact on university operations,\" he said. \"After Financial Aid is up and running, we will phase in Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Bursar, Instructional Services, and Human Resources. We hope these additional units will be on-line by the end of Fiscal Year 2002.\"\n\nVanzo pointed out SIUE is one of only a very few U.S. universities and colleges that has taken a systematic approach campus-wide to digital document imaging. \"Most of the universities we contacted, or visited, used some sort of document imaging but they were implemented piecemeal,\" he said. \"In other words, several units on a campus are using different software products that cannot be integrated. That's not very efficient, in our view.\n\n\"So, we're taking an 'enterprise' approach,\" he said. \"We are networking this digital document imaging system throughout campus, which we believe will make for more efficient operation and maintenance.\"\n\nVanzo said the first-year cost for the program, which began in spring, was $281,000. That cost included software licensing, equipment, training, and salaries for employees dedicated to imaging millions of pages of historical documents. \"Our reasons for implementing CougarDocs were to enhance our services, to make our operations more efficient, and to update and strengthen our existing records management capabilities, thus making an investment in the university's future.\"\n\nFewer Than 50 Tickets Remain For A&I's Presentation Of Frogz On October 17\n\nFewer than 50 tickets remain for the Oct. 17 return visit of IMAGO Theatre's presentation of Frogz, as part of SIUE's Arts & Issues series.\n\nThe event is \"creature theater\" at its best, staged with ingenious masks, mesmerizing movement, outlandish costumes, and finger-snapping music to create a carnival of the absurd. IMAGO creatively blends movement and dance, with a few escaped penguins, silent sloths, anf finicky frogs thrown in.\n\nTickets are $16; students, $8. For ticket information, call (618) 650-5555, or, from St. Louis toll-free, (888) 328-5168, Ext. 5555; write: Arts & Issues, SIUE, Edwardsville, IL 62026-1083; or by e-mail, rwalker@siue.edu. Admission includes free parking in the lots behind the Morris University Center or Dunham Hall theater.\n\nTickets also are still available for the Nov. 9 Arts & Issues presentation of Lech Walesa, the first democratically elected president of Poland. Tickets are $8; students, $4. Subsequent Arts & Issues presentations for this season may be viewed on the Web site.\n\nPREVIEW SIUE Set For Oct. 8; Families On Campus\n\nOn Monday, Oct. 8, we pay tribute to one of the world's greatest explorers with Columbus Day. But a different kind of explorer-and an anticipated 900 of them-will be charting a course for Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\n\nHigh school students and their parents will explore the campus and visit with faculty, staff, and students during \"Preview SIUE,\" the University's annual open house. The event, based in the Morris University Center, is open to community college and potential transfer students as well.\n\n\"This has always been a great opportunity for students and their families to experience first-hand the SIUE experience,\" said Boyd Bradshaw, director of admissions. \"Not only will they have the chance to interact with faculty, staff and students, but they'll be able to learn about campus life, student services, and visit academic departments. In addition to tours of the central campus, our three residence halls and the Cougar Village apartments will be open for our visitors to see.\"\n\nRegistration begins at 8 a.m. in the MC. The SIUE Information Fair, with exhibits by academic departments and student services departments, opens at 8:30 a.m. A 9 a.m. opening session in Meridian Ballroom leads off the day with a wide variety of session options and tours to follow.\n\nAvailable sessions include an overview of SIUE's academic programs, \"Emerging Careers,\" \"SIUE: The Place To Be,\" \"Countdown to SIUE\", \"Financing Your Education at SIUE,\" and sessions with the University's schools of business, education, engineering and nursing.\n\nCampus and residence hall tours continue until 1:30 p.m. while programming for the day runs until 2:30 p.m. Campus offices will be open for students to visit through 4:30 p.m. Parking for \"Preview SIUE\" is available in Lots B and E on the west side of the campus.\n\nFor more information, call 800/447-SIUE, e-mail to admis@siue.edu, or visit the \"Preview SIUE\" Web site at www.admis.siue.edu/preview.\n\nMidnight Madness Returns To The Vadalabene Center\n\nIt's almost here. The official start of the 2001-2002 basketball season. SIUE prepares to kick off the season with Midnight Madness on Sunday (10/14) at the Vadalabene Center. Festivities begin at 11 p.m. with the one-hour practice beginning at midnight.\n\nStudents will have at least four opportunities to win $10,000 throughout the night. One student will walk away with free tuition for the semester. There also will be free \"Red Zone\" T-shirts to the first 500 students with a valid ID. SIUE faculty, staff and the community also are invited to take part in free activities.\n\nThe 2001-2002 Cougar players and coaches will be present to\n\ninteract with fans all night. There will be free Papa John's pizza and soda. At the stroke of midnight, both the men's and women's basketball teams will be introduced to the fans followed by a 60-minute practice. Oct. 15th is the first official day of practice for NCAA basketball players.\n\nFor more information about Cougar Basketball, visit the SIUE Athletics Web site.\n\nWomen's Tennis Earns No. 3 Seed For GLVC Tournament\n\nWomen's tennis, which earned the No. 3 seed for this week's Great Lakes Valley Conference Tournament, faces No.6-seeded Quincy University in the first round.\n\nCoach Bill Logan said he thinks the Cougars can go far if the team applies some extra effort. \"We're looking forward to facing Quincy,\" said Logan. \"All of our players are healthy and playing well right now.\"\n\nThe Cougars did not play up to expectations at this past weekend's Intercollegiate Tennis Association's regional tournament in Indianapolis. All five of SIUE's entries lost in the first round of the single-elimination tournament. The doubles teams finished a little better. The teams of Amber Stanley (Effingham) and Laura Zeeb (Greenville) as well as Coryn Reich (Newton) and Chrissy Yingst (Belleville) both won first-round matches but were later defeated in the second round.\n\nGLVC TOURNAMENT SCHEDULE\n\nOct. 12 (In bracket order)\n\nFirst/second rounds at Indianapolis North Central HS\n\n#1 Northern Kentucky vs. #8 Bellarmine\n\n#4 Lewis vs. #5 Indianapolis\n\n#3 SIU Edwardsville vs. #6 Quincy\n\n#2 Southern Indiana vs. #7 Missouri-St. Louis\n\nOct. 13\n\nFinal round at Indianapolis Ben Davis HS.\n\nSIUE Athletics Announces Charity Opportunity\n\nThe SIUE Athletic Department has announced a special event which will take place at Wednesday's (10/10) volleyball match against the University of Southern Indiana.\n\nSIUE Athletics and the SIUE Women's Studies Programs are asking fans to benefit the Oasis Women's Center, a shelter in Alton for victims of domestic violence. Fans are asked to bring a women's toiletry item to the 7 p.m. game and receive free admission.\n\nMen's Soccer Turns On Offense\n\nIt's been said 'You can't win if you don't score.' Winning and scoring certainly have not been problems for the SIUE men's soccer team.\n\nCoach Ed Huneke hasn't had an offense this potent since the 1997 season when the men's soccer Cougars scored a school-record 64 goals. This season, SIUE, ranked No. 23 in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America's NCAA-II poll, has 44 goals in 13 games.\n\nThe offense is led by seniors Justin McMillian (Granite City) and David Mwendapole (Kenya), who both enter this week's play with 25 points. \"That McMillian and Mwendapole combination has been good,\" said Huneke. \"It's just too much for a lot of teams to handle.\"\n\nMcMillian plays an aggressive midfield, pushing the ball forward with speed and quickness. Mwendapole has explosive speed and outstanding finishing moves. Huneke said that has allowed other players to enjoy offenseive success. Yuzuru Takami (Japan), Justin Huneke and Matthew Horan (St. Louis) all have scored more than 10 points this season.\n\nSIUE, 10-1-2 overall and 5-0-1 in the GLVC, has a crucial road trip this weekend at Northern Kentucky University and the University of Indianapolis. Both teams are above .500 in conference play and would like nothing better than to knock off a ranked team.\n\n\"I think we know from last year these are formidable opponents,\" said Huneke. \"Those close victories we had should be a good reminder that we need to be at our best.\"\n\nWomen's Soccer Cruises To Third Straight Win\n\nAfter scoring 11 goals in a win on Friday (10/5) against Kentucky Wesleyan, it was no surprise that the Cougars slowed down on Sunday 10/7). SIUE downed Bellarmine University 1-0 on Sunday and improved its season record to 9-1-1 overall and 4-1-1 in the GLVC.\n\nThe Cougars used a penalty kick by freshman Angela Light (St. Louis) to edge Bellarmine. On Friday, the SIUE offense scored 11 goals against Kentucky Wesleyan, the most since the Cougars scored 12 against Kentucky Wesleyan during the 1995 season.\n\nThe Cougars now face their most challenging opponent of the season on Friday (10/12) at 5:30 p.m. Northern Kentucky is ranked No. 1 in the nation by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). A win on the road against the nation's top team would give the Cougars some much-needed respect.\n\nSIUE is ranked seventh in the Great Lakes Region, according to the NSCAA. Northern Kentucky is ranked No. 1 in the region. Indianapolis, who SIUE faces on Sunday (10/14) at noon in Indianapolis, is fourth in the region.\n\nThe Cougars have outscored their opponents 31-6 after 11 games. The defense has been stabilized by the play of freshman goalkeeper Jessica Brown (St. Louis), Brown recorded 15 saves in the wins over Kentucky Wesleyan and Bellarmine.\n\nVolleyball Prepares for Cougar Classic\n\nWith an 11-10 overall record, Coach Todd Gober is focusing his efforts on trying to qualify for the NCAA Tournament in virtually the only way available-via the GLVC Tournament in November. \"We're looking at how we fit in the overall picture,\" said Gober.\n\nThe Cougars hold a 6-3 record in the GLVC, one match behind Green Division leader Southern Indiana. SIUE gets a chance to move into a tie for first in the division on Wednesday, meeting Southern Indiana at the Vadalabene Center. It will be the third meeting for the two teams with SIUE winning the first two.\n\nSIUE is one of the handful of GLVC teams playing this weekend. This is an off-week for GLVC volleyball matches. SIUE decided to use its off-week for the Cougar Classic at the Vadalabene Center on Friday and Saturday. The tournament features five Great Lakes Region teams. Along with SIUE, the tournament has Southern Indiana, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, Wheeling Jesuit College and the University of Charleston.\n\nGober said he's looking not only at what has worked so far this season but also what needs to be improved. \"We've been serving and blocking real well. We have spells where we hit well,\" said Gober. \"The things we need to shore up are in ball control and floor defense.\"\n\nAndrea Voss (St. Rose) is second in the GLVC in blocks with 1.25 per game. Stephanie Trame (Highland) is fourth in the GLVC with exactly 1.00 blocks per game.\n\nCougar Classic Schedule\n\nOct. 12\n\nSouthern Indiana vs. Charleston, 5 p.m.\n\nMissouri-St. Louis vs. Wheeling Jesuit, 5 p.m.\n\nSIU Edwardsville vs. Charleston, 7 p.m.\n\nSouthern Indiana vs. Wheeling Jesuit, 7 p.m.\n\nOct. 13\n\nSouthern Indiana vs. Charleston, 11 a.m.\n\nMissouri-St. Louis vs. Wheeling Jesuit, 11 a.m.\n\nSIU Edwardsville vs. Wheeling Jesuit, 1 p.m.\n\nMissouri-St. Louis vs. Charleston, 1 p.m.\n\nSIUE Athletics Announces Charity Opportunities\n\nIntercollegiate Athletics has announced several special events which will take place at upcoming Cougar soccer and volleyball matches.\n\nOn Friday and Sunday (10/5 & 10/7), the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee will sponsor a canned food drive. Bring one canned food item and get into the women and men's soccer game free. The soccer Cougars face Kentucky Wesleyan College on\n\nFriday. The women's game begins at 5:30 p.m. and the men's game is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. On Sunday, SIUE meets Bellarmine. The women will start at noon and the men will play at 2:30 p.m.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oct. 10, SIUE Athletics and the SIUE Women's Studies Programs are asking fans to support the Oasis Women's Center, a shelter in Alton for victims of domestic violence. Fans are asked to bring a women's toiletry item to the 7 p.m. game against the University of Southern Indiana and receive free admission.\n\nSIUE Women's Soccer Working Overtime\n\nIt took double overtime for the women's soccer team to defeat the University of Southern Indiana on Sunday (9/30) 2-1 on a goal by Sara Decker (St. Louis). Coach Brian Korbesmeyer hopes this week's matches with Kentucky Wesleyan College and Bellarmine University are not as lengthy and less stressful.\n\nThe Cougars head into this weekend with a 7-1-2 overall record and a 2-1-1 record in the GLVC. SIUE will host Kentucky Wesleyan on Friday (10/5) at 5:30 p.m. The Cougars play Bellarmine at noon Sunday (10/7).\n\nKorbesmeyer credited team depth for the win over Southern Indiana. The team was able to use five subtitutions in the first half and four in the second, while Southern Indiana only had three players available to use as substitutions. \"We are always in the game because of our depth,\" said Korbesmeyer. \"We always use our starters at the end to finish off the game because they are still fresh.\"\n\nDecker headed the ball in the net at 108:14 on a pass from Colleen Creamer (St. Louis). SIUE scored first in the game as Heather Bebe (Florissant, Mo.) scored from five yards out on an assist from Creamer.\n\nWomen's Tennis Travel to ITA Championships\n\nWomen's tennis head into post season play with a 7-2 record. The Cougars travel to Indianapolis for the ITA Mid-American Championships this weekend. This tournament helps determine the regional rankings for the teams.\n\nSIUE also will have to wait to find out who its first-round opponent will be for the GLVC Tournament in Indianapolis on Oct. 13-14. The Cougars are the No. 3 seed behind Northern Kentucky University and Southern Indiana. The fourth, fifth and sixth seeds will be determined by coin flip later this week between the University of Indianapolis, Lewis University and Quincy University. The University of Missouri-St. Louis and Bellarmine round out the GLVC Tournament field as the No. 7 and No. 8 seeds.\n\nThe Cougars are coming off a very hectic weekend. SIUE defeated Bellarmine 8-1 on Friday (9/28). On Saturday (9/29), the Cougars downed Indianapolis 5-4 in the morning and lost to Northern Kentucky 7-2 in the afternoon. \"Indianapolis was a very good team, and it was a tough match for us,\" said Coach Bill Logan.\n\nKeli Keener (Bethalto) was able to pull off a very important victory when the match was tied 4-4, according to Logan. Northern Kentucky has been the GLVC's dominant team for the last four years. SIUE got off to an early 2-1 lead after winning two of the three doubles matches but could not hold off NKU.\n\n\"I am happy because our doubles play still looks very good,\" said Logan. \"Last week's performance showed promise and was a good warm up,\" said Logan. \"Hopefully we will do as well this weekend.\"\n\nHuneke Pleased With Cougars' Play\n\nMen's soccer coach Ed Huneke can only smile. His team, ranked 23rd in the nation according to the latest National Soccer Coaches Association NCAA Division II poll, is continuing to have success against GLVC rivals.\n\nThe Cougars' GLVC record now stands at 3-0-1 with the overall record standing 7-1-2. \"Things are starting to fall into place,\" said Huneke.\n\nSIUE faces Kentucky Wesleyan on Friday (10/5) at 7:30 p.m. and Bellarmine on Sunday (10/7) at 2:30 p.m. at home this weekend. Kentucky Wesleyan is 0-5-0 in the GLVC and Bellarmine has a conference record of 1-3-0. \"Right now we just need to avoid upsets,\" said Huneke. \"If we do that we will go far.\"\n\nSIUE defeated Southern Indiana 4-1 on Sunday. Justin McMillian (Granite City) scored two of the four SIUE goals, including the eventual game-winner. David Mwendapole (Kenya) contributed a goal and an assist. The final goal scored was scored by Josh Richardson (Mt. Vernon, Ind.) and was assisted by Kevin Corrigan (St. Louis).\n\n\"We played decently, but it was not one of our better games despite the 4-1 score,\" said Huneke. Mwendapole played very well and deserves some recognition, said Huneke. \"Mwendapole's speed and pursuit of the goal gives a nice dimension to the attack and makes life easier for the rest of the forwards,\" said Huneke.\n\nVolleyball: Short-Lived Stay On Top\n\nSIUE's volleyball team was forced off their cloud this past weekend. The Cougars, who were in first place in the GLVC's Green Division, now have a 5-2 GLVC record and a 10-9 overall record after falling at Wisconsin-Parkside and Lewis.\n\nThe Cougars play at Quincy University on Friday (10/5) and then at the University of Missouri-St. Louis on Saturday (10/6). Quincy is 1-4 in GLVC play. UM-St. Louis has a conference record of 2-4. SIUE has defeated both of these teams at home, but SIUE volleyball Coach Todd Gober believes that they are playing better now than they were earlier in the season.\n\nSIUE fell to UW-Parkside on Friday (9/28) 3-1. Then Cougars were defeated by Lewis, who is 5-0 in conference play, 3-1 on Saturday (9/29). \"It was a frustrating weekend,\" said Gober. The loss to UW-Parkside was more upsetting because the Cougars play was flat and emotionless, according to Gober. SIUE hit better in the match with Lewis, Gober said. \"Jenny Franklin (LaSalle) had a big game against Lewis,\" said Gober. Franklin had 14 digs and 12 kills.\n\nCross Country Readies For Border States Invitational\n\nCross country is getting ready for another meet at home this weekend. The Border States Invitational will be held at the SIUE cross country course Saturday (10/6). The women's race will start at 10 a.m. The men will run at 10:45 a.m.\n\nSIUE co-hosted the Cougar/Bearcat Challenge with McKendree College on Saturday (9/28). The Cougars took first place out of four in the men's event and first out of three in the women's race.\n\nSIUE swept the top four places in the women's 5,000-meter race. Amanda Bozue (Joliet) finished first with a time of 19 minutes, 21.3 seconds. Breanne Steffens (Moline) finished second (19:24.60), Mary Witte (Normal) was third (19:47.30), and Carrie Carducci (Powell, Ohio) was forth (20:34.60).\n\nThe men were successful as well. Nine Cougars finished in the top 10. The first Cougar to finish was Tyler Krauss (Freeburg). Krauss finished second (26:41.30) behind Chris Walker (26:39.70) who ran unattached. Jason Olszowka (Lockport) (26:54.90), Ryan Boyll (Normal) (27:14.30), and David Owens (DeSoto, Mo.) (27:19.40) all finished in the top five.\n\nGLVC Tournament Upcoming For Women's Golf\n\nWomen's golf Coach Larry Bennett is very optimistic about the future. The Cougars will play in the GLVC tournament on Oct. 7-8 at Timbergate Golf Club in Edinburgh, Ind.\n\nBennett, however, added a new twist to the schedule. The Cougars play at McKendree College on Thursday against McKendree and William Woods College. Bennett felt that it was important to add another match before the GLVC Tournament because the last match they played was on Sept. 22-23 in the Illinois Wesleyan Invitational.\n\nBennett is still shaping his lineup for the GLVC Tournament. Two of SIUE's players have guaranteed their spots for the GLVC tournament and the rest of the players currently are playing in qualifying rounds. Katie Farrell (Princeton) and Deanna Bock (Edwardsville) hold scoring averages of 83.4 and 84.5, respectively. The duo set a school record for 36 holes at the Illinois Wesleyan Tournament with a 156 score. Farrell set the 18-hole record at 75.\n\n\"There is no reason why we could not win (the GLVC Tournament), but realistically we are aiming for the top four,\" said Bennett. \"Anything below that would disappoint the women and myself.\"\n\nOctober 16, 2001\n\nNew SIUE Athletics Logo Intro'd At Midnight Madness\n\nJust as SIUE showed off it 2001-2002 basketball teams this past Sunday night at Midnight Madness, university officials also had another introduction in store.\n\nIntercollegiate Athletics revealed a new Cougar logo Sunday evening, announced director of Athletics Cindy Jones. The first 500 students who showed a valid SIUE ID Sunday night at Midnight Madness received a T-shirt with the new Cougar logo.\n\n\"It is time for a new identity,\" Jones said. \"We had players and coaches who desired a logo which was more alive and would create some energy and excitement.\" Jones said the logo change also reflects the University's movement toward enhancing campus life and Athletics' move to becoming increasingly competitive in NCAA Division II intercollegiate sports.\n\nSIUE's University Graphics created the logo after a meeting earlier this year with the Athletics Department. \"The objective was to project an image that would reflect the winning attitude of the athletics department,\" said Greg Myers, director of University Graphics.\n\nMidnight Madness began at 11 p.m. Sunday at the Vadalabene Center, with members of the men's and women's basketball players and coaches on hand to mingle with students, faculty, staff, and fans. At midnight, the two teams were introduced and participated in their first official practice for the 2001-2002 season.\n\nRedmond, Oyelade Spoke At Center Training Day\n\nEugene Redmond, professor of English Language and Literature-as well as poet laureate of East St. Louis, best-selling author and award-winning lyricist-was the guest speaker for the Annual Training Day at the East St. Louis Center.\n\nChancellor David Werner also spoke at the training session. He commended the Center staff on its previous work record and recognized Center Director Patricia Harrison as an excellent manager who will guide her staff \"toward greater excellence in the new millennium.\"\n\nEditor of the university's multicultural literary journal Drum voices Revue, Redmond's topic was \"Saddling Drum voices & Riding the Soular System from the Basement to the Stars!\" in which he spoke of \"a poetry-punctuated, autobiographical 'souljourn' from the south end of East Saint Louis through the halls of higher Education-and the villages and capitals of the world.\" Redmond said he is on a pilgrimage of an \"accidental\" academician who never lost sight of home, \"self,\" or his \"debt\" to the cultural matrix that informed and formed him.\n\nAlso on the program was Remi Raji-Oyelade, a Nigerian scholar, poet, and a visiting faculty member in the SIUE English department. Both Redmond and Raji-Oyelade read samples of their work.\n\nDuring the training session, 20 East St. Louis Center employees were recognized for their outstanding work during the year. Employees receiving awards were Jamila Ajanaku, Doris Adams, Wanda Barber, Sandy Biver, Bernice Coleman, Venise Davis-Scott, Anitra Brown, Rosie Hurst, Renee' Smith, Maggie Rodgers, Debra Shepard, Bernice Wilson, Margene Jerrolds, Charles King, Barbara G. Williams, Loretta Haynes, Joann Tucker, Yvonne Jeffries, Vernell Nixon and Delois Jackson.\n\nThe training session, an annual event for staff development at the East St. Louis Center, offered 19 workshops. \"Education is the cornerstone foundation here at the East St. Louis Center,\" Harrison said. \"All year we are engaged in educating our clients in hopes of enriching their capabilities and expanding their possibilities.\n\n\"The Center has the same attitude when it comes to its staff. It's just as important that we remain knowledgeable in the area of our expertise.\"\n\n(r)Evolutionary (e)Books Exhibit Set For Oct. 20-23\n\nAn \"on-line happening\" is in store during an Art EAST exhibition, (r)Evolutionary (e)Books: the Electronic Artwork of William Harroff, to be shown from 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday through Tuesday, Oct. 20-23, at the Lewis and Clark Library System office, 425 Goshen Road, Edwardsville.\n\nCurated by Associate Professor Charlotte Johnson of Lovejoy Library, who calls herself an \"eBook evangelist in the current electronic book movement.\" The exhibit is billed as a \"cutting edge, 1960s-style on-line happening\" and will include a digital gallery, using computer monitors as frames to showcase electronic works from around the world.\n\n\"Many new digital book reading devices also will be available for adults to examine along with eBooks aimed at children and young adult readers,\" Johnson said. \"Dozens of William Harroff's 'bookworks' will be exhibited, including the premiere of several brand new works an an interactive 'Flipbook' of his award-winning artist amps.\"\n\nJohnson said the purpose of the event is to show the public what the future holds in electronic publishing. \"We hope they will never think of a book in the same way again,\" she said, \"and that they will realize the creative potential of the book in electronic form.\n\n\"Exhibited works will explore significant issues such as the evolution of books, literacy, preservation, the future of information delivery, digital rights management, and the redefinition of the reading, writing, and artmaking processes.\"\n\nAn hors d'oeuvres reception for the artists is scheduled from 5 to 8 p.m. Monday, Oct. 22, at the library system office.\n\nMIT Professor To Be The Ninth Shaw Lecturer\n\nMildred Dresselhaus, professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will be the featured speaker for the Ninth William C. Shaw Memorial Lecture on Oct. 17.\n\nScheduled in Room 3114 of the Science Building at 7:30 p.m., Dresselhaus will speak about \"Big Prospects for Small Science,\" presenting her perspectives on opportunities in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The presentation is co-sponsored by the Department of Physics and the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nReferred to as a \"solid-state physicist,\" Dresselhaus is one of 12 active Institute Professors at MIT. Joining the MIT faculty in 1960, she holds appointments in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and in the Department of Physics.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, Dresselhaus and a colleague organized the first Women's Forum at MIT as an annual seminar exploring the roles of women in science and engineering.\n\nShaw was a dedicated physicist and educator long associated with SIUE, where he was professor of Physics from 1959-1973 and professor emeritus until his death in 1977. After his death, Shaw's family and friends established the William C. Shaw Memorial Fund at SIUE, proceeds from which funded the construction of the Shaw Skylab on the north end of campus, used by students and keeping alive Shaw's love of teaching astronomy. The lecture series also is supported by the fund.\n\nAdmission to the Shaw Lecture is free but seating is limited. For more information, call the Department of Physics, (618) 650-2472.\n\nCougar Men's Soccer Sitting On Top\n\nThings could not be any better for the 11th-ranked men's soccer team. The Cougars earned the No. 1 seed for the GLVC Tournament and play host at Korte Stadium on Nov. 3 and 4.\n\nSIUE leads the GLVC with a conference record of 9-0-1 and an overall record of 14-1-2. The Cougars have completed their regular season conference schedule but still have one regular season game this Friday (10/26) playing at the University of Missouri-Rolla.\n\n\"It is important that we bounce back after last weekend,\" said Coach Ed Huneke. \"Right now we have great momentum and we want to keep that going.\" After that, it is on to the Great Lakes Valley Conference Tournament. SIUE will play the winner of the GLVC quarterfinal game between Northern Kentucky and Quincy on Saturday, Nov. 3, at noon. The championship game is set for Nov. 4 at 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe Cougars are coming off a very successful weekend. SIUE downed St. Joseph's 6-0 on Friday and edged the Wisconsin-Parkside 2-1 in double overtime on Sunday. Josh Richardson (Mt. Vernon, Ind.) scored two goals, and Cal Thomas (Rochester) did his part by contributing two assists in the win over St. Joseph's.\n\n\"The Parkside game was one of the biggest and most important games that have been played at Bob Guelker Field in years,\" said Huneke. \"The game had a lot of significance on our future this year and further on down the road.\"\n\nThe tie breaking shot came 106 minutes 54 seconds into the game. Senior, Justin McMillian (Granite City) scored a goal assisted by David Mwendapole from 2 yards out. \"It was a hard fought game that we were fortunate enough to win,\" said Huneke. \"It was a very emotional game, and we just need to get back into our focus for what is ahead.\"\n\nBasketball Schedules Red And White Scrimmage\n\nThe women's and men's basketball teams will show off their 2001-02 teams on Tuesday, Nov. 6. The women's scrimmage starts at 6 p.m. with the men to follow at 7 p.m.\n\nThe event is for Cougar Kids Club members and their families. Players will be available for autographs. There will be face painting and free hot dogs and soft drinks. For more information about joining the Cougar Kids Club, contact SIUE Athletics at (618) 650-2871.\n\nSeason Tickets Available For Cougar Basketball\n\nBasketball fans can secure the best seats to watch the Cougars by buying season tickets. Blue seats are available for $80 each.

For more information, contact the SIUE Athletics at (618) 650-2871.\n\nEnding On A Hard Note\n\nThe SIUE women's soccer team was not able to end the regular season on the positive note they desired. SIUE lost a pair of one-goal games to St. Joseph's 1-0 on Friday (10/19) and 2-1 to Wisconsin-Parkside on Sunday (10/21). The Cougars hold an overall record of 9-5-1.\n\nThe Cougars, who are sixth in the GLVC standings, begin postseason play on Oct. 31 at third-seeded Missouri-St. Louis. Game time is set for 7 p.m. at Don Dallas Field in St. Louis. The Cougars lost 2-1 to UMSL in their regular-season matchup on Sept. 23.\n\nDespite their losses, freshman goalkeeper Jessica Brown (St. Louis) was able to earn six saves last weekend. Angela Light (St. Louis) scored the lone goal of the weekend unassisted. Colleen Creamer (St. Louis) is the Cougars' leading goal scorer with six for the season. She was followed by Sara Decker (St. Louis) with five goals. Light and Lindsey Eubanks (Rochester) both have four for the season.\n\nFreshman Ann Crawford (St. Louis) leads the team in assists with six. Brown has 69 saves for the season.\n\nAthletics Announces Outstanding Student Athletes\n\nA pair of student-athletes named All-American more than once were named the Most Outstanding Athletes for the 2000-2001 in a halftime ceremony on Sunday (10/21).\n\nMisi Clark (Paris) and Mark Bugger (Edwardsville) accepted the female and male awards. Clark completed her four-year career by setting numerous career records and finishing with 2,164 points. Bugger broke the NCAA Division II record for hits with 257 in helping SIUE to a fifth-place finish at the NCAA-II Tournament.\n\nChad Opel (Edwardsville) and Rebecca Mays (Springfield) were introduced as the Sportsmanship Award winners. Opel, a member of the baseball team, and Mays, a member of the women's soccer team, were selected as student-athletes who displayed team leadership, significant contributions to the team's success, a good image on and off the competitive field and community service.\n\nDavid Mims (O'Fallon) and Amy Vandervinne (Moline) accepted the awards from the SIUE Alumni Association as the Scholar-Athletes. This award goes to the senior with the highest grade point average. Mims is a member of the men's tennis team. Vandervinne was a member of the SIUE softball team.\n\nThe Most Valuable Players, which were voted on by team members, were Carrie Carducci (Powell, Ohio) for women's cross country; Jason Olszowka (Lockport) for men's cross country; Sara Decker (St. Louis) for women's soccer; Nonie Ehlke (Highland) for women's golf; Brandon Gibbs (St. Charles, Mo.) for men's soccer; Lindsay Rust (Belleville) for volleyball; Nick Hartwig (South Wayne, Wis.) for men's basketball; Clark for women's basketball; Manny Herrera (Chicago) for wrestling; Missy Koenig (Mapleton) for softball; Amber Stanley (Effingham) and Kim Mulherin (Belleville) for women's tennis; Bret Giaudrone (Gillespie) for baseball; Dan Walden (Springfield) for men's track; and Sarah Turpin (Belleville) for women's track.\n\nPresenting the awards were Narbeth Emmanuel, vice chancellor for Student Affairs; John Meisel, faculty representative to the NCAA; Cindy Jones, director of Intercollegiate Athletics; and Martie Duffett, faculty academic advisor for athletics.\n\nSIUE baseball Coach Gary Collins and softball Coach Sandy Montgomery received distinguished awards for their 700th and 500th victories, respectively.\n\nStoddart Receives Jack Blake Award\n\nRyan Stoddart (Springfield) was given the Jack Blake Award at a halftime ceremony Sunday (10/21) at Korte Stadium. The Blake Award is a prestigious award given to a men's soccer player who exhibits the traits displayed by former SIUE All-American Jack Blake.\n\nStoddart, who scored the game-tying goal in SIUE's 2-1 double overtime win on Sunday against Wisconsin-Parkside, was the fifth recipient of the award. SIUE Coach Ed Huneke said Stoddart was chosen for the award because of his commitment as a player, having been a walk-on his freshman season.\n\nThe Jack Blake Award is given to a player who displays intensity, dedication, fitness, and leadership. Blake was an NCAA Division I All-American in 1970 and was a member of the 1971 Pan-American Soccer team and a member of the 1972 Olympic team.\n\nSIUE Volleyball Works For Postseason Bid\n\nThe only chance left for an NCAA bid for the SIUE volleyball team is to win next month's Great Lakes Valley Conference tournament. SIUE Coach Todd Gober is focusing his attention on that chance.\n\nSIUE travels this week to Kentucky Wesleyan on Friday (10/26) at 7 p.m. and Bellarmine on Saturday (10/27) at 1 p.m. The Cougars defeated both teams at the Vadalabene Center earlier this season and hope to match that effort on the road.\n\n\"We need to come out of this week with a 10-3 record in the conference,\" said Gober. \"We're going to Kentucky Wesleyan and Bellarmine with the focus of putting ourselves in position for the postseason.\"\n\nThe Cougars are 16-11 overall and 8-3 in the GLVC after having its six-match winning streak broken at Truman State in a five-game thriller. SIUE won the first two games, but Truman State swept the next three games for the win. SIUE defeated Washington University in St. Louis in four games and Saint Joseph's in three games.\n\nWashington was ranked No. 3 in the nation among NCAA Division III schools. The win over St. Joseph's gave Gober and the Cougars a perfect 8-0 record at home. The Cougars are on the road the rest of the season.\n\nSIUE has improved its team hitting percentage to .191. Andrea Voss (St. Rose) leads the Cougars with a .283 hitting percentage. She also leads SIUE in blocks at 1.26 per game. She is followed closely in blocks by Stephanie Trame (Highland) and Kelly Schaill (Princeton). All three Cougars are among the top 10 in the GLVC in blocks per game.\n\nOctober 30, 2001\n\nNational Weather Service Gives Approval For Station\n\nMeteorology is a fascinating science and, according to many aficionados, the Upper Mississippi River Valley is the place to be when it comes to watching the weather.\n\nStudents enrolled in climatology and meteorology classes at SIUE are in agreement and they've been given a chance to take part in hands-on training, thanks to Assistant Geography Professor Mark Hildebrandt, who has obtained the National Weather Service's stamp of approval for a supplemental Cooperative Weather Station on campus.\n\nAn $8,729 grant from the SIUE Excellence in Undergraduate Education fund has helped purchase equipment to create a fully-operational, nationally-recognized weather station at SIUE. \"It's not very exciting to look at,\" Hildrebrandt said, \"but this station-on a plot of land maintained by the Environmental Sciences program-records daily meteorological conditions, including maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity, precipitation, and evaporation.\"\n\nHildebrandt said he is currently writing a grant for an additional $5,000 to purchase wind-measurement equipment. \"There are very few wind measurement facilities in Madison County and the National Weather Service is interested in our creating one here in Edwardsville,\" he said.\n\nAs part of the agreement with the NWS, meteorology and climatology students at SIUE (there are about 200 of them each semester) are charged with taking measurements once every 24 hours and then transmitting that information daily to the NWS. \"This is a great leaning tool for our students,\" Hildebrandt said. \"Many of these students are interested in careers in climatology and meteorology and this will give them invaluable experience.\"\n\nEven though the SIUE weather station is what's known as a \"cooperative\" station, Hildrebrandt said the information is still important to the National Weather Service at St. Charles, Mo. \"I'm excited about this for the students,\" he said. \"Because of this station, there are several of our students who are now interested in becoming certified weather observers for the NWS.\n\n\"Students will apply what they have learned in the classroom to the actual operation of the weather station. Not only will the weather station serve as a unique learning and teaching tool, it will also serve the community as an official measuring stick of climatic conditions in Edwardsville.\"\n\n'While You Were Out'. . . Voice Mail, Not Busy Signals\n\nPink message slips are a thing of the past at SIUE. It's been more than three years since we've had to tape those things to the lamp on the boss's desk. A funny thing happened to SIUE on the way to the phone store in 1998-voice mail.\n\nHate it, love it, voice mail is here to stay, because on this campus no one gets an annoying busy signal and we know that's even worse than talking to a recording. \"At least with the voice mail, the caller makes a contact,\" says Angela Imming, director of Telecommunications for the university.\n\n\"It's much more efficient and it's more professional,\" she said. Imming said SIUE's digital phone system also provides several other services, such as six-way conferencing, caller ID, two phone lines for every phone at no additional cost, speed dialing, and a hands-free feature. \"And the recurring charge for the phone is still at $25, which is what it was before we went digital.\"\n\nBut, by far, the biggest value is voice mail, Imming said. In the past, a voice mail system was available at an additional cost of $7 per month per telephone, a cost that was prohibitive to larger offices. \"When a caller can make a connection to a voice, they feel better than hearing a raucous busy signal,\" Imming said.\n\n\"And, we no longer have to worry about if the pink slip messages will get lost on someone's desk.\"\n\nThere is phone system training available by calling Pat Rzewnicki, training manager, x3404, or, by e-mail: przewni@siue.edu\n\nJay Starratt, associate vice chancellor for Information Technology, said the telephone system offers several services and office configurations to make SIUE's offices operate more professionally. \"For example, voice mail offers a very flexible system that can include message distribution and message queues,\" he said.\n\n\"Voice mail also can be used to notify the caller that the person will be off campus for a few days, which I find extremely helpful. I call several campuses regularly in my role here and I'm surprised how often I'm not able to leave messages with the person I am trying to reach. It's frustrating.\"\n\nCats And Dogs Mix It Up On The Flag Football Field\n\nThey were fighting like cats and dogs last week at SIU Carbondale. Well, actually, it was the Southern Illinois University Salukis and the SIU Edwardsville Cougars matching up for the first time in an intramural/intra campus flag football challenge.\n\nAlthough the three Cougar teams lost each match by a touchdown or less, organizers said the SIU Challenge last week was a success. \"Both sides were very enthusiastic and we plan to make it an annual event, said Chad Rodgers, coordinator of intramural sports at SIUE.\n\nThe challenge consisted of three matches with the SIUE co-ed recreation team known as the Brahma Bulls, the Freakshow, the men's team from SIUE, and SIUE's Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity team, the Sphinx. The Carbondale teams did not have names, Rodgers said.\n\n\"This was our effort to get into the spirit of President James Walker's call for more collaboration between the SIU campuses,\" Rodgers said. He said one of his student workers proposed the idea and it was approved by Mick Ostrander, director of campus recreation at SIUE, and Bill McMinn, director of Campus Recreation at Carbondale. There was a rumor that the two directors had dinner riding on the challenge outcome.\n\n\"Not as many attended the matches as we had hoped, but we want to do it annually,\" Rodgers said. \"Next year it will be in Edwardsville and we are planning it as a large social event with food and other activities. We believe this event can grow.\"\n\nRodgers also is considering adding intramural basketball and volleyball as events between the two campuses. As to the outcome? \"Just wait till next year.\"\n\nSpeech Center Good At Training Butterflies\n\nLike they say: \"It's OK to have butterflies in your stomach, but getting them to fly in formation is key.\" The SIUE Speech Center knows how to train butterflies.\n\nMost students who have little or no experience making speeches know that feeling-that emptiness in the pit of the stomach when asked to speak in front of a class. The SIUE Speech Center can help, says Jenita Hladyshewsky, a graduate student who is director of the program for the Department of Speech Communication and the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\"The center was created by SIUE students for SIUE students, and funded by an Excellence in Undergraduate Education grant from the university and through CAS,\" Hladyshewsky said. \"We provide one-on-one assistance with all aspects of speech organization and delivery,\" she said.\n\nTo help accomplish those goals, the center has a videotaping room where the client may be recorded for critique by the trained staff. The center also has a Power Point training program. \"In addition, we can provide assisted research of speech topics and help with speech outlines, as well as help with organization of speech content.\"\n\nHladyshewsky said many of the students who come to the center need help with speech organization. \"Some organization can be gained by using Power Point as a supplement to the speech, but we don't want the technology to overcome the presentation.\"\n\nAnd, then there are those who are petrified at the thought of facing an audience. \"We offer help in how to overcome nerves,\" she said. \"We can show them how to turn that nervousness into excitement. But they can only learn that by practicing and that's what we offer-opportunities to practice and hone speechmaking skills.\"\n\nE. Duff Wrobbel, associate professor of Speech Communication and acting faculty coordinator of the center, said the program evolved over several years from a series of studies and projects conducted by Speech Communication students in the Senior Assignment course.\n\n\"Beginning with an initial needs assessment of students and faculty, our majors did virtually 100 percent of the designing, setting up, staffing and evaluating of the center,\" Wrobbel said. \"We continued with financial support from Doug Eder and the Office of Undergraduate Assessment, until we were able to secure funding through the EUE grant program and through CAS.\n\n\"Students even helped prepare the EUE grant, which was written in such a way as to leave the center in the students' hands as much as possible,\" he said. \"It is this peer approach that has made the center effective, and we didn't want to 'punish' our students for their success by taking the center away from them once it became fully funded.\"\n\nThe center is located in Room 3323 of Alumni Hall and this semester it is open 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 4:30 to 9 p.m. Mondays; 9:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays; 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. Thursdays. The center is closed on Fridays and weekends. For information, call the center, 650-3085.\n\nHaas Named Business School Development Director\n\nSandra Haas of Creve Coeur, Mo., formerly development director for Missouri Goodwill Industries, was named director of Development for the SIUE School of Business on Oct. 8, according to Robert Carver, dean of the School.\n\nHaas, a 1984 graduate of SIUE in Speech Communication, has 15 years of fund-raising experience, including positions with Goodwill, The Saint Louis Society, the American Heart Association in St. Louis, the Alzheimer's Association, and the United Way of Greater St. Louis.\n\n\"It is exciting to see the growth that has taken place at the University and in the Edwardsville-Glen Carbon area since I graduated in 1984,\" Haas said. \"The campus and surrounding communities have doubled in population and economic activity during that 17 years.\n\n\"I look forward to helping SIUE expand its capabilities by increasing its fund-raising revenues through my contacts and knowledge of the St. Louis metropolitan community,\" Haas said. \"I am proud to be part of SIUE's fund-raising team, as the institution continues to develop its role as the major resource for economic growth in the rapidly expanding region.\"\n\nHaas is the mother of three sons: Tim Haas lives in Belleville with his wife, Jen, and daughter, Abbey; Jamie Haas lives in south St. Louis with his wife, Charity, and their son, Caleb; and Mike Haas is a student at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Mo.\n\nMen's Soccer Selected For NCAA Tournament\n\nSIUE men's soccer is off to the NCAA tournament. The Cougars will face the Lewis University Flyers in the opening round of the 16-team tournament on Sunday (11/11) at 1 p.m., in Romeoville.\n\nThe Cougars are coming off a 2-1 Great Lakes Valley Conference Tournament loss to Lewis on Sunday (11/4). SIUE holds an overall record of 15-2-3 and the Cougars hope to hand Lewis its first loss of the season as the Flyers enter the match with a 20-0-1 mark. The tie was against SIUE on Sept. 14 in Romeoville.\n\nThe Cougars are anxious to give Lewis another try, said SIUE men's soccer coach Ed Huneke. \"The game will be a huge challenge, but it is one that we will be up for,\" said Huneke, the 2001 GLVC Coach of the Year. \"We are very motivated and cannot wait for Lewis to bring it on.\"\n\nDespite the second-place finish to Lewis in the GLVC tournament, Huneke is very proud of his team for accomplishing so much. \"We have a great record, and the NCAA bid is a great accomplishment,\" said Huneke. \"Of course we are sad about the loss, but the big picture still looks very good.\"\n\nThe Cougars have featured a strong offense and a tight defense all season. Matt Evers (Edwardsville) was SIUE's goalkeeper in the GLVC Tournament and figures to continue that role into the NCAA Tournament. Evers holds a 1.07 goals against average and has 55 saves.\n\nThe offense is led by seniors Justin McMillian (Granite City) and David Mwendapole (Nairobi, Kenya). Both were named first team All-GLVC last week. McMillian, who has scored 15 goals and six assists, also was tabbed the GLVC's Player of the Year. Mwendapole posted statistics as strong with 11 goals and 11 assists.\n\nSIUE Falls In GLVC Title Game\n\nJuan Martin Devoto scored the game-winning goal with less than seven minutes to play as Lewis University edged SIUE for the 2001 Great Lakes Valley Conference men's soccer title Sunday (11/4) at Bob Guelker Field.\n\nSIUE, ranked No. 11 in the NSCAA/NCAA Division II poll, fell to 15-2-3 and suffered its first Great Lakes region loss of the season. The Cougars are hoping Sunday's loss won't have a factor in earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament starting next weekend. Lewis and SIUE may match up again in the first round of the 16-team NCAA Championships.\n\n\"We came up a little bit on the short end,\" said SIUE Coach Ed Huneke. \"But we weren't short on heart and intensity.\"\n\nLewis, 20-0-1 and ranked No. 2 in the nation on the NSCAA/NCAA Division II poll, scored the game's first goal at 25:06 as John Thompson scored with an assist from Carlos Stremi.\n\nSIUE couldn't counter until 79:44 when Cress Maddox headed the ball in off a throw-in from Matthew Horan.\n\nHuneke said his Cougars have come from behind before and were playing calm, patient soccer in the game's final minutes. \"We've been down before and come back. We have confidence in those situations,\" said Huneke.\n\nLewis, however, closed the scoring with Devoto's goal at 83:13. Devoto scored from five yards out on a crisp pass from 40 yards out from Rob Green. The Flyers, 12-11 ,outshot SIUE. Cougar goalkeeper Matt Evers had four saves while Lewis goalie Jordan Gustman recorded six saves.\n\nMcMillian, Huneke Named To Top Men's Soccer Honors\n\nJustin McMillian was named the Great Lakes Valley Conference Player of the Year and Ed Huneke was named the league's Coach of the Year.\n\nMcMillian (Granite City) made the most of his final season by leading the GLVC in scoring heading into the conference tournament this weekend. McMillian has 34 points, including a GLVC-leading 14 goals.\n\nHuneke led his Cougars to a 14-1-3 record heading into the weekend. SIUE is the host institution for the GLVC Tournament and plays Quincy at Bob Guelker Field on Saturday (11/3) at noon. The other semifinals pits Lewis and Wisconsin-Parkside with game time set for 2:30 p.m.\n\nThree other Cougars joined McMillian for All-GLVC honors. David Mwendapole (Kenya) was a fellow first team selection. The forward, who transferred at the beginning of the year from Lincoln Memorial, has 11 goals and is tied for the GLVC lead with 10 assists. Cress Maddox (Springfield) and Chris Camacho (Quincy) were named to the second team as backs. It was the third time Maddox had been voted to the All-GLVC and the first for Camacho.\n\nSIUE Lands Two On Women's Tennis All-GLVC Team\n\nAmber Stanley (Effingham) and Laura Zeeb (Greenville), members of the women's tennis team, were named All-Great Lakes Valley Conference by a vote of the league's 11 coaches.\n\nStanley, a sophomore, was named All-GLVC for the second straight season. She played No. 1 for the Cougars and amassed an 8-4 record, including a 6-3 mark in the GLVC.\n\nZeeb, a junior, split time at No. 2 and No. 3 while compiling a 9-2 overall record and an 8-1 mark in the GLVC.\n\nThe duo also was doubles partners during the fall season. The team earned a 9-5 record in doubles play.\n\nCougar Volleyball Grabs No. 2 Seed\n\nIt was a must-win match as Coach Todd Gober saw it. SIUE needed to defeat Indianapolis on the road last Friday (11/2) to secure the No. 2 seed in the Great Lakes Valley Conference tournament.\n\nHis Cougars won the match in five games, 30-27, 30-19, 23-30, 27-30, 15-11, and then lost to Northern Kentucky the next day, finishing the regular season with a 20-12 record and an 11-4 mark in the GLVC.\n\nNorthern Kentucky is the host and No. 1 seed for the eight-team GLVC Tournament. SIUE faces Missouri-St. Louis at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday (11/8) in the first round. It will be the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams. UMSL won the first match in five games. SIUE won the next two matches in three games.\n\n\"Anything can happen,\" admitted Gober, \"but we have a 6-1 record against the teams on our side of the bracket.\"\n\nSIUE's side of the bracket includes third-seeded Southern Indiana and sixth-seeded Indianapolis. The other four teams in the tourney are top-seeded Northern Kentucky, fourth-seeded Lewis, fifth-seeded Quincy and eighth-seeded Wisconsin-Parkside.\n\nGober said he believes his team is playing good volleyball right now, but the key is to play consistently. \"When we play consistent, we win,\" said Gober. \"There have been moments in every match where we have had some type of a lapse, either in communication, defense, or offense, and we have to eliminate that this time around and focus.\"\n\nGober said SIUE played its best defensive game of the year against Indianapolis. Sophomore Sarah Watts (Sherman) had what Gober calls the biggest \"stuff block\" of the year. \"Watts can really be credited with creating a change in momentum with that play; it was a huge turning point against Indianapolis,\" said Gober.\n\n\"Kari Karban (Belleville) also had good serving games against both Indianapolis and Northern Kentucky,\" said Gober. Karban is seventh in the GLVC for service aces.\n\nCougars Play Exhibition Game at Bradley\n\nWith a large group of Bradley Braves fans waiting to cheer on their team, the SIUE men's basketball team just will be looking for the right combinations.\n\nCoach Jack Margenthaler said he isn't going into Saturday's (11/10) 3:15 p.m. exhibition game with a set lineup. He expects to play numerous combinations. \"We want to find the five guys who look the best together,\" Margenthaler said.\n\nHe expects to play 10 players in the game by substituting two and three players at a time. Health concerns will be prominent for both teams. Margenthaler said both clubs are waiting for players to return from injury. He also expects Bradley to highlight their young talent.\n\n\"Bradley is talented in the fact they have some great guards, and they have some size,\" he said.\n\nSIUE returns four starters from last season's 7-19 finish and are led by 6-foot-10-inch senior Marty Perry (Jacksonville). The forward averaged 16.3 points per game last season. The Cougars have had an influx of new players. SIUE has eight newcomers on the 2001-2002 roster.\n\nCougars Take On SEMO In Exhibition\n\nThe Cougar women's basketball team faces its first full game this weekend after travelling to Cape Girardeau, Mo., to play Southeast Missouri State in an exhibition game. Game time is at 7 p.m.\n\nSIUE will use this exhibition game as a test to see where the Cougars are, said Coach Wendy Hedberg. Hedberg feels that her team matches up well with the Division I team according to size. She is anxious to see how the Cougars react in playing conditions and who works well together. \"We just need to make sure that we are all on the same page,\" said Hedberg.\n\nThe Cougars return two starters from last year's 20-9 season. SIUE lost in the first round of the NCAA Division II Tournament last season. SIUE returning starters are sophomore guard Jessica Robert (Carlyle) and junior forward Liz DeShasier (Carrollton). Robert is the top returning scorer at 10.0 points per game.\n\nZ. Stephens Wins Saturday At Lindenwood Open\n\nZach Stephens (St. Charles, Mo.) won the 174-pound weight class at the Lindenwood Open, giving SIUE its lone championship at last Saturday's (11/3) Lindenwood Open.\n\nOmari Johnson (Chicago) placed fourth for the Cougars at 165 pounds. Heavyweight Aaron Wiens (Cicero) and 157-pounder Nathan Graumenz (Vandalia) lost in the consolation semifinals.\n\n\"Everyone won a match except for one wrestler,\" said SIUE Coach Booker Benford. \"They got a taste of victory.\"\n\nBenford said he was happy with the team's performance but wanted to see more intensity and focus. \"Guys still aren't staying intense for the full seven minutes,\" said Benford.\n\nSeptember 2001\n\nGovernor Leads Delegation In Groundbreaking Here\n\nGov. George Ryan led a delegation last week that included Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Illinois), Rep. John Shimkus (R, Illinois-20), SIU President James Walker, and SIUE Chancellor David Werner in breaking ground for the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Pilot Plant in University Park.\n\n\"The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Pilot Plant will have a profound impact on the economy of Illinois,\" said Werner in remarks at the ceremony, where about 200 gathered for the event. \"The demand for ethanol is expected to increase enormously during the next decade.\n\n\"By accelerating the implementation of new technologies designed to increase the cost effectiveness of producing ethanol from corn, this facility will increase the demand for Illinois corn and significantly enhance the Illinois economy. The increased use of ethanol will also have a positive impact on the environment and on national energy independence.\"\n\nIn June 2000, President Clinton signed a bill that completed funding for the research plant. The $14 million in federal funds, along with $6 million already appropriated by the State of Illinois, means that the facility is fully capitalized.\n\nThe plant-which will be used solely for the purpose of research and not as a production facility-is the culmination of many months of planning by University Park Executive Director Brian Donnelly and the legislative work done by the Illinois delegation.\n\n\"Many people have worked long and hard to obtain funding for this project,\" said Werner. \"The entire Illinois legislative delegation is to be commended for bringing this unique research facility to University Park. We're especially grateful for the work of Rep. Shimkus, Sen. Durbin, and Sen. Peter Fiztgerald (R-Illinois), as well as that of House Speaker Dennis Hastert, and House Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest.\"\n\nHalf of the 20,000-square-foot facility includes a highly fl"
