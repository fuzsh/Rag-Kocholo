        "text": "10+ Years Supporting\n\nCoach Career Development\n\nOur Rising Coaches Conference Official Notes have been sent out, downloaded, emailed, and read by tens of thousands of coaches in all sports over the past 10 years. Moreover, hundreds of coaches have attended our annual conference every summer. Some of the impressive numbers of attendees include (as of July 2015):\n\n87 attendees who have been promoted within or have been hired to another D1 school after attending a Conference. 143 attendees who have been promoted within or have been hired elsewhere and are still on staff in college or professional basketball.\n\n14 attendees who have been hired by an NBA team after attending a Conference. 70+ Head Coaches & Assistant Coaches in college basketball who have been speakers at the Rising Coaches Conference over the past 5 years. 28 speakers who received a promotion or changed jobs since speaking at the Rising Coaches Conference. 5 Head Coaches who spoke at the Rising Coaches Conference as Assistant Coaches.\n\nWhat we are always the most proud of is our direct impact in the coaching community. Every off-season (March-September) we receive calls from coaches at all levels (High-Major, Mid-Major, Low-Major, D2, JUCO, NAIA, etc.) asking our advice for candidates for open positions on their staff.\n\nHumbled to do so, we aim at finding the right fit for those coaches to improve their program and to help advance the careers of young coaches who have proven to be dedicated to their personal & professional development. Often this is hard to do with a simple resume, so we encourage as many coaches to get as involved with Rising Coaches as possible so we can know the person/coach behind the name!"
