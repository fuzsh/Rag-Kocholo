        "text": "Award-Winning and Hall of Fame Broadcasters Headline On-Air Lineup\n\nCritically Acclaimed ‘Megalodon’ Camera Makes College Basketball Debut\n\nNEW YORK – FOX Sports returns to New York City’s Madison Square Garden with its elite roster of award-winning and Hall of Fame broadcasters for exclusive coverage of the 2021 BIG EAST Men’s Basketball Tournament live on FOX and FS1 from Wednesday, March 10, through Saturday, March 13. The network offers enhanced viewing options, as the ‘Megalodon’ camera makes its college basketball debut and the tournament is transmitted in 5G for the first time ever.\n\nFOX Sports lead play-by-play announcer and 2021 recipient of CoSIDA’s Jake Wade Award Gus Johnson joins Emmy Award winner Bill Raftery to call the tournament’s Thursday night quarterfinals before teaming with former All-American and NBA veteran Jim Jackson, a member of the Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame’s Class of 2021, for the semifinals and championship. Veteran play-by-play announcer Tim Brando calls Wednesday’s first-round games with Raftery and Thursday’s afternoon quarterfinals with Jackson.\n\nHost Rob Stone is live from FOX Sports’ Los Angeles studios for the duration of the tournament, sitting alongside former UCLA and St. John’s head coach Steve Lavin and former UConn standout Donny Marshall for bridge and postgame coverage throughout the tournament, plus half-hour pregame shows before Friday’s semifinals and Saturday’s championship. Bracket expert Mike DeCourcy joins throughout the week with the latest NCAA Tournament projections.\n\nViewers will be treated to unique and impressive visuals during the 2021 BIG EAST Tournament with the return of FOX Sports RailCam, plus the college basketball debut of ‘Megalodon,’ a live wireless camera that produces ultra-vivid imagery integrated seamlessly within a live telecast. FOX Sports debuted Megalodon during the NFL season to critical acclaim and has since activated the fan-favorite for its coverage of the Daytona 500 as well as Liga MX on FOX Deportes. This year’s tournament will be transmitted from Madison Square Garden in 5G, resulting in crisper and more reliable feed with less on-site cabling.\n\nFOX Sports’ college basketball coverage can be streamed live on the new FOX Sports app and FOXSports.com, which also offer bonus “Above the Rim” viewing options for all games of the tournament. Also on the app, website, @CBBonFOX social platforms and YouTube, Mark Titus and Tate Frazier preview the BIG EAST Tournament on Tuesday’s episode of the popular Titus & Tate podcast and provide additional coverage all month long, including live and interactive Selection Sunday “Watch With” and bracket reaction specials.\n\nFOX Sports’ complete 2021 BIG EAST Tournament programming schedule is below.\n\nFor more information, visit FOX Sports Press Pass and follow @FOXSportsPR on Twitter.\n\n2021 BIG EAST Tournament Schedule\n\nDate Time (ET) Network Matchup Broadcasters Wednesday, March 10 3:00 PM FS1 No. 8 Georgetown vs.\n\nNo. 9 Marquette Tim Brando and\n\nBill Raftery 6:00 PM FS1 No. 7 Xavier vs.\n\nNo. 10 Butler Tim Brando and\n\nBill Raftery 9:00 PM FS1 No. 6 Providence vs.\n\nNo. 11 DePaul Tim Brando and\n\nBill Raftery Thursday, March 11 12:00 PM FS1 No. 1 Villanova vs.\n\nNo.8/9 Winner Tim Brando and\n\nJim Jackson 3:00 PM FS1 No. 4 St. John’s vs.\n\nNo. 5 Seton Hall Tim Brando and\n\nJim Jackson 6:00 PM FS1 No. 2 Creighton vs.\n\nNo. 7/10 Winner Gus Johnson and\n\nBill Raftery 9:00 PM FS1 No. 3 UConn vs.\n\nNo. 6/11 Winner Gus Johnson and\n\nBill Raftery Friday, March 12 5:30 PM FS1 BIG EAST TOURNAMENT PREGAME Rob Stone, Steve Lavin and Donny Marshall 6:00 PM FS1 Semifinal No. 1 Gus Johnson and\n\nJim Jackson 9:00 PM FS1 Semifinal No. 2 Gus Johnson and\n\nJim Jackson Saturday, March 13 6:00 PM FOX BIG EAST TOURNAMENT PREGAME Rob Stone, Steve Lavin and Donny Marshall 6:30 PM FOX BIG EAST Championship Gus Johnson and\n\nJim Jackson 8:30 PM FOX BIG EAST TOURNAMENT POSTGAME Rob Stone, Steve Lavin and Donny Marshall\n\nAbout FOX Sports\n\nFOX Sports is the umbrella entity representing FOX Corporation’s wide array of multi-platform US-based sports assets.
