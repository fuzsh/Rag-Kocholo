In the win over Western Oregon, NAU had fourplayers in double figures, led by Dan McClintock's 24 points and Mavis' 18. NAUassistant Pat Sandle was on the San Francisco State team with Bruin head coachSteve Lavin during their playing days. NAU is now at full strength, with thereturn of 6-3 junior guard Michael McNair (preseason ankle injury) and 5-10junior guard Kawika Akina (transfer from Hawaii). Last season, the Lumberjackswere 21-7, won the regular season Big Sky title and advanced to the first roundof the NIT, losing at Arkansas. All five starters return from that squad. Lastseason, the Lumberjacks were the nation's top three-point shooting team andsecond to UCLA in field goal shooting.\n\nSeries History: This is the first meeting between the two schools.\n\nLast Game\n\nOn Dec. 13 before 9,724 in Pauley Pavilion, UCLA opened the 1997-98 home seasonwith a 120-91 nonconference victory over CS Fullerton. The 120 points was themost by a Bruin team since the 1994-95 NCAA Championship season, when UCLA beatGeorge Mason 137-100 in Pauley and the 120 points was the highest the Bruins havescored against CS Fullerton (UCLA now leads the series 8-0). It was also UCLA'sfirst 100-point game of the season (the last was in 1996-97, a 109-75 win overCharleston Southern in a first round NCAA game at Auburn Hills). The game alsomarked the first time in school history the Bruins have ever started four truefreshmen (Travis Reed, Rico Hines, Earl Watson and Billy Knight). The Bruins hadsix players in double figures, led by J. R. Henderson's team-high 23 points andnine rebounds and season-highs from three freshmen--Billy Knight's 15 points,Travis Reed's first-ever double-double (14 points, 10 rebounds) and Earl Watson'sfirst-ever double-double (11 points,10 assists, 5 steals). The game also markedthe return of Bruin senior Kris Johnson, who played 15 minutes, getting 15points. The Bruins shot a season-best 63.8 from the field, a season-high 50.0from the three-point line and a season-high 72.7 from the foul line, with aseason-best 44 rebounds and a season-worst 22 turnovers. The Titans, led by ChrisDade's game-high 26 points, shot 43.1 from the field, 35.7 from the three-pointline and 65.5 from the foul line, with 33 rebounds and an opponent season-hightying 24 turnovers.\n\nBruin Notes\n\nAgainst CS Fullerton, the Bruins' home opener this season, UCLA for the first time in school history started four true freshmen (Travis Reed, Rico Hines, Earl Watson and Billy Knight).\n\nThe win over New Mexico was UCLA's third victory (with no losses) in The Wooden Classic. In the first Wooden Classic in 1994, UCLA beat Kentucky 82-81, when then-Bruin freshman J. R. Henderson sank two free throws with 0.6 seconds left in the game to seal the win for the Bruins. In 1995, UCLA beat Maryland 73-63, when then-Bruin freshman Jelani McCoy had UCLA's first-ever recorded triple-double--15 points, 10 rebounds and a Pac-10 and school single-game record of 11 blocked shots. UCLA did not play in the Wooden Classic last year.\n\nAt the Alaska Shootout, where Baron Davis and Earl Watson started all three games for the Bruins, it was the first time since the 1979-80 season that UCLA started two freshmen at the guard positions. In '79-80, under Larry Brown, the Bruins started freshmen Rod Foster and Michael Holton, now in his second year as a UCLA assistant, and the Bruins advanced to the NCAA championship game, losing to Louisville. The loss to North Carolina was the second worst in school history and the Bruins tied the school record for single-game three-point attempts (23). Against Alaska Anchorage, UCLA at one time had five true freshmen on the floor, for the first time since freshmen became eligible in 1972-73.\n\nUCLA is now 4-1 to start the season and it's the first time since 1994-95 (5-0, was 6-0 before losing only game of the season) the Bruins have four wins in the opening five games. The opening season defeat to North Carolina at The Alaska Shootout was UCLA's third consecutive opening game loss -- 1995, 78-69 to Santa Clara at the Maui Classic (started the season 2-2); 1996, 77-76 OT to Tulsa in Pauley at the Preseason NIT (started the season 2-2) and 1997, 109-68 to North Carolina at The Alaska Shootout.\n\nOn Monday, Sept. 29, two UCLA players, senior Kris Johnson and junior Jelani McCoy, were indefinitely suspended from the team for violation of department policies and team rules. On Monday, Nov. 17, Johnson was partially reinstated to return to practice, but was not reinstated for games. On Monday, Dec. 1, McCoy was also reinstated to return to practice, but has not been reinstated for games. Johnson was cleared to play in games on Tuesday, Dec. 9 and played his first game of the season vs. CS Fullerton, getting 15 points in 15 minutes. Johnson and McCoy did not accompany the team to Anchorage or play in the Wooden Classic.\n\nIn the early signing period, the Bruins inked 6-4, 200-pound Ray Young, from St. Joseph Notre Dame HS in Alameda, rated the No. 1 prep off-guard in the nation by Dick Vitale's preseason magazine, and 6-7, 215-pound forward Matt Barnes, from Del Campo HS in Fair Oaks, one of the top forward prospects in the State.\n\nIn preseason rankings, the Bruin were picked No. 5 by USA Today and No. 6 by AP. Playboy selected UCLA preseason No. 1. In a vote of Pac-10 sportswriters in the conference preseason poll, UCLA was selected second in the Pac-10, behind defending national champion Arizona.\n\nToby Bailey, J. R. Henderson and Jelani McCoy are all on preseason lists for the Naismith and Wooden Player of the Year and All-American team. On Naismith, Bailey, Henderson and McCoy are on the Best of the Rest chart (10 players) and on the Wooden list, Bailey and McCoy are among the Top 25 candidates and Henderson is on the Players Considered Top 25 chart.\n\nUCLA players and coaches are available for interviews following practices on Tuesday and Friday (3-6 p.m.) and practices are open those days for the media. Interviews at other times can be arranged through the UCLA Sports Information Office.\n\nThe Bruins have won the last three Pac-10 titles outright. Should UCLA win its fourth consecutive conference crown in 1998, the Bruins would be the first team since the inception of the Pac-10 Conference in 1978-79 to accomplish this feat. UCLA won 13 straight Pac-10 titles from 1967-79. The Bruins are 48-6 in conference play over the last three years with three outright championships. In the second half of Pac-10 play over the last three years, UCLA is 26-1. In the last six years, it owns a record of 46-8 in the second half of the season.\n\nIn the decade of the 1990s, UCLA is the only Pac-10 school to have a winning record against every other team in the league: 9-8 vs. Arizona, 17-0 vs. Arizona State, 10-6 vs. California, 13-4 vs. Oregon, 14-3 vs. Oregon State, 11-5 vs. Stanford, 10-6 vs. USC, 14-2 vs. Washington, 15-1 vs. Washington State (includes 1990 Pac-10 Postseason results).\n\nUCLA has led the NCAA in field goal percentage shooting the last two years --1997, 52.0 (932-1791) and 1996, 52.8 (897-1698).\n\nUCLA's three seniors (Toby Bailey, J. R. Henderson, Kris Johnson) have participated in three consecutive NCAA Tournaments, a record of 9-2, including the 1995 NCAA Title and 1997 Elite Eight; three straight Pac-10 titles, including a conference record of 48-6 (88.9) and three consecutive 20+game winning seasons, averaging 26 wins a year with an overall mark of 83-18 (82.2)\n\nToby Bailey's younger brother, Ryan 'Moose' Bailey, is sitting out this season at UCLA after transferring from Penn State. In 1997 at Penn State, Bailey started as a true freshman for the Nittany Lions at point guard. He will be a sophomore next season for the Bruins.\n\nThe 1997 NCAA Tournament was UCLA's 33rd appearance in the \"Big Dance\", including bids the last nine consecutive years. Currently, only three schools have advanced to the NCAA Tournament more consecutive times--North Carolina 23, Arizona 13 and Indiana 12. The Bruins hold the record for most NCAA titles (11), last winning in 1995, and victories (77).\n\nUCLA's total of 24 wins in 1997 has been exceeded only three times in the last 18 years - 1987 (25), 1992 (28) and 1995 (32). The last time a Bruin first-year coach won more games than Steve Lavin in 1997 was in 1978, when Gary Cunningham won 25.\n\nThe Feb. 23, 1997 contest with Duke in Pauley Pavilion was UCLA's 2,000th game in the school's history. The Bruins have an overall record of 1,408-605 (69.9, 2,013 games) in 78 years of college basketball. UCLA's 69.9 winning percentage is No. 4 in the nation behind Kentucky, North Carolina and UNLV. Kansas is fifth.\n\nUCLA has the nation's current record of 49 straight winning seasons (1948-49 to 1996-97).\n\nUCLA's sweep of defending NCAA champion Arizona in 1997 was its third in the last six years. In 1992, the Bruins swept the Wildcats and advanced to the NCAA Elite Eight. In 1995, the Bruins swept the Wildcats and won the NCAA title. In 1997, UCLA advanced to the Elite Eight, giving it an NCAA record of 12-2 in those three years.\n\nPauley Pavilion (12,819) is in its 33rd season in 1997-98 as the home of the Bruins. UCLA's all-time Pauley Pavilion record is 461-51 (512 games, 90.0; Jackson State was the 500th game in Pauley Pavilion). On Feb. 19, 1997 in UCLA's 82-60 win over USC, the largest crowd in Pauley Pavilon history watched that game (13,382; previous high was 13,037 vs. Oregon, 3/11/95). Four days later (Feb. 23, 1997) in the 73-69 win over Duke, UCLA set a new attendance record - 13,478, breaking the old one by 96. The last time the Bruins were unbeaten at home for a regular season was 1994-95 (15-0). The Bruins finished Pac-10 play unbeaten at home in 1996 (9-0) for the first time since the 1994-95 season. UCLA's nonconference losses to Kansas on Dec. 7, 1996 and to Tulsa on Nov. 20, 1996 were only the Bruins' third and fourth nonleague defeats at home in the last seven years. In nonconference games in Pauley Pavilion since 1990-91, UCLA is 40-4. The losses were against -- Kansas, 96-83, 1996-97; Tulsa, 77-76 OT, 1996-97; Louisville, 78-76, 1995-96 and Duke, 75-65, 1991-92.\n\nFrom 1986-87 through 1995-96, UCLA sent more players (26) into the NBA than any school in the country. In 1995-96, UCLA's 11 former players on NBA rosters ranked second to North Carolina. On fall camp rosters to open the 1997-98 season, UCLA had 10 players on NBA rosters--Mitchell Butler, Cleveland Cavaliers; Tyus Edney, Boston Celtics, Jack Haley, New Jersey Nets; Don MacLean, New Jersey Nets; Darrick Martin, Los Angeles Clippers; Reggie Miller, Indiana Pacers; Tracy Murray, Washington Wizards; Ed O'Bannon, Orlando Magic; Jerome \"Pooh\" Richardson, Los Angeles Clippers; George Zidek, Denver Nuggets.\n\nUCLA HEAD COACH STEVE LAVIN-- The 1997 Basketball Times' National Rookie Coach of the Year, NABC District 15 Coach of the Year and USBWA District 9 Coach of the Year, Lavin in 1997 led UCLA to a 24-8 overall mark, a No. 7 national ranking, its third consecutive Pac-10 title and ninth straight NCAA bid, reaching the NCAA Elite Eight Midwest Region title game. He is entering his second season as head coach and seventh on the Bruin staff. His 24 wins in 1997 are the most by a first-year Bruin coach since Gary Cunningham won 25 games in 1978. Since being named head coach on Feb. 11, 1997, the Bruins are 15-2, dating back to last season and including an 11-game winning streak from last year. During his six seasons at UCLA, Lavin has been involved in one NCAA title (1995), three NCAA Elite Eights (1992, '95 and 1997), four Pac-10 championships (1997, '96, '95 and '92) and six straight NCAA Tournament and 20+game winning seasons. He has coached in eight consecutive NCAA Tournaments at UCLA and Purdue. Enjoys coaching the defensive end of the floor. In 1995 and '96, UCLA led the Pac-10 in field goal percentage defense and rebound margin.\n\nLavin's UCLA Head Coaching Record1997-98 4-11996-97 24-8 (Pac-10 Champ) 27-9 (75.0)Lavin's UCLA Assistant Coaching Record1995-96 23-8 (NCAA, Pac-10 Champ)1994-95 32-1 (NCAA & Pac-10 Champ)1993-94 21-7 (NCAA)1992-93 22-11 (NCAA)1991-92 28-5 (NCAA, Pac-10 Champ) 126-32 (79.7)UCLA Totals 154-41 (79.0)Bruin Defense Under Lavin(FG % Def.)1996-97 42.3 (3rd in Pac-10) 1995-96 41.6 (led Pac-10)1994-95 40.8 (led Pac-10)1993-94 42.11992-93 44.61991-92 45.5\n\nMedia Conferences-- Here's a list of Lavin's weekly press conferences, held most Tuesdays at 12:30 p.m. in the Chancellor's Room (upper NE corner of Pauley Pavilion)-- Dec. 16; over the holidays, Lavin will be available after practices; Wednesday, Jan. 7; Jan. 13, Jan. 20, Jan. 13, Jan. 20, Jan. 27, Feb. 3, Feb. 10, Feb. 17, Feb. 24, March 3.\n\nThe Pac-10 Teleconferences (10:30 a.m.-11:38 a.m.) are on Jan. 13, Jan. 20, Jan. 27, Feb. 3, Feb. 10, Feb. 17, Feb. 24, March 3.
