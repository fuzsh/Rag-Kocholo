        "text": "Monday, March 31, 1997\n\nO’Bannon’s resurgence as a leader has given the Bruins a chance\n\nat a Final Four runBy Brent Boyd\n\nDaily Bruin Senior Staff\n\nNobody is really quite sure when or where it happened.\n\nKris Johnson thinks it was a month ago in Tucson.\n\nSteve Lavin says Berkeley in early January was more like it.\n\nAnd Charles O’Bannon believes everything changed with a\n\nhome-cooked meal on Christmas Eve.\n\nAlthough the specifics may be debatable, one thing remains\n\nagreed upon by all Â­ it certainly did happen, and not a moment\n\ntoo soon.\n\nSenior forward Charles O’Bannon metamorphosed from a sometimes\n\nspectacular Â­ but often inconsistent Â­ player into the\n\nBruins’ driving force, and in the process saved the 1996-97\n\nbasketball season in Westwood.\n\n\"He is playing at a level that I have never seen him play at\n\nbefore,\" junior forward Johnson said. \"He’s gotten to the level\n\nwhere he is one of the top players in college basketball. So guys\n\ncan just kind of watch him and jump on his back and go along for\n\nthe ride.\"\n\nAnd what a ride it has been.\n\nTwo months into the season, the Bruins looked as if they might\n\nnot even make the NCAA Championship Tournament. But now on the\n\nopening day of the Big Dance, the Bruins stand as Pac-10 champions\n\nfor the third consecutive year and seem poised to make a serious\n\nrun at the Final Four.\n\nAnd it has everything to do with Charles O’Bannon.\n\n* * *\n\nOne need not look beyond the statistics to see the impact\n\nO’Bannon has made. In the past 17 games (every game since the\n\n48-point loss to Stanford), he has produced some impressive numbers\n\nÂ­ 19.3 points and 8.1 rebounds per game, and most importantly,\n\na 14-3 UCLA record.\n\n\"The second half of the Cal game (Jan. 11) is when I first saw\n\nit,\" head coach Steve Lavin said. \"After the Stanford loss Â­\n\nthe low point of the season for us Â­ I saw a completely\n\ndifferent Charles O’Bannon. He got 13 rebounds in the second half\n\nand it is from that point on that our team has taken off.\"\n\nO’Bannon currently ranks first on the team in scoring (17.3) and\n\nrebounding (7.2), third in assists (2.6), and fourth in steals\n\n(1.0). With 19 more rebounds in the NCAA tourney, he will become\n\nthe only player in UCLA history to rank among the top 10 career\n\nleaders in all four categories.\n\n\"I think my overall game has improved tremendously,\" O’Bannon\n\nsaid. \"In the past, I used to try and force things. I used to try\n\nand do the impossible, rather than just doing the basic and the\n\nordinary. By just letting the game come to me and playing\n\nbasketball, my field goal percentage and all of my stats have\n\nimproved.\"\n\n* * *\n\nBut, O’Bannon’s effect upon the team has reached far beyond the\n\nbox scores. He has finally taken on the team’s leadership role.\n\n\"I really look at the Arizona game (Feb. 13) as the game in\n\nwhich he solidified his game,\" Johnson said. \"He really stepped up,\n\nand he was making the big shot when we needed it and he’d hit a\n\njumper and we’d just say, ‘Wow, what a big shot!’ And he’s done\n\nthat a number of times since then.\"\n\nIn Tucson, O’Bannon connected on 10 of 14 field goal attempts\n\nand scored what was then a season-high 26 points. The performance\n\nincluded a game-tying basket with only 59 seconds remaining,\n\nultimately leading to the UCLA victory and a choke hold on the\n\nPac-10 race.\n\nBut that game was only one of many clutch performances by\n\nO’Bannon.\n\nIn the other match-up against Arizona Â­ an 84-78 Bruin\n\novertime win in Pauley Pavilion on Jan. 18 Â­ not only did he\n\ngrab 13 rebounds, but he scored 24 points, including eight in\n\novertime to seal the victory.\n\nThree weeks ago against sixth- ranked Duke, O’Bannon shut out\n\nBlue Devil guard Ricky Price for the final 16 minutes, enabling the\n\nBruins to emerge with one of the biggest victories of the past two\n\nseasons.\n\nAnd finally, last Thursday against Washington, O’Bannon scored a\n\ncareer-high 31 points and led the Bruins to an 87-85 victory, after\n\ntrailing by as many as 15 points.\n\nLast year, with no go-to guy, chances are the Bruins would have\n\nlost all four of those tightly contested games. But O’Bannon has\n\nclearly filled that void this season.\n\n\"We know that he’s going to hit the big shot, and that’s what\n\nthe team needed Â­ somebody to go to,\" Johnson said. \"It wasn’t\n\nlike that last year; we were just inconsistent. Sometimes I would\n\nget the ball (in clutch situations), sometimes J.R. would get it,\n\nand sometimes Toby would get it.\"\n\nCount O’Bannon as one player who relishes the thought of holding\n\nthe ball when the game is on the line.\n\n\"That’s the thrill of playing here, and one of the reasons why I\n\ncame here,\" he said, unable to hold back the huge grin that so\n\ndesperately wanted to appear. \"That’s what I get up for; that’s why\n\nI play the game. UCLA vs. Duke, and you have the ball and the game\n\nis close. You can’t draw a better scenario.\n\n\"That’s what I live for, that’s why I love playing this game\n\nÂ­ to play in a game like that.\"\n\n* * *\n\nSo why did it take so long? Why wasn’t O’Bannon around to assume\n\nthe role of leader when the team was so desperately looking for an\n\nanchor at the end of last season, or at the beginning of this\n\none?\n\nLast year, he was expected to naturally inherit the role that\n\nhis brother Ed Â­ with a national championship trophy firmly in\n\nhis grasp and a tremendous shadow left behind Â­ had vacated\n\nthe year before.\n\n\"Last season there was a lot of talk about who was going to lead\n\nthe team. Everyone was asking, ‘Is it going to be the O’Bannon kid\n\nthat steps into the spot?’\" the younger brother remembers. \"I tried\n\nhard last year. I gave it my all. It’s really easy to say that you\n\nwant to be a leader, but it takes a lot of responsibility. It takes\n\na lot more than saying the few words that I want to be captain.\n\n\"You need the respect of your teammates, the respect of your\n\ncoaching staff. You need to prove to yourself and everyone involved\n\nin the program that you’re capable of leading the team.\"\n\nA season ago, it was hard for him to be considered the team\n\nleader when he was suffering the consequences of his misbehavior.\n\nO’Bannon was benched by head coach Jim Harrick in the second half\n\nof the Arizona State game as a result of his third technical foul,\n\nand was benched again for the first half against Duke because of\n\noff-the-court problems.\n\n\"I feel as though my junior year was a learning experience,\" he\n\nsaid. \"For all of the wrongs I did, for all the things I suffered,\n\nI have taken this and learned from that. And it’s made me a better\n\nperson, a stronger man, and I’ve improved in a number of ways.\"\n\nThis season he has had only one technical Â­ and that was\n\nfor hanging on the rim.\n\n\"I’m a lot more mature. As far as off the court, I am more\n\nresponsible, and on the basketball court, my work ethic has\n\nimproved.\"\n\n* * *\n\nO’Bannon points to Dec. 24 as the day it all turned around. The\n\nnight before, he suffered a dismal five-point performance in the\n\nBruins’ 64-57 victory over St. Louis. Two days before that, the\n\nBruins were embarrassed on national television by Illinois,\n\n79-63.\n\nIt was then that he sat down with Ed and his father, Ed Sr., to\n\ndiscuss his future.\n\n\"We discussed what I needed to do to make my dreams come true\n\nÂ­ to play in the NBA,\" O’Bannon said. \"And they basically said\n\nthat if I don’t pick up my play in the next couple months, all this\n\nhard work that I’ve done for the past few years has been for\n\nnothing.\"\n\nIt wasn’t as if he was a bad player. Far from it.\n\nHe had been first-team all-conference the year before, and was\n\naveraging over 15 points a game through the first seven games of\n\nthis season. But the three O’Bannons knew, like everyone else, that\n\nhe could be so much better.\n\nAnd Charles knew just the way to do it. The answer was staring\n\nhim in the face, literally.\n\n\"I think one of my biggest problems was that I had tried so hard\n\nnot to be like (Ed),\" Charles said. \"I tried to prove to everyone\n\nthat I am different from Ed O’Bannon. And I think that was my\n\ndownfall. But, this year I’m trying to do everything that Ed did.\n\nWhy change something that’s good? Why do something opposite of\n\nwhat’s been successful?\n\n\"Just being a younger brother, growing up in another brother’s\n\nshadow, you obviously want to be your own person. But, this year\n\nit’s been only positive. I’ve accepted the leadership role on this\n\nteam like he did. I never try to compare myself with Ed or with his\n\nstats or what he accomplished, but I’m trying to do things very\n\nsimilar to what he did.\"\n\nOne of those things is to come to the court to play Â­ every\n\nday.\n\nSelf-described as never having been a practice player, O’Bannon\n\nhas been consciously trying to step up his effort during\n\nworkouts.\n\nIt hasn’t gone unnoticed by his teammates.\n\n\"People see him playing hard and they know that they’ve got to\n\nplay hard,\" Johnson said. \"It has gotten to the point now where\n\nthey have no choice but to play hard.\"\n\nO’Bannon has finally realized what leadership truly means. A\n\nleader needs to be able to set a good example for others to\n\nfollow.\n\n\"I stepped back and thought about a lot of things that have\n\nhappened, and things I needed to improve on, and that was one of\n\nthem Â­ improving my work ethic during practice,\" he said. \"If\n\nsome of the players take heed and notice that I’m trying to improve\n\nmy game, then maybe they’ll do the same. I didn’t realize the\n\nimpact I would have if I just did the extra things.\"\n\nAnd even though he is not regarded as the team’s vocal leader\n\nÂ­ that role is reserved for point guard Cameron Dollar Â­\n\nO’Bannon has been known to light into players dogging it in\n\npractice, or even off the court.\n\nSteve Lavin has credited his leadership on the court, in the\n\nlocker rooms, in the airports, and in the hotels when the coaches\n\naren’t around, as having a strong impact upon the rest of the\n\nteam.\n\n\"This year, Charles and the other two seniors (Dollar and Bob\n\nMyers) have helped me make the transition, and as a rookie, I am\n\nvery indebted to those three guys,\" Lavin said. \"They are basically\n\nan extension of the coaching staff.\"\n\nAs for his star forward, Lavin knows O’Bannon’s future is\n\nbright.\n\n\"His stock has just shot through the roof,\" Lavin said. \"To me\n\nhe’s playing like a first-team All-American and a potential college\n\nbasketball player of the year. Everyone is standing up taking\n\nnotice of him because he’s playing at a much higher level Â­\n\nhe’s playing with passion, he’s playing with desire, and he’s\n\nhelping his teammates win.\"\n\nOnly two months ago, he may not have even been chosen in the\n\nfirst round of the NBA draft (according to several draft guides),\n\nbut he now ranks among the top prospects in the nation.\n\nA reunion with his brother in Dallas is not inconceivable. Last\n\nyear, the mere thought may have forced Charles to shudder Â­ he\n\nhad already been in the shadows long enough Â­ it is now\n\nsomething he would relish.\n\n\"It would be extremely nice to play with Ed again,\" O’Bannon\n\nsaid. \"But right now, to be honest, it would be nice to play\n\nanywhere in the NBA.\"\n\nBut, before the draft, O’Bannon has some business to finish at\n\nUCLA.\n\nRight now, he has only one city on his mind Â­\n\nIndianapolis.\n\n* * *\n\nThe picture is impossible to ignore. It hangs within short\n\njump-shot range of O’Bannon’s dressing stall in the Bruin locker\n\nroom.\n\nLike O’Bannon, the picture itself has experienced a\n\nmetamorphosis. At the beginning of the season it was an eerie\n\nreminder of what could have been.\n\nBut, today the imposing image represents all that could be.\n\nIt is a picture of Indianapolis’ RCA Dome, site of last year’s\n\nfirst-round disappointment against Princeton, and the site of the\n\nFinal Four less than three weeks away.\n\nAnything other than returning to the site of so many nightmares\n\nand dreams would be considered a disappointment.\n\n\"Without question,\" O’Bannon said. \"We want the\n\nchampionship.\"\n\nAnd when Charles O’Bannon wants something, he is not easily\n\ndenied.\n\nAt least not anymore.\n\nSUSIE MING HWA CHU/Daily Bruin"
