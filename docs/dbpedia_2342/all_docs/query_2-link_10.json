        "text": "Gonzaga head coach Mark Few, asked to assess chief West Coast Conference rival Saint Mary’s, responded with a tone of respect that runs both ways between the programs.\n\n“Saint Mary’s is the same every year, right?” said Few, after the Gaels were picked over his Zags as the WCC favorite, according to the league’s coaches. “Very disciplined, very purposeful with what they do on offense and what they do on defense Just plug ‘em in.”\n\nOne thing is not the same with the Gaels: They return this season coming off back-to-back trips to the second round of the NCAA tournament, something they had not achieved in a decade.\n\nHead coach Randy Bennett, who reached the 500-victory plateau last season, said that experience means everything.\n\n“They’ve seen what it looks like to play in the NCAA tournament two years in a row, win a game,” Bennett said. “”All that stuff, I can’t explain how valuable that is for a coach. These guys have done what it takes and seen what it looks like when you get there.\n\n“I think they’re pretty sharp guys, high-character guys. They can take that and right now they can use it. They get it. Their talk at this time of year is about doing the little things, don’t waste days — the things that truly matter.”\n\nHere’s our preview of the WCC (ranked in order of the coaches poll):\n\n1. SAINT MARY’S\n\n2022-23: 14-2/T-1st in WCC; 27-8 overall\n\nHead Coach: Randy Bennett (507-208 in 23rd season)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 2023 (lost 70-55 to UConn in the second round)\n\nTop returning players: Sophomore guard Aidan Mahaney (13.9 points, 40% 3-point), senior forward Alex Ducas (12.5 points, 41% 3-point), senior center Mitchell Saxen (11.6 points, 7.6 rebounds), junior guard Augustas Marciulionis (5.9 points). Mahaney, Ducas and Saxen all were chosen to the preseason All-WCC team.\n\nTop newcomers: Two Australians could work their way into a veteran rotation, with the arrival of 6-10, 220-pound freshman forward Jensen Bradtke (son of four-time Olympian Mark Bradtke) and 6-5 guard Rory Hawke, who redshirted after enrolling mid-season last year, and is a former U20 national team member. Mason Forbes, a 6-9 transfer from Harvard with Northern California roots, will debut after sitting out last season in Moraga.\n\nKey non-conference games: The Gaels have a rigorous early schedule, including home games against New Mexico (Thursday), Davidson (Nov. 24) and Utah (Nov. 27) and neutral-site matchups vs. San Diego State (Nov. 17) in Las Vegas, Boise State (Dec. 1) in Idaho Falls and UNLV (Dec. 16) in Phoenix at the Jerry Colangelo Classic. The Davidson game will be a rematch of the 2009 NIT second-round game, where Patty Mills (23 points, 10 assists) and the Gaels ended the college career of Steph Curry (26 points) with an 80-68 victory in Moraga.\n\nWhat matters: Saint Mary’s has more high-level experience than any team in the WCC, which explains why Bennett was not surprised the Gaels were chosen as WCC favorites. Ducas and Saxen started every game last year, Mahaney was an impact player from Day 1 and Marciulionis, pushed to the bench when Mahaney emerged, is now his starting backcourt mate. The two combined for 47 points recently in an exhibition win at Hawaii. Look for sophomore forward Joshua Jefferson to crack the rotation.\n\n2. GONZAGA\n\n2022-23: 14-2/T-1st in WCC; 31-6 overall; won WCC Basketball Championship\n\nHead Coach: Mark Few (688-135 in 25th season)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 2023 (lost 82-54 to UConn in the regional final)\n\nTop returning players: Senior forward Anton Watson (11.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 66 steals), junior forward Ben Gregg (5.0 points,3.1 rebounds) and junior guard Nolan Hickman (7.7 points).\n\nTop newcomers: Creighton transfer and junior point guard Ryan Nembhard might be the best newcomer in the WCC. The brother of former Zag and current Indiana Pacer Andrew Nembhard averaged 14.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game in 14 games against ranked teams for the Bluejays. Wyoming transfer Graham Ike at 6-9, 240 pounds, averaged 19.5 points and 9.6 rebounds two seasons ago before missing last year with a leg injury. Jun Seok Yeo, a 6-8 sophomore forward from South Korea, and Luke Krajnovic, a high-scoring guard in the Croatian Premier League, could also have impact.\n\nKey non-conference games: The Zags travel to Honolulu for the relocated Maui Invitational, where they face Purdue on Monday, Nov. 20, and either Tennessee or Syracuse the next day before the event winds up on the day before Thanksgiving. Gonzaga takes on USC in Las Vegas (Dec. 2), Washington in Seattle (Dec. 9), UConn in Seattle (Dec. 15) and San Diego State at home (Dec. 29).\n\nWhat matters: The Zags will look different without WCC all-time scoring king Drew Timme, among four starters who are gone. But no one expects Gonzaga to disappear from view. Watson has played a significant role on four teams with a combined record of 121-13. He is a preseason Julius Erving Award candidate, while newcomers Nembhard (Bob Cousy Award) and Ike (Karl Malone Award) are on similar lists. There are a lot of new parts here but Mark Few generally knows how to assemble them.\n\n3. SAN FRANCISCO\n\n2022-23: 7-9/T-5th in WCC; 20-14 overall\n\nHead Coach: Chris Gerlufsen (20-14 in 2nd season; 28-19 overall in 2 seasons, including as acting coach at Hawaii in 2019-20)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 2022 (lost 92-87 in overtime to Murray State in the first round).\n\nTop returning players: Junior guard Marcus Williams (7.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 41-percent 3-point) and junior forward Isaiah Hawthorne (6.4 points, 3.2 rebounds)\n\nTop newcomers: Mike Shararavjamts, a 6-8, 190-pound guard from Mongolia by way of Dayton, will be fascinating to watch. He reportedly has a versatile skill set and last year made the Atlantic-10 All-Rookie team after averaging 5.6 points and starting 20 games for the Flyers. Other transfers who could get playing time include guards Malik Thomas (USC) and Robby Beasley (Montana), and forwards Stefan Todorovic (SMU) and Jonathan Mobgbo (Missouri State).\n\nKey non-conference games: The Dons have Minnesota of the Big Ten visiting on Nov. 28 at the Chase Center in San Francisco, but most of their non-conference challenges come away from home. That includes at Boise State (Nov. 12), South Carolina or DePaul (Nov. 19) in Phoenix, at Arizona State (Dec. 3), at Vanderbilt (Dec. 8) and Utah State (Dec. 16) in Salt Lake City.\n\nWhat matters: The Dons lost their top three scorers, including the backcourt tandem of Khalil Shabazz (17.8 points) and Tyrell Roberts (16.2) but the roster has experience, size (nine players 6-8 or taller), athleticism and newcomers who will compete to fill vacant roles. Williams and Hawthorne are now juniors and will be expected to shoulder greater responsibility.\n\n4. LMU\n\n2022-23: 9-7/4th in WCC; 19-12 overall\n\nHead Coach: Stan Johnson (43-39 in 4th season)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 1990 (lost 131-101 to UNLV in the regional final)\n\nTop returning players: Senior forward Keli Leaupepe (13.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, 44-percent 3-point), senior forward Alex Merkviladze (7.1 points, 4.0 rebounds).\n\nTop newcomers: Backcourt help comes from senior Justice “Juice” Hill, who is playing at his fourth school in five years, having averaged 5.6 points and 2.7 assists last season at LSU after scoring 13.4 the year before at Murray State. Another new face at guard is Justin Wright, who averaged 16 points at NC Central. Lars Thiemann, a 7-1 center from Germany, played four seasons at California, posting career highs of 9.5 points and 5.4 rebounds last season. Noah Taitz, a perimeter shooter from Stanford, arrived at LMU a year ago but sat out due to injury.\n\nKey non-conference games: The Lions visit the Cayman Islands for three games beginning with Stephen F. Austin on Nov. 19. They take on UNLV (Dec. 9) in Henderson, Nev., and UC Santa Barbara (Dec. 16) in Phoenix at the Jerry Colangelo Classic before getting a home game vs. Colorado State (Dec. 22).\n\nWhat matters: Gone is senior guard Cam Shelton, who led the WCC in scoring and came up huge in wins over Gonzaga (on the road) and Saint Mary’s. Besides staying healthy, Johnson said the key for this team is improving at the defensive end. “The defense has to show up every night,” he said. Leaupepe, who has started 85 career games for LMU and scored more than 1,100 points, said the win at Gonzaga validated everything the team has worked to achieve. “We always believed we could do it,” he said. “But going up there and getting it done was a big thing for us.”\n\n5. SANTA CLARA\n\n2022-23: 11-5, 3rd in WCC; 23-10 overall\n\nHead Coach: Herb Sendek (120-94 in 8th season at Santa Clara; 533-389 in 30th season overall)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 1996 (lost 76-51 to Kansas in the second round)\n\nTop returning players: Grad guard Carlos Marshall Jr. (10.0 points in 3 games), sophomore center Christoph Tilly (5.0 points, 2.7 rebounds).\n\nTop newcomers: Among eight newcomers are five transfers who will be expected to play significant roles. Adama-Alpha Bal, a 6-7 guard and former French U20 national team member, saw limited action in two seasons at Arizona. Francisco Caffaro, a 7-1 native of Argentina, played 92 games at Virginia. Forward Johnny O’Neil (11.3 points, 6.6 rebounds at American U), guard Tyeree Bryan (10.5 points at Charleston Southern) and guard Jalen Benjamin (13.3 points, 4.0 assists at Mount St. Mary’s) also bring veteran resumes.\n\nKey non-conference games: The Broncos play at Stanford (Nov. 14) before trekking to Niceville, Fla., for games against Oregon (Nov. 24) and either Alabama or Ohio State (Nov. 25). They play at California (Dec. 2) and face New Mexico (Dec. 9) in Henderson, Nev. They get Utah State (Dec. 13) at home then travel to Phoenix to face Washington State (Dec. 16) in the Jerry Colangelo Classic.\n\nWhat matters: Santa Clara lost its entire starting lineup and 84 percent of its scoring, including co-WCC Player of the Year Brandin Podziemski, now playing for the Golden State Warriors. So, Sendek will have to mold a largely new squad into a functioning unit. “We’ve really reinvented ourselves,” Sendek said. “But fortunately, we have some really good players returning as well as some guys coming through the door. Right now, we're basically a collection of individuals who are working really hard to become a cohesive team, to carve our roles.” One key player will be Marshall Jr., a former two-time All-Ohio Valley pick at Tennessee State, who played just three games last year before a season-ending injury.\n\n6. PORTLAND\n\n2022-23: 5-11/8th in WCC; 14-19 overall\n\nHead Coach: Shantay Legans (33-34 in 3rd season at Portland; 108-83 in 7th season overall)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 1996 (lost 92-58 to Villanova in the first round)\n\nTop returning players: Senior wing Tyler Robertson (15.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists), senior guard Chris Austin (14.4 points, 4.3 rebounds in 2021-22; DNP in 2022-23 due to injury), sophomore guard Juan Sebastian Gorosito (7.7 points, 40-percent 3-point).\n\nTop newcomers: The most productive transfer is Alimamy Koroma, a 6-8 graduate and 1,000-point career scorer from Cal Poly. Yuto Yamanouchi-Williams, a 6-10 native of Japan, averaged 6.9 points and 7.1 rebounds at Lamar. Grad forward Noah Jordan averaged 11.8 points last season for Division II West Virginia State, and is expected to be a defensive presence. “He brings some attitude, which is something we were missing,” Legans said.\n\nKey non-conference games: The Pilots open with four home games before hitting the road to take on a Nevada team that won 22 games a year ago. Portland plays in the Diamond Head Classic in Hawaii, starting with a Dec. 21 matchup vs. the host school. Awaiting a day later will be either Georgia Tech or UMass.\n\nWhat matters: Portland dealt with injuries and dropped off last season after an encouraging 19-win season in Legans’ debut the year before. The Pilots get a boost from the return Austin who started all 34 games in 2021-22 then missed after missing all of last season with a shin injury. Legans jokingly says he “begged” Robertson to return for a fifth season rather than remain at home in Australia and turn professional. Robertson felt like there was unfinished business at Portland. “Obviously, we didn’t play the way that we’d like to last year, so being able to finish off my college career on a high note was something I wanted to do.\"\n\n7. PEPPERDINE\n\n2022-23: 2-14/10th in WCC; 9-22 overall\n\nHead Coach: Lorenzo Romar (105-137 in 10th season at Pepperdine; 454-377 overall in 27th season)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 2002 (lost 83-74 to Wake Forest in the first round)\n\nTop returning players: Junior guard Houston Mallette (13.0 points, 3.6 rebounds), sophomore forward Jevon Porter (12.1 points, 7.2 rebounds).\n\nTop newcomers: Graduate guard Ethan Anderson, who began his career at USC, averaged 7.9 points and 4.3 rebounds last season at Wyoming. Michael Ajayi 6-7 junior wing, produced big points and rebounds at Pierce Junior College in Washington. Promising freshmen include guard Nils Cooper, wing Curtis Williams and 6-11 Martin Gumwel.\n\nKey non-conference games: UNLV visits Malibu on Nov. 17 before the Waves travel to Henderson, Nev., for the Ball Dawgs Classic, where they take on UC Irvine (Nov. 21), Indiana State (Nov. 22) and New Mexico (Nov. 23). PEP plays at Colorado (Dec. 3) and at Louisville (Dec. 17).\n\nWhat matters: The Waves lost forward Maxwell Lewis (17.1 points, 5.7 rebounds) to the NBA while Mike Mitchell (11.4 points, 5.0 assists) transferred to Minnesota and center Carson Basham (11.4 points, 4.1 rebounds) left for Northern Arizona. The Waves return with Mallette and Porter, both preseason All-WCC picks, and the wisdom that comes through adversity. The Waves knows they must embrace defense and rebounding if they’re going to make a move, and their veteran newcomers should nicely augment the two headline returnees.\n\n8. PACIFIC\n\n2022-23: 7-9/T-5th in WCC; 15-18 overall\n\nHead Coach: Leonard Perry (23-40 in 3rd season at Pacific, 71-137 overall in 8th season)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 2013 (lost 78-49 to Miami in the first round)\n\nTop returning players: Junior guard Tyler Beard (9.1 points, 43-percent 3-point), senior guard Nick Blake (8.6 points), senior guard Donovan Williams (7.1 points, 3.6 rebounds), senior small forward Judson Martindale (6.5 points, 40-percent 3-point), sophomore guard Moe Odum (6.5 points).\n\nTop newcomers: The Tigers are a veteran team but one transfer who could have an impact is senior guard Lesown Hallums Jr., who averaged 10.6 points for South Carolina State.\n\nKey non-conference games: The Tigers play Friday on the road against a California team expected to be much improved, then visit Nevada (Nov. 15) and Fresno State (Dec. 9).\n\nWhat matters: Pacific lost its top three scorers but returns seven players who averaged double-digit minutes and combined to contribute more than 41 points per game. The Tigers shoot well but must improve on the boards, where they were outrebounded by 5.3 per game last season, which ranked last in the WCC. The Tigers hope to parlay balance and experience into a push upward in the conference standings.\n\n9. SAN DIEGO\n\n2022-23: 4-12, 9th in WCC/11-20 overall\n\nHead Coach: Steve Lavin (11-20 in 2nd season at USD; 237-153 in 13th season overall)\n\nMost recent NCAA Tournament appearance: 2008 (lost 72-63 to Western Kentucky in the second round)\n\nTop returning players: Junior guard Wayne McKinney III (7.4 points), junior guard Deuce Turner (6.5 points)\n\nTop newcomers: Among first-year Toreros are 10 freshmen. The outlier is PJ Hayes, a 6-6 senior forward who averaged 8.0 points at Black Hills State. Older teammates cite guards Kevin Patton Jr., Joey Chammaa, Josh Hecht and Keyon Kensie, and forward Jimmy Oladokun Jr. as standouts in practice so far.\n\nKey non-conference games: The Toreros’ top two challenges happen in a four-day span next month when they visit Stanford (Dec. 3) and Utah State (Dec. 6).\n\nWhat matters: McKinney started 24 games and scored double digits seven times last year but the Toreros lost five players, including Marcellus Earlington (17.3 points, 6.8 rebounds), who accounted for nearly 70 percent of the team’s scoring. So the USD rebuild virtually starts from scratch in Year 2 under Lavin, who is sure to mix and match combinations of players early in the season to find the best rotation. He likes his team’s speed, length and quickness but understands there is a lot about the squad he still doesn’t know."
