        "text": "The DoM Clinical Research Core would like to thank Jennifer Germain who will be leaving UMass Chan at the end of this month. Jennifer served as the Director of Clinical Operations for the Clinical Research Core since its inception. She has been crucial in supporting clinical trial development, staffing, and regulatory guidance, and has served as a tremendous leader and mentor for the clinical research coordinators throughout the department.\n\nThe Core team wishes Jennifer all the best in her future position with Beth Israel Lahey Health Network.\n\nDavid Smelson, PsyD, professor of medicine in the Division of Health Systems Science, has been awarded a 2024 National Institutes of Health HEAL Initiative Award for Mentorship. The NIH HEAL Award for Mentorship recognizes HEAL-funded researchers who demonstrate exceptional commitment to the development and mentorship of early career scientists in the pain and addiction research fields. Dr. Smelson was awarded this honor for his commitment to creating a supportive environment, demonstrating integrity, and commitment to inclusion and diversity to help prepare researchers to become mentors in the future.\n\nWe congratulate Dr. Smelson on this honor.\n\nLearn more.\n\nIn an Opinion article, published in Trends in Immunology earlier this month, Stefania Gallucci, MD, professor of medicine in the Division of Innate Immunity and faculty in the Program in Innate Immunity, proposes that extracellular DNA (eDNA), a crucial component of the matrix of most biofilms, is a universal ID (identity card) that the immune system uses to recognize biofilms.\n\nMost bacteria can form biofilms which are complex fortresses against a hostile environment. Recurrent and chronic infections are associated with forming biofilms that are resistant to antibiotics and pose a major challenge in treating recalcitrant bacterial infections.\n\nUnderstanding whether and how the immune system recognizes the presence of biofilms is important so that we can improve therapeutic approaches to biofilm-carrying infections.\n\nRead the full publication.\n\nFiachra Humphries, PhD, recently had his study titled, “ECSIT Facilitates Memory CD8+ T Cell Development by Mediating Fumarate Synthesis During Viral Infection and Tumorigenesis,” published in Nature Cell Biology. The study focuses on how certain immune cells, called memory CD8+ T cells, help the body fight against tumors. Dr. Humphries and his team discovered a protein called ECSIT that is crucial for the formation of memory CD8+ T cells and helps produce a substance called fumarate inside T cells, which activates a specific gene program controlled by a protein called TCF-1.\n\nDr. Humphries and his team also found that higher levels of ECSIT in T cells are associated with a particular type of memory CD8+ T cells and cancer patients with higher levels of ECSIT tend to have better survival rates. When the team restored the levels of fumarate in T cells that lacked ECSIT using fumarate-based therapeutics, the T cells regained their ability to fight tumors effectively. This finding suggests that fumarate-based treatments could be used to enhance the function of CD8+ T cells in the tumor environment and improve the effectiveness of checkpoint immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment.\n\nRead the full publication.\n\nJay-Hyuck Shim, PhD, associate professor of medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, along with his co-PI, Julia Alterman, PhD of RNA Therapeutics, has received a Pilot Project Program award from the UMass Center for Clinical and Translational Science for their project titled, “Development of a Novel RNA Interference as a Therapeutic Agent for Rheumatoid Arthritis.”\n\nFor their project, they aim to develop a novel siRNA-based therapy that suppresses inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis while promoting the healing of inflammation-induced bone loss. Specifically, Dr. Shim’s work will focus on the development of a bone-anabolic siRNA that targets endogenous bone-forming suppressor Schnurri-3 and an anti-inflammatory siRNA that targets interleukin-1 signaling.\n\nLara Kovell, MD, recently received a K23 award from the National Institutes of Health’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to study the development of a mobile health intervention for blood pressure management in pregnancy. Dr. Kovell aims to develop the digital health approach, “Moms@Home”, to support home blood pressure monitoring for women with hypertension during pregnancy. Using this approach, Dr. Kovell will work to improve the quality and cultural relevance of hypertension care by examining the effects of Moms@Home on home blood pressure monitoring in a diverse population of pregnant women with hypertension.\n\nDr. Kovell will be joined by experienced mentors on the study including David McManus, MD, ScM, the Richard M.

McDonough Chair in Rheumatology, chief of the Division of Rheumatology, co-director of the Lupus Center, and professor of medicine, recently received a $1.2 million award from the Lupus Research Alliance to support the development of a biorepository and registry at the Lupus Center at UMass Chan. The Lupus Landmark Study and research biorepository, Lupus Nexus, was launched by the Lupus Research Alliance and its clinical research affiliate Lupus Therapeutics, with UMass Chan being one of the first seven to participate. As a contributor to the design of the repository, Dr. Caricchio aims to enroll enough patients to provide sufficient materials for scientists and clinical investigators to pursue projects that will result in a better understanding of the disease.\n\n\"Lupus is a very diverse disease from a clinical point of view and from a human point of view. Unfortunately, many lupus patients don't respond to approved medications. We need to take care of those patients and understand why they're not responding to treatment. That's why these biorepositories are so important,\" said Dr. Caricchio.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nThis month, we feature Irina Radu, MD, MHA, as our Postdoc Spotlight. Dr. Radu is a postdoctoral research fellow in the lab of Dr. Khanh-Van Tran in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine and co-president of the UMass Chan Postdoctoral Association.\n\n\"To me, UMass Chan has proven to be the ideal environment for growth—a place where you can find support for your innovative ideas and where you can transform dreams into reality.\"\n\nRead the full spotlight.\n\nThis month in our Graduate Student Spotlight, we feature Mingqi Dong, a student in the Fitzgerald lab and the Immunology and Microbiology Program at UMass Chan.\n\n\"I’m currently studying the cellular and molecular landscape changes in the brain when a fundamental antiviral pathway in microglia goes rogue.

Dr. Kovell also serves as the director of the Internal Medicine Residency Research Track and is the inaugural director of the Women’s Pregnancy and Heart Disease Clinic.\n\n\"We have worked with many incredible women in the Worcester community, who have been willing to share their own stories about their own devastating complications related to hypertension and preeclampsia. Their selfless dedication to support others impacted by hypertension and our research inspires and fuels me to continue this work to improve the care of hypertension in pregnancy.\"\n\nRead the full spotlight.\n\nPulmonary Care at UMass Memorial Health has been ranked as one of the best in their specialty area in a new ranking out last week from Healthgrades. Healthgrades ranked hospitals in 32 states in 18 specialties to determine the Specialty State Rankings. Congratulations to the Pulmonary team!\n\nRead the full article.\n\nChristopher Marshall, MD, clinical chief, and assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology, was featured in an article by Everyday Health titled, “What Should I Cook if I Have Heartburn?” In the article, Dr. Marshall and other contributors discuss ways to adjust eating habits to lower the risk of heartburn. He explains that an important first step to minimize heartburn is identifying individual triggers, as different foods can trigger heartburn for different people. He adds that one common cause of heartburn is fatty foods, as the fat can coax stomach acid into the esophagus, causing discomfort.\n\n“If someone says they eat a big greasy meal and they get heartburn, the first thing they can do is not do that,” said Dr. Marshall.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nSamir Malkani, MD, clinical chief and professor of medicine, and Amin Sabet, MD, assistant professor of medicine, of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, were featured in yesterday’s Boston 25 News report, “Weight-Loss Wonder Drugs: Mass. Doctors Explain Who Should be Really Taking Them.”\n\nDrs. Malkani and Sabet discussed the growing popularity of medications such as Ozempic, originally introduced for diabetes, but later proven to assist with weight loss. They explained that although taking these drugs can lead to significant weight loss, all of the medications have risks and potential side effects that need to be discussed with patients.\n\n“I don’t have a hesitation of prescribing it as long as the person really understands what it’s all about and what the effects could be,” said Dr. Sabat. “It’s a very exciting field. People who didn’t have a lot of great options before, we’re seeing great options for them.”\n\nWatch the report.\n\nThe Division of Health Systems Science is pleased to announce that as of January 1, 2024, Mitch Gitkind, MD, professor of medicine and surgery, and assistant dean for GME quality and patient safety education, will be serving in the role of Interim Advisor for Health Systems Science Education and Quality Scholarship.Through this role, Dr. Gitkind will assist in expanding Health Systems Science education-related opportunities at the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty levels at UMass Chan. Dr. Gitkind received his medical degree from UMass Chan Medical School and completed his internship and residency at the Memorial Campus of UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMMC) (formerly known as Worcester Memorial Hospital). He completed a fellowship in gastroenterology through Tufts University School of Medicine. His current clinical focus is obesity medicine and bariatric surgery.\n\nHe has held multiple positions in hospital administration at UMMMC, including associate chief quality officer and associate chief medical officer. He is an experienced educator, having mentored over 100 quality improvement projects for faculty and trainees, and has developed and delivered curriculum on QI, patient safety, conflict resolution, and clinical topics. In 2017, Dr. Gitkind became an assistant dean, and assumed responsibility for the development and support of QI, patient safety, and health care disparities curriculum for the school’s more than 600 residents and fellows in ACGME-approved programs. From 2019 through 2023, he was part of the leadership team that oversaw the creation of “Vista,” a new three-pillar undergraduate medical education curriculum that added health systems science to the T.H. Chan School of Medicine’s MD programs.\n\nCongratulations Dr. Gitkind on this new role!\n\nEach year the Primary Care Track of the Internal Medicine Residency holds an off-campus retreat for residents to learn about and discuss a topic of particular importance and relevance to their training. This full-day event is a unique opportunity for them to step outside the clinical setting to engage in meaningful dialogue together and with invited speakers. This year’s retreat, to be held in March, will focus on gender-affirming care.\n\nElizabeth Murphy, MD, program director of the Primary Care Track and associate professor of medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine, is organizing the retreat and chose this topic for a variety of reasons. “I've had residents in the past who have told me that [a patient] opened up to them in a visit and said, ‘I want to live my life as a different gender,’ and they were afraid or didn't know what to say or do,” said Dr. Murphy. “We want to make sure that our residents, if presented with this situation, can provide care that is supportive and warm—and even if they don't have all the answers, they know where to go to find them. That’s my main goal.”\n\nThis year’s retreat will feature Stephen Dunn, DO, a graduate of the Internal Medicine Residency at UMass Chan, primary care physician, and director of medical education at Fenway Health in Boston, who will speak about primary care for LGBTQI patients including health screening for transgender patients and prescribing hormones to transgender patients. Speakers will also include patients and family members, Joy Lee, PhD, a researcher from PQHS, and Nadine Smith, a speech and language pathologist who cares for transgender patients. Dr. Murphy is currently working to finalize additional guest speakers including physicians, researchers, and other members of the UMass Chan/UMMH community.\n\nAs she plans this day, Dr. Murphy is grateful for the support she has received from leadership in the Department of Medicine, in particular, Deborah Blazey-Martin, MD, MPH, vice chair for ambulatory affairs in the Department of Medicine, chief of General Internal Medicine, and associate professor of medicine. “Dr. Blazey-Martin has been incredibly supportive as we build this program into the track,” said Dr. Murphy.\n\nDr. Murphy is passionate about gender-affirming care in her roles as a physician, educator, and advocate but, most importantly, in her role as an aunt. “One of the reasons that I'm so interested in this is that I have a transgender niece, and before I experienced her transition, this was extremely foreign to me,” said Dr. Murphy. “I watched my niece be so sad as the little boy that she was born as and always knowing that she was a girl… and [now that she has transitioned] is a spectacularly beautiful person in all aspects. For me, that was the most transformative thing. If I can help other providers who have not experienced the positive impact when someone can safely and effectively transition, then that is an important goal for me.”\n\nIn late 2023, Geriatric Medicine welcomed its first ambulatory physician lead (APL), Linsey Barker, DO, to help guide the geriatric clinic as its team continues to grow. Dr. Barker, a clinician and assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine, enthusiastically took on this new role, and aims to help strengthen processes by thinking creatively and working collaboratively with all members of the clinic.\n\n“[The geriatrics clinic] is very much a team-based model. We recognize that when we are caring for older adult patients who may have more medical complexity and other things that need to be taken into consideration, we need to take a team-based approach,” said Dr. Barker. “Having just started recently at UMass, I am still figuring out processes, but I am excited. I work [in the clinic] regularly and get to see what works well and maybe areas where we could continue to improve upon, especially as our group is growing.”\n\nDr. Barker also recognizes and is appreciative of the wealth of knowledge and experience that surrounds her as she establishes herself in her practice and as the clinic’s first APL. “A lot of my colleagues have been here for a while and really know what's worked before and what hasn't, so it is great to be able to have conversations with them and get their feedback.”\n\nDr. Barker’s passion for her work as a geriatrician and team-based care was seeded early in her medical training and flourished during her internal medicine residency at UMass Chan. Although her intention was always to pursue a career in geriatric medicine, Dr. Barker’s interests grew while rotating with the geriatrics group. In the clinic, she spent time learning from and working with Dr. Erika Zimmons. She was also able to work with Dr. Jerry Gurwitz on various research projects. “[Dr. Gurwitz] was a great mentor and strongly advocated for me to pursue a career in geriatrics,” said Dr. Barker.\n\nAfter Dr. Barker completed her chief residency, she chose to pursue her fellowship training at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston so that she could experience how geriatric medicine was practiced in an environment with a different patient population. Her training there enriched her learning and broadened her perspectives, which she hopes to incorporate as she establishes her practice in Worcester. As Dr. Barker embarks upon her career and new role as APL, she is excited for what the future holds. “I'm always trying to think about ways that we could think differently or get creative, so I’m very excited to be in this role.”\n\nDr. Barker earned her medical degree at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine. She completed her internal medicine residency and chief residency in internal medicine at UMass Chan Medical School and her fellowship in geriatric medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Dr. Barker joined the faculty at UMass Chan/UMass Memorial Health in August 2023.\n\nIn this month’s Resident Spotlight, we highlight Anna Gubala, MD, a third-year Internal Medicine resident on the research track. Here, Dr. Gubala describes her research interests, her involvement with different groups and activities at UMass Chan, and her favorite activities in the Worcester area.\n\n\"UMass Chan is a great place to train for residency because of the supportive and wonderful community of residents and physicians, as well as the high clinical volume and sick patients.\"\n\nRead Dr. Gubala's full spotlight.\n\nIn this month’s Fellowship Spotlight, we highlight Qadija Qadri, MD, an Infectious Diseases and Immunology fellow. Here, Dr. Qadri describes her clinical and research interests, why she chose UMass for her fellowship, and why New England is her favorite vacation spot!\n\n\"UMass is a leading institution providing fellows with an opportunity for outstanding experiences.

Her inpatient work focuses on cardiac critical care, and in her outpatient cardiology clinics, she sees a full spectrum of patients on the University campus and at Shrewsbury Internal Medicine. We recently had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Carlson, learn more about her work as a cardiologist, and, in alignment with February’s American Heart Health Month, pick up some important tips for improving heart health for ourselves and our families.\n\n“I think that a lot of times with diet and healthy food choices, [physicians] talk about things to avoid. I tell my patients to try to have five fruits or vegetables in a day, so rather than thinking, ‘I can't have that’ which can be discouraging and hard to maintain, I ask them to make sure that they’ve prioritized healthy foods first.”\n\nRead Dr. Carlson's full spotlight.\n\nCongratulations to Jeffrey Stoff, MD, Professor Emeritus of the Department of Medicine and chief of Renal Medicine, on his retirement! Friends, family, and colleagues gathered to celebrate and show their gratitude to Dr. Stoff on Thursday, February 1. We wish him the very best in his future endeavors!\n\nHappy New Year from the DoM Clinical Research Core.

In the article titled, “Do Fainter Lines on Home COVID Tests Mean You’re Getting Better?”, Dr. Soni and other contributors discuss COVID-19 tests and their ability to indicate the severity of the infection. They explain that the darker the lines appear on a COVID test, the more infection is present. However, tests that show fainter lines are said to contain fewer antigens, meaning the virus is less present in the body. Dr. Soni notes that human error is an important part of how much we can learn by looking at the intensity of tests. He further explains that carefully swabbing for a sample would collect more antigens, therefore producing a clearer result. From there, the patient can interpret whether their infection is more or less severe.\n\nLearn more.\n\nTimothy P. Fitzgibbons, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, was interviewed in a Boston Globe article titled, “Two People Have Died After Drinking Panera’s ‘Charged’ Beverages. Is Marketing to Blame?”. The article describes Panera’s newest caffeinated drinks and the dangers they pose to customers with preexisting health conditions. Two customers died after consuming the drinks, both with preexisting health conditions. \"I’m almost certain they didn’t realize how much caffeine was in the beverage,” stated Dr. Fitzgibbons. He continued that the amount of caffeine in the “charged” beverages is too much, even for a person without any underlying health conditions.\n\nLearn more.\n\nDuring January and February, the Annals of Internal Medicine is highlighting a list of the most influential articles published in 2023. Included, is the July 2023 article, “Performance of Rapid Antigen Tests to Detect Symptomatic and Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection – A Prospective Cohort Study,” by investigators in the Department of Medicine and the Program in Digital Medicine, colleagues from the Departments of Emergency Medicine, Microbiology and Physiological Systems, and Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at UMass Chan, the UMass Center for Clinical & Translational Science, and collaborators from Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, as well as government and industry.\n\nThe study evaluated the performance of rapid antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants and included over 7,000 participants from throughout the United States. Investigators found that the performance of rapid antigen tests were optimized when asymptomatic participants tested three times and when symptomatic participants tested two times, both at 48-hour intervals.\n\nAuthors from the Department of Medicine and/or Program in Digital Medicine included Apurv Soni, MD, PhD, Honghuang Lin, PhD, Biqi Wang, PhD, David D. McManus, MD, ScM, Laura Gibson, MD, Nisha Fahey, DO, ScM, and Laurel O’Connor, MD.\n\n“…COVID-19 seemed to settle into its endemic period, no longer dominating the news or our pages but still inspiring science to move forward with better understanding of treatments, long-term effects of infection, and mitigation strategies,” said Christine Laine, MD, MPH, editor and chief of Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nCongratulations to all who were involved in this study!\n\nLearn more.\n\nHarris Feldman, MD, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Program in Digital Medicine under the mentorship of Apurv Soni, MD, PhD, has been selected as the 2024 TL1 Postdoctoral Trainee for his project titled, “Characterization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flares using Electronic Medical Record and Home-based Collection of Data and Identifying Multimodal Predictors of Flares.”\n\nThis award, issued by the UMass Center for Clinical & Translational Science, will assist Dr. Feldman as he furthers his training in digital medicine and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\nLearn more about the TL1 training award.\n\nStefania Gallucci, MD, professor of medicine in the Division of Innate Immunity, recently received R21 funding from the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for her project titled, “Reprogramming of the Innate Immunometabolism by Bacterial Biofilms.”\n\nIn this project, Dr. Gallucci will explore the innate immune response against bacterial biofilms through the characterization of the transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in dendritic cells (DC) upon recognition of bacterial amyloids. She hopes to reveal new metabolic pathways as novel therapeutic candidates, starting with the purine pathway, an understudied pathway in DC biology, to strengthen innate responses against biofilm-driven infections.\n\nLisa Cavacini, PhD, professor of medicine in the Division of Innate Immunity, was recently awarded funding from the Department of Defense, for her project, “Preclinical Development of an Oral Nanobody Prophylactic to Prevent Diarrheal Disease.” Her project focuses on Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the leading bacterial cause of diarrhea-associated illness in developing countries. Those most at risk for ETEC infection are infants and young children, as well as travelers to endemic countries, including military personnel. It is estimated by the World Health Organization that yearly ETEC causes about 220 million episodes of diarrhea globally. Infection occurs when the bacteria colonizes the host small intestine and then produces toxins that stimulate the lining of the small intestine to secrete excessive fluid, leading to watery diarrhea. According to Dr. Cavacini, recent studies suggest that effective protection against ETEC may be achieved by inducing immunity to bacterial fimbrial adhesins, which are proteins that facilitate adhesion of the bacteria to the intestinal lining. Dr. Cavacini additionally notes that the major difficulty in creating an adhesin-based vaccine is the diversity of ETEC strains and despite years of effort by the military, there still is no licensed vaccine against any pathogenic ETEC strains.\n\nWith this grant, Dr. Cavacini and her team propose an alternative, and complementary, approach in oral, pre-exposure prophylaxis with novel IgA antibodies that are active against all major pathogenic ETEC strains. The team has established the proof of concept in nonhuman primates with a strain specific secretory IgA antibody. More recently, she and her team have discovered a panel of unique nanobodies or VHH antibodies that have significant cross-protective activity. The goal of the project is to develop these nanobodies as IgA proteins which are stable, long-lasting, and administered orally to prevent ETEC infection. Additionally, the project will address an unprecedented medical need of ETEC prophylactic measures and potentially impact thousands of people worldwide, while contributing to the decreasing rates of morbidity and mortality caused by ETEC each year.\n\nDavid McManus, MD, ScM, the Richard M. Haidack Professor of Medicine and chair in the Department of Medicine, recently received T32 funding from the NIH's National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute for his project titled, “CardiOvascular Digital hEalth Research (CODER) Training Program.” The CODER T32 training program aims to develop postdoctoral investigators with expertise in cardiovascular digital health by bringing together highly skilled and collaborative training faculty from multiple disciplines, with the ultimate goal of developing and equitably implementing novel digital health solutions that improve the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disorders.\n\nCODER is a collaboration between the Departments of Medicine and Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, and leverages the diverse and progressive environment at UMass Chan Medical School to provide a dynamic transdisciplinary, translational research training infrastructure for postdoctoral fellows who aspire to be independent investigators and team scientists in digital health research, specifically for implementing novel solutions that will improve cardiovascular health in an equitable manner. The program supports collaboration among trainees at MD and PhD levels, bringing patient-oriented digital health researchers, community, population, and data scientists, together with bioinformatics experts and industry, to enhance and expedite advances in cardiovascular research.\n\nDr. McManus will co-direct this T32 training program with Dr. Ben Gerber, division chief of Health Informatics and Implementation Science in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences.\n\nIn this month’s Researcher Spotlight, we feature the work of Mayuko Ito Fukunaga, MD, MSc, a physician and assistant professor of medicine in the Divisions of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine and Health Systems Science, and co-chair of the Cancer Screening Researcher Subcommittee at UMass Chan Medical School.

Their project focused on overall obesity management in primary care and they found that very few patient appointments were made for obesity management. They surveyed providers on the primary challenges of managing obesity and although it was found to be a significant problem, the medical complexity of patients and resource limitations made it difficult for providers to appropriately address the issue. Many providers requested an embedded metabolic clinic to focus on weight management and weight stabilization for patients, leading to the development of today’s Weight Management Program.\n\nWith encouragement and support from providers such as Nina Rosano, MD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Bruce Weinstein, MD, associate professor of medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and Deborah Blazey-Martin, MD, vice chair for ambulatory affairs and chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine, Drs. Subramanian and Ayyaswami developed the program with the goal of serving patients with weight issues and high blood pressure, along with other comorbidities. Additionally, they wanted to focus on how weight impacts the patient’s health and how they can work to maintain a healthier weight and lifestyle.\n\nAlthough the program is still in its beginning stages, work in the clinic is conducted on Monday mornings, where Drs. Subramanian and Ayyaswami alternate enrolling patients into the program, establishing a plan based on their medical history, and coordinating with other departments and services as needed, such as Behavioral Health and Endocrinology. The Weight Management Program has been well-received throughout the Benedict clinic. Dr. Subramanian explains that as the program expands, multidisciplinary collaboration between primary care providers and sub-specialists will be important. “Getting a nutritional aspect and an exercise aspect to this will be very important additions,” stated Dr. Subramanian. “[Additionally] having someone who has expertise in advocating for activity for these patients depending on their weight are all important aspects.”\n\nThe team also hopes to provide the necessary resources to keep patients on a healthy track for the future. “Weight management and obesity are going to fall into the lap of primary care providers. The more primary care providers that [become] familiar with this [program] the better it is,” said Dr. Subramanian.\n\nOver the last few months, we have featured patient flow initiatives in Medicine that aim to increase patient discharges by noon and 2 p.m. These initiatives are critical to improving quality of care, overall patient safety, and timely care progression.\n\nThis month, we are featuring the Cohorted Unit-Based Teams initiative that launched in early June 2023—specifically, the pulmonary medicine unit on 5 West led by Shahzad Khan, MD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of the Cohorted Unit-Based Teams initiative has been to establish effective flow for patients to be discharged in a timely manner through coordinated team care. This, in turn, allows for patients who are in the emergency room and need a bed to be transferred to the floor for care. On 5 West, Dr. Khan and his team accomplish this through multidisciplinary rounds which include meeting with individuals from the health care team (usually a second-year or senior resident), nursing management, case management, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and a COPD nurse navigator. During these meetings, they discuss patients and establish a care progression plan together, rather than having what might be at least six or seven individual conversations with different team members. Dr. Khan and his team are able to identify what is needed to allow the patient to be discharged and coordinate a plan together. They aim to have the patient discharged during the day for a variety of reasons including ensuring they stay on track with medications (if they are discharged at night, the pharmacy might be closed and they could miss their medication for that day). It has also helped with various logistical factors in transitioning the patients home, including transportation.\n\nOverall, the initiative has seen positive results thus far. Prior to the initiative, the pulmonary service placed discharge orders before noon on 19% of discharges. The team is now discharging one-third of their patients before noon. By working closely with the nurse manager, Viet Le, and case manager, Steven Nordborg, who have been critical to the success of this initiative, Dr. Khan has also been able to steadily increase the number of patients discharged before 2 p.m. over the last several months. There has also been a steady trend in decreasing the length of stay on the unit.\n\n“It's been a big effort even though it seems like a small thing. It has taken a lot of work from hospital leadership and communicating with different services to come together and focus on this one thing and with all these moving parts,” said Dr. Khan. “It is impressive how quickly it has moved forward and how infrequent there are hiccups because everyone is willing to figure out the next step.”\n\nIn this month’s Resident Spotlight, we highlight Garrick Gu, MD, a second-year Internal Medicine resident.

They found that transcriptional control of enzymes that break down these molecules is required for pathogen resistance. These data define a new link between nutrient acquisition, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection, and reveal a novel pathway that may be targeted to promote survival during bacterial infection.\n\n“I am extremely proud of Mo’s and Nick’s accomplishments in my lab,” said Dr. Pukkila-Worley. “They are both outstanding MD/PhD students and their collaboration on this project was a lot of fun for me to be a part of.”\n\nThe Pukkila-Worley laboratory investigates host-pathogen interactions and bacterial pathogenesis, with a primary focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen.

Dr. Michaelidis was celebrated for delivering exceptional patient care and for building and improving the hospital-at-home program.\n\nVaikom Mahadevan, MD, the Edward Budnitz, MD, Professor in Cardiovascular Medicine and chief of Cardiovascular Medicine, and an expert in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) was recently consulted for consideration of transcatheter pulmonic valve replacement. The patient who had a history of congenital pulmonary stenosis, had undergone open repair at the age of 9 months. They subsequently underwent a surgical pulmonic valve replacement in 2021, and three months following surgery were anemic and began IV and oral iron replacement. The anemia progressed and the patient started requiring regular blood transfusions. After extensive hematology evaluation, the patient was found to have hemolysis with no other identifiable cause apart from the bioprosthetic heart valve. The patient also had an echocardiogram that suggested moderate pulmonary regurgitation and had some right heart failure symptoms, along with hypoalbuminemia. Records were obtained from the referring hospital and a telehealth appointment was made to evaluate the patient. Ultimately after consultation with Dr. Mahadevan and his team, a plan was made for the patient to undergo a transcatheter pulmonic valve-in-valve procedure at UMass Memorial Medical Center. In addition to Dr. Mahadevan, structural heart coordinators Ashleigh Poptic, ACNP-BC, and Nicole Majkut, PA-C, along with catheterization laboratory members Sue Maddelena, Tara Zidonis, Raul Navarro, and Stephanie Costello, worked to coordinate resources, appropriate equipment, and perform staff education in preparation for the procedure.\n\nIn mid-September, the patient was pre-admitted under the care of Kevin O’Day, MD. They were then transferred to the cath lab for transcatheter tricuspid valve‐in‐valve (TPViV) implantation with the team led by Dr. Mahadevan, and including Jennifer Walker, MD, of Cardiac Surgery, Nikolaos Kakouros, MD, PhD, director of the structural heart disease program and co-director of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement program, and Dr. Ujjwal Rastogi, a structural heart fellow. The cardiac anesthesia team led by Dr. Brian Gebhardt provided anesthesia support. Procedural staff included Dan Niemi, RT, Mary Blair, RN, and Ivette Bryan-Picard, RN.\n\nThe procedure and recovery went very well, and the patient was discharged the following day.

The idea emerged from pre-pandemic conversations between Greg Leslie, MD, physician, assistant professor of medicine, clinical and interim division chief, and Michael Devine, DO, physician and assistant professor of medicine, both of Hospital Medicine, and subsequent discussions with fellow hospitalists. At the time, they had observed that while resident teams in the division had trainees who could perform bedside procedures such as lumbar punctures, paracenteses, and arterial punctures for blood draws because it was part of their training, nonresident teams were left to call on others for assistance. Drs. Leslie and Devine thought that if they could create a service where hospitalists were trained and credentialed to perform these procedures it would help with some of the flow challenges. They put a call out to fellow hospitalists to identify a core group who were interested in getting credentialed and were pleasantly met with enthusiasm. “It's been really fun to build this up,” said Dr. Devine, who currently serves as the director of the Procedural Service. “We had a whole spectrum of attendings at various levels in our division that have wanted to be part of this, from senior, decorated faculty to junior faculty that were interested in [learning and getting credentialed] in these procedures.”\n\nWith a core group of seven hospitalists credentialed to perform these procedures, they have started to have a noticeable impact on patient flow. “The biggest benefit of this Procedural team is that it allows for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures to happen as quickly as possible in order to let the teams advance the care plan, ” said Dr. Leslie.\n\nLearn more about the Procedural Service.\n\nIn this month’s Chair’s Spotlight, we highlight the work of Doreen Brettler, MD, a physician and professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology.

Mohan was proudly supporting the fight against cancer and promoting Lupus study trials at UMass Chan.\n\nUMass Chan Medical School recently received an $8.9 million award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for renewed support of their initiative to advance the development of home-based and point-of-care health technologies. The Center for Advancing Point of Care Technologies (CAPCaT) in Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders, which was created as an offshoot of the Massachusetts Medical Device Development Center (M2D2) at UMass Lowell and UMass Chan, is one of the seven centers nationwide that received five-year awards as part of the NIH’s Point of Care Technology Research Network.\n\nLed by co-principal investigators David McManus, MD, ScM, the Richard M. Haidack Professor of Medicine, chair and professor of medicine in the Department of Medicine, and Dr. Nathaniel Hafer, of Molecular Medicine, CAPCaT has supported over 20 projects since receiving funding in 2018 and aims to support new tools to address heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders in underserved populations.\n\nSpeaking to UMass Chan news, Dr. McManus said, “There’s what’s considered a ‘valley of death’ in the development of technologies between the time when someone comes up with a really good idea and starting a company, but they need resources to evaluate the technology and develop it. Few companies actually make it…CAPCaT’s goal is to identify that earlier-stage company, which is high risk but potentially high reward, bring in regulatory expertise and commercialization experts, and brainstorm with the team about other applications of the technology.”\n\nLearn more about CAPCaT.\n\nHonghuang Lin, PhD, professor of medicine in the Division of Health Systems Science and a director in the Program in Digital Medicine, had his study titled “Association Between Electrocardiographic Age and Cardiovascular Events in Community Settings: The Framingham Heart Study,” featured in the USA Today article “How One’s Health Study, inspired by FDR’s death, Changed Life in America Forever,” as part of the Framingham Heart Study’s 75th anniversary. The Framingham Heart Study has changed how Americans and their doctors view heart disease over the course of three generations.\n\nDr. Lin's study applied a deep neural network model to predict biological age from standard 12-lead ECG collected in the Framingham Heart Study and included 9,877 participants with 17 plus-minus 8 years of follow-up. Accelerated aging was found to be associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.14-1.45), as well as multiple adverse cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting the potential of an ECG-based age predictor as a scalable biomarker of future cardiovascular risk.\n\nRead the USA Today article.\n\nPRISM program clinical research coordinator, Daniel Mbusa, BS, was inspired to pursue a career in medicine and clinical research through formative experiences in high school.

In a new conversation with Dr. Devine, he discusses the drivers of this initiative, results thus far, and goals for future applications.\n\n“[In our initial pilot], we specifically looked at the metric of discharge orders before noon because when we initially reviewed the data, we found that the resident teams were about 10% lower than uncovered attendings…[We] decided the goal for our internal medicine resident teams would be to improve discharge by noon to around 25% from 15%. Over the last year, our residents were able to reach that goal.”\n\nRead Dr. Devine's full interview.\n\nIn this month’s Chair’s Spotlight, we highlight the work of Sarah McGee, MD, MPH, clinical chief and a professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine, whose career has spanned more than 30 years. We recently spoke with Dr. McGee about her work and what makes her chosen field of practice unique.\n\nRead Dr. McGee's full interview.\n\nFiachra Humphries, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Innate Immunity and faculty in the Program in Innate Immunity, recently had a commentary published in Trends in Immunology, titled, “cGAS-like receptors: back to the future.” cGAS and STING are important innate immune receptors that drive immune responses to cytosolic DNA, have been implicated in a wide range of inflammatory diseases, and are now the focus of drug discovery efforts. Recent computational and biochemical studies have identified ancient forms of cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) that play key roles in bacterial immunity. In this Spotlight article, Dr. Humphries and his team discuss a recent study published in Cell that builds on these findings that constructed and characterized >3000 cGLRs to reveal conserved mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing across the animal kingdom.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Humphries and his team discuss potential implications for human immunity and how studying these ancient forms of cGAS and STING can inform future work on uncharacterized cGAS-like receptors in the human genome.\n\nRead Dr. Humphries' paper.\n\nLauren Feld, MD, physician and assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology and physician executive for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging in the Department of Medicine, recently had her study titled, “Parental leave, childcare policies, and workplace bias for hepatology professionals: A national survey,” published in Hepatology Communications. Here, Dr. Feld and her team aimed to understand the presence of workplace bias around child-rearing and inadequate parental leave, which may negatively impact childbearing decisions and gender equity in hepatology. Additionally, her team sought to understand the influence of parental leave and child-rearing on career advancement in hepatology. The physician members of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) were surveyed regarding career plans, family planning, parental leave, and work accommodations. Dr. Feld and her team identified that women reported gender-based and maternity bias in the workplace and during training, which was more frequently experienced by Black and Hispanic women. As two-thirds of women had children during training, Dr. Feld identified that medical training is a particularly influential time to provide programmatic support to address long-term gender disparities in career advancement. Dr. Feld runs the Feld Lab at UMass, which studies interventions to improve workforce gender equity as well as women’s health in liver disease.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nKate Fitzgerald, PhD, the Worcester Foundation Chair in Biomedical Sciences, professor of medicine, chief of the Division of Innate Immunity, vice chair for research in the Department of Medicine, and director of the Program in Innate Immunity, recently had a collaborative study, “Development of LB244, an Irreversible STING Antagonist,” published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Led by Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Paul Thompson from the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biotechnology, they, along with members of their labs and other colleagues, report on their identification of LB244, a small-molecule inhibitor of STING. STING is a central driver of pathology in many autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders including lupus, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). Here, their studies show how LB244 is able to inhibit a wild-type STING variant which may advance their understanding of its relevance in the context of health and disease. Their data provide a structure for further study and development of therapeutics to treat STING-dependent inflammatory diseases.\n\nLearn more about the study.\n\nShyam Patel, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology, recently had a review published in the British Journal of Haematology. In the article titled “Challenges and solutions to superior chimeric antigen receptor-T design and deployment for B-cell lymphomas,” Dr. Patel and his team focus on the major obstacles to advancing therapeutic reach for CAR-T products in early lines of therapy. Since the introduction of CAR-T therapeutics for patients with leukemia and lymphoma, there is still a debate as to where these therapeutics fit into the care plan of a patient. Dr. Patel and his team discuss the barriers of CAR-T therapy, including antigen escape, “cold” tumor microenvironments, host inflammation, and CAR-T cell exhaustion. They also highlight solutions to these barriers, such as point-of-care CAR-T manufacturing and early T lymphopheresis, and review evidence that supports early CAR-T deployment for B-cell lymphomas.\n\nRead the full review.\n\nThe Program in Digital Medicine (PDM) in the Department of Medicine was recently featured as part of UMass Chan’s Advancing Together campaign. In an article titled, “Digital Medicine: Three ways technology may soon improve your health,” early innovations from the PDM and their commitment to improving health care are explored. Led by David McManus, MD, ScM, chair of the Department of Medicine, the Program in Digital Medicine uses mobile tools to keep patients healthy at home, such as smartphone applications, where patients can access health coaching, monitoring, and more. Additionally, the program utilizes the power of artificial intelligence to help detect symptoms and risk factors in various diseases such as Alzheimer’s and heart disease. The program is also currently working on suicide prevention software, as part of a new center led by UMass Chan, which aims to prevent suicide through evidence-based use of technology.\n\n“In all these ways, our teams are working together to drive innovation to make health care healthier,” said Dr. McManus.\n\nWatch the PDM video feature.\n\nLearn more about the PDM.\n\nThis month, we are excited to feature Milton Pereira, PhD, as our Postdoc Spotlight!

Of this work she said, “The ability to be with patients who may feel a great deal of shame about their addiction, and to say to them, ‘I can help you right here in my primary care office’, that is what I love about this work.”\n\nRead Dr. Chang's full spotlight by clicking here.\n\nFiachra Humphries, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Innate Immunity and faculty in the Program in Innate Immunity, recently had a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), titled, “Targeting STING Oligomerization with Small-Molecule Inhibitors.” STING is an essential adaptor protein required for inflammatory responses to pathogen or host cytosolic DNA. The DNA that enters the cytosol then activates the enzyme cGAS to generate a molecule called cGAMP. cGAMP then binds STING directly and induces a conformational change which initiates its activation. Dr. Humphries explains that STING activation leads to the production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines and although it is an important molecule for immune defenses, STING activation also plays a key role in driving inflammatory diseases, such as AGS, SAVI, COPA syndrome, ALS, Parkinson’s disease and SLE. He further states that there is an urgent need to develop specific small molecule STING antagonists to treat these diseases. In this study, Dr. Humphries worked to identify a new class of small molecules that can inhibit STING by blocking its oligomerization, leading to a further understanding of STING biology, the creation of a new paradigm, and how STING can be inhibited pharmacologically.\n\nRead Dr. Humphries' paper.\n\nApurv Soni, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Health Systems Science and co-director of the Program in Digital Medicine, was recently quoted in The New York Times piece, “Covid Didn’t Take a Summer Vacation.” With a recent uptick in cases, the article gives an overview of case monitoring as well as current recommendations for testing and treating Covid-19. Rapid tests remain effective for all variants and if you get a positive result, you can trust the result is accurate. If you are having symptoms but receive a negative result, it is recommended that you test again. “If the virus is not present in large quantities,” you may get a negative result even when you’re symptomatic, said Dr. Soni. “By doing serial testing, you give yourself a chance to catch the virus when it has increased to a higher quantity in your body.”\n\nRead The New York Times article.\n\nOn August 5, Sunita Puri, MD, associate professor of medicine, program director of the Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine Fellowship, and provider in the Division of Palliative Care, had her essay, “The Hidden Harms of CPR,” published in The New Yorker. Her essay takes the reader through an intimate account of an experience she had with a patient’s family who was faced with deciding whether to elect CPR for their husband and father who was seriously ill from Covid. While she recounts her experience with the family, Dr. Puri weaves in the history of CPR, how, when, and why it is often used, and its outcomes. She also discusses the need for improved physician training to have conversations with patients and their families so that they may make better-informed decisions.\n\n“Reversing a death is not the same as restoring a life. Nonetheless, CPR has become an expectation rather than an exception, a treatment meant for a few but applied to all” – Sunita Puri\n\nRelated: May 2023 Chair's Spotlight: Sunita Puri\n\nIn this month’s Researcher Spotlight, we highlight the work of Chinmay Trivedi, MD, PhD, professor of medicine and director of cardiovascular medicine research in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine.

Dr. Ito Fukunaga’s project, “Facilitation of Information eXchange for Shared Decision Making (FIX-SDM) for Lung Cancer Screening,” aims to develop and pilot test a multi-strategy implementation program using health informatics to promote shared decision-making for lung cancer screening. The goal of her project is to improve the initial uptake of lung cancer screening, as well as longitudinal adherence to annual follow-ups by supporting shared decision making. Dr. Ito Fukunaga’s mentors at UMass Chan include Drs. Kathleen Mazor, Rajani Sadasivam, and Sybil Crawford.\n\nKate Fitzgerald, PhD, the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research Chair III, professor of medicine, associate vice provost for basic science research, vice chair of research in the Department of Medicine, chief of the Division of Innate Immunity and director of the Program in Innate Immunity, has received an Innovator Award from the Kenneth Rainin Foundation for her project, “HOXA11os, an IBD associated lncRNA that maintains tissue homeostasis and restrains inflammation.” Many treatments for IBD focus on blocking inflammation and fail to repair damaged tissue and restore the integrity of the tissue. Dr. Fitzgerald and her group have identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), HOXA11os, that is only expressed in the colon. When HOXA11os is present the tissue is healthy and functional, however in patients with ulcerative colitis, the levels decrease. To model this state, they generated mice lacking this lncRNA and like patients with UC, these mice developed colitis. The lncRNA localizes to the mitochondria in cells of the healthy colon, but when the lncRNA is lost, the mitochondria in the cells in the colon are damaged, produce reactive oxygen species, and damage colonic tissue. These findings provide new insights into how HOXA11os can help mitochondria work well to maintain homeostasis in the gut, which suggests new opportunities to restore tissue health by controlling the levels of this lncRNA.\n\nLorissa Smulan, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, has received a Catalyst Award from the American Lung Association. Her project titled “Defining the Mitochondrial Sirtuins and Type I Interferon Axis in Tuberculosis,” aims to understand the contributing factors of Mtb-induced mitochondrial damage. According to Dr. Smulan, mitochondria play an important role in the immunometabolic response to pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB). Mtb targets mitochondria in macrophages, rewiring metabolism and inducing a redox imbalance, which contributes to infection-induced macrophage necrosis. Damaged mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA, which may induce type I interferons (IFN), leading to exacerbated TB immune pathology.\n\nDr. Smulan hopes to characterize the link between Mtb-induced downregulation of mitochondrial sirtuins and mitochondrial damage. Additionally, she will investigate how decreased activity of sirtuins may promote TB progression via increased type I IFN signaling induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the link between mitochondrial sirtuins, mitochondrial damage, and type I IFN will be beneficial for the development of host-directed therapies for TB.\n\nHonghuang Lin, PhD, professor of medicine in the Division of Health Systems Science and a co-director in the Program in Digital Medicine, was recently featured in an article by UMass Chan Communications for a new study where ECGs can predict biological age, risk of death, and cardiovascular disease.
