        "text": "At one point Monday night — probably right around the time a person named “Tuf Borland” tried to cover DeVonta Smith in the open field, only for Smith to catch the most practice-drill looking touchdown pass in national championship history — the thought occurred to us: Man, college basketball is so much better than this.\n\nDon’t get us wrong. College football is extremely entertaining. Its cultural hooks are irresistible. It’s as popular as it is for good reason. But in the midst of yet another Alabama triumph Monday, another anodyne, robotic display of total superiority, we couldn’t help but think about how much worse the NCAA Tournament would be if the selection committee limited its range of possible outcomes the way college football does. Imagine if the committee picked four teams. Imagine if this season ended that way, with four of the top five or six teams on the list below chosen and told to face off in the semifinals. In this, of all years, it isn’t totally unimaginable. But for real: How terrible would that be? This season we have Alabama-level dominance in college basketball in at least one team (Gonzaga) and maybe two (counting Baylor) and, sure, everyone would love to see those two play. But without an NCAA Tournament to get them there, without all of the weirdness and brilliance and luck required to get to that stage or beyond, that matchup, or any other, would ultimately feel hollow.\n\nPoint is, sometimes, events conspire and nudge you toward gratitude for what you already have. The NCAA Tournament selection committee always makes a couple of minor mistakes, and the process could always be better, but compared to that? It’s not even a choice.\n\n1. Gonzaga (12-0)\n\nWe now return to our regularly scheduled programming: “What can we possibly say about Gonzaga being ridiculously good this week?” Thanks for tuning in, folks!\n\nThis week, join us as we cast our evaluative eye on a player we haven’t mentioned much in this space: Joel Ayayi. Why? Simple. Last Saturday, in Gonzaga’s 116-88 win over Portland, Ayayi finished with 12 points (on 5-of-7 shooting), 13 rebounds and 14 assists, recording the first triple-double in Gonzaga basketball history. Like, ever. Think of all of the good Gonzaga players who have gone through the program in the past 20 years. Adam Morrison never did this. John Mother-Bleeping Stockton never did this. Joel Ayayi did this. It’s a hell of a thing.\n\nThis is what makes Gonzaga such a fearsome offensive force. Ayayi is … what … Gonzaga’s fourth-best player? He’s on a team with Corey Kispert, the most efficient player in the country; Drew Timme, perhaps the nation’s best non-Garza big man; and Jalen Suggs, the best prospect in Gonzaga hoops history. Ayayi is bound by circumstance to be overlooked, in more ways than one. After all, how much offense does Gonzaga run for Ayayi? Not a ton. Per Synergy, four of Ayayi’s most frequent play types are transition, as a spot-up shooter (usually after a kick-out or a couple of swing passes or both), as a cutter, or on offensive rebounds. He does run some pick-and-roll stuff, sure, but the vast majority of his work comes in the flow of things — running out on the break or creating havoc on the glass, an elite rebounder in a 6-foot-5 frame.\n\nAyayi’s versatility and willingness to blend into the team are a huge part of what makes Gonzaga so good. He is malleable, flexible and hugely efficient in his own right, the kind of player who does everything well and makes everyone around him — already a collection of some of the best players in the country — even better.\n\n2. Baylor (11-0)\n\nAgain, as impressive as Gonzaga is, Baylor isn’t far off. It really isn’t, mostly thanks to being elite on both ends of the floor. To wit: The Zags are blowing everyone out of the water offensively. The Ayayi triple-double win over Portland was a 116-points-in-79-possessions night, a totally off-the-charts offensive performance. But Gonzaga also allowed 88 points, probably the product of some situational leniency (when you’re scoring 116 points in 40 minutes of basketball it can be easy to lose some defensive intensity) but also the product of a defense that has never been among the very best in the country this season. Indeed, after their first three WCC games (including a hefty win over BYU), Gonzaga ranks just sixth in the West Coast Conference in points allowed per possession. Small sample, but still. Not great.\n\nBaylor, on the other hand, is the only team in the country coming close to Gonzaga’s adjusted efficiency margin, and the Bears are doing it on both ends. After four Big 12 games, Scott Drew’s team ranks first in both points per trip and points allowed; this has been the best offense and the best defense in one of the sport’s most challenging leagues. Will that hold up? Maybe, maybe not. Baylor’s first four Big 12 opponents were Kansas State, Iowa State, Oklahoma and TCU, and things are about to get much more challenging in the coming days, when Jared Butler and Co. head to Texas Tech and then host Kansas in a 72-hour window. Texas might wind up being the best defense in the Big 12. Texas Tech too. There is robust competition for the honor, is the point. But Baylor looks a step above the rest — the only team in the country that deserves to be put on the same tier as the high-flying Zags.\n\n3. Michigan (11-0)\n\nLast week, after Michigan’s blowout win over Minnesota, we wrote the following: “For weeks, we’d been patiently waiting for the Wolverines to make a definitive statement. Well, there you go.”\n\nUm, yeah. So. About that.\n\nAs it turns out, beating Minnesota, 82-57, as impressive as it was, wasn’t the statement game of Michigan’s undefeated start to the season. That would, in fact, come Tuesday night, in Ann Arbor, against a fellow top-10 team in Wisconsin, a veteran, solid-in-every-way group that previously beat Louisville, 85-48, a Badgers outfit that just got completely, utterly, hilariously run off the floor.\n\nMichigan went on a 43-6 run. Read that again. Swish it around. Let it sink in. A 43-6 run. Over a huge stretch of this game — from about five minutes left in the first half until 10 and change left in the second — Michigan scored 43 points and Wisconsin scored six. The Badgers didn’t help themselves, sure; coach Greg Gard was clearly disappointed with the way his players responded (or, more accurately, didn’t) in that run. But so much of it felt like Michigan just being great: active and ferocious on defense, defined by wings who can guard like crazy, switch everything, rebound and hit shots on the other end. Isaiah Livers (13 points, six boards, three assists, three blocks) was great. Franz Wagner (15 points, 10 rebounds, four steals) was great. Star freshman center Hunter Dickinson, the engine of the offense for so much of the season, wasn’t the standout performer for much of Tuesday night. He was fine in the end, though he did struggle with Wisconsin’s interior defense. It didn’t matter even a little.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Michigan — a team that spent the first few weeks of the season beating teams it was obviously superior to — did more than prove itself as a top-10-ish team. In one fell swoop, it elevated itself into the national title contender conversation, where, barring something drastic, it will stay for the rest of this season. The Wolverines are real, and they’re spectacular.\n\n4. Villanova (8-1)\n\nAs capricious as these power rankings sometimes are with teams toward the end of the scale, we find it difficult to justify ditching or unduly moving teams at the top. Case in point: Villanova. Were Villanova, say, the ninth-best team in the country in our view, we would have put it in “also thinking about” for a couple of weeks while its latest COVID-19 pause blew over. Alas, we’re pretty sure Villanova is one of the best three or four teams in the country, even if it hasn’t played since (checks notes) Dec. 23. Dec. 23! Has it really been that long? It has. And yet the Wildcats remain.\n\nSpeaking of which, we were all fired up for Villanova’s glorious return Friday night at UConn, where the Wildcats could end their pause with a quality game on the road against Dan Hurley’s rebuilt, one-loss Huskies team, not just because that’s a good game but also because what else are we going to do on a Friday night in January 2021? Exactly. Naturally, that game was postponed, thanks to the state of Connecticut’s rules about when teams can play vis a vis an opponent’s most recent positive test. Good times. At some point Villanova will play a game of basketball again. When it does, trust us, you’ll be the first to know.\n\n5. Iowa (11-2)\n\nFor all the talk of the Big Ten as this sort of chaotic Conradian plunge into college basketball’s heart of darkness, the league is beginning to make a tiny bit of sense. To wit:\n\nDoes anyone really have a beef with that hierarchy? Doesn’t that look about right? A couple of weeks ago, Rutgers would have put up a fuss, but the Scarlet Knights have had a brutal start to the calendar year. In any case, none of this negates the principle that anyone can beat anyone on any given night™, because, frankly, the teams in Tier 2 (so to speak) aren’t all that far off the teams in Tier 1, and the teams in Tier 3 — your Marylands, your Penn States, your Michigan States — aren’t all that far off the rest. The Spartans are still ranked 43rd in KenPom. It remains a really tough, really good league, even if the minor differences between groups of teams are starting to codify a little more.\n\nAnyway, Iowa remains a member in good standing of that elite top tier. The Hawkeyes are riding a four-game winning streak, the latter two wins of which have featured some genuinely solid defense, holding Maryland to 67 points in 74 trips in College Park and Minnesota to 71 in 72 at Carver-Hawkeye. For an offense not far behind Gonzaga’s in adjusted efficiency, and one averaging 1.18 points per possession in Big Ten play, holding opponents to less than a point per trip — even if only barely! — is almost always going to equate to a win. Again, Iowa doesn’t need to be dominant defensively. It just needs to be average. So far, for the most part, so good.\n\n6. Texas (10-2)\n\nIf you want to understand the difference between last year’s squishy, mediocre Longhorns and the 2020-21 buzzsaw, look no further than our colleague Brian Hamilton, who spent a great deal of time embedded with the team last season, part of a year-long project studying an on-the-brink campaign for embattled coach Shaka Smart. Hamilton wrote about this Texas team last week, and the contrast between what he saw last year (below) and what anyone with eyes can see every time these Longhorns take the floor:\n\nAs usual, then-assistant Luke Yaklich called on individual players to break down the offensive tendencies of Kansas players. Not as usual, each Longhorn began his report with a crude non-sequitur: “F— (insert Jayhawks player’s last name).” In the room, it struck me as funny, but also contrived and weird. It felt like the team was playing pretend. Like they had to persuade themselves they were hard-asses. Being mean isn’t a gimmick. The next evening, Texas battled, but it ultimately withered and lost by 11.\n\nNeedless to say, it is basically impossible to imagine this Texas team needing to do something quite so cringe in its film scouts; one assumes, by now, that the players aren’t required to say the quiet part out loud. As Hamilton writes later, midway through the year Smart asked strength and conditioning coach Andrea Hudy, formerly of Bill Self’s KU program, to talk to the group, at which point Hudy more or less mercilessly called them all soft. This was an ongoing thing, more or less all season, until Texas finally turned its season around. (Lest we forget, after West Virginia beat Texas, 97-59, when mild-mannered, unflinchingly polite ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla called the Longhorns “soft” and “non-competitive.” Way harsh, Tai.)\n\nThe point is, this stuff matters. It is one thing to have good players. It is another thing to have a good coach. It’s all well and fine to have an intelligent scheme and good scouting practices and an understanding of modern tactics. It is sometimes fashionable — particularly among folks like us, who place the greatest analytical and team-building stock in things like “put good players on the court” and “have them do smart things once there” — to ignore soft factors such as attitude and personality. Texas is better at lots of very real things. But there will always be a difference between a program whose players are hard and a program whose players are soft. Texas’ players, mostly the same group as last season (with the notable exception of freshman Greg Brown, who continues to find his way at the college level as a chaotic-good wing with elite rebounding ability) have evolved in exactly this way. The results are plain.\n\n7. Tennessee (9-1)\n\nAnd now for something totally different: an elite defensive team that occasionally struggles to score. Tennessee remains a force on the defensive end, one of the few teams in the country that makes defense fun to watch. It’s great. On offense, UT is one of the least turnover-prone teams in high-major hoops, less thanks to particularly disciplined point guard play (though those guys are good) but because UT’s wings and bigs (particularly Victor Bailey, John Fulkerson and Yves Pons) don’t cough it up in the moments between catching a pass and finishing the possession with a shot attempt.\n\nThis team’s Achilles heel is it can’t shoot the 3. Or, more precisely, they don’t shoot the 3. The Vols have been fine from deep percentage-wise, from where they’ve hit 34.9 percent on the season (though that number has dropped to 32.8 percent against league opposition). But just 29.7 percent of UT’s field goals are 3s, the type of number that has Kentucky fans giving John Calipari some substantive side-eye for perhaps the first time in his career. Tennessee’s combination of defense, turnover-aversion and interior finishing is probably enough to get by, but it does turn games into grinds, and it shouldn’t be a surprise when the math sometimes ends up in a team like (most notably) Alabama’s favor.\n\n8. Clemson (9-1)\n\nThanks to COVID-19, the Tigers haven’t taken the floor since last week’s home survival of NC State. Despite the pause, Brad Brownell’s team hasn’t lost the distinction of having the nation’s top-ranked per-trip defense, one built on serious, in-your-face pressure, one that produces misses and turnovers and thus skews the shot-volume and shot-quality advantages heavily in Clemson’s direction.\n\nSaturday’s game against Virginia looms large. It seemed to be in some amount of doubt for a few days this week, but Clemson star Aamir Simms’ tweet Wednesday morning …\n\n… suggests the Tigers are planning on playing this weekend. (It also suggests Simms genuinely likes, and has actively missed, going to practice. Could never be us.)\n\nWith Duke struggling and Florida State still an unknown, Saturday’s matchup has the potential to determine the course of the 2020-21 ACC. It might be the title decider, full stop. Huge game.\n\n9. Houston (10-1)\n\nThe Cougars have allowed an opponent to average 1.0 points or higher per trip just once this season, Dec. 29, at Tulsa, when the Golden Hurricane scored exactly that: 65 points in 65 possessions. Each of Houston’s other 10 games, all wins, have featured a varying degree of dominant defense. Alongside Clemson and Tennessee, the Cougars form a heady triumvirate of teams who grind you into dust defensively.\n\nNeither Clemson nor Tennessee has a player quite like Quentin Grimes, though. Playing for a team ranked 314th in adjusted tempo, Grimes is averaging 17.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He is not the world’s most efficient scorer; he’s shooting just 37.5 percent from the field, including 40.7 percent from 2 and (a more respectable) 34.2 percent from beyond the arc. Still, his ability to get to the foul line (he draws five fouls per 40 minutes) and generate points (he shoots 89 percent from the stripe) have made his field-goal percentages sort of beside the point. He is the key source of offense on a defense-first team that doesn’t shoot the ball great and absolutely needs offensive rebounds and extra shots to stay afloat on that end of the floor. Or, rather, would need second-chance points to stay afloat, were it not for Grimes’ unique ability to generate buckets one way or the other.\n\nYou have to hand it to Grimes. Just a couple of seasons ago, he arrived at Kansas as a bonafide blue-chip star, a lottery mock draft feature, a surefire one-and-done prospect. Things didn’t go as planned, Grimes transferred to Houston, and instead of taking the world by storm, he had a good-but-not-great sophomore season on a team whose perimeter work was generally dominated by freshman Caleb Mills. Now a junior, Grimes has blossomed; he looks more assured, more confident and more intuitive every time he touches the ball. The result is an All-American-esque season, the engine of a huge chunk of Houston’s success on that end of the floor.\n\n10. Creighton (10-2)\n\nWant a tribute to the benefits of balance? Look no further than the Creighton Bluejays, whom we praised last week for, in the immortal phrasing of Steve Lavin, sharing the sugar despite having a preseason All-America guard in Marcus Zegarowski. It would have been somewhat easy for Creighton to become the Zegarowski show on offense, for Greg McDermott to put the ball in one player’s hands a disproportionate amount. But that’s not really what Creighton does, and in this case Zegarowski seems more than happy to split usage and scoring duties mostly evenly with guys such as Denzel Mahoney and Christian Bishop — all of which rolls together and makes Creighton more difficult to stop.\n\nBut it doesn’t just have benefits when Zegarowski is playing. It’s also a solid insurance policy when he doesn’t. Case in point: last Saturday’s win over St. John’s, Creighton’s sixth in a row. Zegarowski missed the game with a hamstring issue. St. John’s sophomore star Julian Champagnie had the best game of his career: 33 points (on 13-of-18 shooting), 10 rebounds, two blocks, two steals, two assists. The Red Storm finished with 79 points in 74 trips. And the Bluejays — who finished with six players in double figures — still won by 22. See? Balance. It’s good.\n\n11. Virginia Tech (10-2)\n\nWelcome back, Virginia Tech! Full disclosure: We didn’t think we’d see the Hokies again. Yes, Mike Young’s team got on the big board back in November, after that stirring overtime win over Villanova at the Mohegan Sun, but at the time that felt like a bit of a one-off, a nice little neutral-court upset that didn’t necessarily feel like a harbinger of Tech’s season. When the Hokies lost at home by 20 to Penn State in early December, we considered our suspicions officially confirmed.\n\nVirginia Tech’s next game, though? A 66-60 home win over Clemson — still the Tigers’ only loss — before we really had an idea of how good Clemson might be. Since then, it has become clear that Tech, if nothing else, has two of the best wins in the country, victories over two power-ranking regulars the likes of which no other team in the country can boast, and its only other loss came at Louisville, in a dogfight, by a bucket.\n\nYoung deserves an awful lot of credit. In the offseason, when Landers Nolley transferred, it looked like another rebuilding year was assured. Instead, the core of the team around Nolley last season — point guard Wabissa Bede, perimeter threat Nahiem Alleyne, and guard Tyrese Radford, who is having a super-efficient sophomore season (and rebounds about as well at his position as any guard not named Jordan Goodwin) — have elevated their games in the backcourt, while Young has plugged gaps with crucial frontcourt transfers Keve Aluma (Wofford) and Justyn Mutts (who had a nice year at Delaware last season), and gotten it all to work much sooner than anyone expected.\n\nWe’re not sure what to make of Duke, and we’re not sure how much stock we should put into any team beating Duke at home this season. The weakly held take here is that Duke just isn’t all that good right now; KenPom.com ranks Virginia Tech 32nd even after Tuesday, so top 10 or top 15 might be a little overzealous. Even so, the Hokies deserve to be discussed. They’ve had a great season — and they’ve shown no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\n12. Texas Tech (11-3)\n\nFirst of all, man: How good was Wednesday night? Our impression of Texas Tech’s 79-77 win at Texas, like the thing we actually said to ourself as we were watching, was how exhausting it all looked; it was the kind of game that it is almost unfathomable for your average out-of-shape person to imagine participating in, the televised experience of what it feels like to have your lungs burn. Everyone on the floor, at all times, played insanely hard. Regardless of the outcome, both teams would leave the floor having deserved, on some level, to win.\n\nTexas Tech left on top, its first marquee victory of the year, for reasons that underscore why it remained a top-15 team despite its three losses and lack of elite wins in its first 13 games. As usual, the Red Raiders guarded like crazy, a staple of Chris Beard’s teams, all hounding rotations and careening limbs; they were remarkable in the second half, an effort that intensively whittled at a 10-point halftime deficit. As usual, Beard coached his team especially well, most of all late in the game, when he sprung a sudden full-court press on an unwitting Texas backcourt, which resulted in a turnover and the game-tying bucket and left both Courtney Ramey and Matt Coleman trying to figure out what strange twist had just befallen them.\n\nAnd last but not least, Texas Tech had Mac McClung. He is not a perfect player. He is the one noticeable point of weakness in Texas Tech’s perimeter defense. He gets out of control. He drives the ball into bad spots. He picks up his dribble at the free-throw line and then just chucks the ball off the backboard and tries to go get it in a high-level Division I game, which is totally ludicrous behavior. He takes way too many dribbles. And so on.\n\nStill, he is being honed into something more than he was late last season at Georgetown. And whatever else he does, he is the one Red Raider who can go get you a bucket. That team doesn’t have another player who can do what he did in the closing seconds Wednesday night. If McClung is remotely efficient and remotely calm, that singular ability can make him special.\n\nAlso thinking about: Virginia, which we thought about putting on the list proper but didn’t because we didn’t want to upset the opportunity for Virginia Tech fans to revel in their own team’s ongoing success without Virginia being present, because a) we’re nice and b) we understand the value of petty rivalry; Casey Morsell finding his shot; Saint Louis; how many times Fran said the words “ghost screen” Wednesday night; Kansas’ perimeter shooting problems being a bigger deal than we previously realized; Cade Cunningham’s passing, pretty much all the time; Wisconsin still being maybe one of the 10 best teams in the country and just having one of those nights, but also, like, jeez, guys; Illinois’ underlying numbers being elite in basically every metrics system but also belonging to a team capable of losing games like Sunday at home to Maryland, and also one that really struggles to guard ball screens, which every coach in the country now knows; Texas Tech; West Virginia; Colorado; Oregon; USC; the Pac-12 suddenly being a real basketball conference again, would you look at that; Alabama, which has just about done enough to get on the list since that Dec. 19 home loss to Western Kentucky; UConn; Sharife Cooper; Indiana’s massive game against Purdue on Thursday night; Louisville; how bad Kentucky’s offense is; that time we flipped over from the Ohio State-Northwestern game to check in on Arkansas-LSU and seeing, wait, is that right? LSU is up 44-13 with six minutes left in the first half! WHAT?; flipping from that game to Florida State-NC State, which was somehow almost worse, the product of the Seminoles’ best offensive performance, like, ever; how bad of a decision it was to pick this cursed January, of all Januarys, to do Dry January; this drone footage of Iceland; how we spent much of the past week’s minimal free time distracting ourselves with “Suzerain,” one of the best games we’ve played in a long time, one anyone with any interest in strategy, history, government, 20th-century European politics and/or story-driven RPGs should absolutely play through at least once.\n\n(Top photo of Michigan’s Isaiah Livers: Rick Osentoski / USA Today)"
