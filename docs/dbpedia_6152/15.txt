At Ohorongo Cement, our commitment extends beyond cement manufacturing. We take great pride in actively contributing to the well-being of the communities where we operate, reflecting our ethos as both a company and as individuals.

Internally, we place immense value on equipping our employees with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in their roles. Ohorongo Cement is dedicated to employee development, offering formal training opportunities to enhance skills and capabilities. Our human resource development system empowers employees to embrace new challenges and explore fresh opportunities, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

Externally, we nurture talent within our broader community. We provide job attachments, internships, and educational bursaries across a wide spectrum of disciplines. This not only prepares individuals for future opportunities within our industry but also equips them with relevant technical experience to meet the demands of today’s job market.

Our commitment to the community extends to impactful social investment initiatives managed through our Social Investment Program. These initiatives primarily focus on three pillars: Education, Healthcare, and Infrastructure. We understand that a thriving community is built on access to quality education, reliable healthcare, and robust infrastructure, and we’re dedicated to playing a pivotal role in supporting these areas.

Since our inception in 2010, Ohorongo Cement has collectively donated in excess of N$ 30 million to various CSI initiatives in Namibia.
