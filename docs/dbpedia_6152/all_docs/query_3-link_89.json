Photo already there PHOTO: Mr David Nuyoma, CEO of the DBN Development Bank of Namibia shows innovation and flexibility Since opening its doors in 2004, the Development Bank of Namibia (DBN) has shown remarkable innovation and flexibility, inventing diverse loan products and bridging finance facilities, while displaying a pragmatic approach when caring for its clients. The DBN has a track record of successes matched by very few organisations of a similar nature. The DBN’s balance sheet passed the one billion Namibia dollar mark at the end of 2010 – one year earlier than envisaged –jumping to this threshold from N$721 million, the figure of December 2009. The DBN concentrates on three main areas – infrastructure projects, which positively impact on the national economy, private sector projects, which accelerate development through creating jobs and boosting the GDP, and offering diverse loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Finance is also available for local authorities, State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) and public private partnership (PPP) projects. “We virtually take project proposals apart and put them back together again during our analysis before a loan decision is taken,” says David Nuyoma, CEO of the DBN. The DBN also extends credit lines to local commercial banks, so that the latter can improve access to finance for SMEs. According to its latest annual report, the DBN turns away “certain types of projects such as speculative investments, businesses that will have a negative social impact and projects that will have a damaging effect on the environment.” Loan defaulters under the SME portfolio, introduced with partner banks FNB Namibia and Bank Windhoek, make up less than 2 per cent. This is a remarkable achievement, especially in light of the knocks that the Namibian economy took due to the 2008-09 global economic crisis. “Development finance bears risks but there are tolerance levels, and there can be loan impairments of up to 15 per cent. We, however, try to keep this as low as possible,” says Nuyoma. “We try to think outside of the box when finding solutions for our clients. We keep in close contact and do many on-site visits while monitoring to recognise any possible alarm signals early enough.” As an example, Nuyoma recalls a medium enterprise with a hundred jobs at stake, which had difficulties to increase its turnover and thus honour its loan repayments. “We sent one of our experts to observe the day-to-day operations of that company, and its administration and management practices for several days. He compiled a comprehensive report and made some recommendations for improvements which we discussed at length,” Nuyoma recalls.

It is now run on a much sounder basis,” says Nuyoma. Early in 2011, the DBN took another innovative step and bought N$96 million equity in Ohorongo Cement, a subsidiary of Germany’s Schwenk Group, which invested N$3.2 billion to construct Africa’s most modern cement plant in Namibia. Production started in December 2010. Ohorongo will produce 750 000 tonnes of cement per annum, of which nearly half is intended for export, mainly to southern Africa. Why did DBN buy into Ohorongo? “We advanced a loan to them for that amount,” explains Nuyoma, “but since our huge local limestone reserves will ensure cement production for the next 300 years, the DBN decided to turn the loan into equity. In this way we can secure income from dividends over the long term, which the DBN will again use to finance loans for its clients.” The Schwenk Group had indicated from the start that it would allow 40 per cent equity for Namibian institutions – not individuals – in Ohorongo Cement. “The cement factory is good for Namibia in many ways, creating hundreds of jobs, enhancing rail and road transport, bringing new technology to the country, and benefiting the environment, with invader bush selectively removed from surrounding farms to be used as fuel for the factory’s kilns,” Nuyoma notes. NEW PRODUCTS In its ongoing efforts to address financing gaps in the country, the DBN announced early in 2011 that it has introduced two new functions: Lending, and Business Support and Development. The latter two were previously combined in the Operations function. The newly created Business Support and Development department will provide mentoring, training and aftercare support to borrowers. The bank also developed two new products: Receivables Financing (Factoring and Invoice Discounting) and Leasing. These service products were designed to further improve small firms’ access to finance and also to help SMEs grow into bigger establishments. Payments for services in both the public and private sector often take 90 or 120 days, leaving small enterprises in dire need of cash flow, or relying on overdraft facilities. Receivables Financing helps DBN clients to solve this problem. The DBN advances its client a portion of the invoice amount for service delivery - up to 80 per cent - as a first payment. Once the buyer pays the invoice, the transaction is settled and the DBN client receives the remainder of the invoice amount as a second payment, less the factoring fee. The DBN provides this funding for amounts ranging from N$150,000 to N$2.5 million for a maximum of 120 days. The bank’s new Leasing product enables smaller companies requiring equipment for mining, manufacturing or service sector projects to lease such equipment. The DBN purchases the necessary equipment, and the company leases it for an agreed period. At the end of the leasing contract, the equipment is either transferred back to the DBN or sold to the client company, which leased it. “Minimum leasing terms should preferably be three years or more, and SMEs can lease such equipment user 3/24/2011 8:51 PM Deleted: and they user 3/24/2011 9:20 PM Deleted: ed user 3/24/2011 9:20 PM Deleted: It is a N$3.2 billion investment. user 3/24/2011 8:55 PM Deleted: there are proven user 3/24/2011 8:55 PM Deleted: locally user 3/24/2011 8:55 PM Deleted: for user 3/24/2011 8:56 PM Deleted: our user 3/23/2011 9:16 PM Deleted: set out user 3/23/2011 9:16 PM Deleted: to also user 3/24/2011 8:58 PM Deleted: for user 3/24/2011 9:01 PM Deleted: between user 3/24/2011 9:01 PM Deleted: and user 3/24/2011 9:06 PM Deleted: empowers user 3/24/2011 9:06 PM Deleted: to accomplish their projects like in the user 3/24/2011 9:06 PM Deleted: s user 3/24/2011 9:07 PM Deleted: from the user 3/24/2011 9:08 PM Deleted: , which user 3/24/2011 9:08 PM Deleted: such user 3/23/2011 9:19 PM Deleted: it is user 3/23/2011 9:19 PM Deleted: had"
