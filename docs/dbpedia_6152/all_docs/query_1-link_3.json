        "text": "Scientists discovered a way to store carbon dioxide in concrete without compromising on strength Why would you want to store carbon dioxide in concrete? The reason is twofold: 1. storing CO2 in concrete can help to lessen the carbon footprint of the cement industry and; 2. it will help to form calcium carbonate, that strengthens the concrete itself. How is it done? Conventionally, carbon is injected into freshly poured concrete. However, a Northwestern University team of engineers have discovered that one can use a carbonated (rather than still) water-based solution in the concrete manufacturing process. The Outcome: Through laboratory experiments, the engineers discovered that the process stored carbon dioxide up to 45% more efficiently. This means that almost half of the CO2 injected was captured and stored. The research team hopes that their new discovery will help offset the CO2 emissions resulting from the ever-growing demands from the cement and concrete industry.

This new cement is 17 times more crack-resistant and 19 times more ductile than traditional cement, offering potential improvements in durability and safety for construction materials. By alternating layers of cement and polymer, they achieve a balance of strength and flexibility, making the material resilient against cracking. This innovation could pave the way for tougher building materials in the future.
