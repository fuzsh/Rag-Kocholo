Ohorongo Cement also constructed a third packaging line at the facility.\n\n“Being the largest foreign direct investment in Namibia, Ohorongo is setting the bar high for future investors in terms of execution, standard and quality for all value addition products,” Ms Shilunga said.\n\nThe new plant will allow Ohorongo Cement to produce various types of cement and meet the increasing demand for additional cement types. Furthermore, the new packaging line will allow for packaging of both 50kg bags and bulk cement.\n\nOhorongo Cement holds both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 Certifications. ISO 9001:2015 certification confirms that Ohorongo products are of the highest quality as measured against international standards while, the certification on ISO 14001:2015 confirms their continued commitment towards sustainability, and caring for the environment.\n\nPublished under Cement News"
