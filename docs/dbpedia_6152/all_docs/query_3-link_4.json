        "text": "Indicators on cement bags: What does it mean? This little line of text at the bottom of our bags lets you know exactly what type of cement it is, and what it is made of. The description of the different cement types is made up of different sections: The main types produced by Ohorongo Cement are: • CEM I = Portland cement • CEM II = Portland composite cement Section 2 Indicates how many constituents are added in %, and the second letter indicates which kind of constituent was used. The amount added in % is symbolized by the letters A, B or C. They indicate different percentages in different cement types. For example: CEM I with no letters, because it consists of 95-100% clinker and 0-5 % minor additional constituents CEM II A = Indicates that the product has been extended with 6-20 % additional constituents CEM II B = Indicates that the product has been extended with 21-35 % additional constituents The type of constituent is indicated by the following abbreviations/letters: “V” = Siliceous Fly-Ash “L” = Limestone with only up to 5% organic material (Low grade) “LL” = Limestone with only up to 2% organic material (High grade) Section 3 Indicates the compressive strength of the cement in MPa after 28 days. The three strength categories are 32.5, 42.5 and 52.5. Section 4 Indicates which early strength the cement has. There are three types of early strengths, L, N & R; however, only two are used in Southern Africa (N & R). 1. “N” stands for ordinary (normal) early strength 2. “R” stands for high (rapid) early strength The parameters for these classifications are determined in the SABS SANS 50197-1 and NAMS 197-1. #Ohorongo #OhorongoCement #BuildingFutures #IndustrializingNamibia #proudlynamibian #fornamibians #faq #frequentlyaskedquestions"
