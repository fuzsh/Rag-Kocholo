PRTG + xMatters

When xMatters receives a signal from PRTG, this integration sends context-rich alerts to on-call resources so they can initiate incidents from wherever they are. Extend your workflows further by adding custom and built-in Flow Designer steps to automatically perform additional resolution tasks.
