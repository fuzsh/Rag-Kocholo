Paessler PRTG Network Monitor and Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor offer the same extensive monitoring feature set, custom real-time alerting and notifications, customizable reports, historical data analysis, and much more.

However, our two monitoring products differ in licensing. While PRTG Network Monitor offers subscriptions from 500 up to 10,000 sensors, PRTG Enterprise Monitor comes as an annual subscription for an unlimited number of servers, based on the number of sensors in use.

Whatâ€™s more: PRTG Enterprise Monitor exclusively offers ITOPs Board at no extra cost, which collects and correlates and alerts & notifications from multiple PRTG servers based on business services, creates dependency diagrams, dashboards, and automated incident workflows.
