        "text": "In order to keep the entire IT infrastructure in a plant running and optimized, SMS group has Paessler AG at its side as a comprehensive monitoring expert. Impressive maps and dashboards, flexible alerts, multiple user interfaces, detailed reports, decentralized monitoring, and many more functions and features are all part of the PRTG Network Monitor product, which the Center of Excellence Electrics/Automation at SMS group utilizes as a central monitoring and control tool during the plant construction, testing, and commissioning phases.\n\nAs a partner for megatrends, SMS group also combines its integrated solutions with performance-related business models and offers PRTG licensing. It is part of the philosophy of being a lifecycle partner for customers by providing specialist support that boosts profitability.\n\nIn addition to monitoring conventional IT components, the SMS group electrics and automation also uses PRTG for monitoring the control systems. \"With PRTG we monitor both the control systems developed by us, which we have equipped with the corresponding interfaces especially for this purpose, and control systems that we buy from other reputable suppliers. The SNMP, OPC UA, and MQTT sensors included in PRTG help us achieve this. With these, we can integrate our Profinet networks and thus monitor their real-time capability, for example. Over and above this, we can use the PRTG Rest Custom Sensor to obtain essential information on the status of entire processes quickly and easily via our RESTful API\", explains Frank Schweisfurth.\n\nThe simulation phase is followed by the integration of the IT components into the OT environments, i.e. the control systems including all IT components are integrated in the physical machines. Of course, testing and monitoring activities must be continually carried out during the integration process. Thanks to PRTG, it has already been possible on repeated occasions to detect faults or irregularities and so prevent problems.\n\nFrank Schweisfurth explains: \"The combination of different software products in our solutions can lead to memory leaks. In the past, we had to invest a lot of time and effort to identify and eliminate them. Thanks to PRTG, we can identify and eliminate memory leaks efficiently at an early stage of the test phase.\"\n\nAfter a successful test phase, the plant is put into operation at the customer's site. This can take weeks or even months depending on the size of the production facility. It is also subject to continuous optimization and development throughout the installation phase. Responsibility for this remains with SMS group and, of course, testing and monitoring take place continually during this phase too. It must be ensured that the values guaranteed to the customer can be delivered, which requires full monitoring and documentation with no gaps. This is where PRTG also plays a role.\n\nIn addition to SMS group's proven products and solutions, the combination of technical expertise, automation and digitalization know-how and an extensive range of services is now gaining importance. This enables the development of new customer-specific business models that ensure the plants perform extremely well throughout their entire lifecycle.\n\nTherefore, when it comes to the way it utilizes PRTG, SMS group is again thinking one step ahead: \"PRTG has grown to become a central component of the whole production process for our plants: from planning through to acceptance by the customer. We are currently thinking of extending our range of services and supporting our customers in the operation of their plants even after their implementation. This could mean that we make PRTG part of the overall package and sell the customer a corresponding PRTG license, but another option would be for us to use PRTG as a service provider to ensure the smooth operation of the customer's plant over the long term, based on defined SLAs that we monitor with PRTG,\" adds Frank Schweisfurth.\n\nUpgrading from PRTG Network Monitor to PRTG Enterprise Monitor gives you enormous flexibility in the way you use PRTG. Frank Schweisfurth explains: \"We can now set up a separate PRTG server for each project and for each plant, and distribute the licensed sensors completely freely across the individual PRTG instances. In many cases, smaller systems require only 500 PRTG sensors, whereas a few thousand sensors may be needed for large systems. We can cover all this with a single license that can be easily scaled to fit our needs.\""
