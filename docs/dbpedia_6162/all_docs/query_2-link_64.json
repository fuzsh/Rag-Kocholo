        "text": "The DATAEAGLE Condition Monitoring System is optimally suited for the monitoring of motors and machines in the industry. The aim is to provide remote condition monitoring that is easy and fast Â to implement in the sense of Industry 4.0. As an Uptime Alliance Partner, Schildknecht AG’s Condition Monitoring System is the optimal complement for the integration of existing plants.\n\nThe system consists of a small multi-sensor (CISS) suitable for harsh industrial environments, a global IoT-Gateway (DATAEAGLE 2730) with Modbus TCP interface. The system is designed for integration into PAESSLER’s PRTG Network Monitor to centrally monitor OT data, e.g. from machines.\n\nThe robust CISS sensor can Â be mounted directly onto the engine or the machine and transmits the data via Bluetooth Low Energy to the central IoT Gateway DATAEAGLE 2730.There, the values from up to 8 sensors can be received simultaneously. The values are pre-processed and can be retrieved via the local network in the PRTG Network Monitor. The flexibly configurable dashboard shows the sensor and machine values and also offers further processing or e.g. alarming.\n\nLearn more in our webinars.\n\nThe DATAEAGLE CMS PRTG Network Monitor is suitable for any retrofit solution for existing plants. Thereby the following inertial and environmental sensors are used: acceleration, gyroscope, magnetometer, digital light, pressure, microphone, temperature and humidity. The values are displayed in a local dashboard and can thus be retrieved via the local network. Optional alarms can be set for individual sensors.\n\nThe DATAEAGLE Condition Monitoring System is also available with mor different interfaces: local dashbord,Â fieldbus interface or a remotely accessible Cloud-Dashboard. Find more information here.\n\nâ¢ Overview Condition Monitoring Systems\n\nâ¢ More information in this blog article\n\nPAESSLER believes monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankindâs consumption of resources. Monitoring data helps its customers save resources, from optimizing their IT, OT and IoT infrastructures to reducing energy consumption or emissions â for our future and our environment. That is why Paessler offers monitoring solutions for businesses across all industries and all sizes, from SMB to large enterprises. Paessler works with renowned partners, and together they tackle the monitoring challenges of an ever-changing world.\n\nSince 1997, when Paessler first introduced PRTG Network Monitor, it has combined its in-depth monitoring knowledge with an innovative spirit. Paessler knows the challenges of complex IT, OT and IoT infrastructures and networks. Paessler products empower its customers to monitor everything, and thus help them optimize their resources.\n\nPRTG stands for “Paessler Router Traffic Grapher” and is a comprehensive network monitoring software. It is a powerful tool designed to help IT administrators and network managers monitor the health of their network and detect issues proactively.\n\nWith PRTG, you can monitor various aspects of your network, including bandwidth utilization, availability of network devices, system performance, traffic analysis, server and application monitoring, and many other parameters. The software supports multiple protocols and allows monitoring of both local networks and distributed environments.\n\nPRTG offers a user-friendly interface and enables you to create customizable dashboards and reports. You receive real-time information about the status of your network, alerts and notifications when issues arise, as well as detailed statistics and analysis.\n\nBy comprehensively monitoring with PRTG, you can identify bottlenecks, disruptions, and potential security issues before they negatively impact the performance and availability of your network. This allows you to take proactive measures to minimize downtime and maximize the efficiency of your network."
