        "text": "If you monitor your network with PRTG Network Monitor, UVexplorer makes a great companion product to PRTG. UVexplorer can export devices and network maps to PRTG, and also automatically configure PRTG device sensors. This allows you to discover devices in UVexplorer, export them to PRTG, and monitor them in PRTG. This gives you the best of both worlds: UVexplorer’s detailed and fast network discovery capabilities, combined with PRTG’s advanced network monitoring capabilities.\n\nUVexplorer integrates directly with PRTG to provide the following powerful features:\n\nEnhanced Discovery of Network Devices and Connectivity – UVexplorer’s discovery is fast, detailed, and accurate. Run network discoveries within UVexplorer, and export discovered devices to PRTG for monitoring.\n\nAutomatic Device Sensor Configuration – When UVexplorer exports devices to PRTG, it automatically configures sensors on those devices in PRTG. Rather than creating all possible sensors, UVexplorer creates only those sensor types that you request, which minimizes your sensor count. Specifically, UVexplorer can automatically configure the following PRTG sensors:\n\nPing Sensors\n\nSNMP Uptime, CPU, Memory, and Traffic/Interface Sensors\n\nWMI Uptime, CPU, Memory, and Disk Space Sensors\n\nScheduled Network Discoveries – UVexplorer keeps your PRTG devices, sensors, and network maps continuously up-to-date by running network discoveries on a scheduled basis (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) After completing a scheduled discovery, UVexplorer automatically exports new devices and updated maps to your PRTG server, and also configures sensors on new devices.\n\nDetailed Device Inventory – UVexplorer discovers detailed inventory information about your network devices, and lets you run reports across all devices on your network. The following inventory data and reports are available:\n\nAsset details (make, model, serial number)\n\nOperating System Version\n\nSoftware Inventory\n\nNetwork Interfaces, Bridgeports, and VLANs\n\nDevice Connectivity\n\nClicking Next on the PRTG Server Settings page takes you to a page that lets you specify the name of the PRTG device group your UVexplorer devices will be exported to. You can send your devices to an existing PRTG device group, or specify that a new device group be created. If you export devices to an existing PRTG device group, UVexplorer will only add new devices that are not already in the target group (i.e., duplicate devices are not created). You can also specify an existing parent device group within which the new device group will be created. In addition to creating a device group, you can also ask UVexplorer to create a network map in PRTG. The exported map will contain all of the exported devices, including the physical connections between them. You can specify whether a new map should be created, or an existing one should be overwritten. If you overwrite an existing PRTG map, UVexplorer will only add new devices that are not already on the map (i.e., duplicate map devices are not created).\n\nClicking Next on the Devices to Export page takes you to a page that lets you specify what kinds of sensors should be created on the devices in PRTG. Often, you only want one or two kinds of sensors created, not all possible sensors. By exporting devices from UVexplorer into PRTG, you can get only the sensors that you really want, thus minimizing your sensor counts."
