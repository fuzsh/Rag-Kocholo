        "text": "PRTG is one of the best monitoring tools for the infrastructure and network but it comes with some limitations. Large infrastructures can quickly send hundreds of alerts, which results in ticket storms for ITSM. The difficulty of correlating monitoring data into service dashboards with automatic SLAs also slows root cause analysis and efficient Service Delivery Management. Moreover, when it comes to Microsoft Teams, only Martello can upgrade your PRTG with advanced monitoring capabilities.\n\nMartello Vantage DX upgrades your PRTG with Event Management, Service Mapping and advanced Microsoft Teams monitoring capabilities allowing you to correlate your monitoring data with external sources and ITSM to define end-to-end Service Delivery Dashboards, calculate SLAs, and significantly improve your cloud and hybrid monitoring capabilities.\n\nAlready embedded in Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor (PPEM ITOPs board) Martello Vantage DX is now available for every kind of PRTG licenses.\n\nLarge Energy company in Northern Europe has used PRTG for several years to monitor their central network and several on-premise applications that needed to be moved to a cloud platform. To ensure user satisfaction, they wanted to correlate Cloud Services health with PRTG data into end-to-end service delivery dashboards and proactively manage any incidents.\n\nThe Result\n\nMartello Vantage DX is deployed to map the cloud delivery service from end-to-end, aggregating data and alerts from cloud and network into NOC and helpdesk dashboards as well as service incident tickets that are sent to ServiceNow.\n\nIT operations have reduced their mean time to repair while increasing visibility for every stakeholder of the project."
