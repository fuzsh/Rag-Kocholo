        "text": "With PRTG Network Monitor, Paessler AG is developing a monitoring solution that helps IT and IoT professionals monitor their entire infrastructure around the clock. It provides full insight into your network and its performance, to ensure that all business-critical components of your infrastructure are running smoothly, with 100% uptime. More than 200,000 system administrators worldwide trust PRTG every day. The basic functionality of PRTG is to collect, store, analyze and publish data. Based on thresholds, which can be individually defined, PRTG sends notifications via different channels (e.g. e-mail, SMS, push notifications to multiple targets, including mobile devices, etc.) or triggers actions via scripts -specifically in the area of IoT.\n\nPRTG offers the following benefits:\n\nSigfox backend integration, including API, Callback and the sigfox geolocation service.\n\nAvailable on-prem and cloud\n\nHolistic Infrastructure monitoring\n\nFlexible Alerting\n\nMultiple User Interfaces\n\nCluster Failover Solution\n\nMaps and Dashboards\n\nDistributed Monitoring\n\nIn-Depth Reporting\n\nPRTG monitors the availability of the devices involved (sensors, actuators, hubs, software, hardware), display the actual state in individually created dashboards, and notify in case of failures. It will read and display data collected by sensors as well as device availability, and apply notification mechanisms.\n\nIn addition, PRTG stores the collected data indefinitely in the original interval, thus allowing long-term evaluations."
