        "text": "Paessler AG is extending its support to PRTG Network Monitor Freeware Edition users by increasing the number of available sensors (measuring points) from 10 to 30. With 30 sensors, users can better accommodate their complex IT networks as well as the growing list of features offered in PRTG Network Monitor, one of the industry's most versatile network monitoring platforms.\n\nThe increased sensor capacity in PRTG Network Monitor Freeware Edition, combined with Paessler's huge lineup of sensor types, gives users a broad range of new monitoring options. For example, users can monitor their organization's entire email process including Microsoft Exchange.\n\n\"Enterprise IT networks are more complicated and widely distributed than ever,\" noted Dirk Paessler, founder and CEO of Paessler AG. \"This new sensor upgrade will better match the scope of modern networks, and enable our Freeware Edition users to experience the power of PRTG Network Monitor more fully,\" says Dirk Paessler, CEO Paessler AG Dirk Paessler, CEO Paessler AG\n\nWith the increased number of sensors in PRTG Network Monitor Freeware Edition, users can keep track of bandwidth, storage systems, firewalls and more-and still have sensors left for dedicated enterprise applications. About 200 sensor choices are available including options for Windows WMI, Linux/Unix/OS X, VoIP/QoS, SQL database servers and much more.\n\nPRTG Network Monitor Freeware Edition offers Exchange Powershell-based sensors for monitoring backups, databases and email queues, along with a range of WMI sensors. Additional pre-defined sensors support monitoring of POP3, SMTP and IMAP servers.\n\nBecause email is one of the most critical functions for most companies, Paessler offers multiple features to monitor the email send-and-receive cycle. Email Round Trip Sensors allow users to check whether emails are sent and received; if monitoring an Exchange server, they can also check the time required for the send/receive cycle.\n\nPaessler's PRTG Network Monitor Freeware Edition offers the entire feature set of the full version including database, reporting, alerting and notifications. Users of the Freeware Edition can automatically upgrade to the compliment of 30 sensors using the Auto-Update feature; new users can receive all 30 sensors by downloading the freeware version."
