        "text": "I don't think there is an official guide, I think the only thing official is setting up custom sensors in PRTG to grab stuff from Lansweeper.\n\nI do a lot of things that aren't supported, so I'm hesitant in telling you how... BUT... here's what I do:\n\nPRTG to Update Lansweeper Classic: CURL call to PRTG API, download JSON results to file, SQL stored procedure to import JSON file and update LS records accordingly.\n\nLansweeper Classic to update PRTG: Powershell, PRTG module, sqlserver module... query custom report via SQL View SELECT, pass appropriate fields to PRTG via powershell module commands.\n\nI'm struggling to locate a guide for integrating PRTG with Lansweeper. Has one been prepared? The only guide I can identify to be remotely relevant is the third link you had provided.\n\n-----\n\nAdditional Information/Resources:\n\nIf it hasn't yet been consulted, we recommend the video tutorial for integrating PRTG with Lansweeper Cloud: https://go.paessler.com/webinar-on-demand-managing-security-roll-outs\n\nThe application will need to be created in Lansweeper first: https://docs.lansweeper.com/docs/api/authenticate#personal-application\n\nThis gives you an \"Identity Code\" that you can use to query Lansweeper API, and you can use it in PRTG PowerShell script. This application needs to be authorized to read reports results (in other words, the report needs to be exposed to this application).\n\nFor more in-depth questions regarding the integration, please get in touch with our partner Paessler. You can contact them here: https://www.paessler.com/contact or sales@paessler.com.\n\nMore information may be available via the following webpage: https://www.paessler.com/partners/technological-alliances/lansweeper\n\n-Don't forget to hand out Kudos and mark Solutions to replies you receive!-\n\nLS Tech Support Email: Support@lansweeper.com\n\nLS Tech Support KB: https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-support/"
