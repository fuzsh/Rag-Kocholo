        "text": "Paessler integrates Rhebo into its leading IT monitoring solution PRTG\n\nThe OT and ICS monitoring with anomaly detection extends cybersecurity to the Operational Technology (OT)\n\nSystem integration provides lean and cost-efficient solution via software containers\n\nLeipzig/Nuremberg, Germany, May, 20, 2021 - Rhebo, a Landis+Gyr company, and Paessler today announced the launch of a technological integration partnership for comprehensive cybersecurity in IT and OT. As a result, Rhebo received the status of an Uptime Alliance Partner of the Paessler AG. The partnership includes the integration Rhebo’s solution for industrial control system (ICS) monitoring and anomaly detection, called Rhebo Industrial Protector, into Paessler's leading IT monitoring solution PRTG Network Monitor.\n\n»Due to the digitalization of the industrial sector, the connection between enterprise IT and operational technology (OT) is steadily increasing,« comments Helmut Binder, CEO of Paessler, the background of the partnership. »Our PRTG Network Monitor already supports the evaluation of industrial protocols and methods such as OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Modbus, as well as the collection of asset performance and availability data. Rhebo, as an integrative service on top of our IT monitoring solution, now also creates visibility and security for the entire Industrial Control System.«\n\nTogether, Paessler and Rhebo provide an all-in-one system monitoring solution. Paessler’s PRTG monitors the entire IT environment and large parts of the OT environment. Rhebo monitors the ICS and identifies anomalies, delivers the missing information from the industrial environment, and complements the monitoring with advanced services and in-depth analyses. Rhebo Industrial Protector detects cyberattacks, manipulations, misconfigurations and also technical error states within the OT in real time.\n\n»PRTG Network Monitor is a comprehensive tool for monitoring and optimizing cybersecurity and asset performance,« adds Rhebo CEO Klaus Mochalski. »With over 300,000 users, it has defined standards worldwide and we are very pleased about the integration of Rhebo Industrial Protector to elevate the solution even further. As a result, a large number of industrial companies benefit directly from the additional services and can efficiently strengthen their cybersecurity and plant availability.«\n\nFor more information on the integration solution of Rhebo and Paessler visit https://rhebo.com/en/download/file/loesungsprofil-paessler-integration/.\n\nAbout Paessler AG\n\nPaessler believes monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind’s consumption of resources.
