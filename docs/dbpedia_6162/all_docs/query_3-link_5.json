        "text": "All PRTG Network Monitor licenses are available as subscriptions, paid annually. This way, you always have continued access to the latest version of PRTG including new features and security enhancements, as well as to our technical support.\n\nPRTG licenses differ by the number of sensors* that you can add to your monitoring setup:\n\nLicense name\n\nEnvironment size Number of sensors Number of devices PRTG 500Small Up to 500 About 50 PRTG 1000\n\nSmall & medium Up to 1,000 About 100 PRTG 2500\n\nMedium Up to 2,500 About 250 PRTG 5000\n\nLarge Up to 5,000 About 500 PRTG 10000\n\nVery large** Up to 10,000 About 1,000\n\n* In PRTG, sensors are the basic monitoring elements. One sensor usually monitors one measured value in your network, for example the traffic of a switch port, the CPU load of a server, or the free space on a disk drive. On average, you need about 5-10 sensors per device.\n\n** For very large environments, please also refer to our system requirements. If you have more than 1,000 devices, check out Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor.\n\nFor the 30-day Trial Edition, the number of sensors and devices is not restricted. The Freeware Edition includes up to 100 sensors for about 10 devices.\n\nNo, it is not possible to combine different PRTG Network Monitor licenses on one server, for example, buying a license for 500 sensors* and a license for 1,000 sensors does not mean that you can use 1,500 sensors in one installation. PRTG only accepts one license key per server. If you need more sensors, you can upgrade to a larger license any time.\n\n* In PRTG, sensors are the basic monitoring elements. One sensor usually monitors one aspect of a network device, for example the CPU load of a server. On average, you need about 5-10 sensors per device.\n\nIf you already have a PRTG Network Monitor subscription, you can always upgrade to a larger PRTG Network Monitor license if you need more sensors. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: You want to upgrade with the start of a new subscription period. In this case, your new license contract (including the use of a larger number of sensors) is effective as of the date your new subscription period starts. Your license key remains the same.\n\nScenario 2: You want to upgrade mid-term. In this case, your new license contract (including the use of a larger number of sensors) is effective as of the purchase date. Please note that with the upgrade, a new subscription period starts. You will get a discount for the remaining days of the previous subscription period. Your license key remains the same.\n\nIt is also possible to upgrade within the PRTG product family and switch to a PRTG Enterprise Monitor or a larger PRTG Hosted Monitor subscription.\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to [email protected]."
