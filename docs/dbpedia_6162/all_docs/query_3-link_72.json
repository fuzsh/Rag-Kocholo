        "text": "LOS ANGELES and NUREMBERG, Germany, May 26 /PRNewswire/ -- Paessler AG (www.paessler.com), a leading provider of network monitoring and performance optimization solutions, today announced the results of a recent customer satisfaction survey that shows nearly 95% of its PRTG Network Monitor customers would recommend the product to a colleague or peer. The results underscore the effectiveness, affordability and ease of use of PRTG Network Monitor in helping IT professionals ensure maximum uptime on critical network infrastructure, reduce troubleshooting time and expense and optimize IT resources.\n\n\"The real proof of customer satisfaction is in the customer's likelihood to recommend the product,\" said Dirk Paessler, CEO of Paessler AG. \"Not only did the vast majority say they would recommend PRTG, more than 35% said they already have. We're especially proud of that—and grateful for our customers' continued support of our products.\"\n\nTime, Cost Savings are Key Benefits\n\nAmong the key benefits driving this high likelihood to recommend the product, PRTG customers say they've realized \"a lot\" or \"exceptional\" value in terms of network management time savings and reduced cost. Where many other similar products are well-known for complicated installation and configuration, 81% of PRTG users said PRTG's quick installation time is a valuable benefit to their organization, while more than 90% said ease of use and reliability were each a key benefit.\n\nFavorite Features: Uptime/Downtime Monitoring and Alerts\n\nCustomers also ranked the most important features of the product as part of the survey. Nearly 90% ranked PRTG's hallmark uptime/downtime monitoring of network services and devices as very important. Its unique alarm feature, which alerts personnel via email, text or phone call when a network fault occurs or a critical threshold is exceeded, also earned high marks: nearly 80% of customers said this feature was very important. Other favorite features include PRTG's flexible and customizable reporting system, automatic network discovery and configuration, bandwidth usage accounting and user activity monitoring.\n\nSupport: There When You Need It\n\nIn rating their experience with Paessler's support team, more than 48% of customers said they've actually had no need to contact support yet—an indication of PRTG's intuitive setup and configuration, exceptional ease of use and flexibility. Of those who had contacted support, almost half said the support team was helpful and quickly resolved the problem.\n\n\"The fact that nearly half of our customers have never contacted our support team is actually great news for us,\" Paessler said. \"It confirms that all of our efforts to make PRTG the easiest to use network monitoring software on the market have been successful. And, with the recent expansion of our online, interactive knowledge base, we hope it's now even easier for customers to access the resources they need to get the most out of PRTG in their environment. Not that we don't like hearing from our customers, but if they don't need tech support that means it's working well for them.\"\n\nPRTG Network Monitor is ideal for businesses of all sizes looking to optimize network resources and reduce downtime. Its unique remote probe technology enables data center providers, MSPs, ISPs and virtually any kind of business—even those with remote locations—to gain complete visibility into network activity to prevent failures and outages before they take place, plus budget for upgrades based on real demand.\n\nFor more information about PRTG Network Monitor, visit www.paessler.com/prtg.\n\nAbout Paessler AG\n\nPaessler AG leads the industry in providing the most powerful, affordable and easy-to-use network monitoring and testing solutions.
