        "text": "Network management is an essential aspect of any successful IT business. Stated simply, network management is the process that identifies, tracks, and maps a network’s health so that you gain complete visibility over your network. The goal of network management is to help you proactively manage your IT environment and reduce the risk of zero-day vulnerabilities and other cybersecurity threats.\n\nIn doing your due diligence, you may be researching the best network monitoring and management tools and deciding which solution is right for your business.\n\nThis is where we come in. This comprehensive guide covers the top options in the market today based on scoring from leading review sites, such as G2 and Capterra. Additionally, we’ll cover the essential features your network management tool should have.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBest network monitoring & management software\n\nNinjaOne\n\nAuvik\n\nDomotz\n\nManageEngine OpManager\n\nPRTG Network Monitor\n\nDatadog Network Performance Monitoring\n\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor\n\nWhatsUp Gold\n\nNagios XI\n\nZabbix\n\nFinal Scores\n\nDo I need network monitoring & management tools?\n\nModern-day networks comprise different endpoint devices, such as routers, switches, virtual machines, and servers, all interconnected to form an organization’s IT infrastructure. As more businesses become remote and distributed, securing your network from various cyber threats has become increasingly important.\n\nRemember that each element of the modern-day network significantly increases the attack surface for cybercriminals to target. Great network management tools give you the visibility you need to carefully monitor and control these endpoints and ensure the smooth, uninterrupted performance of your organization’s network.\n\nA great way to think about network management is like your car dashboard: The different symbols flash when certain parameters are met, such as when your car has low fuel or someone is not wearing a seatbelt. Knowing that something is “wrong” allows you to rectify the situation and prevent an accident. In a similar fashion, network management tools are warning alarms that help you maintain the health and safety of your IT business.\n\n5 important components of network management tools\n\nIt’s worth noting that the primary purpose of network management is to deliver a secure, efficient, and reliable network to all your end users. As such, any good network management tool should be able to offer these 5 essential features.\n\n1. Centralized network monitoring\n\nYour IT team must ensure all necessary endpoints are connected and visible in your IT network. The best way to achieve this is through centralized network monitoring where you can perform all tasks in a single dashboard. This is particularly important for remote or hybrid teams.\n\n2. Automated management\n\nIdeally, your network monitoring tools should leverage automation to reduce the need for manual intervention. This also lowers the risk of human error or redundancy and frees your IT technicians to focus on higher-value tasks.\n\n3. Exhaustive and detailed message logging\n\nAny good network management tool can generate, store, and report message logging. This helps you meet industry standard KPIs and other compliance protocols. The most common logging mechanism for network management is the Syslog protocol, which records and transmits log messages across a wide range of systems.\n\n4. Configuration management\n\nBecause remote work has become more prevalent, it’s important that your IT team can maintain computer systems, servers, applications, and other IT components in their desired state, wherever they’re located. Configuration management is an essential part of any network management tool so that you can easily diagnose any network issues and monitor your entire IT infrastructure.\n\n5. Network Analytics\n\nYour network management tool needs to collect and analyze real-time data to improve your network’s performance, reliability, visibility, and security. A good software provider should utilize automation so your IT staff can spend less time on repetitive tasks.\n\nNow that we’ve discussed the basics of network management and what makes a great network management tool, let’s examine the best options available on the market today.\n\n10 best network monitoring & management tool solutions\n\nAll G2 & Capterra ratings data as of April 2024.\n\n1.
