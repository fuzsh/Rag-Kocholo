        "text": "This Project is in the middle of being reworked!\n\nYou can check the Releases for the previous functioning.\n\nPRTG Uptime SLA\n\nPRTG Network Monitor doesn't support any kind of System Uptime Sensor by Default, so I created the following to provide you with the Average Uptime of all sensors in your PRTG Network Monitor Deployment.\n\nDevelopment Roadmap:\n\nFeature Progress Comments Official Rework 100% Reworked the entire setup focusing on more optimal code. This did mean I have to redo everything. XML to JSON 75% Slowly working at moving away from XML to JSON for future proofing. PRTG's API v2 seems to be going the direction of JSON now. Weekly SLA 25% Planning to add a parameter that allow for Weekly SLA Yearly SLA 0% Planning to add a parameter that allow for Yearly SLA Monthly SLA 25% Planning to add a parameter that allow for Monthly SLA Custom SLA 0% Planning to add parameters that allow for custom timeframe Group of Sensors SLA 0% During my last look at the PRTG API, this wasn't possible. API Version 2 10% PRTG API Version 2 is currently in Alpha but is looking far more like most modern API's I am currently working with from other software vendors.\n\nQuick Overview of what each file does\n\nVersions Description Recommended Scanning Internval New-PRTGAPI.ps1 Sets up Environment Variables to be called by other Powershell files N/A PRTG_SLA.ps1 Averages the uptime of all sensors since the creation > 10 Minutes\n\nHow-To & Guide\n\nHow to Install PRTG-UPTIME-SLA with your PRTG:\n\nDownload and run the New-PRTGAPI.ps1\n\nThis will setup a prtgapi.json file in your Custom Sensors folder to be used by the other Powershell Functions.\n\nNavigate to the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PRTG Network Monitor\\Custom Sensors\\EXEXML\\ and place all the other .ps1 files here.\n\nHow to setup the Sensor:\n\nCreate a Group/Device, set the IPv4 address of the device as: 127.0.0.1\n\nWARNING: Using Localhost will cause preformance issues!\n\nAdd a EXE/Script Advanced Sensor and choose from the Drop down, the script you placed earlier.\n\nNOTE: You will want to set the Scanning Interval according to the Table above to limit performance impact on your system.\n\nAdd the SLA to your dashboards or reports!\n\nMy script is now posted and available from PRTG's Script World: Here"
