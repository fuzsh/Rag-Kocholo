PRTG has listed on their site that the HTTPS Advanced sensor should be able to do this but after setting it up we were getting numbers that were way off.\n\nI looked at trying to tie in IPERF somehow but only came across something that looked like it was designed for Linux (were all Windows). Was hoping someone in the community had any luck implementing a sensor like this.\n\n*Side note I’ve seen that Solarwinds has a tool that is designed for this or is at least advertised to do this but the price tag is well above what were looking for as a nonprofit.\n\nTrying to understand what you want to monitor.\n\nAre you looking at actual bandwidth used on the MPLS, the unused bandwidth (contracted bandwidth less used bandwidth), periodic testing of the maximum available bandwidth, …\n\nWhat I do is monitor the actual used bandwidth from the switch that my MPLS plugs into, with the chart having a fixed axis that matches my contracted bandwidth.\n\n@Paessler_AG\n\n@greg-paessler\n\nAre you trying to monitor the “available” bandwidth or the bandwidth being utilized at any given time. Do you have access to a router or switch in the path of the mpls circuit? If so see if that device supports netflow or possibly sflow. I use PRTG netflow sensors to query the Fortigate at each of our sites to monitor the traffic volume over our site to site VPN links.\n\nThanks everyone for all the replies! Sorry if I was unclear in the OP, what I’m looking for is essentially a speedtest like sensor to monitor our MPLS bandwidth or other connections. So say we are paying for a 1gig line I’m looking for a sensor that will test that line every X amount of minutes to see what the speed is ( I know it won’t be 100% with overhead and the fact other people will be using the circuits. )\n\nGreg (Paessler) The QoS Round Trip sensor almost seems like it would do what I’m looking for but not quite\n\n@greg-paessler"
