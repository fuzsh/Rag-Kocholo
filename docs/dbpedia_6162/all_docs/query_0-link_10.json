        "text": "Read Time: 7 minutes\n\nWhat Is Paessler PRTG Monitoring?\n\nPaessler PRTG is an IT monitoring solution that enables system administrators to monitor the health, performance, and availability of network devices, services, and applications across on-premises, cloud-based, or hybrid environments. It provides three main products: PRTG Network Monitor, suitable for small to mid-size IT infrastructure, PRTG Enterprise Monitor, suitable for large IT infrastructure, and PRTG Hosted Monitor, a cloud-based solution.\n\nBy providing real-time data and alerts for potential issues, PRTG helps IT systems operate smoothly. Its features include automatic network discovery, customizable dashboards and reports, distributed monitoring capabilities, and support for multiple technologies such as SNMP, WMI, SSH, HTTP requests, and flow protocols like NetFlow.\n\nPaessler PRTG Monitoring Products\n\nPRTG Network Monitor\n\nPRTG Network Monitor is designed for small to medium-sized IT environments, offering comprehensive monitoring capabilities. It provides a centralized view of the network, making it easier for system administrators to track the performance and availability of various devices, applications, and services. This solution supports a range of monitoring technologies, including SNMP, WMI, SSH, and flow protocols, ensuring compatibility with diverse IT setups.\n\nThe software includes features like automatic network discovery, which simplifies the setup process by identifying and categorizing all networked devices. Additionally, PRTG Network Monitor offers customizable dashboards and reports, enabling users to tailor their monitoring experience to specific needs.\n\nPRTG Enterprise Monitor\n\nPRTG Enterprise Monitor extends Paessler’s monitoring capabilities to large IT infrastructure. It enables organizations to monitor their entire IT environment, including business services and SLAs. Its architecture supports an unlimited number of PRTG servers, allowing for increased flexibility in monitoring extensive networks across various locations.\n\nThis enterprise solution includes features like centralized overview through PRTG MultiBoard, service-based SLA monitoring with ITOps Board, and offline monitoring capabilities. These functionalities cater to the needs of large-scale environments, providing a consolidated view of multiple installations and ensuring security for air-gapped systems.\n\nPRTG Hosted Monitor\n\nPRTG Hosted Monitor delivers cloud-based monitoring for IT infrastructure, suitable for both small and large environments. This service allows users to monitor systems, devices, applications, and traffic without installing dedicated hardware. Hosted on AWS servers, it’s easy to set up and use, providing flexibility through a subscription-based pricing model.\n\nThe service is designed for ease of maintenance with automatic updates and backups, allowing customers to avoid the complexity and overhead of managing PRTG infrastructure.\n\nLearn more in our detailed guide to PRTG monitoring (coming soon)\n\nPaessler PRTG Monitoring Features\n\nPRTG offers the following features:\n\nDistributed monitoring: Allows organizations to oversee multiple remote locations through a single interface, useful for geographically dispersed sites. System administrators can centrally manage and analyze the health and performance of all IT assets.\n\nAutomatic network discovery: Simplifies the initial setup and ongoing management of IT monitoring. It automatically identifies all devices within a network, such as servers, routers, switches, and printers, and creates appropriate monitoring sensors for them.\n\nMaps and dashboards: Offer users a visual representation of their IT infrastructure, allowing for real-time monitoring and quick access to data from various devices and services. With the PRTG map designer, users can create custom maps that display live status information, making it easier to understand the network’s performance.\n\nCustomizable reporting: Allows users to generate detailed reports on the status and performance of their IT infrastructure. Administrators can select specific data points, set the reporting period, and design the layout of reports to meet their unique requirements.\n\nPaessler PRTG Monitoring Limitations\n\nWhen evaluating PRTG, you should be aware of the following limitations, reported by users on the G2 platform.\n\nAlarm Management Complexity\n\nManaging alarms in PRTG can become complex due to the volume and variety of alerts generated across the IT infrastructure. As networks expand and diversify, system administrators may face challenges in prioritizing and responding to alarms. They need to fine-tune alert thresholds and filter out false positives to minimize unnecessary notifications.\n\nCost\n\nThe cost of PRTG is influenced by the scale of deployment and the monitoring needs of an organization. PRTG offers a free version with limited sensors for small networks, but larger deployments can be expensive, with associated software licensing and maintenance costs.\n\nCustomization Requirements\n\nCustomizing PRTG to fit specific monitoring needs requires understanding both the IT infrastructure and the tool’s capabilities. Users may need to invest time in setting up custom sensors, maps, and reports that align with their operational objectives, which can require significant time and effort.\n\nPaessler PRTG Alternatives\n\n1.
