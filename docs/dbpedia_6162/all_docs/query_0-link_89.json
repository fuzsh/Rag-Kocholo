With our free apps for Android and iOS, you can get push notifications delivered directly to your phone.\n\nAdapt the notification system to suit your needs and schedule alerts (such as ‘no low priority alerts at night’), or avoid alarm floods by using dependencies.\n\nYou can even use our PRTG API to write your own notifications."
