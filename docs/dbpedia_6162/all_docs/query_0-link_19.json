        "text": "Spiceworks Network Monitor has been discontinued, and the Connectivity Dashboard wasn’t a good replacement last time I checked.\n\nCheck out PRTG. It’s free for 100 sensors, and they say you’ll average about 10 sensors per device.\n\nTry Nagios Xi , free for 10 nodes (servers in your case) and unlimited services per server/node\n\nHave been using it for the past years and very happy with it.\n\nOr you can try Zabbix, it takes a bit of learning at first how to configure monitors.\n\nHey OP! If you’re interested, WhatsUp Gold is a great option to consider. We actually have some free network monitoring tools available, so feel free to take a look at that, here . Depending on what you’d like to monitor, these are great in helping you manage network bandwidth, Syslog data, configuration files, virtual machines and more.\n\nHope that helps in your search!\n\nAre you monitoring just your servers, or your network devices as well? Observium has a nutjob for a lead developer, the adults forked off into LibreNMS and it works well. https://www.librenms.org/\n\nI find the Nginx wrapper for TLS the easiest path on an Ubuntu install, I’ve pretty much settled on that for all the service containers that need protection, so the setup isn’t any more complex than RocketChat or the other modern services.\n\nUnfortunately, your request is very general, making it difficult to provide a piece of targeted advice. Zabbix, Nagios, or Observium are very powerful and free options. Of course, free editions have some limitations, as usual. More simple free alternatives can be CheckMK and Multiping. You can also review this excellent blog for more ideas https://www.starwindsoftware.com/blog/you-cant-have-too-much-monitoring .\n\nHi @tweets79 ​​,\n\nfeel free and have a look at our Discover the 3 Paessler PRTG monitoring solutions PRTG Network Monitor . We offer a free-forever version with max. 100 sensors which is enough for 10 - 20 devices. To get up-and-running quickly, let the auto-discover run, to see what it finds. If that creates too much sensors, or way out more than you care about, then you can delete all the extra sensors.\n\nTo get the free version, you need to download the f****ree 30-day trail version, and then just let the trial expire. It will automatically revert to the free version after 30 days. The free version has the full functionality of the commercial version - it’s not “dumbed down” like many free licenses. The only difference is the number of sensors you can use.\n\nTo get an quick overview of PRTG, please have a look at this [Video] .\n\nBest,\n\nMichael\n\n@Paessler_AG\n\nHi @larryford8998 ​,\n\nPRTG includes a map designer that allows you to create maps / dashboards according to your needs. You can use a background image of your choice for the map. This can be a map of the US, a floor plan or any other image.\n\nFeel free and have a look at this video: How to set up a map in PRTG\n\nBest,\n\nMichael"
