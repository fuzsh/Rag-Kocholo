This guide will show you how to find inexpensive options that can still provide the essential monitoring functionality you need.\n\nAs you're shortlisting, trialing, and selecting network monitoring software, consider the following:\n\nWhat problem are you trying to solve - Start by identifying the network monitoring feature gap you're trying to fill to clarify the features and functionality the tool needs to provide.\n\nWho will need to use it - To evaluate cost and requirements, consider who'll be using the platform and how many licenses you'll need. You'll need to evaluate if it'll just be the IT team, or the whole organization that will require access. When that's clear, it's worth considering if you're prioritizing ease of use for all, or speed for your technical power users.\n\nWhat other tools it needs to work with - Clarify what tools you're replacing, what tools are staying, and the tools you'll need to integrate with. This could include your existing network infrastructure, various data sources, and your overall tech stack. You might also need to decide if the tools will need to integrate together, or alternatively, if you can replace multiple tools with one consolidated network monitoring software.\n\nWhat outcomes are important - Consider the result that the tool needs to deliver to be considered a success. Think about what capability you want to gain, or what you want to improve, and how you will be measuring success. You could compare network monitoring software features until you’re blue in the face, but if you aren’t thinking about the outcomes you want to drive, you could be wasting a lot of valuable time.\n\nHow it would work within your organization - Consider the solutions alongside your workflows and existing infrastructure. Evaluate what's working well, and the areas that are causing issues that need to be addressed. Remember every business is different — don’t assume that because a tool is popular that it'll work in your organization.\n\nBest Network Monitoring Software Reviews\n\nHere you’ll find my choices for the best network monitoring software and tools:\n\n1\n\nAuvik\n\nBest for visual representations of networks\n\nFree demo available\n\nPricing upon request\n\nVisit Website\n\nRating: 4.7/5\n\nAuvik is a cloud-based network management software designed to provide visibility and control over network infrastructure.
