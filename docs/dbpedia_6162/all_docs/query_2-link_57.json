        "text": "Network monitoring tools are becoming an increasingly complex decision for network administrators.\n\nWith the global network monitoring market projected to grow from $3.34 billion in 2023 to $6.97 billion by 2030, new solutions are emerging faster than ever. All these new options make it difficult to cut through the noise and identify which tool offers the right blend of features, scalability, and affordability.\n\nIn this article, we’ll help simplify the selection process by comparing 10 top network monitoring tools. We’ll provide an overview of network monitoring, discuss key capabilities to evaluate, and offer actionable insights to help you pick the ideal solution tailored to your needs.\n\nWhether you want to reduce downtime, create network maps, integrate monitoring data with existing platforms, or gain greater visibility into network traffic, this guide will help cut through the complexity so you can find monitoring software well-suited to your requirements.\n\n💡Pro tip: TLDR? Jump to our network monitoring tools comparison chart.\n\nWhat is network monitoring?\n\nNetwork monitoring is the process of monitoring devices—often referred to as nodes—within a network to determine their health and availability. The purpose of network monitoring is to give administrators real-time insights and visibility about the condition of their network, identify trends, and rapidly detect or prevent issues and outages.\n\nServers, switches, routers, firewalls, cloud infrastructure, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices are examples of commonly monitored network nodes.\n\nNetwork monitoring protocols\n\nThe network discovery and real-time monitoring that occurs as part of the network monitoring process is implemented using a wide variety of protocols. Each protocol comes with its own pros and cons, and most popular network monitoring tools will use multiple protocols.\n\nSome of the most popular network monitoring protocols\n\nSNMP: The Simple Network Management Protocol, a.k.a. SNMP, is one of the most common network monitoring protocols. SNMP can be used for polling (a monitoring station queries a network device) and notifications (a device sends an SNMP TRAP or INFORM to a monitoring station).\n\nICMP (ping): The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is the protocol that the popular ping and traceroute/tracert commands use. Because ping is a great way to determine if a device is up or down and the latency and jitter of network connections, ICMP is often used in network monitoring.\n\nIPMI: Intelligent Platform Management Interface or IPMI allows for monitoring and management of servers independent of the operating system. Network monitoring tools use IMPI to collect data such as CPU and memory utilization from monitored servers.\n\nFlow protocols: The term “flow protocols” actually refers to a number of different protocols that provide data on the flow of network traffic. Flow protocols can be a great way to gain deep insights into how data flows between devices in your network. Popular flow protocols include NetFlow, sFlow, and jFlow.\n\nSyslog: Centralized logging makes network monitoring and incident response much more efficient than analyzing log files on each individual device. The syslog protocol provides a standard for network devices to send logs to a monitoring station. Because syslog messages indicate severity, it becomes easy for administrators to filter and act on the right events.\n\nHTTP(S): Hypertext Transfer Protocol a.k.a. HTTP and its encrypted counterpart HTTPS (the S is for secure) is effectively the language of the web. This makes HTTP(S) a common protocol for monitoring web servers and applications that expose an API (application programming interface) via HTTP(S).\n\nEnterprise network monitoring protocols\n\nEnterprise-grade network monitoring software will offer even more protocols—like SSH (secure shell), WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol), and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)—and other tools to further expand your network visibility. For example, port scanning, packet captures, and agents (data collectors installed on network endpoints) are other common tools used in network monitoring.\n\nWhich protocols you should use will vary depending upon your network devices and the level of visibility and reporting you want to achieve.\n\nFor example, for simple uptime monitoring, ICMP using a continuous ping may be enough. Alternatively, for complete network visibility and network mapping, you may use a combination of agents, pollers (e.g., SNMP and HTTP GETs), flow protocols, and inbound notifications (e.g., SNMP TRAPs and syslog messages).\n\nNetwork monitoring vs network management\n\nIt’s important to know that network monitoring and network management work hand-in-hand to ensure networks run smoothly, but they serve different primary purposes.\n\nNetwork monitoring focuses on gathering performance data, visualizing the real-time status of network components, and immediately detecting issues. Monitoring tools track key metrics over time, like throughput rates, device uptime, and bandwidth utilization. When predefined thresholds are exceeded, or problems emerge, monitoring software alerts teams so they can quickly address network problems. The main goal of network monitoring is to provide continuous oversight and visibility into network health.\n\nNetwork management encompasses a much broader range of functions aimed at ensuring that a network is operating effectively and efficiently, one of which is monitoring network performance. Network management involves taking direct actions to control, secure, optimize, and plan capacity for the network infrastructure itself. Activities like adding/removing devices, configuring equipment, managing policies and access controls, updating firmware, and performing maintenance all fall under the umbrella of network management.\n\nWhile network monitoring simply detects and diagnoses issues, network management maintains the critical backbone of the network. And, just like monitoring, some of the best network management tools assist IT staff in achieving efficient and cost-effective network management.\n\nNetwork monitoring tools are important because they provide a way for admins to effectively and efficiently use network monitoring to improve network performance and uptime. They can also enable managed service providers (MSPs) to provide their clients with better service and streamline reporting and billing workflows.\n\nFor example, with the right network monitoring solutions, admins and MSPs can:\n\nReduce downtime\n\nEnable automated responses when outages occur\n\nGain insights into network performance and data flows\n\nMore efficiently utilize resources\n\nProactively identify when and where new infrastructure is needed\n\nRapidly detect abnormal or malicious network traffic\n\nSoftware that combines multiple network monitoring tools goes by a few different names. NMS (network monitoring/management system) and RMM (remote monitoring and management) are two of the most popular.\n\n4 key functions of network monitoring\n\nRegardless of the name, these network monitoring solutions provide four key functions to enable effective network monitoring:\n\nNetwork discovery: To begin the monitoring process, network monitoring tools need to identify what devices to monitor. Some tools automate the discovery process, while others require manual configuration. Ultimately, the goal is to find any device on your network.\n\nReal-time monitoring: Once devices are discovered, continuous monitoring of their uptime and condition occurs using one or more network monitoring protocols or tools. Based on statistics gathered from real-time monitoring, network monitoring tools can generate alerts and reports for administrators. In many cases, the data captured during discovery and monitoring is used to create interactive network maps to help improve network visualization.\n\nAlerting: Alerts, such as text messages, emails, Slack messages, and warnings in a management interface, notify IT teams when something goes wrong—for example, a router interface going down or a database server running low on space.\n\nPro Tip: Setting up good alert thresholds for notifications is a key aspect of effective network monitoring. You don’t want to miss important events, but too many unimportant alerts and admins get alarm fatigue.\n\nReporting: Logs and reports help administrators understand trends that help with everything from identifying potential issues to demonstrating to clients that you’ve met SLAs (service level agreements).\n\nIn our 2024 IT Trends report, we saw an 11% increase in ITs experiencing configuration management challenges over last year. That’s likely due to the fact that modern networks are only getting more complex. In the face of this complexity, having strong monitoring to maintain visibility and health is critical for the modern network.\n\nWithout full visibility, achieving efficient and effective management is beyond challenging. As you evaluate options, look for solutions that offer these five must-have features:\n\n1. Custom dashboard views\n\nUser-friendly dashboards give you at-a-glance insights into how the network is running and where problems may be arising. Choose tools that make it easy to customize views with graphs, charts, and layouts that work for different teams or locations. Avoiding info overload is key—keep it simple but still comprehensive.\n\n2. Smart alerting based on thresholds\n\nYou need alerts when performance metrics cross certain thresholds indicating bigger issues. The best tools simplify setting alert rules for bandwidth, latency spikes, error rates increases and more. Make sure you can tailor alert sensitivity to avoid unnecessary noise while still being notified about the meaningful events.\n\n3. Adaptability as networks scale up\n\nIt’s a given that networks change constantly—new gear gets added as capacity ramps up. Your monitoring solution should auto-detect when new hardware comes online and seamlessly fold it into the system. Rapid adaptability means no complex reconfiguring or holes in visibility when things get added or upgraded.\n\n4. Reporting to spot trends and plan ahead\n\nRobust reporting equips you to spot trends around network traffic patterns, protocol performance, and more, so you can make data-based decisions around capacity growth and other investments. Compliance audit prep also gets far easier when detailed historical reporting is at your fingertips.\n\n5. Tracking configuration changes\n\nIn bigger networks, changes often create problems that disrupt availability. Choose systems that learn new device settings following changes and baseline ideal configurations. This way, you can easily pinpoint when a recent tweak may have caused issues. Maintaining an audit trail of modifications also speeds up security forensics.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics of network monitoring and network monitoring tools, let’s take a look at the 10 best network monitoring tools available today, spanning both paid and open-source solutions.\n\n1.
