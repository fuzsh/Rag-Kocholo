        "text": "I have been researching and testing a variety of Network Monitoring solutions for our network, and either the program has a part of what I need, or it simply won’t function. Below are all of the monitors i’ve tried, and what my results have been, as well as what i’m needing to do with the Network Monitor.\n\nMonitor device specific traffic as well as packet inspection\n\nMonitor WAN interface to view average traffic over a period of time, as well as live traffic over time. I need to be able to see spikes and when they occur.\n\nView LAN traffic as a whole, viewing averages of traffic as well as live traffic over time, again to view spikes and when they occur.\n\nAbility to generate reports, or pull data to create reports over the above data.\n\nI can monitor traffic for specific devices by using SNMP to monitor the interface of the device. This provides the data I need, but monitoring tools will not show me the spikes, or they do not have the data being reflected accurately. I can do this for the LAN as a whole, and WAN as well.\n\nHere are the monitors i’ve tried.\n\nSpiceworks: Works well to provide a live feed through the network monitor, but the data is not stored. I can’t look at traffic over the last 3 hours and see if any issues have occured. Sure, I can use the alerts, but that’s not the purpose that i’m going for. I want to be able to look over the last business day, view and record all spikes, and go from there. Not all spikes that may have occured will trigger an alert. Using the Spiceworks Desktop application, I can pull the bandwidth data for all devices, but this only shows total traffic, again not providing the traffic over time, like a line graph.\n\nSolarwinds: OIDs are not reflecting the correct interface names. While I can see all traffic on the switch ports, I can’t get any of the details I need for the graphing functions and data collection Solarwinds NTA uses. The OIDs had previously been corrected for PRTG, but I cannot find what is needed to do this correction for Solarwinds.\n\nPRTG: While everything could be configured and showed to be running appropriately, I noticed after 24 hours, traffic seemed extremely light. Monitoring Spiceworks data and PRTG data simultaneously, I found that only 1/10 of data was being reported by PRTG. While it was working, it was inaccurate.\n\nWireshark: Everyone’s favorite Network monitor, and one of my favorites as well, but the raw data and old school interface isn’t what my Director is needing. We want it to where I can do the more in depth diving into our network like I need to do, while also having a surface view the others can see and understand, like what PRTG and Spiceworks has.\n\nAnyone willing to help me by bouncing ideas for Network Monitors off me. Free is of course preferred, but with what i’m needing, that may not be able to happen. I don’t mind mixing and matching as well, just as long as the job can be done.\n\nTo explain the issue with Solarwinds a little more, in the NetFlow portal, I can see all devices. I can see total amounts of traffic passing in bytes. No other tables in NetFlow are being populated. When I look at the interface list, I noticed that all of the Interface IDs for the Switch do not match the actual Interface IDs on the switch. They are reflecting very old data from when they were first configured.\n\nWhen choosing “Manage Sources” I also found that there were no exporters. The devices have been auto-discovered like the forums suggest, and I cannot find what needs to be done to setup a device as an exporter for Solarwinds. This means that I have no data whatsoever that can help me in viewing the full functionality of Solarwinds. I have reached out to Solarwinds, but i’m still waiting to hear back.\n\nWe use PRTG. I feel that you may have a configuration issue with PRTG. It could be caused by the number of monitoring applications polling your equipment. PRTG has the ability to set up very nice reports that can be sent on schedule as well as notifications if traffic patterns are abnormal. Make sure PRTG discovered your device correctly and verify all of the interfaces are there and receiving data. You can call their support when using the trial version to make sure things are set up properly. I have tried Zabbix, Naxios, Solarwinds (too darn expensive, IMO), Cacti, etc. We still use Wireshark in conjunction with PRTG if we are looking to inspect a specific traffic pattern. I don’t believe that PRTG has the ability to capture packets for packet inspection (your first requirement). You may need to add a SIEM product in conjunction with PRTG.\n\nHopefully, someone from PRTG will clarify the support obligation with running their trial."
