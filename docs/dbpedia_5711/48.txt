School of Filmmaking

Ranked among the best film schools in the country, the filmmaking school at UNCSA knows that you won’t become a filmmaker by just sitting in a classroom. In your first two years at UNCSA, you will direct and shoot numerous digital projects as you take hands-on courses in every facet of modern film production. Then you’ll choose a concentration—animation, cinematography, directing, editing & sound design, producing, production design, or screenwriting—and collaborate with classmates on original short films, submitted to festivals around the world.
