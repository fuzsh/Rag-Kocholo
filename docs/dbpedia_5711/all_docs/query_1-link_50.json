They capture time and place, and give shape to memory and history. They are also fleeting: they unfold in time, and are affected by time. Environmental factors, material decomposition, and increasingly also technological obsolescence threaten the carriers on which they are held, and therefore, endanger their accessibility.\n\nIn the Professional Master's programme in Heritage Studies: Preservation and Presentation of the Moving Image, we consider how we can deal with such threats. How can we preserve audio-visual materials for future generations? How can we present them, whether as a source of information, entertainment, or aesthetic enjoyment, and whether to broad audiences or specialist ones?\n\nIn recent decades, the use of digital technologies has profoundly transformed the ways in which moving images and sound are produced and consumed. Such developments also affect our audio-visual heritage, and the ways in which we preserve them and make them accessible. Inevitably, then, digital standards, tools and workflows figure prominently in the discussions we have in class and during field trips.\n\nStudying Preservation and Presentation of the Moving Image at the University of Amsterdam\n\nThe Netherlands, and the city of Amsterdam in particular, provides an ideal location for the study of audio-visual preservation and presentation as key to the work of media archives, film and contemporary art museums, festivals, distribution agencies, broadcasting companies and film studios. The Master's programme collaborates with a range of national and regional institutions; among others, the EYE Filmmuseum (the Netherlands’ national centre for film culture), the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (the national broadcast archive), LIMA: the Living Media Art Foundation and V2_Institute for the Unstable Media (both media art institutions) and the International Film Festival Rotterdam (the country’s foremost film festival and meeting point for national and international producers and distributors). These organisations not only host tours and supervise interns, but also participate in the programme’s core courses and contribute to the development of an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nDuring their training at UvA, students in the Preservation and Presentation of the Moving Image programme consider different types of moving images and sound, focusing alternately on cinema, broadcasting, and media art objects (all of those in analogue and digital manifestations). In the first year of the programme, students spend acquiring critical knowledge; in the second, they put it into practice during an extensive internship.\n\nDegree certificate\n\nPreservation and Presentation of the Moving Image is an accredited degree programme of the Master’s in Heritage Studies. Upon successful completion of the programme, graduates receive a legally accredited Master’s degree in Heritage Studies, and the title of Master of Arts (MA).\n\nContact:\n\nDr. E.L.

It provides formal, university-level education for personnel working or wishing to work in the audiovisual archiving industry. By providing audiovisual archivists with a distinctive professional identity and a distinctive ethical and philosophical base, it makes available what is now recognised by the industry as a necessary requirement for improving professionalism in that industry. Students will gain an overview of the discipline and its history, philosophy and ethics, before concentrating on four areas: collection management, collection development, preservation, and access. Its online delivery mode makes this course accessible to international students.\n\nSubjects can be studied as part of the Graduate Certificate in Audiovisual Archiving (which requires the completion of four subjects) or as single subjects. To be awarded the Graduate Certificate in Audiovisual Archiving, students must complete the subjects\n\nwhich are offered in the following sequence:\n\nSession I (February to June)\n\n- Audiovisual Archiving\n\n- Preservation of Audiovisual Material\n\nSession II (July to November)\n\n- Audiovisual Archiving 2\n\n- Digital Preservation\n\nFor each 8-point subject you are enrolled in, you should expect to spend 10 to 12 hours per week working on assignments and assigned readings, tutorial assistance, individual or group research/study, forum activity, workplace learning, and attending lectures, intensive schools, or examinations. If you are studying four subjects per session, this is equivalent to a full-time job. The workload for some subjects may vary as a result of approved course design.\n\nFor more information, please check the website.\n\nTo apply\n\nApplications generally close with CSU at the end of November for the year before study commences. If you wish to apply, please try to meet this date. Applications after this date will be accepted if places are available.\n\nIf you are enrolling into the Graduate Certificate in Audiovisual Archiving (4 subjects). Note that if you wish to take only one subject, you can enrol as an Associate Student.\n\nContact\n\nCourse Supervisor : Dr Robert Pymm\n\nE-mail: rpymm@csu.edu.au\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nHochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft\n\nConservation-Restoration Programme\n\nhttp://kr.htw-berlin.de/ (Master)\n\nhttp://krg.htw-berlin.de/ (Bachelor)\n\nThe HTW – University of Applied Science’s degree course in the preservation of audiovisual and photographic cultural heritage offers a uniquely interdisciplinary scientific-materials and hands-on training approach. Film preservation, the youngest of conservation and restoration disciplines, is pursued in an in-depth programme, not only alongside photography preservation but within the entire context of cultural heritage conservation.\n\nIndividual professorships at HTW are devoted to teaching each of the respective realms of cultural heritage to be preserved – archaeological and historical artefacts, modern materials and industrial heritage, and audiovisual and photographic heritage – as well as to teaching the practices of unearthing and scientifically investigating cultural heritage (i.e., field archaeology and conservation science).\n\nStudents enrol in one of the programme’s focus areas to participate both in interdisciplinary classes across courses and in focus seminars by the respective teachers or visiting scholars in the specialties unique to their field. Course topics for the audiovisual/photographic preservation curriculum thus range from cultural to film and photo history; manual photography retouching to digital moving image processing; general materials science to photographic chemistry; and collection surveys and passive conservation to film reconstruction and restoration. Within the curriculum, the choice of individual projects, course and thesis subjects, and external internships allows students to pursue a somewhat broader education, or to focus on a particular area of interest (for instance, film preservation or sound restoration).\n\nThe school offers both a Bachelor’s degree and a subsequent Master’s programme. Given certain prerequisites, candidates with Bachelor’s degrees from other programmes may directly enrol for the Master’s degree, offering further opportunities for those with previous moving image studies or preservation training or credentials. Graduates from the programme have thus found employment in institutions ranging from EYE Filmmuseum to the Deutsche Kinemathek, from the Swedish Film Institute to the Bundesarchiv/German Federal Archives.\n\nTeaching is both in German and English; thus a German language certificate is indeed required for the programme. That being said, international visitors have always been a vital and integral part of the student body, and the programme continues to embrace an international, global approach.\n\nThus, international candidates interested in studying moving image preservation in Germany in one of the world’s most vibrant municipalities are emphatically encouraged to apply.\n\nThe course brochure (in English) can be downloaded HERE.

Caragiale\n\nMasters in Audiovisual Archives: Preservation and Programming\n\nhttps://scenaristicafilmologie.ro/en/ma-in-audiovisual-archives-preservation-and-programming/\n\nThe Master's programme Audiovisual Archives: Preservation and Programming is the first of its kind in Romania and Eastern Europe and is taught in English. For two years, the programme will provide its students with in-depth theoretical and practical training in these two central areas of audiovisual heritage preservation and valorization. A comprehensive restoration project requires documentation skills, a vast knowledge of the historical context and the aesthetic and technical codes of the period and space in which the film was made, as well as practical skills in identification, handling, cleaning, repairing, scanning, digital image and sound restoration and color correction. Similarly, putting together a film programme requires a broad film culture, curatorial vision, multi-register writing skills and the ability to moderate discussions with guests and audiences; an excellent knowledge of the materiality of the medium is also essential. This Master’s programme aims to form professionals who will be equally competent in all of these activities.\n\nCourses and Perspectives\n\nSome of the lectures and seminars that will promote the understanding of audio-visual heritage as a dynamic subject in continuous dialogue with the present will be: “Histories and practices of audio-visual curation\", \"Preservation practices in the Romanian audio-visual context\" or \"Digital\n\nfilm restoration\". Combining theoretical and technological education, the Audiovisual Archives: Preservation and Programming programme will train multi-skilled specialists, up to date with the most current technical, methodological and ethical issues in the field and able to work in cinemas, festivals, media libraries, video libraries, museums, foundations, associations or private companies owning or producing audiovisual collections around the world.\n\nDURATION: 2 years\n\nCREDITS: 120\n\nNUMBER OF STUDENTS (FREE OF CHARGE): 6\n\nLANGUAGE: English\n\nADMISSION: September\n\nContact:\n\nEmail: arhive.audiovizuale@unatc.ro\n\nUniversitatea Nationala de Arta Teatrala si Cinematografica \"I.L.

It is the first program of its kind in a German university, and is offered by the Goethe Universität (Institute for Theater, Film and Media Studies) in conjunction with the DFF – Deutsches Filminstitut & Filmmuseum in Frankfurt am Main.\n\nIn addition to the various departments and archives of the DFF, the program benefits from a diverse, well-developed and enduring partnership with a wide range of cultural and audiovisual institutions located in the Frankfurt region, and also collaborates with numerous national and international bodies.\n\nArchiving, Programming, Presentation\n\nThe process of digitization has resulted in a fundamental transformation of all areas of research and practice in film culture. There is thus a clear demand from institutions for qualified academic personnel with a profound knowledge of film history and theory, who can meet the present challenges through critical thinking, long-term vision and with the specific tools of the discipline.\n\nAt the same time, we can presently observe an “analogue turn”, and, above all, a renewed deployment of the concept of the archive in artistic practice, as well as in preservation and exhibition practices. Phenomena such as the archival preservation of the world’s film heritage, the experimental use of film materials by curators and artists, and the presentation of moving images (both digital and analogue) for a public whose configurations are equally in motion, represent a field of tension and a significant challenge for work in film culture and academic reflection.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThe Masters in Film Culture prepares academic personnel for working in film and media archives. The program also represents a response to the question of how smaller disciplines, which do not train students for teaching in schools, can support their graduates in their transition to professional careers.\n\nCompleting the program qualifies students for professional roles in cinémathèques, film and media archives, print and television journalism, museums and collections with an emphasis on film and audiovisual media, film production and distribution companies, and independent organizations and initiatives, as well as for curatorial activities in both the exhibition sphere and in cinemas and festivals. There is also the possibility of progressing to doctoral study.\n\nContact:\n\nDFF - Deutsches Filminstitut & Filmmuseum: Dr. Ines Bayer, bayer@dff.film\n\nGoethe University Frankfurt: Bettina Schulte Strathaus, b.schulte-strathaus@tfm.uni-frankfurt.de\n\nLisbon, Portugal\n\nUniversidade Lusófona de Humanidades e Tecnologias\n\nFilm Heritage (MA)\n\nhttps://www.ulusofona.pt/en/masters/film-heritage\n\nThe Universidade Lusófona MA in Film Heritage offers an interdisciplinary training in two years that aims to meet the growing needs for documentation, conservation and restoration, programming and acces to audio-visual archives.

UCLA plays a key part in meeting those challenges – not only through the outstanding preservation and research conducted by the UCLA Film & Television Archive, but also by training the emerging generation of information professionals to anticipate, manage, and solve the preservation problems of audiovisual media.\n\nEstablished in 2002, UCLA’s Moving Image Archive Studies (MIAS) MA degree program is the first degree-granting graduate program in North America to offer specialized training in audiovisual preservation. In a reflection of the highly interdisciplinary nature of the media preservation field, MIAS is jointly sponsored by UCLA’s Film and Television Archive, Department of Information Studies and Department of Film, Television and Digital Media.\n\nMIAS is an intensive two-year course of study consisting of specialized seminars, directed studies, an extensive practicum program, workshops, screenings, guest lectures and technical demonstrations. In order to meet the increasing demands upon archival preservation and access that come with rapid technological change and the dramatic expansion of media types, MIAS’s principal goal is to ensure that each generation of moving image archivists can learn from the past and lead in the future.\n\nBeyond the Classroom\n\nMIAS links theory with practice. The MIAS practicum program supports hands-on training opportunities at archives, libraries, and laboratories in the Los Angeles area as well as at UCLA’s own Film & Television Archive. Its graduate seminars encompass the aesthetics and history of film and television, preservation and restoration philosophy, access and programming for the public, collection management, cataloging and documentation. The unique combination of UCLA faculty, award-winning preservationists, technical experts and archival specialists who are at the core of our program keeps MIAS at the very cutting edge of archival education.\n\nContact:\n\nSnowden Becker, MIAS Program Manager, becker@gseis.ucla.edu\n\nUCLA Moving Image Archive Studies\n\nP.O.

Audiovisual media have an ever-increasing impact on daily life in our societies. The settings in which these media are produced and used as well as the involved technologies and materials are becoming more and more diverse and complex. While the number of films is increasing every day, the period during which they are \"new\" is steadily decreasing. Every film that premieres today will be part of the film culture heritage of tomorrow. At the same time, every \"old\" film may be considered a \"new\" film as long as it hasn't been integrated in the canon or received enough attention.\n\nIn the future, there will be an increasing demand for specialists who review, archive, re-contextualize, and deal with the vast number of films that potentially belong to the global film heritage, who make them available to the public, and who ensure the transfer of knowledge about them.\n\nCareer opportunities for graduates are based on the following dimensions of film heritage:\n\nthe constantly changing definition of film heritage and the process of canonization (e.g., science, journalism, politics, education)\n\nfilms as part of the cultural memory of humanity (e.g., UNESCO)\n\nthe safeguarding, evaluation, restoration, and reconstruction of films (all types of public and private archives)\n\ncataloging and contextualization (databases, metadata)\n\ninstitutionalization (management and public relations)\n\nmedia politics and media law\n\nprogramming and editing for different media (cinemas, festivals, museums and exhibitions, online platforms, DVDs and Blu-rays, TV)\n\nfilm education (didactic materials and strategies)\n\nthe artistic, scientific, and commercial use of archive material\n\nContact:\n\nProgram Manager: Prof. Dr. Chris Wahl, c.wahl@filmuniversitaet.de\n\nProgram Office: Christiane Großkopf, c.grosskopf@filmuniversitaet.de\n\nRochester, USA\n\nSelznick School of Film Preservation\n\nThe Selznick Graduate Program in Film and Media Preservation\n\nhttp://eastman.org/selznickschool/\n\nThe L.

Jeffrey Selznick (1911-1997), the son of film producer David O. Selznick, chose George Eastman Museum as the place where he could fulfill his vision of a specialized venue for the education and training in the art and science of preserving cinema as an art form and, more broadly, as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe L. Jeffrey Selznick School of Film Preservation offers both a Certificate Program and a Masters of Arts Program:\n\na) the one-year Certificate program runs from September to June of each year, and is held in the premises of George Eastman Museum and in selected archival and laboratory venues.\n\nb) the MA strand, officially called The Selznick Graduate Program in Film and Media Preservation, is a two-year curriculum held in conjunction with the University of Rochester and offers a Masters of Arts in English.\n\nAdmission to the school is limited to a maximum of 15 students per academic year. Class size varies from time to time, but it typically consists of 10 to 14 students, with an ideal mix of certificate and MA students in equal parts. From the outset, the Selznick School was conceived as an international program; over the years, it has recruited from 29 different countries of all continents, from Canada and Mexico to Zimbabwe, Serbia, France, The Netherlands, South Korea, Japan, and New Zealand.\n\nFor further information about the program visit http://eastman.org/selznickschool/.

Un aspetto qualificante del programma di insegnamento è la sua attenzione per l’amministrazione, il management e il controllo intellettuale delle collezioni: oltre alla chimica e alla tecnologia digitale, il corso affronterà altre materie fondamentali, quali la catalogazione dei reperti; la conservazione di materiali non-filmici (poster, fotografie, documenti cartacei e apparecchiature d’epoca); la proiezione analogica e digitale; il management delle collezioni (amministrazione, budgeting, workflows, ricerca e gestione dei finanziamenti, legislazione sul diritto d’autore); la ricerca storica sul patrimonio audiovisivo; la presentazione al pubblico delle opere restaurate in un contesto collettivo (festival, rassegne e convegni) e individuale (accesso alle collezioni via internet) ed infine all’apprendimento della letteratura tecnica in lingua inglese.\n\nIl primo anno del corso persegue una duplice direttrice: da una parte, la teoria e metodologia del lavoro di conservazione dell’immagine in movimento; dall’altra, un’introduzione agli aspetti pratici del trattamento dei materiali d’archivio (il loro insegnamento è una costante in tutti e tre gli anni del corso).\n\nLe lezioni del secondo anno approfondiscono ciascuna componente tecnica, amministrativa e curatoriale mediante lo studio dettagliato di case studies selezionati dal corpo docente ed esercitazioni in materie quali ispezione, identificazione e riparazione della pellicola; catalogazione; analisi comparativa delle leggi sul copyright; design e gestione dei depositi climatizzati; studio approfondito di tutti i formati analogici, elettronici e digitali; simulazione di un budget per il restauro e per la strategia di finanziamento e fundraising; trattamento conservativo dei materiali non-filmici; costruzione di un complesso conservativo per i materiali fotochimici e digitali; pratiche di proiezione su pellicola e di supporti digitali; creazione di un programma di esibizione pubblica di film restaurati e di accesso alle collezioni via internet.\n\nNel terzo anno, gli studenti intraprendono un progetto relativo a una delle attività di conservazione del patrimonio audiovisivo, seguendone tutte le fasi dall’inizio alla fine: la definizione degli obiettivi; gli aspetti finanziari e manageriali del lavoro; l’analisi delle implicazioni legali del progetto (leggi sul copyright); la preparazione dei materiali in vista del loro restauro; la realizzazione del restauro vero e proprio, mediante l’utilizzo delle apparecchiature in dotazione alla scuola; la presentazione del lavoro, in forma di pubblica esibizione e di redazione di un rapporto scritto (in italiano e in inglese). Queste ed altre attività sono condotte da ciascuno studente – su base individuale o come parte di un team – con l’obiettivo di raggiungere una piena autonomia decisionale, monitorata dal corpo docente al fine di garantire la migliore qualità del prodotto finale. Così facendo, gli studenti acquisiscono tutte le conoscenze necessarie a ottimizzare le loro possibilità di impiego in qualsiasi struttura – pubblica o privata – pertinente alla conservazione e diffusione del patrimonio culturale audiovisivo. È da sottolineare in tal senso l’importanza di una preparazione a 360 gradi in questa disciplina: idealmente, al termine del triennio, ogni studente deve essere messo in grado di concorrere con successo al conseguimento di un impiego in qualsiasi settore relativo alla salvaguardia delle opere cinematografiche.\n\nTra i docenti degli ultimi anni: Luca Bandirali (Storia del Cinema), Massimo Benvegnú (Giurisprudenza), Paolo Caneppele, Paolo Cherchi Usai, Simone Corelli (Conservazione materiali sonori), James Kendall (Lingua Inglese)Alessandro Marotto (Restauro fotochimico), Francesca Romana Melodia (Conservazione), Silvia Moras, Gabriele Perrone (Ispezione e Identificazione dei materiali filmici), Alice Plutino (Restauro Colore), Alessandro Rizzi (Conservazione supporti), Mirco Santi, Gianandrea Sasso, Marcello Seregni (Programmazione e Accesso).\n\nSan Sebastian, Spain\n\nEQZE | Film Preservation Studies\n\nhttp://www.zine-eskola.eus/en\n\nToronto, Canada\n\nRyerson University\n\nFilm & Photography Preservation and Collections Management\n\nhttp://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/ppcm/index.html/\n\nFueled by the dramatic changes taking place in the world of both photography and film with the advent and growth of digital technology, our Master of Arts (MA) program in Film Photography Preservation and Collections Management now offers specializations in both film and photo preservation.

The course combines training activities on film works, documents, materials and technologies on the one hand, and the development of creative skills and practical abilities on the other one. It also involves a great deal of different disciplines and innovative teaching methods, based on the key-principles of participation and cooperation (applied interdisciplinary projects, use of digital resources and tools, intensive seminars, practical exercises, lab teaching, specific training internships, experts and professionals within the film and media industry involved as teacher in classes and seminar activities).\n\nThe programme is articulated into four specific learning curricula:\n\nThe Film and Media Heritage curriculum includes teaching activities and studies in the fields of historical research and archival practices, media archeology, media sociology and creative media practices, art history, film philology and publishing, theories and methodologies of film and audiovisual restoration, relying on film and video digitization and restoration laboratories and facilities.\n\nThe Media Education curriculum focuses on research areas such as media philosophy and sociology of cultural and communicative processes and includes classes devoted to the critical and expressive use of media in primary education by developing knowledge of teaching methods and technologies. It also includes the study of transmedia storytelling theories and practices, of the key principles of media legislation and design, of creative and professional media practices.\n\nThe Digital Storytelling curriculum includes teaching in design, graphics, history and sociology of media, copywriting and digital marketing devoted to the development of specific skills in digital storytelling and multimedia audiovisual communication. It also provides the knowledge to design events and digital environments to enhance historical-cultural, artistic, museum, tourist or corporate heritage (digital curatorship and management).\n\nThe Cinéma/Archives curriculum offers the opportunity to attain an international double degree with the University de Lille (FR). It has a specific focus on archival research and practices, theories and methodologies of film and audiovisual restoration. It also relies on film and video digitization and restoration laboratories and facilities.\n\nThe Master degree courses are closely connected with istitutions in film heritage, culture and education as well as with private companies: coming in such a close contact with a wide range of areas of knowledge (academic, professional, educational, archival and exhibitional ones), studentes are encouraged to develop very specific sets of skills and know-how. The MA programme included state of the art laboratories with a complete production chain: screenwriting and production planning (Centro Ricerche Sceneggiature); digital archiving and filmmaking (Cinemantica); film and video preservation and restoration (La Camera Ottica) and Media Education and Digital Humanities (Digital Storytelling Lab). The training program also includes the International Film Studies Conference and Magis International Film Studies Spring School (FilmForum).\n\nUdine’s Master Degree course in Audiovisual Heritage and Media Education Studies is part of the I/MA/CS – (International Master in Cinema Studies) Network.\n\nContact:\n\nLaura Casella, MA coordinator laura.casella@uniud.it\n\nSimone Dotto, simone.dotto@uniud.it\n\nDipartimento di Studi umanistici e del patrimonio culturale\n\nPalazzo Caiselli, vicolo Florio 2/b\n\nUdine (UD), 34170"
