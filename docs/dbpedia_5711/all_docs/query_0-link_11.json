That’s why ProQuest offers a wealth of unique content for research, teaching and learning in this specialized discipline. Global indexes, filmographies, scripts, screenplays and other materials span three centuries, from the birth of film in the 1800s to today. Together, these materials provide a comprehensive view of film through the ages."
