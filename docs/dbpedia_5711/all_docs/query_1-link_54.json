Apply to your local council.\n\nGet advice\n\nThe type of licence you need depends on how you’ll use the films - see the Independent Cinema Office (ICO) guidance. Contact the ICO if you need more help.\n\nShowing TV broadcasts that include film\n\nCheck with a licensing company or the film’s copyright holder whether you need their permission to show the TV broadcast in public. See the Intellectual Property Office’s guidance on showing television broadcasts in public.\n\nYou could be sued for damages if you show a film under copyright in public without being licensed. This includes DVD, Blu-Ray and video formats.\n\nWhere to get your licence\n\nYou can get licences (for example annual or one-off) from companies like:\n\nFilmbank\n\nMotion Picture Licensing Corporation (MPLC)\n\nThese companies represent different film studios so you’ll need to make sure they cover the films you want."
