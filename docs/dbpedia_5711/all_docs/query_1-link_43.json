        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions About HBO\n\nGeneral questions\n\nWhat does HBO stand for?\n\nHBO stands for Home Box Office. This name reflects HBO’s origins, which emphasized airing uncut, ad-free movies. Today, HBO is known for providing a wide array of home entertainment, from blockbuster movies to award-winning series.\n\nWho owns HBO?\n\nHBO is a subsidiary of Home Box Office, Inc., which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhat happened to HBO Max?\n\nHBO Max is now Max. The enhanced service is still home to all of HBO, but now your favorite shows and movies are living alongside a wide range of crave-worthy genres. These include reality, lifestyle, food, true crime, and more. If you were an HBO Max subscriber, you’ll automatically get Max. Learn more about the service here.\n\nThe last few minutes get cut off when I record HBO shows. Are there any tips for recording?\n\nSometimes, HBO programs may run for longer than their scheduled times. To make sure your recordings don't cut off the end of a show, we recommend setting your device to stop recording five minutes after the show is scheduled to end. (For example, if Succession is scheduled to end at 9:30 PM, program your recorder to turn off at 9:35 PM.) Consult the manual for your DVR or other recording device for information about allowing additional time for scheduled recordings.\n\nYou can check our TV schedule online to get an idea of when programs will begin and end. But, please note, due to the unpredictable nature of live events, the actual start and stop time of live programming can vary significantly from the scheduled times.\n\nIs HBO programming available for use in the classroom?\n\nMany HBO documentary titles are available for educational use through Films for the Humanities & Sciences.\n\nHow can I get an autographed picture of someone on an HBO program or send them a personal letter?\n\nWe do not provide direct contact information for people affiliated with our programming. However, some performers and producers may provide us with an address for fan mail. In those cases, we’re happy to forward them any fan mail we receive. Whether or not they respond (and in what manner) is entirely up to them.\n\nProduction Questions\n\nHow can I visit the set of an HBO show?\n\nAs a rule, we do not make shooting locations open to the public. Concerts and sporting events do have an audience, but ticket sales are typically handled by the promoter of the event, not by us.\n\nWhere does HBO hold casting calls for its programs?\n\nGenerally, production companies are responsible for casting. How and where they choose to announce casting sessions varies and is up to them.\n\nHow can I submit an idea for a movie or show to HBO?\n\nWe do not accept submissions directly — all submissions to HBO must come through an agent. Therefore, we suggest that all scripts, screenplays, treatments, dramatizations, anecdotes, treatises, rousing yarns, fables, inspiring narratives, thrilling legends, sagas, epic poetry, intriguing whodunits, newspaper articles, one-act plays, short stories, skits, and novellas be sent to the literary agency of your choice.\n\nHow can I get information on the music used for HBO programs and promos?\n\nThe music featured in programs is usually credited in closing credits, but sometimes producers may withhold the information in anticipation of releasing a compilation soundtrack (as was done with the first season of The Sopranos). Whenever possible, the episode information for a program will include the music credits and track information along with a corresponding Apple Music link.\n\nMany promos use excerpts from commercially-available music, but some are scored with original tunes and are unavailable for download.\n\nQuestions about getting HBO\n\nHow much does HBO cost?\n\nThere are multiple Max plans to choose from. Visit Max.com to compare plans and view pricing information.\n\nYou can also subscribe to HBO through your television provider. In that case, costs can vary, and you’ll need to contact your provider for pricing details.\n\nCan I get HBO outside of the United States?\n\nBuilding on its strong position in the US, Home Box Office has become a major player in the expanding international media arena. Currently, HBO programming is available in parts of Asia, South Asia, Central Europe, and Latin America.\n\nQuestions About HBO Licensed Merchandise\n\nWhere can I buy HBO Official Licensed Merchandise?\n\nHBO licensed merchandise is generally distributed to specialty and gift stores, mid- to upper-level department stores, catalogs, and online retailers, including the HBO Shop. In the HBO Shop, you’ll find the official merch for all of your favorite HBO Originals, from Game of Thrones to The White Lotus.\n\nWho licenses merchandise for HBO shows?\n\nHBO Licensing & Retail is the merchandising and licensing arm of Home Box Office. It oversees the development and marketing of Officially Licensed Merchandise for retail sale. HBO Licensing & Retail works very closely with its licensees, and with HBO programming executives and talent, to ensure the highest quality merchandise possible.\n\nFor more information please contact:\n\nHBO Licensing & Retail\n\nDirector, Licensing & Retail\n\n30 Hudson Yards\n\nNew York, NY 10001\n\nI have a great idea for a licensed product. How can I obtain a license to manufacture and distribute merchandise related to HBO programming?\n\nHBO Licensing & Retail does not accept unsolicited product ideas or samples. Licenses are granted and negotiated on an individual basis after a thorough evaluation by HBO Licensing & Retail.\n\nWhat categories of merchandise is HBO Licensing & Retail interested in licensing?\n\nHBO Licensing & Retail has licensed, or would be interested in licensing, most categories of merchandise, including: apparel, publishing, housewares, interactive games, electronics, paper goods, gifts and novelties, collectibles, toys and games, sporting goods, food and beverage, and health and beauty products. Some categories may not be appropriate for every licensing program. A partial list of HBO licensed merchandise can be found at the HBO Shop.\n\nWhich departments handle the development and distribution of soundtracks and Home Video/DVD?"
