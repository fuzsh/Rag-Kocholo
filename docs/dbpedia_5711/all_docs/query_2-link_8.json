        "text": "In English grammar, a direct object is a word or phrase that receives the action of the verb. In the sentence The students eat cake, the direct object is cake; the word eat is the verb and cake is what’s being eaten.\n\nDirect objects can get tricky, especially when used with indirect objects. In this quick guide, we’ll explain everything you need to know about how to use them correctly, including an explanation of direct vs. indirect objects, and we’ll also include plenty of direct object examples.\n\nBut first, let’s dive deeper into the essential question:\n\nWhat is a direct object?\n\nA direct object is a noun that receives the action of the verb. Don’t get the direct object confused with the subject—the noun that performs the actions—or the verb itself.\n\nDirect objects usually answer the questions “what?” or “whom?” Let’s take another look at the direct object example above.\n\nThe students eat cake.\n\nAsk yourself, “What did the students eat?” The answer is the direct object, which in this case is “cake.” Let’s try a new direct object example:\n\nThe family hugged their dog.\n\nWhat’s the direct object? Ask yourself, “Whom did the family hug?” The answer, of course, is “dog.”\n\nTransitive vs. intransitive verbs\n\nNot all verbs use a direct object. Some verbs, like laugh and sit, can’t use direct objects because it doesn’t make sense—you can’t laugh something or sit someone; that’s gibberish.\n\nVerbs that take a direct object are called transitive verbs, and those that do not are called intransitive verbs. It’s often difficult to tell the two types apart; sometimes intransitive verbs are followed by a prepositional phrase or adverbial phrase, which are different from direct objects.\n\nWe all laugh at Anania Williams.\n\nIn this sentence, Anania Williams may seem like the direct object, but the preposition at shows that it’s really a prepositional phrase. Because laugh is intransitive, the sentence “We laugh Anania Williams” is incorrect. We need a prepositional phrase to explain whom we’re laughing at.\n\nHowever, it is correct to say, “We enjoy Anania Williams.” In this case, the verb enjoy is transitive, so we can make Anania Williams a direct object, no preposition needed.\n\nSometimes a verb can be both transitive and intransitive, depending on the usage. If a verb has more than one meaning, some uses could be transitive while others are intransitive.\n\nWe drove to the mall. (intransitive)\n\nMy sister drove us to the mall. (transitive)\n\nThe best way to tell the difference is by experience, but if you’re unsure whether a verb is transitive or intransitive, be sure to check a dictionary. If you’re in a pinch, try asking “what?” or “whom?” after the verb—if you get an answer, then it’s transitive, and if you don’t get an answer then it’s intransitive. This is particularly useful for words that can be both transitive and intransitive, like play:\n\nShe played drums in a heavy metal band.\n\nShe played what? She played drums. Here, “play” is transitive.\n\nThe band played last night.\n\nThe band played what? Because there’s no answer, it means here “play” is intransitive.\n\nDirect object phrases and clauses\n\nDirect objects aren’t always just one word; sometimes they are entire phrases or even clauses. These phrases always act collectively as nouns, so aside from standard noun phrases, they’re often relative clauses (clauses that begin with a relative pronoun like “what”) or gerund phrases (noun phrases that start with gerunds).\n\nThe foul ball hit a car parked outside.\n\nDon’t forget what your mother said.\n\nEnglish professors love naming every tiny word in a sentence.\n\nYou can sometimes use the infinitive form of verbs as a direct object, but be careful you don’t confuse the to in an infinitive with the to in a prepositional phrase.\n\nEveryone wants to eat later.\n\nDirect object pronouns\n\nEnglish uses two different pronouns to refer to the same person, depending on whether the pronoun is used as a subject or an object. For example, if you were talking about yourself as the subject of a sentence, you would use I, but if you were talking about yourself as the object, you would use me.\n\nWith direct objects, always use the object pronoun. If you’re unfamiliar with the differences, you can review subject and object pronouns here, but there’s a quick chart as a reminder below.\n\nDirect objects vs. indirect objects\n\nOne of the most confusing topics in English is understanding the difference between direct objects vs. indirect objects. While direct objects answer the questions “what?” or “whom?” about the action of the verb, indirect objects answer questions like “to whom?” or “for what?”\n\nMy brother loaned me five dollars.\n\nIn this sentence, loaned is the verb and my brother is the subject (because he’s doing the loaning). The direct object is five dollars because it answers “what is being loaned?” The indirect object is me because it answers “to whom are the five dollars being loaned?”\n\nJust like direct objects, indirect objects are only used with transitive verbs. (Intransitive verbs never take an object, either direct or indirect.) While direct objects are necessary for transitive verbs, indirect objects are optional.\n\nDirect objects and linking verbs\n\nOne last rule about direct objects involves linking verbs like be, seem, and feel. Linking verbs seem to use direct objects, but the word following the linking verb is really called a complement, which is something a little different. A complement is often an adjective, but when it’s a noun, it’s easy to confuse it for a direct object.\n\nThey are an expert at procrastination.\n\nIn this example, “an expert” may seem like a direct object, but it’s really a complement, as it explains more about the subject, in this case, “they.” The verb are, a conjugation of be, is a linking verb, not a transitive verb.\n\nDirect object examples\n\nLet’s look at some direct object examples from literature and pop culture, so you can see how they work. The direct objects are underlined.\n\n“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.”\n\n—Napoleon Hill\n\n“‘Let me check my calendar’ is the adult version of ‘let me ask my mom.’”\n\n—Noelle Chatham\n\n“You miss\n\n100% of the shots you don’t take.”\n\n—Wayne Gretzky\n\n“Everything has\n\nbeauty, but not everyone sees it.”\n\n—Confucius\n\n“A bank is a place that will lend you\n\nmoney if you can prove that you don’t need it.”\n\n—Bob Hope\n\n“Let us sacrifice\n\nour today so that our children can have a better tomorrow.”\n\n—A. P. J. Abdul Kalam\n\n“I always wanted\n\nto be somebody, but now I realize [that] I should have been more specific.”\n\n—Lily Tomlin\n\n“In three words I can sum up\n\neverything I’ve learned about life: It goes on.”\n\n—Robert Frost\n\n“Nobody expects\n\nthe Spanish Inquisition.”\n\n—Monty Python\n\nThis article was originally written in 2015 by Ann Edwards.
