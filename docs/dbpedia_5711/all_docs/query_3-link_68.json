        "text": "Starting June 30, 2018, if you are traveling from an international last-point-of-departure to the U.S., powder-based substances in carry-on baggage greater than 350mL or 12 oz. may require additional screening at the central checkpoint. Powder-like substances over 12 oz. or 350mL in carry-on that cannot be resolved at the central checkpoint will not be allowed onto the cabin of the aircraft and will be disposed of.\n\nFor your convenience, place powders in your checked bag.\n\nThe measures have already been implemented at U.S. airports nationwide to identify and prevent potentially dangerous items from being brought aboard the aircraft. There are no changes to what is allowed in carry-on baggage at U.S. airport checkpoints.\n\nTSA does not prohibit photographing, videotaping or filming at security checkpoints, as long as the screening process is not interfered with or sensitive information is not revealed.\n\nInterference with screening includes but is not limited to holding a recording device up to the face of a TSA officer so that the officer is unable to see or move, refusing to assume the proper stance during screening, blocking the movement of others through the checkpoint or refusing to submit a recording device for screening.\n\nAdditionally, you may not film or take pictures of equipment monitors that are shielded from public view.\n\nYou will be asked to remove all items from your pockets (including non-metallic items) and walk into the imaging portal. Once inside, you are required to stand in position and remain still for a few seconds while the technology creates an image in real time. You will then exit the opposite side of the portal and collect your belongings. The entire process takes a matter of seconds.\n\nMillimeter wave imaging technology uses harmless electromagnetic waves to detect potential threats, which are highlighted on a generic outline of a person appearing on a monitor attached to the unit. If there isn’t an alarm, an “OK” appears on the screen with no outline.\n\nYou and your service dog/animal will be screened by a walk-through metal detector. You may walk through together or you may lead the animal through separately on a leash.\n\nIf you opt not to be screened by the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), or a walk-through metal detector (WTMD), you will undergo a pat-down.\n\nIf the metal detector alarms, you and your service dog/animal will undergo additional screening, including a pat-down.\n\nDuring the additional screening, do not make contact with the dog/animal (other than holding the leash) until a TSA officer has completed inspection of your dog/animal. TSA will not separate you from your service animal. If you have concerns about your screening, you can ask to speak with a supervisor or passenger support specialist at any point during the process.\n\nService dog/animal collars, harnesses, leashes, backpacks, vests and other items are subject to security screening. Items that are necessary to maintain control of the service dog/animal or indicate that the service dog/animal is on duty do not require removal to be screened.\n\nIf you need to relieve your service dog and must exit the security checkpoint, you and the service dog will need to go through the screening process again. You may request to move to the front of the line upon your return.\n\nMedication for service animals must go through X-ray or inspection screening. Please separate medications and inform the TSA officer that you carry these items for your service dog.\n\nFormula, breast milk, juice in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters are allowed in carry-on baggage and do not need to fit within a quart-sized bag. Remove these items from your carry-on bag to be screened separately from the rest of your belongings. You do not need to travel with your child to bring breast milk. Breast milk and formula are considered medically necessary liquids. This also applies to breast milk pumping equipment (regardless of presence of breast milk).\n\nIce packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs and other accessories required to cool formula, breast milk and juice - regardless of the presence of breast milk - are allowed in carry-on. If these accessories are partially frozen or slushy, they are subject to the same screening as described above. You may also bring gel or liquid-filled teethers, canned, jarred and processed baby food in carry-on baggage. These items may be subject to additional screening.\n\nYes. If you commit certain violations of federal security regulations, such as assault, threat, intimidation, or interference with flight crew, physical or sexual assault or threat of physical or sexual assault of any individual on an aircraft, interference with security operations, access control violations, providing false or fraudulent documents, making a bomb threat, or bringing a firearm, explosive, or other prohibited item to an airport or onboard an aircraft, you are denied expedited screening for a period of time. The duration of disqualification from participation in TSA PreCheck® is related to the seriousness of the violation and/or a repeated history of regulatory violations. Membership suspension can last up to five years for a first time offense or be permanent for egregious incidents or repeat offenses.\n\nTSA PreCheck® enrollees undergo recurrent criminal history vetting as a condition of their TSA PreCheck® enrollment. Temporary suspensions may occur as a result of recurrent vetting. Resolution typically takes less than 30 days, but can take up to 90 days. TSA PreCheck® enrollees found to have committed a disqualifying offense may have their TSA PreCheck® enrollment temporarily suspended or permanently disqualified, depending on the severity of the offense.\n\nIf you are unclear why you are not receiving the TSA PreCheck® indicator on your boarding pass, first check that your membership has not expired by looking up your KTN (Known Traveler Number) here.\n\nIf your KTN is still active, confirm with your airline that your KTN, name, and date of birth are accurate.\n\nIf you still do not have a TSA PreCheck® indicator on your boarding pass, or if you have questions concerning your TSA PreCheck® status, we're here to assist you. You can reach out to us through X (Twitter @AskTSA), Facebook Messenger (http://www.fb.com/AskTSA), Apple Business Chat or by texting \"Travel\" to AskTSA (275-872). You can also contact the TSA Contact Center at (866) 289-9673 or fill out an online form. If you've received a notice of violation, please reach out to your assigned case agent\n\nPlease note: TSA uses unpredictable security measures, both seen and unseen, throughout the airport. All travelers will be screened, and no individual is guaranteed expedited screening.\n\nVisit tsa.gov/precheck to select the enrollment provider that best meets your needs and has an enrollment location near you. You can pre-enroll online and make an appointment for the in-person process, or walk-in to an enrollment center without an appointment.\n\nThe online application takes five minutes to complete with the in-person visit taking 10 minutes. During the in-person process, the enrollment provider will collect your biometric data (fingerprints, photo), verify identity documents, and collect payment.\n\nAny website that claims to allow consumers to register for TSA PreCheck that does not end in “.gov” is not an official TSA PreCheck website. Consumers who are applying for TSA PreCheck for the first time cannot pay the application fee online, they must complete their application and pay in-person at a TSA enrollment center. First time applicants are not asked to provide payment information online.\n\nBefore you apply, we recommend that you review the various DHS trusted traveler programs: TSA PreCheck® Application Program, Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI, to ensure you meet the eligibility requirements and determine the best program for you. If you travel internationally four or more times a year, consider enrolling in Global Entry. If you take less than four international trips a year, TSA PreCheck is a great choice for domestic travelers.\n\nParticipating airlines display a TSA PreCheck® indicator directly on your boarding pass if you are eligible for TSA PreCheck based on your provided Known Traveler Number (KTN). Please ensure you add your KTN to your airline reservation while booking the reservation. If you do not have a valid boarding pass with a TSA PreCheck indicator on it, you cannot access the TSA PreCheck lane. If you believe you should have the TSA PreCheck indicator on your boarding pass but did not receive it, we're here to assist you. You can reach out to us through X (Twitter @AskTSA), Facebook Messenger (http://www.fb.com/AskTSA), Apple Business Chat or by texting \"Travel\" to AskTSA (275-872). You can also contact the TSA Contact Center at (866) 289-9673 or fill out an online form.\n\nNo. Medical certification is not required to change the gender options on your TSA PreCheck® application. If you are a member of the TSA PreCheck® Application Program, you may request a gender data update through the enrollment provider you initially applied with. Click here to find contact details for all enrollment providers or to look up your enrollment provider. Please note, updating your gender is not required to receive TSA PreCheck® screening. You are eligible to receive TSA PreCheck® screening even if your current gender differs from the gender you provided when you enrolled in TSA PreCheck®, as long as the name and date of birth on your reservation match the name and date of birth on record with TSA.\n\nIf you consistently do not receive TSA PreCheck®, we're here to assist you. You can reach out to us through X (Twitter @AskTSA), Facebook Messenger (http://www.fb.com/AskTSA), Apple Business Chat or by texting \"Travel\" to AskTSA (275-872). You can also contact the TSA Contact Center at (866) 289-9673 or fill out an online form.\n\nPlease be aware that if you have violated certain federal security regulations, including TSA security regulations, your access to TSA PreCheck® screening will be suspended. The duration of suspension from participation in TSA PreCheck® is related to the seriousness of the violation and/or a repeated history of regulatory violations. Membership suspension can last up to five years for a first time offense or be permanent for egregious incidents or repeat offenses.\n\nChildren 12 and under may accompany an enrolled parent or guardian in the TSA PreCheck lanes without restriction. Children 13-17 must have the TSA PreCheck logo on their boarding pass. To be eligible to receive the TSA PreCheck logo on their boarding pass, the passenger between the ages of 13 and 17 must be on the same airline reservation with a TSA PreCheck-eligible parent or guardian.\n\nChildren 17 and under who will be traveling alone or without a TSA PreCheck-eligible adult must apply for TSA PreCheck to have access to expedited screening. Please note, adults using gate passes to accompany children traveling alone will be directed to standard screening as gate passes are excluded from TSA PreCheck benefits. This applies even if the gate pass holder has enrolled in TSA PreCheck. The adult will not be permitted to join the child in the TSA PreCheck lane.\n\nPlease note, no individual is guaranteed expedited screening because TSA uses unpredictable security measures, both seen and unseen, throughout the airport. All travelers will be screened, and no individual is guaranteed expedited screening.\n\nFirst, check that your membership has not expired by looking up your account here.\n\nIf still active, confirm with your airline that your Known Traveler Number, name, and date of birth are accurate and that your airline participates in TSA PreCheck®. If you still do not have a TSA PreCheck indicator on your boarding pass, we can assist. You can reach out to us through X (Twitter @AskTSA), Facebook Messenger (http://www.fb.com/AskTSA), Apple Business Chat or by texting \"Travel\" to AskTSA (275-872). You can also contact the TSA Contact Center at (866) 289-9673 or by filling out an online form..\n\nIf possible, please contact TSA within 72 hours of experiencing problems with your TSA PreCheck benefits to allow TSA the ability to trouble shoot the issue.\n\nI think my TSA PreCheck membership was suspended or revoked, but I'm not sure why, what do I do?\n\nFirst, check that your membership has not expired by looking up your KTN (Known Traveler Number) here. You can also confirm your airline participates in the TSA PreCheck® program, by clicking here.\n\nIf your KTN is still active, confirm with your airline that your KTN, name, and date of birth are accurate.\n\nIf you still do not have a TSA PreCheck® indicator on your boarding pass, or if you have questions concerning your TSA PreCheck® status, we're here to assist you. You can reach out to us through X (Twitter @AskTSA), Facebook Messenger (http://www.fb.com/AskTSA), Apple Business Chat or by texting \"Travel\" to AskTSA (275-872). You can also contact the TSA Contact Center at (866) 289-9673 or fill out an online form. If you received a notice of violation, please contact your case agent.\n\nTSA PreCheck® and Global Entry are both Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler Programs. TSA PreCheck® provides expedited security screening benefits for flights departing from U.S. Airports. Global Entry provides expedited U.S. customs screening for international air travelers when entering the United States. Global Entry members also receive TSA PreCheck® benefits as part of their membership.\n\nBefore you apply, we recommend that you review the various DHS trusted traveler programs, such as the TSA PreCheck® Application Program, Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI, to ensure you meet the eligibility requirements and determine the best program for you. If you travel internationally four or more times a year, consider enrolling in Global Entry. If you take less than four international trips a year, TSA PreCheck is a great choice for domestic travelers. For more information on all of the DHS Trusted Traveler Programs use the DHS interactive Trusted Traveler Tool.\n\nA Known Traveler Number (KTN) is issued to all individuals approved to receive TSA PreCheck® expedited screening. The KTN must be added in the KTN field when booking airline travel reservations to have the TSA PreCheck® indicator appear on your boarding pass.\n\nFor members approved for the TSA PreCheck® Application Program, this number is 9 or 10 digits long, can be a combination of numbers and letters and typically begins with TT for those who enrolled through IDEMIA, TE for those who enrolled through Telos, or AC for those who enrolled through CLEAR all of which are official TSA PreCheck® enrollment providers.\n\nFor members approved for Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI, the KTN is the CBP PASS ID number. This nine-digit number usually begins with 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 50, 70, 80, 95, 98, or 99 and can be found on the back of your NEXUS, SENTRI, or Global Entry card in the upper-left corner or by logging on to the Trusted Traveler Programs website. Your trusted traveler card will not grant you access to TSA PreCheck® lanes, instead you must add your PASS ID number in the KTN field when making airline reservations to ensure the TSA PreCheck® indicator appears on your boarding pass.\n\nFirst, check that your membership has not expired by looking up your KTN (Known Traveler Number) here. You can also confirm your airline participates in the TSA PreCheck® program, by clicking here.\n\nIf your KTN is still active, confirm with your airline that your KTN, name, and date of birth are accurate.\n\nIf you still do not have a TSA PreCheck® indicator on your boarding pass, or if you have questions concerning your TSA PreCheck® status, we're here to assist you.

You can also contact the TSA Contact Center at (866) 289-9673 or fill out an online form. If you received a notice of violation, please contact your case agent.\n\nIf you commit certain violations of federal security regulations, such as assault, threat, intimidation, or interference with flight crew, physical or sexual assault or threat of physical or sexual assault of any individual on an aircraft, interference with security operations, access control violations, providing false or fraudulent documents, making a bomb threat, or bringing a firearm, explosive, or other prohibited item to an airport or onboard an aircraft, you are denied expedited screening for a period of time. The duration of disqualification from participation in TSA PreCheck® is related to the seriousness of the violation and/or a repeated history of regulatory violations. Membership suspension can last up to five years for a first time offense or be permanent for egregious incidents or repeat offenses.\n\nTSA PreCheck® enrollees undergo recurrent criminal history vetting as a condition of their TSA PreCheck® enrollment. If TSA is notified of new criminal records while you are a member of TSA PreCheck®, your eligibility for TSA PreCheck® expedited screening may be temporarily suspended while TSA investigates the new criminal information. This process typically takes less than 30 days, but can take up to 90 days. TSA PreCheck® enrollees found to have committed a disqualifying offense may have their TSA PreCheck® enrollment temporarily suspended or permanently disqualified, depending on the severity of the offense.\n\nIf you are unclear why you are not receiving the TSA PreCheck® indicator on your boarding pass, first check that your membership has not expired by looking up your KTN (Known Traveler Number) here. You can also confirm your airline participates in the TSA PreCheck® program, by clicking here.\n\nIf your KTN is still active, confirm with your airline that your KTN, name, and date of birth are accurate.\n\nIf you still do not have a TSA PreCheck® indicator on your boarding pass, or if you have questions concerning your TSA PreCheck® status, we're here to assist you.

If you received a notice of violation, please contact your case agent.\n\nPlease note: TSA uses unpredictable security measures, both seen and unseen, throughout the airport. All travelers will be screened, and no individual is guaranteed expedited screening.\n\nNo, the majority of applicants will be able to renew completely online with any enrollment provider.\n\nRegardless of which enrollment provider you choose to enroll with, some individuals may need to renew in person, for example, if they have changed their name and have not completed TSA’s name update process. These members may either visit an enrollment center to complete the renewal process or update their name with the enrollment provider with which they would like to renew. Please click here to view enrollment providers' contact information.\n\nName changes may take up to 45 days to complete and processing time varies by individual.\n\nInjured, wounded service members, veterans and wounded warriors may contact TSA Cares to request assistance with the security screening process. TSA Cares is a helpline to assist travelers with disabilities and medical conditions. Call TSA Cares 72 hours prior to traveling with questions about screening policies, procedures and what to expect at the security checkpoint at (855) 787-2227.\n\nWounded Warriors\n\nTSA verifies the status of individuals identifying themselves as a wounded warrior through the appropriate military branch. Following verification, the travel information is provided to the departing/arriving U.S. airports where wounded warriors may experience expedited screening procedures.\n\nVeterans\n\nInjured service members/veterans requesting assistance will have their travel information and type of assistance required provided to the departing/arriving U.S. airports to ensure they receive proper assistance at the security checkpoint. Veterans who are not enrolled in TSA PreCheck™ will be screened in standard screening lanes.\n\nLearn about the security screening procedures for travelers with disabilities and medical conditions.\n\nIndividuals who commit certain violations of Federal security-related regulations, such as interference with security operations, assault, threat, intimidation, or interference with flight crew, physical or sexual assault or threat of physical or sexual assault of any individual on an aircraft, access control violations, providing false or fraudulent documents, making a bomb threat, or bring a firearm, explosive, or other prohibited items to an airport or on board an aircraft are denied expedited screening for a period of time. The duration of disqualification for expedited screening will depend upon the seriousness of the offense and/or a repeated history of regulatory violations.\n\nThe notice of violation process and the TSA PreCheck® disqualification process are separate processes and are handled by different offices. Individuals with questions concerning their TSA PreCheck® status should contact us through X (Twitter @AskTSA), Facebook Messenger (http://www.fb.com/AskTSA), Apple Business Chat or by texting \"Travel\" to AskTSA (275-872). You can also contact the TSA Contact Center at (866) 289-9673 or fill out an online form. Individuals with questions concerning their notice should contact their case agent in the Special Enforcement Program Office. Your case agent will not be able to assist you with questions concerning your TSA PreCheck® status, and both AskTSA and TCC will not be able to help you with questions concerning your notice of violation. Learn more about TSA PreCheck®\n\nThe quickest way to contact the Special Enforcement Program Office is to email to NOV.APO@tsa.dhs.gov and include your full name, TSA case number and case agent’s name (found in the Notice of Violation), and your telephone number.\n\nYou may also contact the Special Enforcement Program Office at (571) 227-3994. Be prepared to leave a message providing your name, phone number, the case number and correct spelling of the individual who is listed on the notice of violation, and your case agent’s name. Your message will be directed to your case agent for a return call. It is TSA's goal to return all calls within 72 hours; however, in the event of a delay, the date of your message will be taken into consideration.\n\nYou may respond to the Notice of Violation by choosing one of the five options listed in the options sheet that is attached to your notice. Instructions for submitting your response are contained in the options sheet.\n\nAll communications with TSA in regard to a specific Notice of Violation must be made in writing with an appropriate options sheet selection by emailing NOV.APO@tsa.dhs.gov. Please include your full name, TSA case number and case agent’s name (found in the Notice of Violation), and your contact information (i.e., telephone numbers, mailing address, and email address) in your email.\n\nYou may also respond by mail to:\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\nSpecial Enforcement Program Office\n\n6595 Springfield Center Drive\n\nSpringfield, VA 20598-6801\n\nYour response is due within 30 days of your receipt of the NOV.\n\nTSA cannot process a request for “all records” on an individual or for “all communications” between TSA and a third party. You should include a date limitation, a particular topic, and if asking for correspondence, the relevant parties’ names and offices or airports, if known. You can contact the TSA FOIA Branch for assistance in writing a FOIA request. This will ensure we understand which materials you are seeking and help us respond to your request quickly.\n\nGiven the variety of programs at TSA and the multiple ways you might have a connection with TSA, we require this additional information about records you are seeking. As TSA operates at over 450 airports and screens on average more than 1.9 million passengers a day, it would be unduly burdensome to conduct a search at over 450 airports and TSA program offices using limited information. Please narrow or otherwise clarify your request by providing specific criteria regarding the records that you are seeking (e.g., time period, airport or other association with TSA, including employment) so that TSA can conduct a reasonable search.\n\nCurrent TSA employees should access their records through the electronic OPF from a government computer. Access from non-government computers will be denied. Please work with your local management to request access to a government computer for your eOPF request.\n\nIn addition, you may request assistance from your facility’s Human Resource/Administrative Office. For additional information, please visit the Office of Personnel Management website.\n\nFormer federal civilian employees (the person of record) may obtain copies of most civilian and personnel medical records on file at the National Personnel Records Center, including copies of the Standard Form 50 (Personnel Action) via written request. Different release procedures apply for archival civilian personnel records. Please note, OPFs are retired to the center within 120 days after separation from federal employment. If less than 120 days have elapsed since separation, write to the last employing federal office.\n\nFederal law 5 USC 552a(b) requires that all requests for personnel records and information be submitted in writing. Each request must be signed in cursive and dated within the last year. Please identify the documents or information needed and explain the purpose of your request.\n\nCertain basic information needed to locate civilian personnel records includes the full name used during federal employment, date of birth, Social Security Number, name and location of employing federal agency, and beginning and ending dates of federal service.\n\nWritten requests must be signed and dated. Mail or fax to:\n\nNational Personnel Records Center, Annex\n\n1411 Boulder Boulevard\n\nValmeyer, IL 62295\n\nFax: 618-935-3014\n\nTSA processes requests on a first-come, first-served basis according to two tracks: simple and complex. The first response you receive is TSA’s acknowledgment of your request submission. TSA typically acknowledges requests within 10 days of receipt. The acknowledgment letter provides tracking numbers and informs a requester about whether additional information will be needed to process the request. The letter also provides instructions for checking the status of the request.\n\nIf you have not received an acknowledgment from TSA regarding your request within 10 days, you may contact us at 866-364-2872 or email at foia@tsa.dhs.gov to ensure we received your request. Most Internet providers impose a 25-megabyte limit on files sent through email servers. If your request includes attachments that exceed that limit, it may have been blocked.\n\nHow long it takes to receive materials from TSA depends on several factors. Our processing time will be determined by the nature of your request, including complexity, scope, and other factors. Requests are deemed complex for reasons that include, but are not limited to, those that require search within multiple offices or airport(s), consultation with multiple DHS components or other agencies, or review of voluminous records from multiple locations. Additionally, the size of TSA’s backlog can affect processing times.\n\nTSA is diligently working through a backlog to more efficiently process all requests.\n\nYou may request any information that constitutes an existing TSA record in any format, including an electronic format. Examples of records that may be requested include documents, photographs, videos, sound recordings, drawings, computerized records, electronic mail, and agency policies and procedures.\n\nTSA will conduct a search for records already in existence at the time of the request. Please note the FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, complete questionnaires, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.\n\nIf you request video recordings from airports, please note that the TSA is not the primary custodian of those records. TSA is unlikely to have airport videos unless we obtained them as a result of an alleged checkpoint incident or security breach. Therefore, we recommend that you request video recordings from the local airport authority. Also, be aware that airport authorities generally delete recordings after 30 days.\n\nIn order for TSA to provide you with exactly what you need, please include in your request details that will help us conduct a robust but targeted search. These details include date, title or name, author, recipient, names of offices, agencies and organizations, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, and reference number. For requests regarding airport checkpoint experiences, include the name/location of airport, date and time of travel, checkpoint lane and any other details. For more information, please visit the FOIA requests page.\n\nIf a request does not provide sufficient descriptive information, we may not be able to identify the records sought. We may ask you for additional information (e.g., specific subject matter, topic, personnel, etc.) if we are unable to process your request. If we cannot contact you or you do not respond within 30 calendar days to our requests for clarification, we will close your request.\n\nThe FOIA request form also requires the following information:\n\nYour full name (for a Privacy Act Request), address, telephone number, and, if available, email.\n\nIndication of whether the request is a FOIA and/or a Privacy Act request (if known).\n\nSpecific information about the records sought as described above.\n\nDelivery information for the responsive records, e.g., electronically or via mail.\n\nA statement regarding your willingness to pay applicable fees, including any limitations.\n\nSection 1978 of the TSA Modernization Act passed in October 2018 allows states to issue a Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) on a state-issued commercial driver’s license (CDL) to a driver who holds a valid Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC®). This provision allows states to utilize the existing TWIC to verify the completion of the TSA security threat assessment. TSA has approved an exemption from certain portions of the current regulations. This exemption relieves states from requiring an additional HME application from individuals, and relieves them from having to submit certain information and fees to receive a state issued HME if they hold a valid TWIC.
