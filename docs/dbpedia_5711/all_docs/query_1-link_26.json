        "text": "Camera movement definition\n\nDifferent types of camera movement\n\nBefore we take a look at the complete list of the different types of camera movements in film, let’s first take a look at the camera movement definition. This will help us better understand the best camera movements and why filmmakers use them.\n\nCAMERA MOVEMENT DEFINITION\n\nWhat is camera movement?\n\nCamera movement is a filmmaking technique that causes a change in frame or perspective through the movement of the camera. Camera movement allows cinematographers and directors to shift the audience's view without cutting. Specific types of camera movements in film also can create a psychological and emotional effect on the audience. These effects can be used to make a film more immersive and engaging.\n\nExamples of types of camera movements in film:\n\nPan\n\nTilt\n\nPush in\n\nPull Out\n\nWhen it comes time to create a shot list for your next project, which camera movements will you choose? There are many types of camera movements in film, each with their own storytelling value.\n\nFor future reference, follow the image link below to download a PDF of our custom shot list with each type of camera movement. Can you guess which movies these images are from? Follow the link for the answers.\n\nUltimate Guide to Camera Movements • See Entire Storyboard\n\nCamera movement terms\n\nStatic\n\nThe first on our list of the types of camera movements in film is the static shot. A static shot has no camera movement at all. It is achieved by locking a camera to a fixed-position typically with a tripod. The stability of a static shot makes it non-distracting. This makes it one of the best camera movements for shot-reverse-shot dialogue, precise composition, or showcasing an actors’ performance.\n\nA key distinction to Martin Scorsese’s directing style is allowing room for improvisation from his actors. Static shots with multiple cameras are perfect for capturing these moments. Check out this video comparison by Screenplayed that compares the final cut and screenplay of this Wolf of Wall Street scene. Note how much improvisation is included.\n\nWolf of Wall Street • Stationary camera movement\n\nTo capture these moments where anything can happen, a static shot allows actors to work the scene together and produce something authentic. As great as static shots can be, deliberate and motivated camera movements can be incredibly effective storytelling devices.\n\nLearn more about the static shot →\n\nPan camera movement\n\nPan\n\nThe camera pan directs a camera horizontally left or right. The pan camera movement is typically achieved with a tripod head, but can also be done handheld or with a stabilizer.\n\nPans are often motivated by a character’s actions. They can also be used to reveal new information to the audience.\n\nWhen done quickly with speed, the fast camera movement is known as a whip pan. Whip pans are one of the best camera movements to add energy to a shot. Whip pans can be used between two characters rather than cutting to establish a more energetic connection.\n\nWe analyzed the whip pans of La La Land in this video essay to see how they effectively energize the relationship between Sebastian and Mia.\n\nArt of the Whip Pan Shot • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nAlthough the pan is one of the most basic camera movements, it can also be one of the most effective. Creative uses like whip pans can be found in the distinct styles of directors such as Wes Anderson’s filmmaking.\n\nLearn more about the whip pan →\n\nLearn more about the camera pan →\n\nTilt camera movement\n\nTilt\n\nCamera tilts are just like pans, only vertical. Tilt camera movements direct a camera upward or downward. Camera tilts can be used to give a character dominance in a shot or to reveal new information to the audience. Tilts enable filmmakers to capture the verticality of a film in moments of awe and spectacle.\n\nSteven Spielberg’s style uses the tilt often. In one of Spielberg’s best movies, Jurassic Park, he uses the tilt when first introducing the dinosaurs. The camera tilt perfectly captures the emotions of the film’s characters while eliciting awe in the audience.\n\nWelcome to Jurassic Park • Tilt Camera Movement\n\nSpielberg is known for his dynamic camera movement. This scene is a perfect example of how a tilt up camera movement can have an emotional response. Sir Steven is also known for the Spielberg oner — his uncanny ability to use different types of camera movements to shoot complete scenes in one shot.\n\nHow Spielberg Directs Long Takes • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nSpielberg’s intentional camera movement can be found throughout some of his best work.\n\nLearn more about the tilt shot →\n\nDolly camera movement\n\nPush In\n\nA push-in moves the camera closer to a subject typically with a dolly camera movement or Steadicam. Push-ins can draw the audience's attention toward a specific detail. Filmmakers also push-in toward characters to try and infer what is occurring internally. This can be a reaction, thought process, or internal conflict.\n\nCheck out the analysis of this push-in shot from The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Cinefix compares the use of the push-in with a dolly camera movement to a static shot to show its impact on the scene.\n\nCinefix • Dolly Camera Movement\n\nConsider this scene from The Godfather. As Sonny and Tom spar over how to handle the family business after Don Corleone's assassination attempt, the camera barely moves.\n\nThat is, until the moment Michael decides to step up and take control. The static camera leading up to that moment allows for even the slightest push in to Michael seem like a grand and powerful moment. Here's a breakdown of the scene and how Coppola uses camera movement with masterful purpose and precision.\n\nPush In Example • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nSubtle push-ins like these can have an enormous impact on how we perceive characters. They can be the missing component that connects an audience to a character and what they are thinking.\n\nCamera movement terms\n\nPull Out\n\nThe camera pull out is the exact opposite of the push in. A pull out is a smooth camera movement that moves the camera further away from a subject. This movement causes the subject to grow smaller while simultaneously revealing their surroundings.\n\nPull outs can be used to reveal setting and characters. Emotionally, pull outs can highlight a character’s isolation or loneliness. Stanley Kubrick uses this to detach us from Jack in this scene from The Shining.\n\nThe Shining • cool camera movements\n\nAs Jack descends into madness in the film, the pull out allows Kubrick to distance us from Jack, just as Wendy does. Kubrick demonstrates how to use the pull out to both reveal information and entice emotion.\n\nCamera movements zoom\n\nZoom\n\nAlthough zooms are technically not a camera movement they do create movement within the image. Zooms change the focal length of a camera lens to either zoom in (magnify) or zoom out (de-magnify) the size of a subject in the frame.\n\nZooms are unique because there is no equivalent to it in the experience of the human eye. Zooms can feel artificial or even unnatural. For these reasons, zooms are one of the best camera movements to use in horrors and thrillers.\n\nThe zoom is commonly found in Stanley Kubrick’s directing style. By using it on specific characters, Kubrick makes us feel uneasy by them as they descend into madness like in this shot from Full Metal Jacket.\n\nFull Metal Jacket zoom\n\nWhen watching Kubrick’s best films, keep an eye out for zoom shots. Although zooms may not be as prevalent in modern cinema, they can still be effective storytelling devices when used with intention. And the best way to understand the intention behind a shot is to study masters like Kubrick.\n\nLearn more about the zoom shot →\n\nTypes of camera movements in film\n\nDolly Zoom\n\nOne of the more heavy-handed camera movements is the dolly zoom. A dolly zoom is achieved by dollying the camera away from or toward a subject while simultaneously zooming in the other direction. Dolly zooms are an incredibly intentional camera movement because they have such a specific effect.\n\nThe visual effect of a dolly zoom that is distinctive. In the fantasy and horror genre, it is used to portray a supernatural force. We break down an example of this from Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in this video essay.\n\nDolly Zoom • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nFilmmakers have used the dolly zoom to visually portray other conflicts as well. It is commonly used to capture the internal conflict of a character. The dolly zoom can also be used in a positive way. By making the background larger while maintaining foreground size, the dolly zoom can also establish a relationship between two characters.\n\nLearn more about the dolly zoom →\n\nRoll camera movement\n\nRoll\n\nThe camera roll is a rotational camera movement that rotates the camera over its side on its long axis. Rolls can be dizzying and unnatural. For this reason, filmmakers use it to disorient the audience or create uneasiness. It’s specific effect makes it a very intentional camera movement that should only be used when wanting to elicit a discomfort in the audience.\n\nSometimes these effects tie in to a film’s theme, such as in this scene from one of the best Marvel movies, Black Panther. When Killmonger takes the throne, the sense of uneasiness in Wakanda is echoed to the audience through a slow camera roll.\n\nDizzying types of camera movement shots • Black Panther\n\nImagine if this scene had been shot with just a push in and no camera roll. The instability of Wakanda and the apprehension of the film’s characters would be felt less by the audience.\n\nTracking camera movement\n\nTracking shot\n\nA tracking shot is any shot that physically moves the camera through the scene for an extended amount of time. Tracking camera movement often follows a traveling subject, though they can be used to simply show off the scene. Check out our breakdown of the best tips to shooting better tracking shots.\n\nTracking Camera Shot Movements • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTruck camera movement is a type of tracking shot that moves laterally left or right. Truck camera movement has historically been achieved with a dolly tracking camera movement. Modern Steadicams have allow complex shot movements that move the camera in all directions.\n\nSteadicam camera movement has become more prevalent in modern films. Here's a breakdown of the camera, lenses, and camera movements Roger Deakins used to make 1917 look like a single tracking shot.\n\nHow Deakins Shot 1917 • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTracking shots can be found in nearly every modern film. Analyzing how your favorite filmmakers use tracking shots will help you become a better filmmaker.\n\nLearn more about tracking shots →\n\nCamera movement terms\n\nArc shot\n\nThe arc shot orbits the camera around a subject in an arc pattern. Arc shots are typically used to add energy to a shot in which characters have minimal actions. Christopher Nolan uses the arc shot in The Dark Knight to add to the menacing energy of the Joker.\n\nThe Dark Knight • Cool Camera Movements\n\nImagine if the shot was captured statically on a tripod. Sure Heath Ledger’s performance would still make it engaging. However, the arc shot movements create uneasiness in the audience immediately just as Rachel feels. The result is an uneasy, yet incredible Joker finale in one of Christopher Nolan’s best films.\n\nEstablishing Shots Types of Camera Movement Shots • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nWhat is handheld camera movement?\n\nRandom Movement\n\nSometimes, camera movements are not motivated by character actions, but rather audience experience. Filmmakers often add random movement to a shot via camera shake through a handheld shot to heighten the intensity of a scene.\n\nWhen used more subtly, the random movement can establish subjectivity for the audience. This is often used in films that are based on true events. In combination with arbitrary zooms, the random movement in The Big Short stylistically gives a subjective, documentary feel to the film.\n\nThe Big Short (2015) • Handheld Types of Camera Movement\n\nRandom movement can be over used, so be sure to use it with intention and restraint if necessary. Too much of it and the random movement will be ineffective. Too little and it will go unnoticed. The random movement should always serve the story.\n\nLearn more about the handheld shot →\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTypes of Camera Rigs and Gear\n\nOnce you decide what types of camera movements in film you want to use in your project, it is important to determine what equipment to use to achieve it. There are various types of camera rigs and gear that can accomplish nearly every camera movement. Understanding the function of each will help you get a better grasp of the cinematic tools at your disposal.\n\nUp Next: Types of Camera Rigs and Gear →"
