        "text": "The U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) is an administrative court. Improper ex parte communication with the Office of Administrative Law Judges is prohibited by statute and regulation. If you make an improper ex parte communication with this office, including messages sent by email, we are required to put that communication on the public record. See 5 U.S.C. 557(d)(1)(C); 29 C.F.R. ยง 18.14.\n\nOALJ is an administrative court, and cannot and will not provide legal advice. Rather, questions about the interpretation of labor laws or where to file a complaint should be directed to the agency having administrative responsibility and expertise over the subject matter. For assistance in finding the right agency to which to direct questions, try the general contact page at the main DOL website, or telephone the United States Department of Labor National Call Center, which provides nationwide toll-free assistance to DOL customers with questions about job loss, business closures, pay and leave, workplace safety and health, pension and health benefits, and workplace injuries. In addition to answering general information, the Call Center will relay any specific inquiry to the proper office. The National Toll Free Number is 1-866-4-USA-DOL or 1-866-487-2365. The TTY number is: 1-877-889-5627. Live assistance is available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nSee also the OALJ FAQ \"I have an employment-related question; can you help me?\" and the OALJ FAQ \"What are the rules governing contact of OALJ?\"."
