        "text": "Updated February 2021 with infographic linked above\n\nHealthcare acquired infections (HAIs) are the result of a sequence of events that take place between an infectious agent (or pathogen), a host and an environment – in a process that is referred to as the ‘chain of infection’.\n\nUnderstanding how infections become established in healthcare settings is crucial for effective infection prevention and control.\n\nIn this blog post we explore the six key links in the chain of infection, together with the actions that can be taken to disrupt the chain.\n\nThe 6 links in the chain of infection\n\n1. The pathogen\n\nThe first link in the chain of infection is the infectious agent or pathogen which can take the form of:\n\nViruses – such as Influenza A, shingles and Hepatitis\n\nBacteria – including Lyme disease and Leptospirosis\n\nFungi – for example Candidiasis and Aspergillosis\n\nParasitic protozoan diseases – such as Malaria, Giardia and Toxoplasmosis\n\nPrions – which are the cause of rare progressive neurodegenrative disorders such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)\n\nHow well any pathogen is able to thrive depends on three factors:\n\nIts pathogenicity – its ability to produce disease\n\nIts degree of virulence – its severity or harmfulness\n\nIts invasiveness – its tendency to spread\n\n2. The reservoir\n\nA reservoir is the principal habitat in which a pathogen lives, flourishes and is able to multiply.\n\nCommon reservoirs for infectious agents include humans, animals or insects and the environment.\n\nHuman reservoirs\n\nIn humans, there are two forms of reservoir: acute clinical cases (in which someone is infected and is displaying signs and symptoms of the disease); and carriers (where someone has been colonised with an infectious agent but is not unwell.\n\nAcute clinical cases are more likely to be diagnosed and treated which means that the patient’s contacts and normal activities will normally be restricted. Carriers, however, can present more of a risk to those around them because they do not display any signs or symptoms of illness.\n\nCarriers can be further subdivided into four main types:\n\nIncubatory carriers – people who are infectious even before their own symptoms start\n\nInapparent carriers – in which an individual is able to transmit an infection to others, without ever developing the infection themselves\n\nConvalasecent carriers – people who are in the recovery phase of their illness but who continue to be infectious\n\nChronic carriers – anyone who has recovered but who continues to be a carrier for infection.\n\nAnimal & insect reservoirs\n\nExamples of animal or insect reservoirs include Lyme disease (which is transmitted via ticks); Rabies (which is transmitted by dogs, cats, foxes and bats); and Salmonella (which is transmitted by poultry, cattle, sheep and pigs).\n\nAny infectious disease that is transmitted under natural conditions from animal to human is referred to as zoonosis.\n\nEnvironmental reservoirs\n\nThe environment contains a large number of reservoirs of infection, including soil (which acts as a reservoir for Clostridium tetani, the causative agent of tetanus) and water (which is a reservoir for Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaire’s disease).\n\n3. The portal of exit\n\nThe portal of exit is any route which enables a pathogen to leave the reservoir or host. In humans the key portals of exit are:\n\nAlimentary – via vomiting, diarrhoea or biting\n\nGenitourinary – via sexual transmission\n\nRespiratory – through coughing, sneezing and talking\n\nSkin – via skin lesions\n\nTrans-placental – where transmission is from mother to foetus\n\n4. The mode of transmission\n\nThe two main ways that an infection can be transmitted from its reservoir to a susceptible host are via direct transmission or indirect transmission.\n\nDirect transmission tends to be instantaneous and occurs when there is direct contact with the infectious agent. Examples include tetanus, glandular fever, respiratory diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nIndirect transmission can occur through animate mechanisms such as fleas, ticks, flies or mosquitoes or via inanimate mechanisms such as food, water, biological products or surgical instruments.\n\nIndirect transmission can also be airborne, in which tiny particles of an infectious agent are carried by dust or droplets in the air and inhaled into the lungs.\n\n5. The portal of entry\n\nThe portal of entry is the means by which an infection is able to enter a susceptible host.\n\nPortals of entry into the human body include:\n\nInhalation (via the respiratory tract)\n\nAbsorption (via mucous membranes such as the eyes)\n\nIngestion (via the gastrointestinal tract)\n\nInoculation (as the result of an inoculation injury)\n\nIntroduction (via the insertion of medical devices)\n\n6. The susceptible host\n\nThe last link in the chain of infection is the susceptible host.\n\nHow susceptible any host will be, depends on a variety of factors:\n\nTheir age – and in particular if they are very young or very old\n\nWhether there is any presence of malnutrition or dehydration\n\nWhether there is any underlying chronic disease\n\nIf the host suffers from immobility\n\nIf they are taking any medication which could disrupt or suppress their immune response\n\nGeneral resistance factors (such as mucous membranes, skin, cough reflex etc) that can help defend against infection\n\nHow can we break the chain of infection?\n\nThe healthcare environment can expose patients to infection risks that they may not encounter elsewhere.\n\nUnderstanding how infections become established, and how they are transmitted, is essential for effective infection prevention and control."
