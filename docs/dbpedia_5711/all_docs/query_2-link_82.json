        "text": "Airborne diseases pass from one person to another when microorganisms travel through the air. Chickenpox, the common cold, and COVID-19 are examples of airborne diseases.\n\nAirborne diseases can transmit through coughs or sneezes, spraying liquid, or dust. The microorganisms may come from a person or animal who has a disease or from soil, garbage, or other sources.\n\nThere are many types of airborne diseases, and the symptoms, treatment, and outlook will vary according to the disease.\n\nWays of preventing transmission include the use of personal protective equipment and effective ventilation systems. Depending on the disease, an individual can help prevent transmission by avoiding close contact with others or wearing a face covering.\n\nIn this article, learn more about airborne diseases and how to prevent them.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), airborne diseases can spread through a direct or an indirect form of transmission, depending on the germ involved.\n\nThe pathogens may enter the air in wet droplets, for example, when someone breathes or sneezes. There, they will be suspended in the air, and some droplets dry out, leaving microscopic particles. While suspended in the air, these particles can attach to or enter the body systems of people nearby.\n\nSome particles, such as the fungus Aspergillus, are widely present in the environment. It occurs in soil, plants, including decomposing plant matter, household dust, and building materials, as well as food and water. During building renovations, breathing in dust that contains the fungus may cause disease in some people.\n\nAnthrax, too, is present in the soil in many places around the world. When dust forms from that soil, a person can become sick if they breathe in anthrax spores.\n\nHere are some characteristics that droplet residuals may have, according to the CDC:\n\nThey contain microorganisms that could be active.\n\nThey may have a protective coat of dry secretions, such as mucus or saliva.\n\nThey may stay in the air indefinitely.\n\nThey may carry over long distances.\n\nAir currents can disperse the microorganisms, but how far they travel depends partly on the environment. The further the droplets travel from the source, the lower the risk of infection, due to environmental factors.\n\nDepending on the pathogens, factors that affect how long they remain active include:\n\nair temperature\n\nhumidity\n\nexposure to sunlight or other forms of radiation\n\nthe weight of the particles, which can affect how long they take to settle\n\nthe structure and stability of the pathogen\n\nIt is not always possible to prevent the spread of airborne diseases, but individuals and authorities can take measures to reduce the risk by recommending or ensuring adequate ventilation and the use of protective equipment.\n\nDepending on the type of organism, the degree of exposure, and individual factors, airborne particles may cause illness to develop if exposure occurs.\n\nMany diseases can arise after exposure to airborne particles, including:\n\nthe common cold, which can develop from a rhinovirus\n\nchickenpox, caused by the Varicella zoster virus\n\nmumps, caused by a paramyxovirus\n\nmeasles, caused by another paramyxovirus\n\nwhooping cough, a bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis\n\nCOVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus\n\naspergillosis, caused by the Aspergillus fungus\n\ntuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\nanthrax, a bacterial infection resulting from contact with Bacillus anthracis spores\n\ndiphtheria, a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae\n\nmeningitis, which can result from exposure to certain bacterial, viral, or fungal particles\n\nSome experts believe influenza transmits through the air, but not all scientists agree.\n\nMeasures taken by hospitals and individuals can help prevent the spread of airborne infectious diseases.\n\nTips for individuals include:\n\nstaying away from other people when symptoms are present or after receiving a diagnosis of an infectious disease\n\nwearing a face mask in public places\n\nkeeping rooms properly ventilated\n\nregularly cleaning and servicing ventilation systems\n\ncovering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing\n\nHospitals and other healthcare centers follow strict guidelines regarding ventilation methods and other measures to protect people from particles that cause airborne diseases and other health problems.\n\nExperts believe that some diseases can spread through more than one route. For example, if microorganisms enter the environment when a person coughs, they may stay in the air or land on surfaces. These surfaces become fomites, which is a term for an object likely to carry an infection. If another person touches a fomite and then touches their mouth, they may then develop symptoms of the disease. Influenza is one example where this might happen, research suggests.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, people should follow local guidelines about testing, isolation, and wearing face coverings. Here, learn more about how to help stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe symptoms of an airborne disease will vary widely, depending on the type of disease. Here are some examples of the main symptoms and treatment approaches for some of these diseases:\n\nDiseaseType of pathogenSymptomsTreatmentCOVID-19virusfever, a cough, loss of the sense of taste and smell, breathing difficulties, body aches, headache, and moresymptom relief; antivirals may helpMeaslesvirusrash, fever, nasal congestion, cough, pink eye, and moresymptom reliefAspergillosisfungusdifficulty breathing, increased sputum production, chills, headache, joint pain, and moreantifungal medicationTBbacteriumpersistent cough, weight loss, fever and chills, blood in sputum, and morea combination of antibiotics\n\nThe outlook will vary widely depending on a personâ€™s diagnosis. Some airborne diseases, such as the common cold, produce minor symptoms in most people and usually resolve within a few days. Others, such as COVID-19, can be life-threatening or involve long-term complications.\n\nAntibiotics can help manage a bacterial infection, and antifungal medications may help resolve infections due to fungi. Antivirals can help slow the activity of a virus in some cases, but there is currently no cure for a virus. However, vaccines can prevent many viruses from causing severe illness.\n\nWhile antibiotics have improved the outlook for many bacterial infections, some diseases, such as TB, are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment, making them harder to treat.\n\nThe best approach is to take measures to prevent and avoid infection."
