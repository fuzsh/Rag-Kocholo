        "text": "The Open Topic is the front door to working with the Department of the Air Force. The Open Topic operates in a Phase I, followed by a Phase II and Direct to Phase II approach. Commercial industry submits their technology solutions in the proposal process and defines how they think their solution will benefit the warfighter. The Air Force then evaluates the proposal to determine if the project is something they would like to conduct a feasibility study on.\n\nPhase I\n\nThe feasibility study is conducted during Phase I with a 3-month period of performance where the small business works to identify their Air Force end user (warfighter) and customer (program office) with the goal of getting that Air Force end user and customer to sign a Customer Memorandum verbalizing their intent to work with the small business on transitioning their technology to warfighters. Once the Customer Memorandum, a requirement for submitting for a Phase II proposal, is in hand, small businesses will compete to proceed to prototyping their solution.\n\nPeriod of Performance: 3 months\n\nA maximum award of $75K (SBIR) and $110K (STTR)\n\nOn contract to conduct Technical Feasibility\n\nTwo deliverables (preliminary & final reports)\n\nPrepare for Phase II application\n\nWork to get a DAF Customer & End User to sign a Customer Memorandum for Phase II proposal\n\nPhase II\n\nThe Phase II, or prototyping phase, sees the small business work directly with an Air Force Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) to conduct further R&D to build and adapt their dual-use proposed solution to fit Air Force needs. If a small business already has a solution that is ready for prototype and adaptation to Air Force needs, has identified an Air Force end user and customer, and has a signed Customer Memorandum in hand, they are able to skip the initial Phase I process and apply to a Direct to Phase II (D2P2) solicitation.\n\nTraditional\n\nPeriod of Performance: Up to 21-months\n\nA maximum award of $1.25M (SBIR) and $1.8M (STTR)\n\nMilestone Deliverables in accordance with Proposal Milestone Schedule\n\nWork with the DAF Customer & End User who signed the Customer Memorandum\n\nDirect to Phase II (D2P2)\n\nPeriod of Performance: Up to 21-months\n\nA maximum award of $1.25M (SBIR)\n\nMilestone Deliverables in accordance with Proposal Milestone Schedule\n\nWork with the DAF Customer & End User who signed the Customer Memorandum AND must demonstrate technical merit"
