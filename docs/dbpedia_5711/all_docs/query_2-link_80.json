Students will also spend up to four months in Alberta during the programme.\n\nThe School of Medicine at St Andrews offers an integrated curriculum within a strong clinical context. In addition to exploring the foundations of medical science, this course will help you develop a professional attitude, ethical understanding and decision-making skills required by the General Medical Council (GMC) and detailed in their ‘Outcomes for Graduates’ and ‘Promoting Excellence’.\n\nThe curriculum addresses the following core principles:\n\nCompetence – understanding of the scientific basis of medicine and an extensive anatomical and physiological understanding of the human body.\n\nProfessionalism – development of clinical skills, personal values, interpersonal skills and ethical awareness.\n\nReflection – monitoring self-awareness and decision-making through the completion of a portfolio.\n\nIndependence – encouragement of self-directed learning and an ability to cope with uncertainty.\n\nClinical teaching is integrated with basic science learning throughout the course, teaching you to apply medical sciences to clinical problems.\n\nClinical skills teaching, including communication skills, takes place in simulated wards and other dedicated teaching spaces, supported by video technology. Clinical experience is also offered in the form of clinical placements with patient contact from first year onwards. Professionalism and patient safety are key components of the entire course.\n\nModules\n\nTo graduate with the BSc (Hons) Medicine after Year 3, you must take seven compulsory modules across three years.\n\nMore information about the Medicine modules currently on offer can be found in the module catalogue.\n\nFirst year\n\nSecond year\n\nThird year\n\nIn the first year of the course, the modules emphasise the interrelationships between the pre-clinical sciences. Additionally, you will be introduced to key themes which run throughout the whole programme (for example, ethics, public health, health psychology).\n\nFoundations of Medicine 1: provides a general overview of the structure and functions of the body systems from the microscopic to the macroscopic level. It includes strands of microbiology, public health and health psychology. This module:\n\nreviews fundamental aspects of molecular and cellular medicine\n\nintroduces medical ethics and communication skills relevant to medicine\n\nuses clinical problems to develop an understanding of the levels of consciousness and the assessment of health status\n\nincludes an anatomical overview of the major body systems and the dissection of the back\n\nprovides opportunities to speak to patients with chronic health problems in the Medical School environment.\n\nFoundations of Medicine 2: continues the introduction of fundamental topics, including the principles of disease mechanisms and therapy, and the development of communication skills. This module:\n\nprovides an in-depth study of the musculo-skeletal system, including nerve and muscle physiology (you will study the anatomy of the upper and lower limbs through dissection and lecture)\n\ndevelops an understanding of the principles of disease mechanisms and therapy\n\nintroduces particular topics in behavioural sciences (for example, stress, coping and pain)\n\nintroduces concepts of pharmacokinetics and pharmacy\n\nreviews genetics and the effects of genes on development and disease\n\nincludes a community-based clinical placement\n\nprovides further opportunities for exposure to clinical problems relevant to the teaching.\n\nThe Honours programme, which runs through both second and third year, focuses in detail upon the normal function and dysfunction of specific physiological systems.\n\nThe two modules in second year take an integrated approach to the scientific basis of medicine in Honours. They build upon the material delivered in first year and introduce new concepts.\n\nMedicine Honours 1: covers the structure and functions of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.\n\nMedicine Honours 2: covers the renal, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems.\n\nBoth second year modules:\n\nintroduce and build on normal form and function to explore disease mechanisms and therapy of disorders pertinent to the body systems covered.\n\nexplore the body systems through cadaveric dissection, including the integration with clinical imaging.\n\nuse relevant clinical problems and clinical skills to provide a clinical context to your studies.\n\nintegrate the ethical, moral and behavioural aspects relevant to body systems.\n\nprovide a series of community placements in primary health care settings.\n\nIn third year, the first semester focuses on complex integrative physiological systems (central nervous system and endocrine organs). Semester 2 comprises of two modules, one focusing on a significant student-selected research project, and the other focusing on applying medicine and developing clinical skills.\n\nMedicine Honours 3: revisits foundation knowledge and progresses to more complex systems. This module:\n\nprovides in-depth coverage of normal structure and function of the central nervous system and endocrine systems.\n\nintroduces diseases and possible therapies pertinent to these important control systems.\n\npresents case studies associated with the central nervous system and endocrine systems to highlight appropriate clinical skills for the identification of neurological and endocrinological disorders.\n\nutilises cadaveric dissection, including covering aspects of radiology.\n\nintegrates ethical issues and behavioural science with clinical medicine.\n\nprovides hospital (secondary care) clinical placements.\n\nMedicine Honours 4 (Student-selected component): you will undertake a research project in an area of interest at an advanced level. Research projects will provide the opportunity to:\n\ndevelop critical appraisal skills\n\ndevelop an understanding of scientific methods\n\ngain competency in using literature searching methods\n\ndevelop an inquisitive and questioning attitude and ability to apply rational thought processes\n\nprepare a scientific research dissertation demonstrating critical thinking and analysis\n\ngive an oral presentation on the research findings\n\ndevelop reflective practice using a portfolio entry for a significant learning event.\n\nMedicine Honours 5 (Clinical Reasoning): consolidates knowledge gained throughout the course and introduces new advanced skills to stimulate clinical development. This course is taught primarily by clinicians (including Honorary staff), and case studies will be used extensively to direct student learning. This module:\n\nreviews clinical anatomy in preparation for later clinical training\n\nprovides the opportunity to significantly advance clinical consultation skills, including examination and communication\n\nprovides an opportunity for multi-disciplinary team working through a ward-simulation scenario involving other health professionals\n\ndevelops the ability to consider differential diagnoses effectively and practice enhanced clinical reasoning.\n\nThe modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject.\n\nTeaching\n\nTeaching format\n\nAssessment\n\nSupport\n\nModules are taught through a combination of:\n\nlectures\n\nlaboratory-based practicals\n\nsmall group tutorials\n\nclinical placements\n\naudio-visual capture system for training and feedback on clinical skills\n\ncomputer-based resources\n\nresearch projects.\n\nIn third year, students participate in a ward simulation exercise in the School of Medicine’s clinical skills suite. As an interprofessional learning activity, this provides students with the opportunity to explore the skills required to work as part of a team and to develop their understanding of some of the roles and responsibilities of the healthcare team within a hospital ward environment.\n\nFirst, second and third year level modules are assessed by:\n\nwritten examinations (multiple choice and short written answers)\n\nanatomy practical examinations\n\nobserved structured clinical examinations.\n\nIn third year, students will also complete a dissertation in an area of interest.\n\nStudents must pass all of their modules each year in order to progress to the subsequent year. The award of BSc (Hons) Medicine degree requires students to possess a comprehensive knowledge of basic medical science and its clinical application.\n\nTo progress to the University of Edinburgh's Medical School to complete your MBChB, you must achieve the award of BSc (Hons) Medicine from the University of St Andrews.\n\nUndergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the policy on entry to Honours and in the relevant programme requirements.\n\nTo find out the classification equivalent of points, please see the common reporting scale.\n\nThe University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the students with disabilities web page.\n\nFees\n\n£36,990\n\nGuidance and legislation may change in future years.\n\nFind out more information about tuition fees at Edinburgh Medical School.\n\nMore information on tuition fees can be found on the undergraduate fees and funding page.\n\nAccommodation fees\n\nFind out about accommodation fees for University accommodation.\n\nFunding and scholarships\n\nThe University of St Andrews offers a number of scholarships and support packages to students each year.\n\nCareers\n\nGraduates from the six-year Medicine degree (A990) will have career prospects in practical, clinical, policy and academic positions.\n\nStudents on this programme will be responsible for their own applications to Canadian residency positions or to the Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) residency placement scheme, but will be assisted by the University of Alberta in the process.\n\nAlthough the A990 programme is primarily for applicants who want to practise medicine in Canada, A990 students are also currently eligible to apply to Foundation Training in the UK. This however cannot be guaranteed at the point of entry for those graduating in 2029 and beyond.\n\nThe Careers Centre offers one-to-one advice to all students as well as a programme of events to assist students to build their employability skills."
