Licensing fees and agreements vary based upon the duration of footage licensed, the nature of the work in which they will be included, and the size of the audience the work is expected to reach.\n\nSearch records from the entire Movietone News Collection in the library catalog.\n\nTo research and license material for use in film, television, books, or other projects, please email mircproduction@mailbox.sc.edu.\n\nMIRC is happy to support teaching, research, and assist faculty and instructors interested in scheduling instruction sessions.\n\nFor all instruction inquiries, tours, and student internships, or for any other general question related to MIRC, please contact MIRC’s Director Daniela Currò at dcurro@mailbox.sc.edu.\n\nOur curatorial team is also happy to assist patrons with instruction sessions and reference requests not related to licensing activities (for licensing see the dedicated section above).
