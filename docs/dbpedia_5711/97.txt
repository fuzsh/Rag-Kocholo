Submissions for documentary film projects are closed. Submissions will re-open in Fall 2024. Additional information on the submission and grantmaking process will be available in the upcoming months.

JustFilms accepts inquiries for direct film production grants year-round, averaging between 1,000 to 1,500 inquiries yearly. While we welcome submissions from any region of the world, we have a particular focus on the areas where the foundation has regional offices. We support 25-30 feature documentary film projects through annual grants, at all stages of production. Unfortunately, we do not fund narrative or scripted projects, or projects led by organizations.

Please note that the Ford Foundation supports many organizations that also make grants for documentary projects.

We invite you to explore whether your project might be better suited for support through other programs, many of which are included on resource lists at the International Documentary Association, Sundance Documentary Program, and American Documentary.

All projects submitted for JustFilms grants will be judged on the basis of social and cultural impact, artistic excellence, alignment with Ford Foundation priorities, and creativity and innovation in form. At JustFilms, we’re thinking about our work broadly along these lines where:

Political power focuses on a robust civil society and fair governance

Economic power focuses on workers’ rights and equitable and just economic policies

Cultural power enables artists and culture bearers to shape narratives that promote equality
