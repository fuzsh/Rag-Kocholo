Techniques and Approaches to Research with Paper” Junior Fellow Symposium\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Pforzheimer University Professor Emeritus and University Librarian Emeritus, Harvard University\n\nThe difficulty with the history of censorship is that it looks so simple: it pits oppression against freedom of expression. But if one looks harder, it appears more complicated—and full of surprises. How did censors actually do their work? How did they understand it? And how did it fit into the surrounding social and political context? By studying the day-to-day operations of censors under three authoritarian regimes—Bourbon France in the eighteenth century, British India in the nineteenth century, and Communist East Germany in the twentieth century—it is possible to rethink our understanding of censorship in general.

We invite you to join Rare Book School and the UVA Library for “Archives, Memory & Identity,” a public, one-day symposium that will bring together archivists, librarians, curators, digital humanists, academics, artists, and activists working on a range of cross-disciplinary, culturally sensitive projects that challenge traditional models for creating and stewarding visual and textual artifacts.\n\nFeaturing panel discussions on access, storytelling, and community outreach, […]\n\nRBS Seminar: Digital Sustainability for Cultural Collections\n\nPresented by: Nancy Y. McGovern & Kari R. Smith\n\nMIT Libraries (Building 14, Room 132)\n\nRare Book School is sponsoring a two-day seminar at the MIT Libraries (14N-132) in Cambridge, MA (map) on Monday and Tuesday, 11–12 December 2017 (just prior to the IEEE workshop Computational Archival Science: digital records in the age of big data).\n\nThis seminar has been designed to be of interest to curators and librarians of all kinds who are or may become responsible for the long-term management of digital content, but signup is open to anyone with an interest in the topics covered. The cost to attend the seminar is $500. […]\n\nProtest on the Page: Print as an Affordance for Revolutionary Spirits (RBS-Mellon Lecture)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and the Department of Religious Studies at Franklin & Marshall College\n\nBoncheck College House, Franklin & Marshall College\n\nConsidering two early-twentieth century instances of print culture on the northwest coast, this lecture explores the ways the printed page can serve as an affordance for cycles of public and political appeal and remembrance. Juxtaposing the anti-colonial uses of a missionary printing press by Nisga’a printers with the marginalia in an Archbishop’s library of texts on psychic research, I show the changing meanings of the revolutionary spirit in a land of contested sovereignties.\n\nPamela Klassen is Professor in the Department for the Study of Religion at the University of Toronto. She currently holds the Anneliese Maier Research Award from the Humboldt Foundation, […]\n\nBibliography Among the Disciplines Conference\n\nPresented by: Rare Book School and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nBibliography Among the Disciplines, a four-day international conference to be held in Philadelphia from 12 to 15 October 2017, will bring together scholarly professionals who are poised to address current problems pertaining to the study of textual artifacts that cross scholarly, pedagogical, professional, and curatorial domains. The conference will explore theories and methods common to the object-oriented disciplines, such as anthropology and archaeology, but new to bibliography. The Bibliography Among the Disciplines program, supported by Rare Book School and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, aims to promote focused cross-disciplinary exchange and future scholarly collaborations.\n\nSee the conference website for full schedule information and additional details.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and the University of California Santa Cruz Institute for Humanities Research\n\nUniversity of California Santa Cruz, Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nIn the past decade, historians and literary scholars have become increasingly interested in the global circulation of the written word. Much of this scholarship has focused on the movement of printed books. Other projects, such as Stanford’s Mapping the Republic of Letters initiative, have traced epistolary networks that spanned continents and oceans. But what about the cross-cultural movement of textual artifacts that weren’t books or letters? This symposium will explore the limits of book history. At what point does an object shade into being a textual artifact? How can we make space for a less Eurocentric book history by following the itineraries of objects, […]\n\nDescriptive Cataloging of Japanese Prints in the Twenty-First Century (RBS-Mellon Workshop)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and the Portland Art Museum\n\nPortland Art Museum\n\nThis workshop focuses on standards and best practices for descriptive terminology and cataloguing. Bringing together specialists of Japanese art with extensive experience in researching prints and books, we will consider how we describe, catalogue, and present these materials in American museums.\n\nAlthough collections-information systems have become much more nimble over the past decades, a number of historical factors—including the adoption of different database systems (often by the same museum), the emphasis on Western art in the development of databases, and uneven cataloguing of Japanese print collections—can still impede research and scholarly collaboration. Directed toward spirited discussions among specialists, […]\n\nReading Photographically Illustrated Texts (RBS-Mellon Workshop & Lecture)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and the Dean's Office of the Klinger College of Arts and Sciences, Marquette University\n\nMarquette University\n\nThis symposium will examine the different kinds of value that pre-1800 textual fragments possess, accrue and/or produce in and through their fragmentary nature. It will also examine the intellectual value with which we imbue the fragment, when we argue that it is or is not representative of a historical record, when we debate whether it testifies to extreme scarcity or extreme abundance, when we argue whether it does, fails to, or should perform the work of memorializing a “lost” moment.\n\nFeaturing manuscript historians and art historians from outside Marquette as well as members of Marquette’s own English, Theology, […]\n\nCognition and the Hand: “Handy Books” in the History of Knowledge, the Book, and the Book Arts (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School, the Wesleyan University Department of History, the Wesleyan University Center for the Americas, the Wesleyan University Program in Latin American Studies, the Beinecke Library, and the Yale University Council on Latin American and Iberian Studies\n\nWesleyan University and Yale University\n\nThis two-day conference at Wesleyan and Yale Universities examines the material dimensions of empire and state formation in Latin America. It works to understand the political, legal, and cultural processes of empire and state formation in relation to concrete quotidian practices of inscription. Through the creation of artifacts such as printed books, manuscripts, passports, and other kinds of technologies, Iberian empires and post-colonial states took on tangible forms as they worked to regulate social relations on the ground. At the same time, subjects actively shaped empire and state making by engaging with paper in pursuit of their own hopes and dreams. […]\n\nKnowledge, Storage, and the History of Compression (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School; Critical Media Practice, Harvard University; Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, Harvard University; History of the Book Seminar, Harvard University; Department of the History of Science, Harvard University\n\nRoom 133, Barker Center, Harvard University\n\nDoes compression have a history?\n\nAlongside a cognitive challenge of “too much to know,” information overload poses a physical challenge of “too much to store.” Indeed, the possibilities of “big data” today are predicated on technologies that compress data into ever “smaller” sizes. On the one hand, major libraries such as the NYPL, coping with spatial shortage, have increasingly emphasized the provision of digital resources—shifting physical collections offsite, and in the process sparking heated debates with researchers. On the other hand, the possibilities of digital compression have given rise to a new imagination of the universal library. In the twenty-first century, […]\n\nBuddhist Book Cultures Symposium (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and the University of Texas at Austin Department of English\n\nSinclair Suite, Texas Union 3.128, University of Texas at Austin\n\nAn oft-repeated narrative of epochal change posits that the invention of moveable type by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-fifteenth century was one that fundamentally—and immediately—propelled the medieval world into modernity. Scholarship on fifteenth-century manuscript production and the economies of the late-medieval book trade, however, reveals a complex and vibrant manuscript culture—networks of scribes, illuminators, and workshops, booksellers and readers—that did not simply cease to exist after the advent of print. The arrival of William Caxton’s press to England in 1476 would have introduced scales of production previously unknown in the country, but continuities in the format, decoration, and materials associated with book manufacture suggest that the production of handwritten documents need not have diminished. […]\n\nEccentric Readings in East Asia (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and the Institute for Advanced Studies\n\nWest Lecture Hall, Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton University\n\nWhy did some people produce idiosyncratic texts that defied the norms of reading and writing of their period? How did these practices change social actors’ relationship to political or religious authorities? What information can we obtain from the nontextual elements of documents, and in what ways does this kind of information help us better understand the meanings of texts?\n\nBy exploring the important and rich textual tradition of East Asia, this half-day symposium hopes to expand our understanding of the relationship between written culture and sociocultural power. By focusing on material and nontextual aspects of premodern East Asian texts, […]\n\nThe Medieval Bible in the Polarized World of American Religion (RBS-Mellon Lecture)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School; Duke Graduate Program in Religion; Barney Jones Endowment of the Duke Department of Religious Studies; Princeton Graduate School; Princeton Center for the Study of Religion\n\nPrinceton University\n\nFrom the days of the early reformers through the twenty-first century, Protestants have made voracious use of printed books and other media to spread a religion of the Word. For its vaunted emphasis on texts, Protestantism remains associated with words, thought, and private reading, as opposed to things, practices, and communal devotion. However, as scholars across the disciplines have demonstrated, texts are never only containers for words. Whether handwritten, printed, or typed on a screen, words and their meanings are entwined with material forms and embodied practices at every stage of their production, circulation, and reception.\n\nThe material bases of both Protestantism and textual media have been key sites of inquiry in the larger material turn in the humanities. […]\n\nTriangle Book History Symposium (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and the National Humanities Center\n\nNational Humanities Center (et al.)\n\nSponsored by the Andrew W.

Berkeley\n\nWidener Lecture Hall, Penn Museum (Friday); Kislak Center for Special Collections Class of 1978 Orrery Pavilion, University of Pennsylvania (Saturday)\n\nThe goal of this symposium is to dissect the interpretive aims of “materiality studies” through a focused lens of works on paper. In recent years, “materiality” has become a buzzword across the humanities, and an impressive range of methods, investigative starting points, and analytic goals have come to rest under the term’s mantle. But in grouping this diverse array of approaches under a single heading, does each method’s unique potential risk becoming flattened and obscured? An illustrated book might just as easily inspire a reconsideration of workshop practices as it could a chemical investigation of ink formulae; are social history and chemistry, […]\n\nThe Never-ending Popularity of Njáls Saga: The Manuscript Evidence (RBS-Mellon Lecture)\n\nPresented by: Andrew W.

Recent scholarship has emphasized the integrative nature of economic, material, and religious developments. In contrast, we will examine what the “global” could mean in intellectual and cultural interactions in terms of both integration and disintegration across multiple continents and oceans. Our conference participants will explore how the notion of “(dis)entanglement” allows us to evoke a polycentric early modern world that is simultaneously connecting and disconnecting.\n\nSee the event website for full schedule and additional details.

Linden Kent Memorial Professor Karen Chase (Brontë scholar and author of Eros & Psyche) leads a discussion with author Patricia Park (Re Jane) and rare book curator Barbara Heritage (“Shaping Eyre”) about the enduring influence of Charlotte Brontë’s nineteenth-century novel, Jane Eyre. The discussion, to be held in the Dome Room of UVA’s renovated Rotunda (4:00–5:00 p.m.) will be followed by a book signing and an opportunity to explore the rare artifacts in the accompanying RBS exhibition, […]\n\nCanons & Contingence: Art Histories of the Book in England and America (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Whether through variables in the production process or through the vagaries of transmission and consumption, each manuscript or printed book carries with it the traces of a unique history.\n\nCartographic Materialities: Mapping the Pre-Modern World (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School, University of Oregon Special Collections and University Archives, the Oregon Humanities Center, the Robert D. Clark Honors College\n\nBrowsing Room, Knight Library, University of Oregon\n\nThis talk, organized by the Oregon Rare Books Initiative, was given by Cynthia Herrup, Professor Emerita of History and John R. Hubbard Chair in British History Emerita at USC Dornsife.\n\nWhenever a presidency draws to its end, we Americans brace for the announcement of the president’s final pardons. We brace and then we complain: should George W. Bush have commuted the sentence of Scooter Libby? Was it right for Bill Clinton to pardon financier Marc Rich? Had Gerald Ford promised in advance to pardon Richard Nixon? Pardons are meant to do good—to evoke mercy and to provide a necessary remedy to the sometimes overly harsh application of the law, […]\n\nShakespeare, The Book (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and Trinity University\n\nSpecial Collections, Coates Library, Trinity University\n\nAs the apposition in the title hopefully hints, this symposium is committed to the central claim that Shakespeare, as we identify and teach him today, has been fundamentally shaped by the book trade and its customers. Print publishers and retail booksellers have marketed and sold Shakespeare’s writing, printers have undertaken the physical and intellectual labor of transforming manuscripts into print forms that are recognizable as books, and readers have been left after all of this to buy, engage with, and preserve—or ignore and discard—the editions that have been made available to them. Individuals connected to the early theater industry in London appear to have supplied manuscripts to begin this process, […]\n\nThe Materiality of Scientific Knowledge: Image-Text-Book (RBS-Mellon Symposium)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School; Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts at the University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania Humanities Forum; Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation\n\nClass of 1978 Orrery Pavilion, Kislak Center, Van Pelt-Dietrich Library, University of Pennsylvania\n\nThis two day symposium will explore the material factors—specifically, the conditions of writing, printing, and illustration—that underwrite the exchange and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Throughout the long history of scientific investigation, concepts and theories were formulated, shared, legitimated, and disseminated in manuscript and printed texts, as well as paintings, drawings, and engravings. Most scholarship in this area has focused on either the text or the images in scientific manuscripts and printed books, or has explored the relationship between text and image from the perspective of a single field or historical period. This symposium will bring scholars from a wide range of academic disciplines (history of science, […]\n\nStates of the Book (RBS-Mellon Conference)\n\nPresented by: The Andrew W.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School, Book Studies at Wellsley, the Program in Medieval-Renaissance Studies, and the Departments of English and History at Wellesley College\n\nMargaret Clapp Library Lecture Room, Wellesley College\n\nOur media landscape is changing radically. New technologies offer new ways of reading and new modes of presenting texts—but how completely can we really break with old paradigms? Do the design principles of the printed book have a place in our digital future? To find an answer, this conference compares our ongoing technological revolution with an earlier one: the invention of the printed book itself in Renaissance Europe.

Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography at Rare Book School and CMEMS\n\nHistory Building Room 307, Stanford University\n\nCan a digital database recreate the ways in which Galileo Galileo organized and used his modest collection of books? Late Renaissance readers did not organize or access their books according to the same descriptors upon which digital tools typically rely: authors’ names, publication dates, titles, or single genre labels. Since Galileo compared unpleasant reading to perusing a cabinet of curiosities and delightful reading to visiting a museum gallery, this presentation suggests ways in which an appropriate database for his library should become more than the infrastructure for an archive for books. Examples drawn from the poetry, plays, and philosophical treatises that Galileo read will show the ways in which digital humanities tools can create other ways to identify texts in order to assemble a database that represents process via its organization of content.
