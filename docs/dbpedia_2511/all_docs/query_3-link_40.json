Because such bonusses make character creation almost irrelevant. Aniquarian gear is very cheap and easy to get at around lvl3-4. For instance there is no point to make a high strength character in the game. You can just live with Bless spell until you reach lvl3-4 and then get a belt that increases your strength to 21 right away.",
