The authorship of this work, at least in terms of primary credit, still remains open, with William Burke (Edmunds cousin) and Richard Burke (his brother) frequently being given credit as collaborators. Burke himself told Boswell that he only revised it. Whoever the ultimate responsible party, the work was nonetheless extremely popular, frequently reprinted and translated. The first volume deals largely with Hispanic America, relating to Mexico, New Mexico, and the English claims to California, Peru, Chile, and Brazil. The second volume describes European colonies in the West Indies.

Octavo calf (rebacked).\n\nI got a bit confused trying to untangle all the forms in which Burkes charges and Hastings defence appeared. So what is here are articles I to XXII of Burkes charges (of which XXII, the last, seems the only one Burke is solely responsible for). Of these, articles I to XVI are continuously paginated and signed; articles XVII to XXI are a separate printing and presumably had a title if sold separately; and article XXII is again separately signed, and titled as the fourth [and last] part. At the end of the first part of the Defence the publishers advertise part II ready for Thursday next (9 May) and The Charges complete in one volume which, as Burke had only finished presenting his charges the day before the advert dated 6 May, seems fairly speedy. Hastings defence is in 3 parts each with titles but is continuously paginated and signed. So, some of it may be first printings and some may be reprinting, presumably from standing type.

While this is true of Burke in his response to the French revolution of 1789. His response to events in the British American colonies some years before was very different. At this time Burke was still aWhig. In this famous work, he defends the rights of the American Colonels against the arbitrary power of the British Crown. Indeed he argued that military intervention against the Colonies, would undermine at the same time liberty in Britain. The book itself is in very good overall condition for its age.

Burke [1729-1797] is considered a founder of modern conservatism. This is true to some extent, but not quite. He believed in popular government and recognized the inevitability of change. Indeed, he believed that a state that could not adapt to change was a state doomed to failure.\n\nBook number: 42223\n\nVendor: Lawbook Exchange\n\nUSD 150.00 [Appr.: EURO 108 | £UK 93 | JP¥ 12373]\n\nBURKE, EDMUND [ INTRODUCTIONS BY F.W.

Edmund Burke PC (12 January [NS] 1729 - 9 July 1797) was an Irish statesman, author, orator, political theorist, and philosopher who, after relocating to England, served for many years in the House of Commons of Great Britain as a member of the Whig party. He is mainly remembered for his support of the cause of the American Revolutionaries, and for his later opposition to the French Revolution. The latter led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig party, which he dubbed the Old Whigs, in opposition to the pro-French-Revolution New Whigs, led by Charles James Fox. Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals in the nineteenth century. Since the twentieth century, he has generally been viewed as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism, as well as a representative of classical liberalism.
