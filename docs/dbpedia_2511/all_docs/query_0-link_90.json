        "text": "Yeowell was born about 1803 in London. He is said to have been employed in early life under the vestry of Shoreditch, and to have worked at indexing and related work for booksellers. Soon after the establishment by William John Thoms of Notes and Queries, Yeowell became sub-editor, and he filled the position for more than twenty years, retiring in September 1872. During this period Yeowell supplied by research at the British Museum the answers which appeared each week under the heading of ‘Queries with Answers.’ He lived at first in Pentonville, near the Sadler's Wells Theatre, and then at Barnsbury.\n\nOn his retirement from ‘Notes and Queries’ he was nominated a poor brother at the London Charterhouse by the Duke of Buccleuch at the suggestion of Thoms. He died at the Charterhouse on 10 December 1875, being buried in Highgate cemetery on 14 Dec. He was ‘probably the last nonjuror, if not the last Jacobite, in England’"
