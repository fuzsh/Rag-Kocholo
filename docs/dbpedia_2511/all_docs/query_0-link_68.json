NOTES ON BOOKS : The Library Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society Journal of the Friends His- torical Society ' Survey of London.' Notices to Correspondents. LONDON CLUBS : BIBLIOGRAPHY. ONE of the many sub -headings of the long- hoped-for Bibliography of London will have to be ' Clubs and Coteries ' for the reason that these are a distinctive feature of London history and topography and their literature is considerable. The following few notes are put forward as an attempt at the task, being the list of a small col- lection gathered in forming a library of London books : GENERAL HISTORIES. 1. Secret History of Clubs, particularly the Kit-cat, Beefsteak, Virtuosos, Quacks, Knights of the Golden Fleece, Florists, Beaus, &c., with the Originals and Characters of the Most Noted Members. First Edition, 8vo., Calf, 1709. [By Edward Ward.] Reprinted about 1884. 2. History and Antiquities of the Most Re- markable Clubs in London and Westminster.

A note on the last page explains that this is only a first part of a \" Compleat History of Clubs from their Origin to the Present Day,\" to be issued in a number of volumes published at intervals. The text is largely a translation and adaptation of Ned Ward's familiar Volume No. 1. INDIVIDUAL \"CLUBS. 6. The Athenaeum.
