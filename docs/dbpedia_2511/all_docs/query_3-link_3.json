        "text": "This article seeks to counteract the tendency of some recent historians to underrate antiquarian studies in medieval England. It demonstrates the flourishing antiquarianism of the fifteenth century, first especially among the monks and later among the clergy and even the laity. The monks did research on local history in order to prove the antiquity and legal rights of their houses, while the ‘seculars’ viewed the subject more broadly. It is usually impossible to assess exactly to what extent a scholar engaged in antiquarian studies for practical reasons, and to what extent his motive was objective, intellectual curiosity; however, the evidence suggests that by the end of the century the latter motive was gaining ground.\n\n4 For example, Sir Thomas states that Leland, like many antiquaries of his day, remained ‘medieval in mind’; he was ‘a man two-faced, i n one direction looking hopefully forward into a new era of empirical research and practical survey, and at the same time looking with affection backward to the writing-desk of the medieval scholastic chronicler-antiquary where a traditional fable might be repeated without unrestful inquiry or impertinent sixteenth century doubt’; Ibid. p. 63. Similarly, Sir Thomas comments that in the sixteenth century ‘antiquarian thought tended to remain medieval in kind—medieval in credulity and in recklessness of conjecture’; Ibid. p. 65.\n\n10 Printed John of Glastonbury, ‘Cronica sive Antiquitates Glastoniensis Ecclesie’, ed. Carley, J. P. (British Archaeological Reports, 47 (i, ii), 1978, 2 vols.)Google Scholar. Dr. Carley in the introduction to his edition argues against the traditionally accepted date, c. 1400, for the composition of the chronicle. However, I do not find his arguments convincing; see my review of his edition in E.H.R. xcv (1980), 358–63CrossRefGoogle Scholar. If one accepts the traditional date of composition this of course rules out the possibility that John Seen, Carley's candidate for authorship, wrote the chronicle.\n\n19 Printed Liber Monasterii de Hyda, ed. Edwards, Edward (Rolls Series, 1866)Google Scholar. The possibility that Rudborne was the author of the Liber is suggested by the similarity of its arrangement, under kings, with that of the Historia Major, and also by the fact that it uses two of the unidentified sources cited in the Historia Major—Girardus Cornubiensis's De Gestis Regwm West-Saxonum (see Hist. Major, pp. 189, 201, 204 etc.Google Scholar, and, for Girardus,Hardy, T. D., Descriptive Catalogue of Materials relating to the History of Great Britain and Ireland to 1327 (Rolls Series, 1862-1971, 3 vols. in 4 pts., reprinted New York, 1963, iii, 50–1))Google Scholar, and ‘Vigilantius’ (for which see p. 78 and nn. 31, 32 below); see Edwards, op cit., p. xxi. The evidence of the only extant manuscript is compatible with this suggestion; see p. 78 and n. 40 below. Perhaps further research would result in a firm conclusion.\n\n56 Elmham, op. cit., pp. 122–4. Elmham erroneously dates this dispute to Henry Ill's. reign, apparently because he identified Archbishop Richard as Richard Grant, archbishop 1229–31. However, the reference (see below) to Philip, count of Flanders (1168–91) makes it clear that the archbishop concerned was Richard of Dover (1173–84). This conclusion is confirmed by the account of the dispute between St. Augustine's and Archbishop Richard of Dover given by Gervase of Canterbury, which mentions that the leaden bulla was then called in question;The Historical Works of Gervase of Canterbury, ed. Stubbs, William (Rolls Series, 1879-1880, 2 vols.), i, 296–7Google Scholar.\n\n61 Elmham's library list (see p. 80 below) includes at least one ancient manuscript in uncials. For the school of uncial writing at Canterbury, c. 700, see Thompson, E. Maunde, An Introduction to Greek and Latin Palaeography (Oxford, 1912), pp. 384–5Google Scholar. Professor Deanesly argues that Elmham's facsimiles of Ethelbert's charters are in Merovingian script and are based on genuine documents; Deanesly, op. cit., pp. 103–10 passim, and the same author's ‘Early English and Gallic ministers’, T.R.H.S. 4th ser. xxiii (1941), 53–66 passimGoogle Scholar, and ‘Canterbury and Paris in the reign of Æthelberht’, History, xxvi (1941), 101–4Google Scholar. However Levison, op. cit., pp. 174 et seq., has demonstrated that this view is not sound.\n\n69 Ibid. pp. 118–19. The foundation charter of Lewes priory, granted by William de Warenne, first earl of Surrey, makes no reference to the presence of th e earl's hair in the seal;Early Yorkshire Charters, ed. Clay, C. T. (Yorkshire Archaeological Soc. record ser., extra ser. 1935-1965, 10 vols.), vi, 54–5, no. 2Google Scholar. However, the confirmation by William de Warenne, third earl of Surrey (1138–48), notes that he gave seizin of a tenth penn y of his rents ‘by hair of his own head and that of Ralph de Warenne his brother, cut with a knife by Henry, bishop of Winchester, before the altar’; printed Ibid. vi, 84–5, no. 32. Cf.Galbraith, V. H., ‘Monastic foundation charters of the eleventh and twelfth centuries’, Cambridge Historical Journal, iv (1934), 211Google Scholar. The entry concerning the seal at Castle Acre is even more problematical. Elmham states that the earl of Lincoln in question ‘pluribus possessionibus eandem ecclesiam dotavit’. But the founder of Castle Acre priory was William de Warenne, first earl of Surrey (1088) and its benefactors were his successors as earls of Surrey; see V.C.H., Norfolk, ii, p. 356, and C[ockayne], G. E., The Complete Peerage, ed. Gibbs, Vicary et al. (London 1910-1959, 13 vols.), xii, pt. i, 494–7 passimGoogle Scholar. None of the known names of their wives is Muriel; however, the name of the first earl's second wife is unknown (G. E. C[ockayne], op. cit., xii, pt. i, 494); possibly she was called Muriel. None of the countesses of Lincoln was called Muriel, as far as is known.\n\n78 e.g. the pedigrees of the families of Sayers (ibid., i, 96), Scures (ibid., i, 97–8), Fossard (ibid., i, 104), and Sculcottes (ibid., i, 169–70). The pedigree of the Etton family of Gilling, which is combined with the history of its estates (ibid., i, 316–18, and other references, for which see th e index in Ibid. iii), provided much of the information used in Bilson, John, ‘Gilling Castle’, Yorks. Arch. J. xix (1907), 105–22 passimGoogle Scholar. Burton also gives the pedigree of the Forz family (the earls of Aumale), the founders of the abbey, and the descent of the honour and of th e lordship of Holderness;Chron. de Melsa, i, 89–93Google Scholar.\n\n80 For the practice with regard to the taxation of clerical properties see Stubbs, W., Constitutional History of England, ii (3rd ed., Oxford, 1887), pp. 416, n. 1, 443, n. 4, 580Google Scholar;Willard, J. F., ‘The taxes upon movables of the reign of Edward II’, E.H.R. xxix (1914), 318CrossRefGoogle Scholar;Lunt, W. E., The Valuation of Norwich (Oxford, 1926), p. 72, n. 6Google Scholar;Willard, J. F., Parliamentary Taxes on Personal Property I2go to 1334 (Cambridge, Mass., 1934), pp. 94 et seqqGoogle Scholar. For the ninth granted in 1339 in particular see Fryde, Natalie, ‘Edward Ill's removal of his ministers and judges, 1340–1’, Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research, xlviii (1975), 152Google Scholar. For help on the subject of clerical taxation and for the above references I am indebted to Dr. Gerald Harriss and Professor E. B. Fryde.\n\n99 A number of other examples can b e cited of tracts written with a commemorative intention but which show antiquarian interests. Some of John Wessington's tracts (see p. 84, and n. 108 below) are primarily commemorative. One, for example, gives th e scriptural references to the inscriptions beneath the images (or pictures) of the hundre d and forty-eight monks at the altar of SS. Jerome and Benedict in Durham Cathedral, and names some of the hitherto unidentified figures: Durha m Cathedral Library MS. B II I 30, folios 6–25 v; partly printed in Rites of Durham, ed. Fowler, J. T. (Surtees Soc, cvii, 1903), 124–36Google Scholar; cf.Historiae Dunelmensis Scriptores Tres, Gaufridus de Coldingham, Robertus de Graystanes, et Willielmus de Chambre, ed. Raine, James (Surtees Soc, ix, 1839), cclxixGoogle Scholar,Pantin, , ‘Some medieval treatises on the origins of monasticism’, 200, Dobson, Durham Priory 1400–1540. p. 382Google Scholar. Wessington worked on the books in the cloister and cathedral library; Raine, op. cit., cclxx. The desire to instruct and antiquarian interest were probably the main reasons why at Christ Church, Canterbury, William Glaston-bury described the scenes in the twelve windows of the choir, partly from his own observation. His description is noticed and printed The Chronicle of William Glastynbury, Monk of the Priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, 1418–48, ed. Woodruff, C. E. in Arch. Cant. xxxvii (1925), 123–5, 138. 139–51Google Scholar.\n\n111 Durham Dean and Chapter Archives, Register III, fo. 211–211v. Discussed and printed by Brentano, Robert, ‘The Jurisdictio Spiritualis: an example of fifteenth-century English histiography’, Speculum, xxxii (1957), 326–32CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Professor Brentano (op. cit., 327) only tentatively ascribes the work to Wessington (it is not in the contemporary list of his works), but his authorship is accepted by Professor Dobson (op. cit.), p. 386). Another tract written to establish the truth about the past, without litigious or even tendentious purpose, was written at St. Albans: it explains exactly how the abbot of St. Albans had lost his right to precedence in parliament in the reign of Richard II; printed Amundesham, i, 414–17Google Scholar.\n\n117 The holograph of Rous's list has not survived, but there are a number of copies, the best of which is printed in ‘Survey of the Antiquities of the City of Oxford’ composed in 1661–6 by Anthony Wood; i.The City and Suburbs, ed. Clark, Andrew (Oxford Historical Soc. xv, 1889), pp. 638–41Google Scholar. See Aston, T. H., ‘Oxford's medieval alumni’, Past and Present, no. 74 (1977), 36–8 and nnCrossRefGoogle Scholar. It should be noted that the remarkably accurate bird's eye view (executed c. 1463) of New College by the warden Thomas Chandler, belongs to this period; see Smith, A. H., New College Oxford and its Buildings (Oxford, 1952), p. 179 (see also pp. 43, 49, 109) and frontispieceGoogle Scholar. I am grateful to Dr. J. N. L. Myres for calling my attention to this picture.\n\n119 The latter, the so-called Yorkist roll, the text of which is in English, now BL MS. Additional 48976, is printed with line reproductions of the pictures, by Courthope, op. cit. See also Wright, C. E., ‘The Rous Roll: the English version’, British Museum Quarterly, xxx (1955-1956), 79Google Scholar. The revised roll, the so-called Lancastrian roll, preserved in the College of Arms, has no t been published but its text, which is in Latin, is printed in footnotes to the descriptions of the plates in Courthope, op. cit., and there is a good account of it in Wagner, A. R., A Catalogue of English Mediaeval Rolls of Arms (Harleian Soc, c (1948) and Oxford, 1950), 116–18Google Scholar. Pictures from it are reproduced in Russell, A. G. B., ‘The Rous Roll’, Burlington Magazine, xxx (1917), 31 and pl. 1Google Scholar;Mann, J. G., ‘Instances of antiquarian feeling in medieval and renaissance art’, Arch. J. lxxxix (1932), pls. 11 (2), in, iv, opposite pp. 259, 260, 261Google Scholar, respectively, and Kendrick, op. cit., pls. n (b)-iv. It may be noted that a rather similar roll to Rous's was executed in the mid-fifteenth century for the Sudeleys and Botelers of Sudeley castle. The roll is now in the New York Public Library, Spenser Collection MS. 193. It comprises a history of England, the royal pedigree with portraits of the kings in roundels, and the pedigree of the Sudeleys and Botelers, with heraldic shields; see Sudeley, Lord, ‘Medieval Sudeley. Part I. The Sudeleys and Botelers of Sudeley Castle’, Family History, the Journal of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies, x (1977), 9–20Google Scholar, and D. Winkless, ‘Medieval Sudeley. Part II.

For full mail with coifs in one piece, resembling that worn by the British earls of Warwick in Rous's pictures, see Laking, G. F., A Record of European Armour and Arms through Seven Centuries (London 1920-1922, 5 vols.), i, 66–70Google Scholar.

For a reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon warrior not unlike those depicted by Rous, see ibid, i, 31, fig. 39. For the introduction of mixed mail and plate in the mid-thirteenth ceutury see ibid, i, 121 et seqq., and for its development in the fourteenth century see ibid, i, 145.

For th e suit on Richard Beauchamp's effigy, itself an important landmark in the history of armoury, see Laking, op. cit., i, 163–70. See also the next note.\n\n122 For an English example of the helm chained to the hauberk see the brass (c. 1300) of Sir Roger de Trumpington; reproduced Lysons, Daniel and Lysons, Samuel, Magna Britannia (London, 1806-1822, 6 vols.), ii, opposite p. 65Google Scholar.
