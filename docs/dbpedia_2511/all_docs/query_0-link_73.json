        "text": "Quick Review\n\nPoppers make Mrs. Partridge cum harder. I paraphrase, but not by much, honest. She's said so herself, in her latest autobiography. She has a lot to say, and from the get in this new book, about her private life, if it can still be called so now, and about her sexuality specifically. So, if anybody was expecting Shirley Jones to be just the the sugar-sweet ingénue of those Rogers and Hammerstein musicals, or the nice lady in pant-suits driving the bus in that Seventies sitcom, think again.\n\nShe's led an interesting life, has Shirley. Her people were Pittsburgh brewers and bartenders. (And yes, she was in fact Miss Pittsburgh early on.) Discovered -- and groped a bit -- and signed to a personal contract by the great composer, Richard Rogers, our Shirley has been a star since she was a teenager. As Laurey, in the film of Oklahoma!, she won many a heart singing \"Many a New Day\" in perfect, virginal white, and broke many another as Julie Jordan in Carousel, singing \"If I Loved You,\" again with the stalwart Gordon MacRae. (It was supposed to be Frank Sinatra, playing Billy Bigelow, but Ol' Blue Eyes funked out the first day of shooting, the reader discovers here, to go fuck Ava Gardner.) She went on to win an Oscar, lest we forget, playing a prostitute in Elmer Gantry.\n\nFor those of us now of a certain age, for good and ill, she will always be the matriarch of The Partridge Family on the hugely popular television show. She's quick to acknowledge that the phenomenal success of that show eventually had everything to do with her stepson, David Cassidy. While he was her costar on that show, he became the biggest pop star of his generation, for a hot minute there, with one of her own three kids, Sean Cassidy, following after.\n\nAt the heart of her personal story is her long and troubled marriage to the great love of her life, the equally beautiful Jack Cassidy. When they met and fell in love, he was a married man, and a star on Broadway. She was the new kid. Theirs was a justly storied romance. They went on to have three beautiful children together. She went on to become a movie and television star. Jack Cassidy never quite did. A man whose talents were only exceeded by his insecurities, miseries for everyone involved ensued. Eventually her marriage to Cassidy would end in divorce, and his life would end tragically, after many professional disappointments and repeated hospitalizations for mental illness, in an accidental fire set by his own cigarette.\n\nJones is blunt in her assessment of both of her marriages, as she is in nearly everything else, (from suave to nuts, as it were: as her second marriage, to the deeply eccentric comedian Marty Ingels, not without it's own very public trials, has lasted. He makes her laugh. I get that.)\n\nThe headlines for this book have come from some of the hotter revelations therein: Anthony Newley and his then wife, Joan Collins, suggesting a four-way with the Cassidys -- Shirley declined, Jack Cassidy slipping on Shirley's peignoir, stockings and slippers on their wedding night, etc. All good clean fun in a movie star's memoirs, as far as I'm concerned, and I've read a lot of 'em. What's missed in just retelling those stories out of the context of the book is, for me the real revelation of the thing. Here's an eighty-year-old dame, a genuine star of some of the last great movie musicals, a television star, and an Oscar winner, no less, who doesn't hesitate to share that sex, and masturbation for that matter, are still a vital part of the old girl's routine. When it comes to sex in general, she digs it. Always has, probably always will. Cassidy taught her a lot. He was really good at it, evidently and had the tool for the job. (Inherited, our Shirley proudly tells us, by all his sons -- in the one instance of truly questionable taste in the whole book. Not like I wasn't tickled to read that about all dear old, once dreamy Cassidy men.) More than that though, this isn't just some celebrity nonentity's kiss and tell, but rather a damned fine actress, and a mature woman honestly recounting her experience, her love life, yes, but also her life, as lived, all of it. Sad to say, I don't think there's a male actor of her generation we would be quite so much aflutter over had it been a man saying the same damned things.\n\nStill, our Shirley is a Republican, so there's that potential invitation or two she might not be getting again -- she should live so long, we should all live so long as to see another Republican Inaugural. (\"Not\", as the kids I suppose still say.)\n\nI think her an admirable character, all in all, and I do not doubt, a helluva lot of fun, our Shirley, in and out of the sack. Her book anyway was worth the evening it took to read.\n\n(Meanwhile, it's not a song actually associated with her career that's played in my head since I read the book, but an old Sinatra tune:\n\n\"Have you met Miss Jones?\" someone said as we shook hands,\n\nShe was just Miss Jones to me...\n\nNot so much now.)\n\nReason Not the Need\n\nI've again had to \"repair\" my copy of Hume's Essays. I put the verb between quotation-marks because, in the first place, I haven't so much fixed the crumbling binding as delayed its dissolution awhile longer with Elmer's Glue, and secondly because the sentence suggests that I've just read Hume to tatters. I haven't. I bought this little book, \"As Is\" just a year or two ago. I paid $4.50 for it. Since then I've read all of ten essays in it, and those, with titles like \"Of Essay Writing,\" and \"Of Love and Marriage,\" the easiest.\n\nAs a rule, I'm not much for philosophers. Essayists I like. History I read all the time. Even short works with titles like, \"Of the Origin of Government,\" or \"The Platonist,\" not so much. Still, David Hume is not a difficult stylist, as the general run of philosophers go, and as a gentleman of the Enlightenment, he's very much my sort.\n\nI picked the Essays out of my general stacks again because I was already reading Hume this summer, and wanted further reference.\n\nDr. Johnson thought David Hume a dangerous man. To the reader of either gentleman today, this seems a curious response to such an important, if largely benign figure in modern philosophy. But then, the Englishman loudly disliked the Scots as a body, or claimed to, despite his affection for Boswell. (Clearly, the Doctor rather enjoyed teasing his biographer.) It's also clear from conversations reproduced in the great biography that Johnson, justly or unjustly, considered the philosopher a bad'un, and went so far as to hurl the opprobrium of \"atheist\" at him. Of course, the definition of that word \"atheist\" in Johnson's day was rather broader than it is in ours. (Don't know that it would have occurred to Hume to simply do away with the whole metaphysical and cultural apparatus of Christianity, for example, as a militant atheist like Richard Dawkins might hope to nowadays, although Hume himself clearly had little use for any of it.) For Johnson, that word, \"atheist,\" was entirely pejorative, perhaps the worst thing he could think to say of another human being and doubtless reserved in even his liberal usage for only those he saw as active enemies of religion. Whatever Hume's actual beliefs or lack thereof, from the evidence of his biography and his writings on the subject of religion, we would probably describe him as a sceptic, for want of specifics, hence more an agnostic. Certainly, Hume was too cautious a man to have ever used the word to describe himself. \"Atheist\", in its more activist, contemporary meaning, may seem something of an exaggeration, even now, at least in so far as Hume's published work. Privately, he seems to have disbelieved in both God and his Heaven, but Johnson would not have ever heard him say so in person or print. But scepticism, even just doubt, or any divergence from strict orthodoxy was enough to brand Hume an \"atheist\", and not just for Johnson. Indeed, what he'd written was enough to keep Hume from not one but two potentially lucrative and estimable academic appointments, presumably on just such grounds.\n\nJohnson's antipathy to Hume nevertheless does indeed seem a little strange, and not just to the casual reader of both. (So strange in fact as to have produced a few years back a whole book arguing their philosophical kinship, by one Professor Adam Potkay.) Both were Tories after all: politically conservative monarchists, both just shy of actually espousing the lost cause of the Jacobites, with little enough affection for the German Georges, Whig reforms, Voltaire, or \"the mob.\" Both saw tradition and the stability of political and cultural institutions as fundamental to the maintenance of individual liberty and the English Constitution. Neither trusted either republicanism or representative democracy -- at least not in any form we might recognize as such -- and both saw revolution as a dangerous and irrational destructive force.\n\nJohnson may never have been the most tolerant man when it came to religion -- or any disagreement for that matter -- but what makes Hume \"dangerous\"?\n\nI've started the second volume of Hume's History of England, aka My Summer Reading Project. Not much in the way of dangerous ideas so far. Indeed, unlike some of the other and later English histories I've read, Hume's seems to me deliberately dry and rather rigidly objective. There's none of Macaulay's Romantic dash and Whig triumphalism, none of Froude's fury, nor for that matter any of the more quietly progressive, more typically Victorian optimism of John Richard Green. From the evidence of Hume's first volume, from prehistory to King John, there's nearly nothing to suggest a style, let alone an agenda. Facts, such as Hume had, questionable, incomplete and or horrifying as they may be, are pretty much all that's on offer. Facts carefully marshaled in tight formation and marched down the ages, page after page, and while the historian clearly disapproves of all this barbarity and bloodshed, he reports it all as honestly as he can. He doesn't judge Canute for failing to be a decent chap, as some of the later gentlemen-historians might have done, and neither is he much impressed Æthelberht of Kent conversion to Christianity. Hume seems to judge most men by their times. Ironically then, at least in this, Hume can read as a more modern historian than many that came well after him. Can make reading history a rather more dull business than otherwise though, that kind of strict reasonableness. Hume hardly lets so much as a hint of real emotion into the whole first 400 pages.\n\nAdmittedly, in his History, when it comes to the Church, he isn't subtle in his disdain for the institution from the start. Saints, from the martyrs to St. Thomas More, he clearly finds risible, priests, prelates and popes all come in for a a measure of blunt disrespect in Hume's evaluation of both their actual motives and their effect on the body politic. This might once have passed for the general British distrust in those days for all things Roman Catholic. (There are periodic nods to \"true religion\" in the text, a traditional Protestant catch-phrase.)\n\nStill, nothing to warrant such hostility from Johnson, I shouldn't have thought. I've read Hume's essay \"On Miracles\" just tonight to get a clearer picture of what it was that might have set Johnson again' him. Not the most orthodox discussion of the subject, certainly. Neither is it a denial of either Christ or Christianity.\n\nElsewhere Hume said, \"In our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence. A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence.\"\n\nAccording to the evidence then, at least insofar as I've been willing to look, it's only just occurred to me what it was got Hume such a reputation for disbelief, at least so far as his History is concerned. It is Providence that is missing. There's not a hint of the Hand of God anywhere in it. Men move about, make wars, and kings, make some progress in terms of both civilization and the creation of workable political institutions, make history. Various claims are made on the supernatural; first the old gods are invoked and then the new God, and still men move about, make wars, etc. It is never Hume who names God in any of this hugger-mugger of Princes and Popes, competing dynasties and systems. If anything, at least in the early going, it is at most those rare instances of rational self-interest, of sense that seem to offer the only suggestions of future prosperity, tranquility, civility, order.\n\nWhat's made this all seem strikingly relevant in the past few days has been a test set me by social media, a test I recently failed. Having made contact with a few old friends via facebook, I've now been \"friended\" in turn by a number of people I remember less well; people from my hometown, people with whom I went to school. Among this wider circle of my \"new\" old friends, there have proved to be more than a few with whom I have little or nothing otherwise in common. There are inevitably Republicans, and NRA members, and yes, even Christians among my more established and better remembered friends. Now there are people, at least in my new \"virtual\" acquaintance, who are not only at variance with me politically, but for whom social media is a regular, if not daily means of expressing their political and religious opinions, just as inevitably those with whom I am in better agreement do. That then has been the test.\n\nNaturally, I do not agree with everything posted by my fellow progressives and liberals. I do not think Monsanto has been a particularly responsible corporate citizen, for example, but neither do I think that GMOs are tools designed specifically to poison third world children or to eliminate heirloom tomatoes from my local farmers' market. I do not want to Take Back the Night anymore, it's true, and neither do I wish to sign the virtual petition requiring skateboarding helmets. Just as inevitably, from the other side, I am as completely disinterested in joining a prayer network as I am in recipes made from corn chips and ground beef. All of that can and does just slide right by me without comment. To each, virtually his or her own.\n\nThis diversity of opinion has been, I've thought, good for me; a lesson in tolerance. (Such a liberal notion, in both the older and newer, more American sense, I suppose, but there we are.) I've had to find my own way of negotiating what may or may not require comment. Racism, homophobia and misogyny are all on my list of what cannot pass without challenge in what is, after all, my own little corner of the virtual town square. Not on my front door, thank you very much. (Perhaps I was naive, but this has come up more often recently than I might ever had thought still possible.) Likewise obvious, often less than entirely innocent errors of fact and or attribution. (Poor ol' George Orwell seems to come in for a lot of the latter.)\n\nI think, on the whole, I've handled myself pretty responsibly in this new context; I've minded my manners more often than not, not said nearly what I might have done, and I've tried with some success to be respectful even in fairly heated exchanges with what are, after all, only virtual friends or put it another way, strangers. I have tried to be kind, even when I may not have felt much like being kind.\n\nTo \"unfriend\" someone has become a response of only last resort, though I haven't hesitated to do so when on rare occasions it has become clear that continuing the conversation can only make me, and presumably the other party, really unhappy. (This happened again not but a few days ago, over a posting presumably inspired by a recent criminal acquittal, a posting I initially intended to refute as best I could, point by point, before I finally just had to admit defeat and say goodbye. The sentiments expressed were flatly racist, the author of the post was a notorious reactionary, a man I personally detest. I do not believe the person who put this item up on facebook, my old school friend, intended offence to me personally, but I had, it seems already exhausted my patience in previous discussions of like postings. I simply wasn't willing to argue why Patrick Buchanan is a shit, but neither was I willing to let that kind of hatefulness go unchallenged. I wished my friend well, sincerely, and admitted defeat.)\n\nNevertheless, it's been good for me, this new commitment to respectfully disagree, as often and as best I can, it really has. I've learned from it a patience clearly not altogether natural to me. It has reminded me of lessons learned in childhood, from good parents and teachers, lessons that, luckily, I have had the need of less often since I moved away from places where my own beliefs and opinions would have inevitably put me very much in the minority. It has reminded me daily of the persistence of many of the ideas I rejected when I determined, at a very young age, to get as far away, physically and psychically as possible from the people and opinions that threatened my sanity and well being.\n\nI was shocked then, in a very recent exchange with one of these renewed contacts, to find myself arguing not over a difference of opinion, as I'd assumed, but rather with a rejection of the very premise from which I was arguing, namely that tolerance of diversity in religious belief, or in my case, disbelief, was an inherent good. Discretion even now prevents me reproducing any substantial part of the conversation to which I refer here. I still believe that the other party to this discussion is neither a bad person nor an unkind one. Obviously, I think she is wrong. I don't feel I am betraying any confidence in quoting her final statement on the subject:\n\n\"I can't have your atheism in my life.\"\n\nAnd there we are. Back to Hume and Johnson and the absence of Providence. Just to be clear, I made no argument against her faith. I never attempted to persuade her to disbelief. I had not mocked her God. At the time that she decided to cease any further communication, we were not even discussing religion, or politics for that matter. She simply decided that our renewed acquaintance, and my disbelief was enough to challenge her personal equilibrium and constituted an affront to her faith. What possible answer could I make to that, even had I wanted to? And so we parted ways.\n\nLet that be a lesson to me. I have a new appreciation of Hume's delicate position. I also have a personal context for Johnson's rejection of David Hume and all his works. Finally, I have a better understanding now, as much from my recent reading of Hume & Johnson as from recent national events and the personal encounters described briefly above, of what it means to believe.\n\nIt seems it is still enough that some people disbelieve to discomfort some that do. Johnson wasn't wrong to think that reason can not answer every question, but then Hume wasn't wrong, I think, to try.\n\nBottomless Wells\n\nFame's a fickle ol' sow; as likely to eat her children as nurse them. Literature is littered with the bones of yesterday's darlings. One has only to review the bestsellers of a bygone NYT to see the once familiar names now largely lost to history. As someone who buys used books for a living, believe me, there are few sights sadder than the lovingly preserved hardcovers of, say, John O'Hara, let alone the likes of Frank Yerby. (Ah, the promise that was Grace Metalious!)\n\nThere's another twist, nearly as common and perhaps as unfair. The most familiar example is probably still A. A. Milne. Eighteen successful plays, three novels -- including an excellent if improbable thriller, The Red House Mystery, 1922 -- essays, and humour and editorial work, and now he is naught but the father of Pooh. There's an immortality that clearly wasn't all the author had in mind when he went to his desk every morning of a long literary life.\n\nAnd so to Wells. The remainder tables at the bookstore where I work are dangerous places for the poor bibliophile, and never more so than when newly populated by unforeseen British reissues, in hardcovers, attractively bound in a uniform edition and of titles otherwise obscure. Here we have four comic novels, all dating from the turn of the last century, by one of the most admired practitioners of the form, H. G. Wells. Now if that somehow doesn't sound quite right to you, dear reader, you are not wrong to think so. Nowadays Wells is still widely read, but only as the father of modern science fiction, to which he contributed a number of now classic titles: The War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, The Island of Doctor Moreau. Even his lesser efforts in this genre, however quaint they may now seem, as in The First Men in the Moon or The Sleeper Awakes, still have their ardent enthusiasts, as do a number of his more speculative short stories. One would be hard-pressed to remember more than a handful of names contemporary to Wells with so much of their published work still not only in print but so widely read, in both the original and translation.\n\nA writer like Wells, a writer who spent a good part of his adult life in not only making literature but also trouble in the world -- in the very best sense, mostly I mean -- might well be forgiven for thinking that politics and history would define their posthumous fame nearly as much as their as their efforts at fine letters. Wells certainly seemed to think so. He spent at least the last half of his life vociferously advocating for his ideal of the \"World State\", among other noble-minded socialisms, and played the sage from podium to podium for decades. (I don't mean to be flippant about what were, by and large, quite respectable and progressive ideas from a man whose financial and artistic success might as easily have allowed him to abandon the political idealism of his youth. Happens all the time. Wells however remained a committed and active reformer, and an astute critic of both the capitalist west and the socialist east all his life. True, he was unfortunately a life-long subscriber to, for example, eugenics, but that now rather unforgivable slip had, in his day, still at least the endorsement of other notables as diverse as George Bernard Shaw and Margaret Sanger. Never the less, H. G. Wells was also one of the first and few committed socialists in his day to denounce totalitarianism, left or right, and to revise his opinions according to changing circumstances rather than just ossifying, as so many did, into just another Communist dinosaur.)\n\nMuch is still made of Wells the \"futurist\" and to that I cannot speak. I haven't much interest in checking either his fictional inventions or his predictions against the historical record. Perhaps he foresaw cellular phones and the yet to be realized socialist Eden. If that was the primary reason to read Wells, I would argue that the few benighted hobbyists of scientific esoterica, and a few ageing communists would now constitute his only devotees. Such is clearly not the case.\n\nMy recent re-reading of his short novel, The Invisible Man, convinced me that what makes reading Wells such a pleasure still is less to do with his powers of speculation and prediction than with his craft as a comic novelist. It's a funny book. True, the story of a scientist hounded to madness for a mistake he can't himself correct is not without a wider resonance, both as a cautionary tale of unintended consequences and of the primitive power of the mob to destroy what, and who it cannot understand. The genius of the thing though is in the nakedness of the protagonist. Wells has the great comedian's eye for awkward repercussions of fantasy played out in a real place and time; for example, what weather can do to undo dreams of perfect liberation. (Hint: the English climate is not the nudist's friend.) It is the comic novelist who appreciates that human beings in a frightened mass are more dangerous, yes, but also funnier; slapping and kicking and accusing one another instead of their unseen foe. It's Wells the satirist who shows the even most respectable, rational sort of persons resorting to the same violent superstitions as the comic, rural rubes when threatened by the seemingly inexplicable, indeed, the invisible, and so on.\n\nIn his own day, H. G. Wells was as much a literary gent as he was an agitator or prognosticator. To really appreciate this, may I recommend the selection of his comic novels not to do Dystopian futures or alien invaders, but rather to do with the rise of advertising and the nouveau riche, with the \"New Woman\", and always, or nearly always to do with the deadly hand of the British class system?\n\nIt's worth remembering just here that Wells was a working class lad, as likely once to have ended up a draper's assistant in a shop as a anything, despite his native intelligence and talents. There was some luck in his rise, as well as genius. He had a quite healthy ego, did Wells, but he never forgot what a near thing it was, obscurity.\n\nWhich makes it such a pleasure to see some of his best comic novels so recently retrieved from said forgetfulness and reissued in these handsome British hardcovers. By the time I saw them of course they have been remaindered by some American firm or other, but even just their reissue gives me hope. More people should read these books. They're quite good.\n\nFrom the remainder table I've collected four of the best of these. I've read two before, the almost autobiographical story of ruined aspirations, The History of Mr. Polly, perhaps his greatest \"straight\" novel, and the marvelously entertaining, Tono-Bungay, a tonic comedy on the rise of the then quite new consumer-society, advertising, new money and bad, if successful ideas. The other two books, Kipps and Ann Veronica, I haven't read before, though now I've started the latter at lunch and am already enjoying it. The story of the \"new woman\", I was most dubious when I picked the book up. I had some apprehension of it proving one of those wrong-headed, anti-feminist antiques like James' unfortunate novel, The Bostonians -- an otherwise predictably beautiful book, made all but unreadable by a laughably overheated horror of the unhealthy influence of an older lesbian on a Suffragist prodigy. So far, there's none of that Victorian auntishness, nor I should think is there likely to be. Among the many lovers of that ol' dog, Herbert George Wells, were a number of brilliant and rather challenging women, including not only that intellectual and feminist powerhouse, Rebecca West, but also Margaret Sanger and the novelist Elizabeth von Arnim. No man, however much the egoist, attracted to such women could really have learned nothing from them, could he? Instead, I'm reminded of many a Shavian heroine, and not a little of Waugh's early comedies, still a couple of decades out from Wells' novel. As for Kipps, it may well have been the novelist's most popular title and was, I know, made into a popular movie some long while after. A quick peak at this one suggests Thackeray's Pendennis; another once popular novel of a largely harmless young man's coming of age. Wells version seems more straightforwardly comic, and considerably less forgiving than Thackeray's novel, though I can also already see how Kipps might have endeared himself to the reading public.\n\nHuzzah then, yet again, for all the books that can still bob back up to the surface, even after being under for more than fifty years, and even if only on our beautifully maintained bargain tables at the bookstore where I work. Now I've got two comic novels to read for the first time, by one of the masters of the form, and for less than the price of a new paperback."
