        "text": "English majors and minors at Clark epitomize the voracious Clarkie. They possess an intellectual hunger that drives them to make their Clark educational experience their own. Students progress from the simpler pleasures of reading and writing to the empowerment afforded by critical engagement with a variety of texts.\n\nThe course The Text, the World, and the Critic: Narrative and Form is required of all English majors. In addition to courses foundational to literary studies, such as Introduction to Shakespeare and Major American Writers, you can choose from innovatively conceived and cutting-edge courses that both expand conventional fields of study and practice and link those fields with other disciplines.\n\nYou also can broaden your critical perspectives through interdisciplinary seminars. Examples of such courses have included Science Fiction and the Mind of the Other (English and philosophy), In Sickness and In Health: Narrative and the Art of Healing (English and psychology), and Freedom Dreams: Global Freedom Struggles from Decolonization to the Present (English and history). You can also apply to join, for credit, an American Studies Seminar offered by Worcester’s prestigious American Antiquarian Society, a national research library of American history.\n\nIn the fall of your senior year, you’ll take part in the distinctive English capstone experience. During this semester-long, workshop-style class, you’ll develop an independent research project of your own design that will serve as a culmination of your individualized program of study. That program might take the form of a specialization within the major, or a combination of the English major with a minor, concentration, or second major. The capstone is not only an opportunity for you to demonstrate skills emphasized in the English major, but to articulate your own academic career and to look forward to your vocation after graduation.\n\nFor the most up-to-date requirements for the major, please consult the University’s current Academic Catalog.\n\nIn an effort to enhance students’ opportunities for entrance into the health professions, the Pre-health Advising Program has a special arrangement with the English Department that allows students to major in English while meeting the specific requirements of medical schools.\n\nThe department and faculty offices are located in beautiful Anderson House. Many English courses, department colloquia, and other events take place in this historic building. We invite you to read our newsletter, The English Times [PDF], to learn more.\n\nQualified students are eligible for election to Sigma Tau Delta, the National Honor Society in English."
