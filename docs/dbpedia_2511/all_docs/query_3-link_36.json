        "text": "While researching a project on the transformation of the Roman Republic and the working of its constitutional arrangements, I came to analyse the works of writers often labelled as antiquarians, who dealt with the rules and regulations of Roman institutions and their religious framework. These works were united by a family resemblance in the way they approached the past: contrary to the chronological approach of narrative history writing, they were tied to a synchronic arrangement and appeared at first sight to collect all evidence for a given phenomenon indiscriminately without explicitly evaluating its relevance to a particular problem. By adopting a philological method, they moved from the present to reconstruct the past. Their subject matters concentrated on political institutions and laws, religion, private life and customs, topography, and language. They constituted a knowledge revolution that re-shaped the Roman intellectual horizon from the second century BC onwards and was understood until the 19th Century as a distinctive âantiquarianâ moment, hence the collective name of antiquarians that we give to those writers.\n\nConsidering the enormous â almost constitutive â influence of antiquarian studies over the course of early modern and modern cultural history, it is remarkable how little attention has been paid to the nature of these works in their original context of ancient Republican Rome. One of the most authoritative scholars in the field, Arnaldo Momigliano, in his study âAncient History and the Antiquarianâ published in 1950, first established the field of antiquarian studies by referring to changes introduced by disciplinary knowledge and in relation to history. However, Momiglianoâs brilliant essay has also tended to constrain subsequent scholarship. Building on the Saussurean distinction between the synchronic and the diachronic, Momigliano advocated that ancient antiquarianism was characterised by a distinctive interest in remote changes along a synchronic axis. However, this distinction is overstated, and created too sharp a dichotomy between history and antiquarianism, setting up the historian against the antiquary. As a result, two main consequences in the investigation of different ways of recording and narrating the past followed: first, a focus on the issue of the definition of antiquarianism vis-Ã -vis history; the second a disregard of the pivotal role played by philology in the development of antiquarian studies.\n\nNot only did textual exegesis combine philology with an understanding of the history of religion, legal practices, and literary works, but also classical lexicography took precisely the form of the study of etymology. Whether investigating Roman history, language, family genealogy, jurisprudence, religious lore, or political procedure, antiquarian tools were historical research and etymology, a genealogical-reconstructive method which was substantially inductive and aimed to work back from the present to the past. By adopting a philological method, these antiquarians moved from the present to reconstruct the past, contributing directly to the formulation and establishment of the Late Roman Republican political institution and thought, which currently plays a large role not only in the field of historical studies, but also in contemporary political theory.\n\nThis project is funded by an ERC consolidator grant and based in the History Department at University College London, where I lead a team of international scholars who bring a wide breadth of knowledge and expertise, as well as a variety of approaches, to the research.\n\nWe are working to create the first systematic and comprehensive analysis of this antiquarian material, charting the dynamics of the intellectual, political, and religious spheres of the Roman Republic at the very moment of their creative mutual interdependence.\n\nStarting directly from the ancient sources, the project is gathering, editing, interpreting and translating from Latin and Greek into English all the surviving evidence about the antiquarians of the Roman Republic. One of the main scopes of this project is a scholarly understanding of the wider phenomenon of Republican antiquarianism, which so far has been dominated to an unbalancing extent by the works of Varro, the antiquarian par excellence.\n\nIt follows that this edition will include, alongside Varroâs fragmentary antiquarian works: 1) the fragments (material which is, or is preserved as if it is, the actual antiquarian works of Republican writers); 2) the testimonia (material about work, its author, its content); and 3) and all the relevant but uncertain material dependent in some way on the author in question, of all Republican antiquarians, including all authors writing from the beginning down to the break out of the civil war.\n\nThe printed edition will be accompanied by an online database.\n\nThis electronic system is not only currently enabling the collection, sharing and querying of the research data by the project team, but will later be transformed into a database for external use. These data stored in the database will also be linked with pre-existing material, thus the database will contain a higher quantity of information pertaining to issues of both content and text than the printed edition. This would benefit in particular those researchers who are not interested in Republican antiquarianism per se, but rather in related fields.\n\nThe advantages of the online database will be to provide the users with the opportunity not only to access this material in translation, but also to order it as preferred, enabling them to break free from our editorial choices and arrange the material according to their personal judgment, so to explore more widely and freely the intellectual landscape of the Republic.\n\nFront piece to a 1706 Latin edition of Attic Nights by Jakob Gronovius. Â© Public Domain.\n\nThe wider aim: understanding Roman politics, religion, construction of knowledge and self-identity\n\nBy gathering, editing, interpreting and translating the complete surviving evidence about the antiquarians of the Republic and making widely accessible a body of critically significant texts that have never been seen in their entirety, my aim is not only to broaden the purview of scholarly debates on the construction of knowledge and the political and religious culture of the Republic, but also to transform our understanding of the intellectual life of the Roman Republic and fully explore its connections with the political and religious world of the time.\n\nThese authors, who, like Varro and Cicero, were also main actors of the political and military scene of the time, were elaborating a system of knowledge that was connected to their course of public actions.\n\nAlthough they wrote down the rules concerning the institutional and religious working of the Republic in terms of continuity with the past, and validated responses to the changing needs of society on the basis of ancient precedent, this process was itself deeply innovative. In order to safeguard their special status as custodians of the past, these writers had to become âinventorsâ of the knowledge which was the foundation of power-sharing in the Republic â and this was even more important at times when the political order was under stress. It follows that by doing so, these antiquarians contributed directly to the formulation and establishment of the Roman Republican âconstitution.â Without a full understanding of the development of this scholarly tradition, it will not be possible to trace down the history of Republican âconstitutionalismâ, which currently plays such a large role in the contemporary revival of âneo-Republicanâ political theory.\n\nAlong similar lines, these scholars organised and systematised knowledge of religious matters. Part of a process of rationalisation, this writing established religion as a discourse to be analysed and critically discussed and in the process created for us an altered image of religious decay. In structuring religious knowledge, these authors presented the essence of Roman religion as built around the notion of orthopraxis, the correct practice of rites and rituals. It is only through a rigorous review of the antiquarian works that we will be able to understand better the articulations between, on the one hand, religious rituals and political institutions and, on the other, individual beliefs, whose centrality is now reclaimed in the most recent studies of Roman religion.\n\nThese writers were therefore profoundly innovative, politically engaged and culturally radical. The discovery of society through its language, and the link between the structuring of knowledge and the roots of power are profoundly modern concerns (it is sufficient to think about Foucault), and show how the world of knowledge is never neutral or objective, but rather enacted in all institutions of social encounters, and one of the engines that drives historical change. Contrary to the assumption that the antiquarians operated in a detached world of scholarly endeavours, these guardians of knowledge and traditions, as they styled themselves, were not only restorers, but also, and most of all, innovators of the world around them. In setting up their works as the object of enquiry, FRRAnt seeks to trace the ways in which these Republican Romans not only thought about their past, but also, and most importantly, constructed their present and laid the foundation for their future.\n\nOnce we acknowledge that these particular ways of âtextualising knowledgeâ were entwined with the religious and political practices as well as cultural developments of the time, these works can be recognised as much more than compilatory in form and conservative in aim. The collection and recording of their own tradition, the intensive use of what was seen as a new and productive philological methodology, the ordering and fixing of the mos maiorum (the accepted way of the ancestors) in texts, and the making of collective memories enacted as well as informed a process of Roman self-definition. With the intensification of the Roman relations with other cultures, the Romans found themselves needing to elaborate on their own identity. Imperialism required a dual process of appropriation of the other and comprehension of the self as foreigners, alongside the past, constituted an otherness that forced the Romans to learn about themselves.\n\nBy identifying and gathering all the surviving evidence for antiquarianism and demonstrating their transformative potential in the analytical components of the edition and related volumes, FRRAntâs key contribution will be to explore how these antiquarian texts are intrinsically political as their lamentations about the decline of tradition, at the origins of study of the past, ultimately encouraged criticism of the present and therefore became a form of activism. Relying on scholarly research, where grammar and etymology played a central role, Roman antiquarianism developed a powerful discourse about the past. By selecting, ordering, at times even inventing, their traditions, these texts relocated the legitimising authority of the ancestors to a remote past, providing the present with much greater freedom to innovate."
