        "text": "Reference works are the 'tools' of the Antiquarian Book Trade. Ideally, they represent years of research & scholarship which delineate an authoritative view of a given subject, be it author, genre or specific topic, such the Civil War. Bibliographies, a sub-set of reference works, provide information on the books, and other publications, that comprise an author's oeuvre, or a subject's breadth, or the works contained in whatever spectrum the bibliographer has defined.\n\nThe reference works you see listed on this ABAA site are those that are found in frequent use by the professionals in the trade. In other words, they are the 'go-to' works needed to properly identify the divers editions of books collectors seek, and are cited as the authority for stating 'such-n-so' volume is a first edition, or, for example, 'the first book published by San Francisco's Grabhorn Press'.\n\nThe bulk of professional booksellers will only cite a reference that has been personally examined, hence if you see Sabin, for example, cited in one of this site's listings, then you know that particular reference has been personally checked with respect to the book in question, and not copied from some other source [which happens more often than you might imagine in this wild-and-wooly world of internet bookselling, with many knowing naught of what they cite & whether or not the citation they use actually applies to the book to which they have applied said citation].\n\nThe genres you see listed those most encountered in any given day of our respective businesses; the specific references there-under are those found to be most encountered and/or [still] useful in that genre, as determined by our antiquarian bookseller members.\n\nHowever, it must be emphasized that these lists are nothing more than that; the 'meat', if you will, with respect to the benefits & limitations of a given reference work can only be known by actual use of that reference. The listings in the divers genres have no priority per se, and there are titles, while often cited in the trade, and so are found on the list, are limited in their true usefulness by no more than being able to say: \"Not in\".\n\nIn the list, the bolded name reflects the manner to which the reference is usually cited, e.g., Bleiler = The Checklist of Science-Fiction and Supernatural Fiction.\n\nIf one wishes to acquire some of the works listed, be aware many are available in reprints that are perfectly serviceable from a strictly textual-knowledge perspective... e.g., the Pforzheimer catalogue, when found, is usually a four-figure set in the 1940 first edition, a more affordable 3 figures in the 1997 reprint.\n\nPlease note, we try to list the most recent edition of a given reference, as it's the most up-to-date information that usually best serves in rare book cataloguing- if you're aware of a later edition of a title given on the list, please do let us know.\n\nNB. With respect to the DAB & DNB, we are aware these have been superseded by on-line versions. We list the DAB & DNB as such, for they are still cited in that manner by many booksellers.\n\nFinally, we hope you find these lists useful. But remember, they are just a beginning. We highly recommend you attend something like the Tavistock Books Reference Book workshop, or even better, the weeklong course by Joel Silver, [add hyperlink] for these lists do no more than make you aware of a given reference... to 'own' it, you need to use it & experience it.\n\nBasic Reference Books for the Antiquarian Bookseller & Collector\n\nCompiled by Vic Zoschak - Tavistock Books, ABAA\n\nI.
