        "text": "Romance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes (not Scones) And Remarkable Person(s) of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nby John Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities. Born in Clerkenwell, London, he was apprenticed at 16 to a druggist and printer, where he soon showed great literary promise. At 19, he began to write for Monthly Magazine, and a year later he was made secretary to the magazine’s proprietor and there began his career as a writer, editor, and antiquarian.\n\nThis particular book is available at googlebooks for free in ebook form. Or you can pay for a print version.\n\nI don’t remember where I heard about John Timbs, but somehow I heard that he wrote some quite intriguing stories about historical London, and purchased this book a year or so ago. After finishing my previous series on Vauxhall, I rummaged among my collection of research books and this one caught my attention. Be aware if you buy it that, like many such books, it was hastily scanned and some of the words didn’t scan correct. For instance, the title “Strange Stories, Scones And Remarkable Person of the Great Town” doesn’t make a lot of sense. Thus far, however, I have found the interior pages quite easy to read.\n\nAmong the first stories is one about a jester… and perhaps a dessert?\n\nThe Lord Mayor’s Fool\n\nThe Lord Mayor’s Fool was a distinguished character of his class; and there was a curious feat which he was bound by his office to perform, in the celebration of Lord Mayor’s Day. He was to leap, clothes and all, into a large bowl of custard, at the Inauguration dinner; and this was a jest so exactly suited to the taste of the lower class of spectators, that it was not easily made stale by repetition. It is alluded to by Shakespeare and Ben Johnson, as follows:—\n\nYou have made shift to run into ‘t, boots and spurs, and all, like him that leapt into the custard.” (All’s Well that Ends Well.)\n\nHe may, perchance, in tail of a Sheriff’s dinner,\n\nSkip with a rime o’ the table, from new nothing,\n\nAnd take his Almain leap into a custard,\n\nShall make my Lady Mayoress and her sisters\n\nLaugh all their hoods over their shoulders—Devil’s an Ass.\n\nCustard was “a food much used in City feasts.” (Johnson’s Dict.)\n\nNow mayors and shrieves all hush’d and satiate lay;\n\nYet eat, in dreams, the custard of the day.—Pope\n\nPerhaps it is this custard which, in the Staple of News, is called “the custard politick, the Mayor’s.” We have all heard the vulgar comparison—”You are like my Lord Mayor’s Fool, who knows what is good.”\n\nA Fruit Fool?\n\nSomehow, a fool jumping into a vat of custard clicked in my mind. Isn’t fool an English dessert? So I looked it up on Wikipedia, and there staring at me was this lovely creamy, custard-like raspberry fool. Yummy. Where can I find one?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, though, nobody really knows where the term came from. Hmm. Maybe Mr. John Timbs knows more than the all of the wise scholars at Wikipedia? Or am I making an incorrect assumption?\n\nFirst mentioned in 1598 along with the term trifle, its ingredients are fruit, whipped cream, and sugar. According to Wikipedia, gooseberries are the fruit of choice for a fool, but apples, rhubarb, raspberries, and strawberries are also used.\n\nIf you’d like to make one, here are some recipes:\n\nBBC Food\n\nThe Kitchn\n\nSerious Eats\n\nJoyofBaking.com\n\nJamie Oliver\n\nHave you ever had a gooseberry fool? Or any type of (dessert) fool? What in the heck is a gooseberry anyway?\n\nRomance of London Series"
