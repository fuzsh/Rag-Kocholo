Split between new periodical titles and editions that fill gaps in periodicals that exist in Parts I through VII, the multidisciplinary collection shows how history affected American citizens from all walks of life.",

        "text": "Greater Perspective and Representation: Content from unconventional, underrepresented voices provides a more complete history of the people, presenting more alternatives for filling in historical gaps and broad multidisciplinary application.\n\nSociety Cross Section: Materials present the thoughts, cultures, and societies of the American people during this time, looking through the eyes of those who lived it. The collection is ideal for multidisciplinary applications that examine America as an increasingly influential player on the global stage.\n\nIncreased Value to a Beloved Archive: This collection includes periodicals that were acquired by the American Antiquarian Society since the previous collection released. Libraries can continue growing one of the most complete records of American periodical history available.\n\nCOLLECTIONS INCLUDE\n\nAmerican Historical Review 1895–1925\n\nA joint effort between the history departments at Cornell University and Harvard University, the American Historical Review is the official publication of the American Historical Association. Published quarterly since 1895, the American Historical Review serves as the journal of record for the historical profession in the United States, bringing together scholarship from every major field of historical study.\n\nFrank Leslie’s Budget of Fun 1859–1873\n\nThis new acquisition by the American Antiquarian Society offers a fun and interesting look at nineteenth-century U.S. society, culture, and politics. Frank Leslie was an English-born American engraver, illustrator, and publisher of family periodicals who established success in New York before entering the satire field. With Frank Leslie's Budget of Fun, he introduced a well-illustrated, sixteen-page satire published monthly that, unlike many of its contemporaries, didn’t shy away from politics. The magazine, like its publisher, was sympathetic to the Democratic Party and suspicious of Lincoln and the Republican Party agenda.\n\nHistorical Society and State History Publications\n\nHistorical societies seek to preserve and promote interest in history, culture, and society. American Historical Periodicals from the American Antiquarian Society, Part VIII includes more than 54 publications and 273,000 pages of state and ethnic histories from around the United States. These publications connect us to the people, places, and events important to state and ethnic histories. Aside from history, they also offer insights for those interested in genealogical research.\n\nAmerican Fonografur 1851 (two issues)\n\nPhonographic writing provides a simple way to write and read a language, essentially by transcribing sound, using signs that represent a phonetic or phonological element with no reference to meaning. Experimentation in phonographic writing systems influenced literacy, engagement with educational activities, and understanding of language. American Fonografur is a short-lived and rare periodical published in New York, offering just one example of this fascinating writing system. There were four issues published in total, and the American Antiquarian Society acquired two of them."
