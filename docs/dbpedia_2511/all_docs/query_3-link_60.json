        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis dissertation addresses the question: how did seventeenth-century painters, antiquarians, and patrons respond to the discovery of ancient frescoes and mosaics in Rome, and what impact did these discoveries have on contemporary painting? While art historians have thoroughly examined the reception of ancient sculptures among early modern artists, the reception of ancient painting and its importance to the development of early modern art theory and practice has been less well understood, in part because relatively few examples survive. I examine how the work of one artist-antiquarian, Pietro Santi Bartoli (1635-1700), encouraged contemporary painters to incorporate the study of ancient frescoes and mosaics into their practice. Bartoli spent his career drawing ancient Roman decorations in situ and reproducing them in imaginative watercolor miniatures for important patrons such as Cardinal Camillo Massimo. I build on the work of scholars who argue that Bartoli’s watercolors were an extension of Cassiano dal Pozzo’s Paper Museum project, which functioned as a visual encyclopedia of ancient Roman artifacts. By examining Bartoli’s watercolors and preparatory drawings, Camillo Massimo’s collecting practices, and contemporary writings on ancient painting, I argue that the volumes of watercolors Bartoli created for Massimo acted as visual treatises on the history of ancient Roman painting meant to educate artists and collectors. Additionally, I consider how contemporary artists in Bartoli’s social network incorporated the study of ancient frescoes and mosaics into their work. This project advances our understanding of the role antiquarians played in saving Roman painting for posterity and in shaping artistic discourse.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbstract...............................ii\n\nAcknowledgments................iii\n\nTable of Contents.................vi\n\nList of Figures .....................vii\n\nIntroduction.........................1\n\nChapter One........................13\n\nDiscovering Antiquity at the Villa Pamphilj\n\nChapter Two.......................55\n\nWorking for Camillo Massimo\n\nChapter Three...................108\n\nArtist-Antiquarian\n\nChapter Four.....................167\n\nOut of the Grottoes and into the Palaces\n\nChapter Five.....................206\n\nBartoli’s Tombs\n\nConclusion.......................231\n\nAppendix A: Bartoli’s Drawings..............................233\n\nAppendix B: Archival Documents............................237\n\nIllustrations ....................258\n\nBibliography....................397\n\nAbout this Dissertation"
