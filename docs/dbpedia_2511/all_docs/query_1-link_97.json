        "text": "Chapter XXXII: A HISTORY OF COFFEE IN LITERATURE -- All About Coffee, by William H. Ukers\n\n<<==Prev| ==Home== | Next==>>\n\nChapter XXXII\n\nA HISTORY OF COFFEE IN LITERATURE\n\nAny study of the literature of coffee comprehends a survey of selections from the best thought of civilized nations, from the time of Rhazes (850–922) to Francis Saltus. We have seen in chapter III how Rhazes, the physician-philosopher, appears to have been the first writer to mention coffee; and was followed by other great physicians, like Bengiazlah, a contemporary, and Avicenna (980–1037).\n\nThen arose many legends about coffee, that served as inspiration for Arabian, French, Italian, and English poets.\n\nSheik Gemaleddin, mufti of Mocha, is said to have discovered the virtues of coffee about 1454, and to have promoted the use of the drink in Arabia. Knowledge of the new beverage was given to Europeans by the botanists Rauwolf and Alpini toward the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe first authentic account of the origin of coffee was written by Abd-al-Kâdir in 1587. It is the famous Arabian manuscript commending the use of coffee, preserved in the Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris, and catalogued as \"Arabe, 4590.\"\n\nIts title written in Arabic is as follows:\n\nwhich is pronounced (reading right to left):\n\nor; in the literary style: omdatu s safwati fi hallu 'l kahwati which means—literally, (the corresponding words being underlined and numbered)\n\nor, more freely, \"Argument in favor of the legitimate use of coffee.\"\n\nkahwa, is the Arabic word for coffee.\n\nThe author is Abd-al-Kâdir ibn Mohammad al Ansâri al Jazari al Hanbali. That is, he was named Abd-al-Kâdir, son of Mohammed.\n\nAbd-al-Kâdir means \"slave of the strong one\" (i.e., of God); while al Ansâri means that he was a descendant of the Ansâri (i.e., \"helpers\"), the people of Medina who received and protected the Prophet Mohammed after his flight from Mecca; al Jazari means that he was a man of Mesopotamia; and al Hanbali that in law and theology he belonged to the well known sect, or school, of the Hanbalites, so called after the great jurist and writer, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who died at Bagdad A.H. 241 (A.D. 855). The Hanbalites are one of the four great sects of the Sunni Mohammedans.\n\nAbd-al-Kâdir ibn Mohammed lived in the tenth century of the Hegira—the sixteenth of our era—and wrote his book in 996 A.H., or 1587 A.D. Coffee had then been in common use since about 1450 A.D. in Arabia. It was not in use in the time of[Pg 542] the Prophet, who died in 632 A.D.; but he had forbidden the drink of strong liquors which affect the brain, and hence it was argued that coffee, as a stimulant, was unlawful. Even today, the community of the Wahabis, very powerful in Arabia a hundred years ago, and still dominant in part of it, do not permit the use of coffee.\n\nAbd-al-Kâdir's book is thought to have been based on an earlier writing by Shihâb-ad-Dîn Ahmad ibn Abd-al-Ghafâr al Maliki, as he refers to the latter on the third page of his manuscript; but if so, this previous work does not appear to have been preserved. La Roque says Shihâb-ad-Dîn was an Arabian historian who supplied the main part of Abd-al-Kâdir's story. La Roque refers also to a Turkish historian.\n\nResearch by the author has failed to disclose anything about Shihâb-ad-Dîn save his name (al Maliki means that he belonged to the Malikites, another of the four great Sunni sects), and that he wrote about a hundred years before Abd-al-Kâdir. No copy of his writings is known to exist.\n\nThe illustrations show the title page of Abd-al-Kâdir's manuscript, the first page, the third page, and the fly leaf of the cover, the latter containing an inscription in Latin made at the time the manuscript was first received or classified. It reads:\n\nOmdat al safouat fl hall al cahuat.\n\nDe usu legitimo et licito potionis quae vulgo Café nuncupatur. Authore Abdalcader Ben Mohammed al Ansâri. Constat hic liber capitibus septem, et ab authore editus est anno hegirae 996 quo anno centum et viginti anni effluxerant ex quo huius potionis usus in Arabia felice invaluerat\n\nThe translation of the Latin is:\n\nConcerning the legitimate and lawful use of the drink commonly known as café by Abdalcader Ben Mohammed al Ansâri. The book is composed in seven chapters and was brought out by the author in the year of the Hegira 996 at which time a hundred and twenty years had passed since the use of this drink had become firmly established in Arabia Felix.\n\nCoffee in Poetry\n\nThe Abd-al-Kâdir work immortalized coffee. It is in seven chapters. The first treats of the etymology and significance of the word cahouah (kahwa), the nature and properties of the bean, where the drink was first used, and describes its virtues. The other chapters have to do largely with the church dispute in Mecca in 1511, answer the religious objectors to coffee, and conclude with a collection of Arabic verses composed during the Mecca controversy by the best poets of the time.\n\nDe Nointel, ambassador from the court of Louis XIV to the Ottoman Porte, brought back with him to Paris from Constantinople the Abd-al-Kâdir manuscript, and another by Bichivili, one of the three general treasurers of the Ottoman Empire. The latter work is of a later date than the Abd-al-Kâdir manuscript, and is concerned chiefly with the history of the introduction of coffee into Egypt, Syria, Damascus, Aleppo, and Constantinople.\n\nThe following are two of the earliest Arabic poems in praise of coffee. They are about the period of the first coffee persecution in Mecca (1511), and are typical of the best thought of the day:\n\nHere is another, rhymed version of the same poem:\n\n[Pg 543]\n\nDuring the period of the second religious persecution of coffee in the latter part of the sixteenth century, other Arabian poets sang the praises of coffee. The learned Fakr-Eddin-Aboubeckr ben Abid Iesi wrote a book entitled The Triumph of Coffee, and the poet-sheikh Sherif-Eddin-Omar-ben-Faredh sang of it in harmonious verse, wherein, discoursing of his mistress, he could find no more flattering comparison than coffee. He exclaims, \"She has made me drink, in long draughts, the fever, or, rather, the coffee of love!\"\n\nThe numerous contributions by early travelers to the literature of coffee have been mentioned in chronological order in the history chapters. After Rauwolf and Alpini, there were Sir Antony Sherley, Parry, Biddulph, Captain John Smith, Sir George Sandys, Sir Thomas Herbert, and Sir Henry Blount in England; Tavernier, Thévenot, Bernier, P. de la Roque, and Galland in France; Delia Valle in Italy; Olearius and Niebhur in Germany; Nieuhoff in Holland, and others.\n\nFrancis Bacon wrote about coffee in his Hist. Vitae et Mortis and Sylva Sylvarum, 1623–27. Burton referred to it in his \"Anatomy of Melancholy\" in 1632. Parkinson described it in his Theatrum Botanicum in 1640. In 1652, Pasqua Rosée published his famous handbill in London, a literary effort as well as a splendid first advertisement.\n\nFaustus Nairon (Banesius) produced in Rome, in 1671, the first printed treatise devoted solely to coffee. The same year Dufour brought out the first treatise in French. This he followed in 1684 with his work, The manner of making coffee, tea, and chocolate. John Ray extolled the virtues of coffee in his Universal Botany of Plants, published in London in 1686. Galland translated the Abd-al-Kâdir manuscript into French in 1699, and Jean La Roque published his Voyage de l'Arabie Heureuse in Paris in 1715. Excerpts from nearly all these works appear in various chapters of this work.\n\nLeonardus Ferdinandus Meisner published a Latin treatise on coffee, tea, and chocolate in 1721. Dr. James Douglas published in London (1727) his Arbor yemensis fructum cofè ferens, or a description and history of the Coffee Tree. This work laid under contribution many of the Italian, German, French, and English scholars mentioned above; and the author mentioned as other sources of information: Dr. Quincy, Pechey, Gaudron, de Fontenelle, Professor Boerhaave, Figueroa, Chabraeus, Sir Hans Sloane, Langius, and Du Mont.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the poets and dramatists of France, Italy, and England found a plentiful supply in what had already been written on coffee; to say nothing of the inspiration offered by the drink itself, and by the society of the cafés of the period.\n\nFrench poets, familiar with Latin, first took coffee as the subject of their verse. Vaniére sang its praises in the eighth book of his Praedium rusticum; and Fellon, a Jesuit professor of Trinity College, Lyons, wrote a didactic poem called, Faba Arabica, Carmen, which is included in the Poemata didascalica of d'Olivet.\n\nAbbé Guillaume Massieu's Carmen Caffaeum, composed in 1718, has been referred to in chapter III. It was read at the Academy of Inscriptions. One of the panegyrists of this author, de Boze, in his Elogé de Massieu, says that if Horace and Virgil had known of coffee, the poem might easily have been attributed to them; and Thery, who translated it into French, says \"it is a pearl of elegance in a rare jewel case.\"\n\n[Pg 544]\n\nThe following translation of the poem from the Latin original was made for this work:\n\nCoffee\n\nA Poem by Guillaume Massieu of the French Academy\n\n(A literal prose translation from the original Latin in the British Museum.)\n\nHow coffee first came to our shores,\n\nWhat the nature of the divine drink is, what its use,\n\nHow it brings ready aid to man against every kind of evils,\n\nI shall here begin to tell in simple verse.\n\nYou soft-spoken men, who have often tried the sweetness of this drink,\n\nIf it has never deceived your wishes or mocked your hopes\n\nWith its empty results, be propitious and lend a willing ear to our song.\n\nAnd may you, O Phoebus, kindly be present, to acknowledge\n\nAs your gift the power of herbs and healthful plants, and to\n\nDispel sad diseases from our bodies; for they say you are\n\nThe author of this blessing, and may you spread your\n\nGifts among peoples, and everywhere far and wide throughout the entire world.\n\nAcross Libya afar, and the seven mouths of the swollen Nile,\n\nWhere Asia most joyfully spreads in immense fields\n\nRich in various resources and filled with fragrant woods,\n\nA region extends. The Sabeans of old inhabited it.\n\nI believe indeed Nature, that best parent of all things,\n\nLoved this place more than all others with a tender love.\n\nHere the air of Heaven always breathes more mildly.\n\nThe sun has a gentler power; here are flowers of a different clime;\n\nAnd the earth with fertile bosom brings forth various fruits,\n\nCinnamon, casia, myrrh, and fragrant thyme.\n\nAmid the resources and gifts of this blessed land,\n\nTurned to the sun and the warm south winds,\n\nA tree spontaneously lifts itself into the upper air.\n\nGrowing nowhere else, and unknown in earlier centuries,\n\nBy no means great in size, it stretches not far its\n\nSpreading branches, nor lifts a lofty top to heaven;\n\nBut lowly, after the manner of myrtle or pliant broom,\n\nIt rises from the ground. Many a nut bends its rich branches.\n\nSmall, like a bean, dark and dull in color,\n\nMarked by a slight groove in the centre of its hull.\n\nTo transplant this growth to our own fields\n\nMany have tried, and to cultivate it with great care.\n\nIn vain; for the plant has not responded to the zeal\n\nAnd desires of the planters, and has rendered vain their long labor;\n\nBefore day the root of the tender herb has withered away.\n\nEither this has happened through fault of climate, or grudging\n\nEarth refuses to furnish fit nourishment to the foreign plant.\n\nTherefore come thou, whoever shall be possesed by a love for coffee,\n\nDo not regret having brought the healthful bean from the far\n\nRemote world of Arabia; for this is its bountiful mother country.\n\nThe soothing draught first flowed from those regions through other\n\nPeoples; thence through all Europe and Asia,\n\nand next made its way through the entire world.\n\nTherefore, what you shall know to be sufficient for your needs,\n\nDo you prepare long beforehand; let it be your care to have collected\n\nYearly a copious store, and providently fill small granaries,\n\nAs of yore the farmer, early mindful and provident of the future,\n\nCollected crops from his fields and garnered them in his barns,\n\nAnd turned his attention to the coming year.\n\nNone the less, meanwhile, must the utensils for coffee be cared for.\n\nLet not vessels suited for drinking the beverage be lacking,\n\nAnd a pot, whose narrow neck should be topped by a small cover\n\nAnd whose body should swell gradually into an oblong shape.\n\nWhen these things shall have been provided by you, let your\n\nNext care be to roast well the beans with flames, and to grind them when roasted.\n\nNor should the hammer cease to crush them with many a blow,\n\nUntil they lay aside their hardness, and when thoroughly ground,\n\nBecome fine powder; which forthwith pack either in a bag or a box made for such uses.\n\nAnd wrap it in leather, and smear it over with soft wax, lest\n\nNarrow chinks be open, or hidden channels.\n\nUnless you prevent these, by a secret path gradually small\n\nParticles and whatever of value exists, and the entire strength,\n\nWould leave, wasting into empty air.\n\n[Pg 545]There is also a hollow machine, like a small tower, which they\n\nCall a mill, in which you can bruise the useful fruit of the\n\nRoasted bean and crush it with frequent rubbing;\n\nA revolving pivot in the middle, on an easy wheel turning,\n\nTwists its metal joints on a creaking stem.\n\nThe top of the wheel, you know, is pierced with an ivory handle\n\nWhich will have to be turned by hand, through a thousand revolutions,\n\nAnd through a thousand circles it moves the pivot.\n\nWhen you put a kernel in, you will turn the handle with quick hand—\n\nNo delay—and you will wonder how the crackling kernel is\n\nWith much grinding quickly reduced to a powder.\n\nOnce only the lower compartment receives on its kindly bosom\n\nThe crushed grains, which are placed in the very depths of the box.\n\nBut why do we linger over these less important matters?\n\nGreater things call us. Then is it time to drain the sweet\n\nDraught, either under the new light of the early sun\n\nIn the morning, when an empty stomach demands food;\n\nOr, when, after the splendid feasts of a magnificent table\n\nThe overburdened stomach suffers from too heavy load, and\n\nUnequal to the demands made upon it, seeks the aid of external heat.\n\nThen come, when now the pot grows ruddy in the fire\n\nCrackling beneath, and you shall behold the liquid, swelling\n\nWith mingled powdered coffee, now bubble around the brim,\n\nDraw it from the fire. Unless you should do this, the force of\n\nThe water would break forth suddenly, overflowing, and would\n\nSprinkle the beverage on the fire beneath.\n\nTherefore, let no such accident disturb your joys.\n\nYou should keep watch carefully when the water no longer\n\nRestrains itself and bubbles with the heat; then return\n\nThe pot to the fire thrice and four times, until the powdered\n\nCoffee steams in the midst of the fire and blends thoroughly with the surrounding water.\n\nThis soothing drink ought to be boiled with skill, to be drunk\n\nWith art—not in the way men are wont to drink other beverages—\n\nAnd with reason; for when you shall have taken it steaming from\n\nA quick fire, and gradually all the dregs have settled to the\n\nVery bottom, you shall not drink it impatiently at one gulp.\n\nBut rather, sip it little by little, and between draughts\n\nContrive pleasant delays; and sipping, drain it in long draughts,\n\nSo long as it is still hot and burns the palate.\n\nFor then it is better, then it permeates our inmost bones, and\n\nPenetrating within to the center of our vitals and our marrow,\n\nIt pervades all our body with its vivifying strength.\n\nOften even merely inhaling the odor with their nostrils, men\n\nHave welcomed it, when it has bubbled up from the bottom,\n\nMore refreshing than the breeze. So much pleasure is there in a delicious odor.\n\nAnd now there remains awaiting us the other part of our task,\n\nTo make known the secret strength of the divine draught.\n\nBut who could hope to understand this wonderful blessing\n\nOr to be able to pursue so great a miracle in verse?\n\nFor really, when coffee has quietly glided into your body,\n\nTaking itself within, it sheds a vital warmth through your\n\nLimbs, and inspires joyous strength in your heart. Then if\n\nThere is anything undigested, with fire's help, it heats the\n\nHidden channels, and loosens the thin pores, through which the\n\nUseless moisture exudes, and seeds of diseases flee from all your veins.\n\nWherefore come, O you who have a care for your health!\n\nYou, whose triple chin hangs on your breast,\n\nWho drag your heavy stomach of great bulk,\n\nIt is fitting for you, first of all, to indulge in the warm\n\nBeverage; for indeed it will dry the hideous flow of moisture\n\nWhich oppresses your limbs, and sends forth streams of perspiration from your whole body.\n\nAnd in a short time, the swelling of your fat belly will\n\nGradually begin to decrease, and it will lighten your members, now oppressed by their heavy weight.\n\nO happy peoples, on whom Titan, rising, looks with his first light!\n\nHere, a rather free use of wine has never done harm.\n\nLaw and religion forbid us to quaff the flowing wine.\n\nHere one lives on coffee. Here, then, flourishing with joyous strength\n\nOne pursues life and knows not what diseases are,\n\nNor that child of Bacchus and companion of high living—Gout;\n\nNor what innumerable diseases through this union are ready to attack our world.\n\nYet, indeed, the soothing power of this invigorating drink\n\n[Pg 546]Drives sad cares from the heart, and exhilarates the spirits.\n\nI have seen a man, when he had not yet drained a mighty\n\nDraught of this sweet nectar, walk silently with slow gait,\n\nHis brow sad, and forehead rough with forbidding wrinkles.\n\nThis same man who had hardly bathed his throat with the sweet\n\nDrink—no delay—clouds fled from his wrinkled brow; and\n\nHe took pleasure in teasing all with his witty sayings.\n\nNor yet did he pursue any one with bitter laughter. For this\n\nHarmless drink inspires no desire of offending, the venom\n\nIs lacking, and pleasant laughter without bitterness pleases.\n\nAnd in the entire East this custom of coffee drinking\n\nHas been accepted. And, now, France; you adopt the foreign custom,\n\nSo that public shops, one after the other, are opened for\n\nDrinking Coffee. A hanging sign of either ivy or laurel invites the passers-by.\n\nHither in crowds from the entire city they assemble, and\n\nWhile away the time in pleasant drinking.\n\nAnd when once the feelings have grown warm, acted upon by\n\nThe gentle heat, then good-humored laughter, and pleasant\n\nArguments increase. General gaiety ensues,\n\nthe places about resound with joyous applause.\n\nBut never does the liquid imbibed overpower weary minds, but\n\nRather, if ever slumber presses their heavy eyes and dulls\n\nThe brain; and their strength, blunted, grows torpid in the\n\nBody, coffee puts sleep to flight from the eyes, and slothful inactivity from the whole frame.\n\nTherefore to absorb the sweet draught would be an advantage\n\nFor those whom a great deal of long-continued labor awaits\n\nAnd those who need to extend their study far into the night.\n\nAnd here I shall make known who taught the use of this pleasant\n\nDrink; for its virtue, unknown, has lain hidden through many\n\nYears; and reviewing, I shall relate the matter from the very beginning.\n\nAn Arab shepherd was driving his young goats to the well-known\n\nPastures. They were wandering through lonely wastes and cropping\n\nThe grasses, when a tree heavy with many berries—never seen before—met their eyes.\n\nAt once, as they were able to reach the low branches, they began\n\nTo pull off the leaves with many a nibble, and to pluck the tender\n\nGrowth. Its bitterness attracts. The shepherd, not knowing this,\n\nWas meanwhile singing on the soft grass and telling the story of his loves to the woods.\n\nBut when the evening star, rising, warned him to leave the field,\n\nAnd he led back his well-fed flock to their stalls, he perceived\n\nThat the beasts did not close their eyes in sweet sleep, but\n\nJoyous beyond their wont, with wonderful delight throughout the\n\nWhole night jumped about with wanton leaps. Trembling with sudden\n\nFear, the shepherd stood amazed; and crazed by the sound, he\n\nThought these things were being done through some wicked trick of a neighbor, or by magic art.\n\nNot far from here a holy band of brethren had built their\n\nHumble home in a remote valley; their lot it was to chant\n\nPraises of God, and to load his altars with fitting gifts.\n\nAlthough throughout the night the deep-toned bell resounded\n\nWith great din, and summoned them to the sacred temple, often\n\nThe coming of dawn found them lingering on their couches,\n\nHaving forgotten to rise in the middle of the night.\n\nSo great was their love of sleep!\n\nIn charge of the sacred temple, revered and obeyed by his\n\nWilling brethren, was the master, an aged man, a heavy mass of white hair on head and chin.\n\nThe shepherd, hastening, came to him and told him the story,\n\nImploring his aid. The old man smiled to himself; but\n\nHe agreed to go, and investigate the hidden cause of the miracle.\n\nWhen he has come to the hills, he observes the lambs, together\n\nWith their mothers, gnawing the berries of an unknown plant,\n\nAnd cries, \"This is the cause of the trouble!\" And saying no\n\nMore, he at once picks the smooth fruit from the heavily-laden\n\nTree, and carries it home, places it, when washed, in pure\n\nWater, cooking it over the fire, and fearlessly drinks a large\n\nCup of it. Forthwith a warmth pervades his veins, a living\n\nForce is diffused through his limbs, and weariness is dispelled from his aged body.\n\nThen, at length, the old man exulting in the blessing thus found,\n\nRejoices, and kindly shares with all his brothers. They eagerly\n\n[Pg 547]At early night-fall, indulge in pleasant banquets and drain great bowls.\n\nNo longer is it hard for them to break off sweet sleep and to leave their soft beds as formerly.\n\nO fortunate ones! whose hearts the sweet draught has often\n\nBathed. No sluggish torpor holds their minds, they briskly\n\nRise for their prescribed duties and rejoice to outstrip the rays of the first light.\n\nYou also, whose care it is to feed minds with divine eloquence\n\nAnd to terrify with your words the souls of the guilty, you also\n\nShould indulge in the pleasant drink; for, as you know, it\n\nStrengthens weakness. Keen vigor is gained for the limbs from\n\nThis source, and spreads through the whole body. From this source,\n\nToo, shall come new strength and new power to your voice.\n\nYou also, whom oft harmful vapors harass, whose sick brain the dangerous vertigo shakes,\n\nAh, come! In this sweet liquid is a ready medicine\n\nAnd none other better to calm undue agitation.\n\nApollo planted this power for himself, they say,\n\nThe story is worthy to be sung.\n\nOnce a disease most deadly to life assailed the disciples of\n\nApollo's Mount. It spread far and wide, and attacked the brain itself.\n\nAlready all the people of genius were suffering with this\n\nDisease; and the arts, deserted, were languishing along with\n\nThe workers. Some even pretended to have the disease, and\n\nAssuming feigned suffering, gave themselves over to an idle life.\n\nUnpleasing work grew distasteful, and deadly inertia increased\n\nEverywhere. It pleased all, now released from work and labors,\n\nTo indulge in care-free quiet.\n\nApollo, full of indignation, did not endure longer that the deadly\n\nContagion of such easy ruin should creep over them thus. And,\n\nThat he might take away from seers all means of deception, he\n\nEnticed from the rich bosom of the earth this friendly plant,\n\nThan which no other is more ready either to refresh for work the\n\nMind wearied by long studies, or to sooth troublesome sorrows of the head.\n\nO plant, given to the human race by the gift of the Gods!\n\nNo other out of the entire list of plants has ever vied with you.\n\nOn your account sailors sail from our shores\n\nAnd fearlessly conquer the threatening winds, sandbanks and\n\nDreadful rocks. With your nourishing growth you surpass dittany,\n\nAmbrosia, and fragrant panacea. Grim diseases flee from you. To\n\nYou trusting health clings as a companion, and also the merry\n\nCrowd, conversation, amusing jokes, and sweet whisperings.\n\nThe poet Belighi toward the close of the sixteenth century composed a poem, which, freely translated, runs:\n\nIn Damascus, in Aleppo, in great Cairo,\n\nAt every turn is to be found\n\nThat mild fruit which gives so beloved a drink,\n\nBefore coming to court to triumph.\n\nThere this seditious disturber of the world,\n\nHas, by its unparalleled virtue,\n\nSupplanted all wines from this blessed day.\n\nJacques Delille (1738–1813) the didactic poet of nature, in chant vi of his \"Three Reigns of Nature,\" thus apostrophizes the \"divine nectar\" and describes its preparation:\n\nDivine Coffee\n\nTranslation from the French\n\nA liquid there is to the poet most dear,\n\n'T was lacking to Virgil, adored by Voltaire,\n\n'T is thou, divine coffee, for thine is the art,\n\nWithout turning the head yet to gladden the heart.\n\nAnd thus though my palate be dulled by age,\n\nWith joy I partake of thy dear beverage.\n\nHow glad I prepare me thy nectar most precious,\n\nNo soul shall usurp me a rite so delicious;\n\nOn the ambient flame when the black charcoal burns,\n\nThe gold of thy bean to rare ebony turns,\n\nI alone, 'gainst the cone, wrought with fierce iron teeth.\n\nMake thy fruitage cry out with its bitter-sweet breath;\n\nTill charmed with such perfume, with care I entrust\n\nTo the pot on my hearth the rare spice-laden dust:\n\nFirst to calm, then excite, till it seethingly whirls,\n\nWith an eye all attention I gaze till it boils.\n\nAt last now the liquid comes slow to repose;\n\nIn the hot, smoking vessel its wealth I depose,\n\nMy cup and thy nectar; from wild reeds expressed,\n\nAmerica's honey my table has blest;\n\nAll is ready; Japan's gay enamel invites—\n\nAnd the tribute of two worlds thy prestige unites:\n\nCome, Nectar divine, inspire thou me,\n\nI wish but Antigone, dessert and thee;\n\nFor scarce have I tasted thy odorous steam,\n\nWhen quick from thy clime, soothing warmths round me stream,\n\nAttentive my thoughts rise and flow light as air,\n\nAwaking my senses and soothing my care.\n\nIdeas that but late moved so dull and depressed,\n\nBehold, they come smiling in rich garments dressed!\n\nSome genius awakes me, my course is begun;\n\nFor I drink with each drop a bright ray of the sun.\n\n[Pg 548]\n\nMaumenet addressed to Galland the following verses:\n\nIf slumber, friend, too near, with some late glass should creep—\n\nDull, poppy-perfumed sleep—\n\nIf a too fumous wine confounds at length thy brain—\n\nTake coffee then—this juice divine\n\nShall banish sleep and steam of vap'rous wine,\n\nAnd with its timely aid fresh vigor thou shalt find.\n\nCastel, in his poem, Les Plantes (The Plants) could not omit the coffee trees of the tropics. He thus addressed them in 1811:\n\nBright plants, the favorites of Phoebus,\n\nIn these climes the rarest virtues offer,\n\nDelicious Mocha, thy sap, enchantress,\n\nAwakens genius, outvalues Parnasse!\n\nIn a collection of the Songs of Brittany in the Brest library there are many stanzas in praise of coffee. A Breton poet has composed a little piece of ninety-six verses in which he describes the powerful attraction that coffee has for women and the possible effects on domestic happiness. The first time that coffee was used in Brittany, says an old song of that country, only the nobility drank it, and now all the common people are using it, yet the greater part of them have not even bread.\n\nA French poet of the eighteenth century produced the following:\n\nLines on Coffee\n\nTranslation from the French\n\nGood coffee is more than a savory cup,\n\nIts aroma has power to dry liquor up.\n\nBy coffee you get upon leaving the table\n\nA mind full of wisdom, thoughts lucid, nerves stable;\n\nAnd odd tho' it be, 't is none the less true,\n\nCoffee's aid to digestion permits dining anew.\n\nAnd what 's very true, tho' few people know it,\n\nFine coffee 's the basis of every fine poet;\n\nFor many a writer as windy as Boreas\n\nHas been vastly improved by the drink ever glorious.\n\nCoffee brightens the dullness of heavy philosophy,\n\nAnd opens the science of mighty geometry.\n\nOur law-makers, too, when the nectar imbibing,\n\nPlan wondrous reforms, quite beyond the describing;\n\nThe odor of coffee they delight in inhaling,\n\nAnd promise the country to alter laws ailing.\n\nFrom the brow of the scholar coffee chases the wrinkles,\n\nAnd mirth in his eyes like a firefly twinkles;\n\nAnd he, who before was but a hack of old Homer,\n\nBecomes an original, and that 's no misnomer.\n\nObserve the astronomer who 's straining his eyes\n\nIn watching the planets which soar thro' the skies;\n\nAlas, all those bright bodies seem hopelessly far\n\nTill coffee discloses his own guiding star.\n\nBut greatest of wonders that coffee effects\n\nIs to aid the news-editor as he little expects;\n\nCoffee whispers the secrets of hidden diplomacy,\n\nHints rumors of wars and of scandals so racy.\n\nInspiration by coffee must be nigh unto magic,\n\nFor it conjures up facts that are certainly tragic;\n\nAnd for a few pennies, coffee's small price per cup,\n\n\"Ye editor's\" able to swallow the Universe up.\n\nEsménard celebrated Captain de Clieu's romantic voyage to Martinique with the coffee plants from the Jardin des Plantes, in some admirable verses quoted in chapter II.\n\nAmong other notable poetic flights in praise of coffee produced in France mention should be made of: \"L'Elogé du Café\" (Eulogy of Coffee) a song in twenty-four couplets, Paris, Jacques Estienne, 1711; Le Café (Coffee), a fragment from the fourth chant (song) of La Grandeur de Dieu dans les merveilles de la Nature (The Grandeur of God in the Wonders of Nature) Marseilles; Le Café, extract from the fourth gastronomic song, by Berchoux; \"A Mon Café\" (To My Coffee), stanzas written by Ducis; Le Café, anonymous stanzas inserted in the Macedoine Poetique, 1824; a poem in Latin in the Abbé Olivier's collection; Le Bouquet Blanc et le Bouquet Noir, poesie en quatre chants; Le Café, C.D. Mery, 1837; Elogé du Café, S. Melaye, 1852.\n\nMany Italian poets have sung the praises of coffee. L. Barotti wrote his poem, Il Caffè in 1681. Giuseppe Parini (1729–1799), Italy's great satirical and lyric poet and critic of the eighteenth century, in Il Giorno (The Day), gives a delightful pen picture of the manners and customs of Milan's polite society of the period. William Dean Howells quotes as follows from these poems (his own translation) in his Modern Italian Poets. The feast is over, and the lady signals to the cavalier that it is time to leave the table:\n\nSpring to thy feet\n\nThe first of all, and, drawing near thy lady,\n\nRemove her chair and offer her thy hand,\n\n[Pg 549]And lead her to the other room, nor suffer longer\n\nThat the stale reek of viands shall offend\n\nHer delicate sense. Thee with the rest invites\n\nThe grateful odor of the coffee, where\n\nIt smokes upon a smaller table hid\n\nAnd graced with Indian webs. The redolent gums\n\nThat meanwhile burn, sweeten and purify\n\nThe heavy atmosphere, and banish thence\n\nAll lingering traces of the feast. Ye sick\n\nAnd poor, whom misery or whom hope, perchance!\n\nHas guided in the noonday to these doors.\n\nTumultuous, naked, and unsightly throng,\n\nWith mutilated limbs and squalid faces,\n\nIn litters and on crutches from afar\n\nComfort yourselves, and with expanded nostrils\n\nDrink in the nectar of the feast divine\n\nThat favourable zephyrs waft to you;\n\nBut do not dare besiege these noble precincts,\n\nImportunately offering her that reigns\n\nWithin your loathsome spectacle of woe!\n\nAnd now, sir, 't is your office to prepare\n\nThe tiny cup that then shall minister,\n\nSlow sipped, its liquor to thy lady's lips;\n\nAnd now bethink thee whether she prefer\n\nThe boiling beverage much or little tempered\n\nWith sweet; or if, perchance, she likes it best,\n\nAs doth the barbarous spouse, then when she sits\n\nUpon brocades of Persia, with light fingers,\n\nThe bearded visage of her lord caressing.\n\nThis is from Il Mezzogiorno (Noon). The other three poems, rounding out The Day, are Il Mattino (Morning), Il Vespre (Evening), and La Notte (Night). In Il Mattino, Parini sings:\n\nShould dreary hypochondria's woes oppress thee,\n\nShould round thy charming limbs in too great measure\n\nThy flesh increase, then with thy lips do honor\n\nTo that clear beverage, made from the well-bronzed,\n\nThe smoking, ardent beans Aleppo sends thee,\n\nAnd distant Mocha too, a thousand ship-loads;\n\nWhen slowly sipped it knows no rival.\n\nBelli's Il Caffè supplies a partial bibliography of the Italian literature on coffee. There are many poems, some of them put to music. As late as 1921, there were published in Bologna some advertising verses on coffee by G.B. Zecchini with music by Cesare Cantino.\n\nPope Leo XIII, in his Horatian poem on Frugality composed in his eighty-eighth year, thus verses his appreciation of coffee:\n\nLast comes the beverage of the Orient shore,\n\nMocha, far off, the fragrant berries bore.\n\nTaste the dark fluid with a dainty lip,\n\nDigestion waits on pleasure as you sip.\n\nPeter Altenberg, a Vienna poet, thus celebrated the cafés of his native city:\n\nTo The Coffee House!\n\nWhen you are worried, have trouble of one sort or another—to the coffee house!\n\nWhen she did not keep her appointment, for one reason or other—to the coffee house!\n\nWhen your shoes are torn and dilapidated—coffee house!\n\nWhen your income is four hundred crowns and you spend five hundred—coffee house!\n\nYou are a chair warmer in some office, while your ambition led you to seek professional honors—coffee house!\n\nYou could not find a mate to suit you—coffee house!\n\nYou feel like committing suicide—coffee house!\n\nYou hate and despise human beings, and at the same time you can not be happy without them—coffee house!\n\nYou compose a poem which you can not inflict upon friends you meet in the street—coffee house!\n\nWhen your coal scuttle is empty, and your gas ration exhausted—coffee house!\n\nWhen you need money for cigarettes, you touch the head waiter in the—coffee house!\n\nWhen you are locked out and haven't the money to pay for unlocking the house door—coffee house!\n\nWhen you acquire a new flame, and intend provoking the old one, you take the new one to the old one's—coffee house!\n\nWhen you feel like hiding you dive into a—coffee house!\n\nWhen you want to be seen in a new suit—coffee house!\n\nWhen you can not get anything on trust anywhere else—coffee house!\n\nEnglish poets from Milton to Keats celebrated coffee. Milton (1608–1674) in his Comus thus acclaimed the beverage:\n\nOne sip of this\n\nWill bathe the drooping spirits in delight\n\nBeyond the bliss of dreams.\n\nAlexander Pope, poet and satirist (1688–1744), has the oft-quoted lines:\n\nCoffee which makes the politician wise,\n\nAnd see through all things with his half-shut eyes.\n\nIn Carruthers' Life of Pope, we read that this poet inhaled the steam of coffee in order to obtain relief from the headaches to which he was subject. We can well understand the inspiration which called forth from him the following lines when he was not yet twenty:\n\nAs long as Mocha's happy tree shall grow,\n\nWhile berries crackle, or while mills shall go;\n\nWhile smoking streams from silver spouts shall glide,\n\nOr China's earth receive the sable tide,\n\nWhile coffee shall to British nymphs be dear,\n\nWhile fragrant steams the bended head shall cheer,\n\nOr grateful bitters shall delight the taste,\n\nSo long her honors, name and praise shall last.\n\n[Pg 550]\n\nPope's famous Rape of the Lock grew out of coffee-house gossip. The poem contains the passage on coffee already quoted:\n\nFor lo! the board with cups and spoons is crowned;\n\nThe berries crackle and the mill turns round;\n\nOn shining altars of Japan they raise\n\nThe silver lamp: the fiery spirits blaze:\n\nFrom silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,\n\nWhile China's earth receives the smoking tide.\n\nAt once they gratify their scent and taste.\n\nAnd frequent cups prolong the rich repast\n\nStraight hover round the fair her airy band;\n\nSome, as she sipped, the fuming liquor fanned:\n\nSome o'er her lap their careful plumes displayed,\n\nTrembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.\n\nCoffee (which makes the politician wise,\n\nAnd see through all things with his half-shut eyes.)\n\nSent up in vapors to the baron's brain\n\nNew stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.\n\nPope often broke the slumbers of his servant at night by calling him to prepare a cup of coffee; but for regular serving, it was his custom to grind and to prepare it upon the table.\n\nWilliam Cowper's fine tribute to \"the cups that cheer but not inebriate\", a phrase which he is said to have borrowed from Bishop Berkeley, was addressed to tea and not to coffee, to which it has not infrequently been wrongfully attributed. It is one of the most pleasing pictures in The Task.\n\nCowper refers to coffee but once in his writings. In his Pity for Poor Africans he expresses himself as \"shocked at the ignorance of slaves\":\n\nI pity them greatly, but I must be mum\n\nFor how could we do without sugar and rum?\n\nEspecially sugar, so needful we see;\n\nWhat! Give up our desserts, our coffee and tea?\n\nthus contenting himself, like many others, with words of pity where more active protest might sacrifice his personal ease and comfort.\n\nLeigh Hunt (1784–1859), and John Keats (1795–1834), were worshippers at the shrine of coffee; while Charles Lamb, famous poet, essayist, humorist, and critic, has celebrated in verse the exploit of Captain de Clieu in the following delightful verses:\n\nThe Coffee Slips\n\nWhene'er I fragrant coffee drink,\n\nI on the generous Frenchman think,\n\nWhose noble perseverance bore\n\nThe tree to Martinico's shore.\n\nWhile yet her colony was new,\n\nHer island products but a few;\n\nTwo shoots from off a coffee tree\n\nHe carried with him o'er the sea.\n\nEach little tender coffee slip\n\nHe waters daily in the ship.\n\nAnd as he tends his embryo trees.\n\nFeels he is raising 'midst the seas\n\nCoffee groves, whose ample shade\n\nShall screen the dark Creolian maid.\n\nBut soon, alas! His darling pleasure\n\nIn watching this his precious treasure\n\nIs like to fade—for water fails\n\nOn board the ship in which he sails.\n\nNow all the reservoirs are shut.\n\nThe crew on short allowance put;\n\nSo small a drop is each man's share.\n\nFew leavings you may think there are\n\nTo water these poor coffee plants—\n\nBut he supplies their grasping wants,\n\nEven from his own dry parched lips\n\nHe spares it for his coffee slips.\n\nWater he gives his nurslings first,\n\nEre he allays his own deep thirst,\n\nLest, if he first the water sip,\n\nHe bear too far his eager lip.\n\nHe sees them droop for want of more;\n\nYet when they reach the destined shore,\n\nWith pride the heroic gardener sees\n\nA living sap still in his trees.\n\nThe islanders his praise resound;\n\nCoffee plantations rise around;\n\nAnd Martinico loads her ships\n\nWith produce from those dear-saved slips.\n\nIn John Keats' amusing fantasy, Cap and Bells, the Emperor Elfinan greets Hum, the great soothsayer, and offers him refreshment:\n\n\"You may have sherry in silver, hock in gold, or glass'd champagne\n\n... what cup will you drain?\"\n\n\"Commander of the Faithful!\" answered Hum,\n\n\"In preference to these, I'll merely taste\n\nA thimble-full of old Jamaica rum.\"\n\n\"A simple boon,\" said Elfinan; \"thou mayst\n\nHave Nantz, with which my morning coffee's laced.\"\n\nBut Hum accepts the glass of Nantz, without the coffee, \"made racy with the third part of the least drop of crème de citron, crystal clear.\"\n\nNumerous broadsides printed in London, 1660 to 1675, have been referred to in chapter X. Few of them possess real literary merit.\n\n\"Coffee and Crumpets\" has been much quoted. It was published in Fraser's Magazine, in 1837. Its author calls himself \"Launcelot Littledo\". The poem is quite long, and only those portions are printed[Pg 551] here that refer particularly to \"Yemen's fragrant berry\":\n\nCoffee and Crumpets\n\nBy Launcelot Littledo of Pump Court, Temple, Barrister-at-law.\n\nThere's ten o'clock! From Hampstead to the Tower\n\nThe bells are chanting forth a lusty carol;\n\nWrangling, with iron tongues, about the hour,\n\nLike fifty drunken fishwives at a quarrel;\n\nCautious policemen shun the coming shower;\n\nThompson and Fearon tap another barrel;\n\n\"Dissolve frigus, lignum super foco.\n\nLarge reponens.\" Now, come Orinoco!\n\nTo puff away an hour, and drink a cup,\n\nA brimming breakfast-cup of ruddy Mocha—\n\nClear, luscious, dark, like eyes that lighten up\n\nThe raven hair, fair cheek, and bella boca\n\nOf Florence maidens. I can never sup\n\nOf perigourd, but (guai a chi la tocca!)\n\nI'm doomed to indigestion. So to settle\n\nThis strife eternal,—Betty, bring the kettle!\n\nCoffee! oh, Coffee! Faith, it is surprising.\n\n'Mid all the poets, good, and bad, and worse.\n\nWho've scribbled (Hock or Chian eulogizing)\n\nPost and papyrus with \"Immortal verse\"—\n\nMelodiously similitudinising\n\nIn Sapphics languid or Alcaics terse\n\nNo one, my little brown Arabian berry,.\n\nHath sung thy praises—'tis surprising! very!\n\nWere I a poet now, whose ready rhymes.\n\nLike Tommy Moore's, came tripping to their places—\n\nReeling along a merry troll of chimes,\n\nWith careless truth,—a dance of fuddled Graces;\n\nHear it—Gazette, Post, Herald, Standard, Times,\n\nI'd write an epic! Coffee for its basis;\n\nSweet as e'er warbled forth from cockney throttles\n\nSince Bob Montgomery's or Amos Cottle's.\n\nThou sleepy-eyed Chinese—enticing siren,\n\nPekoe! the Muse hath said in praise of thee,\n\n\"That cheers but not inebriates\"; and Byron\n\nHath called thy sister \"Queen of Tears\", Bohea!\n\nAnd he, Anacreon of Rome's age of iron,\n\nSays, how untruly \"Quis non potius te.\"\n\nWhile coffee, thou—bill-plastered gables say,\n\nArt like old Cupid, \"roasted every day.\"\n\nI love, upon a rainy night, as this is,\n\nWhen rarely and more rare the coaches rattle\n\nFrom street to street, to sip thy fragrant kisses;\n\nWhile from the Strand remote some drunken battle\n\nFar-faintly echoes, and the kettle hisses\n\nUpon the glowing hob. No tittle-tattle\n\nTo make a single thought of mine an alien\n\nFrom thee, my coffee-pot, my fount Castalian.\n\nThe many intervening verses cover an unhappy termination to an otherwise delightful ball. He is sitting with his charming \"Mary\", about to ask her to be his bride, when the unfortunate overturning of a glass of red wine into her white satin gown, at the same time overthrows all his dreams of bliss, \"for the shrew displaces the angel he adored\", and he resigns himself to the life of \"a man in chambers.\"\n\n'Tis thus I sit and sip, and sip and think.\n\nAnd think and sip again, and dip in Fraser,\n\nA health, King Oliver! to thee I drink:\n\nLong may the public have thee to amaze her.\n\nLike Figaro, thou makest one's eyelids wink,\n\nTwirling on practised palm thy polished razor—\n\nTrue Horace temper, smoothed on attic strop;\n\nAh! thou couldst \"faire la barbe a tout l'Europe.\"\n\n***\n\nCome, Oliver, and tell us what the news is;\n\nAn easy chair awaits thee—come and fill 't.\n\nCome, I invoke thee, as they do the muses,\n\nAnd thou shalt choose thy tipple as thou wilt.\n\nAnd if thy lips my sober cup refuses,\n\nFor ruddier drops the purple grape has spilt,\n\nWe can sing, sipping in alternate verses,\n\nThy drink and mine, like Corydon and Thyrsis.\n\n***\n\nFill the bowl, but not with wine.\n\nPotent port, or fiery sherry;\n\nFor this milder cup of mine\n\nCrush me Yemen's fragrant berry.\n\n***\n\nGentle is the grape's deep cluster,\n\nBut the wine's a wayward child;\n\nNectar this! of meeker lustre—\n\nThis the cup that \"draws it mild.\"\n\nDeeply drink its streams divine—\n\nFill the cup, but not with wine.\n\nPrior and Montague inserted the following poetic vignette in their City Mouse and Country Mouse, written in burlesque of Dryden's Hind and Panther:\n\nThen on they jogg'd; and since an hour of talk\n\nMight cut a banter on the tedious walk,\n\nAs I remember, said the sober mouse,\n\nI've heard much talk of the Wits' Coffee-house;\n\nThither, says Brindle, thou shalt go and see\n\nPriests supping coffee, sparks and poets tea;\n\nHere rugged frieze, there quality well drest,\n\nThese baffling the grand Senior, those the Test,\n\nAnd there shrewd guesses made, and reasons given,\n\nThat human laws were never made in heaven;\n\nBut, above all, what shall oblige thy sight,\n\nAnd fill thy eyeballs with a vast delight,\n\nIs the poetic judge of sacred wit,\n\nWho does i' th' darkness of his glory sit;\n\nAnd as the moon who first receives the light,\n\nWith which she makes these nether regions bright,\n\nSo does he shine, reflecting from afar\n\nThe rays he borrowed from a better star;\n\nFor rules, which from Corneille and Rapin flow,\n\nAdmired by all the scribbling herd below,\n\nFrom French tradition while he does dispense\n\nUnerring truths, 't is schism, a damned offense,\n\nTo question his, or trust your private sense.\n\n[Pg 552]\n\nGeoffrey Sephton, an English poet and novelist, many years resident in Vienna, whose fantastic stories and fairy tales are well known in Europe, has written the following sonnets on coffee:\n\nTo the Mighty Monarch, King Kauhee[350]\n\nBy Geoffrey Sephton\n\nI\n\nAway with opiates! Tantalising snares\n\nTo dull the brain with phantoms that are not.\n\nLet no such drugs the subtle senses rot\n\nWith visions stealing softly unawares\n\nInto the chambers of the soul. Nightmares\n\nRide in their wake, the spirits to besot.\n\nSeek surer means, to banish haunting cares:\n\nPlace on the board the steaming Coffee-pot!\n\nO'er luscious fruit, dessert and sparkling flask,\n\nLet proudly rule as King the Great Kauhee,\n\nFor he gives joy divine to all that ask,\n\nTogether with his spouse, sweet Eau de Vie\n\nOh, let us 'neath his sovran pleasure bask.\n\nCome, raise the fragrant cup and bend the knee!\n\nII\n\nO great Kauhee, thou democratic Lord,\n\nBorn 'neath the tropic sun and bronzed to splendour\n\nIn lands of Wealth and Wisdom, who can render\n\nSuch service to the wandering Human Horde\n\nAs thou at every proud or humble board?\n\nBeside the honest workman's homely fender,\n\n'Mid dainty dames and damsels sweetly tender,\n\nIn china, gold and silver, have we poured\n\nThy praise and sweetness, Oriental King.\n\nOh, how we love to hear the kettle sing\n\nIn joy at thy approach, embodying\n\nThe bitter, sweet and creamy sides of life;\n\nFriend of the People, Enemy of Strife,\n\nSons of the Earth have born thee labouring.\n\nIn America, too, poets have sung in praise of coffee. The somewhat doubtful \"kind that mother used to make\" is celebrated in James Whitcomb Riley's classic poem:\n\nLike His Mother Used To Make[351]\n\n\"Uncle Jake's Place,\" St. Jo., Mo., 1874.\n\n\"I was born in Indiany,\" says a stranger, lank and slim,\n\nAs us fellers in the restaurant was kindo' guyin' him,\n\nAnd Uncle Jake was slidin' him another punkin pie\n\nAnd a' extry cup o' coffee, with a twinkle in his eye—\n\n\"I was born in Indiany—more'n forty years ago—\n\nAnd I hain't ben back in twenty—and I'm work-in' back'ards slow;\n\nBut I've et in ever' restarunt twixt here and Santy Fee,\n\nAnd I want to state this coffee tastes like gittin' home, to me!\"\n\n\"Pour us out another. Daddy,\" says the feller, warmin' up,\n\nA-speakin' crost a saucerful, as Uncle tuk his cup—\n\n\"When I see yer sign out yander,\" he went on, to Uncle Jake—\n\n\"'Come in and git some coffee like yer mother used to make'—\n\nI thought of my old mother, and the Posey county farm,\n\nAnd me a little kid again, a-hangin' in her arm,\n\nAs she set the pot a-bilin', broke the eggs and poured 'em in\"—\n\nAnd the feller kindo' halted, with a trimble in his chin;\n\nAnd Uncle Jake he fetched the feller's coffee back, and stood\n\nAs solemn, fer a minute, as a' undertaker would;\n\nThen he sorto' turned and tiptoed to'rds the kitchen door—and next,\n\nHere comes his old wife out with him, a-rubbin' of her specs—\n\nAnd she rushes fer the stranger, and she hollers out, \"It's him!—\n\nThank God we've met him comin'!—Don't you know yer mother, Jim?\"\n\nAnd the feller, as he grabbed her, says,—\"You bet I hain't forgot—\n\nBut,\" wipin' of his eyes, says he, \"yer coffee's mighty hot!\"\n\nOne of the most delightful coffee poems in English is Francis Saltus' (d. 1889) sonnet on \"the voluptuous berry\", as found in Flasks and Flagons:\n\nCoffee\n\nVoluptuous berry! Where may mortals find\n\nNectars divine that can with thee compare,\n\nWhen, having dined, we sip thy essence rare,\n\nAnd feel towards wit and repartee inclined?\n\nThou wert of sneering, cynical Voltaire,\n\nThe only friend; thy power urged Balzac's mind\n\nTo glorious effort; surely Heaven designed\n\nThy devotees superior joys to share.\n\nWhene'er I breathe thy fumes, 'mid Summer stars,\n\nThe Orient's splendent pomps my vision greet.\n\nDamascus, with its myriad minarets, gleams!\n\nI see thee, smoking, in immense bazaars,\n\nOr yet, in dim seraglios, at the feet\n\nOf blond Sultanas, pale with amorous dreams!\n\nArthur Gray, in Over the Black Coffee (1902) has made the following contribution to the poetry of coffee, with an unfortunate reflection on tea, which might well have been omitted:\n\nCoffee\n\nO, boiling, bubbling, berry, bean!\n\nThou consort of the kitchen queen—\n\nBrowned and ground of every feature,\n\nThe only aromatic creature,\n\nFor which we long, for which we feel,\n\nThe breath of morn, the perfumed meal.\n\n[Pg 553]For what is tea? It can but mean,\n\nMerely the mildest go-between.\n\nInsipid sobriety of thought and mind\n\nIt \"cuts no figure\"—we can find—\n\nSave peaceful essays, gentle walks,\n\nPurring cats, old ladies' talks—\n\nBut coffee! can other tales unfold.\n\nIts history's written round and bold—\n\nBrave buccaneers upon the \"Spanish Main\",\n\nThe army's march across the lenght'ning plain,\n\nThe lone prospector wandering o'er the hill,\n\nThe hunter's camp, thy fragrance all distill.\n\nSo here's a health to coffee! Coffee hot!\n\nA morning toast! Bring on another pot.\n\nThe Tea and Coffee Trade Journal published in 1909 the following excellent stanzas by William A. Price:\n\nAn Ode to Coffee\n\nOh, thou most fragrant, aromatic joy, impugned, abused, and often stormed against,\n\nAnd yet containing all the blissfulness that in a tiny cup could be condensed!\n\nGive thy contemners calm, imperial scorn—\n\nFor thou wilt reign through ages yet unborn!\n\nSome ancient Arab, so the legend tells, first found thee—may his memory be blest!\n\nThe world-wide sign of brotherhood today, the binding tie between the East and West!\n\nGood coffee pleases in a Persian dell,\n\nAnd Blackfeet Indians make it more than well.\n\nThe lonely traveler in the desert range, if thou art with him, smiles at eventide—\n\nThe sailor, as thy perfume bubbles forth, laughs at the ocean as it rages wide—\n\nAnd where the camps of fighting men are found\n\nThy fragrance hovers o'er each battleground.\n\n\"Use, not abuse, the good things of this life\"—that is a motto from the Prophet's days,\n\nAnd, dealing with thee thus, we ne'er shall come to troublous times or parting of the ways.\n\nComfort and solace both endure with thee,\n\nRich, royal berry of the coffee tree!\n\nThe New York Tribune published in 1915 the following lines by Louis Untermeyer, which were subsequently included in his \"—— and Other Poets.\"[352]\n\nGilbert K. Chesterton Rises to the Toast of Coffee\n\nStrong wine it is a mocker; strong wine it is a beast.\n\nIt grips you when it starts to rise; it is the Fabled Yeast.\n\nYou should not offer ale or beer from hops that are freshly picked,\n\nNor even Benedictine to tempt a benedict.\n\nFor wine has a spell like the lure of hell, and the devil has mixed the brew;\n\nAnd the friends of ale are a sort of pale and weary, witless crew—\n\nAnd the taste of beer is a sort of a queer and undecided brown—\n\nBut, comrades, I give you coffee—drink it up, drink it down.\n\nWith a fol-de-rol-dol and a fol-de-rol-dee, etc.\n\nOh, cocoa's the drink for an elderly don who lives with an elderly niece;\n\nAnd tea is the drink for studios and loud and violent peace—\n\nAnd brandy's the drink that spoils the clothes when the bottle breaks in the trunk;\n\nBut coffee's the drink that is drunken by men who will never be drunk.\n\nSo, gentlemen, up with the festive cup, where Mocha and Java unite;\n\nIt clears the head when things are said too brilliant to be bright!\n\nIt keeps the stars from the golden bars and the lips of the tipsy town;\n\nSo, here's to strong, black coffee—drink it up, drink it down!\n\nWith a fol-de-rol-dol and a fol-de-rol-dee, etc.\n\nThe American breakfast cup is celebrated in up-to-date American style in the following by Helen Rowland in the New York Evening World:\n\nWhat Every Wife Knows\n\nGive me a man who drinks good, hot, dark, strong coffee for breakfast!\n\nA man who smokes a good, dark, fat cigar after dinner!\n\nYou may marry your milk-faddist, or your anti-coffee crank, as you will!\n\nBut I know the magic of the coffee pot!\n\nLet me make my Husband's coffee—and I care not who makes eyes at him!\n\nGive me two matches a day—\n\nOne to start the coffee with, at breakfast, and one for his cigar, after dinner!\n\nAnd I defy all the houris in Christendom to light a new flame in his heart!\n\nOh, sweet supernal coffee-pot!\n\nGentle panacea of domestic troubles,\n\nFaithful author of that sweet nepenthe which deadens all the ills that married folks are heir to.\n\nCheery, glittering, soul-soothing, warmed hearted, inanimate friend!\n\nWhat wife can fail to admit the peace and serenity she owes to you?\n\nTo you, who stand between her and all her early morning troubles—\n\nBetween her and the before-breakfast grouch—\n\nBetween her and the morning-after headache—\n\nBetween her and the cold-gray-dawn scrutiny?\n\nTo you, who supply the golden nectar that stimulates the jaded masculine soul,\n\nSoothes the shaky masculine nerves, stirs the fagged masculine mind, inspires the slow masculine sentiment,\n\nAnd starts the sluggish blood a-flowing and the whole day right!\n\n[Pg 554]What is it, I ask you, when he comes down to breakfast dry of mouth, and touchy of temper—\n\nThat gives him pause, and silences that scintillating barb of sarcasm on the tip of his tongue,\n\nWith which he meant to impale you?\n\nIt is the sweet aroma of the coffee-pot—the thrilling thought of that first delicious sip!\n\nWhat is it, on the morning after the club dance,\n\nThat hides your weary, little, washed-out face and straggling, uncurled coiffure from his critical eyes?\n\nIt is the generous coffee-pot, standing like a guardian angel between you and him!\n\nAnd in those many vital psychological moments, during the honeymoon, which decide for or against the romance and happiness of all the rest of married life—\n\nThose critical before-breakfast moments when temperament meets temperament, and will meets \"won't\"—\n\nWhat is it that halts you on the brink of tragedy,\n\nAnd distracts you from the temptation to answer back?\n\nIt is the absorbing anxiety of watching the coffee boil!\n\nWhat is it that warms his veins and soothes your nerves,\n\nAnd turns all the world suddenly from a dismal gray vale of disappointment to a bright rosy garden of hope—\n\nAnd starts another day gliding smoothly along like a new motor car?\n\nWhat is it that will do more to transform a man from a fiend into an angel than baptism in the River Jordan?\n\nIt is the first cup of coffee in the morning!\n\nCoffee in Dramatic Literature\n\nCoffee was first \"dramatized\", so to speak, in England, where we read that Charles II and the Duke of Yorke attended the first performance of Tarugo's Wiles, or the Coffee House, a comedy, in 1667, which Samuel Pepys described as \"the most ridiculous and insipid play I ever saw in my life.\" The author was Thomas St. Serf. The piece opens in a lively manner, with a request on the part of its fashionable hero for a change of clothes. Accordingly, Tarugo puts off his \"vest, hat, perriwig, and sword,\" and serves the guests to coffee, while the apprentice acts his part as a gentleman customer. Presently other \"customers of all trades and professions\" come dropping into the coffee house. These are not always polite to the supposed coffee-man; one complains of his coffee being \"nothing but warm water boyl'd with burnt beans,\" while another desires him to bring \"chocolette that's prepar'd with water, for I hate that which is encouraged with eggs.\" The pedantry and nonsense uttered by a \"schollar\" character is, perhaps, an unfair specimen of coffee-house talk; it is especially to be noticed that none of the guests ventures upon the dangerous ground of politics.\n\nIn the end, the coffee-master grows tired of his clownish visitors, saying plainly, \"This rudeness becomes a suburb tavern rather than my coffee house\"; and with the assistance of his servants he \"thrusts 'em all out of doors, after the schollars and customers pay.\"\n\nIn 1694, there was published Jean Baptiste Rosseau's comedy, Le Caffè, which appears to have been acted only once in Paris, although a later English dramatist says it met with great applause in the French capital. Le Caffè was written in Laurent's café, which was frequented by Fontenelle, Houdard de la Motte, Dauchet, the abbé Alary Boindin, and others. Voltaire said that \"this work of a young man without any experience either of the world of letters or of the theater seems to herald a new genius.\"\n\nAbout this time it was the fashion for the coffee-house keepers of Paris, and the waiters, to wear Armenian costumes; for Pascal had builded better than he knew. In La Foire Saint-Germain, a comedy by Dancourt, played in 1696, one of the principal characters is old \"Lorange, a coffee merchant clothed as an Armenian\". In scene 5, he says to Mlle. Mousset, \"a seller of house dresses\" that he has been \"a naturalized Armenian for three weeks.\"\n\nMrs. Susannah Centlivre (1667?–1723), in her comedy, A Bold Stroke for a Wife, produced about 1719, has a scene laid in Jonathan's coffee house about that period. While the stock jobbers are talking in the first scene of act II, the coffee boys are crying, \"Fresh Coffee, gentlemen, fresh coffee?... Bohea tea, gentlemen?\"\n\nHenry Fielding (1707–1754) published \"The Coffee-House Politician, or Justice caught in his own trap,\" a comedy, in 1730.\n\nThe Coffee House, a dramatick Piece by James Miller, was performed at the Theater Royal in Drury Lane in 1737. The interior of Dick's coffee house figured as an engraved frontispiece to the published version of the play.\n\nThe author states in the preface that \"this piece is partly taken from a comedy of one act written many years ago in French by the famous Rosseau, called 'Le[Pg 555] Caffè', which met with great applause in Paris.\" The coffee house in the play is conducted by the Widow Notable, who has a pretty daughter for whom, like all good mothers, she is anxious to arrange a suitable marriage.\n\nIn the first scene, an acrimonious conversation takes place between Puzzle, the Politician, and Bays, the poet, in which squabble the Pert Beau and the Solemn Beau, and other habitués of the place take part. Puzzle discovers that a comedian and other players are in the room, and insists that they be ejected or forbidden the house. The Widow is justly incensed, and indignantly replies:\n\nForbid the Players my House, Sir! Why, Sir, I get more by them in a Week than I do by you in seven Years. You come here and hold a paper in your hand for an Hour, disturb the whole Company with your Politics, call for Pen and Ink, Paper and Wax, beg a Pipe of Tobacco, burn out half a Candle, eat half a Pound of Sugar, and then go away, and pay Two-pence for a Dish of Coffee. I could soon shut up my doors, if I had not some other good People to make amends for what I lose by such as you, Sir.\n\nAll join the Widow in scoffing and jeering, and exit the highly discomfited Puzzle. The pretty little Kitty tricks her mother with the aid of the Player, and marries the man of her choice, but is forgiven when he is found to be a gentleman of the Temple.\n\nThe play is in one act and has several songs. The last is one of five stanzas, with music \"set by Mr. Caret:\"\n\nSong\n\nWhat Pleasures a Coffee-House daily bestows!\n\nTo read and hear how the World merrily goes;\n\nTo laugh, sing and prattle of This, That, and T' other;\n\nAnd be flatter'd and ogl'd and kiss'd too, like Mother.\n\nHere the Rake, after Roving and Tipling all Night,\n\nFor his Groat in the Morning may set his Head right.\n\nAnd the Beau, who ne'er fouls his White fingers with Brass,\n\nMay have his Sixpen' worth of—Stare in the Glass.\n\nThe Doctor, who'd always be ready to kill,\n\nMay ev'ry Day here take his Stand, if he will;\n\nAnd the soldier, who'd bluster and challenge secure,\n\nMay draw boldly here, for—we'll hold him he's sure.\n\nThe Lawyer, who's always in quest of his Prey,\n\nMay find fools here to feed upon every Day;\n\nAnd the sage Politician, in Coffee-Grounds known,\n\nMay point out the Fate of each Crown but—his own.\n\nThen, Gallants, since ev'rything here you may find\n\nThat pleasures the Fancy or profits the Mind,\n\nCome all, and take each a full Dish of Delight,\n\nAnd crowd up our Coffee-House every night.\n\nJohn Timbs tells us this play \"met with great opposition on its representation, owing to its being stated that the characters were intended for a particular family (that of Mrs. Yarrow and her daughter) who kept Dick's, the coffee-house which the artist had inadvertently selected as the frontispiece. It appears,\" Timbs continues, \"that the landlady and her daughter were the reigning toast of the Templars, who then frequented Dick's; and took the matter up so strongly that they united to condemn the farce on the night of its production; they succeeded, and even extended their resentment to everything suspected to be this author's (the Rev. James Miller) for a considerable time after.\"\n\nCarlo Goldoni, who has been called the Molière of Italy, wrote La Bottega di Caffè, (The Coffee House), a naturalistic comedy of bourgeois Venice, satirizing scandal and gambling, in 1750. The scene is a Venetian coffee house (probably Florian's), where several actions take place simultaneously. Among several remarkable studies is one of a prattling slanderer, Don Marzio, which ranks as one of the finest bits of original character drawing the stage has ever seen. The play was produced in English by the Chicago Theatre Society in[Pg 556] 1912. Chatfield-Taylor[353] thinks Voltaire probably imitated La Bottega di Caffè in his Le Café, ou l'Ecossaise. Goldoni was a lover of coffee, a regular frequenter of the coffee houses of his time, from which he drew much in the way of inspiration. Pietro Longhi, called the Venetian Hogarth, in one of his pictures presenting life and manners in Venice during the years of her decadence, shows Goldoni as a visitor in a café of the period, with a female mendicant soliciting alms. It is in the collection of Professor Italico Brass.\n\nGoldoni, in the comedy The Persian Wife, gives us a glimpse of coffee making in the middle of the eighteenth century. He puts these words into the mouth of Curcuma, the slave:\n\nHere is the coffee, ladies, coffee native of Arabia,\n\nAnd carried by the caravans into Ispahan.\n\nThe coffee of Arabia is certainly always the best.\n\nWhile putting forth its leaves on one side, upon the other the flowers appear;\n\nBorn of a rich soil, it wishes shade, or but little sun.\n\nPlanted every three years is this little tree in the surface of the soil.\n\nThe fruit, though truly very small,\n\nShould yet grow large enough to become somewhat green.\n\nLater, when used, it should be freshly ground.\n\nKept in a warm and dry place and jealously guarded.\n\n***\n\nBut a small quantity is needed to prepare it.\n\nPut in the desired quantity and do not spill it over the fire;\n\nHeat it till the foam rises, then let it subside again away from the fire;\n\nDo this seven times at least, and coffee is made in a moment.\n\nIn 1760 there appeared in France Le Café, ou l'Ecossaise, comédie, which purported to have been written by a Mr. Hume, an Englishman, and to have been translated into French. It was in reality the work of Voltaire, who had brought out another play, Socrates, in the same manner a short time before. Le Café, was translated into English the same year under the title The Coffee House, or Fair Fugitive. The title page says the play is written by \"Mr. Voltaire\" and translated from the French. It is a comedy in five acts. The principal characters are: Fabrice, a good-natured man and the keeper of the coffee house; Constantia, the fair fugitive; Sir William Woodville, a gentleman of distinction under misfortune; Belmont, in love with Constantia, a man of fortune and interest; Freeport, a merchant and an epitome of English manners; Scandal, a sharper; and Lady Alton, in love with Belmont.\n\nIl Caffè di Campagna, a play with music by Galuppi, appeared in Italy in 1762.\n\nAnother Italian play, a comedy called La Caffettiéra da Spirito was produced in 1807.\n\nHamilton, a play by Mary P. Hamlin and George Arliss, the latter also playing the title rôle, was produced in America by George C. Tyler in 1918. The first-act scene is laid in the Exchange coffee house of Philadelphia, during the period of Washington's first administration. Among the characters introduced in this scene are James Monroe, Count Tallyrand, General Philip Schuyler, and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe authors very faithfully reproduce the atmosphere of the coffee house of Washington's time. As Tallyrand remarks, \"Everybody comes to see everybody at the Exchange Coffee House.... It is club, restaurant, merchants' exchange, everything.\"\n\nThe Autocrat of the Coffee Stall, a play in one act, by Harold Chapin, was published in New York in 1921.\n\nCoffee and Literature in General\n\nAn interesting book might be written on the transformation that tea and coffee have wrought in the tastes of famous literary men. And of the two stimulants, coffee seems to have furnished greater refreshment and inspiration to most. However, both beverages have made civilization their debtor in that they weaned so many fine minds from the heavy wines and spirits in which they once indulged.\n\nVoltaire and Balzac were the most ardent devotees of coffee among the French literati. Sir James Mackintosh (1765–1832), the Scottish philosopher and statesman, was so fond of coffee that he used to assert that the powers of a man's mind would generally be found to be proportional to the quantity of that stimulant which he drank. His brilliant schoolmate and friend, Robert Hall (1764–1831), the Baptist minister and pulpit orator, preferred tea, of which he sometimes drank a dozen cups.[Pg 557] Cowper; Parson and Parr, the famous Greek scholars; Dr. Samuel Johnson; and William Hazlitt, the writer and critic, were great tea drinkers; but Burton, Dean Swift, Addison, Steele, Leigh Hunt, and many others, celebrated coffee.\n\nDr. Charles B. Reed, professor in the medical school of Northwestern University, says that coffee may be considered as a type of substance that fosters genius. History seems to bear him out. Coffee's essential qualities are so well defined, says Dr. Reed, that one critic has claimed the ability to trace throughout the works of Voltaire those portions that came from coffee's inspiration. Tea and coffee promote a harmony of the creative faculties that permits the mental concentration necessary to produce the masterpieces of art and literature.\n\nVoltaire (1694–1778) the king of wits, was also king of coffee drinkers. Even in his old age he was said to have consumed fifty cups daily. To the abstemious Balzac (1799–1850) coffee was both food and drink.\n\nIn Frederick Lawton's Balzac we read: \"Balzac worked hard. His habit was to go to bed at six in the evening, sleep till twelve, and, after, to rise and write for nearly twelve hours at a stretch, imbibing coffee as a stimulant through these spells of composition.\"\n\nIn his Treatise on Modern Stimulants, Balzac thus describes his reaction to his most beloved stimulant:\n\nThis coffee falls into your stomach, and straightway there is a general commotion. Ideas begin to move like the battalions of the Grand Army on the battlefield, and the battle takes place. Things remembered arrive at full gallop, ensign to the wind. The light cavalry of comparisons deliver a magnificent deploying charge, the artillery of logic hurry up with their train and ammunition, the shafts of wit start up like sharpshooters. Similes arise, the paper is covered with ink; for the struggle commences and is concluded with torrents of black water, just as a battle with powder.\n\nWhen Balzac tells how Doctor Minoret, Ursule Minoret's guardian, used to regale his friends with a cup of \"Moka,\" mixed with Bourbon and Martinique, which the Doctor insisted on personally preparing in a silver coffee pot, it is his own custom that he is detailing. His Bourbon he bought only in the rue Mont Blanc (now the chaussé d'Antin); the Martinique, in the rue des Vielles Audriettes; the Mocha, at a grocer's in the rue de l'Université. It was half a day's journey to fetch them.\n\nThere have been notable contributions to the general literature of coffee by French, Italian, English, and American writers. Space does not permit of more than passing mention of some of them.\n\nThe reactions of the early French and English writers have been touched upon in the chapters on the coffee houses of old London and the early Parisian coffee houses, and in the history chapters dealing with the evolution of coffee drinking and coffee manners and customs.\n\nAfter Dufour, Galland, and La Roque in France, there were Count Rumford, John Timbs, Douglas Ellis, and Robinson in England; Jardin and Franklin in France; Belli in Italy; Hewitt, Thurber, and Walsh in America.\n\nMention has been made of coffee references in the works of Aubrey, Burton, Addison, Steele, Bacon, and D'Israeli.\n\nBrillat-Savarin (1755–1826) the great French epicure, knew coffee as few men before him or since. In his historical elegy, contained in Gastronomy as a Fine Art, or the Science of Good Living, he exclaims:\n\nYou crossed and mitred abbots and bishops who dispensed the favors of Heaven, and you the dreaded templars who armed yourselves for the extermination of the Saracens, you knew nothing of the sweet restoring influence of our modern chocolate, nor of the thought-inspiring bean of Arabia—how I pity you!\n\nO. de Gourcuff's De la Café, épître attribué à Senecé, is deserving of honorable mention.\n\nAn early French writer pays this tribute to the inspirational effects of coffee:\n\nIn Bologna, 1691, Angelo Rambaldi published Ambrosia arabica, caffè discorso. This work is divided into eighteen sections, and describes the origin, cultivation, and roasting of the bean, as well as telling how to prepare the beverage.\n\nDuring the time that Milan was under Spanish rule, Cesare Beccaria directed and edited a publication entitled Il Caffè, which was published from June 4, 1764, to May, 1766, \"edited in Brescia by Giammaria Rizzardi and undertaken by a little society of friends,\" according to the salutatory. Besides the Marchese Beccaria, other editors and contributors were Pietro and Alexander Verri, Baillon, Visconti, Colpani, Longhi, Albertenghi, Frisi, and Secchi. The same periodical, with the same editorial staff, was published also in Venice in the Typografia Pizzolato.\n\nAnother publication called Il Caffè, devoted to arts, letters, and science, was published in Venice in 1850–52. Still another, having the same name, a national weekly journal, was published in Milan, 1884–89.\n\nAn almanac, having the title Il Caffè, was published in Milan in 1829.\n\nA weekly paper, called Il Caffè Pedrocchi, was published in Padua in 1846–48. It was devoted to art, literature and politics.\n\nA publication called Coffee and Surrogates (tea, chocolate, saffron, pepper, and other stimulants) was founded by Professor Pietro Polli, in Milan, in 1885; but was short-lived.\n\nAn early English magazine (1731) contains an account of divination by coffee-grounds. The writer pays an unexpected visit, and \"surprised the lady and her company in close cabal over their coffee, the interest very intent upon one whom, by her address and intelligence, he guessed was a tire woman, to which she added the secret of divining by coffee grounds. She was then in full inspiration, and with much solemnity observing the atoms around the cup; on the one hand sat a widow, on the other a maiden lady. They assured me that every cast of the cup is a picture of all one's life to come, and every transaction and circumstance is delineated with the exactest certainty.\"\n\nThe advertisement used by this seer is quite interesting:\n\nIf the one ounce of coffee represented her payment for reading the future, the charge could not be considered exorbitant!\n\nEnglish writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were noticeably affected by coffee, and the coffee-houses of the times have been immortalized by them; and in many instances they themselves were immortalized by the coffee houses and their frequenters. In the chapters already referred to and at the close of this chapter, will be found stories, quips, and anecdotes, in which occur many names that are now famous in art and literature.\n\nModern journalism dates from the publication, April 12, 1709, of the Tatler, whose editor was Sir Richard Steele (1672–1729) the Irish dramatist and essayist. He received his inspiration from the coffee houses; and his readers were the men that knew them best. In the first issue he announced:\n\nAll accounts of gallantry, pleasure and entertainment shall be under the article of White's Coffee House; poetry under that of Will's Coffee House; learning under the title of Grecian; foreign and domestic news you will have from St. James's Coffee House, and what else I shall on any other subject offer shall be dated from my own apartment.\n\nSteele's Tatler was issued three times weekly until 1711, when it suspended to be succeeded by the Spectator, whose principal contributor was Joseph Addison (1672–1719), the essayist and poet, and Steele's school-fellow.\n\nSir Richard Steele immortalized the Don and Don Saltero's coffee house in old Chelsea in No. 34 of the Tatler, wherein he tells us of the necessity of traveling to know the world, by his journey for fresh air, no farther than the village of Chelsea, of which he fancied that he could give an immediate[Pg 559] description—from the five fields, where the the robbers lie in wait, to the coffee house, where the literati sit in council. But he found, even in a place so near town as this, that there were enormities and persons of eminence, whom he before knew nothing of.\n\nThe coffee house was almost absorbed by the museum, Steele says:\n\nWhen I came into the coffee-house, I had not time to salute the company, before my eyes were diverted by ten thousand gimcracks round the room, and on the ceiling. When my first astonishment was over, comes to me a sage of thin and meagre countenance, which aspect made me doubt whether reading or fretting had made it so philosophic; but I very soon perceived him to be that sort which the ancients call \"gingivistee\", in our language \"tooth-drawers\". I immediately had a respect for the man; for these practical philosophers go upon a very practical hypothesis, not to cure, but to take away the part affected. My love of mankind made me very benevolent to Mr. Salter, for such is the name of this eminent barber and antiquary.\n\nThe Don was famous for his punch, and for his skill on the fiddle. He drew teeth also, and wrote verses; he described his museum in several stanzas, one of which is:\n\nMonsters of all sorts are seen:\n\nStrange things in nature as they grew so;\n\nSome relicks of the Sheba Queen,\n\nAnd fragments of the fam'd Bob Crusoe.\n\nSteele then plunges into a deep thought why barbers should go farther in hitting the ridiculous than any other set of men; and maintains that Don Saltero is descended in a right line, not from John Tradescant, as he himself asserts, but from the memorable companion of the Knight of Mancha. Steele certifies to all the worthy citizens who travel to see the Don's rarities, that his double-barreled pistols, targets, coats of mail, his sclopeta (hand-culverin) and sword of Toledo, were left to his ancestor by the said Don Quixote; and by his ancestor to all his progeny down to Saltero. Though Steele thus goes far in favor of Don Saltero's great merit, he objects to his imposing several names (without his license) on the collection he has made, to the abuse of the good people of England; one of which is particularly calculated to deceive religious persons, to the great scandal of the well-disposed and may introduce heterodox opinions. (Among the curiosities presented by Admiral Munden was a coffin, containing the body or relics of a Spanish saint, who had wrought miracles.) Says Steele:\n\nHe shows you a straw hat, which I know to be made by Madge Peskad, within three miles of Bedford; and tells you \"It is Pontius Pilate's wife's chambermaid's sister's hat.\" To my knowledge of this very hat, it may be added that the covering of straw was never used among the Jews, since it was demanded of them to make bricks without it. Therefore, this is nothing but, under the specious pretense of learning and antiquities, to impose upon the world. There are other things which I can not tolerate among his rarities, as, the china figure of the lady in the glass-case; the Italian engine, for the imprisonment of those who go abroad with it; both of which I hereby order to be taken down, or else he may expect to have his letters patent for making punch superseded, be debarred wearing his muff next winter, or ever coming to London without his wife.\n\nBabillard says that Salter had an old grey muff, and that, by wearing it up to his nose, he was distinguishable at the distance of a quarter of a mile. His wife was none of the best, being much addicted to scolding; and Salter, who liked his glass, if he could make a trip to London by himself, was in no haste to return.\n\nDon Saltero's proved very attractive as an exhibition, and drew crowds to the coffee house. A catalog was published of which were printed more than forty editions. Smollett, the novelist, was among the donors. The catalog, in 1760, comprehended the following rarities:\n\nTigers' tusks; the Pope's candle; the skeleton of a Guinea-pig; a fly-cap monkey, a piece of the true Cross; the Four Evangelists' heads cut out on a cherry stone; the King of Morocco's tobacco-pipe; Mary Queen of Scots' pincushion; Queen Elizabeth's prayer-book; a pair of Nun's stockings; Job's ears, which grew on a tree; a frog in a tobacco stopper; and five hundred more odd relics!\n\nThe Don had a rival, as appears by A Catalogue of the Rarities to be seen at Adam's, at the Royal Swan, in Kingsland-road, leading from Shoreditch Church, 1756. Mr. Adams exhibited, for the entertainment of the curious:\n\nThese are only a few out of five hundred other equally marvellous exhibits.\n\nThe success of Don Saltero in attracting visitors to his coffee house, induced the proprietor of the Chelsea bunhouse to make a similar collection of rarities, to attract customers for his buns; and to some extent it was successful.\n\nIn the first number of the Spectator, Addison says:\n\nIn the second number he tells that:\n\nI am now settled with a widow woman, who has a great many children and complies with my humor in everything. I do not remember that we have exchanged a word together for these five years; my coffee comes into my chamber every morning without asking for it, if I want fire I point to the chimney, if water, to my basin; upon which my landlady nods as much as to say she takes my meaning, and immediately obeys my signals.\n\nThree of Addison's papers in the Spectator (Nos. 402, 481, and 568) are humorously descriptive of the coffee houses of the period. No. 403 opens with the remark that:\n\nThe courts of two countries do not so much differ from one another, as the Court and the City, in their peculiar ways of life and conversation. In short, the inhabitants of St. James, notwithstanding they live under the same laws, and speak the same language, are a distinct people from those of Cheapside, who are likewise removed from those of the Temple on the one side, and those of Smithfleld on the other, by several climates and degrees in their way of thinking and conversing together.\n\nFor this reason, the author takes a ramble through London and Westminster, to gather the opinions of his ingenious countrymen upon a current report of the king of France's death.\n\nJohnson wrote in his Life of Addison concerning the Tatler and the Spectator that they were:\n\nPublished at a time when two parties, loud, restless and violent, each with plausible declarations, and both perhaps without any distinct determination of its views, were agitating the nation; to minds heated with political contest they supplied cooler and more inoffensive reflections.... They had a perceptible influence on the conversation of the time, and taught the frolic and the gay to unite merriment with decency, effects which they can never wholly lose.\n\nHarold Routh in the Cambridge History of Literature, speaking of the Spectator, says:\n\nSamuel Pepys (1633–1703) was very fond of good eating, and almost daily entries were made in his Diary of dinner delicacies that he had enjoyed. One dinner, that he considered a great success, was served to eight persons, and consisted of oysters, a hash of rabbits, a lamb, a rare chine of beef; next a great dish of roasting fowl (\"cost me about 30 s.\") a tart, then fruit and cheese. \"My dinner was noble enough ... I believe this day's feast will cost me near 5 pounds.\" But it will be noted that coffee was not mentioned as a part of the menu.\n\nHe makes countless references to visits paid to this and that coffee house, but records only one instance of actually drinking coffee:\n\nUp betimes to my office, and thence at seven o'clock to Sir G. Carteret, and there with Sir J. Minnes made an end of his accounts, but staid not to dinner my Lady having made us drink our morning draft there of several wines, but I drank nothing but some of her coffee, which was poorly made, with a little sugar in it.\n\nThis note which he considered worthy of record was certainly not inspired by the excellence of the good lady's matutinal coffee.\n\nWilliam Cobbett (1762–1835) the English-American politician, reformer, and writer on economics, denounced coffee as[Pg 562] \"slops\"; but he was one of a remarkably small minority. Before his day, one of England's greatest satirists, Dean Swift, (1667–1745) led a long roll of literary men who were devotees of coffee.\n\nSwift's writings are full of references to coffee; and his letters from Stella came to him under cover, at the St. James coffee house. There is scarcely a letter to Esther (Vanessa) Vanhomrigh which does not contain a significant reference to coffee, by which the course of their friendship and clandestine meetings may be traced. In one dated August 13, 1720, written while traveling from place to place in Ireland, he says:\n\nIn another letter, about two years later, replying to one in which Vanessa has reproached him and begged him to write her soon, he advises:\n\nThe best maxim I know in life, is to drink your coffee when you can, and when you cannot, to be easy without it; while you continue to be splenetic, count upon it I will always preach. Thus much I sympathize with you, that I am not cheerful enough to write, for, I believe, coffee once a week is necessary, and you know very well that coffee makes us severe, and grave, and philosophical.\n\nThese various references to coffee are thought to have been based upon an incident in the early days of their friendship, when on the occasion of the Vanhomrigh family journeying from Dublin to London, Vanessa accidentally spilt her coffee in the chimney-place at a certain inn, which Swift considered a premonition of their growing friendship. Writing from Clogher, Swift reminds Vanessa:\n\nRemember that riches are nine parts in ten of all that is good in life, and health is the tenth—drinking coffee comes long after, and yet it is the eleventh, but without the two former you cannot drink it right.\n\nIn another letter he writes facetiously, in memory of her playful badinage:\n\nI long to drink a dish of coffee in the sluttery and hear you dun me for a secret, and \"Drink your coffee; why don't you drink your coffee?\"\n\nLeigh Hunt had very pleasant things to say about coffee, giving to it the charm of appeal to the imagination, which he said one never finds in tea. For example:\n\nIn his old age, Immanuel Kant, the great metaphysician, became extremely fond of coffee; and Thomas de Quincey relates a little incident showing Kant's great eagerness for the after-dinner cup.\n\nThackeray (1811–1863) must have suffered many tea and coffee disappointments. In the Kickleburys on the Rhine he asks: \"Why do they always put mud into coffee aboard steamers? Why does the tea generally taste of boiled boots?\"\n\nIn Arthur's, A. Neil Lyons has preserved for all time the atmosphere of the London coffee stall. \"I would not,\" he says, \"exchange a night at Arthur's for a week with the brainiest circle in London.\" The book is a collection of short stories. As already recorded, Harold Chapin dramatized this picturesque London institution in The Autocrat of the Coffee Stall.\n\nIn General Horace Porter's Campaigning with Grant, we have three distinct coffee incidents within fifty-odd pages; or explicitly, see pages 47, 56, 101; where, deep in the fiercest snarls of The Wilderness campaign we are treated to:\n\nGeneral Grant, slowly sipping his coffee ... a full ration of that soothing army beverage.... The general made rather a singular meal preparatory to so exhausting a day as that which was to follow. He took a cucumber, sliced it, poured some vinegar over it, and partook of nothing else except a cup of strong coffee.... The general seemed in excellent spirits, and was even inclined to be jocose. He said to me, \"We have just had our coffee, and you will find some left for you.\" ... I drank it with the relish of a shipwrecked mariner.\n\nOne of the first immediate supplies General Sherman desired from Wilmington, on reaching Fayetteville and lines of communication in March, 1865, was, expressly, coffee; does he not say so himself, on page 297 of the second volume of his Memoirs?\n\nStill more expressly, towards the close of his Memoirs, and among final recommendations, the fruit of his experiences in that whole vast war, General Sherman says this for coffee:\n\nCoffee has become almost indispensable, though many substitutes were found for it, such as Indian corn, roasted, ground and boiled as coffee, the sweet potato, and the seed of the okra plant prepared in the same way. All these were used by the people of the South, who for years could procure no coffee, but I noticed that the women always begged of us real coffee, which seemed to satisfy a natural yearning or craving more powerful than can be accounted for on the theory of habit. Therefore I would always advise that the coffee and sugar ration be carried along, even at the expense of bread, for which there are many substitutes.\n\nGeorge Agnew Chamberlain's novel Home contains a vivid description of coffee-making on an old plantation, and could only have been written by a devoted lover of this drink. Gerry Lansing, the American, has escaped drowning in the river, and is now lost in the Brazilian forest. He finds his way at last to an old plantation house:\n\nA stove was built into the masonry, and a cavernous oven gaped from the massive wall. At the stove was an old negress, making coffee with shaky deliberation.... The girl and the wrinkled old woman made him sit down at the table, and then placed before him crisp rusks of mandioc flour and steaming coffee whose splendid aroma triumphed over the sordidness of the scene and through the nostrils reached the palate with anticipatory touch. It was sweetened with dark, pungent syrup and was served black in a capacious bowl, as though one could not drink too deeply of the elixir of life. Gerry ate ravenously and sipped the coffee, at first sparingly, then greedily.... Gerry set down the empty bowl with a sigh. The rusks had been delicious. Before the coffee the name of nectar dwindled to impotency. Its elixir rioted in his veins.\n\nIn the Rosary, Florence L. Barclay has a Scotch woman tell how she makes coffee. She says:\n\nCyrus Townsend Brady's The Corner in Coffee is \"a thrilling romance of the New York coffee market.\"\n\nCoffee, Du Barry, and Louis XV figure in one scene of the story of The Moat with the Crimson Stains, as told by Elizabeth W. Champney in her Romance of the Bourbon Chateaux.[354] It tells of the German apprentice Riesener, who assisted his master Oeben in designing for Louis XV a beautiful desk with a secret drawer,[Pg 564] which it took ten years of unremitting industry to execute. At the end, Riesener was to be accepted by his master as a partner and a son-in-law. Little Victoire, who loved to sit in a punt and trail her doll in the waters of the Bievre to see to what color its frock would be changed by the dyes of the Gobelin factory, was then only five, and Madam Oeben twenty-three. As the years rolled by, Riesener grew to love the mother and not the daughter, who, meanwhile, shot up into a slim girl, not of her mother's beauty, but of a loveliness all her own. Then there was a quarrel because the young apprentice thought the master should have resented the suggestion of M. Duplessis that his wife pose in the nude for the statuettes which were to hold the sconces on the king's desk; and Riesener left in a fine youthful frenzy, vowing he would never return while the maître lived. The latter, unable to complete the masterpiece which he loved more than anything else on earth, sought death, and perished in the crimson waters of the Bievre.\n\nThe maître had no enemies, but his quarrel with Riesener caused a fear to spring up in the widow's heart that the apprentice might have been guilty of his murder, so she refused to see him when, hearing of his master's death, he returned, stricken with remorse, to finish the desk. On it were the statuettes modeled in perfect likeness of Mlle. de Vaubernier, a wily little milliner of Riesener's bohemian set who had taken this way to bring herself to the attention of Louis XV. The ruse was successful; and after the acceptance of the desk, there was installed a new maîtresse en titre, the notorious Madame Du Barry, erstwhile the pretty milliner, Mlle. de Vaubernier.\n\nLater, Madame Du Barry sent for the now famous ebeniste (cabinet maker); and, when her negro page Zamore admitted him, he found His Majesty Louis XV kneeling in front of the fireplace, making coffee for her while she laughed at him for scalding his fingers. He had been summoned to show the king the mechanism of the secret drawer, so cunningly concealed in the king's desk that no one could find it. But Riesener knew not the secret of his master, who had died without revealing it. Then the red revolution came; and when the pretty pavilion at Louveciennes was sacked, and its costly furniture hurled down the cliff to the Seine, the king's desk, shattered almost beyond repair, was carried to the Gobelins' factory and presented to Mme. Oeben in recognition of her husband's workmanship. Then the secret compartment was found to have been disclosed, and Riesener was absolved by a letter therein, from the maître, who intimated he was about to end it all because of paralysis. Riesener marries the widow and all ends happily.\n\nJames Lane Allen, in The Kentucky Warbler, tells a tale of the Blue Grass country and of a young hero who wanders after a bird's note to find romance and the key to his own locked nature. Here is an incident from his first forest adventure:\n\nThere was one tree he curiously looked around for, positive that he should not be blind to it if fortunate enough to set his eyes on one—the coffee tree. That is, he felt sure he'd recognize it if it yielded coffee ready to drink, of which never in his life had they given him enough. Not once throughout his long troubled experience as to being fed had he been allowed as much coffee as he craved. Once, when younger, he had heard some one say that the only tree in all the American forests that bore the name of Kentucky was the Kentucky coffee tree, and he had instantly conceived a desire to pay a visit in secret to that corner of the woods. To take his cup and a few lumps of sugar and sit under the boughs and catch the coffee as it dripped down.... No one to hold him back ... as much as he wanted at last.... The Kentucky coffee tree—his favorite in Nature!\n\nJohn Kendrick Bangs relates, in Coffee and Repartee[355], some amusing skirmishes indulged in at the boarding-house table, between the Idiot and the guests, where coffee served the purpose of enlivening the tilt:\n\n\"Can't I give you another cup of coffee?\" asked the landlady of the School Master.\n\n\"You may,\" returned the School Master, pained at the lady's grammar, but too courteous to call attention to it save by the emphasis with which he spoke the word \"may\".\n\nSaid the Idiot: \"You may fill my cup too, Mrs. Smithers.\"\n\n\"The coffee is all gone,\" returned the landlady, with a snap.\n\n\"Then, Mary,\" said the Idiot, gracefully turning to the maid, \"you may give me a glass of ice water. It is quite as warm, after all, as the coffee and not quite so weak.\"\n\nOne other little skit remains at the expense of Mrs. Smithers' coffee. At the breakfast table, where the air, as usual, is[Pg 565] charged with repartee, Mr. Whitechoker, the minister, says to his landlady:\n\n\"Mrs. Smithers, I'll have a dash of hot water in my coffee, this morning.\" Then with a glance toward the Idiot, he added, \"I think it looks like rain.\"\n\n\"Referring to the coffee, Mr. Whitechoker?\" queried the Idiot....\n\n\"Ah,—I don't quite follow you,\" replied the Minister with some annoyance.\n\n\"You said something looked like rain, and I asked you if the thing referred to was the coffee, for I was disposed to agree with you,\" said the Idiot.\n\n\"I am sure,\" put in Mrs. Smithers, \"that a gentleman of Mr. Whitechoker's refinement would not make any such insinuation, sir. He is not the man to quarrel with what is set before him.\"\n\n\"I must ask your pardon, Madam,\" returned the Idiot politely. \"I hope I am not the man to quarrel with my food, either. Indeed, I make it a rule to avoid unpleasantness of all sorts, particularly with the weak, under which category I find your coffee.\"\n\nCoffee Quips and Anecdotes\n\nCoffee literature is full of quips and anecdotes. Probably the most famous coffee quip is that of Mme. de Sévigné, who, as already told in chapter XI, was wrongfully credited with saying, \"Racine and coffee will pass.\" It was Voltaire in his preface to Irene who thus accused the amiable letter-writer; and she, being dead, could not deny it.\n\nThat Mme. de Sévigné was at one time a coffee drinker is apparent from this quotation from one of her letters: \"The cavalier believes that coffee gives him warmth, and I at the same time, foolish as you know me, do not take it any longer.\"\n\nLa Roque called the beverage \"the King of Perfumes\", whose charm was enriched when vanilla was added.\n\nEmile Souvestre (1806–1854) said: \"Coffee keeps, so to say, the balance between bodily and spiritual nourishment.\"\n\nIsid Bourdon said: \"The discovery of coffee has enlarged the realm of illusion and given more promise to hope.\"\n\nAn old Bourbon proverb says: \"To an old man a cup of coffee is like the door post of an old house—it sustains and strengthens him.\"\n\nJardin says that in the Antilles, instead of orange blossoms, the brides carry a spray of coffee blossoms; and when a woman remains unmarried, they say she has lost her coffee branch. \"We say in France, that she has coiffé Sainte-Catherine.\"\n\nFontenelle and Voltaire have both been quoted as authors of the famous reply to the remark that coffee was a slow poison: \"I think it must be, for I've been drinking it for eighty-five years and am not dead yet.\"\n\nIn Meidinger's German Grammar the \"slow-poison\" bon mot is attributed to Fontenelle.\n\nIt seems reasonable to give Fontenelle credit for this bon mot. Voltaire died at eighty-four. Fontenelle lived to be nearly a hundred years. Of his cheerfulness at an advanced age an anecdote is related. In conversation, one day, a lady a few years younger than Fontenelle playfully remarked, \"Monsieur, you and I stay here so long, methinks Death has forgotten us.\" \"Hush! Speak in a whisper, madame,\" replied Fontenelle, \"tant mieux! (so much the better!) don't remind him of us.\"\n\nFlaubert, Hugo, Baudelaire, Paul de Kock, Théophile Gautier, Alfred de Musset, Zola, Coppée, George Sand, Guy de Maupassant, and Sarah Bernhardt, all have been credited with many clever or witty sallies about coffee.\n\nPrince Talleyrand (1754–1839), the French diplomat and wit, has given us the cleverest summing up of the ideal cup of coffee. He said it should be \"Noir comme le diable, chaud comme l'enfer, pur comme un ange, doux comme l'amour.\" Or in English, \"black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.\"\n\nThis quip has been wrongfully attributed to Brillat-Savarin. Talleyrand said also:\n\nA cup of coffee lightly tempered with good milk detracts nothing from your intellect; on the contrary, your stomach is freed by it, and no longer distresses your brain; it will not hamper your mind with troubles, but give freedom to its working. Suave molecules of Mocha stir up your blood, without causing excessive heat; the organ of thought receives from it a feeling of sympathy; work becomes easier, and you will sit down without distress to your principal repast, which will restore your body, and afford you a calm delicious night.\n\nAmong coffee drinkers a high place must be given to Prince Bismarck (1815–1898). He liked coffee unadulterated. While with the Prussian army in France, he one day entered a country inn and asked the host if he had any chicory in the house. He had. Bismarck said: \"Well, bring it to[Pg 566] me; all you have.\" The man obeyed, and handed Bismarck a canister full of chicory.\n\n\"Are you sure this is all you have?\" demanded the chancellor.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, every grain.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Bismarck, keeping the canister by him, \"go now and make me a pot of coffee.\"\n\nThis same story has been related of François Paul Jules Grévy (1807–1891), president of France, 1879–1887. According to the French story, Grévy never took wine, even at dinner. He was, however, passionately fond of coffee. To be certain of having his favorite beverage of the best quality, he always, when he could, prepared it himself. Once he was invited, with a friend, M. Bethmont, to a hunting party by M. Menier, the celebrated manufacturer of chocolate, at Noisiel. It happened that M. Grévy and M. Bethmont lost themselves in the forest. Trying to find their way out, they stumbled upon a little wine house, and stopped for a rest. They asked for something to drink. M. Bethmont found his wine excellent; but, as usual, Grévy would not drink. He wanted coffee, but he was afraid of the decoction which would be brought him. He got a good cup, however, and this is how he managed it:\n\n\"Have you any chicory?\" he said to the man.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Bring me some.\"\n\nSoon the proprietor returned with a small can of chicory.\n\n\"Is that all you have?\" asked Grévy.\n\n\"We have a little more.\"\n\n\"Bring me the rest.\"\n\nWhen he came again, with another can of chicory, Grévy said:\n\n\"You have no more?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now go and make me a cup of coffee.\"\n\nAs already told, Louis XV had a great passion for coffee, which he made himself. Lenormand, the head gardener at Versailles, raised six pounds of coffee a year which was for the exclusive use of the king. The king's fondness for coffee and for Mme. Du Barry gave rise to a celebrated anecdote of Louveciennes which was accepted as true by many serious writers. It is told in this fashion by Mairobert in a pamphlet scandalizing Du Barry in 1776:\n\nCharles Vatel has denied this story.\n\nIt is related of Jean Jacques Rousseau that once when he was wal"
