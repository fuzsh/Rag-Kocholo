This document provides background information on the fictional character Sweeney Todd. It summarizes that Sweeney Todd first appeared in the 1846 penny dreadful \"The String of Pearls\" as a villainous barber who murders customers by dropping them through a trapdoor into the basement. He works with Mrs. Lovett, who disposes of the bodies by making them into meat pies. Though some claim Todd was based on a real person, most scholars dispute this. The story has been adapted and retold in many forms, most notably in the Stephen Sondheim musical from 1979.",
