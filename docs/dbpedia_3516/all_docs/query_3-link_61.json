        "meta_description": "Cet article analyse deux versions récentes de l’histoire de Sweeney Todd acclamées par la critique : la comédie musicale de Stephen Sondheim (1979), et le film réalisé par Tim Burton (2007), tous deux intitulés Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (à noter que le film est sorti en France sous le titre de Sweeney Todd : Le Diabolique Barbier de Fleet Street). Ces deux versions sont ici mises en relation avec le texte du penny dreadful original, The String of Pearls: A Romance (1846-47, attribué à James Malcolm Rymer). Cette analyse démontre que plutôt que de simples adaptations, ce sont des cas de « rebooting » ou « reconfiguration » d’après la définition de Ruth Mayer, c’est-à-dire l’utilisation d’un nouveau medium afin de permettre la mise en lumière et l’analyse critique d’une idéologie. Grâce à la malléabilité du genre de la comédie musicale et les nouvelles possibilités offertes par la scène ou l’écran, le Sweeney Todd contemporain présente la critique d’un consumérisme moderne et engage à la réflexion quant aux sensibilités et aux mœurs du XXe siècle. Par son approche néo-victorienne, le récit problématise différent types de changements à l’échelle sociale, et nous permet de mieux comprendre le lien entre la société contemporaine occidentale et son passé victorien, et de l’envisager comme un dialogue plutôt que comme un simple regard vers le passé empreint de nostalgie.",

        "text": "1Penny Dreadful texts are quintessentially linked with traditions of retelling: from the 1830s on, the main tropes of these serial publications revolved around parodying, repeating, re-using and adapting one another as well as famous tales of the time. The pleasure of this “comfort of ritual combined with the piquancy of surprise” (Hutcheon 4) is no doubt one of the key reasons behind the genre’s tremendous popularity. But these hundreds of tales seem to be for the most part confined to the Victorian era (i.e. the period between the 1830s and the turn of the century): while their thematic and narrative persistence combined with material variation secured the Penny Dreadfuls’ central place in the development of literacy and in the democratisation of reading in nineteenth-century Britain, for over a century, and for a variety of ideological as well as cultural reasons, they did not remain part of the changing landscapes of entertainment but for a few exceptions. The tale of Sweeney Todd is one of these exceptions.\n\nFrom sensationalism to humour and tragedy\n\n4The revival of this nineteenth-century text in the second part of the twentieth century brought about a wide range of adjustments and changes, first and foremost in terms of form. The fact that these two versions are the only musical ones is crucial: if the tone clearly shifts between the original version and its twentieth-century interpretations, it is partly because the narration radically changes, from sensationalism to humour and tragedy, thanks to “new”, or rather, different narrative devices introduced by the musical genre, as well as the circulation of musical motifs through the story.\n\nTransposing the cultural anxieties of an era\n\n10Although the original themes of The String of Pearls are topical for its era of publication, putting them into perspective with their treatment (or sometimes non-treatment) in contemporary versions brings to light a dialogue with our Victorian past. As these themes are developed, transformed, furthered, or deleted, their renegotiation questions just how Victorian and/or Neo-Victorian they really are. Are they taken up again to signify a longing for the past, a desire of going back? Or could they be a reaction to history’s cyclicality? What might have appeared to be symptomatic of the cultural anxieties of a precise era becomes crucial to the appeal of the contemporary versions, betraying long-standing resonance and our “continued indebtedness to the nineteenth century, for good or for ill” (Llewellyn 165), while allowing for critical work on the Victorians and ourselves.\n\n12Contemporary productions not only dispense with the string of pearls, but also with the character of Mark Ingestrie. In fact, every character involved in his storyline has either been modified or deleted altogether. Johanna keeps her name and is still at the heart of a romantic plot, but her suitor is now called Anthony Hope. And if the latter arrives to London on a ship, his first song “No Place Like London” only states that he has sailed “from the Dardanelles / To the mountains of Peru” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 7). There is no mention of India specifically, or of the East in general. Any reference to the empire has thus been deleted from contemporary versions, indicating that modern audiences’ interests perhaps lie elsewhere, in more relatable or less political topics such as the other threads that constituted the original story.\n\n14The String of Pearls thus demonstrates a certain awareness of the transformation of society occurring at a dramatic pace. Raymond Williams develops the idea that this is generally the case for literature of the 1840s:\n\nWe can see [the decade] as the decisive period in which the consciousness of a new phase of civilisation was being formed and expressed. The radical transformation of life in Britain, by the extended development of the first Industrial Revolution, by the transformation from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban society, and by the consequent political struggle […] for and against the emergence of an organised working class, was then in its most disturbed and creative phase […]. What comes through most decisively in the [1840s] novels is the consciousness of this transforming, liberating, and threatening time. (Williams 11)\n\n“Such a nice plump frame” (“A Little Priest”, Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 82): cannibalism and commodification\n\n“I’ll cut your throat from ear to ear, if you repeat one word of what passes in this shop, or dare to make any supposition, or draw any conclusion from anything you may see, or hear, or fancy you see or hear. Now you understand me—I’ll cut your throat from ear to ear—do you understand me?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I won’t say nothing. I wish, sir, as I maybe [sic] made into veal pies at Lovett’s in Bell Yard if I as much as says [sic] a word.’ Sweeney Todd rose from his seat; and opening his huge mouth, he looked at the boy for a minute or two in silence, as if he fully intended swallowing him, but had not quite made up his mind where to begin.” (String of Pearls, 3)\n\n17From the start, cannibalism is thus woven into the story as a sensationalist thread which then runs through the whole plot: the narrator repeatedly hints at it, but always interrupts the quasi-revelation to redirect the narrative elsewhere, and the facts are only mentioned directly twice in the Penny Blood. Opening with Toby’s oath of silence and metaphor—or so he thinks—about being “made into veal pies” if he breaks it, the story is actually framed by metaphorical or direct references to anthropophagy. The story indeed closes with a sensational unveiling of the truth, and italics are used to emphasise how literal the threat of cannibalism turns out to be: the narrator reports in the penultimate chapter that Todd would “go down to finish the murder, and—to cut them up for Mrs Lovett’s pies!” (String of Pearls, 277), and Mark finally reveals to the public in the last chapter, fittingly entitled “The Conclusion”: “Ladies and Gentlemen—I fear that what I am going to say will spoil your appetites; but the truth is beautiful at all times, and I have to state that Mrs Lovett’s pies are made of human flesh!” (String of Pearls, 280). The emphasis has been consistently reproduced in all of the tale’s reprints. As the italics leap off the page, they demonstrate the quotes’ significance, stressing the horror of the revelation and the macabre nature of what runs Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett’s business, and therefore, the whole plot.\n\n18In both stage and film adaptations, cannibalism becomes a lot more prominent, perhaps because written sensationalism typical of the Victorian publication fades in favour of the visuality required for a Broadway musical. The narrative structure is different from the penny blood, which opened at a random point in time when Sweeney Todd’s business was already going strong, bringing readers to this tale indirectly because of Johanna’s missing lover. In the musical production, anthropophagy is only introduced at the end of the first act, but then assumes dramatic proportions. Rather than being hinted at, the pie-making process (and what it entails) is made clear as soon as the idea occurs to Mrs Lovett—in fact, the 7-minute long song “A Little Priest” is such a gripping element in the musical that the critic T.E. Kalem, in a New York Theatre Review in 1979, described Sondheim’s production as “one giant step for vegetarianism” (qtd in Zadan 258). Lovett’s first song, “The Worst Pies in London”, already interferes with and indeed desecrates the quintessentially English meat pie that Mack calls one of the most “symbolic products of the island’s culinary heritage” (Mack 11), as it voices the possibility of “popping pussies into pies” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 14) to get by financially. “A Little Priest” takes the idea further, as Todd and Lovett reflect on what to do with the first victim’s body: “And a pussy’s good for maybe six or seven at the most. / And I’m sure they can’t compare as far as taste” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 82). Starting with the idea of not wasting meat while giving the shop a financial boost, the waltz-duet develops into a string of puns. As a result, what was intensely disturbing in the Penny Blood becomes unequivocally tinted with dark humour, and phrases such as “everybody goes down well with beer” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 88) hint at a decidedly different ethos in dealing with such a taboo. As Mack convincingly argues, contemporary audiences enjoy this “illicit engagement with material that we know ought more properly to be treated with greater seriousness, or perhaps not treated at all” (Mack 58): the dark humour running through the plot development is actually intertwined with the production’s melodramatic appeal.\n\n19The central position cannibalism occupies is equally noticeable in the very list of the stage production’s musical numbers. “A Little Priest” happens at the end of the first act, and therefore in the middle of the show as the last song before the intermission; but the second act begins with “God That’s Good”, a song that displays Mrs Lovett’s success as she sells whole batches of pies to delighted customers raving about how delicious they are and asking for her secret. Even as she answers a modest “all to do with herbs” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 99), the audience knows exactly what they are witnessing, since the intermission is framed by those two cannibalistic numbers. As the theme expands, cannibalism becomes a metaphorical practice as well, circulating through the second act and contaminating seemingly non-threatening numbers such as “By The Sea”. Lovett dreams of her future with Todd once financial security is achieved, and sings: “I’m so happy / I could / eat you up, I really could!” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 115), each pause marked by the sound of her kissing Todd. Her mouth physically getting closer to him as she playfully expresses the wish to “eat him up” introduces cannibalism as an erotic metaphor, a means of bringing the person as close as possible both physically and emotionally: the motif invades speech as well as actions, the personal as well as the professional, the romantic as well as the economic aspects of the protagonists’ lives.\n\nThe evolution of characterisation\n\n22In addition to continuing and expanding the critique of society’s structure, contemporary versions of the Sweeney Todd narrative also bring to light deeper social implications through an evolution in the treatment of their characters. If most of the protagonists have kept their names and physical characteristics, their characterisation itself has changed tremendously. Johanna, for example, is at the heart of the romantic subplot in The String of Pearls and still a central part of the adaptations, but for different reasons: from a character only related to Todd through the disappearance of the string of pearls, she turns into one of his blood relatives. As his long-lost daughter, her backstory intertwines with that of Judge Turpin (who does not exist in the penny blood): some fifteen years before the events that the audience witnesses and as she was just a toddler, the Judge wrongfully convicted Sweeney Todd, transported him to Australia, and raped Johanna’s mother Lucy, thereby driving her insane. Since then, Johanna has been Turpin’s ward, and is kept under lock and key until he can eventually marry her. This character is the symbol of Todd’s lost hope, as he sings in his “Epiphany”: “And I’ll never see Johanna, / No, I’ll never hug my girl to me— / Finished!” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 80). This melancholy directly leads to the development of Todd’s thirst for revenge, which is what epitomises the shift in focus and makes the ethos decidedly more contemporary. While this is common to both the musical and the film version, the ‘incestuous’ relationship between the Judge and his ward is treated differently. Though present in both, it is considerably more developed on stage, where he sings his “Mea Culpa”: “The light behind your window— / It penetrates your gown... / Johanna, Johanna, / […] No! / God! / Deliver me!” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 46) as he flagellates himself as a punishment for feeling sexually attracted to the girl he raised. Turpin’s guilt and his religious attempts to redeem himself are absent from the film, as this song is cut, and the ‘incestuous’ relationship is more understated: the idea of marrying Johanna and trying to seduce her is still present but any outspoken sexual attraction towards her disappears. This potentially hints at Hollywood’s taboos: while the film is certainly not aiming at the broadest possible audience, given that it was actually rated R for “graphic bloody violence”, the moral implications of the Judge’s incestuous desires seem to have been hard to reconcile for the mainstream film industry.\n\n23What is more, the evolution of Johanna as a character shows a rather paradoxical take on female agency. Sondheim’s musical first depicts a disconsolate girl, who is held prisoner by the Judge and whose only contact with the outside world is with a woman regularly passing her window and selling caged birds. From the moment she meets Anthony, she becomes a lot more active as they plan to elope together (“Kiss Me”). When the Judge sends her to an asylum to prevent her from leaving, she ends up shooting the warden herself during her rescue mission as Anthony does not dare to. Burton’s film, by contrast, strips her from this agency as she watches the other inmates attack the warden; and brings Johanna back as an incarnation of the “angel in the house”, to an extent that even the Victorian text did not force on her. After all, The String of Pearls has her act as one of the investigators on the case of Mark’s disappearance; for this purpose, she even meets alone in the city with an ex-Army captain. By comparison, the film, although much more recent, only ever shows a passive Johanna, who follows instructions but never displays any form of initiative—the damsel in distress ends up rescued by Anthony and does not contribute to organising their elopement.\n\n24Mrs Lovett, too, loses some of her agency compared to the original Victorian text, this time in both modern versions. The Penny Blood depicts an independent and greedy woman as the barber’s efficient business partner, and describes their relationship as a “bond of union” (String of Pearls, 262) with a “love of money” (String of Pearls, 141) Lovett ends up murdered by Todd, poisoned for the mere reason that he does not wish to share profits made by selling the string of pearls: “dividing […] is a process I don’t intend exactly to go through. No, no, Mrs Lovett, no, no” (String of Pearls, 251). Nevertheless, in both contemporary versions, Mrs Lovett has a new motivation for associating with Todd: the hope of a romantic relationship. She is still a very dynamic character, and the one to suggest selling cannibalistic meat pies, thereby originating their lucrative business plan; her “capitalist ethic” and quick wit are in constant calculation of self-interest (Mollin 410). Yet all this comes to be justified by her feelings for Todd. She is depicted as having been attracted to him even before he was separated from his wife: “Always had a fondness for you, I did” (“My Friends”, Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 20). Once their business becomes successful, she begins to dream of their potential future as a couple and of domestic respectability: “But a seaside wedding / Could be devised, / Me rumpled bedding / Legitimised” (“By The Sea”, Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 118). The scene for “By The Sea” even includes Toby on Mrs Lovett’s dream picnic blanket, giving her a chance at motherhood and at a “proper” family—but Burton’s chromatic choices decidedly mark this scene as a fantasy, as vividly unreal as its colours are garish, standing out from the main narrative’s palette. The addition of a romantic longing for a conventional bourgeois existence to the financial interests of her greedy Victorian counterpart paradoxically marks a clear modern shift in contemporary ethos, in an era when falling in love and settling down is deemed a successful future. In spite of the progress women have made since the Victorian era in terms of independence and opportunities, both in the personal and the professional spheres, these contemporary versions tend towards a traditional and even reactionary vision of gender roles with both main female characters.\n\n“Who could see how the road would twist?” (Sondheim and Wheeler, Sweeney Todd, 133): completing a transmedial trajectory\n\n29Finally, the character of Sweeney Todd recently completed its transmedial circulation, as it reintegrated the medium of literature in 2012 in Terry Pratchett’s novel Dodger. In this— once again—Neo-Victorian story, Sweeney Todd is a barber but also a veteran, traumatized by the Napoleonic Wars. He suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, which leads him to murder customers whom he believes to be dead soldiers coming back to life; and when Dodger helps arrest him, he gets him sent to Bedlam rather than to the gallows, arguing that “Mister Todd himself was a casualty of those wars, just as were the men in his cellar” (Pratchett 149). His mental health now prisoner in servitude of another “dark and vengeful god”, the character is cleared of all moral responsibility for his actions, and his status as a victim is equated to his own murder victims, building on the notion of psychological trauma introduced by the twentieth-century musical narrative analysed in this essay and perpetuating a vitriolic portrait of society’s governing forces. From the Victorian page, to the stage, to the screen, and back to a twenty-first century page, the tale of Sweeney Todd has come full circle, developing and enriching its critique and artistic potential as it circulates further and continues to invade our contemporary popular culture."
