        "text": "“Yes, I make them spick and span to meet their sweethearts. Lovely lot of throats, the lot of them. Beautiful throats! Rich and mellow to a razor.”\n\nTwo of my absolute favourite characters in any medium are the notorious psychopath barber Sweeney Todd, and Mrs Lovatt, his partner in crime who finds a new use for his victims’ bodies. Since their first appearance in the penny dreadful serial, The String of Pearls — published between 1846–1847, possibly written by James Malcolm Rymer and/or Thomas Peckett Prest, a pairing that also produced the elephantine Varney the Vampire — their exploits have entertained audiences the world over. The story of Sweeney and Lovett just grab the mind of creatives with its potential and there have been scores of reworkings in the years since.\n\nBest known is of course Stephen Sondheim’s dark musical thriller, first staged in 1979 — which I absolutely love — but, for me, the most gleeful and unabashedly fun version is this 1936 film version, starring the legendary ham, Tod Slaughter."
