        "text": "2012 was a good year for Tim Burton. Dark Shadows and Frankenweenie, both directed by Burton (the latter a greatly expanded stop-motion re-make of his 1984 short) were released, as was Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, produced by Burton and directed by Timur Bekmambetov from the novel by Seth Grahame-Smith. While Abraham Lincoln reflects current trends in popular horror — a crowded, image consuming, multimedia marketplace, characterized by kinetic violence and genre hybridization — Dark Shadows and Frankenweenie are pure Burton: stylized narratives that are at once traditional and highly idiosyncratic. Although he clearly revisits earlier material with Frankenweenie, Dark Shadows is arguably just as much a return to source for Burton. In common with much of Burton’s work, the film is a re-working of a popular but weird source from his childhood. Dark Shadows was a Gothic soap opera that aired after school on ABC from 1966 to 1971, running to 1,225 episodes. The show was the brainchild of Dan Curtis, who, like Edward D. Wood Jr., another Burton hero, updated the traditional Gothic on a shoestring budget, albeit much more successfully than the tragic director of Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959). Because it was taped and broadcast so quickly, the show had the unintentional feel of a low-budget horror film, complete with booms showing and actors upsetting Styrofoam tombstones. The original plot felt like Ann Radcliffe in a contemporary setting, but the show was enlivened in 1967 by the introduction of Barnabas Collins, a morally ambivalent character somewhere between Maturin’s Gothic immortal Melmoth the Wanderer and Rymer’s Varney the Vampire. Peyton Place met Dracula, and in terms of fantastic television, Barnabas Collins was as iconic in the sixties as Captain Kirk and Batman. Burton’s version of Dark Shadows follows the original Barnabas story arc quite closely, transplanted to 1972 in a nod to Hammer’s Dracula: AD 1972 (Alan Gibson, 1972). Performances are camp, catching the essence of the show, with Johnny Depp playing Barnabas Collins as straight as Adam West’s interpretation of Batman. There is also the gallows and cartoon humor that characterize the best Burton projects, as well as the director’s usual affinity for the isolated loner in the hostile universe, Depp’s clueless Barnabas recalling his Edward Scissorhands. Period detail, trash culture, and Gothic theatricality are referenced with a cameo from Alice Cooper, now, like Burton, his own cultural code. Visually, Burton returns to the marriage of theatrical melodrama and expressionism that epitomizes Gothic cinema — the death of Barnabas on the sublime Widow’s Hill worthy of Murnau or Whale. The history of Gothic film can be read in Dark Shadows, as it can in all of Burton’s work, referenced, reproduced, and refined as the codes of the literary and cinematic Gothic are combined with surprising childhood sources, so that Edgar Allan Poe meets Dr. Seuss, and slamming the Rankin/Bass seasonal television special into The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari suddenly makes perfect sense. This esoteric vision is already strongly realized in Burton’s earliest work for Disney, the stop-motion short Vincent (1982). Burton’s signature style is already present, a labyrinthine semiology of intertextual connections and cultural retrieval. There is a rejection of the suburban and an identification with the other throughout — key themes at the heart of Burton’s subsequent work in both modes of production, animation and live action — and the pseudo-autobiographical desire to be “just like Vincent Price,” expressed by a creative and alienated child, can be applied as a model and a metaphor for the contextualization of Burton’s work within the broad genre of Gothic film. As Burton now returns to black and white stop-motion animation with his re-make of Frankenweenie, Vincent remains the key to cracking the Enigma Code of Burton’s unique aesthetic. To understand Burton, we must understand Vincent.\n\nWhat (or whom) would you be willing to eat? My research examines anthropophagy (human cannibalism) in the movies: is it gratuitous and included for shock value, or does it cast light onto our most profound cultural and moral assumptions and taboos? Eating choices are determined by social and cultural identities, and normative gustatory practices vary widely between cultures, but reification or commodification of our proposed prey is standard. When applied to humans, it is shocking, because of our assumed, largely unexamined singularity. I examine how this is culturally inculcated in a selection of English-language feature films by looking at different iterations of anthropophagy – survivalism (necessitated by catastrophe or dystopian social collapse), the primitive savage of colonial discourses, the inhuman psychopath and the opportunistist. Incorporation of humans is abject, and disturbs our deepest social and cultural agreements. My research is driven by my animal activism and a desire to define and challenge the humanist, Cartesian, belief that humans are ontologically non-animal. Anthropophagy is, at its most basic, about treating humans as meat. I am using a critical paradigm, where assumed dualisms (e.g. human/animal, civilised/savage, sane/psychopathic) are deconstructed and examined through the plots and production techniques of selected films and the ways they’re received and interpreted. Interdisciplinary methodologies of film studies and cultural studies are used to examine how incidents are intensified or trivialised. Anthropophagy points to the need to limit voraciousness of appetite in a world reaching environmental resource saturation. I argue that the abjection experienced by viewers comes from abhorrence of the objectification of humans, and that the anthropophagous film unconsciously aids in deconstructing the human/animal binary and deobjectifying the sentient “other”, and thus recognising the damage done to the environment, our fellow creatures and each other through the use of the rhetoric of animality."
