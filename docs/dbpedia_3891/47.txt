Biography[]

Born in Blackheath, London, Holland was a founding member of UK pop band Squeeze which was formed in March 1974. Holland played the keyboard with the group until 1980 when Holland left to forge a solo career; the band temporarily broke up in 1982.

Holland began issuing solo records in 1978 and continued through the early 1980s. He then became a co-presenter on the Newcastle-based TV music show The Tube with Paula Yates and appeared in the sitcom "The Groovy Fellers". In 1985 Squeeze reformed and Holland was once again the keyboard player for the band until 1990 before returning to his solo career as both a musician and a TV host. On the side, he formed the Jools Holland Big Band with Gilson Lavis from Squeeze, which gradually became his 18-piece Rhythm & Blues Orchestra.

Between 1988 and 1990 he performed on two seasons of the acclaimed music performance program Sunday Night on NBC late-night television. Since 1992 he has presented the eclectic music program Later with Jools Holland, plus an annual New Year's Eve "Hootenanny".
