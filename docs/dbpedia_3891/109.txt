Julian Miles Holland was born in Blackheath, south London, on January 24, 1958.

He started playing piano at an early age, and was a founding member of Squeeze in 1974.

The band had a string of hits, but Jools left in 1981 to pursue a solo career, although he did rejoin the band when they reformed, eventually breaking up for a second time in 1990.

He formed his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra in 1987, and theyâ€™ve toured and recorded albums consistently since.

Jools still lives in Blackheath, and is married with four children.
