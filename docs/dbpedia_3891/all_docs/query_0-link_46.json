        "meta_description": "One month ago, Sister Midnight launched a community share offer in a bid to save The Ravensbourne Arms and create Lewisham’s  first community-owned live music venue and pub. Since then, the community has invested in over £50,000 towards the campaign, including a boost from Jools Holland, meaning the king of boogie-woogie will be a shareholder of the soon to be reborn Ravensbourne – and anyone can join him.\n\n\n\nBorn in neighbouring Blackheath, pianist, bandleader Jools Holland first found fame in the band Squeeze, whose formative years were spent in the locale – they even named an early EP ‘Deptford Fun City’ for another of Lewisham’s near neighbours. Jools’ investment represents the die-hard commitment to the musical arts that’s kept Later... on TV screens for 29 years.\n\n\n\nFollowing his investment into the Ravensbourne Arms campaign, Jools Holland said - \n\n\n\n\"The music scene of South East London means a great deal to me. It's where I came from - it's where I come out of. And that's why I want to support the Ravensbourne Arms. I invested and you can too. What harm can it do?\"\n\n\n\n Campaign leader Lenny Watson says -\n\n\n\n“The support we’ve seen from across our community and the music industry has been overwhelming, we’re just so grateful to everyone who’s got behind this project. Having Jools Holland backing the campaign has been incredible, it means so much that people from all walks of life support our vision for Lewisham’s first community owned live music pub, and are helping to make it happen.”\n\n\n\nOther artists to have invested in the #SaveTheRavensbourneArms campaign include Fontaines D.C, Goat Girl, and Porridge Radio, who also played Sister Midnight’s 2 October fundraiser gig alongside a line-up of emerging talent, thrilling the crowd with a total one-off acoustic set (on account of an absent drummer!).\n\n\n\nThe next fundraiser will take place on Tuesday 26 October at Matchstick Piehouse in Deptford, London with live performances from Tony Njoku, Garden Centre, and Lobby. Tickets are £10 with all proceeds going straight into the Ravensbourne Arms campaign. Those who cannot afford the ticket fee are still welcome to come down and enjoy the evening. \n\n\n\nThe community has been offered a chance to invest in a campaign that will make history for the independent music scene in the UK. \n\n\n\nTo read more about the Ravensbourne Arms campaign please see below or visit: www.sistermidnight.org.\n\n\n\nIn order to purchase, refurbish, and re-open the Ravensbourne Arms, Sister Midnight are looking to source a minimum of £500K through a community share offer on the Crowdfunder platform,  with rewards for investors such as gig tickets, merch, vinyl, experiences and one-off artwork, and – yes – beer.\n\n\n\nIt's a big, beautiful, tiled old gent of a pub in a booming area underserved by boozers, but since its former owners called time in 2016, the Ravensbourne Arms has been shuttered. It’s been a great loss not just to the locals but to the NHS staff of the Lewisham Hospital across the road (side note: they’re the ones whose choir had two Number One hits). Lewisham is in the middle of a housing boom. Brand new glass tower blocks loom over the town. But at street level, the community is starved of places to gather - and of places to see live music. \n\n\n\nParachuting into this situation with a mission not just to rescue this beloved pub, but to preserve it for the community and establish it as an events space and grassroots live music venue, is a former grassroots music venue led by group of three remarkable young women, under the name Sister Midnight; having lost their Deptford venue space during lockdown, they are now on a mission to  reinstate the Ravensbourne Arms as a community owned live music pub. That means all profit will be reinvested into the pub, forever, because Community Pubs are run for and by locals with established democratic processes for governance. With a Community Pub, the few don't get richer, we all do - culturally, socially and communally. Maybe even physically - but only if you attend the daytime yoga sessions!\n\n\n\nInspired by The Ivy House in nearby Nunhead, the nation's first Community Pub and now the well-established, well-loved South-East London stalwart that brings joy to it's Peckham neighbourhood, the group has gathered the support and information needed to untangle the bureaucracy required to save this pub for the people. \n\n\n\nLenny Watson, Verity Hobbs and Sophie Farrell, each in their 20s, have already achieved astonishing things, from shoring up support among the local political establishment to getting one of the hottest bands on the South London scene, Goat Girl, to headline their first fundraiser event in August. Proceeds of that show, which took place at The Ivy House, went towards the campaign's mounting expenses, including legal fees. \n\n\n\nFormerly known as The Coach & Horses, the Ravensbourne Arms has a chequered past. In an area that saw its share of tension as London's society evolved rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century, it was blighted by associations to the National Front. The so-called Battle Of Lewisham, when NF marched from New Cross to Lewisham in 1977 and violently clashed with anti-racists and police, was plotted in places such as this. \n\n\n\nSister Midnight hope to change the pub's story for good, reviving it as a safe, inclusive, all-day space that puts the local community - the entire community, in all its glorious forms - at the heart of everything they do. This means activities for babies and the elderly and everyone in between. \n\n\n\nCentral to the mission will be fostering the incredible music talent in the area, which is home to grime and drill artists, art-school bands and the ever-rising, youth-powered jazz scene. This will be a continuation of Sister Midnight's operations in nearby Deptford, where the collective opened a grassroots music venue, record shop and bar , sadly, became unviable during the pandemic due to issues with the building. \n\n\n\nWith locals now able to invest directly into the pub themselves following a community share offer launching on September 20th, the campaign to save this incredible venue as a community resource looks almost unstoppable.The key however, is getting as many people involved as investors in the pub. \n\n\n\nIt was noted at the time that had the local press in Lewisham not been decimated - just as it has across the nation - then the overnight closure of this great pub might not have been allowed to happen unchecked. We'd like your help to make sure that all eyes are this campaign to right that wrong.\n\n\n\n2022 is Lewisham's year as London's Borough Of Culture. This campaign to save the Ravensbourne Arms aims to make every year a year of culture in this vibrant, up-and-coming, community-minded, multi-cultural and economically challenged part of London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT FROM LONDON’S LEADING CULTURAL FIGUREHEADS\n\n\n\nVicky Foxcroft, MP for Lewisham Deptford - “As the MP for Lewisham Deptford I am pleased to support Sister Midnight's project to take over the Ravensbourne Arms as a Community Benefit Society. This is such an amazing opportunity to revive a currently unused venue in a way which puts the community it is based in at its heart and provide exciting cultural opportunities which are accessible for local residents.\n\n\n\nI am also happy to see such a great project lead by young women, who are too often not at the forefront of projects like these.” \n\n\n\nAmy Lamé, Night Czar, London - \"There has been a pub on the site of the Ravensbourne Arms on Lewisham High Street since the 1750s. But sadly this venue, which has enormous potential, is currently sat empty. Sister Midnight, a  community benefit society, is working to save the Ravensbourne by bringing it into community ownership as an accessible, affordable and inclusive live music pub. From an early stage in the consultation process, Sister Midnight has received an overwhelmingly positive response from the local community, demonstrating a huge appetite for a community owned live music space in Lewisham.\n\n\n\nMusic, community, pub culture and inclusivity are at the heart of Sister Midnight's vision. I look forward to working closely with them to bring this fantastic project to fruition.\" \n\n\n\nCllr Mark Ingleby, Chair, Lewisham Creative Legacy Taskforce 2021 - “Sister Midnight’s bid to revive both the pub and its live music at The Ravensbourne Arms is both timely and critical to maintaining the impetus of the upcoming 2022 London Borough of Culture year in the Borough, and it is emblematic of the community-driven enterprise that is vital to growing and securing Lewisham’s unique cultural and creative industries  opportunity.\n\n\n\nThe Ravensbourne Arms project lies in a key location in both  the vicinity and the networks of other Lewisham pubs and venues that have achieved national recognition in jazz and urban music, for the role they have played and will play in the growth of exceptional musical talent that is crucial to the legacy of the Borough of Culture Year.\n\n\n\nThis is a very timely opportunity, not to be missed, to add to these special venues and what they can do for our Borough.” \n\n\n\nGoat Girl - “We first got involved with the Ravensbourne Arms through being regulars at Sister Midnight’s venue in Deptford. That’s where we got introduced to Lenny and the music scene that thrived from the space. We were saying the other day that our social life has been at an all time low not having Sister Midnight round the corner anymore because it's the place that you would find everyone at doing lots of different side projects, music, art and film, and cool stuff\n\n\n\nThis idea that Lenny has is just like such a dream, it’s what the world needs, and we’re very excited for it. Without these spaces and enthusiastic people like Lenny, as musicians and bands who are now able to tour and play at festivals, we wouldn't have any of that so it is really truly down to these people and these places that allow it to exist in the first place.\n\n\n\nHaving community run venues is so important, especially now with all the venues that are closing basically because of gentrification. With the model that Sister Midnight are pushing for being community owned, it’s not in the hands of big landlords, and that’s really important as we need to have these spaces and everyone in the community having their say on what goes on because these spaces should be for all different types of people that live in that area.” \n\n\n\nDan Stubbs, former Deputy Editor, NME - \"The music scene is one of Britain's last great industries, but a combo-kicking from Brexit and the pandemic has taken its toll on those who nurture it. Small venues are the soil from which world-beating artists grow. The talent pool in South East London is second to none, but - with no disrespect to the wonderful Fox & Firkin - the infrastructure in Lewisham is sorely lacking. This campaign to save the Ravensbourne Arms is not only welcomed, it's essential. So as a local, as a music lover and as a music journalist, I am backing this amazing, altruistic enterprise all the way. The revolution starts here!\" \n\n\n\nLenny Watson, Founder of Sister Midnight - “Sister Midnight has always been about providing a vital platform for musicians and creatives in the early stages of their careers, and it’s what we built a reputation for at our venue in Deptford. When the effects of the pandemic forced us to close down that site and look for a new venue, we set out to create a space for live music that would be sustainable long term. Music venues and pubs are important community assets, and we believe that they should be owned and controlled by the communities they exist in. We need to take the future of grassroots music venues out of the hands of landlords, who all too often only care about the rent they get paid, and make sure that venues are protected for generations to come. That’s why we became a community benefit society, and why we’re asking our community to invest in Sister Midnight and become a part owner of a local music venue. We want to save the Ravensbourne arms and make it a space where our community has a say in how things are done, and where we can carry on showcasing the best creative talent that Lewisham has to offer.” \n\n\n\nTHE NEXT RAVENSBOURNE ARMS FUNDRAISER: Tuesday 26 October 2021 / Doors 7pm at the Matchstick Piehouse, Deptford\n\n\n\nLive music from Tony Njoku, Garden Centre, Lobby\n\n\n\nAll money goes towards the campaign to save the Ravensbourne Arms.\n\n\n\nTickets are £10 and can be bought here",
