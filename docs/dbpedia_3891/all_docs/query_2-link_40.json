I love being part of the team for Jools' Radio 2 Show, it's so fascinating listening to all the guests and their influences in music……..not sure how much I enjoy going down in to the bowels of Jools' studio for the archives though!! More info\n\nSaxophone player and arranger Phil Veacock was born in High Wycombe Buckinghamshire in 1964. His first adventures in music began when he was at primary school and learned the descant recorder. He became somewhat obsessed with this instrument and something of a virtuoso, sometimes playing it with his nose. With a few other children he became part of the recorder ensemble that would play in assembly every day. “It set us apart from the rest of the rabble and seriously coloured my worldview leading to me wanting to witness Life from the bandstand ever since.” he says. Parallel to this, he joined the church choir where he rose through the ranks to become head chorister, the most angelic-looking and thus best paid. But the recorder was proving not to be enough. His nose had begun to hurt.
