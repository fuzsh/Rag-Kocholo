        "text": "Pianist extraordinaire Jools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra are performing in Castlebar’s Royal Theatre next October. Special guests on the night will include icon of the ’80s Alison Moyet.\n\nThe gig gives Mayo audiences the chance to see for themselves what BB King was talking about when he said “I didn’t think anybody could play like that. Jools has got that left hand that never stops.”\n\nA Jool in The Royal’s crown\n\nCiara Moynihan\n\nHave you ever seen the ivories tickled until you thought they’d jump off the piano in ecstasy? No? Well then you have yet to see Jools Holland play. Happily, audiences in the west will have the chance to do exactly that next October 21, when Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra come to Castlebar to play in The Royal Theatre.\n\nThe date in Mayo is one of only two the band is playing in Ireland as part of their 2010 world tour (the other being in Dublin). For their performances here and in the UK they will be joined by one of Britain’s most enduring and acclaimed vocalists, Alison Moyet. Commenting on the decision to feature Moyet, Holland explained: “Her voice is truly unique and has a blues and soul quality that fits perfectly into the Rhythm & Blues Orchestra party.”\n\nBorn Julian Miles Holland on January 24, 1958, in Blackheath, South East London, the iconic composer, pianist, bandleader and broadcaster has been a familiar figure on television since he co-hosted the groundbreaking and irreverent live-music show ‘The Tube’ in the early ’80s. But his musical tenure is much longer than that.\n\nAt the age of eight, Holland could play the piano fluently by ear, and by the time he reached his early teens he was proficient and confident enough to be appearing regularly in many of the pubs in South East London and the East End Docks.\n\nAt the age of 15, Holland was introduced to Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford, and together they formed Squeeze. Shortly afterwards they were joined by drummer Gilson Lavis (who had already played with, among others, BB King, Chuck Berry and Max Wall). Lavis still drums with Holland today.\n\nAlthough Squeeze have sold millions of records (their biggest hit probably being ‘Up the Junction’), the most successful record Holland ever played on was ‘Good Thing’ by The Fine Young Cannibals. The song reached Number 1 in 17 countries. Holland received the statutory session fee of £150.\n\nThe Tube ended in January 1987 in the middle of its fifth series. The show’s removal from Channel 4 has been attributed to Holland’s use of the phrase ‘be there, or be ungroovy fu**ers’ during a live trailer aired during peak children’s-viewing time. The station took the show off air for three weeks and gave Holland a warning. A sixth series was never commissioned.\n\nThankfully for lovers of good live music, that was not the end of Holland’s broadcasting career, and he has been hosting ‘Later… with Jools Holland’ on BBC2 since 1992. The show, which re-awakened the innovative spirit of The Tube, has just completed its 35th series.\n\nDuring that time it has featured an encyclopaedic goodie bag of great live acts, including Joan Baez, John Martyn, KD Lang, Baaba Maal, Smokey Robinson, Nick Cave, Mary Coughlan, Johnny Cash, Portishead, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, Metallica, Burning Spear, Radiohead, Bjork, Rufus Wainright, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, Moby, Foo Fighters, Elbow, Amy Winehouse, Seasick Steve, Tom Jones, Florence & The Machine, Muse, Gladys Knight, Kings of Leon, James Taylor and The Specials – to name a few! The mix of acts on any given night is often eclectic to say the least. It’s not often you’d see PJ Harvey and Lionel Richie share the same stage on the same night.\n\nThroughout all of this, Holland finds time to tour with his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra, sometimes for unusual audiences. They once performed ‘All You Need is Love’ for the leaders of the western world at a G8 Conference. Hilariously, on hearing the trumpet intro, Jacques Chirac mistook it for the opening of the French national anthem and stood up. Unsure of the protocol, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin also stood. Once they realised it was The Beatles’ song, and in an desperate effort to save face, they carried on standing – only joining hands and swaying their hips in a pretence at dancing that would not have fooled the most sheltered of nuns.\n\nThere’s not many acts that can lay claim to prompting powerful political figureheads to make complete eejits out of themselves to the backdrop of a ‘peace and love’ revolution anthem of the 1960s.\n\nHappily, audiences in Castlebar can rest assured that they’ll be on their feet for different reasons. Speaking about this year’s gigs, Holland said they are “shaping up to be some of our best shows yet.”\n\nAnd when the legendary leader of a band renowned for bringing the ultimate party experience to the stage says that, you know you’re in for a good night.\n\nWin tickets to see Jools Holland\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW"
