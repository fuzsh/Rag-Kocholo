        "text": "Handshake Ltd are delighted to announce that Jools Holland OBE, one of the biggest names in British music, will be bringing his world famous Rhythm & Blues Orchestra to Chepstow Castle on Saturday 27th August 2016 as part of the Castell Roc festival.\n\nBorn Julian Miles Holland on January 24, 1958 in Blackheath, South East London, Jools could play the piano fluently by ear by the age of eight. By the time he reached his early teens he was proficient and confident enough to be appearing regularly in many of the pubs in South East London and the East End Docks.\n\nAt the age of 15 Jools was introduced to Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford and together they formed Squeeze. Shortly afterwards the trio were joined by Gilson Lavis, who to this day still drums with Jools.\n\nIn 1987 Jools formed The Jools Holland Big Band, comprising himself and Gilson Lavis. This has gradually metamorphosed into the current 20-piece Jools Holland and His Rhythm & Blues Orchestra, which consists of pianist, organist, drummer, three female vocalists, guitar, bass guitar, two tenor saxophones, two alto saxophones, baritone saxophone, three trumpets, and four trombones.\n\nJools has performed with some of the world’s greatest musicians over the years, and made numerous programmes for radio and TV, including his legendary annual New Year’s Eve Hootenanny.\n\nJoining Jools at Chepstow Castle will be special guest Marc Almond and guest vocalists Ruby Turner, Louise Marshall and Beth Rowley.\n\nJools and his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra continue to dazzle audiences across the globe with their exuberant and energetic live performances.\n\nThis is a guaranteed Summer’s evening not to be missed in the magical setting of Chepstow Castle!"
