Blige and David Bowie found a regular welcome, alongside the next generation of superstars including Adele, Ed Sheeran and Amy Winehouse. Part of what has made the show so special is the format – all those bands, singers, stars and newbies brought together to listen as well as to perform in Jools’ circle of dreams.\n\nBut there’s always been plenty of mayhem alongside the magic of convening a room full of musicians hosted by one of their own.\n\nDon’t miss an unforgettable night with Jools and Mark as they pull back the curtain on classic performances to reveal that the show is just as magical, if even more chaotic, than you imagined."
