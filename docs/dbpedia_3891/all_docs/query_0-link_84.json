        "text": "Following a triumphant show in Dublin last year, Jools Holland has announced an intimate Cork date with his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra taking place later this year.\n\nJoining Jools in the Cork Opera House are Gilson Lavis, Ruby Turner, Louise Marshall and another special guest to be confirmed.\n\nThe gig takes place on Thursday, October 17. Tickets cost €69 and go on sale at 10am on Tuesday, February 26.\n\nJools’ recent 3Arena show, featured the iconic Marc Almond and was considered a highpoint of the musical year for all who attended.\n\nJools Holland was born in 1958 in Blackheath, South East London.\n\nAt the age of eight, he could play the piano fluently by ear, and by the time he reached his early teens he was proficient and confident enough to be appearing regularly in many of the pubs in South East London and the East End Docks.\n\nIn 1987, he formed The Jools Holland Big Band and has been noted since then for his live performances and prolific recording career."
