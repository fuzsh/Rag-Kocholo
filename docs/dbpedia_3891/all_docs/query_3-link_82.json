        "text": "It's called 'Swing Fever'\n\nIn December 2023, Sir Rod Stewart and Jools Holland announced a brand new album will be released in February 2024. The album, called 'Swing Fever', will see the pair unite for 13 songs including classic songs such as 'Ain't Misbehavin‚Äô', 'Frankie And Johnny‚Äô, 'Sentimental Journey' and 'Lullaby Of Broadway‚Äô.\n\nAs well as announcing the exciting news on social media, the pair also surprised commuters at a busy London station. The duo brought the full band to the concourse in St Pancras and performed their new song 'Almost Like Being In Love' to the surprised members of the public.\n\nFans took to social media to share their excitement at the upcoming album, one wrote: 'Still the coolest cat in the room!!! Would have loved to have been there!! Happy Holidays to you and yours Sir Rod!!! üå≤‚ùÑÔ∏è', another commented: 'Sir Rod Stewart, you remain such a special star, so close to your fans, loving and respecting your audience, in addition to being an amazing enterteiner and a very, very talented artist...Always unique... This was a very sweet surprise... Thank you...' (sic)\n\nSir Rod also shared the announcement news writing: 'Jools Holland and I are very excited to present our brand new album Swing Fever üé∑üé∂ A 13-track sparkling salute to the timeless songs of the big band years ‚ú® The album will be released 23rd February and is available to pre-order now on various formats: https://lnk.to/SwingFever'.\n\nSitting down together, Jools said: \"I was just packing up to go away for Christmas, and you rang me. We hadn't really spoken at any length before. I thought 'I love Rod, how exciting,' and you said 'I want to do a record.' I'd been a fan of Rod forever but we realised with the old music that we liked a lot of the same things.\"\n\nRod then added: \"I'd already started making a swing album, but it didn't turn out how I wanted it. It was more Frank Sinatra than it was Louis Prima, let's say. So I cancelled that, and then I realised the guy I should go to is Jools. Also, our fanatical model railway enthusiasm bonded us together. So we started recording.\"\n\nSpeaking about their new single, which is ‚ÄòAlmost Like Being In Love‚Äô, written by Frederick Loewe, and made famous by Frank Sinatra & Nat King Cole, Jools admitted: \"I didn't really know that song, but it's one of my favourites now.\n\n\"I looked up the different versions of it, and there are loads. What we try and do is get to the essence of it. If there are lots of complicated chords, we get rid of those and just play the simple ones.\n\n\"There's a John Lee Hooker record where he's teaching the blues, and he says 'Listen children, throw all those fancy chords away. Just play the one chord, make that sound good, then you can think about playing another one.'\n\n\"We also spoke about trying to make it a bit Django Reinhardt-esque, and we got a guy from Liverpool called Gary Potter, who's like the top Django guy. He's really great, he's got the spirit of Django.\"\n\nWhen is 'Swing Fever' released?\n\nThe album will be released on 23rd February 2024, and is available to pre-order now. Two songs from the album 'Almost Like Being In Love' and 'Ain't Misbehavin'' are available to buy now.\n\nWhat formats is 'Swing Fever' available on?\n\n'Swing Fever' is available on Black Vinyl, Colour Vinyl, CD & Digital.\n\nWhat is the tracklist?\n\n'Swing Fever' includes 13 songs, the full list is below.\n\n'Lullaby Of Broadway'\n\n'Oh Marie'\n\n'Sentimental Journey'\n\n'Pennies From Heaven'\n\n'Night Train'\n\n'Love Is The Sweetest Thing'\n\n'Them There Eyes'\n\n'Good Rockin‚Äô Tonight'\n\n'Ain‚Äôt Misbehavin‚Äô'\n\n'Frankie And Johnny'\n\n'Walkin‚Äô My Baby Back Home'\n\n'Almost Like Being In Love'\n\n'Tennessee Waltz'\n\nTake a look through Jazz FM artists then and now:\n\nNow read:\n\nMOBO Awards: The full list of nominations\n\nJury rules handwritten note found in Aretha Franklin's sofa is a valid Will\n\nLove Supreme 2024: Line-up Announced\n\nHow to listen to Jazz FM:\n\nListen to Jazz FM across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, via the play button below and by asking your smart speaker to \"play Jazz FM\"."
