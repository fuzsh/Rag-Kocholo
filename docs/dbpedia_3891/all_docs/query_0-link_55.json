        "text": "What got you started?\n\nHearing my uncle play Sister Rosetta Tharpe's Up Above My Head on the piano. I was only eight, but I wanted to jump up and down with excitement; it was as if all the chaos of the universe had come into order. Whenever I listen to music now, I'm still looking for that feeling.\n\nWhich one song would work as the soundtrack to your life?\n\nAin't It Grand to Be Blooming Well Dead by the London music hall artist Leslie Sarony.\n\nYou've worked with drummer Gilson Lavis for 35 years. How important is it to establish long-term relationships with other musicians?\n\nIf you like the way they play, it's very important. When you play with somebody for a long period, it's like having a good friend: you just start to play, and you can communicate without using the blunt instruments that are words.\n\nYou're well known as a TV presenter and broadcaster as well as a musician. How much has music broadcasting changed in the course of your career?\n\nNext year, I will have been broadcasting music on TV for 30 years, which makes me feel wizened. The biggest change I've seen is that there's just less of it: my Later . . . show is pretty much the only serious music programme around. The commercial channels don't really take music seriously. They think it's all about competition, when music is really about the intensity with which it is played.\n\nWhat have you sacrificed for your art?\n\nIt's a very selfish business, the music business. In the pursuit of getting people that are really great to play with, you sometimes have to sack good friends because they're not playing the way you want. That's a painful thing to do.\n\nWhich other artists do you admire?\n\nI like the buildings of John Vanbrugh very much. I've got the same birthday as him, and I like the fact he was also a playwright and a spy; as someone with lots of jobs, I can identify with that.\n\nWhat's your favourite film?\n\nI watch almost exclusively British and European films; I started with the silent films, and I'm moving forward. The important thing for me isn't the script, but what I'm seeing. A nice cut of a jacket, or a nice interior: I get giddy on that.\n\nIs there anything about your career you regret?\n\nNo. I think I'm a bit like Edith Piaf.\n\nIn short\n\nBorn: Blackheath, London 1958.\n\nCareer: Started out in the band Squeeze; has since founded the Rhythm and Blues Orchestra; worked as a TV presenter and broadcaster; and released dozens of solo records.\n\nHigh point: \"Managing to maintain, for the last 15 years, a big band that tours the world.\""
