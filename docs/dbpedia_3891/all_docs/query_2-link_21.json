Here’s how Jools Holland became famous and how he got to where he is today.\n\nREAD MORE: Who's on Jools Holland's Hootenanny this year? Lulu, Gregory Porter and Rag'n'Bone Man to perform\n\nWho is Jools Holland?\n\nJools Holland is a television presenter and musician. Born in Blackheath, south-east London, in 1958, he’s been an ever-present fixture on British TV since the 1980s.\n\nHe started out as a session musician, as well as being a founding member of new-wave band Squeeze.\n\nAs a TV presenter, Holland is best known as the host of Later with Jools Holland - the BBC’s flagship live music show - since 1992. The first annual Hootenanny was aired in 1993, and has been a regular New Year’s Eve event ever since.\n\nHow did Jools Holland become famous?\n\nJools Holland first rose to fame as a member of Squeeze.

He co-hosted Channel 4’s legendary music show The Tube - a showcase for up-and-coming as well as world-famous acts - alongside Paula Yates from 1982 to 1987.\n\nHe was recruited by the BBC to host Later in 1992. Before that, from 1988 to 1990, he’d co-hosted a late-night live music show - Sunday Night - for US broadcaster NBC.\n\nHolland returned to Squeeze when the band reformed in 1985, before leaving in 1990.\n\nIn 1987, Holland formed the Jools Holland Big Band, which gradually expanded to become the 18-piece Jools Holland Rhythm and Blues Orchestra of today.\n\nWho is Jools Holland married to and where does he live?\n\nJools Holland married his longtime girlfriend, Christabel McEwen, in 2005. She is the daughter of Scottish folk musician and artist Rory McEwen.\n\nThe couple live in the south-east London suburb of Westcombe Park, where Holland also owns a recording studio, Helicon Mountain.\n\nIn addition, Holland owns a manor house in Cooling, Kent, near the medieval Cooling Castle.\n\nHow much is Jools Holland worth?\n\nJools Holland’s successes as a TV personality and musician have made him a wealthy man. His net worth has been estimated at around £3.7 million."
