        "text": "Jools Holland today launched the second #Platform88 piano as part of the partnership between Yamaha and TfL to bring more music to Tube customers.\n\nThe celebrated musician, broadcaster, composer and big band leader delivered a brilliant solo piano performance at Canary Wharf Tube station, leaving surprised commuters delighted and inspired.\n\nHe then autographed the piano and wrote a special message on it for future pianists.\n\nThe two-year #Platform88 project, which takes its name from the number of keys on a piano, provides opportunities for anyone to play the instruments and entertain fellow passengers.\n\nShowcase talents\n\nDuring the next two years, the pianos will 'commute' around the TfL network, giving millions of passengers the platform to showcase their musical talents.\n\nJools Holland OBE DL is well known to music lovers around the world. He has sold millions of records since he started playing Yamaha pianos 20 years ago, and performs to over 300,000 people each year.\n\nHe also hosts his own BBC Radio 2 programme and presents BBC's 'Later', the most popular music TV show in the UK.\n\nA champion of new musical talent, Jools jumped at the chance to have the second #Platform88 named after him.\n\nHe said: 'I'm thrilled to be a part of #Platform88 and I'm sure this beautiful instrument will provide much enjoyment for players and audiences alike.\n\n'It's amazing how many people can play the piano well and I'd encourage everyone to either have a play or just stop and listen for a while. Who knows who may spot you!'\n\nEnjoyed by thousands\n\nCurrently residing at Tottenham Court Road Tube station, the first #Platform88 piano was launched in November by multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer, Tokio Myers.\n\nIt's now enjoyed by thousands of travellers every day, and plans are in preparation for a third piano to be placed on the Tube network.\n\nAt the end of the programme the pianos will be donated to charity. The Jools Holland piano will go to Music For All, (musicforall.org.uk) for whom Jools is a Patron.\n\nThe charity aims to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn to play an instrument.\n\nOpportunity to learn\n\nLondon Underground's Managing Director, Mark Wild said: 'Music helps to create moments of surprise and delight for our customers when travelling on the Tube.\n\n'We've seen the positive impacts of our busking programme and classical music on stations, and we're excited to provide this opportunity for our customers to bring their musical talents to light.'\n\nYamaha's Charles Bozon said: 'Yamaha is all about enriching people through music making, and we are thrilled that these pianos are providing entertainment and inspiration to thousands.\n\n'We've already received hundreds of stories and pictures of people enjoying the instrument at Tottenham Court Road Tube station and now with the addition of Jools' piano at Canary Wharf Tube station we hope unite even more passengers through music.'\n\nNotes to editors"
