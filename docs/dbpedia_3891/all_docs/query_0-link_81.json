        "text": "There are many stars living in Kent, and one of those is Jools Holland.\n\nThe 63-year-old musician has become a famous face not only from performing, but also from presenting on television.\n\nJools married his girlfriend of 15 years and daughter of famous artist Rory McEwen, Christabel McEwen, in August of 2005, and the pair reside in south east London - but that's not their only home.\n\nRead More: The Dover-born star who's juggled raising three kids with appearance on The Bill and EastEnders\n\nJools and Christabel have a daughter, Mabel Ray Britannia Holland, who followed in her Dad's footsteps and became a musician, while he also has two other children, George and Rosie, with former partner Mary Leahy.\n\nBut now, with his current wife, they own a manor house near Cooling Castle on the Hoo Peninsula, and Jools has become an outspoken lover of the county.\n\nSpeaking to Great British Life last year, he said: \"We are particularly pleased to be performing at Rochester Castle because I think Rochester is one of the most beautiful old cities in the world, a bit of a hidden gem.\"\n\nDespite commonly being known as Jools, his real name is actually Julian, and he was born on January 24 of 1958 in Blackheath.\n\nHis career began as a session musician, recording his first studio session in 1976 alongside Wayne County and the Electric Chairs.\n\nTwo years before that, Jools became a founding member of the pop band Squeeze in which he played the keyboards until deciding to pursue a solo career at the start of the 1980s.\n\nHe went on to release several solo singles through to 1984, before deciding to branch out in the world of television.\n\nHis first gig on TV came as a co-presenter on the Newcastle-based TV music show 'The Tube', which he presented alongside Paula Yates.\n\nHowever, Jools was suspended from the show for six weeks after famously swearing in a live broadcast - so he returned back to the music industry.\n\nThis led to The Squeeze unexpectedly regrouping in 1985, with Jools slotting straight back in on the keyboard, where he remained with the band for the next five years.\n\nDuring that time, he formed the Jools Holland Big Band which also featured one of his former bandmates from The Squeeze. This slowly grew to become Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra, which had a total of 18 members.\n\nHis success in the music industry continued, and he went on to sign a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996, with his records now marketed through Rhino Records.\n\nJools, who was awarded an OBE in 2003, also made his return in front of the television cameras when he co-hosted and performed with David Sanborn on the music performance programme Sunday Night on NBC.\n\nHe can still be seen on the stage, especially at this time of year, when his annual New Year's Eve show is aired on BBC.\n\nJools Holland's Hootenanny has been pre-recorded for this year, but the show will feature a star-studded lineup as he's joined by his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra once again.\n\nJools is also Deputy Lieutenant of Kent, which surprised the musician when he was given the title in 2006.\n\nHe said: “When the Lieutenancy first approached me, I was unsure I had the ‘right profile’ compared to the type of person they normally have as a Lieutenant, but they wanted someone from the arts performing the role.\n\n“One of the important parts about the role is celebrating the identity of the great things about Kent and connecting it. Britain has this fantastic network of counties and they all bring their own identity: it is about celebrating the differences of those identities.\n\n“Kent is unique, almost like an island because it is surrounded by water on three sides. It boasts such diversity in the sense that Rochester is completely different to Tunbridge Wells and Romney Marsh is different to the Kent Downs; there are so many contrasts in one county.”"
