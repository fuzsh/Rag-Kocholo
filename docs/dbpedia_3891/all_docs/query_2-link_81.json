        "text": "Jools Holland And His Rhythm and Blues Orchestra featuring Gilson Lavis, Ruby Turner and Louise Marshall have confirmed concert dates at The Waterfront Belfast on Friday 16 June and Dublin’s 3Arena on Saturday 17 June 2023.\n\nTickets go on sale this Friday 12 August at 9.00am from Ticketmaster.ie\n\nJools Holland OBE DL was born Julian Miles Holland on 24th January 1958 in Blackheath, Southeast London. At the age of eight, he could play the piano fluently by ear, and by the time he reached his early teens he was proficient and confident enough to be appearing regularly in many of the pubs in South East London and the East End Docks.\n\nAt the age of 15, Jools was introduced to Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford; together they formed Squeeze, and shortly afterwards they were joined by Gilson Lavis (who had already played with, among others, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, and Max Wall) – who still drums with Jools.\n\nIn 1987, Jools formed The Jools Holland Big Band – comprising himself and Gilson Lavis. This has gradually metamorphosed into the current 19-piece Jools Holland and His Rhythm & Blues Orchestra, which consists of pianist, organist, drummer, three female vocals, guitar, bass guitar, two tenor saxophones, two alto saxophones, baritone saxophone, three trumpets, and three trombones.\n\nAs well as formidable live performances, Jools has maintained a prolific recording career since signing to Warner Music in 1996, which includes the multimillion selling Jools Holland and Friends series. Notable 'friends' have included Sting, Chrissie Hynde, George Harrison, Norah Jones, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, Bono, Joe Strummer, KT Tunstall, Robert Plant, Smokey Robinson, Kylie, Marc Almond, Ringo Starr, Peter Gabriel, Solomon Burke, and many more.\n\nJools' career as a television presenter has run parallel to his musical career. After presenting two series of Juke Box Jury in 1989 and then 26 shows of The Happening in 1990, Jools was asked in 1992 to host a new music programme for BBC2, which combined his talent and experience as a musician with his skills as a TV presenter. This was Later... with Jools Holland.\n\nJools' achievements were formally recognized in June 2003, when he was awarded the OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List.\n\nJools is about to embark on a short and intimate European club tour, which will be followed by Spring Summer dates with the Rhythm & Blues Orchestra and the 36 date Autumn tour of Ireland and the UK.
