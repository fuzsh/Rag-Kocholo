Finish time approx 10.30pm\n\nMore info:\n\nJools Holland & his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra\n\nfeaturing GILSON LAVIS\n\nwith special guest CHRIS DIFFORD\n\nand guest vocalists RUBY TURNER, LOUISE MARSHALL & BETH ROWLEY\n\nSupport Lewis and Leigh\n\nPianist, bandleader, singer, composer, television presenter and multiplatinum recording artist Jools Holland returns this year accompanied by special guest Chris Difford. He will be accompanied by the sound of Jools’ unforgettable Rhythm & Blues Orchestra.\n\nJools Holland with be performing tracks spanning his entire solo career as well as songs taken from his new duets album ‘Sirens Of Song’, released November 2014. With a catalogue that reaches through decades, a night with Jools Holland will bring you the greatest boogie-woogie party in town.\n\nAlso featuring the astounding vocal power of Ruby Turner, the soulful tones of Louise Marshall and the tireless drums of original Squeeze member Gilson Lavis, along with the inimitable musicianship of the Rhythm & Blues Orchestra, Jools’ boogie-woogie party is not to be missed!\n\nJools Holland OBE DL was born Julian Miles Holland on January 24, 1958 in Blackheath, South East London. At the age of 15 Jools was introduced to Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford; together they formed Squeeze, and shortly afterwards they were joined by Gilson Lavis (who had already played with, among others, B. B. King, Chuck Berry and Max Wall), who still drums with Jools. Up The Junction and Cool For Cats gave Squeeze meteoric success and their popularity rapidly extended to America, where their tour included performances at New York’s Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn 1987 Jools formed The Jools Holland Big Band, comprising himself and Gilson Lavis. This has gradually metamorphosed into the current 20-piece Jools Holland and His Rhythm & Blues Orchestra, which consists of pianist, organist, drummer, three female vocals, guitar, bass guitar, two tenor saxophones, two alto saxophones, baritone saxophone, three trumpets, and four trombones.\n\nJools’ career as a television presenter has run parallel to his musical career. He started in the early 1980s when he interviewed The Police for a documentary that was made while they were recording at George Martin’s Montserrat studio. Jools then auditioned to become co-presenter (with Paula Yates) of The Tube, which achieved almost immediate cult status and discovered a whole new generation of musicians and comedians between 1981 and 1986.\n\nAs always, Jools continues to dazzle audiences across the UK with his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra and their exuberant live performances. They have just come off an extensive UK tour and, for the 21st year in a row, celebrated the dawn of the new year with the whole nation on BBC2’s New Year’s Eve TV Show ‘Jools’ Annual Hootenanny’."
