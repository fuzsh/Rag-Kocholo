        "text": "English musician and television personality (born 1958)\n\nNot to be confused with Jools (band).\n\nJulian Miles Holland (born 24 January 1958) is an English pianist, bandleader, singer, composer and television presenter. He was an original member of the band Squeeze and has worked with many artists including Marc Almond, Joss Stone, Jayne County, Tom Jones, José Feliciano, Sting, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, George Harrison, David Gilmour, Ringo Starr, Bono, Rod Stewart and Ruby Turner.\n\nFrom 1982 until 1987, Holland co-presented the Channel 4 music programme The Tube. Since 1992, he has hosted Later... with Jools Holland, a music-based show aired on BBC2, on which his annual show Hootenanny is based.[2] Holland is a published author and appears on television shows besides his own. He regularly hosted the programme Jools Holland on BBC Radio 2. In 2004 he collaborated with Tom Jones on an album of traditional R&B music. He achieved his first UK number one album in 2024 with Swing Fever, a collaboration with Rod Stewart.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nHolland was born on 24 January 1958 in Blackheath, South East London. At the age of eight, he could play the piano fluently by ear. By his early teens he was appearing regularly in many of the pubs in South East London and the East End Docks.[3]\n\nHolland was educated at Shooters Hill Grammar School in southeast London, from which he was expelled for damaging a teacher's Triumph Herald.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHolland began his career as a session musician. His first studio session was with Wayne County & the Electric Chairs in 1976 on their track \"Fuck Off\".[5]\n\nHolland was a founding member of the British pop band Squeeze, formed in March 1974, in which he played keyboards until 1980, through its first three albums, the eponymous Squeeze, Cool for Cats and Argybargy, before pursuing his solo career.[citation needed]\n\nHolland began issuing solo records in 1978, his first EP being Boogie Woogie '78. He continued his solo career through the early 1980s, releasing an album and several singles between 1981 and 1984. He branched out into TV, co-presenting the Newcastle-based TV music show The Tube with Paula Yates. Holland used the phrase, \"be there, or be an ungroovy fucker\" in one early evening TV trailer for the show, live across two channels, causing him to be suspended from the show for six weeks.[6] He referred to this in his sitcom The Groovy Fellers with Rowland Rivron.[citation needed] Holland also appeared as a guest host on MTV.\n\nIn 1983, Holland played an extended piano solo on The The's re-recording of \"Uncertain Smile\" for the album Soul Mining. In 1985, Squeeze (which had continued in Holland's absence through to 1982) unexpectedly regrouped including Holland as their keyboard player. Holland remained in the band until 1990, at which point he again departed to resume his solo career as a musician and a TV host.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1987, Holland formed the Jools Holland Big Band, which consisted of himself and for the show Gilson Lavis from Squeeze, which gradually grew and was renamed as Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra.[7] In May 2022, it was a 17-piece orchestra and included singers Louise Marshall, Ruby Turner and Holland's daughter Mabel Ray, as well as his younger brother, singer-songwriter and keyboard player, Christopher Holland.[7]\n\nBetween 1988 and 1990 Holland performed and co-hosted along with David Sanborn during the two seasons of the music performance programme Sunday Night on NBC late-night television.[8] Since 1992, he has presented the music programme Later... with Jools Holland, plus an annual New Year's Eve Hootenanny.\n\nIn 1996, Holland signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records,[5] and his records are now marketed through Rhino Records.\n\nOn 29 November 2002, Holland was in the ensemble of musicians who performed at the Concert for George, which celebrated the music of George Harrison. In January 2005 Holland and his band performed with Eric Clapton as the headline act of the Tsunami Relief Cardiff.[citation needed]\n\nOn BBC Radio 2 Holland regularly hosted the programme Jools Holland, a mix of live and recorded music and general chat, featuring studio guests, along with members of his orchestra.[9]\n\nIn March 2023, Jimmy Barnes announced the formation of supergroup The Barnestormers, featuring Barnes, Chris Cheney, Slim Jim Phantom, Jools Holland and Kevin Shirley. A self-titled album was released on 26 May 2023.[10]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a teenager, Holland lived with his grandparents,[11] which he mentioned anecdotally in a 2020 episode of Rhod Gilbert's Growing Pains.\n\nHolland has a son, George, and daughter, Rose, with his former partner Mary Leahy.[12][13] On 30 August 2005, Holland married Christabel McEwen, his girlfriend of 15 years and daughter of artist Rory McEwen.[12][14] The couple have a daughter, Mabel, and McEwen has a son, Frederick Lambton, Viscount Lambton, by her former marriage to Ned Lambton, the 7th Earl of Durham.[13][15]\n\nHolland lives in Westcombe Park, south east London, where he had his studio, Helicon Mountain, built to his design and inspired by Portmeirion, the setting for the 1960s TV series The Prisoner.[16] He also owns a manor house near the medieval Cooling Castle in Kent.[17][18]\n\nHe appeared on the cover of Railway Modeller magazine in January 2019.[19] In the attic of his house, Holland has spent ten years building a 100-foot (30 m) model railway. It is full of miniature buildings and landscapes that stretch from Berlin to London. He started with photographs and paintings from early 1960s London. According to The Daily Telegraph, \"In the evenings, he builds some trains and buildings before switching on some music, pouring a glass of wine and switching on the trains to watch them move around the room.\"[20]\n\nHe received an OBE in 2003 in the Queen's Birthday Honours list, for services to the British music industry as a television presenter and musician.[21] In September 2006, Holland was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Kent.[22] Holland was appointed an honorary fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a ceremony held at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 2009.[23] On 1 February 2011 he was appointed honorary colonel of 101 (City of London) Engineer Regiment.[24] Holland has been the President of the British Watch & Clock Makers Guild since 2018,[25] and an honorary liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers since 2019.[26]\n\nIn June 2006, Holland performed in Southend for HIV/AIDS charity Mildmay,[27] and in early 2007 he performed at Wells and Rochester Cathedrals to raise money for maintaining cathedral buildings.[28] He is also patron of Drake Music.[29]\n\nA fan of the 1960s TV series The Prisoner,[16] in 1987 Holland demonstrated his love of the series and starred in a spoof documentary, The Laughing Prisoner, with Stephen Fry, Terence Alexander and Hugh Laurie.[16] Much of it was shot on location in Portmeirion, with archive footage of Patrick McGoohan. It featured musical selections by Siouxsie and the Banshees, Magnum and XTC. Holland performed a number towards the end of the programme.\n\nHolland was an interviewer for The Beatles Anthology TV project, and appeared in the 1997 film Spiceworld as a musical director.\n\nIn 2009, Holland commissioned TV series Bangla Bangers (Chop Shop) to create a replica of the Rover JET1 for personal use.\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nHis 2007 autobiography, Barefaced Lies and Boogie-Woogie Boasts, was BBC Radio 4 \"Book of the Week\" in the week beginning 8 October 2007 and was read by Holland.[30]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Squeeze and Squeeze discography\n\nCharting and certified albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Peak chart positions Certifications\n\n(sales thresholds)\n\n[31] UK\n\n[32] NZ\n\n[33]\n\n1996 Sex & Jazz & Rock & Roll 38 – 1998 The Best Of 90 –\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2000 Hop the Wag – –\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2001 Small World Big Band 8 23\n\nUK: 2× Platinum\n\n2002 SWBB Volume Two: More Friends 17 44\n\nUK: Platinum\n\n2003 Jack o the Green (SWBB Friends 3) 39 –\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2004 Tom Jones & Jools Holland 5 –\n\nUK: Gold\n\n2005 Swinging the Blues, Dancing the Ska 36 – 2007 Best of Friends 9 –\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2011 Finding the Keys – The Best Of 127[34] – 2012 The Golden Age of Song 11[35] –\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2015 Jools & Ruby 39[36] – 2017 As You See Me Now (with José Feliciano) 24 – 2018 A Lovely Life to Live (with Marc Almond) 61 – 2024 Swing Fever (with Rod Stewart) 1 –\n\nReleases\n\n[edit]\n\n1978 \"Boogie Woogie '78\" (EP)\n\n1981 Jools Holland and His Millionaires\n\n1984 Jools Holland Meets Rock 'A' Boogie Billy (US release only)\n\n1990 World of His Own\n\n1991 The Full Complement\n\n1992 \"Together Again\" (single with Sam Brown)\n\n1992 The A–Z Geographer's Guide to the Piano\n\n1994 Solo Piano\n\n1994 Live Performance\n\n1996 Sex & Jazz & Rock & Roll\n\n1997 Lift the Lid\n\n1998 Best Of\n\n1999 Sunset Over London\n\n2000 Hop the Wag\n\n2001 Small World Big Band\n\n2001 Jools Holland's Big Band Rhythm & Blues\n\n2002 SWBB Volume Two: More Friends\n\n2003 Jack O the Green (SWBB Friends 3)\n\n2004 Tom Jones & Jools Holland\n\n2005 Beatroute\n\n2005 Swinging the Blues, Dancing the Ska\n\n2006 Moving Out to the Country\n\n2007 Best of Friends\n\n2008 The Collection\n\n2008 The Informer (with Ruby Turner)\n\n2008 \"The Informer\" (single with Ruby Turner)\n\n2009 \"I Went By\" (single with Louise Marshall)\n\n2010 Rockinghorse\n\n2011 Finding the Keys: The Best of Jools Holland\n\n2012 The Golden Age of Song\n\n2014 Sirens of Song (UK No. 25)\n\n2015 Jools & Ruby (with Ruby Turner)\n\n2016 Piano\n\n2017 As You See Me Now (with José Feliciano)\n\n2018 A Lovely Life to Live (with Marc Almond)\n\n2021 Pianola.
