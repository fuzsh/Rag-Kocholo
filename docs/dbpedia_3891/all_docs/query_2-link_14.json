        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 1958, Jools Holland was born, making him 60 today. Holland is known as an original member of the British new wave band Squeeze, which was active in the late '70s through the '90s, and are known the U.S. for their singles \"Tempted\", \"Hourglass\" and \"853-5937\". He has collaborated with many artists including Sting, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, George Harrison, David Gilmour, Magazine and Bono, and hosted \"Later... with Jools Holland\", a music-based show on BBC2.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1958 - The Quarrymen performed at the Cavern Club in Liverpool (the band's only performance at the club). It was three years later when they appeared again at the Cavern but under their new name as The Beatles.\n\n1969 - The Doors appeared at Madison Square Garden, New York City. They were paid over $50,000 for the gig making them one of the highest paid acts that year.\n\n1976 - Bob Dylan started a five-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with his 17th studio album, Desire. The album features \"Hurricane\", which protests the conviction of former middleweight boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter for triple murder in 1966, arguing his innocence.\n\n1979 - The Clash released their first single in the U.S. with \"I Fought The Law\" (written by Sonny Curtis of Buddy Holly's Crickets, later popularized in a version by the Bobby Fuller Four). Joe Strummer and Mick Jones were inspired to learn the song after hearing the Bobby Fuller version on a jukebox owned by a San Francisco recording studio where they had been recording overdubs for their second album. This cover version helped gain the Clash their first taste of airplay in the States and is one of the best-known cover versions of the song.\n\n1998 - Oasis had a No. 1 hit single in Britain with \"All Around The World.\" At 9:38, the song enjoyed the distinction of having the longest running time ever for a No. 1 record.\n\n2008 - Amy Winehouse was admitted into rehab in a battle to kick her addiction to drugs.\n\n2016 - David Bowie was at No. 1 on both the U.K. and U.S. album charts with his twenty-fifth and final studio album Blackstar.\n\n2017 - Drummer Butch Trucks from The Allman Brothers Band died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at the age of 69.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nAaron Neville is 77.\n\nNeil Diamond is 77.\n\nWarren Zevon was born today in 1947.\n\nBlues Brother and all around funny guy John Belushi was born today in 1949.\n\nJools Holland of Squeeze is 60.\n\nHighlights for Today in Music History are gathered from This Day in Music, Paul Shaffer's Day in Rock, Song Facts and Wikipedia."
