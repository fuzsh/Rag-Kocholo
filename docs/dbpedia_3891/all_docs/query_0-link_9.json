        "text": "Julian Miles \"Jools\" Holland, OBE, DL (born 24 January 1958) is an English pianist, bandleader, singer, composer, and television presenter. He was a founder of the band Squeeze and his work has involved him with many artists including Sting, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, George Harrison, David Gilmour, Magazine and Bono.\n\nHolland is a published author and appears on television shows besides his own and contributes to radio shows. In 2004, he collaborated with Tom Jones on an album of traditional R&B music. He currently hosts Later... with Jools Holland, a music-based show aired on BBC2, on which his annual show Hootenanny is based.[1] He also regularly hosts the weekly program Jools Holland on BBC Radio 2, which is a mix of live and recorded music and general chat, and features studio guests, along with members of his Orchestra.\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\nHolland played as a session musician before finding fame, and his first studio session was with Wayne County & the Electric Chairs in 1976 on their track \"Fuck Off\".[2]\n\nHolland was a founding member of the British pop band Squeeze, formed in March 1974, in which he played keyboards until 1981 and helped the band to achieve millions of record sales, before pursuing his solo career.[2]\n\nHolland began issuing solo records in 1978, his first EP being Boogie Woogie '78. He continued his solo career through the early 1980s, releasing an album and several singles between 1981 and 1984. He branched out into TV, co-presenting the Newcastle-based TV music show The Tube with Paula Yates. Holland achieved notoriety by inadvertently using the phrase \"groovy fuckers\" in a live, early evening TV trailer for the show, causing him to be suspended from the show for six weeks.[3] He referred to this in his sitcom \"The Groovy Fellers\" with Rowland Rivron.\n\nIn 1983 Holland played an extended piano solo on The The's re-recording of \"Uncertain Smile\" for the album Soul Mining. In 1985, Squeeze (which had continued in Holland's absence through to 1982) unexpectedly regrouped including Jools Holland as their keyboard player. Holland remained in the band until 1990, at which point, he again departed Squeeze to resume his solo career as a musician and a TV host.\n\nIn 1987, Holland formed the Jools Holland Big Band, which consisted of himself and Gilson Lavis from Squeeze. This gradually became his 18-piece Rhythm & Blues Orchestra.[2]\n\nBetween 1988 and 1990 he performed and co-hosted along with David Sanborn during the two seasons of the music performance program Sunday Night on NBC late-night television.[4] Since 1992 he has presented the music program Later... with Jools Holland, plus an annual New Year's Eve Hootenanny.\n\nIn 1996, Holland signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records,[2] and his records are now marketed through Rhino Records.\n\nHolland has a touring band, the Rhythm And Blues Orchestra, which often includes singers Sam Brown and Ruby Turner and his younger brother, singer-songwriter and keyboard player, Christopher Holland. In January 2005 Holland and his band performed with Eric Clapton as the headline act of the Tsunami Relief Cardiff.\n\nOn 4 June 2012 Holland performed at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in London. Also in June 2012, he presented a programme about the popular songs of London on BBC Two, on June 9, 2012.\n\nJools presents a weekly programme on BBC Radio 2, combining guests and chat, with recorded and live music.\n\nPersonal[]\n\nHolland lives in the Westcombe Park area of Blackheath in South East London, where he had his studio, Helicon Mountain, built to his design, inspired by Portmeirion, the setting for the 1960s TV series The Prisoner.[5] Holland owns costumes and props from the series and occasionally appears wearing the trademark brown-with-white-pipe blazer featured in it. In 1987, Holland demonstrated his love of the series and starred in a spoof documentary, The Laughing Prisoner, with Stephen Fry, Terence Alexander and Hugh Laurie.[5] Much of it was shot on location in Portmeirion, with archive footage of Patrick McGoohan, and featuring musical numbers from Siouxsie and the Banshees, Magnum and XTC. Holland performed a number towards the end of the programme. Holland was an interviewer for The Beatles Anthology TV project, and appeared in the 1997 film Spiceworld as a musical director.\n\nHe received an OBE in 2003 in the Queen's Birthday Honours list, for services to the British music industry as a television presenter and musician. In September 2006 Holland was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Kent.[6] He is also known for his charity work: in June 2006 he performed in Southend for HIV/AIDS charity Mildmay,[7] and in early 2007 he performed at Wells and Rochester Cathedrals to raise money for maintaining cathedral buildings.[8] He is also patron of the Drake Music Project[9] and has raised many thousands of pounds for the charity.\n\nHolland was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a ceremony held at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 2009.[10]\n\nOn 29 August 2005, Holland married Christabel McEwen, his girlfriend of 15 years (between 1983 and 1995 she had been married to Edward Lambton, 7th Earl of Durham, before they divorced). The wedding, at St James's Church, Cooling, near Rochester, was attended by many celebrities, including Ringo Starr, Robbie Coltrane, Stephen Fry, Lenny Henry, Noel Gallagher, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.[11]\n\nHolland is also a patron for The Milton Rooms, an Arts centre in Malton, North Yorkshire, along with Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton and Kathy Burke.[12]\n\nIn 2008, Holland commissioned TV series Bangla Bangers (Chop Shop) to create a replica of the legendary Rover Jet 1 for personal use.\n\nIn August 2012, Holland was made Honorary Colonel of the Royal Engineers 101 (City of London Engineer Regiment), currently in the Bomb Disposal role.\n\nHolland is a keen greyhound racing supporter and has previously owned dogs.[13]\n\nWriting[]\n\nHis 2007 biography, Barefaced Lies and Boogie Woogie Boasts, was BBC Radio 4 \"Book of the Week\" in the week beginning 8 October 2007 and was read by Holland. He is the author or joint author of four other books.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSee also: Squeeze and Squeeze discography\n\nAlbums which charted and received certifications[]\n\nYear Album Peak chart positions Certifications\n\n(sales thresholds)\n\n[14]\n\nUK\n\n[15]\n\nNZ\n\n[16]\n\n1996 Sex & Jazz & Rock & Roll 38 - 1998 Best Of - -\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2000 Hop The Wag - -\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2001 Small World Big Band 8 23\n\nUK: 2× Platinum\n\n2002 SWBB Volume Two: More Friends 17 44\n\nUK: Platinum\n\n2003 Jack O The Green (SWBB Friends 3) 39 -\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2004 Tom Jones & Jools Holland 5 -\n\nUK: Gold\n\n2005 Swinging the Blues, Dancing the Ska 36 - 2007 Best of Friends 9 -\n\nUK: Silver\n\n2011 Finding The Keys - The Best of 127[17] - 2012 The Golden Age of Song 11[18] -\n\nUK: Silver\n\nReleases[]\n\n1978 \"Boogie Woogie '78\" (EP)\n\n1981 Jools Holland and His Millionaires\n\n1984 Jools Holland Meets Rock 'A' Boogie Billy (U.S. release only)\n\n1990 World Of His Own\n\n1991 The Full Complement\n\n1992 Together Again (single with Sam Brown)\n\n1992 The A-Z Geographer's Guide To The Piano\n\n1994 Solo Piano\n\n1994 Live Performance\n\n1996 Sex & Jazz & Rock & Roll\n\n1997 Lift The Lid\n\n1998 Best Of\n\n1999 Sunset Over London\n\n2000 Hop the Wag\n\n2001 Small World Big Band\n\n2002 SWBB Volume Two: More Friends\n\n2003 Jack O the Green (SWBB Friends 3)\n\n2004 Tom Jones & Jools Holland\n\n2005 Beatroute\n\n2005 Swinging the Blues, Dancing the Ska\n\n2006 Moving Out to the Country\n\n2007 Best of Friends\n\n2008 The Collection\n\n2008 The Informer (with Ruby Turner)\n\n2008 \"The Informer\" (single with Ruby Turner)\n\n2009 \"I Went By\" (single with Louise Marshall)\n\n2010 Rockinghorse\n\n2011 Finding the Keys: The Best of Jools Holland\n\n2012 The Golden Age of Song\n\nFilm and television[]\n\n1981 Otway & Barrett Live\n\n1981 Urgh!
