        "text": "Jools Holland is bringing his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra back to Lincoln Castle in July and some very special guests will bring three original Squeeze band members together again.\n\nThe concert will be held on July 7, and fans of Jools Holland will be able to enjoy a performance of music from a vast repertoire spanning decades of collaborations and original material.\n\nLondon-born Jools could play the piano fluently by ear by the age of 8, and was already gigging around London by his early teens.\n\nAt 15 he was introduced to Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford and together they formed famous pop group Squeeze.\n\nIn fact, the special guest on the night will be Chris Difford; this will mean three original Squeeze band members – Jools Holland, Chris Difford and Gilson Lavis (drummer with Jools Holland’s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra) – will be reunited on stage.\n\nWith his Squeeze co-founder Glenn Tilbrook, double Ivor Novello award winning lyricist Chris Difford has written some of the most enduring songs of our time such as Up The Junction, Cool For Cats and Labelled With Love.\n\nFurther support will come from London-based singer/songwriter Ella Janes, a rising star in folk music circles.\n\nChasing your dreams\n\nElla's first major success came in 2014, when she was asked to open for Simple Minds and Toploader at Alnwick Castle.\n\n\"I took it as a joke, to be honest! With about three days’ notice I told them I would do it.\"\n\nThe sound engineer at the concert then recommended her for Jools’ tours and, after four years she finally attained an invitation to do so.\n\nIn the meantime, in 2017, she quit her job in a music agency to perform as a busker.\n\n\"I started in the cold November and December weather, but when I felt cold I would ask myself whether I wanted to be busking or back in that office. It was always busking.\"\n\nWhen asked whether she ever regretted the decision to abandon the working world for her dream, Ella replied with an emphatic \"never\".\n\n\"Chasing your dreams depends on how much you want it. Like other artists, I was often riddled by self-doubt, but if you really want something persistence is the only option. You don’t really have the choice.\"\n\nHer first concert with Jools was at Tunbridge Wells Assembly Hall, a venue which sold out.\n\n\"It was an honour, and a fabulous opportunity. I’ve now performed twice with Jools, and each time has been absolutely fantastic – but they’ve been in music hall type venues, so I’m excited to play in a different arena.\"\n\nElla says she is never anxious about her performances with the major talent.\n\n\"I’ve been performing since 13, and in musicals as a child. I took a French degree and lived in France for a while, then entered the working world. I took up jobs in administration, so I could back out if needed for the music.\"\n\nShe is also excited about the ‘lovely backdrop’ Lincoln has to offer.\n\n\"I’m going to make a whole weekend of it and explore the city, just see where things take me!\n\n\"I’m hoping people will bring picnics [to Lincoln Castle] and watch the sun set – I think it will be like the concert at Alnwick Castle. There’s a different vibe when it’s an outdoor event.\"\n\nAs to whether audiences will see Chris Difford, Jools Holland and Gilson Lavis turning back the clock together on stage Ella added: \"I'd imagine so, but guess we will have to wait and see!\"\n\nMetamorphosis\n\nThe Jools Holland Big Band was formed in 1987, but this gradually metamorphosed into the current 20-piece Jools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra – now consisting of pianist, organist, drummer, three female vocals, guitar, bass guitar, two tenor saxophones, two alto saxophones, baritone saxophone, three trumpets and four trombones.\n\nJools has also maintained a prolific recording career since signing to Warner Music in 1996, which includes the multi-million selling Jools Holland and Friends series.\n\nHe’s also very well-known for his television work, notably becoming co-presenter of The Tube with Paula Yates, which achieved almost immediate cult status in the 80s. Also, BBC 2 television show Later...with Jools Holland. Hootenanny is an annual show presented by Jools and broadcast on New Year’s Eve as an end of year special for Later... with Jools Holland.\n\nThe open air concert at Lincoln Castle is not a seated event. Golden circle tickets allow access closer to the stage than a General Admission.\n\nEvent time: 5.30pm-11pm. General admission £35.95 plus £2.60 free, Golden circle ticket £54.95 plus £3.57 fee. Buy tickets online at HERE.\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest entertainment news here."
