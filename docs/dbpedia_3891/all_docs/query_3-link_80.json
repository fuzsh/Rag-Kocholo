        "text": "‘The prospect of bringing back to life a theatre in South London, with a stage the equivalent size of the Palladium, is very exciting. My friend the late Chris Barber and his jazz band played there in the fifties, and it would be so wonderful to see the Streatham Hill Theatre filled with all kinds of music once again. I’m delighted to add my support to this important campaign to save it.‘\n\nJools Holland was born in Blackheath, South London, and this is where Helicon Mountain, the Portmeirion inspired studio complex he designed and built, is based.\n\nFrom playing pubs in the East End docks as a teenage greaser, to leading his rhythm and blues orchestra and selling millions of records this century, it is his passion for music that has made Jools Holland into a doyen of the music scene.\n\nHe holds the unique status of performing with numerous renowned singers and musicians who have achieved success in every decade of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nJools must hold the record for making more music programmes for TV than any other host: The Tube, made in Newcastle; four series of Night Music, made in New York; three series of The Happening, filmed at London’s Astoria Theatre; two series of Name That Tune, filmed in Leeds; sixty-four series of Later…; twenty-nine Hootenanny shows; and one series of Beat Route, filmed all over the world.\n\nPost pandemic, Jools, his orchestra and the crew are enjoying working on live shows back on the boogie woogie stage.\n\nJools was awarded an OBE in 2003 for his services to the British music industry. He is married with four children and lives in a world of his own."
