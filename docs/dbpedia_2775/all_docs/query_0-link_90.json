        "text": "Liam is a news writer and reviewer for Nintendo Life and Pure Xbox. He's been writing about games for more than 15 years and is a lifelong fan of Mario and Master Chief. He's also got a soft spot for Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nAuthor Profile\n\nTwitter/X\n\nReply\n\n1\n\nSlain\n\nThey could have easily put all the games from both collections into one.\n\nI'd personally be more interested in a new game in the series.\n\n2\n\nMach_Rider\n\nIt's a darn shame they didn't put them on the first collection, as they could've easily done so. Hopefully, the LR edition will arrive before this releases, so I can decide whether I want to invest in a second collection as well...\n\n3\n\nSerpenterror\n\nTwo collections and they still missing one game, that's lame and not worth the price. Konami was able to give us 13 games dammit, when you're worst than Konami then there's definitely something wrong with your company.\n\n4\n\nSillyG\n\nThis series is far too niche for them to be so contemptibly stingy. It should have all been on a single cart.\n\n5\n\nFunneefox\n\nOnce again, Emulation is always the morally superior option.\n\n6\n\nprogx\n\n@Funneefox I’d say, consumer friendly since you are allowed to have a digital backup of a game you own. Morally… video games aren’t really a right.\n\n7\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nCool, I will try super valis IV in the meantime.\n\n8\n\nChakraStomps\n\n@Funneefox Thieving? How about making your own game if you are really morally anything?\n\n9\n\nFunneefox\n\noooohhhhhh I’m gonna steal AAALLL the video games in the world MWUAHAHAHAHHAHAAAA\n\n10\n\ntwztid13\n\nThese games look so bad to me. Oh well, hopefully someone will enjoy them.\n\n11\n\nNotArmani\n\n@Funneefox Sounds like a plan >\n\n12\n\nNotArmani\n\nThis (and the other collection) both look pretty bare-bones at best unless you wanna argue that they are \"translated\".\n\n13\n\nEVIL-C\n\nLimited run and their corruption ruins yet another western release."
