        "text": "Valis SD complete box art scan\n\nDeveloper(s):\n\nI.S.C.\n\nPublisher(s):\n\nTelenet Japan (Japan)\n\nRenovation Products (US)\n\nPlatform(s)-Release date(s):\n\nSega Mega Drive/ Genesis - 1992\n\nPC (Valis Complete Plus)- 2011\n\nGenre(s):\n\nAction/ Platform\n\nValis SD (ヴァリス SD, Varisu Esu Di), known in America as Syd of Valis (literally, Super Yuuko Deformed of Valis) is the first spin-off game of the Valis series. The game's plot is mostly built upon the events of Valis II, parodying them with an SD (Super Deformed) style in the characters' designs, making them look funnier and greatly exaggerating their attitudes.\n\nStory[]\n\nYuko goes for an ice cream as on any normal day, but then the city is covered by darkness as a new villain presents himself to her. Yuko's ingenuity makes her ask the villain if he is Rogles from the first game, but the villain reveals his name as Megas. He tells Yuko his intentions of dominating the human world, the spirit world and the dream world (Vecanti). Seeing this, Yuko transforms her ice cream into the Valis sword and decides to go after Megas.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nThis game has basically the same gameplay as any other Valis game, but there are many differences. To start, Yuko is slightly faster here than in the other games. She has the same power-up attack items from Valis II available to her, as well as the multiple suits that she has in the MSX and PC88/98 versions of that game. She wins them by beating mini-bosses and/or bosses. Depending on the suit, her attack, defense and speed stats will change. Finally, there is a scoring system that, as in Valis II, will give the player an extra life for each 10000 points earned.\n\nYuko also has some new abilities that are exclusive to the game. These abilities include double jumping and shooting upwards. She also recovers her HP bar by beating bosses and sub-bosses. She can't die automatically by falling into holes, but simply loses HP, making the game easier.\n\nIn comparison to Valis II, the game has different music and level structures, though the level backgrounds are identical.\n\nWeapon list:[]\n\nNormal shot: the standard default Valis shot.\n\nWide shot: a wider shot with more attack range.\n\nHoming shot: a shot that homes in on the nearest enemy.\n\nTriple shot: fires 3 shots forward at the same time, one going straight, another upwards at an angle and the other downwards at an angle.\n\nSuit list:[]\n\nSchool uniform: the default suit. 10 A-Power, 10 D-Power, 10 Speed.\n\nChinese dress: 08 A-Power, 15 D-Power, 10 Speed.\n\nValis normal armor: 10 A-Power, 20 D-Power,15 Speed.\n\nValis guard armor: 20 A-Power, 10 D-Power, 10 Speed.\n\nValis light armor: 10 A-Power, 20 D-Power, 20 Speed.\n\nValis ultimate armor: 20 A-Power, 25 D-Power, 15 Speed.\n\nItems:[]\n\nSmall heart: recovers 1/4 of Yuko's HP bar.\n\nBig heart: recovers 1/2 of Yuko's HP bar.\n\nBomb: by pressing the C button, the player can use one of them to make a big flash explosion destroying any enemies on screen.\n\nYuuko's doll: gives the player an extra life.\n\nComparison with Valis II[]\n\nBeing a parody of the Valis II game, it has many things in common and several differences:\n\nSimilarities:[]\n\nThe levels are almost the same in environment.\n\nMany of the enemies and characters from the original game appear.\n\nThe suits and weapons from the original version are also present.\n\nDifferences:[]\n\nSome cutscenes are changed.\n\nThe structure and music from the levels are changed.\n\nSome characters changed their attitude, mostly Yuko who normally forgets about Megas.\n\nSome enemies and sub-bosses are different.\n\nReception[]\n\nThe game received generally negative reviews.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis is the first spin-off game of the series.\n\nYuko is called Syd in the Western version of the game: Syd of Valis.\n\nThe Western version of the box's cover is actually the cover from another game called Naritore the Sugoroku '92 that was released only in Japan for the PC-Engine by Telenet. It has many characters from various Telenet series with Yuko included among them.\n\nIn the Western box art, Yuko / Syd also appears dressed as a secretary, a suit that does not appear in the game but does so in Naritore.\n\nIn this game, Megas has his monocle on his left eye instead of the right one as he does in the main series games.\n\nThe only Valis II boss that is not present in this parody is Scarlet Fire Toe.\n\nThis is the shortest game of the entire series, having only five levels.\n\nSince Valis SD, it has been a running gag to include artwork and/or extras in super deformed style on every Valis game, even in the manga.\n\n[]"
