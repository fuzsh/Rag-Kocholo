        "text": "Abstract\n\nSpatial analyses can reveal important interactions between and among cells and their microenvironment. However, most existing staining methods are limited to a handful of markers per slice, thereby limiting the number of interactions that can be studied. This limitation is frequently overcome by registering multiple images to create a single composite image containing many markers. While there are several existing image registration methods for whole slide images (WSI), most have specific use cases. Here, we present the Virtual Alignment of pathoLogy Image Series (VALIS), a fully automated pipeline that opens, registers (rigid and/or non-rigid), and saves aligned slides in the ome.tiff format. VALIS has been tested with 273 immunohistochemistry (IHC) samples and 340 immunofluorescence (IF) samples, each of which contained between 2-69 images per sample. The registered WSI tend to have low error and are completed within a matter of minutes. In addition to registering slides, VALIS can also using the registration parameters to warp point data, such as cell centroids previously determined via cell segmentation and phenotyping. VALIS is written in Python and requires only few lines of code for execution. VALIS therefore provides a free, opensource, flexible, and simple pipeline for rigid and non-rigid registration of IF and/or IHC that can facilitate spatial analyses of WSI from novel and existing datasets."
