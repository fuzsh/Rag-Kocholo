        "text": "Judging by the trailer, it's a very cheap collection with no extras and no graphic options. Hope I'm wrong and they announce it later, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nIt's disappointing, sure, but would it really be a Valis ANYTHING if it wasn't half-assed? I love the Valis series, but it was never great. But yeah, I'll totally buy this, anyway. I hope it comes stateside.\n\nIsn't that the one on NSO?\n\nThat's the SNES version. That's like calling Castlevania: Dracula X for SNES the same as Castlevania: Rondo of Blood for PC Engine, even if the differences aren't quite as drastic in the case of Valis IV.\n\nIt's disappointing, sure, but would it really be a Valis ANYTHING if it wasn't half-assed?

That's like calling Castlevania: Dracula X for SNES the same as Castlevania: Rondo of Blood for PC Engine, even if the differences aren't quite as drastic in the case of Valis IV.\n\nI dunno, the differences are almost exactly the same going from Valis IV to Super Valis (IV). You lose character choices, a lot of stages, some graphics detail, etc. I enjoy the hell out of both versions of each game, but Super Valis is rather cut down, by comparison. Going Rondo to XX simplified it to being just like an older classicvania, going Valis IV to Super is almost exactly the same thing by making it a standard action platformer.\n\nWhy make a new collection when they could've just rereleased Valis X?\n\nJokes aside, I played the first one, and it was alright. Sort of curious about the others, but not 40-ish euros type of curious.\n\nToo soon regarding the Valis X joke. XD\n\nAnd yeah, I probably wouldn't feel right paying $30, and I know the games aren't that great.\n\nHonestly, if any series was deserving of and ripe for a remake, then it's probably Valis.\n\nI dunno, the differences are almost exactly the same going from Valis IV to Super Valis (IV).

Going Rondo to XX simplified it to being just like an older classicvania, going Valis IV to Super is almost exactly the same thing by making it a standard action platformer.\n\nI agree that the lack of the other characters is pretty disappointing, but I don't think the degree to which the stages were removed or cut back for Super Valis IV was nearly as drastic as the cutbacks made for Castlevania: Dracula X. And I say that as someone who prefers Castlevania: Dracula X, though that's more so because Richter's movement just feels more \"correct\" to me.\n\nToo soon regarding the Valis X joke.

And I say that as someone who prefers Castlevania: Dracula X, though that's more so because Richter's movement just feels more \"correct\" to me.\n\nThere's also the complete removal of cutscenes! D: Super Valis may as well not have a story.\n\nI'm not disagreeing that Rondo was more cut back, by any means, but I'd say they were comparable in scope, at least. Super Valis is sooooo short compared to the PCE version.\n\nI'm also with you on actually preferring XX just because... it feels like a more \"proper\" Castlevania, to me? I'm also a crazy person who likes some of the music more. That and the challenge, but that's a totally different thing.\n\nOnly partially joking here but maybe this will open the doors for other lower quality series revivals.\n\nThe world needs more exposure to the C-tier also-ran sidescrollers of the early '90s.\n\nHonestly, just a day or two ago, I was contemplating whether you could make certain older games \"worth playing\" by simply making minor tweaks to them. I was actually thinking of JRPGs with early-game balance issues, but I honestly do wish studios would acquire the rights for and approach some older series and do some \"turd-polishing\" to not only bring them back for existing fans but also to see if maybe they'd appeal to more people with their fixes.\n\nI also love the anime stylings of that era (which are so cool to see in these games' intros/etc.), with so many being influenced in one way or another by folks like Mikimoto, Shirow, Takahashi, etc.\n\nWhat's in the games is decent in that regard with some of the cutscenes, but seeing the commercial for the Valis game on Famicom really makes me realize the potential for the series versus the execution up until this point. I mean, try going from watching something like this...\n\n...to watching, oh, these scenes from Valis II:\n\nValis could be AMAZING with a better budget and some care. I'd love to see a Valis game along the lines of Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth.\n\nI'm not sure many people on Era know of Shubibinman outside of maybe andymcc\n\nI'm a fan of the series, especially the third game.\n\nI'm down for a Valis collection even though it's missing IV. III and IV are much better games than they get credit for.\n\nand i love the pc-engine valis games? weird to see people clamoring for the other ports because, in my memory, they're much worse?\n\nFor the most part I agree but Genesis Valis III isn't that far behind the TGCD one for me. Some parts of the cutscenes even look a bit better on Genesis.\n\nI'm a fan of the series, especially the third game.\n\nI'm down for a Valis collection even though it's missing IV.

Some parts of the cutscenes even look a bit better on Genesis.\n\nEh it'S a wash between MD Valis 2/3 and PCE CD Valis 2/3, they're regular CDrom2 games unlike the remake of 1 which is a Super CD game.\n\nIkr. I have a ridiculously strong sentimental attachment to the Genesis port of Valis 3. Absolute staple of the Telenet/Renovation family.\n\nI blame the many successive Blockbuster rentals I put it through back in the day. My og 1-2 combo for Genesis rentals was Valis 3 and Air Buster\n\nCham has been my Twitter avatar for as long as I've been on the platform...\n\nPretty much. There's a lot about Valis III that feels and sometimes looks better on the MD/Genesis version.\n\nI think one of the aspects of the remake of 1 I never cared for was how slow it felt. Everything about it is fantastic from the spritework to the music to the controls to it being more of just a straightforward platformer, but the movement speed was just soooo slooooow. I think Super Valis actually spoiled me because the default movement speed is good and you can friggin' run by double tapping.\n\nOddly, I always felt like a remake of the games by WayForward would have been pretty much perfect and even appropriate. IntiCreates could do it, too and I know I'd love to see KOU do some artwork for the series, but I'm not sure where in the cards that is. I want to see what the reason for IV being absent is and as much as SD Valis is kind of blah, there was an interesting idea with the outfits in there, if only the game didn't have decently floaty controls with gigantic yet horrible collision boxes. The less said about that awful eroge series, the better, though.\n\nHow come I only found out about this today? I'm a big fan of the series and I've been hoping for some any news regarding Valis for quite some time. The last time I heard about it was when Sunsoft acquired Renovation's catalogue.\n\nWho are these Edia people? I don't think I've heard about them before, but I hope things go well for them so they can eventually release some sort of Valis Complete Collection. It really doesn't matter if it doesn't have Valis X as long as it has all Valis games released for the PCE/TG-16, MD/Genesis and SF/SNES.\n\nI have a morbid curiosity about the PC-88/98, MSX and X68k releases and I'm sure Laevateinn would agree with me on those :p They are, after all, the original releases"
