        "text": "Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\n\nWhat would you think if your best friend went on a date with the King of the Dark World – because she thought he was cute?! You’d think she’d been duped – and you’d be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one – and you will control her.\n\nValis II\n\nFrom the ashes of your ravaged homeland, the legendary sword Valis calls out to you. Its power transforms you into a ferocious warrior against the evil forces of King Magus. Crush Zarooga, the fearsome red dragon! Battle the unspeakable Death Pod! But beware! Magus has sworn a blood oath to destroy you and capture Valis, to possess its power forevermore. Summon all your fury to face Magus in an epic struggle over the fate of your countrymen.\n\nValis III\n\nYou are Yuko Ahso, a student in the Human World, called to fulfill your destiny in the Dreamland. Your mission is to wield the Sword of Valis to defend Dreamland against attack from the Dark King Glames. Glames seeks more territory to replace his disappearing Dark Kingdom. His powerful Sword of Lethus is the magical counterpart to Yuko’s Sword of Valis. Whoever has the pair controls enormous destructive power. Yuko’s twin sister, Valna, is the new Queen of Dreamland. Yuko needs Valna and her powerful magic in the battle against Glames, but Valna is trapped in a crystal block. Only with the help of Cham and her fighting spirit can Yuko free her sister. Can Yuko depend on Cham who was born of the Dark Kingdom?"
