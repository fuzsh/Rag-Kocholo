        "text": "Japanese company Edia revealed plans to bring the first three titles in the Valis: The Fantasm Soldier series to Nintendo Switch. It will hold a crowdfunding session to support development of the ports on the Japanese crowdfunding site Makuake. [Thanks, DenFamiNico Gamer!]\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThis announcement is a follow-up to Edia’s initial reveal of the Valis 35th anniversary project made in December 2020. The series’ anniversary will occur in December 2021, 35 years after the inaugural title came out on PC-8801, MSX, and X1 in December 1986.\n\nEdia will use earnings from the crowdfunding project to bring the PC Engine versions of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier, Valis II, and Valis III to the Switch. The PC Engine releases were received the most positively by critics of the time. Although all three games were also available in North America on Sega Genesis, only the PC Engine versions of Valis II and III received English localization.\n\nThe last mainline title in the series to date, Super Valis IV, was released on the Super NES. It is already available on the Switch through the December 2020 Nintendo Switch Online collection in the West.\n\nWith this announcement, the Nintendo Switch will eventually contain all four Valis titles. However, Edia has yet to confirm whether it will also bring the Super Valis IV port to Japan and the upcoming ports of the first three Valis titles to the West."
