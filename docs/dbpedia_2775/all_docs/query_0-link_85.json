        "text": "Dear Community\n\nI discovered and read the paper on VALIS Virtual alignment of pathology image series for multi-gigapixel whole slide images | Nature Communications\n\nI am trying to register IHC images, but they are RGB and VALIS doenst allow to convert them in multichannel IF images. I tried deconvolution and then merging of the hematoxylin and DAB but Valis doenst register them. The deconvolution was performed with ImageJ/Fiji. And the channels are 8bit images.\n\n@Jimmie @cdgatenbee\n\nI tagged you guys because you had some previous posts on valis. I also ran the snipet from the example with the merging. My problem is that the run is just killed before finishing even the rigid registration.\n\nCould someone help me run it somehow or has any ideas?\n\nBest wishes!\n\nHi @andreevg04,\n\nSorry you’re running into this issue. It sounds like there is some sort of error either with reading the images, or trying to process them. Could you share the error message so I can narrow it down? Also, am I correct in understanding that you’d like to create a multichannel image by merging the deconvolved channels derived by performing stain deconvolution on brightfield IHC images? If so, an alternative approach could be to use valis to align the IHC images, then deconvolve and merge the stain channels using those aligned images (this is the same approach we used to create the 18plex image in Supplemental Figure 4d). If that sounds like it might work, could you test if you are able to align the original TMA cores (i.e. prior to stain deconvolution)? If this isn’t quite right, could you maybe describe in a bit more detail what you would like to do, and, if possible, share some images?\n\nBest,\n\n-Chandler\n\nP.S. cross posting from the GitHub issue 83. I’ll probably focus the rest of the discussion on GitHub so as to track the issue, but I’ll share the solution here too once the issue is resolved."
