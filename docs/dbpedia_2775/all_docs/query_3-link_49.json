Don’t forget to enter the Rafflecopter giveaway.\n\n****\n\nAdventure awaits in The God Jars Saga!\n\nNo amount of hard work and dedication could ever prepare Valis for becoming the world’s only hope of survival, but after finding love and true family he’s determined to give that destiny his all.\n\nThe God Jars Saga by Devon Vesper is a raw, epic tale of strength and love in the face of adversity. If you’re looking for sword & sorcery fantasy with rich character development, intensity, uniqueness, and an unforgettable love story, look no further!\n\nEach of the first eight books ends in a cliffhanger with book nine ending in a guaranteed Happily Ever After.\n\n****\n\nThis M/M Epic Fantasy Romance series contains 9 books plus two novellas. Magic, love, and war await!\n\nRaised by an abusive father, Valis had only one friend in his life. Only when he is rescued does he discover that his childhood friend, a man who only came to his in his dreams, is the god he is to serve. But serving him means joining an order of warrior priests, and finding the missing God Jar before the evil god can destroy all Valis holds dear.\n\nTo join the Order, a man or woman must form a homosexual bond and marry their partner, but Tavros—the only man who has captured Valis’ interest—hates and fears him because not only does Valis wield holy gold magic, but also the magic of the evil god whose jar Valis must recover. To advance, and to have any hope of saving his childhood friend, Valis must somehow convince his prospective lover that he isn’t the monster Tavros fears.\n\nFollow Valis and his friends as they learn to overcome their fears, find their forever love, and try to bring an end to the age of evil. Can they find the missing God Jar before the world descends into darkness?\n\nCHECK OUT EACH BOOK ON GOODREADS\n\nBuy Links – Available on Kindle Unlimited\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK\n\n****\n\n****\n\nEnter the Rafflecopter giveaway for a chance to win ebook copies of Books 1-3\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\nHosted by Gay Book Promotions"
