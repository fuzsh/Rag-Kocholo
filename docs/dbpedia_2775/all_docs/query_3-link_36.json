Proxy\n8. States Of Decay\n9. Infinite World\n10. Elevation (feat. White Dove)\n\nValis Ablaze set out to provide an intriguing alternative to the progressive metal norm; prominent swells of creative ingenuity, as well as thought out details and subtle complexities that will keep the listener returning again and again.\r\n\r\nAfter the success of the 2017 Insularity EP produced by Drewsif Stalin, Valis Ablaze presented an even more refined sound with their debut album Boundless, produced by Justin Hill (Sikth, Heart of a Coward, Bury Tomorrow): low end grooves juxtaposed with soaring vocal lines, crisp milton-cleans and atmospheric synths, all driven by intricate rhythm work and growling bass - a huge spectrum of energy, emotion, power and beauty.\r\n\r\nTwo years of playing the EP and the album on the road around Europe with bands such as Monuments, The Contortionist, Dead Letter Circus and Vola has only further inspired the band. They have since worked hard on their follow up to Spring 2018’s Boundless, with their Sophomore album, Render, set for a July 2019 release.\r\n\r\nRender, mixed and mastered by James Wisner (Paramore, Underoath, Hands Like Houses), seeks to push past the obstacles that listeners may find with a concept album and aims to find a favourite song for everyone.",

        "text": "1.\n\nNeon Dreaming 05:26\n\nThis is never going to stop Until everything is camouflaged I look up, see luminosity As lights begin to flood into our already-burning eyes What is this? These colours fill my vision Saturating memories of false precision To find a way we'll take this and abide We break away to reach the other side And we can't resist an urge to exist in disguise Show me what it's like to dream neon light We live inside a machine A slow dependency creeping in And I am now aware Just close your eyes And you will see what was always there Seeing another world Just let yourself be true Don't speak out another word With neon all around There's nothing else in view We're scared of something Subdued and crushing Perfection was always so misunderstood to me And now the prey is hunted Afraid of nothing Seeing through the grey Fluorescence pulls you free We fall into another wasted design But it's all we know and are Self-preservation was the final desire Now its final like the stars To find a way we'll take this and abide We break away to reach the other side We can't resist an urge to exist in disguise Show me what it's like To find a way we'll take this and abide We break away to reach the other side And we can't resist an urge to exist in disguise Show me what it's like to read the signs It's all for you We fall into another wasted design But it's all we are Self-preservation was always something you said would get easier\n\n2.\n\nHollow Heart 04:03\n\nAllured by distant memory I walk beyond the sky and mountains It ceases to exist in me But I won't let it show With this hollow heart But we'll keep on fighting to the end Our truth is known Can't you see it's human grown? This comfort forms a wave that pulls me down As the king waits for the crown With this hollow heart Dissolving in reality It's dark pool overflows Keep the inner feelings down But I won't let it show With this hollow heart We're nothing but fragments And we'll keep on fighting to the end Our truth is known Can't you see it's human grown? This comfort forms a wave that pulls me down As the king waits for the crown I've been waiting just to feel the burst again A feeling to contain In this hollow heart\n\n3.\n\nThe Convincer 05:45\n\nThey watched you from afar But close enough to taste They saw everything that you did That put you in this place This hollow sun has set Beneath a falling star I wonder what you are They tried to let you go Afraid to leave the world below Just show me who you are Survive a sense of pride Whether it's laugh or cry It's showing what you are Stage, rate, validate Those wires should carry you But they brought you to your knees This fear is something new to you A paradigm diseased But could this be the new distraction? To follow and obey Endless we see that fear in your eyes That there is no sweeter prize One chance, one life A helpless cry For change, remove The myth, the lie You search, you seek But cannot find The buzz, the bite It won't be kind What glitters doesn't always shine That little part of you is mine And here tonight No need to hide Whether it's laugh or cry Just show me who you are They tried to let you go Afraid to leave the world below Just show me who you are Survive a sense of pride Whether it's laugh or cry It's showing what you are Stage, rate, validate\n\n4.\n\nKeyframes 04:41\n\nWhen it all begins to fall Learn to cut the safety cord When all that you desire Is to live within a timeless void Where are you? When you've lost the grip you'll fall But its a seventh sense When you find the strength to go on A moment to hide When the fingers click I pause a lifetime Let everything stop Now you understand We can disappear in time And would you? But where would you return? It's like a second chance But one sacrifice Time stops while you move on Fragments of time How it flows like sand Through broken hands Forward! I've stopped the time And longed for this escape Frozen inside But here I still aspirate No consequence, no pretence Language has no use There's nothing left to say I slip away And could you ever tell that I was even gone? For now I walk Forward alone Learn to cut the safety cord\n\n5.\n\nAscent (feat. Sam Bell) 04:31\n\nStaring at the sun It's burning everyone A mystery unmasking me A flow of dramamine Echoes the heart machine Just close your eyes Reach further heights And ascend Know this is not the end Just taken to sky Under watchful eye No laws to abide this time Visions that I could be the one to elevate To fly away And I'm hoping that I soar Into the seven skies up above And let go of the earth No matter how close to stars I get I'm still reaching out Know this is not the end Just taken to sky Under watchful eye No laws to abide this time Wrapped in total solitude Hoping that we all fall away Visions that I could be the one to elevate To fly away I am hoping that I soar Into the seven skies up above You let go of the earth Though we are miles above Still trying to reach the sun We cohere Staring at the sun It's burning everyone A mystery unmasking me I ascend\n\n6.\n\nSaturation 03:19\n\nWe've been blind so long These colours just seem so wrong And how can we believe that we belong? Do we belong? Do we belong? I will run away To isolate Slipping in and out of colour We dissipate In complicated worlds of distraction Far away, we're sovereign Here, we're forgotten But I don't believe that anymore These shades were there before It hypnotised You were the opening of my eyes And I realise how the story goes I saturate to let it go We've been blind so long These colours just seem so wrong Do we belong? Do we belong?\n\n7.\n\nProxy 04:03\n\nMesmerised by hidden signs We're caught in the headlights An instinct from within Slips away, watch it ricochet Through eyes of disarray We've formed a second skin Now modified, we multiply Living to comply New history begins Overthrow We've waited for this moment far too long We are the threat to your position on the throne This sedated world is now gripped by the throat These parasites have been unleashed And we're the host Are we free or is this a dream? Ignoring distant screams We're seeking our desires How the prey get led astray Will we turn away When our hearts are set on fire? Pacified not purified Our minds are tranquilised Nothing will inspire Overthrow We've waited for this moment far too long We are the threat to your position on the throne This sedated world is now gripped by the throat These parasites have been unleashed And we're the host We are the host Fear is just another dirty tool they use To keep us all inside the lines they choose Overthrow We've waited for this moment far too long We are the threat to your position on the throne This sedated world is now gripped by the throat These parasites have been unleashed And we're the host\n\n8.\n\nStates Of Decay 04:35\n\nI've been searching for the reason Seeking what it was that came undone Living life within a shadow This is more than anyone should take I tried to find myself again To learn what I've become This is not a defeat This is honesty The fires we burn to warn the numb And I wonder if you feel the same? You could know a real harmony But you'd just throw it all away You're cutting out the final part of me Just to just throw it all away And I will roam the dark Endlessly searching For something that's not there Totally helpless In this light I taste the fear in you Don't you ever fade away Feeling like there's a glimpse of me in you That never fades away You could know a real harmony But you'd just throw it all away You're cutting out the final part of me Just to just throw it all away I tried to find myself again To learn what I've become\n\n9.\n\nInfinite World 05:44\n\nWe can dream in every spectrum of color We can grasp the equinox of the sun But we question our senses in the light Far away from the scenic landscapes of your onyx eyes I am refracted Then look inside To find interiors soaked in darkness We're moving forwards Observed at distance Reality shows skies as starless Don't speak Now you're listening I've been waiting here Ready for this moment to disappear Into the atmosphere For if this is real I don't want to feel Or see what's revealed The world is collective Of different perspectives Different perspectives We'll fall forever As worlds collide Assimilated and persistent Defining barriers to feel resistance Reality forms our existence Through our eyes We live in an infinite world Through our eyes We live in an infinite world Don't speak Now you're listening I've been waiting here Ready for this moment to disappear Into the atmosphere For if this is real I don't want to feel Or see what's revealed The world is collective Of different perspectives Different perspectives I am refracted\n\n10.\n\nElevation (feat.
