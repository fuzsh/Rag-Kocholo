        "text": "Yeah, amassing 200 million Valis is one thing, but spending them is another...\n\nI've tried all sorts things (levelling up characters, upgrading scene cards, combining materials) and the best way to efficiently \"burn\" them is by upgrading skill levels. When you level up a skill from level 9 to level 10 you will need 1 million Valis (if you don't belong in a familia, which gives a discount to the Valis cost). The materials for skill upgrades are found from daily quests, upgrade quests, battle pass, exchange shop, events and increasing a character's CP rank. You can also combine materials to create materials of a higher grade, for example 3 Proofs of Attack (L) create 1 Proof of Attack (XL). It's a big grind, but it's the best one so far.\n\n200 millions is the same price hestia knife in the anime , i dont understand why they put the same price but with the cost to doing it really...\n\ni am a fan of the anime but when i see no one unlocked the trophy , month's after the release i think it's a crazy long challenge , and i think if you play this game without using the paid with real money case , it's going to a no end challenge time never finish lol.\n\ngood luck with it , maybe i start it one day , maybe not because it's seems too long...\n\n42 minutes ago, Mouton33 said:\n\n200 millions is the same price hestia knife in the anime , i dont understand why they put the same price but with the cost to doing it really...\n\ni am a fan of the anime but when i see no one unlocked the trophy , month's after the release i think it's a crazy long challenge , and i think if you play this game without using the paid with real money case , it's going to a no end challenge time never finish lol.\n\ngood luck with it , maybe i start it one day , maybe not because it's seems too long...\n\nYeahhh its going to be a GRIND. I saw a post online a little while back for a long term player was still under 100k, he did the math and it was another 150ish days at the same pace. Which, as the purpose of this thread states, the game doesn't have endless options to spend money. It is very possible to run into problems with finding ways to spend it as VERY few upgrades are Valis alone, most require you to use other materials, some of which are time-gated or hard to obtain, even if you are a whale.\n\nI've been playing for 30 days almost religiously and have spent 12mil with another 1 mil in my pocket. I could probably blow about 2 mil more without the need for more items.\n\n@NaughtyNoddy idea isn't bad at all, each character (including grades of characters, i.e. SR, SSR, & UR) has 4 skills, if you upgrade from level 9-10 skills at a cost of 1 mil you could do some easy math (200 divided by 4 = 50) so you would need 50 characters ALL with max skills to get 200 mil spent.\n\nObviously, you'll spend money elsewhere and upgrading from 1-9 costs a bit as well, so more likely it's about 40 characters with max skills. I have ~37 characters and hit ALOT of repeats when doing new pulls.\n\nIn short, it's an INSANE grind that will take MONTHS to obtain. The game is only about 6 months old, and there is a roadmap that adds new levels and characters, so hopefully they add new money sinks and easy ways to gain money. But seeing that they are getting rid of the English discord support and English versions of the info are becoming slower and slower doesn't inspire confidence.\n\nTL;DR Shits a grind, both obtaining and spending, possible strat in this thread, updates keep rolling out but English support is slowly disappearing. Not for faint of heart."
