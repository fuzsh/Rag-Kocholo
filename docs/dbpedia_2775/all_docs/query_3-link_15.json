        "text": "Video games about video gaming have a long, poorly documented history. The archetypal meta-game framing device (perhaps inspired by Disney’s Tron) is everyday gamers somehow getting physically drawn into the digital world and having to fight for their lives there. See Kid Chameleon or, uh, Cheetahmen, I guess. The 1983 horror anthology film Nightmares put a rather bizarre spin on the formula in its memorable “Bishop of Battle” segment (starring a young Emilio Estevez!), and the concept made its way to television later in the decade via the title character of NBC’s Captain N: The Game Master cartoon.\n\nA much later example is FX-Unit Yuki: The Henshi Engine, an indie action-platformer/shooter hybrid developed by SaruPro. Originally crowdfunded and released in the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 Super CD-ROM format in 2018, it’s since been ported to the Genesis, Dreamcast, and Switch. I played the PC Engine version because, well, that’s what the game’s all about! Our lead, “average gamer gal” Yuki Shirakawa, has just landed her dream job as a game tester for JEC, makers of the FX Engine console. It soon becomes clear, however, that nefarious agents of JEC’s rival, the SG Corporation, are attempting to sabotage the code of its upcoming titles. The obvious solution is for Yuki’s bosses to plug her into an experimental virtual reality device in order that she might become, in true scantily-clad magical girl style, the mighty FX-Unit Yuki and defend her favorite games from the inside.\n\nYeah, the references here aren’t subtle. Neither is the dialog, which can be downright groan-inducing at times with its emoticons and exclamations of “wut,” “so ridic,” and similar glaring indicators of a middle-aged man trying to write a teenage girl. That said, the still shots that comprise the between-stage cut scenes look good (arguably better than the average in-game pixel art) and the scenes themselves aren’t voiced, so you’re at least spared hearing amateur actors stumble over these feeble lines.\n\nThe meat of FX-Unit Yuki is its eight levels, the majority of which are obviously crafted to resemble the PC Engine’s most iconic hits. In essence, the game is one massive extended homage to the platform itself. This is both its primary draw and its downfall. As a presumed fan of the material, you’re meant to welcome all these nods to the greats with nostalgic warmth and a chuckle or two. This recognition phase passes quickly, though, and you’re then stuck playing through decidedly inferior renditions of some of the best games of all-time. Excited by the prospect of some janky Wonder Boy? Maybe a little sad, ugly Castlevania? Level design in these platforming areas is the most insultingly rudimentary it could possibly be. You walk, whack one or two generic baddies, jump over a hole, and repeat until you start to regret that humanity evolved thumbs. Dull as that is, the two auto-scrolling shooter sequences manage to be drastically worse, with basic enemy patterns that never, and I mean never, get around to varying. The Cotton parody has the saving grace of being relatively short, while the travesty that is the Lords of Thunder one promises to be twelve of the longest minutes of your life. You’ve been warned.\n\nEnter composer Simon Johansson, who thankfully stepped up to furnish FX-Unit Yuki’s one untarnished high point. His songs are universally magnificent and rise so far above the rest of the material they support as to be almost jarring. Any professionally-made game from the PC Engine’s heyday would have been proud to boast tunes like these. Their catchy, driving melodies lend the flat action a much-needed shot of intensity and I can’t imagine being willing to invest the hour plus a full playthrough demands without them.\n\nThat was…harsh, I know. I regret this, as it’s certainly not my intention to come down too hard on poor FX-Unit Yuki. Whatever its shortcomings as a standalone work, one has to acknowledge it as a labor of love produced on the cheap by a very small team of well-meaning hobbyists for a niche system I happen to adore. The world needs more of this sort of thing, not less. It’s tough to really hate on a love letter, even the awkward, sloppy kind you might find scrawled on the back of a cocktail napkin.\n\nLast week, I told you about an obscure early survival horror game inspired by the Alien film franchise and released onto a platform not typically associated with the genre. So I figured I may as well switch things up this time and tell you about an obscure early survival horror game inspired by the Alien film franchise and released onto a platform not typically associated with the genre. In space, no one can hear you repeat yourself.\n\nThat’s not to say that Silent Debuggers for TurboGrafx-16 plays anything at all like Alien 3 for Game Boy. It’s a first-person corridor shooter, for goodness’ sake, meaning that it was attempting to blaze multiple trails at once back in 1991. Figures it was developed by Data East, who seemingly never hesitated to get weird with a project. Bless them for that.\n\nThe game’s background is fed to you via an opening cutscene that both sets the mood with its slick old school anime presentation and calibrates your quality expectations for the English localization, which is a rocky one for sure. Stilted phrasing and bizarre grammatical errors abound in this tale of two hot shot space mercenaries (known as “debuggers”) who find more than they bargained for when they board a derelict space station in search of loot. Their job title comes to ironic fruition as they’re sealed in and forced to clear the sprawling structure of the insectoid monstrosities infesting it in order to escape. Worse, they need to do it before the hundred minute self-destruct timer ticks down. All in a day’s work for an ace debugger, right?\n\nOf course, it’s up to you as the unseen and unnamed member of the duo to do all the actual combat. Your self-proclaimed “buddy” Leon spends the whole game parked in a comfy chair in the station’s central computer room, dispensing iffy advice and nuggets of background info relating to the mystery of where all these creepy monsters came from in the first place. He does do a couple useful things for you, though. First, speaking to him allows you to change your current weapon loadout. You can equip one each of the three primary and three secondary weapons to carry alongside your worthless starting pistol. Very rarely, he’ll offer you a new utility item, such as the vitally important jump unit that teleports you across long distances instantly in exchange for a hefty chunk of battery power. It’s worth checking in every now and then when you’re in the area just on the off chance he has some fresh tech for you.\n\nYour general goal across all six stages is to destroy every monster present so you can move on. It sounds easy enough and would be if the developers hadn’t taken pains to saddle you with complications large and small. The most obvious is the time limit itself. A hundred minutes, no more. Likely less, in fact, since every death results in a five minute penalty and a nasty scolding from Leon. If you want to stay alive, you’ll need to make regular runs back to the station’s lone charging room to top off the battery power that doubles as your health and as ammunition for some of the stronger weapons. Other weapons use conventional bullets instead, but don’t expect that to cut down on your legwork, since you can still only reload them by retreating back to the armory. At least you have a reliable map at your disposal.\n\nAs soon as you’ve grown comfortable with managing your time, energy, and ammo, Silent Debuggers introduces yet another complicating factor in the form of a new monster type that launches dedicated attacks on the station’s far-flung facilities. If a single sector takes too much damage before you can get there and eliminate the bug assaulting it, it’ll shut down and remain inaccessible for the remainder of your playthrough. Yes, that includes the aforementioned charging room and armory, not to mention the power plant (forcing you to navigate the twisty halls in the dark) and the sensor array (which causes your handy portable monster detector to periodically crap out on you). I did mention that these resources never come back, right? And just when you’re starting to grow accustomed to this high stakes base defense component, there’s another hitch thrown your way. It’s relentless.\n\nSilent Debuggers has a mixed reputation online, mainly due to how the relatively low number of distinct enemy types contributes to repetitive battles. That, and for how it implements Wizardry-style gridded maze movement instead of the smooth scrolling seen in later efforts like id’s Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. It’s barely a blip on the majority of TurboGrafx-16 ranking lists and although I certainly can’t argue that it’s a brilliant example of a first-person shooter, I did find it to be quite the solid survival horror romp. Its pattern of springing constant insidious surprises on the player continues all the way through to the sixth and final area, making for one masterful white knuckle ride. Losing your lights or sensors over an hour in is utterly brutal. Even if Leon’s gadgets can alleviate the pain a bit, they still take up precious inventory space and thus leave you at a disadvantage.\n\nOn top of being tense, immersive, and sporting respectable graphics and music for the format, Silent Debuggers is also more influential than I might have expected. The way your sensors utilize directional stereo sound to assist you in pinpointing hostile aliens was adopted and refined for Kenji Eno’s 1996 Saturn cult classic Enemy Zero. It’s a shame that this freaky little Data East experiment came and went with all the silence its name implies. I highly recommend it if you’re in the mood for something damn near diametrically opposed to the straightforward, arcadey fare the TG-16 is famous for.\n\nWhen we last left plucky high schooler Yuko, she’d been transported to the mystical world of Vecanti, gifted the mighty Valis sword (along with a set of kinky bikini armor), and used her fresh new gear to vanquish the evil tyrant Rogles before returning to Tokyo to resume her everyday life. Valis II unsurprisingly sees her doing pretty much that exact thing again, except that Rogles’ older brother, Megas, is the one causing a ruckus this time.\n\nOriginal it’s not, though that was never really the point of the series to begin with. Valis titles were meant to show off scantily-clad anime girls to the greatest extent the technology of the time allowed. On the TurboGrafx-16 (and its Japanese counterpart, the PC Engine) that meant leveraging the console’s CD-ROM functionality to cram as many voiced cutscenes as possible in between the decidedly rote side-view action stages. Assuming you can make your peace with that, the games proper tend to make for breezy lightweight diversions. They’re nothing you haven’t seen done before, and better, but you can conversely do worse.\n\nWhile very much cast from this mold, 1989’s Valis II also holds the dubious distinction of being the weakest of the four Valis entries produced for the hardware. The nominal first outing, Mugen Senshi Valis, is a 1992 remake with significantly upgraded control, mechanics, and visuals. Parts III and IV and generally more full-featured due to their multiple playable characters. That leaves the comparatively basic and dowdy II as the odd one out.\n\nYuko’s goal is to jump and slash her way through five extremely long levels before moving on to a sixth and final one that takes the form of a relatively brief auto-scroller. The sheer length of the stages is arguably Valis II’s Achilles’ heel. By the halfway point of each, I was well and truly tired of swatting at the same handful of enemies in front of the same mediocre backgrounds. Compounding this is the overall lack of dynamic platforming scenarios or interesting environmental hazards. It’s a no-frills “walk forward and hammer that attack button” sort of game. Bosses are nothing to thrill over, either, unless you count the chuckles their amateurish pre-fight voice acting frequently elicits. You can outlast most by simply staying put and firing away until they explode.\n\nThe designers put in a token attempt to add some variety via the inclusion of four different projectile shot pickups for the Valis sword and a handful of limited-use magic abilities like a rotating shield and a time freeze. Again, however, these are hardly revelatory by genre standards. In a crowning irony, the saga’s trademark element, its cutscenes, are actually displayed smaller and in lower detail here than in later installments, too. That leaves the soundtrack to stand as the sole unqualified high point. Smooth ’80s synth and drum machine ditties that wouldn’t have been out of place in any given anime of the era? Sign me up for that!\n\nWhen all is said and done, Valis II is a work profoundly of its time. Its presentation alone made it a standout during that brief interval when the TurboGrafx/PC Engine was poised at the cutting edge of the industry, effectively the first and only CD-ROM gaming platform. That hype sold units and made a lasting impression on the public at large. Even kids like me, who only knew of it from magazine screenshots and their accompanying effusive text blurbs. Can I recommend is as an isolated action-platforming experience all these years later? Nah. But I instead prefer to view it as a one-of-a-kind digital time capsule, worth a quick playthrough purely to glimpse how the future looked back at the dawn of the 1990s.\n\nIrem’s Legend of Hero Tonma is another of those largely forgotten minor efforts that’s primarily known today as a “holy grail” collector’s item. The 1989 arcade original was ported to the Japanese PC Engine in 1991 and that same version eventually made it to the North American TurboGrafx-16 in 1993. As a late TG-16 release, you can expect to pay upwards of $700 U.S. for a physical copy today. Not that I’d recommend it.\n\nTonma (or Tommy, as the ending screen inexplicably dubs him) is an apprentice wizard who sets out to rescue a princess from a demon called the Evil Lord. And if you think the main antagonist’s name is lazy, at least he gets one. Oh, well. You’ve saved one princess, you’ve saved them all, right? The only bright spots in what passes for storytelling here are the between-level text crawls, which are rendered in a charming sort of almost-broken English. Although it’s not hopelessly mangled or anything, the phrasing is just odd enough to signify a non-native speaker. It’s tough not to grin at gems like “Young man, you’d better go back here. Do you think that you can return alive once you go into this island? You must regret it later.”\n\nSadly, this general lack of inspiration pervades LoHT as a whole. Taken as a late ’80s vintage side-view run-and-gun, it’s a far cry from the likes of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts or Contra. It’s not shoddy work by any means. Irem was better than that. For me, though, it comes across as rather flat and workmanlike at best. Its six stages hit the usual stock fantasy notes (forest, dungeon, castle, etc.) and include a mix of horizontal and vertical scrolling. Tonma’s standard attack is a rapid-fire straight shot that can be upgraded up to two times for greater width and damage. He can also equip one of three secondary weapon pickups at a time: Homing shots, an overhead arcing bomb, and dual wall hugging blasts. One-hit deaths are in effect unless he’s managed to grab one of the rare rotating energy shields capable of absorbing a limited number of enemy shots. The presence of collectable coins and money bags had me hoping that a shop system was in place. No dice, as these simply add to your score. Tonma’s final trick is the ability to slow his fall and glide when you hold up on the directional pad mid-jump. I didn’t end up using it a lot, myself, as the platforming isn’t particularly complex.\n\nI wouldn’t exactly deem this a hard playthrough, despite the one-hit deaths. You’d no doubt need to sacrifice many a coin to the arcade cabinet in order to reach the end, but the frequent checkpoints and unlimited continues of the home conversion make for fairly smooth progress. I completed my first run in about an hour. A master of the game could manage it in under fifteen minutes.\n\nLegend of Hero Tonma is never anything more, or less, than alright. It’s one of those “Yup, this exists” games that doesn’t venture to look, sound, or play especially good or bad, ultimately leaving it no more memorable than its nameless princess. Given that it was already thoroughly average by 1989 standards, the fact that it didn’t reach American shores until four years later effectively ensured that it wouldn’t succeed in bolstering the TurboGrafx’s ailing reputation any. Contra III or Gunstar Heroes it’s not. Still, I’d say it’s worth an hour of your time, if not anywhere near 700 of your dollars.\n\nI’m almost four hundred reviews into this project now and I swear that if I have to cover one more game where a magic Slinky battles the Zodiac signs, I’m going to puke. Sometimes I feel as if princess rescues, alien invasions, and weaponized children’s toys versus astrology are all I ever get to write about anymore. Exasperating!\n\nOkay, okay. Clearly I’m easing you into a spiel on how Atlus games as a rule tend to be experimental, even outright weird. Some, like 1991’s Somer Assault here, are both. Also known as Mesopotamia in Japan, this one-of-a-kind action romp defies easy explanation. The very first thing it expects you to do is enter your birth date, for reasons that are not immediately apparent. An opening cut scene then depicts the villain, a conspicuously busty unnamed sorceress, using her crystal ball to call up twelve evil spirits based on the Zodiac in order to “fulfill her conquest to rule the world!” That’s when your pink Slinky avatar appears in the ball and announces that he (?) will be having none of that nonsense.\n\nIn keeping with its esoteric theme, Somer Assault is divided into twelve stages. Your goal in each is to slink your way to the boss room and defeat it before time runs out. This is easier said than done, as I found the time limits to be a much bigger factor here than in the majority of contemporary console titles. In the latter half especially, I ended up losing a life to the timer at least once on practically every stage. You do end up respawning in place when this happens, thankfully, so I wasn’t having to restart entire levels from scratch as a result.\n\nThe environmentss themselves are surreal, consisting of mazelike arrangements of stonework seemingly floating in front of various abstract backdrops. Your hero-Slinky is constantly attached to a wall or ceiling and can shoot in up to eight directions. The angle of fire is always determined by your positioning. For example, shooting at a 45-degree angle requires a corner to perch on. Standard enemies show up to pester you throughout, although their implementation is among the game’s weakest aspects. I counted a grand total of four enemy types. While these poor sods fall to a single shot and thus present no challenge, they are useful for farming the power-ups, which include health bar extensions, healing, speed ups, and ricochet bullets.\n\nSomer Assault perks up considerably whenever you reach a boss room. It’s clear that these guys are what the developers were keen to invest the lion’s share of their creativity and time on. Literally, in the case of Leo. Boss sprites look great and represent their associated signs well. That said, they’re quite uneven in terms of difficulty. For every Gemini or Libra that has dead obvious safe spots in its arena, there’s a Leo or Virgo that emits a chaotic torrent of virtually unavoidable shots. In the latter case, the only solution I found was to park myself and hammer away, hoping they fell before I did. Oh, and this is also where that birthday thing from the beginning comes into play. The boss corresponding to the date you entered will hurl power-ups at you in place of its regular attacks. Cute.\n\nUp until the very end, I was rather enjoying Somer Assault. Sure, it came off a tad awkward and half-baked at times, but it had a certain off-kilter moxie about it simply by virtue of being the lone entry in the mystical slink-‘n-gun genre. An outlandish yet fairly playable concept bolstered by some cool boss graphics and a classically twangy HuCard soundtrack courtesy of Yoshimi Haishita and Kōji Takino? I’ll take it!\n\nThen I reached the sorceress . . . and was reminded why I maintain a strict policy of never reviewing a game I haven’t finished. Somer Assault’s three phase final boss battle is a jarring kick in the teeth, easily tougher than the remainder of the game leading up to it as a whole. That’s no exaggeration, as I breezed through the twelve stages only to spend a good couple hours grinding this one fight with the unlimited continues afforded as my sole lifeline. Each form is a major bullet sponge requiring hundreds of hits and has attacks that are either legitimately impossible to dodge consistently or require such superhuman execution to do so that they may as well be. Needless to say, I was no longer amused. After finally slinking my way to a narrow victory, I switched off the system vowing never to touch this one again. An aggravating end to a once promising playthrough. Perhaps I should have checked my horoscope that morning.\n\nJust one year after Hudson Soft published Air Zonk, one of the finest of the TurboGrafx-16’s many auto-scrolling shooters, they gave us a sequel, Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly-Paradise. Heroic cyborg-with-attitude Zonk is back to battle a new plot by King Drool and his henchmen to take over Earth. Except they’re calling the lead baddie Emperor Sandrovich this time for some reason. Don’t worry, he’s the same reptile bastard Zonk veterans already know and hate.\n\nTrue to its name, Super Air Zonk used the expanded memory of the Super CD-ROM format to realize what should have been an even more polished and bombastic sequel. Unfortunately, for reasons we may never be entirely sure of, Super Air Zonk largely squanders its theoretical technical advantages, coming across as an oddly muted and perfunctory follow-up. If I had to speculate, I might point to Hudson’s choice of development studio. The first Air Zonk was the work of Red Company, the established shooting game masters behind the likes of Gate of Thunder and Lords of Thunder. Super Air Zonk was contracted out to Dual, who’d previously worked on . . . Predator for the NES. Huh.\n\nIn any event, Super Air Zonk not only fails to live up to its CD-ROM hype, it underperforms relative to the humble HuCard original. Practically all of its predecessor’s impressive parallax scrolling background work is absent. The CD music, which is mostly in the playful rockabilly style you’d expect, packs less energy and fewer memorable melodies than the last game’s chiptunes. This tidal wave of mediocrity surges clear over the presentation to inundate the gameplay proper, too. Levels here are significantly less hectic. Air Zonk’s positively insane enemy design has been toned down considerably. And power-ups? Forget ’em! Gone are the seven unique shot types with their own charge attacks. Zonk has now been downgraded to a basic straight shot and bomb combo.\n\nOne element that is thankfully still present is Zonk’s group of helpful companions, which can merge with him to provide new offensive abilities. Alas, they, too, are shadows of their former selves. They’ve been reduced in number from ten to seven and you can no longer choose which ones you’d prefer to bring along with you. Instead, you’ll meet a preset companion midway through each of the seven stages. In other words, player choice is never a factor. What precious little power-up potential is present always manifests itself in the exact same way on every playthrough. Not a great sign for any shooter.\n\nThis review is quite short (by my logorrheic standard, at least) and almost entirely dismissive. Strange as it seems, however, I’m not necessarily saying that you should avoid Super Air Zonk. Yes, it’s half the game its forebear was, if that, but I found it to be an adequate enough lightweight diversion. Its world and characters retain no small measure of charm. The graphics are colorful and the tunes catchy. Tame enemy placement, a ready supply of extra lives, and unlimited continues make it a serviceable casual or introductory shooter as well. It was a late release for the console and the physical disk is consequently one of the most expensive out there, tipping the scales at U.S. $800 and up as of this writing. Personally, I wouldn’t venture to pay 5% of that on the strength of the action alone. If you have a way of running it for free, though, I can think of far worse ways to kill an hour or so.\n\nBy this point, I think I have a pretty good grasp of what a typical early ’90s CD-ROM game from Telenet Japan is: A short, bare bones playthrough bolstered by some sweet music and lavish (for the time) cinematic cut scenes. Last Alert, Mugen Senshi Valis, and my subject this week, Exile, are all cut from this same cloth. These are true style-over-substance exercises centered on showcasing the flashier possibilities of the new storage medium above all else. Not objectionably so, thankfully, as the gameplay that is present is always broadly competent. Still, top billing rightfully goes to the soundtrack and cut scenes. It turns out that Exile also has its very own ace in the hole, though, courtesy of its English localization by Working Designs.\n\nExile’s plot is a wild one. Our hero, Sadler, is an Assassin, and I don’t just mean in the informal sense of a dude who murders people. He’s a member of the Nizari Ismailis, the original Shiite Muslim sect that inspired the term via a corrupted form of the Arabic hasisi (“hashish-eater”), this moniker being based on the group’s supposed ritual drug use. The historical Assassins thrived in the 11th through 13th centuries, right around the same time the Crusades were in full swing. With these Christian invaders rampaging through his homeland, Sadler and his rotating cast of NPC buddies set off in search of a way to put an end to the strife. Along the way, they get wrapped with Templar knights, druids, and even a bit of time travel, among other things. And yes, that makes this a video game with Assassins, Templars, and a time travel gimmick well over a decade before Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed franchise kicked off. Coincidence? Beats me.\n\nActual play is divided up into two main modes. One is a simplified Dragon Quest style overhead view in which Sadler and company stroll around chatting up the locals for clues on where to go next and browsing shops. Entering specific buildings triggers the transition to the side-view action-platforming mode where all combat takes place. Here, Sadler can jump, duck, slash with his sword, and activate a small number of magic spells. Magic is quite limited, comprising only fire and ice projectiles plus a healing spell. It’s all rather basic, but it gets the job done. As this is technically an RPG, slashing up baddies will eventually result in permanent health and magic gauge increases. I recommend you do this right away, in fact, since taking a few minutes to grind out five or six extra levels on the rapidly respawning bugs in the first area will result in much smoother progress throughout.\n\nThat’s about all you need to know to play Exile. It’s hardly what I’d call a deep experience. You’re rarely able to pick between more than two or three locations to visit at any given time, making exploration almost nonexistent. Nor is there puzzle solving per se. If you need a certain item for your quest, you’ll eventually come across it in the natural course of play with no real thought required. It reminds me of Gargoyle’s Quest on the Game Boy in that all its RPG trappings are ultimately window dressing. That leaves the action-platforming as the main event and it’s serviceable at best. It lacks a noteworthy twist or gimmick to set it apart from any other game where some guy swings a sword at monsters.\n\nEnter Working Designs. As mentioned in a few of my previous reviews, this now-defunct publisher was both loved and hated by the gaming public for its irreverent approach to English localization. Their work on Exile was further complicated by a firm directive from platformer holder NEC, who wanted the English version scrubbed of its potentially controversial real world religious themes. These two factors combine to make the TurboGrafx-16 release of Exile one weird, wacky trip. The religious whitewashing is hilariously paper-thin. Christians are now, get this, Clispins. As if we still couldn’t figure out who these maniacs with bright red crosses on their outfits rampaging through the Middle East are supposed to be. It’s even funnier when the hammy amateur voice actors are forced to say it aloud. Clispins . . . Lord have mercy. On top of that, the trademark Working Designs playfulness clashes garishly with some of the more serious situations. In what I’m sure was meant to be a harrowing moment, a heretic burning at the stake quips about how much he hates mesquite. If that wasn’t silly enough, Sadler’s reply to him made me drop the controller, I was laughing so hard. The contrast between the original intent and the script we were given is so bizarre that I can’t help loving it.\n\nOn the whole, I can recommend Exile. It’s not brilliant or essential or anything like that, just a no-frills action RPG with quality music and some semi-accidental laugh-out-loud moments. It commits no egregious design sins and is thus a decent enough way to pass three hours or so. Telenet Japan delivers again, provided you keep your expectations nice and modest.\n\nBy 1993, publisher Hudson Soft’s effort to engineer a Mario-esque platforming star for their PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 console had proven reasonably successful. Adorable cartoon caveman Bonk, or PC Genjin as he’s known in Japan, already had two best sellers to his name, Bonk’s Adventure and Bonk’s Revenge, not to mention a spin-off shooter in Air Zonk. Enter Bonk 3: Bonk’s Big Adventure, the closing chapter in the original trilogy.\n\nThis installment has the odd distinction of being a multi-format title, first debuting on HuCard in 1993 and then later on CD-ROM. With the exception of their soundtracks, the two versions are functionally identical. That said, Bonk 3 represents more than just the character’s final outing on the platform of his “birth.” It also serves as a playable epitaph for the TurboGrafx-16 itself, seeing as how its CD iteration was the last official release for the ill-fated system here in North America in December of 1994. That seems fitting, given the high degree of affection the megacephalic mascot had garnered by that time.\n\nDevelopment duty on Bonk 3 was farmed out to A.I, as opposed to Red Company, who had handled both previous installments. A.I ended up sticking quite close to Red’s established formula. Perhaps too close, as Bonk 3 verges on being a carbon copy of Bonk’s Revenge at times, albeit with a single underdeveloped gimmick and ever-so-slightly less polish overall.\n\nSaid gimmick is alluded to in the subtitle. Bonk 3 introduces magical candies that alter our prehistoric hero’s size, shrinking him down to ankle height or blowing him up into a true giant. Lewis Carroll would approve. These effects last until Bonk either takes a hit or touches a candy of the opposite type. Although the idea certainly had promise, the gameplay rarely capitalizes on it. Tiny Bonk gains the ability to fit into a handful of narrow passages that usually lead to 1-Ups, bonus stages, and other nice but nonessential goodies. Big Bonk’s sole purpose seems to be spectacle; the sheer novelty of controlling a sprite that’s half the height of the screen. He’s not nearly as devastating to his puny opposition as you’d think, though. Quite the opposite, really, since he’s a massive target that can be deflated with a single touch. Ultimately, the best thing to come out of the size changing mechanic is one excellent boss battle where it’s actually used against Bonk.\n\nAside from the candy shenanigans, Bonk 3 is pure retread: Six more rounds of side-scrolling hop-and-bop action where you smash baddies with Bonk’s oversized cranium, collect meat and smiley faces, and gradually make your way to series archvillain King Drool, who’s up to his same old trick of stealing a portion of the moon to convert into his home base. I don’t mean to come across as overly dismissive with that summary, mind you. Sure, none of this content will seem remotely fresh to someone playing through these games in release order. That’s not to say that there’s anything strictly wrong with it, however. The classic Bonk blueprint works! My own subjective impression is that the art, music, and level design were all a tad stronger in Bonk’s Revenge, but it’s not as if Bonk 3 took a major hit in these departments. Any decline is slight indeed.\n\nShould you play Bonk 3? Absolutely! It’s a quality platformer blessed with the tight control, colorful graphics, bouncy music, and profoundly strange enemy design that put the franchise on the map. Relaxed difficulty and unlimited continues keep it broadly accessible, too. While it’s no innovator, it does its lineage proud. In fact, the biggest strike against it, the insane secondary market price for physical copies, has nothing at all to do with the game proper and is entirely an artifact of its late release. No wonder Bonk himself would survive the sad death of the TurboGrafx, moving on to the comparatively greener pastures of the Super Nintendo and Game Boy.\n\nNeutopia III? Go home, Hudson Soft. You’re drunk.\n\nNeutopia II, on the other hand…Well, it sure is more Neutopia, alright. Hudson’s original 1989 riff on the first Legend of Zelda was a thoroughly competent, if ironically unadventurous action-adventure. Its 1991 follow-up adds the ability to move and attack in eight directions versus four, a few extra weapons, and some larger, deadlier labyrinths. Apart from that, however, it looks, sounds, and plays nearly identical to its predecessor. A second straight clone of 1986 vintage Zelda the same year Link to the Past debuted may have seemed somewhat old-fashioned to gamers at the time, but I can appreciate it for what it is here and now.\n\nJazeta, hero of Neutopia, has disappeared after departing on a quest to investigate the rumored resurrection of his archenemy, the demon lord Dirth. Now, monsters are swarming the land and Jazeta’s young son, whom you get to name, must take up the sword and follow in his father’s footsteps. It’s fundamentally the same setup as last time: Get the magic thingies from the dungeons to stop the bad guy. That said, uncovering the fate of Jazeta does at least provide some added engagement for returning fans.\n\nAnother thing that hasn’t changed is the linear progression. If anything, Hudson doubled down on that. Neutopia’s overworld was divided up into four quadrants and you needed to complete all the objectives in the current one before you could move on to the next. This time, the world consists of around twice as many discrete chunks. Despite that, it isn’t any bigger overall. This means that you’ll finish a dungeon in order to open up, at most, the next couple dozen screens. I found the resulting lack of player-directed exploration to be rather stifling, although I will concede that it may well appeal to the crowd that really hates getting lost in their games.\n\nThe expanded combat mechanics and more difficult labyrinths simultaneously represent the best and worst of Neutopia II. Eight-way movement is a welcome change indeed. Less so the new weapons. The enchanted fire rod that served as Jazeta’s primary ranged attack is joined here by wind and lightning equivalents. As cool as it sounds to wreak all sorts of elemental havoc on the monster hordes, rods deal far less damage than your mundane sword and have a nasty habit of knocking opponents directly towards you for sudden free hits. It’s for this latter reason that I rarely used them at all unless there was either a solid barrier between me and my target or said target was a boss monster and therefore not subject to the regular knockback. The final two offensive options come with severe drawbacks, as well. The flail docks you ten gold coins with every swing and the boomerang can be lost permanently if you fail to catch it on the rebound. Fun. So, yeah, I stuck to my stubby sword for the most part.\n\nAs for the dungeons, the majority actually impressed me. In addition to clearing out room after room of baddies as before, there’s an increased emphasis on negotiating spikes, conveyor belts, and other tricky terrain. Dirth himself gets a proper pyramid lair, too, something sorely missing from Neutopia. Unfortunately, the sheer size of one late game maze in particular proved to be a major stumbling block. I’m talking 95 rooms spread out over five floors, plus a single needle-in-a-haystack hidden one housing a mandatory item! Between memorizing the layout, figuring out how to survive long enough to reach the boss, and pinpointing that one lousy wall I needed to bomb, I probably spent a good third of my playthrough on this single dungeon. It’s a total pace killer, especially since it isn’t even the finale.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, though. I quite enjoyed Neutopia II. It retains that tried-and-true overhead fantasy adventure formula, backed up by Hudson’s usual crisp, colorful graphics and superb chiptunes. The problem, such as it is, is merely that I didn’t enjoy it any more than the previous installment. For every step forward the gameplay takes, there’s a corresponding step back. Ultimately, it amounts to a lateral move. Like father, like son.\n\nMilitary-themed run-and-gun shooters were a mainstay of ’80s gaming. No arcade or home console library was complete without these grim depictions of lone wolf super soldiers machine gunning their way through legions of faceless goons. Primarily inspired by the international phenomenon that was the Rambo film franchise, a few of them even starred the man himself, though most publishers opted for stand-in ptotagonists over shelling out those big Stallone bucks.\n\nEnter Shin-Nihon Laser Soft, a short-lived subsidiary of Telenet Japan that brought Red Alert to the PC Engine in 1989. Red Alert’s claim to fame was its use of the system’s then cutting edge CD-ROM peripheral to add anime style cutscenes and voice acting to the familiar overhead run-and-gun formula. But a funny thing happened on the way to Red Alert’s North American debut as Last Alert the following year. Literally. The Japanese version’s generally respectable voice work was replaced with an amateur English dub so out-and-out ludicrous that it’s likely the only reason Last Alert is remembered at all these days. I’m reminded of how the Mega Drive port of Zero Wing’s “all your base are belong to us” opening scene has long since eclipsed any discussion of its merits as a game.\n\nIronically, this goofy dub is about the best thing that could have happened to Last Alert. Getting to hear our chisled one man army protagonist Guy Kazama spout lines like “Garcia, nobody can hire my feelings!” with all the grace and gravitas of a high school drama dork hopped up on Mountain Dew is vastly more entertaining than the action on offer. Not to say that the gameplay here is horrible. Last Alert is certainly playable and doesn’t suffer from any especially egregious design missteps. At same time, however, I can’t escape the feeling that those CD bells and whistles were the main point all along.\n\nI can describe Guy Kazama’s campaign against the sinister Force Project and their world-threatening superweapon Indra in two words: Long and mediocre. I’m talking no less than 23 stages of the most resolutely average small arms combat ever programmed. Guy can move and attack in the expected eight directions. One button fires his unlimited ammo gun and the other deploys grenades, homing missiles, and other limited use backup weapons. Most stages require Guy to simply reach and defeat a boss at the end. A handful include miscellaneous objectives, such as rescuing hostages or planting bombs, that must be accomplished for the boss to appear. The bulk of the opposition is made up of bog standard grunts who’ll either stand in place and take the occasional potshot at Guy or slowly jog after him while doing the same. Yes, it all works and yes, it grows quite tiresome by the halfway mark. At least it’s also remarkably easy, so you won’t have to waste any more of your time on memorization or practice.\n\nThe only standout mechanic for me is the experience system. Hitting certain score thresholds will gradually level Guy up from his starting rank of Ranger all the way up to a rank nineteen Super Hero. Every level adds another box to Guy’s health meter and a new, more powerful gun is added to his inventory every four levels or so. It’s a solid idea in the context of a lengthier take on the genre and I got more enjoyment out of seeing what my next rank title and weapon upgrade would be than I did out of the actual gunfights.\n\nVisually, the sparse backgrounds and underdetailed sprites are barely a step up from those seen in Capcom’s Commando four years prior. That’s an eternity in ’80s game development terms. We can’t blame the hardware for this, either. Data East’s Bloody Wolf made it to the PC Engine a few months before Last Alert (on a regular low-capacity HuCard, I might add) and still managed to look significantly nicer. The soundtrack fares a bit better, although it never approaches the dizzying heights of a Lords of Thunder or Ys Book I & II.\n\nLast Alert isn’t much to look at and is entirely too basic and repetitive to sustain player interest over the minimum ninety minutes or so it takes to complete a playthrough. As far as old school commando bloodbaths on the TurboGrafx-16 go, the aforementioned Bloody Wolf is the superior game. On the other hand, my fellow lovers of all things camp will treasure every misbegotten syllable of Last Alert’s dialog. If you’re the type to sit through an incompetent movie just for the “so bad, it’s good” factor, you’ll be right at home blasting away as Guy Kazama."
