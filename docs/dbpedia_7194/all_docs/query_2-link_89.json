        "text": "When someone thinks of football in the modern day and age, they think of quarterbacks. And without hesitation, too. They think of wizards like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen creating magic out of nothing, making the impossible seem like a breeze. But once upon a time, the NFL was viewed differently. When people thought about football, they thought about linebackers, indefatigable defensive field generals who struck fear into the hearts of those \"pretty boy\" offensive players on the other team.\n\nEven if they're technically less important now -- depending on whom you ask anyway -- linebackers are still important NFL fulcrums we can't quite overlook just yet.\n\nREAD MORE NFL:\n\nThe linebacker conversation in 2024 starts and ends with names like the San Francisco 49ers' Fred Warner and the Baltimore Ravens' Roquan Smith. But all-around defensive dynamos like them never get to where they are without the legendary linebackers who paved their path. Men who gave names like Warner and Smith a thoroughway to changing the game in their own right.\n\nBelow is a ranking of the greatest off-ball linebackers ever to play professional football. They were merciless intimidators. They were remarkable playmakers. Most of all, they were steadfast leaders, never wavering in the face of adversity.\n\nNote: While I did not discriminate between inside or outside linebackers, those who were primarily known for rushing the passer off the edge were not included because that is a different position with different responsibilities.\n\n10. Chuck Bednarik\n\nTeams: Philadelphia Eagles (1949-1962)\n\nAccolades: 2-time NFL champion, 8-time Pro Bowler, 10-time First-Team All-Pro\n\nOn a list of the greatest overall players ever, Bednarik would likely be higher.\n\nBut his splitting duty as the rare two-way player at linebacker and center means we can only judge him on his defensive prowess. Of course, that isn't to say Bednarik was a slouch. For someone who never left the field of play, the legendary \"60-Minute Man\" was a relentless menace. He was known for his punishing tackling style and was a Pro Bowler and All-Pro for eight of his first nine seasons in Philadelphia.\n\n9. Brian Urlacher\n\nTeams: Chicago Bears (2000-2012)\n\nAccolades: Defensive Player of the Year (2005), Defensive Rookie of the Year (2000), 8-time Pro Bowler, 4-time First-Team All-Pro, solo tackles leader (2002)\n\nA revolutionary titan of the game, Urlacher was arguably one of the most complete linebackers ever to play football. Thus, it should be no surprise that the first of three iconic Bears linebackers appears on this list.\n\nTailor-made for an era that embraced the forward pass more than ever, Urlacher simultaneously shut down rushing offenses by racing like a rocket from sideline to sideline while also covering a third of the field by himself like a free safety. He was essentially designed in a lab to helm the famous Cover-2 defense. An all-worldly versatile playmaker, Urlacher amassed over 1,300 tackles, nearly 140 tackles-for-loss, over 40 sacks, and 22 interceptions during his illustrious career with Chicago.\n\n8. Derrick Brooks\n\nTeams: Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1995-2008)\n\nAccolades: Super Bowl 37 champion, Defensive Player of the Year (2002), 11-time Pro Bowler, 5-time First-Team All-Pro, 3-time solo tackles leader, combined tackles leader (1998)\n\nA supreme athlete, Brooks accrued at least 100 tackles in 12 of his 14 seasons in Tampa Bay. Another prototype linebacker for the Cover-2, Brooks played with more of a downhill, \"beat everyone up\" style while still erasing the middle of the field in the passing game. That unsurprisingly made him the Buccaneers' centerpiece during their run to their first Super Bowl championship in franchise history in 2002.\n\nHere's a fun fact about Brooks: He never missed a single game in 14 seasons. Not one. An ultimate ironman, he had 224 possible appearances and was always there between the lines. Imagine playing one of the most physical positions in the sport and still coming to play every Sunday.\n\nAlong with his playmaking and leadership, Brooks' durability made him one of one.\n\n7. Jack Lambert\n\nTeams: Pittsburgh Steelers (1974-1984)\n\nAccolades: 4-time Super Bowl champion, Defensive Player of the Year (1976), Defensive Rookie of the Year (1974), 9-time Pro Bowler, 6-time First-Team All-Pro\n\nIn the 1970s, there was nothing more intimidating as an offensive player than seeing Lambert's largely toothless grin in black and gold staring back at you across the line of scrimmage. One of the truly great Steelers in their history, Lambert was a Pro Bowler for virtually the entire length of his career while captaining the legendary \"Steel Curtain\" defense. They simply and unironically don't make defensive anchors of Lambert's mold anymore.\n\n6. Ted Hendricks\n\nTeams: Indianapolis Colts (1969-1973), Green Bay Packers (1974), Las Vegas Raiders (1975-1983)\n\nAccolades: 4-time Super Bowl champion, 8-time Pro Bowler, 4-time First-Team All-Pro\n\nStanding at a lanky 6-foot-7, 220 pounds, Hendricks utilized his unique frame to enjoy one of the more decorated and winningest careers in NFL history. As a linebacker, Hendricks had an unthinkable five seasons with at least three picks. If pass deflections had been counted as an official statistic in his heyday, we'd appreciate his long arms and reach even more. A key piece to four separate Super Bowl championship teams (one with the Colts, three with the Raiders), Hendricks was instrumental to four separate blowout wins where the opposing team imploded in on itself on offense.\n\nHendricks' length and athleticism made him a football unicorn, and they give him a deserving top-6 spot on this list.\n\n5. Jack Ham\n\nTeams: Pittsburgh Steelers (1971-1982)\n\nAccolades: 4-time Super Bowl champion, 8-time Pro Bowler, 6-time First-Team All-Pro\n\nOne of the more versatile linebackers in league history, Ham was a playmaking machine. He forced 53 turnovers in his career, which to this day is still the most ever for a linebacker. A lightning-quick player, Ham used his speed and elusiveness to help tighten up the edges for one of the best defenses in NFL history. He was a menace, the Steelers' underrated secret weapon on defense.\n\n4. Mike Singletary\n\nTeams: Chicago Bears (1981-1992)\n\nAccolades: Super Bowl 20 champion, 2-time Defensive Player of the Year, 10-time Pro Bowler, 7-time First-Team All-Pro\n\nThe intensity of Singletary's signature stare only underscored how he earned the apt nickname \"Samurai Mike.\" Another iconic Bears linebacker, Singletary has one of the most productive resumes for any NFL defender ever. Armed with an uncanny ability to read the play and jump the snap count, Singletary patrolled the line of scrimmage like a tenacious sentry, hell-bent on making any offensive player who entered his territory pay. Singletary was the best defensive player on arguably the best defense the NFL has ever seen in 1985, and he was the unquestioned face of the last true Bears golden era anyone can still remember.\n\n3. Junior Seau\n\nTeams: Los Angeles Chargers (1990-2002), Miami Dolphins (2003-2005), New England Patriots (2006-2009)\n\nAccolades: 12-time Pro Bowler, 6-time First-Team All-Pro, solo tackles co-leader (1994)\n\nFew players had the complete package quite like Seau. I'm not talking about overall responsibility. I'm talking about a player who was the definition of a sure tackle the moment he got his hands on a ball carrier. I'm talking about a player who sometimes seemingly diagnosed plays so well that it was as if he understood the opposing offense better than it understood itself. Seau was the heart and tactician of every defense he played on in his NFL career. Fittingly, he is still third all-time in total career tackles with 1,847.\n\n2. Ray Lewis\n\nTeams: Baltimore Ravens (1996-2012)\n\nAccolades: 2-time Super Bowl champion, Super Bowl 35 MVP, 2-time Defensive Player of the Year, 13-time Pro Bowler, 7-time First-Team All-Pro, 3-time solo tackles leader, 3-time combined tackles leader\n\nAn enforcer. A leader. A playmaker. A fireball of intensity, rage, and focus. Lewis wore every hat during his storybook career with the Ravens without missing a beat. He was the best player on the 2000 Ravens defense, another candidate for the best defense in league history. However, because of Lewis' energy and production, the Ravens were never slouches on defense, regardless. Lewis is one of only two linebackers ever to win Super Bowl MVP in a season in which he also captured DPOY honors.\n\nIf not for the dominant trailblazer at the top of this list, Lewis would be known as the unquestioned best linebacker ever. He can take solace knowing he's still one of the finest pure defenders of all time.\n\n1. Dick Butkus\n\nTeams: Chicago Bears (1975-1983)\n\nAccolades: 2-time Defensive Player of the Year, 8-time Pro Bowler, 5-time First-Team All-Pro\n\nIf not for knee injuries, there would be no debate about the best linebacker ever to play in the NFL. Even then, Butkus' peak as a man in the middle for the league's charter franchise is hard to argue with. Butkus' trademark mean disposition made him akin to a malevolent demon from hell who reveled in the pain and fear of offensive skill players. That's not even really hyperbole. A one-man wrecking crew, Butkus established the Bears' now-rich tradition at linebacker, making it more of an honor to play tough-nosed, blue-collar defense for Chicago than any of those \"flashy\" positions like, I don't know, quarterback.\n\nIt is no coincidence that:\n\n1. The Butkus Award is given to the nation's finest linebackers in high school, college, and the NFL every season\n\n2. Ray Lewis counted Butkus as one of his main inspirations toward becoming an all-time linebacker himself.\n\nButkus' thick, bushy eyebrows, mustache, and grimace make him one of the faces of the most important organizations in NFL history. He was the best linebacker ever."
