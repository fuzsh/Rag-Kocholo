He attended Black School, North of Cassville to receive the education which served him throughout his 78 years 7 months and 21 days before he departed this mortal plane shortly before noon Friday, April 1, 1988 in Springfield, Green County, Missouri. Melvin Aubrey Bradley (known to everyone as \"Aubrey\") was a lifelong resident of the area except for a period during World War II, when he was employed in Seattle, Washington, by the Port of Embarkation. On June 21, 1933, Aubrey was united in marriage with Miss Naomi Hattie Nickel in the home of Elder Willie Hankins, near Cassville, MO. This devoted and caring wife, companion, and helpmate of nearly 55 years survives and has rendered personal home care during his last months of ill health. To this SW Missouri union, 5 children (2 sons and 3 daughters) were born and all survive. John Bradley, of Aurora, MO; Mark Bradley, of Fort Smith, AR; Beatrice Benson of Republic, MO; Linda Adams of Sarcoxie, MO; Vivian Evans, of Sherman, TX. Though Aubrey has known the sorrow of the death of one of his eight grandchildren; Matthew Adams, he has the love and admiration of the 7 surviving grandchildren; and the special blessing of having 6 Great Grandchildren to enrich his life. He was a farmer, but had also been employed as a trucker by Norris Grain and Feed, of Monett, MO and by George Ray Feed Co., of Cassville. He made many friends on those routes that have lasted a lifetime as he did when he owned his own milk route in the days of the old ten-gallon cans and wet-boxes. Mr. Bradley was preceded in death by both parents; and 2 brothers, Virgil Bradley and Willard Bradley, and sister, Emogene Turkovich. He is survived by 1 brother, Horace Bradley, of Springfield, MO and 2 sisters, Mrs. Glee Williamson and Mrs. Barbara Moore, both residents of Cassville.
