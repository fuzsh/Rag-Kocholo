        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Christina Hall put her estranged husband Josh Hall on blast amid their ongoing divorce after reposting his Instagram Story with her own commentary. Now, after Josh broke his silence on their divorce, we're learning more about the true meaning behind his message of hope.\n\nA few days ago, Josh shared a photo of a statue that reads “hope” with prayer hands and blue heart emojis on his Instagram Story. The statue is located outside of City of Hope, a National Cancer Institute in Duarte, California. At the time, it was unclear if he was aware of the location or if there was a deeper meaning behind it.\n\nJosh's recent Instagram post has shed more light on the situation. He revealed he's been visiting his longtime friend, Gonzalo Galvez, at City of Hope. \"Today the best human I’ve ever known had his ticket punched by the evil cancer,\" he wrote in the caption on a collection of photos from their time together.\n\nJosh continued to open up about how he met Galvez, what their friendship meant to him, and details about their final moments together. Before Josh gave insight into the meaning behind his message of hope, many viewed it within the context of his ongoing divorce. That included Christina, who reposted the photo to her Instagram Story. At the time, she imagined what Josh is hoping for in the divorce. “‘I ‘HOPE’ she pays me millions more than what she’s already offered me,’” she wrote, adding emojis of cash and prayer hands.\n\nWhen Christina broke her silence on their divorce, she took to Instagram to share serious words for Josh. \"I have worked my ass off to build this life for myself and my children and anyone who would try and take what they do not deserve/what they did NOT work for should be ashamed,\" she wrote. \"An insecure man with a large ego can sure try and derail you—but 'still i rise.'\"\n\nSince their divorce filings, there's been plenty of financial drama. Apart from Josh seeking alimony and asking the court to eliminate Christina's ability to collect from him, Christina has claimed that Josh transferred $35,000 of her money from rental property income into his personal bank account. She's also claimed he's taken items from their Newport Beach, California, house, which they purchased together for $12 million in April 2022. Recently, Josh was spotted moving out of that home.\n\nFollow House Beautiful on Instagram and TikTok.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
