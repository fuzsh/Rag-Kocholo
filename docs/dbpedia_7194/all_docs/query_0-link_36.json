Clawson (screenwriter)\n\nLon Chaney, Lionel Barrymore, Mary Nolan, Warner Baxter (starring)\n\nBeverly Hills, CA: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer [MGM], 1928. Vintage oversize reference photograph from the 1928 silent film, showing actor Lon Chaney swallowing a sword. Manuscript ink annotations regarding layout on the verso, along with a provenance stamp.\n\nFrom the archive of film historian and author Joel Finler.\n\nHaving been abandoned by his wife and paralyzed by her lover, a bitter magician vows to exact revenge upon the philanderer and the girl that he believes is his rival's daughter. He attempts to do so by carrying out the African tradition of burning a man's daughter at the stake after a man has died, though only after killing his rival does he realize the daughter is his own. One of Tod Browning and Lon Chaney's best joint efforts, a tragically grim film depicting a lurid Africa.\n\nSet in Zanzibar.\n\n8.5 x 10.75 inches. Very Good plus, lightly edgeworn.\n\n[Book #158521]"
