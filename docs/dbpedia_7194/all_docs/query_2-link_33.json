        "text": "Mark Richard Baxter of Port Republic, Maryland passed away on Saturday, August 20th at 3 AM. He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Mary Baxter, children, Matthew Baxter, Meaghan Baxter, Meredith Baxter, and Andrew Baxter. He is also survived by his brothers Gene Baxter (Vicki Baxter), Warner Baxter (Gwen Baxter), and Darryl Baxter (Michelle Baxter), his sister Teresa Carey, his aunt Geraldine Hockman, as well as his brother-in-law Bill Sturgess (Debbie Sturgess), sister-in-law Cynthia Hoffman (Roger Hoffman), sister-in-law Sharon Harris (Charles Harris), sister-in-law Jeannie Sturgess, and mother-in-law Nannette Sturgess. Mark is preceded in death by his father, Eugene Francis Baxter, mother, Naomi Elizabeth Baxter, sister, Sharon Anne Fisher, nephew, Paul Francis Baxter, and father-in-law, William Albert Sturgess. Mark is lovingly remembered by his nieces, nephews, cousins, other family, friends, bandmates, and fans of The Baxter Brothers and Country One.\n\nMark served in the United States Army as a sergeant from 1975 to 1978. Mark and his brother Gene had a band, The Baxter Brothers and Country One that performed country and rock music in the 70’s and 80’s in Maryland, as well as traveling to places like Texas and Nashville to perform. When he wasn’t playing the guitar and singing, he was working on cars or, in his words, “swingin’ hammers”. He owned many cars, but his favorite was his 1969 Plymouth Roadrunner which he took to many car shows.\n\nOn December 8th, 1991 Mark married the love of his life Mary in Hyattsville, Maryland, and they would have celebrated their 31st wedding anniversary this December. They spent many weekends in Ocean City in their 30 years of marriage, a place they loved to go to spend time together. He also loved to cook. His areas of expertise were fried chicken, burgers, and green beans which he washed down with a nice, cold beer (or as he called it, Adult Kool-Aid). Above all else, he was an excellent, kind, and supportive husband, father, son, brother, cousin, and friend.\n\nThe family will receive friends at Lee Funeral Home Calvert 8200 Jennifer Lane Owings, MD 20736 on Wednesday, September 7, 2022 from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm where a Funeral Service will be held at 12:00 pm in the Funeral Home Chapel. Interment will follow at Maryland Veterans Cemetery 11301 Crain Highway Cheltenham, MD 20623."
