        "text": "American actor (1885–1949)\n\nWallace Fitzgerald Beery (April 1, 1885 – April 15, 1949) was an American film and stage actor.[1] He is best known for his portrayal of Bill in Min and Bill (1930) opposite Marie Dressler, as General Director Preysing in Grand Hotel (1932), as Long John Silver in Treasure Island (1934), as Pancho Villa in Viva Villa! (1934), and his title role in The Champ (1931), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Beery appeared in some 250 films during a 36-year career. His contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stipulated in 1932 that he would be paid $1 more than any other contract player at the studio. This made Beery the highest-paid film actor in the world during the early 1930s. He was the brother of actor Noah Beery and uncle of actor Noah Beery Jr.\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Beery was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery was born the youngest of three boys on April 1, 1885, in Clay County, Missouri, near Smithville.[3] The Beery family left the farm in the 1890s and moved to nearby Kansas City, Missouri, where his father was a police officer. A fourth brother, Charles, was born in 1880 but survived only a day after his birth.[4] There might have been an older sister but information is faint.\n\nBeery attended the Chase School in Kansas City and took piano lessons as well, but showed little love for academic matters. He ran away from home twice, the first time returning after a short time, quitting school and working in the Kansas City train yards as an engine wiper.[3] Beery ran away from home a second time at age 16 and joined the Ringling Brothers Circus as an assistant elephant trainer. He left two years later after being clawed by a leopard.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly career\n\n[edit]\n\nWallace Beery joined his older brother Noah in New York City in 1904, finding work in comic opera as a baritone, and appeared on Broadway and in summer stock theatre. He was in The Belle of the West in 1905. His most notable early role came in 1907 when he starred in The Yankee Tourist to good reviews.[5]\n\nComedy film star – Essanay Studios\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1913, he moved to Chicago to work for Essanay Studios. His first movie was likely a comedy short, His Athletic Wife (1913).\n\nBeery was then cast as Sweedie, a Swedish maid character he played in drag in a series of short comedy films from 1914 to 1916. Sweedie Learns to Swim (1914) co-starred Ben Turpin. Sweedie Goes to College (1915) starred Gloria Swanson, whom Beery married the following year.[6]\n\nOther Beery films (mostly shorts) from this period included In and Out (1914), The Ups and Downs (1914), Cheering a Husband (1914), Madame Double X (1914), Ain't It the Truth (1915), Two Hearts That Beat as Ten (1915), and The Fable of the Roistering Blades (1915).\n\nThe Slim Princess (1915), with Francis X. Bushman, was one of his earliest feature-length films. Beery also did The Broken Pledge (1915) and A Dash of Courage (1916), both with Swanson.\n\nBeery played a German soldier in The Little American (1917) with Mary Pickford, directed by Cecil B. De Mille. He did some comedies for Mack Sennett, Maggie's First False Step (1917) and Teddy at the Throttle (1917), but he gradually left that genre and specialized in portrayals of villains prior to becoming a major leading man during the sound era.\n\nVillainous roles\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1917, Beery portrayed Pancho Villa in Patria at a time when Villa was still active in Mexico. (Beery reprised the role 17 years later in Viva Villa!.)\n\nBeery was a villainous German in The Unpardonable Sin (1919) with Blanche Sweet. For Paramount, he did The Love Burglar (1919) with Wallace Reid; Victory (1919), with Jack Holt; Behind the Door (1919), as another villainous German; and The Life Line (1919) with Holt.\n\nBeery was the villain in five major releases in 1920: 813; The Virgin of Stamboul for director Tod Browning; The Mollycoddle with Douglas Fairbanks, in which Fairbanks and Beery fist fought as they tumbled down a steep mountain; and in the noncomedic Western The Round-Up starring Roscoe Arbuckle as an obese cowboy in a well-received serious film with the tagline \"Nobody loves a fat man.\" Beery continued his villainy cycle that year with The Last of the Mohicans, playing Magua.\n\nBeery had a supporting part in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1920) with Rudolph Valentino. He was a villainous Tong leader in A Tale of Two Worlds (1921) and was the bad guy again in Sleeping Acres (1922), Wild Honey (1922), and I Am the Law (1922), which also featured his brother Noah Beery Sr.\n\nHistorical films\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery had a large then-rare heroic part as King Richard I (Richard the Lion-Hearted) in Robin Hood (1922), starring Douglas Fairbanks as Robin Hood. The lavish movie was a huge success and spawned a sequel the following year starring Beery in the title role of Richard the Lion-Hearted.\n\nBeery had an important unbilled cameo as \"the Ape-Man\" in A Blind Bargain (1922) starring Lon Chaney (Beery is seen crouching, in full ape-man make-up, in the background of some of the movie's posters), and a supporting role in The Flame of Life (1923). He played another historical ruler, King Philip IV of Spain, in The Spanish Dancer (1923) with Pola Negri.\n\nBeery starred in an action melodrama, Stormswept (1923) for FBO Films alongside Noah Beery Sr. The tagline on the movie's posters was \"Wallace and Noah Beery – The Two Greatest Character Actors on the American Screen.\"\n\nBeery played his third royal, the Duc de Tours, in Ashes of Vengeance (1923) with Norma Talmadge, then did Drifting (1923) with Priscilla Dean for director Browning.\n\nBeery had the title role in Bavu (1923), about Bolsheviks and the Russian Revolution. He co-starred with Buster Keaton in the comedy Three Ages (1923), the first feature Keaton wrote, produced, directed, and starred in.\n\nBeery was a villain in The Eternal Struggle (1923), a Mountie drama, produced by Louis B. Mayer, who eventually became crucial to Beery's career. He was reunited with Dean and Browning in White Tiger (1923), then played the title role in the aforementioned Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923), a sequel to Robin Hood based on Sir Walter Scott's The Talisman; a print of Richard the Lion-Hearted is held at the Archives du Film du CNC in Bois d'Arcy.[7]\n\nBeery was in The Drums of Jeopardy (1923) and had a supporting role in The Sea Hawk (1924) for director Frank Lloyd. He also appeared in a supporting role for Clarence Brown's The Signal Tower (1925) starring Virginia Valli and Rockliffe Fellowes.\n\nParamount\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He had a support role in Adventure (1925) directed by Victor Fleming.\n\nAt First National, he was given the star role of Professor Challenger in Arthur Conan Doyle's dinosaur epic The Lost World (1925), arguably his silent performance most frequently screened in the modern era. Beery was top billed in Paramount's The Devil's Cargo (1925) for Victor Fleming, and supported in The Night Club (1925), The Pony Express (1925) for James Cruze, and The Wanderer (1925) for Raoul Walsh.\n\nBeery starred in a comedy with Raymond Hatton, Behind the Front (1926), and he was a villain in Volcano! (1926). He was a bos'n in Old Ironsides (1926) for director James Cruze, with Charles Farrell in the romantic lead.\n\nBeery had the title role in the baseball movie Casey at the Bat (1927). He was reunited with Hatton in Fireman, Save My Child (1927) and Now We're in the Air (1927). The latter also featured Louise Brooks, who was Beery's costar in Beggars of Life (1928), directed by William Wellman, which was Paramount's first part-talkie movie.\n\nHe made a fourth comedy with Hatton, Wife Savers (1929), then Beery starred in Chinatown Nights (1929) for Wellman, produced by a young David O. Selznick. This film was shot silent with the voices dubbed in by the actors afterward, which worked spectacularly well with Beery's resonant voice, although the technique was not used again during the silent era for another full-length feature. Beery then played in Stairs of Sand (1929), a Western also starring Jean Arthur, before being fired by Paramount.\n\nMGM\n\n[edit]\n\nIrving Thalberg signed Beery to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) as a character actor. The association began well when Beery played the savage convict Butch, a role originally intended for Lon Chaney (who died that same year), in the highly successful 1930 prison film The Big House, directed by George W. Hill; Beery was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nBeery's second film for MGM was also a huge success: Billy the Kid (1930), an early widescreen picture in which he played Pat Garrett. He supported John Gilbert in Way for a Sailor (1930) and Grace Moore in A Lady's Morals (1930), portraying P. T. Barnum in the latter.\n\nStardom\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery was well established as a leading man and top-rank character actor. The picture that really made him one of the cinema's foremost stars was Min and Bill (1930) opposite Marie Dressler and directed by George W. Hill, a sensational success.[8]\n\nBeery made a third film with Hill, The Secret Six (1931), a gangster movie with Jean Harlow and Clark Gable in key supporting roles. The picture was popular, but was surpassed at the box office by The Champ, which Beery made with Jackie Cooper for director King Vidor. The film, especially written for Beery, was another box-office sensation. Beery shared the Best Actor Oscar with Fredric March. Though March received one vote more than Beery, Academy rules at the time—since rescinded—defined results within one vote of each other as \"ties.\"[9] (An alternate account has MGM head Louis B. Mayer storming backstage at the Oscars and demanding that March and Beery share that year's Academy Award for Best Actor since the vote was so close.)\n\nBeery's career went from strength to strength. Hell Divers (1932), a naval airplane epic also starring a young Clark Gable billed under Beery, was a big hit. So, too, was the all-star Grand Hotel (1932), in which Beery was billed fourth, under Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, and Joan Crawford, one of the very few times he would not be top billed for the rest of his career. In 1932, his contract with MGM stipulated that he be paid a dollar more than any other contract player at the studio, making him the world's highest-paid actor.\n\nBeery was a German wrestler in Flesh (1932), a hit directed by John Ford, but Ford removed his directorial credit before the film opened, so the picture screened with no director listed despite being labeled \"A John Ford Production\" in the opening title card. Next Beery was in another all-star ensemble blockbuster, Dinner at Eight (1933), with Jean Harlow holding her own as Beery's comically bickering wife. This time, Beery was billed third, under Marie Dressler and John Barrymore.\n\nBeery was lent to the new 20th Century Pictures for the boisterously fast-paced comedy/drama The Bowery (1933), also starring George Raft, Jackie Cooper, and Fay Wray, and featuring Pert Kelton, under the direction of Raoul Walsh. The picture was a smash hit.\n\nBack at MGM, he played the title role of Pancho Villa in Viva Villa! (1933) and was reunited with Dressler in Tugboat Annie (1933), a massive hit. He was Long John Silver in Treasure Island (1934), described as a box-office \"disappointment\"[10] despite being MGM's third-largest hit of the season, and remains currently viewed as featuring one of Beery's iconic performances.\n\nBeery returned to 20th Century Productions for The Mighty Barnum (1934), in which he played P. T. Barnum again. Back at MGM, he was a kindly sergeant in West Point of the Air (1935) and was in an all-star spectacular, China Seas (1935), this time billed beneath Clark Gable.\n\nO'Shaughnessy's Boy (1935) reunited Beery and Jackie Cooper. He had the lead as the drunken uncle in MGM's adaptation of Ah, Wilderness! (1936) and went back to 20th Century – now 20th Century Fox – for A Message to Garcia (1936) with Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nAt MGM, he was in Old Hutch (1936) and The Good Old Soak (1937), then he was back at Fox for Slave Ship (1937), taking second billing under Warner Baxter, a rarity for Beery after Min and Bill catapulted his career into the stratosphere in 1931, during which he received top billing in all but six films (Min and Bill, Grand Hotel, Tugboat Annie, Dinner at Eight, China Seas with Gable and Harlow, and Slave Ship).\n\nDecline\n\n[edit]\n\nThe status of Beery's films went into a decline.[why?] After an abrupt European vacation,[11][12] Beery was in The Bad Man of Brimstone (1938) with Dennis O'Keefe (and Noah Beery Sr. in a cameo role as a bartender), Port of Seven Seas (1938) with Maureen O'Sullivan, Stablemates (1938) with Mickey Rooney, Stand Up and Fight (1939) with Robert Taylor, Sergeant Madden (1939) with Tom Brown, Thunder Afloat (1939) with Chester Morris, The Man from Dakota (1940) with Dolores del Río, and 20 Mule Team (1940) with Marjorie Rambeau, Anne Baxter, and Noah Beery Jr., enjoying top billing in all of them.\n\nWyoming (1940) teamed Beery with Marjorie Main. After The Bad Man (1941), which also stars Lionel Barrymore and future President of the United States Ronald Reagan, and was the remake of a Walter Huston picture, MGM reunited Beery and Main in Barnacle Bill (1941), The Bugle Sounds (1941), and Jackass Mail (1942).\n\nBeery did a war film, a Technicolor comedy titled Salute to the Marines (1943), then was back with Main in Rationing (1944). Barbary Coast Gent (1944), an extremely broad Western comedy in which Beery played a bombastic con man, teamed him with Binnie Barnes. He did another war film, This Man's Navy (1945), then made another Western with Main, Bad Bascomb (1946), a huge hit, helped primarily by Margaret O'Brien's casting.\n\nThe Mighty McGurk (1947) put Beery with another child star of the studio, Dean Stockwell. Alias a Gentleman (1947) was the first of Beery's films to lose money during the sound era. Beery received top billing for the hit A Date with Judy (1949), a popular musical featuring Elizabeth Taylor. Beery's last film, again featuring Main, Big Jack (1949), also lost money according to Mannix's reckoning.[13] Beery died of a heart attack three days after the picture's release.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst marriage\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 27, 1916, at the age of 30, Beery married 17-year-old actress Gloria Swanson in Los Angeles.[14] The two had co-starred in Sweedie Goes to College.[6] Although Beery had enjoyed popularity with his Sweedie shorts, his career had taken a dip, and during the marriage to Swanson, he relied on her as a breadwinner. According to Swanson's autobiography, Beery raped her on their wedding night, and later tricked her into swallowing an abortifacient when she was pregnant, which caused her to lose their child.[15] Swanson filed for divorce in 1917 and it was finalized in 1918.[14]\n\nSecond marriage and adoption\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 4, 1924, Beery married actress Rita Gilman (née Mary Areta Gilman; 1898–1986) in Los Angeles.[16] The couple adopted Carol Ann Priester (1930–2013), daughter of Rita Beery's mother's half-sister, Juanita Priester (née Caplinger; 1899–1931) and her husband, Erwin William Priester (1897–1969). After 14 years of marriage, Rita filed for divorce on May 1, 1939, in Carson City, Ormsby County, Nevada. Within 20 minutes of filing, she won the decree. Rita remarried 15 days later, on May 16, 1939, to Jessen Albert D. Foyt (1907–1945), filing her marriage license with the same county clerk in Carson City.\n\nAlleged fatal altercation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 1937, comedic actor and Three Stooges founder Ted Healy was involved in a drunken altercation at Cafe Trocadero on the Sunset Strip. E. J. Fleming, in his 2005 book, The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling and the MGM Publicity Machine, asserts that Healy was attacked by three men: future James Bond producer Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli, local mob figure Pat DiCicco (who was Broccoli's cousin as well as the former husband of Thelma Todd and the future husband of Gloria Vanderbilt), and Wallace Beery. Fleming writes that this beating led to Healy's death a few days later.[11][12]\n\nThere is no documentation in contemporaneous news reports that either Beery or DiCicco was present.[17] Broccoli admitted that he was indeed involved in a fistfight with Healy at the Trocadero.[18] The official autopsy names Healy's cause of death as acute toxic nephritis secondary to acute and chronic alcoholism.[19]\n\nSecond adoption\n\n[edit]\n\nAround December 1939, Beery, recently divorced, adopted a seven-month-old girl, Phyllis Ann Beery.[20] Phyllis appeared in MGM publicity photos when adopted, but was never mentioned again.[21] Beery told the press he had taken the girl in from a single mother, recently divorced, but he had filed no official adoption papers.[22]\n\nWorking relationship with peers\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery was considered misanthropic and difficult to work with by many of his colleagues. Robert Young described Beery as a \"shitty person\". On set, he often never bothered to learn his lines and instead chose to take from other actors' characters and then resent it when his theft was pointed out. When prompting for another actor's close-up, Beery would read the wrong lines, making it harder for his co-stars to meet their marks. Beery was \"loathed by everybody, and happily oblivious.\"[23]\n\nMickey Rooney was one of Beery's few co-stars to consistently speak highly of him in subsequent decades. In his memoir, Rooney described Beery as \"... a lovable, shambling kind of guy who never seemed to know that his shirttail belonged inside his pants, but always knew when a little kid actor needed a smile and a wink or a word of encouragement.\" He did concede that \"not everyone loved [Beery] as much as I did.\" Rooney noted that Howard Strickling, MGM's head of publicity, once went to Louis B. Mayer to complain that Beery was stealing props from the studio's sets. \"And that wasn't all\", Rooney continued. \"He went on for some minutes about the trouble that Beery was always causing him ... Mayer sighed and said, 'Yes, Howard, Beery's a son of a bitch. But he's our son of a bitch.' Strickling got the point. A family has to be tolerant of its black sheep, particularly if they brought a lot of money into the family fold, which Beery certainly did.\"[24]\n\nChild actors, in particular, recalled unpleasant encounters with Beery. Jackie Cooper, who made several films with him early in his career, called him \"a big disappointment.\" Cooper accused Beery of upstaging and other attempts to undermine his performances out of what Cooper presumed was jealousy. He recalled impulsively throwing his arms around Beery after one especially heartfelt scene, only to be gruffly pushed away.[25] Child actress Margaret O'Brien claimed that she had to be protected by crew members from Beery's insistence on constantly pinching her.[26]\n\nOn another occasion, after having invited 12-year-old actor Darryl Hickman to lunch, Beery responded to Darryl's thanks with, \"okay, kid, you owe me 75 cents.\" Beery also refused to leave tips at the MGM commissary because he explained tips are for special service, and since he was a movie star, he already got special service and therefore leaving a tip would be a waste of money.[citation needed]\n\nBeery only met his match with co-star Marie Dressler. Having come up the hard and long way to her stardom, Dressler refused to take \"nonsense from this baboon.\" She responded to one of Beery's insults by saying she would serve his head on a platter to MGM chief Louis B. Mayer. Although everyone expected Beery to explode, instead, he cowered and acted like \"a little boy being very careful that Mommy didn't catch him with his hand in the cookie jar.\"[citation needed]\n\nFuture author Ray Bradbury recalled meeting Beery as a young boy on a Hollywood street, and that his autograph request resulted in Beery cursing and spitting on him.[citation needed]\n\nHobbies\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery owned and flew his own planes,[27] including a Howard DGA-11. On April 15, 1933, he was commissioned a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy Reserve at NRAB Long Beach.[28] One of his proudest achievements was catching the largest giant black sea bass in the world — 515 pounds (234 kg) — off Santa Catalina Island in 1916, a record that stood for 35 years.[29]\n\nActivism against National Park Lands\n\n[edit]\n\nA noteworthy episode in Beery's life is chronicled in the fifth episode of Ken Burns' documentary The National Parks: America's Best Idea: In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order creating Jackson Hole National Monument to protect the land adjoining the Grand Tetons in Wyoming. Local ranchers, outraged at the loss of grazing lands, compared FDR's action to Hitler's taking of Austria. Led by an aging Beery, they protested by herding 500 cattle across the monument lands without a permit.[30]\n\nPaternity suit\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 13, 1948, Gloria Schumm (or Gloria Smith Beery, née Florence W. Smith; 1916–1989) filed a paternity suit against Beery. Beery, through his lawyer, Norman Ronald Tyre (1910–2002), initially offered $6,000 as a settlement, but denied being the father. She had given birth on February 7, 1948, to Johan Richard Wallace Schumm. In 1944, Schumm divorced Stuttgart-born Hollywood actor Hans Schumm (né Johann Josef Eugen Schumm; 1896–1990), but remarried him August 21, 1947, after realizing that she was pregnant. Prior to remarrying Schumm, she met with Beery at his home, where he gave her the name and address of a physician to submit an examination.[31] At or around that time, she also asked Beery to marry her to \"legitimatize the expected child\" (her words), which Beery refused.\n\nAccording to newspapers, Gloria claimed to have been intimate with Wallace Beery on or about May 1, 1947, at his home in Beverly Hills (in the court proceedings, however, she claimed it had occurred on May 17). Beery conceded that he had known Gloria for about 15 years, and that under the pseudonym \"Gloria Whitney\", she had played bit roles in six films in which he starred. She again separated from Hans Schumm on April 15, 1948.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.[32]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nBeery died of a heart attack on April 15, 1949, collapsing while reading a newspaper at his Beverly Hills home.[33] His body was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. The inscription on his grave reads, \"No man is indispensable, but some are irreplaceable.\"\n\nBeery died intestate. In the paternity suit, Gloria Schumm's attorneys demanded $104,135 against Beery's $2,220,000 estate. In February 1952, Judge Newcomb Condee approved a $26,750 settlement from the estate. Gloria Schumm accepted the settlement, and Beery's paternity of Johan Schumm was not acknowledged.\n\nWhen Mickey Rooney's father died less than a year later, Rooney arranged to have him buried next to his old friend. \"I thought it was fitting that these two comedians should rest in peace, side by side,\" he wrote.[34]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Wallace Beery posthumously received a motion-picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, located at 7001 Hollywood Boulevard.[2]\n\nBeery is mentioned in the film Barton Fink, in which the lead character has been hired to write a wrestling screenplay to star Beery.[35] Another Coen brothers film, Hail, Caesar!, features a mockingly named \"Wallace Beery Conference Room\" scene within a Hollywood studio.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office ranking\n\n[edit]\n\n1932 – 7th\n\n1933 – 5th\n\n1934 – 4th\n\n1935 – 8th\n\n1936 – 15th, 8th (UK)\n\n1937 – 15th\n\n1938 – 12th\n\n1939 – 15th\n\n1940 – 8th\n\n1941 – 19th\n\n1942 – 18th\n\n1943 – 18th\n\n1944 – 11th\n\n1946 – 11th\n\nThe Mollycoddle (1920) with Douglas Fairbanks\n\nThe Mollycoddle (1920) with Douglas Fairbanks\n\nWallace Beery in 1921\n\nThe Policeman and the Baby (1921)\n\nThe Golden Snare (1921) with Lewis Stone\n\nThe Last Trail (1921)\n\nThe Last Trail (1921) with Eva Novak\n\nStormswept (1923) with Noah Beery\n\nStormswept (1923) with Noah Beery\n\nStormswept (1923) with Noah Beery Sr.\n\nBavu (1923)\n\nBeery as Bavu (1923)\n\nDynamite Smith (1924) with Bessie Love\n\nDynamite Smith (1924)\n\nAdventure (1925) with Pauline Starke\n\nNow We're in the Air (1927) with Louise Brooks\n\nNow We're in the Air (1927) with Raymond Hatton\n\nNow We're in the Air (1927) with Raymond Hatton\n\nHell Divers (1931) with Clark Gable\n\nHell Divers (1931)\n\nHell Divers (1931)\n\nLionel Barrymore presents 1931 Oscar\n\nGrand Hotel (1932)\n\nGrand Hotel (1932) with Joan Crawford\n\nTugboat Annie (1933) with Marie Dressler\n\nThe Bowery (1933) with George Raft\n\nViva Villa!
