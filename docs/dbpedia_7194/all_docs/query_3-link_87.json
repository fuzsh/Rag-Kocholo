        "text": "George Baxter (1804â€“1867) was an English artist and printer based in London. He was taught by Samuel Williams.He is credited with the invention of commercially viable colour printing. The Baxter process, which he patented in 1835, involved an initial metal keyplate and up to 20 wood or metal blocks to apply each individual colour, and all of this was done on hand presses. 11 Northampton Square in Clerkenwell, London, was Baxter's home and workshop from 1844-1860. The site is marked by a plaque on the modern building at that address. Baxter was declared bankrupt in 1865 and died in 1867, after an accident involving a horse omnibus.\n\nArtist and craftsman. Born Lewes. 1825 moved to London and married his cousin Mary Harrild. He invented a commercially viable colour printing process, producing prints of religious and topical subjects. His work was popular and successful but he was a perfectionist and did not handle well the competition presented by photography. As his business failed he fell out with family and friends. In 1865 he was declared bankrupt and retired to his wife's home, The Retreat in Sydenham, where he died, following a collision with a horse-drawn omnibus. https://www.londonremembers.com/subjects/george-baxter\n\nBaxter Field named after George Baxter 1804 - 1867. An engraver and printmaker who lived for many years in The Retreat, Peak Hill. He married Mary Harrild, daughter of Robert Harrild, the printer of Round Hill Cottage in 1827. Baxter developed a method of printing in oil colour, patented in 1835, which was more economical than earlier methods used. He was killed by a horse drawn vehicle in 1867 and buried at Christchurch, Forest Hill. https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/george-baxter-se26\n\nReferences:"
