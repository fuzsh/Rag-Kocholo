He took part in \"Crime Doctor\" (43), \"Crime Doctor's Stranges Case\" (43), \"Crime Doctor's Warning\" (45) and \"The Crime Doctor's Diary\" (49).\n\nBeside it he played in few other movies, so in \"Lady in the Dark\" (44), \"The Gentleman from Nowhere\" (48) and \"The Devil's Henchmen\" (49).\n\nHe gave his farewell performance on the screen with the movie \"State Penitentiary\" (50), one year later he died of pneumonia."
