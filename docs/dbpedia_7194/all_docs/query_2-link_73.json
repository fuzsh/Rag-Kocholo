        "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Why have only one story when you can have three?!\n\nSynopsis\n\nAn anthology film, Kinds of Kindness tells three different stories, the only threads connecting them being the actors and the initials/acronym “R.M.F.”\n\nThe first story, The Death of R.M.F., tells the tale of Robert (Jesse Plemons), a man whose life is controlled by his manipulative boss Raymond (Willem Dafoe), who asks him to perform an unforgivable deed.\n\nThe second, R.M.F. is Flying, involves Daniel (Jesse Plemons), a police officer suspicious of his wife Liz (Emma Stone) who returns home after being presumed dead.\n\nIn the third, R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich, cult members Andrew (Jesse Plemons) and Emily (Emma Stone) search for a woman who can apparently raise the dead, which could lead to the ascension of their leader.\n\nHow does all of this tie together? Well, uh…\n\nMy thoughts\n\nHot off Bella Baxter’s Oscar-winning heels with Poor Things, Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone are back to deliver us another bizarre picture. However, while Poor Things was bizarre, it was fun and quirky. The themes it explored were indeed dark and serious, but the whole thing had a tinge of Roald Dahl to it that gave it an oddly charming vibe.\n\nPoor Things was off-putting to many people, which I can understand, but it’s amusingly probably Lanthimos’ most accessible film. Throughout all of the weird animal hybrids and fisheye lenses, there is an endearing, sweet undercurrent that’s flowing beneath it all, telling a hopeful and empowering story.\n\nKinds of Kindness is far more in line with Lanthimos’ other, less Oscar-winning, work. It’s dark, hopeless, cynical, absurd, and deeply uncomfortable. Not the whimsical kind of uncomfortable like we saw in Poor Things, either. More like the “nightmare” kind.\n\nLife is but a dream\n\nYou know when you’re having one of those restless nights where you’re drifting in and out of sleep, but your brain keeps chugging along with the dream-making, with each dream becoming more surreal and twisted than the one before, but there’s a vague sense of connection among it all? That’s what Kinds of Kindness feels like.\n\nEach story here is more absurd, ridiculous, and deranged than the last, with characters being thrust into chaotically desperate situations that make them question their own sanity. Each protagonist realizes the distressing dilemmas they find themselves in and tries their hardest to claw their way to get the upper hand.\n\nBut like in a dream you’re having, you can run and run as fast as you can, but your legs will refuse to get the lead out. Our protagonists keep trying, but the failures mount as the rug gets pulled up from under them again and again. Just like when you’re desperately trying to wake up from a nightmare, it all gets worse and worse.\n\nIt’s not just the content itself that’s surreal, but the way the characters react to what’s going on defies all reality. Nobody here talks like they’re an actual human being. The lines they say may seem normal on paper, but every actor seems to be doing their best impression of an alien reading a script for the first time.\n\nAll of that is part of the charm of Kinds of Kindness because even if the subject matter the stories explore is incredibly disturbing, it’s an absolute laugh riot from beginning to end. These people are pulling some downright heinous stuff on each other, but it’s some of it is so absurdly over the top that it’s hard not to keep the laughs at bay.\n\nThe casual, matter-of-fact nature the characters treat the most bizarre circumstances was hilarious. Having a genuine smashed John McEnroe tennis racket in an antique collection is simply normal and to be expected, just like murdering a man for your boss/lover is treated as business as usual.\n\nConnect three\n\nThe stories flow together stylistically, but the narrative thread connecting it all seemed a bit more vague. R.M.F. appears in some capacity in each story, but that’s really the only connective tissue. This implies these three stories all take place in the same world, even if we have the same actors playing multiple parts.\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered, each tale in Kinds of Kindness tells the story of somebody whose world is suddenly turned upside down, thrust into events that defy rational explanations. These events force them to confront their inner conflicts and break down the fabric of their lives and own being to achieve their goals.\n\nEach protagonist is forced to become introspective against their own will, giving them the motivation to see it all through. At that point now, they’re completely changed and their situation may be resolved, but not exactly for the better. They’re caught in a perpetual cycle of misery. There are certainly plenty of drowning allegories and imagery to back that up.\n\nR.M.F. Eats a Sandwich goes fully into surreal dreamscape territory, losing the uncomfortable horror aspect that the first two stories had. The dark comedy edge was still present, but the story didn’t have the same allure or deranged creativity. When the least engaging story in your anthology film of 164 minutes is the final one, the lengthy runtime is definitely felt and the audience is ready to finally wake up.\n\nThe power of the Plemons\n\nWhile Lanthimos is one of those quality directors who can get amazing performances from every actor he works with, each one of his films has one central star that’s essential to making the movie work. The Lobster had Colin Farrell, The Killing of a Sacred Deer had Barry Keoghan, The Favourite had Olivia Colman, and Poor Things had Emma Stone. With Kinds of Kindness, we have Jesse Plemons stealing the show.\n\nUnlike the stars of those aforementioned movies, Plemons had the task of playing three very different characters with their own personalities. I guess it’s a tradeoff not having to craft one character for an entire 2-hour film, but playing three different roles and making them all feel distinct is no small feat.\n\nPlemons is one of the best actors working in the business today, so it’s no surprise he was able to nail each role, but Kinds of Kindness is a perfect display of why this guy is just so good. He can be both terrifying and creepy in a very awkward, unnatural way, but also so authentically pitiful.\n\nHe does end up taking a backseat in R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich, part of why I found that story less engaging, but his central performances in The Death of R.M.F. and R.M.F. is Flying contain some of his best work to date. His characters feel so real and so strange at the same time.\n\nA sea of faces\n\nEmma Stone, Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, and Mamoudou Athie round out the rest of the cast, each playing a different character in each story with varying amounts of screen time. Like the people you encounter in a dream, familiar faces will pop up, but in different circumstances and sometimes as different people altogether.\n\nEven if they may not be in it much at times, Lanthimos and his co-writer Enthimis Filippou make the best of each actor. Since most of the characters are offbeat in some way, they already have a lot of screen presence with their personalities. The actors can be there for just one scene in a particular story, yet they make an impact that makes them feel that much more alive.\n\nWillem Dafoe is probably the first actor anybody thinks of when they hear the word “eccentric”, and you get plenty of kooky Dafoe character acting here. That is except for the second story, where he plays probably the most normal character I’ve ever seen Dafoe portray. You want absurd? Well, Dafoe playing a normal father wearing a plaid shirt tucked into jeans is about as absurd as you can get.\n\nBesides Plemons, Stone gets the most to work with here, especially when she takes the leading reigns in R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich. None of the performances here are quite as transformative as Bella Baxter, but Stone is able to access a dark, borderline animalistic side to her characters here. Her distinctive eyes and facial expressions greatly added to each character’s unsettling qualities, especially in R.M.F. is Flying.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nKinds of Kindness certainly isn’t for everybody. The collection of subject matter is disturbingly twisted, the characters are despicable and inhuman, the direction is slow and uncomfortable, and the humor is incredibly dry and bleak.\n\nAs far as anthology films go, this one is pretty loosey-goosey. The way all of the stories connect together is a bit dubious, but if you’re looking for a collection of twisted tales with a darkly humorous, unsettling vibe and stellar performances, you should look no further. You want Yorgos Lanthimos’ “goodness”? Well, you get plenty of that here.\n\nMy rating: 7.5/10\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story? Please click here to report it."
