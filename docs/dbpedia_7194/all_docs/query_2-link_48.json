        "text": "HOMES OF WESTERN MOVIE FILM MAKERS\n\nIN FRONT AND BEHIND THE CAMERAS\n\nBY BOB SILER\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE TOUR\n\nSummer is just around the corner and families across the country are going to pack up their brood and hit the road for a few weeks of rest and relaxation. The only problem is, by the time you get back home you’ll be busted flatter than boxer’s nose. Tourest traps such as Disneyland are so expensive that the average family will have to save all year to pay just to get in the gate. Then there’s the high priced food, gifts, hotels, etc. and at the end of the day all your hard earned cash is gone. So, you pack the brood back up and crawl back home, where you’ll be working long past retirement just to pay off this vacation.\n\nAll that money you saved up is what keeps that damned mouse rich and sassy. While your dining on a cheap TV dinner, the mouse is dining on the finest cheeses from around the world. So, to hell with him, keep your cash, stick in the gas tank, drive to Hollywood, and visit some of the places where your favorite western heroes once called home.\n\nBob\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nART ACORD\n\n6808 WHITLEY TERRACE 1920 – LOS ANGELES\n\n5236 ENCINO AVENUE – ENCINO 1927\n\n652 NORTH VERMONT AVENUE – LOS ANGELES – 1930\n\nFOREST LAWN, GLENDALE\n\nREX ALLEN SR.\n\n400 NORTH CAMDEN DRIVE – BEVERLY HILLS\n\nTHE DIAMOND X RANCH – CALABASAS\n\nBRONCO BILLY ANDERSON (MAX H.
