        "text": "Bethel Cemetery\n\nIndependence Township\n\n9088 Drum St, Baxter, Iowa\n\nMap and Driving Directions\n\nHistory\n\n\"Bethel Cemetery is located about two and one-half miles west of Baxter in section 20 in Independence Township, Jasper County, Iowa.\n\n\"In August of 1855 Peter Dawson was buried probably on what was then the Dawson farm. In 1857 Rosella and Elizabeth Dawson were also buried near the first grave. That same year Jeremiah Linder was buried not far from the other graves, and it became apparent that an established cemetery was needed.\n\n\"From the Jasper County Recorder's office, Newton, Iowa:\n\nDate: 7 November 1859 Date filed: 7 October 1876\n\nGrantor: R. (Robert) B. (Boise) Dawson and wife Sophiah (Sophia) Jane (Reynolds Dawson) {she signed with her mark}. Grantee: Clear Creek Church of the Wesleyan Methodist Connxium [is British for connection]. For one dollar do convey to the Clear Creek Church of Peoria City Circuit of the Wesleyan Methodist Connexium, the Nw 1/4 of the NW 1/4 of the NE 1/4 of the NE 1/4, section 20, Township 81, Range 20, containing two and one-half acres according to the original survey.\n\nDeed corrected in Book 117, page 409:\n\nSame description as above but 1/4 more added. Also the name of the church listed as Bethel Wesleyan Methodist Church.\n\n\"Robert B. \"Squire\" Dawson and his wife Sophia Jane Reynolds Dawson, gave two and one-half acres of land for Bethel Church and Cemetery. They gave this land 'forever and ever' and stipulated the no charge ever be made for a cemetery lot. A drawn plat never existed. When a grave was to be opened the neighbors and undertaker decided where it was to be place. There was a church on the site for approximately 75 years. An existing photo of the church shows the date 1872 on the front of the building, which was torn down in 1947 and all that remains in the cemetery.\n\n\"We [Jasper County Genealogical Society] have researched records and drawn a map as accurately as possible as to the placement of the graves. The age of this cemetery makes absolute accuracy impossible. There are many unmarked graves, some visible, some not. The oldest graves are toward the north end. The grave having the oldest death date is that of Lemuel Perin in August 1853. However, since the cemetery had not been established yet at this time we feel the original burial of Lemuel Perin was probably in the Perin family or Hoy Cemetery then located on the Perin family farm. We know the grave was moved probably sometime in the early 1920's to bethel Cemetery.\"\n\nSource: Jasper County, Iowa Cemeteries: Independence Township, compiled by Jasper County Genealogical Society, page 72; published by the Iowa Genealogical Society.
