While we still have obstacles ahead, I am excited about the work we are doing to evolve our curriculum and our ability to respond to changing economic and workforce needs.\n\nThis spring and summer, we watched campus come back to life. WOU has hosted a number of large groups on campus this summer and the student athletes have been back for a while now. It is great to see more people out and about. I am looking forward to a more in-person campus experience during the upcoming academic year, compared to the last two years. But many of our students are still looking for flexible course delivery options. Institutional Research will be conducting another student survey this fall to assess students’ experiences and needs for online, hybrid and in-person courses. We will get the results of the survey out to academic programs before they need to submit their tentative schedules for 2023-2024.\n\nThe College Restructure Taskforce has been busy researching and assessing possible structures for WOU’s academic units. This fall there will be opportunities to give feedback to the Taskforce as they work towards submitting their final report with recommendations. Many thanks to the Taskforce members for their diligent work over the summer to meet the goals outlined in their charge.\n\nMany at WOU have been working hard in recent months to contact students who have stopped out, advise new students, and help students get registered for Fall 2022 courses. While our total enrollment is trending lower for Fall 2022, it appears we will have more new first-year students than last year. We also are anticipating more graduate students than last year. While the lower overall enrollment is still concerning, the increase in new students shows that we are beginning to change the enrollment trajectory. We all need to continue to do what we can to support our current students and help them make progress towards their educational goals. Everyone at WOU, regardless of their role, can make a difference in the lives of students. The work we do is often difficult but it can make a tremendous impact on the lives of our students, their families and communities. Let’s continue to give our students the personalized support for which Western Oregon University is known.\n\n—Provost Rob Winningham\n\nWhile the majority of undergraduates wanted to have some in-person courses, 73% of undergraduates nonetheless wanted to take some or all of their courses online. In comparison, about 91% of graduate students wanted to take some or all of their courses online, and 61% wanted to take only online courses.\n\nRegarding what worked well with online learning, students reported that having online courses gave them more flexibility to manage their personal and educational needs. They also felt that having required course materials accessible on Canvas, including recordings of class meetings, was a benefit to having online courses.\n\nNot surprisingly, regarding classes that didn’t work well for them, students stated that a common problem was that they felt disconnected from other students and the faculty. In classes that didn’t work well for them, students also felt that communication about course assignments was not as clear as they would have liked. While these comments were specifically in response to questions about online courses, it is good to remember that, regardless of course modality, students respond well to courses where they feel connected to the other class members and feel that they are receiving clear communication from their faculty.\n\nThis fall WOU plans to survey students again, but will expand the survey to ask about their preferences for when courses are offered. Similar to last year, the survey results will be broken down by academic division and division-specific results will be sent to each Division Chair."
