        "text": "I have no idea what is the most often behavioral model of choosing a book to read or a favourite genre in the era of electronic globalization. Whether one just goes to the GoodReads portal and checks the number of stars? Check the bestseller lists? I really don‚Äôt know, because my model is completely different. For example: I very rarely use any online rating system. Instead, I go for a hunch.\n\nBack in high school I used to visit the public library in the city of Radziej√≥w quite often. Normally I would hurry for the next bus going towards my home, but sometimes I deviated from my regular schedule and went to the library instead. There I would stare at the bookshelf for some time to pick something that ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù, either cover giving a good vibe or a short description.\n\nThat‚Äôs how I picked up ‚ÄúThe Colour of Magic‚Äù. I assumed it to be an adventure fantasy, which I liked very much at the time, but it has proven to be something completely different.\n\nIn fact, the whole saga is one of the best philosophical works and most sober looks at humanity (after all Pratchett invented the ‚Äúknurd‚Äù mental state (‚Äúdrunk‚Äù backwards) ‚Äì an opposite of being chilled out, the state of complete clarity, making some shout for hours in despair‚Ä¶) and our existence I have ever read, and Terry Pratchett, unwillingly, remains one of the greatest philosophers of XXth century in my eyes.\n\nWhere do I start‚Ä¶Well, it begins with the setup of the world that evolves with time ‚Äì and that setup is: the Discworld is a parody of our real world and other fantasy worlds (by other authors). It‚Äôs a disc, supported by 4 elephants standing on the great turtle A‚ÄôTuin. It‚Äôs flat. It‚Äôs Creator‚Äôs joke (and an extension of another concept of Pratchett from ‚ÄúThe Layers of the Universe‚Äù). It‚Äôs ridiculous to the limits of absurd and would normally fall apart if not the greatest law of the Universe that trumps the laws of physics ‚Äì narrativum. The power of storytelling. Or maybe I should say: The Power of Storytelling, having in mind what this blog is all about. You, see, Pratchett understood what it means for humans to tell stories. He perfectly understood that we, humans, program ourselves socially and psychologically by telling stories. Example? Consider yourself being born in exactly opposite side of the planet (or the nearest landmass, because my exactly opposite point is somewhere in the depths of Pacific‚Ä¶) and think about what your beliefs would be and how you gained your own beliefs. Yes. Somebody told you a story about how the world works. Someone told you not to cross the street while the red light is lit. Someone told you it‚Äôs not nice to hit other children.\n\nSo, the turtle, the flat world and the narrativum. What else? Oh, the regular fantasy setting with dragons, witches, dwarves, elves, werewolves, gnomes, trolls, humans, gods, Nobby Nobbs (fans will appreciate listing him as a separate species üòâ ) and many more‚Ä¶ But‚Äôs just a first layer, scratch the surface and it‚Äôs completely different. Because Sir Terry wanted to tell another kind of story. Not just an adventure of a warrior or a wizard on a perilous journey for the sake of sudden plot twist and heroic deeds. No.\n\nSir Terry wanted to ask: what‚Äôs the point of it all?\n\nWhat is the point of heroism for example? Why do we revere Conan the Barbarian? Or maybe: why people tend to know and revere characters like gen Patton more than Euler? Or, if you prefer, Hector instead of Socrates. You disagree? Well, watch all Marvel comic books and movies and tell me what is the percentage ratio of characters falling into Patton and Hector archetype against the other archetype‚Ä¶ Why does Icarus trump Daedalus?\n\nThe main protagonist Pratchett started with (oh, because there‚Äôs a gallery of unforgetable characters in his works..) is Rincewind, an antihero. A wizard with no power, a goofy coward, made special by a random event. Rincewind never wanted to be a hero, he just wanted a peaceful wizard‚Äôs life, but being chosen of the gods and the greatest spellbook of the Disc makes him a target for everything and everyone: demons, lovecraftian entities, political powers and Death himself. With Rincewind constantly on the run, and falling into more and more heroic situations we explore this marvelous, rich and hillarious world. The humour of Pratchett‚Äôs works can be compared only to Douglas Adams‚Äô ‚ÄúHitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy‚Äù and perhaps, ‚ÄúMonty Python‚Äù comic group. It‚Äôs abstract, it touches the core of the matter and requires a level of intelligence to understand.\n\nSome of the jokes are multifaceted and multilayered‚Ä¶ Sometimes after you understand a joke, live some more and gain life experiences, re-read the book you find there was a joke inside of a joke‚Ä¶\n\nI mentioned Death, the antopomorphic personification of the process of the Universe. Well, remember about the narrativum, it rules the universe, so there‚Äôs more anthropomorphic personifications of processes in the books, like the Tooth Fairy or a Hogsfather (Disc‚Äôs Santa Claus), but it‚Äôs Death that shines most. Terry Pratchett was able to make Death look friendly, sympathethic and needed. Discworld novels are probably the best literature to deal with the concept of death philosophically, how it affects our whole lives and if should we fear it at all. Death hilariously tries to understand humanity, sometimes be like a human, with funny results: he builds a mansion, has a servant Albert, likes cats, tries his strengths as a farmer and ‚Ä¶ has a daughter and then granddaughter, Susan, who inherits some of the skills that, er‚Ä¶, run in the family.\n\nThen there‚Äôs a matter of politics, both domestic and international. These are embodied by various archetypes like a romantic Verence, a righteous king of a small kingdom, lords and ladies of Ankh-Morpork, religious fundamentalism of Omnia, democracy of Epheb and‚Ä¶ lord Vetinari. Vetinari is another story, because he is a ‚ÄúMachiavelli‚Äôs wet dream‚Äù ‚Äì a man of the state and for the state on the one hand, and a cruel tyrant on the other, balancing between the two so the ‚Äúsystem could work like a watch‚Äù. A person everyone fears but also a person that actually solves all of the state problems brilliantly.\n\nVetinari sometimes needs help of the newly formed police ‚Äì the most progressive formation on the whole Disc. A noir style detective ‚Äì commendant Vimes and his posse of multiracial, multigender, multispecies policemen bring constant joy to the reader. The way police works in the Discworld is a very moral compas not only to all police formations, but to humans in general. Vimes, after all, is the first person in the history of the Disc, who arrested the whole army during invasion for ‚Äúdistrupting the peace‚Äù. It was made possible with assistance from captain Carrot, a descendant of the old Ankh-Morpork kings with the charisma allowing him to bring two fighting gangs to tears of shame and Nobby Nobbs ‚Äì the only human that needs a certificate of belonging to the human species. Vimes is the person that allowed peace talks between dwarves and trolls ‚Äì and to calm the tensions between them ‚Äì a long lasting hatred devoid of all reason. Finally, Vimes is the person that fiercely fought against racism by helping goblins ‚Äì he countered unjust prejudices based on ignorance and used his authority to help the poor, abused goblin-people.\n\nWho read the Discword novels without loving the witches? Probably no one: granny Weatherwax, the most powerful witch of the Disc and her sidekicks, nanny Ogg ‚Äì a femme fatale that had many men and now is a head of the mightly family, Magrat Garlick ‚Äì soon to be come a Lancre witch-queen, and Agnes/Perdita Nitt, a chubby opera singing witch with inclinations towards goth style. It requires a lot of brain power to fully understand how hilarious is what witches do to logic itself, how they bend it and break it sometimes. As mistresses of psychology they solve an average man‚Äôs problems, and, they show what is the foundation of the society and civilization ‚Äì what is the true area all problem solving should start with ‚Äì the said average man. Everything else comes to this ‚Äì feed the bellies of men, calm the fears, teach and there will be no wars‚Ä¶\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot of Discworld characters there, as there is a multitude of topics Pratchett discusses, but I need to mention some more ‚Äì Brutha the Prophet in the ‚ÄúSmaller Gods‚Äù, an excellent book about belief and religion and how they differ and, my personal favourite, Moist von Lipwig, an ex-thief turned into manager of post office at first and then into a head banker. His charisma never goes to waste for the better of Ankh-Morpork citizens. And Cohen the Barbarian laughs at Conan the Barbarian and his barbaric principles, saying that a soft toilet paper is far important than honour.\n\n‚ÄúDiscworld‚Äù novels go through every possible subject of importance. Author‚Äôs deep care for humankind, his humanism and amazement of the world and the people is heart warming. Pratchett was able to show how insignificant we are and yet, how beautiful it is to be able to talk about our insignificance at all! Of course, with existence comes an inevitable pain ‚Äì of sickness, of dying, of loss, but the author believed in the humankind, believed that some of that pain can be taken away. If only we all started to listen what he wanted to tell us, world would be a totally different place.\n\nThe Disc changes a lot in the books ‚Äì starting as a fantasy world it becomes an industrialized and computerized environment. We see the Disc version of cinematography, the rise of new age music, and remote communication. And with it we see a lot of arising problems affecting the denizens of the world ‚Äì like chauvinist opression and the rise of feminism. But our Discworld counterparts are always able to overcome it. In a good way.\n\nThen there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúScience of Discworld‚Äù trilogy, co-written with Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart ‚Äì a science book for people that would like to take a look at various scientific puzzles of the new era, intertwined with the neat plot of Rincewind and the wizards trying to save our Earth from various threats.\n\nPratchett saw what humankind is. He saw everything that is good and bad. What makes people become warmongering savage beasts? Biological conditioning and ignorance. What makes traditionalists fighting for their ideas to the death or suffering of others? Biological conditioning and ignorance. What makes progress so difficult? Again the same two things.\n\nEvolutionary legacy and ignorance‚Ä¶ If we only could take away the second part of that equation, how much better our world would be!\n\nYet, Pratchett learned to love humankind, for all its flaws. As Death states many times ‚Äì one cannot weigh compassion, there‚Äôs not a single atom of love in the universe, yet humans created these abstracts and these are worth fighting for and worth saving. Is our species special? No, we are but members of a huge family of animals of the world of organisms, but we are special in some ways. Do we have a soul? Perhaps not, because everybody intelligent there knows we are but complex machines, yet our behaviour sometimes seems to exceed our programming. We create our soul.\n\nSir Terry convinces us every single person is worthy and valuable, every single life matters. We don‚Äôt need a masterplan in the chaotic universe because in the end everything dies, even universes. We don‚Äôt need to try to preserve old ways, because the arrival of the new is imminent. What we need is to try to be decent people to each other, to receive some warmth from another everyman like ourselves in this cold, unknown, empty space we live in.\n\nWe are but trapped butterflies flying towards the candlelight, hopeless and doomed to perish, but our flight is epic, our wings beautiful and we deserve some love, Pratchett convinces us.\n\nHere‚Äôs the list of the books Sir Terry wrote before the illness, an Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, took him. It struck me hard when he passed away, because I knew who he was, I knew what he cared about. He was a close person to me, even though I did not know him personally.\n\nAnd I bet every fan of the series says the same about the author and the books."
