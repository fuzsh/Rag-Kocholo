        "text": "Knowledge equals power…\n\nThe string was important. After a while the Librarian stopped. He concentrated all his powers of librarianship.\n\nPower equals energy…\n\nPeople were stupid, sometimes. They thought the Library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books, which was true enough, but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library.\n\nEnergy equals matter…\n\nHe swung into an avenue of shelving that was apparently a few feet long and walked along it briskly for half an hour.\n\nMatter equals mass.\n\nAnd mass distorts space. It distorts it into polyfractal L-space.\n\nSo, while the Dewey system has its fine points, when you’re setting out to look something up in the multidimensional folds of L-space what you really need is a ball of string.\n\nTerry Pratchett, Guards! Guards!\n\nLibrary Joy\n\nA Knowledge Commons and a Space of Openness\n\nAt Stimpunks, we’re building a knowledge commons and a space of openness, at the edges.\n\nFor me this space of radical openness is a margin a profound edge. Locating oneself there is difficult yet necessary. It is not a “safe” place. One is always at risk. One needs a community of resistance.\n\nLiving as we did on the edge we developed a particular way of seeing reality. We looked both from the outside in and from the inside out. We focused our attention on the centre as well as on the margin. We understood both.\n\nChoosing the Margin as a Space of Radical Openness, bell hooks\n\nWe’re contributing to a library economy.\n\nA library economy would require a vast reorientation of our priorities from the centrality of capital and competition to the centrality of humanity and cooperation, which brings us to the final core concept for a library economy: complementarity.\n\nWe Need A Library Economy – YouTube\n\nRevolutionaries can engage in building full-fledged library economies based on the commons.\n\nThis can take the form of tool libraries, vehicle libraries, clothing libraries, furniture libraries, and more in an effort curb overproduction, end planned obsolescence, and provide access to an irreducible minimum to all.\n\nHow We Can Change The World – YouTube\n\nA Third Place and a Safe Space for Possibility\n\nLibraries are THE third places.\n\nIf you’re not at home and you’re not at work or school but you are at a place that provides community without being required to buy stuff, where are you?\n\nYou’re in third space.\n\nQuick little “how to” for including autistic people in community events 🥰 #autism #autistic – YouTube\n\nCharacteristics of third places:\n\nneutral ground\n\nleveling place\n\nconversation space\n\nopen & accessible\n\nregulars\n\nlow profile\n\nplayful mood\n\nhome away from home\n\nWhat Our Cities Are Missing – YouTube\n\nLibraries are safe spaces that nurture possibility.\n\nHave you really read all these?\n\nSomeone walks into your house and sees your many books on your many bookshelves. Have you really read all these? they ask. This person does not understand knowledge. A good library is comprised in large part by books you haven’t read, making it something you can turn to when you don’t know something. He calls it: the Anti-Library.\n\nI remember once in college, the pride I felt about being able to write an entire research paper with stuff from my own anti-library. We all have books and papers that we haven’t read yet. Instead of feeling guilty, you should see them as an opportunity: know they’re available to you if you ever need them.\n\nThis is the mark you must aim for as a researcher, to not only have enough material - and to know where the rest of what you haven’t read will be located - on hand to do your work. You must build a library and an anti-library now… before you have an emergency presentation or a shot at a popular guest post.\n\nThe 5-Step Research Method I Used For Tim Ferriss, Robert Greene, and Tucker Max\n\nWe Need a Library Economy: Usufruct, the Irreducible Minimum, and Complementarity\n\nIn The Ecology of Freedom, social ecologist Murray Bookchin spends a lot of time exploring three key concepts: usufruct, the irreducible minimum, and complementarity.\n\nThese concepts are foundational to any cooperative, caring, and egalitarian society, but particularly to what Bookchin called ‘organic society,’ which consist of the egalitarian tribal societies that can be found in much of human history.\n\nBeginning with the first essential concept for a library economy, usufruct refers to the freedom of individuals or groups in a community to access and use, but not destroy, common resources to supply their needs.\n\nThe second essential concept for a library economy is the irreducible minimum, which is the guaranteed provision of the means necessary to sustain life, the level of living that no one should ever fall below, regardless of the size of their individual contribution to the community.\n\nComplementarity is a way of looking at non-hierarchical differences within a society as something generative, where each person contributes a small part to an outcome greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nWe Need A Library Economy – YouTube\n\nWe are participating in the library economy with our “Things Library“.\n\nA library economy would require a vast reorientation of our priorities from the centrality of capital and competition to the centrality of humanity and cooperation, which brings us to the final core concept for a library economy: complementarity.\n\nWe Need A Library Economy – YouTube\n\nLibraries are Punk AF\n\nBooks are for use.\n\nEvery person his or her book.\n\nEvery book its reader.\n\nSave the time of the reader.\n\nA library is a growing organism.\n\nFive laws of library science – Wikipedia\n\nLibrarians Rock\n\nLibraries are the last place in America where you are valued for your personhood, rather than the contents of your wallet. At the library, you are a patron, not a customer.\n\nLibrarians are kind of upside-down cops: public employees who are stepping in wherever the rest of our services have failed.\n\nThey Want to Kill Libraries. The Last Place in America Where You Are… | by Cory Doctorow | Nov, 2022 | Medium\n\nWhile on the subject of burning books, I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength, their powerful political connections or great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and destroyed records rather than have to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles.\n\nSo the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House, the Supreme Court, the Senate, the House of Representatives, or the media. The America I loved still exists at the front desks of our public libraries.\n\nKurt Vonnegut, A Man Without a Country\n\nBooks of the Edges\n\nCollected below are some books of the edges we recommend. We provide WorldCat links and embed Amazon previews. The Librarian, visiting us from Discworld via L-space, will guide your journey with the alacrity offered by prehensile hands and feet.\n\nWe’d like to grow our library into something like The Bi Pan Library with synopses, selected quotes, contextualization, and more. Interested in helping?\n\nNeuroTribes\n\nOur community recommends NeuroTribes to everyone. NeuroTribes changed the conversation about what it is to be human. It is a history of the 20th Century through the lens of the dispossessed and misunderstood. It is a trip through anguish and horror and a celebration of the minds that survived to make modernity.\n\nTake a trip through the pages of NeuroTribes with this talk from author Steve Silberman.\n\nRecent Releases in Our Own Voices\n\nI cannot get on board with approaches to disability that do not understand it as inherently, inextricably tied to racism and other oppressions. I cannot and will not promote a disability-first or disability-pride-only analysis—and the research that undergirds this book has only solidified and clarified for me these beliefs that I once held more quietly and tentatively. In claiming this Black disability identity, I often use we, ours, and us when referring to disabled people, Black people, and Black disabled people. I refuse to use they as if I am separate from the communities I write about, live within, and learn from every day.\n\nBlack Disability Politics\n\nMy first day of school was full of tears and utter terror as I desperately tried to cry out for my mum to return and take me home. But I had no words. While the teachers would say I refused to talk, even at the age of four I knew this wasn’t true. My words were stuck and I couldn’t talk.\n\nTaking off the Mask: Practical Exercises to Help Understand and Minimise the Effects of Autistic Camouflaging\n\nThe Future Is Disabled : Prophecies, Love Notes and Mourning Songs\n\nAutistic Collaboration Trust\n\nAll books featured by the Autistic Collaboration Trust are written by members of the Autistic community and contribute to the co-creation of Autistic culture.\n\nThe Beauty of Collaboration at Human Scale (2021)\n\nNeuroqueer Heresies (2021)\n\nAutistic Community and the Neurodiversity Movement (2019)\n\nBeing Autistic (2019)\n\nA Field Guide to Earthlings (2010)\n\nThrough the Eyes of Aliens (1998)\n\nNeuroDiversity: The Birth of an Idea (1998)\n\nDon’t Mourn for Us (1993)\n\nSource: Books | Autistic Collaboration\n\nFundamental Texts of Progressive Pedagogy\n\nOur friends at Human Restoration Project suggest that their community read these four “fundamental texts of progressive pedagogy” to understand their philosophy.
