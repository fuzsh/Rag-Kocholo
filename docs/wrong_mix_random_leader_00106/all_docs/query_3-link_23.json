Pratchett has also been a longtime supporter and trustee of the Orangutan Foundation UK, and, after his diagnosis with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in 2007, became a leading advocate for Alzheimer's research, contributing funds and urging others to do the same, and raising public awareness of the disease and its implications through the 2009 Scottish BAFTA-winning BBC documentary Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer's, which explored the state of current research and the difficulties of living with the disease, and the 2011 BBC documentary Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, which explored the subject of assisted death.\n\nTickets:\n\nPrice: $5 for NPC members, $15 for non-members.
