He was born on this day in 1948 and is best known for his funny fantasy novels, especially the fantastic Discworld series. He also had successful collaborations with Stephen Baxter and Neil Gaiman, with Good Omens being adapted for TV and radio and being performed in the theatre. \n\nHe wrote for his school magazine and pursued a career in journalism.  In 1987 he was able to become a full-time writer. In addition to his works for adults he also wrote many for children including the funny ‘Father Christmas's Fake Beard’.\n\nHe received his knighthood as part of the 2009 New Year’s Honours List, received multiple awards for his writing and was the recipient of ten honorary degrees from British, Irish and Australian institutions. \n\nOne of Pratchett’s best-known characters is the Librarian from the Discworld series who was turned into an orangutan (we in libraries don’t know what to make of this comparison) and Pratchett was a trustee of the Orangutan Foundation. Many of his fans have adopted this foundation as their nominated charity as a result which is a lovely legacy to have. \n\n#SirTerryPratchett #Discworld #GoodOmens #dlrLibraries\".",
