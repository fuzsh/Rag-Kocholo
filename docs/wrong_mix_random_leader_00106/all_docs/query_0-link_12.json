        "text": "Autumn 2022\n\nKey SF News & SF Awards\n\nThe 2022 Hugo Awards were announced at this year's Chicon 8 Worldcon. This year, 2,235 final ballots were received more than in any previous year since 1953, except the 2014-2019 period, and 2021.\n\nOnce again we are not listing all the results but only those categories for which a reasonable number of nomination votes. So, again as per last year, we are listing only those categories that have garnered over 500 nomination votes. Any category having less than 500 nominated votes becomes, as SF encyclopaedist Peter Nicholls put it, more of a popularity contest among Worldcon regulars than a principal category of interest to the broader SF community beyond the Worldcon.\n\nThe principal category Hugo wins this year therefore were:-\n\nBest Novel: A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine\n\nBest Novella: A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers\n\nBest Short Story: 'Where Oaken Hearts Do Gather' by Sarah Pinsker\n\nBest (Book) Series: Wayward Children by Seanan McGuire\n\nBest Dramatic Presentation  Long Form: Dune (trailer here)\n\nOther category (win information) (those categories with less than 500 nominating votes) can be found at thehugoawards.org.

It is a juried award with a US$25,000 (£21,800) cash prize that aims to honour book-length work of imaginative fiction. The winner will be announced later this year on 21st October, 2022, what would have been Ursula K. Le Guins birthday. The short-list consists of:-\n\n- After the Dragons by by Cynthia Zhang\n\nIn a future Beijing afflicted by a climate-induced disease, two young men are drawn to each other, and to the citys dragons. Cynthia Zhangs debut looks at climate and equity through the lens of connection  to each other and to the creatures whose world we share.\n\n- Appleseed by Matt Bell\n\nIn three braided stories, Matt Bell uses science fiction, myth, and fairytale in an exploration of how humanity moves both with and against the world. From two brothers seeding the land with apple trees to a distant future in which one lonely being crosses whats left of North America after climate change.\n\n- Elder Race by Adrian Tchaikovsky\n\nOn a distant planet, an anthropologist in a tower has become part of local mythology  a sorcerer with seemingly incredible powers that might help a Fourth Daughter against a threatening demon. Adrian Tchaikovsky gives equal weight to the way two very different people see their world, showing that both stories  science and myth  are true, and both necessary for survival.\n\n- The Employees: A Workplace Novel of the 22nd Century by Olga Ravn\n\nOlga Ravns novella is told in a series of reports made by the crew  human and otherwise  of an intergenerational, deep space ship. The Employees is set in a world where productivity has subsumed everything else. There is only work, and what people find in or despite of it: curiosity, attachment to strange objects, and an unsettled relationship with their humanoid colleagues.\n\n- The House of Rust by Khadija Abdalla Bajaber\n\nYoung Aisha sets out in the company of a talking cat and a boat made of bones to rescue her fisherman father. Khadija Abdalla Bajabers debut novel is grounded in a vivid sense of place and the way she continuously expands both Aishas world and her understanding of it  a world of leviathans, snake gods, and crows whose sharp eyes are on everyone.\n\n- How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia Nagamatsu\n\nIn 2030, the Arctic plague rewrites the way people live. In How High We Go In the Dark, Sequoia Nagamatsu imagines what a world shaped by this plague might look like  funerary skyscrapers, a theme park for dying children, new uses for technology  and how humanity could still find love and human connection in it.\n\n- The Past Is Red by Catherynne M. Valente\n\nTetley Abednego lives on a garbage patch in the middle of the sea  one of the only liveable places left in a flooded world. Catherynne M. Valentes post-apocalyptic world looks like no one elses, and despite the hard parts of Tetleys existence, shes resilient, wise, and full of hope that we can still make a broken world into a home.\n\n- A Snake Falls to Earth by Darcie Little Badger\n\nA cottonmouth kid making his way in a world of spirits and monsters and a Lipan girl from our near future find their lives intersecting in Darcie Little Badgers gracefully told young adult novel about home, stories, family, friendship, and the interconnectedness of worlds.\n\n- Summer in the City of Roses by Michelle Ruiz Keil\n\nIn Michelle Ruiz Keils punk-rock fairytale, a girl goes looking for her runaway brother in 1990s Portland, Oregon. What both of them find in the vintage shops and secret corners of the city is something else: Transformation, understanding, and a world more varied and welcoming and strange than they knew.\n\nThe World Fantasy Awards short-list has been announced. The principal category short-lists are:-\n\nNovel\n\n- Black Water Sister by Zen Cho\n\n- A Master of Djinn by P.

The Self-Published Science Fiction Competition, created by Hugh Howey and Duncan Swan, is modelled after Mark Lawrences fantasy cousin award. It cleverly assesses 300 submissions using ten teams of judges who are book bloggers. They read and scored the books through several elimination rounds. In the final round the top seven books were read by all judges. Iron Truth by S. A. Tholin is a military SF story. She is a Swedish author who studied English at Cambridge University.\n\nIron Truth sees Joy who was supposed to wake from cryo-sleep and take her place as a biologist among 30,000 settlers coming to make a new world beautiful. Instead, shes rousted half-alive on a different, inhospitable planet  Cato  where a previous colony ship arrived a long time ago but the good start its settlers made has gone bad. Why is Joys ship there?\n\nAt 244,000 words, this is a Hamilton-sized novel that starts off as military SF but halfway through segues into an SF horror\n\nOther SF news includes:-\n\nThe Russian SF author Dmitry Glukhovsky has been placed on Putin's Russia's wanted list. Dmitry (the author of Metro 2033) has spoken out against Russia's illegal war with Ukraine. He faces prosecution for spreading false information about the war in Ukraine  that is, calling it a war and condemning this as a bad thing. Russia's Interior Ministry's website listed Glukhovsky as wanted under an unspecified article of the criminal code. Russia has already targeted opposition figures and journalists with a law seeking jail terms of up to 15 years for those convicted of intentionally spreading \"fake\" news about Russia's military. The SF author is the first major cultural figure to be put on the wanted list due to the new law, adopted days after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on 24th February (2022). But he does have support from Russian opposition figures. Lyubov Sobol, an ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, wrote on Twitter: \"Putin used to fear politicians, but now he fears writers too.\" The team of another jailed opposition activist, Andrei Pivovarov, wrote on Twitter in response to Glukhovsky's addition to the wanted list: \"The repression machine will roll everyone over.\" In a post on the Telegram messaging app, Glukhovsky wrote that he stood accused of discrediting Russia's armed forces in an Instagram post. \"I am ready to repeat everything said there: 'Stop the war! Admit that this is a war against an entire nation and stop it!'\" Being placed on the list is a badge of honour.\n\nThere were two, mixed SFNAL responses over the summer to the illegal war by Russia with Ukraine. The first came from the Terminator franchise star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Calling for Europe to cease imports of Russian fossil fuel at the Austrian World Summit in Vienna, he said: \"We have blood on our hands because we are financing the war.\" The second was a lack of response from the Western Guest of Honour SF author (having put the Ukraine flag on his Facebook cover picture) at the forthcoming China Worldcon where who is happy to stand on a stage alongside a Russian author who has repeatedly avowed, and rallied other Russian authors to, support for Putin and his invasion as well as a Chinese author who supports his nations treatment of the Uyghur's. The implication of both responses clearly signals that apparently it is OK to support Ukraine unless the said support inconveniences you in some way.\n\n++++ Related news elsewhere China 2023 Worldcon spring 2022 news as well as:-\n\n Horror Writers Association condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n The Authors Guild condemns the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n The SFWA did not originally want to take a stand on Ukrainian invasion but then changed its mind with a basic statement of support.\n\n The European SF Society suspends Russia and Belarus.\n\n Western science publishers are divided over Russian research paper ban\n\nRomanian SF convention of the summer looked at climate change. AntareSFest 2022 was held in the Transylvanian city of Brasov at the start of September: a city surrounded by mountains. Since the Romanian Eurocons of 1994 and 2001, Romanian conventions have tended to be small affairs and this one saw around a score attend. This one was the 6th annual event organised by the Antares SF Society of Brasov. Its theme was rather fatalisticalIy titled 'Climate change, the end of mankind?' It was held in the George Baritiu public library with the support of the Brasov Council. One of the outputs was a number of short SF stories related to climate change and it is hoped an anthology will be published.\n\nThe 2022 Worldcon, Chicon 8, has been held. This was held in the Hyatt Regency, Chicago, US. As of two months before the convention there were 2,964 attending members, with other categories (such as child and non-attending supporters bringing up the pre-convention membership numbers to 4,878. By the end of the convention there were about 6,500 total memberships all types. 3,574 warm bodies registered, about 500 of them walkins. Around a thousand had logged into the Airmeet site for virtual programme by mid-Monday's closing. The programme largely consisted of panels but there were a good few talks (the programme items that see the best preparation, but sadly this was one of those Worldcons with no film programme, so no showcasing of SF cinema from around the World. (Tip of the hat to the 2010 Worldcon that had the best SF film programme of the past two decades. However, the science programme (which was particularly good) we cover in the next item below. And, of course, during the convention the Hugo Awards were presented.\n\nThe 2022 Worldcon's science programme.&nbsp. With almost two-and-a-half times the number of science programme items at this year's Worldcon, Chicon III, than last year, the 2022 Worldcon made up for what was arguably the weakest SF Worldcon science programme of a decade in 2021. Second, as important, this year's Worldcon's science programme has to be a first in roughly over two decades with non-astronomical and non-space science programme items outnumbering space related items: usually around half the science programme is space related, with physics, biology, chemistry, geoscience, engineering, computing, etc., having to be shoe-horned into the other half of the programme. So, it's double a BIG thumbs up to this year's Worldcon's science programme organisers! One, for bringing back science to Worldcon and two for the most balanced science programme in very many years. As usual we list the convention's science programme items, in part for your information as to the cons SF and science interface, but also as an historical aid to Worldcon science programme organisers.\n\nUp first, the space related items: 'The Challenge of Orbital Debris'; 'Living on Space Stations'; ''NASA's Psyche Mission: Electric Voyage to a Metal Asteroid'; 'Re-engineering the Solar System' (science slanted towards the SF); What Is It with Desert (and Ocean) Planets'; 'Terraforming and Alien Life'; 'Extraterrestrial Life on Inhospitable Worlds'; 'A Brief History of Astronomical Devices' 'Big Rocket Economics'; 'Why the World Needs Solar Power Satellites'; ' Geoffrey A. Landis' (limited number encounter with the physicist and SF author); 'Viewing the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse'; 'What Will the Aliens Look Like?'.\n\nAnd the rest of science (non-space-related): 'Oops! Lab Disasters and What We Learn from Them'; 'Real Space Combat'; 'Rising Oceans, Blurring Genres' (really a more climate in SF panel than climate science); 'Future Medicine: Getting From Here to There'; 'The Emerging Challenge of Radio Frequency Noise'; 'DNA Is Just a Code'; 'A Trip Through Deep Time Session One' and 'Session Two' (limited attendance workshops); 'Improbable Research Dramatic Readings' (led by the founder of the Ig Nobel Prize); ''Science: The Core of Science Fiction's Sense of Wonder'; 'Table Talk - G. David Nordley' (science writer limited encounter session; 'Really Big Things (megastructures)'; 'Playing in the Toolbox of Creation' (gene editing); 'Pig Hearts and Printed Organs: New Frontiers in Medicine'; 'The Biology of Fantasy Creatures'; 'Aliens Did Not Build the Pyramids' (archaeology); 'Inventor of the Future: The Visionary Life of Buckminster Fuller'; 'Ask a Scientist' (Q&A); 'A Technology That Changed Everything'; 'Getting the \"Cyber\" Part Right'; 'So You Want to Get a PhD (Science)'; 'The Ecology Strikes Back'; 'Cyborgs Are Now Us'; 'Really Weird Science: An Intro to Real Quantum Computing'; 'How \"Hard\" Can It Be?' (an SF-science interface panel); Future Food'; 'Brains Don't Work Like That'; 'Scientists: Fiction vs. Reality'; 'Should We Send Robots or People?' (space exploration); 'Science in Science Fiction: The Guesswork of 1946'; 'What Science Fiction Gets Wrong About My Profession'; 'Geologists and Cartographers Would Like a Word'; 'Life Extension in Fact and Fiction'; 'Synthetic Biology and \"Biohacking\"'; 'Real Science, or Science Fiction?'; 'Table Talk - Diane Kelly' (limited number encounter with a neuroscientist); 'What Is Our Climate Future?'; and 'Life After Humanity'.\n\nThe 2022 Worldcon has supported Ukraine, but ignored the Uyghurs' plight. The 2023 Worldcon (Chengdu, China) has one Guest of Honour, Sergei Lukyanenko, who has headed a petition in support of Putin and his war against Ukraine. The Chicon 8, 2022 Worldcon in Chicago saw the World SF Society (WSFS, under whose auspices Worldcons are held) business meeting pass a motion calling on the 2023 Worldcon to withdraw its invitation for Sergei Lukyanenko as one of its Guests of Honour. The 2023 Chengdu Worldcon so far has refused to do so. Nonetheless, the WSFS motion calling on Chengdu to disinvite is most laudable: it is important that the SF community bears witness when an SF professional supports crimes against humanity as well as alleged war crimes.\n\nHowever, the Chicago Worldcon WSFS business meeting, ignored the plight of the Uyghur's in China who are being put into concentration camps for 'cultural re-education' amidst human rights concerns of forced sterilisation and seΧual abuse, by the Chinese government. This policy is supported by the 2023 Chengdu Worldcon's Chinese Guest of Honour Cixin Liu.\n\nLast season we expressed concern that the 2023 Worldcon was honouring both Lukyanenko and Liu and called upon that convention's N. American Guest of Honour not to share the 2023 Worldcon platform with those who hold the views of his fellow Guests of Honour. This years the Worldcon (WSFS) business meeting did see an attempt to introduce a motion to censure the 2023 Chengdu Worldcon, but this was to chastise it for failing to deliver on preparations for the event (see the next item). However, a two-thirds majority was needed to introduce new business to the meeting and only about a quarter of those there voted to have the motion considered.\n\nThat the WSFS has remained silent on having one GoH who has stated support for crimes against humanity on one hand, yet spoken out against another, as well as tried (and failed) to get a motion on failing to deliver passed, is revealing as to Worldcon fans' hierarchy of priorities. Given a motion on failure to deliver was at least attempted (even if it failed) demonstrated that the Worldcon community is more concerned about the quality and timing of the Chengdu Worldcon's delivery than it is having a Guest of Honour who publicly supports the Chinese government's actions against the Uyghurs. Apparently, the plight of ethnic groups does not matter that much .! Nonetheless, the Worldcon community has recently made some, what it considers, important progressive steps, just that they are not meaningful ones that bear witness to people's life and death But, hey, at least professionals are prepared to nail their colours to the mast winteriscoming.net/2022/03/16/dear-worldcon-why-we-should-not-host-hugos-china-uyghur/.\n\nThe 2023 Chengdu Worldcon news. It looks like its dates are changing from 23rd - 29th to 16th - 20th August '23. Problems in setting up a means to transfer funds from the West to China have meant that western registrations have been put on hold. There are currently no back up plans in case Chengdu is put in CoVID lockdown other than there will be a virtual component to the convention. Chengdu are also hoping for 'official' Chinese government sponsorship of the convention and that should bring with it mechanisms for ease of getting visas for western participants  currently there are no special visa arrangements. There are also issues with direct international flights to Chengdu as many have been suspended due to CoVID. With corporate sponsorship the convention feels that it should have good translation services for some of the programming. Finally, at the WSFS business meeting at this year's (2022) Chicon 8 Worldcon in Chicago, the Chengdu 2023 Worldcon organisers revealed that as yet no hotel contracts had been signed. With just a year to the Chengdu Worldcon, that event is very late in getting fundamental aspects to its convention sorted. Add this to the political concerns the convention has engendered, with banking issues, unconfirmed hotel arrangements together with travel issues, and it looks like Chengdu 2023 will go down in history as the most controversial Worldcon to date.\n\nThe 2024 Worldcon Glasgow bid won. The results of the 2024 Worldcon site selection vote was announced at this year's Chicon 8, Worldcon 2022 in Chicago business meeting. This comes as no surprise, which we reported last season as other than the usual spoof/joke bids, Glasgow was the only serious bid. Following the win the Guests of Honour (GoHs) were announced. These include: Ken MacLeod (SF novelist  Dark Light, Intrusion, The Restoration Game, Dissidence among much else) and zoologist); Nnedi Okorafor (author  The Book of Phoenix and graphic novelist including for Black Panther); Chris Baker (artist who has worked with Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton and Stanley Kubrick among others and whose work appears on numerous SF/F covers); and Teri Windling (fantasy author). Claire Brialey & Mark Plummer are to be the fan GoHs.\n\nThere is an initial short, promotional, musical video here to celebrate the bid win.\n\nFake SF Worldcon merchandise from the 2022 and 2024 Worldcons has been on sale through RedBubble. Both the 2022 Chicon 8 and 2024 Glasgow Worldcons have had their accounts suspended from RedBubble. Both conventions have asked that fans ensure that they get their convention merchandise from a genuine source. This may not always be the convention, as some conventions allow other vendors to utilise their name. And to make sure that any artwork folk buy online comes from the actual artist or license holder. One issue is that RedBubble do not reduce the quality of artwork on their web page which makes it easy for fraudsters to copy.\n\nUganda launches a bid to hold the Worldcon despite human rights concerns. The bid is for 2028 and is called Kampcon. It is proposed to hold the convention on the northern shores of Lake Victoria 7.5 miles (12 km) from the centre of Kampala at Speke Resort Munyonyo and Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort. This is a 5-star luxury resort set in 90 acres of grounds which \"stands as the definitive pinnacle to opulent living\". Given there is a express motorway to Entebbe Airport 23 miles (37 km) away, it means that Worldcon goers will be able to travel directly to the convention without undue contact with the local community. As with the political controversy over the 2023 China Worldcon there are concerns over Uganda's human rights record. Uganda scores 4.48 on the Democracy Index where it is billed as a 'hybrid regime'. Its Freedom House score is 34 and is cited as 'Not Free' (For comparison the United Kingdom scores 93 and the USA 83, both billed as 'Free'.) The reasons for its low score include: widespread public sector corruption; human rights issues such as the use of torture by the state and extrajudicial killings; and common child labour All of which by comparison makes Uganda's LGBT+ rights record seem positively virtuous! In 2009 Uganda dropped proposals for an Anti-HomoseΧuality Bill which would have increased criminalisation of the LGBT+ community by introducing the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, or are HIV-positive, and engage in same-seΧ seΧual acts. Though, the act was passed in 2013, albeit with the death penalty dropped, in 2014 the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the bill invalid. That some recent Worldcon bids have come from countries with serious human and political rights issues, and with China hosting in 2023, that Uganda with its human rights record can formally bid is a sign that the SF Worldcon (the WSFS) constitution and rules is truly broken.\n\nAll change at France's Les Imaginales literary festival. The festival has been funded by the city of Épinal (south of Nancy, in Haute Saone) for 20 years and run by the fest's director, Stéphanie Nicot, for all that time: 21 iterations of the fest. She reported to the director of cultural affairs at Éipinal. At 70 years old she had just instigated a five-year handover period to a successor but a change of town mayor, to Patrick Nardin, has seen her removed from the post. As recently as May (2022) Épinal's director of cultural affairs, Stéphane Wieser had said that Stéphanie Nicot would not be removed from post, especially as the 21st Imaginales was so successful. Yet behind the scenes there were tensions. Les Imaginales had been very much book orientated but even before the new mayor, Épinal had wanted to see the fest's scope broadened to include cinema, video games and art. Indeed recently, the Fest had invited some academics (scientists and historians) to participate in specific programme items. Further, we understand that the director of cultural affairs at Éipina, Stéphane Wieser, himself will no longer be overseeing the fest on behalf of Épinal, but that the new Mayor will take over that along with his mayoral duties. Further, the fest has seen some tangential fallout of 'me too' harassment within France's genre publishing sector and the fest has established what is in effect a code of conduct. Finally, the fest's future finances remain uncertain. Its last operational budget was €430,000 (£352,500) but this did not include staff salaries or municipal venue costs. Recently it has been increasing income from publishers, book dealers and from catering meaning so that last year Épinal only had to provide €115,000 plus salaries and some venue facilities. However, the manner of Stéphanie Nicot's departure has ruffled some feathers. For example, it has been reported that some fest regulars, such as the authors Lionel Davoust, Estelle Faye and Jean-Claude Dunyach, will no longer be attending.\n\nThe 2022 Filkcon has been cancelled. The Government is still using the venue hotel in Grantham to house Afghanistan refugees. The organisers are considering whether or not to hold the event in 2024 but, as the Government is being very slow to find permanent housing for the refuges, that may not be possible. Another option would be to have a dedicated filk programme stream at next year's Eastercon. This is something the Eastercon committee have offered.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) has been hacked with members data taken and posted publicly. The data released was anything members opted to share with fellow SFWA members including email, telephone, websites, social media accounts, and mailing addresses in individual members' profile. Members who opted out of sharing information in the directory were not affected. No financial data, confidential, or legal information was scraped from the directory as those have always been set to no access by the SFWA admin or held in entirely different places within its infrastructure.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) dropped author Mercedes Lackey from its end-of-May virtual Nebula conference. It took place the day after the SFWA celebrated her as their latest Grand Master. The SFWA said: \"We learned yesterday that while participating in the Romancing Sci-Fi & Fantasy panel, Mercedes Lackey used a racial slur. First, we apologize to our attendees and the other panellists who were subjected to that slur. Weve disabled access to the panel to avoid any additional harm being caused. Second, we are immediately removing Mercedes Lackey from the conference and the additional panels she was scheduled for, in accordance with SFWAs Moderation Policy.\" Mercedes responded with an apology and explanation. \"On a panel at the 2022 Nebulas, I had the chance to celebrate authors who wrote positive gay characters long before me. Chip Delany is obviously a major player in that game. Because there are two Samuel Delanys  theres one from Texas  I wanted to make sure people got hold of the right one. So, in my excitement, I got caught in a mental/verbal stumble between 'black' and 'person of colour', and as best I can remember, what came stuttering out was something like 'spcolored'. She added: \"Im not an amazing speaker. I stammer, I freeze up, & I get things wrong. I am sorry that I bungled a modern term while bringing attention to an amazing black creator.\" Mercedes is known for her Valdemar series of fantasy novels. The Texas Delany later said that he was not offended by Mercedes slip.\n\nBalticon removes author Stephanie Burke from its programme. The removal, by the US convention Balticon 56, was due a volunteer making a Code of Conduct complaint. The volunteer allegedly then yelled at the author who was removed mid-panel! Subsequently, the convention's Chair, Yakira Heistand, later apologised to Stephanie Burke, with the Chair reportedly giving the excuse that the removal was due to an 'overzealous volunteer', allegedly Lisa Adler-Goldman. (Apparently appallingly rude, aggressive, abusive and slanderous equates with 'overzealous'.) Balticon is a long-running series of conventions organised by the Baltimore Science Fiction Society. Stephanie Burke has appeared on the programme of a number of Balticons but may decide never again to be associated with that event or the Society. Lisa Adler-Goldman reportedly subsequently gave a succinct apology. It does appear that those applying Codes of Conduct need to abide by them themselves and not weaponise them. ++++ Codes of Conduct at conventions are relatively new and, though welcomed by some, are less so by others.\n\nFormer Salt Lake Comic Con organiser arrested for making bomb threats. Apparently Bryan Brandenburg was upset at a court for taking so long to come to a ruling over his divorce case and so started threatening to bomb them. He faces a possible prison sentence. Brandenburg is no longer part of the FanX Salt Lake Comic Convention, that was originally called the Salt Lake Comic Con. It had to change its name following a challenge by the San Diego Comic Con in what some might say was a debatable decision.\n\nStill time (if you are in Britain) to check out the Doctor Who Worlds of Wonder Exhibition in Liverpool.

The Sulaco  on its return journey from LV-426  enters a sector controlled by the Union of Progressive Peoples, a nation-state engaged in an ongoing cold war and arms race. U.P.P. personnel board the Sulaco and find hyper-sleep tubes with Ripley, Newt, and an injured Hicks. A Face-hugger attacks the lead commando, and the others narrowly escape, taking what remains of Bishop with them. The Sulaco continues to Anchorpoint, a space station and military installation the size of a small moon, where it falls under control of the militarys Weapons Division. Boarding the Sulaco, a team of Colonial Marines and scientists is assaulted by a pair of Xenomorph drones. In the fight Ripleys cryotube is badly damaged. Its taken aboard Anchorpoint, where Ripley is kept comatose. Newt and an injured Corporal Hicks are awakened, and Newt is sent to Gateway Station on the way to Earth. The U.P.P. sends Bishop to Anchorpoint, where Hicks begins to hear rumours of experimentationthe cloning and genetic modification of Xenomorphs.
