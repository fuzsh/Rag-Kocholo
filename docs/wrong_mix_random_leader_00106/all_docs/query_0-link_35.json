        "text": "In just a few short hours from the time of this writing, the nominees for the 95th Academy Awards will be announced via Disney+. Why do we announce the nominees a full month into the New Year on a streaming service? Great question for which I have no answer. Were I to be able to ask that question of the Academy, I’d also ask them why they’re holding the actual ceremony itself in mid-March. For context, March 12th is 50-odd weeks after Everything Everywhere All At Once, a movie that will undoubtedly do quite well in nominations and possibly even wins at this very award show, debuted in theaters. So. Lots of questions, not a lot of answers here, I’m sorry.\n\n2022 is an odd movie year to evaluate. There were the obligatory highs and lows, of course, but in some ways it felt like a year spent in Bizarro World. Many of the Oscar-y movies fell flat both at the box office and with critics and that left a lot of room for big blockbusters, usually a sore spot for the Academy, to break through and carve out some space at the table. I’m here for that, by the way; there’s nothing more annoying to me than Oscar nominations going out to lackluster Oscar-y kinds of films simply because they are Oscar-y even in their mediocrity. Even still, it’s a bit weird to see movies like Top Gun Maverick and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever polling well amongst the standard Academy fare.\n\nOverall, I liked a lot of what 2022 had to offer but few movies separated themselves from the pack. Or perhaps I’d prefer to look at the year’s films in tiers. I’ve got five or so movies in the top tier and they’re hard to choose between as to which of them is the BEST. Then there’s a group of ten or so movies in tier two, also all jammed up. And another ten or fifteen in the tier below that. And so on and so forth. So, for my annual Super Fake Academy Awards Ballot, I’m spreading the wealth around and maybe even getting a little wheels off in some of my choices in an effort to show a little love to a few more movies that I enjoyed in 2022.\n\nNOTE: I’ve yet to see Tar, The Whale, Women Talking, and probably a couple of others that have some weight and bearing in this conversation. I blame limited release and Hollywood’s insistence on dropping 514 movies all at one time one week before the year ends.\n\nORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nBanshees of Inisherin\n\nCha Cha Real Smooth\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\n\nThe Fabelmans\n\nThe Menu\n\nFinal Cuts: Aftersun, Nope, The Woman King\n\nSuper strong category this year, which we love to see given our frequent collective lamenting of how every movie is a sequel, prequel, reboot, or adaptation of an existing property. I’m going Banshees over Fabelmans by a nose simply because, while Martin McDonagh might be the best screenwriter in the business and I always expect perfection from me, this one still blew me away in conceit and content. He’s a genius.\n\nADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nThe Glass Onion\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nFinal Cuts: The Batman, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Thirteen Lives\n\nI went back and forth on this one. I think Rian Johnson’s writing on Glass Onion is even better than it was on Knives Out and I thought Knives Out was brilliant. Maverick isn’t exactly the typical writer-y kind of movie that gets a nod but it speaks to the achievement that this movie is and why it was so successful. I was kind of dreading Pinocchio and was relieved by the touching, incisive way GDT and Patrick McHale reinvented a very tired story. The sweet, funny, unique experience that is Marcel was very hard to overlook and for a while I had this as the winner. But I kept coming to All Quiet, a movie that is haunting me two weeks after my viewing and for which the scripting is impeccable.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nPaul Dano, The Fabelmans\n\nBrendan Gleeson, Banshees of Inisherin\n\nJudd Hirsch, The Fabelmans\n\nKe Huy Quan, Everything Everywhere All the Time\n\nBrad Pitt, Babylon\n\nFinal Cuts: Jovan Adepo (Babylon), Diego Calva (Babylon), Barry Keoghan (Banshees of Inisherin), Edward Norton (The Glass Onion), Seth Rogen (The Fablemans)\n\nI say it every year so here goes: This is always the toughest category to whittle down to five and usually the toughest from which to pick a winner. I expect Keoghan will get a spot in the final five over Pitt and I’m fine with that. For me, Pitt was the most compelling figure in a very flawed film and I think he deserves a spot in the conversation. I would have had him in my final five for Best Actor as well had the studio chosen to run him in that category. I could honestly pick any of the remaining four nominees and be happy with their win and even as I type, I’m having second thoughts and reconsidering Hirsch as the winner. But I’m going to stick with Ke Huy Quan and if that decision is based in part by the narrative of his return to the screen, then so be it, it’s a helluva story and he deserves this win.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nAngela Bassett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nKerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nFrankie Corio, Aftersun\n\nStephanie Hsu, Everything Everywhere All the Time\n\nMichelle Williams, The Fabelmans\n\nFinal Cuts: Jamie Lee Curtis (Everything Everywhere All the Time), Lashana Lynch (The Woman King), Janelle Monae (The Glass Onion), Jean Smart (Babylon)\n\nThis one was tough to narrow down to five nominees and I fully expect to see Jamie Lee Curtis’s name on the list of nominees when I wake up in the morning. I’m fine with that, as long as Hsu is also nominated given that her performance is just as good (better, by my estimation) and her character is vital to their shared film. The winner, though, was a bit easier for me to pick. Bassett is the literal beating heart of Wakanda Forever and her unmatched grace, poise, and strength shines beautifully in that role.\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nTom Cruise, Top Gun Maverick\n\nColin Farrell, Banshees of Inisherin\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, Nope\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Weird: The Al Yankovic Story\n\nAdam Sandler, Hustle\n\nFinal Cuts: Daniel Craig (The Glass Onion), Ralph Fiennes (The Menu), Felix Kammerer (All Quiet on the Western Front), Gabriel LaBelle (The Fabelmans), Paul Mescal (Aftersun)\n\nAlright, here’s where things get admittedly wheels off. I saw ten thoroughly worthy Best Actor performances this year (and expect Brendan Frasier will qualify as number 11 when I finally get to see The Whale). Farrell was so far and away the best performance that, for me, the other four nominations almost don’t matter. This is Farrell’s award (again, pending The Whale), plain and simple. So, I picked slightly against the grain for the other spots. Nope disappointed me a bit but Kaluuya was outstanding. As with the Screenplay nomination, Maverick is not the kind of movie an actor would draw a mention from here usually but at a certain point, I think we ought to just give Cruise an award for being Tom Cruise On Screen for 40 years and if this isn’t the time then when is? Sandler got a SAG nomination for his outstanding turn in Hustle so while I don’t expect to see his name on the list tomorrow, it’s not an overly outlandish take. But I know I’m definitely getting (*puts on sunglasses*) weird with the Radcliffe selection over Fiennes, Craig, and Kammerer. The odds of Radcliffe having his name called are somewhere between 0 and 0.0000001 but I maintain that his comedic performance in one of the more surprisingly good and likable movies of the year is very, very good and deserving of adulation. If you don’t like it, I invite you to eat it. (This is a reference to the Weird Al parody song “Eat It”, sung to the tune of Michael Jackson’s “Beat It.” The best jokes are always the ones you have to explain.)\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nViola Davis, The Woman King\n\nDanielle Deadwyler (Till)\n\nMargot Robbie, Babylon\n\nAna Taylor-Joy (The Menu)\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Everything Everywhere All the Time\n\nFinal Cuts: Dakota Johnson (Cha Cha Real Smooth), Zoe Kazan (She Said), Jennifer Lawrence (Causeway), Carrie Mulligan (She Said), Keke Palmer (Nope), Florence Pugh (Don’t Worry Darling)\n\nLots of good nominees and potential nominees here. I very nearly made a spot for Queen Florence who gave one of the very best performances in an awful movie I’ve ever seen. But I just can’t hand out nominations for terrible movies, I’m sorry. Ultimately, this comes down to Davis and Yeoh, both of whom are at the pinnacle of their profession and both of whom gave tremendous performances. It’s Yeoh by a hair for me but I’ll not be sad if Davis comes out the winner. (I assume Cate Blanchett will have a voice in this conversation once I see Tar.)\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nEdward Berger (All Quiet on the Western Front)\n\nJoseph Kosinski, Top Gun Maverick\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, Everything Everywhere All the Time\n\nMartin McDonagh, Banshees of Inisherin\n\nSteven Spielberg, The Fabelmans\n\nFinal Cuts: Gina Prince-Bythwood (The Woman King), Cooper Raiff (Cha Cha Real Smooth), Rian Johnson (The Glass Onion), Matt Reeves (The Batman), Dean Fletcher Camp (Marcel the Shell with Shoes On)\n\nThe nominees are pretty straight forward for me on this one, as I’m rolling with the directors of what I think are the five best movies I saw in 2022. Prince-Bythwood was, I thought, a lock here but I can’t get All Quiet out of my head and it made a late surge into the top five at the expense of The Woman King, with my deepest apologies. Picking the winner is a much more difficult task due to the feeling of this being a tier kind of thing as mentioned above. So, if we call this a tie, then my very official rule book says the tie goes to Steven Spielberg because he is Steven Spielberg. I fully admit this is a homer pick and I’m okay with your scorn and aggressive eye rolling.\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nBanshees of Inisherin\n\nThe Batman\n\nCha Cha Real Smooth\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\n\nThe Fabelmans\n\nThe Glass Onion\n\nRRR\n\nTop Gun Maverick\n\nThe Woman King\n\nFinal Cuts: Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, The Menu, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\n\nI had six locks here, the films of the five nominated directors plus The Woman King, and two further almost-locks (Cha Cha and The Glass Onion). Sorting out the next five movies, or so, was a challenge. RRR was an absolutely bonkers global sensation that felt too big to ignore and of the remaining choices, The Batman is the one I’m most likely to revisit frequently in the future and also just, I don’t know, I want to give Warner Brothers and DC some credit for FINALLY getting a dark and gloomy movie right. Marcel, Pinocchio, and The Menu are the first three out, all by shades of gray. As for the winner…I could make a case for any of The Fabelmans, Banshees, Everything Everywhere, All Quiet, and Top Gun. It’s a tier, you guys. As it is, I’m spreading the wealth and going with the movie that reminded a whole lot of people how awesome going to the movies can be while simultaneously giving Hollywood a near-perfect example of how to make a big, BIG movie the right way, a lesson that I’m sure will be ignored completely. It’s a huge achievement in filmmaking when it could have just been a huge movie and I love the movie for that.\n\nThe guy next to me is going through it. He’s had a few drinks, sure, more than he or I realized, I think, until he falls into me a few minutes later when he stumbles out toward the bathrooms. But regardless of his level of inebriation, when I glance over at him, leaning forward in his seat while everyone around us stands, eyes closed, head bobbing slightly, I know he’s having a moment. Whatever this song means to him, meant to him at one time, it’s hitting him hard now.\n\nThe couple in front of us in line met at a show in 2006. The guy next to me at the bar went to high school with the lead singer’s cousin. The group down the row once followed the band on a European tour in the early aughts. The dad wandering the aisle with his toddler, wearing matching “WITH LOVE WE WILL SURVIVE” t-shirts, is trying to convey something to his daughter that she can’t understand now but may grasp later in life.\n\nWe are all here because we loved a band.\n\nThere are millions and millions of bands and ostensibly somewhere there is someone who loves each and every one of them, even Nickelback and Florida Georgia Line and Culture Club. If I asked you who your favorite band is, maybe you have a go to answer right on the tip of your tongue. Or maybe you say, “Oh wow, there are so many” and then you rattle off a few names. Or maybe you answer but your answer doesn’t feel right even as you say it and a few minutes or hours later you feel the need to correct yourself; “Actually, my favorite band is…”\n\nAnd maybe you tell the truth when I ask you your favorite band. Or maybe you say something that feels safe because you’re not sure how I feel about your real favorite band. Or maybe you tell me your favorite mainstream band but your real favorite band is one you’re sure I’ve never heard of.\n\nI have loved and continue to love a lot of bands in my life.\n\nI am not now nor have I ever been cool or ahead of the curve, especially when it comes to music. I like to think I know a thing or two about a variety of bands and musicians, I’m very interested in music history, and I have somewhat eclectic taste (though lately it’s been boiled down to Dad Rock and Sad Girl Music more than anything else). But I’ve never been the guy who tells you all about this new little indie band you’ve never heard of and I usually roll my eyes at the folks who do. My favorite band of all-time is Nirvana. If I’m being totally honest, I think my favorite musician right now is Taylor Swift. I’m good with that. But there is something special about loving a band that no one else knows about.\n\nAnd yes, that sentiment has been poisoned by gatekeepers and losers and the guys who own the record store in Hi Fidelity; it has become something annoying at best and toxic at worst. But for every “I bet you’ve never even heard of this band” Guy or “Oh you like Band X, huh? Name five of their songs right now” Gal, there’s someone who holds a small band, a local band, an underdiscovered band, tightly, proudly, like they’ve unearthed some hidden treasure that’s only their own. This is especially true of the bands you discover in your youth.\n\nI grew up in the earliest stages of internet music, of Napster and downloading singles, of mix CDs (not tapes), and the CD burner on my family’s computer might’ve been my best friend. This was a great time for the burgeoning music scene in Dallas-Fort Worth. I know now that this was an era in which just about anyone with a guitar and a demo tape could find a record deal; the industry was handing out contracts like fliers on the windshields in a parking lot. But at the time and in the moment, it felt like my friends and I were a part of something. To see a show and then later hear that band on the radio, to see their names on the charts, even, was a kind of high; “I saw them when they were the fourth billed band at a 70 person club!”\n\nFlickerstick was one of my favorites from this scene. I’m not sure how many times I saw them over a three or four year period but “a handful of times” feels fair enough. Flickerstick existed somewhere between post-grunge alternative and pop punk, the two dominant forms of rock music at the time. I would put them in the “indie rock” genre now but I didn’t really have that terminology in the moment. Regardless, they were a little different from most of the other bands I listened to at the time and that’s part of what drew me to them so strongly. They had a great album, “Welcoming Home the Astronauts”, and a dynamic lead singer in Brandin Lea and their participation (and victory) in VH1’s “Bands on the Run” gave them a mainstream boost. They seemed destined to cement themselves as one of the faces of DFW music.\n\nThings didn’t work out that way, though. Most bands are a fragile, finite thing. Flickerstick was falling apart almost from the start and when their sophomore album, “Tarantula”, disappointed fans and the record label alike, the writing was on the wall. Wikipedia will tell you the band was together from 1997-2009 but in reality it was more like 2005 when guitarist Corey Kreig left the band. I don’t know exactly when I saw them last but I remember feeling let down as I walked out of the last show, knowing that this band, like so many others from my youth, was over.\n\nA local band isn’t the same as a mainstream, big band. The big bands break up and retire only to reunite or unretire all the time. Elton John has been on his farewell tour for half a decade. The Eagles hated each other so much they vowed to only get back together when hell froze over…which is exactly what happened 14 years later. We are all holding out hope that one day Robert Plant and Jimmy Page will be able to be in the same room together for more than 20 minutes so we can finally get that last Led Zeppelin tour we so richly deserve despite all indications that this will not, in fact, ever happen.\n\nA small band, though, a local band, when they break up, the best you can hope for is a “for one night only” kind of thing years down the line. The demand is smaller, the money is lesser, the members leave music behind to sell insurance and raise families. When those bands die, they actually die.\n\nWhen a band you love comes to an end, you have to either hold on tightly to the memory of the thing you loved or gradually let it go. I took the latter path with Flickerstick. There seemed no real chance for a reunion or a 2.0 version of the band. Eventually, I moved from listening to “Astronauts” in its entirety on a regular basis to catching a couple of my favorite songs (“Coke”, “Beautiful”, and “Direct Line to the Telepathic”) when they popped up on my iPod to never hearing their songs because of their absence from streaming platforms. When I migrated my meticulously crafted playlists to Spotify, discovering that Flickerstick wasn’t there caused me legitimate grief but was just the last step in the grieving process. The band was relegated to “hey remember when…” conversations with my best friend who, it turns out, was also a huge Flickerstick fan and who had been at many of the same shows as I had all those years ago.\n\nAnd then last year, a friend sent me a link to a small vinyl pressing of “Astronauts” a local record label was doing. The record had sold out and I’d missed it and I was devastated. (I ended up winning the very first copy of the pressing, signed by the band, in a raffle a few months later and it is the prize of my record collection.) But not too long after, old Flickerstick concert videos started popping up on YouTube. Then the albums arrived on Spotify. Then a pre-order for another pressing of the record. And then the “for one night only…” announcement I had hoped for arrived on Instagram.\n\nMy aforementioned friend and I snapped up tickets to this Flickerstick reunion show as quickly as possible and now, here we sit (sit, not stand, because we are old now and general admission and pit tickets are for our younger selves). We are surrounded by a sea of late-thirtysomethings who are, like us, squinting to see the seat numbers in this dimly-lit venue. We are basically all wearing black t-shirts and Nike Killshots, the official concert uniform of our generation. We all have ear plugs, although they would’ve done us much more good back in our teens before Flickerstick and Bowling For Soup and The Nixons destroyed our earbuds. We are all, I realize as the opening chords to “Smile” kick in, here for a collective, cathartic experience, maybe even closure, on a simpler, easier era of our lives and the joy we got from something that for just a minute felt like our very own special thing.\n\nWe are here because we loved a band.\n\nThe Academy Award nominations will be announced tomorrow, with the ceremony set to commence at the end of March. This is far too long to wait for the ceremony, I agree; moving a full quarter into the following year before we honor the best of the previous year is very stupid but unfortunately, The Academy has yet to ask my opinion. I stand ready to give them said opinion should they ever call. 2021 was a weird year for movies because 2021 was a weird year overall. Many of the movies we looked forward to (at least those of us who are movie nerds deeply invested in the film release calendar each year) were disappointing and the box office was a mess. Even still, I saw a big bunch o’ movies in 2021 because that’s what I do. Overall, I liked what the year had to offer. And one (of the very few) positive byproduct of the pandemic is the accessibility of more and more quality films on the various streaming services. I love movie theaters and I worry about the future of the industry but I won’t lie and tell you that I don’t like having the option to watch the new big movie in my home office at midnight rather than having to find time to go to the theater for each and every movie.\n\nAs always, I don’t have an Oscar vote but that doesn’t stop me from putting together a fake ballot every year. You’ll find said ballot for 2021 below, with my five (or ten) nominees for each of the eight “big” awards (my winner in bold), as well as the movies and performances that just missed the top five.\n\nI will also say that, while I never set out to have a ballot that lines up with the views of the Academy and often have my own choices, I’m usually in the same ballpark as the powers that be in the movie world. In a normal year, there might be a movie or two that gets some praise I don’t agree with or that I love but the Academy doesn’t. This year, however, there are a number of movies and performances that are stacking up nominations across the award circuit, that I very much didn’t jive with. I found Belfast to be a bit tedious and underwhelming, couldn’t get into Tick Tick Boom, and borderline hated both Don’t Look Up and Being the Ricardos, all of which are seemingly guaranteed to feature prominently when the nominations come down tomorrow. To each their own, of course, but I can’t feeling like some of these movies are getting award consideration because we expected them to be great and not because they actually are.\n\nORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, Licorice Pizza\n\nWes Anderson, The French Dispatch\n\nFran Kranz, Mass\n\nMike Mills, C’mon C’mon\n\nMichael Sarnoski, Pig\n\nFinal Cuts: Encanto (Charise Castro Smith, Jared Bush, and Byron Howard), The Harder They Fall (Jaymes Samuel and Boaz Yakin), Swan Song (Benjamin Cleary)\n\nThis category is mostly a toss-up for me this year, with a big jumble of very good movies made from very good scripts but nothing that absolutely must win for me. Pig was a big surprise and much of that is due to Sarnoski’s subtle writing and direction. Kranz put forth one of the more actor-forward scripts I’ve seen in a while and those actors shined because of it. Mills’ dual conceits, a sister in need leaves her child with her estranged brother and the brother’s profession, work seamlessly together. And PT Anderson delivered perhaps his most likable and accessible script in years. I’m giving Wes Anderson the edge here simply because I enjoyed his film the most and the vignette storytelling works perfectly for Anderson’s many quirks.\n\nADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nJane Campion, Power of the Dog\n\nJoel Coen, The Tragedy of MacBeth\n\nSian Heder, CODA\n\nDavid Lowery, The Green Knight\n\nJon Spaiths, Denis Villeneuve, and Eric Roth, Dune\n\nFinal Cuts: The Lost Daughter (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Nightmare Alley (Guillermo Del Toro, Kim Morgan), West Side Story (Tony Kushner)\n\nOf the two scripted categories, Adapted was a bit stronger for me this year (after a few years of the inverse) and thus, I had a hard time choosing. Green Knight didn’t fully connect for me the way I have come to expect with a Lowery movie but I think he deserves credit for translating a 14th century poem into a beautiful film. I’m always interested when Campion pops up with a movie (since it happens so sporadically) and it is the expert structure of the script that makes the twist in the final moments of Power work so well. Coen’s adaptation of the Scottish play owes much of its success to the set design and acting but tightening up MacBeth without sacrificing even an ounce of its story and power is an achievement. And, as I’ve said a million times, Dune is an unfilmable book that was translated and adapted much better than I could have ever dreamed. For me, Heder gets the win by a nose for assembling one of the most joyous, heartfelt films of the decade.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nBradley Cooper, Licorice Pizza\n\nIdris Elba, The Harder They Fall\n\nMike Faist, West Side Story\n\nJason Isaacs, Mass\n\nTroy Kotsur, CODA\n\nFinal Cuts: Ciaran Hinds (Belfast) Kodi Smit-McPhee (Power of the Dog), the male cast of The French Dispatch\n\nThis is always the deepest field and 2021 was no different as my “shortlist” was something like 30 lines long. Cooper is only in Licorice for maybe five minutes but he’s like a firecracker set off in the dead of night and his energy is contagious to the rest of the movie. The Harder They Fall is the coolest movie of the year and Elba is the perfect villain for the movie. Faist was lively and charismatic, making West Side Story’s male lead, Ansel Elgort, look silly by comparison. Isaacs is the lead for much of Mass and delivers some of the film’s most gut wrenching moments. But I don’t think I’m ever going to forget the strength and grace of Kotsur’s performance as the trying-to-figure-it-out dad in CODA nor the moments he shares with his on-screen daughter, Emilia Jones.\n\nNote: I had Jason Segel’s performance in Our Friend as a lock for the five spots before realizing that he is ineligible since the movie technically debuted in 2019 (though it wasn’t available for non-festival goers until 2021). Segel rules and deserves more acclaim for his dramedy work.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nJessie Buckley, The Lost Daughter\n\nAriana DeBose, West Side Story\n\nAnne Dowd, Mass\n\nNaomi Harris, Swan Song\n\nMarlee Matlin, CODA\n\nFinal Cuts: Rebecca Ferguson (Dune), Frances McDormand (The French Dispatch), Cate Blanchett (Nightmare Alley)\n\nThis was a strong, deep field this year, rivaling the Supporting Actor group in a way that doesn’t often happen. Good work, Hollywood! Buckley, as the younger version of Olivia Colman, matched one of the greatest living actresses wonderfully and set the stage for her older counterpart beautifully. Harris drew many more eyes in No Time to Die and (unfortunately) Venom: Let There Be Carnage (I won’t hold that trainwreck against her here, although…) but her soft, quiet performance in Swan Song rivals that of her Oscar-nominated turn in Moonlight. At least in terms of the performance side of things, DeBose was the heart of West Side Story for me in a career-altering way. And from August on, I had Matlin penciled in as a lock to win this category for her magnificent turn as the change-resistant mother in CODA. It’s the last ten minutes of Mass, however, where Dowd jumps to the top of the race for me, her character’s quiet, barely contained resolve, finally bubbling over into an admittedly showy but nonetheless harrowing monologue.\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nMahershala Ali, Swan Song\n\nNicolas Cage, Pig\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, Power of the Dog\n\nWill Smith, King Richard\n\nDenzel Washington, The Tragedy of MacBeth\n\nFinal Cuts: Bradley Cooper (Nightmare Alley), Jonathan Majors (The Harder They Fall), Joaquin Phoenix (C’mon, C’mon)\n\n2021 was a banger for leading performances (both male and female). It was very, very hard to cut the category down and leave out Phoenix, Majors, Cooper, and more. Swan Song is somehow (completely unfathomable to me) Ali’s first lead performance in a movie and he comes in strong with a dual-role. Cumberbatch was less showy than some of his contemporaries here, reminding me of his range and talent outside of the Marvel movies and Sherlock. I didn’t love King Richard overall but it was soooooo good to see Smith do something worthwhile and his work here is excellent. I’ve never been the biggest Cage fan but I think Pig contains his best performance in at least 20 years, if not the best of his entire career. But, for me, the best of the bunch (and maybe by a long stretch) is Denzel letting everyone know that he is, still, after all, Denzel Washington. He dominates MacBeth in a way that very actors could do in a role that would be career-defining for anyone with a lesser resume.\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nJessica Chastain, The Eyes of Tammy Faye\n\nJodie Comer, The Last Duel\n\nAlana Haim, Licorice Pizza\n\nEmilia Jones, CODA\n\nRachel Zegler, West Side Story\n\nFinal Cuts: Stephanie Beatrix (Encanto), Olivia Colman (The Lost Daughter), Kristen Stewart (Spencer)\n\nAs mentioned above, this was a great year for lead performances. There are a couple of actresses I left off my ballot who might’ve won my (fake) vote in a lot of years and picking a winner here is almost a five-way coin flip. Chastain has had some weirdly bad performances of late but absolutely crushes every aspect of Tammy Faye Bakker. The Last Duel wasn’t my jam (at all) but Comer, already a TV super star, outshined her male counterparts, (Matt Damon, Adam Driver, and Ben Afflect) by leaps and bounds. Zegler is a star in the making and perfect in West Side Story. Jones brings such honesty to CODA, centering the movie and giving it its backbone even while occasionally being overshadowed by her supporting cast. In a toss-up, though, I’m going with the most surprising performance which, for me, was Haim. When Pizza was announced, I could not have guessed that Alana would be the star of the movie (considering she’s not even the star of her own band) but she gave us one of the most fun, comedic, and poignant performances of the year.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nJoel Coen, The Tragedy of MacBeth\n\nSian Heder, CODA\n\nJaymes Samuel, The Harder They Fall\n\nSteven Spielberg, West Side Story\n\nDenis Villeneuve, Dune\n\nFinal Cuts: Paul Thomas Anderson (Licorice Pizza), Jane Campion (Power of the Dog), Nia DaCosta (Candyman)\n\nI struggled greatly in trying to cut my list down to eight and then the final five. I didn’t set out to do this but it turns out this is a great mix of some of the biggest names in filmmaking and some of the brightest up-and-comers and I love that. Heder made my favorite movie of the year and the one that melted me into a large puddle of tears. Samuel made the coolest movie of the year. Coen adapted an iconic play in tremendous fashion. Villeneuve made the unfilmable film and (if I’m being honest) I’m hedging my bet here a bit, fairly or unfairly, in expecting Dune 2 to be even stronger. I picked Spielberg because I love him dearly (#SpielbergUp #SpielbergStrong #SpielbergNation) and, in much the same way as Denzel did with MacBeth, I felt like West Side Story was Spielberg reminding us that he’s Steven Spielberg. It’s a masterclass in filmmaking from a technical and narrative standpoint and honestly, I’m just really happy to see that my favorite filmmaker still has his fastball. So he gets my vote. Sue me.\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nC’mon, C’mon\n\nCODA\n\nDune\n\nThe Harder They Fall\n\nLicorice Pizza\n\nPig\n\nPower of the Dog\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n\nThe Tragedy of MacBeth\n\nWest Side Story\n\nFinal Cuts: Candyman, Encanto, The French Dispatch, Mass, Swan Song\n\nI drew the line for Best Picture consideration right at 20 movies, some big and accessible, some small and underseen. As mentioned, I don’t know that there were any truly great movies in 2021 but the depth of “good to very good” movies made it tough to narrow it down to ten. I’ve mentioned almost all of these movies herein so I won’t go on about each of them. Spider-Man: No Way Home is likely to be the “controversial” choice here compared to the rest, considering its box office domination and mainstream success. But, for me at least, it’s not here because it was the biggest movie of the year, it’s here because I felt it was also one of the year’s best and for all the complaints about the Disneyfication of our lives, I want to appreciate and honor the studios when they make an ambitious blockbuster, like Avengers: Endgame or No Way Home. CODA gets my Best Picture vote, unsurprisingly; I cannot overstate how beautiful, heartfelt, and joyful this movie is and how much I hope people will see it. In a tight race with no true leader in the clubhouse, “favorite” is my go-to tiebreaker so Coda it is.\n\nThe Academy Award nominations will be announced today, with the ceremony set to commence at the end of April. I don’t have to tell you, dear reader, what a beating 2020 was, nor how much the pandemic disrupted every aspect of our lives. The inability to go to the theater consistently is quite a trivial loss in the face of all the tragedy this last year brought our way but still, it was a significant change for many of us and only added to our feelings of frustration, anxiety, isolation, and every other bad vibe you’ve experienced through the course of this mess. Still, despite how much of a hit the movie industry took this year, I think there’s a lot to celebrate here and, maybe even a bit in spite of myself, I look forward to the nominations, the ceremony, and the discussion that comes with the Oscars. If nothing else, debating something as unimportant as which movie had the fifth best script of the year feels like a relief after a long period that has included so many serious discussions, debates, and arguments.\n\nI don’t have an Oscar ballot (though, as always, I invite the Academy to look into this oversight and include me in their process moving forward) but that doesn’t stop me from putting together a fake ballot every year. You’ll find said ballot for 2020 to below, with my five (or ten) nominees for each of the eight “big” awards (my winner in bold), as well as the movies and performances that just missed the top five and a few more good choices just for good measure. I *think* I have seen most of the 2020 contenders, with the notable exceptions of Supernova and The Father, both of which I intend to get to before the actual ceremony arrives.\n\nBEST ACTOR BALLOT\n\nRiz Ahmed, Sound of Metal\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir, One Night in Miami\n\nDelroy Lindo, Da 5 Bloods\n\nGary Oldman, Mank\n\nSteven Yeun, Minari\n\nAhmed gave a remarkably vulnerable performance in a beautiful, challenging film. Ben-Adir was, for me, the best on screen presence in an outstanding ensemble. Oldman not only gave the kind of performance we expect from him every time out but also seemed to be having fun which was kind of strange but also delightful. And Yeun turned in one of the least showy but most powerful portrayals in recent memory. Any of them could take home the hardware. I’m sticking with Lindo, the first “sit up and take notice” performer of the year and the one that has stuck with me the most memorably. He’s the heart and soul of a very good, important film that’s gotten a bit lost in the shuffle.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nChadwick Boseman, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nLakeith Stanfield, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nThis is where I’m most likely to look foolish when the actual Academy Awards ceremony takes place. Boseman is, I think, the odds-on favorite to win the award, let alone be nominated. And I get it, he’s great in the movie and deserving of adoration. I just happen to think there are five better performances, personally. I also find it a little weird that he’s being run as the lead in what I felt like was a pretty balanced ensemble. Stanfield, too, is caught in the numbers crunch here, although I feel quite confident he’ll hear his name called on Oscar Sunday in the not too distance future.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nPaul Bettany, Uncle Frank\n\nAdarsh Gourav, The White Tiger\n\nTom Hanks, News of the World\n\nTahar Rahim, The Mauritanian\n\nAndy Samberg, Palm Springs\n\nBEST ACTRESS BALLOT\n\nAndra Day, The United States vs Billie Holliday\n\nYeri Han, Minari\n\nFrances McDormand, Nomadland\n\nElisabeth Moss, The Invisible Man\n\nCarey Mulligan, Promising Young Woman\n\nDay drags a bad movie, kicking and screaming, uphill toward relative decency. The movie doesn’t deserve her greatness, honestly. I’m no horror movie expert but The Invisible Man is one of the best genre works of the last ten years and much of it relies on Moss’ consistent excellence. Han is the perfect complement to Steven Yeun with the two combining to give Minari its beautiful balance. When I saw Nomadland, I was completely confident that I had seen the best acting performance of the year and that McDormand would take home another well-deserved Oscar trophy. But I am still thinking about Mulligan’s work in Promising Young Woman. She’s electric and her portrayal sticks with you for days on end.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nViola Davis, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nVanessa Kirby, Pieces of a Woman\n\nOf the two, Kirby is a step closer to inching into the top five despite how much I love Davis. Pieces of a Woman isn’t a great movie, but Kirby is by far the high note. As with Boseman, I think Davis’ candidacy suffers a bit from Ma Rainey’s ensemble feel but she, too, is fantastic as always.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nRashida Jones, On the Rocks\n\nCristin Milioti, Palm Springs\n\nRosamund Pike, I Care A Lot\n\nKate Winslet, Ammonite\n\nZendaya, Malcolm & Marie\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR BALLOT\n\nChadwick Boseman, Da 5 Bloods\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nBill Murray, On the Rocks\n\nLeslie Odom Jr., One Night in Miami\n\nPaul Raci, Sound of Metal\n\nSupporting Actor is always the toughest category to wade through for me and this year is no different, though I think there is a very clear line of demarcation between the top spot and the rest of the field. Not only do I think Da 5 Bloods is a (significantly) better movie than Ma Rainey’s, I think Boseman’s performance in it is better as well. Odom’s embodies the grace of Sam Cooke beautifully and pairs well with Ben-Adir’s Malcolm X. Raci’s understated, quiet work provides so much depth to Sound of Metal and his breakdown scene is one of the best of the year. And I have Murray clumped together with about 20 other “good not great performances” and my personal code dictates that ties go Bill Murray. Them’s the rules. None of this matters, though, because Kaluuya delivered what is for me the best performance, male or female, lead or supporting, of 2020 and I will be furious if he doesn’t take home the award.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nDavid Strathairn, Nomadland\n\nThe Cast of Trial of the Chicago 7 (Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Sascha Baron Coen, Frank Langella, Michael Keaton, Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance, et al)\n\nStrathairn is probably going to get a nomination and he deserves it, he’s very good in Nomadland. All of the actors in Chicago 7 are excellent and none of them do quite enough to separate themselves from the rest for me. SBC is probably going to get a nomination and that’s fine. If I had to pick one to put on my ballot in place of Murray (which you cannot make me do so don’t try), I’d probably go with Rylance.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nBo Burnham, Promising Young Woman\n\nCharles Dance, Mank\n\nAldis Hodge, One Night in Miami\n\nAlan S. Kim, Minari\n\nPeter MacDissi, Uncle Frank\n\nJonathan Majors, Da 5 Bloods\n\nJK Simmons, Palm Springs\n\nGlynn Turman, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS BALLOT\n\nDominique Fishback, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nJodie Foster, The Mauritanian\n\nYuh Jung Youn, Minari\n\nAmanda Seyfried, Mank\n\nSwankie, Nomadland\n\nFishback got overshadowed by Kaluuya, Stanfield, and Jesse Plemons but it’s her quiet strength through the course of Judas that allows for its most impactful scene which she crushes. I didn’t love The Mauritanian, but Foster elevates the material quite well. I confess, I just think Swankie is cool and the realism she and her cohorts add to Nomadland deserves attention. Much like McDormand in Nomadland, I thought I was watching the Oscar winner when I saw Seyfried in Mank and if she ultimately ends up the winner, it’s well-deserved. But I adored Yuh Jung Youn and I thought she brought so much to the screen in an organic way that fit Minari so perfectly. I would like her to be my grandma, please.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nMargot Martindale, Uncle Frank\n\nNot the best year for Supporting Actress contenders but if Character Actress Margot Martindale is in a movie, there’s a good chance I’m going to love her. So. Here we are.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nCandice Bergen, Let Them All Talk\n\nEllen Burstyn, Pieces of a Woman\n\nPriyanka Chopra Jones, The White Tiger\n\nGlenn Close, Hillbilly Elegy\n\nOlivia Cooke, Sound of Metal\n\nSaoirse Ronan, Ammonite\n\nHelena Zengel, News of the World\n\nBEST DIRECTOR BALLOT\n\nLee Isaac Chung, Minari\n\nDavid Fincher, Mank\n\nRegina King, One Night in Miami\n\nSpike Lee, Da 5 Bloods\n\nChloe Zhao, Nomadland\n\nThis is, by far, the toughest category to sort through for me. I think all five of the nominees above (and at least a few more below) have great cases to be made for winning and I don’t think I’ll be bothered by any of them taking home the trophy. I’m taking Chung because (spoiler alert) I think Minari is the best movie of the year, so I guess that’s the tie breaker? This is terrible analysis, I know, and I apologize. They’re all great.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nEmerald Fennell, Promising Young Woman\n\nPete Docter, Soul\n\nI think Fennell has a shot at cracking into the actual nominees as both Fincher and Lee have been hit or miss on the award circuit. Docter deserves way more attention than he’s getting for Soul and I place the blame for that squarely on the awards bias against animated films.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nSofia Coppola, On the Rocks\n\nPaul Greengrass, News of the World\n\nDarius Marder, Sound of Metal\n\nAaron Sorkin, Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nLeigh Whannell, The Invisible Man\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY BALLOT\n\nMinari\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nPalm Springs\n\nSoul\n\nTrial of the Chicago 7\n\nThe buzz on Chicago 7 is all over the place. Some have it as a front runner in several categories, some think it’s overrated junk. For me, it’s two biggest strengths are the depth of the ensemble and the script. I think the script, like all Sorkin films, sings so it takes the top spot for me. Soul is perhaps an uncommon pick here but I think the structure of that movie is exquisite so I’m rolling with it. Promising Young Woman relies maybe a tad too much on its final twist but even still, it’s a pretty phenomenal product. I might be doing the “token nomination” thing with Palm Springs but I truly love the new take on an old trope bit that the movie pulls off and I want to reward its quality. Minari probably comes closest to taking the win from Chicago 7 but at the end of the day I’m falling for the exquisite showiness of Sorking being Sorkin. Sue me.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nDa 5 Bloods\n\nMank\n\nI can’t say that either of these scripts are the best that Lee and Fincher, respectively, have ever worked with but they’re both good to very good and both do a lot of work for their films structurally.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nI Care A Lot\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nLove & Monsters\n\nMalcolm & Marie\n\nOn the Rocks\n\nOnward\n\nSound of Metal\n\nTenet\n\nUncle Frank\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY BALLOT\n\nThe Invisible Man\n\nNews of the World\n\nNomadland\n\nOne Night in Miami\n\nThe White Tiger\n\nI’d draw a line between News of the World and the rest of this field in terms of quality. It’s a good script but not great and I think quite a bit lesser than the others. White Tiger was a late arrival for me, and I was very impressed with the film’s highs even if there were some noticeable lows. I remain steadfastly impressed with Invisible and while Moss is the BIGGEST reason that movie succeeds, the script and direction (both by Leigh Whannell) deserve a lot of credit. It is incredibly hard to take a stage production and adapt it to the screen and even more difficult, I think, to adapt your own stage production. That’s just what Kemp Powers did, and I think he gave Regina King a fantastic canvas to work from. I lean slightly toward Chloe Zhao and Nomadland here, however, because of how well the film subverts expectation and avoids the tropes you might think it would be rife with.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nMa Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nI have a hard time with movies that feel like plays. This may be a personal preference thing but it’s difficult for me to stay “in” the movie in these cases. That’s where Ma Rainey suffers for me, despite its obvious strengths.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nAmerican Pickle\n\nFirst Cow\n\nMidnight Sky\n\nPieces of a Woman\n\nBEST PICTURE BALLOT\n\nDa 5 Bloods\n\nThe Invisible Man\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nMank\n\nMinari\n\nNomadland\n\nOne Night in Miami\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nSound of Metal\n\nSoul\n\nI think there are good cases to be made for each of these films and that speaks mostly to their overall respective quality and a little to the lack of a truly GREAT film in the lot. That’s okay, that happens in a lot of non-pandemic years, too! For me, this comes down to Da 5 Bloods, Minari, and Nomadland. I spoke at length about all of them on our episodes (not to mention within this piece) and all three films accomplish their goals beautifully. I think perhaps Minari has the highest degree of difficulty among the three and handles each of its components the best so it gets the win for me but, truly, I think it’s splitting hairs to choose between these three.\n\nSHORTLIST\n\nPalm Springs\n\nTrial of the Chicago 7\n\nIn terms of re-watchability, Palm Springs is the top film in this group for me and, again, I just love the way that film dove head first into very well charted waters and carved out its own space based solely on charm. Chicago tells its story exceedingly well and has maybe the best ensemble of the year but feels a tiny bit flat compared to some of its contemporaries.\n\nLONGLIST\n\nNews of the World\n\nOnward\n\nUncle Frank\n\nSome years ago, I realized that I wasn’t reading much. Like, I was big time not reading much. I wanted to change that so I started reading much. (Terrible sentences, I know.) And, as is my nature, once I was reading much (I’m just going with it now, I’m sorry), I continued to read much. 2020 was, I believe, the third year in a row in which I completed 52 books. The vast majority of them were consumed through the audiobook format but reading is reading no matter how you do the reading in my book. As much as I like reading, I like making lists even more so here is my list of all 52 of my 2020 reads ranked from worst to first. Two of the books are combined because they are part of the same series and I read them back-to-back (and they’re of about the same general quality) and one of my reads, “Ready Player One”, is not included herein because I have read it several times.\n\n50. Alice Isn’t Dead - Joseph Fink (Audiobook)\n\nOne of the first books I read this year and the only one I’d mark down as actually a bad book. The best thing I can say about “Alice” is it’s short. Otherwise, my “never quit in the middle of a book” policy would’ve been put to the test.\n\n49. Of Dice and Men - David M. Ewalt (Audiobook)\n\nI enjoyed the parts of this book that concerned the history of Dungeons and Dragons and its creators. Less so the parts concerning Ewalt’s own on and off history of playing the game. I generally appreciate an author tying his or her own story to the subject matter in a book or article but felt that element fell flat here.\n\n48. Console Wars - Blake J. Harris (eBook)\n\nHarris’ tome on the battle between Nintendo and Sega in the 80’s and 90’s was well-sourced and thorough. Unfortunately, it was also incredibly droll. I’m not a prolific reader of business-related books but “Console” in particular was laborious to get through in parts and dragged on and on too often.\n\n47. What Should Be Wild - Julia Fine (Audiobook)\n\nIt turns out that I read several modern fairy tale-esque books in 2020, although I certainly didn’t set out to do so. The set up for “Wild” was decent and then there was a solid two-hour listening stretch in which I thought the book really found its groove but ultimately it settled back into “this is fine” territory and became mostly forgettable.\n\n46. Solar War and Lost Colony - Albert G. Riddle (Audiobooks)\n\nI read these books back to back, having read the first in the series (“Winter World”) near the end of 2019. Ultimately, I felt the first book was much better than the follow ups and that Riddle ran out of steam on his story early in “Lost Colony.” This pair was enjoyable enough but I think the trilogy as a whole would’ve been better served as one well-edited book instead of a series.\n\n45. How to Defeat a Demon Knight - Andrew Rowe (Audiobook)\n\nThe first (of several!) free Audible titles that were added through the course of the year, “Demon Knight” had a fun concept that lost my interest somewhere in the second act. I think it was somewhat stuck between a children’s book and a YA book and ultimately needed to pick a lane. Still, it was fun enough and I’d be interested in Rowe’s future works.\n\n44. Nut Jobs - Marc Fennell (Audiobook)\n\nA big feature in the free title section of Audible is a large collection of true crime books. I’m not big on Murder Books revolving around grisly deaths but I do love a good heist story which accounts for a handful of entries on this list. “Nut” involves the theft of, you guessed it, trucks full of freshly harvested nuts and it made for a fun, albeit too light, read.\n\n43. Sisters - Dervla McTiernan (Audiobook)\n\nThe weakest of the three McTiernan’s I read this year, “Sisters” is a fine add-on short read to the more substantial stories of Cormac Reilly, McTiernan’s Irish detective. This one BARELY qualifies as a book given its short length but I listened to it back to back with an even shorter book in this series that I didn’t add to my list so I feel like the two combined equal one book. Sue me.\n\n42. Terminus - Peter Clines (Audiobook)\n\nClines is not super consistent but he is quite prolific and I like the semi-connected world he’s created with the Threshold Universe, even when they are often uneven. “Terminus” is, I think, probably the worst of the series thus far but it had some strong moments and some solid characters that made it easy to stick with.\n\n41. Nothing More Dangerous - Allen Eskens (Audiobook)\n\nI read Eskens’ breakout book “The Life We Bury” a couple years ago and liked it quite a bit. “Nothing” is a more relevant, significant story but a lesser book overall, I think, but it is apparently a book he’s had on the backburner for years and I respect that he went back to write it before carrying on with the series he launched with “Bury.”\n\n40. Heist - Jeff Diament (Audiobook)\n\nAnother heist book from Audible, this one involved a semi-famous Loomis Fargo theft in the 90’s by a group of very dumb criminals. This book was adapted as Masterminds, a movie with Zack Galifianakis and Kristen Wiig that no one saw (and rightly so). The biggest take away from this book is how easy it would’ve been for this crew to pull this off had they only been smart enough to just keep their mouths shut. When I pull my heist, no one will ever catc- I’ve already said too much. Disregard.\n\n39. The Big Heist - Anthony DeStefano (Audiobook)\n\nOh wow, another heist book! This one concerns the Lufthansa heist of 1978 perpetrated by members of the New York City branch of the mob. If you’ve seen Goodfellas, this is a key part of the plot and much of the information regarding this story comes from Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the central figure in the film. It’s a very well-researched and sourced book but it also dragged far more than I expected for an eight-hour read about a mob heist. I thought DeStefano perhaps went too long on some of the ancillary details and could’ve streamlined it a bit more.\n\n38. Billion Dollar Fantasy - Albert Chen (Audiobook)\n\nI think my fantasy football days are over but I have spent a ton of time playing fantasy sports over the years. “Billion Dollar” focused on the rise of daily fantasy sports and the companies, like Draft Kings and Fanduel, that brought the game to the forefront. Nothing spectacular but an easy, enjoyable read overall.\n\n37. Super Mario - Jeff Ryan (Audiobook)\n\nA much less comprehensive, but much less tedious, read than “The Console Wars.” This one focused more on Mario the character and the games he’s featured in than on the entire history of Nintendo and I think that targeting helped the writing as well as my own listening/reading.\n\n36. The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet - Becky Chambers (Audiobook)\n\nThere are some real Firefly/Serenity vibes to this book and I think Chambers created some fun characters and settings. The issue for me was the plotting which dragged heavily in places and tried my patience more than I would’ve expected from an accessible work of science fiction like this is. “Angry Planet” is a 14-hour book that I probably would’ve wanted to be ten hours. I think that will ultimately hold me back from continuing the series which is a bummer given that, again, I really dug the universe and the characters therein.\n\n35. Ready Player Two - Ernest Cline (Audiobook)\n\n“Ready Player One” is one of my favorite books if not my actual favorite. I’ve re-read it a few times and always thoroughly enjoy the read while I understand why it doesn’t work for some. I expected “RP2” to be a letdown in comparison and tempered my expectations before reading but was still mildly disappointed. I think the book is fine and will make a good movie but I can’t say I’m excited to re-read this one anytime soon.\n\n34. The Scholar - Dervla McTiernan (Audiobook)\n\n“The Scholar” is a bit of a drop off from the first Cormac Reilly book in this series (see below) but still had an interesting premise with solid execution. I really like the reader of these books (Aoife McMahon) and I think her voice adds something to the overall experience.\n\n33. Polar Vortex - Matthew Mather (Audiobook)\n\nCan I confess to you, dear reader, that I am very interested in plane disappearances? I’m pretty sure that’s the main reason why I picked this one up. I thought this was going to be more dime store sci-fi than the mystery/survival fare it turned out to be. But still, it was a light, harmless read that held my attention in some places and sank into the background of my office hours in others. Obviously if you’re as interested in plane disappearances as I am, you stopped reading after you saw “plane disappearances” in the first sentence and have already begun reading this one. I get it.\n\n32. Movies (and Other Things) - Shea Serrano (Book)\n\nI love Serrano’s writing style and I have enjoyed his previous books, “The Rap Year Book” and “Basketball (and Other Things)” quite a bit. In fact, “The Rap Year Book” was my number one favorite read of 2017. This one, though, didn’t hit the mark for me quite as much as his previous efforts. I think it came down to the fact that our movie tastes do not align very often and I found myself gritting my teeth through his praise of movies I think are terrible. I’m sure he would say the same about my movie tastes if I were to ever publish a book.\n\n31. Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore - Robin Sloan (eBook)\n\nThis is another book that I thought was going to be a bit more sci-fi than it turned out to be but still enjoyed nonetheless. It’s a bit bumpy; in fact, I think I recommended this to a friend when I was about half-way through the book then retracted my recommendation as I continued to read then ultimately re-instated said recommendation. So, in essence, I quite enjoyed the first and third act and struggled with the second.\n\n30. Moon Over Soho - Ben Aaronovitch (Audiobook)\n\nI read the first book in this series (“Rivers of London”) last year on the recommendation of a like-minded friend and enjoyed it quite a bit. Then I moved away from the series and forgot about it until that same friend mentioned the series again, at which point I read this book and once again quite enjoyed it. This series (much like “The Invisible Library” below) scratches the Neil Gaiman itch even if they are much more pulpy and less Literary with a capital L. It’s all magic and jazz and the seedy streets of London and I look forward to (apparently) reading one a year but no more than one a year for the rest of my life.\n\n29. Force of Nature - Jane Harper (Audiobook)\n\nI’m not a mystery reader but a few mystery titles find their way into my eyes or ears each year, usually when I’m looking for a semi-short, easy read coming off of a longer/more serious piece of nonfiction. Such was the case with “Force of Nature”, which I read right after completing “How to Be an Anti-Racist” (see below). The book served as a pleasant and much needed decompression. I’d say it’s a bit lesser than the first book in the series, “The Dry”, which I read a year or two ago, but I like Harper’s style and find the reader’s voice (Stephen Shanahan) to be soothing.\n\n28. The Lesson - Cadwell Turnball (eBook)\n\n“The Lesson” is set primarily in the Virgin Islands a few years after an alien occupation that seems peaceful to the outside world but which the locals know to be much more dangerous. Turnball took a very interesting, nontraditional look at alien invasion and worked in subplots regarding systemic racism and slavery quite well. I really, really loved this book for a while but at a certain point it sort of lost the plot for me and it didn’t think it stuck the landing. But Turnball is a name I’ll be watching in the future.\n\n27. How the Internet Happened - Brian McCullough (Audiobook)\n\nThere are some non-fiction subjects about which I want the full story on every branch of the tree. I’ll read just about any book on basketball, for instance, and the more focused the story is, the better (see below at least three times). On some subjects, however, a broad strokes approach is preferred, as is the case here. I’m sure there are superior tomes concerning every tiny corner of the first decade of the internet’s existence but “How the Internet Happened” did a good job of hitting all the high notes, some of which I knew and some I didn’t, without ever bogging down too much on any one person, website, or trend. It’s a solid read if you want “The Internet 101” course.\n\n26. Victory Machine - Ethan Sherwood Strauss (Audiobook)\n\nAs mentioned above, I am a very willing reader of virtually any basketball book that hits the market. “Victory Machine” was the least of those reads this year but still brought forth quality information about a team (the 2015-2020 Golden State Warriors) that dominated the NBA and much of the media coverage surrounding the league. There wasn’t a ton of stuff I didn’t know coming in but I dug Strauss’ inside man look into the inner workings of a dynasty.\n\n25. The Ruin - Dervla McTiernan (Audiobook)\n\nThe first of McTiernan’s Cormac Reilly series is also the best of the bunch so far. Again, mysteries aren’t really my favorite genre but this series in particular hit the mark for me and held my attention throughout. Reilly is a solid character and McTiernan uses him quite well. The follow ups were a bit weaker in my mind than “The Ruin” (as you can see above) but I’ve already got the next in the series queued up for an early 2021 reading and expect to go back to the well as long as McTiernan wants to keep the ball rolling.\n\n24. The Invisible Library - Genevieve Cogman (Audiobook)\n\nA recommendation from a friend, “Library” is light fantasy with a well-thought out world and a compelling protagonist. I like series’ like this that are fun and engaging but that don’t require me to immediately run out and read the next book in the series. I’ll step back into this universe at some point this year but I don’t think I’ll need a refresher on the events herein and I appreciate that simplicity.\n\n23. The Adventurer’s Son - Roman Dial (Audiobook)\n\nDefinitely not a fun read, “The Adventurer’s Son” chronicles the author’s quest to find his missing son. As the book goes on, it begins to feel less and less likely that he will be found alive and the narrative becomes more about closure than anything else. I thought the actual writing was only so-so but I greatly appreciated the story told and the importance of the book to Dial. Without spoiling the book, I’ll say that at some point I realized I needed this story to have an ending, even a sad ending, and was thankful that ultimately there was a definitive conclusion.\n\n22. Devolution - Max Brooks (Audiobook)\n\nBrooks’ last book, “World War Z”, is a favorite of mine and I really love the way Brooks uses the oral history medium to tell a fictional story. “Devolution” revolves around Big Foot instead of a zombie outbreak and while I don’t think it’s anywhere near as refined as the previous effort, it was a fun read and the audiobook made great use of a full voice cast.\n\n21. Black Planet - David Shields (Book)\n\nThis is probably the most obscure read on my list this year; I’m not even sure if the book is still in print. A friend of mine recommended “Black Planet” and loaned me the book based on our shared infatuation with the mid-90’s Seattle Supersonics. This is less a sports book, though, and more a cultural ponderance mixed with a memoir (which is one of the more pretentious sentences I’ve ever written, sorry). Shields’ research-based approach to things we don’t typically look at scientifically was very interesting.\n\n20. Range - David Epstein (Audiobook)\n\nOne of the first books I finished in 2020, “Range” stuck with me for the bulk of the year, standing out as one of my more unique reads in a sea of sci-fi, basketball, and fantasy. Epstein has a very strong writing voice and his curiosity about the subject (how developing a well-rounded skill set during our developmental years is often much better than focusing on one thing at an early age) came through in the reporting, which gave the book much more life than I expected.\n\n19. Call of the Wild - Jack London (Audiobook)\n\nI’ve read this one before but it had been many, many years and I didn’t remember much of the story so we’re counting it as a new read, which took place the week before the movie came out in February (remember movies?). “White Fang” may be London’s best work but “Call of the Wild” is, to me, his most important work and the one that best captures the spirit of adventure and the allure and beauty of the natural world.\n\n18. The Ickabog - JK Rowling (Audiobook)\n\nI’ve not enjoyed Rowling outside the “Harry Potter” books but “The Ickabog” was a nice, pleasant return to form. Occupying the middle of the three modern fairy tales I read in 2020 (“What Should Be Wild” above and “Echo” below), “Ickabog” reads like a slightly more mature version of “The BFG” with interesting young characters and an excellent narration done by Stephen Fry.\n\n17. The Warehouse - Rob Hart (Audiobook)\n\nLast year I read a book called “FKA USA” that revolved around the evils of a big bad company that was a stand-in for Amazon, Facebook, etc. It was not very good and got muddled in its attempts to worldbuild to an extreme level around a subject matter that was already very familiar. Hart’s narrative was much closer to our current reality which made the events of the book feel more significant and grounded. I liked its dual-narration set up and seeing the two main characters move toward each other through the story from opposite ends was quite engrossing.\n\n16. Good Omens - Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (Audiobook)\n\nFriends, readers of this space, and listeners of my podcast alike know of my love for Neil Gaiman but I hadn’t worked my way through his entire bibliography until 2020 when I knocked out the remainder of his books, beginning with “Good Omens.” This was a very fun read and I was very impressed with the way Gaiman and Pratchett handled controversial material. The audiobook featured an excellent reader, too, (Martin Jarvis) which always helps. I’ve heard the TV adaptation with Michael Sheen and David Tennant is very good as well but I probably will never watch it because Michael Sheen has a very punchable face and it dominates my every thought when I see him on screen.\n\n15. Where the Crawdads Sing - Delia Owens (Audiobook)\n\nI missed the boat on this one in 2018 when literally everyone in the known world read it but ultimately I found it to be a great read with a compelling, sympathetic protagonist. There were parts of the non-linear storytelling I liked more than others but all told, I think it all came together quite beautifully. And, while obviously I won’t spoil the ending here in case you’re the one person in my circle who hasn’t yet read the book yourself, the last chapter of the book propelled “Crawdads” from a good book I enjoyed to a very good book I couldn’t forget.\n\n14. Tanking to the Top - Yaron Weitzman (Audiobook)\n\nI’ve mentioned previously my love for sports books and basketball books in particular. This one, concerning the Philadelphia 76ers and their quest over the last decade to be as bad as possible in order to eventually become good, was one of the more well-reported I’ve read in the genre in quite some time. I enjoyed reading “Victory Machine” (see above), there wasn’t too much in the book that was new or previously unknown to me. “Tanking”, though, was rife with inside information and interviews I hadn’t heard before and Weitzman did an excellent job of putting it all together into an insightful, engrossing read.\n\n13. Dune - Frank Herbert (Audiobook)\n\nIn the 9th grade, I picked this book for a research paper and presentation in my English class. No matter how I tried, I could not get through the first 100 pages and ultimately, I had to switch to a different book (and also, let’s be real, I was lazy and I had read “Brave New World” previously and knew I could write the paper easily; the teacher never should’ve let me get away with this, frankly). Since then, I have picked up and attempted to dig into “Dune” at least three more times, all efforts that met the same failure. It’s so dense, y’all. But with the movie adaptation supposed to make its way into theaters this fall (RIP), I finally forced myself to get through it in preparation. It’s very good! I have no idea if it is even remotely filmable but the book itself is good and I understand its acclaim even if it was a struggle, in parts, to get through. I highly recommend the audiobook; it helped me tremendously and the full cast approach served the material quite well.\n\n12. The Sandman - Neil Gaiman (Audiobook)\n\nPreviously Unread Gaiman Number Two of Three on my list, I’ve looked into the “Sandman” graphic novels previously but never had the opportunity to dig in. In the middle of 2020, Audible put together an exclusive collection of some of the series into audio form with a full cast (featuring James McAvoy as The Sandman) and I truly love the format so much. It has a radio play vibe, complete with a short theme song-like intro for each comic in the series (ten in total) and it fit this series so well. My complaints with this book are, number one, that at least one of the stories herein was so dark as to become uncomfortable to listen to, and number two, because of the nature of the project, it doesn’t really have an ending and the last story in the collection is probably the worst of the bunch so it leaves you on a semi-sour note. But overall I was so impressed with the production value and the way the stories lended themselves to this medium and I can’t wait to listen to volume two in the future.\n\n11. Twilight of the Gods - Steven Hayden (eBook)\n\nHayden’s last book, “Your Favorite Band is Killing Me”, is one of my all-time favorites. He’s one of the best voices on rock ‘n roll going right now and I dig the way in which he interjects personal history and anecdotes into his reporting. “Twilight” focuses on the creation and subsequent radio domination of the classic rock genre with Hayden digging into the rock legends of the 60’s and 70’s and how classic rock has progressed (or stagnated) over the decades. I thought he did a great job of working through some of the bigger issues with the genre as a whole (particularly its lack of racial diversity and the sordid history of some of the bigger names in rock) while also appreciating the music for what it was and is.\n\n10. Raised in Captivity - Chuck Klosterman (Audiobook)\n\nI’m in the bag for anything Klosterman writes but I like him best in essay and short story form. This collection of shorts showed off his range tremendously but also really highlighted his strange sense of humor which I adore. If I have a criticism, it’s that the first story, about an eccentric high school football coach whose players go on to tremendous success in a variety of fields, is one of the best things Klosterman has ever written and thus the rest of the book is never quite able to live up to the collection’s intro.\n\n9. Warbreaker - Brandon Sanderson (Audiobook)\n\nI’ve heard great things about Sanderson’s works of sci-fi and fantasy over the years but to be honest, I’m often hesitant to jump into a series like this, despite how much I typically enjoy the genres, because I know it will take up so much of my reading time. “Warbreaker” was a selection in one of Audible’s sales last year and it was billed as somewhat of a standalone within Sanderson’s universe. That is true, it is a book that you can read without any knowledge of the universe but “unfortunately” I enjoyed it so much that I’m definitely going to be digging into more of Sanderson’s work in the coming months. “Warbreaker” includes some of the best worldbuilding I’ve seen in a while and compelling characters.\n\n8. The Office Oral History - Andy Greene (Book)\n\nI love “The Office” and I love a good oral history so this one was right up my alley. Greene covered everything from the inception of the show to the series finale through interviews with everyone from Steve Carell to the cameramen. Sometimes the mistake in an oral history is including too much but Greene and his editors did an excellent job of making sure this book was thorough but well-paced. I also loved the structural idea of inserting shorter chapters covering some of the most memorable episodes of the show in between the longer chapters covering each season and key events in the show’s history.\n\n7. Three Ring Circus - Jeff Pearlman (Audiobook)\n\nI wasn’t totally sure I was going to read “Circus”, which covers the LA Lakers in the Shaq-Kobe era from 1995 to 2005, despite my obvious connection to the material and the fact that Pearlman is one of the best authors in the genre. Like a lot of people, I get Laker Fatigue very easily and to be honest, I wasn’t sure the book would shed much light on a decade of basketball I am already very familiar with. But the book generated a ton of buzz and ultimately I gave in to my basketball jonesin’ instincts and I’m glad I did. Pearlman got interviews with virtually everyone even remotely connected to this team and unearthed a number of anecdotes and pieces of information I’d never heard previously. He also didn’t pull any punches on either side of the Kobe-Shaq divide but even still, the book never drifted into what I would consider salacious or agenda-based reporting. It was a great read and one I’ll probably revisit a few years down the line. One note, however. If you choose to pick up “Circus”, do so in book or eBook form. The narrator of the audiobook, whose name I won’t mention here, had no idea how to pronounce names, which is a pretty big deal for a non-fiction book featuring hundreds of names of real life actual human beings. For a while I blew off the insanely bad pronunciations but at a certain point it got so bad I started to wonder if the reader was doing a bit because there’s no possible way anyone actually thought these were the proper pronunciations. Book or eBook only, I beg of you.\n\n6. Anansi Boys - Neil Gaiman (Audiobook)\n\nThe final hole in my Gaiman awareness (minus some short stories that I plan to get through early this year), “Anansi Boys” was everything I wanted it to be and more. While not nearly as expansive as “American Gods” or “Neverwhere”, the story herein is rich and the characters are wonderful. Gaiman is so good at creating immersive, complex settings and narratives without sacrificing levity or drowning the story in the pretension that sometimes accompanies works of fantasy. Great read and one that might serve as an excellent entry point for anyone new to Gaiman’s works.\n\n5. The Big Picture: The Fight For the Future of Movies - Ben Fritz (Audiobook)\n\nI hesitated to read this one when it debuted in 2018 because I knew much of Fritz’s reporting came from culling through the files from the infamous Sony hack in 2014 and that whole thing makes me uncomfortable. But the book kept coming up, so much so that I felt like I actually needed to read it in order to better understand the movie industry I spend so much time discussing. I give Fritz a lot of credit for his approach to the research and the writing of the book and I think he handled this subject matter as ethically as possible. “The Big Picture” provides tremendous insight into Hollywood and the film business as it stands now and, more importantly, where it’s headed.\n\n4. The Cold Vanish - Jon Billman (Audiobook)\n\nTruthfully, I liked “The Adventurer’s Son” (see above) quite a bit more before I read “The Cold Vanish.” These books occupy a similar space and in some ways they compliment each other. But whereas “Son” focuses entirely on one man’s quest (and rightly so), Billman’s book takes a wider look at a plethora of missing persons and adventures gone wrong as well as the psychology of exploration and the ways in which the natural world calls out to some individuals more than others. I hold Jon Krakauer (“Into the Wild”, “Into Thin Air”) in the highest esteem so when I say that in “Vanish” Billman channeled Krakauer, know that I mean that as a tremendous compliment. This book stuck with me long after I finished reading it and, like the best of Krakauer, I expect I’ll come back to read it again in the future.\n\n3. How to Be an Anti-Racist - Ibram X. Kendi (Audiobook)\n\nI’m not big on telling people they “need” to read a given book or more from a certain genre or whatever else. Life is hard and busy and if you read for educational purposes, great, and if you read for leisure, great, and if you read for escapism, great, I don’t care, good on you for finding the time to read, period. If I could break my own rule for just a second, however, I think this is a book that everyone actually needs to read. It’s tough and hard and challenging and difficult to get through in places but it is also necessary and remarkably well-written. This is certainly not the most enjoyable book I read this year but it is probably the best book I read and certainly the most important.\n\n2. The Cost of These Dreams - Wright Thompson (Audiobook)\n\nThompson is one of my absolute favorite authors, a man whose writing voice and speaking voice alike seem custom built to appeal to Brian Gill. He has written some of the more memorable essays and longform articles I’ve read over the last decade and I always look forward to his name appearing on the byline. “The Cost of These Dreams” is a bit of a cheat on a list like this in that it’s a collection of some of his better pieces from over the years but I don’t care, it’s my list and I was, as always with Thompson, deeply affected by his writing. All of the stories here are related to, you guessed it, the costs associated with striving toward a goal. Michael Jordan looking back on his life at age 50, a basketball player who went missing while hanging on to the remnants of his career in the Brazilian league, the fight against racism at Ole Miss, etc. etc. It’s an exquisite collection of pieces and Thompson’s narration for the audiobook only heightens their impact. In the middle of quarantine, I found myself sobbing into a basket of clean laundry as I listened to the piece on Jordan which I had read AT LEAST TWICE BEFORE. Maybe that says something about my mental state in the year of our Lord 2020 but it also says something about the power of Thompson’s words.\n\n1. Echo - Pam Munoz Ryan (Audiobook)\n\nA Newbery award winner in 2015, I’d not heard of “Echo” until it popped up in an Audible sale and piqued my interest and it instantly became an all-time favorite and a book I’ll revisit plenty of times in the future. The story is told in three parts, each concerning a child in the midst of difficult circumstances, and the unknown connection they all share via an antique and semi-magical harmonica. Munoz Ryan handles some incredibly difficult subject matter with eloquence and grace and subtly connects her story to its relevance in today’s world because, you know, SOMEHOW WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH NAZIS. I can’t express how beautiful this book is and how moving I found the writing to be. I highly recommend the audiobook as well because of the excellent production of the reading, complete with harmonica interludes that may sound cheesy but, truly, only serve to deepen the reader’s connection to the story.\n\nHere’s your obligatory mention of how rotten 2020 was to all of us: 2020 was very bad. There were many, MANY terrible things about 2020 and a dearth of new movies is very low on that list, obviously. Since I talk and (nominally) write about movies, though, I’ve got to focus on the film side of things so I’ll just come out right off the top and say 2020 was super not fun for movie watchers. We missed out on a ton of new releases and many of those that actually did come out were released in weird ways and into a weird world. It sucked and, for myriad more important reasons outside the movie industry, I hope that soon things are significantly better.\n\nWith all that said, I still saw a lot of movies in 2020 even if the vast majority of them were viewed in my office rather than a very large theater screen. (As of this writing, my wife has not yet agreed to turn the dining room into a theater room but we’ll see who has the last word in this conversation.) And, believe it or not, I saw a lot of good movies in 2020! Typically, my end of year list sits somewhere between 100 and 120 films and, since I’m actually a relatively generous grader, I usually have bunches of movies in contention for my top ten of the year. In 2020, I “only” got through 85 or so and, while I still handed out positive grades to the majority of them, it’s clear that the quality of the film product this year was lacking. Too many movies were bumped into 2021, too many of the ones that did drop were disappointing. Even still, there were ten films that didn’t make my top ten that I really dug and deserved to be highlighted. So, that’s what I’ve done below.\n\nNow, listen, usually my lists feature what I would consider to be a good mix of big, mainstream movies and smaller indies. This year, though, well...we didn’t have many big, mainstream movies, resulting in a top twenty list that includes a lot of smaller films, many of which you may never have heard of. Normally, I grumble a bit at end of year lists that are so heavy on obscure, tiny movies as to be almost completely irrelevant. I hope that, given the circumstances of 2020, you will forgive my indie-heavy sensibilities herein and possibly even check out a movie or two from the list below. There were some great hidden gems in the midst of the dumpster fire that was 2020.\n\nFor my actual top ten list, tune into Mad About Movies this week as we delve into our annual top ten and worst ten of the year episode.\n\nOn the Rocks (Rashida Jones, Bill Murray, Marlon Wayans)\n\nSummary: When a woman (Jones) suspects her husband (Wayans) of cheating, she calls in her wayward father (Murray) for assistance.\n\nOne of the few on this list that I was actually looking forward to ahead of time, Sofia Coppola’s reunion with my beloved Bill Murray did not disappoint. Jones, who I think is one of the more underutilized women in the industry, gave such a terrific portrayal of the insecurities that so many formerly cool adults experience in their parenting years without letting the character become “crazy.” She’d probably be on my hypothetical Oscar ballot. And for Murray, this is somewhat of a throwback performance, a full display of his easy charm and ability to combine eccentric comedy with a grounded warmth. Available on Apple+.\n\nLove and Monsters (Dylan O’Brien, Jessica Henwick, Michael Rooker)\n\nSummary: A young loner (O’Brien) leaves his bunker and sets out to reunite with his high school sweetheart (Henwick) by traversing across an earth that has been overrun by giant insects.\n\nI fully expected this to be terrible and still kind of can’t believe how well it turned out. It’s rare to see a movie mix genre as well as Love and Monsters does and I think both director Michael Matthews and writers Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson deserve a ton of credit for pulling that off. This is equal parts funny, heartwarming, thrilling, and goofy and also there are giant bugs, some of which look like they came straight out of a 1970’s prop department. The biggest winner out of all of this, however, is O’Brien who seems to have found his path forward post-Maze Runner. Monsters recast O’Brien in my mind as someone to be taken seriously moving forward and I hope he’s able to capitalize on that promise. Available on VOD.\n\nTenet (John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki)\n\nSummary: Uh well...you know...it’s kinda hard to explain but it involves inertia and moving backward sort of in time?\n\nIt’s hard to remember all the way back to January of 2020 seeing as how this past year actually lasted for three decades. But if I squint back into the miles behind me, I think I can barely make out the shadow of massive anticipation I had for Tenet and the extended wait I went through before finally being able to see this (in theaters, no less in August). I love Christopher Nolan and this is, for better or worse, unquestionably the MOST Christopher Nolan movie of all-time. I’m not sure the plot actually makes sense but I’m also not sure I’m smart enough to figure it out even if it does make complete sense. And yet...I enjoyed it quite a bit? As I said on the podcast, if you hate this movie, I can’t really argue against you but despite the complexity and possible overall stupidity of it all, I enjoyed the thrill ride overall. It’s more than a little disappointing for me personally to have a new Nolan movie and NOT have it make my top ten and this is clearly not his best work but still, I’m okay with the movie overall. Available on VOD.\n\nSh!thouse (Cooper Raiff, Amy Landecker)\n\nSummary: A freshman (Raiff) at a college far from home struggles to figure out how to fit in and handle his first real relationship with his RA (Landecker).\n\nThis is a very small coming-of-age movie that exceeds its genre and the cliches therein through its simplicity. Basically a student film, that Raiff (who also wrote and directed the film) was able to put together a professional finished product with $15,000 is remarkable. I’ve seen dozens, if not hundreds, of movies like this over the years but Sh!thouse (which is the name of a fraternity, if you’re wondering) sticks out as one of the better entries into the genre. I think the master stroke here is the realism portrayed by Raiff who, like a lot of 18 and 19 year old kids, really wants to be an adult but doesn’t have a clue how to do that yet. The scenes in which he calls home to talk to his mother and sister are the best in the movie and provide the perfect grounding for the film as a whole. Available on VOD.\n\nJungleland (Charlie Hunnam, Jack O’Connell, Jessica Barden)\n\nSummary: A pair of brothers (Hunnam and O’Connell) transport a young, pregnant woman (Barden) across the country at the behest of a crime lord.\n\nI expected Jungleland to focus much more heavily on O’Connell’s character’s boxing/street fighting and therefore thought the movie would be a knock-off of The Fighter. Instead, it turned out to be a sobering, semi-sweet road trip movie with excellent pace. Max Winkler (son of Henry) wasn’t someone I was aware of before Jungleland but he’s now a director I’ll be watching much more closely moving forward. Similar to O’Brien with Love and Monsters, this was also an important movie for Hunnam. I think he has an interesting place in the film industry if he can figure out how to lock in on the right roles. He’s not a movie star and his range is limited but he’s very good in this and I think when he’s able to operate in his comfort zone, he can do this consistently. Available on VOD.\n\nThe Vast of Night (Sierra McCormick, Jake Horowitz)\n\nSummary: In 1950’s New Mexico, a pair of young adults (McCormick and Horowitz) hear a strange radio signal that sends them on the hunt for UFOs.\n\nThis is probably the poster child for “Movies I Likely Wouldn’t Have Seen in a Normal, Non-Pandemic Year” but in that scenario I would’ve been missing out greatly. What Andrew Patterson accomplished on a $700,000 budget should be taught in film school. This movie looks great and the vibe is Spielbergian, my highest compliment, as you know. I loved the decision to let the threat of the aliens, or even the possibility of the aliens, hover over the events of the movie, leading to an edge of your seat feel that would’ve been lost in a more straightforward sci-fi movie. A very effective, smart film overall. Available on Amazon Prime.\n\nUncle Frank (Paul Bettany, Sophia Lillies, Peter Macdissi)\n\nSummary: A New York-based college professor (Bettany) returns home to 1973 South Carolina for his father’s funeral and a family that doesn’t know about his sexuality.\n\nPaul Bettany stans, between Uncle Frank and Wandavision, this is our time! I love Bettany, provided he is not playing some sort of weird monk or disgraced angel or vampire hunter. He’s so much better than most of his filmography and I’m always pumped when he plays an actual normal human being. He’s magnificent in this film and his supporting cast, especially Macdissi and Lillies but also Steve Zahn, Margot Martindale, Stephen Root, and more, are all excellent as well. Uncle Frank handles its subject matter with equal parts realism and grace and includes one of the best scenes of the year which left me sobbing. Available on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 (Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance, Sascha Baron Cohen)\n\nSummary: Aaron Sorkin’s look at the arrest and subsequent trial of seven protestors at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\nOne of the few on this list that I was anticipating all year long, ultimately Netflix gave us the chance to see this one and it did not disappoint. Sorkin seems like he was born to write this script and his patented, speedy dialogue serves is perfectly at home in this setting and with this dynamic cast. I’m not sure anyone from this cast will receive an Oscar nomination but if we used the Screen Actors Guild awards as a guide, this would get my vote for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Redmayne, Rylance, Cohen, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Frank Langella, Jeremy Strong, and (in a surprise appearance) Michael Keaton are all exquisite and all do their part to bring along the story and highlight Sorkin’s script. Available on Netflix.\n\nNews of the World (Tom Hanks, Helena Zengel)\n\nSummary: A Civil War veteran (Hanks) who makes his living by traveling town to town and reading newspapers to the people agrees to take a young girl (Zengel) who has been raised by the Kiowa people back to her relatives.\n\nDefinitely the Dad Movie of the Year, News was one of the last movies I saw from 2020 and I went back and forth as to whether it belonged in my top ten or not. It’s impossible not to enjoy Hanks Being Hanks and Paul Greengrass’ exquisite style works much better in the western genre than I might have expected coming in. The strength of the film, however, rests on the bond between Hanks and newcomer Zengel, whose portrayal of a young girl stuck between multiple worlds is magnificent. The events of News are relatively paint by numbers but for me, that didn’t take away from the emotional impact of the third act or the timely message imbedded in the narrative concerning the importance of truth. Available on VOD.\n\nPromising Young Woman (Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Allison Brie)\n\nSummary: A former med student (Mulligan) seeks revenge on the men who assaulted her best friend.\n\nThis is super duper not my kind of movie typically and I can’t say I’m looking forward to watching it again anytime soon. But I was very impressed by the style and pace of the movie and, maybe most importantly, I’ve thought about this movie a ton in the days since my viewing. It’s stuck with me in a way that few movies from 2020 have. The big selling point, however, is Mulligan who I confess I haven’t always been a huge of. I am now. I get it. She’s tremendous in Promising and if she holds the Oscar trophy this year, she deserves it. Without spoiling the movie, the one criticism I have on this one is that I felt the twist coming a long way off and I’m not usually someone who thinks ahead of the movie or picks up on that kind of thing easily (a nice way of saying I am dumb). But still, the final scene is perfect and I remain a huge fan of a movie that is way off brand for me. Available on VOD.\n\nLike all of you, I was super pumped to be back in the building for church this weekend. Six months of displacement has been, of course, longer than any of us expected and much more difficult than anyone could have foreseen. I missed the worship, the sermons, the fellowship, the end of fellowship based on needing to get out the door and on the road to Olive Garden before the crowds assembled, and, of course, I missed communion. I love communion. I don’t like to serve communion because I really want that one quiet moment in church each week; it is a centering moment for me.[1]\n\nCommunion during quarantine was super wheels off for me as I’m sure it was for many of you.[2] I was pretty good at keeping grape juice on hand through most of quarantine though I would be lying if I told you we didn’t resort to Gatorade a time or two. But as for the bread? Every week was a scramble to find something bread-y for communion. Here is a ranking of all the things Lindsey, Cooper, and I used as a Communion Cracker replacement over the last six months.\n\nSALTINE CRACKERS\n\nI mean, I get it, Saltine Fans,[3] there’s nothing wrong with saltine crackers. But there’s also nothing right with saltine crackers. The biggest downside to the Saltine Cracker, of course, is its unfortunate association with having a stomach bug. Open up a bag of Saltine Crackers and your brain begins to wonder if you’re secretly planning on becoming sick or if you’ve already been so sick that your body forgot about all the puking you must have done very recently because there’s no other reason to be eating Saltine Crackers. 1/10, Would Not Recommend\n\nDORITOS\n\nFirst things first.\n\nQuestion: “Brian, do you mean Nacho Cheese Doritos or Cool Ranch Doritos? Or, I guess, Ultimate Cheddar Doritos, Spicy Nacho Doritos, or Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos?” – Taylor Walling\n\nAnswer: “Obviously I’m talking about Cool Ranch Doritos, Taylor, I’m not a monster.”\n\nSecond, Dorito Communion Day was at, like, the dead center of quarantine when emotions were high, shelves were low on supplies, and we were really trying not to venture out if at all possible. Then Sunday rolled around and yowza, the pantry was depressing. My son looked at me like I was crazy when I handed him a Cool Ranch Dorito and I honestly didn’t blame him. The biggest issue with the Dorita for communion is the flavor profile when mixed with grape juice. We probably should’ve just doubled down on this communion “treat” and swapped out grape juice for Mountain Dew. 2/10, Would Not Recommend\n\nTOSTITOS\n\nI have definitely had Tostitos with grape juice before. Don’t judge me,[4] college was weird and sometimes it was Sunday night in Searcy, Arkansas and the midnight snack choices were slim pickins, as they say in Searcy, Arkansas. The flavor is fine, it’s just that they’re so dang salty. Sooooo salty. And it’s the kind of salty that doesn’t wash away quickly like most of the better communion choices herein. Once you’ve had Tostitos Communion, you’re pretty much like, “Welp. I guess this is what my mouth tastes like forever now.” 4/10, Vaguely Would Not Recommend.\n\nNILLA WAFERS\n\nOn paper, Nilla Wafers sounds like a decent, if not downright good, idea as a replacement for unleavened bread. They’re sweet but not overly sweet, they kinda dissolve in your mouth, and they pair well with the juice. But they’re also wholly unsatisfying; they’re just sweet enough to activate the part of your brain that knows sugar is delicious even though it’s bad for you but not sweet enough to make that part of your brain go back into hibernation. And then you[5] spend the entire sermon being mildly distracted by wishing for more sugar. This is some real Screwtape Letters stuff right here. 5/10, Would Vaguely Recommend\n\nGOLDFISH\n\nGoldfish have to be the world leader in “Children’s snack most often stolen by a parent”, especially when you factor in the serving size of a bag of Goldfish. I hazard to guess that my son has never once in his life had a bag of Goldfish in my presence without me snagging a few out of that bag and I KNOW I am not alone in this. I don’t even like Goldfish all that much, it’s just a base instinct. “You got Goldfish? HOOK ME UP, BRO.”\n\nMy only hesitation on Goldfish as a communion replacement is there is no greater sign of Parental Give Up than busting out the Goldfish on Sunday morning. In my seven-ish years of having a child who can eat Goldfish, we have never once NOT had a thing of Goldfish in the pantry. Whether or not those Goldfish were fresh and not expired is a different matter entirely. When you have a child, people bring you diapers and wipes and home cooked meals and stuff and somewhere along the line someone hands you a gigantic box of Goldfish and that’s just a part of your life for at least the next 18 years. “Goldfish for Communion” might as well come with a note[6] that says “Yeah, look, I forgot, okay? Give me a break. It’s a pandemic. There’s a lot going on.” In fact, in the next pandemic, Goldfish should announce themselves as the official cracker of “Oops, I Forgot” Communion. 7/10, Would Recommend\n\nPRETZELS\n\nI don’t know if this is a Hot Take or not, but I am very pro-pretzel.[7] In its most humble form (Rold Gold pretzel sticks, approximately 700,000 in one bag), it is at worst inoffensive and at best mildly satisfying. In its most luxurious form (slathered in warm butter at Auntie Anne’s[8]), it is a marvelous treat and, in a pinch, a meal replacement when you’re trying to find shoes for your son between the end of school and the beginning of basketball practice.[9] Salty but not “ruin your mouth salty” like Tostitos and surprisingly complimentary to the grape juice. 7/10, Would Recommend\n\nCHEEZ-ITS\n\nI held out on using Cheez-Its for communion because I feared the cheese element would be too overpowering at 10:30 am on a Sunday when I’m still drinking my coffee. I can’t explain this but Cheez-Its feel like a late afternoon “power through to dinner” snack not an appropriate replacement for communion. At a certain point, though, I went for it and yeah, Cheez-Its came through with flying colors. The only downside is we couldn’t have Cheez-Its Communion the following week because I ate a whole mess of Cheez-Its right then and there during the sermon immediately following the first Cheez-Its Communion. 8/10, Would Recommend\n\nRITZ CRACKERS\n\nThe gold standard of Over the Counter Crackers. If Saltine Crackers are a reminder of how bad life is and how sick you must be if you’re eating Saltine Crackers, Ritz Crackers are the rainbow after the flood, a reminder of God’s promises and the good things that are to come. Glorious and perfectly suited to the juice. As a side note, you know what cracker is not represented in this list? Town House crackers. Because Town House crackers are a cheap knock-off of the Ritz Cracker. The Ritz v Town House War is real, people, and you can’t ride the fence. Pick a side! I have made my choice and I ride or die for Ritz.[10] 9/10, Strongly Recommend\n\nFIREHOOK MEDITERRANEAN BAKED CRACKERS\n\nY’all had these crackers? Manna from heaven. I don’t know if you can pick these up at just any old grocery store; I’ve only seen them at the super bougie Kroger Marketplace, the one that has a dope Medi bar with olives and cheeses and stuff.[11] Easily the best cracker and, yeah, they’re more expensive than Ritz Crackers and probably like twenty times more expensive than Saltine Crackers because I assume Saltine Crackers come free with the purchase of any Sprite product. But, trust me, totally worth it. They are the perfect amount of salty and BEST OF ALL! They have a real, genuine, unleavened bread/communion cracker feel to them so you can really recreate the In-Church Communion feeling you’ve been missing. Next pandemic, I am stocking up on toilet paper, water, and Firehook Mediterranean Baked Crackers, I promise you that. 10/10, Super Strongly Recommend\n\nOREOS\n\nYeah, I said it. Oreos. Oreos for communion. Communion Oreos. This is non-traditional, I grant you, but what about The Hills, I ask you, is traditional? For that matter, what about 2020 is traditional? Pandemics are hard, y’all, and self-care is important. Did I get some weird looks from Lindsey and Cooper when I busted out the Oreos for communion? Yeah, you bet I did. But I’m a trendsetter, an innovator, a trailblazer, if you will. And that’s the best communion I’ve ever had, hands down. In fact, I move that, whenever we are able to return to Communion As Normal,[12] the new normal is Oreo Communion. And before anyone asks, “regular Oreos or Double Stuf Oreos”, OBVIOUSLY the answer is Double Stuf. OBVIOUSLY. It is literally double the stuf for the same price. This is a no-brainer. 100/10, The Strongest of Recommends\n\n[1] This is, like, the last serious thing I will say in this email.\n\n[2] Or maybe not, I don’t know, maybe you were better at preparing than I was. Let’s be honest, I spent most of quarantine longingly staring at the basketball goal in the school playground next door.\n\n[3] #SaltineNation\n\n[4] Actually, go ahead and judge me. No regrets.\n\n[5] Okay, maybe not you; maybe it’s just me.\n\n[6] To myself and my wife and child since, you know, quarantine and stuff.\n\n[7] #PretzelNation.\n\n[8] Also, don’t sleep on the pretzel twist at Sonic! Delightful!\n\n[9] Been there!\n\n[10] #RitzNation.\n\n[11] It also used to have a jewelry store in it for some reason? But they’re renovating because it turns out people do not like to buy fancy jewelry approximately seven steps from where they buy toilet paper and grapes. Weird, I know. Who would’ve thought?\n\n[12] Probably in the year 2028 *falls flat on face*\n\nIf you enjoyed this foolishness, please check out the essay I published via Gumroad this summer wherein I drafted characters from fantasy movies and TV shows into the NBA. https://gum.co/eFQIf"
