        "text": "The World's Richest Beggar! (See\"NEWS\") The Ivy League Gets a Well-Deserved Kick in the Arse! (See\"NEWS\")\n\nMy Offensive System My Materials for Sale My Clinics Me\n\nMarch 7, 2006 - \"The highest reward for a person's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it.\" John Ruskin\n\n*********** Hello Coach, Your conversations about O-Line blocking techniques sure hit home with me. This issue is very frustrating to all us coaches who want to teach and play to the rules. More and more coaches do seem to take the attitude of adapting since the refs do not call it. I now see most of our opponents using the inside hold. I am convinced that most refs at our level really think it is legal. And they are the ones getting paid for their time.\n\nI often inherit kids from other programs who question our techniques, and they are really confused when they realize the previous coaches taught them an illegal move. I take heart in that at least somewhere along the line they learned the true rule.\n\nOur local HS coaches teach the O-Line to grab the defensive shoulder pads inside. The kids are told this is legal as long as the hands are inside. My own son is caught up in this, we have discussed this at length. He is smart enough to know the rule. But dear ole Dad always taught him to play as he is coached. So he plays along as he must if he wants to please his coaches.\n\nAs a youth coach, it is tough enough that the HS we feed into dictates we try to run their offense and defense. But now, they want us to coach their blocking techniques as well. I have to be really creative to get around that one.\n\nNAME WITHHELD, Somewhere in the South\n\n*********** Hallowed Yale and Harvard will gladly admit ex-Taliban types, but won't allow ROTC on their sacred campuses. Monday, though, the high and mighty got their asses handed to them by the Supreme Court. The prestigious law schools of Yale (which gave us the Clintons) and Harvard had up to now been able to keep military recruiters away from their students, on the grounds that the military, not particularly interested in having gay sex in barracks, discriminates against homosexuals. Not no more, though, as my grandmother used to say. Even the libs on the high court voted against the Ivy pukes, handing them an 8-0 shutout.\n\n*********** I am a Duke basketball fan and have been for years, so it pained me to watch North Carolina (simply \"Carolina\" to us Dookies) whip up on the Blue Devils Saturday night.\n\nBut pre-game, long before the agony of defeat, ESPN was nice enough to show us Duke's Senior Night festivities. It was the last home game of their college careers, and one by one, Duke's seniors - six of them - were introduced, and they hugged their teammates and coaches.\n\nOkay, okay. So I like Duke and you don't. So you're a Duke hater and it all made you sick to your stomach.\n\nYou're entitled to dislike Duke, but before you go too far - how many seniors does your favorite school have?\n\n*********** Maybe your state has an Official State Vegetable - but does it have TWO?\n\nThat's what it appears we'll have here in Washington, as a result of a bunch of ambitious middle school kids who, in the course of studying state government, thought it would be cool to see if they could get the Walla Walla Sweet Onion designated as our state veggie.\n\nThey actually managed to get a bill submitted to the House of Representatives where - what the hell, let's keep the kids happy - it passed, 95-1.\n\nBut then the mighty Washington Potato Commission, noting that their vegetable is more important to the state's economy, got into the act, and the bill bogged down in the Senate.\n\nSo while the state figures out ways to fund its schools, keep more state police on the highways and keep felons in prison, its lawmakers have found the time to work on a compromise, the result of which - I am not making this up - could mean that Washington has two Official State Vegetables - an Official State Edible Bulb and an Official State Tuber.\n\nWonder what those kids think about their state government now?\n\n*********** Saturday morning I spoke at the Nike Coach of the Year Clinic in Portland, and I saw some guys I hadn't seen in years. Once I began concentrating on the Wing-T and then the Double-Wing, I stopped going to the \"smorgasbord\" clinics, figuring that I could learn a whole lot more that would benefit me directly by combining with other Wing-T guys to concentrate on stuff pertaining specifically to us.\n\nNot much has changed, it would seem, based on the fact that over the three days of the clinic, I was the only person specifically presenting on behalf of a running offense. Oh, there were a couple of guys scheduled to talk about blocking, but I suspect it was \"blocking\" of the \"grab the breast plate\" variety.\n\nBut for the most part, the offensive sessions consisted of spread-it-out passing, screens, and shotgun option-type stuff.\n\nI have no doubt that the clinic was highly useful to the 800 or so coaches who attended, but it sure seems to me that if ever there was a time to go in the other direction from the masses - to the run and not the pass - this is it.\n\n*********** One of the guys I saw at the clinic accused me of \"going over to the dark side.\" That's how long it had been since John NHL and I last saw each other.\n\nJohn is now the head coach at Mountain View High in Bend, Oregon. For years, he and I worked together at Rich Brooks' camp at the University of Oregon. I was a passing guy then, and he was an ex-Duck quarterback who understudied Hall of Famer Dan Fouts. We would exchange ideas every night at the hospitality room.\n\nAnd there he was Saturday, saying, \"You taught me everything I know about the passing game (not true, by the way) and then you go over to the dark side!\"\n\n*********** Coach Wyatt &endash; I attended your presentation this past weekend at the Nike COY Clinic. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to you and seeing your offense. You commented that your offense works well for small schools, which leads me to my question: I coach at -------, a small school. We have gone 1-9 the last two seasons. This past year we had only 19 players turn out obviously we are hoping for more this next fall. My question: Is the Double Wing an offense that can work when essentially all of our players are on the field for almost every play (offense, defense, sp. Teams, etc.)?\n\nThis last season we ran a double-wing set, but with two wide-outs instead of two tight-ends. We were able to move the ball at times, but teams began to stack 8 defenders \"in the box\" against us. Seeing your offense makes me think that that wouldn't matter if we ran out of the Double Wing any thoughts you can provide would be appreciated. Thank you again!\n\nCoach: Glad you enjoyed the presentation. Trust me when I say that I couldn't even begin to scratch the surface in the time I had. My normal clinics go six hours, and even then, since most of the guys in attendance are already running my system and therefore we don't have to spend any time on the basics, we still don't cover all that we'd like to cover.\n\nThe short answer for your situation is that it is made to order for a program such as yours, because first of all, one man can coach it (this I found out when I coached in Finland and had no help), and second of all, it shortens the game for those players who go both ways.\n\nIt shortens the game simply because a running play at the end of which the runner does not go out of bounds or make a first down will typically consume 20-30 seconds until it is time for the next snap, while an incomplete pass will consume five or six seconds.\n\nThen there is the offense-defense factor. I can't prove this, but it is generally accepted football wisdom that players tire out more on offense than on defense. Maybe that's because if they are out on the field any length of time on offense, they are having a positive experience, while if they are spending a lot of time out there on defense, especially against a running team, they are probably being pushed around.\n\nIf you are a passing team, 3 straight incompletions won't take 30 seconds off the clock, and before you know it, you'll be punting and your kids will be back on defense again.\n\n*********** Thanks for asking me to serve on your panel at the Atlanta clinic. There are some guys at that clinic who know a lot more about football than I do. Thank goodness the system is so easy to install and understand that a novice like myself can be up and running with it in just a couple of weeks. It has gotten to the point now that I truly believe that our teams will be competitive regardless of our talent level. We have been fortunate to have some very good talent that past two years and I think we'll be good again next season. I am trying not to get away from our base plays and try anything too new. It takes a lot of reps to get new plays to work smoothly and I'd rather make the other stuff better. We usually get between 30-40 plays a game. My thinking is that this doesn't give the defense enough time to make adjustments that will stop what we do. We will run our plays from two or three sets and this keeps the defense guessing and makes them adjust to our formation. Slot and tackle over are great at our level. It really puts the DE in a dilemma. Sometimes if we try radical formations defenses will not be where we predict in practice and that confuses us more than our opponents. KISS - keep it simple stupid works for us. Enjoy the rest of your spring. Hope to hear from you soon. Dan King, Riverside Middle School, Evens, Georgia (Coach King has been running my system for at least five years now. I invited him to sit in on our panel as a middle school coach who knows his stuff and has had the good sense not to tweak the offense or try reinventing the wheel, but to stick with the basics and beat people with good kids and superior execution. HAW)\n\n*********** It was sad to note the passing last week of Curt Gowdy, a great sportsman and a gentleman with it. He was the sort of play-by-play guy who never tried to be bigger than the game itself. What he did was enhance the game. When you heard his smooth voice, you knew the game was big. Few of his obituaries mentioned the role he played, just by being the network's announcer, in establishing in the minds of the sports public that the American Football League was for real - was really professional.\n\nCurt Gowdy was a westerner, from Wyoming - who never lost his western twang, including the westerner's inability to make different vowel sounds for \"AH\" and \"AU.\" In other words, \"hock\" sounds like \"hawk,\" and so forth. \"Crawfish\" would come out \"crahfish.\"\n\nIt was 1967 or 1968 and I was in a bar in East Baltimore watching the World Series. Curt Gowdy was calling it.\n\nQuite the outdoorsman, he noted that one of the players enjoyed hunting in the off-season with a \"Crossbow.\"\n\n\"Crotchbow?\" said the barmaid, with a puzzled look of disbelief on her face. \"Crotchbow?\"\n\n2006 DOUBLE-WING CLINIC SCHEDULE - AS OF 3-7-06 (2006 CLINICS)\n\nCLINIC LOCATION FEB 25\n\nATLANTA\n\nHOLIDAY INN AIRPORT NORTH - 1380 Virginia Ave - 404-762-8411\n\nMARCH 11\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nHOLIDAY INN-MEDIA CENTER -150 E.

It cost $200 million to build.\n\nIt has a full-time crew of 60, including several former Navy Seals. It carries two helicopters, seven boats and a 10 man submarine capable of sleeping eight for as long as two weeks underwater. Oh- and a remote controlled vehicle for exploring the Ocean floor.\n\nMost experts on this sort of thing estimate that it costs roughly ten per cent of the price of a yacht every year to maintain it and pay for its crew. (For those of you without calculators, that means this baby costs $20 million a year just to operate.)\n\nIt was christened the Octopus, but it might just as well be the Ramp Rat. Yes, it's the world's biggest and most expensive yacht, and it belongs to the world's seventh-richest man, but at the moment he's trying to pose as a down-and-out on-ramp beggar in hopes of gulling the taxpayers of Portland into bailing him out - so he can keep up his yacht and keep stuffing millions of dollars into the pockets of his employees, who happen to be NBA basketball players.\n\nThe man is Paul Allen. He is owner of the Portland Trail Blazers, and also the Seattle Seahawks. Perhaps you remember my great enjoyment at the irony of seeing him greeted as a demigod when he raised the \"12th Man\" flag over Seahawks' Stadium prior to the NFC title game.\n\nThat's because while the national media were genuflecting and lauding him in Seattle as \"Mister Allen,\" not 200 miles away he was busy f--king up the once-seemingly unf--kable franchise, the Portland Trail Blazers, a sports franchise so beloved by its fans, so intertwined with its city that only a complete idiot could destroy the relationship. Well...\n\nAllen, whose nickname, \"The Accidental Zillionaire,\" is also the title of a biography about him, made billions by being friends with Bill Gates. Now, they are both in the process of giving their money away, but there the similarity ends. While Mr. Gates gives his to charitable causes, Mr. Allen gives his to professional basketball players - most of whom not only aren't very good players, but more often than not aren't very good people, either.\n\nLet's see: Rasheed Wallace - good player/jerk; Ruben Patterson - fair player/registered sex offender; Shawn Kemp - fair player/serial begetter of illegitimate children by numerous mothers; Bonzi Wells - fair basketball player/petulant, insubordinate child; Qyntel Woods - so-so basketball player/suspected dog fighter. And so forth and so on.\n\nHow do you piss away $10 billion? It's not easy, I'm sure, but it has been reported by financial sources that Paul Allen has managed to do just that, turning $30 billion into $20 billion through bad business investments, including his ownership of the Trail Blazers, three of whom - Zach Randolph, Darius Miles and Theo Ratliff - are signed to contracts totalling more than $160 million.\n\nOne of the reasons why he's losing money with the Trail Blazers is that he's paying too much money for his help. In the 2002-2003 seasons, he had the highest payroll in the NBA. Now that's saying something. If he'd ever had a real job or ever tried running a real business (with a budget 'n' everything), he'd have learned long ago that that won't work forever.\n\nHe did try to economize a couple of years ago, but not by cutting back on player salaries. Instead, he let some peons go - 80 Trail Blazers' office workers. Not a great way to ingratiate yourself with a community that was finally beginning to sense that it had had enough of his act.\n\nBut another reason is that he got too clever for his own good. After building an arena, partly with his own money, partly with borrowed money, he decided to set up two corporations. One - Trail Blazers Inc. - would own and operate the basketball team, and the other - Oregon Arena Corp. - would own and operate the arena. Trail Blazers Inc. would pay the arena to use it, while the arena would not only get the rent, but would also sell - and keep the money from - signs, luxury boxes and concessions. Only an accountant/lawyer would know why it was done that way, but Mr. Allen is certainly in a position to hire the best of advisors, and that's the advice he got.\n\nAs the Portland economy hit some hard times, and the public grew increasingly disgusted by the off- and on-court antics of Allen's hired hands, Oregon Arena's income suffered, and had trouble making payments to its creditors, so it - but not the Trail Blazers - filed for bankruptcy. Allen then tried pulling a fast one on his creditors, offering them 50 cents on the dollar, but they were having none of it, and they took over the arena, hiring a Philadelphia firm to run it.\n\nNow, the new management books concerts and other events into the arena year-round, and keeps the revenues. And it still sells advertising in the arena, and luxury suites, and concessions, and collects rent from the Trail Blazers, who have no place else to play.\n\nAnd that leaves the poor little rich boy trying to operate an NBA basketball team without any revenue from signs, luxury boxes or concessions. Try selling sponsorship deals when you don't have any luxury seats to throw in. It has been absolutely bizarre listening first to one radio spot pushing tickets to the next Blazers' game, with a phone number to call, followed by another spot selling really good tickets to the next Blazers' game - offering food, too - with a totally different phone number to call.\n\nAllen's henchmen were in town recently, daring to suggest some sort of \"public-private partnership\" between the Trail Blazers and city, county or state government, or a combination thereof. (He sent his advisors because even in nice-nice Portland, he doesn't dare show his face.)\n\nLook out, folks - you may very well see something you've never seen before, in this climate of cities with rotting schools and high crime rates sucking up to professional sports teams. Portland has the same rotting schools and Portland isn't crime-free, but Portland could very well be the first city of any size to tell the owner of a sports franchise to take a hike.\n\nPortland, you see, doesn't need professional sports. Portland is a different city. Portland isn't a dirty, grimy, down-on-its-luck post-industrial city that has to have professional sports to take its mind off its troubles. Portland is a city that many of its residents have chosen to live in for its unique lifestyle. As a local sports writer put it today, Portland has Mount Hood (year-round snow and skiing just an hour and a half away), the Oregon Coast, and Powell's (world's greatest book store). I would add that Portland has boating, sailing and water skiing within ten minutes of downtown, and Portland has dozens of magnificent golf courses with reasonable greens fees. You can leave work and in a half-hour be on any of a half-dozen rivers fishing for salmon, steelhead or sturgeon, and if you don't like the outdoors, there are Indian casinos in every direction. Portland has great restaurants, and so many microbreweries that it has been called \"Beervana\" by one beer expert, who suggests that it might even be the Beer Capital of the World. If you absolutely have to have an occasional pro sports fix, Seattle is three hours away by car or train.\n\nIn short, without demeaning other cities less well-endowed by nature, Portland is not a city with an inferiority complex that requires the validation an NBA team might provide.\n\nPortland is also growing wise to what economists have been reporting for some time now - that for the most part, professional sports teams don't \"pump\" money into an economy. Simply put, they don't bring money to an area. All they do is redistribute the money that's already in an area, taking it out of one person's pocket and putting it into somebody else's. The money that people spend on tickets to a sports event - and on food and hats and shirts for the kids - is not money that suddenly appeared in the economy. It is money that they would otherwise have spent in local restaurants and local theatres and local shopping centers.\n\nProviding a good laugh in all this has been local boy-makes-not-so-good Damon Stoudamire, who has announced that he can put together a group to buy the Trail Blazers. That oughtta be good - an owner who can't pass the league's drug test. It is fair to say that historically, where you found Damon Stoudamire there was also a good chance you would find weed. Once, when they stopped a yellow Hummer for speeding, Washington state troopers found 'Sheed Wallace and Damon Stoudamire inside, in a fog of, um, \"second-hand smoke.\" Come to think of it, anybody stupid enough to ride in something that conspicuous, and speed, while smoking dope, might make an NBA owner.\n\nNot so very long ago, while Stoudamire was away from his suburban home, his burglar alarm went off. Police responded, and finding the front door open, went inside and looked around, and whaddaya know? - found a rather large stash of marijuana. The weenie judge let Stoudamire off, not because he didn't have a large quantity of pot on hand, but because in his judgement police, who would have been castigated if they hadn't entered his home to investigate, had no right to look around.\n\nNot long after that, Stoudamire was caught with a somewhat smaller amount of pot on his person when he was stopped by a metal detector at the Tucson Airport. Seems he'd wrapped it in tin foil.\n\nBut back to Paul Allen. After all the other stuff, this might be the worst. Look at the flag flying at the stern of Paul Allen's yacht. It sure ain't American. And look at the home port. George Town. That's in the Cayman Islands.\n\n*********** Hello Coach, I just finished reading your article in the news about football like it used to be years ago and how it is today. I would like to bring up another area that has changed. I coach in Utah and don't know how it is anywhere else concerning this issue. Now days Baseball, Soccer and Basketball are almost year round sports. The first time I had this as a issue was when a few of the boys on the team would miss one day of practice during the week. When I talked to them about this they stated they were on the Traveling Baseball Team and still had a month to go in their season. I have had other players who were also playing Soccer during part of the season. I have coached in some areas of the country where that was not allowed because of the injury potential or for insurance reasons. Talk about serving two masters. I know I don't want any boys getting hurt while playing Soccer or Baseball and I cant imagine their coaches being thrilled about them getting hurt playing football. When I played there was one sport for one time of year, or other sports that did not compete with football. As of now the league allows this to continue. I really have a problem with a boy playing two sports at one time when one is football. However it seems that it doesn't cause any of the other boys on the team to even blink. They accept it as if it has always been that way. I don't want to hold back any boy as far as his athletic potential, but its tough, Thanks, Richard Payne\n\nCoach, I think that part of the reason other kids accept this garbage is that they are conditioned to be \"tolerant\" (tolerate anything, in other words) and not to be \"judgmental.\" That sort of feel-good conditioning is basically neutering our boys, nipping any early signs of leadership in the bid.\n\nI wish I could tell you to take a stand against these people who want to dominate kids' lives year-round. This new trend is very selfish and adult-driven. It is primarily the work of coaches who use the supposed prestige of playing on \"elite\" teams to cater to the greed or the guilt of ambitious parents. It does not take the kid's best interests into consideration.\n\nWhat are we teaching kids when we start promoting this nonsense that they don't have to make choices? That they can have it all?\n\nThe poor, poor parents whine about having to chauffeur the kids to this practice and that. They actually sacrifice their own lives and the rest of the family's life so that these little 10-year-old pre-professionals can play on travelling teams.\n\nThey talk about how stressful it is. They talk about the demands on the kids' time.\n\nBut they're the ones who consent to this. And they're the ones who squeal loudest that teachers are giving too much homework.\n\nWhy should football have to make way for a sport whose season goes too long, or goes year-round?\n\nSince many of these parents sincerely believe that they are preparing their kids for a future in pro sports, you might as well do your share to help prepare those kids for the future, too - for the possibility, remote, to be sure, that someday, instead of being professional athletes, they might actually find themselves working at a real job. And working for an employer who isn't going to excuse their absence from work because they have another job.\n\nAt the least, I would make it known, well in advance, that there will be consequences for missing practice and games. How can it be otherwise?\n\n*********** After three terms as a US Congressman, former Nebraska coach Tom Osborne is running for Governor of Nebraska. He'll face the incumbent governor, Dave Heineman in May's Republican primary. Heineman evidently has made a point of mentioning that being a football coach does not prepare one for being a governor, and at a fundraiser for Osborne, former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer said, \"I'd say he's scared. It's the greatest preparation, being a football coach. We're taking young men for four or five years, 24/7, hundreds of them. And we're trying to develop them to be productive citizens. What is the career that develops you to be a governor or senator or congressman? Law school? We've got enough of them.\"\n\n*********** Hugh, Another great clinic in Atlanta. It just keeps getting bigger and better every year. It looks like we have a representative of the \"Wyatt\" DW in every class in Mississippi now.\n\nAAAAA-Ocean Springs\n\nAAAA-Lawrence County and McComb\n\nAAA-Water Valley\n\nAA-McLaurin and Newton (I have met several times with Coach Moore at Newton)\n\nA- Pisgah\n\nLet me know about that date in Portland. I may try another clinic this spring. I am checking on flights.\n\nYour Friend, Steve Jones, Ocean Springs, Mississippi\n\n*********** Have you always been a big believer in team offense/scrimmage time during practice or has that developed since you went to the double wing? I was curious if you used to break down more into groups.\n\nIt has mostly happened since I became a Double-Winger. Actually, I think in many ways it was prompted by my experience coaching overseas, where I had no one to assist me.\n\nIf you went back to coach a Delaware wing-t or run and shoot would you break down more or stay with the current approach of team work?\n\nIf I went back to Delaware Wing-T I would spend a bit more time in group work, and if I went back to run-and-shoot, depending on how much we threw the ball I would probably spend even more time in group or individual work. I think a big factor is the lack of splits in the Double-Wing, which reduces the problem of having to deal with blitzes.\n\n*********** I have been asked about whether to get involved in summer passing leagues at all, and what to do if you decide to go ahead with it.\n\nFirst of all, I am all for it.\n\nIt will probably be the best chance you'll have, even in-season, to look at your coverages.\n\nAnd, too, any activity that brings your kids together is worthwhile.\n\nI prefer that it not be competitive to the point where they keep standings and all that garbage, because my impression over the years is that, at least with us, there is ZERO carryover from summer's results to fall's.\n\nI think it is crucial to prepare your kids in advance by stressing that in the summer, we are playing the other guys' game - grass basketball, an offense that doesn't even require pads. In fact, a lot of those guys out there catching passes might not even be playing once they hand out the pads. No, we tell them, we asked and they told us we couldn't run the Wedge out there. (Ha, ha. That will usually get a chuckle out of your kids.) We stress that right now, we are playing their game, but once we put the pads on, they will have to play our game.\n\nIn terms of strategy, my personal feeling is that as much as possible we should run our base passes, because if we can run play action when they KNOW it is coming, we can run it against anybody. It is on the order of holding a scrimmage against a team that is much better than you.\n\n*********** Coach Wyatt, Regarding free lunches for the kids at school; I've been in the school system just long enough to figure out that the great majority of kids who are getting free lunch (and free breakfast, for that matter) can afford to pay for their food. After all, many of these same kids arrive to school wearing $100+ tennis shoes. However, the majority of those who receive free lunches have the type of parent who would never take the time to prepare them a lunch anyway, so if it wasn't for the school, the kid just wouldn't get to eat. If the school asked the parent, \"why aren't you preparing a lunch for your child?\" they would simply respond that they couldn't afford to do so, when the fact of the matter is that they just won't take the time to do so. The school, on the other hand, figures if you're not going to give them food, I guess we will. It's a similar excuse that's offered by the same parents as to why they can't attend a parent/teacher conference. The parent says that they don't have transportation to get themselves to the school, when the reality is that they just don't care to go. Dave Potter, Durham, North Carolina (Welcome to the cycle of dependency. My wife used to teach with a woman who would say that the least the schools could do is tell the kids to be grateful that there were people in America whose generosity paid for their lunch. As George Will wrote this past weekend, we are finding that poverty is not a matter of not having money, but more a matter of lacking certain character traits - self-reliance, punctuality and the ability to defer gratification, to name just a few - that practically guarantee that a person will not escape \"poverty.\" HW)\n\nNEXT CLINIC - LA/SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - SAT MARCH 11 - HOLIDAY INN-MEDIA CENTER -150 E.
