        "text": "I will confess, I am a total Donna Noble fan (and have been for some time). So prepping for the 60th Anniversary Doctor Who specials by rewatching the Donna Noble season was a task I readily welcomed.\n\nAfter endless ages in Doctor Who S1-2 of the Holy Beloved Rose Tyler, and the weirdly abortive S3 “oh, she’s falling for the Doctor, too” tenure of Martha Jones, having a Companion for S4 that was (a) out for a good, interesting time, (b) not falling on love with the Doctor, (c) sassy and independent, (d) definitely not falling in love with the Doctor, (e) nagged by an inferiority complex, and (f) oh so very much not falling in love with the Doctor, was like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe chemistry between David Tennant and Catherine Tate was lovely. The dynamic of a Companion who wasn’t cowed or dominated or (as noted) smitten with the Doctor was delightful. There was humor, there was terror, there was so much of an EveryPerson about Donna, that every moment in her early tenure was a delight.\n\nHer first encounter, in the S3 “Runaway Bride” gave us a person-on-the-street encounter with the weirdness of the Doctor. “Partners in Crime” shows both how that encounter has changed her and how the Doctor (a lesson that holds true for every regeneration, but particularly for Ten) absolutely needs a Companion. That’s reinforced in “Fires of Pompeii,” showing how the Doctor’s hit-and-miss adherence to the rules, like a good little Time Lord, can lead to moments of amoral inhumanity, and in “Planet of the Ood” gives the Doctor a boost in the moral outrage over that race’s slavery.\n\nDonna gets pushed a little to the side with a standard alien invasion in “The Sontaran Strategem” and “The Poison Sky,” and, for obviously reasons, continues to play support in “The Doctor’s Daughter.” But she’s back on stage for the Agatha Christie “The Unicorn and the Wasp.”\n\nAfter what is, at that point, a pretty normal Doctor Who season (a few invasions, some weird planets and historical pieces), S4 becomes nightmarishly dark. I would say that “Silence in the Library” and “Forest of the Dead” are the scariest bits of the season, if not for the Twilight Zone-perfect “Midnight,” but Donna remains a presence — her phantom family drama in the Library two-parter makes up for River Song’s introduction pushing her a bit to the side, and her grounding of the Doctor after a very, very unpleasant encounter in the worst parts of human nature are critical parts of what make those episodes work.\n\nAll of which leads to an even darker tale in the first of the three-ep season wrap, “Turn Left,” where we see what the world — and, by extension, the lives of Donna and her family — becomes if she never takes the step that brings her to meet the Doctor. It’s an hour of progressive dystopia with shades of Alan Moore’s V for Vendetta, as the various disasters and plots that the Doctor averted over the course of S3-4 actually come to pass when Donna’s not there to pull the Doctor back in “The Runaway Bride.” After the horror of the Library saga and the psychodrama of “Midnight,” “Turn Left” just becomes horribly depressing (with a frisson of horror from the bug on Donna’s back).\n\nThroughout it all, though, Donna remains — if not positive, then resolute. Capable of outrage. Determined to make things better. Self-deprecating, but willing to step up for a fight. She is utterly human and utterly a force of nature.\n\nThat brings us to “The Stolen Earth” and “Journey’s End,” as Donna lets herself be recruited to save the world. The pair of episodes carries a massive, sometimes almost overwhelming amount of fan service, drawing in every NuWho Companion and hangers-on, including key cast members of Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures, into a massive, multi-layered conspiracy by and battle against the (of course) Daleks.\n\nThrough this, it would be easy for Donna to fade a bit into the background, but she’s a key, if controversial, part of the plot. By the end of things, she’s proven herself, the “Temp from Chiswick,” to be the most important human in the universe … and is, for Reasons, demoted into amnesiac former Companion, unaware of what she’d seen, done, accomplished.\n\nIt feels outrageously, massively unfair to the character, of course (esp. as Martha heads off to new possible adventures, and Rose ends up with her mom and the Man of Her Dreams, sort of). It’s still gut-wrenching to watch (even as it includes the meme-worthy “David Tennant in the Rain” scene), but, aware how much of it must have been driven by Catherine Tate’s contract (she had a successful career both pre- and post-Who) and the winding down the Russell Davies era, it’s actually a far better ending than “Oh, I’m tired of / traumatized by / unrequited about traveling with the Doctor, so I quit” (which is pretty much what sort of happened with Martha, and with a number of Companions over the decades). It hurts like hell, but it’s also a tribute to the character at the same time.\n\nAnd where did things go from there? Lacking Donna, the Tenth Doctor goes into what turns into a self-destructive spiral ending with him (and the showrunner) regenerating into Matt Smith’s Eleven and Steven Moffat — accompanied by increasingly Mary Sue-ish Amy Pond and Clara Oswald.\n\nWhich, of course, brings us a few Doctors along (Peter Capaldi’s gruff rock star Twelve, and, under Chris Chibnall, Jodie Whittaker’s lovely Thirteen) to the 60th Anniversary specials, with David Tennant somehow becoming the regeneration into Fourteen and (we are told) Catherine Tate back as Donna. How will that work? Well, yeah, I’m a day or two late in watching, but I’m very eager to find out.\n\nI had some time this week — with business trips and band rehearsals dragging off fellow family members — to watch the thirteen episodes of Doctor Who that starred Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, the series that started the “New Who” reboot of the show in 2005.\n\nMan, I’m sorry he only lasted a season, because Eccleston rocked. The Ninth Doctor reminds me, in some ways, of Tom Baker’s Fourth Doctor — a bit madcap much of the time, alternating with bouts of deadly seriousness. He’s angrier, though, sometimes almost cruel. And his experiences just coming off of the Time War, wherein he was responsible for the destruction of the Daleks and the Time Lords, has left him as seriously damaged goods. His desire for a Companion, for anyone to want to spend time with him, is palpable to the point of pathos, but his simmering anger and self-loathing over his war-time actions sometimes causes him to lash out or make bad decisions in a way that has rarely plagued the other regenerations of the Doctor.\n\nBilly Piper’s Rose Tyler has long been one of my least favorite Companions, but this rewatch has confirmed that’s in large part due to how she was written with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant), as an improbable romantic interest. In this season, at least, Rose is a relatively grounded everywoman, and watching her deal with the seduction of being a Companion, despite its effects on her mother and ostensible boyfriend, and dealing as well when it seems that will all be taken away from her, are some of the better parts of Rose’s tenure on the show.\n\nThe Ninth Doctor’s relationship with Rose is more as a father figure than Ten’s romantic one, at least to my mind (if unsupported in any interview material I found). He acts toward her as the long-absent father who shows up and showers the kid with gifts, who’s desperate to build a relationship, who intrinsically bristles at the mother, loathes the boyfriends, gets overly-critical in the child’s shortcomings, but ultimately revels in doing all sorts of Dad things with her (“Let’s take a trip and see something cool!”). Yeah, there’s a kiss at the last episode, but no metaphor is perfect, and that’s kind of a weird moment anyway.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the other Companion who comes along for the ride late in the season, Capt. Jack Harkness (played by John Barrowman). It was a true delight seeing him early days as repentant con man, always ready with some pansexual inuendo, but noteworthy in the last few episodes for his savage, fierce loyalty to both Rose and the Doctor.\n\nWhile no season of Doctor Who is without flaw, this particular series has some particularly good ones: “The End of the World,” “Dalek,” “Father’s Day,” “The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances” “Bad Wolf / The Parting of Ways” stack up, in my mind, with anything else that’s been done on the show.\n\nThe key to these things is Eccleston’s Doctor, who easily riffles through turbulent emotions like a deck of cards, who feels so contemptuously apart from humans (see Pertwee’s Third Doctor, or even Capaldi’s Twelfth) but is passionately admiring and protective of them, whose trauma from the Time War is still on his sleeve but who’s trying to get better, who is guilty of mass slaughter, but turns away from it over the season multiple times, whose “daft old face” lights up in a way that can always bring a smile even when you know he’s not smiling on the inside.\n\nDamned fine stuff, and a great push-start to the New Who. I regret he was around for a short a time as he was, but I’m glad he was there.\n\nSo this is based on an article from a Popular Mechanics (!) article on \"The 50 Greatest Sci-Fi Shows Ever\" [http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/g156/the-50-greatest-sci-fi-tv-shows]. See here [https://hill-kleerup.org/blog/2015/10/17/the-50-greatest-sci-fi-tv-shows-kinda-sorta-more-or-less.html] for caveats and comments on that list.\n\nI've decided to do my own force ranking (thanks +Stan Pedzick), working within the same list (to do otherwise would be to court madness). And, because I can (and, apparently, have way too much free time on my hands), I'll annotate it. Because the Internet.\n\nFirst, the shows I never watched sufficiently to judge — they either never grabbed me, or were on at an odd time, or I missed the tide in watching them. (Please don't ply me with DVDs; my backlog of stuff to watch already reaches past the Singularity.) They are ordered as per the original rankings:\n\nDark Angel (46)\n\nJericho (44)\n\nLife on Mars [2006] (40)\n\nLexx (39)\n\nTwin Peaks (37)\n\nCaprica (34)\n\nRed Dwarf (27)\n\nGhost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (26)\n\nStar Blazers / Space Battleship Yamato (20)\n\nBlake's 7 (15)\n\nLost (12)\n\nThe rest are ranked by some idiosyncratic mish-mosh of how I like them plus what quality I think they are. I;ve indicated past the title the original ranking; the lower-ranked ones are helped a lot by dropping out the above 11 choices. Since I broke them up into three groups for initial sorting, I've kept them that way.\n\n(Force ranking of this sort is one of my least favorite activities, since on any given day or for any given episode, I could easy see any of these rankings +/5.)\n\nBOTTOM OF THE CLASS\n\n39. Knight Rider (45) – Silly kids fare, with minimal FX and zero SFishness aside from snarky car AI. Though I still love Marc Daniels.\n\n38. Battle of the Planets (41) — Noteworthy mainly for still inspiring cosplay.\n\n37. The Six Million Dollar Man (47) — I would still watch this at the drop of a hat, but its SF elements were awful.\n\n36. Logan's Run (28) — Deep 70s SF, variable \"worlds,\" pretty bad writing.\n\n35. Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (36) — Space fantasy, though I still dearly love the stargate effect.\n\n34. Lost in Space (31) — The first show to really get space opera in everyone's living room, dragged down by camp silliness that only increased each season.\n\n33. _Thunderbirds (50) — Crunchy SF with marionettes and kiddy melodrama. I still marvel at this show.\n\n32. Land of the Lost (49) — Hurt by being a Saturday morning \"cartoon\" period show, it's still (behind the awful stop-action) full of some very cool SF concepts.\n\n31. V [1983] (13) — Brought big screen TV SF to life as an \"event\" — but with writing straight out of Dallas or Dynasty.\n\n30. War of the Worlds (38) — A personal favorite of mine, if for no other reason than bringing back those lovely swan-necked Martian War Machines from the Pal movie.\n\n29. Mystery Science Theater 3000 (17) — Upchecked for showing so many wonderfully cheesy SF movies, but downchecked for really just being a comedy riff.\n\nSTARTING TO GET SERIOUS\n\n28. Sliders (18) — Imaginative, but the concept wore thin after a while.\n\n27. Quantum Leap (21) — Better than its first cousin Sliders if only because the consequences were of such import and the characterizations were such a challenge. Arguably as much fantasy as thinly veiled SF.\n\n26. The X-Files (02) — It was … okay. Influential. Dearly loved by zillions. But I never really got hooked by it.\n\n25. Stargate SG-1 (14) — I was never a big fan of any of the Stargate iterations. Not sure why. But impressive in overall accomplishment.\n\n24. Space: 1999 (48) — I remember this as the first satisfying SF show after the original Star Trek went off the air. The FX/model work was exquisite. It was hampered S.1 by opaque British plots, and S.2 by dumbing down too far from S.1.\n\n23. Battlestar Galactica [1978] (30) — Incredibly hokey, but spectacular beyond its budget. Some plots were deeper than others.\n\n22. Dollhouse (42) — Possibly ranked higher than it should be here, because while I never quite got hooked, I could tell it had a lot of strings below the surface that I wasn't giving it a chance to show.\n\n21. Space: Above and Beyond (43) — As close as we'll ever get to a Starship Troopers TV show. I liked it.\n\n20. Star Trek: Voyager (32) — Decent Star Trek fare, hampered by an unwillingness to truly embrace the inevitable change and problems of isolation, division, and deferred maintenance.\n\n19. Max Headroom (25) — I am afraid of rewatching this for fear that the zany fun and interesting concepts I remember will turn out to be threadbare.\n\n18. Alien Nation (33) — Like much good TV SF, this tackled (well) contemporary issues (mostly about racism) that would have been too controversial outside of the SF realm.\n\n17. Torchwood (23) — Sometimes too tempted to go over the top, and with an ensemble that the writers never quite knew what to do with, this is still good, gritty, high concept SF (overlapping to fantasy).\n\n16. Fringe (09) — I never became a fan, despite being a serious watcher for at least the first season.\n\nTOP DOGS\n\n15. The Prisoner (07) — While suffering from British too-cleverness (and star/producer indulgence) at times, it's still gripping in making the viewer want to figure out what the hell is going on.\n\n14. Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (24) — A great example of successfully (for my taste) grabbing a movie concept and running with it for TV. Well done.\n\n13. Cowboy Bebop (35) — Too cool for school, between the music, the action, the dialog.\n\n12. Futurama (29) — Ranked this high if only because of their willingness to use very single SF trope in the book — multiple times — and do it with humor.\n\n11. Neon Genesis Evangelion (08) — High concept that sometimes gets too high for comprehensibility, it's still a gorgeous (and frightening) Giant Robots vs Aliens anime with eleventy-dozen layers beneath it, from religion to child abuse to alcoholism to identity.\n\n10. The Twilight Zone (05) — Endlessly rewatchable and entertaining, its SF elements get washed away by fantasy too many times, and too many of the Serling and Matheson plots were simply setups for (usually great) plot zingers.\n\n09. Doctor Who (01) — The face of SF for many, and laudable for its longevity and the loyalty of its fans — but, again, too much of it is more properly fantasy, and the uneven writing over the decades does not for great SF make. I watch every episode, but I'm trying to be realistic here.\n\n08. Star Trek: The Next Generation (03) — A remarkable rebirth of a franchise, with a long run, a decent number of great eps, and a large number of not-so-great ones.\n\n07. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (16) — For my money, a better show than its TNG big brother, especially early days when they were diving into the characters and the religion / politics of Bajor, less into the Dominion War in its later episodes. That said, its serial elements put it a tick above TNG.\n\n06. Star Trek: The Original Series (06) — A remarkably seminal show in its influence on TV SF for the decades since. Riddled with weaknesses that its cultural gestalt has overcome.\n\n05. The Outer Limits (10) — With very few exceptions, this classic anthology show was hard SF, written by some great talent (and acted by some remarkable talent), hampered at time by budget limits, but hitting major literary themes and SF tropes in a remarkable fashion. This show (in rerun) solidified my love of SF.\n\n04. _Battlestar Galactica [2004] (04) — A gripping tale of survival and moral compromise, in the face of aliens who look just like us … those were the high points of BSG. The further they drifted away from that (e.g., the further they explored Cylon society), the weaker the show got. And, of course, I truly despise the last couple of episodes concluding the series. Still, with those exceptions, it's a remarkable work.\n\n03. Farscape (22) — One never quite knew where this show was going (that seems to have included the writers), but that didn't hamper the wonders, fun, drama, and imagination of this ensemble explorers-on-the-run show. I just enjoyed it so much, it needed to rank this high.\n\n02. Babylon 5 (19) — Joe Straczynski didn't invent serial TV, but he made it legit, and epic (despite near-disasters by networks and actors alike). Rocky acting early on, and mangled plot points toward the end, it still holds a major place in my heart as a five-year long coherent SF novel, delving into everything from high concept battles between not-really-good vs not-truly-evil, to human weakness and prejudice, including some remarkable character evolutions.\n\n01. Firefly (11) — Yeah, I'm one of those people. Deep-threaded plots and hidden backstories, a delightful mixing of the SF and Western tropes, a splendid set of actors, a roster of episodes where the great far outweigh the weak, and … well, the biggest criticism I can make of the show is that it was cut off way too soon to determine if it would all pay off. I'll assume it did, and just wait for the opportunity to buy the 5-season set when we finally get those portals to parallel worlds working …\n\nAnd some arguably as-good shows that didn't make the list:\n\nWild Wild West (of course it's science fiction)\n\nAndromeda\n\nFantastic Journey\n\nOtherworld\n\nGreatest American Hero\n\nUFO\n\nThe Flash [1990]\n\nMisfits of Science\n\nThe Invaders\n\nRobotech\n\nI do give, again, kudos to the writers of the original list for leaving off anything within the past five years. Not only would that add a large number of prospects, but it's really hard to judge such things so close to them.\n\nView on Google+"
