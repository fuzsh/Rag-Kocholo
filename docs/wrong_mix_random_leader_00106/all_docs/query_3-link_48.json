        "text": "I had intended to initiate a commerative thread to pterry on the anniversery of his death. March 12, 2015.\n\nWith my usual attention to detail I missed the date. I doubt that he will hold it against me.\n\n-Stolen from a variety of sources-\n\nQuotes;\n\n-Build a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life. - Jingo\n\n-The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it. - Diggers\n\n-Stories of imagination tend to upset those without one. -\n\n-Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it. - Reaper Man\n\n-\"What is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile?\"\n\nDeath thought about it.\n\nCATS, he said eventually. CATS ARE NICE.” - Sourcery\n\n-“DON'T THINK OF IT AS DYING, said Death. JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH.” -Good Omens\n\n-“If you have enough book space, I don't want to talk to you.”\n\n-\"Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Little—\"\n\nYES. AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.\n\n\"So we can believe the big ones?\"\n\nYES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.\n\n\"They're not the same at all!\"\n\nYOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET—Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.\n\nThere are hundreds of Pratchett quotes that are worth looking at. Here are (literally) 7,380 of them.\n\nLINK\n\nI mentioned elsewhere that I donate to the Orangutan Foundation in his memory. Go thou and do likewise.\n\nThanks, Pogo It should have been my turn to do this but it has been a strange spring.\n\nTrying to think of a properly Pratchett quote to cover this week's home maintenance problem.\n\nbut my sense of humor is a bit lacking right now.\n\nI had a silent failure of one of the zones of my heating system on the coldest weekend of the year.\n\none of the solenoids that controlled the pump for that zone failed. add in temp below5°f and 40 to 60 mph wind that corner of the house froze without my knowledge and when things thawed out after the cold snap that corner of the basement looked like a malfunctioning car wash!\n\nSo two experienced plumbers and a carpenter have been here for 2 days replacing numerous sections of copper pipe in both the heating circuit for that zone and the domestic water supply in that part of the basement...\n\nthank goodness for a good insurance agent and company (Chubb) but the deductable means I know where my stimulus check is going."
