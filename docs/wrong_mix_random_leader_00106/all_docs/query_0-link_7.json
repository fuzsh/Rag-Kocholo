I'm using\n\nversion 1.3. Perhaps these ( and the suggestions and fixes to the bug\n\nreports I've previously sent ) could be incorporated into a 1.4 patch ?\n\n- In the \"Races\"/\"Technology Tribute\" and \"Races\"/\"Exchange Technology\"\n\nscreens, it gives you a list of technologies to offer the other\n\nplayer, and the list of technologies he's offering you. However,\n\nwhen presented with these choices, you have no idea which technologies\n\nwould benefit you (or your opponents), and which would not, unless you've\n\ngot all of your and the computer players' technologies listed on a\n\npiece of paper (ug!).\n\nIt would be really helpful if instead of displaying the tech names in black,\n\nif they could be displayed in different colors, indicating whether\n\nor not you or the computer player would benefit from that technology\n\nor not. Say something like:\n\nWhen giving tech to a computer player, your tech appears:\n\nWhite - If this would surpass the computer's current abilities\n\nin that area ( e.g. giving \"Terraforming +20\"\n\nwhen the computer only has \"Terraforming +10\" ).\n\nGrey - If this would give some minor benefit to the computer\n\nplayer, but not be on the cutting edge in that area\n\n( e.g., giving \"Neutron Pellet Gun\" when the computer\n\nalready has \"Neutron Blaster\" ).\n\nBlack - If this would not benefit the computer player at all,\n\nother than increasing that area's tech level by 1\n\n( e.g., giving \"Range 5\" to a computer player that\n\nalready had \"Range 6\" ).\n\nin that area.\n\nThus, you'd only want to give away or trade items colored \"black\" first,\n\nthen \"grey\" items, but only give way \"white\" colored items as a last\n\nresort.\n\nSymmetrically, when the computer was offering you items to choose from,\n\nit would display items in the above colors based on how they would\n\nbenefit you.\n\n- The above color scheme could be applied to the \"Races\"/\"Report\" screen.\n\nRight now, the ones you don't have are displayed in white, and the\n\ntechnologies you've also got are in brown. Perhaps the ones displayed\n\ncurrently in white could be changed to the white/grey/black system above,\n\nand the ones you've both got would still be brown.\n\n- The \"Races\"/\"Report\" screen needs to have vertical scroll bars on the\n\ncomputer player's tech advance areas. Right now, if the computer player\n\nhas many items, you can't see all of them.\n\nps. Let me know if you need beta-testers for MOO 1.4 ( or anything else ).\n\n======================================================================\n\nJeffrey Adam Johnson Internet: jajo...@ingr.com\n\n(\"I speak only for myself.\")\n\n======================================================================\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNewsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic\n\nFrom: de...@cs.cmu.edu (David Pugh)\n\nSubject: More 1.4 wishlists\n\nDate: Mon, 28 Mar 1994 17:12:13 GMT\n\nIn article <1994Mar28....@apgea.army.mil>,\n\nWilliam R.

One way to make this easier would be to let you click on the\n\nentry on the planets list for what is in the spacedock and have it cycle\n\nthrough the ship types.\n\nOh, yea, one more:\n\nWhen you develop something that reduces pollution and you say yes to\n\nreduce all worlds environmental spending to the minimum, how about if the\n\ncomputer doesn't touch worlds that have non-max terraforming or population?\n\nThat way when you are cloning replacement citizens after transporting them\n\nelsewhere, developing new technology doesn't screw it up.\n\nLIB\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFrom: jajo...@ingr.com (Jeffrey Adam Johnson)\n\nNewsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic\n\nSubject: MOO v1.3 bugs\n\nDate: 24 Feb 1994 18:01:51 GMT\n\nKeywords: MOO, bug report\n\nI've found three bugs while playing Masters of Orion, using the\n\n1.3 patch.

When you develop or exchange either the Improved or Advanced\n\nDeep Space Scanner, it doesn't show you the details on any worlds\n\nthat are within your existing colonies' range. As soon as you\n\nestablish or take over another colony, then the scanner activates\n\nand shows you all unexplored worlds within that new colony's\n\nrange only.\n\n2. I spied on the Darlok's and noticed that they had a Planetology\n\ntechnology called \"Death Environ\". What is that ? I developed\n\n\"Controlled Dead Environment\", and it says \"Controlled Dead Env.\"\n\non my TECH screen ( and on other race's spy screens ).\n\n3.

If a computer player is allied or at war with more than three\n\nother players, then when you do a spy \"Report\" on that computer\n\nplayer, only the first three allies or warring factions are listed.\n\nI noticed this when I was playing a LARGE/5/HARD game as the\n\nPsilons, and the Silicoids managed to get themselves in a war with\n\nthe Alkaris, Mershans, Bulrathis, and Meklars. Lucky me.\n\n2. In the aforementioned game, the 4 computer enemies of the Silicoids\n\nvoted me into Emperorship. However, the date said,\n\n\"In the year 2399, ...\"\n\nI thought elections took place on years with 00,25,50,75. Note that\n\nthis was the second election; the first was 2379.\n\n3. [ from USENET ] People on \"comp.sys.imb.pc.games.strategic\" have\n\nbeen mentioning quite a bit about the computer having overflow\n\nerrors, where the computer will get 32,000 or large negative\n\nnumbers of ships, bases, or even trade BC's. They don't mention\n\nif they're running version 1.3 or not.\n\n[ from Aw Yang Uei (yu...@descartes.waterloo.edu), who sent this\n\nto me via e-mail ]\n\n4. I had one time that Plison offer me to give me some good reward\n\nif I attack his enemy(can't remember who), and I did, and\n\nhe did give me the NFS but when I tried to design new ship and\n\nwanted to put the NFS in, the tech is not there. So I end up\n\nusing exchange Tech. with Plison to get the NFS.\n\n[ From: du...@glue.umd.edu (Tung-Duong Tran-Luu) ]\n\nYou may add the following:\n\n5. If your trade income exceeds 32000, it becomes negative! In my\n\ncase, it became like -31233 roughly, deducting most of my production BC.\n\n6. Your ship cost maintenance can go negative too! I did not keep\n\ntrack of the evolution, but my guess is that it exceeds the 32k\n\n'limit'. Once this happens, in the planet screen, you can see the\n\npercent load as '0.-490%'.\n\n7. Minor bug: on a complete terraformed Orion (capacity 300), if the\n\npopulation size reaches 300m, there is no message displayed for that.\n\nI think it is displayed for all other planets with capacity less than\n\n300.\n\n8. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a feature, but if you play is\n\nSilicoids, you cannot atmosphere terraform, nor fertilize (or\n\ngaia-ize) your planets.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nHere are a few suggestions ( some of them have been echoed on the\n\nUSENET newsgroup \"comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic\" ):\n\n1. On the \"map\" screen, it would be really great if there was some\n\ntype of distinction between planets that:\n\nWere currently within range of your ships\n\nWere currently within range of your ships with reserve fuel tanks\n\nWere out of range\n\n2. The way computer players vote might want to be re-examined. In\n\nthe game mentioned above, in the year 2399 council vote, there\n\nwere 39 votes total. The vote was between the Silicoid (15 votes)\n\nand me (Psilons, 13 votes). As I said, the other 4 computer players\n\n(11 votes among them) were at war with the Silicoid, and so they\n\nall voted for me, which installed me as emperor.\n\nHow about a new algorithm, where computer players, if they're at\n\nwar with another player, will only vote against their antagonist\n\nto the point that the antagonist will be made unable to gain the\n\nemperorship. In the above example, then none of the computer\n\nplayers would have voted for me, since the Silicoid alone didn'\n\nhave 2/3 of the votes ( assuming I as the Psilons wouldn't vote\n\nfor them ).\n\n3. Anytime there's a peace, alliance, or war declared between the\n\ncomputer players, then it would be nice if the GNN newsbot would\n\ninform the human player.\n\nThanks, and keep up the great work !\n\n======================================================================\n\nJeffrey Adam Johnson Internet: jajo...@ingr.com\n\n(\"I speak only for myself.\")\n\n======================================================================\n\nDate: 14 Mar 94 17:42:53 EST\n\nFrom: MicroProse Software <76004...@CompuServe.COM>\n\nTo: <jajo...@ingr.com>\n\nSubject: MoO bug\n\nBill,\n\nThanks for the report, I will pass it along.\n\nBest,\n\nBrian/MicroProse\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFrom: Sullivan <sull...@jmbpo2.bah.com>\n\nNewsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic\n\nSubject: Re: ATerrible MOO v1.3 bug\n\nDate: Wed, 16 Mar 94 12:44:26 PDT\n\nIn article <dliao.762032768@teal>, <dl...@teal.csn.org> writes:\n\n> Newsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic\n\n> From: dl...@teal.csn.org (Daniel Liao)\n\n> Subject: Re: ATerrible MOO v1.3 bug\n\n> Date: Wed, 23 Feb 1994 19:46:08 GMT\n\n>\n\n> rl...@ecst.csuchico.edu ((^_-) (^_^) (-_^)) writes:\n\n>\n\n> > I was playing a Hard/4/Large as Humans last night.

I have had it happen in\n\nboth of the previous versions.\n\nThink about this. The 32000 fleets stay formed as the game goes on.\n\nHow can any empire pay the ship cost for this many huge ships?\n\nI controlled 3/4 of the galaxy in one game and was only able to\n\nmaintain a few hundred huge class ships. (With improved robotic\n\ncontrols V on every planet. And most of the planets at max development)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
