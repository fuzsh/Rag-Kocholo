        "text": "The Orangutan Foundation\n\nOrangutan Foundation are saving the critically endangered orangutan by protecting their tropical forest habitat, working with local communities and promoting research and education. The UK charity was founded in 1990 and has a unique and diverse approach to orangutan conservation.\n\nOrangutan Foundationâs work is carried out by a team of dedicated Indonesian staff who actively protect more than 500,000 acres of critical orangutan habitat with guard posts and forest patrols.Â They rescue orangutans and release them back into the wild, providing veterinary care and monitoring as needed. They have planted more than 60,000 trees in areas of forest, which have been deforested, to help restore the forest ecosystem.\n\nThe orangutan shares its forest home with people who rely on the forests for their livelihood and the priceless and essential ecological services it provides. Orangutan Foundation works closely with local partners to support educational and livelihood projects, which promote sustainable forest use and greater local participation in forest management decisions.\n\nSir Terry Pratchett was a trustee of Orangutan Foundation for many years. He made a vital contribution to orangutan conservation and this legacy continues in the form of the ongoing and generous support from Discworld fans.\n\nwww.orangutan.org.uk\n\nÂ"
