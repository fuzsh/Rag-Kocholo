        "text": "April twenty-eighth is Terry Pratchett day! If you are unfamiliar with this satirist's works, you may have seen the television series based on the novel he wrote with his good friend Neil Gaiman, Good Omens. Sir Terry Pratchett's fiction work spans five decades and many genres, but everything he wrote was funny and layered with history and meaning.\n\nIf you've never read any Pratchett, we've compiled some lists of his work to help you get started! Pratchett was so prolific during his lifetime, guides are very much needed.\n\nIf you've never read any Terry Pratchett, you can start with any of the lists below that interest you. Starting one series or list requires no knowledge of any of Pratchett's other works. Any numbering applied has been done so for marketing purposes.\n\nUse the Always Available Terry Pratchett Author Sampler to browse the author's stand-alone novels, including Good Omens. If you've only read Pratchett's books set in Discworld, it's worth your time to read through this list and visit with some of his other worlds, which include science fiction and satires of classic British literature.\n\nDownload the Complete City Watch of Discworld Series if you want to read Pratchett's hilarious takes on tropes of every pop culture genre from fantasy novels themselves to buddy cop movies. This series is often noted for its critique of policing, issues of racial and gender equity, multiculturalism, and class that were decades ahead of American culture when published.\n\nDownload the Complete Death of Discworld Series if you're a huge fan of Good Omens, and want to read more about the personification of Death that inhabits all Pratchett's works.\n\nDownload the Complete Tiffany Aching Series if you want to start with a perfectly executed and hilarious take on the \"fairies stole my little brother\" tale, and end with the very last story set in Discworld. This series is often marketed as YA fiction, but is so masterfully written that it is enjoyed by readers of all ages.\n\nDownload the Complete Witches of Discworld Series if you're into fantasies that are centered around the supernatural and want to read parodies of Shakespeare and twentieth century new-age practices. The witches series treats the history and tropes surrounding British witchcraft and folklore with both humor and respect.\n\nDownload the Complete Wizards of Discworld Series if you want to read Pratchett's earlier work (the first two novels in this series were the first Pratchett set in Discworld). This series tackles issues of British academia, early computing (these were mostly written in the 1980's), pulp fiction tropes, and world politics."
