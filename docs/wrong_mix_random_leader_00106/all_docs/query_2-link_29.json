        "text": "Terry Pratchett’s early work fits the category of parody, and his later work certainly maintains that early mocking spirit. In his later Discworld novels, however, especially The City Watch sequence, Pratchett turns his mocking lens from generic conventions and tropes to the dangerous ideologies and power structures that permeate contemporary urban life. Edward James calls The City Watch novels “the most political of Pratchett’s works,” and Neil Gaiman reminds us that “beneath any jollity, there is a foundation of fury.” Pratchett’s “fury” and the City Watch novels’ politics together invite us to consider the sequence as social satire and explore what Pratchett may be arguing needs to change, whilst still enjoying the novels for their humour and wonderfully entertaining narrative style.\n\nIn this course, we will explore The City Watch novels and do exactly that: laugh and have fun whilst discussing the underlying messages that Pratchett offers us.\n\nAccess to the listed texts is desirable. Prior knowledge of at least the majority of the listed texts will be assumed.\n\nRequired Texts\n\nThe following works by Terry Pratchett:\n\n• Guards Guards\n\n• Men at Arms\n\n• Feet of Clay\n\n• Jingo\n\n• The Fifth Elephant\n\n• Night Watch\n\n• Thud\n\n• Snuff\n\nCheck out Current and Upcoming offerings from:\n\nDr. Sara Brown\n\nIterations\n\nIf you're interested in this course...\n\nIf you have any questions about the SPACE program, please reach out to [email protected]."
