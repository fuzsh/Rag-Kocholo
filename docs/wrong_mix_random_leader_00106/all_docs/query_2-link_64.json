        "text": "In space, no-one can hear you scream, but laugher is a very different kettle of Babel fish. At least, in the UK it is. If there’s one thing that separates us from America in terms of TV and radio outings for science fiction, fantasy and even horror, it’s the fact that we like our genre liberally sprinkled with jokes.\n\nLook at what’s due or currently in production. The BBC has just announced a new series based on Terry Pratchett’s beloved Discworld comic fantasy novels. There have already been direct adaptions of Pratchett’s early novels in the series by Sky, including The Colour of Magic, starring David Jason as the irascible wizard Rincewind. The planned BBC series looks set to focus on the City Watch, the police force for the sprawling city-state Ankh-Morpork, first introduced in 1989’s Guards! Guards!\n\nAlso filming right now, and again from BBC Studios, is Good Omens, based on the 1990 novel collaboration between Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. It is essentially an odd-couple buddy story as David Tennant and Michael Sheen play a demon and an angel who, having carved out quite cosy lives for themselves on Earth, team up to prevent the forthcoming Biblical Armageddon spoiling it all.\n\nA lot of the very British humour in both of these productions can trace its lineage to the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, arguably the foundation stone of modern comic sci-fi. Douglas Adams’ radio play that became a book that became a TV series is deserved of being labelled a modern classic, and it’s a story that could not have been told anywhere but Britain. Arthur Dent, woefully unprepared for a space adventure in his dressing gown and pyjamas, narrowly escapes the destruction of the Earth to make way for an intergalactic bypass after being rescued by the long-time friend he had no idea was actually an alien.\n\nAnd, lo and behold, Hitchhiker’s returned to the airwaves last week, back where it began as a radio show, with further adventures of Arthur and Ford Prefect (aliens were a bit lazy when taking Earth names; in the new series there’s a new character called Hillman Hunter, played by Ed Byrne) based on original notes by Adams, who died in 2001.\n\nThese aren’t outliers in the world of British TV science fiction and fantasy, though. They’re the norm. Compare them to American shows such as Game of Thrones or the Walking Dead where (intentional) belly laughs are few and far between. The Handmaid’s Tale, apart from a couple of sardonic asides, is unremittingly bleak. Altered Carbon, though based on the work of a British-born author, Richard K Morgan, is pure Blade Runner dystopia. And even the inclusion of a Tribble for eagle-eyed fans in the third episode of the latest iteration of Star Trek, Discovery, hasn’t lightened the mood much.\n\nEven when America has had a fair stab at comedic sci-fi, in the form of the original 1960s series Lost In Space they only go and reboot it into what looks from the previews of next month’s Netflix series to be rather po-faced.\n\nThe British take on Lost in Space was, of course, Red Dwarf, which debuted just about 30 years ago in February 1988, featuring among its cast Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules, and Chris Barrie as the dregs of an interstellar mining ship. Charles played the last human alive after being kept in suspended animation for three million years. Red Dwarf – which has had something of a resurgence recently, the most recent miniseries airing late last year – was played directly for laughs but still managed to become beloved of hardcore geeks.\n\nAnd therein lies the nub of the issue. We just don’t seem to do straight sci-fi or fantasy over here, but what we do as comedy usually works. That’s because it’s true to either its source material or its inspirations. Perhaps, as Brits, we’re too inherently embarrassed to try to play something which we feel at its heart is faintly ridiculous with a straight bat. Even Doctor Who, our most soaraway prime-time genre success, works best when it’s leavened with humour. The stall was set out in the very first episode of the contemporary run in 2005, when Christopher Eccleston’s ninth doctor, after being challenged by Billie Piper’s Rose that he can’t be an alien because he has a northern accent, responds, “Lot’s of planets have a north!”\n\nWhy do we do it? Perhaps the answer lies in one of Adams’ descriptions of Earth from the original Hitchhiker’s: “This planet has — or rather had — a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time.” If British science fiction and fantasy can alleviate that at the same time as performing the basic requirements of the genre – to reflect modern life, to make us think and to be exciting – then I’d rather have one good old giggle than a dozen dour dystopias."
