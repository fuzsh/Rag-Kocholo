I spoke to him on Friday and he was talking about his plans and everything.”\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

He has also been a successful stage director, wrote poetry and became known for his appearances in a Jaffa Cake ad campaign.\n\nHowever, for many fans, Spinetti will always be known for his roles in The Beatles’ three live action films – A Hard Day’s Night, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour."
