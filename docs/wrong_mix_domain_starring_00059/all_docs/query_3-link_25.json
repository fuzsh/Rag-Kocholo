        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAn elderly woman tells her granddaughter the remarkable story of a man who has scissor blades for hands. The ageless man, named Edward, was made by an old inventor who died before finishing his creation. A local saleswoman, Peg, finds Edward living alone at a Gothic mansion which she is trying to sell. Discovering that he presents no harm, she offers to take him home with her. Peg introduces Edward to her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Though Kim is initially fearful of Edward, he falls in love with her, but Kim’s boyfriend is suspicious of their new houseguest. With their neighbours curious about Edward’s story, the family decides to throw a neighbourhood barbecue to welcome him into the community. But is society truly ready to accept this strange new character? ‘Edward Scissorhands’ is a classic fable about empathy, compassion, and outsiders."
