        "text": "We were very saddened to wake up this morning to learn that Victor Spinetti, co-star in all The Beatles movies, passed away yesterday (6/18) at the age of 82. Victor was known and loved by all Beatles fans, as the Hyper Director in A Hard Day’s Night, the Scientist in Help, and the fast talking Sergeant in Magical Mystery Tour. He wasn’t just an actor in their movies, he became a dear friend of The Beatles and very much a part of their inner circle. Victor was a Special Guest at many FESTS over the years. His energy level and the way he told those Beatles stories was unmatched. He was a born actor and it showed. When we invited him to our first Last Vegas FEST in 2007, he was so excited, he said yes immediately. He also joined us a month later in Chicago and he insisted on traveling from the west coast to Chicago by train so he could enjoy the countryside. The gift of being able to get to know him on a personal level will live with us always, as we are sure all who did get to meet him feel the same way. With all the karma and showmanship that was Victor Spinetti, it figures he would take his final bow on Paul’s 70th birthday. He will be greatly missed.\n\nJune 18, 2012\n\nAn Open Letter to Paul McCartney…\n\nDear Paul,\n\nWhat can we say! You have been a vital, integral, important, influential, exhilirating, memorable, and happy part of our lives for almost 50 years. Ever since The Beatles came into our homes on February 9, 1964, there has been a grip that refuses to let go for the baby boomer generation. For the next generations, the first time hearing a Beatles song is an incredible moment as well. It is a feeling we all get every time we hear a Beatles song!\n\nThank you for continuing to create music after the Beatles, bringing us Wings and all of your Solo songs. Your music and life have bee an inspiration to millions of fans around the world.\n\nYour concerts have ALWAYS been phenomenal, but the most enduring part of your legacy is you are getting BETTER! Your stadium shows last summer when we saw you in Yankee Stadium and Wrigley Field were the best, ever! It is so obvious how much you love to perform in front of a live audience. You somehow make everyone in attendance feel you are singing only to them in their own homes. Your singular gift is successfully conveyed to your fans. We look forward to many more years of great concerts!\n\nWe are thrilled to see that you are happily married to Nancy and we wish you all the best in the world!!!\n\nIn 1979, John sent a message to the fans at our FEST. He said, “Tell the fans The Music Was The Thing”. Well, Sir Paul, you have certainly never forgotten that focus, and the world is a better place because of that.\n\nMay you have a fantastic 70th Birthday. You are proof that 70 is the new 50. Keep on rockin’ and Happy Birthday To You!!\n\nLove,\n\nMark, Carol, Michelle & Jessica Lapidos\n\nThe Fest For Beatles Fans\n\nJune 6, 2012 is the 50th anniversary of the Beatles first visit to Abbey Road Studios. The group, consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Pete Best, arrived at what was then called EMI Studios on June 6, 1962, for a commercial test (an evaluation of a signed artist). Two days earlier, the band had signed a recording contract with “The Parlophone Company Limited of Hayes in the County of Middlesex.” The group was paid Musicians Union rates for the June 6 session, indicating that the Beatles were in fact EMI recording artists by the time they arrived at Abbey Road.\n\nEngineers attending the session in Studio Two remember the poor shape of the group’s equipment, particularly Paul’s bass amp, which was deemed unusable due to its rattling and rumbling. Engineers Norman Smith and Ken Townsend improvised and created a bass rig by soldering an input jack to a preamp and combining it with an amp and a large Tannoy speaker taken from Echo Chamber No. 1. A string was tied around John’s amplifier to prevent it from rattling. After resolving these problems, the Abbey Road staff was ready to record the group.\n\nFour songs were recorded that day, three Lennon/McCartney originals – Love Me Do, P.S. I Love You, and Ask Me Why and Besame Mucho, which they had heard on a Coasters record.\n\nThis information was written for us by Fest For Beatles Fans guest author Bruce Spizer, who sends out a weekly email with Beatles information and trivia questions.

Sir Paul, Sir Elton, Stevie Wonder, & others rocked London in a concert that will air tonight at 9:00PM EDT on ABC. We know that Paul performed All My Loving & Let It Be as they showed bits of them on Good Morning America this morning. Set your DVR for this one.\n\nPaul has now made it official. He will be the closing performer in next month’s opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, on July 27th. That should be some spectacle. It may be Paul’s first performance as a very young 70 year old, which he so graciously turns on June 18th. It doesn’t look like Paul will be touring this Summer, but we can hope he will play some gigs this Fall.\n\nRingo begins his 3rd consecutive year of All Starr Band Tours in Niagara, Canada on June 14th. He moved up his show two hours so as not to conflict with a high wire walk over Niagara Falls the same evening! We will be seeing him at his first U.S. date on June 16th at the beautiful Bethel Woods, site of the 1969 Woodstock Festival. Can’t wait. His tour ends at the Greek Theatre in LA on July 21st. That leaves us to wonder if he is considering joining his former bandmate on the 27th. Just a thought or a hope!!! Imagine that!!!\n\nDepending in which country you live, (but let’s not be picky) the most famous album of all time was unleashed on the world by The Beatles. Of course, it was Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. The album had everything, beginning with the music – 13 stellar tracks flowing from one to another with no breaks (except to turn the ‘record’ over). The iconic cover photo announcing their arrival, the lyrics on the back cover (a first), cutouts, and a final chord for the ages. It affected Jimi Hendrix so much that he learned the title track and performed it that weekend in a London club where Paul was in the audience. Johnny Rivers wrote Summer Rain, which include the line “Everybody kept on playing Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band”. She’s Leaving Home made parents cry (and fans, too). And what was that strange sounding song that opened side two – Within You Without You? George was bold enough to write and record it and The Beatles were bold enough to include it on the disc. It only single handedly opened up the entire Western World to a ‘new’ Eastern World sound and culture that is still being felt today. And what about A Day In The Life. It was John and Paul at the height of creativity. By 1965, John & Paul were pretty much writing their own songs with each helping the other to make them better. But not this one. This was a 50/50 effort, John’s melody and lyrics from the day’s headlines, Paul’s middle and the orchestral crescendos in the middle and end of the song. It was the two greatest songwriters of all time collaborating again and it was breathtaking. I am listening to the album right now. Go ahead, have a listen. Oh, the memories!"
