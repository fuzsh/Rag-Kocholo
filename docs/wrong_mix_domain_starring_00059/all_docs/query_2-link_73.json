        "text": "\"Sweet, sweet memories you gave-a me you can't beat the memories you gave-a me\"\n\nMemories it could be said if pieced together make the mosaic of our lives.\n\nOver the years as a journalist I have interviewed a number of people, some I can remember, some I don't, many over the phone but a few have been face to face.\n\nOne of the face to face interviews I did was with Victor Spinetti.\n\nFor those who don't know Victor appeared in around 30 films, including The Return of the Pink Panther, The Krays, Under Milk Wood (with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) and Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World.\n\nBut he is best remembered amongst music fans and especially fans of The Beatles as he appeared in three films with the Beatles, namely, A Hard Day's Night, Help and a Magical Mystery Tour.\n\nHe also co-authored In His Own Write, the play adapted from a book by John Lennon with the Beatle which he also directed at the National Theatre, premiering on 18 June 1968, at the Old Vic.\n\nMany years ago, I think it was in 1999, he was appearing as King Rat in Dick Whittington, at the Royal & Derngate in Northampton.\n\nI went across the road from the newspaper office to interview Victor.\n\nThe conversation touched on a number of bases such as Victor's grandfather walking all the way from Italy to Wales, the influence of Italian frothy coffee and Italian ice cream in Wales and how he used to live above a fish and chip shop in the village of Cwm near Ebbw Vale.\n\nI remember he was engaging, erudite and full of theatre and films stories.\n\nOne of the golden facts which he told me about was the true meaning of I am the Walrus.\n\nHe told me he had never told anyone before and since that day I have not told anyone. I certainly have not seen what I know anywhere.\n\nWhat did he tell you? I think you are shouting!\n\nWhat Victor said about I am the Walrus was what he was told by John Lennon.\n\nReferring to the section which goes: \"Waiting for the van to come\n\n\"Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday\n\n\"Man you've been a naughty boy\n\n\"You let your face grow long...\n\n\"I am the egg man\n\n\"They are the egg men\n\n\"I am the walrus\n\n\"Goo goo g'joob...\"\n\nVictor told me it was about a man (at the time when the song was written John would have been 26), sitting in his kitchen thinking about his wife and son and wondering is this is. Is this all there was to his life. It came down to putting out the bins for collection (Corporation T-shirt) to be collected by the council. Is this it? Is this as good as it gets?\n\nAnd the Goo goo g'joob was a rant against this not knowing a swearing if you want to try and find the answer.\n\nWhen ever I heard I am the Walrus I think of what he told me and the meaning of the song as told to me by Victor.\n\nAs they say in the world of model making: \"Make of that what you want\"."
