        "text": "VETERAN actor Victor Spinetti, best known for his appearances in three Beatles films, has died at the age of 82.\n\nThe Welsh star, who won a Tony for his Broadway role in Oh! What A Lovely War, died yesterday after battling pancreatic cancer.\n\nHis close friend Barbara Windsor led tributes, praising him as a “wonderful man who was full of great stories”.\n\nThe versatile actor was also a successful stage director and became known for his appearances in a Jaffa Cake ad campaign.\n\nHowever, for many, Spinetti will always be known for his roles in The Beatles’ three live action films – A Hard Day’s Night, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.\n\nComedian and actor Rob Brydon also paid tribute to him as “one of the funniest raconteurs there’s ever been – a lovely man who I was lucky to call a friend.”\n\nSpinetti landed his role in the first of the Beatles films after George Harrison and John Lennon saw him in the London production of Oh! What a Lovely War.\n\nHe said of their meeting: “I wasn’t prepared for the fantastic and wonderful reception I got from them.”\n\n“We just sat and talked as if we’d known each other our whole lives.”\n\nSpinetti went on to make more than 30 film appearances, including Under Milk Wood with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.\n\nWindsor added: “He was such a great man. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton wanted him at their parties.\n\n“The Beatles loved him.They wouldn’t do a film without him.”"
