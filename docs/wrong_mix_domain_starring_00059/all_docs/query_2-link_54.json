        "text": "Close friend Barbara Windsor led the tributes to a star who may be best remembered for his roles in three Beatles films, calling him a “wonderful man who was full of great stories”.\n\nShe had seen him only last week, visiting him at his hospice to play him a recording of a Radio 2 programme, Barbara Windsor’s Clubland, in which he had joined her to reminisce about a golden age of London nightclubs. She said his room in Monmouth was full of mandarin-scented candles.\n\n“I joked that it smelled like a tart’s parlour. We laughed and laughed.\n\n“We just chatted and chatted and talked about old things.\n\n“But he said, ‘Let’s not talk about all that, let’s talk about the future’.\n\n“Liz Taylor and Richard Burton wanted him at their parties. The Beatles loved him, they wouldn’t do a film without him.”\n\nWindsor added: “We were such very, very good friends. I’m going to miss him so much.”\n\nComedian and actor Rob Brydon said: “One of the funniest raconteurs there’s ever been – a lovely man who I was lucky to call a friend.”\n\nThe actor, born in Cwm, Wales, was also a successful stage director before winning a Tony for his Broadway role in Oh! What A Lovely War.\n\nHe landed his role in A Hard Day’s Night after John Lennon and George Harrison saw him in the London production of the show. He recalled: “We just sat and talked as if we’d known each other our whole lives.” He then appeared in the two following Beatles films, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour."
