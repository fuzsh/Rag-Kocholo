        "text": "Victor Spinetti, Welsh-born star of stage and screen, has died at the age of 82.\n\nBorn to an Italian-Welsh father and Welsh mother in Ebbw Vale, he was a regular performer in London's West End as well as with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nHe appeared in more than 30 films, including the Beatles' movies and Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.\n\nHe had been diagnosed with cancer.\n\n.\n\nMajority of Kenyans opposed to new fuel taxes and housing levy\n\nSaudi firm enters Kenyan market with eyes on waterproof technology\n\nWhy developers are shunning tenant purchase scheme model Premium\n\nFaulu Bank unveils new solutions for real estate\n\nBanks front low-cost housing as key to higher mortgage uptake\n\nNews of his death prompted a stream of tributes from fans and members of the entertainment world on Twitter.\n\nBBC presenter Nicky Campbell said he was lucky enough to know him, adding: \"He was an amazing talent.\"\n\nActor and director Samuel West tweeted that Spinetti's death was sad news. \"He worked with Zefferelli, Joan Littlewoad and the Beatles; a great career, a lovely man.\"\n\nSpinetti was born in the living quarters above the chip shop his family owned in Cwm, Ebbw Vale. He attended Monmouth School and initially had ambitions to be a teacher.\n\nVictor Spinetti Spinetti achieved fame when he was caught up in the Beatlemania of the 1960s and went to have a creative collaboration with John Lennon\n\nBut after turning to acting he studied at the College of Music and Drama, Cardiff.\n\nHis early stage career saw him make a number of memorable performances with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, whose production of Oh, What a Lovely War! transferred to the West End and Broadway.\n\nIt was his performance in Oh, What a Lovely War! that prompted the Beatles to ask him to appear in A Hard Day's Night (1964), the first of the group's five films.\n\nIt is suggested George Harrison told Spinetti that he had to be in the film because \"my mum will only go to see them if you're in them\".\n\nSpinetti's collaboration with the Beatles saw him appear in their next two productions, Help! (1965) and the hour-long television film Magical Mystery Tour (1967).\n\n'Great eccentric'\n\nHe also worked with John Lennon to turn Lennon's book, In His Own Write, in to a play which he then directed at the National Theatre.\n\nSir Paul McCartney described him as \"the man who makes clouds disappear\".\n\nHis stage career saw him win a Tony award for his Broadway performance in Oh, What a Lovely War!, as well as co-starring with Jack Klugman when The Odd Couple toured London.\n\nHis film career included starring in Zeffirelli's The Taming of the Shrew, again alongside Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and The Return of the Pink Panther as well as The Krays in 1990.\n\nIn his television career, he is perhaps best known for voicing the arch villain character Texas Pete in the S4C animated series SuperTed.\n\nSpinetti was also a noted raconteur whose creative output included poetry, an autobiography and his one-man show, A Very Private Diary.\n\nA BBC documentary on his life and work saw contributions from Barbara Windsor and Rob Brydon praising a \"great Welsh eccentric\".\n\nSpinetti died at a hospice in Monmouth on Monday morning, his agent said."
