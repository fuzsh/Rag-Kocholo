        "text": "Celebrated Welsh actor Victor Spinetti has lost his battle with prostate cancer, aged 82.\n\nThe much-loved film star, who appeared alongside the Beatles in A Hard Day's Night and in more than 30 other films, discovered he had the cancer when he was taken to hospital with a spinal fracture after being injured on stage in a play last year.\n\nVictor, of Ebbw Vale, described his battle with cancer in an interview with Wales on Sunday last month.\n\nAt the time, after being moved to a hospice, he said: \"I'm crumbling. I'm waiting to find out more but they think it might be untreatable.\"\n\nHis long-time friend Barbara Windsor paid tribute to him today, saying: \"He was part of my life. We'd go out for lunch and have a great gossip together.\"\n\nRead Victor Spinetti's final interview with Wales on Sunday last month\n\nSpinetti’s agent, Barry Burnett, said he had died in a hospice in Monmouth on Tuesday morning.\n\nHe said: \"He had cancer for a year, but he was very cheerful to the end. I spoke to him on Friday and he was talking about his plans and everything.\"\n\nThroughout his long and illustrious career, Spinetti always maintained that the boy born above his family chip shop in Cwm, Ebbw Vale had never stopped being grounded.\n\n\"I can’t stand it when people get so ... how do you put it ... lah de dah,\" he once told the Western Mail.\n\n\"Do you know what I mean? When they get too big for their boots, forget where they’re from and can’t be bothered to speak to someone. I mean, bloody hell, I’m from Cwm!\n\n\"I’ve done it all but I can tell you something for nothing – the bigger the star the more natural they are.\n\n\"These aren’t the ones who have to be entertained or go to all those fancy dinner parties all the time.\n\n\"The Beatles were the most natural, nice boys in the world.\n\nNext page: Barbara Windsor pays tribute, and full obituary\n\nAmong Victor's visitors during the last days of his life at the Monmouth hospice was close friend Barbara Windsor, on whose Radio 2 show he made a recent appearance - one of his final recordings.\n\nWindsor said she and husband Scott Mitchell visited Spinetti on Thursday.\n\n“He had Jo Malone candles and sprays in the room – it had to be mandarin. I joked that it smelt like a tart’s parlour. We laughed and laughed.\n\n“We just chatted and chatted and talked about old things. But he said, ’let’s not talk about all that, let’s talk about the future’.\n\n“What he was trying to say was that everything was happy in his room. I was happy to see him. He didn’t look ill. He looked great. He was swearing a lot, like that would get rid of the illness, and we just laughed.”\n\nWindsor added: “We were such very, very good friends. We were both on stage together on Broadway in Oh! What A Lovely War. We were both up for the Tony Award. He got it. I didn’t but we had a great time.”\n\nShe added: “Liz Taylor and Richard Burton wanted him at their parties. He was a magnificent man, a wonderful man who was full of great stories.\n\n“The Beatles loved him. They wouldn’t do a film without him.”\n\nThe actress, who has been presenting a two-part radio series about Clubland, added: “He was on my Radio 2 show and I got the nurses to wake him up to hear it.\n\n“Some of the nurses didn’t know who he was so I wanted them to hear it too.”\n\nShe added: “He was part of my life and I’m going to miss him so much. We’d go out for lunch and have a great gossip together.\n\n“He was such a good actor because he took notice of people and used their characters. He portrayed them wonderfully, whatever he did.\n\n“In America everyone knew who he was because of the Beatles films. He loved it.”\n\nRead more: Two years ago, as he toured a new show around the UK, Victor told the Western Mail he was having the most fun he had had for years\n\nNext page: Obituary\n\nBorn September 2, 1933, Victor Spinetti was one of the most talented and popular comic and classical actors of his generation.It was his friendship with the Beatles at the height of their fame which put him on the map.\n\nHe acted in and directed several West End hits, made prolific appearances on television and played the \"Mad Jaffa Cake Eater\" in a series of TV biscuit commercials, as well as writing poetry and prose.\n\nSpinetti was born in Cwm, Wales, on September 2, 1933, attended Monmouth School and the Cardiff College of Music and Drama of which in later life he became a fellow.\n\nHowever, his working life began as a waiter and factory worker before he sprang to prominence in three Beatles films of the 1960s: Hard Day’s Night, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.\n\nThe late George Harrison once said to him: \"You have got to be in all our films. If you are not in them, my mum won’t come and see them because she fancies you.\"\n\nDuring his versatile career, Spinetti appeared in more than 30 films, including Zeffirelli’s The Taming of the Shrew, Under Milk Wood, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Voyage of the Damned, The Return of the Pink Panther, and The Krays.\n\nHis work with Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop produced many memorable performances including Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’Be and Oh! What a Lovely War, which transferred to New York, and for which he won a Tony Award for his role as an obnoxious drill sergeant.\n\nHis West End appearances included Expresso Bongo, Candide, Cat Among the Pigeons and Chitty, Chitty, Bang Bang, He also played the principal male character in the feminist play, Vagina Rex.\n\nHe also appeared on Broadway in The Hostage and The Philanthropist. With the Royal Shakespeare Company he appeared as Lord Foppington in The Relapse and as the archbishop in Richard III.\n\nSpinetti also co-authored John Lennon In His Own Write, which he directed at the National Theatre. He also directed productions of Jesus Christ Superstar and Hair.\n\nHis many TV appearances included Take My Wife, and the sitcom An Actor’s Life For Me.\n\nSpinetti also wrote poetry, notably Watchers Along The Mall, and prose which have appeared in several publications.\n\nHis memoirs, Victor Spinetti Up Front, was filled with anecdotes, including the claim that Princess Margaret was instrumental in securing the necessary censor permission for the first run of Oh! What a Lovely War."
