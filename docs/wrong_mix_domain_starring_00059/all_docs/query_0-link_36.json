        "text": "546009 As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, \"Jack Warner...considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers.\"\n\n546010 In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't \"even know where the hell the cartoon studio is\", and Harry added, \"The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse,\" a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions.\n\n546011 Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece.\n\n546012 As Thomas noted, \"They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros.\"\n\n546013 Jack Warner's tumultuous relationship with his brother, Harry, worsened in February 1956, when Harry learned of Jack's decision to sell the Warner Bros.' pre-1950 sound films to Associated Artists Productions (soon to merge with United Artists Television) for the modest sum of $21 million. (\n\n546014 The deal did not include the black-and-white Looney Tunes films, the first Merrie Melodie film, Lady, Play Your Mandolin!, and the color cartoons released between August 1, 1948, and the close of 1949.\n\n546015 The black-and-white cartoons and the silent films were sold to Guild Films under license of Sunset Productions, which was established by Warners as its television subsidiary in the same manner as Columbia Pictures' Screen Gems, and the aforementioned 1948–1949 color cartoons remained with Warner Brothers). \"This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone,\" Harry exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal.\n\n546016 The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year.\n\n546017 In July 1956, Jack, Harry, and Albert announced they were putting Warner Bros. on the market.\n\n546018 Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate that purchased control of the company.\n\n546019 By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother's dealings, it was too late.\n\n546020 Jack, as the company's largest stockholder, appointed himself as the new company president.\n\n546021 Shortly after the deal was closed, Jack Warner announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be \"directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible\". The two brothers had often argued, and earlier in the decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, \"I'll get you for this, you son of a bitch\" and threatening to kill him.\n\n546022 This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry; he never spoke to Jack again.\n\n546023 When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack avoided the funeral and departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes.\n\n546024 Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, \"I didn't give a shit about Harry.\"\n\n546025 At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.\n\n547000 In the 1960s, Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes.\n\n547001 In February 1962, he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical, My Fair Lady, paying an unprecedented $6.5 million.\n\n547002 The previous owner, CBS director William S. Paley, set terms that included 50 percent of the distributor's gross profits \"plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract.\"\n\n547003 Despite the \"outrageous\" purchase price, and the ungenerous terms of the contract, the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros.,\n\n547004 securing the studio $12 million in profits.\n\n547005 Warner was criticized for choosing a non-singing star, Audrey Hepburn, to play the leading role of Eliza Doolittle; indeed, the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to Julie Andrews, who had played Eliza on Broadway and the London Stage, for Mary Poppins, while Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated.\n\n547006 However, the film won the best-picture Academy Award for 1964.\n\n547007 In 1965, Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee's searing play about a destructive marriage.\n\n547008 From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy.\n\n547009 Ernest Lehman's script, which was extremely faithful to Albee's play, stretched the U.S. film industry's Production Code to the limit.\n\n547010 Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him \"uneasy\". \"I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight,\" Valenti wrote.\n\n547011 Meanwhile, Lehman and the film's director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white.\n\n547012 These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an \"Adults only\" label and restrict tickets sales accordingly.\n\n547013 At this, the MPAA, wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker, gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively.\n\n547014 Upon its release, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike.\n\n547015 It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966.\n\n548000 Despite these achievements, Jack grew weary of making films, and he sold a substantial amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966.\n\n548001 Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.'s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio.\n\n548002 Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement.\n\n548003 His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to \"slow down\", and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order.\n\n548004 Warner sold his 1.6 million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe's Camelot.\n\n548005 The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24 million (equivalent to $165 million today). Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, \"Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?\"\n\n548006 At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures' Harry Cohn.\n\n548007 Warner's decision to sell came at a time when he was losing the formidable power that he once took for granted.\n\n548008 He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including Louis B. Mayer, David O. Selznick, and Samuel Goldwyn – were pushed out by stockholders who \"sought scapegoats for dwindling profits\". Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become \"more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films\", a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul.\n\n548009 By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed.\n\n548010 Evidence of Warner's eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film, Bonnie and Clyde, a film project he initially \"hated\". Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of Camelot, Warner was unable to persuade director Joshua Logan to cast Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in the leading roles.\n\n548011 Instead, Logan selected Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, a move that contributed to the project's critical – and commercial – failure.\n\n548012 Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner's ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay's length, despite the fact that the studio executive had already agreed with the film's unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong.\n\n548013 Warner officially retired from his studio in 1969.\n\n549000 Warner remained active as an independent producer until the early 1970s.\n\n549001 to run some of the company's distributions and exhibition division.\n\n549002 Among his last productions was another film adaptation of a Broadway musical, 1776.\n\n549003 Before the film's release, Warner showed a preview cut to U.S. President Richard Nixon, who recommended substantial changes, including the removal of two songs that struck him as veiled criticisms of the ongoing Vietnam War.\n\n549004 Without consulting the film's director, Peter H. Hunt, Warner ordered the film re-edited.\n\n549005 In November 1972, the film opened to enthusiastic audiences at Radio City Music Hall, but it fared poorly in theaters.\n\n549006 Faced with a polarized political climate Americans, few were drawn to \"a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics\". Warner's efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive.\n\n549007 During an interview with talk show host Merv Griffin, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against \"pinko communists\". This proved to be Warner's first and last television interview.\n\n549008 On October 14, 1914, Warner married Irma Solomons, the adolescent daughter of one of San Francisco's pioneer Jewish families.\n\n549009 Irma Warner gave birth to the couple's only child, Jack M. Warner on March 27, 1916.\n\n549010 Jack Warner named the child after himself, disregarding an Ashkenazi Jewish custom that children should not be named after living relatives.\n\n549011 Although his son bore a different middle initial, he \"has been called Junior all his life\". The marriage ended in 1935, when Warner left his wife for another woman, Ann Page.\n\n549012 Together, Warner and Ann had a daughter named Barbara.\n\n549013 Irma Warner sued her husband for divorce (a scandalous move at the time) on the grounds of desertion.\n\n549014 Jack's older brother, Harry, reflected the Warner family feelings about the marriage when he exclaimed, \"Thank God our mother didn't live to see this\". Warner married Ann after the divorce.\n\n549015 The Warners, who took Irma's side in the affair, refused to accept Ann as a family member.\n\n549016 In the wake of this falling out, Jack's relationship with his son, Jack Warner Jr., also became strained.\n\n550000 In the late 1950s, Warner was almost killed in a car accident that left him in a coma for several days.\n\n550001 On August 5, 1958, after an evening of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, Warner's Alfa Romeo roadster swerved into the path of a coal truck on a stretch of road located near the seaside villa of Prince Aly Khan.\n\n550002 Warner was thrown from the car, which burst into flames upon impact.\n\n550003 Shortly after the accident, his son, Jack Jr., joined other family members in France, where the unconscious studio head was hospitalized.\n\n550004 In an interview with reporters, Jack Jr. suggested that his father was dying.\n\n550005 Then, during a visit to his father's hospital room, the young man offended Ann Warner, whom he largely blamed for his parents' divorce.\n\n550006 When Warner regained consciousness, he was enraged by reports of his son's behavior, and their \"tenuous\" relationship came to an end.\n\n550007 On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was informed, by Jack Sr.'s lawyer Arnold Grant, that the elder Warner had released him from the company.\n\n550008 When he attempted to report for work, studio guards denied him entry.\n\n550009 The two men never achieved a reconciliation, and Jack Jr. is not mentioned in his father's 1964 autobiography.\n\n550010 Warner made no pretense of faithfulness to his wife, Ann, and kept a series of mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n550011 The most enduring of these \"girlfriends\" was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a \"startling\" resemblance to Warner's second wife.\n\n550012 The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair.\n\n550013 Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast.\n\n550014 In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side.\n\n550015 In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: \"He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak.\"\n\n551000 An ardent Republican, Jack Warner nevertheless supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in the early 1930s.\n\n551001 Later in the decade, he made common cause with opponents of Nazi Germany, overlooking ideological differences with those who held leftist political views.\n\n551002 In 1947, however, Warner served as a \"friendly witness\" for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), thereby lending support to allegations of a \"Red\" infiltration of Hollywood.\n\n551003 Warner felt that Communists were responsible for the studio's month-long strike that occurred in the fall of 1946, and on his own initiative, he provided the names of a dozen screenwriters who were dismissed because of suspected Communist sympathies, a move that effectively destroyed their careers.\n\n551004 Former studio employees named by Warner included Alvah Bessie, Howard Koch, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Robert Rossen, Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Irwin Shaw.\n\n551005 As one biographer observed, Warner \"was furious when Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Paul Henreid and John Huston joined other members of the stellar Committee for the First Amendment in a flight to Washington to preach against the threat to free expression\". Lester D. Friedman noted that Warner's response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who \"feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry\". Warner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full-page ads in The New York Times \"to proclaim why Nixon should be elected\". In the wake of Nixon's loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium in honor of the president-elect.\n\n551006 Several weeks later, Warner received a phone call from the new chief executive's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan's book, PT 109, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy's exploits during World War II. \"\n\n551007 I don't think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon,\" Warner said later. \"I would have voted for both of them if I could. You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, but I love everybody.\"\n\n551008 In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the Vietnam War.\n\n552000 By the end of 1973, those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented.\n\n552001 Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his own office, Warner retired.\n\n552002 In 1974, the former studio chief suffered a stroke that left him blind and enfeebled.\n\n552003 During the next several years, he gradually lost the ability to speak and became unresponsive to friends and relatives.\n\n552004 Finally, on August 13, 1978, Warner was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he died of a heart inflammation (edema) on September 9.\n\n552005 He was 86 years old.\n\n552006 A funeral service was held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged.\n\n552007 He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California.\n\n552008 Jack Warner left behind an estate estimated at $15 million.\n\n552009 Much of the Warner estate, including property and memorabilia, was bequeathed to his widow, Ann.\n\n552010 Warner, however, left $200,000 to his estranged son, Jack Jr.,\n\n552011 perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will.\n\n552012 In the days following Warner's death, newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of \"the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nicklelodeons\" and went on to revolutionize American cinema.\n\n552013 A front-page story in Warner's adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family's pre-Hollywood struggles in Ohio, describing how Jack Warner drove a wagon for his father's business when he was only seven years old.\n\n552014 The late movie [ mogul ] was widely eulogized for his role in \"shaping Hollywood's 'Golden Age'\". Several months after Warner's death, a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California.\n\n552015 The event, called \"The Colonel: An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L. Warner\", drew Hollywood notables such as entertainers Olivia de Havilland and Debbie Reynolds, and cartoon voice actor Mel Blanc.\n\n552016 Blanc closed the event with a rendition of Porky Pig's famous farewell, \"A-bee-a-bee-a-bee–that's all, folks.\"\n\n552017 In recognition of his contributions to the motion picture industry, Jack Warner was accorded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n552018 He is also represented on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto, which honours outstanding Canadians from all fields.\n\n585000 John Christopher \"Johnny\" Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor, film producer, and musician.\n\n585001 He has won the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actor.\n\n585002 Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 21 Jump Street, becoming a teen idol.\n\n585003 Dissatisfied with that status, Depp turned to film for more challenging roles; he played the title character of the acclaimed Edward Scissorhands (1990) and later found box office success in films such as Sleepy Hollow (1999), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Alice in Wonderland (2010), Rango (2011) and the Pirates of the Caribbean film series (2003–present). He has collaborated with director and friend Tim Burton in eight films; the most recent being Dark Shadows (2012). Depp has gained acclaim for his portrayals of such people as Ed Wood in Ed Wood, Joseph D. Pistone in Donnie Brasco, Hunter S. Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, George Jung in Blow, and the bank robber John Dillinger in Michael Mann's Public Enemies.\n\n585004 Films featuring Depp have grossed over $3.1billion at the United States box office and over $7.6 billion worldwide.\n\n585005 He has been nominated for top awards many times, winning the Best Actor Awards from the Golden Globes for Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and from the Screen Actors Guild for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\n\n585006 He also has garnered a sex symbol status in American cinema, being twice named as the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine in 2003 and 2009.\n\n585007 He has been listed in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records as the highest paid actor, with $75million.\n\n585008 Depp was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, and raised in Florida, as the youngest of four children of Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells), a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer.\n\n585009 The two divorced when Johnny was 15.\n\n585010 The BBC genealogical TV program Who Do You Think You Are?, traced Depp's family name, Deppes, to 14th-century French Huguenots living in England.\n\n585011 In a 2002 interview, Depp stated that he believed he has Native American ancestry; in 2011, he specified, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\"\n\n585012 The family moved frequently during Depp's childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970.\n\n585013 In 1978, Depp's parents divorced.\n\n585014 His mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\". Depp engaged in self-harm when he was young, due to the stress of dealing with family problems, which resulted in several self-inflicted scars.\n\n585015 In a 1993 interview, he reflected on his self-injury by saying \"My body is a journal in a way. It's like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\".\n\n590000 Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price.\n\n590001 His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood.\n\n590002 Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\"\n\n590003 At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking.\n\n590004 This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Producer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment.\n\n590005 Depp, however agrees with Rudin's statement.\n\n590006 According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton's inability to communicate as a teenager.\n\n590007 Ed Wood reflected Burton's relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi). Depp's next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci.\n\n590008 Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton's battle with the Hollywood studio system.\n\n590009 For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone.\n\n590010 Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\"\n\n590011 Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, in which he played Willy Wonka.\n\n590012 Depp modeled the character's hair on Anna Wintour.\n\n590013 The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception.\n\n590014 Gene Wilder, who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film, initially criticized this version.\n\n590015 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride, for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September.\n\n590016 Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\n590017 Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000.\n\n590018 Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale's treatment.\n\n590019 He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\n\n590020 Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim's lyrics.\n\n590021 Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach.\n\n590022 In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp's soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he's been hiding... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors... it's hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\"\n\n590023 In his introduction to Burton on Burton, a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman.\n\n590024 In 2012, he starred in the Burton-directed film Dark Shadows, a based on the 1966–1971 gothic soap opera of the same name, alongside fellow Tim Burton regular Helena Bonham Carter, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green.\n\n633000 The Beatles evolved from Lennon's first band, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by him in September 1956 when he was 15, and began as a skiffle group.\n\n633001 By the summer of 1957 the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll.\n\n633002 Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter's Church garden fête, after which McCartney was asked to join the band.\n\n633003 McCartney says that Aunt Mimi: \"was very aware that John's friends were lower class\", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon.\n\n633004 According to Paul's brother Mike, McCartney's father was also disapproving, declaring Lennon would get his son \"into trouble\"; although he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys' front room at 20 Forthlin Road.\n\n633005 During this time, the 18-year-old Lennon wrote his first song, \"Hello Little Girl\", a UK top 10 hit for The Fourmost nearly five years later.\n\n633006 George Harrison joined the band as lead guitarist, even though Lennon thought Harrison (at 14 years old) was too young to join the band, so McCartney engineered a second audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played \"Raunchy\" for Lennon.\n\n633007 Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist.\n\n633008 Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became \"The Beatles\" in early 1960.\n\n633009 In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, Germany, and desperately in need of a drummer, asked Pete Best to join them.\n\n633010 Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead.\n\n633011 After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962.\n\n633012 Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug, as well as amphetamines, as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.\n\n634000 Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager from 1962, had no prior experience of artist management, but nevertheless had a strong influence on their early dress code and attitude on stage.\n\n634001 Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me\". McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and drummer Ringo Starr replaced Best, completing the four-piece line-up that would endure until the group's break-up in 1970.\n\n634002 The band's first single, \"Love Me Do\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts.\n\n634003 They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, Twist and Shout.\n\n634004 The Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks.\n\n634005 With few exceptions - one being the album title itself - Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \"We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that - to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: \"He was like our own little Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest\". The Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK during the beginning of 1963.\n\n634006 Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April.\n\n634007 During their Royal Variety Show performance, attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at his audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands ... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery.\"\n\n634008 After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom.\n\n634009 A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works.\n\n634010 The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1965.\n\n635000 Lennon grew concerned that fans attending Beatles' concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result.\n\n635001 Lennon's \"Help!\" expressed his own feelings in 1965: \"I meant it ... It was me singing 'help'\". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his \"Fat Elvis\" period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change.\n\n635002 The following January he was unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon, Harrison and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug.\n\n635003 When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects.\n\n635004 Later, in an elevator at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire: \"We were all screaming ... hot and hysterical.\"\n\n635005 A few months later in March, during an interview with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon remarked, \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink ... We're more popular than Jesus now-I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.\"\n\n635006 The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later.\n\n635007 The furore that followed-burning of Beatles' records, Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against Lennon-contributed to the band's decision to stop touring.\n\n635008 Deprived of the routine of live performances after their final commercial concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon felt lost and considered leaving the band.\n\n635009 Since his involuntary introduction to LSD in January, he had made increasing use of the drug, and was almost constantly under its influence for much of the year.\n\n635010 According to biographer Ian MacDonald, Lennon's continuous experience with LSD during the year brought him \"close to erasing his identity\". 1967 saw the release of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", hailed by Time magazine for its \"astonishing inventiveness\", and the group's landmark album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which revealed Lennon's lyrics contrasting strongly with the simple love songs of the Lennon-McCartney's early years.\n\n636000 In August, after having been introduced to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the group attended a weekend of personal instruction at his Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor, Wales, and were informed of Epstein's death during the seminar. \"\n\n636001 I knew we were in trouble then\", Lennon said later. \"I didn't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared\". They later travelled to Maharishi's ashram in India for further guidance, where they composed most of the songs for The Beatles and Abbey Road.\n\n636002 The anti-war, black comedy How I Won the War, featuring Lennon's only appearance in a non-Beatles' full-length film, was shown in cinemas in October 1967.\n\n636003 McCartney organised the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film Magical Mystery Tour, released in December that year.\n\n636004 While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop, its soundtrack release, featuring Lennon's acclaimed, Lewis Carroll-inspired \"I Am the Walrus\", was a success.\n\n636005 With Epstein gone, the band members became increasingly involved in business activities, and in February 1968 they formed Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies.\n\n636006 Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve, \"artistic freedom within a business structure\", but his increased drug experimentation and growing preoccupation with Yoko Ono, and McCartney's own marriage plans, left Apple in need of professional management.\n\n636007 Lennon asked Lord Beeching to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records.\n\n636008 Lennon approached Allen Klein, who had managed The Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion.\n\n636009 Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr, but McCartney never signed the management contract.\n\n636010 At the end of 1968, Lennon featured in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (not released until 1996) in the role of a Dirty Mac band member.\n\n636011 The supergroup, composed of Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell, also backed a vocal performance by Ono in the film.\n\n636012 Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called \"Bag One\" depicting scenes from their honeymoon, eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated.\n\n636013 Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins (known more for its cover than for its music), Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions and Wedding Album.\n\n636014 In 1969, they formed the Plastic Ono Band, releasing Live Peace in Toronto 1969.\n\n636015 In protest at Britain's involvement in the Nigerian Civil War, Lennon returned his MBE medal to the Queen, though this had no effect on his MBE status, which could not be renounced.\n\n636016 Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles \"Give Peace a Chance\" (widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam-War anthem in 1969), \"Cold Turkey\" (documenting his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin) and \"Instant Karma!\".\n\n637000 Lennon left the group in September 1969, and agreed not to inform the media while the band renegotiated their recording contract, but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970.\n\n637001 Lennon's reaction was, \"Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!\"\n\n637002 He later wrote, \"I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that.\"\n\n637003 In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, \"I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record.\"\n\n637004 He spoke too of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr \"got fed up with being sidemen for Paul ... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?\"\n\n637005 In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Dr. Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California.\n\n637006 Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London.\n\n637007 Lennon's emotional debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with high praise.\n\n637008 Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\"\n\n637009 The album featured the songs \"Mother\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \"Working Class Hero\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \"you're still fucking peasants\", fell foul of broadcasters.\n\n637010 The same year, Tariq Ali's revolutionary political views, expressed when he interviewed Lennon, inspired the singer to write \"Power to the People\". Lennon also became involved with Ali during a protest against Oz magazine's prosecution for alleged obscenity.\n\n637011 Lennon denounced the proceedings as \"disgusting fascism\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \"God Save Us/Do the Oz\" and joined marches in support of the magazine.\n\n638000 Sample of \"Imagine\", Lennon's \"most famous post-Beatles' track.\"\n\n638001 Like \"Give Peace a Chance\", the song became an anti-war anthem, but its lyrics offended religious groups.\n\n638002 Lennon's explanation was, \"If you can imagine a world at peace, with no denominations of religion-not without religion, but without this 'my God is bigger than your God' thing-then it can be true.\"\n\n638003 With Lennon's next album, Imagine (1971), critical response was more guarded.\n\n638004 Rolling Stone reported that \"it contains a substantial portion of good music\" but warned of the possibility that \"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\". The album's title track would become an anthem for anti-war movements, while another, \"How Do You Sleep?\", was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics from Ram that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono.\n\n638005 However, Lennon softened his stance in the mid-1970s and said he had written \"How Do You Sleep?\" about himself.\n\n638006 He said in 1980: \"I used my resentment against Paul... to create a song... not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta... I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and the Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write 'How Do You Sleep'. I don't really go' round with those thoughts in my head all the time\". Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971, and in December released \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". The new year saw the Nixon Administration take what it called a \"strategic counter-measure\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda, embarking on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him.\n\n638007 In 1972, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin after McGovern lost to Nixon.\n\n638008 Embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, Lennon was denied permanent residency in the US (which wouldn't be resolved until 1976). Depressed, Lennon got intoxicated and had sex with a female guest, leaving Ono embarrassed.\n\n638009 Her song \"Death of Samantha\" was inspired by the incident.\n\n639000 Recorded as a collaboration with Ono and with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory, Some Time in New York City was released in 1972.\n\n639001 Containing songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's problems obtaining a green card, the album was poorly received-unlistenable, according to one critic. \"\n\n639002 Woman Is the Nigger of the World\", released as a US single from the album the same year, was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show.\n\n639003 Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \"nigger\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility.\n\n639004 Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances.\n\n639005 While Lennon was recording Mind Games (1973), he and Ono decided to separate.\n\n639006 The ensuing 18-month period apart, which he later called his \"lost weekend\", was spent in Los Angeles and New York in the company of May Pang.\n\n639007 Mind Games, credited to the \"Plastic U.F.Ono Band\", was released in November 1973.\n\n639008 Lennon also contributed \"I'm the Greatest\", to Starr's album Ringo (1973), released the same month. (\n\n639009 An alternate take, from the same 1973 Ringo sessions, with Lennon providing a guide vocal, appears on John Lennon Anthology). In early 1974, Lennon was drinking heavily and his alcohol-fuelled antics with Harry Nilsson made headlines.\n\n639010 Two widely publicised incidents occurred at The Troubadour club in March, the first when Lennon placed a menstruation \"towel\" on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress, and the second, two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers.\n\n639011 Lennon decided to produce Nilsson's album Pussy Cats and Pang rented a Los Angeles beach house for all the musicians but after a month of further debauchery, with the recording sessions in chaos, Lennon moved to New York with Pang to finish work on the album.\n\n639012 In April, Lennon had produced the Mick Jagger song \"Too Many Cooks (Spoil the Soup)\" which was, for contractual reasons, to remain unreleased for more than 30 years.\n\n639013 Pang supplied the recording for its eventual inclusion on The Very Best of Mick Jagger (2007).\n\n640000 Settled back in New York, Lennon recorded the album Walls and Bridges. Released in October 1974, it yielded his only number-one non-Beatles single in his lifetime, \"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night\", featuring Elton John on backing vocals and piano.\n\n640001 A second single from the album, \"#9 Dream\", followed before the end of the year.\n\n640002 Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974) again saw assistance from Lennon, who wrote the title track and played piano.\n\n640003 On 28 November, Lennon made a surprise guest appearance at Elton John's Thanksgiving concert at Madison Square Garden, in fulfilment of his promise to join the singer in a live show if \"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night\"-a song whose commercial potential Lennon had doubted-reached number one.\n\n640004 Lennon performed the song along with \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"I Saw Her Standing There\", which he introduced as \"a song by an old estranged fiancée of mine called Paul\". Lennon co-wrote \"Fame\", David Bowie's first US number one, and provided guitar and backing vocals for the January 1975 recording.\n\n640005 The same month, Elton John topped the charts with his cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", featuring Lennon on guitar and back-up vocals (Lennon is credited on the single under the moniker of \"Dr. Winston O'Boogie\"). He and Ono were reunited shortly afterwards. Lennon released Rock 'n' Roll (1975), an album of cover songs, in February. \"\n\n640006 Stand by Me\", taken from the album and a US and UK hit, became his last single for five years.\n\n640007 He made what would be his final stage appearance in the ATV special A Salute to Lew Grade, recorded on 18 April and televised in June.\n\n640008 Playing acoustic guitar and backed by an eight-piece band, Lennon performed two songs from Rock 'n' Roll (\"Stand By Me\", which was not broadcast, and \"Slippin' and Slidin'\") followed by \"Imagine\". The band, known as Etc., wore masks behind their heads, a dig by Lennon who thought Grade was two-faced.\n\n641000 With the birth of his second son Sean on 9 October 1975, Lennon took on the role of househusband, beginning what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry during which he gave all his attention to his family.\n\n641001 Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks.\n\n641002 He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6 am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him.\n\n641003 He wrote \"Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)\" for Starr's Ringo's Rotogravure (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980.\n\n641004 He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, \"we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby as much as we can until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family.\"\n\n641005 During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed \"mad stuff\", all of which would be published posthumously.\n\n641006 Lennon emerged from retirement in October 1980 with the single \"(Just Like) Starting Over\", followed the next month by the album Double Fantasy, which contained songs written during a journey to Bermuda on a 43-foot sailing boat the previous June, that reflected his fulfilment in his new-found stable family life.\n\n641007 Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned follow-up album Milk and Honey (released posthumously in 1984). Released jointly with Ono, Double Fantasy was not well received, drawing comments such as Melody Maker's \" indulgent sterility... a godawful yawn\". At around 10:50 pm on 8 December 1980, as Lennon and Ono returned to their New York apartment in The Dakota, Mark David Chapman shot Lennon in the back four times at the entrance to the building.\n\n641008 Lennon was taken to the emergency room of nearby Roosevelt Hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:07 pm.\n\n641009 Earlier that evening, Lennon had autographed a copy of Double Fantasy for Chapman.\n\n657000 Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, and philanthropist.\n\n657001 Under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, Carey released her self-titled debut studio album Mariah Carey in 1990; it went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n657002 Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993 and success with hit records Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993), and Merry Christmas (1994), Carey was established as Columbia's highest-selling act.\n\n657003 Daydream (1995) made music history when its second single \"One Sweet Day\", a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and remains the longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history.\n\n657004 During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her R&B and pop beginnings and slowly traversed into hip hop.\n\n657005 This musical change became evident with the release of Butterfly (1997), at which time Carey had separated from Mottola.\n\n657006 Carey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a record-breaking $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records.\n\n657007 Before the release of her first feature film Glitter (2001), she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion.\n\n657008 Following the film's poor reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career.\n\n657009 She signed a multi-million dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single \"We Belong Together\" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named \"Song of the Decade\" by Billboard.\n\n657010 Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received starring role in Precious (2009); she was awarded the \"Breakthrough Performance Award\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and Black Reel and NAACP Image Award multi nominations\n\n658000 In a career spanning over two decades, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\n658001 In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards.\n\n658002 Carey was also named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000.\n\n658003 According to the Recording Industry Association of America, she is the third best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums.\n\n658004 With the release of \"Touch My Body\" (2008), Carey gained her eighteenth number one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist.\n\n658005 In 2012, Carey was ranked second on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\". Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won five Grammy Awards, 17 World Music Awards, 11 American Music Awards, and 31 Billboard Music Awards.\n\n658006 Referred to as the \"songbird supreme\" by the Guinness World Records, she is famed for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.\n\n658007 Mariah Carey was born in Northport, New York, on March 27, 1970.\n\n658008 Her father, Alfred Roy, was of African American and Venezuelan (including Afro-Venezuelan) descent, while her mother, Patricia (née Hickey), is of white Irish descent.\n\n658009 The last name Carey was the product of a name-change by her Venezuelan grandfather Francisco Nuñez after emigrating to New York.\n\n658010 Patricia's father had died while she was young; however, she inherited his passion for music.\n\n658011 She developed a career as an occasional opera singer and vocal coach, and met Alfred in 1960.\n\n658012 As he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer, the couple wed later that year, and moved into a small suburb in New York.\n\n658013 After the pair's elopement, Patricia's family disowned her, due to marrying a man of color.\n\n658014 Carey later explained that growing up, she felt a notion of neglect from her maternal family, a mark that affected her greatly: \"So later I was like, 'Well, where does this leave me? Am I a bad person?' You know. It's still not that common to be a multi-racial person, but I'm happy with the combination of things that I am.\"\n\n658015 During the interval of years in between Carey's older sister Alison and the singer's birth, the Carey family experienced personal struggles within the community due to their ethnicity.\n\n658016 Carey's name was derived from the song \"They Call the Wind Mariah\", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon.\n\n658017 When Carey was three years old, her parents divorced due to the increasingly strenuous nature of their marriage.\n\n659000 After their separation, Alison moved in with her father, while the other two children remained with their mother.\n\n659001 As the years passed, Carey would grow apart from her father, and would later stop seeing him altogether.\n\n659002 By the age of four, Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night, and just sing from her heart, and try and find peace within the music.\n\n659003 During elementary school, she would excel in subjects that she enjoyed, such as literature, art and music, while not finding interest in other subjects.\n\n659004 After several years of financial struggles, Patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in New York.\n\n659005 Carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them, thus starting as a singer-songwriter while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York.\n\n659006 Even from a young age, Carey excelled in her music, and demonstrated usage of the whistle register, though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother.\n\n659007 Though introducing her daughter to the world of classical opera, Patricia never pressured Carey to pursue a career in the genre, as she never seemed interested in that world of music.\n\n659008 Carey recalled that she kept her singer-songwriter works a secret and noted that Patricia had \"never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel'. I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me.\"\n\n659009 While a high school student, Carey developed a relationship with Gavin Christopher, with whom she shared musical aspirations.\n\n659010 The songwriting duo needed an assistant who could play the keyboard: \"We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled upon Ben [Margulies]. Ben came to the studio, and he really couldn't play the keyboards very well - he was really more of a drummer - but after that day, we kept in touch, and we sort of clicked as writers.\"\n\n659011 Carey and Christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his father's store during Carey's senior year.\n\n659012 After composing their first song together, \"Here We Go Round Again\", which Carey described as having a Motown-vibe, they continued writing material for a full-length demo.\n\n659013 Following her graduation from high school, Carey's mother remarried, which ultimately prompted her to move out from their apartment.\n\n659014 She began living in a one bedroom studio in Manhattan, which she shared with four other female students.\n\n659015 During this time, Carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants, usually getting fired after two-week intervals.\n\n659016 While requiring work to pay for her rent, Carey's mind and effort still remained with her musical ambitions, as she continued working late into the night with Margulies, in hopes of completing a demo that could be passed on to record executives.\n\n659017 After completing her four song demo tape, Carey attempted to pass it to music labels, but was met with failure each time.\n\n659018 Shortly thereafter, she was introduced to rising pop singer Brenda K. Starr.\n\n66000 Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand.\n\n660000 As Carey's friendship with Starr grew, so did her interest in helping Carey succeed in the industry.\n\n660001 On a Friday night in December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a record executives gala, where she handed her demo tape to Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia Records, who listened to it on his way back home.\n\n660002 After the first two songs, he became so enamored at the sound and quality of Carey's voice that he turned around and returned to the event, only to find that she had left.\n\n660003 In what has been widely described by critics as a modern day Cinderella-like tale, after searching for Carey for two weeks, and eventually contacting her through Starr's management, he immediately signed her and began mapping out her debut into mainstream music.\n\n660004 While she maintained that she wanted to continue working with Margulies, Mottola enlisted top producers of the time, including Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.\n\n660005 Mottola and the staff at Columbia had planned to market Carey as the main female pop artist on their roster, competing with the likes of Whitney Houston and Madonna, who were signed to Arista and Sire Records respectively.\n\n660006 After the completion of her debut album, titled Mariah Carey, Columbia spent an upward of $1 million to promote it.\n\n660007 Though opening with weak sales, the album eventually reached the top of the Billboard 200, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd annual Grammy Awards.\n\n660008 Mariah Carey stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks, and she won the Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance awards for her single \"Vision of Love\". The album yielded an additional three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, following the four-week number-one run of \"Vision of Love\". Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles reach number one.\n\n660009 Mariah Carey finished as the best-selling album in the United States in 1991, while totaling sales of over 15 million copies.\n\n66001 She is the sister of actor James Haven, niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor, and goddaughter of actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.\n\n66002 On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent, and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.\n\n66003 Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois; her only known Native ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649.\n\n66004 After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.\n\n66005 As a child, Jolie regularly saw movies with her mother and later explained that this had inspired her interest in acting; she had not been influenced by her father.\n\n66006 When she was six years old, her mother and stepfather, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later.\n\n66007 She then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.\n\n66008 At the age of 14, Jolie dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director.\n\n66009 She began working as a fashion model, modeling mainly in Los Angeles, New York, and London.\n\n66010 During this period, she wore black clothing, experimented with knife play, and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend.\n\n66011 Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home.\n\n66012 She graduated from high school and returned to theater studies, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, \"I am still at heart - and always will be - just a punk kid with tattoos.\"\n\n661000 Carey began recording her second studio album, eventually titled Emotions, in 1991.\n\n661001 The album, as Carey described it, paid homage to Motown soul music, as she felt the need to pay tribute to the type of music and genre that truly influenced her as a struggling child.\n\n661002 For the project, Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Clivillés and Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory.\n\n661003 However, Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a contract Carey had signed prior to her signing with Columbia, agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well.\n\n661004 However, when the time came to write music for Emotions, Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album.\n\n661005 Subsequently, Margulies filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways.\n\n661006 On September 17, 1991, Emotions was released around the world, and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor.\n\n661007 While praised for Carey's improved songwriting, production and new sound, the album was criticized for its material, which many felt was noticeably weaker than her debut.\n\n661008 Though the album managed sales of over eight million copies globally, Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.\n\n661009 As they had done after the release of her debut, critics again questioned whether Carey would embark on a world tour in promotion for her material.\n\n661010 Although Carey explained that due to her stage fright, and the general strenuous nature of her songs, a tour sounded very daunting, speculation grew that Carey was a \"studio worm\", and that she wasn't capable of producing the perfect pitch and 5-octave vocal range for which she was known.\n\n661011 In hopes of putting any claims of her being a manufactured artist to rest, Carey and Walter Afanasieff decided to book an appearance on MTV Unplugged, a television program aired by MTV.\n\n661012 The show's purpose was to present name artists, and feature them \"unplugged\" or stripped of studio equipment.\n\n661013 While Carey felt strongly of her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content to that point would be included.\n\n661014 Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected.\n\n661015 They chose \"I'll Be There\", a song made popular by The Jackson 5 in 1970, rehearsing it few times before the night of the show.\n\n661016 On March 16, 1992, Carey recorded a seven-piece set-list at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.\n\n661017 The revue was met with critical acclaim, leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would.\n\n661018 The revue's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album.\n\n661019 Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.\n\n661020 The EP proved to be a success, contrary to critics and speculations that Carey was just a studio artist, and was given a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and managed Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.\n\n662000 During early 1993, Carey began working on her third studio album, Music Box.\n\n662001 After Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey and Columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound, in order to appeal to a wider audience.\n\n662002 During Carey's writing sessions, she began working mostly with Afanasieff, with whom she co-wrote and produced most of Music Box.\n\n662003 During the album's recording, Carey and Mottola became romantically involved.\n\n662004 They wed in a lavish ceremony on June 5, 1993, with several high-profile guests including Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Gloria Estefan and Ozzy Osbourne.\n\n662005 On August 31, Music Box was released around the world, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200.\n\n662006 The album was met with mixed reception from music critics; while many praised the album's pop influence and strong content, others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range.\n\n662007 Ron Wynn from Allmusic described Carey's different form of singing on the album: \"It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach, but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion.\"\n\n662008 The album's second single, \"Hero\", would eventually come to be one of Carey's most popular and inspirational songs of her career.\n\n662009 The song became Carey's eighth chart topper in the United States, and began expanding Carey's popularity throughout Europe.\n\n662010 With the release of the album's third single, Carey achieved several career milestones.\n\n662011 Her cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\" became her first number one single in Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n662012 Music Box spent prolonged periods at number one on the album charts of several countries, and eventually became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with worldwide sales of over 32 million copies.\n\n662013 After declining to tour for her past two albums, Carey agreed to embark on a short stateside string of concerts, titled the Music Box Tour.\n\n662014 Spanning only six dates across North America, the short but successful tour was a large step for Carey, who dreaded the hassle of touring.\n\n662015 Following Music Box, Carey took a relatively large period of time away from the public eye, and began working on an unknown project throughout 1994.\n\n662016 The project was kept very secretive until Billboard announced on their October issue that Carey would release a holiday album later that year.\n\n662017 In late 1994, Carey recorded a duet with Luther Vandross; a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's \"Endless Love\". By that point, Columbia felt Carey had already established herself as a pop singer, and vocalist, but wanted to try and feature her as more of an entertainer.\n\n662018 Through the release of Merry Christmas, Columbia hoped that audiences would buy Carey's material solely for her name and reputation, and squash fears of her being a typical pop singer.\n\n662019 The album was released on November 1, 1994, on the same day that the album's first single, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", was released.\n\n662020 The album eventually became the best-selling Christmas album of all time, with global sales reaching over 15 million copies.\n\n662021 Additionally, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was critically lauded, and is considered \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon.\"\n\n662022 Rolling Stone described it as a \"holiday standard\", and ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list.\n\n662023 Commercially, it became the best-selling holiday ringtone of all time, and the best-selling single by a non-Asian artist in Japan, selling over 2.1 million units (both ringtone and digital download). By the end of the holiday season of 1994, Carey and Afanasieff had already begun writing material for her next studio album, which would be released in the fall of the following year.\n\n663000 Released on October 3, 1995, Daydream combined the pop sensibilities of Music Box with downbeat R&B and hip hop influences.\n\n663001 The album's second single, \"One Sweet Day\" was inspired by the death of David Cole, as well as her sister Alison, who had contracted AIDS.\n\n663002 The song remained atop the Hot 100 for a record-breaking sixteen weeks, and became the longest running number one song in history.\n\n663003 Daydream became her biggest-selling album in the United States, and became her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, following Music Box.\n\n663004 The album again was the best-seller by an international artist in Japan, shipping over 2.2 million copies, and eventually reaching global sales of over 25 million units.\n\n663005 Critically, the album was heralded as Carey's best to date; The New York Times named it one of 1995's best albums, and wrote, \"best cuts bring R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement [...] Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.\"\n\n663006 Carey once again opted to embark on a short world tour titled Daydream World Tour.\n\n663007 It had seven dates, three in Japan and four throughout Europe.\n\n663008 When tickets went on sale, Carey set records when all 150,000 tickets for her three shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under three hours, breaking the previous record held by The Rolling Stones.\n\n663009 Due to the album's success, Carey won two awards at the American Music Awards for her solo efforts: Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist.\n\n663010 Daydream and its singles were respectively nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards.\n\n663011 Carey, along with Boyz II Men, opened the event with a performance of \"One Sweet Day\". However, Carey did not receive any award, prompting her to comment \"What can you do? I will never be disappointed again. After I sat through the whole show and didn't win once, I can handle anything.\"\n\n663012 In 1995, due to Daydream's enormous Japanese sales, Billboard declared Carey the \"Overseas Artist of the Year\" in Japan.\n\n664000 After the release of Daydream and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time.\n\n664001 Carey's relationship with Mottola began to deteriorate, due to their growing creative differences in terms of her albums, as well as his controlling nature.\n\n664002 With each following album, and her continual established fame and popularity, Carey began to take more initiative and control with her music, and started infusing more genres into her work.\n\n664003 During mid-1997, Carey was well underway, writing and recording material for her next album, Butterfly (1997). She sought to work with other producers and writers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Kamaal Fareed, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters.\n\n664004 During the album's recording, Carey and Mottola separated, with Carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom, and a new lease on life.\n\n664005 Aside from the album's different approach, critics took notice of Carey's altered style of singing, which she described as breathy vocals.\n\n664006 Her new-found style of singing was met with mixed reception; some critics felt is was a sign of maturity, that she didn't feel the need to always show off her upper range, while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice.\n\n664007 The album's lead single, \"Honey\", and its accompanying music video, introduced a more overtly sexual image than Carey had ever demonstrated, and furthered reports of her freedom from Mottola.\n\n664008 Carey stated that Butterfly marked the point when she attained full creative control over her music.\n\n664009 However, she added, \"I don't think that it's that much of a departure from what I've done in the past [...] It's not like I went psycho and thought I would be a rapper. Personally, this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do.\"\n\n664010 Growing creative differences with producer Afanasieff continued, and eventually ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's material.\n\n664011 Reviews for Butterfly were generally positive: Rolling Stone wrote, \"It's not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry [...] but the predominant mood of 'Butterfly' is one of coolly erotic reverie. [... Except \"Outside\" the album sounds] very 1997. [...] Carey has spread her wings and she's ready to fly.\"\n\n664012 Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever\", and heralded Butterfly as her \"best record and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\"\n\n664013 The album was a commercial success, although not to the degree of her previous three albums.\n\n665000 Toward the turn of the millennium, Carey began developing other projects, many of which she wasn't able to during her marriage.\n\n665001 On April 14, 1998, Carey partook in the VH1 Divas benefit concert, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan and Carole King.\n\n665002 Carey had begun developing a film project All That Glitters, later re-titled to simply Glitter, and intended her songwriting to other projects, such as Men in Black (1997) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). After Glitter fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project, and began writing material for a new album.\n\n665003 The executives at Sony Music, the parent company of Carey's label Columbia, wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the commercially favorable holiday season.\n\n665004 However, they disagreed as to what content and singles should constitute the album.\n\n665005 Sony wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the United States, and her international chart toppers on the European versions, void of any new material, while Carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs, not just her most commercial.\n\n665006 She felt that not including any new material would result in cheating her fans, therefore including four new songs that she had recorded.\n\n665007 While compromised, Carey often expressed distaste towards the album's song selection, expressing her disappointment in the omission of her \"favorite songs\". The album titled, #1's (1998), featured a duet with Whitney Houston, \"When You Believe\", and was included on the soundtrack for The Prince of Egypt (1998). During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song \"When You Believe\" for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt.\n\n665008 In an interview with Ebony, Houston described working with Carey, as well as their growing friendship: \"Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang together before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's good to know that two ladies of soul and music can still be friends.\" #\n\n665009 1's became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, and placing as the only international artist to accomplish this feat.\n\n665010 When describing Carey's popularity in Japan throughout the 1990s, author Chris Nickson compared it to Beatlemania in the 1960s.\n\n665011 The album sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan after only the first three months, and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist, while amassing global sales of over 17 million copies.\n\n666000 During the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album of her record contract with Sony, her ex-husband's label.\n\n666001 During this time, Carey's strained relationship with Sony affected her work with writing partner Afanasieff, who had worked extensively with Carey throughout the first half of her career.\n\n666002 She felt Mottola was trying to separate her from Afanasieff, in hopes of keeping their relationship permanently strained.\n\n666003 Due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had now developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums.\n\n666004 The album, titled Rainbow (1999), found Carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters, such as Jay-Z and DJ Clue?.\n\n666005 Carey also wrote two ballads with David Foster and Diane Warren, whom she seemingly used to replace Afanasieff.\n\n666006 Rainbow was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first week sales of her career at the time, however debuting at number two on the Billboard 200.\n\n666007 Throughout early-2000, Carey's troubled relationship with Columbia grew, as they halted promotion after the album's first two singles.\n\n666008 They felt Rainbow didn't have any strong single to be released, whereas Carey wanted a ballad regarding personal and inner strength released.\n\n666009 The difference in opinion led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her webpage in early and mid-2000, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations.\n\n666010 One of the messages Carey left on her page read: \"Basically, a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.\"\n\n666011 Fearing to lose their label's highest seller, Sony chose to release the song.\n\n666012 Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which made charting extremely difficult and unlikely.\n\n666013 Critical reception of Rainbow was generally enthusiastic, with the Sunday Herald saying that the album \"sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with R&B heavyweights like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Usher [...] It's a polished collection of pop-soul.\"\n\n666014 Vibe magazine expressed similar sentiments, writing, \"She pulls out all stops [...] Rainbow will garner even more adoration\". Though a commercial success, Rainbow became Carey's lowest selling album to that point in her career.\n\n667000 After she received Billboard's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium, Carey parted from Columbia and signed a record-breaking $100 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records). Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project.\n\n667001 She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres, in order to go hand-in-hand with the film's setting.\n\n667002 She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives.\n\n667003 Just a few months later, in July 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown.\n\n667004 She had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked, and her relationship with the Latin icon Luis Miguel ended.\n\n667005 In an interview the following year, she said, \"I was with people who didn't really know me and I had no personal assistant. I'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that.\"\n\n667006 Due to the pressure from the media, her heavy work schedule and the split from Miguel, Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings.\n\n667007 On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble.\n\n667008 While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention.\n\n667009 Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: \"I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.\"\n\n667010 Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been \"obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly\" when she posted the letters.\n\n668000 On July 26, she was suddenly hospitalized, citing \"extreme exhaustion\" and a \"physical and emotional breakdown\". Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.\n\n668001 Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.\n\n668002 Consequently, critics suggested that in delaying Glitter, hype for the project would have largely subsided, and would possibly hurt both ticket and album sales.\n\n668003 When discussing the project's weak commercial reaction, Carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release, its postponement, as well as the soundtrack having been released on September 11.\n\n668004 Critics panned Glitter, as well as its accompanying soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially.\n\n668005 The accompanying soundtrack album, Glitter, became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point.\n\n668006 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch dismissed it as \"an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful.\"\n\n668007 Following the negative cloud that was ensuing Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her unprecedented $100 million five-album record deal with Virgin Records (EMI Records) was bought out for $50 million.\n\n668008 Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year.\n\n668009 Carey later said that her time at Virgin was \"a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.\"\n\n668010 Later that year, she signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million, and launched the record label MonarC.\n\n668011 To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.\n\n669000 In 2002, Carey was cast in the independent film, WiseGirls, alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant.\n\n669001 It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received generally negative critical response, though Carey's portrayal of the character was praised; Roger Friedman of Fox News referred to her as \"a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium\", and wrote, \"Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs\". Later that year, Carey performed the American national anthem to rave reviews at the Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n669002 Towards the end of 2002, Carey released her next studio album Charmbracelet, which she said marked \"a new lease on life\" for her.\n\n669003 Though released in the wake of Glitter and Carey's return to the music scene, sales of Charmbracelet were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism.\n\n669004 Joan Anderson from The Boston Globe declared the album \"the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos\", while Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine expressed similar sentiments and wrote, \"What is a greater problem is that Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs.\"\n\n669005 In an attempt to \"relaunch\" her career following the poor reception to Glitter, as well as her breakdown, Carey announced a world tour in April 2003.\n\n669006 Lasting over eight months, the Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, became her most extensive tour to date, spanning sixty-nine shows around the world.\n\n669007 Throughout the United States, the shows were done in smaller theaters, and something more Broadway-influenced, \"It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. You experience a night with me.\"\n\n669008 However, while smaller productions were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed at stadiums in Asia and Europe, performing for a crowd of over, 35,000, in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China.\n\n669009 In the United Kingdom, it became Carey's first tour to feature shows outside of London, booking arena stops in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.\n\n669010 Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers, with many complimenting the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the production as a whole.\n\n670000 Throughout 2004, Carey focused on composing material for her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The album found Carey working predominantly with Jermaine Dupri, as well as Bryan-Michael Cox, Manuel Seal, The Neptunes and Kanye West.\n\n670001 The album debuted atop the charts in several countries, and was warmly accepted by critics.\n\n670002 Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as \"cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again\", while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\"\n\n670003 The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\" song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over.\n\n670004 music critics heralded the song as her \"return to form\", as well as the \"return of The Voice\", while many felt it would revive \"faith\" in Carey's potential as a balladeer. \"\n\n670005 We Belong Together\" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n670006 After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\". Billboard listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time.\n\n670007 Besides its chart success, the song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.\n\n670008 During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as \"We Belong Together\" remained at number one, and her next single, \"Shake It Off\" moved into the number two spot. (\n\n670009 Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a \"featured\" singer on the #2 single.)\n\n670010 On the Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey.\n\n670011 Billboard listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on The Billboard Hot 100-Time All All-Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Billboard.\n\n670012 The album earned ten Grammy Award nominations in 2006-07: eight in 2006 for the original release (the most received by Carey in a single year), and two in 2007 for the Ultra Platinum Edition (from which \"Don't Forget About Us\" became her seventeenth #1 hit). In 2006 Carey won Best Contemporary R&B Album for The Emancipation of Mimi, as well as Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song for \"We Belong Together\". The Emancipation of Mimi was the best-selling album in the United States in 2005, with nearly five million units sold.\n\n670013 It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album since Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill in 1996.\n\n670014 At the end of 2005, the IFPI reported that The Emancipation of Mimi had sold more than 7.7 million copies globally, and was the second best-selling album of the year after Coldplay's X&Y.\n\n670015 It was the best-selling album worldwide by a solo and female artist.\n\n670016 To date, The Emancipation of Mimi has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.\n\n670017 At the 48th Grammy Awards, Carey performed a medley of \"We Belong Together\" and \"Fly Like a Bird\". The performance earned the night's only standing ovation, prompting Teri Hatcher, who was presenting the next award, to exclaim, \"It's like we've all just been saved!\"\n\n671000 In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi: The Voice, The Hits, The Tour after a \"Carey-centric fan's\" music diary.\n\n671001 The tour spanned forty stops, with thirty-two in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan.\n\n671002 Tickets for the tour went on sale on June 2, 2006, with prices ranging from $95 to $150 USD, and featured Carey's long-time friend Randy Jackson as the tour's musical director.\n\n671003 Carey's performances consisted of old songs from her catalog as well as her newest singles.\n\n671004 The tour received warm critical reaction from music critics and concert goers, many of which celebrated the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the show as a whole.\n\n671005 However, critics felt the show's excesses, such as Carey's often costume changes and pre-filmed clips, were unnecessary distractions.\n\n671006 The tour proved successful, with Carey playing to over 60,000 fans in the two stops in Tunis alone.\n\n671007 Midway through the tour, Carey booked a two-night concert engagement in Hong Kong, which was scheduled to take place following her Japanese shows.\n\n671008 The shows were cancelled, however, after tickets went on sale.\n\n671009 According to Carey's then-manager Benny Medina, the cancellation was due to the concert promoter's refusal to pay Carey her agreed-upon compensation.\n\n671010 The promoter instead blamed poor ticket sales (allegedly, only 4,000 tickets had sold) and \"Carey's outrageous demands\". Carey ultimately sued the promoter, claiming $1 million in damages due to the concert's abrupt cancellation. \"\n\n671011 The Adventures of Mimi\" DVD was released in November 2007 internationally and December 2007 in the US.\n\n671012 By spring 2007, Carey had begun to work on her eleventh studio album, E=MC², in a private villa in Anguilla.\n\n671013 When asked about the album title's meaning, Carey said \"Einstein's theory? Physics? Me? Hello! ...Of course I'm poking fun.\"\n\n671014 She characterized it as \"Emancipation of Mimi to the second power\", and said that she was \"freer\" on this album than any other.\n\n671015 Although E=MC² was well received by most critics, some of them criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on The Emancipation of Mimi.\n\n671016 Two weeks before the album's release, \"Touch My Body\", the record's lead single reached the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology.\n\n671017 Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles.\n\n671018 Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.\"\n\n671019 Carey has also had notable success on international charts, though not to the same degree as in the United States.\n\n671020 Thus far, she has had two #1 singles in Britain, two in Australia, and six in Canada.\n\n671021 Her highest-charting single in Japan peaked at number two.\n\n104000 Jolie suffered episodes of suicidal depression throughout her teens and early twenties.\n\n104001 She felt isolated at Beverly Hills High School among the children of some of the area's affluent families, as her mother survived on a more modest income, and she was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.\n\n104002 She found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she started to self-harm; later commenting, \"I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.\"\n\n104003 She also began experimenting with drugs; by the age of 20, she had tried \"just about every drug possible,\" including heroin.\n\n104004 Jolie has had a difficult relationship with her father.\n\n104005 Due to Voight's marital infidelity and the resulting breakup of her parents' marriage, she was estranged from her father for many years.\n\n104006 They reconciled and he appeared with her in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.\n\n104007 In July 2002, Jolie — who had long used her middle name as a stage name to establish her own identity as an actress — filed a request to legally drop Voight as her surname, which was granted on September 12, 2002.\n\n104008 In August of that year, Voight claimed his daughter had \"serious mental problems\" on Access Hollywood.\n\n104009 In response, Jolie released a statement in which she indicated that she no longer wished to pursue a relationship with her father.\n\n104010 She explained that because she had adopted her son Maddox, she did not think it was healthy for her to associate with Voight.\n\n104011 In the wake of her beloved mother's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, Jolie again reconciled with her father after a six-year estrangement.\n\n105000 When she was seven years old, Jolie had a small part in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), a movie co-written by and starring her father, Jon Voight.\n\n105001 She committed to acting at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that she was \"too dark.\"\n\n105002 She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's \"Stand by My Woman\" (1991), Antonello Venditti's \"Alta Marea\" (1991), The Lemonheads's \"It's About Time\" (1993), and Meat Loaf's \"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them.\n\n105003 Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both \"drama queens.\"\n\n105004 Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the low-budget, straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as Casella \"Cash\" Reese, a near-human robot, designed to seduce her way into a rival manufacturer's headquarters and then self-detonate.\n\n105005 Jolie was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.\n\n105006 Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), Jolie starred as Kate \"Acid Burn\" Libby in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times wrote, \"Kate (Angelina Jolie) stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. Despite her sullen posturing, which is all this role requires, Ms. Jolie has the sweetly cherubic looks of her father, Jon Voight.\"\n\n105007 The movie failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.\n\n106000 She next appeared in the 1996 comedy Love Is All There Is, a modern-day loose adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in The Bronx, New York.\n\n106001 In the road movie Mojave Moon (1996) she played a young woman who falls for Danny Aiello's middle-aged character, while he develops feelings for her mother, played by Anne Archer.\n\n106002 That same year, Jolie also portrayed Margret \"Legs\" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film Foxfire after they beat up a teacher who has sexually harassed them.\n\n106003 The Los Angeles Times wrote about her performance, \"It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.\"\n\n106004 In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld.\n\n106005 The movie was not well received by critics; Roger Ebert noted that \"Angelina Jolie [...] finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be Blossom's girlfriend, and maybe she is.\"\n\n106006 She then appeared in the television film True Women (1997), a historical romantic drama set in the American West and based on the book by Janice Woods Windle.\n\n106007 That year, she also appeared as a stripper in the music video for \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\" by the Rolling Stones.\n\n107000 Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997). She portrayed Cornelia Wallace, the second wife of Alabama Governor George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise.\n\n107001 The film was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film.\n\n107002 Jolie also received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance.\n\n107003 In 1998, Jolie starred in HBO's Gia, portraying supermodel Gia Carangi.\n\n107004 The film chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s.\n\n107005 Vanessa Vance from Reel.com noted, \"Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal - filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation - and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.\"\n\n107006 For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award.\n\n107007 She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\n114000 Katharine Houghton Hepburn (May 12, 1907 - June 29, 2003) was an American actress of film, stage, and television.\n\n114001 Known for her headstrong independence and spirited personality, Hepburn's career as a Hollywood leading lady spanned more than 60 years.\n\n114002 Her work came in a range of genres, from screwball comedy to literary drama, and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actress-a record for any performer.\n\n114003 Hepburn's characters were often strong, sophisticated women with a hidden vulnerability.\n\n114004 Raised in Connecticut by wealthy, progressive parents, Hepburn began to act while studying at Bryn Mawr College.\n\n114005 After four years in the theatre, her favorable reviews of work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood.\n\n114006 Her early years in the film industry were marked with success, including an Academy Award for her third picture, Morning Glory (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures.\n\n114007 In 1938 she was labeled \"box office poison\". Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story, which she sold on the condition that she be the star.\n\n114008 In the 1940s she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy.\n\n114009 The screen-partnership spanned 25 years, and produced nine movies.\n\n115000 Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she regularly appeared in Shakespeare stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles.\n\n115001 She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African Queen (1951), a persona the public embraced.\n\n115002 Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). In the 1970s she began appearing in television movies, which became the focus of her career in later life.\n\n115003 She remained active into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87.\n\n115004 After a period of inactivity and ill-health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.\n\n115005 Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to societal expectations of women.\n\n115006 She was outspoken, assertive, athletic, and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so.\n\n115007 She married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently.\n\n115008 A 26-year affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public.\n\n115009 With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn came to epitomize the \"modern woman\" in 20th-centu"
