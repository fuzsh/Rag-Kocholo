When re-released in Mexico several years later, no longer through MGM, the new distributor reverted to the original title and art, with the one unique creative idea being a warped and tinted still. From design all the way to paper quality, it’s a pretty dramatic drop-off between the two versions. Starring Vincent Price (The Last Man on Earth; Edward Scissorhands), Peter Lorre (M; The Maltese Falcon), Basil Rathbone (The Hound of the Baskervilles; Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet), Debra Paget (The Ten Commandments; Love Me Tender) and Joyce Jameson (Death Race 2000; The Outlaw Josey Wales). Cinematography by Floyd Crosby (High Noon; X: The Man with X-Ray Eyes), written by Richard Matheson (The Legend of Hell House; Duel). Produced and directed by Roger Corman (The House of Usher; Frankenstein Unbound)\".",
