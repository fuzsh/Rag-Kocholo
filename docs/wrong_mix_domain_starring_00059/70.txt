Welsh actor Victor Spinetti, whose notable roles included appearances in three Beatles films, has died at the age of 82.

The performer, who was in a string of acclaimed movies, as well as taking parts in the West End and on Broadway, had been battling cancer.

Spinetti's agent, Barry Burnett, said: "He had cancer for a year, but he was very cheerful to the end. I spoke to him on Friday and he was talking about his plans and everything."

The versatile actor, who acted in more than 30 films, was able to easily turn his hand from serious classical roles to comedy performances and parts in sitcoms.

He has also been a successful stage director, wrote poetry and made appearances in a Jaffa Cakes advertising campaign.

Spinetti was in Franco Zeffirelli's The Taming Of The Shrew, and The Return Of The Pink Panther but, for many fans, Spinetti will always be known for his roles in The Beatles' three live action films - A Hard Day's Night, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.

The actor was handed a Tony Award for his 1963 interpretation of the drill sergeant major in Oh! What A Lovely War and he co-authored In His Own Write, a play based on the book by John Lennon, which he also directed at the National Theatre in London.
