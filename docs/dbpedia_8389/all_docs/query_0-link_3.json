After studying at Besançon he was admitted to the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1821. In 1823 he obtained his licentiate in sciences and in October of that year was employed by Marshal Gouvion-Saint-Cyr as literary adviser to the Marshal and tutor to his son. In 1829 he obtained his doctorate in science with a main thesis in mechanics and a secondary one in astronomy. Through the sponsorship of Poisson in 1834 he obtained the professorship in analysis and mechanics at Lyon."
