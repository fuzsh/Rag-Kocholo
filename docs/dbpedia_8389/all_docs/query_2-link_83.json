Rappel du titre complet : Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth by Augustin Cournot 1838. Translated by Nathaniel T. Bacon with an Essay on Cournot and mathematical Economics and a Bibliography of Mathematical Economics by Irving Fisher [ Inscribed : \"G. H Bousquet Don d'Irving Fisher\" ] From Irving Fisher's library. Joseph Schumpeter described him as \"the greatest economist the United States has ever produced\". Good (waterstains on cover, a few manuscript annotations by G. H. Bousquet). Annotation manuscrite en garde : \"G. H. Bousquet Don d'Irving Fisher\" [ unidentified manuscript indication in french : Gift from Irving Fisher ]. Le professeur Georges-H. Bousquet (1900-1978) fut notamment professeur aux facultés d'Alger puis de Bordeaux. Juriste de formation initiale (docteur en droit en 1923 avec une thèse sur \"L'évolution sociale en Hollande 1914-1922\"), il devint un spécialiste de questions économiques, proche de Pareto et Schumpeter, ainsi qu'un islamisant de l'école de Goldziher et Snouck-Hugronje. Il fut proche de son maître en sociologie Vilfredo Pareto, dont il servit fortement la pensée, avec lequel il échangea une correspondance et qu'il rencontra, en Suisse.En septembre 1923, à Vienne et par l'intermédiaire de Paul Lazarsfeld, il fut présenté à son autre maître et ami Joseph Schumpeter. \"A ce moment, Schumpeter avait 40 ans. Il était alors totalement ignoré en France, mais connu aux Etats-Unis où il avait été invité à professer quelque temps, et en Angleterre, où il avait eu également l'occasion de se faire entendre\". Georges Bousquet sera fasciné par l'oeuvre de Schumpeter, qu'il fera notamment découvrir, tant par ses articles que par les discussions, à l'économiste François Perroux. Dans les années 1933-1934, les Bousquet et Schumpeter seront en contact permanent à Harvard, où Schumpeter était devenu professeur, et ou G.-H. Bousquet avait été envoyé faire un séjour de recherche, avec le soutien de la fondation Rockfeller. C'est à cette occasion que Bousquet rencontre Irving Fisher (1867-1947), l'un des premiers économistes américains de l'école néoclassique. On peut signaler que G.-H. Bousquet est l'un des quelques économistes français contemporains à être plusieurs fois cité par Schumpeter dans sa monumentale Histoire de l'Analyse Economique. Langue: Anglais.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Very Good. Cournot, Augustin. (IRVING FISHER) Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth by Augustin Cournot, 1838.New York, Macmillan Company, 1927. First edition thus. 7.5\"x 5\", Xxiv, 208pp, folding plate. Cloth. Solid, clean copy. VG condition, though the lettering on the spine is about half faded away. [++] Contains the following additions by Irving Fisher to the original first edition in English from twenty years earlier: (1) (a note on Cournot, pp ix-xii; (2) \"Notes on Cournot's Mathematics\" (reprinted from the Quarterly Journal of Economics Jan 1898), pp xiii-xxiv; and (3) a \"Bibliography of Mathematical Economics\" pp 173-208 [++] It is noted on the front pastedown by the original owner, Dr. E. Hasselmann, that this book was a gift made to him by Irving Fisher in January 1928. This is presumably Hasselmann's handwriting (and definitely not Fisher's)--the original owner simply noted that the book came to him from Fisher. Pretty nice.\n\nFirst edition in English of Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses, originally published in French in 1838, here published as part of the series of Economic Classics edited by W. J. Ashley. This edition is of particular interest because of Fisher's biographical essay on Cournot and the bibliography of mathematical economics. Fisher E-1165. Octavo. Original green cloth, spine lettered in gilt. With folding table of ten figures. The folding table supplied in modern facsimile. Light rubbing at extremities, front pastedown renewed: a good copy."
