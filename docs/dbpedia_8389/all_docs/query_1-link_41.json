        "text": "Antoine Augustin Cournot Udayan Roy http://myweb.liu.edu/~uroy/ March 2007\n\nAntoine Augustin Cournot (1801-1877) • Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth (1838) • New School HET page Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nTheory of the Firm • Cournot pioneered the modern price theory for industries consisting of profit-maximizing firms. • This is basically the theory taught today in introductory microeconomics courses Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nMathematical Methods • He introduced differential calculus and the associated mathematics of maximization into economic analysis. • These eventually became the indispensable tools of economic analysis. Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nDemand • Cournot introduced the demand function… • This is a mathematical function, F(p), that represents the idea that the quantity demanded depends on the price • …and the familiar demand curve. Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nMonopoly • Cournot derived the rule that a profit-maximizing monopolist would follow in deciding what price to charge. • This one-good-at-a-time approach is called partial equilibrium analysis. • The monopoly pricing rule is the familiar condition that the price must be such that Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost. Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nPrice Marginal cost Demand Marginal revenue Monopoly Competitive quantity quantity Profit Maximization by a Monopoly Costs and Revenue Quantity 0 Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nMonopoly and Costs • Cournot showed that an increase in production cost (more precisely, the cost of producing an additional unit, the marginal cost) would raise the price charged by the monopolist •  and that the price increase could be smaller than or greater than the increase in cost. Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nPrice Marginal cost Demand Marginal revenue Monopoly Competitive quantity quantity Profit Maximization by a Monopoly and Cost Increase Costs and Revenue Quantity 0 Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nMonopoly and Taxes • Lump-sum taxes (that is, taxes that are not dependent on the monopolist’s decisions) do not affect the monopolist’s decisions. • This may sound simpler than it really is! • Cournot showed that an excise tax (on sellers) and a sales tax (on buyers) are equivalent. • These are in turn equivalent to an increase in cost or a decrease in demand. Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nPrice Marginal cost Demand Marginal revenue Monopoly Competitive quantity quantity Profit Maximization by a Monopoly Costs and Revenue Quantity 0 Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nThe Duopoly Problem • Two firms sell the same product. • If they together produce a high output, the price of the product will be low; if they together produce a low output, the price will be high. • Each firm independently decides what amount to produce. • That is, no firm knows the other firm’s output decision before making its own. • So, what reasoning would each firm use to decide what output to produce? • And, how will the duopoly outcome differ from the monopoly outcome? Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nPrice Marginal cost Marginal Demand revenue Monopoly Competitive quantity quantity Profit Maximizing Duopolists There are two firms: A and B. This picture shows Firm A. If Firm B produces nothing, Firm A produces the monopoly output. If Firm B produces X, Firm A will respond by producing less. If Firm B produces Y, Firm A will produce even less. The bigger is Firm B’s output, the smaller is Firm A’s production. Costs and Revenue Y X Quantity 0 Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nPrice Marginal cost Marginal Demand1 revenue Monopoly quantity Profit Maximizing Duopolists There are two firms: A and B. This picture shows Firm A. If Firm B produces nothing, Firm A’s demand is Demand1. It produces the monopoly output. If Firm B begins to produce, Firm A will respond by producing less. If Firm B produces even more, Firm A will produce even less. The bigger is Firm B’s output, the smaller is Firm A’s production. Costs and Revenue Quantity 0 Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nDuopoly Firm B’s production Firm A’s reaction curve Firm B’s monopoly output Firm B’s duopoly output Firm B’s reaction curve Firm A’s production Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nDuopoly • Cournot’s solution to this duopoly problem is the same as the solution now called Nash Equilibrium in modern game theory. • Keep in mind that Cournot wrote in 1838. Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nDuopoly and Monopoly • Cournot showed that the output will be higher and the price will be lower in duopoly than in monopoly. Antoine Augustin Cournot\n\nCartel Formation • The total profit of the two firms in a duopoly will be lower than profit of the one firm in a monopoly. • Why? • Nevertheless, the duopolists will not be able to coordinate their decisions to simulate the monopoly outcome. • Even if they agree to restrict their joint output to the monopoly output, they will have huge incentives to secretly renege on the agreement. • This was an early example of the Prisoners’ Dilemma. Antoine Augustin Cournot"
