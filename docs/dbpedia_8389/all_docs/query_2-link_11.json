        "text": "Antoine Augustin Cournot, 1801-1877, was a French philosopher and mathematician and one of the precursors of marginalism. He was Professor of mathematical analysis at the Lyon University and later on became Rector of the Dijon Academy. Cournot applied his knowledge of mathematics to economics and developed an important model on oligopolies known as Cournout duopoly model.\n\nCournot presented his model in his “Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth”, 1838. In this model he introduced the concepts of Nash equilibrium and non-cooperative games, decades before they were formally formulated. The model, as well as Stackelberg duopolies, considers quantity the key variable rather than price."
