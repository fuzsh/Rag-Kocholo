        "text": "(Updated 06/06/2024)\n\nWe go to great lengths commemorating soldiers who have died fighting wars for their countries. Why not do the same for the naturalists who still sometimes give up everything in the effort to understand life? Neither would diminish the sacrifice of the other. In fact, many early naturalists were also soldiers, or, like Charles Darwin aboard HMS Beagle, were embedded with military expeditions.\n\nWith that in mind, I started to construct a very preliminary Naturalistsâ Wall of the Dead, to at least assemble the names in one place, as I was researching my book The Species Seekers. If I have missed someone, or made other mistakes, please suggest changes in the comments. I am trying to focus on naturalists who died in the course of their work. Though he may have acquired Chagas disease in his travels, for instance, Darwin died at home, age 73, of Crohnâs disease, and so does not really fit this list. (UPDATE: Texas conservationist John Karges just tipped me off to this article on âJob-Related Mortality of Wildlife Biologists in the United States,â with a lot of names not yet included in this list. Please take a look and let me know if you see people in your field who are missing and deserve mention. It will help me get names up faster if you could please include dates and links to additional sources in roughly the format below:\n\nLast name, First Name, (year of birth-death), brief description of specialty and contributions, died, age ??, of what cause, where. Add URL for relevant link. Photos also welcome.\n\nTo check your information, it may help to look at this list of species seekers and their finds, complied by Bionomia.net/\n\nIf you want to link to this list on Twitter or elsewhere, the Tiny URL is http://bit.ly/1rf6N9E Iâll also post a notice on Twitter if I have to add new names. You can follow me @RichardConniff. And please be careful out there, so you do not become one of the names I have to add. Thank you.\n\nAaronsohn, Aaron (1876 -1919), botanist who discovered wild emmer, âthe mother of wheat.â He was also the founder and head of Nili, the Jewish spy network that provided critical aid to British troops in Palestine during World War I. The brilliant military campaign led by Field Marshall Edmund Allenby might have seemed to outsiders to take unwarranted risks, the chief of British military intelligence later said, but âThat is not true.

According to another source, Boll was âbitten by a snake and having no means of reaching medical aid in a hurry the excessive heat and long exposure caused blood poisoning which ended in speedy death.â Cope attributed Bollâs death to âhis indifference to his personal comfort while exploring the Permian beds at my instance.â\n\nBossuyt, Francis J.

Madhusudan Katti, a colleague, commented, âHe went out in action, in the field surveying for reptiles, just across the Agasthyamalai mountain in whose rain shadow I spent my formative years chasing leaf warblers. Never thought about the risks of simple slip down a slope. Just unbelievable that Bhupathy lost his life in such a horribly random fashion.

(The ghoul defense may sound unlikely. But other European explorersâWallace, Du Chaillu, Cumingâalso reported that terrified locals sometimes mistook them for ghosts on account of their unnaturally pale skin. The tendency of naturalists to work late into the night preserving specimensâcadaversâby candlelight may have compounded this impression of ghoulishness.
