Even when the first bill was proposed to purchase a home, the word mansion was not used. Rather, the home was and is designated as a \"residence.\" Even during the 79 years that Keystone Hall was used, it was known simply as that, Keystone Hall. Even today, the home located at 2035 North Front Street is officially known as \"The Governor's Residence\" not \"The Governor's Mansion.\" The distinction may be both psychological and historical. It may help to remind the governor that he lives in the people's house. It may also remind the electorate that the we, as citizens, own the home and allow the individuals we choose to reside there only temporarily.\n\nAs early as 1852, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives proposed funds for \"the erection of a dwelling for the residence of the Governor of this Commonwealth.\" Six years later, on January 18, 1858, Governor Pollock signed the bill authorizing funds for the purchase of a building suitable for the governor. By 1861 and the start of the Civil War, Governor Curtin found the home to be too small to handle the full load of war-related business. Funds were authorized to purchase 313 North Front Street. Governor Curtin and family moved into the residence in 1864.\n\nTwenty years later, the neighboring home was purchased, joined together, and a faux façade was built. Keystone Hall was now a fully functioning residence for the governor. By 1959, the home had fallen into such disrepair that the home was sold and demolished the following year. (The governors used the State House at Indiantown Gap during this period.) Arthur James proposed a new governors residence in 1941. He wanted a grand house built in the William & Mary (Williamsburg) style architecture. However, it took over 25 years for his idea to come to fruition. In 1968, the current residence opened to welcome the Ray Shafer family. It has been the home of the governor ever since.\n\nLiving former governors of Pennsylvania[]\n\nTemplate:As of, there are four former governors of Pennsylvania who are currently living at this time, the oldest governor of Pennsylvania being Ed Rendell (served 2003-2011, born 1944). The most recent death of a former governor of Pennsylvania was that of Richard Thornburgh (served 1979–1987, born 1932), on December 31, 2020.\n\nGovernor Gubernatorial term Date of birth (and age) Tom Ridge 1995–2001 August 26, 1945 (1945-08-26) (age 78) Mark Schweiker 2001–2003 January 31, 1953 (1953-01-31) (age 71) Ed Rendell 2003–2011 January 5, 1944 (1944-01-05) (age 80) Tom Corbett 2011–2015 June 17, 1949 (1949-06-17) (age 75)\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of Pennsylvania gubernatorial elections\n\nList of Pennsylvania state legislatures\n\nList of colonial governors of Pennsylvania\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nGeneral\n\nPage Template:Refbegin/styles.css has no content.\n\nGardini, Fausto. \"The Demise of the Luxemburger Gazette\".
