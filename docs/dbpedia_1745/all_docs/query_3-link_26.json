        "text": "Finding Scotland‚Äôs ‚Äòlost‚Äô ice age pinewoods - from a Trees for Life news release. A new project from Trees for Life and Woodland Trust Scotland aims to discover Scotland‚Äôs ‚Äòlost‚Äô native pinewoods ‚Äì home to wild Scots pines with an ancestry that can be traced back to the end of the last ice age ‚Äì so they can be saved and restored before it‚Äôs too late. Caledonian pinewoods are globally unique and support rare wildlife including red squirrels, capercaillie and crossbills. Yet less than 2% of the Caledonian forest, which once covered much of the Highlands, survives. Just 84 individual Caledonian pinewoods are now officially recognised, having been last documented more than a quarter of a century ago. But Woodland Trust Scotland and Trees for Life have become aware of other lost wild pinewoods, and from historical documents and anecdotal reports, more are thought to exist. The charities have teamed up to identify and save these forgotten pinewoods through the Wild Pine Project, beginning with the western Highlands, where Scots pines form part of Scotland‚Äôs rare temperate rainforest. ‚ÄúLost pinewoods are at particular risk because they are unrecognised and undocumented. We want to find them, assess their condition, and revive them before they are lost forever,‚Äù said Jane Sayers, Wild Pine Project Officer. ‚ÄúFinding these pinewoods requires a lot of detective work. They are often small and remote, hidden in ravines safe from deer. Pines, or their remains, are often found scattered among birchwood too.‚Äù The Wild Pine Project is identifying lost pine sites by tracing their history through the centuries using historical evidence, including maps which date as far back as the 1500s. Once potential sites are found, historical, ecological and landscape evidence will help establish whether they are wild or planted, and their health and resilience will be assessed. The charities will then work for the recognition and recovery of the discovered wild pinewoods, including by presenting findings to landowners and managers. The need for urgent upscaling of political and public action to save the Caledonian pinewoods was spotlighted by a parliamentary debate held in the Scottish Parliament on 24 January, held to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Scots pine becoming Scotland‚Äôs national tree. This followed a motion put forward by Ariane Burgess MSP. The new Wild Pine Project is funded by Woodland Trust Scotland, thanks to support from players of People's Postcode Lottery, and by Trees for Life, thanks to support from the The TreadRight Foundation.

From the verbiage of the piece and frankly from the ‚Äútrending‚Äù items featured on social media, it is beyond pellucid that we humans still don‚Äôt get it. One quote from the composition can kick things off: ‚Äú[The park] can not be trusted with the care and well-being of animals. And its leaders must be held responsible for this, because ultimately there were humans who chose, again and again, to ignore the health and welfare of these majestic creatures.‚Äù A few lines from the magnificent Scot poet Bobby Burns come to mind: ‚ÄúO wad some Power the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us! It wad frae mony a blunder free us, An‚Äô foolish notion: What airs in dress an‚Äô gait wad lea‚Äôe us, An‚Äô ev‚Äôn devotion!‚Äù Jesus, although perhaps not with the same poetic bent, confronts us with the same veracity: ‚ÄúYou hypocrite! First remove the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother‚Äôs eye.‚Äù Matthew 7:5. Translation of Paul Esposito. My dear friends, we are the humans who chose to ignore the welfare of the majestic creatures. We are the beings who frequent these parks, aquatic or terrestrial, eagerly and unquestioningly disbursing the price of admission to gape and gawk at the forced antics of the subjugated cetaceans. And not one word of protest, of sympathy, of concern for the wellbeing of these maltreated denizens of our planet, is ever uttered. No human attendee possesses or displays any empathetic connection with God‚Äôs creatures so brutally abused. My dear friends, a reverence for life is a life affirming ethos positing, inter alia, that mankind operates under a solemn bond to serve as stewards of all God‚Äôs creation. It is indubitably our calling to protect, assist, and enhance life, all life. Our commission is not to seek diversion or amusement from the exploitation of earth‚Äôs fellow denizens. On the contrary, our overarching task is to create a milieu in which such exploitation does not ever exist. Our task is to superintend this planet such that all beings may live according to their own penchant and proclivities, as God intended, for their beneficence, not for our entertainment or distraction. Let us cease to apportion blame for our failings on other hominins. We own this. We are responsible. We are accountable. Let us seek and implement ameliorative answers to the villainy we have occasioned. Let each of us \"straighten up and fly right.\" That is conferring the love of Jesus universally. That is a reverence for life.
