Since the impacts of these environmental factors depend on the type of PV module technology, an assessment of the PV technology to be deployed in the desert climate is crucial for the bankability of PV projects. In this work, the indoor and outdoor performance of monofacial and bifacial silicon heterojunction PV module technologies were assessed. For the indoor measurements, a comparison of the current-voltage (IV) characteristics was performed at standard testing condition and at different temperatures. The two module technologies showed similar temperature coefficients and expected performance within the measurement uncertainty. Comparing the specific energy yield of the modules installed in the Outdoor Test Facility (OTF), the bifacial module showed a 15% higher energy yield than the monofacial module and is attributed to the contribution of the bifacial rear side, thanks to the reflected irradiance received by the bifacial module and the high albedo of 0.43 measured at the OTF. Moreover, the bifacial module was found to be less sensitive to the PV soiling than the monofacial module. The results showed that the frequency of module cleaning could be reduced for the bifacial module compared with the monofacial module, resulting in a remarkable decrease in the module cleaning cost and PV site Operation and Maintenance cost.

Out of 211 articles identified in the indexed databases, WOS, SCOPUS, and SciELO, 16 were selected for an exhaustive analysis. It was determined that this topic is still in the process of development, focusing on aspects such as learning content, pedagogy, and the learning environment. Most studies employed qualitative methodologies. Contextualization in sustainability is the most advanced competency. The results highlight the importance of continuing to investigate and develop effective strategies to integrate ESD in the continuous education and training of mathematics teachers. It is essential to address the development of competencies in ecological and mediational facets, ensure solid knowledge of mathematical content, employ adequate pedagogical strategies, and understand the relationship between the environment and mathematics. These findings offer insights into the prevailing trend of integrating ESD into mathematics education through ESD elements and didactic competencies, as evidenced by recent studies involving both practicing and pre-service teachers. This understanding may promote the enhancement of the quality of mathematics education practices within this domain.

Assessing the justification of investment in sustainable management of land resources is an important step in this process. Consequently, an analysis of soil erosion risk was carried out in the suburban area of the morphological unit of the Barička river watershed, using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) method, with the existing and projected structure of agricultural production according to the Future Agricultural Production Structure Model from the Aspect of Preserving Land Resources for Mountain Catchment Areas of Serbia (FAPSMS). The value of the existing and projected production structure from an economic aspect was also examined using dynamic economic methods. In order to assess the risk and uncertainty of investments, a sensitive analysis of dynamic methods was carried out. The results show that soil erosion losses are already below tolerance values with the existing production structure and that they could be reduced even more by applying the designed structure. Economic indicators show that the investment is justified and that it is more sensitive to changes in income.

Korea also continues to invest in R&D to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. However, compared to the government’s continuous investment in R&D, there is a lack of systematic analysis of R&D investment performance. Rather than simply reducing and increasing the investment in R&D to respond to climate change in terms of high and low efficiency, we aim to improve the efficiency of national R&D projects by analyzing the causes of low efficiency and deriving improvement directions. In this study, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to analyze the efficiency of climate change response technology development projects conducted by the Ministry of Science and ICT in Korea. The efficiency of 1500 projects conducted during the 2014–2020 period was analyzed from a static and dynamic perspective, focusing on project information. Through static efficiency analysis, total efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE), and scale efficiency (SE) were measured, and the causes of inefficiency were identified. In addition, the results of the dynamic efficiency analysis using the Malmquist analysis were presented, and alternatives for each field were suggested by presenting the static and dynamic results as an integrated model.

One way for HVAC systems to efficiently remove airborne viruses is by filtering them. Unlike disposable filters that require repeated purchases of consumables, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is an alternative option without the drawback of reduced dust collection efficiency in high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters due to dust buildup. The majority of viruses have a diameter ranging from 0.1 μm to 5 μm. This study proposed a two-stage ESP, which charged airborne viruses and particles via positive electrode ionization wire and collected them on a collecting plate with high voltage. Numerical simulations were conducted and revealed a continuous decrease in collection efficiencies between 0.1 μm and 0.5 μm, followed by a consistent increase from 0.5 μm to 1 μm. For particles larger than 1 μm, collection efficiencies exceeding 90% were easily achieved with the equipment used in this study. Previous studies have demonstrated that the collection efficiency of suspended particles is influenced by both the ESP voltage and turbulent flow at this stage. To improve the collection efficiency of aerosols ranging from 0.1 μm to 1 μm, this study used a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) in combination with numerical simulations to obtain the optimal parameter combination of ionization voltage and flow speed. The particle collection performance of the ESP was examined under the Japan Electrical Manufacturers’ Association (JEMA) standards and showed consistent collection performance throughout the experiment. Moreover, after its design was optimized, the precipitator collected aerosols ranging from 0.1 μm to 3 μm, demonstrating an efficiency of over 95%. With such high collection efficiency, the proposed ESP can effectively filter airborne particles as efficiently as an N95 respirator, eliminating the need to wear a mask in a building and preventing the spread of droplet infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (0.08 μm–0.16 μm).

The model is constructed based on the constraints of customer time window, vehicle load, demand-splitable, and semi-open driving of multiple distribution centers. We to divide the customer areas according to geographical locations and to carry out the transportation processes in stages. The target solution, which includes vehicle routing, service time and type, cargo details, etc., has been formulated. A two-stage hybrid-heuristic-path-scheme solution algorithm that combines a taboo table, a genetic algorithm, an optimal-path-generation algorithm, a load-capacity-constraint algorithm, and a time-window-constraint algorithm is designed in view of the complexity of the model and the uniqueness of the solution scheme. This paper aims to reasonably plan the resource allocation of cold chain logistics enterprises, reduce the comprehensive cost of cold chain transportation, improve customer satisfaction, and respond to the green logistics policy advocated by the state by reducing vehicle transit time and fuel consumption, and promote energy conservation and emission reduction.

A specific feature of a land consolidation project is its complexity and multiple aspects. The considerable number of complex operations making up the whole procedure implies the necessity of using specialist technical tools to ensure effective surveys. The latest developments in technology are giving way to dedicated solutions that can optimise the working time and quality of the outcomes of respective tasks. This paper outlines a self-designed algorithm for generating the technical layer of land use/soil valuation classes based on layers of soil class contours and land use contours, which are obligatory elements of a digital cadastre database in Poland. The fully automated procedure, next to efficient conversion of spatial data, involves detailed verification of the correctness of input data and elimination of various errors. The tool’s deliverable is a set of data necessary for proceeding with selected elements of the land consolidation process, such as comparative estimates of land value and farmstead designs based on land value. The designed tool was implemented at the Subcarpathian Office of Land Surveying and Agricultural Areas in Rzeszów (Poland). The proposed solutions contributed to considerable improvement in the time devoted to performing selected tasks and the substantive correctness of the results.

Commercial applications of these technologies are still in their infancy and do not offer significant benefits to the general public due to their low economic efficiency. The main objective of this paper is to contribute to the commercialization of wind and wave energy. The first step toward achieving this goal is to review equation models related to the economic benefits of wind and wave energy. A case study approach is then used to examine several successful offshore wind and wave energy conversion devices. As a result of this examination, we identify limitations and difficulties in commercializing and developing wind and wave energy. Finally, we propose various measures to address these challenges, including technological innovation, policy support, and market regulation. Research and decision-makers interested in the promotion of renewable energy sources will gain valuable insights from this study, which will ultimately lead to the adoption of sustainable energy practices for the benefit of society and the environment.

The watershed approach has become relevant for managing water resources and ensuring their sustainability. This study combined the above two approaches by applying an adapted watershed sustainability index (WSI) to evaluate the sustainable development of the Santiago–Guadalajara River basin (SGRB), which passes through Guadalajara, the second-most populous city in Mexico. The river is the most polluted waterway in the country. The WSI of each sub-basin places the SGRB at a sustainability level between low in the upper and lower basin region and intermediate in the central basin region. Regions with a low sustainability level are characterized by environmental degradation due to changes in land use, while in the region with intermediate sustainability, the factor that most affect the evaluation is water availability. An overall sustainability score of WSI = 0.36 was obtained for the study area, which is lower than that of any other basins evaluated in the same manner around the world. These results send a clear message to decision makers of the three government levels, in charge of the environmental sustainability of the basin, of the need to take action to facilitate its recovery.

Understanding the spatial distribution and changing trends of industrial development in BTH is critical for achieving BTH’s coordinated development goals. In particular, it is important to assess the effectiveness of Beijing’s non-capital functions at the industrial level. This study utilized the 2013 and 2018 economic census data and statistical methods such as spatial Gini coefficient, trend analysis, specialization index, and industry similarity. We first characterized the industrial development pattern by analyzing the spatiotemporal changes of the operating income and the number of legal entities in BTH urban agglomeration. Then, we identified the changes in the leading industries and industrial structure of different cities in BTH urban agglomeration from 2013 to 2018. The results indicate that the coordinated development policy has influenced the industrial structure of the BTH urban agglomeration, with an 85.53% increase in the number of legal entities and a 14.61% increase in operating income. Beijing’s non-capital functions have achieved initial results, mainly involving technology-intensive and knowledge-intensive tertiary industries such as information technology, finance, and scientific research. The division of industry and the development positioning of the three regions are gradually becoming clear. Our results show how the economic census data and spatial analysis can support significant advances in evaluating industrial and economic development patterns, and they can be used worldwide in the future.

However, in the process of urbanization, it is necessary to handle some practical problems in order to realize the sustainable development of consumption in rural areas. Under the concept of sustainable consumption, urbanization has become a new engine that drives rural residents’ consumption in China. The digital economy has injected new vitality to expand domestic demand as well. Therefore, whether consumption upgrading in rural areas is affected by urbanization and the digital economy is a topic worth studying. To discuss the relationship between urbanization, the digital economy and consumption levels in rural areas, this paper uses an intermediary effect model to test how urbanization promotes the consumption upgrading in rural regions with the digital economy as the intermediary variable and explores the threshold characteristics of urbanization. The results are as follows: urbanization significantly promotes the rural residents’ consumption upgrading, and there is regional heterogeneity. It improves the consumption optimization in the eastern and central regions, but not in the western region. The digital economy intermediates the relationship between urbanization and consumption optimization. Moreover, urbanization has a double threshold, and with the increase of the threshold value, the marginal effect of urbanization on rural residents’ consumption upgrading also increases gradually. China should seize the opportunities of the development of urbanization and the digital economy, constantly raise farmer income, and narrow the income gap between urban and rural area, so as to promote the sustainable development of consumption in rural areas.

The microwave treatment duration, temperature, and solvent:solid ratio were the independent variables selected; whereas total phenol content, antioxidant activity (DPPH●, ABTS●+, CUPRAC assays), and the p-coumaric and ferulic acids concentration were the dependent ones. The optimum conditions were found to be 3.6 min, 155 °C, and 50:1 v/w which were then applied to hulls from different rice varieties cultivated in Greece [Gladio, Krezo, Scirocco, Karolina (two samples), Europa, Bravo, Bella (parboiled), and Fino (long-grain rice)]. The results were compared to those obtained using an optimized ultrasound-assisted alkaline hydrolysis protocol (120 min, 80 °C, 50:1 v/w) proposed in the literature. The values obtained with microwaves were much higher compared to those obtained by ultrasounds (i.e., p-coumaric acid levels were 1.2 to 2.2-fold higher, and those of ferulic acid were 2.1 to 6.0-fold higher) using almost 2-fold higher temperature but reducing the hydrolysis duration by ~33-fold. Thus, the optimized approach may assist the valorization of rice hulls as a sustainable source of natural phenolic antioxidants for novel food applications.

Nevertheless, this method can lead to some environmental problems in the surrounding regions. Flyrock is one of the most dangerous effects induced by blasting which needs to be estimated to reduce the potential risk of damage. In other words, the minimization of flyrock can lead to sustainability of surroundings environment in blasting sites. To this aim, the present study develops several new hybrid models for predicting flyrock. The proposed models were based on a cascaded forward neural network (CFNN) trained by the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA), and also the combination of least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and three optimization algorithms, i.e., gravitational search algorithm (GSA), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and artificial bee colony (ABC). To construct the models, a database collected from three granite quarry sites, located in Malaysia, was applied. The prediction values were then checked and evaluated using some statistical criteria. The results revealed that all proposed models were acceptable in predicting the flyrock. Among them, the LSSVM-WOA was a more robust model than the others and predicted the flyrock values with a high degree of accuracy.

Despite the growing literature on community energy projects from the perspectives of various business models, drivers, and barriers, few studies display the impact of institutional factors on the community energy business model configuration. Using insights from Ostrom’s institutional framework, this study develops a conceptual framework comprising policy instruments and the intermediaries that configure the various community energy business models, and it examines this framework in the developed world of northwestern European countries (Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK) and in selected cases in developing countries (Rural Central America, South Africa, Iran, and Indonesia). The findings indicate that ambitious renewable energy consumption targets and national policies in northern EU countries have resulted in political and financial incentives, as well as greater financial security than other investment markets, which encourage citizens to contribute to the proliferation of community energy. On the other hand, in the studied developing countries, top-down energy policies and a centralized energy system are insufficient for participatory energy planning. Due to unsupportive policies, a lack of appropriate regulatory frameworks, and a lack of institutional support in these countries, the initiation of community energy projects requires the presence of intermediaries such as developers who work ‘in-between’ other actors, such as energy providers, users, or regulators.

We assume that the floating value of green bonds is linked to the carbon price. The carbon emission trading mechanism and government subsidy policy are introduced into this model, and the expression is derived from the stochastic differential utility framework based on the fast Fourier transform method. Based on the numerical analysis and the simulations, this paper analyzes when governments are facing financial and carbon emission constraints and how policymakers balance the allocation between carbon allowances and government subsidies to help green bonds reach the exogenous equilibrium price. Our results have implications in terms of optimizing the distribution of economic resources by the reasonable pricing of green bonds. It is in line with the current theme of global energy conservation and emission reduction, and also has certain guiding significance for the development of the carbon emission trading market.

The results show that (1) From 1990 to 2020, carbon storage decreased year by year. (2) In 2030, except for the EPS, the future carbon storage prediction values of the remaining scenarios are lower than those in 2020, especially the carbon storage prediction value under the EDS, which is the lowest at 8.65 × 108 t. (3) The spatial distribution of carbon storage in the GBA has significant spatial heterogeneity. The high-value areas of carbon storage are distributed in the east and west wings as well as southwest of the GBA, while the low-value areas are concentrated in the middle and east. The research results can provide a reasonable scientific basis for the territorial space resource planning of the GBA under the goal of “dual carbon”.

Although electrical load and price demonstrate a strong correlation which is not linear, price prediction may be a task much more challenging than load prediction due to several factors. The volatility of electricity price compared to load makes price prediction a complex procedure. To perform purchasing decisions commercial consumers may rely on short term price and load prediction. A system which combines Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) which predict Load Marginal Prices (LMPs) and electricity consumption is presented in this study. Furthermore, the Virtual Cost (VC) concept, which is the sum of the products between the predicted hourly consumption values and their respective predicted LMPs is introduced. Virtual Cost is assessed with a Fuzzy Decision Tree (FDT) compared to a threshold set by the customer. If needed, the amount of electrical energy that a healthcare facility must purchase at every hour of the day may be scheduled using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to meet the threshold criterion. This hybrid model proved economically beneficial for the facility, which is of great importance since the saved resources may be utilized to improve its infrastructures or for other purposes with social impact. The novelty of the proposed method is the utilization of ANFIS, Fuzzy Decision Trees and Genetic Algorithms combined as tools to improve the hospital’s energy and economic efficiency, achieving a reduction of the electricity costs up to 21.95 percent. The contribution of the study is to provide a reliable decision-making tool to everyone who participates in the electricity market in order to perform profitable energy scheduling automatically and accurately.

Within a framework for a new socio-ecological narrative that considers opposition (such as fighting) and collaboration (cooperative learning) as carriers of self-control and pain perception inhibition, we investigated the acute effects of a judo-specific session on cognitive (inhibitory control and simple reaction time), perceptual (pain and fatigue), affective (anxiety) and physiological (hormone profile) domains. Eleven male black belt judokas (age 39.0 ± 13.9 years; training experience: 23.2 ± 14.4 years) were recruited and tested before and after judo randori and resting sessions. Inhibitory control and simple reaction time were assessed via the Flanker task and clinical reaction time test, pain and fatigue were assessed using Borg’s category-ratio scale (CR-10), and the state–trait anxiety inventory Y-1 test assessed anxiety. Glucose, insulin, cortisol, creatinine, and irisin levels were measured. Cognitive performance, perception of fatigue and physiological variables increased after randori bouts, while pain decreased. Inhibitory control, perception of pain, perception of fatigue and glucose, cortisol, and creatinine significantly differed (p < 0.05) between randori and resting sessions. A high-intensity randori may induce acute beneficial effects on cognitive, perceptual, and physiological domains. Further studies should compare the results with the outcomes from a collaborative and non-agonist environment and confirm the socio-ecologic framework.

A small-scale dairy can assist a family in maintaining their livelihoods in Bangladesh. However, it is also associated with various environmental and social impacts, making it crucial for achieving sustainability. The triple bottom line of sustainability intends to achieve sustainability through improving productivity, implementing sustainable practices, and incorporating waste management. The dairy industry can continue to provide nutritious diets, ensuring sustainability practices. This research is a follow-up paper of Nasir et al. to find better sustainable results. It considers the triple bottom line of sustainability theory to improve the farm environment by reducing waste, managing resources efficiently, and promoting environmentally friendly practices. This paper is a case study on a dairy farm of 400 cattle in Bangladesh. The system dynamics method and simulation modeling were employed to draw dairy supply chain networks and examine the existing dataset to find better utilization of the dairy waste produced on the farm. Consequently, the simulation model incorporates waste management and value addition concepts to find better resource exploitation for gaining sustainable outcomes. Finally, this paper summarizes the simulation outcomes and articulates possible extensions for achieving further economic, social, and environmental benefits for the industry and surrounding community.

However, the extent to which they influence driving characteristics in the event of obstructed on-road traffic lights (ORTLs) has yet to be fully examined. Firstly, the situation of partially deployed IVTLs in both vehicles was analyzed to identify the factors that affect driving characteristics. Through the following distance model, relative vehicle speed, acceleration and deceleration, and following distance were recognized as the contributing factors. The evaluation indicators for driving characteristics were thereby further established. Then, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform was built using PreScan 8.5-MATLAB/Simulink R2018b joint simulation software and a Logitech G29 device. IVTLs were implemented using modules in the joint simulation software. Finally, under the scenarios of obstructed ORTLs and various deployment conditions of IVTLs, the original data were collected from 50 experimental subjects with simulated driving. The subjects included 25 males and 25 females, all of whom were non-professional drivers, with ages ranging from 20 to 40 years old. The conclusion was reached that IVTLs could improve driving comfort by approximately 10% in sunny weather (p = 0.008 < 0.05, p = 0.023 < 0.05; p = 0.046 < 0.05, p = 0.001 < 0.05), driving maneuverability by approximately 30% in foggy weather (p = 0.033 < 0.05), and driving safety by approximately 50% in the ORTLs obstructed by a truck scenario (p = 0.019 < 0.05). In general, even if only one vehicle was equipped with IVTLs, certain gain effects on the driving characteristics of both vehicles could still be provided.

Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, but the best solution depends on the specific circumstances of each municipality. As an environmentally friendly and efficient energy use, a decentralised heat supply contributes to achieving energy conservation and emissions reduction goals. Decentralised energy use, such as solar collectors with thermal energy storage or biomass as a resource, reduces dependence on centralised heat generation and transmission. The appropriate infrastructure for connection to district heating networks has not yet been built. On the other hand, it is easier to make investments to construct proper infrastructure in the case of large-scale centralised heat supplies. Moreover, a centralised heat supply with renewable energy sources can provide more inhabitants with renewable heat energy. Within the framework of the study, the possibilities of using renewable energy sources in one of the municipalities of Latvia—the Carnikava parish of Ādaži Municipality—are analysed. The study examines two scenario complexes including individual heating solutions in buildings or district heating solutions with a centralised approach. The study evaluates several alternatives to increase the share of RES (solar collectors, biomass, heat pumps, etc.) in the centralised heat supply. To evaluate individual RES solutions in various municipal buildings, this study evaluates alternatives with different technical solutions that increase the use of RES in heat supply.

However, current research on the mechanical safety of prismatic lithium-ion batteries (PLIBs) primarily focuses on quasi-static states, and the failure mechanism of batteries under dynamic impact remains incompletely understood. Therefore, to investigate the failure mechanism and critical failure displacement of PLIB under dynamic impacts, this study establishes a computational model of PLIB considering anisotropy based on experimental data and extends the simulation to the case of high-velocity battery collision. On this basis, the deformation feature, mechanical response, and failure mechanism of PLIB under different impact velocities are analyzed. The results show that the deformation feature of PLIB under dynamic impact differs from that under quasi-static loading. As the loading velocity increases, the inertial effect gradually becomes apparent, causing the deformation of PLIB to localize and the failure displacement to decrease. Three critical failure displacements were identified within the velocity range of 0–20 m/s. This study can serve as a reference for battery safety design.

After the economic crisis in 2008, the challenges of developing countries are intensified, and the game is more cyclical; Especially in the critical period when the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” is pending, many countries have increased their efforts in policy formulation and efficiency improvement, focusing on industrial transformation and upgrading, and closely combining structural reform with the industrialization process. Therefore, it is particularly important to analyze, change and forecast the industrial structure of post-industrial regions in developing countries based on data science algorithms, and to reshape the understanding of the adjustment of the world economic order and the evolution of the international trade division system. Based on the proportion of gross regional product and output value of three industries in Heilongjiang Province of China from 2001 to 2020, the minimum deviation model of industrial structure in Heilongjiang Province is constructed through Markov theory. The Lingo software is used to obtain the transition probability matrix of the industrial structure state, and combined with the autocorrelation coefficient of each order and the transfer weight, the change trend of the proportion of the output value of the three industries and the change of the contribution rate of the three industries (to GDP) in Heilongjiang Province in the next 10 years are obtained; At the same time, through the grey correlation index and spss software, this paper analyzes the correlation changes between the three industrial adjustments and economic development in Heilongjiang Province in the past 20 years, discusses the new growth points of economic development in Heilongjiang Province and puts forward corresponding suggestions for the adjustment of different industrial structures in Heilongjiang Province, and finally extends the general rules of the development of post-industrialization in the world. This article believes that it is necessary to adjust the structure of the first, second, and third industries reasonably based on different historical and natural endowments, contemporary backgrounds, and other practical factors, in accordance with local conditions, circumstances, and each with its own emphasis. At the same time, it also requires the support and inclination of government policies; Adapting industrial structure to local economic development while actively leading productivity and local economic development.

This study integrates outdoor and indoor quality by investigating the effect of design parameters at an urban block scale (building form restricted to width and length as rectangular and square, building orientation, block orientation, building combination, building height, facade length, built-up percentage, setbacks, and canyon aspect ratio) on outdoor thermal comfort and energy use intensity. In addition, it explains the different correlations between outdoor thermal comfort and energy use intensity in different urban block designs in a hot-summer Mediterranean climate in Jordan. The study adopts a performance-driven approach using simulation tools of Ladybug, Honeybee, Dragonfly, and Eddy3d plugins across the grasshopper interface and evaluates 59 different urban block designs with nine different orientations (0°, 1°, 45°, 85°, 87°, 90°, 355°, 358°, and 359°). The results show that there is a positive correlation between the canyon aspect ratio and the environmental performance of the urban block designs. North–south street canyons are more effective at enhancing microclimates. Negatively increasing the street aspect ratio by more than four affected outdoor thermal comfort by increasing longwave radiation. Further results suggest a positive correlation between the compactness of urban blocks and their environmental performance, with north–south street canyons found to be more effective in enhancing microclimates. The study emphasizes the need to understand the distribution of open spaces formed by buildings and to strike a balance between day and night, as well as summer and winter conditions in outdoor spaces.

Therefore, asset managers in developing and emerging countries increasingly focus on sustainable investment opportunities. While institutional investors largely centred on governance considerations pre-2020, the Coronavirus pandemic highlighted substantial social and environmental concerns at companies worldwide. As South Africa is the most unequal country globally according to the World Bank, decisions made by local institutional investors can have significant implications for individuals and environments where capital is invested. The objectives of this study were hence to analyse the sustainability themes on which South African asset managers focused in their stewardship reports and to explore the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that they addressed through their investment mandates. A content analysis was performed on stewardship reports that were published in 2020 and 2021 to consider the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. The findings indicate that prioritised sustainability themes include climate action, infrastructure development and social considerations. The considered asset managers accordingly focused on addressing climate action (SDG 13), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7). Promising investment opportunities in companies that address key social issues, including the health and well-being of society (SDG 3) and broadening access to quality education (SDG 4) were also highlighted. The leaders of local investee companies are thus encouraged to ensure concise, transparent reporting on these material matters to enhance communication and engagement with institutional investors and other key stakeholders. This study offers a novel perspective on sustainable thematic investing in a highly unequal society.

The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between transportation infrastructure development and income inequality in urban and rural areas of China. The study utilizes panel data from 30 provinces, spanning the years 2010 to 2020, and employs the spatial Dubin model to measure and test the impact of transportation infrastructure on the urban-rural income gap. Furthermore, an intermediary effect test method is used to investigate the potential mediating effect of urbanization in this relationship. The results indicate that transportation infrastructure has a significantly negative direct, indirect, and total effect on the urban-rural income gap, with the indirect effect being greater than the direct effect. This suggests that transportation infrastructure can effectively reduce income disparities, with a noticeable spatial spillover effect. The level of urbanization plays a significant intermediary effect on the effect of transportation infrastructure on the urban-rural income gap, highlighting the role of transportation infrastructure in improving urbanization and narrowing income disparities. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing both the level of urbanization and cooperation between neighbouring regions in order to maximize the benefits of transportation infrastructure development for reducing income disparities and promoting regional balance in China.

This study shows the following: With an increase in the extraction time, the gas content of the coal seam was reduced to a minimum. It shows that, with an increase in the extraction time, the gas pressure and seepage velocity keep decreasing the stable value, the main stress around the borehole redistributes, and the coal permeability keeps decreasing with an increase in the decay coefficient. The extraction radius of the boreholes increases exponentially with the extraction time, and the reasonable extraction hole size is 94 mm; the use of multiple boreholes for pre-drawing gas via the use of the interval between the effective extraction radius and the influence radius results in a blind extraction zone caused by the superposition effect between the boreholes, and the residual gas value of the coal seam increases with an increase in the borehole spacing. The use of an equilateral triangular hole layout can avoid the extraction blind zone, and the pre-sumping effect is good after field application, which ensures the safe production of coal mines as well as the reasonable use of resources.

The establishment of public awareness about drinking water quality is a most significant issue in the protection of health and the wellbeing of humans. The present study focuses on the assessment of community awareness level of, as well as public trust in, the government-provided information about drinking water quality in two highly populated underrepresented megacities of Asia, i.e., Guangzhou (China) and Karachi (Pakistan). The study was conducted to explore the respondents’ knowledge about the existing quality issues and the practices to remove the contaminants in drinking water in both cities, which was determined by numerical analysis using the scoring method system and multinomial regression model. The results show that the respective respondents’ percentage awareness level and positive attitude in Guangzhou were 46.2% and 30.0% compared with 23.1% and 7.4% in Karachi, respectively. The respective percentage of respondents’ trust in media stories/reports about water pollution accidents was 76.0% and 70.8%, while the trust in government-provided information was 79.3% and 39.7% in Guangzhou and Karachi, respectively. The p-values for drinking water quality according to public approval based on sociodemographic parameters (gender, age, family members, household income/month, education, etc.) of respondents in both cities were <0.05, which supports that the variations in acquired results were significant. The study advocates that increased awareness campaigns by government agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in educational institutes and/or community centers can improve the public awareness level, which would subsequently help the governments to enhance the public trust, especially in Karachi. Moreover, the study’s findings have national significance and a worldwide scope, particularly in low- and middle-income regions.
