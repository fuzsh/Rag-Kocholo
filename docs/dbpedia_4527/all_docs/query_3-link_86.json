And also with the fact that narcotics trade was main source of financing all these wast illegal operations named Gladio. It is particularly disgusting the role of Vatikan bank which apparently can be labeled as financial criminal organization, or at least heavily supporting criminal activities, but out of reach of any authority. So much about highest moral authority. It comes to my mind the words of Michael Corleone (Godfather 3) - paraphrasing: “The higher I go, the more crooked it becomes .” I strongly recommend this book to everyone who is seriously sceptical (especially to younger generations) about our current Western so called “democratic and human” values, actually a fast deteriorating mask of one broken, crooked and bankrupt political, financial and moral system. You will find many answers in this book and to some extent the mindset of the people running it. Truly scary. Compared to Gladio, The Godfather looks like kindergarten."
