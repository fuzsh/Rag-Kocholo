        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe quiet professionals, masters of unconventional warfare. The U.S. Army Special Forces, sometimes known as the 'Green Berets', is USSOCOM's premier unconventional warfare unit. The U.S. Army Special Forces are a versatile Army special operations unit made up of 'quiet professionals' that are designed to deploy and execute nine doctrinal missions: unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, direct action, counter-insurgency, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, information operations, counterproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and security force assistance. Other Special Forces missions, known as secondary missions, include: combat search and rescue (CSAR), counter-narcotics, hostage rescue, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian demining, information operations, peacekeeping, manhunts as well as any other U.S. government activities as directed.\n\nThe primary mission of the Army Special Forces is to train and lead unconventional warfare (UW) forces, or a clandestine guerrilla force in an occupied nation. The 10th Special Forces Group was the first deployed SF unit, intended to train and lead UW forces behind enemy lines in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. As the U.S. became involved in Southeast Asia, it was realized that specialists trained to lead guerrillas could also help defend against hostile guerrillas, so SF acquired the additional mission of Foreign Internal Defense (FID), working with Host Nation (HN) forces in a spectrum of counter-guerrilla activities from indirect support to combat command.\n\nSpecial Forces personnel qualify both in advanced military skills and the regional languages and cultures of defined parts of the world. While they are best known for their unconventional warfare capabilities, they also undertake other missions that include direct action raids, peace operations, counter-proliferation, counter-drug advisory roles, and other strategic missions. As strategic resources, they report either to USSOCOM or to a regional Unified Combatant Command. To enhance their DA capability, specific units were created with a focus on the direct action side of special operations. First known as Commander's In-extremis Force (CIF), then Crisis Response Forces (CRF), they are now supplanted by Hard-Target Defeat (HTD) companies.\n\nSF team members work closely together and rely on one another under isolated circumstances for long periods of time, both during extended deployments and in garrison. Because of this, they develop clannish relationships and long-standing personal ties. SF non-commissioned officers (NCO) often spend their entire careers in Special Forces, rotating among assignments to detachments, higher staff billets, liaison positions, and instructor duties at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS). They are then required to move to staff positions or to higher command echelons. With the creation of USSOCOM, SF commanders have risen to the highest ranks of U.S. Army command, including command of USSOCOM, the Army's Chief of Staff, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nSpecial Forces Tasks & Missions\n\nDirect Action (DA)\n\nThese are short-duration strikes and other small-scale offensive actions conducted as a special operation in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments and which employ specialized military capabilities to seize, destroy, capture, exploit, recover, or damage designated targets. DA differs from conventional offensive actions in the level of physical and political risk, operational techniques, and the degree of discriminate and precise use of force to achieve specific objectives. Activities within DA include the following:\n\n1. Raids, Ambushes, and Direct Assaults. These are operations designed to achieve specific, well-defined and often time-sensitive results. They are sometimes beyond the effective strike capabilities of conventional force elements. Such operations typically involve attacks on critical targets, interdiction of lines of commuication (LOCs) or other target systems, capturing designated personnel or material; or the seizure, destruction, or neutralization of adversary facilities or capabilities.\n\n2. Standoff Attacks. These are attacks by weapon systems from a distance or through information operations. Standoff attacks can be conducted by air, maritime, or by ground platforms or units. When targets can be sufficiently damaged or destroyed without the commitment of close-combat forces, these attacks can be performed as independent actions.\n\n3. Terminal Attack Control and Terminal Guidance Operations. These are actions to identify and precisely report the location of targets, and with global positioning systems, laser designators, beacons, or other means, conduct either terminal attack control (TAC) or terminal guidance operations (TGO) to effectively engage them. TAC involves actions to control the maneuver of and grant weapons release clearance to attacking aircraft. TGO includes any electronic, mechanical, voice or visual communication that provides approaching aircraft or weapons additional information regarding a specific location or target. TAC differs from TGO in that TAC includes the authority to clear aircraft to release ordnance and TGO does not. Because of this, TAC requires individuals to be qualified as joint terminal attack controllers, but TGO does not.\n\n4. Recovery Operations. These are operations conducted to search for, locate, identify, rescue, and return personnel, sensitive equipment, or items critical to national security. SO recovery missions are characterized by detailed planning, rehearsal, and thorough intelligence analysis. These operations employ unconventional tactics and techniques, clandestine search, possible indigenous assistance, and the frequent use of ground combat elements.\n\n5. Precision Destruction Operations. These are operations in which collateral damage must be minimized, requiring highly sophisticated weapons and/or timed detonation of specific amounts of explosives placed in exact locations to accomplish mission objectives. Precision destruction operations can be conducted against targets where precision-guided munitions cannot guarantee first strike successor when the contents of a facility must be destroyed without damage to that facility.\n\n6. Anti-Surface Operations. These are operations conducted against adversary maritime surface targets, including combatants. These include, but are not limited to, visit, board, search, and seizure operations which are shipboarding operations to board and seize cooperative, uncooperative, or hostile contacts of interest.\n\nSpecial Reconnaissance (SR)\n\nThese are reconnaissance and surveillance actions conducted as a special operation in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments to collect or verify information of strategic or operational significance, employing military capabilities not normally found in conventional forces. These actions provide an additive capability for commanders and supplement other conventional reconnaissance and surveillance actions. Even with today's sophisticated long-range sensors and overhead platforms, some information can be obtained only by visual observation or other collection methods in the target area. SOF's highly developed capabilities of gaining access to denied and hostile areas, worldwide communications, and specialized aircraft and sensors enable SR against targets inaccessible to other forces or assets. Activities within SR include the following:\n\n1. Environmental Reconnaissance. These are operations conducted to collect and report critical hydrographic, geological, and meteorological information.\n\n​\n\n2. Armed Reconnaissance. These are operations that involve locating and attacking targets of opportunity, e.g., adversary materiel, personnel, and facilities in assigned general areas or along assigned lines of communication. Armed reconnaissance is not conducted for the purpose of attacking specific identified targets.\n\n3. ​Target and Threat Assessment. These are operations conducted to detect, identify, locate, and assess a target to determine the most effective employment of weapons. This type of operation might include the assessment of the potential effects (to include collateral damage) of a strike or an attack on a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or toxic industrial material site.\n\n4. Poststrike Reconnaissance. These operations are undertaken for the purpose of gathering information used to measure results of a strike.\n\nForeign Internal Defense (FID)\n\nThese are operations that involve participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated organization, to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency. Both conventional and SOF units have a role and capability to conduct FID missions. SOF's primary role in this interagency activity is to assess, train, advise, and assist Host Nation (HN) military and paramilitary forces with the tasks that require their unique capabilities. The goal is to enable these forces to maintain the HN's internal stability, to counter subversion and violence in their country, and to address the causes of instability. Internal stability forms the shield behind which a nation-building campaign can succeed. Successful FID missions can lead to strategic successes for US foreign policy. FID activities include the following:\n\nHN Military Assistance. These are operations that train HN military individuals and units in tactical employment, sustainment, and integration of land, air, and maritime skills, provide advice and assistance to military leaders, and provide training on tactics, techniques, and procedures required to protect the HN from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency, and develop indigenous individual, leader, and organizational skills.\n\nPopulation Security. These are operations that strengthen population security by providing supervision of tactical operations conducted by HN military units to neutralize and destroy insurgent threats, isolate insurgents from the civil population, and protect the civil population. As a subset of FID, designated SOF units may also train select HN forces to perform counterterrorist missions.\n\nUnconventional Warfare (UW)\n\nThese are operations that involve a broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations, normally of long duration, predominantly conducted through, with, or by indigenous or surrogate forces who are organized, trained, equipped, supported, and directed in varying degrees by an external source. UW is unique in that it is a Special Operation (SO) that can either be conducted as part of a geographic combatant commander's overall theater campaign, or as an independent, subordinate campaign. When conducted independently, the primary focus of UW is on political-military objectives and psychological objectives. UW includes military and paramilitary aspects of resistance movements. UW military activity represents the culmination of a successful effort to organize and mobilize the civil populace against a hostile government or occupying power. From the US perspective, the intent is to develop and sustain these supported resistance organizations and to synchronize their activities to further US national security objectives. SOF units do not create resistance movements. They advise, train, and assist indigenous resistance movements already in existence to conduct UW and when required,accompany them into combat. When UW operations support conventional military operations, the focus shifts to primarily military objectives; however the political and psychological implications remain. Operational and strategic staffs and commanders must guard against limiting UW to a specific set of circumstances or activities defined by either recent events or personal experience. The most prevalent mistake is the belief that UW is limited to guerrilla warfare or insurgency. UW includes, but is not limited to, the following activities:\n\n1. Guerrilla Warfare. These are military and paramilitary operations conducted by irregular, predominantly indigenous forces in adversary-held or hostile territory. It is the military aspect of an insurgency or other armed resistance movement. Guerilla warfare techniques can undermine the legitimacy of the existing government or an occupying power as well as destroy, degrade, or divert military capabilities.\n\n2. Subversion. These operations are designed to undermine the military, economic, psychological, or political strength or morale of a regime or nation. The clandestine nature of subversion dictates that the underground elements perform the bulk of the activity.\n\n3. Sabotage. These are operations that involve an act or acts with intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of a country by willfully injuring or destroying, or attempting to injure or destroy, any national defense or war material, premises, or utilities, to include human and natural resources. Sabotage selectively disrupts, destroys, or neutralizes hostile capabilities with a minimum expenditure of manpower and materiel.\n\n4. Intelligence Activities. These activities assess areas of interest ranging from political and military personalities to the military capabilities of friendly and adversary forces. SOF perform intelligence activities ranging from developing information critical to planning and conducting operations, to assessing the capabilities and intentions of indigenous and coalition forces.\n\n5. Unconventional Assisted Recovery (UAR). These operations consist of UW forces establishing and operating unconventional assisted recovery mechanisms and unconventional assisted recovery teams. UAR operations are designed to seek out, contact, authenticate, and support military and other selected personnel as they move from an adversary-held, hostile, or sensitive area to areas under friendly control.\n\nCounterterrorism (CT)\n\nThese are operations that include the offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, preempt, and respond to terrorism. SOF's role and additive capability is to conduct offensive measures within DOD's overall combatting terrorism efforts. SOF conduct CT missions as special operations by covert, clandestine, or low visibility means. SOF's activities within CT include, but are not limited to, intelligence operations, attacks against terrorist networks and infrastructures, hostage rescue, recovery of sensitive material from terrorist organizations, and non-kinetic activities aimed at the ideologies or motivations that spawn terrorism:\n\n1. Intelligence Operations. These are operations to collect, exploit, and report information on terrorist organizations, personnel, assets, and/or activities. SOF have the capability to conduct these operations in an overt, covert, and/or clandestine manner.\n\n2. Network and Infrastructure Attacks. These are operations that involve preemptive strikes against terrorist organizations with the objective of destroying, disorganizing, or disarming terrorist organizations before they can strike targets of national interest.\n\n3. Hostage or Sensitive Materiel Recovery. These are operations conducted to rescue hostages and/or recover sensitive materiel from terrorist control, requiring capabilities not normally found in conventional military units. The safety of the hostages and preventing destruction of the sensitive materiel are essential mission requirements.\n\n4. Non-Kinetic Activities. These are actions that are focused on defeating the ideologies or motivations that spawn terrorism by non-kinetic means. These could include, but are not limited to, PSYOP, IO, CA operations, UW and/or FID.\n\n\"Big\" Army Picture\n\n2 basic types of Command:\n\n• Regional\n\n• Functional\n\nUnited States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM):\n\nUnited States Army Special Operation Command (USASOC):\n\nGeographical Alignment\n\nSF Groups (regiment) are geographically aligned (6 world regions)\n\n​\n\n• North America (USNORTHCOM)\n\nSpecial Operation Command North(SOCNORTH)\n\n• South America (SOUTHCOM)\n\nSpecial Operation Command South SOCSOUTH\n\n• Africa (AFRICOM)\n\nSpecial Operation Command Africa (SOCAFRICA)\n\n• Europe (USEUCOM)\n\nSpecial Operation Command Europe (SOCEUR)\n\n• Middle East (CENTCOM)\n\nSpecial Operation Command Central (SOCCENT)\n\n• Pacific (USINDOPACOM) (SOCPAC)\n\nSpecial Operation Command Pacific (SOCPAC)\n\n• US Forces Korea (USFK) (sub-unified command of USINDOPACOM)\n\nSpecial Operation Command Korea (SOCKOR)\n\nReal SF Organization\n\nSF Soldiers are known as 'force multipliers', as they equal a platoon(+) or company(-) of conventional units.\n\nAn SF structure/organization:\n\n• SF Group (5 active-duty Groups) (1st/3rd/5th/7th/10th)\n\n• SF Battalion (SFOD-C) (4 per Group) (1st/2nd/3rd/4th)\n\n• SF Company (SFOD-B) (3 per Battalion) (Aco/Bco/Cco)\n\n• SF Company HQ Team (SFOD-B) (1 per Company) (15 man team)\n\n• SF Team (SFOD-A) (6 per Company) (12 man team)\n\nThe smallest and most important element is the 'A' Team - (12 members)\n\nThere are 6 SFOD-A TMs in a company\n\n1 SFOD-B TM is in charge of the company\n\n1 SFOD-C is in charge of a battalion\n\nNo abbreviation exists for a SF Group TM (regiment)\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1st Special Forces Command (Airborne)\n\n​\n\n• Command for a Division unit but with fewer soldiers\n\nSubordinate units include:\n\n• Special Forces Groups (5 Active Duty Groups / 2 NG)\n\n• 1st SFC(A) Military Intelligence Battalion\n\n• Military Information Support Groups (PSY Ops)\n\n• Civil Affairs Brigade\n\n• Sustainment Brigade\n\nEach SF Group has:\n\n• Headquarter Company (HHC)\n\n• 4 Line Battalions\n\n​\n\n• Group Support Battalion\n\nEach SF Battalion has:\n\n• Headquarter Detachment (ODC)\n\n• 3 Line Companies\n\n• Battalion Support Company\n\nEach SF Company has:\n\n• Headquarter Element (ODB)\n\n​\n\n• 6 Line Teams (ODA)\n\nSpecial Forces Groups\n\nIn 1957 the two original special forces groups (10th and 77th) were joined by the 1st, stationed in the Far East. Additional groups were formed in 1961 and 1962 after President John F. Kennedy visited the Special Forces at Fort Bragg in 1961. Nine groups were organized for the reserve components in 1961. Among them were the 16th and 17th Special Forces Groups. However, 17th Special Forces Group, a National Guard formation with elements in Washington, was disestablished on 31 January 1966.\n\nIn the early twenty-first century, Special Forces are divided into five active duty (AD) and two Army National Guard (ARNG) Special Forces groups. Each Special Forces Group (SFG) has a specific regional focus. The Special Forces soldiers assigned to these groups receive intensive language and cultural training for countries within their regional area of responsibility (AOR). Due to the increased need for Special Forces soldiers in the War on Terror, all groups—including those of the National Guard (19th and 20th SFGs)—have been deployed outside of their areas of operation (AOs), particularly to Iraq and Afghanistan. A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUntil recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.\n\n​1st Special Forces Group ​\n\n3rd Special Forces Group\n\n​5th Special Forces Group\n\n7th Special Forces Group\n\n10th Special Forces Group\n\n19th Special Forces Group\n\n20th Special Forces Group\n\nA Special Forces group is historically assigned to a Unified Combatant Command or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions. They can form 6-man \"split A\" detachments that are often used for special reconnaissance.\n\nOnly Special Forces Operational Detachment Alphas & Bravos get named\n\nSFOD-C's don't commonly use an abbreviation\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n• Take the first number only of the SF Group (1/3/5/7/0)\n\n• Take the battalion number as the second number (1-4)\n\n• Take the company letter (A/B/C) and turn it into a number (1-3)\n\n• Take the SFOD-A or B team number (SFOD-A: 1-6 and SFPD-B: 0)\n\nFirst number - SF Groups are numbered (1/3/5/7/0)\n\nSecond number - SFOD-C's are numbered (1-3)\n\nThird number - SFOD-B's are numbered 0\n\nFourth number - SFOD-A's are numbered 1-6\n\nSpecial Forces Operational Detachment Alpha\n\n(SFOD-A)\n\nODAs are usually 12-man units, lead by a Captain. The ODA is the primary fighting force of the Special Forces. Each SF Company usually contains 6 ODAs.\n\nA Special Forces company normally consists of six Operational Detachments-A (ODA or \"A-Teams\").[55][56] Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.). Each ODA Team's number is unique.\n\nPrior to 2007, each SF Group had their own unique methods for numbering ODA Teams which often denoted that particular team's capabilities. Starting in 2007, though, the number sequence was standardized amongst all groups and the team number would now identify its group, battalion, company, and the team itself.\n\nThe first digit would specify group (1=1st SFG, 3=3rd SFG, 5=5th SF, 7=7th SFG, 0=10th SFG, 9=19th SFG, 2=20th SFG). The second digit would be 1-4 for 1st through 4th Battalion. The third digit would be 1-3 for A to C Companies. The fourth digit would be 1-6 for the particular team within that company. For example, ODA 1234 would signify 1st Special Forces Group, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Company, and the fourth ODA team within 3rd Company.\n\nThis organization facilitates 6-man \"split team\" operations, redundancy, and mentoring between a senior NCO and their junior assistant.\n\nThe SFODA is designed to organize, equip, train, advise or direct, and support indigenous military or paramilitary forces engaged in UW or FID activities. Using its inherent capabilities, the SFODA also performs other SF missions and collateral activities such as direct action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, etc. The time-tested composition of the SFODA remains as viable and relevant today as it has been throughout SF’s history. The commander of an SFODA is a captain. His two primary assistants are an assistant detachment commander (an SF warrant officer) and an operations sergeant (a master sergeant). The SFODA has one assistant operations and intelligence sergeant and two specialists in each of the four primary SF functional areas (weapons, engineer, medical, and communications). By having two of each of the specialties, the SFODA can conduct split-team operations when the situation does not warrant the employment of the full team or when the commander believes it is prudent to do so. During split-team operations, the detachment commander and the assistant detachment commander each commands one of the split teams. The operations sergeant and the second-ranking NCO on the detachment each serves as the senior NCOs on one of the split teams. The SFODA can serve as a manpower pool from which higher SF commanders can organize a tailored composite team to perform a specific mission.\n\nThe SFODA can--\n\n• Plan and conduct SF operations separately or as part of a larger force.\n\n• Infiltrate and exfiltrate specified operational areas by air, land, and sea.\n\n• Conduct operations in remote areas and hostile environments for extended periods of time with a minimum of external direction and support.\n\n• Develop, organize, equip, train, and advise or direct indigenous forces up to battalion size.\n\n• Train, advise, and assist other U.S. and multinational forces and agencies.\n\n• Plan and conduct unilateral SF operations.\n\n• Perform other SO activities as directed by higher authority.\n\nAll detachment members are capable of training, advising, assisting, or directing foreign counterparts in their functional areas up through battalion level. To ensure functional coverage of all premission activities, the SFODA commander organizes a detachment staff using METT-TC. Detachment staff members perform functional duties in addition to the standard SF duties. SF soldiers often hold more than one of the 18 series MOSs. Further cross-training is fundamental to SF training. All team members can use a mortar, send a burst message, construct a demolition charge, and start an intravenous infusion. These additional skills are important in maintaining split-team operations and a mission-capable status in the event of a casualty. Each member of an SFODA has specific performance requirements in planning and conducting operations.\n\nEach SF Team has:\n\n12 Special Forces soldiers which includes;\n\n• 1x Detachment Commander / Commanding Officer (18A)\n\nCaptain\n\nThe Detachment Commander is a Captain who has been awarded the 18A MOS. He commands the detachment and is responsible for everything that the detachment does or fails to do. Detachment commanders are responsible for commanding their team on a tactical and strategic level. The commander may command or advise an indigenous battalion combat force. The commander will regularly meet abroad with the country team to include ambassadors, foreign ministers of defense and foreign presidents. He ensures their detachment is trained for combat anytime, anywhere and in any environment. The commander ensures that they and all of their detachment members are cross-trained on all assigned equipment and duties in case of injury or death to a detachment member during a mission.\n\nThe 18A Commands or serves on the staff of Special Forces units.

ODBs provide support in:\n\n• Training\n\n• Intelligence\n\n• Counter-intelligence\n\nThe SFOD-B plans and conducts SO activities in any operational environment—permissive, uncertain, or hostile. In garrison, the SFODB commands and controls its own organic SFODAs. The SF company commander, an experienced SF major, normally has more authority and greater freedom of action than do conventional Army company commanders. When deployed, the SFODB functions as a separate operational detachment with its own assigned mission. The mission may require the SFODB to operate separately or to exercise OPCON of a mix of organic and attached SFODAs.\n\nA significant difference exists between conventional Army companies and SFODBs. Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti (1994–95) illustrates this difference. During the operation, SFODBs acted as area commands providing C2 to the SFODAs, which in turn performed peacekeeping missions throughout the country. Early in the operation, 5 SFODBs commanded 30 SFODAs, which made up the entire U.S. presence outside Port-au-Prince, the capital city, and the city of Cap Haitien. This presence encompassed 90 percent of Haiti’s land area and was the peacekeeping effort for approximately 5 million Haitians. Later in the operation, two additional SFODBs arrived with more SFODAs, bringing the total number of deployed teams to 44 with the same requirements as the original force.\n\nThe SFODB is a multipurpose C2 element with many employment options. It can exercise C2 over one to six SFODAs. The SFODB’s primary missions are to act as an advanced operational base (AOB), a SOCCE, or an isolation facility (ISOFAC). All three of these missions may require augmentation with USAF special weather observers or other personnel as required. The SFODB can also deploy to conduct SF operations in a specified AO or JSOA.\n\nThe SFODB plans and conducts SF operations separately or as part of a larger force. It also—\n\n• Trains and prepares SFODAs for deployment.\n\n• Establishes and operates, when augmented, an AOB to expand the C2 capabilities of an SFOB or an FOB (Forward Operating Base).\n\n• Infiltrates and exfiltrates specified operational areas by air, land, or sea.\n\n• Conducts operations in remote areas and hostile environments for extended periods with minimal external direction and support.\n\n• Develops, organizes, equips, trains, and advises or directs indigenous forces up to regiment size in SO activities.\n\n• Trains, advises, and assists other U.S. and multinational forces and agencies.\n\n• Serves as a SOCCE (Special Operations Command & Control Elements) at a corps-level or higher conventional HQ.

It consists of all-source intelligence analysts and IMINT analysts. The ACT responds to all-source intelligence support taskings from the battalion S2. The all-source intelligence analysts within the ACT monitor the unit collection plan and identify new requirements to close intelligence gaps. The ACT receives and validates all RIIs (Requests for Intelligence Information) and RFIs (Requests for information) from subordinate units and assigns them with the commander’s prioritization to the appropriate team of the S2 section. The ACT informs the S2 of PIR satisfaction and recommends new PIR, IRs, and SIRs. It reports intelligence to higher or lateral HQ, based on guidance from the S2, and coordinates dissemination of intelligence to subordinate and attached units. They are responsible for IPB, situation and target development, and BDA. All members of the ACT contribute to the preparation of the S2’s intelligence estimate.\n\nThe ACT produces and updates TIPs for the SFODAs, SFODBs, and SOT-As. They maintain and use the unit intelligence reference files and databases, including the SOCRATES intelligence ADP system. The ACT personnel translate all PIR from the group or the JFSOCC into SIRs for tasking to SFODAs, SFODBs, and SOT-As. The ACT personnel prepare INTSUMs, IIRs, and responses to RIIs and present intelligence briefings as required. The ACT provides all-source analysis and intelligence production support to the SF battalion. The all-source analysts within the ACT focus and refine the efforts of three single-source suborganizations—the IMINT analyst, the SIGINT traffic analysis team, and the CI-HUMINT team. The CI-HUMINT team consists of two CI agents, augmented by two interrogators from the group MID. The interrogators are attached according to the target language of the battalion’s current mission. The CI-HUMINT soldiers on this team are responsible for a large number of tactical CI-HUMINT analysis, production, collection, and operational support activities. The team produces IIRs and other formatted reports to disseminate the results of CI-HUMINT collection and liaison activities. The team uses locally collected intelligence and theater\n\nCI-HUMINT products to assess a wide variety of threats within the battalion AOR. These threats include, but are not limited to, FIS; insurgents, terrorists, and criminals; dissident political factions; and anti-U.S. elements of the civilian populace. The CI HUMINT team prepares and maintains the battalion MDCI (multi discipline counterintelligence)estimate, as well as comprehensive base defense, COMMZ (Communication Zone), and HN rear area IPB products. These products permit the timely reporting of indications and warning (I&W) information and predictive analysis on significant OPSEC and FP threats. The CI-HUMINT specialists develop the profiles of the friendly force and identify friendly vulnerabilities.\n\n​ In response to the situation and collection taskings from the S2, the CI-HUMINT team plans, coordinates, and conducts CI liaison, EPW interrogation, document exploitation, overt collection, and displaced civilian debriefings. The team also serves as the OPCEN focal point for FP activities. It recommends EEFI (Essential Elements of Friendly Information) and threat countermeasures, ensures compliance with intelligence oversight regulations, and continually assesses the effectiveness of the base OPSEC countermeasures and base security plans. The CI team supports the OPSEC plan by providing SAEDA briefings and limited investigations. It also provides CI and security site surveys in support of FOB relocation within the country or theater, as required.\n\n• 1xMedical Section\n\nThe battalion medical section provides CHS to the battalion and its attached elements. This support includes unit-level medical support and health services logistics (including maintenance of the Class VIII basic load), emergency medical and resuscitative treatment for all classes of patients, emergency dental treatment, and preventive medicine support. Veterinary support is coordinated through the group medical section.\n\n• 1xBattalion Support Company\n\nThe BSC provides routine administrative and logistics support to the battalion HQ detachment, the company’s organic elements, and the FOB SPTCENs and SIGCENs. The support company commander commands all personnel and elements assigned or attached to the company. He is the battalion’s primary logistics officer. When the battalion establishes an FOB, he may serve as the SPTCEN director. His duties require direct interface with the GSC or battalion and TA logistics support elements. In coordination with the S3 and HQ commandant, the support company commander prepares the base defense plan and supervises the activities of the BDOC. When all SFODBs are committed to other missions, the SPTCEN commander commands all the uncommitted SFODAs and attached SOT-As at the FOB and supervises their premission training activities in coordination with the OPCEN.\n\n• ​1x Service Detachment\n\nThe service detachment performs unit-level supply, service, and maintenance functions for the entire SF battalion and its attached elements. When the battalion establishes an FOB, the service detachment commander coordinates and supervises SPTCEN logistics activities. He works for the BSC commander under the staff supervision of the S4. The battalion service detachment does not have organic truck drivers in its supply and transportation section.\n\n• ​1x ​Signal Detachment\n\n​. The battalion signal detachment has two primary functions. It installs, operates, and maintains secure FOB radio communications with the SFOB (or other higher HQ) and deployed SFODAs and SOCCEs under the FOB’s direct control. It also installs, operates, and maintains continuous internal FOB communications. This base communications support includes message center services, internal telephone communications, and electronic maintenance. The detachment has no organic multimedia or COMSEC section; however, the signal detachment normally maintains its own COMSEC subaccount. When the battalion establishes an FOB, the signal detachment commander serves as the SIGCEN SYSCON officer and assistant SIGCEN director. When the detachment is formally detached from the support company, the detachment commander exercises normal company-level command. The detachment, however, depends on the support company for administrative and logistics support.\n\nGroup Support Battalion\n\nThe Group Support Battalion supports the Special Forces Group HHC and consists of 3 companies that provide;\n\n• Logistics\n\n• Intelligence\n\n• Medical\n\n• Signals support.\n\nThe Group Support Battalion provides intelligence, signal, and CSS to a Special Forces Group. It controls consolidated facilities and activities when a SF Group consolidate support operations. It also augments the resources of the battalion support companies when subordinate battalions establish FOBs. The GSB has a sufficient pool of resources to augment up to three separate FOBs. With augmentation, an SFOB (Special Forces Operating Base) routinely deploys its three FOBs to locations separate from the SFOB. This arrangement provides operational flexibility to the SFOB commander. The GSB commander commands all personnel and elements assigned or attached to the company. His company HQ provides routine administrative and logistics support to the SFOB SPTCENs and SIGCENs (Signal Centers). He is the group’s primary logistics point of contact. When the group establishes an SFOB, he serves as the SPTCEN director. His duties require direct interface with TA logistics support elements. In coordination with the S3 and HQ commandant, the GSB commander prepares the base defense plan and supervises the activities of the base defense operations center (BDOC).\n\n• ​1x Forward Support Company\n\nThe forward support company provides routine administrative and logistics support to the SF battalions. The forward support company comprises the sustainment, distribution, and maintenance platoons. The forward support company is a multifunctional logistics company providing maintenance, limited Class I through Class IX supplies, fuel and water production, ammunition holding, and transportation. The forward support company is capable of providing for the entire SF battalion and its attached elements. When the SF battalion establishes a SOTF, the forward support company commander may coordinate and supervise the support center logistics activities.\n\n• ​1xAdvanced Skills Company\n\nThe group advanced skills company is primarily responsible for training group-assigned elements or other specified personnel in select SF skill sets. The company contains a command section and the following elements:\n\nLanguage and Cultural Section.\n\nThis section manages the group’s language lab and obtains contract support for short-duration language training, as necessary. This section maintains and updates area handbooks and cultural information to support ODA missions, and provides or contracts for translation support of documents and training material. When formed as the isolation facility, Soldiers from this section serve as liaison officers to isolated operational detachments.\n\nCombat Environmental Section.\n\nThis section is responsible for researching, acquiring, and maintaining group area of responsibility-specific limited-use equipment that is not issued to ODAs because of prohibitive cost. This equipment includes items such as ground mobility vehicles, ski and snow equipment, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, extreme cold-weather suits, and pack animal equipment. This section maintains subject-matter expertise on the use and maintenance of the equipment as well as the ability to provide training in the proper use of the equipment to ODAs during isolation and future operations. This section is also responsible for unit sustainment and training in survival and evasion tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as the conduct of a survival, evasion, resistance, and escape level B program. When formed as the isolation facility, this section serves as liaison officers to the isolated ODAs.\n\nMaritime Operations Section.\n\nThis section provides accountability and maintenance of all equipment used in the conduct of scuba, underwater breathing apparatus, and small-boat operations in accordance with applicable policies and regulations. All SF Soldiers assigned to his section will be qualified combat divers on active dive status. When formed as the isolation facility, this section facilitates the training and rehearsals of isolated ODAs.\n\nSpecial Forces Advanced Urban Combat and Advanced Combat Skills Section.\n\nThis section trains ODAs and SF companies in SF advanced urban combat tactics, techniques, and procedures on a rotational basis. This section may be directed by the commander to train personnel in other advanced combat skills, such as advanced marksmanship training or unarmed combat. When formed as the isolation facility, this section in conjunction with the operations detachment command section will form the isolation facility operations cell and support cells.\n\nAdvanced Special Operations Techniques and Advanced Target Section.\n\nThis section is responsible for training group personnel and ODAs in the use of SF advanced special operations techniques. This section also conducts operations as directed by the group commander. This section is responsible for conducting liaison as necessary to support group training and operational initiatives.\n\nSpecial Forces Sniper Course Section.\n\nThis section is responsible for training group-assigned Soldiers in SF sniper course tactics, techniques, and procedures on a rotational basis, to include conducting refresher training for group-assigned Soldiers previously qualified as special operations snipers. This section may also be tasked to conduct advanced marksmanship training. When formed as the isolation facility, this section facilitates the training and rehearsals of isolated ODAs.\n\nSpecial Operations Forces Multipurpose Canine Section.\n\nThe SOF multipurpose canine section provides a handler and a SOF multipurpose canine capable for use in the scout dog role, mine and tunnel exploitation and search, rural and urban combat"
