YALTA (CRIMEA) CONFERENCE February, 1945 Washington, March 24 - The text of the agreements reached at the Crimea (Yalta) Conference between President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill and Generalissimo Stalin, as released by the State Department today, follows: PROTOCOL OF PROCEEDINGS OF CRIMEA CONFERENCE The Crimea Conference of the heads of the Governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which took place from Feb. 4 to 11, came to the following conclusions: I. WORLD ORGANIZATION It was decided: 1. That a United Nations conference on the proposed world organization should be summoned for Wednesday, 25 April, 1945, and should be held in the United States of America. 2. The nations to be invited to this conference should be: (a) the United Nations as they existed on 8 Feb., 1945; and (b) Such of the Associated Nations as have declared war on the common enemy by 1 March, 1945. (For this purpose, by the term \"Associated Nations\" was meant the eight Associated Nations and Turkey.) When the conference on world organization is held, the delegates of the United Kingdom and United State of America will support a proposal to admit to original membership two Soviet Socialist Republics, i.e., the Ukraine and White Russia. 3. That the United States Government, on behalf of the three powers, should consult the Government of China and the French Provisional Government in regard to decisions taken at the present conference concerning the proposed world organization. 4. That the text of the invitation to be issued to all the nations which would take part in the United Nations conference should be as follows: \"The Government of the United States of America, on behalf of itself and of the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialistic Republics and the Republic of China and of the Provisional Government of the French Republic invite the Government of -------- to send representatives to a conference to be held on 25 April, 1945, or soon thereafter , at San Francisco, in the United States of America, to prepare a charter for a general international organization for the maintenance of international peace and security. \"The above-named Governments suggest that the conference consider as affording a basis for such a Charter the proposals for the establishment of a general international organization\n\n18. which were made public last October as a result of the Dumbarton Oaks conference and which have now been supplemented by the following provisions for Section C of Chapter VI: C. Voting \"1. Each member of the Security Council should have one vote. \"2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters should be made by an affirmative vote of seven members. \"3. Decisions of the Security Council on all matters should be made by an affirmative vote of seven members, including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VIII, Section A and under the second sentence of Paragraph 1 of Chapter VIII, Section C, a party to a dispute should abstain from voting.' \"Further information as to arrangements will be transmitted subsequently. \"In the event that the Government of -------- desires in advance of the conference to present views or comments concerning the proposals, the Government of the United States of America will be pleased to transmit such views and comments to the other participating Governments.\" Territorial trusteeship: It was agreed that the five nations which will have permanent seats on the Security Council should consult each other prior to the United Nations conference on the question of territorial trusteeship. The acceptance of this recommendation is subject to its being made clear that territorial trusteeship will only apply to (a) existing mandates of the League of Nations; (b) territories detached from the enemy as a result of the present war; (c) any other territory which might voluntarily be placed under trusteeship; and (d) no discussion of actual territories is contemplated at the forthcoming United Nations conference or in the preliminary consultations, and it will be a matter for subsequent agreement which territories within the above categories will be place under trusteeship. [Begin first section published Feb., 13, 1945.] II. DECLARATION OF LIBERATED EUROPE The following declaration has been approved: The Premier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States of America have consulted with each other in the common interests of the people of their countries and those of liberated Europe. They jointly declare their mutual agreement to concert during the temporary period of instability in\n\n19. liberated Europe the policies of their three Governments in assisting the peoples liberated from the domination of Nazi Germany and the peoples of the former Axis satellite states of Europe to solve by democratic means their pressing political and economic problems. The establishment of order in Europe and the rebuilding of national economic life must be achieved by processes which will enable the liberated peoples to destroy the last vestiges of nazism and fascism and to create democratic institutions of their own choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter - the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they will live - the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government to those peoples who have been forcibly deprived to them by the aggressor nations. To foster the conditions in which the liberated people may exercise these rights, the three governments will jointly assist the people in any European liberated state or former Axis state in Europe where, in their judgment conditions require, (a) to establish conditions of internal peace; (b) to carry out emergency relief measures for the relief of distressed peoples; (c) to form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of Governments responsive to the will of the people; and (d) to facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections. The three Governments will consult the other United Nations and provisional authorities or other Governments in Europe when matters of direct interest to them are under consideration. When, in the opinion of the three Governments, conditions in any European liberated state or former Axis satellite in Europe make such action necessary, they will immediately consult together on the measure necessary to discharge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration. By this declaration we reaffirm our faith in the principles of the Atlantic Charter, our pledge in the Declaration by the United Nations and our determination to build in cooperation with other peace-loving nations world order, under law, dedicated to peace, security, freedom and general well-being of all mankind. In issuing this declaration, the three powers express the hope that the Provisional Government of the French Republic may be associated with them in the procedure suggested. [End first section published Feb., 13, 1945.] III. DISMEMBERMENT OF GERMANY It was agreed that Article 12 (a) of the Surrender terms for Germany should be amended to read as follows:\n\n20. \"The United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics shall possess supreme authority with respect to Germany. In the exercise of such authority they will take such steps, including the complete dismemberment of Germany as they deem requisite for future peace and security.\" The study of the procedure of the dismemberment of Germany was referred to a committee consisting of Mr. Anthony Eden, Mr. John Winant, and Mr. Fedor T. Gusev. This body would consider the desirability of associating with it a French representative. IV. ZONE OF OCCUPATION FOR THE FRENCH AND CONTROL COUNCIL FOR GERMANY. It was agreed that a zone in Germany, to be occupied by the French forces, should be allocated France. This zone would be formed out of the British and American zones and its extent would be settled by the British and Americans in consultation with the French Provisional Government. It was also agreed that the French Provisional Government should be invited to become a member of the Allied Control Council for Germany. V. REPARATION The following protocol has been approved: Protocol On the Talks Between the Heads of Three Governments at the Crimean Conference on the Question of the German Reparations in Kind 1. Germany must pay in kind for the losses caused by her to the Allied nations in the course of the war. Reparations are to be received in the first instance by those countries which have borne the main burden of the war, have suffered the heaviest losses and have organized victory over the enemy. 2. Reparation in kind is to be exacted from Germany in three following forms: (a) Removals within two years from the surrender of Germany or the cessation of organized resistance from the national wealth of Germany located on the territory of Germany herself as well as outside her territory (equipment, machine tools, ships, rolling stock, German investments abroad, shares of industrial, transport and other enterprises in Germany, etc.), these removals to be carried out chiefly for the purpose of destroying the war potential of Germany. (b) Annual deliveries of goods from current production for a period to be fixed. (c) Use of German labor.\n\n21. 3. For the working out on the above principles of a detailed plan for exaction of reparation from Germany an Allied reparation commission will be set up in Moscow. It will consist of three representatives - one from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, one from the United Kingdom and one from the United States of America. 4. With regard to the fixing of the total sum of the reparation as well as the distribution of it among the countries which suffered from the German aggression, the Soviet and American delegations agreed as follows: \"The Moscow reparation commission should take in its initial studies as a basis for discussion the suggestion of the Soviet Government that the total sum of the reparation in accordance with the points (a) and (b) of the Paragraph 2 should be 22 billion dollars and that 50 per cent should go to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\" The British delegation was of the opinion that, pending consideration of the reparation question by the Moscow reparation commission, no figures of reparation should be mentioned. The above Soviet-American proposal has been passed to the Moscow reparation commission as one of the proposals to be considered by the commission. VI. MAJOR WAR CRIMINALS The conference agreed that the question of the major war criminals should be the subject of inquiry by the three Foreign Secretaries for report in due course after the close of the conference. [Begin second section published Feb. 13, 1945.] VII. POLAND The following declaration on Poland was agreed by the conference: \"A new situation has been created in Poland as a result of her complete liberation by the Red Army. This calls for the establishment of a Polish Provisional Government which can be more broadly based than was possible before the recent liberation of the western part of Poland. The Provisional Government which is now functioning in Poland should therefore be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from Poles abroad. This new Government should then be called the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity. \"M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman and Sir A. Clark Kerr are authorized as a commission to consult in the first instance in Moscow with members of the present Provisional Government and with other\n\n22. Polish democratic leaders from within Poland and from abroad, with a view to the reorganization of the present Government along the above lines. This Polish Provisional Government of National Unity shall be pledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot. In these elections all democratic and anti-Nazi parties shall have the right to take part and to put forward candidates. \"When a Polish Provisional of Government National Unity has been properly formed in conformity with the above, the Government of the U.S.S.R., which now maintains diplomatic relations with the present Provisional Government of Poland, and the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States of America will establish diplomatic relations with the new Polish Provisional Government National Unity, and will exchange Ambassadors by whose reports the respective Governments will be kept informed about the situation in Poland. \"The three heads of Government consider that the eastern frontier of Poland should follow the Curzon Line with digressions from it in some regions of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland. They recognize that Poland must receive substantial accessions in territory in the north and west. They feel that the opinion of the new Polish Provisional Government of National Unity should be sought in due course of the extent of these accessions and that the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should thereafter await the peace conference.\" VIII. YOGOSLAVIA It was agreed to recommend to Marshal Tito and to Dr. Ivan Subasitch: (a) That the Tito-Subasitch agreement should immediately be put into effect and a new government formed on the basis of the agreement. (b) That as soon as the new Government has been formed it should declare: (I) That the Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation (AVNOJ) will be extended to include members of the last Yugoslav Skupstina who have not compromised themselves by collaboration with the enemy, thus forming a body to be known as a temporary Parliament and (II) That legislative acts passed by the Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation (AVNOJ) will be subject to subsequent ratification by a Constituent Assembly; and that this statement should be published in the communiqué of the conference. [End second section published Feb. 13, 1945.] IX. ITALO-YOGOSLAV FRONTIER - ITALO-ASUTRIAN FRONTIER\n\n23. Notes on these subjects were put in by the British delegation and the American and Soviet delegations agreed to consider them and give their views later. X. YUGOSLAV-BULGARIAN RELATIONS There was an exchange of views between the Foreign Secretaries on the question of the desirability of a Yugoslav-Bulgarian pact of alliance. The question at issue was whether a state still under an armistice regime could be allowed to enter into a treaty with another state. Mr. Eden suggested that the Bulgarian and Yugoslav Governments should be informed that this could not be approved. Mr. Stettinius suggested that the British and American Ambassadors should discuss the matter further with Mr. Molotov in Moscow. Mr. Molotov agreed with the proposal of Mr. Stettinius. XI. SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE The British delegation put in notes for the consideration of their colleagues on the following subjects: (a) The Control Commission in Bulgaria. (b) Greek claims upon Bulgaria, more particularly with reference to reparations. (c) Oil equipment in Rumania. XII. IRAN Mr. Eden, Mr. Stettinius and Mr. Molotov exchanged views on the situation in Iran. It was agreed that this matter should be pursued through the diplomatic channel. [Begin third section published Feb. 13, 1945.] XIII. MEETINGS OF THE THREE FOREIGN SECRETARIES The conference agreed that permanent machinery should be set up for consultation between the three Foreign Secretaries; they should meet as often as necessary, probably about every three or four months. These meetings will be held in rotation in the three capitals, the first meeting being held in London. [End third section published Feb. 13, 1945.] XIV. THE MONTREAUX CONVENTION AND THE STRAITS It was agreed that at the next meeting of the three Foreign Secretaries to be held in London, they should consider proposals which it was understood the Soviet Government would put forward in relation to the Montreaux Convention, and report to their Governments. The Turkish Government should be informed at the\n\n24. appropriate moment. The forgoing protocol was approved and signed by the three Foreign Secretaries at the Crimean Conference Feb. 11, 1945. E. R. Stettinius Jr. M. Molotov Anthony Eden AGREEMENT REGARDING JAPAN The leaders of the three great powers - the Soviet Union, the United States of America and Great Britain - have agreed that in two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated, the Soviet Union shall enter into war against Japan on the side of the Allies on condition that: 1. The status quo in Outer Mongolia (the Mongolian People's Republic) shall be preserved. 2. The former rights of Russia violated by the treacherous attack of Japan in 1904 shall be restored, viz.: (a) The southern part of Sakhalin as well as the islands adjacent to it shall be returned to the Soviet Union; (b) The commercial port of Dairen shall be internationalized, the pre-eminent interests of the Soviet Union in this port being safeguarded, and the lease of Port Arthur as a naval base of the U.S.S.R. restored; (c) The Chinese-Eastern Railroad and the South Manchurian Railroad, which provide an outlet to Dairen, shall be jointly operated by the establishment of a joint Soviet-Chinese company, it being understood that the pre-eminent interests of the Soviet Union shall be safeguarded and that China shall retain sovereignty in Manchuria; 3. The Kurile Islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union. It is understood that the agreement concerning Outer Mongolia and the ports and railroads referred to above will require concurrence of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The President will take measures in order to maintain this concurrence on advice from Marshal Stalin. The heads of the three great powers have agreed that these claims of the Soviet Union shall be unquestionably fulfilled after Japan has been defeated. For its part, the Soviet Union expresses it readiness to conclude with the National Government of China a pact of friendship and alliance between the U.S.S.R. and China in order to render assistance to China with its armed forces for the purpose of liberating China from the Japanese yoke.

Foreign Relations of the United States 1945-1950 Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment Department of State Washington, DC Psychological and Political Warfare 292. National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects NSC 10/2 Washington, June 18, 1948. //Source: National Archives and Records Administration, RG 273, Records of the National Security Council, NSC 10/2. Top Secret. Although undated, this directive was approved by the National Security Council at its June 17 meeting and the final text, incorporating changes made at the meeting, was circulated to members by the Executive Secretary under a June 18 note. (Ibid.) See the Supplement. NSC 10/2 and the June 18 note are also reproduced in CIA Cold War Records: The CIA under Harry Truman, pp. 213-216. 1. The National Security Council, taking cognizance of the vicious covert activities of the USSR, its satellite countries and Communist groups to discredit and defeat the aims and activities of the United States and other Western powers, has determined that, in the interests of world peace and US national security, the overt foreign activities of the US Government must be supplemented by covert operations. 2. The Central Intelligence Agency is charged by the National Security Council with conducting espionage and counter-espionage operations abroad. It therefore seems desirable, for operational reasons, not to create a new agency for covert operations, but in time of peace to place the responsibility for them within the structure of the Central Intelligence Agency and correlate them with espionage and counter-espionage operations under the over-all control of the Director of Central Intelligence. 3. Therefore, under the authority of Section 102(d)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947, the National Security Council hereby directs that in time of peace: a. A new Office of Special Projects shall be created within the Central Intelligence Agency to plan and conduct covert operations; and in coordination with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan and prepare for the conduct of such operations in wartime. b. A highly qualified person, nominated by the Secretary of State, acceptable to the Director of Central Intelligence and approved by the National Security Council, shall be appointed as Chief of the Office of Special Projects. c. The Chief of the Office of Special Projects shall report directly to the Director of Central Intelligence. For purposes of security and of flexibility of operations, and to the maximum degree consistent with efficiency, the Office of Special Projects shall operate independently of other components of Central Intelligence Agency. d. The Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for: (1) Ensuring, through designated representatives of the Secretary of State/1/ and of the Secretary of Defense, that covert operations are planned and conducted in a manner consistent with US foreign and military policies and with overt activities. In disagreements arising between the Director of Central Intelligence and the representative of the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense over such plans, the matter shall be referred to the National Security Council for decision. /1/According to an August 13 memorandum from Davies to Kennan, Kennan was subsequently appointed as the representative of the Secretary of State. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Records of the Department of State, Policy Planning Staff Files 1947-53: Lot 64 D 563) See the Supplement. (2) Ensuring that plans for wartime covert operations are also drawn up with the assistance of a representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and are accepted by the latter as being consistent with and complementary to approved plans for wartime military operations. (3) Informing, through appropriate channels, agencies of the US Government, both at home and abroad (including diplomatic and military representatives in each area), of such operations as will affect them. e. Covert operations pertaining to economic warfare will be conducted by the Office of Special Projects under the guidance of the departments and agencies responsible for the planning of economic warfare. f. Supplemental funds for the conduct of the proposed operations for fiscal year 1949 shall be immediately requested. Thereafter operational funds for these purposes shall be included in normal Central Intelligence Agency Budget requests. 4. In time of war, or when the President directs, all plans for covert operations shall be coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In active theaters of war where American forces are engaged, covert operations will be conducted under the direct command of the American Theater Commander and orders therefor will be transmitted through the Joint Chiefs of Staff unless otherwise directed by the President. 5. As used in this directive, \"covert operations\" are understood to be all activities (except as noted herein) which are conducted or sponsored by this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.

Basic Precepts a. An irregular force is the out,w:lrtl ~rltlnifestatioriof :Lrcsistanco movement against the local govornmcnt by some portion of the popula- tion of an area. Therefore, t h growth and continuation of :1n ir- regular force is dependent on support furnished by the populntiot~\n\n85. even though the irregular form also receives support from an external power. b. When an irregular force is in its for~nativestage i t may IN eliminated by the employment of civil law enforcement measures and removal of the factors which cause the resistance movement. Once formed, an irregular force is usually too strong to be eliminated by such measures. A stronger form, such as a military unit, can destroy the irregular force, but the resistance movement will, when convinced that it is militarily feasible to do so, reconstitute the irregular form unless the original causative factors are also rerno&d or alleviated. o. The ultimate objective of operations against an irregular force is to eliminate the irregular form and prevent its resurgence. To attain this objective the following tasks must be accomplished : (1) The establishment of an effective intelligence system to furnish detailed, accurate, and current knowledge of the irregular force. (2) The physical separation of guerrilla elements from each other, their support base in the local population, under- ground elements, and any sponsoring power. (8) The destruction of irregular force elements by the defection, surrender, capture, o r death of individual members. (4) The provision of political, economic, and social necessities and the ideological reeducation of dissident elements of the population to prevent resurgence of the irregular force. d. Principles of operation : (1) Direction of the military and civil effort a t each level is vested in a single authority, either military or civil. (2) Military actions are conducted in consonance with specified civil rights, liberties, and objectives. (8) Operations are planned to be predominantly offensiva operations. , (4) Police, combat, and civic action operations are conclucteci simultaneously. ( t i ) Task forces employed against guerrilla elements are organized to have a higher degree of aggressiveness and mobility than the guerrilla elements. Section 11. OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 4. ideological Basis for Resistance a. The fundamental cause of large-scale resistance movements stems from the dissatisfaction of some portion of the population, whether real, imagined, or incited, with the prevailing political, social, or oco- nomic conditions. This dissatisfaction is usually centered around n desire for one or more of the following:\n\n86. ( 1) Nnt ionnl independence. (2) Relief from actual or alleged oppression. ( 3 ) El iminnt ion of foreign occupation or e~ploitat~ion. (4) Economic and social improvement,. (5) Eliminat,ion of corruption. ( 6 ) Religious expression. h . \"l n-cnantxy\" factors may cuuse :I resistnuco movement to form locally or n resist-nncemovement may be inspired by \"out-of-country\" element8 who create and sponsor such s movement ns a means of pro- moting their o w n cause. Often, another country will lend support to :I local resistnnco movement and nttempt to c*ont,roli t to flirther its own ainm c. Itosi~itmce nlovernents begin to form when ciissntisfnction occ~trs :mong ~t~rongly motivated individuals who cnnnot furt>hertheir cnum by peaceful and legal means. Under ~ppmprinte conditions, the atti- tudes and beliefs of them individuals, who are willing to risk t h i r lives for thoir beliefs, spread to family groups and neighbors. Tho population of entire areas may soon evidence widespread discontmt. When legnl recourse is denied, discontent grows into disaffection : i d members of the population participate in irregular activities. d. Small dissident groups living and working within the estab- lished order grdually organize into underpronnd elements that con- duct covert irregular activities. As members of underground organi- zations :ire identified and as the spirit of resistnnco grows, overt. guerrilla I):~tltls IIC form in secure wens : ~ n dI ~ c c o l ~t ~ c mili t:tr8y :irm of tho i rregular force.

Onco indivirluals have participated in irregular nctivities, sllorlltl tllcro lw :iny c.I~:mge heart, they tiro usually forced to eontil~t~c, of ritllor by prrssurc f rsm their comrndcs or by lwing c1esign:~txd(*rim- innls by loc:ll :iuthority. 5. Irregular Force Organization a. The organization of irregular forces varies ciccordirlg to purpose, terrain, character and density of population, :tvail:ibiIity of food, medical supplies, arms and equipment, quality of leadership, amount and nature of external support and direction, and the count,ermensurc.q used against them. Units or elements may vary in size from n few saboteurs to organized paramilitary units of division size or larger with extensive support oqpnizations. 6. A large irregular force normally consists of two organized ele- ments :a guerrilla element which operates overtly, and an underground element which operates covertly. Members of large guerrill:~units\n\n87. are usually severed from their normal civilian pursuits while mem- bers of small guerrilla bands may alternately be either guerrillas or apparently peaceful citizens. Members of the underground usually maintain their civilian pursuits, Both elements are usually supported by individuals and small groups who may or may not be formal members of either element but who furnish aid in intelligence, evasion and escape, and supplies. Such supportsrs are often considered to be a part of the underground. A given individual may be a member of two or more orgnnizations and may participate in many forms of irregular activity. 0. The underground elements of an irregular foiw must conduct the majority of their activities in a covert manner because of the coun- termeasures used against them. They are usuaIly found in all resist- ance areas. Successful organizations are compartmented by cells for security reasons. The cellular organization prevents one member, upon capture, from compromising the entire organization (fig. 1). d. Organized guerrilla units are usually found in areas where the terrain minimizes the mobility, surveillance, and firepower advantage of the opposing fore. They vary from small groups who are lightly armed, to large paramilitary units of division size or larger with ex- tensive support organizations (fig. 2). Large organizations normally include elements for combat, assassination and terrorism, intelligence and countarintelligence, civilian control, and supply. Guerrilla units are composed of various categories of personnel. Members may in- :; . clude- (1) Civilian volunteers and those impressed by coercion. (2) Military leaders and specialists. (8) Deserters. (4) In time of active war, military individuals or small groups such as those who have been cut off, deliberate stay-behinds, escaped prisoners of war, and downed airmen. .. 6. Irregular Force Activities and Tactics . ..,. . a. An irregular force presents an elusive target, since it will usually disperse before superior opposition, and then reform to strike again. However, as the guerrilla elements of an irregular force grow and approach parity with regular units in organization, equipment, train- ing, and leadership, their capabilities and tactics likewise change and become similar to those of a regular unit. (1) Overt irregular activities includ-acts of destruction against public and private property, transportation and communica- tions systems ;raids and ambushes against military and police headquarters, garrisons, convoys, patrols, and depots; ter- rorism by assassination, bombing, armed robbery, torture, mutilation, and kidnaping; provocation of incidents, 1.8-\n\n88.

(3) Overt and covert activities. 130th overt and covert activities are employed in active war or occupation situations to inten- tionally dram off enemy combat troops from commitment to their primary mission. 7. Political Factors a. Operations against irregular forces are sensitive politically, pnr- ticularly during cold wnr operations. The scopo and nature of mis- sions assigned and commnnders' decisions will emphasize political aspects to a greater extent than in normal militmy operations. 6. 'L'ho presence of a foroign military force operating ngninst ir- rogulitr forces will illviiriably bo exploited by hostile political propa- ganda. 8. Geographical Factors a. Tho vastness of an : L ~ Lover which such operations nlny hc con- ducted can result in 1:trgc nrcns which cannot be closoly controlled. When such :ireas i ~ r osparsely populated or when thoy contain un- friendly dements of the population, they become likely weas for the development of t~ hostile resista~lcemovement. 6. Areas of rugged or inaccessible terrain, such as mountiiiris, for- ests, jungles, and swamps, aro extremely difficult to control, and the guerrilla elements of an irregular force are most likely to flourish i n such areas. 9. Relationship of Forces a. Under the Geneva Convontions, as discussed in PM 27-10, \"The Law of Land Warfare,\" ,z guerrilla may, in time of war, have legal status; when he is captured, he is entitled to the same treatment :IS ,z regular prisoner of war if he-\n\n92.

CHAPTER 2 . CONCEPT AND CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS Section I. COMMAND AND CONTROL 10. Active War a. Tlio measures which U.S. military commanders may take against irregular forces during hostilities and in occupied enemy territory are limited to those which are authorized by the laws of land warfare (FM 27-1 0). 6 Army operations against irregular forces in a general or'limited . war will be conducted within the command structure establiddt for the particular theater. The senior headquarters conducting the opbra- tion may be joint, combined, or uniservice. If an established +m- munication zone exists, control of operations against an irregular fbrce in this area will normally be a responsibility of the Theater fin^ ' Logistical Command or the appropriate section headquarters. o. Continuity of commanders and staff officers and retention of the same units within an area are desirable to permit commanders, staffs, and troops to become thoroughly acquainted with the terrain, the local population, the irreylar force organization, and its techniques I of operations. 11. Cold War Situations a. I n liberated areas in which a friendly foreign government has been reestablished and in sovereign foreign countries in time of peace, the authority which U.S.military commanders may exercise against irregular forces is limited to that permitted by the prov@ons of agreements which are concluded with responsible authorities of the sovereign government concerned. 6 The chief of the U.S. . diplomatic mission in each country, as the representative of the President, is normally the channel of authority on foreign policy and the senior coordinator for the activities of all representatives of US. agencies and services in such n country. I n some instances, diplomatic representation may not be present, or the relationship between the diplomatic representative and the military commander may be further delineated by executive order ( i .3). fg\n\n94.

Section il. PLANNING 12. General a. Operations against irregular forces am designed to establish control within the resistance area, eliminate the irregular force, and assist in the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and reeducation required to provide a suitable atmosphere for peaceful living. These goals are sought concurrently, but in specific i n s h n m priorities may bo estab- lished. The specific actions required to attain each goal are often the same, and even when different, are usually planned and conducted concurrently. b. Operations against irregular forces nre planned nccording to these basic considerations, (1) The majority of operations consist of small unit actions. (2) Operations are primarily offensive in nature; once initiated, they are continued without halt to prevent irregular force reorganization and resupply. Lulls in irregular activities or failure to establish contact with hostile elements may reflect inadequate measures in the conduct of operations rather than complete success. (8) Operations are designed to minimize the irregular force's strengths and to exploit their weaknesses. ( a ) The greatest strength of an irregular force lies in its inner political structure and identification with a popular cause, its ability to conceal itself within tho civil population, tho strong motivation of its members, and their knowledge of the resistance area. ( 5 ) The greatest wmkness of an irreylar force lies in its de- pendence upon support by the civil population; its lack of a reliable supply system for food, arms, and ammunition ; and its lack of transportation, trained leadership, and com- munications. (4) The close relationship between the civil population and the irregular force may demand enforcement of stringent con- trol measures. I n some cases it may be necessary to relocate entire villages, or to move individuals from outlying areas into population centers. I t may be necessary to relocate those who cannot be protected from guerrilla attack, dnd those who are hostile and can evade control. c. Terrain and the dispositions and tactics of guerrilla forces usu:dly limit the effectiveness of artillery. However, the demoralizing effect of hrtillery fire on guerrillas often justifies its use even though there is little possibility of inflicting material damage. Ingenuity and u departure from conventional concepts often make artillery support possible under the most adverse circumstances.\n\n96. d.

Planning for oper:it.ions against irregular forces requires a de- and its population. Close rttten- t i l e d analysis of the area co~lcerncd tion is given to both the civil (political, economic, social) and the mili- tary situations.\n\n97. b. The following specific factors are considered in the commander's estimate : ( 1 ) 'l'he motivation and loyalties of various se-ments of the population, identification of hostile and friendly elements, vul~lerability friendly or potentially friendly elements to of coercion by terror tactics, and susceptibility to enemy and friendly propaganda. Particular attention is given to the following: ( a ) Farmers and other rural dwellers. ( b ) Criminal and tough elements. (c) Adherents t the political philosophy of the irregular force o or to similar philosophies. ( d ) Vormer members of armed forces. (e) Hxistence of strong personalities capable of organizing an irregular force and their activities. I (2) The existing policies and directives regarding legal status and i 1 treatment of civil population and irregular force members. (3) The terrain a d weather to include-- ( a ) Tlie suitability of terrain and road and trail net for both irregular force and friendly force operations. ( 6 ) Tlie location of all possible hideout areas for guerrillas. ( c ) Tlie location of possible drop zones and fields suitable for the operation of aircraft used in support of guerrilla units. (4) Tho resources available to the irregular force, including- ( a ) The capability of the area to furnish food. ( b ) 'l'he capability of friendly forces to control the hurvcst, storage, and distribution of food. (c) 'I'lie availability of water and fuels. (d) The availability of arms, ammunition, demolition mate- rials, and other supplies, (6) 1rregular force relations with any external sponsoring power, including- ( a ) Direction and coordination of irregular activities. ( b ) Communication with the irregular force. (c) Cupabilify to deliver organizers and supplies by air, sea, and land. (6) Tlie extent of irregular force activities and the force organ- ization to include- ( a ) Their origin and development. (b) Their strength and morale. ( c ) The personality of the leaders. (d) Relations with the civil population. (e) Effectiveness of organization and unity of command. ( f ) Status of eq~ipment d supplies. m (g) Status of training.\n\n99. (4) Harsh living conditions of guerrilla elementa (5) Scarcity of arms and supplies. (6) Selfish motivt~tionof opportunists and apparent supporters of the resistance movement. e. Tmop units of the TOE 33-series should be included ,in the friendly force structure on a selective basis. (See F M 33-5, Psycho- logicit1 Warfare Operations.) 15. Civic Action a. Civic action is any action performed by the military force utilizing military manpower and material resources in cooperation with civil nutlmrities, agencies, or groups, which is designed to secure tlie economic or social betterment of the civilian community. Civic action can be a major contributing factor to the development of favor- able public opinion and in accomplishing the defeat of the i m g d a r force. Military commanders are encouraged to participate in . l o ~ l civic action projects wherever such participation does not seriously detract from accomplishment of their primary mission. .(See ;EM 41-5, Joint Manual of Civil Affairs/Military Government, and F M 41-10, Civil Affairs/Military Government Operations.) 1. . 6 Civic action can include assistance to the local population as . construction or rehabilitation of transportation and communiaation means, schools, hospitals, and churches; assisting in agricultural im- provement programs, crop planting, harvesting, or processing; and furnishing emergency food, clothing, and medical aid as in periods of natural disaster. . 8 I 0. Civic action propams are often designed to employ the maximum number of civilians until suitable economy is establishedl The energies of civilians ahould be directed into constructive chonnell, and toward ends which support the purpose of the campaign. .Unemployed and discontented masses of people, lacking the bare necessities of life, are a constant hindrance and may preclude successful accomplishment of the mission. d. Civic action is an instrument for fostering active civilian opposi- tion to the irregular force and active participation in and support of operations. The proceases for achieving an awareness in civilian populations of their obligation to support stated aims should begin early. Commanders should clearly indicate that civil assistance by the military unit is not simply a gift but is also action calculated to enhance the civilians' ability to support the government. e. Civil affairs units of the TOE 41-series are employed to assist in the conduct of civic action projects and in the discharge of. civil responsibilities.\n\n100. Section IV. POLICE OPERATIONS 16.

Restrictive liwlsures :we limited to those which :rre nbsolutoly essential and can be enforced. Every effort is made to gain the willing cooperation of the locnl population to comply with controls and ro- strictions. However, established measures are enforced firmly and justly. Free movement of civilians is normally confined to their local communities. Exceptions should be made to permit securing food, attandance at public worship, and necessary travel in the event of illness. o. Punisliment of civilians, when authorized, must be used wit11 realistic discretion. If tho people becomo frustrated and :rlienated as a m u l t of unjust punishment, tho purpose is defeated. Care is hken to punish the true offender, sinco subvcrsivo acts arc often committed to provoke unjust retaliution :rgainst individuals or communities coopornting with friendly forcos. d .

Foot patrols are similar to normal polico ptrols, but are usul~llylarger. Motor patrols are ilsed to conservo troops and to afford speed in reacting to incidents. Aircraft are employed to maintain overall surveillnxlce and to move patrols rapidly. Improvised landing pads such as roofs of buildings, parks, vacant lots, and streets are used. A patrol is a shorn of forco and must always reflect high standards of precision and disciplined bearing. Its actions are rigidly controlled to preclude unfavorable incidents. f. Surveillance of persons and places is accomplished, both night and day, by using a combination of the techniques employed by mili- tary and civil police and counterintelligence agencies. The majority of surveillance activities are clandestine in nature and may require more trained agent personnel than are normally assigned or attslcllecl to army units. Surveillance operations must be highly coordinnted among all participating agencies. g. Facilitiea for screening civilian and interrogating suspeots ara established and maintained. The requirements are similar to those for handling refugees, line crossers, and prisoners of war. Organiza- tion is on a team basis and normally consists of military and civil police, interpreter/translators, POW interrogators, and CI - agents. Each team is capable of operating a t temporary locations on an area basis to support operations against civil disturbances and large scale search and seizure operations. 17. Roadblocks Roadbloclts are employed to control illegal possession and movc- ment of goods, to check the adequacy of other controls, and to appre- hend members of the irregular force. a. Roadblocks are designed to halt traffic for search or to phss traffic as desired. They are established as surprise checks because irregular forco members and their sympathizers soon devise ways of circuni- venting permanent checkpoints. 6 Teams are trained and rehearsed so as to be capable of establisll- . ing roadblocks in a matter of minutes at any hour. Local oEcit~ls may be called on for assistance, to include the use of official inter- preters, translators, interrogators, and local women to search wolnen and girls. c. Roadblocks are established a t locations which have suitable ttrCi1S for assembling people under p a r d and for parking vehicles. for search. Troops are concealed a t the block and along tho paths and roads leading to the block for the purpose of apprehending thosa attempting to avoid the block. d.

Block Control Illoclc control is the constnut survoillanco and reporting of personnel movements within u block or other small populated area by a resident of that block or : m a who has been appointed and is supervised by an nppropriat.c authority. Beciruse of the civil authority and lengthy time required to establisli a block control system, it is normally insti- tuted and controlled by civil npnciw. An established block control system should bo supported by the military force, and in turn, be ex- ploited for maximum benefit. a. Block control is established by dividing each blocli or like area into zones, each of which includes nil the buildings on one side of a street within a block, A resident zone lender is appointed for each zone, and s separate resident block leador is appointed for each block. Heads of housellolds and business- in each zone aro required to report\n\n103. 211 ~~?ovcinentspeople to the zone leader: to include arrivals and de- of I ):~rttlrcs tlicir on711fnrriilies or employees, neighbors. and st rangers. of % ~ I W c d e r s i ~ p o r i i I I ~rluvcmentsin their zoile to the block I c : d ~ r .

Installation and Community Security Critical military rind civil installations arid key communities must be secured against sabotage and guerrilla attack. a. Special attent,ioll is given to the security of food supplies, arms, ammunition, and otlier equipment of valuo to the irregular force. Maximum use is matie of ntitural and manmade obstacles, alarms, illumination, electronic surveillance devices, and restricted areas. Fields of fire are clet~retli t i d field fortifications are constructed for y a r d s and other locitl security forces. The local security system is supplemented by vigorous patrolling using varying schedules and routes. Patrolling tlistunce from the instnllution or communit,y is ~ t least that of light ~nort;lrrange.

The size, orgu~iizittio~i, equipment of locd security forces ilre iuicl dictated by their mission, the size, composition, and effectiveness of the hostile force, and the attitude of the civil population. Security detachments in reinote weas iiormally are larger than those close to supporting forces. P:rtrol requirements also influence the size of security detachments. lZemote cletachments maintain a supply level to meet the continge~ioyof isoltttion froin their base for long periods and should be independent of the local population for supply. 1h1- anced against the desirability for self-sufficient detachments is the certainty that well-stocked remote outposts will be considered as prime targets for guerrilla forces a s :c source of arms and iun~nuni-\n\n104. 21. Security of Surface Lines of Communication\n\n105. Armored vehicles, aircraft, and armored reilrond cars are used by patrols when appropriate. c. Lone vehicles, trains, and convoys which c;lnnot provide their own security are gmuped if practicable and arc escorted throogll danger areas by armed security detachments. All traffic is controlled and reported from station to station. 22. Apprehended Irregular Force Members a. Operations against irregular forces may generate sizable groups of prisoners which can create serious problems for both the military force and civil administration. Large numbers of confined personnel can generate further political, social, and economic difficulties. Tliere- fore, the evaluation and disposition of prisoners must contribute to the ultiniate objective. 6. When irregular form members defect or surrender voluntarily, they have indicated that their attitudes and beliefs have changed, at least in part, and that they will no longer participate in irregular activities. (1) Confinement should be temporary, only for screening and processing, and be separate from prisoners who have not ex- hibited a change in attitude. (2) Promises made to induce defection or surrender must be met. (8) Postrelease supervision is essential but need not be stringent. (4) Relocation may be required to prevent reprisal from former comrades. a When irregular force members are captured, they can be expected to retain the attxtude which prompted their participation in irreylar activities. (1) Confinement is required and may continue for an extended period. (2) Prisoners against whom specific crimes can be charged should be brought ta justice immediately. Charge3 of crimes against persons, such as murder, should be made, if possible, rather than charges of crimes directly affiliated with the resistance movement which may result in martyrdom and serve as a rallying point for increased irregular activity. (8) Prisoners charged only with being a member of the irregular force will require intensive reeducation and reorientation while confined. In time, consistent with security, those who have demonstrated a willingness to cooperah may be con- sidered for release under parole. Relocation away from pre- vious comrades may be necessary and provision of a means for earning a living must be considered. (4) Families of prisoners may have no means of support and a program should be initiated to care for them, educate them"
