        "text": "December 8, 2014\n\nThe Lone Gladio is unlike any 'spy' novel I have read. Sibel Edmonds has proven herself to be a very talented writer and publisher, several fold.\n\nAfter introducing key characters, the author takes us on a whirlwind of events from DC to Cambodia [with significant links to other key countries] unfolded with impeccable detail.\n\nI am not unfamiliar with the issues addressed, any pieces I ever wondered about now fit together neatly. The unveiling of NATO as the root of massive death and destruction is very clever.\n\nThen, the thought of any member of congress engaging in sexual activity with children is beyond deplorable, yet it's been ongoing, including the pentagon.\n\nWhile these are huge issues, “The Lone Gladio” avails so much more. It's a story with in a story with it's own brand of charm. Some moments were tender, witty and some, quite comical. There are absolutely brilliant moments with Elsie and Greg as they execute a perfectly designed plan.\n\nI appreciated the brutal honesty as to how certain information was obtained, and Elsie's abhorrence to brutality and murder. Even so, she was in good hands, by the one person who could keep her safe.\n\nOne of my favorite moments took place in in NYC. It's absolutely brilliant. Elsie thought so too.\n\nI was captivated from the first page to the last... and was especially taken with the end. But then, kids and pets are my soft spot.\n\nI finished reading “The Lone Gladio” feeling a genuine warmth. That has never happened with any other spy/thriller book I have read, especially where heinous crimes I despise the most have taken place.\n\nThe author provided us a look into “Operation Gladio” and how their role can be linked to some of the most devastating Global incidents, including our own, September 11th, 2001, which Ms. Edmonds wrote about in her first book, “Classified Woman.”\n\nIt would behoove any self respecting American to be armed with facts, and prepared for the future.\n\nNovember 24, 2016\n\nMy rating is 4.5. The writing style was good and the story structure was interesting, maybe jarring, (wondered why). Overall, an intense read; especially knowing that the author had to write this story as fiction because she was a silenced FBI Translator Whistle-blower. Scary stuff here.\n\nApril 20, 2015\n\nThis is the true skins on the for real deal, as we used to say in my youth. Sibel is the most gagged woman in the US, so she has slipped around the censorship by writing what she knows as a novel. And a very compelling read it is too without being in anyway the conventional spy thriller.\n\nIt contains full and horrifying details of the torture the CIA operatives are trained to carry out, it sets out how the CIA monitor and vet information, including information for release to the media. It gives us a view into what really happened on 9/11.\n\nSibel worked for the FBI as a translator of Middle Eastern languages. She had a very high clearance rating and was so appalled at what she learned, it resulted in numerous gagging orders when she protested. She says its even scarier that they've allowed her to publish this book - meaning, they no longer care what we know. They'll simply deny it and carry on anyway. How can we stop them? She posits a lone Gladio (taken from the name of the short Roman sword) who takes revenge, and meanwhile reveals to the reader much of what has been going on in the Land of the Free Home of the Brave.\n\nThis is an amazing book and Edmonds has been extremely courageous in publishing it. Many wouldn't, many don't. Thank you, Sibel.\n\nBy the way, did you know that Obama has been in the CIA since he was a young man and his mother worked for them?\n\nIf you want the background to what is now called Gladio B, read Daniele Manser's NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe\n\nJanuary 1, 2015\n\nI got this book through a first reads giveaway.\n\nI just wasn't feeling it. The first part of the novel was hard to follow without any real point I felt, and by the time I got into the second part, I just didn't care about any of the characters or what they were trying to solve. I actually couldn't finish it. I normally give books 100 pages to keep me entertained, and this one just didn't do it for me.\n\nNovember 24, 2014\n\nIf I don't win this, I will have to ask it for Christmas. I have read several excellent reviews about the book & the subject matter. Looking forward to a great read.\n\nFebruary 9, 2015\n\n4.5/5 Looking forward to more from Ms. Edmonds!\n\nJuly 9, 2015\n\nI really wanted to like this, as I have no doubt that the sorts of stuff that happens in here is what intelligence agencies are really up to.\n\nBut gaaaaaawd, the writing is AWFUL.\n\nDecember 14, 2017\n\nThought provoking\n\nGreat story. Terrible if it’s based on truth which it purports to be. I read it on my Kindle, but now want to order hard copy. So many facts and events I want to revisit. Many others have described the story; no need for me to do that. The book makes me sure that my distrust of governments in general was not just a gut feeling. It is written like an entertaining novel.\n\nOctober 20, 2019\n\nVery good fiction novel especially considering her as a novice writer and her first and I hope not the last novel. Anyone interested in political thrillers must read this book.\n\nFebruary 8, 2021\n\nBoring, absolutely boring. Couldn't even get to page 50. Don't bother with this book. It is just not even worth the price.\n\nJanuary 16, 2015\n\nAnother thrilling and well-written book from FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds, this time taking a stab at the fiction (semi-fiction?) genre.\n\nIt's a captivating look at the Deep State politics from the perspective of one who used to work on that side of things. There are more than a few kernels (boulders?) of truth in this fiction novel of a former CIA deep cover agent gone rogue and settling a few scores of his own while managing to disrupt terrorist plots set up by other CIA deep state players.\n\nEarly on in the book we read about a very high level U.S. Congressman who gets caught in the middle of a child sex ring. With the current news about Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton, amongst others, being linked to a convicted billionaire pedophile and with allegations from an alleged former sex slave of his, one has to wonder if there is more truth to this fictional scenario than most will ever know.\n\nThe whole book carries on like that and those who have read Sibel's first book, a non-fiction account of her tale as a whistleblower, will recognize more than a few true to life events that were expertly woven into this story.\n\nIf you read it with that in mind, that there are more elements of truth in this story than most will ever know, then you might ultimately come to the conclusion than when it comes to the government and the levels of depravity they can stoop to, truth can indeed be stranger than fiction.\n\nJanuary 1, 2015\n\nAn engaging, quick thriller. Given Edmonds' background, one wonders how much of her novel was written by her real-world experience with the Deep State? Not unlike Keys to the Kingdom, you're left to ponder the question \"Are some truths told only through fiction?\" Even if you knew nothing else about Sibel Edmonds, The Lone Gladio is a fine action novel waiting for a film treatment.\n\nDecember 14, 2014\n\nStarts slowly, very disjointed. It has a certain style that's Hard to follow. But eventually it starts to make sense, then moves right along. Most characters are completely undeveloped, and it's Almost too clean -- nothing ever goes wrong for the lead character, despite the crazy complicated nature of the goings-on. But I enjoyed it eventually. Would read more stories about the same operatives.\n\nMay 3, 2015\n\nQuite enjoyable as a political thriller. I suggest first reading the author's \"Classified Woman\", a memoir which establishes her credibility in having first-hand knowledge of the corruption in our National Security State at all levels. One can only wonder how much of this fictional work is, in fact, grounded in the realities that she could only hint at in the earlier outstanding piece of non-fiction.\n\nOctober 24, 2015\n\nI was riveted and fascinated by this book! It was an absolute page turner for me. I admire Ms. Edmonds courage in writing about such scary matters that happen within our government. I highly recommend reading her first book \"Classifed Woman,\" first, before reading \"the Lone Gladio.\" It allowed to me understand and get everything at a much deeper level. Both are definite must reads!\n\nSeptember 4, 2015\n\nIt is absolutely great! One would not expect whistleblower to make the novel of such a high literature quality. No doubt major messages are in the factual part of the work which is surely very disturbing. But the fact the reader get a chance to digest it so easily and with such an interest makes it even more appealing.\n\nOctober 31, 2015\n\nExcellent Spy Novel\n\nEdmonds has written a first class spy novel, filled with twists, turns and international intrigue. He well drawn out characters and mastery of detail show that she really knows her stuff. If you like Ludlum, Le Carre, etc you are going to want to read The Lone Gladio!\n\nAugust 28, 2019\n\nVery cinematic and an interesting analytical approach to writing, but a little fractured and clumsy - it was thought provoking about the state of our government and its involvement with terror organizations.\n\nOctober 4, 2016\n\nA gripping novel that portrays the behind the scene workings of terrorism, agency spying on Congress, sexual perversions of those in power - what's really going in government. Written by someone who's been there and has firsthand knowledge of it all.\n\nOctober 17, 2020\n\nFictional story about clandestine operations in Eurasia sponsored by NATO. It can get quite cartoonish at times and the propaganda gets a little heavy handed, but it’s not the worst thing you’ll end up reading.\n\nJanuary 11, 2015\n\nI'd give this 3.5 stars. fun read, good characters. thought the writing was lackluster in places\n\nDecember 13, 2016\n\nEdmonds is a fabulous writer and journalist; an amazingly interesting read."
