        "text": "Faced with a huge growth of working class power, with strikes, occupations, self-reduction of prices and mass squatting the intelligence services began carrying out terrorist acts with the help of fascist groups. Anarchists and the left were blamed, and working class militants were arrested. The worst such attack was the worst terrorist attack in Europe in the 20th Century - the bombing of the Bologna train station which killed 85 people (see picture, above)\n\n\"[S]ome fascists in the group of terrorists\n\nin question worked for the Carbinieri (the Italian military police) , that\n\nothers had contact with the army or the police and that they received valuable\n\nand timely information in the progress of investigation into their activities\"(1)\n\n- From the report of an Italian parliamentary committee of inquiry.\n\n\"The workers struggles of 1968-69, Italy's Hot Autumn,\n\ndeeply engraved the economic structure of the country and modified the balance\n\nof forces. After these struggles, the Left was stronger and power weaker.\n\n. . .objectively. The damage provoked by the workers insubordination was very\n\nserious indeed\"\n\n\"Even before '69 many militant and autonomous struggles\n\ndeveloped, in particular Pirelli in Milan, neither controlled by the Unions\n\nat the level of organization nor dominated by them at the level of the content\n\nof the demands. Tangible wage increases, plus less work were the two main\n\nthemes of that period. The behaviour of the proletariat can be summed up in\n\nthe slogan of the period: Better wages, shorter hours!.\n\n“Violent strikes broke out in Alfa Romeo and in\n\nFiat. Rioting took place in many towns, the most serious in Reggio Calabria\n\nwhere tens of thousands of people fought against the troops\" (2)\n\n\"[R]ight-wing political violence most strongly manifested\n\nitself in the late 1960s and early 1970s . This was a period of student and\n\nyouth agitation, new social movements including women's and gay liberation,\n\nwidespread social unrest and trade union militancy in Italy . This was accompanied\n\nby a massive increase in electoral support for the Communists - peaking at\n\nover a third of the vote in the 1976 elections. The neo-Fascist terrorists\n\ngroups of this period were a backlash against all this left wing activity\n\nand also against the emergence of left wing terrorist groups such as the Red\n\nBrigades. Terrorists of the right .... often planted bombs in public places\n\nwhich killed dozens of innocent bystanders and passers-by . All this was part\n\nof a so-called 'strategy of tension’, a campaign designed to lead to\n\na breakdown of law and order and consequent collapse of public confidence\n\nin democratically elected government, precipitating a takeover by the army.\n\nIndeed in the 1960s and 1970s there were several coup attempts.\" (3)\n\nOn December the 12th 1969 the bombing began, with one\n\nbomb in Milan and three in Rome. The bombs in Rome left eighteen wounded,\n\nthe bomb in Milan killed seventeen and injured eighty-eight. Police acting\n\non information from S.I.D. (intelligence agency) arrested two anarchists for\n\nthe Milan bomb, later murdering one of them, Giuseppe Pinelli, by throwing\n\nhim out of a police station window and claiming suicide - an act made famous by Dario Fo's play Accidental Death of an Anarchist. Despite mounting\n\nevidence that this was a fascist bomb, the official party line for years afterward\n\nwas blame the anarchists. Later the Establishment view changed and the idea\n\nthat this was a joint operation between anarchists and fascists is propounded!\n\nEventually a number of fascists are tried, convicted and imprisoned but others\n\nare acquitted, as is the surviving anarchist. One of the bombers acquitted\n\nfor \"lack of evidence\" was Guido Giannette an S.I.D. agent. When\n\nGiannette became a suspect, the secret state sent him out of Italy and continued\n\nto pay his wages after the arrest warrant had been issued.\n\nIn twelve years from 1969 to 1980 4,298 terrorist incidents\n\ntook place. Of these fascists were responsible for 68%, as well as most of\n\nthe deaths. The basic pattern repeated again and again is as described above,\n\nthe left is blamed, there is a high degree of collusion and those responsible\n\nusually get off scot free and with a hell of a lot less international political\n\nand media attention than the famous Red Brigades.\n\nIn September 1974 the head of S.I.D.(secret service) Vito\n\nMicelli was implicated in an attempted fascist coup d'etat in 1970 - after\n\na secret report from his own agency reached the Prime Minister's desk. He\n\nthen nailed his colours to the mast and stood and won as a M.S.I. (fascist)\n\nparliamentary candidate. All this time the covert neo-fascist army, Gladio which was set up in the wake of World War 2, was also lurking in the background.\n\nBy 1977 S.I.D. was so embroiled in scandal that it was\n\nreplaced by a 'new' secret service - S.I.S.M.I. . Then came what was at the\n\ntime the worst single terrorist atrocity in European history. On the 2nd of\n\nAugust 1980 a bomb exploded in the second class waiting room of Bologna railway\n\nstation. Eighty-five people were killed and over two hundred wounded, Bologna\n\nwas a Communist Party electoral stronghold with a powerful workers’\n\nmovement and had been targeted previously. Ten years later a number of S.I.S.M.I.\n\nofficers were on trial for this atrocity, they included a General Secretary,\n\na General and a Colonel. Their convictions were later quashed. As we have\n\nseen these were by no means the only incidents of far-right terror and state\n\ncollusion with it in Italy at that time, for example repeatedly the secret\n\nservices created false trails of evidence leading away from the perpetrators\n\nof rightist violence. One might wonder what motivated it and indeed what motivated\n\nthe virtually indiscriminate terror itself, the whole story would have remained\n\nin the realms of conjecture and could be dismissed as speculation but for\n\nchance.\n\nDuring investigations into a banking scandal police searched\n\nthe home of Licio Gelli. Gelli had fought for Mussolini's reborn Roman Empire\n\nin Spain, Yugoslavia and Albania and when Italian fascism crumbled he joined\n\nthe Nazi S.S.. After the war Gelli worked on the 'Ratlines' - the Vatican\n\nand C.I.A. sponsored escape routes for Nazi fugitives. Later he dealt arms\n\nin Latin America and reputedly became the linkman between the C.I.A. and Juan\n\nPeron the Argentine dictator. Searching his home, the police came across a\n\nlist of over six hundred names and evidence linking them to a Freemason group\n\ncalled Propaganda-2 or P-2. Now freemasonry or any other oath-bound secret\n\nsociety is illegal in Catholic Italy, but of course totally unremarkable this\n\nwould be but for the membership of P-2.\n\nP-2 recruited from the \"elite\" of Italian society.\n\nIt included within its ranks one hundred and ninety five military officers,\n\ntwo serving Ministers, three ex-Ministers, one Party Secretary, sixteen Magistrates,\n\nfour hundred and twenty two State officials, thirty six M.P.s as well as Secret\n\nService heads and various bankers and capitalists (4). Magistrates investigating\n\nthe Bologna bombing found that P-2 directed much of the fascist violence and\n\nassociated cover-ups and distortion. Gelli was P-2's 'venerable master' (that's\n\nleader to us mere mortals) and in 1986 he stood trial for his part in the\n\n1980 Bologna bombing and was acquitted but found guilty of perjury. On the\n\nfourth of August 1974 a train bombing near Bologna killed twelve and injured\n\nforty-eight. A 1983 trial judgement on this atrocity found:\n\n\"In the opinion of the parties claiming damages,\n\nthe accused members of 'Ordine Nuovo' (New Order) were inspired, armed and\n\nfinanced to carry out the attack by the Masonic movement, which took advantage\n\nof right-wing subversives and terrorists, within the context of the so-called\n\n'strategy of tension' in an attempt to halt the country's gradual drift to\n\nthe left and set up the basis for a future coup d'etat\" (5)\n\nThis was the P-2's plan, by means of terror in the style\n\nof agent provocateur promote a law and order agenda and provide a pretext\n\nfor a clampdown on dissent and worker's struggle, if necessary a coup d'etat\n\nwould be part of this. However given that P- 2 constituted a 'State within\n\nthe State', a coup would be the option of last resort and would happen if\n\nfor instance the Communist party entered a coalition government. Such a coup\n\nwould have undoubtedly involved Gladio,\n\nanother organisation in the murky shadows of Italy's secret state sharing\n\nthe same ends and means as P-2.\n\nThe Italian state’s Strategy of Tension shows how\n\nthe elites who govern us and profit from our labour will stop at absolutely\n\nnothing to maintain their power and wealth, even resorting to terrorism against\n\ntheir own populations in a “democratic” Western state. Any people\n\nwanting a better world today should take note, and be prepared.\n\nPostscript\n\nIn March 2001 General Maletti, commander of the counter-intelligence\n\nsection of Italy's military intelligence, claimed at a trial of various fascists\n\nfor one of the 1969 bombings, that \"The C.I.A., following the directives\n\nof its government, wanted to create an Italian nationalism capable of halting\n\nwhat it saw as a slide to the left and, for this purpose it may have made\n\nuse of rightwing terrorism. I believe this is what happened in other countries\n\nas well.\" (Quoted in the Guardian of March 26th 2001)"
