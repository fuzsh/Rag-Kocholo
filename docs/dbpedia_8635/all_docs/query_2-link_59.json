        "text": "Ahead of the opening of Expo 2017 Astana, the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) asks Severi Keinälä, the National Commissioner of the Pavilion of Finland, about the country’s participation.\n\nWhy did Finland choose “Sharing Pure Energy\" as the theme for its participation at Expo 2017 Astana?\n\nS. Keinälä: We are proudly presenting Finnish energy efficiency know-how including energy production and distribution, not forgetting other cleantech expertise fostering sustainable growth. In addition to energy and cleantech, the Finnish Pavilion presents water technologies, education, logistics and agro-business through our world famous Finnish design.\n\nHow is Finland working towards its long-term goal of a carbon-neutral society?\n\nS. Keinälä: Finland’s long-term objective is to become a carbon-neutral society (using only energy produced from renewable sources). Our concrete target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–95 percent from the levels of 1990 by the year 2050.\n\nThe current government programme includes the following objectives:\n\nThe share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption will rise to more than 50 per cent during the 2020s\n\nFinland's self-sufficiency in energy will be increased to more than 55 %\n\nCoal will no longer be used in energy production\n\nSome concrete examples of what we are doing:\n\nImproved energy efficiency of the transport system\n\nVehicle stock renewal: focusing on electric and gas fuelled cars\n\nInvestment subsidies for renewable energy are mainly targeted towards commercialising new technology\n\nRe-use of waste to produce energy\n\nUsing coal for energy production will be discontinued during the 2020s: legislation is under way\n\nWhat “cleantech” expertise can Finland share at Expo 2017 Astana?\n\nS. Keinälä: Finland is the world’s greenest country (EPI 2016). The expertise in environmental issues is reflected in the Finnish cleantech innovations and world-class companies. Finland is also a forerunner in renewable energy technology. Almost 40% of Finnish energy is produced using sustainable methods, and our expertise in smart electricity distribution grids keeps everyone’s power supply covered.\n\nFinland will share “cleantech” expertise especially in Smart city know-how, from waste to energy and clean water expertise. The Finnish innovation system yields water and environmental innovations cross-fertilized with the strong ICT sector."
