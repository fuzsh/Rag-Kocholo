        "text": "The tradition of a newly elected Finnish president making their first State Visit to Sweden reflects the special relationship that exists between Sweden and Finland. The State Visit underlines the two countries’ close ties and affinity.\n\nThe aim of the Visit is to continue to develop and deepen the very close cooperation in all areas of society, and particularly as regards foreign, security and defence policy. The new security situation in our neighbourhood makes this relationship even more important. The Visit also aims to promote even closer cooperation between the Swedish and Finnish business sectors to boost trade and investments and jointly strengthen global competitiveness. Student and research exchanges and cultural issues are other areas that will be addressed during the Visit.\n\nThis will be the seventh incoming State Visit from Finland since The King ascended to the throne. The most recent was in 2022, when then President Niinistö visited Sweden. The King has made five outgoing State Visits to Finland. The most recent was in 2015.\n\nThe Visit will last for two days and take place in Stockholm and Gothenburg.\n\nA more detailed programme will be published in connection with the Visit.\n\nTo editorial offices\n\nMedia representatives need special accreditation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to cover the State Visit. The last day to apply for accreditation was Friday 12 April 2024.\n\nMedia representatives from Finland should apply for accreditation via the Office of the President in Helsinki."
