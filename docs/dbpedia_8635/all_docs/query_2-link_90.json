        "text": "3. PROCESS AND PROCEEDINGS: OVERVIEW\n\n3.1. Criminal Procedure\n\nThe criminal procedure has four stages: pre-trial investigation, consideration of charges, court hearing and enforcement of penalties.\n\nChart 05. Criminal Procedure Stages\n\nA criminal investigation starts with a police report that may be made by the concerned party, or if the police suspects a crime has been committed, the police or authorities responsible for criminal investigation will conduct a criminal investigation. The criminal investigation is led by the police and the prosecutor. Upon completion of the criminal investigation, the criminal investigation report and supporting documents are submitted to the prosecutor. This is called the pre-trial investigation.\n\nAfter the pre-trial investigation is completed and a prosecutor receives a record of the pre-trial investigation from the police, the prosecutor decides the further course of action that could result in either taking the matter to court, bringing charges or taking the decision to waive charges issued. In the case of petty crimes, charges may not be pressed. Nonetheless, in cases where the victim wants to bring charges, she or he can do so. This stage is called the consideration of charges.\n\nOnce the charges are brought to court, the defendant is notified of the charges brought against him, a summons is delivered and the defendant is provided with an opportunity to respond to it. In most cases, the summons also instructs the defendant to appear in court in person but it may also request that the defendant responds to the charges in writing before the trial commences.\n\nThe hearing starts with the framing of charges brought against the defendant by the prosecutor and the setting out of the victim’s claims in the matter. If the plaintiff so wishes, he can make a personal claim for compensation. It is then the defendant’s turn to be heard, and he can either admit or deny charges and must respond to any claim for compensation and present his views. Subsequent to the framing of charges and the response, evidence will be presented in writing and witnesses will be heard and examined.\n\nAfter that, closing arguments of both parties will be heard and the court will make a ruling at the hearing. If the defendant, the prosecutor or the plaintiff is dissatisfied with the District Court’s decision, he or she can appeal to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe appeal must be submitted within 30 days. However, a notice of intent to appeal must be filed first within seven days, with the District Court that made the decision.\n\nChart 06. Criminal Procedure Stages\n\nIn cases where, during the preliminary investigation, a request for detention of the accused is made, a court of law has to make the decision on detainment during the pre-trial period. A request for detention is considered specifically in cases where it is suspected that the accused may flee, avoid the trial, hinder the criminal procedure and disrupt the investigation, damage evidence, and/or influence witnesses or the plaintiff, or continue with the criminal activity.\n\nEqually a person can be detained if he or she is not a permanent resident of Finland or refuses to provide his or her name and refuses to state his name or address or gives false information concerning his identity, and if the identity is unknown and there is a reasonable suspicion that he/she may attempt to avoid the preliminary investigation or leave the country. In the above circumstances, a suspect can be detained without probable cause and if it is deemed important to detain the suspect for further investigation. Over and above the aforementioned conditions, the crime punishment must be no less than two years of imprisonment.\n\nThe criminal prosecution proceedings are provided in the chart below:\n\nChart 07. Criminal Prosecution Proceedings\n\n3.2. Civil Procedure\n\nChart 08. Civil Procedure Stages\n\nThe Code of Judicial Procedure is the main statute that governs civil proceedings. The civil procedure can be divided into two distinct stages: the preparatory stage and the main hearing. In the preparatory stage, parties submit a number of documents along with filing of the case.\n\nChart 09. Preparatory stage\n\nSubsequent to the preparatory stage, arguments are heard, written evidence is presented in court and witnesses are cross-examined. The hearing can take from one to several days. There can be an application for summary procedure if the matter is uncontested, but, if the defendant contests, the same proceedings are held as per the above procedure.\n\nThe limitation period for initiating proceedings in civil cases is three years. In certain cases, the limitation period may be interrupted by notice.\n\n3.3. Alternative Dispute Resolution\n\nAn out-of-court settlement is not compulsory in Finland, but it is possible in the majority of cases, such as business disputes, disputes between employers and employees, disputes between consumers and businesses, and disputes relating to landlords and tenants. Mediation is provided in civil and criminal matters in Finland. For sake of clarity, mediation in criminal cases will be referred to as Victim-offender Mediation (VOM).\n\nUnder Chapter 5 Section 26 of the Code of Procedure, it is stated that in civil cases, courts must establish whether the matter can be resolved amicably. In civil cases, mediation can be initiated when at least one of the parties involved is a natural person, and the disputed amount is minor.\n\nMediation should not be applied in cases of sexual offenses or cases of intimate partner violence with a prior history of violence or mediation. The police have also been instructed to prioritise complainants’ interests and apply careful consideration when assessing the suitability of more sensitive cases for mediation. In practice, mediation is more commonly suggested to younger age groups, and less directed to criminal cases where parties involved have a prominent criminal history. Currently, the most topical issue regarding victim offender mediation (VOM) regards the application of mediation to cases of intimate partner violence. The current discussion regards whether the regulations for this need to be further developed.\n\nVictim-offender mediation (VOM) in Finland is available for parties involved in and affected by crime and is a commonly used method of alternative conflict resolution. Essential to the practice of VOM is the theory of restorative justice, which lays the groundwork for its implementation. Initiated during the 1980s, the scheme allows the victim to be heard, the offender to make amends and their social relations to the community be maintained. In criminal matters, VOM is provided in municipalities and in cases of mediation the victim meets the accused or person suspected of the crime through a mediator. A settlement agreement for compensation may also be agreed upon. Mediation is not compulsory but voluntary and it may be suggested by the parties, the police, the prosecutor, or the social welfare services.\n\nCurrently, the Finnish institute of health and welfare (Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos/ institutet för hälsa och välfärd) serves as the provider of VOM services, while the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Sosiaali- ja terveysalan lupa- ja valvontavirasto / Tillstånds- och tillsynsverket för social- och hälsovården) supervises its implementation. The process and outcome of VOM operates through three laws; firstly, the legislation covering VOM as well as certain dispute cases which is the Act on Mediation in Criminal and Certain Civil Cases. The impact of VOM on the judicial outcomes of the criminal justice system rely on the Pre-Investigation Act and the Criminal Procedure Act.\n\nMediation in civil and criminal cases can be initiated by the parties themselves or be suggested by officials such as social workers, prosecutors and the police. Mediation can only be suggested to parties who personally and voluntarily consent to participation and understand its purpose. Additionally, the aims and means of mediation need to be deemed appropriate for the case and the party’s interests when assessing its suitability.\n\nChart 10. Mediation in Criminal and Civil Cases\n\nVOM can be initiated only when parties involved personally consent to participate and understand the function of mediation.\n\nAccording to the Act on Mediation in Criminal and Certain Civil Cases (section 3), VOM requires that the person accused of a crime confirms the general, factual occurrences of the event and that mediation is in the interest of the victim.\n\nIn a legal sense, the wording is weaker compared to “admitting” to a crime, since confessing to having committed a crime could he used as evidence in court, while confirming the general occurrence of events cannot be used as evidence of admitting the crime.\n\nDespite the restrictions, VOM is an option available in criminal cases regardless of ongoing court proceedings. In other words, VOM can be attempted in instances where a criminal investigation has concluded or even in cases where a verdict has been delivered by court. If a mediated criminal case proceeds to court hearings, the parties involved cannot refer to information disclosed during the mediation without consent of all the parties involved.\n\nThus, VOM can (if consent to disclosure has been given) influence the judicial verdict of the police, prosecutor and court. A successful mediation or a mediation attempt can serve as a ground for concluding the criminal case before it reaches court hearings. Regarding the influence of mediation, all authorities base their decisions on the aforementioned laws and official instructions.\n\n3.3.1. Stages of VOM\n\nSubsequent to filing of a criminal complaint and if there is a viable reason to suspect that a crime has occurred, the police must deliver a pre-trial investigation and inform the parties involved of any support service that may be of use to them. Offences where the prosecution rests on the injured party or complainant offenses, can only proceed to prosecution if the injured party demands punishment. Cases subject to public prosecution can be subject to investigation and prosecution even if the injured party does not demand punishment. A mediated criminal case can influence the verdict of the police in several ways, for instance, the pre-trial investigation is discontinued if the injured party revokes their demand for punishment following a successful mediation.\n\nThe impact of VOM on the criminal procedures and outcomes are presented in the chart below:\n\nChart 11. The crime process of victim-offender mediation\n\nThe oval boxes indicate the impacts of mediation on the criminal procedures and judicial outcomes.\n\nSource: Aino Jauhiainen.\n\nThe prosecutor can only consider prosecution of complainant offenses if the injured party demands punishment. Regarding non-complainant offenses, the prosecutor has the right to raise charges regardless of the injured party’s demands for punishment. A successful mediation can serve as a ground for non-prosecution. A mediation agreement or attempt at mediation, as well as other actions taken by the suspect to amend the consequences of their crime can justify non-prosecution on grounds of reasonability.\n\nIf a criminal case sent to mediation proceeds to court, a mediated case can affect the outcome of the penalty. The court may decide to waive penal measures, on grounds of insignificance, young age and reasonability. Furthermore, a successful mediation serves as a ground for mitigation of the penalty.\n\nThe verdicts and grounds for non-prosecution are further outlined in the following model:\n\nChart 12. Impact of Mediation\n\nArbitration is an alternative dispute resolution method to litigation in state courts. Any dispute in a civil or commercial matter which can be settled by agreement between the parties may be referred for final decision to be made by one or more arbitrators.\n\nThe Arbitration Institute of Finland offers Arbitration, and also mediation regarding civil or commercial disputes, seemingly tending to move from mediation, and then arbitration if it does not work out.[1]\n\n3.4. Simplification of law and by-passing legal processes\n\nIn civil cases that are undisputed, specifically cases concerning unpaid rents, consumer credit, and phone and electricity bills, a district court can apply a summary procedure. Mediation and processes relating to mediation especially in civil cases follow a simplified procedure and significantly reduce legal costs. This includes criminal cases where mediation is permitted, thus influencing the verdict and the nature of penalty imposed by the court.\n\n[1] For more see, https://arbitration.fi/arbitration/\n\n5. LEGAL AID SYSTEM[1]\n\nIn Finland, legal aid is governed by the Legal Aid Act and State Legal Aid Offices Act. It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice to administer legal aid, and the respective state legal aid offices make legal aid grant decisions. Legal aid is provided in civil and criminal matters.\n\nAt present there are about 220 public legal aid attorneys. Public Legal Aid Attorneys (PLAA) provide assistance throughout a case, from legal counseling to attending court. Legal aid services can be provided by both public and private lawyers. Private lawyers are employed in court cases where there is scarcity of lawyers, lack of capacity, inability to provide the service, when the legal service has to be provided in a particular language or if there is a conflict of interest. The Public Legal Aid (PLA) office needs to approve legal aid decision and grant permission to employ a private lawyer; subsequent to such approval, the state compensates the private lawyers for the legal aid provided.\n\nCurrently, Finland has PLA throughout the country that provide legal aid. The lawyers in the PLA function independently and can use their discretion as per the law. A handbook of interpretation of the legislation governing them is available for referral and guidance. Nonetheless, in case of denial of legal aid, a reconsideration or review of the decision can be submitted by the applicant to court. The process of reconsideration is different from the administrative appeal processes.\n\nLegal aid covers legal counselling, drafting documents or terms of agreements, court attendance and out-of-court proceedings. Typically, legal aid is provided at the expense of the state. In Finland, legal aid in civil matters is provided partially or fully based on a person’s financial means and/or whether their legal expenses could be covered by insurance. On the other hand, in criminal proceedings and in matters of violent crime, a public defender is provided, and legal assistance is given irrespective of the financial status of the defender or victim. Currently, public and private legal aid providers are governed by the same law, and it is the responsibility of the state legal aid offices to make decisions related to granting legal aid. Much of the legal aid work is led by public legal aid attorneys working in Public Legal Aid offices (PLA).\n\nIn certain cases, legal aid may be given for cases abroad, like general legal advice. In certain cases, the Ministry of Justice may grant comprehensive legal aid in matters relating to child abduction, criminal cases where a person residing in Finland has become the victim of a sex offence abroad. As per the EU Member States, legal directive 2002/8/EC of 27 January 2003[2] the goal is to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes. The objective is to establish minimum common rules for the availability of legal aid in disputes between the Member States. As per the Directive, PLAs can submit legal aid applications to the competent authority of another Member State. Under the Directive, Helsinki Legal Aid Office accepts legal aid applications from abroad.\n\nOver and above the legal directive, the European Agreement on the Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid is also applicable.\n\n5.1. History of legal aid\n\nThe origins of the Finnish legal aid scheme go back to the 1950s. The 1950s saw the legal aid enactment that ensured citizens had state-funded legal representation in courts, carried out by private lawyers. In the 1970s, Finland witnessed further reform whereby the municipal legal aid law came into effect that established communal legal aid offices and provided free legal aid. The new legal reform ensured a mixed-model system where private and publicly employed lawyers provided legal aid services, thus ensuring that free legal aid was available via legal aid offices across the country. The 1980s reform further widened the scope of legal aid to cover out-of-court civil cases related to divorce and child custody issues and preliminary investigations in criminal cases.\n\nIn the 1990s, responsibility for Public Legal Aid Offices (PLA) was transferred from the municipalities to the Finnish state. It was then that client’s financial capacity to pay, i.e. means testing, was introduced. By 2002, another alteration in legal aid law meant that availability of legal aid was restricted to poor and middle-income clients. Yet, the reforms meant that the number of those eligible for legal aid increased, since the financial eligibility limits increased in 2009.\n\n5.2. Legislative framework for legal aid\n\nThe public legal aid system is funded by the Ministry of Justice. The respective laws governing legal aid in Finland are:\n\nLegal Aid Act\n\nAct on Public Legal Aid Offices\n\nGovernment Decree on Legal Aid\n\nGovernment Decree on Legal Aid Fee Criteria\n\nMinistry of Justice Decree on Public Legal Aid Offices\n\nMinistry of Justice Decree on the Locations of Public Legal Aid Offices and their Branch Offices\n\nThis includes all the subsequent amendments connected to the Acts and decrees.\n\n5.3. Institutional framework for legal aid\n\nThe Public Legal Aid Offices function administratively under the six legal aid and public guardianship districts. The districts are led by the Directors of Legal Aid. The PLAs are headed by leading Public Legal Aid Attorneys. The administrative units that function under each district are in charge of budget plans, recruitment, invoicing, and other administrative matters.\n\nThe services and the address of the PLAs are available online in Finnish, Swedish and English. The PLAs are in different municipalities. Legal aid for those without means is free, while others are charged or there is a co-pay element involved. At present, there is an initial legal aid charge of € 70 that is exempted if the person is not liable to pay based on means testing.\n\nAs far as calculating the deductible amount of legal aid is concerned, two elements are considered: the available means of the applicant and the supplementary deductible, which includes the assets of the applicant and his/ her spouse. The income of the spouse is not taken into consideration if the spouses are contesting parties.\n\nPublic legal aid covers attorneys’ fees and other costs of legal services in full or in part. This includes any other costs arising from court proceedings:\n\nFee and remuneration of the attorney either in full or in part\n\nAttorney services up to eighty hours in all legal proceedings whether involving court or legal advice etc.\n\nInterpretation and translation costs\n\nEvidence costs\n\nIn addition, the state provides court documents and other official documents necessary for dealing with the matter free of charge; all notifications in the Official Gazette and an initial attempt at enforcement are also provided free of cost. However, state legal aid does not cover legal costs to be paid to the opposing party if the legal aid applicant loses the case.\n\n5.4. Legal aid budget\n\nIn 2014, the overall legal aid budget for civil and criminal matters was €67.7 million. In Finland public lawyers are salaried public lawyers and therefore do not have budgetary duties.\n\n5.5. Legal aid providers\n\nIt is mandated that a Public Legal Aid Attorney should have a post-graduate or a Master’s degree in law along with adequate experience in advocacy or adjudication. The majority of public legal aid attorneys hold the title of varatuomari. The title indicates those who have completed a judicial traineeship at a District Court and have a judicial qualification. They are appointed by the leading Public Legal Aid Attorneys, who in turn are appointed by the Minister of Justice.\n\nThe majority of Public Legal Aid Attorneys are members of the Bar Association, but all Public Legal Aid Attorneys, members or not, are governed by the Finnish Bar Association and mandated to follow the ethics laid down by the Association. Public Legal Aid Attorneys appear in courts and are expected to be competent in legal matters, this includes good oral and written skills, interpersonal skills, and negotiation skills.\n\nThe PLA Attorneys have considerable independence and discretion to accept or reject applications for legal aid in both civil and criminal matters. While the PLAs fall under the Ministry of Justice, the government does not take decisions with regard to overseeing the day-to-day administration. There is a small team of legal aid staff at the Ministry that oversees the functioning, but it plays no role in legal aid decision-making. The PLA is the first point of contact for a client, and each office makes its own decisions.\n\nIn addition, in Finland, the Chancellor of Justice also supervises the PLA, and deals with complaints relating to reasons for refusal of legal aid, or reconsideration of refusal of legal aid or any other error on the part of Legal Aid Offices.\n\nAn Advocate is a member of the Finnish Bar Association, who is subject to the supervision of both the Bar Association and the Chancellor of Justice of the Government. Advocates are under the obligation to observe proper advocacy conduct. The professional designation of Advocate is restricted only to persons entered on the Roll of Advocates of the Bar Association.\n\nThe Public Legal Aid Attorneys (PLAA) are governed by the Legal Aid Act and the State Legal Aid and Public Guardianship Districts Act.\n\n5.6. Quality assurance\n\nAccording to the Legal Aid Act (section 8), legal aid is provided by public legal aid attorneys. However, in matters to be heard by a court of law and in certain other types of cases, also a private attorney who has consented to the task may be appointed as an attorney. Only an advocate or a licensed attorney referred to in the Act on licensed attorneys may be appointed as a private attorney in a legally aided case.\n\nAs explained earlier, an “advocate” is a person who is registered in the Advocates’ Roll as a member of the Finnish Bar Association. As far as eligibility is concerned, a citizen of Finland or a national of the European Economic Area, who is at least 25 years of age, may be accepted as an advocate if they meet certain requirements of honesty and way of life suitable to being an advocate and if they meet the academic requirements stipulated for judicial office, and have the skills to practice as an advocate as per the by-laws of the Bar Association; and he or she is not a bankrupt and has full legal capacity (Advocates Act section 3).\n\nThe Disciplinary Board of the Finnish Bar Association oversees that the code of conduct is followed by attorneys-at-law, public legal aid attorneys and licensed legal counsels as stipulated under the Code of Conduct for Attorneys-at-law (applicable to attorneys-at-law and public legal aid attorneys) or the statutory ethical professional obligations corresponding to the Code of Conduct (applicable to licensed legal counsels). The Disciplinary Board can impose disciplinary sanctions for infringements.\n\nThe Legal Counsel Board considers the granting and revocation of the license of a licensed legal counsel and the imposition of a monetary penalty (Licensed Legal Counsel Act, section 3). The Legal Counsel Board is appointed for a five-year period. The members are: one justice of a court of appeal, one judge of an administrative court or a specialised court, one district court judge, one licensed legal counsel, and one person representing legal research and education. (Section 4 under the Licensed Legal Counsel Act).\n\nThe members of the Disciplinary Board of the Bar Association are judges, professors, public legal aid attorneys, licensed legal counsels and attorneys-at-law. The Board includes a Chairperson and 11 ordinary members, of which the Chairperson and six other members must be attorneys-at-law. Legal aid recipients do not take part in these boards.\n\nAs far as quality and assessment of legal aid is concerned, an annual quality assessment of legal aid services has been carried out since 2011. The data is collected using questionnaires from legal aid customers and self-assessments. The questions concern trust in legal assistance, client relations, efficiency, cost as well as professionalism, skills and knowledge of the assistant.\n\nSometimes additional monitoring is carried out e.g. by the National Audit Office of Finland (Valtiontalouden tarkastusvirasto Julkinen oikeusapu. Tuloksellisuustarkastuskertomus).\n\nIn 2018, the Government’s analysis, assessment and research activities team commissioned the Legal Policy Unit of the Institute of Criminology and Legal Policy (ICPL) to research the experiences of legal aid customers and the quality of legal aid services. The purpose of the study was to produce a comprehensive, multidimensional and realistic picture of the availability, quality and utility of legal aid in Finland. The primary aim of the study was to assess how legal aid can be further improved. The study comprised looking at public legal aid in general, and this included the experiences of asylum seekers and the customers of financial and debt counseling services who can avail of legal aid from 2019.\n\nResearch found that customer satisfaction differed among the classes of persons. For instance, in case of asylum seekers they had both positive and negative experiences. While the customer experiences in case of clients of both public legal aid and financial debt counseling were mostly positive. One of the key emerging gaps was that customers did not receive enough information on the progress of their cases at different stages of the legal aid process; the expertise of the counsellors and quality and fluctuations in their expertise and quality needed attention; and the waiting and queuing time to receive legal aid are sometimes too long in the busiest legal aid offices.\n\nInterviews were conducted with asylum seekers, public legal aid providers, members of the Finnish Bar Association, offices of Financial and Debt Counseling and interviews with young customers seeking financial and debt counseling.[3]\n\nResearch found that customer satisfaction differed among the classes of persons. For instance, in case of asylum seekers they had both positive and negative experiences, whilst the customer experiences of both public legal aid and financial debt counseling were mostly positive. One of the key emerging gaps was that customers did not receive enough information on the progress of their cases at different stages of the legal aid process; the expertise of the counsellors and fluctuations in their expertise and quality needed attention; and the waiting and queuing time to receive legal aid were sometimes too long in the busiest legal aid offices.\n\nPublic Legal Aid Lawyers are provided training periodically, but it is not mandatory to participate in further training.[4]\n\n5.7. Criminal legal aid\n\n5.7.1. Scope of criminal legal aid\n\nIn the case of criminal matters, legal assistance is available through legal aid or via a public defence attorney. Thus, provisions of the Legal Aid Act apply to both civil, criminal cases and administrative cases. Additionally, in criminal matters the Criminal Procedure Act provides for the appointment of a public defender. A suspect can request for a public defender, and in some cases the court appoints one without any request.\n\nIn cases where a suspect is under arrest owing to an ongoing criminal investigation, the suspect has a right to public attorney. Public defenders are appointed by the court. However, in Finland a public legal aid attorney may act as a public defender and private practitioners can also be so appointed based on the defendant’s request. Unlike the legal aid scheme, the public defender scheme was put in place in 1998. Nonetheless, subsequent to the introduction of the public defender scheme, the public defender was considered the primary authority in criminal matters and in providing assistance to the accused. Across the schemes, lawyers charge the same fees.\n\n5.7.2. Eligibility criteria for criminal legal aid\n\nAs with legal aid in civil matters, in criminal cases also means testing applies. Although, under the public defender scheme an accused is guaranteed a public defender irrespective of economic or financial ability. In case the defendant is found guilty, he/she may have to pay the state for the public defence attorney’s fees as per the means testing applicable in the legal aid scheme. If, however, the defendant is acquitted, the state has to reimburse him or her for the costs of the defence, if paid privately by the defendant or covered by the legal aid scheme.\n\n5.7.3. Process for obtaining criminal legal aid\n\nThe above sections on criminal cases and legal aid provide for the procedure in mediation and court cases where legal aid is available.\n\nAs per the principles of fair trial legal representation and the right to be heard, an accused has to be provided the right to be heard and an opportunity for a fair trial under the principles of natural justice.\n\nIn Finland, in criminal matters both proceedings and pre-trial investigations the defendant is entitled to a public defender irrespective of the financial situation. If however the defendant is convicted, he or she is obligated to reimburse the State for the lawyer’s fee based on the financial situation.\n\nA public defender is appointed on request of the suspect or on request of a person arrested or detained. The court can also appoint a public defender for a person under 18 years of age or any other person incapable of taking the decision.\n\nA public legal aid lawyer or a private lawyer can be appointed as a public defender.\n\n5.8. Civil legal aid\n\n5.8.1. Scope of civil legal aid\n\nIn Finland, the scope of legal aid is defined by the ‘need’ for expert assistance in a matter. This provides for a wide coverage. There is no restriction on types of cases, but certain matters such as petty criminal cases or uncontested divorces are not covered. Civil cases explicitly exclude cases regarding membership of a municipality or other public body, tax matters, and cases involving the registration of documents and records. However, if it is considered that the reason for providing legal aid is weighty, legal aid will be provided. The exclusions are not absolute. In addition, legal aid is not available as per the Aliens Act during an initial asylum interview. Legal aid is limited to individuals. The exclusion relates only to representation in court, thus legal advice and legal counselling is available in all cases. There are other notable exceptions relating to asylum cases, where representation may not be provided in case of initial asylum interview or debt settlement cases. Nonetheless, legal advice may be provided in all cases.\n\nAs far as determining whether the person is eligible for legal aid, this is done by lawyers at the Legal Aid Offices. If the applicant is in need and meets the financial eligibility requirement, assistance is provided, with the exception of minor or frivolous cases. The matter is decided independently by the Legal Aid Offices without any interference from the Ministry of Justice.\n\nFinnish legal aid covers the applicant for cases in all courts including appeals. Legal aid is limited to 80 hours of lawyers’ time. A court may grant an extension and legal aid may be continued if there are special reasons for continuing legal aid, on grounds of access to justice and based on the subject matter.\n\nLikewise, in cases of appeal 80 hours is not enough time, and an extension application has to be made. The extension is granted based on the subject matter and on the person’s need for access to justice. As long as the case remains open or is not concluded, legal aid continues. Legal aid however does not cover enforcement of a verdict but the applicant, if covered by legal aid, is not required to pay the enforcement fees to the enforcement agency.\n\nIn Finland, according to the legislation, legal aid can also be granted retrospectively, as long as the application is made at the earliest possible time and before the case is concluded.\n\n5.8.2. Eligibility criteria for civil legal aid\n\nApplicants can apply for legal aid by submitting a legal aid application to the PLAO or via an electronic legal aid application form. Once a date is allocated for a meeting, applicants have to submit all the necessary financial documents, such as proof of income, capital, and debt. Income and capital are taken into consideration in determining the eligibility of the applicant for legal aid. In the case of private lawyers, an application form is submitted by the lawyer along with all the documents.\n\nAs per the Legal Aid Act:\n\n“The economic situation of the applicant is estimated based on the funds available to him or her per month (available means) and his or her assets. The available means are calculated based on the monthly income, necessary expenses and maintenance liability of the applicant and his or her spouse, domestic partner or registered partner. If the applicant is a suspect or a defendant in a criminal case or if the spouses are opposing parties in a case or are separated by reason of irreconcilable differences, legal aid is determined based on the means of the applicant alone.”\n\nFor the purpose of the means testing, applicant’s monthly net income calculated after deducting taxes, monthly expenses, and assets and wealth are taken into account for calculation. It is after the said calculation it is determined if legal.\n\nFor instance, as per the current calculations if the monthly funds of an individual applicant are € 600 or less, legal aid will be granted without any client contribution, and legal aid with a contribution will be awarded if the income is between € 600 and € 1300. Calculation and deductions also take into account spousal income. Finland charges a basic contribution of € 70 from everyone above the lower contribution limit. Over and above that, there is a progressive contribution from 20–75% based on the applicant’s income. There is no upper limit on the amount of percentage contributions. In Finland, in civil litigation the losing party has to incur the litigation costs of the winning party. The litigation costs are not covered by the state legal aid scheme. Research shows that this not only deters poor and middle-income people from litigation, even when their case has merit, but also has consequences for access to justice.\n\nAs per the data in 2014, private lawyers took 32,000 legal aid cases. Of that number, around 66% were criminal matters, 14% fell under the Aliens Act dealing with asylum seekers, and 11% were family matters. The number of cases under the Aliens Act has increased subsequent to the 2013 legislation that provides legal aid to asylum seekers.\n\n5.8.3. Process for obtaining civil legal aid\n\nAn applicant can apply for legal aid directly to any of the PLAO irrespective of where he or she resides. A legal aid application form must be completed and supporting documents relating to income also have to be submitted. The details of the case for which legal aid is being sought and, if the applicant has any insurance that covers legal aid, the insurance document should also be submitted. The applicant can visit the nearest office directly or can submit an online application. Subsequent to the submission of the application, PLA Attorneys independently assess each application and may require further clarification or documents to assess whether legal aid can be granted, based on the subject and means-testing.\n\nChart 13. Legal-aid Application process\n\nOnce legal aid is approved, a lawyer is appointed to attend to the client. If the PLA Attorneys do not have capacity to take on the case, a private lawyer may be suggested. As far as the application is concerned, a private lawyer may also make an application for legal aid to the PLAO when the case needs legal representation in court. Private lawyers cannot provide legal aid at the advice level.\n\nIn the event of denial of legal aid or if an applicant does not meet the requirements of free legal aid, the applicant may challenge the decision by submitting a review to the court. The decision can be challenged whether the denial is due to subject-matter or based on means testing.\n\nBoth the granting of legal aid and termination or amendment of legal aid is an independent decision made by the PLA Office. In case legal aid is terminated, the person given free legal aid may be expected to reimburse for the legal costs incurred so far in the case until termination. The termination of legal aid can be reconsidered by the Administrative Court. If the court rules in favour of the applicant there is no possibility for the PLA to appeal the decision and legal aid should be provided. The termination or amendment of legal aid is made if there is a change in circumstances or if the legal aid should not have been granted in the first place.[5]\n\nIn cases where legal expenses are covered by an insurance claim, legal aid is not provided or granted. Also, matters that do not require expert or attorney advice are not covered.\n\n5.9. Holistic legal services\n\nIn Finland, with respect to family mediation services and child custody, municipal social welfare boards are responsible. Legal aid is not provided in these cases. Family counselling and social welfare services are responsible for child custody-related conflicts. Social welfare services are assigned to the task. Mediation services work in close collaboration with social welfare services. The services offered by social welfare services is state appointed and non-legal.\n\n5.10. Legal aid before regional human rights mechanisms\n\nFinnish public legal aid does not provide legal aid for cases filed in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) or the UN commissions. In case of an application to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), an applicant may be granted legal aid by that Court.\n\n5.11. Alternative sources of legal assistance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, legal advice and fees are covered by insurance and trade unions in certain cases. Finland does not have a tradition of legal clinics in universities.\n\n5.12. Peculiarities of legal aid in Finland\n\nProblems and peculiarities relating to legal aid availability in Finland are specified in detail above and in the conclusions. Kindly refer to the same."
