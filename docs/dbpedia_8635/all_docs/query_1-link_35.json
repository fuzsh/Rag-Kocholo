        "text": "Consider hepatitis A vaccination for most travelers. It is recommended for travelers who will be doing higher risk activities, such as visiting smaller cities, villages, or rural areas where a traveler might get infected through food or water. It is recommended for travelers who plan on eating street food.\n\nCases of measles are on the rise worldwide. Travelers are at risk of measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure, or have not had measles in the past, and travel internationally to areas where measles is spreading.\n\nAll international travelers should be fully vaccinated against measles with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants 6–11 months, according to CDC’s measles vaccination recommendations for international travel.\n\nDogs infected with rabies are not commonly found in Finland.\n\nIf rabies exposures occur while in Finland, rabies vaccines are typically available throughout most of the country.\n\nRabies pre-exposure vaccination considerations include whether travelers 1) will be performing occupational or recreational activities that increase risk for exposure to potentially rabid animals and 2) might have difficulty getting prompt access to safe post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether you should receive pre-exposure vaccination before travel.\n\nFor more information, see country rabies status assessments.\n\nFor travelers moving or traveling to TBE-endemic areas\n\nTBE vaccine is recommended for persons who will have extensive exposure to ticks based on their planned outdoor activities and itinerary.\n\nTBE vaccine may be considered for persons who might engage in outdoor activities in areas ticks are likely to be found."
