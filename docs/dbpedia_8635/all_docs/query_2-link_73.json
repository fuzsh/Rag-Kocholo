        "text": "The Electronic Visa (e-Visa) Application System was launched on 17 April 2013 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Türkiye. This system allows visitors travelling to Türkiye to easily obtain their e-Visas online (www.evisa.gov.tr), in approximately three minutes.\n\nIt is possible to obtain e-Visa 7/24 at everywhere with internet connection. The applicants can obtain their visa after they fill in the necessary information concerning their identity, passport and travel dates and pay visa fee online.\n\nPlease note that e-visa is only valid when the purpose of travel is tourism or commerce. For other purposes, such as work and study, visas are given by Turkish Embassies or Consulates.\n\nThe term \"official passports\" covers diplomatic, service, special and official passports.\n\nYou are kindly advised to have a travel document/passport valid for at least 6 months as from the date of your arrival in Türkiye.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues efforts to strengthen the e-Visa system and to better enable foreign nationals to easily obtain their visas.\n\nIn this context,\n\n- In addition to English, French, and Spanish; Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, German, Arabic and Chinese language options will be added to the e-Visa system.\n\n- In addition to Visa and Master Card, payment is accepted from other commonly used credit cards and debit cards.\n\n- Tour operators may apply for group e-Visas and make lump sum payments for them.\n\n- Necessary arrangements will be made to allow foreign visitors to obtain e-Visas from authorized airline companies offices, including those companies’ offices in airports.\n\n- Fees for e-Visas obtained via the e-Visa website (www.evisa.gov.tr) are lower than the fees for visas obtained upon arrival to Turkish airports.
