        "text": "​​​​\n\nFinland is a parliamentary Republic under the 1999 Constitution. The Head of State is the President of the Republic and the Government is led by a Prime Minister. Finland was formerly considered a semi-presidential parliamentary system, but pursuant to the 1999 constitution and the 2012 constitutional amendments, it is now a full parliamentary democracy. The Parliament (Finnish eduskunta/Swedish riksdagen) is unicameral. It consists of 200 representatives, who are elected for a four-year term. The legislative and administrative system is somewhat different in 'mainland' Finland as opposed to the autonomous province of Åland, which elects one MP.\n\nFinland is an officially bilingual unitary state organised on a decentralised basis. Finland has three levels of governance: central, regional and local. The self-governing powers of the regional level in mainland Finland are limited, though. Local self-government dates back to the 1860s legislation, which remains the basis for the current system. With the independence from Russia in 1917, new legislation was adopted and introduced universal direct suffrage at the municipal level. Local government has developed gradually ever since. In 1995, a Local Government Act was adopted. This was revised in 2015. In addition, the Åland Islands are granted a special status as a self-governing, unilingual province since 1921, in order to safeguard the position of Swedish language, culture and local customs on the Islands.\n\nA major healthcare and social services reform, which would have moved considerable powers to the regional level, was debated in 2016-2019. However, the reform legislation did not pass the Parliament in order to be ready before the parliamentary elections in the spring of 2019. Thus, basic health care and social services are still organised at the municipal level. The specialized health care system is organised in dedicated health care districts (20 districts) and five appointed areas of responsibility led by university hospitals.\n\nThe planned reform included 18 new regional level units (provinces or regions in English) to become the responsible units for health care and social services. These regional units were meant to have elected councils as decision-making bodies with financial resources. This would have ended the position of municipalities as health care and social service organisers. So far, mainland Finland does not have regional‑level institutions with elected decision-making bodies.\n\nFinland comprises 19 provinces (maakunta/landskap), 18 on the mainland plus the self-governing Åland Islands, and 310 municipalities (kunta/kommun). The 18 Regional Councils (maakunnan liitto/landskapsförbund) are indirectly composed by the local authorities of the mainland province and constitute mandatory joint municipal authorities. The Regional Councils are stipulated in Finnish law, and each council receives funding from its member municipalities as well as funds for regional development from the government and the European Union.\n\nIn the Programme of Prime Minister Antti Rinne's Government 6 June 2019, taken over by Prime Minister Sanna Marin's Government on 10 December 2019, social and health care services are planned to be reorganized on the basis of 18 mainland provinces as described above. The main difference compared to the reform of the former government is that services would be primarily provided by public sector organisations with private and third sector organisations as supplementary service providers. Mainland provinces would become a new democratic level in the Finnish governance system. The new role of municipalities as service providers would be reconsidered through a new analysis by the government.\n\nSix Regional State Administrative Agencies (AVI) and 15 Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY) took over the duties of the former counties (lääni/län) in 2010[1] and constitute the regional level of deconcentrated state administration.\n\nThe Åland Islands, with a large Swedish speaking majority (88%), is a self-governing province since 1921, having its own parliament and government. It is further divided into 16 municipalities.\n\nThe local self-government principle is enshrined in the Finnish Constitution. Local authorities are given administrative competences under law. Regional Councils have administrative duties whereas municipalities also have regulatory powers. Local authorities are entitled to levy taxes.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance monitors local operations and finances in general and ensures that municipal autonomy is taken into account in the preparation of legislation concerning local authorities.\n\nThe Åland Islands status is regulated by international decisions and agreements. The province Åland has legislative powers, which are enshrined in the Finnish Autonomy Act (itsehallintolaki/självstyrelselagen). The Åland legislative power is not delegated so that the Finnish Parliament may not legislate in areas or matters belonging to the authority of the Åland Parliament. The Autonomy Act enumerates the matters belonging to the State authority and the Åland authority in two different lists; this division is exclusive to the extent that a State law is not in force in Åland if Åland has legislative power in the matter. There is no hierarchy between the Finnish and Åland acts.\n\nBesides the Constitution, there are several acts which describe the vertical division of powers on the Finnish mainland, the most important being:\n\nLocal Government Act 410/2015The Division into Regions Act 1159/1997\n\nThe law on regional development and the management of Structural Fund operations (7/2014)\n\nThe Act on Restructuring Local Governments and Services (Framework Act) 169/2007.\n\n[the above acts are available only in Finnish and Swedish]\n\nLegislation covering social welfare and health, education and culture gives further details on the vertical division of powers.\n\nCentral\n\nThe State is in charge of civil service, which is also devolved at the regional (Regional State Administrative Agencies and Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment Agencies) and local levels.\n\nThe State has legislative powers in all areas, except in the Åland Islands. However, it has exclusive competences, with regard to the Åland Islands in:\n\nForeign affairs;\n\nMost civil and criminal law;\n\nThe judiciary system;\n\nState taxation.\n\nRegional State Administrative Agencies (State authorities)\n\nBasic public services, legal rights and permits;\n\nEducation and culture\n\nOccupational health and safety;\n\nEnvironmental permits;\n\nFire and rescue services and preparedness;\n\nCentres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (State authorities) are responsible for the regional implementation and development tasks of the central government.\n\nAdvise, finance, and develop services for enterprises;
