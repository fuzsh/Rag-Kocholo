        "text": "Although the liberation from Russia occurred peacefully, Finland was unable to avert a violent internal conflict. After the revolutionary Reds had won control of the Social Democratic Party, they went into action and on January 28, 1918, seized Helsinki and the larger industrial towns in southern Finland. The right-wing government led by the Conservative Pehr Evind Svinhufvud fled to the western part of the country, where a counterattack was organized under the leadership of General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim. At the beginning of April the White Army under his command won the Battle of Tampere. German troops came to the aid of the White forces in securing Helsinki; by May the rebellion had been suppressed, bringing to an end the Finnish Civil War. It was followed by trials in which harsh sentences were passed. During the summer and fall of 1918 some 20,000 former revolutionaries either were executed or died in prison camps, bringing the total losses of the war to more than 30,000 lives. A few of the revolutionary leaders, however, managed to escape to Soviet Russia, where a small contingent founded the Finnish Communist Party in Moscow; others continued their flight to the United States and western Europe, some gradually returning to Finland.\n\nPolitical change\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Finland\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Petteri Orpo\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 5,625,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 0.937 euro\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Alexander Stubb\n\nWhen the Civil War ended, it was decided, during the summer of 1918, to make Finland a monarchy, and in October the German prince Frederick Charles of Hessen was chosen as king. With Germany’s defeat in the war, however, General Mannerheim was designated regent, with the task of submitting a proposal for a new constitution. As it was obvious that Finland was to be a republic, the struggle now concerned presidential power. The liberal parties and the reorganized Social Democratic Party wanted power to be invested in Parliament, while the Conservatives wanted the president to have powers independent of Parliament. The strong position held by the Conservatives after the Civil War enabled them to force through their motion that the president should be chosen by popularly elected representatives, independent of Parliament, and also that he should possess a great deal more authority, especially regarding foreign policy, than at that time was usual for a head of state. After the new constitution had been confirmed on July 17, 1919, the Social Democrats positioned themselves behind the liberal National Progressive Party leader, Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg, to make him the first president of Finland and to defeat the Conservative candidate Mannerheim, who had not convinced them of his loyalty to republicanism.\n\nAgrarian reform\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 9:41 AM ET (South China Morning Post)\n\nBeijing admits Chinese ship destroyed key Baltic gas pipeline ‘by accident’\n\nAug. 10, 2024, 3:19 AM ET (New York Times)\n\nLee Carsley placed in interim charge of England ahead of Nations League - The Athletic\n\nAug. 9, 2024, 4:39 AM ET (ABC News (U.S.))\n\nEngland delays announcing permanent successor to Southgate and appoints Carsley as interim coach\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 9:12 AM ET (The Telegraph)\n\nFinland will not hold Trump peace summit, says foreign minister\n\nDuring the interwar years Finland, to a much greater extent than the rest of the Nordic countries, was an agrarian country. In 1918, 70 percent of the population was employed in agriculture and forestry, and by 1940 the figure was still as high as 57 percent. Paper and wooden articles were Finland’s most important export commodities. By the Smallholdings Law of 1918 and by land reform in 1922, which allowed the expropriation of estates of more than 495 acres (200 hectares), an attempt was made to give tenant farmers and landless labourers their own smallholdings. More than 90,000 smallholdings were created, and since then the independent smallholders, who form the majority of the Agrarian Party (now the Centre Party), have been a major factor in Finnish politics.\n\nPolitical parties\n\nDuring Ståhlberg’s presidency (1919–25), the right-wing parties and the Agrarian Party held power by means of coalitions. The president tried determinedly to minimize the recriminations of the Civil War, and in the course of time he granted amnesty to those who had received long terms of imprisonment. At the same time, the Social Democratic Party was reorganized under the leadership of Väinö Tanner with an exclusively reformist program. When Tanner in 1926 formed a Social Democratic minority government, which granted a general amnesty, the old differences from the Civil War had been almost eliminated. Lauri Kristian Relander, the Agrarian Party’s candidate, was elected president in 1925.\n\nThrough the first decade of Finnish independence the Social Democratic Party remained the largest party in the Parliament. In the early 1920s the leftist wing of the Social Democrats separated from the party to preach Communism and succeeded in winning 27 seats in the 1922 election. It later changed its name from Socialist Labour Party to Labour Party, but this did not stop the police from arresting all of its parliamentary representatives for treason on the grounds of the party’s revolutionary intent. The Communists, however, once more reorganized and worked closely with the Finnish Communist Party in the Soviet Union. In the following elections they were able to win about 20 seats in Parliament.\n\nAs a reaction to the growing Finnish Communist Party, the Lapua (Lappo) Movement emerged and in the years 1929–32 attempted to force its demands through actions against Communist newspapers, acts of terrorism against individual citizens, and mass demonstrations. These actions, which were supported by the Conservatives and many members of the Agrarian Party, were at first successful. The Communists were prevented from taking part in the 1930 election, and the 66 Social Democrats were one too few in the Parliament to prevent the passage of an anti-Communist law. This law banned the public activities of the Communist Party, forced its members underground, and stripped them of their right to vote, virtually eliminating their influence on Finnish politics. In 1931 Svinhufvud was elected president with the help of the Lapua Movement. When the Lapua Movement shortly afterward turned its activities against the Social Democrats and tried to seize power by force in the Mäntsälä coup attempt in 1932, the president intervened and managed in a radio speech to calm the rebellion. Another failure at this time was the law on the total prohibition of alcohol, introduced in 1919. As in the United States, the law resulted in a sharp increase in organized crime and smuggling, and after a referendum in 1932 it was repealed."
