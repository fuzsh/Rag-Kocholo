        "text": "The president, whose role is mainly ceremonial, is directly elected for up to two six-year terms. In 2018, former finance minister and incumbent president Sauli Niinistö, originally of the center-right National Coalition Party (KOK), won a second presidential term with 62.6 percent of the vote, defeating several challengers. The election was considered broadly free and fair.\n\nThe prime minister, the head of government, is selected by Finland’s freely elected parliament. Following parliamentary elections in April 2019, Antti Rinne of the Social Democratic Party became prime minister in June. However, he resigned due to criticism within the governing coalition over his handling of a postal workers’ strike in November 2019, and Sanna Marin was chosen by the party to replace him in December 2019.\n\nRepresentatives in the 200-seat, unicameral parliament, the Eduskunta, are elected to serve four-year terms. In March 2019, the coalition government headed by Prime Minister Sipilä of the Center Party resigned after failing to secure parliamentary support for a reform of the health care system, one of its key priorities. The move triggered the elections held in April 2019. Prior to the 2019 elections, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) expressed “a high level of confidence in all the aspects of the electoral process” and concluded that it was not necessary to send an election observation mission.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party won the largest share of the vote, taking 40 seats. The right-wing Finns Party placed second with 39 seats. The new government formed in June 2019 comprised the Social Democratic Party, the Center Party with 31 seats, the Green League with 20 seats, the Left Alliance with 16 seats, and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland with 9 seats. The remainder of seats went to KOK, which took 38, the Christian Democrats with 5, the new Movement Now with 1, and the Åland Coalition, also with 1.\n\nCitizens from the Finnish majority and all ethnic minorities enjoy full political rights. The Åland Islands—an autonomous region located off the southwestern coast whose inhabitants speak Swedish—have their own 30-seat parliament, as well as one seat in the national legislature. The Sámi of northern Finland, an Indigenous people who number about 10,000, have a legislature with limited powers, but they do not have guaranteed representation in the parliament. Members of the Sámi community continue to call for greater inclusion in political decision-making processes.\n\nWomen and women’s interests are reasonably well represented in politics, as are LGBT+ people and their respective interests. Prime Minister Marin is the third woman to serve as Finland’s head of government. Her installation also marked the first time that all parties in a Finnish governing coalition were headed by women.\n\nFreedom of expression is protected by Article 12 of the constitution and the 2003 Act on the Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media. Media outlets in Finland are typically independent and free from political pressure or censorship, and the media environment is strong.\n\nHowever, journalists sometimes face harassment for their work, notably those who cover topics related to immigrants and immigration. Journalists also face the risk of defamation charges. In April 2019, investigative reporter Johanna Vehkoo was convicted of defaming a far-right politician and ordered to pay more than $7,000 in fines and compensation. Vekhoo was granted leave to appeal the decision in April 2021.\n\nReligious freedom is guaranteed in the constitution and generally respected in practice. However, far-right hate speech and incidents of vandalism directed at the Jewish and Muslim communities are ongoing concerns. In July 2021, the Interior Ministry published a report identifying both perceived threats to the premises of religious communities and potential solutions for improving security in and around these locations. The report found that while, overall, more than 70 percent of those surveyed felt their religious premises were generally safe, only 69 percent of Muslim respondents and 32.5 percent of Jewish respondents felt safe in and around their religious premises.\n\nFreedom of assembly is protected by law and upheld in practice. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government restricted public events—including protests—to no more than 50 people in March 2020. This restriction was removed in October of that year.\n\nIn October 2020, police used pepper spray against protesters obstructing traffic, who were associated with the environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion and calling on the government to take more significant measures to combat the climate crisis. An official inquiry into accusations of assault levied against the police for their actions was opened in December 2020 and remained ongoing at the end of 2021.\n\nThe constitution guarantees the Sámi people cultural autonomy and the right to pursue their culturally significant livelihoods, which include fishing and reindeer herding. However, representatives of the community have said that they cannot fully exercise their rights in practice and face restrictions on land use. While Roma comprise a very small percentage of Finland’s population, they are significantly disadvantaged and marginalized.\n\nWomen enjoy equal legal rights. Despite an equal pay law, women earn only about 84 percent as much as men on average, and women’s pensions are worth roughly 20 percent less than men’s. In 2020, the government initiated a new policy that grants new parents seven months of parental leave, regardless of gender.\n\nA June 2019 report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) noted an increase in racist and intolerant hate speech in Finland, especially toward Muslims and refugees. Hate speech on the internet was also a concern, with targets including immigrants, people of African descent, LGBT+ people, the Jewish community, and Roma. A 2020 report by Finland’s Non-Discrimination Ombudsman further highlighted racism against people of African descent. In September 2021, the Finnish Ministry of Justice and the Equality Commissioner launched a campaign encouraging people to take action against racism.\n\nThe Nordic Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi organization that the National Police Board has called “violent and openly racist,” was banned in March 2019, following a Supreme Court ruling that the organization abused freedom of assembly and speech. This is the first time an organization has been given a cease-and-desist order in Finland since the 1970s.\n\nIn 2016, the Finnish government amended its asylum law to limit the aid available to asylum seekers. The amendments prompted concern from the UN refugee agency, which suggested that authorities had abandoned good practices and sought to align their policies with the minimum required by international treaties governing the treatment of refugees. International human rights NGOs have also criticized the policies, saying they restrict the rights of asylum seekers.\n\nIndividuals in Finland are free to travel abroad and domestically. The country has one of the most expansive “freedom to roam” policies in the world, allowing people to use any public or private land for recreational purposes so long as the privacy of a private residence is not violated, and no environmental damage is incurred. There are no undue restrictions on people’s ability to change their place of residence, education, or employment.\n\nAfter the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, entry restrictions for noncitizens were implemented temporarily. Beginning in November 2020, passengers entering Finland were required to have a certificate of a negative COVID-19 test taken less than 72 hours before arrival. Such restrictions were lifted in July 2021 for people who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 and were entering Finland from the EU and Schengen countries.\n\nPeople’s choices on personal status matters are for the most part unrestricted. Same-sex marriage has been allowed since 2017. However, legislation requires that transgender people be sterilized and have a mental health diagnosis in order to obtain legal recognition of their gender. In 2017, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) called for Finland to eliminate these impediments to legal gender recognition. The ECRI echoed this call in 2019. The government appointed a working group intended to draft reforms to this law in June 2021.\n\nThe UNHRC has also recommended that Finland amend its criminal code to no longer define rape according to the degree of violence used by the perpetrator. The new coalition government in 2019 placed this matter on its agenda, and in July 2020 the Ministry of Justice issued a recommendation to include consent in the definition of rape. Domestic violence is an ongoing concern."
