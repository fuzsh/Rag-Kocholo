        "text": "Finland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2023 for the period 2023-2027. The NAP was developed with administrative branches and civil society through workshops, seminars and evaluation of the previous NAP (p. 33). The cross-administrative WPS monitoring group coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a key role in preparing the finalized version of the NAP, and the NAP states that the expertise of NGOs and civil society was tapped across a broad front (p.33). The implementation of the NAP will be primarily coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Ministry of the Interior and the Crisis Management Centre (CMC Finland), which operates in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Environment. NGOs that have committed to implementing the NAP include Finn Church Aid, the Rule of Law Centre, the Finnish Refugee Council, the Finnish Red Cross, and the Family Federation of Finland.\n\nFinland’s NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and identifies five thematic objectives: conflict prevention and peacebuilding; peace processes and peace mediation; security sector, crisis management, and crisis preparedness; safety of women and girls and realization of their rights in conflicts; and mainstreaming and advocacy (p28). The NAP also outlines principles that underscore the country’s approach to lasting peace, conflict prevention and crisis management, including: human rights-based planning; the concept of comprehensive security (e.g. impacts of climate change, health threats, human rights violations, migration, economic crises, inequalities as well as recognising that peace is not just the absence of violent conflict, but an equal and democratic society underpinned by human rights and human security); a gender transformative approach; and intersectionality (p.24). The NAP does not include monitoring and implementation indicators. Instead, it states that a separate implementation plan will be drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and indicators will be created to underpin the monitoring of the plan (p.73). Despite an evaluation report of Finland’s third NAP stating that the greatest challenges in implementation were associated with undersized personnel and budgetary resources, no clear budget is mentioned in the fourth NAP (p.23).\n\nThe three former NAPs were adopted in 2008, 2012 and 2018, for the periods 2008-2011, 2012-2016, and 2018-2021 respectively. The structure and level of detail across Finland’s NAPs remains similar, with each NAP focusing on conflict prevention, peace processes and peacebuilding and crisis management, with the safety and human rights of women and girls appearing as an overarching objective across them all. Additionally, the fourth NAP continues the work of the third NAP in terms of addressing disarmament with a specific outcome focused on incorporating gender perspectives into arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation (p.38). The fourth NAP, however, also has an additional section relating to mainstreaming of the WPS agenda, and the advocacy work that Finland aims to do at the country and international level (p.69).\n\nFinland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but experiences ongoing political tension because of the military exercises conducted by Russia in the Baltic Sea Region. Additionally, about six months prior to the publication of the fourth NAP, Finland formally joined NATO, which is a major policy shift away from non-alignment. Domestically and regionally, Finland works on the WPS agenda through diplomacy, crisis management, development cooperation, humanitarian aid and other expert work and training with EU policy measures. Internationally, Finland has collaborated with the governments of Afghanistan, Kenya and Nepal to support their efforts in the implementation and follow-up of their WPS NAPs. Finland is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for GBV in humanitarian emergencies.\n\nNAP Development\n\nThe NAP was developed with administrative branches and civil society through workshops, seminars and evaluation of the previous NAP (p. 33). The cross-administrative WPS monitoring group coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a key role in preparing the finalized version of the NAP, and the NAP states that the expertise of NGOs and civil society was tapped across a broad front (p.33)\n\nNAP Implementation\n\nThe implementation of the NAP will be primarily coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Ministry of the Interior and the Crisis Management Centre (CMC Finland), which operates in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Environment. NGOs that have committed to implementing the NAP include Finn Church Aid, the Rule of Law Centre, the Finnish Refugee Council, the Finnish Red Cross, and the Family Federation of Finland.\n\nNAP Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nThere is no specific information about the actors involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. The NAP states that a separate implementation plan and measures will be drawn up under the coordination of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure efficient implementation (p.73). It also states that the “implementing parties” will participate in the preparation of this plan, establishing their areas of responsibility and updating it when necessary (p.73).\n\nWILPF\n\nWILPF Finland was founded in 1926 by Maikki Friberg, the long-time president of the Union of Women’s Affairs and the group is the oldest women’s peace organization in Finland. WILPF Finland is part of various initiatives at the national level, including against Finnish membership of NATO. The section also works to raise awareness about UNSCR 1325.\n\nActors\n\nNAP Development\n\nJust like the previous NAPs, the 1325 Network of civil society played an active role in the updating of the NAP by lobbying for their recommendations to be taken into consideration during the development of creation of the 2018-2021 NAP.\n\nThe government actors involved in the development of the 2018-2021 NAP were the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Crisis Management Centre Finland, and the Finnish Defense Forces.\n\nNAP Implementation\n\nCivil society is also responsible for the implementation of the 2018-2021 NAP, including through submitting proposals and initiatives aimed at ensuring that the WPS Agenda is integrated into international and regional policies, strategies and activities.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity are responsible for the implementation of the 2018-2021 NAP.\n\nNAP Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nRepresentatives of civil society organisations participate in the monitoring and evaluation work of the follow-up group.\n\nThe overall monitoring and evaluation of the 2018-2021 NAP will be systematically monitored by the national follow-up group, which is led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Within the national follow-up group, there are members of different ministries, agencies, civil society organisations and the research community.\n\nTimeframe\n\nThe third NAP is to be implemented in a period of four years 2018-2021 (four years).\n\nObjectives\n\nThe main goals of the 2018-2021 NAP are:\n\n1. Women play a more meaningful role and there is more emphasis on mainstreaming the gender perspective in mediation, peace processes and transition processes.\n\n2. Women play a more meaningful role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding.\n\n3. Mainstreaming of the gender perspective is more integrated into the security sector and crisis management.\n\n4. Women and girls receive better protection, their rights are better safeguarded and their needs are better met during crises.\n\n5. Finland promotes the objectives 1-4 in the policies, strategies and work of international and regional organisations and by encouraging the development of National Action Plans.\n\nActions/Activities\n\nFinland’s 2018-2021 NAP has various activities assigned to achieve its objectives. For example, for the first objective “women play a more meaningful role and there is greater emphasis on mainstreaming of the gender perspective in mediation, peace and processes and transition processes” has the following external actions outlined:\n\nActively develop meditation as part of conflict prevention in conflict-affected countries and in international forums;\n\nProvide political and economic support along with expertise for civil society actors in conflict and conflict-prone regions;\n\nCreate practices strengthening and facilitating the participation of women by identifying obstacles to their participation;\n\nEnsure the collection of good practices in the field to be used in mediation.\n\nIndicators\n\nThe 2018-2021 NAP includes fewer indicators than the previous NAPs. For example, regarding Objective 1 on “women play a more meaningful role and there is greater emphasis on mainstreaming of the gender perspective in mediation, peace processes and transition processes” the following indicators have been proposed for Outcomes 1.1 and 1.2 along with the bodies responsible for its effectiveness:\n\nOutcome 1.1 - Challenges/objectives to women’s meaningful participation and gender mainstreaming in mediation, peace processes and transition processes have been identified:\n\nFinland strengthens the link between practical work in the field and research-based conflict analysis on women’s participation in mediation, peace processes and transition process. The responsible bodies are: the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Finn Church Aid (FCA), The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission (FELM) and the Crisis Management Initiative (CMI);\n\nFinland promotes high-level experience sharing, collection of lessons learned and mentoring. The responsible parties are: Ministry for Foreign Affairs, FCA, FELM and CMI;\n\nFinland raises awareness at international regional forums of women’s participation in mediation, peace and transition processes in all levels. The bodies responsible are: Ministry for Foreign Affairs, FCA, FELM and CMI.\n\nOutcome 1.2 -Recommendations have been implemented to increase women’s meaningful participation and gender mainstreaming in mediation, peace and transition processes\n\nFinland promotes the inclusion of the gender perspective in mediation, peace and transition processes. The responsible bodies are: Ministry for Foreign Affairs, FCA, FELM and CMI;\n\nFinland supports women’s participation before and during peace, dialogue and transition processes, formal or informal. Bodies responsible are: Ministry for Foreign Affairs, FCA, FELM and CMI;\n\nFinland provides public authorities and other relevant actors with training on the inclusion of the gender perspective at various stages of peace processes. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is responsible for this indicator;\n\nLastly, women are increasingly present at the post-agreement implementation and monitoring phases in which Finland is involved. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, FCA, FELM and CMI are also responsible.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nSimilar to the previous NAPs, the national follow-up group will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the 2018-2021 NAP. Detailed mid-term and final evaluation reports will be prepared by the follow-up group and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Unlike the previous NAPs, technical working groups will be created to address the different themes presented in the 2018-2021 NAP to ensure and facilitate cooperation, communication and reporting between the entities responsible for overall implementation. Based on these reports, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will prepare an annual report to the Foreign Affairs Committee of Parliament with updates on the implementation of the NAP.\n\nBudget\n\nSimilar to the previous NAPs, the 2018-2021 NAP does not provide any allocated budget or an estimated budget. It does however mention that the central government must provide monetary support for civil society organisations’ 1325 work. There is no mention on the budget in reference to its general implementation.\n\nDisarmament\n\nUnlike the previous NAPs, the third updated NAP creates a strong connection between women, disarmament and non-proliferation. Weapons are addressed as a risk to women’s security. More specifically, in its second objective on “women play a more meaningful role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding”, outcome 2.3 includes information on disarmament. Outcome 2.3 states:\n\nThe gender perspective has been incorporated into arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation at national and international levels.\n\nFinland supports the implementation of Article 7 (4) of the Arms Trade Treaty, on preventing gender-based violence, by all State Parties. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be responsible for this outcome;\n\nFinland includes the gender perspective in arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation at national and international levels. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be responsible for this outcome;\n\nFinland promotes and supports the meaningful participation of women and women’s organisations in policy discussions and negotiations on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be responsible for this outcome."
