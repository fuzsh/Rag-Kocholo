        "text": "Finland is a sparsely populated country that is fairly homogenous but also features three notable historic minorities (in addition to a small foreign-born population): the Sámi Indigenous peoples, the Swedish-speaking minority, and the Roma people. Finnish territory also encompasses the Åland islands, an autonomous region that hosts its own parliament and holds one seat in the national legislature. To some extent, and perhaps more so historically, the language divide (Finnish/Swedish) also carries explanatory power in terms of national political competition – with the Swedish People’s Party, which represents the interests of the minority Swedish-speaking Finnish population, remaining a frequent coalition partner.\n\nThe Finnish political culture is pragmatic, as actors often cooperate across traditional ideological divides. Finnish politics take place within the framework of a multi-party, parliamentary system that is distinctive for its oversized majority coalitions. Much in line with larger trends in Western Europe, sociocultural dimensions have increasingly come to drive Finnish politics – particularly in terms of post-materialist issues such as immigration, the promotion of gender equality, environmental protection, and minority rights - including with respect to the Sámi and the Roma populations. There has also been a rise in hate crimes, and allegations of racism among government officials have been worsening, triggering large-scale anti-racism protests in Helsinki in 2023. National security concerns have heightened following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with claims that Russia is instrumentalizing migration into Finland as a way to exert political pressure. Finland’s decision to join NATO took place in this context of heightened security risks.\n\nFinland is a leader in gender equality. Women’s political representation is a particular strength (the Eduskunta is among the legislatures with the highest female participation in Europe), and women’s rights were recently expanded following reforms easing access to abortion in 2022, and amendments making the definition of rape based on consent. Other advances in gender equality include the approval of legislation enabling legal gender recognition by self-declaration, with impacts on the rights of transgender people. However, gender-based violence remains a problem, with roughly one in three Finnish women having experienced intimate partner violence.\n\nLooking ahead, it will be important to watch Rights, especially in relation to the government’s anti-discrimination plan, devised in consultation with civil society and academics. Additionally, it will be important to watch debates on reforming the Sámi Parliament Act to enable the self-identification of Sámi people in Finland, for possible impacts on Social Group Equality. Planned social security cuts and labour reforms, which have triggered political strikes and industrial action, may impact labour rights and freedom of association. Finally, it will be important to pay attention to shifting immigration policy, in view of proposals to change border procedures and to temporarily restrict the reception of asylum-seekers via emergency measures."
