        "text": "Slowdive are an English rock band founded in 1989. The band consists of Rachel Goswell on vocals and guitar, Simon Scott on drums, Neil Halstead on vocals and guitar, Nick Chaplin on bass and Christian Savill on guitar. Several other drummers also briefly played with the band.\n\nThe band was heavily influenced by Pink Floyd, The Sex Pistols, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and many more. Slowdive's formative pop experiences involve post-punk groups like the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees, whose artsy approach was closer to '70s progressive groups than punk's angry minimalism\". Halstead stated that Slowdive wanted \"to create something big and beautiful and sort of timeless\"."
