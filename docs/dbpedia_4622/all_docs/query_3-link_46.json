        "text": "Since the first period of 2000’s when the internet brought back to life of classic Shoegaze bands and with the rise of Post-Rock bands led by Sigur Ros or Explosion in the Sky, Thai alternative music scene got heavily inspired by those genres. Bands such as Goose, Desktop Error, Assajan Jakgawan (อัศจรรย์ จักรวาล), Swirling Light were the influential figures for those Shoegaze/ Post-Rock/ Experimental Thai bands that came after. Even if some of them have split up, still play the important role for Thai alternative music scene. Some are the founders of record companies which provide the sound that reminds us of those time in 00s, the glory days of Shoegaze/Post-Rock.\n\n.\n\nThese days, with the popularity of band such as DIIV, Thai bands develop their style of Shoegaze which are heavily charged with dreamy sounds and obscure lyrics. Band like ‘Death of Heather’ or ‘Mind Wanders’ are good examples. At the same time, the Post-Grunge style of Nothing, Whirr created Thai band like ‘Telever', which is more of a 'wall-of-sound/Noise type'.\n\nI am also part of the collective 'The Year Shoegaze Broke' (with member of the band ‘Low Fly’, ‘Reverse’) that hosted few events that gathering unknown Shoegaze bands to play together. We also hosted the event: 'Shoegazer Night' that pays tribute to those Shoegaze legendary bands: MBV, Slowdive, RIDE, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Nothing, Whirr by Thai bands ‘Follows’, ‘Telever’, ‘Blue Yogurt’, ‘Frizzy Hair’ and founders of 'The Year Shoegaze Broke' band, to play the copycat of holocaust section in 'You Made Me Realise'. Its goal is to gain more attention for Thai music listeners who are familiar to those classic Shoegaze bands but still have no idea about what was going on the Shoegaze scene of their own country.\n\nEven through the first-tier names for Thai Shoegaze band these days belongs to ‘Follows’, ‘Hariguem Zaboy’ (which change their direction to the more Post-Punk sound in their upcoming album), Thai Shoegaze community keeps growing, with the decline of Post-Rock and growth of Dream Pop/Post-Punk, Thai Shoegazers, who share listeners with these genres, have hopefully a bright future.\n\nThe year shoegaze broke is a group of people who love genre of Shoegaze, Dream pop and Noise pop. We came together to organize our own gig, concerts and tours. In order to make Shoegaze music more popular in Thai society.\n\nDESKTOP ERROR\n\nDesktop Error, is a Thai Alternative Indie Rock band, formed by a group of friends that have been hanging together since secondary school and university. Their love for similar type of music and lifestyle, eventually inspired them to form a band. They are:\n\nINSPIRATIVE - อินสไปเรทีฟ\n\nInspirative is a post-rock band from Bangkok, Thailand formed in 2006. The band initially started as a solo project of Noppanan Panicharoen. They work the Reverb like nobody and brush on genres like Shoegaze and Ambient.\n\nListening to Inspirative is like walking into the shop of a master sound crafter. All you discover has been studied, thought completely through, melodies, sound, texture, and colors. They are all masterpieces made by a band that has not only worked hard but also thought hard about their music and are clever about their choices. You can feel that the evolution is not just been let to itself: it has been planned, designed.\n\nIf you want to know more you can read our collaboration their music, the band or their interview.\n\nAll members joined in 2008 and turned into a full band consist of:\n\nThanks & more\n\nFirst a big thank you to Punnawich for his work (superb introduction) and his kindness. He is a treasure of information and contacts on the Thai scene + do a superb work in getting the Shoegaze genre better known. Make sure to follow his The year shoegaze broke if you are in Thailand.\n\nThanks to Manasya B Sachorfah (Bas) for her time in providing information on Swirling Light. Thanks to all the Telever, Monomania, Solitude is Bliss that reviewed the information above + to Desktop Error and Inspirative for all their kindness and patience when we worked together in the past.\n\nAnd last thanks to the Facebook group Shoegaze Japan that always support Asian and Thai music.\n\nStay tuned for the volume 2 with many more exceptional bands."
