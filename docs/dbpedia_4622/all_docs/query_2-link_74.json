        "text": "You join us, as is traditional at Slowdive shows, floating in God’s teardrop as it shatters slowly into a crystal ocean. Although, as shoegaze’s reclaimed godheads struck up the first glacial shimmers of their biggest ever headline show, drenching the Apollo in hypnotic fractals, they might not have appreciated me bursting into such purple prose.\n\nIt was arguably the pretensions inherent in trying to describe their lustrous sonic maelstroms (see?) which saw them become objects of ridicule throughout their initial 1990s incarnation and declared more hateable than Hitler by Manic Street Preachers’ Richey Edwards. They’d likely baulk at such thesaurus-bothering now, 10 years into a reunion that every reformed mid-tier Nineties indie band would die for.\n\nWith the world having come round to the evocative richness of shoegaze in the 19-year absence following their 1995 split, these terminally out-of-focus Reading waifs returned as lost heroes, playing the biggest shows of their career and showered in critical bouquets: last year’s fifth album, Everything Is Alive, was hailed as their crowning achievement. At one particularly glistening moment at the Apollo, singer Rachel Goswell – looking quite the futuristic cult leader with her mystic’s rings and trinkets, and her blonde-black bob - stepped away from her feather boa-festooned mike stand and soaked in the crowd’s long-deserved reverence with a settled vindication.\n\nForgive us our Coleridgeisms, though, as we attempt to dance about the architecture of Slowdive’s sound. With Goswell and lead guitarist Neil Halstead’s vocals so buried in reverb they seemed to melt into the ghost dimension, Shanty evolved from a miasma of icicle guitars and crypt-lurking drumbeats into a cavernous crescendo that sounded like The Cure overdosing on Radox. Souvlaki Space Station was as vast and cosmic as its title suggests, even burning up on re-entry. And the swooping, oceanic Catch the Breeze, their 1991 debut single, was what a seagull might hear in its head if, an hour earlier, it had stolen Wayne Coyne’s chips.\n\nThat the song slowly expanded into an intense noise barrage, complete with blinding strobes and warp -tunnel visuals, proved what master mood-builders Slowdive have become. They wield the power in their music with a casual modesty, setting out to soothe then overwhelm the listener with each song. Take Star Roving, where verses of diaphanous bliss gave way to a climax of scorched guitars that could only be described as Icarus rock. Or Crazy for You, another myth-evoking song that lured us in with its one-line siren call, then crashed us into black metallic rocks.\n\nIn case we might take it all too seriously, they peppered their newer songs with Phil Spector melodies (Skin in the Game) and New Order synth-hooks (Kisses), and closed with a cover of Syd Barrett’s Golden Hair, drifting from dusk to dawn inside five minutes and ending with visual tributes to both Barrett and Carry On gurner Sid James. Across 90 minutes of scintillating calm and fury, Slowdive redeemed an entire genre and more than proved their standing alongside more revered forebears such as The Cocteau Twins and Spacemen 3. We’re going to need a bigger thesaurus.\n\nOn tour until February 27; see slowdiveofficial.com"
