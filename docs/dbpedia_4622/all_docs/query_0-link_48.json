        "text": "The year was 1995 and Slowdive had just split up after three albums. I was around 24 years old so I decided to go travelling around the Middle East – I really wanted to go see the Valley of the Kings and Karnak. I was staying in a lot of hostels and at each stop, you just got chatting to people. They’d always ask what I did. I’d reply, “Well, I’m sort of a musician.” Inevitably, someone would hand me a guitar. That’s when I realised that I couldn’t play guitar. Because Slowdive used weird tunings, I never learned proper guitar chords and I didn’t know how to play anyone else’s songs either. It was always a really embarrassing moment for me. I said I was a musician, but I couldn’t actually play a song for anyone. Very convincing.\n\nThis experience started me on a course of getting into music that I hadn’t really listened to before. I’d grown up really into bands like The Cure, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Sonic Youth and Cocteau Twins. After my travels, I was set on learning to play acoustic guitar – not relying on pedals – and so I started listening to Leonard Cohen and country music from the 60s, like Gram Parsons, Hank Williams and Townes van Zandt.\n\nThat was a huge turning point for me, and it set me off on a journey of playing country music and folk music for pretty much the following decade. This has been a really important part of my musical development. Feeling like a crap musician because I couldn’t play a song for people on my travels was the moment that caused a big change in my mindset. I’d never really thought about music as entertainment – I just played with the band and didn’t particularly think about the audience. This taught me that music is something to share.\n\nSlowdive’s Everything Is Alive is out now via Dead Oceans"
