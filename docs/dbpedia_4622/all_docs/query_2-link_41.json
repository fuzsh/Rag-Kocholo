        "text": "Hello all..I'm new to the forum after a long time lurking. I'm wondering what peoples thoughts are on how to achieve a showgaze sound (My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Slowdive, etc.) in terms of the mixing and recording process. I've got a lot of time on my hands for the next few weeks, and I plan on putting together a record with my multitracker (which I'll record every instrument with). What are peoples thoughts on where to put each instrument in the mix, effects, etc? I could definetely use some help with this, as I'm musically inclined but am a bit of a beginner when it comes to the recording process. I really want a full, shimmering sound in the same vein as slowdive's souvlaki...any tips?\n\nLots and lots of guitar tracks.\n\nLots of sustain.\n\nOverdriven to the point of saturation ... but nothing at all like a \"metal\" overdrive. Think smooth power tube drive / saturation.\n\nA lot of that type of distortion goes beyond typical tube distortion and in to all-out speaker breakup ... which, at lower volumes actually sounds more like a smooth, harmonic-rich fuzz. You really have to crank the amp up loud in order to get this. If this is the type of sound you're going for ... then you might go through a few amps in the process. And your neighbors might not like you too well.\n\nThe My Bloody Valentine sound is really a combo of the speaker breakup, overdrive / sustain, and definitely a lot of open-tuning. I believe he also did something fuky with his tremolo pedal.\n\nIf you want to get some different variants on this type of sound ... then there are some pedals you could try, but ultimately they're not going to be \"authentic.\" Fuzz pedals can sort of mimick that basic kind of texture, but you're not going to sound like My Bloody Valentine by using a fuzz pedal.\n\nAs far as mixing techniques ... there really isn't as much to it as you might think. Just use a lot of layers and pan / spread things out in the stereo field. Other than that ... just experiment. See what you can come up with. I don't think any of these bands you mention used any sort of cookie cutter approach.\n\n."
