        "text": "Big shoegaze fan here, besides the usual giants like MBV Slowdive etc I also really love the instrumental side of shoegaze pioneered by Loveliescrushing, Babybreath is amongst my favorite shoegaze tracks of all time\n\nanother instrumental shoegaze favorite is the first Belong album, and anything by Jefre-Cantu Ledesma, and obv Grouper/Liz Harris(if its that drenched in reverb it can only be shoegaze, right? )\n\nbtw, since this is a gear-forum, let me leave this here to fire up some GAS, the Keeley MBV/Slowdive tribute pedal with those classic reverb-presets like bloom reverse and soft focus, paired with a jazzmaster tremelo simulator and a BIG muff!\n\nhttps://robertkeeley.com/products/loomer\n\nOh and let’s not forget Flying Saucer Attack!\n\nor his cover of the drowners\n\nI think I put Labradford in the same stack back then, bit pastoral for shoegaze but it really fit the mood. And then there are the discussion-points, Spacemen 3? Spiritualized? And what to do with the Happy Mondays and The Stone roses?\n\nAnd the eternal argument here in this household, Isn’t anything or Loveless? Can easily fill multiple evenings of banter with that one.\n\nLush! Their earlier releases are timeless gems.\n\nI see no real point in differentiating between space rock and shoegaze.\n\nThe only difference is that one lot sound like they’re singing about love and feelings and stuff and the other lot sound like they’re singing about drugs.\n\nIts all about the reverb! More wet more shoegaze!\n\nmaybe reverb is just sonic drugs\n\nit’s definitely Loveless\n\nI like them a lot better than Garbage personally, and they were around a few years before Garbage came around. I always suspected they were the inspiration for Garbage, but that’s totally my own opinion with zero to back it up.\n\nAnyway they’re a great band and their releases are all a little different; their first album is much closer to traditional shoegaze and they get more and more electronic each album. I find their later releases a little bit or miss but I love their first couple of albums.\n\nAlso Dean Garcia made some music with his daughter as SPC ECO, which is also pretty good but more traditional shoegaze/dream pop.\n\nFirst half isn’t recognisably shoegaze but the way the second half breaks through has always struck me as very shoegaze-y. Great song anyway\n\n…aaargh this british music press, that always felt the desperate need to name and pump the next big thing…\n\nreally got desperate once they saw the first bands showing up in total denial of all showbiz rules, too introverted and too focused on their pedalboards, staring always down instead to face the aufience…\n\nand that the term “shoegaze” they came up with, would soon define a whole genre, even swapping some style into other genres…who would have guessed so…\n\nwhen the “big” names of this genre had their days, i was into sisters of mercy, i’m afraid…\n\nbut hey, they were also kind of shy and staring down most of the time…\n\naaaand they always used a drum machine…\n\nnamed their “drummer” always dr. avalanche in their linernotes…\n\nWell, in that case, I submit Hum and Failure for your enjoyment.\n\nhttps://humband.bandcamp.com/album/inlet\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXvthgkZ2yQ\n\nI see your pancake, and I raise you a japancake:\n\nalso this:\n\n.\n\nGotta give a shoutout to former local act Screen Vinyl Image, which welded shoegaze guitar sounds to groovebox-driven beats in their distinctive fashion. They also supported shoegaze music in this region by booking touring acts for shows in the area.\n\nOne more band I’ve really liked a lot, and one of the bands I’ve probably seen play live the most, A Place To Bury Strangers led by Oliver Ackermann from the pedal company Death By Audio.\n\nPretty sure I was at one of the shows in the first video, in the basement of The Delancey in NYC.\n\nShoegaze is one of my favourite genres, and Lush are right up there (was happy to catch them at Lolapalooza 2!).\n\nHere is one of my faves by them\n\nCheck out the Boo Radleys, Ride, Bedhead, I love shoegaze! Some favourites:\n\nAnd of course you’ll get a ton of MBV suggestions when asking about shoegaze. The Loveless album is a classic of the genre. I think this is the catchiest of the lot.\n\nLate 80s - early 90s style of indie rock from the British Isles. Kind of a mixture of ethereal post punk / goth, the dark side of psychedelia and Sonic Youth or Dinosaur Jr. style guitar excess. Naturally bands went from one extreme to the other, with some embracing the guitar excess fully (Ride, MBV, Swervedriver) and some sounding closer to The Cure, Cocteau Twins and Pink Floyd (Slowdive, Lush). The style died quickly thanks to trends shifting rapidly towards brit pop, with shoegaze bands following suit and releasing a bunch of boring dad rock and then splitting up.\n\nResurgence started in the 00’s, in the US and Japan mostly. Nowadays shoegaze, meaning distorted guitar with lots of effects has influenced everything from metal to electronic music and there’s a bunch of pretty good throw back bands.\n\nRecommended listening:\n\nMy Bloody Valentine - Loveless\n\nSlowdive - Souvlaki\n\nRide - Nowhere\n\nSwervedriver - Raise\n\nCatherine Wheel - Ferment\n\nNothing - Tired of Tomorrow\n\nJesu - Conqueror\n\nYou wouldn’t really call something like Swervedriver space rock at all, or Catherine Wheel. I don’t know if there’s anything really spacey with MBV either. Elements of space rock, meaning the Pink Floyd style can be heard in the shoegazing sound but I don’t think the bands were going for a spacey vibe at all, or at least I can’t hear it.\n\nThe distinction between dream pop and shoegaze however…"
