        "text": "In certain contexts, a decade may not be a long time.\n\nBut in the crazy, contemporary world of pop music where artists literally singing from their bedroom could attain instant superstardom with a little help from people who loved their song enough to make it go viral, ten years can be too long a time to be spending in certain corners of the internet where only those hopelessly addicted to music(like me) languish.\n\nThis is especially true if you are the Chicago, Illinois(USA) based alternative rock band, Ratboys.\n\nFor they make music so good that it makes you believe that the phrase ‘knocking your socks off’ may have actual meaning, after all.\n\nThere’s no reason why this band shouldn’t be more widely appreciated.\n\nThe band- comprising of Julia Steiner(vocals and guitar) and David Sagan(guitar)- started in 2009.\n\nIn the ten plus years of their existence so far, they have produced 3 Eps and 3 full length albums (including ‘Printers Devil’ which will be out this Feb 28 with three songs already doing the rounds online.)\n\nThe material they have produced so far is proof enough of their craftsmanship and the earnest passion with which they seem to approach their music.\n\nAlternative rock is a curious musical genre.\n\nGenerally, anything that doesn’t pertain to the classic rock milieu but which still sounds rock enough is pushed into this category. Indie rock- which is considered a distinct rock genre- can be viewed as an offshoot of alt rock.\n\nTypically, indie rock sounds lighter than ‘pure’ alternative rock albums. In that sense, Ratboys falls somewhere in between, as their sound keeps varying from the lilting guitar strums of your expected indie style and screeching riffs that addresses the heavier forms of alternative music like grunge.\n\nIn fact, at times, the band even veer to punk territory with dangerously high pitched vocals and drum notes that don’t so much try to find a rhythm as they seek to destroy the percussion pad itself.\n\nBut what their music doesn’t do is try and construct any sound different from the norm.\n\nYou know where this music is coming from- from three decades odd linage of rock trying to survive the march of music in forms other than itself- like disco and hip-hop — only to come out the other end sounding much like rock and yet different enough to earn the descriptor of ‘Alternative.’\n\nRatboys embrace this inherent dichotomy of alternative rock by which it’s seen as rock and not pure rock at the same time- to talk about intimate things, like the beauty in loving one’s family and the simple escape that rock n’roll offers from the stress of life.\n\nPerhaps it’s this earnest intimacy which makes their songs so endearing. Or maybe it’s the band’s compositional chops that help them sound fresh even though their sound is decisively rooted in classic alternative rock(take that, classic rock puritans!).\n\nWhatever the reason, this is music that actually makes your heart swell, the kind of compositions that remind you why you became a rock music lover in the first place.\n\nBecause it’s friendly.\n\nBecause it provides auditory companionship.\n\nBecause, sometimes, a time out with well-crafted music can be a meaningful part of your day."
