I think the shoegazer genre needs to be revisited ASAP. After all - the genre was a huge influence for Achtung.\n\nSouvlaki is definitely a very enjoyable record, one of the 3 of the \"Holy Shoegaze Trinity\" in my opinion (the other two obviously being MBV's Loveless and Ride's Nowhere).\n\nThere are still a number of decent groups out there making shoegaze/dreampop, but I doubt it will ever get very popular again. I can give you some recommendations in you're interested.\n\nI'm always interested in new bands.\n\nI doubt shoegaze/dream pop will come back the way it was in the early 90's, but it would love to hear a newer/fresher version of it.\n\nThe reason I think Slowdive is so awesome is that underneath the layers is actual, great songwriting. Mojave 3 proves this.\n\nLoveless is still my most listened to album after AB. I hear something new every time I hear it...15 years later.\n\njkayet said:\n\nneil halstead & slowdive\n\nlove them. seeing mojave 3 soon - very excited!\n\nThey are on tour? I'd love to seem them. I'll have to do some research.\n\nzonelistener said:\n\nI've been waiting for jkayet to post!\n\nI was lucky to see them in 1991. Amazing.\n\nWith Ride??!!\n\nIf it was, I may become frighteningly jealous.\n\nI'm really disappointed that Mojave3 never really tour the UK apart from London, Brighton, and a couple of cities in the Midlands.\n\nAnyway, Melon posted a link a couple of years ago to some rare Slowdive tracks: http://forum.interference.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=93847\n\nA recent Creation-esque band is Bolywool from Sweden (I don't think I have a discussion about music these days without mentioning Swedish artists....): http://www.myspace.com/bolywool\n\nu2popmofo said:\n\nWith Ride??!!\n\nIf it was, I may become frighteningly jealous.\n\nyup. You have some pretty amazing shows on me though. we can trade jealousy barbs. I heard they are nice gals."
