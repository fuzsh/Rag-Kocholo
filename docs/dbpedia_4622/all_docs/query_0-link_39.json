        "text": "Souvlaki is the second studio album by British rock band Slowdive, originally released in June 1993 via Creation Records.\n\nSlowdive are an English rock band that formed in Reading, Berkshire in 1989. The band consists of Rachel Goswell on vocals and guitar, Simon Scott on drums, Neil Halstead on vocals and guitar, Nick Chaplin on bass and Christian Savill on guitar. Several other drummers also briefly played with the band, including Adrian Sell, Neil Carter and Ian McCutcheon. Halstead is the band's primary songwriter.\n\nGoswell and Halstead had known each other since early childhood in Reading, Berkshire. Scott left in 1994 and when Savill and Chaplin left the band soon after the release of Pygmalion, the remaining members renamed the band Mojave 3. Slowdive reunited in 2014.\n\nTheir sound has been described as dream pop, shoegaze, indie rock and ambient, and they are regarded as one of the key shoegaze bands that emerged in the UK from the late 1980s.\n\nSouvlaki is Slowdive's second studio album, originally released in 1993. It is considered one of the best Shoegaze albums of all time but didn't receive much credit at the time of its initial release.\n\nThe album contains synthesizer contributions from Brian Eno on \"Sing\" (which he co-wrote) and \"Here She Comes\".\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Jack Rabid described the album as \"quiet, moving, and aggressive simultaneously, mixing trance-like beauty with the deepest delayed guitar sounds around, a sound at once relaxing, soothing, and exciting, and most of all harshly beautiful\".\n\nIt's just perfect in all terms, such as the wonderful tunes, captivating lyrics, and the excellent cover art."
