Slowdive will be touring across 15 countries and have 47 upcoming concerts to celebrate their recent album release, ‘Everything is Alive.’ Starting with Toronto, Canada, at Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Slowdive was formed in 1989 by two childhood best friends, Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell. They came up with the name Slowdive from a word in a dream of bass player Nick Chaplin. They both sang and played guitar together since they were six years old. Slowdive plays a broad genre of music, from folk-rock to ambient techno music. The band likes to use a significant amount of guitar in their music and funeral tempos, as well as some vocals. The band’s music fits with what they say in British “shoegazing,” where they use heavy use of effects of pedals. Slowdive started with their debut album ‘Just for a Day’ which was released in 1991; since then, Slowdive has released over five studio albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays, five singles, and four music videos.\n\nThe band did take a twenty-year hiatus after releasing their album Pygmalion in 1995. They took a break due to some band members leaving, but they returned together in 2017 for a self-titled album. Their much recent album just came out on September 1, 2023. Don’t miss out on seeing this excellent band play in Chicago on October 3rd at The Riviera Theatre; get your tickets on Ticketmaster.com or on their website.\n\nTour dates\n\nSeptember 23: Toronto, ON – Queen Elizabeth Theatre\n\nSeptember 25: Boston, MA – Citizens House of Blues Boston\n\nSeptember 27: NYC, NY – Webster Hall\n\nSeptember 28: NYC, NY – Webster Hall\n\nSeptember 29: Philadelphia, PA – Union Transfer\n\nSeptember 30: Washington, DC – 9:30 Club\n\nOctober 2: Cleveland, OH – The Roxy @ Mahall’s\n\nOctober 3: Chicago, IL – Riviera Theatre\n\nOctober 4: St. Paul, MN – Palace Theatre\n\nOctober 6: Denver, CO – Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\nOctober 7: Salt Lake City, UT – The Union\n\nOctober 9: Portland, OR – Crystal Ballroom\n\nOctober 10: Seattle, WA – Showbox SoDo\n\nOctober 12: San Francisco, CA – The Warfield\n\nOctober 14: Los Angeles, CA – The Bellwether\n\nOctober 15: Los Angeles, CA – The Bellwether – ADDITIONAL DATE\n\nOct 30 – Glasgow, UK – QMU\n\nOct 31 – Manchester, UK – 02 Ritz\n\nNov 1 – Bristol, UK – SWX\n\nNov 3 – London, UK – The Troxy\n\nNov 5 – Belfast, UK – Mandela Hall\n\nNov 6 – Dublin, Eire – National Stadium\n\nTue.
