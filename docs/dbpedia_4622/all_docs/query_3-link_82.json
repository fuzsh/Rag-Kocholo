        "text": "No, IRL it’s The Clash. Nonetheless, power pop–it’s so wonderful! What’s the best part? The pop? It…sort of better be the pop because I like the Raspberries and, let’s be frank, the amount of “power” involved is limited. If I had to pick one power pop song that was my favorite ever, I would–I would first declare all Big Star songs off limits so they wouldn’t occupy all the top spots, but it would be “Jesus Christ”, and, well, it should oughta be The Flamin’Groovies'”Shake Some Action,” right?\n\nBut screw it, and forget the thing I implied .04 seconds ago in writing this post, because it’s really by Zion, Illnois’ finest, Shoes:\n\nOh but Belle, what is this mysterious power pop of which you speak? Is it a bunch of lame white bands from the late 70s and early 80s? No. It is a bunch of lame completely awesome white bands from the late 70s and early 80s. (There were some black power pop-style musicians I know nothing about, prolly. Tell me about them, edumacated readers.) Yeah, Americans liked the Beatles, but it took them years to get even the most basic grasp on the thing, during which they sounded like Badfinger, and then new wave started happening, which pushed people into a different confused direction. With the result that, amazing things happened, as above. See also:\n\n“Yellow Pills” is 20/20‘s biggest hit, and was the name of a zine in the 90s, and eventually a series of compilations that had both old material and new songs by forgotten bands. It was also the name of dexamphetamine, but the band didn’t really play a big role there. My (other) favorite song of their is “The Night I Heard a Scream,” a poignant ballad about a hit-and-run accident. POIGNIANT I SAY.\n\nNow, as it happens, it is the middle of the night, and I am tired, and so I will simply leave you some wonderful music to consider and then tomorrow when I post again we can discuss things like, “hang on, is Cheap Trick power pop then or what?” [SPOILER ALERT: SOMETIMES]\n\nThe Flashcubes, from Syracuse, NY, never went anywhere after their 1978/79 songs (until some 90s rediscovery thing) but were cool. Here’s “Christi Girl.”\n\nThe Three O’Clock were, John argues, more properly some kind of LA Paisley Underground something something–look, a real video from MTV! For “Jet Fighter!”\n\nThe Names want to know “Why Can’t It Be.”\n\nObviously The Spongetones is one of the worst band names ever. “Better Take It Easy” is good, though.\n\nI like to think that I have really hit my stride here, at last, and no one at all will like any of the music, for various incompatible reasons. However, I predict that godoggo, mcmanus-sensei and I will have the greatest number of humorous yellow-pill-related anecdotes. (The adults in my family all had really complaisant MDs for whatever reason, it seemed.)"
