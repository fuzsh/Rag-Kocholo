        "text": "Long dismissed as unwelcome, middle-class bores and shoegaze’s second-best band, the 90s returnees continue their stunning comeback with an album full of confidence that refuses to look back to the past\n\n★★★★★\n\nSlowdive’s 2014 comeback felt like a major vindication. For much of their career during their 90s heyday, they existed in the shadow of shoegaze’s outright pioneers My Bloody Valentine, the recipients of loudly proclaimed vitriol and derision: one reviewer at the time famously remarked that he’d rather have porridge funnelled into his ears than listen to them. Some of that snark and disdain looks woefully dated and misfiring now: it is deeply amusing to read the 90s indie music press lay into the Reading quintet for being stiflingly middle-class, as though Ride or the Catherine Wheel, or early-90s British alt-rock in general, were staffed by rough, urban outsiders from life’s margins; perhaps they simply had the misfortune of arriving at the exact moment that working-class bands like Oasis and Pulp delivered the genre a rousing shot in the arm. At any rate, Slowdive’s actual music couldn’t be more contemporary 33 years on.\n\nThree years after they reformed and capably did the touring circuit, they delivered a fantastic self-titled album that made perfect sense in 2017. It wasn’t just that the songs were great, which they were, or that Slowdive’s influence is, by now, pretty ubiquitous – you hear echoes of them all over rock music, from Beabadoobee to Jaws to Cigarettes After Sex to Bdrmm to the first five years of US label Captured Tracks’s entire output – but a prosaic and overlooked fact about the band that everyone seems too embarrassed to admit: if nobody, let alone Slowdive, was ever going to steal My Bloody Valentine’s thunder, then being shoegaze’s second-best band more or less makes you chief bridesmaid. Essentially, with Kevin Shields’s outfit piercing boldly into the unknown, Slowdive were the greatest band of their peers: after all, who remembers Chapterhouse? In those circumstances, Slowdive the album could’ve been a debut: packed with tunes, sweeping, dynamic and – as anyone familiar with Pygmalion, the final Slowdive record before their split in 1995, knows – far more risk-taking than the NME circa 1992 would have you believe.\n\nThe task for its follow-up Everything Is Alive therefore is to continue that momentum. In some respects, actually, due to their lowly reception the first time around, Slowdive feel amazingly less like a heritage rock act joylessly coming up with new material to pepper their sets on the reunion-tour circuit than a hot young band on their eagerly awaited second album. Of course, the pandemic slowed down that momentum, but Everything Is Alive is perpetually buoyed by a real, palpably felt confidence. You certainly don’t write brazen, effortless pop songs like Kisses if you’re feeling shy and self-effacing. With sharp focus on the drums, sounding beefy and crisp in the mix, leaving all the smeared reverb effects on the spellbinding guitars, it’s propulsive and fantastic, not a scratch of self- doubt or second-guessing awkwardness about it. They sound like a band who’ve decisively abandoned a tame, amenable, happy-to-be-here gratitude; it’s not that you sense they’ve something to prove so much as they’ve developed a bloodyminded determination to crack on as if no one’s paying attention.\n\nAs a result, Everything Is Alive goes places they haven’t previously. Shanty heads forcefully into psychedelia, something they have done before, but this time around they’ve ditched the attempts to conjure up a patina of hazy, stoned lightheadedness redolent of the genre’s 60s origins, instead imagining the psychedelia of the future: there’s a modest touch of the migratory, Tangerine Dream-y end of 70s krautrock, but the precise, carefully arpeggiated melodies really suggest the work of Gwenno or Jane Weaver, albeit more grandiose and windswept. Prayer Remembered proves they could easily navigate a very convincing route into epic post-rock. You could point to the fact that the album grew out of Halstead’s solo experiments with ambient sounds and minimalist electronics as evidence of the quintet’s desire to innovate, the results of which clearly influencing Chained to a Cloud. But before you start anticipating Halstead’s approximation of Basic Channel’s entire musical output, it’s important to have perspective.\n\nThere are undoubtedly far less muted or polite applications of minimalist electronics than Chained to a Cloud’s synth-driven lilt, though few perhaps in possession of quite so lovely a melody. Skin In the Game, likewise, is the kind of song to fall in love with or simply never grow tired of hearing. Over rolling bass and gauzy walls of muffled guitar, every minute yields another beautiful melody, its beauty undimmed even in its weirder moments: there’s an eerie, shimmering, ultimately ghostlike effect on Neil Halstead’s vocal during the chorus, which happens to be the track’s loveliest moment. Even so, Everything Is Alive isn’t without wrinkles and shadows. The Slab is unlike anything they’ve ever done, even by Pygmalion’s standards: punchy and as close to aggressive as Slowdive’s ataraxic world gets, layer upon layer of imposingly nebulous sound builds until the booming drum beat piercing through the mix at the start recedes, yet remaining a lingering, threatening presence.\n\nIts melody is also the darkest Slowdive have ever written, a nod to their goth-loving roots – having obviously taken their name from the Siouxsie and the Banshees song – or, more likely, the deaths of guitarist/vocalist Rachel Goswell’s mother and drummer Simon Scott’s father in 2020, the album dedicated to the both of them. In its own way, while never as ferocious or overwhelming, it recalls Wonder 2, the drum’n’bass-inspired track that closed out My Bloody Valentine’s spectacular 2013 comeback album mbv. That’s pretty much the only time the record reminds you of something from the past, including Slowdive’s own: it’s a brilliantly immediate and contemporary rock album, in actual fact, one of the year’s best. Everything Is Alive, therefore, isn’t just another vindication in the course of this returning band’s career, one that pushes forward, but perhaps the best album to have come from it."
