        "text": "Shoegaze as a genre is somewhat curiously named, but it’s basically used to describe expansive soundscapes, featuring dreamy vocals, liberal use of reverb and delay, distorted guitars, ambient synth layers and a steady rhythm section. So, live, it’s not so much about watching the performance, it’s more of absorbing the live sound experience is fuller sound than speakers or earbuds can generate. To that end, The Eastern is splendid in all regards, including watching the ever changing background projections.\n\nShoegaze’s reigning champion played to a sold-out crowd in Atlanta, offering newer fans a generous helping of songs from their last two albums, each a masterpiece in its own way. The first of those, eponymously titled, was released in 2017, marking the band’s first release in 22 years. They played songs from each of their 90’s releases, with an emphasis on Souvlaki, generally regarded as their best by fans and critics. It’s awesome that they’re touring, an unexpected treat for fans who thought that era had passed them by. And it’s even more awesome that their most recent music is utterly beautiful.\n\nAs for the band, they play their music. There’s some feeling to it, obviously, especially low-slung bassist Nick Chaplin who occupies center stage left, anchoring the music with melodic runs that accentuate each song. Guitarists Neil Halstead and Christian Savill hang at the edges, not seeking the audience but not hiding either. That leaves singer/guitarist/keyboardist Rachel Goswell at center right as the remaining visual focus. When not singing, she’s prone to grace the audience with beautiful smiles, and who can argue with that?\n\nSyd Barrett’s “Golden Hair,” a dainty two-minute lo-fi treatment to a poem written by James Joyce, is the band’s standard closer, who stretches it out to nine minutes of sonic goodness, perhaps with a nod to post-rock, even.\n\nThere was nothing to nitpick in this performance – you got Slowdive, and you got their best.\n\nWho “warms up” an audience for a shoegaze band? Well, why not an alt-neo-goth keyboard and bass duo that has a lean toward new wave?\n\nThe duo seemingly has taken inspiration from The Queen’s Guard, not yielding an inch of emotion through the performance.\n\nThe black and white clad duo also maintain a constant movement of blue and red spotlights throughout the show, definitely a great visual experience.\n\nThe duo played a 45 minute set including:\n\nDot in the Sky\n\nOxytocin\n\nEllipsis\n\nCold Souls\n\nToo Soon to Tell\n\nNot Just a Name\n\nThe Skin and the Glove"
