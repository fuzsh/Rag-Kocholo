        "text": "Shoegaze is simultaneously the easiest and most difficult musical style to create. There are some pretty well-established calling cards–guitar effects, reverb, breathy vocals that are soft enough to push back in the mix–but it takes the right alchemy to take these elements and create something that’s more than a pleasant distraction. This is arguably why, despite the genre’s many fervent defenders and evangelists, only a handful of bands have broken away from the overall Scene That Celebrated Itself into the wider realm of music as a whole. Slowdive were arguably one of those bands from the outset, but the appreciation of their work is a relatively new phenomenon, spurred on by a generation of listeners ready to meet the band where they were at as well as an excellent reunion album released in 2017. One would forgive the band if they were to decide to make that their final statement, but if everything is alive is any indication, Slowdive are more interested in building on their legacy than resting on it.\n\nComparing everything is alive to any of Slowdive’s earlier albums feels foolish. Sonically, the album shares more with the self-titled album than with Souvlaki or Just for a Day; it particularly retains the self-titled’s more muscular sound, especially in the rhythm section. However, everything is alive is also more abstract and more willing to indulge in atmospherics. In that sense, one can hear a connection to their 1995 masterpiece Pygmalion in how everything is alive is willing to use the negative space in songs to their advantage, as they do on the slow-building instrumental “prayer remembered,” but they also expand beyond the trappings of a five-piece rock band with the incorporation of synths meshing with Neil Halstead, Rachel Goswell and Christian Savill’s guitars. What’s more, while Pygmalion often felt like Halstead’s project alone, everything is alive is very much the work of a proper band, both in how Halstead and Goswell give equal vocal contributions and in how the band’s interplay works to create the overwhelming feeling that the album creates so fully.\n\nCrucially, though, everything is alive comes with emotions that feel as big as the album sounds. However one feels about early Slowdive, one thing that’s indisputable is that they could feel somewhat muted emotionally. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; I’d argue that it created this feeling of intimacy that a lot of listeners respond to. However, everything is alive strives to feel momentous and grand, and it hits that goal with just about every note. If Slowdive had intermittent moments of pure, driving rock, everything is alive offers more that reach the same dramatic heft of Slowdive disciples M83 (as on the loop-driven “chained to a cloud”) or, in the case of “prayer remembered” and the stunning “the slab”, The Cure at their late ‘80s peak. There’s still room for those intimate moments that remain so treasured (“andalucia plays” being the most beautiful example), but the feelings of yearning and pain that have always been at the core of Slowdive’s songs and at the core of the best shoegaze material sounds appropriately massive. Thus, even when the band’s arrangements get more obtuse and the vocals become obscured by sound, everything is alive never leaves the listener feeling unmoored or alienated. The album feels welcoming; it invites you to get lost inside it and let go in a way that feels wonderfully cathartic.\n\nThe inevitable cliched take on everything is alive will be that it’s an “atmospheric” album in the way that all shoegaze-related music has been tagged as that since the early days of Cocteau Twins. And yes, the album sounds grand and swirling in the way that this sort of music is “supposed” to sound, but it’s what you do with that atmosphere that really counts. Too many middle-of-the-road shoegaze acts let the sound hang there, creating a realm of noise that can be hypnotic for a few minutes before becoming dull and lifeless over a longer span of time. You need songs and ideas beyond that sonic cloud, and in their later years, that’s something that Slowdive have in droves. One feels tempted to say that everything is alive might be their finest album (I personally still side with Pygmalion), but it is inarguably a monumental piece of work. There’s a vitality and urgency to the album that seems unequaled even in newer shoegaze acts which never ceases to be remarkable. Not only do Slowdive seem intent on continuing to build on their legacy; they may be establishing something new and greater for themselves in their second act."
