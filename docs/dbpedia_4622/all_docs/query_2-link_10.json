        "text": "Studio albums5Compilation albums3Music videos3EPs5Singles5\n\nEnglish alternative rock band Slowdive have released five studio albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays, five singles and four music videos.\n\nSlowdive were formed in Reading in late 1989 by vocalist–guitarists Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell. The duo recruited guitarist Christian Savill, bassist Nick Chaplin and drummer Adrian Sell—who left the band after they signed to Creation Records and before the release of their eponymous EP Slowdive in 1990. Released to critical acclaim from the alternative press, Slowdive was succeeded by a further two EPs, Morningrise and Holding Our Breath (1991), both of which placed in the UK Singles Chart;[2] Holding Our Breath reached number 5 on the UK Independent Singles Chart.[3] The band's debut studio album, Just for a Day, was released in September 1991 to poor reviews, due in part to the British press' growing disillusion with the shoegazing genre.[4] However, Just for a Day was a minor independent success, peaking at number 3 on the Independent Albums Chart and gaining Slowdive a significant following in the United States.[5]\n\nIn 1993, under pressure from Creation to produce a commercial-sounding album,[6] Slowdive recruited Brian Eno and began producing new material. Souvlaki was released on 1 June 1993 two weeks after the Outside Your Room EP; both received similarly negative reviews but placed in the mainstream and independent charts, with Souvlaki peaking at number 52 on the UK Albums Chart.[5][2] A follow-up EP, 5, was released in November 1993 and placed at number 87 on the UK Singles Chart, however following a tour in support of its release drummer Simon Scott left the band due to creative differences.\n\nSlowdive's third studio album, Pygmalion, was released in February 1995. Halstead had dominated the recording process, with the album only featuring minor contributions by Goswell and Ian McCutcheon, the band's new drummer.[4] Reviews for Pygmalion were more favourable than the band's preceding releases and the album peaked at number 108 in the UK Albums Chart.[2] However, Creation were unsatisfied and dropped Slowdive two weeks after its release.[4] Following Slowdive's disbandment in 1995, Halstead, Goswell and McCutcheon formed Mojave 3. The band reformed in 2014,[7] and after touring for several years, released their first new material in over two decades, Slowdive.\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, with selected chart positions Title Details Peak chart positions UK\n\n[2] AUS\n\n[8] BEL\n\n(FL)\n\n[9] GER\n\n[10] NLD\n\n[11] US\n\n[12] Just for a Day\n\nReleased: 2 September 1991 (UK)[13][better source needed]\n\nLabel: Creation (094), SBK (98074)\n\nFormat: CD, CS, LP\n\n32 — — — — — Souvlaki\n\nReleased: 1 June 1993 (UK)[14]\n\nLabel: Creation (139), SBK (88263)\n\nFormat: CD, CS, LP\n\n51 — — — 79 — Pygmalion\n\nReleased: 6 February 1995 (UK)[15][better source needed]\n\nLabel: Creation (168)\n\nFormat: CD, LP\n\n108 — — — — — Slowdive\n\nReleased: 5 May 2017\n\nLabel: Dead Oceans\n\nFormat: CD, CS, LP\n\n16 64 29 33 38 50 Everything Is Alive\n\nReleased: 1 September 2023\n\nLabel: Dead Oceans\n\nFormat: CD, CS, LP\n\n6 21 9 7 4 63 \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of compilation albums Title Details Blue Day\n\nReleased: February 1992 (UK)[16][better source needed]\n\nLabel: Creation (101)\n\nFormat: CD, LP\n\nCatch the Breeze\n\nReleased: 15 November 2004 (UK)[17]\n\nLabel: Sanctuary Midline (124)\n\nFormat: 2×CD\n\nThe Shining Breeze: The Slowdive Anthology\n\nReleased: 4 May 2010 (UK)[18][better source needed]\n\nLabel: Cherry Red (443)\n\nFormat: 2×CD\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nList of extended plays, with selected chart positions Title Details Peak chart positions UK\n\n[2] UK Indie\n\n[3] Slowdive\n\nReleased: 5 November 1990 (UK)[19]\n\nLabel: Creation (093)\n\nFormat: 12-inch vinyl, CD\n\n129 — Morningrise\n\nReleased: 18 February 1991 (UK)[20]\n\nLabel: Creation (098)\n\nFormat: 12-inch vinyl, CD\n\n83 — Holding Our Breath\n\nReleased: 3 June 1991 (UK)[21]\n\nLabel: Creation (112)\n\nFormat: 12-inch vinyl, CD\n\n52 5 Outside Your Room\n\nReleased: 17 May 1993 (UK)[22]\n\nLabel: Creation (119)\n\nFormat: 12-inch vinyl, CD\n\n69 7 5\n\nReleased: 22 November 1993 (UK)[23]\n\nLabel: Creation (157)\n\nFormat: 12-inch vinyl, CD\n\n87 10 \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles, with selected chart positions Single Year Peak Album UK\n\n[2] \"Catch the Breeze\" 1991 52 Just for a Day \"Beach Song\" 1992 — Non-album single \"Alison\" 1994 — Souvlaki \"Star Roving\" 2017 — Slowdive \"Sugar for the Pill\" — \"No Longer Making Time\" — \"Don't Know Why\" — \"Kisses\" 2023 — Everything Is Alive \"Skin in the Game\" — \"The Slab\" — \"Alife\" — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nPromotional singles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of promotional singles Title Year Album \"She Calls\"/\"Leave Them All Behind\"\n\n(Slowdive/Ride) 1992 Just for a Day/Going Blank Again\n\nOther charted songs\n\n[edit]\n\nList of other charted songs, with selected chart positions Title Year Peak Album NZ\n\nHot\n\n[24] \"Shanty\" 2023 40 Everything Is Alive\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nList of music videos Title Year Director(s) Ref. \"Morningrise\" 1991 — — \"Shine\" — — \"Poetic Frenzy\" — — \"Catch the Breeze\" — — \"The Ballad of Sister Sue\" — — \"Alison\" (UK version) 1993 Mike Mason — \"Alison\" (US version) 1994 \"Star Roving\" 2017 Nathan David Smith — \"Don't Know Why\" 2017 Grant Singer \"kisses\" 2023 Noel Paul —\n\nMiscellaneous appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nList of appearances on compilation albums and soundtracks Song(s) Year Album Notes Ref \"Shine\" 1991 Sorted, Snorted and Sported Originally released on Holding Our Breath and Just for a Day.
