        "text": "According to the all-seeing-eye/ hive-mind that is wikipedia “Shoegaze is a subgenre of indie and alternative rock characterized by its ethereal mixture of obscured vocals, guitar distortion and effects, feedback, and overwhelming volume.” Nice try, particularly if you are describing the heavier MBV/ Swervedriver/ Ride/ Catherine Wheel etc. end. But the “feedback and overwhelming volume” is often missing from the best examples of the genre, like Lush, Slowdive, Pale Saints, Ozean and, well Christchurch, NZ practitioner of the art, T.G. Shand as demonstrated here on “Cinnamon” from last year’s EP of that name.\n\nPerhaps T.G. Shand blurs the line between ‘shoegaze’ and dream-pop in a similar way to Cocteau Twins by creating dream-gaze or gaze-pop. Or maybe it’s just, you know, music and we should just enjoy it and soak in the pools of reverb and chorus guitars and not try to analyze and overthink it too much (sorry). OK. Let’s just do that…\n\nStep into this time machine courtesy of Ozean and find yourself in 1991… but in the San Francisco Bay area of California rather than England.\n\nThese three songs by Californian band Ozean date from 1991, the same year Slowdive’s first album “Just For A Day” was released. This fascinating interview shows there was more than just a musical connection between the bands at the time.\n\nThe first two songs here feature basslines and drums which are classic Cocteau Twins while the guitar miasma is a perfect echo of the sound of early Slowdive.\n\nLisa Baer’s vocals are closer to Rachel Goswell’s ephemeral wonder in Slowdive than Liz Fraser’s distinctive and exotic vocals in The Cocteau Twins, yet the atmosphere created on these songs is a perfect distillation of the essence of both bands in their early prime. It’s all the more wonderful when you read that she comes from a non-rock background and is actually more influenced by Astrud Gilberto, which makes sense.\n\nThese three wonderful songs – long lost and forgotten about after a cassette release in 1993 – have been mastered from a cassette tape and that sonic patina from tape compression and drop-outs just adds to the character.\n\nThe Bandcamp release from Ozean is to raise the money for a vinyl release. Sounds like a worthwhile investment to me. It’s an interesting and very worthy side note to an era in music that didn’t last much longer that Ozean did.\n\n[Note June 2017: now the vinyl has been released the embed up above is now to the label page for the EP and the song.]\n\n[Thanks to The Autumn Roses for the tip-off]"
