        "text": "Shoegazing was the genre of music that came out of the U.K. in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. A sub-genre of indie/alternative music, it is known for it’s attempts to create a ‘cathedral of sound’. It gained it’s name due to the fact members of shoegazing bands tended to stand motionless whilst playing there instruments and, thus, were gazing at their shoes. There has since been a resurgence of this type of music known as ‘nu-gaze’. I am an admirer of shoegazing, I think it is unique in it’s style and ambitions, and I’d like to share my love of the genre with you. If you need a starting point for listening to shoegazing bands, then here are my favourite top 10 (in no particular order):\n\nRide\n\nStraight out of Oxford, a place that has also gifted us Radiohead and Supergrass, Ride formed in 1988 and lasted until 1996. They reformed in 2014 and are still going strong to this day. Their guitarist, Andy Bell, is also known for his work with Hurricane #1 and Oasis. ‘Leave Them All Behind’ was their biggest hit in 1992 reaching number 9 on the UK charts. Other classic tunes worth checking out include ‘Vapour Trail’, ‘OX4’ and ‘Dreams Burn Down’.\n\n2. My Bloody Valentine\n\nFormed in Dublin in 1983, the main protagonists of this band are Kevin Shields, also known for his work with Primal Scream, and Bliinda Butcher. Their 1991 masterpiece ‘Loveless’ is, perhaps, considered the epitome and gold standard of shoegazing. They reformed in 2013 and are continuing to work to this day. The song I can never get enough of is ‘When You Sleep’, that riff with the voices mixed in is unforgettable once heard.\n\n3. Slowdive\n\nSlowdive were formed in 1994 in Reading and only lasted until 1995. Most of the members then formed Mojave 3, who, whilst having nothing to do with shoegazing, did release a very good tune ‘Return to Sender’. Anyway, back to Slowdive. The quintessential song from them is the eponymously named ‘Slowdive’. A beautiful sounding song.\n\n4. Lush\n\nLush are a very interesting one, because to a lot of people they are only known for their brief stint in the spotlight of Britpop, with songs like ‘Single Girl’ and ‘Ladykillers’. Yet before that, they had a whole different life as a perennial shoegazing band. Formed in London in 1987, they split after the sad death of their drummer, following that Britpop revival. Check out the likes of ‘Sweetness and Light’ and ‘Hypocrite’ to hear them sounding more like a cathedral of sound, rather than a Britpop also-ran.\n\n5. Chapterhouse\n\nAnother band from Reading. Who knew the Thames Valley would be the epicentre of Shoegazing? Chapterhouse formed in 1987 and broke up in 1994. Listen to the likes of ‘Falling Down’, ‘Breather’ and ‘Autosleeper’ for examples of their finest efforts.\n\n6. Swervedriver\n\nAnother Thames Valley product, Swervedriver formed in Oxford in 1989 and called it a day in 1998. Although they have recently released an album and have toured. They sometimes get missed out of shoegazing lists because of some of their rockier releases, but just listen to the mighty ‘Duel’, a layered masterpiece that couldn’t get any more shoegaze if it tried. A song I could listen to again and again. ‘The Birds’ is a good tune as well.\n\n7. Catherine Wheel\n\nMade up from residents of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft (hurrah, no Thames Valley people for once!), Catherine Wheel (I mean, the name alone screams shoegazing band doesn’t it?) formed in 1990 and lasted until 2000. Songs like ‘Shallow’ show off their cathedral-esque credentials. I must also mention ‘Judy Stares at the Sun’ as well, because although not really shoegazing, it features the vocals of Tanya Donelley, she of ‘Belly’ fame, whom I adore and will always find any excuse to promote and mention her.\n\n8. Thee Oh Sees\n\nI might be stretching it to say that ‘Thee Oh Sees’ are ‘nu-gaze’ due to some of their more rockier numbers. But there’s no doubting that the sound of their intricate guitar interplay and building of atmosphere lend themselves to the genre. They were formed in San Francisco in 1997 and are mainly an outlet for the creativity of John Dwyer. If you don’t believe they should be in the list, then just listen to those songs that include the vocals of Brigid Dawson, particularly ‘ No Spell’, and tell me that’s not shoegazing.\n\n9. The Smashing Pumpkins\n\n“Okay, he’s really clutching at straws now” I can hear you saying. But, no, think about it. I don’t mean those rockier hard-edged songs, or the later electronic stuff. I mean, those early songs like ‘Rhinoceros’ and ‘Cherub Rock’. Listen to those and tell me Billy Corgan didn’t do as much shoegazing as he did navel gazing.\n\n10. The Zephrys.\n\nTwo brothers from Edinburgh, Scotland, David and Scott Nichol, who used the band name their dad had once used many years earlier. Although I am shoehorning these a bit into shoegazing, as there is as much claim that they belong to folk or indie-rock as shoegazing, it is the songs that used the vocals of Rachel Goswell (who also gave vocals to Mojave 3) that particularly shout, or rather coyly sing to me, “shoegazing”. Listen to ‘Setting Sun’ and it could be ‘My Bloody Valentine’ minus all the feedback."
