(Sarcasm much?) Last week, the popular Irish band U2 announced their new long playing album ‘Songs of Innocence.’ They did so by announcing Oprah-style that everybody should look...\n\nOctober3This vampire famously sucked blood to live forever, whereas this album is by a band that many people think just sucks and won't die.\n\nWhat is Phish?\n\nI don't think they suck, but lotsa people do.\n\nAnd it's possible they won't die.\n\nUnnecessary factoid - Stash was my first favorite Phish song.\n\nUnnecessary story related to the factoid: A friend and I were at a frat party in Ann Arbor that we had little interest in. We stepped outside to smoke and heard Stash playing at a really loud volume from a stereo outside somewhere . It sounded so good. So we tracked it down and there was a small party on a deck a few houses down. But they were DICKS. We just wanted to join them, spark a doob, listed to my new favorite song. But we left. Anyway, undeterred, I went on to really love this band for a spell. I went to a dozen shows or so. I'm not as into them now, and yet I've been collecting favorite records on vinyl. I think I should search for Billy Breathes next, I think that's the last album I was into."
