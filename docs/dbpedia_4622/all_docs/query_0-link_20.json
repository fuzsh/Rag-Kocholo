        "text": "Shoegaze royalty: Slowdive defy aging with a cocktail of nostalgic artistry, sonic soundscapes and familial hope in their new record – ‘everything is alive’.\n\nSlowdive, amongst the founders of shoegaze, have re-emerged with their fifth studio album, ‘everything is alive’, and it's a triumphant soliloquy to their enduring musical prowess. In this sonorous odyssey, the band effortlessly melds the familiar with the fresh, providing an ethereal journey that defies the boundaries of time and genre.\n\nThere's an undeniable sense of familial energy that permeates \"everything is alive,\" an album dedicated to the memories of Rachel Goswell's mother and Neil Halstead's father, both of whom passed away in 2020. These personal crossroads have left an indelible mark on Slowdive's music. The emotional depth of this album is palpable, carrying the weight of experience while maintaining a delicate balance of hope and wisdom.\n\nIn the tapestry of standout tracks that adorn this album, we find ‘shanty’ setting the stage with an arresting introduction, invoking the raw, impromptu energy of a live performance. The synth arpeggio intro, reminiscent of Portishead's ‘The Rip’, introduces a contemporary twist, and as the vocals gracefully intertwine, the track harmonises to splendid effect. The third track, ‘alife’, steps into the spotlight with a sunny riff, radiating a refreshingly modern aura that flirts with the aesthetics of contemporary indie trends. However, it veers into an almost R.E.M. inspired chorus that transports us back to the halcyon days of alternative rock's golden era. ‘andalucia plays’ seizes our attention with a captivating intro that pays homage to The Cure's ‘Disintegration’. The guitar work, adorned with delicate delay effects, summons an ambiance like that of Yo La Tengo. The ethereal spacey synth elements further elevate the track, leaving a choir of listeners to no doubt describe the track as “pretty cool” – a high praise from any shoe gaze fan believing the best was over.\n\nAll in all, \"everything is alive\" exudes a sense of nostalgia, acting reminiscent of Slowdive's earlier works and their self-titled 2017 release. The synth elements, while occasionally resembling past efforts, introduce a refreshing nuanced mix, showcasing the band's desire to experiment while staying true to their roots. The years may have left their mark on the band's voices, but the layers of reverb artfully mask any imperfections. This is a hallmark of the shoegaze genre, and Slowdive uses it to their advantage, infusing a dreamy quality into the vocals.\n\n\"everything is alive\" is a testament to Slowdive's enduring artistry. While the album may traverse well known territory, it does so with a sense of purpose and innovation. The band's willingness to explore new sonic avenues while preserving their iconic sound showcases their adaptability and commitment to their craft.\n\nLong-time fans will appreciate the nostalgia intertwined with contemporary elements, and newcomers will find themselves immersed in the mesmerising world of Slowdive. Despite the apprehension leading up to any great band’s album, \"everything is alive\" is a resounding success, proving that Slowdive remains a timeless force in the world of shoegaze. This album is not just a worthy addition to their discography; it's a declaration of their permeance."
