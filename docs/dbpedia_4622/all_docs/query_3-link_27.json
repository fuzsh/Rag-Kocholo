        "text": "I love shoegaze because it’s less a genre and more a feeling. It’s sonic dissonance, a wall of sound and distortion, but there’s melody buried somewhere in all that noise, and you can’t make out any of the lyrics, but it’s okay. The guitars and the reverb and the distortion set the mood and tone, and you don’t need to listen to what they’re saying to gage what they’re trying to convey. It makes you nostalgic for something you’ve never experienced.\n\nI’ve loved Slowdive for a long time, and I enjoyed their latest record everything is alive, but I maintain that the true way to experience shoegaze music is by going to a shoegaze show (I will have to live with the reality of possibly never seeing MBV live). Even better, go to a shoegaze show on shrooms — alone.\n\nI’d been to a shoegaze show on shrooms alone just once before, for Knifeplay and Winter at TV Eye in Ridgewood in early August, and it was so great that I was annoyed at myself for not having done it sooner. TV Eye is a very intimate venue just a few blocks from my apartment, and the sound is great. Even better, it fosters an audience of true music-lovers while maintaining an authentic DIY ethos, and I felt surrounded by a gentle crowd presence as I was on my trip. I felt safe, and among my peers. Each song felt like a journey through time and into outer space. I closed my eyes and saw colors I’d forgotten about. I was swaying along to the music, lost in the cosmic dissonance, feeling like I was absorbing every morsel of every note through my fucking pores, and suddenly felt anxious: was I the only one dancing along to the music, bobbing my head back and forth? I opened my eyes in slight panic, only to see everyone around me doing the exact same thing. I shut my eyes again and fell back into the rhythms.\n\nI also hadn’t planned to go to the Slowdive show alone. I’d originally invited my boyfriend to come with me, but he ended up not being able to go because he had a nine a.m. doctor’s appointment the next day (my boyfriend, who considers himself a punk). I invited another friend, but he told me he was seeing them the night before I was. I considered asking others before I figured I’d just go and do a solo shroom club trip there and have a transcendent experience like I did at TV Eye. What could go wrong?\n\nFirst off, the East Village is not Ridgewood. I didn’t realize how long it had been since I’d hung out in the East Village until I emerged from the L stop and had the misfortunate of being welcomed by a horrible, gigantic new KBBQ establishment whose purpose is most likely to only serve NYU kids. It was an affront to my eyes. I think a Five Napkin Burger used to be there, not that that was any better, but any self-respecting Asian would have been offended by it. My best friend from high school used to live at the Third North NYU dorm on that street, and I remember feeling envious of her life: being able to be a block away from the likes of Webster Hall, a movie theater, and everything else New York could seemingly offer. I used to go to a Liverpool bar there, Nevada Smith, which is now long gone. There is a Tacombi there that’s new, and the pricey Westside Market (bullishly advertising its new 24-hour service) is the only thing that these NYU kids will have to a bodega. I saw a few of them stumble in wearing their sweatpants and flip flops. I wondered if there were any bodegas at all left in the East Village. Who will make them a bacon egg and cheese at 10 in the morning?\n\nThe band opening for Slowdive were so awful that I thought I was going to have a panic attack and die. Watching great bands while on shrooms is the greatest feeling ever, but I am beginning to learn that watching shit bands on shrooms literally makes me want to take shots of cyanide. I’m lucky enough to have never experienced a panic attack in my life, but this was the closest I’d gotten to having one. I’d timed my shroom-taking to hit at around 9pm, when I figured Slowdive would be on, but it came over me just as I was walking from the train to Webster Hall, and even more so as I walked into the crowded ballroom floor to experience the sonic assault that was this opener. I’d find out later that they were called Drab Majesty (emphasis on Drab), and their music was just fine: reverb-soaked new wave synth-pop that only a band supporting Slowdive could create, but something about the energy of the two-person band just grated me. I saw through their whole egotistical schtick right away: their synthy '80s sound sounded so obviously derivative of their influences that it came off as disingenuous, the lead singer was straight-up copying the vocal delivery of Ian Curtis. They also wanted to be The Cure so freaking bad. I wanted to tell them that the year was 2023, not 1976, and we were in New York City not Manchester, and they were never going to be signed to Factory Records. They had a Daft Punk kind of ensemble in that the two of them were dressed in black and looked as if they had black bars as eyewear, and it just made the whole thing even more obnoxious. The more I listened to them, the more I started to sweat and found it hard to breathe. I thought I was going to keel over and pass out because they were so awful! Have you ever died of a panic attack after watching a band that was that terrible? No? Well, I almost did, from a combination of music that should be borderline illegal and being surrounded by Manhattan dudebros who have probably never crossed into Williamsburg, let alone Brooklyn. I considered going outside for some air, or even buying a bottle of water, but that would have meant that I had to wade through the sea of dudebros, and so I stayed put while on the verge of hyperventilating. (In hindsight, I wonder how much of my nausea could have been attributed to me getting an IUD inserted just last week.)\n\nAll of this was exacerbated by the fact that I was standing behind a man with a backwards baseball cap that said “DOPAMINE” on it. Clearly intent on furthering my own descent into psychological hell, I decided to look up this monstrosity of a band on Wikipedia, which is quite literally the worst thing I could have done on shrooms.\n\nPer my Notes app notes: IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE THE MORE I READ\n\nAs per their Wikipedia page:\n\n“Drab Majesty combine androgynous aesthetics and commanding vocals with futuristic and occult lyrics, a style Demure refers to as, ‘tragic wave’.” More like just plain tragic. “To create his imposing stage presence, Demure employed costumes, makeup and props to accompany his lush, '80s-influenced soundscapes.”\n\n“Clinco stated that he felt some sense of alarm while playing back the music he had recorded, claiming that it was as if another person had made it. ‘Listening back I just didn’t feel like I was listening to myself [...] It sounded like someone else’. This experience provided the inspiration for Clinco to create his alter ego, Deb Demure.” ???\n\n“His biggest influences were Mark Kozelek's Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon projects.” I should have stopped here.\n\n“Drab Majesty released their second album The Demonstration in January 2017 to favorable reviews. The Demonstration is a concept album that deals with the psychology of mass suicide, referencing in particular the ideology of Marshall Applewhite, the leader of the Heaven's Gate cult.” I can’t deal with this edgelord bullshit.\n\nI use the following analogy to describe how my mind becomes affected on shrooms: that of the vampires getting their superpowers in Twilight. I feel like I am a pretty sensitive and perceptive person when not on shrooms, so when I am on shrooms, these sensations get heightened: like what happens to those vamps in Forks. Bella does a good job of remaining emotionally detached from everyone and everything as a human, so as a vampire, she becomes immune to any mind tricks vampires might want to play on her. Thanks, Steph Meyer.\n\nI don’t think I’d have had such a visceral reaction to this band were it not for me being on shrooms. Their music is one thing; anyone can be in a synth-wave band that belongs in the UK circa 1982. But their motives for making art did not feel genuine. I did not feel like they were making music to express themselves, or to connect with anyone. I believe that their band exists purely for as a performative ego trip; to be able to say that they were able to play with Slowdive in the most narcissistic and disingenuous way possible. And this is what made me want to die. Their feigned nature came through in their music. It made me a little sad.\n\nI don’t want to get too preachy and dictate who should and shouldn’t create art. This is more of a lesson for me in the future, going forward, with watching shows on psilocybin: never do shrooms at a show in Manhattan, and don’t arrive at the venue until the headline act are literally about to start. Even if you decide to be a shit Cure rip-off band, at least allow me to never be aware of your existence.\n\nThis is all to say that Slowdive were unbelievable. It’s like listening to actual magic. I don’t know how they do it. I could agonize over their pedal rig and buy each of the same pedals and guitars and amps in an attempt to recreate their sound and fall miserably, pathetically, laughably short. Their music washed away all memory of Drab Majesty, and I allowed myself to soak up their beautiful music, a waterfall of sonic lushness, the shrooms still strong within my body. I am so thankful for Slowdive, because if it wasn’t for their wonderful set, I’d probably have been the first person to have fainted at Webster Hall simply due to a band being horrifically shit."
