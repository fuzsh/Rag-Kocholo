slowdive is an English rock band formed in Reading, Berkshire, in 1989, known for its significant contribution to the shoegaze scene of the early 1990s. Comprising members Rachel Goswell, Neil Halstead, Christian Savill, Nick Chaplin, and Simon Scott, the band debuted with the album Just for a Day in 1991, establishing themselves with Halstead’s evocative songwriting and a sound that encapsulated the ethereal essence of shoegaze. Despite mixed initial receptions, their second album, Souvlaki (1993), later emerged as a seminal work, hailed as one of the best shoegaze albums ever made. However, following the release of their third album, Pygmalion (1995), slowdive disbanded, with members pursuing other projects, most notably forming the folk-influenced Mojave 3. These were dark times with so many talented bands getting buried during the grunge phase.

Reuniting in 2014 for the Primavera Sound festival, slowdive marked their return with a self-titled album in 2017, their first in 22 years, followed by Everything Is Alive in 2023, which achieved top ten status in several countries including the UK. This remarkable comeback not only solidified their legacy but also introduced Slowdive to a new generation of listeners. Their sound, deeply rooted in dream pop and shoegaze, along with ambient influences, has been celebrated for its dreamy textures and atmospheric depth, inspiring a wide array of artists across diverse genres. Despite facing initial critical adversity, slowdive’s enduring influence and the belated recognition of Souvlaki underline their pivotal role in shaping the shoegaze genre and their lasting impact on the landscape of alternative music.
