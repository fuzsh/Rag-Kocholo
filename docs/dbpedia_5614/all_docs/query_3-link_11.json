        "text": "One of the few bankable female stars of the 1990s and 2000s, actress Julia Roberts remained an iconic figure whose assured, winsome performances underscored her undeniable public appeal. Following a breakthrough role in \"Mystic Pizza\" (1988), Roberts earned critical acclaim and award recognition for her portrayal of the ill-fated Shelby in \"Steel Magnolias\" (1989). But it was her performance as a hooker with a heart of gold opposite Richard Gere in \"Pretty Woman\" (1990) that propelled Roberts into the upper tier of Hollywood actresses. Roberts quickly became one of the highest paid stars - male or female - in the world, eventually raking in $25 million for a film. Equally in the limelight for a torrent of high-profile and often rocky romances, Roberts managed to maintain an output of projects that consistently topped the box office. While sometimes accused of lacking the chops to be a serious actress, she erased all doubts with her Oscar-winning performance in \"Erin Brockovich\" (2001), as well as other acclaimed roles in \"Eat Pray Love\" (2010), \"August: Osage County\" (2013) and \"Ben Is Back\" (2018), all of which underscored Roberts' unique ability to be both a huge box office draw and an accomplished performer."
