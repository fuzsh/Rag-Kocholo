        "text": "Most stars live near Hollywood for the convenience of getting to work, but Julia Roberts prefers life out of the spotlight in California. The Notting Hill star formerly resided in a stunning estate in the city’s Presidio Heights neighborhood with her husband, Danny Moder, and their three kids, Hazel, Phinnaeus and Henry. Just a few years after the pair first purchased the home, they decided to put the estate on the market in a shocking sale.\n\nWhere Does Julia Roberts Live?\n\nJulia and the Mexican cinematographer purchased their one-time residence, which was built in 1907 and offers incredible views of the Golden Gate Bridge, for $8.3 million in February 2020. The traditional Victorian-style house featured five bedrooms and four and a half baths across 6,245 square feet, as well as includes a total of five floors.\n\nThe Pretty Woman star and Danny’s previous abode also boasted a chef-style kitchen, several living rooms, a lavish dining area and an extra room on the top floor. In terms of luxurious amenities, the longtime lovebirds — who wed in July 2002 — also had their very own wine room, a massive garage and a beautiful backyard with a garden and patio.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points of the property was the location. Not only is the posh neighborhood known for its esteemed school system, a lively downtown area and for having access to nature, but San Francisco, in general, is filled with culture and carts.\n\nMonths after Julia and Danny put down roots in the Northern California city, a friend of the pair opened up about the exciting move. “She’s always wanted to raise her kids in a more diverse neighborhood,” the pal exclusively told Closer in June 2020. “The bustling parts of the city aren’t far away, but there’s also a huge park nearby with trails for hiking.”\n\nBecause Hazel, Phinnaeus and Henry are “growing up so fast,” the Oscar winner “wanted her children to have the experience of a city with a different energy and vibe,” the insider added, noting San Francisco was especially appealing because of low-key their lives are. “Her kids are not movie star kids in San Francisco, where no one cares who your mom is.”\n\nAround the time the Erin Brockovich actress and Danny purchased their enviable former pad in early 2020, they also let go of their home down the California coast in Malibu. The duo sold the three-bedroom, two-bathroom house for $8 million. Though the two were thrilled about adding the San Fran property to their portfolio, the friend revealed the entire situation was “bittersweet.”\n\n“She loves Malibu,” the insider shared, noting Danny was equally as fond of the “idyllic life they have on the beach.” But as time has passed, the couple have “grown tired of Hollywood,” another source told Closer. “There’s a new scene for them to explore, and although they’re both working less, it’s still less than an hour’s flight to L.A.”\n\nEven though saying goodbye to their Malibu pad was more difficult than they imagined, it seemed like the Wonder star and her spouse wouldn’t change a thing about settling down in San Francisco for a few years. “It’s a real forever home,” said the first friend. “Julia can imagine growing older with Danny there.”\n\nWhy Did Julia Roberts Sell Her Home?\n\nIn October 2023, multiple outlets reported that Julia and Danny put their San Francisco pad on the market for $11.75 million. Just a few weeks later, the house sold for around $11.25 million, per Mansion Global.\n\nMultiple sources told Closer of the motive behind Danny and Julia’s quick move.\n\n“He felt living in San Francisco was hurting his career because they were living so far from the action,” an insider told Closer in November 2023. “He was always of the belief that Julia put her career ahead of his, and he resented it but made the move just to appease Julia.”\n\nWith their two eldest kids going away to college, Julia and Danny decided to make the huge change in their lives.\n\n“Danny wanted to move back to Malibu, where he’s got the beach at his doorstep for surfing and his industry friends who give him work,” the source added. “And he was going to go whether Julia came with him or not.”\n\nMonths later, another source told Closer that Danny “missed his surfing and industry connections” prior to selling the SF pad.\n\n“But things don’t look so great now that they’ve settled back into the L.A. way of life,” the source maintained. “She’s doing her thing, he’s doing his. They’re living separate lives. They even have multiple houses and often live apart.”\n\nThe insider went on to say that Julia is “looking to pile on more work” in her career after selling the home.\n\n“They’ve been through a lot of ups and downs over the years,” the source added. “The hope is that they can find some kind of balance again between her professional and personal life. When it comes down to it, she doesn’t want her marriage to fail — nor does he.”"
