        "text": "Julia Roberts has left her heart, and her real estate, in San Francisco.\n\nThe award-winning actress recently put her classic 1912 mansion on the market, just three years after she bought the place. And in less than two weeks, a buyer called dibs on the remarkable home.\n\nThe “Pretty Woman” star purchased the stately, five-level dwelling in January 2020 for $8.3 million; then she listed it a few weeks ago for $11.75 million. Since the offer is still pending, the final price is not yet known.\n\nWhat is known is that the five-bedroom, six-bath abode is situated on a hill in San Francisco’s prestigious but low-key Presidio Heights neighborhood. The home enjoys views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the sparkling Bay, and the iconic Presidio—a national park that was once a U.S. Army base.\n\nThe elegant, 6,315-square-foot city home is almost double the size of the 3,188-square-foot lot it’s built on. Tall and narrow, the mansion takes full advantage of those remarkable vistas.\n\nRoberts’ property has been meticulously renovated, maintaining its early-1900s elegance but has been retrofitted for today. Its finer features include three grand fireplaces, coffered ceilings, stained-glass windows, a bar, gym, and a bonus room on the top level, under the eves.\n\nThe bright, airy, modern kitchen is also a highlight, with its breakfast nook and fireplace; large, marble-countertop island; double ovens, dishwashers and sinks; Sub-Zero refrigerator; wet bar; walk-in pantry; desk nook; and, perhaps most charming of all, a small balcony with a built-in barbecue overlooking the garden.\n\nThe primary suite takes up the entire third level and features an office, lounge area, seating in the bay window, a dressing room with a seating area, and a private balcony. There’s also a sunny, spacious bath with a claw-foot tub and a vanity nook.\n\nOutside, there’s an inviting deck, a zenlike spa tucked beneath the shade of an olive tree, and a manicured garden.\n\nThe two-car garage includes a workshop area, additional closets, and an extra storage room.\n\nRoberts, 55, has been married since 2002 to cinematographer Daniel Moder, with whom she has three children. She has been considered A-list talent since the 1980s. Lead roles in romantic comedies such as “Pretty Woman,” “My Best Friend’s Wedding,” and “Notting Hill” are among her best known work. Roberts has also tackled more dramatic fare, including “Eat Pray Love” and “Erin Brockovich,” which won her an Academy Award."
