        "text": "Sunday\n\nStars Prepare for 73rd Annual Academy Awards\n\nAired March 25, 2001 - 5:34 p.m. ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nSTEPHEN FRAZIER, CNN ANCHOR: Now to California, where the stars will be shining brightly tonight at the 73rd annual Academy Awards. This is the last time the ceremony will be held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Next year, the whole event moves to the Kodak Theater in Hollywood.\n\nCNN's Laurin Sydney is in L.A., joins us now with more on the movie industry's big night. End of an era for the Shrine, Laurin.\n\nLAURIN SYDNEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Big ending, and what an ending it's going to be, Stephen.\n\nAt this hour, the stars are being primped, they're being teased, fashioned and fussed with in preparation for their arrival at the 73rd annual Academy Awards. And while their preparations are under way, preparations are also continuing right here at the Shrine Auditorium for the world's biggest awards show.\n\nIn the race for best picture, a \"Crouching Tiger\" will have to leap over \"Erin Brockovich,\" \"Traffic,\" \"Chocolat,\" and \"Gladiator\" to take home the prize. But if there's a safe bet this year, it could be Julia Roberts winning best actress.\n\nSherri Sylvester talked with the star whose real-life role may produce a fairytale ending.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJULIA ROBERTS, ACTRESS: I am just a girl from Smyrna, Georgia, who wanted to be in movies and get a certain amount of attention. This is too much attention for the record.\n\nSHERRI SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This night is expected to be her night. Julia Roberts has been so honored for \"Erin Brockovich\" that winning the best actress Oscar must be her destiny, or so says the media. That (UNINTELLIGIBLE) label can be a burden.\n\nROBERTS: If that's what you think the burden that you guys bring to my life is...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... let me give you a tiny tip. No, it's no burden.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"ERIN BROCKOVICH\")\n\nROBERTS: That's my work, my sweat, my time away from my kids. If that's not personal, I don't know what is.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSYLVESTER: For her, there has been tribulation, not trial, to play such a role and then hear the real Erin say, \"You got it so right.\"\n\nROBERTS: Upon wrapping and not knowing if anybody would ever see it, know it, the way that I knew it. I was so happy. I was so -- I just thought, \"I'm done, I've had the apex of creative success.\" This is all just added joy and fulfillment.\n\nSYLVESTER: The joy and fulfillment took some time to find. Sure, her parents ran a theater workshop in Smyrna, Georgia, but that is a long way from Hollywood.\n\nROBERTS: My mom -- I was the third of her four children to say, \"I want to be an actress.\" It was like, \"OK, you know, go, fine.\" When I called her and said: \"You know, I've changed my mind. I want to come home. I'm homesick. I'm unhappy. I can't even begin to meet people to get acting work.\" And she wouldn't let me come home. So, that was really a moment. At the time I hated her for it, but I'm really grateful that she forced me to stay and prevail.\n\nSYLVESTER: \"Steel Magnolias\" brought a best supporting actress nomination, \"Pretty Woman\" a best actress nod. Julia was only 23 when she attended her second Academy Award ceremony a decade ago. The Oscar has been elusive. But this time just may be her time.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSYDNEY: And on the subject of time, we expect Julia and the other stars to begin arriving in about one hour from now, and in the 7 o'clock Eastern hour please join us for our Oscar Odyssey Special. We will be here telling you everything you've always wanted to know and more.\n\nReporting from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, I'm Laurin Sydney, and now back to you in Atlanta.\n\nFRAZIER: Laurin, you look terrific. Have a great time tonight.\n\nSYDNEY: Thank you. We will.\n\nFRAZIER: Well, if you guys just can't find -- can't wait at all to find out who will take home the Oscars tonight, our next guest has some predictions right now about who may win and what the stars will be wearing too.\n\nHeidi Parker is the executive editor of \"Movieline Magazine\" and she joins us from Los Angeles, once again, where all the action is.\n\nMs. Parker, thank you for joining us. HEIDI PARKER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, \"MOVIELINE\": Thanks for having me.\n\nFRAZIER: You mentioned right off the bat that there were some surprises in this year's nominations. Which ones?\n\nPARKER: Well, I think that no one was really sure at first what would take best picture. It was between \"Crouching Tiger\" and \"Traffic\" and \"Gladiator.\" And there's a lot of uncertainty in the best actor category, because nobody feels like Russell Crowe really is locked in to get it.\n\nFRAZIER: Well, before we go on to him, let's talk about the pictures themselves. We've got some clips we can show while we're talking. So there was no real sort of Titanic-like sure thing this time around. Is that what you're telling us?\n\nPARKER: There wasn't, and it surprised me, because \"Gladiator\" got 12 nominations, which is quite, you know, very many for that category. But no one really felt like it was a guaranteed Oscar winner, because it made so much money at the box office. It was considered more of a popcorn film. But I think now it's emerging as, you know, the next \"Ben Hur.\"\n\nFRAZIER: And is it your sense that each of the nominees this year is a valid choice, that there's no real kind of clunker?\n\nPARKER: Well, I think \"Chocolat\" is very flimsy. \"Erin Brockovich\" and \"Traffic\" are both really solid films. \"Crouching Tiger\" is more of a martial arts film in my eye, but that is also a very solid epic. And I think \"Chocolat\" is the only softy one.\n\nFRAZIER: Let's talk about your predictions in all of the other categories, because you were saying that although the films all look to be relatively strong, your last comments notwithstanding, that there are some real surprises and some real kind of offbeat choices in the other categories. Like what?\n\nPARKER: Well, I think definitely in best actor, no one really knows who should get it. People like Tom Hanks and I think he did a good job in \"Castaway,\" but do they want to give him three Oscars? It seems kind of odd. It seems like a bit much.\n\nWith Russell Crowe, I mean, he gave a great performance in \"Gladiator,\" but he's not really a loved, cuddly Hollywood character. A lot of people think he's talky, and they don't want to give it to him, even though the film has so many nominations. He should just get it.\n\nAnd then, Ed Harris was a huge surprise, because most people didn't even see \"Pollock.\" That came out of nowhere. And although his performance was good, the film wasn't very strong. So, that was another reason for the big surprise.\n\nJavier Bardem, an actor that few people have really heard of before in \"Before Night Falls.\" And so, there were just a lot of surprises in that category.\n\nFRAZIER: Well, you're kind of waffling. Who do you think is going to take that category?\n\nPARKER: I'm not waffling at all. I think it's going to be Tom Hanks, absolutely.\n\nFRAZIER: Oh, yes, all right.\n\nPARKER: I'll put my money on that one.\n\nFRAZIER: All right. You were going to put your picks up on the screen actually while we talked. What about best actress in a leading role?\n\nPARKER: Well, I think that everyone knows Julia Roberts is going to get it, because the competition is not as strong as her performance. And she also played a character that people loved. And she stretched. She wasn't playing the romantic comedy character anymore that she did in \"Runaway Bride.\" She was playing someone who was very aggressive and vulnerable and didn't just rely on a wide grin.\n\nAnd people just love her. They love her speeches when she's won at previous award shows. And they want her to have it.\n\nFRAZIER: Let's go on to the next three categories we can put up on the screen: best supporting actor, supporting actress and director. How about those categories? Your calls.\n\nPARKER: OK. Well, best supporting actress, everyone thinks Kate Hudson's going to get it because the Academy likes to give the award to the ingenue, the person who brings a really fresh performance to the screen. And Kate Hudson did that in \"Almost Famous.\"\n\nAs far as best supporting actor, there's another lock with Benicio Del Toro, because voters want to give some awards to \"Traffic.\" And it won't get best picture, so they kind of want to throw in best supporting actor. And actors really admire Benicio Del Toro. He's not a sellout. He gave a great performance. And people want to emulate him and be like him. So they'll give him the award.\n\nNow, best director -- that is something that is a little more up in the air. Should Ridley Scott get it for \"Gladiator\"? A lot of people think he deserves it for pulling together such an epic. But he's not a loved guy in this town. He gave a very cocky speech at the Golden Globes, his acceptance speech, when he won there. Because he won, people think maybe he'll get the award. But I think that a lot of voters were impressed with what Ang Lee did with \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" and they'll want to give it to him.\n\nFRAZIER: All right. We had that up on the screen. Of course, there's another category, but we're going to hold off on that for just a minute. We're going to go to a short break and come back with Heidi Parker and the rest of her predictions after this. (COMMERCIAL)\n\nFRAZIER: Well, just in front of that awning there, if you look at the bottom of your screen -- actually, just behind the word that says Academy Awards, you can see Laurin Sydney's car. It's about two blocks long. That's what she used to get to work. Just driving away now.\n\nLet's go back now to Heidi Parker, the editor of \"Movieline\" magazine. We've got one last prediction before we turn to other events in Hollywood, Heidi, and that is best foreign film, which looks like a runaway. Most people haven't seen these other nominees.\n\nPARKER: Well, I definitely think \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" will get it, because it won't get best picture. That will go to \"Gladiator.\" And voters will want to give it some sort of a major award and it will follow in the path of what \"Life Is Beautiful\" did just a few years ago and take the best foreign film instead of best picture.\n\nFRAZIER: It's up against a film from Mexico, another from the Czech Republic, a Belgium film and a French film that I don't think anybody's seen, so...\n\nPARKER: Yeah. I don't think anyone's really seen them. And more importantly, they haven't made very much money. And \"Crouching Tiger\" has made a lot of money. So voters do look at that, too. They look at box office.\n\nFRAZIER: We had fun a few minutes ago looking at how nicely Laurin Sydney was turned out, because that is a big part of all of this, isn't it, what people are wearing?\n\nPARKER: Oh, absolutely. That's why people watch the show.\n\nFRAZIER: Really.\n\nPARKER: That's -- a lot of people in this country watch the show for the clothes. Yes. And to see people who will cry and all that nonsense.\n\nFRAZIER: Oh, all right. During the awards. But it's -- so the runway walk going in. is that really as big a part of this as we're led to believe?\n\nPARKER: It gets bigger every year. And I have a feeling that this year it'll get huge because there's a lot of big stars on the red carpet. I mean, who doesn't want to see what Julia Roberts is going to wear, although she does dress rather plainly when at award shows and more conservatively. And they're going to want to check out Russell Crowe and Tom Hanks and his wife. So there's a lot of good stars to look at this year.\n\nFRAZIER: Nobody is predicted, though, to wear the sort of things that we saw at the Grammys, where they -- things were taped on.\n\nPARKER: Yeah.\n\nFRAZIER: OK.\n\nPARKER: Well, I think that people want to -- when they go to the Oscars, they want to impress mom at home. It's one of those shows. And they want to look a little more elegant.\n\nFRAZIER: All right. Well, we'll still look out for Jennifer Lopez, though, and see what she's wearing.\n\nLet's turn to the future now -- a strike looming on the horizon. What, really, is it going to do?\n\nPARKER: I think it's going to put a lot of people out of work for a while. I mean, there's been talk about, is it going to happen? Is it not going to happen? And just in the last few weeks, there's been a sea change. People really think it is going to happen. And the studios almost want it to happen, because their movies have been stockpiled for so long that, I think, that they're like just bring it on, you know, we need a break. We've done all our work. We've done all our work in advance. And it's OK if it happens.\n\nI think the writers and actors who aren't -- haven't -- don't have a lot of money saved up are worried, definitely very worried, and sort of a gloomy atmosphere out there.\n\nFRAZIER: Heidi Parker with \"Movieline\" magazine. Thanks so much for joining us and with your predictions, as well.\n\nPARKER: Thanks for having me. I hope I don't look like a fool tomorrow.\n\nFRAZIER: Oh, we'll hold you to it if you do.\n\nPARKER: Thanks.\n\nTO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
