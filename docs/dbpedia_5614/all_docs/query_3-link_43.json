        "text": "If you were disappointed when the claims about George Clooney selling his Lake Como mansion turned out to be false, we (kind of) have the next best thing. Clooney's Ticket to Paradise co-star and fellow movie star, Julia Roberts, has put her historic San Francisco house on the market.\n\nIn a TikTok by user @austin.klar, the realtor describes the home's highlights, which include views of the Golden Gate Bridge, wood-burning fireplaces, and a backyard with a private spa. The commenters are absolutely gushing about the property, one calling it a \"total dream home.\"\n\nWhat's So Special About Julia Roberts's San Fransisco Home?\n\nYou may be thinking this is just another soulless celebrity mega-mansion going up for sale, but Roberts's home is nothing like Kylie Jenner's \"cardboard doll house.\" Built in 1912, this five-story, 6,315 square-foot home has all the San Fransisco charm people have come to love. Sitting on a hill in the prestigious Presidio Heights neighborhood, the historic home boasts light green shingles, classic white window trim, and a classic brick entry. One step inside and you're met by a grand staircase and intricate architectural detail such as a coffered ceiling and wainscoting. The house is filled with storied built-ins and old-world allure, from the kitchen that's drowned in light to the dreamy breakfast nook next to one of the many fireplaces in the property. Did we mention there's a built-in barbecue on the balcony overlooking the garden and a relaxing spa under an olive tree in the backyard?\n\nWhen Did Julia Roberts Buy Her San Fransisco Home?\n\nRoberts purchased this five-story house in January of 2020 for $8.3 million, a relative bargain given that the price had dropped from a staggering $10.25 million. After owning the property for just under four years, Roberts has put it on the market.\n\nWhere is Julia Roberts's San Fransisco Home Located?\n\nThe charming house is located in San Francisco's esteemed Presidio Heights neighborhood. Sitting near the top of a hill in this desirable block, the five-bedroom, four-bathroom home has gorgeous views of the Presidio—the former U.S. Army base that is now a national park— and the San Francisco bay. Presidio Heights is a highly sought-after area with the beautiful Presidio Park bordering the neighborhood. It is known to be a quiet, luxurious location with wonderful schools and a family-friendly reputation.\n\nI Love It! What's It Going to Cost Me?"
