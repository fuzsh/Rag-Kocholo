Despite being one of the most well-known actresses of the 20th and 21st centuries, the Pretty Woman star truly values her privacy.\n\nRoberts and cameraman Daniel Moder have been married since 2002, and later welcomed three children: twins Phinnaeus Walter and Hazel Patricia, 18, and another son named Henry Daniel, 16. Even though Roberts is a mega-star, not much is known about her life outside of acting. Her children’s lives have remained quite private, and even her over 20-year marriage to Moder is shrouded in secrecy.\n\nHowever, after some internet snooping, we discovered quite a few tidbits about Roberts’ real life outside Hollywood, and it’s as cosmic as you’d imagine.\n\nFrom her all-natural kitchen setup to the unique hobbies most fans don’t know about, there’s so much to Roberts’s life outside of Hollywood. Below, check out everything we know about Roberts’ life outside of her Hollywood-based career.\n\nA version of this article was originally published on Oct 2023."
