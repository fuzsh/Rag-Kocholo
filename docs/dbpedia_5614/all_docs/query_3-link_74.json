        "text": "Synopsis\n\nJulia Roberts, at 56, discussed her youthful looks and marriage challenges with Danny Moder. Her career growth and family adjustments pose ongoing personal and professional challenges for the couple.\n\nJulia Roberts, in an interview with 'British Vogue' in January, said that she is still attractive at the age of 56. When asked about her young appearance, the Oscar winner joked that it was due to her loving spouse, Danny Moder, strong genes, and a full life. She showed her sincere satisfaction and her faith in his kindness and affection. Their 22-year marriage, however, is facing serious difficulties. Danny and Julia are at a crossroads even though they celebrated their anniversary on July 4.\n\nJulia Roberts and Danny Moder live separately\n\nDanny's desire for surfing and industry ties led them to relocate from San Francisco back to Malibu. It has been challenging to adjust to life in Los Angeles. Sometimes in different homes, they lead somewhat independent lives, as reported by Yahoo Entertainment.\n\nCurrent dynamics and career focus\n\nJulia has taken on more assignments because she is now fully committed to her job as their children—the 17-year-old Henry and the 19-year-old twins Hazel and Phinnaeus—become more self-sufficient. Her prominence in Hollywood has increased due to her recent box office hits with \"Ticket to Paradise,\" starring George Clooney, and \"Leave the World Behind,\" produced by Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nImpact on their relationship\n\nAs per the reports of Yahoo Entertainment, while Julia immerses herself in her successful profession, sources claim Danny has reconnected with his beach pals and contacts in the film industry. Finding a balance between Julia's increasing obligations at work and their changing personal life is a challenge for the pair. Despite ups and downs over the years, they both want to keep their marriage intact and go through this difficult time together.\n\nDanny and Julia are approaching an empty nest at a critical time. Their goal is to find harmony once more between Julia's thriving professional life and their bond. Both are dedicated to maintaining their marriage and getting past the difficulties they are now facing, despite the strains.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat did Julia Roberts joke about in her British Vogue interview?\n\nJulia joked that her youthful appearance at 56 was due to her loving husband, strong genes, and a fulfilling life.\n\nWhat challenges are Julia Roberts and Danny Moder facing in their marriage?\n\nThey're navigating separate lives in different homes, adjusting from San Francisco to Malibu, and balancing Julia's thriving career with Danny's interests.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
