        "text": "The Fabulous Dixie Carter and The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\n\nJim Harris-The Southern Voice\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n6 min read\n\n·\n\nJun 9, 2024\n\n--\n\nActress Dixie Carter was not a cast member of the classic Southern film “Steel Magnolias.” Sally Field, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, and Daryl Hannah showed the world the perfect balance of strength, beauty, and tenderness that the title suggests. It would, however, be impossible to envision a Steel Magnolia without considering the late Ms. Carter as a perfect example, especially in her role as Julia in Designing Women. In a 1994 article about Ms. Carter, the Hackensack, NJ Record actually called her a Steel Magnolia. It fits.\n\nShe was born in McLemoresville, TN, in 1939. Carter was musically inclined and learned to play the harmonica, trumpet, and piano at a young age. After studying classical music with the dreams of being an opera star, a flawed operation when she was seven years old ended those. Ms. Carter attended and graduated college in Memphis. In 1959, Dixie was crowned Miss Volunteer at the University of Tennessee. In 1967, she married businessman Arthur Carter.\n\nDixie began her entertainment career on a stage in Memphis but soon moved to New York to expand her acting horizons. She landed her first stage role there in a production of “A Winter’s Tale.” Her Broadway debut was in the musical Sextet. She married businessman Arthur Carter in 1967. Her daughters were soon born, and she took several years off to focus on motherhood. She divorced Carter in 1977. She and actor George Hearn were married that same year. They were married for two years.\n\nMs. Carter returned to a guest spot on the One Life to Live soap opera in 1974. Soon after, she landed a regular role on “The Edge of Night,” where she appeared in six episodes. Carter also appeared in Broadway productions while shooting her TV schedule. She then made numerous guest appearances on prime-time TV series and filmed a made-for-TV movie, “The Killing of Randy Webster,” in 1981. On that set, she met her future husband, Hal Holbrook. They were married in 1984.\n\nIn 1982, she landed a role as a regular in a series, “Filthy Rich.” She co-starred with future Designing Women co-star Delta Burke. The series only lasted one season, but it left creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason determined to create a show with both Carter and Burke.\n\nShe next landed a role on the sitcom Diff’rent Strokes, playing Conrad Bain’s second wife. She made 33 appearances over two seasons and left before the show’s final season.\n\nDesigning Women was created by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and premiered in 1986. The premise was the lives of four women running a design firm in Atlanta, along with their assistant, Anthony. In addition to Ms. Carter and Ms. Burke, the cast featured Annie Potts, Jean Smart, and Meshach Taylor. The show did well in ratings but suffered from frequently moving timeslots. At one time, it was slated for cancellation, but a strong campaign from loyal viewers caused the network to give it another shot. It became a Top-30 show. It ran for seven seasons, ending in 1993.\n\nIn 1996, Carter authored a book, “Trying to Get to Heaven,” about her life with Holbrook and her time on Designing Women. Ms. Carter was politically Conservative and considered herself a Libertarian, but her Designing Women character, Julia, was written as very liberal. Carter made a deal with the producers, also prominent Democrats and friends of the Clintons, that each time she had to deliver a “liberal” speech, she would get to sing a song in a future episode.\n\nAfter Designing Women, she had a variety of TV roles. She was a regular on “Family Law” from 1999 until 2002. In 2007, Ms. Carter made seven appearances in the hit show Desperate Housewives. She was nominated for an Emmy award for that role.\n\nDixie Carter passed away from cancer in 2010. A performing arts center in Tennessee is named for her.\n\nPerhaps no scene from Ms. Carter’s 163 episodes of Designing Women, or possibly even her extensive acting resume, is better remembered or more often quoted than the one from the show’s second episode in its first season, “The Beauty Contest.” Her speech was so famous that the episode is now more commonly known by the subject of her diatribe, “The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia.” Her character, Julia Sugarbaker’s just under two-and-a-half-minute speech to the character Marjorie Leigh Winick, the current Miss Georgia World, is simply legendary. I’d suggest you search for the clip on YouTube. Reading the words won’t do it justice. I will share them here just to remind you of their magnificence, but please search for the video and give it a watch. You will enjoy it.\n\nThe scene is set in a dressing room backstage at the pageant. Winick has just insulted Julia’s sister, Suzanne. Julia quickly and assertively comes to her sister’s defense. No reading of the words can do the passage justice without hearing the voice inflections and seeing the physical assertiveness, but here goes.\n\nJulia: I’m Julia Sugarbaker, Suzanne Sugarbaker’s sister. I couldn’t help overhearing part of your conversation.\n\nMarjorie: Well, I’m sorry. I didn’t know anyone was here.\n\nJulia: Yes, and I gather from your comments there are a couple of other things you don’t know, Marjorie.\n\nFor example, you probably didn’t know that Suzanne was the only contestant in Georgia pageant history to sweep every category except congeniality, and that is not something the women in my family aspire to anyway.\n\nOr that when she walked down the runway in her swimsuit, five contestants quit on the spot. Or that when she emerged from the isolation booth to answer the question, “What would you do to prevent war?” she spoke so eloquently of patriotism, battlefields, and diamond tiaras, grown men wept.\n\nAnd you probably didn’t know, Marjorie, that Suzanne was not just any Miss Georgia; she was THE Miss Georgia. She didn’t twirl just a baton; that baton was on fire. And when she threw that baton into the air, it flew higher, further, faster than any baton had ever flown before, hitting a transformer and showering the darkened arena with sparks! And when it finally did come down, Marjorie, my sister, caught that baton and 12,000 people jumped to their feet for sixteen and one-half minutes of uninterrupted thunderous ovation as flames illuminated her tear-stained face! And that, Marjorie, just so you will know, and your children will someday know, is the night the lights went out in Georgia!\n\nSouthern Trivia-\n\nDesigning Women creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason also created Evening Shade, which starred Burt Reynold, Hal Holbrook, Michael Jeter, Ossie Davis, Marilu Henner, and Charles Durning\n\nWhen Burt Reynolds was starring in Gunsmoke, he also made appearances at the Ghost Town in the Sky amusement park in North Carolina. There he met Herbert “Cowboy” Coward. In 1971, when casting the film Deliverance, Reynolds recommended Coward for the toothless hillbilly role that was an instrumental part of the film and one of its most memorable scenes."
