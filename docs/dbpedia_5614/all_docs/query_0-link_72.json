        "text": "Best Actor\n\nThe Nominees:\n\nJavier Bardem, Before Night Falls\n\nRussell Crowe, Gladiator\n\nTom Hanks, Cast Away\n\nEd Harris, Pollock\n\nGeoffrey Rush, Quills\n\nSom: Crowe, who lost out to Kevin Spacey (American Beauty) last year, will walk away with 8.5 lb of metal (the statuette is made from the alloy britannium, plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, gold and is 13.52 inches high). Though hes done better work in L A Confidential and The Insider, its his time to shine as the Roman warrior Maximus.\n\nWho Should Win: Hanks for carrying Cast Away deserves his third statuette. Hes one of the very best actors in Hollywood but Academy voters will shy away from honoring Hanks, for fear of setting a record in the Best Actor category.\n\nArthur: Crowe, though Gladiator is not his best movie.\n\nWho Should Win: Ed Harris, for giving one of the most accomplished performances of his career. Pollock was a difficult, enigmatic man, a great and complex artist. And Harris brings out of the complexities with an exemplary performance.\n\nBest Actress\n\nThe Nominees:\n\nJoan Allen, The Contender\n\nJuliette Binoche, Chocolat\n\nEllen Burstyn, Requiem for a Dream\n\nLaura Linney, You Can Count on Me\n\nJulia Roberts, Erin Brockovich\n\nSom: If theres a lock at this years Academy Awards, its Roberts who captured the essence of the real Erin Brockovich with gusto.\n\nWho Should Win: Allens gripping performance as the tough-as-nails senator in the little-seen The Contender.\n\nArthur: Julia Roberts.\n\nWho Should Win: Laura Linney for playing the role of a struggling single mother whose life is thrown out of gear with the arrival of her prodigal brother. The movie, You Can Count on Me, is a surprise art house hit, and Linney has suddenly shown us the kind of mature performance that we least expected from her.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nThe Nominees:\n\nJeff Bridges, The Contender\n\nWillem Dafoe, Shadow of the Vampire\n\nBenicio Del Toro, Traffic\n\nAlbert Finney, Erin Brockovich\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Gladiator\n\nSom: Del Toro is the favorite in this category with Finney a close second. Del Toros performance as the Mexican cop staring in the face of corruption is the strongest of the group though Finney could be the sentimental favorite. Look for one or the other to win.\n\nWho Should Win: Del Toro, a bright up-and-comer in Hollywood. But its a tossup between him and Finney.\n\nArthur: Del Toro.\n\nWho Should Win: Finney, who has been around for more than three decades and never shows signs of getting tired of creating haunting performances.\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nThe Nominees:\n\nJudi Dench, Chocolat\n\nMarcia Gay Harden, Pollock\n\nKate Hudson, Almost Famous\n\nFrances McDormand, Almost Famous\n\nJulie Walters, Billy Elliot\n\nSom: If theres another lock this year, its Hudson for Almost Famous. With a win for the 21-year-old daughter of Goldie Hawn, who also won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar at the age of 21 for 1968s Cactus Flower, it will be an emotional moment that the Academy loves.\n\nWho Should Win: Hudson.\n\nArthur: Hudson\n\nWho Should Win: Hudson\n\nBest Director\n\nThe Nominees:\n\nStephen Daldry, Billy Elliot\n\nAng Lee, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nSteven Soderbergh, Erin Brockovich\n\nRidley Scott, Gladiator\n\nSteven Soderbergh, Traffic\n\nSom: The Best Picture and Best Director awards are linked, so Ill pick Scott. But there are pundits who feel that Lee will win the award as the consolation prize for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Still, I dont think viewers will see the same situation a couple years back when Steven Spielberg won for Saving Private Ryan but Shakespeare in Love took top honors.\n\nWho Should Win: Soderbergh, who is nominated twice, for Traffic and Erin Brokovich.\n\nArthur: Ang Lee\n\nWho Should Win: Ang Lee, for not only creating a meditative and thrilling martial arts drama, but also in honor of his past accomplishments including Sense and Sensibility and Ice Storm.\n\nBest Picture\n\nThe Nominees:\n\nChocolat\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nErin Brockovich\n\nGladiator\n\nTraffic\n\nSom: Gladiator is a sure to win Best Picture. Its a grand epic that the Academy loves (Ben Hur).\n\nWhat Should Win: Among the nominees, the winner should be the complex drug-drama Traffic. Director Steven Soderbergh interweaves three stories on Americas failing war on drugsan important political topic. Its not glamorous yet Traffic makes a powerful statement.\n\nArthur: Gladiator. Hollywood loves historic epics -- Dr Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi ..\n\nWhat Should Win: Traffic. A riveting, thought provoking drama which has also turned out to be a box-office hit, having grossed over $103 million in North America.\n\nOK, folks place your bets..."
