        "text": "After more than 20 years together, Julia Roberts and Danny Moder have solidified their status as one of Hollywood's most inspiring couples.\n\nThe pair met on the set of the 2001 film The Mexican and later tied the knot in a super-private ceremony held on Independence Day in 2002. They share three children — son Henry and twins Hazel and Phinnaeus.\n\nRoberts and Moder have tried to keep their family life as private as possible, with the exception of an occasional date night, red carpet appearance or sweet birthday tribute.\n\n\"We try to protect our kids,\" the Pretty Woman star told USA Today in 2013. \"We just want to have our family life and not have that intruded upon.\"\n\nFrom collaborating onscreen to raising their family together, here's a complete breakdown of Julia Roberts and Danny Moder's sweet relationship timeline.\n\nSpring 2000: Julia Roberts and Danny Moder meet on the set of The Mexican\n\nRoberts and Moder first met in 2000 when they filmed the movie The Mexican. Moder was working as a cameraman on the film, while Roberts starred as Brad Pitt's love interest, Samantha. At the time, the cinematographer was married to celebrity makeup artist Vera Steimberg, while the Pretty Woman star was dating Benjamin Bratt.\n\nIn June 2001, Roberts split from Bratt after nearly four years together. Moder's divorce from Steimberg was finalized in early 2002.\n\n\"He sorted his whole thing out, separate and apart from me,\" Roberts later told Oprah. \"And I sorted my life out, separate and apart from him. I think that's the only reason we were able to ultimately fall in love with each other and be together.\"\n\nJuly 4, 2002: Julia Roberts and Danny Moder get married\n\nOn July 4, 2002, the couple tied the knot at Roberts' 82-acre ranch in Taos, New Mexico.\n\nThe ceremony was kept secret, with guests invited to simply \"celebrate Independence Day.\" But at midnight, flickering candles and Chinese lanterns appeared, and Roberts and Moder surprised the crowd by stepping into a circle of scattered rose petals to exchange simple handwritten vows.\n\n\"She's gloriously happy,\" costume designer Michael Dennison — who created Roberts's pale pink cotton wedding dress, which was decorated with pearls and hand-painted flowers — told PEOPLE at the time. \"These two people are deeply in love.\"\n\nMay 31, 2004: Julia Roberts and Danny Moder confirm they're expecting twins\n\nAlmost two years into their marriage, Roberts' spokesperson confirmed to PEOPLE that the actress was expecting twins with Moder and was due to give birth in early 2005.\n\nA week later, Roberts jetted off to Italy to stay at costar George Clooney's Lake Como house while shooting Ocean's 12. \"I was pregnant for the first time, and you would have thought I was made of glass,\" the actress revealed during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \"They just wanted to dress me in cotton balls and usher me. It was really, really charming.\"\n\nNovember 28, 2004: Julia Roberts and Danny Moder welcome twins\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2004, Roberts and Moder welcomed their twins, Phinnaeus and Hazel.\n\n\"Hazel is an old-fashioned name, and she's a strong, perfect Hazel,\" Roberts said during a 2009 appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman.\n\nAs for Phinnaeus, \"My husband wanted to name him Finn, which I quite liked, but it seemed like a nickname,\" the actress explained on Live with Regis and Kelly. \"So I said we had to have a proper name, and then we can call him Finn.\"\n\nDecember 29, 2006: Julia Roberts and Danny Moder confirm they're expecting again\n\nIn December 2006, a spokesperson for Roberts confirmed to PEOPLE that the couple would be welcoming their third child together that summer.\n\nThe following April, a chic, black-clad Roberts showed off her growing baby bump while greeting fans on the set of her film Fireflies in the Garden in Austin, Texas.\n\nJune 18, 2007: Julia Roberts and Danny Moder welcome their third child\n\nIn June 2007, Roberts and Moder officially welcomed their third child to the family, a baby boy named Henry Daniel.\n\n\"[Henry woke up the other morning and said], 'It's a beautiful day, Mama.' Which makes 5:30 [a.m.] a whole lot prettier,\" Roberts told Oprah in 2010. \"That's the thing about being new to the world, you're just so … impressed with everything. The older you get, the grumpier you get.\"\n\nAugust 11, 2014: Danny Moder praises Julia Roberts' acting chops\n\nAfter scoring an Emmy nomination for outstanding cinematography for a miniseries or movie for his work on The Normal Heart — an HBO movie about the onset of the HIV-AIDS crisis in the early 1980s — Moder selflessly gave his wife props for her performance in the film as Dr. Emma Brookner.\n\n\"It was a challenging role,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It wasn't a sexy role, but, wow, what she brought to it, I was really impressed.\"\n\nThat same month, the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network announced that Roberts and Moder would be honored with the organization's Humanitarian Award for their commitment to raising awareness about HIV.\n\n\"We are proud to recognize Danny Moder & Julia Roberts, whose inspiring work on HBO's The Normal Heart has brought renewed attention to an important movement – and an on-going crisis – in LGBT and American history,\" GLSEN said in a statement.\n\nAugust 26, 2014: Danny Moder shares first photo with Julia Roberts on Instagram\n\nFollowing The Normal Heart's win for outstanding television movie at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, Moder shared his first photo with Roberts on Instagram.\n\nHe posted a photo of the couple standing on the Emmy red carpet, though only their shadows are visible. In the succinct caption, Moder wrote: \" 'Normal Heart' wins best movie.\"\n\nModer previously shared an image of a solo Roberts enjoying some scenery on his Instagram in May 2014.\n\nNovember 8, 2015: Julia Roberts calls Danny Moder her \"favorite person on earth\"\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE in November 2015, Roberts opened up about working with her cinematographer husband on the set of Secret in Her Eyes. \"It was amazing. It was so great. He's my favorite person on the planet, so I love spending time with him and I love his work ethic,\" she said. \"His point of view is really valuable to me.\"\n\nMay 12, 2016: Danny Moder shares a BTS photo of Julia Roberts getting glam for Cannes\n\nIn May 2016, Roberts' face appeared on Moder's Instagram feed for the first time — at least in profile.\n\nThe cinematographer gave his followers an artistic glimpse of his wife's glam squad getting her ready for her first-ever appearance at the Cannes Film Festival, where she attended the screening of her movie The Money Monster with costar Clooney.\n\nApril 19, 2017: Julia Roberts discusses her marriage to Danny Moder in PEOPLE's World's Most Beautiful issue\n\nRoberts was named PEOPLE's World's Most Beautiful Woman in April 2017 for a record fifth time. In the issue's cover story, the actress revealed that a perfect day for her is one filled with lots of family time.
