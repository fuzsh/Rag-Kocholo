        "text": "The American South is so often depicted on the big screen, it's no wonder the films and performances representing the region have taken home their fair share of Oscars over the years.\n\nHere we take a look back at those movies that have brought home Oscar gold, plus some of the actors and actresses you might not have known come from around these parts. Ben Flanagan | bflanagan@al.com\n\nBlue Sky (Alabama)\n\nJessica Lange won her second Oscar, this time for best actress, in this drama about a family who moves to a military base and quickly becomes part of a cover-up involving nuclear bomb tests. Scenes filmed at Craig Air Force Base in Selma were shot in 1990, but the film did not release until four years later. It also co-stars Texas native Tommy Lee Jones as Lange's husband.\n\nCapote (2005)\n\nThe great Harper Lee passed away just last week, but we hope she saw Catherine Keener's deft Oscar-nominated portrayal of the author in the critically acclaimed \"Capote,\" for which Philip Seymour Hoffman won an Oscar for playing legendary writer Truman Capote. Keener and Hoffman show great chemistry, giving literary fans and Alabama natives a glimpse into the friendship that blossomed in Monroeville during the 1930s.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)\n\nSteven Spielberg's spectacular science fiction adventure earned eight Oscar nominations for directing, supporting actress (Melinda Dillon), cinematography, visual effects, art direction, musical score, film editing and sound. Its only win came for cinematography. For a few sequences, Spielberg filmed in two abandoned World War II airship hangars at the former Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile, Ala.\n\nForrest Gump (1994)\n\nRobert Zemeckis' Oscar-winning adaptation of Winston Groom's novel tells the unbelievable fictional story of a good-natured Alabama man who witnesses and participates in many of the defining events of American history during the latter half of the 20th century. While most of the best picture-winner takes place in Alabama, Zemeckis filmed those scenes in South Carolina, Virginia and North Carolina. It won six Oscars including best picture and actor (Tom Hanks) and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide. Gump grows up in the fictional town of Greenbow, Ala., and eventually plays football for the University of Alabama under Paul \"Bear\" Bryant.\n\nThe Help (2011)\n\nMontgomery native and Auburn graduate Octavia Spencer won best supporting actress for her scene-stealing performance as Minny Jackson in \"The Help,\" Tate Taylor's adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's beloved book about a young white woman's relationship with two black maids during the Civil Rights era in 1963 Jackson, Miss. Spencer has since been nominated in the same category twice, for \"Hidden Figures\" last year and \"The Shape of Water\" this year.\n\nThe Miracle Worker (1962)\n\nArthur Penn's treatment of Tuscumbia, Ala., native Helen Keller's story earned five Oscar nominations for best actress (Anne Bancroft, who won), supporting actress (Patty Duke, who also won), directing, adapted screenplay and costume design.\n\nMy Cousin Vinny (1992)\n\nIn a huge upset, Marisa Tomei won best supporting actress for her hilarious turn in \"My Cousin Vinny,\" which takes place in the fictional Beechum County, Alabama. The courthouse scenes were actually filmed in Monticello, Ga.\n\nNorma Rae (1979)\n\nSally Field won an Oscar for best actress for her portrayal of a factory worker from a small town in North Carolina who becomes involved in the labor union activities at the textile factory where she works after the health of her and her co-workers is compromised. While it took place in North Carolina, it was filmed on location in Opelika, Ala., including mill scenes that were shot at the Opelika Manufacturing Corp. and motel scenes filmed at The Golden Cherry Motel. Field would win the same award again just five years later for her role in the Texas-set film \"Places in the Heart.\"\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)\n\nBirmingham, Ala., native Louise Fletcher earned the best actress Oscar for playing Nurse Ratched in Milos Forman's mental hospital drama that also won best picture, director, actor (Jack Nicholson) and adapted screenplay. During her acceptance speech, Fletcher used sign language to thank her parents, both of whom were deaf and worked with the hard-of-hearing.\n\nSelma (2014)\n\nAva DuVernay's gripping and reverent portrayal of the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches earned an Oscar nomination for best picture and a win for best song (\"Glory\"). Much of the production filmed in Georgia, but key scenes were shot in Selma and Montgomery, specifically locations where the historic events actually took place.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1962)\n\nGregory Peck won an Oscar for his portrayal of noble attorney Atticus Finch in this 1962 adaptation of Harper Lee's novel of the same name. Set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Ala., during the 1930s, it tells the story of Finch and his family as he defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice. A must-see for southerners. It won three Oscars for actor, adapted screenplay and art direction and scored five more nominations for picture, director, supporting actress (Birmingham native Mary Badham), cinematography and musical score.\n\nMoonlight (2016)\n\nA chronicle of the childhood, adolescence and burgeoning adulthood of a young, African-American, gay man growing up in a rough neighborhood of Miami. Barry Jenkins' portrait of masculinity in the South won the best picture Oscar in stunning fashion, along with screenplay and supporting actor (Mahershala Ali) for 2016. Its soundtrack also features Atlanta's own Goodie Mob, complete with the the chopped and screwed technique the film's composer even applies to its score. Co-stars Bessemer native Andre Holland (read our Q&A).\n\n12 Years a Slave (2013)\n\nSteve McQueen's riveting film tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a New York State-born free African-American man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. by two conmen in 1841 and sold into slavery. He was put to work on plantations in the state of Louisiana on a harrowing journey that nearly cost him his life many times over as he fought to find his family again. The film won Oscars for best picture, best supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o) and adapted screenplay.\n\nNo Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nViolence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and more than $2 million dollars in cash near the Rio Grande in Joel and Ethan Coens' bleak adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's bleak novel. It won Oscars for best picture, directors, screenplay and supporting actor (Javier Bardem). For a pair of Minnesota boys who now live in New York, the Coen brothers latched on to more southern \"isms\" than most modern filmmakers born outside the region (and heck, born inside it, too). First of all, they cast prominent roles with a couple of actors who actually pull off the accents with precision -- Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson -- also casting smaller roles with real-life southerners like Beth Grant, Gene Jones, Margaret Bowman and Kathy Lamkin. The film moves at a slow and steady tick, much like many of its characters speak.\n\nDriving Miss Daisy (1989)\n\nAn old Jewish woman and her African-American chauffeur in the American South have a relationship that grows and improves over the years. Set in Atlanta, this scored Oscar wins for picture, actress (Jessica Tandy), makeup and adapted screenplay.\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967)\n\nAn African American police detective is asked to investigate a murder in a racially hostile southern town in Norman Jewison's 1967 best picture winner starring Sidney Potier and Rod Steiger. A city cop comes to philosophical blows with a smalltown police chief in this adaptation of John Ball's 1965 novel. While set in Mississippi, Jewison filmed most of it in Illinois, though that doesn't cheapen the impact enhanced by the performances, namely Steiger's Oscar-wining turn as a racist cop in need of a reality check. It won five Oscars including picture, actor, editing, sound and adapted screenplay.\n\nGone with the Wind (1939)\n\nA manipulative woman and a roguish man conduct a turbulent romance during the American Civil War and Reconstruction periods. Set on the O'Hara family's cotton plantation in Georgia, this is still considered by most one of the greatest films of all time, winning Oscars for picture, director, actress (Vivien Leigh), supporting actress (Hattie McDaniel, the first African American to be nominated for and win an Oscar), screenplay, cinematography, art direction and film editing.\n\nDallas Buyers Club (2013)\n\nIn 1985 Dallas, electrician and hustler Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) works around the system to help AIDS patients get the medication they need after he is diagnosed with the disease. McConaughey rode his performance and Texas charisma all the way to Oscar, as did Jared Lero and the film's makeup and hairstyling team.\n\nRay (2004)\n\nJamie Foxx (from Texas) scored an Oscar for playing legendary musician Ray Charles (from Georgia) in this much-beloved biopic from director Taylor Hackford. Watch Foxx's outstanding Oscar speech.\n\nTender Mercies (1983)\n\nA broken-down, middle-aged country singer gets a new wife, reaches out to his long-lost daughter, and tries to put his troubled life back together. Robert Duvall won his only Oscar in Bruce Beresford's redemption tale written by Horton Foote. This quietly powerful family drama teaches us it's not too late to get our act together, especially for the sake of our loved ones in need of our presence. Tess Harper and Allan Hubbard lend steady support as Duvall's country singer's newfound family and foundation. Filmed in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north central Texas, we recommend it if only for one of the best songwriting lessons ever filmed, proving Duvall could have made it as a musician. Foote's original screenplay also won an Oscar.\n\nSergeant York (1941)\n\nGary Cooper won best actor for playing a young man from a rural area near Pall Mall, Tenn., who would be drafted in World War I and end up becoming one of the most celebrated war heroes. The film's editing also won an Oscar.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nBorn in Memphis and raised in Mississippi, Morgan Freeman finally won an Oscar for his terrific work as a gruff boxing trainer in Clint Eastwood's \"Million Dollar Baby.\"\n\nSyriana (2005)\n\nFew remember George Clooney actually hails from the South. Born in Lexington, Ky., Clooney scored his first Oscar for supporting actor in \"Syriana,\" Stephen Gaghan's politically charged epic about the state of the oil industry in the hands of those personally involved and affected by it.\n\nThe Fugitive (1993)\n\nThe Texas native pulls off southern characters like few can, and he scored a best supporting actor win for his scene-stealing work as a U.S. Marshall leading the hunt for the wrongfully accused Richard Kimble in \"The Fugitive.\"\n\nHud (1963)\n\nMacon, Ga., native Melvyn Douglas plays an honest and hard-working Texas rancher who has a conflict with his unscrupulous, selfish, arrogant and egotistical son who sank into alcoholism after accidentally killing his brother in a car crash. Filmed in and around the Texas Panhandle, director Martin Ritt's drama based on Larry McMurtry's 1961 novel finds a desolate town full of troubled individuals who can't escape one another despite their disdain in such a small town. The always-likable Paul Newman does some career-best work, managing to turn just about every last viewer off, no matter how charming his Hud can seem. Douglas, Patricia Neal (winner of supporting actress) and Brandon deWilde round out a terrific cast.\n\nFences (2016)\n\nSouth Carolina native Viola Davis won the best supporting actor Oscar for her riveting work in Denzel Washington's adaptation of August Wilson's play.\n\nCold Mountain (2003)\n\nRenee Zelwegger was a major standout for many in Anthony Minghella's take on the popular novel about a wounded Civil War soldier who embarks on a perilous journey back home to North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart. She won best supporting actress.\n\nL.A. Confidential (1997)\n\nPreviously best known for her work as Vicky Vale in \"Batman,\" Athens, Ga., native Kim Basinger won best supporting actress for a terrific turn as a would-be femme fatale in the outstanding noir \"L.A. Confidential.\"\n\nMelvin and Howard (1980)\n\nNewport, Ark., native Mary Steenburgen won best supporting actress for playing the role of Lynda Dummar in Jonathan Demme's 1980 film \"Melvin and Howard.\"\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire (1951)\n\nBlanche DuBois moves in with her sister in New Orleans and is tormented by her brutish brother-in-law while her reality crumbles around her in this adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play. Vivien Leigh scored best actress for her rousing portrayal of Blanche, opposite Marlon Brando.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook (2012)\n\nBorn in Indian Hills, Ky., and now one of the world's biggest movie stars, Jennifer Lawrence won the best actress Oscar for her role in David O. Russell's romantic comedy \"Silver Linings Playbook.\"\n\nThe Blind Side (2009)\n\n\"The Blind Side\" tells the true and heartwarming story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All-American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman (Oscar-winner Sandra Bullock) and her family.\n\nWalk the Line (2005)\n\nBorn in New Orleans and raised in Nashville, Reese Witherspoon revisited her southern roots to play June Carter Cash in \"Walk the Line,\" for which she won the best actress Oscar.\n\nMonster's Ball (2001)\n\nAfter a family tragedy, a racist prison guard reexamines his attitudes while falling in love with the African American wife of the last prisoner he executed in this Louisiana-set drama for which Halle Berry became the first-ever black woman to win best actress.\n\nErin Brockovich (2000)\n\nWhile set in California, Steven Soderbergh's legal drama stars Georgia native Julia Roberts, who coasted to her first Oscar win thanks to a commanding and charismatic performance as Erin Brockovich.\n\nDead Man Walking (1995)\n\nSusan Sarandon won best actress for her work as a Louisiana nun who, while comforting a convicted killer (Sean Penn) on death row, empathizes with both the killer and his victim's families.\n\nThe Piano (1993)\n\nBorn in Conyers, Ga., Holly Hunter never shies away from using her southern accent on screen. But to win an Oscar, she didn't need it, given she plays a mute woman sent to 1850s New Zealand along with her young daughter and prized piano for an arranged marriage to a wealthy landowner in Jane Campion's \"The Piano.\"\n\nMisery (1990)\n\nMemphis native Kathy Bates scored an Oscar win for best actress for a brilliant turn as an obsessed fan in Rob Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's novel \"Misery.\"\n\nCoal Miner's Daughter (1980)\n\nBiographical story of Loretta Lynn, a legendary country singer that came from poverty to worldwide fame, as she rose from humble beginnings in Kentucky to superstardom and changing the sound and style of country music forever. Michael Apted's take on Lynn's life won Sissy Spacek and Oscar and gave young Tommy Lee Jones one of his first big breaks. Again, we come back to the accents, and Spacek (a Texas native) gives one for the ages, disappearing into the Kentucky girl and even doing her own (excellent) singing! It's also a pleasure to watch Jones make a star out of himself as the alcoholic, abusive and downright pathetic husband who new his young wife had star potential and wanted to ride it to the top. A joy to watch, with some sad bumps in the road.\n\nMildred Pierce (1945)\n\nJoan Crawford, from San Antonio, won best actress for fantastic work in Michael Curtiz's beloved film about a hard-working mother who inches towards disaster as she divorces her husband and starts a successful restaurant business to support her spoiled daughter.\n\nThe Three Faces of Eve (1957)\n\nBorn in Thomasville, Ga., Joanne Woodward won best actress for her portrayal of a woman with multiple personality disorder in \"The Three Faces of Eve.\"\n\nTraffic (2000)\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Steven Soderbergh spent a lot of his childhood in the South, growing up in Charlottesville then Baton Rouge. He was nominated twice in 2000, justly winning for \"Traffic.\"\n\nSling Blade (1996)\n\nArguably our all-time favorite film about the South, made with such care by an actual southerner in Arkansas native Billy Bob Thornton, who plays a simple man hospitalized since his childhood murder of his mother and her lover as he gets released to start a new life in a small town. Thornton earned an Oscar nomination for best actor and even won for adapted screenplay, only further confirming this slice-of-life's greatness in our eyes. Just listen to the texture in the voices of Thornton's characters, starting with the delightfully antiquated manner in which his protagonist Karl speaks. Also keep an eye on outstanding supporting performances from Alabama native Lucas Black, Arkansas native Natalie Canderday and Kentucky native Dwight Yoakam, who nearly steals the whole show. While somewhat dark in subject matter at times, it's as fine a piece of southern filmmaking as you'll find."
