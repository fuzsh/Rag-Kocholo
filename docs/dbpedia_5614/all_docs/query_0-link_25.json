Julia Roberts has a production company called Red Om Films (“Moder” spelled backwards; formerly Shoelace Productions).\n\nJulia Roberts’s father, Walter Grady Roberts, was a vacuum cleaner salesman, and her Minneapolis, Minnesota-born mother, Betty Lou Motes (née Bredemus), was a one-time church secretary and real estate agent. Julia Roberts’s parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing theatrical productions for the armed forces and later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, Georgia off Juniper Street in Midtown; the 2 divorced in 1971. Julia Roberts’s mother later married Michael Motes and had another daughter, named Nancy Motes who was born in 1976. Julia Roberts’s father died of cancer when she was 10. Julia Roberts’s older brother and sister, Eric Roberts (from whom she was once estranged but reconciled since 2004) and Lisa Roberts Gillan, are also actors.\n\nJulia Roberts moved to Smyrna, Georgia (a suburb of Atlanta) in 1972, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School and Campbell High School. Julia Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child, but soon after graduating from Smyrna’s Campbell High School, she headed to New York to join her sister Lisa Roberts Gillan and pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click modeling agency and enrolled in acting classes. She reverted to her original name “Julia Roberts” when she discovered that a “Julie Roberts” was already registered with the Screen Actors Guild. Julia Roberts’s niece, Emma Roberts, whom Julia used to take to movie sets when she was a young girl, has joined her father and aunts in the acting business.\n\nJulia Roberts made her film debut playing a supporting role opposite her brother, Eric, in Blood Red (she has just 2 words of dialogue), which, although completed in 1986, was not released until 1989.

Julia Roberts played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg’s Hook in 1991, and also played a Nurse in the 1991 film Dying Young; which was followed by a 2-year hiatus, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman’s The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, “What Happened to Julia Roberts?”\n\nIn 1993, she co-starred with Denzel Washington in the successful The Pelican Brief, based on the John Grisham novel. Julia Roberts also starred alongside Liam Neeson in the 1996 film Michael Collins. Over the next few years, she starred in a series of films that were critical and commercial failures, primarily because she was cast in roles that strayed too far from her film persona, such as Stephen Frears’ Mary Reilly (1996) for which earned a Razzie Worst Actress nomination. Julia Roberts broke her losing streak with the hugely popular comedy My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997), and eventually regained her earlier reputation as an actress who could open a movie and guarantee box office success. Julia Roberts starred with Hugh Grant in the popular 1999 film Notting Hill. That same year, she also starred in Runaway Bride, the 2nd film with the Julia Roberts-Richard Gere duo. Julia Roberts was a guest star on the Law & Order television series in an episode broadcast on 5 May, 1999 entitled “Empire”, with series regular Benjamin Bratt (at that time her boyfriend).\n\nIn 2001, Julia Roberts received the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich, who helped wage a successful lawsuit against energy giant Pacific Gas & Electric. Whilst presenting the Best Actor Award to Denzel Washington the following year, she made a gaff when she said she was glad that Tom Conti wasn’t there. Julia Roberts meant the conductor Bill Conti, who had tried to hasten the conclusion of her Oscar speech the previous year, but instead named the Scottish actor. Julia Roberts would team up with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for 3 more films: Ocean’s Eleven (2001), Full Frontal (2002), and Ocean’s Twelve (2004). Later in 2001 she starred in the road gangster comedy The Mexican giving her a chance to work with long time friend Brad Pitt. In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the hit single “Dreamgirl” by the Dave Matthews Band.\n\nJulia Roberts’s 2 films released in 2006, The Ant Bully and Charlotte’s Web, were both animated features for which she provided only voice acting. Julia Roberts’s next film was Charlie Wilson’s War, with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols and based on the book by former CBS journalist George Crile; it was released on 21 December, 2007.

Julia Roberts’s niece, Emma Roberts, is said to be considered for the role of her daughter.\n\nJulia Roberts made her Broadway debut on 19 April, 2006 as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg’s 1997 play 3 Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1,000,000 in ticket sales during its 1st week and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, most critics heavily criticized Julia Roberts’ performance. The New York Times’ critic Ben Brantly, a self-proclaimed ‘Juliaholic,’ described her as being fraught with “self-consciousness (especially in the 1st act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the 2characters she plays.” Brantley also criticized the production of “Greenberg’s slender, elegant play,” writing that “it’s almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.” 3Days of Rain received 2 Tony Award nominations in stage design categories, but took home neither prize. Julia Roberts did, however, receive a Broadway.com audience award (a minor theatrical prize) for her performance.\n\nJulia Roberts has brought to life some of the books from American Girl as movies and serves as Executive Producer, along with her sister Lisa. The company’s product lines and services are focused on pre-teen-girl characters from various periods of American history, who are embodied as dolls and featured in narratives including books and movies. Its flagship line is a collection of historical 18-inch dolls that have books and accessories. Currently Julia Roberts has produced 4 movies.\n\nDirectors Robert Altman, Mike Nichols, Joel Schumacher, Steven Soderbergh, and Garry Marshall have repeatedly cast Julia Roberts in their films. But Steven Spielberg, after directing her in Hook (1991) for which she earned a Razzie Worst Supporting Actress nomination, never worked with her again. In a 1993 interview with Barbara Walters, Julia Roberts said that she was confused by Steven Spielberg’s recollection of working with her, as she only has positive memories of working on his film. In 1993, The New York Times wrote that Herbert Ross, the director of Steel Magnolias, criticized that Julia Roberts’s acting was 1-dimensional, despite the fact that she received her 1st Academy Award nomination for it. Although, Julia Roberts eventually called for a truce, they too never worked together again.\n\nAs of February 2007, Julia Roberts’s films have grossed $2,204,631,930 at the American box office making her the biggest female movie star in history and achieving this feat with only 31 films to her name. Julia Roberts was also placed at the pinnacle of the Ulmer Scale, a comprehensive guide to the global star power of actors and directors in independent and studio films created by James Ulmer, ahead of such other luminaries as Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks. This was partly owing to her ability to attract filmgoers solely on the basis of her name’s appearance above the title and without the support of a male co-star, something few other actresses have been able to do.\n\nJulia Roberts’s personal life has often been in the spotlight. Julia Roberts has had widely reported romantic relationships with numerous famous men, including Liam Neeson, Dylan McDermott, Kiefer Sutherland, Lyle Lovett, Matthew Perry, and Benjamin Bratt. Julia Roberts was briefly engaged to Dylan McDermott, her Steel Magnolias co-star. Julia Roberts met Kiefer Sutherland in 1990, when he was her co-star in Flatliners; he left his wife and children to move in with Julia Roberts. In August 1990, Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland announced their engagement, with an elaborate studio-planned wedding scheduled for 14 June, 1991. Julia Roberts broke the engagement 3 days before the wedding when she discovered Kiefer Sutherland had been meeting with a stripper named Amanda Rice. Julia Roberts subsequently went to Ireland with Jason Patric, a friend of Kiefer Sutherland’s. On 27 June, 1993, she married country singer Lyle Lovett; the couple had met only 3 weeks earlier. The wedding took place on 72-hours’ notice and was held in Marion, Indiana, near where Lyle Lovett was appearing on tour with his band. Less than 2 years later, in March 1995, the couple announced their separation. They subsequently divorced.\n\nIn 1998, Julia Roberts began dating Law & Order star Benjamin Bratt, who was her escort for the 25 March, 2001 Academy Awards ceremony at which she won her Oscar. 3months later, in June 2001, Julia Roberts and Benjamin Bratt announced that they were no longer a couple. “It’s come to a kind and tenderhearted end,” she said of their relationship. Julia Roberts met her current husband, cameraman Daniel Moder, on the set of her movie The Mexican in 2000 and they began an affair. Though at the time, Daniel Moder was married to Vera Steinberg Moder, he filed for divorce a little over a year later, and after it was finalised, he and Julia Roberts married on 4th of July 2002, at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico. On 28 November, 2004, they became the parents of fraternal twins, daughter Hazel Patricia and son Phinnaeus “Finn” Walter. Their 3rd child, son Henry Daniel Moder, was born on 18 June, 2007 in Los Angeles.\n\nJulia Roberts has given her time and resources to UNICEF as well as to other charitable organisations. In Spring 1995, Julia Roberts, an enthusiastic supporter of UNICEF, asked if she could meet some of the relief agency’s neediest recipients. On 10 May, she arrived in Port-au-Prince, as she said, “to educate myself”. The poverty she found was overwhelming. “My heart is just bursting”, she said. UNICEF officials hoped that her 6-day visit would trigger an outburst of giving: $10,000,000in aid was sought at the time.\n\nIn 2000, Julia Roberts narrated Silent Angels, a documentary about Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, which was shot in Los Angeles, Baltimore and New York. The documentary was designed to help raise public awareness about the disease. In July 2006, Earth Biofuels announced Julia Roberts as a spokeswoman for the company and as chair of the company’s newly formed Advisory Board promoting the use of renewable fuels.\n\nKeep visiting: www.lifechums.com more celebrities featuring shortly ……………."
