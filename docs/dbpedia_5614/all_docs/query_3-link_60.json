        "text": "Julia Roberts may be known for her fictional roles as a single woman finding love in some of Hollywood’s most iconic romantic comedies, but in real life, the actress has been married to her husband Daniel Moder for over two decades.\n\nAlthough she’s stayed tight lipped about their romance, she does occasionally share snippets of their life together.\n\nAt the beginning of February the 56-year-old Pretty Woman star posted a birthday tribute to him on Instagram. “Happy birthday to this amazing man who lights up our world”, she wrote in the caption.\n\nWith over half a million likes on the post, fans were clearly excited to get a rare glimpse into her family life via the photo.\n\nWe’ve rounded up everything we could find about Julia Roberts’ long-time husband, Danny Moder.\n\nDanny Moder is a cinematographer and camera operator\n\nLike his wife, the LA-born cinematographer also works in showbiz. According to his IMDB page, he’s worked behind the scenes on films and TV shows including Ezra, Flag Day, Dead to Me, Ibiza, and Mr and Mrs Smith, to name a few.\n\nHow did Julia Roberts meet her husband?\n\nPer People, Roberts and Moder met in 2001 on the set of The Mexican. They must’ve hit it off right away as the couple tied the knot just one year later in an ultra private ceremony.\n\nNot all Hollywood couples have lasted as long as Roberts and Moder have. So how do they do it? In a 2022 interview with E!, the actress shared her advice. “I always say that same thing and I’m sticking with it,” she said. “It’s making out. Lots of making out.”\n\nWho are Julia Roberts’ kids?\n\nThe Notting Hill actress shares three teenage children with 55-year-old Moder.\n\nThey welcomed twins Hazel and Phinnaeus in 2004, who are now 19.\n\nTheir youngest son Henry is 15.\n\nWho else have Julia Roberts and Donny Moder been married to?\n\nBefore finding love with Moder, Roberts was married to American country singer Lyle Lovett from 1993 to 1995, but it seems they ended on good terms. “We remain close and in great support of one another,” they shared in a joint statement in 1995, per InStyle.\n\nModer meanwhile tied the knot with Argentinian make-up artist Vera Steimberg Moder in 1997, but they called it quits in 2002."
