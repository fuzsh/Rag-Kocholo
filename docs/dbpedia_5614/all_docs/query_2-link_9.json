        "text": "Biography\n\nSince arriving at the University of Waterloo in 2007, my research has centred upon early Canadian colonial society, especially the concepts and actualities of public space and public life.\n\nSocial historians, like me, are interested in the long, enduring patterns of the past: demography, families, economic and intellectual transitions, popular culture, and social norms and the effects of each of these upon personal and group experience. Classically, they conceive history “from the bottom up” and seek to locate ordinary men and women as historical actors; as people who made history as much as they experienced it. My work as a researcher and a teacher engages with the discipline’s classic foci upon class, gender and race, upon the wide, non-episodic, social and cultural patterns of colonial Canada in the longue durée.\n\nI published my first book in 2009. Called In Mixed Company: Taverns and Public Life in Upper Canada, it explores taverns as colonial public space and how men and women of diverse backgrounds – Native and newcomer, privileged and labouring, white and non-white – negotiated a place for themselves within them. The stories that emerge unsettle comfortable certainties about who belonged where in colonial society.\n\nCurrently I hold a SSHRC Standard Research Grant for a new project entitled “Repositioning the War of 1812: The Cultural Politics of War in a Colonial Society.” My new 1812 project blends the methodologies of social history and military history to write about the cultural politics of war.\n\nEducation\n\nB.A. (Hon) Wilfrid Laurier University, 1989\n\nM.A. History, University of Waterloo, 1991\n\nPhD Canadian History, University of Toronto, 1999\n\nResearch and teaching interests\n\nI like teaching. I like its traditional element: the profession of knowledge in a public setting. I like its service role: assisting students to reach whatever goals first brought them to the University. I want students to learn to value History for its power to shape their sense of place, identity, and citizenship. But I know I have done my job well when they learn to read with more comprehension, write more fluently and persuasively, improve their skills in critical thinking, or when they can discuss competing interpretations with mutual respect.\n\nCourses taught\n\nHIST 191 Ten Days That Shook the World\n\nHIST 201 Columbus & After: New Worlds in North America\n\nHIST 253 Canadian History: The Colonial Period\n\nHIST 374 Canada’s Social History\n\nHIST 403A Early Canada\n\nHIST 614 Space, Identity and Culture: Readings in Canadian Social History before the 20thC\n\nHIST 691 (Directed Readings)\n\nHIST 710 / HIST 760 Doctoral Field Seminar in Canadian History\n\nRecent publications\n\n“‘The snipe were good and the wine not bad’: Enabling an Elite Male Public Life,” in Franca Iacovetta, Marlene Epp, and Valerie Korinek, eds., Edible Histories, Cultural Politics: Towards a Canadian Food History (University of Toronto Press, 2013)\n\n“The Games People Played: Tavern Entertainments and Public Life,” Ontario History, Special Issue on Entertainment, Autumn 2010, Vol. 102, Iss. 2: 154-74\n\nIn Mixed Company: Taverns and Public Life in Upper Canada (University of British Columbia Press 2009)\n\n“‘A Mixed Assemblage of Persons’: Race and Tavern Space in Upper Canada,” ed.
