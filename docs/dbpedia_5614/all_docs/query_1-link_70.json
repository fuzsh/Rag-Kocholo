        "text": "Julia Roberts has landed her next lead role on the big screen.\n\nMost recently seen contending with the end of civilisation in Leave the World Behind, the iconic actress will team up with Bones and All director Luca Guadagnino for an upcoming thriller titled After the Hunt.\n\nAn official logline reveals how a college professor (Roberts) \"finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when a star pupil levels an accusation against one of her colleagues\" (via Variety).\n\nRelated: Mission: Impossible 7 nearly included a digitally de-aged Julia Roberts\n\nAs she navigates this tricky situation, \"a dark secret from her own past threatens to come to light\".\n\nIndustry newcomer Nora Garrett is behind the script and will executive produce alongside Karen Lunder for Imagine Entertainment.\n\nAfter the Hunt joins a pile of tantalising Guadagnino projects, with the Italian filmmaker also set to shoot Separate Rooms with Josh O'Connor this year before finally releasing his Daniel Craig romance drama Queer.\n\nChallengers, starring Zendaya as a tennis coach, is coming to UK cinemas later this month too.\n\nRelated: Julia Roberts reflects on ex Matthew Perry's death and Friends on-set experience\n\nIn other news, Oscar-winning Erin Brockovich star Roberts admitted at the beginning of this year that she considered rejecting the role of Anna Scott in Notting Hill, due to how \"awkward\" it came across on the page.\n\nSpeaking to screenwriter Richard Curtis for British Vogue, she shared: \"Honestly, one of the hardest things I've ever had to do was your movie, playing a movie actress. I was so uncomfortable!\n\n\"I mean, we've talked about this so many times, but I almost didn't take the part because it just seemed â€” oh, it just seemed so awkward. I didn't even know how to play that person.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like"
