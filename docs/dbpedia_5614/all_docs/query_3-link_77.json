        "text": "When Julia Roberts met her husband Daniel Moder, she felt a \"seismic shift\".\n\nThe pair, who fell in love on the set of the 2001 action movie The Mexican, were inseparable from the moment they met. She told The Goop Podcast in 2018 that he gave her an \"indescribable\" feeling.\n\n\"[Meeting him] was the first, my life will never be the same [moment] in the most incredible, indescribable way,\" she confessed. \"It's some kind of alchemy. He truly to this day, to this minute, is just my favourite human... We're so lucky in that way, we just really, really like each other.\"\n\nWatch this clip of Ellen DeGeneres turning Julia Roberts into a Kardashian. Post continues after video.\n\nVideo via YouTube.\n\nThe couple celebrated their 21st wedding anniversary on July 4 and have worked together on at least half a dozen projects. It's the way they prefer it, with seven weeks being the longest time they've ever spent apart from each other.\n\nWhile Roberts has had the type of career many actors could only dream of — having won an Academy Award, a BAFTA, and three Golden Globe Awards — she admits the work doesn't \"consume\" her.\n\n\"By the time we had kids, I had accomplished things and felt secure about that part of my life,\" the actor explained to Wall Street Journal in 2014. \"I was so joyful moving into the family phase of my life in a sincere way.\"\n\nRoberts admitted the chance to step away from acting and take care of her kids was an \"incredible luxury,\" but after 18 years of non-stop travelling from one film set to another, she felt like she'd won the right.\n\n\"I had earned that time to do whatever I want to do with it, with these new people in our house,\" she told Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nDespite having a life in the limelight, she shied away from it all after the birth of Hazel and Finn — so much so, that it took her kids a few years to realise she was famous.\n\n\"I don't think they will ever have a true sense of that,\" the 55-year-old acknowledged in Harper's Bazaar. \"I think I told you once when they were starting to figure it out, it was like, 'You're famous?' And I said, 'I think a lot of people might have seen the movie that I'm in or might know who I am.\"'\n\n\"We're just grateful for the sense we have of being like any other family down the street,\" she continued. \"I don't question it, frankly.\"\n\nIn 2022, Roberts starred in Ticket To Paradise with longtime friend and fellow actor George Clooney.\n\nRoberts' favourite days though are the ones where she is surrounded by her kids.\n\n\"There are some days when as soon as you've finished cooking breakfast and cleaning up the kitchen, it's time to start lunch and by the time you've done that you're doing dinner and thinking there has to be a menu we can order from,\" Roberts told the U.K.'s Telegraph in 2009.\n\n\"But then there are some days when it's just so creative and so much fun and my kids will help me and, as with anybody who's a mom or a wife,\" she continued. \"It just becomes a part of your day. Some days it's super-fun and some days it's a chore.\"\n\nShe also likes to keep her kids' lives as normal as possible, despite once being the highest-paid actress and one of the most famous women in Hollywood.\n\n\"My husband and I are very aligned on that front and I think that we live a very normal experience with our children,\" Roberts explained on ITV's Lorraine in 2019.\n\n\"I mean, obviously we have advantages that we didn't have as children, but I think that's the unique part of it, coming from the kind of childhood that I had,\" she continued. \"I raise my kids now — I don't want them to have some of the struggles that I had, but at the same time, you do need to know how to make your bed and how to do your laundry, and how to be able to make one meal.\"\n\nThe actor went on to say she wants her three teens to \"have their own experience\" and \"run their own race\".\n\n\"These are important life skills, and so you have to weigh the differences between what you look at as some of the hardships that I had, or things that I missed out on as a kid, but also they have to run their own race,\" she said.\n\nWhile Roberts and Moder prefer to keep their kids out of the limelight, their daughter Hazel got to have her own red carpet moment at the Cannes Film Festival on July 21, alongside her father.\n\nThe pair were there for the screening of the film Flag Day, which was directed by Sean Penn. The director of photography was Moder.\n\nRoberts' next project is the psychological thriller film Leave the World Behind. The actor plays 'Amanda' who is on a family vacation in Long Island when interrupted by two strangers who bear the news of a mysterious blackout.\n\nShe stars alongside Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la Herrold, Farrah Mackenzie, Charlie Evans, and Kevin Bacon.\n\nIt is her second movie project in the last five years.\n\nNevertheless, Roberts' favourite character is the role she plays in her children's lives. It's one she's grateful took on.\n\n\"There's no way to describe it without sounding sappy or ridiculous because everything in my mind ends with an exclamation point,\" she told InStyle.\n\n\"And the thing is, we have these three human beings who are just a complete reflection of the affection we have for each other.\"\n\nFeature Image: Instagram/@juliaroberts/@modermoder.\n\nThis article was originally published on July 6, 2023 and has since been updated with new information.\n\nCalling all Holidaymakers!
