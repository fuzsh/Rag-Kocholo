        "text": "AKA Julie Fiona Roberts\n\nBorn: 28-Oct-1967\n\nBirthplace: Smyrna, GA\n\nGender: Female\n\nReligion: Hindu\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Pretty Woman\n\nAs a child, she was Julie Roberts, mocked for her string-bean physique, thick glasses, and toothy grin. Her parents divorced when she was in kindergarten, and her father died when she was 10. In adolescence she switched to contact lenses and bloomed to beautiful, and to match her new look she asked friends to call her \"Julia\" instead of \"Julie\". After high school, she moved to New York and spent a few years modeling, selling shoes, and working at an ice cream stand. At 19, she landed her first film role, a tiny part in a raunchy R-rated comedy of sexual harassment, Firehouse. At 20, she played bass and sang back-up behind Justine Bateman in Satisfaction, a barely watchable comedy about a big-hair all-girl rock-n-roll cover band. Her first film worth remembering was Mystic Pizza (1988), a comedy about three teens working at a small-town pizza parlor.\n\nShe played the doomed bride Shelby in Steel Magnolias (1989), opposite Oscar winners Shirley MacLaine, Sally Field, and Olympia Dukakis. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and suddenly became Hollywood's new \"It\" girl. In Pretty Woman (1990), she played a Disneyfied prostitute, falling for client Richard Gere. The film was a shallow, predictable, and utterly unbelievable fairy tale that managed to earn $178 million in America, establishing Roberts as a major star. Typical of her films are Notting Hill with Hugh Grant and Erin Brockovich with Albert Finney. She was reportedly paid $20 million for Brockovich, making Roberts the highest-paid female film starlet of all time.\n\nRoberts has had a wild romantic life. She broke an engagement to Kiefer Sutherland, calling off the wedding mere days before the scheduled ceremony in 1991, when she heard that Sutherland had been unfaithful to her. She was whispered to have had a nervous breakdown in the aftermath, and ended up in the arms of actor Jason Patric. She was married to the singer Lyle Lovett for two years, and spent three years dating actor Benjamin Bratt. She is now married to a camera operator.\n\nRoberts was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress for Pretty Woman, and won the honor for Erin Brockovich. She is booked to appear on Broadway in a 2006 production of Three Days of Rain, and she has recorded voice work for two upcoming cartoons, Charlotte's Web and Ant Bully. There are rumors that she may retire from Hollywood to raise her twins, born in 2004.\n\nFor years, Roberts was quiet about politics, but she began speaking out after the Bush administration came to power in 2001. She described Bush as \"embarrassing\", and said, \"He's not my president. He will never be my president\".\n\nFather: Walter Roberts (b. 1933, stage actor, d. 1977, throat cancer)\n\nMother: Betty Lou Roberts (b. 1934, real estate agent, d. 19-Feb-2015 lung cancer)\n\nFather: Michael Motes (stepfather)\n\nBrother: Eric Roberts (actor, b. 1956)\n\nSister: Lisa Roberts Gillan (actress, b. 1965)\n\nSister: Nancy Motes (half sister, b. 19-May-1975, d. 9-Feb-2014 drug overdose)\n\nBoyfriend: Liam Neeson (actor, dated late 1980s)\n\nBoyfriend: Richard Gere (actor, dated 1989)\n\nBoyfriend: Dylan McDermott (actor, dated 1989)\n\nBoyfriend: Kiefer Sutherland (broken engagement in 1991)\n\nBoyfriend: Jason Patric (actor, dated 1991-92)\n\nHusband: Lyle Lovett (singer, dated 1992-93, m. 25-Jun-1993, div. 22-Mar-1995)\n\nBoyfriend: Ethan Hawke (actor, dated mid-1990s)\n\nBoyfriend: Matthew Perry (actor, dated mid-1990s)\n\nBoyfriend: Daniel Day-Lewis (actor, dated mid-1990s)\n\nBoyfriend: Benjamin Bratt (actor, dated 1998-2001)\n\nHusband: Danny Moder (cameraman, b. 1969, dated 2001-02, m. 4-Jul-2002, three children)\n\nDaughter: Hazel Patricia Moder (b. 28-Nov-2004, twin)\n\nSon: Phinnaeus Walter Moder (b. 28-Nov-2004, twin)\n\nSon: Henry Daniel Moder (b. 18-Jun-2007)\n\nHigh School: Campbell High School, Smyrna, GA (1985)\n\nEndorsement of AOL\n\nEndorsement of Avon (2006)\n\nEndorsement of Lavazza Coffee (2010)\n\nBaskin-Robbins clerk, New York City\n\nCaribou Club\n\nNervous Breakdown\n\nConverted to Hinduism\n\nOscar for Best Actress 2001 for Erin Brockovich\n\nGolden Globe 1990 for Steel Magnolias\n\nGolden Globe 1991 for Pretty Woman\n\nGolden Globe 2001 for Erin Brockovich\n\nRisk Factors: Former Smoker, Marijuana, Yoga\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nBen Is Back (8-Sep-2018)\n\nWonder (14-Nov-2017)\n\nSmurfs: The Lost Village (23-Mar-2017) [VOICE]\n\nMoney Monster (12-May-2016)\n\nMother's Day (13-Apr-2016)\n\nSecret in Their Eyes (12-Nov-2015)\n\nThe Normal Heart (25-May-2014)\n\nAugust: Osage County (9-Sep-2013)\n\nMirror Mirror (15-Mar-2012)\n\nLarry Crowne (30-Jun-2011) · Mercedes Tainot\n\nLove, Wedding, Marriage (3-Jun-2011) · Ava's Therapist [VOICE]\n\nEat Pray Love (13-Aug-2010) · Liz Gilbert\n\nValentine's Day (10-Feb-2010) · Capt.
