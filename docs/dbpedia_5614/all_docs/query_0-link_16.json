DATE : 10/28/2001\n\nUnfortunately this year I didn’t manage to set up a birthday page like I did last year – I wasn’t even in the country to change the site for Julia’s birthday! Some fan I am. Oh well – Happy belated Birthday Julia! 🙂 I’ll make it up.\n\nStepan\n\nUpdate DATE : 08/07/2001\n\nHello folks – I’m doing my best to find the time to update the site regularly, however sometimes this seems impossible due to my busy schedule. Once again I’d like to ask support in regard to gathering all the news, which for me, is the most time consuming activity.\n\nAlso I hope to find some time to put together a birthday page for Ms. Roberts’ upcoming birthday & am organizing a birthday project. For more information on this, please send a request to birthday@juliarobertsonline.com and you’ll receive instructions on how to take part on this project.\n\nThanks for your visit and be sure to come back soon!\n\nJuliaRobertsOnline webmaster\n\nSite news & additions DATE : 08/09/2001\n\n• Added a php polling system.\n\n• Full update front-page information\n\n• Working on automatisation of news-content updates & filmography\n\n• Due to a bug in the script for the links area, I’ve lost most of the links. I’ll be fixing this soon, probably by using a more reliable php/mySQL linkengine.\n\nAll HOT newsitems (no rumours / hear-say please) and other items are mostly welcome at submissions@juliarobertsonline.com\n\nThanks for visiting and your patience.\n\n|news archive|\n\nUpdate DATE : 05/11/2001\n\n• next news update will be on Saturday May 12 2001\n\n• Newsletter for May is issued for this weekend (12-13 May 2001), so keep an eye on your mailbox.\n\nYou might just enjoy my next excuse folks – I was out of the country and since this is still ONLY a fansite and not an official site, I can not give this priority over work and/or other social responsibilities. Ironically enough, on the weekend of my birthday (14 may – well pretty close after the weekend anyway) I’ll have some time to devote to the site and do some updates on it. So don’t lose your nerves and while (if) you wait, just surf to the MTV’s Movie Awards 2001 site and vote for Julia and ‘Erin Brockovich’. Thanks for the patience.\n\nNote… DATE : 03/26/2001\n\nWelcome and thanks for visiting. First of all, to all the people that kept coming back, without seeing any updated news, my deepest apologies. I could rant on about the reasons for that, but after all, you have not come here to read about my life story, so I’ll leave it at lack of time due work and some other issues that simply had higher priorities.\n\nThe coming days, I will try to update at least the news section and biography, so the information is current again. I’d like to thank Marjorie and Mary Pat in advance for offering their help, I appreciate that a lot!\n\nWell folks, that’s all for now – I better not waste any time, few more hours before Julia will walke up that stage and pick up her Oscar, which she deserves more then anyone else!\n\nSite news & additions DATE : 05/19/2000\n\nCheck out the ‘biography’ section. Currently I’m processing all the data of Julia’s filmography, all the 40 entries should be up this weekend. If you have any suggestions as to what fields/info (per movie) should be added, please drop me a note. I hope to have a messageboard up then as well."
