        "text": "Veteran actor Eric Roberts, who is Julia Roberts' older brother and Emma Roberts' father, is keeping mum on his famous family.\n\nWhen \"Still Here Hollywood\" podcast host and entertainment journalist Steve Kmetko asked how his sister was doing on the show's April 1 episode the \"Dark Knight\" actor replied, \"You'll have to ask her.\"\n\n\"I love my sister, but I can't talk about her. She don't want to talk about it,\" Roberts, 68, said. \"And also, my daughter told me not to talk about her, but I stumble and do. I'm not supposed to talk about either of them, but I do.\"\n\nThe interview started circulating social media three months after its release when the podcast shared a clip of Roberts gushing about Emma Roberts' talent on Instagram Monday.\n\nLater in the episode, when asked which actors he admires, the Oscar nominee replied, \"I'm in love with my daughter's work these days. Like, I can't believe how great she's become. I'm so proud of her I can't see straight.\"\n\nHe added, \"Since her performance in 'Maybe I Do' until right now, she overwhelms me with pride and just, 'Oh my god, here she goes again!' And I'm just so happy to be her dad because she's kicking ass, and I'm so proud\"\n\n\"Maybe I Do,\" released January 2023, co-stars Diane Keaton, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and William H. Macy.\n\n'So uncomfortable': Why Julia Roberts almost turned down 'Notting Hill'\n\nEric Roberts denies helping daughter Emma Roberts' career\n\nRoberts, who has over 700 acting credits including 1985's \"Runaway Train\" and 2022's \"Babylon\" to his name, does not take any responsibility for Emma Roberts' successful career.\n\nHe said he has \"absolutely nothing\" to do with her Hollywood roles. \"Except I gave her that name.\"\n\nEmma Roberts, who grew up visiting Julia Roberts on set, broke out as the star of the 2004-2007 Nickelodeon series \"Unfabulous.\" She's gone on to act in \"Scream Queens,\" \"American Horror Story\" and \"Madame Web.\"\n\nShe also stars in the Amazon movie \"Space Cadet,\" a comedy in which she plays a bartender who was admitted to an astronaut training program under false pretenses. Her co-stars include Gabrielle Union and Tom Hopper.\n\nMore: 'Space Cadet' star Emma Roberts on her fear of flying and her next 'thriller' movie\n\nIn an interview with Flaunt magazine published last week, the 33-year-old actor rejected the \"nepo baby\" label for children of celebrities who have seemingly benefitted from their family's industry connections.\n\n\"I’ve lost more jobs than I’ve gained from being in the business,\" Roberts said. \"People have opinions and sometimes maybe they’re not good opinions of people in your family. I’ve never gotten a job because of it; I know I definitely have lost a couple of jobs because of it.\""
