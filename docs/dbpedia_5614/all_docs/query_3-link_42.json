Sidestepping the 80s “Brat Pack,” the actress’ early role in 1988’s Mystic Pizza was followed with an Oscar nomination for 1989’s Steel Magnolias, and the 1990 prostitute-with-a-heart-of-gold hit Pretty Woman. She has since starred in movies including Ocean’s 11, Notting Hill, Eat Pray Love, and Erin Brockovich, for which she won a Best Actress Oscar. Before settling down into her now relatively quiet lifestyle, Roberts grabbed media attention for her high-profile Hollywood love life. Previously engaged to Kiefer Sutherland, she broke it off in the early 90s to be with Jason Patric. She later eloped with Lyle Lovett, divorcing him in 1995. She has also been linked to Matthew Perry, Daniel Day-Lewis, Liam Neeson, and Benjamin Bratt, but is now happily married to cameraman Danny Moder. Together, they have twins, Hazel and Phinnaeus, and a son, Henry Daniel.",
