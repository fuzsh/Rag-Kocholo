        "text": "For TV viewers like me who still haven’t cut the cord, here is a selection of cable and network shows, movies and specials broadcasting Monday through Sunday, March 11-16. Details and times are subject to change.\n\nMonday\n\nLAKEFRONT EMPIRE 10 p.m. on HGTV. This new real estate series takes viewers to Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks, a Midwestern vacation destination made famous by the Netflix show “Ozark.” This series follows a group of realtors, including Peggy Albers, who often talks about her remarkable turnaround from serving more than 15 years in federal prison for selling methamphetamine to becoming a successful agent at the lake.\n\nTuesday\n\nTHE LIONHEART 9 p.m. on HBO. Dan Wheldon was best known by his nickname, “The Lionheart,” and won the Indianapolis 500 twice. In a tragic accident, he died in a crash in 2011 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. This documentary blends archival and present-day footage to tell the story of Wheldon’s sons, Sebastian and Oliver, who have since followed their father’s footsteps and entered the world of racing.\n\nPASSWORD 10 p.m. on NBC. This game show, which originally aired in the 1960s on CBS, is coming back for its second season, with Keke Palmer as host and Jimmy Fallon as a panelist. This season will feature guest stars, including Chance the Rapper, Howie Mandel and Joe Manganiello, playing the game that is a mix between charades and telephone.\n\nWednesday\n\nTHE AMAZING RACE 9:30 p.m. on CBS. It’s hard to believe that this reality competition series premiered in 2001, just as iPods and iTunes were introduced. As for 36 seasons now, teams of two will embark on heart-racing challenges around the world for a cash prize of $1 million.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
