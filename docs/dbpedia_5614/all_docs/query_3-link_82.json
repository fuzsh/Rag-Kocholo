        "text": "Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967) is an American actress. She became a Hollywood star after headlining the 1990 romantic comedy Pretty Woman, which grossed $464 million worldwide. After receiving Academy Award nominations for Steel Magnolias in 1990 and Pretty Woman in 1991, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2001 for her performance in Erin Brockovich. Her films My Best Friend's Wedding, Mystic Pizza, Notting Hill, Runaway Bride, Valentine's Day, The Pelican Brief, Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve have collectively brought box office receipts of over $2.4 billion, making her one of the most successful actors in terms of box office receipts.\n\nIn \"Dammit Janet!\", Lois Griffin claims she's seen one of her \"crappy movies\" 47 times while in a lavatory with Peter.\n\nShe loves herself more than anything else in the world, according to a cutaway in \"Peterotica\", where during a charity event for the 2004 Indonesian tsunami victims, she talks about how everyone should be happy that she survived the tsunami, before hugging herself and saying it was all about \"ME\" in an increasingly disturbing voice.\n\nThe extended cut of \"Friends of Peter G\" features a trivia question before the film asking who is the star of Pretty Woman with a live-action profile."
