        "text": "August 16, 2024\n\nan editor! an editor! my kingdom for a f*cking editor!\n\n(no kingdoms were harmed in the making of this review)\n\n˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩\n\ni am what some sexist pigs would call a basic bitch. if you give me a tall, dark-haired, sarcastic, morally-grey guy in a romantasy that combines some of my favourite books and tropes - whilst still keeping some sense of originality, i'll be content.\n\nthis book had all of that. (well, the tall-dark-haired-mmc-in-a-romantasy part)\n\nexcluding the originality. (and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)\n\nlauren said powerless was “if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”\n\n…\n\nsee, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.\n\n(and i know i’m the myopic bitch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)\n\nin fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.\n\nbut before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that, then scroll away. do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite frankly hilarious stupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to delete after screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.\n\nanyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing.\n\nfor a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash.\n\nit read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy.\n\nand serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable prince krabs kai is, when i should just be able to infer from what the author implies. except the author didn't imply anything, for fuck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.\n\non top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes.\n\nif you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes:\n\nknife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid shit that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)\n\nnow it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3\n\n➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl - mhm wow what a great idea, it's totally not going to get your dumb ass killed. aaand now they’re playing thumb war. sorry are we sure this dude is the future enforcer?\n\n➳ “what i should have done was laugh in his face before making him go down the staircase first, but i’ve thrown caution to the wind and hastily replaced it with curiosity.”\n\nyeahhh great idea, go down a dark, damp, dank, dirty, dusty, secret stairway with a guy you're not even sure you should trust. greaaat idea!!\n\n➳ “it’s really quite simple,” calum says. “the majority of us will finally all gather together, and we’ll show the people of ilya who we are and what we have to say. show them that we are not a threat while also reminding them of who they have been killing for decades. the king is going to have to either admit his lies about the ordinaries or simply give us our freedom. and you are going to help us do it.”\n\nahhh yess so simple - it totally won't lead to a bunch of deaths, lies, revelations, and another book.\n\n➳ “i can practically hear sadie blink behind me. she’s clearly stunned by his lack of concern, especially after seeing the two of us dancing together only minutes ago. i would be stunned myself if i wasn’t so used to seeing his masks—if i didn’t recognize the cold one he’s just slipped on.”\n\nevery.romantasy.ever because GOD FORBID A MAN SHOW HIS FEELINGS\n\n➳ “yes, we are opponents. yes, i am the future enforcer. yes, I’m a killer that has no right to want to keep her. but there is something else, something that has her refusing to admit this confusing connection we share.”\n\nwannabe mafia lord who?\n\n➳ “something begins burning inside of me, but I ignore it, not bothering to acknowledge the jealousy painting me Ilya’s kingdom color.”\n\ni- ..no comment\n\n➳ oh, but little miss paedyn gray over here was no better. every part about her needed a special mention (or two). even her ass!\n\n“as soon as my ass got numb from sitting on that bloody stump, i stood and paced circles around our camp before splashing cold water from the creek on my face and body. then my ass got cold, and i moved next to the fire to lie down on the hard ground i’m so familiar with.”\n\nnarcissism who?? this was my daily reminder as to why fictional ya books don’t include the part where they have to deal with bodily functions out in the wild.\n\n➳ and in regards to the trials aspect, it had no real point. our only explanation was that the elites were being killed off in an arena to display their oh-so-original powers despite us constantly being that the elites' lives were more valuable. what the fuck?? someone introduce this author to world-building immediately. it would have been much more understandable if it were all the ordinaries to battle to the death, (despite this already drawing a lot from the hunger games) and then you get your one oh-so-precious girl who goes through a makeover, has two guys lusting after her yada yada yada [insert all your favourite 2010 dystopian references here]. i honestly wouldn’t have even minded it, and i would have eaten it up immediately.\n\n➳ if anyone is interested in more of my points, i wrote a very long paragraph in message 192 on page 4 of the comments section below. it's also one of the many pages where you can find me breaking my promise to myself to not respond to idiots on the internet\n\nmoving on, let’s go back to paedyn seeing as my love for her runs so deep!\n\nshe’s katniss’s not-like-other-girls cousin who decides to insult the fuck out of you the minute you’re stood in a 2-mile radius to any guy. i wanted to claw her eyes out when she began with her “play the part shit” - which i’m pretty sure was ripping off the selection, which starred our just as talented, just as flawless america singer!, who by the way is a singer. from the dollar tree.\n\nANYWAY, according to this very unbiased book, miss paypal over here had exactly 0 flaws. her only weakness was her infinite love for others, which was clearly evidenced when her seamstress friend is introduced yet barely ever mentioned. when our “darling” pae finally realises that she forgot about her after she was whisked away to the palace to become a princess overnight, she has the audacity to ignore her the entire time because she's too busy fawning over prince kahoot. *sigh* don’t you just love our 2012 wattpad heroine!\n\nnow for prince krabs! yay! honestly he was the funniest character in the book by far. his lines weren’t just cheesy and cringey, they were downright stupid too! he really is the whole package *swoons*\n\nhe was bland as fuck omg. and annoying. very annoying. the only thing he ever managed to kill was my sanity. he’s also managed to ruin the word “darling” for me forever, which is yk, great. morally-grey my ass, he's a walmart kaz (insulting to kaz but still). he has no true redeeming qualities, and for that reason i quite frankly believe that him and pea-brain really deserve each other!\n\n(i was going to do a section on the side-characters, but considering the amount of brain cells i have already lost just by recounting the so-called “personalities” of the two love-birds above, i don’t think that will be the best thing to do right now. however, when i figure out how to regenerate my axons and dendrites, i will be back.)\n\n˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩\n\nafter this rather long paragraph ends, there will be tons of spoilers for the selection series (which i don’t recommend reading), the red queen (didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, just indifferent), the hunger games (if you haven’t read this yet, then what the hell are you doing with your life?), and a few mentions of the shatter me series (which is regarded by some as the greatest piece of literature and by others - me - as the greatest piece of dog sh*t that was dropped into this world), the darkest mind series (i’ve never read it), and the jasad heir (i enjoyed it). if you don’t want to be spoiled (although not all the similarities are spoilers, i just couldn't be asked to mark the ones that are) then you can skip to the bottom of this review where you will see a funny gif i found that pretty much sums up my personal experience with powerless. update: there is now a bonus section at the end (before the funny gif) with books that are similar/give the same vibes as powerless. note: i have not read all of these so please don't kill me if i'm wrong about any. if you have any info you want me to add then leave me a comment/dm\n\nyes, i realise that i have missed out on so many here\n\nthe selection:\n\n➳ illéa ilya\n\n➳ a girl from the slums and from an undesirable position in society that rose up in the ranks\n\n➳ our fmc has different colour dress to everyone else\n\n➳ all the scenes where they're eating food\n\n➳ the queen likes the dancing in the balls\n\n➳ the balls\n\n➳ the safe room stuff that i’m not asked to go into detail about\n\n➳ the girl on girl hate -

i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!!\n\n➳ kai: the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!!\n\n— what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭\n\n➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮‍💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!!\n\n”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”\n\n— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.\n\n— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect.\n\nthis book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\n4 stars\n\n'Who did this to you' BOY 'why do you care' GIRL.\n\nThis book is literally a romcom with action scenes in it! It was not screaming FANTASY much, but I still enjoyed it a lot! This story was quite interesting, and I can't compare it with Hunger Games because I haven't read that series, but it gave me Shatter Me vibes (as in powers and some scenes)\n\n• Kingdom of Ilya is divided into two types of groups, ELITES (with powers) and ORDINARIES (powerless). Elites were gifted with different powers because of a PLAGUE, and the ordinaries were banished from the Kingdom because they're rumored to lessen the powers of the elites!\n\nThe plot was plotting and IT WAS SO GOOD 😌 though, this book had a lot of repetition (flirting and banter), and was def tropey, it is still SO CUTE! The ending was so angsty, and I DAMN WELL KNOW THAT THE NEXT BOOK IS GONNA BE FULL OF ANGST!😭\n\nKai Azer — PRINCE WHO KILLS PEOPLE WITH NO POWER, BUT IS OBSESSED WITH THE GIRL WHO'S POWERLESS!!!!! What else do you want??? He's so hot for fuck's sake! 😭\n\nDark hairs, Gray eyes with loose black shirts, cocky smirk AND DIMPLES. 😮‍💨\n\nThe reason this was more rom-com type to me because he was so flirty! He was so gentle and sweet with her. He so selflessly helped her so many times without caring about himself and constantly teased and had fun with her. like letting her pin him with a dagger to the throat, silently asking permission to touch her, braiding her hair, dancing with her, doing anything to protect her life, counting her freckles, stayed awake whole night just to watch her and being affected with just her putting her finger on him! jakshsjssb 😭😭 and...... HE WROTE ON HIS HAND \"she said I can touch her when I'm sober\" WHEN HE WAS DRUNK 😭🧎‍♀️\n\nHis character was kinda giving Aaron Warner vibes because HE'S A FREAKING WIELDER (he can wield anyone's power if they are near) also MAJOR DADDY ISSUES 👺\n\nPaedyn Gray — I'm sorry but EW NAME 💀 She was cool, the way her fighting is described is amazing, and it was easy to imagine! How she fought and no doubt she was pretty strong and amazing on the fighting aspect and how she was trained so perfectly. Her backstory and all didn't quite hit me much just like Kai's.\n\n❝Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?❞ yes she will LITERALLY and FIGURATIVELY! 👺\n\nShe has both the prince (Kai and his brother - kitt) wrapped around her finger. THEY BOTH ARE SO SMITTEN 😭, and she was also trying to make Kai her enemy in the start, and ngl prettyyy forced, but glad they lost sight of that lol! I'm so glad she wasn't horny and was pretty annoyed with Kai and wanted nothing with him! Her being attracted to him didn't happen quickly, rather it developed slowly but nicely.\n\nI won't say that her wearing a different color to a ball (where everyone wore green) was pick me Hermione Granger vibes lol, but it was definitely cool of her though! Also, SHE'S THE MAIN CHARACTER SO LET HER SHINE!\n\nHer saying 'Gonna stab you in the heart' was literally the 288262th time. She's Vicious little thing as he called her. (reminded me of Violet)\n\n❝They chose me to die. And all because I saved that prick of a prince.❞\n\n• Pae is a thief, and she robbed Kai when he visited the town, and Kai was drawn to her because of the fact that he couldn't sense any power from her. Then she saved Kai from a Silencer (one who diminishes power), She caught the eye of everyone as the silver savior, and got selected for Purging Trials — where different trials are taken place for an elite to win. And this year, Kai is a part of them! Now she has to figure out how to SURVIVE because she's without power.\n\nThe whole trials plot was good, but everything was a bit descriptive, and the story was falling into repetition (flirting, banter, and fluff only), and the trials were interesting, but the pace of each of them was different. One taking a lot of chapters, and the other ending in just 3.\n\nMany errors in it so the author should def change her editor otherwise everything was fine. This series has a lot of potential!\n\nI can't wait for book 2 ughhhh 😭 I. WANT. THAT. BOOK.

The romance was suchhhh a slow burn and had sooo much tension. I'm obsessed. And the way its sooo forbidden romance😍\n\nAnd I think the fantasy world is really interesting. The book is super fast paced. And the trials were giving me the hunger games in the best way. AND THE WAY THE BOOK ENDED! I need to read book 2 asap. and i just KNOW the wait for book 3 is going to be torture.\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\nThat ending hurt. A lot.\n\n*deep breath* Okay let's get started with the review.\n\nI absolutely adored this book. The world created is so mesmerizing. The characters and storyline are so compelling. Both the leads- Paedyn and Kai are lovable. I'll be honest, this book is not perfect but I enjoyed it regardless.\n\n✔️ Magic system\n\n✔️ Forbidden romance\n\n✔️ Angsty slow burn\n\n✔️ Mutual pining\n\n✔️ Knife to the throat\n\n✔️ Tending to scars\n\n✔️ \"Who did this to you?\"\n\n✔️ He kills for her\n\nThe book imo starts off a tad slow but it's completely understandable as we are getting to know the world, the fantasy elements and the characters. It picks up pace towards the middle and stays consistent.\n\nAn issue I had with this book and which is why it wasn't a perfect read for me is the fact that it reminded me TOO MUCH of The Hunger Games. I appreciate when authors take inspiration from a book and make something new with it but the first half of this book was a bit too much replication. This is not to damper anyone's expectations but rather give a realistic approach. I still enjoyed it quite a lot which you can see from my updates but it would have been perfect had this issue not existed.\n\nI absolutely LOVED the characters and the complexities that came with them. Kai and Paedyn were imperfectly perfect. They have so much depth and life to them, it was hard to resist them.\n\nKai is going straight to my book boyfriends list. The man is capable of making me swoon and feel things by merely saying a few words and they don't even have to be romantic. He radiates such energy, charisma, and obviously his powers intrigues me a lot. The way he is so smitten with Pae is everything. For him, she is the only girl in the room. For him, she is his and he'll do anything to keep her alive and safe.\n\nPaedyn is no less. She is fierce, equally charismatic and full of zeal and the woman knows how much power she holds in her flirtations, touches over Kai. Her confidence and the ability to stay strong is so impressive. I loved how she holds her own. She tried so hard to resist the charms of the prince and yet found herself wanting him more and I absolutely loved it.\n\nThe romance is deliciously angsty and slow burning. I get some people are on the surface cause it's YA and don't really want to give it a go cause of that but believe me you're gonna be missing out on the beauty of these two and their intense chemistry. I didn't find myself yearning for spice, everything about these two hit perfectly and I wouldn't change a thing about it at all.\n\nThe side characters, Kitt in particular, are deeply complex. I saw him destined to become the king that he did at the end, from the beginning. It didn't come as a surprise. I found myself sympathizing with him and Kai more so for Pae. I don't mind Kitt becoming someone he wasn't meant to be, it's going to make things immensely interesting. Jax and A were my other favourites.\n\nThe ending was predictable imo. I saw it coming ages ago so although I wasn't completely shocked, it was still impactful and made me excited to read the next one.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable read and one I absolutely love. It has the potential of becoming my favorite series but will see how the next books go 😉 What y'all waiting for? Give it a read!!\n\nLike Powerless? Read these-\n\n1. The Hunger Games\n\n2. Spark of the Everflame (Kindred's Curse)\n\n3. The Serpent and the Wings of Night (Crowns of Nyaxia)\n\n~•~•~\n\nIT'S TIME Y'ALL! LET'S GOOO\n\nFebruary 20, 2024\n\ndnf p.308\n\ndo you ever have the feeling while reading that a book is trying too hard to be something it isn’t?\n\nto phrase it simply 'powerless' has zero originally in it. the book is a replica of many popular books, such as The Hunger Games, but make it a cheap and bland AliExpress version. it consisted of recycled scenes jam-packed with tropes that the author was unable to mold to enhance and improve the storyline with. In the end, it appeared that she desperately attempted to sew and combine multiple clichéd scenes to force the protagonists to be in a sort of forced proximity. & it simply did not blend well because the final patchwork felt everything but spontaneous.\n\nwhile the intrigue was compelling enough to dive into the book at first, the unclear and blurry world building made it quite boring after a few chapters. I was under the impression that the author would simplify and distill explanations throughout the story. (how many powers there’s in the wild, for exemple.) but the main question that puzzled the entirety of the book was 'why the trials?'. i believed it was ancestral, but it wasn't. we were not given a concret clarification of why they had to go through them. (solely for the sake of money? sure.)\n\nthe writing was mediocre to say the least, with an abondance of ”blue eyes\" not very well dispatched in the narrative. repetitive expressions that clearly underline that the author needs to urgently change editors. the predictability in the dialogues was a major issue for me. It appeared that Kai and Pae were constantly attempting to make the most stereotypical comments. even the king's speeches were not as majestic as they should have been.\n\nthe lack of depth in the characters was the primary reason for my difficulty in going through these 500 pages. why didn't the author incorporate any other colors into Pae's character other than her still mourning her deceased father? or to Kai to aspire to be more than the future enforcer ? all he does is complain and mop about his obligation to kill people and his brother's inability to handle it if the roles where inversed. instead of it being a well depicted enemies to lovers with good character’s wisdom and portrayal it just wavered into them already thinking about each other in a romantic way. all that because the narrative forced them to spend a lot of time with each other. how do you persuade readers to want to continue a trilogy when they aren't that attached to the protagonists in the first place?\n\n⚠️⚠️⚠️\n\nspoilers\n\ni did not sign for a love triangle.\n\nthe way pae inlassably brought up her father’s death and how Kai made strange comments about his first murder seemed like he killed her father not the king.\n\n——-\n\nhere we go..\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nyou should know i’m honest to my core when i tell you that i love the author - i think she is an angel of a human being - but i really did not love her book. tragic considering i went in expecting to enjoy it. one day i will stop getting bamboozled by this exact variety of tiktok hype but that day is apparently not today!!!\n\nsimilar to the hunger games i guess if you are ok with nothing making in-universe sense and the reasoning behind it all being “🤷‍♀️ i dunno, vibes?” instead of a thoughtful critique of capitalism, commodification, and spectacle.\n\ni think i could have gotten past that though (not everything has to be that serious lmfao i am an ali hazelwood fan…i would be throwing stones from a GLASS HOUSE) but the writing was just so over the top and longwinded-but-also-average-fanfiction-vibes in a way that is difficult to capture in a review but that you’d get right away reading the book. it is this very specific style where the author says something, and then says it again but with other words that start with the same letters, and then the sentence has ~parallelism~ but also it is so obviously baked in that it loses any impact. like: \"she was Bold and Beautiful and Beyond my Bountiful expectations.\" but x1000 all throughout the book. i found it pretty hard to get through by the end.\n\nwith that said - i am but one (1) girl, this is a minority opinion. most people i trust online like this book. i think if the writing style doesn’t bother you this could be mindlessly fun a la fourth wing. it doesn't take itself particularly seriously. the central relationship is very slow burn and has ample yearning/a decent foundation - though it is quite instalove in terms of their individual feelings, NOT legitimate enemies to lovers (they like each other lmao) and the banter (much like the writing) is often over the top. the story has a mountain of cliches - but they are cliches for a reason. sometimes you just want something silly that is full of all of your guilty pleasure tropes. this was not my experience. but it could be yours, and i hope lauren keeps writing!!!\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\n3 stars\n\nit’s time to be honest.\n\nlet me start by saying that i didn’t (and still don’t) know who lauren is on booktok. so this review is unbiased as possible. 🫶🏻 (please don’t forget that a 3 stars isn’t a bad rating either.)\n\nthe first half of this book was nearly a copy and paste of the hunger games. while some readers probably want that, it took away from originality for me. i could NOT stop comparing for storyline. (i have not read red queen, so i can’t compare to that one.)\n\npowerless has every popular romantasy trope possible. you may love that and feel fulfilled by that. i do enjoy certain tropes, but relying on tropes leaves a lot of world-building and natural character development to be desired.\n\nthe writing wasn’t bad, but the typos were. though they don’t detract directly from the storyline, noticing one always pulls me out of a book a bit. hire a new editor lauren, you deserve better!!! 🩶\n\nthere was so. much. tension. if men said the things in real life that kai says to paedyn, we would have no need for romance books. however, there was so much tension and banter to the point of becoming repetitive and literally putting me into a reading slump. (kind of a me problem, too, but i’m going to put a little blame on the book.)\n\ni think lauren has a lot of growth ahead as an author and i mean that as a compliment. i do look forward to the next book and really hope for a more natural story (not too trope-y) with more original development in the storyline. there is SO MUCH potential here.\n\n(last, sara carrolli and haley pham both liked this book… so how could you not want to read it?🤭)\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\ndid i honestly read the same book as everyone else?!? because i seriously doubt it. nor do i think an editor did.\n\nthere is just no way i can give this 5 stars, like it seems to be getting left and right. and heres why.\n\nthe lack of editing is seriously criminal for a big publisher like simon and schuster. so many continuity errors, so many grammar mistakes, so much awkward and unrealistic/unnatural dialogue from page 1, so many odd skips and jumps in the narrative. this honestly reads like a wattpad story that was hastily written and posted at 2am without a second thought.\n\nheres the thing though. these kinds of these can be overlooked and not take the reader out of the story IF the reader is thoroughly engaged. and i just wasnt. its not original by any means. ive read this kind of plot so many times before, it has so many overused tropes, and i could predict any sort of plot twist from the very beginning.\n\nso, because of my lack of interest in the story, the editing mistakes were the nail on the coffin that made me just not want to deal with this story any more. i didnt hate it, but its just not a book i would personally consider good or enjoyable.\n\nnot for me at all, but im happy so many people could overlook the writing issues and get hooked on the story!\n\n↠ 1 star\n\nJune 16, 2024\n\nUpdated Review:\n\nWow. I just want to say that I have been with Lauren since the beginning of her TikTok. I watched almost every live and I remember the day she said, “I’m gonna write a book.” It’s truly inspiring to see her hard work and creativity pay off.\n\nA decent debut in my opinion. For this being Lauren’s first book, I was impressed. It has a solid storyline and great characters. Overall, I didn’t hate it and can’t wait to see how the story will continue.\n\nI will say I wish the world building was more in depth and expanded, along with the characters. This story felt a lot like the Red Queen in terms of general plot but I did like her personal touch, however it was on the borderline of copying rather than “inspired by” if you know what I’m saying. I believe that this book and this world that Lauren has created has so much potential and I can’t wait to see what she does next.\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nslow burn romantic fantasies only done like this please!\n\ncan we talk about the drama this book has?? from the banter, pining, dancing, betrayal, and everything else… bruh i was on the edge of my bed. paedyn and kai are just that OTP!🖐🏽\n\nwhat gags me is the way kai is so utterly down bad for pae. like this dude can’t even function without her presence. and don’t even get me started on that nightmare scene!! “stay” girl i was about to summon the ancestral powers to get to him! 🫰🏽\n\ni’d internally scream whenever their romantic moments were interrupted. im glad their romance is being dragged out so that means book 2 is gonna fucking HIT me in the face!\n\nthe side characters, the resistance, the relationship with Adene and Paedyn. ate, ate, ate! reading this book felt like hitting the pentagon and i loved it !!🫦💋\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\nEDIT- 3.5 ⭐️ ok upon a reread I’m thinking it was more like wrong book wrong time, still didn’t love it like the majority though\n\nIf I wanted to read the hunger games I would have just picked that up instead\n\nAugust 19, 2023\n\nIf you like The Hunger Games and SO MUCH TENSION (!!!!!) you will love this. Give me the second one NOW!\n\nSeptember 13, 2023\n\nSuch an incredible and impressive debut novel!!! I need the second book now.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nI'm going to need 5-7 business days to digest that ending\n\nNovember 26, 2023\n\n∞ ⭐️ I will never recover. My favorite read of 2023 (aside from divine rivals 🤭) The tension between Pae & Kai??? 🥵 & now you’re telling me I have to wait until July for the next one??? Unwell.\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\ni've read fanfictions written by 12 year olds on wattpad with better plot than this\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\nTHE BANTER. THE TENSION. NOT ONE KISS !!!! THE EPILOGUE.\n\nNovember 26, 2023\n\nThe tension!!! The angst!!! Honestly I really enjoyed this book and had so much fun reading it. This is definitely not high fantasy (which I can’t do anyways 😅). Very much had a simple plot, was simple to understand and fun plot twist at the end!\n\nNovember 18, 2023\n\nI finished it. That's the nicest thing I can say about this book.\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n5 stars ˚ ༘ ೀ⋆｡˚\n\n⟶ my new favourite fantasy book <3\n\n💗“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.”💗\n\n*loud thud*\n\nyou hear that? that’s the sound of me jumping off the nearest cliff bc life simply isn’t worth living when kai azer is not in it.\n\n🌸 dedication to my loves 🌸\n\ni wanna start this review by thanking my (irl) best friend ever, raya, for forcing asking me to read this book <3\n\nif she didn’t basically shove this down my throat, i fear i never would’ve met the love of my life. and thank you, for listening to my endless rants, and responding everytime i spammed you at any and everything that happened. ilysm 😽🎀\n\nalso this was a br with anna, who i love and adore so so much hehehe ty for reading this with me pookie. GIGGLING WITH YOU ABOUT KAI WAS THE MOST FUN THING EVER 😩 he’s just too perfect i’m glad we could admire him and enjoy this book together 🙁🫶🏼\n\n🪻plot 🪻\n\nthis book follows our favourite girly, paedyn, who is an ordinary. she is, as the title says, powerless. in this world, there are elites, who possess all kinds of abilities. and ordinaries, well, they’re left to die. the elites compete in these yearly competitions called “the trials.” where they take part in different challenges, battling eachother, until one winner remains. but when paedyn, an ordinary, saves the prince’s life, she is selected to go on the trials and must pretend to be a psychic (as her power) to not be killed.\n\n💐 my thoughts 💐\n\n🎙️rant: at firstI didn’t wanna read this was bc i expected it to be like fourth wing. thankfully, it was not. think tbh the reason i loved this so so much is the nice balance between fantasy and romance. I don’t read much fantasy because im a romance girly but this satisfied me so much. not to mention i was helplessly in love with kai the whole entire time, so that introduced a little bias heheh.\n\n🌏 the world building: it wasn’t confusing at all, for once I actually understood what was going on instead of them having the most twisted storyline with the craziest names that you can’t even pronounce. I definitely think this is a good book to get into fantasy, and if you actually wanna see romance and not just crumbs\n\n🫂 romanceeee 🫂\n\nyall I guarantee you this will be the best banter you ever, ever read. it’s too good. they bounce off eachother so well, they flirt SHAMELESSLY and we love to see it hehe.\n\n“Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?” I laugh loudly. “That’s been my goal all along, prince.”\n\nlets ignore the fact that she does stab him in the back.. and think about how cute these two are 🤭🤭 seriously one of my new fav couples, the most chemistry ive seen in agess. if this book wasn’t so damn stressful, I’d reread this book until I have it memorised, but I think I’ll just go back and read my fav scenes.\n\n🩶 kai azer 🩶\n\ni think i read like 10 chapters, and then immediately ran to put him in my book husbands shelf. I was that confident he was gonna eat, and tbh, without him this is just a mediocre book.\n\n“Mark my words, prince, I will be your undoing.” I lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as murmur, “Oh, darling, I look forward to it.”\n\nlike come on, how do you not fall in love right after that? if it were me, i’d fold the minute he called me darling. but hey, pae is strong, and we love that. she literally beat all the elites without any powers? that’s just embarrassing for them. i would crumble after task 1. not even after, like five minutes in.\n\n🗡️ paedyn gray 🗡️\n\nshe’s my fav kind of fmc. so strong, but also super funny? and has a backbone which we love.\n\nonly thing I didn’t love is how badly she treated kitt. believe it or not, I actually liked him. he was kind, he was sweet, he just wanted his father to love him which like who doesn’t you can’t blame him for that. I hope he gets a good ending, maybe not with pae BECAUSE KAIPAE FORVER!! but like in general I don’t want him to die or anything. I get that she didn’t like that he looked too much like the king or whatever but they’re literally so different I think she should’ve given him a little more credit <3\n\n🧸 adena 🧸\n\nmy precious girl. I love her so much. she was so kind and sweet, so caring for paedyn, and the way pae actually forgot about her kinda broke my heart. I don’t think I’ll have it in me to read her novella tbh it’ll hurt too much. but I adore her, and I wish I had a friend as compassionate and amazing as her 😭🫶🏼\n\n💌 quotes 💌\n\n°˖➴ “You don’t really want to do this and neither do I. Especially because I wouldn’t want to mess up that pretty face of yours, darling.” She all but rolls her eyes at me. “That’s funny because I won’t hesitate to mess up your pretty face.” I smirk. “I knew you thought I was pretty.”\n\n°˖➴ She is the embodiment of a bad decision. The twin of danger and desire. The fine line between deadly and divine.\n\n°˖➴ I’d never thought about what my favorite color was before. It never seemed important.\n\nNot until I looked into a pair of ocean blue eyes and realized that perhaps drowning was a beautiful thing.\n\n°˖➴ She’s a flame, and I’m going to get burned. An ocean and I’m going to drown.\n\n°˖➴ Why did I ever think I could have her, ever think she would have me? Because beasts don’t get the beauty.\n\n🪷 bottom line 🪷\n\nyou must go read this!! if this review didn’t convince you, idk what will. i’ve seen loads of people say this is just a copy paste of red queen and hunger games, but unfortunately i haven’t read them to confirm. but maybe if you like those you’ll enjoy this too? or hate it bc it’s basically the same thing LMAOO\n\nI love kai and paedyn, and although july is so far away, it’s also very close! so it’s nice knowing I have something to look forward to when I finish hiatus <3\n\nhappy reading pookies 😽🫶🏼\n\nMWAH ILY\n\n….\n\ni feel like crying. and screaming in frustration. bc that ending hurt and suddenly july feels way too far. im going to need the most cutesy, happy, feel-good romcom to help me heal from the insane amount of anxiety i had reading this ❤️‍🩹 5 stars. rtc <3\n\nRead\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\nDNF @ 51%\n\nif this boy says “vicious little thing” one more time, i shall meet my end. i can’t do it anymore😭\n\nAugust 24, 2024\n\n“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.”\n\nInfinity x Infinity 🌟’s\n\n⚔My Thoughts⚔\n\nUsually I am not into reading slow burn romance books. Like if they have a friends to lovers trope I’m not really interested in it bc its so slow at least in my opinion. Sometimes it can be at the very end of the book where the two characters kiss and it's just hard to wait that long i’m kind of impatient when it comes to romance 🙉 BUT…. this book kind of changed my perspective a little bit. To say I really liked this is an understatement. It’s such a beautiful, playful and humorous book. The plot the characters especially the characters specifically the female character, PAE!!! She is such a inspiration to all people especially girls!! I just love the way she carried herself and just went through the competition with such grace, passion, and determination. This book also reminded me a lot of my favorite dark romance series Blood and Ash series. The threats of how stabbing turns people on is just giving Casteel from blood and ash and it was like living deja vu all over again. But yeah this book had a little something of everything and I loved it sm!! I will say as someone who isn't really a slowburn fan I’m thinking about reconsidering after reading this. 💗 Infinity x Infinity stars all around!!!\n\n⚔Main Characters⚔\n\n☘Pae☘\n\nThis girl is my heart and soul!! I love her sm!! She is such a powerful female character. I love how she doesn’t try to just fit in with the other girls. Every chance she got she spoke up and expressed her feelings. And even when she wasn’t trying to she was so funny. Her relationship with Kai is just so cute and so romantic. Ik they didn’t really get a good kiss but Ik they’re is definitely something special for them in the cards. I really hope that she is still able to continue to being herself no matter what even after what happened. Usually its rare to get this much female agency throughout a whole book let alone a series so I’m hoping that she is able to just be true to herself and keep fighting for her relationship with Kai no matter what. Also can we just talk about the dresses she wore with the high slit and the dagger on her thigh and didn't even bat an eye at the traditional dresses that everyone had to wear that was all the same color. I’m talking badass girl right there!! 🎀💘💖\n\n☘Kai☘\n\nKai is literally the book guy everyone wants. 😍He is so funny and smart. He cares sm eventho he doesn’t seem like he does at first. He literally spared people when he was supposed to kill them And ofc he is absolutely so handsome. Like I was giggling and kicking my feet he was just so cute and so entertaining to read about. And the way he always put caring for Pae over his other duties was just so thoughtful and he is literally on of the best mmc in like book history. And I loved when he was so attentive to Pae and always found some way to crack a joke while flirting was just so swoonworthy. 😋 Like idk how I’m going to survive while Reckless isn’t here yet. And there was one scene I loved sm when they were talking about feelings and she was trying to put her walls up and he like next time don’t tap your left foot and lie to me. Like somehow he just knew.\n\n⚔Side Characters⚔\n\nThe were all pretty decent the best friend was my favorite. She was so sweet and I wish things could have been better (if you know you know) I’m not even going to talk about the father I didn’t like him at all. But the brother ofc I ended up liking him too especially when he was flirting with Pae 🙈 but midway I kinda just stopped idk why I just think he wasn’t that interesting like I thought.\n\n⚔Best Couple Moments⚔\n\n🌸Their 1st meet up\n\n🌱Gifted her a knife\n\n🌸Kai putting food on Pae’s plate for her bc she was refusing to eat and she seemed shy\n\n🌱Their little fights\n\n🌸Their dance lessons\n\n🌱Everytime he called her darling\n\n🌸Her favorite color is blue bc she loves his eye color\n\n🌱He helped her through her panic attack\n\n🌸He wrote on his arm ‘she said I could touch her when I’m sober’\n\n🌱Pae comforting Kai during his nightmare\n\n🌸Their picnic in the garden\n\n⚔Favorite Scenes⚔\n\n▪︎“Do you always fall into the arms of handsome strangers, or is it a new thing for you?” (Kai)\n\n“No, only the cocky ones.” (Pae)\n\n“Well looks like I’ve made quite the first impression then. Your clumsiness found me, so I hardly call it a curse.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”Kai, I’m not leaving.” (Pae)\n\n“Then don’t think I won’t throw you over my damn shoulder and carry you out of here myself. Is that what you want?” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”Maybe because you have to be a gentleman to be gentlemanly.” (Pae)\n\n“And who says I’m not?” (Kai)\n\n“I’d like to find someone who says you are.” (Pae)\n\n▪︎”Well maybe if you’d kept your eyes on the dance floor and your nose out of your glass, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” (Pae)\n\n“Oh, darling, my eyes were on the dance floor. They were on you dancing with my brother. Why do you think I’ve been drinking?” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”Do share her with the other gentlemen, wont you?” (Kai’s mom)\n\n“She’s mine for the night, Mother.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”I could get used to you being a gentleman, Azer.” (Pae)\n\n“And I could get used to being one for you, Gray.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”I’m a fool.” (Kai)\n\n“Only when you're around me?” (Pae)\n\n“Only for you.” (Kai)\n\n⚔Favorite Quotes⚔\n\n▪︎”Oh, don’t worry, Father, I won’t make the mistake of showing up to the throne room without a shirt. Again.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”Every girl deserves something equally as pretty and deadly as they are.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”I make it my business to know all the pretty girls who save my little brother.” (Kitt)\n\n▪︎”If it weren’t for my current situation, this could be a lot more fun.” (girl was sitting on his ribs covered in blood) (Kai)\n\n▪︎”For starters, I don’t appreciate my opponents going easy on me.” (Pae)\n\n▪︎”Oh, darling, as long as you still think I’m pretty, I don’t give a damn what I look like.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”I don’t want your mercy. Next time we fight, impress me.” (Pae)\n\n▪︎”By all means, carry on. I’ll never deny myself the chance of watching you watch me.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”Remind me to make you smile like that again, when you aren’t dying, and I have all the time in the world to memorize it.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”I’m going to ask again. Who did this to you?” (Kai)\n\n▪︎“Oh, I’m not making you do anything, darling. You can leave me to bleed out if you must. Because I only want your hands all over me if you want them to be.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”You know. I’m beginning to think that you enjoy getting hurt, if only so you can have my hands all over you.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”Who needs a pillow when I have you?” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”You know you didn’t have to spill my drink all over me to get me alone.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎”It’s not the winning that I find fun. It’s you, darling.” (Kai)\n\n▪︎“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.” (Kai)\n\n⚔The Ending⚔\n\nThe ending was so messy and heartbreaking and I was crying sm!! 😭 Like idk what to even say. I think it was kinda something we all knew partly bc of events that led up to it. However what happened with Kai was shocking bc usually stuff like that has gone differently but ih this was a new twist to the book which was so heartbreaking. And like the history with their fathers was crazy. I wish I could say more but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it.\n\n⚔Hopes for Reckless⚔\n\n🌱More Kai and Pae romance\n\n🌸The ending resolved\n\n🌱More humor\n\n⚔Last Thoughts⚔\n\nI really liked this book a lot and I'm hoping the next one delivers and it doesn't end up like the way Ruthless Vows was. Crossing my fingers for the next one only a couple months left!! 🤞💝\n\n\"I dont give a damn if you forget who I am in title, so long as you remember who I am to you.”\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\nDisappointing. More than disappointing. The hype for this book infuriates me because if this is the standard, the standard is in hell. It was basically just an amalgamation of popular tropes, and the main character was a carbon copy of every other generic YA lead to exist, lacking any flaws whatsoever. Where’s the originality? The world building? The character development? A good romance requires more than a few tropes and loads of cringey banter. Further, the writing was ridiculously poor and underedited.\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\nThis was not good. As a trending booktok book, I didn’t really know what I was getting into because those are always a bit of a toss up, but it was still one of my most anticipated releases.\n\nThe main issue with Powerless is that it was written FOR social media. It was written around popular tropes even if putting in those tropes was completely out of place and forced. Now listen, I’m not against using popular tropes or anything, but they’re only effective if they come naturally and actually have a reason to be there. It felt completely unoriginal because I had read it all before.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the tropes that made this book so unoriginal. I swear that this was just a carbon copy of The Hunger Games x Red Queen. The characters were all 2D versions of characters from the Hunger Game, the world building was literally the exact same as in Red Queen except if the Red Queen Universe hosted an annual Hunger Games, and the plot was just a bunch of copy and pasted moments from both. I understand that with fantasy books you’re always going to see some parallels between books, but this was insane. It was so so bad. Every page was deja vu and not in a good way. As someone who loved the Hunger Games (not Red Queen as much but I can respect it), some of this honestly felt a little disrespectful because it was so similar yet there was no meaningfulness or relevance to everything. THG is a commentary on our modern-day capitalist society and so many of the scenes and premises that were blatantly copied in this book actually held incredible importance in THG but were just thrown in with no meaning or thought whatsoever here.\n\nThen there was the romance, the reason we’re all here. I feel kind of 50/50 on this because Kai and Paedyn did have some “chef’s kiss” moments, but the tension was so overdone. When you put in so much sexual tension, there comes a point where it’s no longer tense. I also hated how Kai was always calling Pae “darling,” not because I hate that name or anything, but because it was used all the time and felt really forced. I also don’t understand all the nose flicking. Why was Kai always flicking Paedyn’s nose for no apparent reason. That will never not be weird. Nonetheless, it was one of the book’s better aspects which is great because it is, in fact, romantasy.\n\nThe writing also wasn’t too bad, especially considering that this is a debut novel. However, the use of the term “ocean eyes” was literally criminal and I don’t think I’ll be able to listen to that song again (iykyk). Oh, and “cocky bastard” too. We can do better than that.\n\nThe world building, like I said before, was completely unoriginal, but it also made about 0 sense. I mean, the whole idea behind the Purging Trials is so that the kingdom can showcase the power of the elites, but the whole thing was so flimsy. Like, you’re going to have a bunch of people with powers go fight each other (and kill each other, although it was never explained if that was the actual goal or what) and film them for… entertainment purposes? Don’t even get me started on the whole history with the Elites and Ordinaries with the Plague and everything. So many plot holes in this regard.\n\nI will say that this book was very entertaining and bingeable. Despite the fact that I kind of hated it, it still would be one of my go-to’s for a reading marathon or a long trip or something like that.\n\nIn the end, this was a huge letdown for me. It really is an interesting example of how social media is effecting the book industry and, while I think there are some good things that come out of this, I really have a lot of issues with it. Honestly, Powerless was so formulaic that it almost felt like it was generated by AI (I know it wasn’t- I’ve been following Lauren Roberts on social media for a while and I’ve seen what she’s put into this book). I know the that a lot of people love this book but it wasn’t for me. 2 stars.\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\nwhat fourth wing should’ve been\n\n29/12/23 a hit tweet! i’ve certainly sparked some discussions with this one 😀\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\ndnf 30%\n\nI’m literally Powerless, because I don't have enough strength and power to finish this book. I'm sorry to the people who enjoyed it, but I can't keep doing this to myself despite trying to somehow like it.\n\nIt felt like the author tried very hard to make this book appeal to Booktok, because the amount of stuff copied from various popular books here was crazy. At this point, let AI write books, because currently new releases lack the depth and that something that could be found in books before or when Booktok wasn’t that popular yet. Instead of being original, authors focus on putting as many popular tropes as possible because they know people will eat it up anyway. Unfortunately here, the 'eating up' part didn’t work out for me.\n\n————\n\nlet's see if it's worth the hype\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nજ⁀➴ 5 stars 🏹🤍\n\n➳ “Mark my words, Prince.
