        "text": "File this one under strange but true!\n\nWhen actress Julia Roberts was born on 28 October 1967, her parents, Walter and Betty Lou Roberts, couldn't afford to pay their hospital bill, but luckily friends came to their aid.\n\nThe parents of the Pretty Woman star's friends were none other than celebrated civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr and his wife, Coretta Scott King.\n\nThe Roberts and King families got to know each other when King's children attended the acting school run by Julia's parents, the Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nAt the time, most white-run institutions in America's south were segregated, and black children weren't allowed to attend.\n\n\"One day, Coretta Scott King called my mother and asked if her kids could be part of the school, cause they were having a hard time finding a place that would accept her kids, and my mom was like 'sure, come on over,'' Julia said.\n\nAfter their children joined the school, the families became friends, said Julia in an interview with Gayle King for the History Channel’s HistoryTalks show.\n\nA clip from the interview, which first aired in September, went viral after it was tweeted by Zara Rahim, a former adviser to ex-US president Barack Obama.\n\nIn the clip Gayle asks Julia who paid the hospital bill when she was born.\n\nInitially looking slightly uncomfortable, Julia says to the audience, “Her research is very good,\" before telling the story of her parents' friendship with the Kings.\n\n\"They helped us out of a jam.\"\n\nREAD MORE| Why Julia Roberts and George Clooney have one of Hollywood's most successful relationships\n\nJulia became friends with Yolanda King, the eldest of the King children, who died in 2007 from complications related to a chronic heart condition.\n\nIn 1970, when Yolanda was 15, she starred in a play, The Owl and The Pussycat, produced by Julia's parents, in which she kissed a white actor, prompting a member of the Ku Klux Klan to blow up a car outside the theatre.\n\n\"In the '60s, you didn't have little black children interacting with little white kids in acting school,\" said Gayle in the interview with Julia.\n\n\"Julia's parents were welcoming, and I think that's extraordinary, and it lays the groundwork for who Julia is.\"\n\nREAD MORE| Rom-com queen Julia Roberts reveals the reason for her four-year absence from our screens\n\nJulia famously faced criticism from a South Carolina town she described as \"horribly racist\" and \"a living hell\" after a black friend of hers was refused service at a restaurant there in 1990.\n\n\"I can see her doing that,\" Yolanda said of Julia in a CNN interview.\n\n\"I can see it pouring forth from her, and rightfully so.\""
