        "text": "In one of the more surprising stories of the weekend, Julia Roberts is considering bringing her acting career to a dramatic close, in favor of a quiet life away from the spotlight.\n\nHaving been one of the most recognizable women for much of the 2000s, Roberts is known to prefer spending time away from the silver screen with her family, and she is now looking to do that full-time.\n\nShe has earned a lot of money over the course of her career, and lives with her husband in an 8.3-million-dollar townhouse.\n\nIn a report published by Radar Online, Roberts has been pushing her husband to move to the townhouse on a full-time basis and retire from the limelight.\n\nRoberts wants to leave Hollywood behind\n\nHaving been one of Hollywood's biggest ever stars, Roberts has grown tired of the spotlight and pressures that come with acting.\n\nShe wants to leave Hollywood behind and focus on another part of her life, spending time with family and travelling to Manchester United matches.\n\n\"She loves San Fran and never seems to want to leave,\" one source told Radar Online.\n\n\"Julia gets way more pleasure and stimulation when she's at the ranch or pottering around San Francisco, which is still the number one place she'd like to live if Danny ever agrees.\n\n\"It's far more cultured and endearing to her than hanging around her Malibu estate.\"\n\nRoberts currently has three children with her husband after the pair got married in July 2002, 18-year-old twins Hazel and Phinnaeus, and 16-year-old Henry."
