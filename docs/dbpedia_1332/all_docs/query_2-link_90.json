        "text": "This chapter introduces some of the female playwrights of the early twentieth century and examines some of the social conditions under which they worked. It argues that many of them represented a major cultural change for women of the period who were leaving the Victorian era behind and forging new paths in the young century. But the press frequently undermined their efforts by presenting them as wives instead of individuals, scrutinizing their physical attractiveness, and implying that playwriting was a hobby on the same level as gardening or homemaking. The chapter then shifts to the challenges of writing for the musical theater and collaborating with other writers. It concludes with examples of Youngâ€™s correspondence with the Shuberts and demonstrates her ability to navigate the business side of the theater.\n\nThis is the Foreword from my recent edition of Margaret Bonds's previously unpublished, and utterly brilliant, setting of the iconic freedom song \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,\" for soprano solo with SATB chorus a cappella. The edition is available as a choral octavo score here: https://www.hildegard.com/product/i-wish-i-knew-how-it-would-feel-to-be-free-margaret-bonds/"
