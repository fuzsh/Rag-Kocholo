        "text": "Soon to be a feature length documentary\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is not a film screening.\n\nWestern Jewish pioneers are a largely forgotten chapter in U.S. history. And yet, they played a definitive and often colorful role shaping the expansion of the United States. There were nationally known names such as Levi Strauss, Samsonite founder Jesse Shwayder and the Guggenheim family, who built their great fortunes through grit and determination in California and Colorado. And there were also lesser-known characters such as Solomon Carvalho, a Sephardic painter and photographer who spent the mid-1800s documenting the territories of Kansas, Colorado and Utah. Wyatt Earp’s wife, Josephine Marcus Earp, was a Jewish dancer whose beauty is rumored to have triggered the fight at the OK Corral. And by the end of the 19th century nearly every notorious Wild West town, including Deadwood and Tombstone, had a Jewish mayor.\n\nThe wagon trains that moved westward with Jewish families traveled for the same reason as many settlers: opportunity. By 1912, it is estimated over 100,000 Jews had migrated to the Wild West. They put down roots and, today, many of their descendants are entrepreneurial and philanthropic leaders in the West. They epitomize the important legacy of immigration in America.\n\nSoon to be a feature length documentary, Jews of the Wild West was partially researched in the archives of the American Jewish Historical Society. In a conversation moderated by Rabbi Joseph Black of Temple Emanuel in Denver, Amanda Kinsey speaks with Annie Polland, Executive Director of the American Jewish Historical Society and Ann Kirschner, author of Lady at the O.K. Corral: The True Story of Josephine Marcus Earp.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nAnn Kirschner is a distinguished writer, educator, entrepreneur, and strategic advisor.\n\nHer writings include the award-winning book Sala’s Gift, the story of her mother’s wartime rescue of letters from Nazi labor camps. Sala’s Gift has been published in German, Polish, Italian, French, Czech, and Chinese, and is the subject of an international traveling exhibit, a theatrical play that has been performed at over 113 schools and theatres, and a forthcoming documentary film.\n\nHer most recent book is Lady at the OK Corral: the True Story of Josephine Marcus Earp, the definitive biography of Josephine Marcus Earp, a Jewish woman from New York who became the common-law wife of famed lawman and gambler Wyatt Earp. Hailed as “scrumptious” by USA Today, and “splendid” by the Wall Street Journal, Lady at the OK Corral is a spirited and colorful tale of ambition, adventure, self-invention, and romance reflective of America itself, from the post-Civil War years to World War II.\n\nAnn Kirschner herself covers a lot of territory, from the classroom to the boardroom. She is Dean Emerita of Macaulay Honors College, a remarkable success story in public higher education, and University Professor at the City University of New York. A former senior executive of five start-ups including nfl.com, she serves on the board of directors of several companies and nonprofit organizations, including Princeton University, the Movado Group, Strategic Cyber Ventures, Footsteps, and the Paul and Daisy Soros Foundation.\n\nShe is a graduate of Princeton University, where she earned a PhD. She received a BA from University of Buffalo and an MA from University of Virginia.\n\nAnn Kirschner lives in New York with her husband, Dr. Harold Weinberg, and is the mother of three grown children – and a grandmother of two.\n\n\"Jews of the Wild West\" is a feature length documentary currently in production. The independent film is produced by Electric Yolk Media and directed by award-winning filmmaker Amanda Kinsey. Through on-camera interviews, archival footage and images, the film will preserve this dynamic chapter of Jewish history and the role it played in shaping the United States. The hope is to also shed a positive light on the importance of immigrants in forming America as we know it. The film is expected to be completed in 2020.\n\nAmanda is an independent filmmaker, five-time Emmy Award winning producer and fourth-generation photojournalist. Prior to founding her own production company Electric Yolk Media in 2013, she spent over a decade writing and producing for NBC News. During that time, she was also awarded with several Edward R. Murrow Awards, National Headliner Awards and a Gracie Allen Award.\n\nIn 2010, Amanda won an Emmy for her Today Show story “The Fighting Grossmans” about a Jewish American family with eight soldier sons in WWII. Her most recent productions are an hour long documentary for PBS’s “Treasures of New York” and a docuseries for VICE Sports. She is a graduate of both Barnard College and Columbia Business School.\n\nAmanda recently relocated from Brooklyn to Denver with her family. Her passion for the Wild West is personal. Amanda's grandmother was born in Denver and once jumped out of an airplane for $100, her great-grandparents ran a photography studio in Butte, Montana at the turn of the 19th Century and her great-great-grandfather owned a San Francisco saloon during the California Gold Rush.\n\nA nationally recognized musician, writer, and poet, Joseph Black (moderator) has served as Senior Rabbi of Temple Emanuel in Denver, CO since July 2010. Before moving to Denver, he served in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Minneapolis, Minnesota. He received his Rabbinic Ordination from Cincinati’s Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR) in 1987 and in 2012 he received an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from HUC-JIR. Rabbi Black serves as a Chaplain in the Colorado House of Representatives and is Past President of the Rocky Mountain Rabbinical Council. A frequent contributor to anthologies and collections of Jewish writing, Rabbi Black has also recorded five critically-acclaimed albums of Jewish music, a songbook, and two videos.

They were a baseball team.” The experience shaped a credo the renowned reporter and best-selling novelist lives and writes by. “New York City,” Hamill says, “is the capital of people who are not like you. Absorb as much as you can.”\n\nIn a career spanning six decades, Pete Hamill has absorbed his city, written its stories, and imagined still more in his eleven novels. On September 8th at 3 pm at the Center for Jewish History, the celebrated storyteller sits down with another notable New Yorker and his former New York Post colleague: Bronx native and acclaimed New York Times reporter Clyde Haberman. Both sons of immigrants, Hamill and Haberman will talk about the Irish and Jewish neighborhoods they came from, the immigrant experience then and now, the tabloid that launched their careers, and the ever-changing city that continues to inspire.\n\nProgram will be followed by a reception.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nA journalist, novelist, essayist, editor and educator, as well as a cartoonist and artist, Pete Hamill was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1935.

These extraordinary documents – more than 600 of them were submitted – are unique testimony to the hopes and dreams, as well as to the reality of those who were growing up in Poland at the time. Mayer Kirshenblatt, who was born in Opatów (Yiddish: Apt) in 1916, could well have been one of those autobiographers. Although he did not enter the competition, he did recall his youth much later during interviews recorded by his daughter during the last forty years of his life.\n\nThis illustrated lecture will relate the youth autobiographies written in real time, by youth who had no idea of what the future would hold, with Mayer’s recollections in words and paintings many years later. The talk will include a short film about Mayer’s return to his hometown and how he was received by those living there today. Finally, the talk will consider the role of the youth autobiographies and Mayer’s childhood memories in POLIN Museum’s Core Exhibition.\n\nDelivered in English.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nBarbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett is Chief Curator of the Core Exhibition at POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews and University Professor Emerita and Professor Emerita of Performance Studies at New York University.

He didn’t envision himself giving interviews on national news programs or announcing legislation on Capitol Hill. “I was not a politically involved person before February 14th,” Fred said. But that day in 2018, his 14-year-old daughter Jaime was one of 17 people killed by a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Fred is now devoting his life to urgently advocating for stricter gun control and public safety laws. A native of Long Island, Fred says his Jewish upbringing instilled in him a commitment to family, service, and standing up for others. Matt Gutman, an ABC News Chief National Correspondent joins Fred for a conversation about speaking out, fighting back, and challenging elected officials to do more.\n\nASL interpretation will be provided at this event.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nFred Guttenberg moved to Florida from Long Island in 1989 shortly after graduating from Skidmore College in New York in 1988.

In 2016, while reporting on the upheaval in Venezuela, he was detained for five days by the country’s secret police for “the crime” of reporting on the fatal shortages of medicine and food in the country’s hospitals. Experiencing the inside of one of Venezuela’s dreaded intelligence agency’s prisons further opened his eyes to the corrosive power of repressive governments. Before joining ABC News in 2008, Matt was a Jerusalem-based reporter for seven years, covering every major conflict in the Middle East, from the Palestinian uprising to the invasion of Iraq. He lives in California with his wife and two children.\n\nView Video\n\nPresented by:\n\nAward winning actors Ed Asner and Tovah Feldshuh star in a concert reading of The Soap Myth, a powerful play about survival, memory, and truth. Set more than fifty years after WWII, a young Jewish reporter grapples with different versions of the same story - did the Nazis make soap from the corpses of murdered Jews? Ed Asner portrays Milton Saltzman, a Holocaust survivor committed to proving that this atrocity happened while Tovah Feldshuh plays dual roles of a Holocaust scholar and a Holocaust denier - both of whom reject Saltzman’s memory. Performed in tribute to Yom HaShoah, The Soap Myth dramatizes the painful confrontation between survivors, scholars, and Holocaust deniers, and questions who has the right to write history. Written by Jeff Cohen and directed by Pam Berlin, the production features Ned Eisenberg in multiple roles including Holocaust scholar Daniel Silver and Liba Vaynberg as journalist Annie Blumberg. The concert reading at the Center for Jewish History is part of the production’s National Tour.\n\nThis performance will be filmed by ALL ARTS, a new broadcast channel and streaming platform produced and distributed by WLIW, a member of the WNET family of public media organizations.

Based on the book by Gabrielle Simon Edgcomb, the film tells the little-known story of two very different cultures, sharing a common burden of oppression. In the 1930s, German universities were some of the first targets of Nazi activity. Jewish professors and intellectuals who were able to immigrate to the United States faced an uncertain future. Confronted with antisemitism at American universities and a public distrust of foreigners, a surprising number sought refuge in a most unlikely place – the traditionally black colleges in the then- segregated South. Securing teaching positions, these scholars came to form lasting relationships with their students, and went on to significantly impact the communities in which they lived and worked.\n\nNineteen years after the film was originally released, the filmmakers, Steven Fischler and Joel Sucher, feel its message –that more binds us together than separates us - must be heard. They passionately believe that as long as racism and inequality exist in our society, there will be a compelling need to bring From Swastika to Jim Crow to a wider audience. One-hour screening followed by a panel discussion with the filmmakers, historian Charles L.

Recruited by a rag-tag outfit called the Arab Section before the 1948 War of Independence, they assumed Arab identities to gather intelligence and carry out sabotage and assassinations. At the height of the war the spies posed as refugees fleeing the fighting, reached Beirut, and set up what became Israel’s first foreign intelligence station. Spies not only tells a breathtaking and true espionage story, it also explores a different story about how the state was founded and raises many questions that are relevant today.\n\nIn a wide-ranging First Person conversation, Matti Friedman speaks with author Lucette Lagnado (The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit) about his journalism career, researching and writing his new book, and what Spies of No Country reveals about Israel in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nA reception, book sale and signing follow the program.\n\nThis program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nCredit: Mary AndersonMatti Friedman has reported from Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, Moscow, the Caucasus, and Washington, DC.

The first part of the program will focus on understanding how immigration and assimilation, as well as religious customs and practices of our Jewish ancestors, help us learn more about the personalities and the stories hidden within our family photos. In the second portion of the program, Sherlock will use case studies, including one from Yeshiva University Museum’s current exhibition, Lost and Found – A Family Photo Album, to illustrate how photo dating, photo identification, knowledge of fashion and artifact history, and matching vital records can illuminate our relatives’ lives and help us solve some of our vexing genealogy mysteries. At the conclusion, she will help workshop attendees begin the process of analyzing their own family photos.\n\nIf you plan to attend this workshop and have a family photo you would like Sherlock Cohn to analyze, please read the photo submission guidelines here.\n\nThis program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nAva (Sherlock) Cohn is an internationally-recognized professional genealogist who specializes in the dating and interpretation of Jewish family photographs.
