        "text": "Blood vessels are comprised of cells called endothelial cells. The total surface area covered by these cells in an adult is 1000 m2 — roughly the size of a tennis court.\n\nIf all the blood vessels in the body were lined up end-to-end, they would form a line that could circle the earth twice.\n\nBlood vessel cells do not normally grow in the healthy adult; they are normally inactive, or quiescent.\n\nThere are at least 20 different known angiogenic growth factors.\n\nFive angiogenic growth factors are being tested in humans for growing new blood vessels to heal wounds and restore blood flow to the heart, limbs, and brain.\n\nAngiogenic gene therapy is also being developed as a method to deliver angiogenic growth factors to the heart, limbs, and wounds.\n\nThere are at least 30 known natural angiogenesis inhibitors found in the body.\n\nThe first angiogenesis inhibitor molecule was discovered in 1975 by Dr. Judah Folkman and Dr. Henry Brem in a study of cartilage.\n\nAngiogenesis inhibitors have been discovered from natural sources, including tree bark, fungi, shark muscle and cartilage, sea coral, green tea, and herbs (licorice, ginseng, cumin, garlic).\n\nIn total, more than 300 angiogenesis inhibitors have been discovered to date.\n\nAt least 184 million patients in Western nations could benefit from some form of antiangiogenic therapy.\n\nAt least 314 million patients in Western nations would benefit from some form of angiogenesis-stimulating (pro-angiogenic) therapy.\n\nThe first successful treatment of an angiogenesis-dependent disease occurred in 1989, when the drug interferon alfa2a, an angiogenesis inhibitor, was used to regress the abnormal blood vessels growing in the lungs of a boy with a benign disease called pulmonary hemangiomatosis.\n\nSome cancer patients have experienced dramatic regression of their tumors from antiangiogenic therapy; others have experienced stabilization of their disease.\n\nMore than 2,000 patients with heart disease have received some form of experimental angiogenic therapy.\n\nThe first FDA-approved device to stimulate new blood vessels to grow in diseased hearts is a laser used in a technique called Direct Myocardial Revascularization, or DMR (sometimes called transmyocardial revascularization, TMR).\n\nThe first FDA-approved blood vessel therapy for eye disease is a type of photodynamic therapy called Visudyne (QLT Therapeutics/CibaVision), which has shown effectiveness for treating macular degeneration.\n\nThe first angiogenesis-stimulating medicine is a prescription gel called Regranex (recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals) that became FDA-approved to heal diabetic foot ulcers in December 1997.\n\nMore than $4 billion has been invested in the research and development angiogenesis-based medicines, making this one of the most heavily funded areas of medical research in human history.\n\nReferences:\n\nFolkman J.

He will forever hold an enduring place in the history of cinema, through his portrayal of James Bond from 1973-1985, the longest serving actor in the role of Special Agent 007. Sir Roger made his Bond debut in 1973 in Live and Let Die and continued for a total of seven productions. Trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and Cambridge Arts Theatre, he began his acting career on stage in London’s West End and then on Broadway. He subsequently headed to Hollywood where he worked at MGM and Warner Bros. Studio. Notable roles include his work in the television series Ivanhoe, The Alaskans, and Maverick. His breakout role was as Simon Templar in the most successful television series of its time, The Saint. Then followed his widely popular portrayal of Lord Brett Sinclair in The Persuaders, with Tony Curtis as his co-star. Sir Roger also wrote a handful of books, among them My Word is My Bond: A Memoir, Bond on Bond and Last Man Standing.\n\nSir Roger was an internationally celebrated humanitarian. For over 25 years, he worked with UNICEF, appointed as Special Ambassador in 1991 and as Goodwill Ambassador in 1999, to advocate for the rights of children. Queen Elizabeth II recognized Sir Roger’s charitable contributions in 1999 by appointing him a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and, again in 2003, when she made him a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). Sir Roger was dedicated to using his influence to spur positive change in the world and was also an ardent activist for cancer research and animal rights.\n\nGeorge W. Thorn was an electric figure in medicine. At the age of 36 he burst on the scene at Harvard Medical School in 1942 as the ninth Hersey Professor of the Theory and Practice of Physic and the third Physician in Chief of the Department of Medicine at the then Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Frequently mistaken for a medical student or resident, he remained youthful in outlook and appearance until his 90s. He died on 26 June 2004 at the age of 98.\n\nGeorge made vital contributions to the clinical use of adrenal steroids. He began his career in endocrinology as a medical student at the University of Buffalo, went on to Ohio State and then joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins where Harvard found him.\n\nThe Brigham, as it was called, was then a Dickensian institution as were all of the Harvard hospitals of the mid 20th century. Built in 1914, its design was inspired by a fear of hospital borne infection. The four 30 bed male and female surgical and medical services were wide open, poorly ventilated and over-heated pavilions separated from each other by a long corridor that was still partially open to the elements well into the 1950s. Flimsy curtains separated the ancient beds. Privacy was non-existent. So called semi private beds were on a floor above.\n\nThey were located on open wards as well, but those patients were the private patients of staff members, while the large first-floor pavilions were the provinces of the house staff. A three floor private service was housed near the pillared entrance of the hospital. It was scarcely lucullan in its appointments, but there the tired interns could make a decent breakfast for themselves on Sunday mornings.\n\nLaboratories at the old Brigham were primitive by any standards. One small old building housed the hematology, chemistry and pathology labs as well as George’s endocrinology lab and a few beds where patients with endocrine disorders could collect urine and undergo various hormone tests. It was an early form of the later General Clinical Research Centers based on the Rockefeller University Hospital model. A horribly ventilated and totally inadequate animal facility was in the basement.\n\nDespite lack of space and money, George conjured up a full time staff of investigators. His own program in endocrinology produced George Cahill and Albert Renold among many others. His many contributions to the endocrinology literature included over 400 papers.\n\nTo expand the academic department of medicine he focused first on cardiology. He was wise enough to build on the clinical greatness of Samuel A. Levine and added the cardiac catheterization skills of Lewis Dexter and, later, Dick Gorlin. Frank Gardner came from the Thorndike laboratory at the Boston City Hospital to run hematology. He attracted house staff of the quality of Don Thomas and Clem Finch and scores of others who became leaders of academic medicine. George’s greatest gift was free floating imagination. His discussions of patients on rounds were always brilliant if occasionally somewhat off base. A favorite resident told me “You listen—I will not. Then when he is gone—we’ll do it my way.”\n\nArmed with that creative style, Thorn dissuaded John Merrill from a career in cardiology to lead an effort in renal dialysis and transplant. The renal transplant program at the Brigham became world-renowned. He was instrumental in the formation of the Harvard-MIT program in Health Science and Technology, and he was the first scientific leader of the Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute. But his free flowing thought processes and his youthful, friendly personality were sometimes confusing. One inadequate resident once boasted that George had appointed him to the Chief Residency when actually George had fired him!\n\nIn his later years as the Chief of Medicine, George began to worry about how to elevate the role of basic science in a department of medicine and how to prevent specialists from forgetting general medicine. He wrote two very important articles on those subjects in the New England Journal of Medicine. Whether one agrees with them or not, they are well worth reading today.\n\nGeorge’s last appointment was: Physician in Chief, Emeritus, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Hersey Professor of the Theory and Practice of Physic, Emeritus & Samuel A. Levine Professor of Medicine, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School.\n\nDr. Thomas E. Serena M.D. FACS FACHM FAPWCA, Founder and Medical Director of The Serena Group™, a family of wound, hyperbaric and research companies, is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of The College of William and Mary and Penn State Medical School.\n\nHe completed his residency in Surgery at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center with fellowship training in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Southern Illinois University.\n\nTo date he has opened and operates wound care centers from New York City to Tulsa Oklahoma. Dr. Serena has been the lead or Principal investigator in over 55 clinical trials, including testing blood platelets, gene therapy for critical limb ischemia, antimicrobial dressings, growth factors, topical and parenteral antibiotics and bi-layered cell therapy. As a result of the overwhelming demand for his services as a researcher, he founded the NewBridge Medical Research Corporation, a non-profit corporation (501(c)3) dedicated to advancing the science of wound healing. On four occasions NewBridge has received funded from the National Institutes of Health. He currently consults for the government of Rwanda on AIDS prevention research.\n\nHe is recognized internationally as an expert in the field of wound healing: He has 100 published papers and has given more than 200 invited lectures throughout the world. He consults for numerous wound care industrial partners in the development of new products for the wound care space. He has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Wound Healing Society and recently was an author on four of the national guidelines for the treatment of chronic wounds.\n\nIn 2009 he was elected Vice-President of the American College of Hyperbaric Medicine. He also currently serves on the board for the Association for the Advancement of Wound Care. Recently, Dr. Serena returned from Haiti where he was the wound care team leader for the University of Miami’s Medishare Hospital. He has done extensive medical relief work with Health Volunteers Overseas and serves as chairman of the\n\nAAWC Global Volunteers/HVO Steering Committee. He also a member of the World Health Organization’s wound care outreach program (WAWLC).\n\nJeffrey F. Rayport is a consultant, author, and founder and chairman of Marketspace LLC, a strategic advisory practice that works with leading companies to reinvent how they interact with and relate to customers. Marketspace was formerly a unit Monitor Deloitte, a global strategy services and merchant banking firm.\n\nRayport is an authority on information-intensive industries such as media and entertainment, retail, and financial services. He has published a series of MBA-level textbooks on e-Commerce and a bestselling business book on integrating multi-channel customer experiences.[1] In 1996, his Fast Company article “The Virus of Marketing” introduced the concept of, and coined the term “viral marketing.”\n\nHe is on the faculty of the Harvard Business School in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit. He has been voted outstanding professor multiple years. At HBS, Rayport developed and taught the first graduate-level e-commerce course in the United States, “Managing Marketspace Businesses” in 1995. Business plans produced by Rayport’s students resulted in various high-tech start-ups, including Yahoo!\n\nRayport earned an A.B. from Harvard College, an M.Phil. in International Relations at the University of Cambridge (U.K.), and an A.M. and Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization at Harvard University.\n\nHe has served as a director of several public and private corporations; current directorships include Andrews McMeel Universal, GSI Commerce (NASDAQ:GSIC), International Data Group, Valueclick (NASDAQ:VCLK) and Monster Worldwide. He also serves on the advisory boards of advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky and public relations firm Brodeur (a unit of Omnicom Group; NYSE: OMC). In addition, he is a trustee of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA; a director of the Nantucket Preservation Trust inNantucket, MA; and a director of From the Top (a classical music program distributed in the United States by National Public Radio) in Boston, MA.\n\nDr. Michael McNamara leads a unique specialty of preventive health practice using the most sophisticated modalities of diagnostic imaging and blood analysis. A pioneer in the specialty of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), he founded the first hospital-based MRI department in Europe in 1986 at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco. He has led groundbreaking work in diagnostic MRI and CT imaging for cardiac disease and cancer, for pharmaceutical development and clinical testing, for sports related injuries, as well as in IT solutions for mining raw medical data for improvement of healthcare management.\n\nDr. McNamara received his M.D. at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and trained in Medicine and General Surgery at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in San Diego, California, followed by specialty residency training in diagnostic radiology at University of California San Francisco (UCSF). He also completed fellowships in cardiovascular disease imaging and pharmaceutical MRI development, and in the development of pharmaceutical MRI contrast media for early cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn 1986, Dr. McNamara was recruited to be MRI department chairman at the Princess Grace Hospital, McNamara developed the world’s first preventive Total Body Scanning program, for the early detection of cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, cancer, and degenerative abnormalities, as well as implementation of regenerative medical treatment programs. Prince Rainier III bestowed Monaco citizenship to Dr. McNamara in 2001, in recognition of his significant achievements and contributions to the Principality of Monaco.\n\nThe US Olympic Committee appointed Dr. McNamara as consultant physician for the United States Men’s Basketball “Dream Team” for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. Dr. McNamara has lectured throughout the world and has published over 45 scientific papers and books. Dr. McNamara is currently the medical director of BIOPTRON A.G. and Zepter International, overseeing research and development for the clinical use of medical light therapy. He has also served on the Medical Advisory Boards of General Electric Medical Systems, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Nycomed Laboratories, and Bracco Diagnostics, and sits on the Board of Directors of Akloma Biosciences in Stockholm, Sweden. Dr. McNamara also co-founded MDdatacor, an innovative health care information technology company.\n\nDr. Kamen received his M.D. and Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, and served his residency and fellowship in pediatrics and pediatric hematology/oncology and pharmacology at Yale University, New Haven, CT. His academic career consists of three years in Wisconsin, 16 years at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center as a Professor of Pediatrics and Pharmacology as the Carl B and Florence E. King Distinguished Professor Pediatrics and then 8 years as Director of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Associate Director of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ. He then served as the Chief Medical Officer of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society from 2007-2009.\n\nDuring his career, Dr. Kamen has been a recipient of a Scholar Award from The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, a Damon Runyon Walter Winchell Fellowship, Burroughs Wellcome Clinical Pharmacology Award and is one of only a few American Cancer Society Clinical Research Professors. He was also elected into the American Society of Clinical Investigation (Young Turk). He has authored approximately 300 manuscripts (papers and chapters) and is the current Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Pediatric Hematology Oncology as well as serving on a number of editorial boards and advisory boards of other cancer journals. He serves on the Research and Medical Affairs Committee of the American Cancer Society and is on the board and the treasurer of the National Coalition for Cancer Research (NCCR).\n\nDr. Kamen’s clinical and research interests are driven by the over arching goal of doing “translational research,’ that is taking the best science to the bedside. Currently he is developing treatment to prevent both resistance and toxicity, especially neurotoxicity from therapy. He has been on the forefront of developing metronomic therapy for cancer.\n\nNobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 1963\n\nNobel Prize Winner in Medicine. A physiologist, he was honoured in 1963 for elucidating the chemical and mathematical processes involved in nerve impulse conduction. Born to a family distinguished in both the literary and scientific worlds (his older half brothers included biologist Sir Julian Huxley and “Brave New World” author Aldous Huxley), he was exposed to advanced learning from early childhood and was educated at the University College School and at Westminster before earning a scholarship to Trinity College Cambridge where he studied biology, physics, and physiology.\n\nUpon graduation he partnered with Sir Alan Hodgkin in a series of experiments which involved passing a wire down the long axis of a large neuron taken from a giant Atlantic squid and measuring electrical voltages along the nerve membrane. The two men published their observations in a small article in the journal “Nature” but soon found their work interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. During the conflict Sir Andrew performed anti-aircraft and naval gunnery research then in 1946 resumed his neurophysiology studies. Though it was long known that potassium ions (K+) could pass thru a neural membrane it was felt that sodium ions (Na+) could not; Sir Alan and Sir Andrew were able to demonstrate that during the excitation or rising phase of a nerve impulse Na+ ions diffuse into a cell while in the falling phase K+ ions pass out and were to propose the Hodgkin-Huxley Model, a series of differential equations that explain and quantify how the action potentials of neurons are initiated and propagated.\n\nFinishing the work that was to lead to the Nobel Prize around 1952 Sir Andrew maintained his professorship at Cambridge, turned to the subject of muscle contraction physiology, and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955. From 1960 thru 1969 he held a faculty position at University College London and in 1963 received the Nobel Prize along with Sir Alan and Sir John Eccles, an Australian who had independently studied similar subject matter. He was to lecture at major institutions on both sides of The Pond, occasionally drawing fire for publicly conceding that Darwin’s Theory does indeed have holes and that some things such as consciousness cannot be explained by evolution.\n\nKnighted in 1974, he received the rarely bestowed Order of Merit (OM) in 1983 and from 1980 thru 1985 was President of the Royal Society, in 1983 upholding, in the face of numerous letters of protest, the group’s election of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In 1984 he was to succeed Sir Alan as Master of Trinity College Cambridge, a position he held until his 1990 age mandated retirement. Sir Andrew lived out his days in Cambridgeshire and continued teaching at Trinity College until his death.\n\nChief Medical Informatics Officer, Quality and Safety, Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nDirector, Laboratory of Computer Science, Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nAssistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School Dr. Henry Chueh is one of the nation’s leading experts on medical informatics and a pioneer in the use of computers and Web-based applications to improve clinical research and patient care. He is the Director of Computer Science at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Chief Medical Informatics Officer, Center for Quality and Safety and Chief, Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine at MGH, and an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nDr. Chueh is the principal investigator on high profile medical informatics projects funded by research grants from the National Institutes of Health/National Library of Medicine (NLM), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).
