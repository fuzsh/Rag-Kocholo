He lived in Orangeville, MI for about 8 months before passing and was previously a resident from both Grant, MI and Pinconning, MI areas. He was a new recent owner/operator of ENS Construction (Everyone Needs Something), had an extensive sales background and was a jack of all trades. Steven loved fishing, playing cards, going to the casino, doing odd projects, family time and cooking. He always had a smile on his face, always tried to see the best in people and was a warm-hearted person with love for everyone.\n\nSurvivors include his children, Devin Myers, Alayna Schumann, Aiddan Schumann, Eathan Schumann, and mother, Theresa Koski. He is also survived by his Grandma Ella Schumann, brothers, Ronald (Mary) Russell, Adam Schumann, Aaron (Amber) Schumann, Evan (Emily) Schumann, and sisters Christine (Duke) Poole, Autumn Schumann, as well many aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins. Steven was preceded in death by his father, David Schumann, and his birth mother Dinah Russell.\n\nCremation has taken place and there will be a private memorial service for Stevenâ€™s children, family and closest friends scheduled for a later date."
