Barter to Committee on Plaza Tower and Pools; SUBJECT: Suggested Removal of Plaza Tower & Pools.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAt your request I am giving you herewith a report on the suggested removal of the Plaza Tower and Pools.\n\nThe Plaza Tower and Pools accomplish three things which I have listed below, but not necessarily in the order of their importance:\n\n(1) Fills in with pleasing reflecting surfaces the center of the Plaza which would be impossible\n\nto light adequately with any method without producing glare from the light sources.\n\nProvides an adequate central location for the public address system loud speakers.\n\nProvides the most, and possibly the only, practical way of lighting the buildings and a 30 or 40 foot strip around the perimeter of the Plaza.\n\nIn planning lighting of the Plaza as it was one year ago, the experience of 1915 was borne in mind.\n\nAt the last Exposition this Plaza was lighted with 500 Watt standards around the curb line of the Plaza, and was inadequate even for general illumination except close to the curb and for a very limited height on the buildings. The center of the Plaza was poorly illuminated, cold, and foreboding. This was because the intensity of the beam of light on the ground becomes smaller. Increasing the intensity of this unit merely emphasizes the contrast between the unit and the intensity at the center of the Plaza. Floodlighting would provide more intensity in the center of the Plaza but would require extremely high structures to keep them out of the eyes of the observer.\n\nThe Langevin Company, who installed the public address system on the Grounds, refused to accept, as inadequate, any other location than a point about 30 feet above the ground at the center of the Plaza for the distribution of sound east and west and north and south from that point. At one time locations in towers on the House of Hospitality and on the Café of the World were offered them, which they refused.\n\nA tower in the center of the Plaza then provides a location for the loudspeakers and also provides a location for lights to light the fronts of the buildings facing the Plaza and Pools, provides a means of reflecting the spill light from the buildings, reflect the lighted front of the buildings in its surface, and occupy space in the Plaza which is impossible to light adequately except by towers or poles higher than the Plaza Tower itself.\n\nIn a measure the Tower and Pools are an expedient and their cost was relatively small. More elaborate structures would undoubtedly have been more impressive and pleasing but funds were not available.\n\nPRESENT EXPOSITION\n\nThe cost of moving the Plaza Tower and Pools is not in itself an expensive job, allowing salvage for the lumber either by contract with the wrecker or crediting ourselves with the lumber, it would run anywhere from a credit of $250.00 to a cost of $500.00. The removal of the concrete and hauling it away might run $500.00. The re-paving is not a serious job.\n\nHowever the delay caused by time of demolition of the tower and pools; the devising of a complete new illumination scheme involving changes in the manufacture of dimmer equipment now or order and being built in the east; the installation of a new system; would make a complete picture by February 12thout of the question.\n\nIf a new illumination scheme were devised it might mean cancellation of the use of equipment and dimmers provided under the Olesen contract, and which has already been procured or manufactured. It would also mean the abandonment of certain work which we have already done in the way of running circuits. Certainly new structures of some type would have to be provided in some location to accomplish the same general purpose. The structures as they exist at present was the cheapest combination and probably cost, ready for service, $12,000.00. It is reasonable to assume that with the changes involved in the contract, the demolition of the Tower, the installation of a new system with the attendant structures might cost anywhere from $15,000.00 to $25,000.00 and it would be very highly improbable that the world could be completed by the opening February 12th.\n\n(Transcription from letter in Box Files of California-Pacific International Exposition kept by San Diego Public Library.)\n\nSan Diego Herald, January 9, 1936, 1:1-3.

Sandusky, Department of Exhibits, California-Pacific International Exposition, San Diego, Calif.\n\nDear Mr. Sandusky:\n\nMr. Whitson and I have just returned to Los Angeles, where we find your letter and enclosures waiting reply.\n\nWe certainly appreciate your sending us the letter of inquiry, and hope we shall secure some business thru it. Many thanks.\n\nRegarding the application blanks: We had considered the Better Housing Building for our booth, having been told that there would be no available space in theSpanish Village, where we had our most important booth last year, because we understood that a Cuban Village was to occupy all the space in the Village, and a gate charge would be asked. Recently we had space in the Village offered to us again, and learned that the idea of a gate charge had been abandoned. We understand that many changes are being made there, and feel that it is advisable for use to return to the Spanish Village, rather than return to the Better Housing.\n\nWe thank you very much for your many kindnesses, and would have cooperated with you better if we had been able to get some definite information regarding the Village at an earlier date. We are now returning your blanks, and within the next few days will be in San Diego to attend to removing our property from the booth now in the Better Housing Building.\n\nThanking you for your interest in our behalf, and with best regards, we are\n\nSincerely\n\nGefrog Studio\n\n(Sgd.)

Replica of railroad being built for transportation exhibit.\n\nLetter, January 19, 1936, Victor M. Clark to Frank Belcher; cc to Larrinaga, Settlemier; SUBJECT: Proposed scheme of treatment “March of Transportation”\n\nFor the next few days at least we will go on the assumption that Davidson will be successful in obtaining the first locomotive to run into Washington (built 1832), the Atlantic. This is a wonderful and picturesque thing and has attached a most colorful Inlay Coach attached [sic]. This is now in the Smithsonian Institute but is to be released in the next few days. If we get this it would be an ideal thing for a most striking centerpiece for the Rotunda.\n\nI am enclosing herewith prints of photos Mr. Black had made for me the other day in Dearborn. Also, I enclose a floor plan of the suggested layout.\n\nI recommend that Paul Whiting be immediately called in to work with Larrinaga and give him the benefit of the research work he has done particularly in regard to the 12 or 15 highlite stages we will want to depict. These will be fitted in more or less with the material we have available. Start the history with TUT’s Chariot and work around to the most modern and even ultra-modern modes of transportation of the future. Juan is the baby who can imagine more fantastic vehicles than we will have wall space for. Give Drugan his rockets by all means.\n\nDon’t attempt to sketch any general “all over” view till I get there but Juan can get started on rough idea sketches for the wall murals. Bear in mind we can have the two murals ford [sic] has which were on the two, shall I say pilasters, which flank the entrance to the patio. Personally, I think we need this space to complete our historical picture in murals. This is the thing Whiting should work with Juan.\n\nOh, Baby, if we get, and I am sure we will, the B & O engine and Inlay coach referred to above, it will make a most spectacular centerpiece . . . I’m all steamed on this thing and believe me I am getting back ASAP.\n\nI hope I have made this clear unuf [sic] for Juan. At any rate I will be in Chicago Tuesday; Wednesday go to Omaha (Union Pacific). Leave Thursday for SD . . . (Chicago is for Airline exhibit.)\n\nFeeling fine even with 12 inches of snow here today. My only worry is will these damn airlines ever get in the air again. Had to come to NY by rail.\n\nTomorrow, Monday, I have Pan-American and Pratt-Whitney and then I’m on my way . . . to Chicago.\n\nPersonal regards . . .\n\n(Transcription made from letter in Box Files of California-Pacific International Exposition kept by San Diego Public Library.)\n\nSan Diego Union, January 19, 1936, 1:3, 2:2. Tickets to Exposition ready tomorrow; grounds will be closed to public; children to be admitted for nickel Saturday; books over 40 percent savings; Zoo to remain open; final 23 days of preparation; Zoo and Palace of Natural History remain open to public; Harry P.

Exposition leaders promise Fair surpassing 1935.\n\nLetter, January 20, 1936, Weston Settlemier to Belcher, Gildred, Dailard, Executive Committee.\n\nAfter checking with all salesman, the exhibit situation is:\n\nBy February 12, which you set for opening, the Foods Palace and the Housing Palace will be ready if attached recommendations are followed.\n\nBy March 12 the Medical Building, General Exhibits Building, Charm Building, and an Electrical Building can be ready if attached recommendations are followed.\n\nBy April 12 the Transportation Building should be in good shape.\n\nI see no way in which more speed can be made.\n\nWe have mustered all the buying pressure in the Businessmen’s Committee we organized.\n\nYou gave us 10 salesman and 3 months as against last year’s Fair, with 30 salesmen and 9 months. You asked the same space price for the second Fair although Chicago gave away space the second year to hold outstanding exhibits. Five major exhibits, including Ford, Libby, Kraft, Standard Brands, and Coca Cola, committed themselves to Dallas before you decided to reopen.\n\nA good Fair can be delivered to us on above schedule if attached recommendations are followed, but no sooner.\n\nWESTON SETTLEMIER\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nFill the near wing of the Foods Building by:\n\nOffering space free to M.O.D. as a Farmers Cooperative, as we did for the California Walnut Growers Association branding machine – if they decide against us – to fill the old Libby space with a fine exhibit.\n\nPut Dailard’s indoor ice cream rink in the old Kraft space, or a Hage exhibit, if possible.\n\nPut a concessionaire back Hormel exhibit in the old Standard Brands space.\n\nPut a concessionaire back floor exhibit, using the old Fisher scone baker to fill the side wall.\n\nPut the so-called Seagram Tavern in another side wall space, using the old Transamerica\n\nTheater (purchasable for $250) for part of the Tavern construction, if needed.\n\nBalance or 3/4th of the building is in good shape under contract with only one important reservation still stalling and that is Coca Cola, which will come in thru the local bottler when the cash lay down is right.\n\nPut potted palms in the few remaining vacant space.\n\nConsider closing the far end of the Foods Building, i.e., spaces 4-A, 5-A, 6-A, 7-A, 7-B, 20-A, moving the Spreckels exhibit in 7-B to the old Kraft space, putting Seagram’s Tavern in the closed end. This will still leave a large wall-filled building.\n\nFill the unsold wing of Housing Building at low or little floor rental for taking this over as a separate palace, such as the Water Palace is, by a deal with Portland Cement Association or Redwood Association, who can’t pay much but can fill it with legitimate and interesting building exhibits that the U.S. Government insisted be in this building this year as a condition of their investing $25,000 in the new Talking Towers. Four-fifths of the main building is sold to legitimate exhibitors with the gas industry, including utilities and appliances, paying us $7,000 for an exhibit that is 4 times the size of last year’s exhibit. The whole building includes this year no fake merchandising or gyp religious booths.\n\nHelp San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company to swing the Electrical Building by itself, if necessary. $15,000 was the minimum estimate needed to the free floor space you gave. S.D. Consolidated Gas and Electric agreed to spend $6,000 themselves in last Thursday’s meeting in Los Angeles. Clark Chamberlain, Secretary of S.D. Electrical Appliances Association, might find some money from his budget. Kelvinator – R.C.A. – Norge – Horn – Westinghouse, and others — have guaranteed to move in on the space and, man if the above sponsorship cost is arranged. Their joint investment would total\n\n$75,000. Southern California Edison declined to come in. We have Mr. Pontius, President of Pacific Electric, as a large customer; still trying to convince Bauer, their President. He has already phoned Frost and Lewis, their two Vice Presidents. Bureau of Power & Light considered paying 2/3rdby itself, but on a basis unacceptable to S.D. Consolidated Gas & Electric, as municipal ownership would have overshadowed San Diego’s share and would have ruined the usefulness of the original plan, which was to feature appliances whose sales help the sale of power. I need help from Mr. Belcher to convince Messrs. Raber and Holloway, who are most cooperative, that if the L.A. Power Company does not come in, they can still have a building that will do a good job that is sponsored by themselves alone and sponsored with the Exposition’s entire cooperation. Bureau of Power & Light and Southern California Edison officials pointed out they were promised last year an Electrical Building equal to Chicago if they would spend $45,000 to finance the G.E. House of Magic. They spent the money but the Fair sold only two electrical exhibits and the rest were jewelry and novelties, potato peelers and oil companies. Some way to restore their confidence in our pledges and program must be found.\n\nCharm Building negotiations have lagged as exhibitors received circular offers in early November for $1.50 per sq. ft. and were later asked $16,000 to $25,000 for a 6,000 net sq. ft. building. The building is in the main a concession, and if rental is set right it should be ready no later than March 12.\n\nMedical Building is devoted to ethical medicine. Except for G.E. X-Ray, commercial exhibitors have so far not given Bryant in New York, who is concentrating on this building, much encouragement. It contains outstanding institutional exhibits and should be ready by March 12, but no sooner.\n\nVaried Industries last year had little salable space. It had 3 big things which took most of the space — the Post Office – the House of Magic – the Television Show. If these are used for similar purposes this year, and I understand this is Dailard’s plan, there is little need to worry over this building. It should be a catch-all and called General Exhibits, or used for transient shows, like dog shows, flower shows, style shows, home craft shows, etc. It should be ready by March 12.\n\nHollywood Hall of Fame could be used by the name bands of the Music Corp. of America, which could put in famous bands that are in supply for any reasonable deal for the summer months to draw the younger set of Southern California, on free space with a percent of their gate to the Fair; or it could be an indoor auditorium in case any mid-winter special events are rained out. An indoor auditorium with chairs for the visiting organizations is badly needed. The head of one organization asked to arrange for a special event in March told me he declined because he was not satisfied with the outdoor facilities if it should rain while his visitors were holding their outdoor speaking contest. In understand the Special Events Dept. has not yet been provided with an indoor auditorium with seats and this building might work for this purpose. If other arrangements are made for an indoor auditorium, there is a long-shot possibility that we might investigate. The L.A. Assembly Plant Manager and the local dealers might take over this small building if the deal on space is nominal to exhibit their new models and possibly a steel model of their new assembly plant and call this a General Motors Salon, which arrangement would give the Fair the prestige of a small General Motors exhibit and in no way interfere with the dance band planned for this building in case that can be arranged.\n\nI recommend that you immediately publicize the February 12th opening as a “MIDWINTER PREVUE” of 1936 Exposition – ‘OR INFORMAL OPENING”\n\nIf you open with exhibit buildings not ready as they obviously cannot be by February 12th, public reaction will be so bad that the attendance will be ruined – especially if you make it an official opening, as the public expect everything in readiness at official openings.\n\nBy publicizing the above title, you will, in fairness, reconcile the public by expecting most from the grounds and concessions and prepare them for facing things in an unfinished state (except for Foods and Housing Buildings.) Publicizing the above title will also reconcile somewhat concessionaires discouraged by necessarily slow business in midwinter to the fact that the opening is early and the best is yet to come — in the summer months. It will frankly admit facts we all have to face and take the curse off the rush and unfinished condition an arbitrary opening date creates. By April 12thwe should be able to drop the “PREVUE” publicity and bill a full steam ahead 1936 Exposition or “FORMAL OPENING”.

Doors are to be of glass and the same type as used on the other opening.\n\nAlso, it will be necessary to carry the Drug Store walls up to the roof line so as to shut out all cooking odors.\n\nThe floor should be sanded and given a coat of oil.

We are confident that this year’s show will be much finer and more successful than the last which closed November 11th.\n\nAll indications point to more travel and a greater attendance this year over last. This is substantiated by the All Year Club releases, railroad and steamship companies’ announcements of advanced bookings and the high percentage of increases in hotel reservations throughout California.\n\nWe would not care to consider a percentage deal. However, we will lease you space at $2.00 per sq. ft. and make an additional charge of $50.00 for a sales privilege. This is for the life of the Exposition, 211 days.\n\nA visit to San Diego will justify your confidence in our forthcoming show as a means of providing an outlet for your product.\n\nThe enclosed floor plan will assist you in the selection of space. Time is short and space is limited, so get in touch with us at your earliest convenience.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. Lohman\n\nAsst. Director of Exhibits\n\n(Copy of letter taken from Box 9 Folder 28, California-Pacific International Exposition, kept by San Diego Public Library.)\n\nSan Diego Sun, February 4, 1936, 1:5, 2:3.

Opening of the Modernization Magic Exhibit in Modeltown at the Exposition is scheduled for this week, according to Stuart A. Ripley, manger of the Federal Housing Exhibit.\n\nModernization Magic shows the transformation that can be effected under the FHA insured mortgage plan. The exhibit is mounted on a base, three feet from the ground, and upon a reversible surface. One side shows a group of typical, run down buildings similar to those found in any community. At intervals, by a mechanical device, the panel turns over and shows, upon the other side, the effect a modernization program has upon the structures. The cost of each improvement and the terms upon which the money may be obtained, is contained in a panel opposite the structure. Modernization Magic again will be in charge of Edwin M. Rahm, mechanical engineer of Los Angeles, who supervised it last year.\n\nMODELTOWN UNVEILED. The Federal Housing Administration exhibit of “Modeltown,” completed repainted and renovated, was recently unveiled for the 1936 season. The miniature houses on miniature landscaped lots, occupy a three and one-half acre area, which last year drew 1,481,424 visitors. Modeltown is part of the government’s $150,000 display, the remainder of which is in the Federal Housing Building, and which includes the 12 famous “singing towers.”\n\nGENERAL EXHIBITS BUILDING. Among the many interesting exhibits in this building are included the following:\n\nThe Gem Stone Chapel, whose displays contain every gem, mineral and stone mentioned in the Bible. These gems and stones were gathered from 22 nations and 21 states of the Union.\n\nThe Last Supper of Christ, depicted in life-size wax figures.\n\nThe American Legion display, showing guns, grenades and other articles of modern warfare, side by side with Civil War relics for comparison.\n\nThe sword which General Grant wore through the Civil War.\n\nA model of the historic Milan Cathedral, composed of more than 100,000 tiny pieces.\n\n“Gadget Town,” appealing to the housewife who demands convenience in her kitchen.\n\nHandcraft and character-building exhibits by Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and Campfire Girls.\n\nW.C.T.U. exhibit on the evils of drink\n\nAlaska exhibit, featuring furs and clothing and historic northern relics.\n\nA revolving hobby display.

This display is centered around a 26-unit exhibit of the American Medical Association, covering 1500 sq. ft. of floor space and embracing treatment of sickness and injury from the broadest scientific viewpoints. A 16-unit exhibit of the California Medical Association, of equal importance but of entirely different character, visualizes specific lessons and facts which have been learned in years of medical study, experiment and practice. The smallest and largest X-Ray tubes in the world for practical use are exhibited by the General Electric X-Ray Corporation.\n\nPALACE OF TRANSPORTATION. One of the outstanding features of this truly marvelous exhibit is the world’s largest transportation mural. Occupying 20,000 sq. ft. of wall space, this mural marks the successful culmination of the most ambitious mural painting undertaking in history. Executed by Juan B. Larrinaga, noted artist, and a corps of assistants, the murals depict in a steady march of events the history of man’s conquest of distance, from the time of primitive men down to the present. A bold glimpse into the future forms the final panel of the great mural, with rocket planes, automobiles of the future, and ultra-streamlined trains depicted as they speed across tomorrow’s travel scene.\n\nUNION PACIFIC EXHIBIT IN “MARCH OF TRANSPORTATION.” The Union Pacific Railroad exhibit features two trains in miniature, one a conventional model, and the other a streamlined model. The streamlined model represents the “City of Los Angeles,” an 11-car train operating on regular rail schedules in the exhibit. In addition to the miniature trains, the Union Pacific will have six dioramas in its 100-ft. section. These dioramas will show the northern rim of the Grand Canyon, Boulder Dam, Zion Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and other scenic spots, covering an area of 2,000 sq. ft.\n\nFORD RELICS FEATURE OF MARCH OF TRANSPORTATION. A feature of this great building is the collection of relics from the Ford Museum at Dearborn. They include five “horse-drawn” vehicles and seven automobiles, exhibited in the rotunda of the building. The “horse-drawn” vehicles include a buckboard, 2-wheel chaise, phaeton, landau and brougham. The automobiles begin with a Locomobile of 1899, a Stoddard-Dayton of 1911, a Stanley Steamer of 1923, Ford models A and T, a Ford V-8 and a Lincoln Zephyr, the last two being 1936 models.\n\nLINDBERGH GLIDER. In the rotunda of the March of Transportation building is the battered old glider used by Charles and Ann Lindbergh in their soaring flights over San Diego in 1931. Lindbergh flew the glider an hour and a half over Point Loma, while Anne Lindbergh had it aloft for nearly an hour over Mount Soledad.\n\nREDWOOD EMPIRE EXHIBIT IN CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING. One of the most interesting displays in this building is the Redwood Empire, embracing the eight counties comprising this empire: San Francisco, Marin, Mendocino, Humboldt, Sonoma, Napa, Lake and Del Norte. In this area, 97 percent of all redwood growing in the world is to be found. Dioramas depicting the wine industry, general farming, and outdoor sports, as well as a model of one of the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge, are included in this exhibit.\n\nMODEL OF PALOMAR TELESCOPE. A model of the world’s largest telescope, panned for 6,150 ft. Palomar mountain in San Diego County, is on display at the Palace of Education. Correct in every detail, the model of the Palomar\n\ntelescope is being exhibited by the California Institute of Technology, to whom the Rockefeller Foundation assigned the responsibility of selecting a telescope site.\n\nSAFETY EXHIBIT IN STATE BUILDING. A comprehensive exhibit in the California State Building, designed by the Industrial Accident Commission of the state of California to show the main causes of accidents and the measures taken to prevent them, is proving to be one of the most interesting and educational displays at the Exposition. It comprises one of the largest collections of modern safety appliances ever assembled in the West. It includes the very latest equipment in eye protection, respiratory appliances, safety clothing and first-aid kits.\n\nWATER PALACE ATTRACTS CROWDS. Southern California’s never-ceasing conquest of water, as shown in the world’s largest talking diorama, is attracting thousands of visitors every day. The facade of the Water Palace is one of the most striking on the grounds and gives the prospective visitor an inkling of what is to be found inside. Water, cascading over the basins in a shimmering flood and, at night, forming beautifully colored lighting effects for the entrance and forecourt, is indicative of the amazing story of water development in Southern California, as told by the exhibits on the inside. Once inside, the principal feature of this exhibit is a gigantic diorama or relief map. By means of an electrically illuminated lecture, this great map graphically shows three of the world’s greatest water supply systems, all serving a group of 13 cities in the Los Angeles area. The three systems are the Mono basin, the Metropolitan Water District Aqueduct, the world’s greatest construction job, now in progress; and the All-American Canal, now being constructed by the Federal government to serve Imperial and Coachella valleys with irrigation water.\n\nPALACE OF INTERNATIONAL ART. This exhibit building, located on the Plaza del Pacifico, and which was known as the House of Charm during the 1935 Exposition, contains many unusual and diversified displays. Among them are a Chinese pagoda, an Irish linen shop, a replica of the Taj Mahal, housing a famous collection of gems, and an exhibit of Oriental rugs, including the famous “Wishing Rug.” Other features include a Mexican patio, an Indian pueblo, and a Turkish coffee lounge.\n\nGARNER CURRAN. Garner Curran, world traveler and renowned lecturer on Oriental and American subjects, is receiving numerous letters and cards of praise for his very interesting illustrated travelogs and lectures at the House of Hospitality. In fact, one admirer recently sent him a verse of appreciation, containing the following lines:\n\n“Now one can travel to a tropic land\n\nAnd at the same time hold an easy chair;\n\nWhat marvels reach one’s vision, close at hand,\n\nConveyed by cameras from most everywhere.”\n\nENTHUSIASTIC VISITORS. Judge Peter H. Schwaba of the Cook County Superior Court in Chicago was a recent Exposition visitor. Before leaving, he said: “The beauty of the Exposition is incomparable, and in that respect it far surpasses the Chicago Century of Progress.”\n\nAt the San Diego Breakfast Club, another visitor, Col. W. Langmuir Watt, C.M.G., chief of the X-Ray division of the famous Guy’s hospital of London, England, was lavish in his praises of the Exposition’s beauty, adding that “I believe that the view of Palm Canyon under the glow of the many colored lights is one of the most beautiful in the world.”\n\nPARKING FACILITIES AND SERVICE. Rapid parking service is assured for motorists visiting the Exposition. A large staff of uniformed attendants has been organized to handle the parking of automobiles with the great efficiency, courtesy and speed. Pickup service for automobiles is maintained at both the east and west entrances. Visitors may drive up to the gates, where an experiences licensed driver will take the automobile to the auto park. Upon leaving, the exposition visitor may phone for the car to be delivered at the desired exit gate.\n\nNATIONAL ROMANCE WEEK. National Romance Week has been proclaimed by the Federal government for the week from June 1 to June 7, and Dan Cupid has been signed up at the Exposition for that week. There will be a gala public wedding and many other appropriate events.\n\nCALIFORNIA HOTEL DAY. “California Hotel Day” will be celebrated at the Exposition on Sunday, April 26, and all hotel people in the state are urged to attend. Great interest is being shown by the Hotel Association and the Greeters, and this will unquestionably be a most enjoyable and memorable day for all visitors connected with the hotel business.\n\nA committee has been appointed from membership of the San Diego Hotel Association to arrange a program and act as host group to the out-of-town hotel men who will attend.\n\nSAN DIEGO HOTEL RATES LOWERED. With accommodations for about 100,000 guests per day, San Diego hotels have reversed the usual procedure and lowered their rates this year coincident with the opening of the 1936 Exposition. A general reduction of about 10 percent has been made in all hotels, according to Al Flowers, secretary of the San Diego Hotel Association.\n\nOLD GLOBE THEATER. The Globe Theater Players, presenting abridged versions of Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies, are again receiving popular acclaim for their outstanding performances. As a special treat, a full-length production of “Hamlet” was recently given in the evenings. Free English fold dancing precedes each performance on the Village Green. Adjoining the theater is the “Old Curiosity Shop”, immortalized by Charles Dickens, and the Falstaff Tavern specializing in the best English cookery.\n\nCONTESTS. Life at the Exposition is just one contest after another — all adding to the fun and entertainment of the visitor, whether young or old. Recent contests included a bathing beauty contest, an “Air Queen” contest, a spelling contest, a pistol marksmanship contest; baby contest; and, on Kids’ Days (Saturdays) a pie-eating contest, a peanut-rolling contest, a whittling contest, a doll contest, and a buried-treasure hunt.\n\nWHO WILL BE THE NEXT LUCKY WINNER? On Wednesday night, March 25, another Ford car will be given away to the holder of the lucky number at the drawing on the Midway Fun Zone Plaza. The first drawing was held on March 5, and the Ford was won by a sailor; on March 15 a school teacher was the lucky winner. Special tickets to participate in the drawing are being given to all visitors paying admission to the Exposition grounds.\n\nEVERY NIGHT A FEATURE NIGHT. Some special form of feature entertainment is provided at the Exposition from Tuesdays to Sundays.

Adding to the festive spirit of the Exposition, officers of the Chilean training ship “Maipo” were recently feted at the Cafe of the World by Frank Drugan, executive secretary of the Exposition, and Howard F. Worth, Chairman of the Army and Navy committee of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.\n\nALL STATES DAY. One of the most outstanding of the many Special Days that are being planned for the summer season is All States Day, set for August 1. This day will honor Mr. C. H. Parsons, President of the Federation of State Societies in Los Angeles. Mr. Parsons has the enviable record of having been Secretary of the Federation for 41 years. Governor Merriam has promised to attend if he can possibly do so.\n\nSPORT FISHING. Sport fishing is an additional attraction that draws thousands of visitors to San Diego, and, of course, to the Exposition. Last year more than 40,000 persons embarked from the foot of Broadway on sport fishing cruises, and it is estimated that about 30,000 were from outside the city. More than 100,000 yellowtail were caught off the San Diego coast last year, besides thousands of swordfish, tuna, barracuda and other game fish.\n\nFIRE LOOKOUT TOWER. A new fire lookout tower has been erected at Camp San Diego, the CCC Camp on the Exposition grounds. It is an exact duplicate of those in the national and state parks, being 12 feet square at the bottom and 18 feet tall. The tower houses all the equipment employed by park rangers for locating and detecting forest fires. A guide is on hand at the new tower to show visitors the intricate workings of fire survey and protection.\n\nDAILY WALK-TALK AT PALACE OF SCIENCE. The daily walk-talk that is given at the Palace of Science every day from 3 to 3:30 pm is proving very popular.\n\nDr. E. L. Hardy, director of the great collections of anthropology and archeology, sponsored by the San Diego Museum, and Dr. Malcolm Rogers, curator, have initiated this feature of the 1936 Exposition in response to the demand of thousands of visitors who wish to see the magnificent exhibits and be informed as to their significance by trained lecturers.\n\nEvery day, except Monday, the people interested in the walk-talks will meet at the main entrance of the California building, on the north side of the quadrangle, at 3 o’clock. After the half hour’s official tour of the main exhibit displays, the Exposition visitors interested in some special display will be permitted to return to study it in greater detail in company of a trained guide.\n\nBARNES CIRCUS TO BE HIGHLIGHT OF WEEK. The giant Al G. Barnes Circus, which will set up its huge tents and equipment on the lot east of the fun zone at the Exposition, is the highlight of the Exposition program this week.\n\nThe complete Barnes Circus has been signed for a gala three-day show, with hundreds of trained wild animals, more than 1,000 performers, including clowns, aerialists, magicians, and other acts, and every other attraction that goes to make a great circus greater, included on the program Friday, Saturday and Sunday, March 27, 28 and 29.\n\nPaid admission to the circus will entitle patrons to free admission to the Exposition grounds.\n\nFRONTIER DAYS AND INTERNATIONAL RODEO.

Owing to increased attendance at the Exposition over the weekends, all exhibit palaces will open an hour earlier and close an hour later, beginning on Friday and continuing through Sunday.\n\nInstead of opening at noon, the buildings will open at 11 am, and instead of closing at 8, they will close at 9 pm, for these three days of the week.\n\nThese hours will not affect the Amusement area and the cafes and restaurants, which will continue to be open until midnight on weekdays, except Saturday when they remain open two hours later. Gates will open at 10:30 am on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and at 10 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe entire Exposition will be closed on Mondays until the opening of the summer season.\n\nMIDWAY FUN ZONE. Activity and crowds on the beautiful new Fun Zone of the 1936 Exposition are increasing considerably as the balmy spring days lure visitors to the Exposition grounds.\n\nBEECH-NUT CIRCUS AMUSES CROWDS. The “Big Top: of the Beech-Nut exhibit in the Palace of Foods and Beverages is attracting thousands of visitors daily. The miniature circus is housed in a glass-enclosed display, 30 feet long by 10 feet wide, and the models of more than 300 animals and human figures form an endless mechanical parade as they put on their performances around the four rings of the show. Free samples of Beech-Nut products are distributed from the booth.\n\nA DAILY BEAUTY CONTEST. Where is the most beautiful spot on the grounds? Opinions vary, but there is one location that has definitely forged to the front, and, according to present indications, bids fare to wear the figurative crown of beauty leadership. It is Palm Canyon bridge by night. The beauty of the rainbow lighting effects on the palms and the tall eucalyptus trees, with the twinkly of the myriad of tiny lights in the “Vale of Fireflies,” presents such a picture of enchantment that it leaves the average visitor spellbound and speechless. “Words fail me,” is an exclamation often heard from persons standing on the bridge. “It’s so beautiful that it hurts,” is another expression that has been heard, and this remark will indicate how deeply the emotions of the beholder are stirred by this spectacle of sheer delight.\n\n(Box 31, California-Pacific International Exposition, San Diego Public Library.)\n\nMarch 15, 1936, Sunday.
