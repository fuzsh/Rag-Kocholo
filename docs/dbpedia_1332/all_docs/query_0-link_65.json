        "text": "Spotlight: Branford Marsalis\n\nBranford Marsalis hails from the musically rich and diverse city of New Orleans and was raised in a house of jazz royalty - his father, Ellis, was one of New Orleans' most esteemed pianists and music educators, and he's the oldest among jazz siblings Wynton, Delfeayo, and Jason Marsalis. The New York Times described the Marsalis family as \"jazz's most storied living dynasty.\"\n\nMarsalis has performed with countless jazz legends, formed his own quartet in 1986, and is the winner of three Grammy awards, but his musical interests are not confined to jazz, he is also an accomplished and dedicated performer of classical music and has made a name for himself as a soloist in the orchestral world.\n\nThough he bridges these two musical worlds, his approach is different when playing classical music, \"I have to be less loud,\" Marsalis said in a 2019 interview for artsfile. \"I need to have a mouthpiece that allows me to control the tone. Non-classical music never really gets to pianissimo. It never gets softer than super loud. To get that you have to practice in a different way. I played clarinet first. My clarinet teacher was always on me about my tone.\"\n\nWhen asked which genre was more difficult, Marsalis didn't hesitate, \"Classical is harder. Jazz is like a story that you personalize, but classical is a story where you can't use your own words. It's like reading Shakespeare or Chaucer. You have to develop the characters to make them believable, but the words aren't yours, and you're not going to change Shakespeare. You can't. In classical music, you don't play your own notes, you play theirs.\"\n\nBranford Marsalis performs the first movement of Ibert's Concertino da Camera.\n\nReflecting on the growth of his classical music career, Marsalis said \"Classical music in my 40s got me to a place where I was going to have to practice and become a better player. It made me a better musician.\" Branford Marsalis will join Christopher Warren-Green and your Charlotte Symphony at the Belk Theater on May 14 & 15 to perform Ibert's lyrical and soaring Concertino da camera and Schulhoff's jazz-inspired Hot Sonate. >> Get Tickets\n\nRead more Charlotte Symphony Charlotte Symphony\n\nA powerful message from Cherokee Nation youth: Si Otsedoha (We're Still Here)\n\nThe Cherokee Chamber Singers have a powerful message to share: Si Otsedoha (We're Still Here). Nestled in an all-American Classical Series concert on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, 2020, below is everything that you need to know about this powerful work and our collaboration.\n\nSi Otsedoha (We're Still Here) sprang from the minds and hearts of students of Cherokee Middle and High Schools under the guidance of the Cherokee Chamber Singers. Composed in 2018 by contemporary American composer (and NC native) William Brittelle, Si Otsedoha (We're Still Here) is sung in the Cherokee language and musically documents the past, present, and future of the Cherokee people who have lived in the mountains of Western North Carolina for several thousand years.\n\nThe Cherokee Chamber Singers vocal group was formed in 2016 as the advanced vocal group from the Performing Arts Department at Cherokee High School, the Native American high school in the Qualla Boundary in Cherokee, NC (also known as the Cherokee Indian Reservation). Under the direction of Michael Yannette, the singers' unique and varied repertoire offers audiences both traditional and modern Native American music, as well as choral, classical, musical theater, and pop/rock genres.\n\n\"I have been a teacher for 33 years and have never been part of something with the impact of this work,\" Yannette said. \"The audience reaction has been overwhelmingly positive; I thought people might be disturbed by it in Raleigh, but it had universal acceptance. They were open to what these kids had to say: 'We're still here, and we're always going to be.'\"\n\nThis concert serves as a continuation of the Symphony's commitment to use music to both explore issues of systematic injustice, and to look to a more equitable future for all people. Under the baton of Music Director Christopher Warren-Green, the orchestra will perform this powerful work that celebrates the creativity and cultural heritage of the original citizens of North Carolina, but also amplifies their voices.\n\n\"Si Otsedoha (We're Still Here) is not only an artistically excellent work that shines a light on North Carolina music and composers, but it also gives voice to a group of people in our home state who feel forgotten,\" Michelle Hamilton, Charlotte Symphony Interim President and CEO, said. \"The Charlotte Symphony is proud to share the stage with these young singers and provide a platform for their voices.\" Hear their message: Join us on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 at Belk Theater. Also on the program: Copland's Appalachian Spring and Barber's Adagio for Strings.\n\nRead more Charlotte Symphony Charlotte Symphony\n\nFather and daughter share the stage at Stars, Stripes and Sousa\n\nViolinist Jenny Topilow has a special connection to our upcoming Stars, Stripes and Sousa concert on Nov. 15 & 16: her father is the guest conductor! Find out in our interview below what it's like for Jenny to see her dad on the podium, and how Carl Topilow creates his patriotic clarinet for this concert.\n\nJenny, what's it like to have your father on the podium as your conductor? Have you worked together like this before?\n\nJT: My Dad was my primary conductor when I was 18-22 years old. During that time, I wouldn't say we \"worked\" together as much as I was a student learning from him as a teacher, which he's great at. He did give me a B in conducting class [at the Cleveland Institute of Music], though (he was probably being generous!).\n\nSince becoming a member of the Charlotte Symphony, I have worked with my Dad many times. Often it's just us playing duets (with him on the clarinet), but also in [an orchestral setting] a few times, too.\n\nI'm very proud of my dad and his amazing career, and it is special when he is on the podium, but he's very cognizant about not treating me any differently when we are in a professional setting. Maybe he'll point out that I'm his kid and he's excited to have me in the band, but then it's down to business. As he says \"I've worked with hundreds of violinists, and you're definitely one of them.\"\n\nCarl and Jenny, what inspired you to choose a career in music?\n\nCT: My love of music and my desire to pass this passion on to other people as teacher and performer was my inspiration to make this a full-time profession.\n\nJT: I started violin at age three after seeing Itzhak Perlman on Sesame Street (a surprisingly common story!). It's been simply amazing to share the stage with him recently.\n\nMy dad being a conductor and my mom being a ballet dancer, they basically had the 16th sized violin waiting for me in the closet. I was pretty talented and practiced pretty diligently, but as a professional musician and a teacher at a conservatory, my dad knows just how hard it is to have a successful career in music, and never pushed me to go into it. He didn't exactly stand in my way, but he made sure I knew how competitive it is.\n\nWhen I won my job with the CSO, he was the first person I called and he was the one person who cried happy tears with me, because he really understands how rare it is to win a job and how hard musicians work to prepare for auditions.\n\nIs anyone else in your family musical?\n\nCT: My brother, Arthur, is an excellent jazz pianist. He's also a much-respected hematologist/oncologist. My younger daughter Emily enjoyed performing as violinist with her college orchestra for 4 years and is now playing with a community orchestra in Cleveland. I recently appeared as guest conductor with that orchestra, and it was very rewarding to perform together!\n\nJT: Like my dad said, my Uncle is a fantastic jazz pianist and my little sister plays the violin. My mom was a ballet dancer with Joffrey and the Metropolitan Opera in NYC before I was born and is a great lover of classical music (especially opera), and my stepmom, Shirley, is a professional tap dancer and also started the Cleveland Pops.\n\nCarl, this kind of patriotic concert is one of your specialties. How did that come to be?\n\nCT: These concerts do so much to instill a sense of pride and privilege to be living in the U.S.\n\nThere are many portions of the concert that are very moving, but I strive to create a balance of solemn and upbeat selections. It's always great to observe the reaction of the audience when they are touched by particular piece.\n\nWe hear you have a very patriotic clarinet... What's the story behind that?\n\nCT: I have red, white, blue, and green clarinets, and can assemble parts of each to come up with multicolored clarinets. I always play the piccolo obbligato to the Stars and Stripes along with the orchestra piccolo players on a red, white, and blue clarinet.

Find out how these women broke the \"Glass Podium\" and became trailblazers in the industry.\n\nJoAnn Falletta: Classical Woman of the Year\n\nJoAnn Falletta is the Music Director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, Principal Guest Conductor of the Brevard Music Center and Music Advisor to the Hawaii Symphony. This year, she was named by Performance Today Classical Women of the Year.

Each brings his or her own special Broadway experience to the Charlotte stage.\n\nHave you ever been to Charlotte? If not, what are you most excited for duing your visit?\n\nMJ: I was in Charlotte last fall with my band. I always love coming through and I'm excited to make some new fans, and eat some great food!\n\nDG: You bet! My husband was born in Goldsboro. We have family all over the area, who will be attending the show, and we vacation every year on Ocracoke. Can't wait!\n\nHP: I don't think the airport counts so I'm pretty sure this will be my first time performing in Charlotte! I have performed in Garner twice with my solo show. But there's nothing like singing with a Symphomy orchestra and I've already heard great things! I'm also a HUGE \"foodie,\" so I can't wait to eat my way through Charlotte!\n\nHow many shows were you in?\n\nHP: Wow, I don't know! I started acting professionally when I was 13 years old as Friedrich Von Trapp in The Sound of Music so I had already been in at least 13 productions before making my Broadway debut as Marius in Les Miserables. And here I am all these years later and I STILL get the same joy from performing!\n\nDG: This is a trick question for me. Whether it's the Broadway stage, a movie set, a television set, a nightclub or a Symphony Hall, it's all performance! I have been lucky to be in 8 Broadway shows and numerous other productions.\n\nMJ: I've been working on stage in some capacity for 20 years. I did four original companies on Broadway, and countless readings, workshops, and regional productions.\n\nHugh, what was it like performing in Phantom of the Opera, first as Raoul, then coming back to play Phantom years later?\n\nHP: I loved playing both roles! I think I was cast in the right roles at the right time. Hal Prince cast me as Raoul in my early 20's and I was kind of an impetuous \"puppy\" with a lot of energy and confidence. I don't think I had the \"weight\" or life experience to play the Phantom back then. Going back to play the Phantom many years later I had a lot more life experience to draw from so that I could fully embody a more complex character Every experience we have hopefully helps us grow and allows us the opportunity to bring more of ourselves to a role.\n\nMorgan, What was the stage show that has most influenced you and how has that shaped you as an artist?\n\nMJ: I did a production of hair 10 years ago that really shaped me. It was one of my favorite leading roles out of town, right before I got my first Broadway show, and I think I really grew as an artist and became a true leader. I'm very grateful for my years of doing regional theater and learning how to be a leading lady out of town.\n\nDebbie, Being that you have performed with over 175 orchestras, what is your favorite aspect of performing for Symphony audiences?\n\nDG: Every Symphony performance is different depending on the city it takes place!
