        "text": "In a diary entry from the year 1827, Robert Schumann writes:\n\nSolitude is the intimate encounter with oneself, […], it is an active, thoughtful, creative tranquility, the active state of the soul amidst the body’s passivity. – Solitude is the nursemaid of all great spirits, the mother of heroes, the companion of the poet, the friend of the arts.\n\nIn her new album “Solitude,” soprano Katharina Konradi embarks on a musical journey to explore solitude. On this journey, she is accompanied by poets and composers from different time periods. The Cosmos Quartet from Barcelona joins her on her journey. Art songs by composers such as Robert and Clara Schumann, Franz Schubert, and Hugo Wolf, as well as folk songs and French chansons, are waypoints on this journey on which they explore the various facets of solitude together. Miniatures for solo soprano by the Hungarian-French composer György Kurtág serve as transitional elements, providing subtle and sophisticated coherence. Among the special rarities of the recording are the two Catalan songs by the violinist, composer, and conductor Eduard Toldrà.\n\nThe soprano, born in Kyrgyzstan, captivates audiences and critics alike with her vocal brilliance and cultivated emotional depth. The Cosmos Quartet matches her with its honest elegance and compelling expressiveness. Although the Cosmos Quartet and Katharina Konradi only met at the beginning of rehearsals for “Solitude,” a very special magic immediately revealed itself, inherent in the combination of Katharina Konradi’s voice and the Cosmos String Quartet. “String quartet and voice blend incredibly well together – even though the four instruments already form a perfect sonic structure on their own. I always enjoy being surrounded by so many different colors while singing,” describes Katharina Konradi about the collaboration.\n\nThe result of this collaboration and shared journey is an album characterized by emotionality, a variety of moods, and the highest musicality. It invites one to linger, to listen closely, to find tranquility in the beauty of music, and to draw strength from it."
