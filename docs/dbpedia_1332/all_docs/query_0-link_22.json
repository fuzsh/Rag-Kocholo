        "text": "Tall (5'10\"), lovely, statuesque Seattle native Jean Elizabeth Smart was born on September 13, 1951. The second of four children born to a teacher and his wife, she developed an early interest in acting and attended the University of Washington following her graduation from Seattle's Ballard High School. She attained a BA degree in fine arts there.\n\nJean's first professional season was with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival where she went on to perform in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing\" and \"A Moon for the Misbegotten,\" among others. During the late 1970's she built up a strong resume in regional theater with such companies as the Seattle Repertory Theatre (\"Equus,\" \"Fallen Angels\"), ACT (\"A Christmas Carol\"), Pittsburgh Public Theatre (as Lady Macbeth), Alaska Repertory Theatre (\"Terra Nova\"), and Alliance Theatre (\"A History of the American Film\"). Her first significant break came with a starring role in the potent, critically-acclaimed lesbian drama \"Last Summer at Bluefish Cove,\" which earned her an Off-Broadway Drama Desk nomination in 1980. She capped this honor with a Los Angeles Drama Critics award in 1983 when she repeated her triumph on the West Coast.\n\nJean made a highly auspicious Broadway debut in 1981 playing Marlene Dietrich in \"Piaf\" starring Jane Lapotaire, and it was the subsequent TV taping of that show, Piaf (1984), that brought about major Hollywood interest. A regular on the short-lived sitcoms Teachers Only (1982), Reggie (1983) and Aufstand der Verfluchten (1984), Jean hit pure gold in her fourth attempt as the delightfully ditzy Charlene Frazier on Sugarbaker's: Mann muss nicht sein (1986). The show was an instant hit and it was here that she would meet future husband Richard Gilliland, who played the recurring role of co-player Annie Potts' boyfriend J.D. for several seasons.\n\nFeeling confined and fearing typecasting, Jean left the show in 1991 to find more challenging work. She drew major acclaim, giving a chilling portrayal of a true-to-life serial killer in the TV movie Auf dem Todesstrich (1992), long before Charlize Theron copped an Oscar for her equally chilling cinematic version. In other TV movies, Jean earned strong applause for her roles as a mentally challenged woman in Kampf einer Mutter (1994); as a concerned rural mother in Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' classic The Yearling (1994); as an attorney involved in a high-profile murder case in Skrupellos verführt - Die Unschuld des Mörders (1996); as a wife who discovers her longtime husband is gay in Verborgene Gefühle (1998); co-starring with real-life husband Richard Gilliland in Audrey's Rain (2003) as new parents after her sister commits suicide; and as an FBI profiler in Killer Instinct: From the Files of Agent Candice DeLong (2003).\n\nOn stage, Jean she earned a Tony nomination for her delightfully madcap part in the Moss Hart/George S. Kaufman classic comedy farce \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" opposite Nathan Lane. The Broadway show was later made as a TV movie, The Man Who Came to Dinner (2000), with both Lane and Smart.\n\nHaving made her debut with a small role in the crimer Hoodlums (1980), films would never be as strong a venue for Jean as the stage or TV. She did, however, show off her versatility in both comedy and drama with secondary roles with such films as Die Grenzwölfe (1984), the Goldie Hawn vehicle Protocol - Alles tanzt nach meiner Pfeife (1984), Fire with Fire - Verbotene Leidenschaft (1986), Projekt X (1987), Mistress - Die Geliebten von Hollywood (1992), Edie & Pen (1996) and Immer noch ein seltsames Paar (1998). Jean topped the decade off well with two independent films -- earning an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her role as Sarah Polley's ill-natured mother in Guinevere (1999), and first-billed in the mother/daughter road trip dramedy Forever Fabulous (1999) co-starring Jennifer Elise Cox.\n\nRemaining extremely busy into the millennium, Jean went on to win bookend Emmy awards for her guest appearances on the sitcom Frasier (1993) and earned two more Emmy nominations for her potent perms in the crime drama 24: Twenty Four (2001) starring Kiefer Sutherland. She also graced a host of other series with regular/recurring roles on the romantic comedy Meine Frau, ihr Vater und ich (2002); the crimer The District - Einsatz in Washington (2000); the family comedy Center of the Universe (2004) (co-starring John Goodman); the animated program Kim Possible (2002) (as the voice of Dr. Ann Possible); the mystery comedy Samantha Who? (2007) starring Christina Applegate; the revamped crimer Hawaii Five-0 (2010) (as the governor); the crime dramedy Harry's Law (2011); the dark thriller Fargo (2014); the action sci-fi drama Legion (2017); and the detective series Mare of Easttown (2021).\n\nMore recent films include Youth in Revolt (2009), Die Barry Munday Story (2010), Wie beim ersten Mal (2012), Waking (2013), Warren (2014), Miss Meadows - Rache ist süß (2014), The Accountant (2016), Life Itself (2018) and Brampton's Own (2018).\n\nDiagnosed with juvenile diabetes at age 13, Jean has played an active part over the years in public awareness. She has two children with her late husband Richard, son Connor and adopted son (from China) Forrest.\n\nThe entertainment world has enjoyed a six-decade love affair with comedienne/singer Carol Burnett. A peerless sketch performer and delightful, self-effacing personality who rightfully succeeded Lucille Ball as the carrot-topped \"Queen of Television Comedy,\" it was Burnett's traumatic childhood that set the stage for her comedy.\n\nCarol's rags-to-riches story started out in San Antonio, Texas, on April 26, 1933, where she was born to Ina Louise (Creighton) and Joseph Thomas \"Jodie\" Burnett, both of whom suffered from acute alcoholism. As a child, she was left in the care of a beloved grandmother, who shuttled the two of them off to Hollywood, California, where they lived in a boarding house and shared a great passion for the Golden Age of movies. The plaintive, loose-limbed, highly sensitive Carol survived her wallflower insecurities by grabbing attention as a cut-up at Hollywood High School. A natural talent, she attended the University of California and switched majors from journalism to theater. Scouting out comedy parts on TV and in the theater, she first had them rolling in the aisles in the mid-1950s performing a lovelorn novelty song called \"I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles\" (then Secretary of State) in a nightclub act. This led to night-time variety show appearances with Jack Paar and Ed Sullivan and where the career ball really started rolling.\n\nCarol's first big TV breaks came at age 22 and 23 as a foil to a ventriloquist's dummy on the already-established The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show (1950) in 1955, and as Buddy Hackett's gawky girlfriend on the short-lived sitcom Stanley (1956). She also developed an affinity for game shows and appeared as a regular on one of TV earliest, Pantomime Quiz (1947) in 1958. While TV would bring Carol fans by the millions, it was Broadway that set her on the road to stardom. She began as the woebegone Princess Winnifred in the 1959 Broadway musical \"Once Upon a Mattress\" which earned her first Tony Award nomination. [She would later appear in three TV adaptations - Once Upon a Mattress (1964), Once Upon a Mattress (1972) and Es war einmal... Die Prinzessin auf der Erbse (2005).] This, in turn, led to the first of an armful of Emmy Awards as a repertoire player on the popular variety series The Garry Moore Show (1958) in 1959. Burnett invented a number of scene-stealing characters during this time, most notably her charwoman character. With the phenomenal household success of the Moore show, she moved up quickly from second banana to headliner and appeared in a 1962 Emmy-winning special Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall (1962) co-starring close friend Julie Andrews. She earned the Outer Critics Circle Award for the short-lived musical \"Fade Out, Fade In\" (1964); and made her official film debut opposite Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964) star Elizabeth Montgomery and Dean Martin in the lightweight comedy Wer hat in meinem Bett geschlafen? (1963).\n\nNot surprisingly, fellow redhead Lucille Ball, who had been Carol's treasured idol growing up, subsequently became a friend and mentor to the rising funny girl. Hilarious as a guest star on Hoppla Lucy! (1962), Carol appeared as a painfully shy (natch) wallflower type who suddenly blooms in jaw-dropping fashion. Ms. Ball was so convinced of Carol's talent that she offered Carol her own Desilu-produced sitcom, but Burnett had her heart set on fronting a variety show. With her own team of second bananas, including character crony Harvey Korman, handsome foil Lyle Waggoner, and lookalike \"kid sister\" type Vicki Lawrence, the The Carol Burnett Show (1967) became an instant sensation, and earned 22 Emmy Awards during its 11-year run. It allowed Carol to fire off her wide range of comedy and musical ammunition--whether running amok in broad sketch comedy, parodying movie icons such as Gloria Swanson, Shirley Temple, Vivien Leigh or Joan Crawford, or singing/gushing alongside favorite vocalists Jim Nabors, Steve Lawrence, Peggy Lee, Sammy Davis Jr., Ella Fitzgerald and Mel Tormé. She managed to bring in huge stars not known at all for slapstick comedy, including Rock Hudson and even then-Governor Ronald Reagan while providing a platform for such up-and-coming talent as Bernadette Peters and The Pointer Sisters In between, Carol branched out with supporting turns in the films Peter und Tillie (1972), Extrablatt (1974) and Robert Altman's Eine Hochzeit (1978).\n\nHer program, whose last episode aired in March of 1978, was the last truly successful major network variety show to date. Carol took on new challenges to display her unseen dramatic mettle, and accomplished this amazingly in TV-movie showcases. She earned an Emmy nomination for her gripping portrayal of anti-Vietnam War activist Peg Mullen in Fürs Vaterland zu sterben (1979), and convincingly played a woman coming to terms with her alcoholism in Life of the Party: The Story of Beatrice (1982). Neither character bore any traces of the usual Burnett comedy shtick. Though she proved she could contain herself for films, Carol was never able to acquire crossover success into movies, despite trouper work in Vier Jahreszeiten (1981), Annie (1982) (as the hammy villainess Miss Hannigan), and Noises Off! - Der nackte Wahnsinn (1992). The last two roles had been created onstage by Broadway's Dorothy Loudon.\n\nCarol would return from time to time to the stage and concert forums with productions of \"Plaza Suite\", \"I Do! I Do\", \"Follies\", \"Company\" and \"Putting It Together\". A second Tony nomination came for her comedy work in \"Moon Over Buffalo\" in 1995. Carol has made frequent appearances on her own favorite TV shows too, such as Password (1961) (along with Elizabeth Montgomery, Carol was considered one of the show's best players) and the daytime soaper, All My Children (1970).\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Carol attempted a TV comeback of sorts, with a couple of new variety formats in Carol & Company (1990) and The Carol Burnett Show (1991), but neither could recreate the magic of the original. She has appeared, sporadically, on various established shows such as \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"Mad About You\" (for which she won an Emmy), \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (Emmy nomination), \"Hawaii Five-0,\" \"Glee\" and \"Hot in Cleveland.\" Befitting such a classy clown, she has received a multitude of awards over time, including the 2003 Kennedy Center Honors and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. She was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1985. Her personal life has been valiant--tears in between the laughs. Married three times, her second union with jazz-musician-turned-variety-show-producer Joe Hamilton produced three daughters. Eldest girl, Carrie Hamilton, an actress and former teen substance abuser, tragically died of lung and brain cancer at age 38. Shortly before Carrie's death, mother and daughter managed to write a play, together, entitled \"Hollywood Arms\", based on Carol's 1986 memoir, \"One More Time\". The show subsequently made it to Broadway.\n\nToday, at age 80 plus, Carol has been seen less frequently but still continues to make appearances, especially on TV. Most recently she has guested on the shows \"Glee,\" \"Hot in Cleveland\" and the revivals of \"Hawaii Five-0\" and \"Mad About You.\" As always she signs off a live appearance with her signature ear tug (acknowledging her late grandmother), reminding us all, between the wisecracks and the songs, how glad and lucky we all are to still have some of \"this time together\".\n\nSusan Lucci was born on December 23, 1946, in Scarsdale, New York, to Jeanette (Granquist) and Victor Lucci, a building contractor. She is of Italian (father) and Swedish, German, and French (mother) descent. Susan grew up in Garden City. Since she can remember, she wanted to be a performer, and through her teenage years, took voice lessons, dance lessons, and participated in community theater. In high school she was the ideal student: took many honors classes, was a cheerleader, staff writer for the school newspaper, was a foreign exchange student to Norway, and performed in the school musicals, including lead roles in \"Oklahoma\" and \"The King and I\". After graduating with Honors from Garden City High School, she was accepted and attended Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York, which was noted for its theater program. After graduating with a BFA in theater arts, she moved to New York City, and began going to auditions. One of her first jobs was that of a color girl for CBS. Every day she would report to the studio, and sit on a stool, as technicians developed the new color cameras. Most of her acting work consisted of Off-Broadway understudy roles, day-player roles on soap operas, and extra and stand-in work for movies. In 1969 at the age of twenty-three, she auditioned for a brand new soap opera that was to be called All My Children (1970). She landed the role of Erica Kane, which is still considered by many critics to be one of the best roles on television written for women. Around this time, she met an married restaurant owner Helmut Huber. In 1978, Susan received her first Daytime Emmy nomination. She was nominated again in 1981, and nominated almost every year since then. In the early 1980s, she became the first soap opera actress to appear on the cover of major magazines, as well as the first to star in Movies of the Week. But what made her a household name by the late 1980s was her string of Emmy losses. It became a running joke that the 'Queen of Daytime Television' had no crown. It seems that every time that she would have a real knockout year, another daytime diva would have a more unique story line, or a more challenging acting role, including multiple personalities, or an actress playing more than one character. But in 1999, on her 19th Emmy nomination, she won. She received a four minute standing ovation. Now, after twenty one nominations, she is considered to be one of the most honored performers in the history of television, daytime or primetime.\n\nWith several decades of wide-ranging credits to his name, Robert Gant has become a well known actor and participant both in Hollywood and abroad. From television to film, dramatic to comedic, his portrayals have spanned all genres. In one of his most well known roles, Robert starred as Professor Ben Bruckner in Showtime's hit television series, \"Queer as Folk.\" In that groundbreaking show, Robert explored broad dramatic terrain through his character, including being married in the first legal gay marriage ever portrayed on television. His list of credits include recurring parts on multiple series, television and theatrical films, and becoming television's first gay spy in the film, \"Kiss Me Deadly.\" His many guest starring roles include a well known turn on the TV hit show, \"Friends,\" where he played one of two men Phoebe was dating simultaneously. Robert also stars as Melissa Benoist's Kryptonian father Zor-El on \"Supergirl\" and as Todd Crimsen on the Netflix series, \"Thirteen Reasons Why.\"\n\nRobert's love of acting and performing began at an early age. He started doing television commercials and joined the Screen Actors Guild at the age of ten in his home state of Florida. He attended undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania and law school at Georgetown University. While studying, he never gave up on his artistic passions and took part in numerous singing groups and theatrical productions. Interestingly, it was his career as an attorney that brought him to Los Angeles when he accepted a position with the world's then largest law firm, Baker & McKenzie. In a twist of fate, the firm's Los Angeles office was closed soon after. Taking that as a sign, he made the decision to focus all of his time on the entertainment business.\n\nRobert's experiences in Hollywood are not limited to performing. He was a producing partner in the production company, Mythgarden. Its feature film, \"Save Me,\" which stars Robert along with Judith Light and Chad Allen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Robert also co-produced, co-wrote, and starred in the Netflix-distributed period drama \"Milada,\" the true story of Czech heroine Milada Horakova, who was, in 1950, the first woman executed in Czech history by the Communist government. In addition, Robert has completed the first draft of his first novel and, with a writing partner, is developing television projects and penning screenplays.\n\nWhile he has given time to a number of philanthropic and political causes, such as HRC (by which he was given their National Equality Award), GLAAD (by which he was given their Davidson/Valentini Award for the promotion of equal rights in the community), and Lambda Legal, Robert's \"torch issue\" has been that of aging in the gay community. He's supported such organizations as SAGE (Senior Advocacy for GLBT Elders), which named him their first Honorary Elder, and GLEH (Gay and Lesbian Elder Housing), for which he served as a Board Member, and has been committed to addressing the community's collective challenge of growing old, alone. In 2016, Robert received the ADL Heroes Award from the Anti-Defamation League for his work on behalf of the LGBT and aging communities.\n\nA native of the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, D.W. Moffett never gave a thought to acting until after he graduated from Stanford University with a degree in International Relations. While he went to work at Chicago's Continental Bank, he also enrolled in an acting class to broaden his artistic horizon and, more importantly, to meet girls. He found a social life - and his life's work.\n\nMoving along his new career path, Moffett became a founding member of Chicago's Remains Theatre Ensemble, where he starred in, directed and/or produced over 40 productions. He first came to national attention starring in Larry Kramer's landmark AIDS drama \"The Normal Heart\" at New York's Public Theatre. Subsequently, he appeared on Broadway in \"The Boys of Winter\" and \"The Real Thing,\" as well as a Los Angeles production of Jon Robin Baitz's \"The End of the Day.\" In his most recent return to the stage, D. W. was invited to play opposite Kevin Spacey in the critically acclaimed production of \"The Philadelphia Story\" at the Old Vic in London in 2005.\n\nSince making the move to Hollywood, Moffett has divided his time between film and television. Favorite movie roles include appearances in \"Stealing Beauty\", directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, \"Thirteen\", directed by Catherine Hardwicke, \"Twisted\", directed by Phillip Kaufman, and Steven Soderbergh's \"Traffic\", for which he won a Screen Actor's Guild Award.\n\nMoffett's television credits include the ground-breaking TV movie, \"An Early Frost\" as well as series regular roles in \"The Oldest Rookie\", \"Hidden Palms\", 'Skin\", \"For Your Love\", \"Chicago Sons\" and \"Life is Wild\" .
