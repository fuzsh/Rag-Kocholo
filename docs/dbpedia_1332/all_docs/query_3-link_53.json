        "text": "1) Clara Schumann was born in Leipzig on September 13, 1819 and was a distinguished pianist from the Romantic era.\n\n2) Her parents divorced when Clara was four and she was raised by her father Friedrich Wieck.\n\n3) Inspired by her father, she started to learn the piano.\n\n4) At the age of eight Clara performed at the home of Dr Ernst Carus, the director of a mental hospital at Colditz Castle.\n\n5) It was there that she met her husband - gifted pianist Robert Schumann - and the couple had eight children.\n\n6) At the age of nine, Clara made her public debut in a concert in the Leipziger Gewandhaus.\n\n7) She was quickly considered to be a child prodigy playing the works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and more, all over Europe.\n\n8) Despite her musical success, Clara's life was hit by tragedy with four of her children dying before her. A son and her husband ended their lives in mental asylums.\n\n9) Clara became deaf in her later life and often used a wheelchair."
