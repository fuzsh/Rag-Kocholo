        "text": "Post your comments below\n\nIn a single year two centuries ago — 1810 — two of the greatest composers to rise in the shadow of Beethoven were born within just months of each other.\n\nFrederic Chopin, son of Poland. Robert Schumann, out of Germany.\n\nPioneers of Romanticism. Icons of the era. They didn’t rock like Lady Gaga or rap like Jay-Z. But they made exquisite music that would still fill halls after two hundred years. Which the Black Eyed Peas, Grammy night sizzle aside, may or may not do. They had madness, passion, poetry.\n\nThis hour, On Point: Anthony Tommasini on Chopin and Schumann at 200.\n\nGuests:\n\nAnthony Tommasini, chief classical music critic for The New York Times. His recent article about Chopin and Schumann \"Born the Same Year, Similarities End There.\"\n\nGarrick Ohlsson, pianst. He won first prize in the 1970 International Frederic Chopin Piano Competition, and has appeared as a soloist with every major orchestra in the United States. In 2008 he received a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance.\n\nLater this hour:\n\nThe Boston Globe's James Reed joins us to talk about last night's Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. He live-blogged the awards last night on Boston.com."
