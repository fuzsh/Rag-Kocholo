        "text": "E laine Marie Schumann, 82, of Sabetha, Kansas passed away Thursday, March 16, 2017 peacefully surrounded by her family.\n\nElaine was born September 21, 1934 to Paul and Emma (Burger) Lukert. She graduated in 1952 from Sabetha High School. Elaine married her high school sweetheart, James Gary Tyler, in 1953. Three children were born to this union. Gary passed away unexpectedly in 1977. In 1981, Elaine married Robert Schumann, and they enjoyed many years together.\n\nDuring her time in retail at Hughes Clothing and Nila’s Gem & Gift Shoppe, Elaine loved the camaraderie and fun she had with her co-workers. She delighted in her lifelong friendships. An avid K-State fan, Elaine reveled in all Wildcat sporting events. Most of all, Elaine cherished her family and the time spent with her grandchildren. Elaine battled Parkinson’s disease over 20 years with determination and dignity.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her first husband, Gary; her parents; and two brothers, Milan Lukert and Lynn Lukert.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Robert Schumann; her children, Jeff (Wilma) Tyler, Cindy (Dave) Remmers, and James (Janie) Tyler; her step-sons, Rob (Jeanne-Marie) Schumann and John (Sharon) Schumann; and grandchildren, Jonathan Tyler, Katie Tyler, Brad (Jamie) Tyler, Matt Tyler, Jamie (Greg) Strahm, Samantha (Bobby) Hamilton, Megan (Jesse) Snyder, Emma Tyler, Mitchell Tyler, Jack Tyler, Monique Schumann, Ryan Schumann and Austin Schumann, and four great grandchildren, cousins, nieces and nephews."
