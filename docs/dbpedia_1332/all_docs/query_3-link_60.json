        "text": "Larry Schumann, 65, of Marshall, Minn., died under the care of Hospice on Friday, Jan. 7, 2022, at the Avera Morningside Heights Care Center in Marshall.\n\nVisitation will be held from 5-7 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 21, 2022, at Living Word Lutheran Church in Marshall. A prayer service is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Visitation will continue one hour prior to the service on Saturday, from 10 a.m. until the time of services at 11 a.m., again at the church.\n\nMemorial services will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 22, 2022, at Living Word Lutheran Church in Marshall, Minn.\n\nA reception for attendees to follow in the church basement.\n\nPrivate interment will be in the Ihlen Cemetery in Ihlen at a later date.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials are preferred to the family and will be directed for future donations.\n\nLarry John Schumann was born February 15, 1956, in Pipestone, Minn., to Marcus and LaVonne (Johnson) Schumann. He grew up in Pipestone and attended Saint Paul Lutheran Church. He graduated from Pipestone High School with the class of 1974 and then went to work for his uncle Stanley before finding work with his father.\n\nLarry’s artistic flare lent to him finding work with Jack Keers Painting which he then pursued as a profession for the next 35 years. He would go on to own and operate Pipestone Paint and Wallpaper. Larry married Rhonda Allen in Pipestone and the couple had two children: Cory and Jennifer.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Larry was again married to Randi (Larson) Ebsen. Larry welcomed her children, Marti and Clint, into the blended family. The family moved to Brookings, S.D., where Larry become the building maintenance coordinator at South Dakota State University. In 2010, Larry and Randi moved to Marshall.\n\nLarry loved music and had an affinity for old-time western shows, evidenced by his hours watching TV Land. Although his music preferences didn’t always match up with Randi, he still spent hours teaching her how to paint and would make up songs to sing while working – many of which may not be appropriate to mention here! Many knew that he disliked cold weather nor was he fond of being too hot. He just enjoyed a good sweatshirt and thrived in the spring and fall. Larry was always willing to lend a helping hand or compassionate ear to those in need, unless you happened to be a clown or a spider.\n\nHe will be dearly missed.\n\nAfter more than 25 years of determination and courage while fighting cancer, both Larry and God decided it was enough. Larry Schumann died on Friday, January 7, 2022, in Marshall, Minn. He reached the age of 65 years, 10 months, and 23 days. Blessed be his memory.\n\nLarry is survived by his wife, Randi Ebsen-Schumann of Marshall; children, Cory (and Shari) Schumann of Pipestone, Jennifer Fisher of Audubon, Iowa, Clint (and Sandra) Ebsen of Browerville; sister, Sandi Schumann of Pipestone; brother, Rick (and Brenda) Schumann of Mansfield, Texas; grandchildren, Trevor Schumann, Jada Schumann, Zachary Grimes, Devin Fisher, Victoria Gilbertson, Verlyn Gilbertson, Nolan Ebsen, Miya Ebsen; sister-in-law, Mary Willaby; fur babies, Petey, Buster, Maggie, Huckleberry; nephews, nieces, other relatives and friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Marcus and LaVonne Schumann; step-daughter, Marti Gilbertson; fur babies, Pee Wee and Gracie Mae.\n\n(Hamilton Funeral Home,\n\nMarshall)"
