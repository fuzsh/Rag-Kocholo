        "text": "In the late 1830s, Clara Schumann’s piano compositions began to shift from crowd-pleasing virtuosic showpieces to more complex and less openly showy works. While Nancy Reich has noted this tendency in her biography of Clara Schumann, there is little discussion on how this aesthetic shift may have been affected by the two major changes in Clara’s life in 1840: her marriage to the decidedly anti-virtuoso music critic and composer Robert Schumann, and her emancipation from her overbearing father and impresario, Friedrich Wieck. This paper examines how Robert Schumann’s disparaging views on virtuosity and the strained relationship between the Schumanns and Friedrich Wieck may have affected the shift in virtuosity in Clara Schumann’s piano compositions, drawing on primary sources such as the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, as well as recent writings on musical virtuosity in the nineteenth century, most notably those of Liszt scholar Dana Gooley. After positing possible reasons for this change in Clara Schumann’s compositions, this paper discusses the broader implications of a shift away from virtuosity in light of the opposition emerging in the nineteenth century between “popular” and “high” musical styles. While the shift in virtuosity in Clara Schumann’s piano compositions likely had multiple complex causes, this paper argues that one can gain new insights into Clara Schumann’s works particularly when one examines Robert Schumann’s anti-virtuosic critiques.\n\nThe reception during his life of Robert Schumann’s early piano music is a rare case of rejection, both by critics and public, as well as by friends and family. Regardless of his numerous professional contacts, and continuous efforts to spread his music, Schumann was systematically marginalized during his first years as a composer. This paper makes a review of such reception, relying on documents that testify to the difficulties he encountered trying to establish his piano music as part of the standard repertoire.\n\nThe interpretation of pianoforte music as taught by my great teacher, Clara Schumann, is a matter of tradition; and tradition meant very much in those days now so far off. We were not guided merely by editions brought out, more or less responsibly, by contemporary musicians. Tradition, as we all know, is that which is handed down from father to son, or from teacher to pupils who themselves turn into teachers, and Clara Schumann may be said to have had this in direct descent from Bach and Beethoven. As for Schumann, Chopin and Mendelssohn, the one was her husband and the other two were friends close enough for her to remember what it was they wanted. 1 Adelina de Lara, 'Clara Schumann's Teaching' Schumann's pedagogical significance has long been acknowledged. 2 Specialized studies have mined her students' memoirs and recordings to build arguments for historically informed performance practices. 3 Her influence transcended her pupils, shaping not only piano performance, but concert culture and, indeed, the understanding of music's aesthetic role, for over a century. 4 From a music-historiographical perspective,\n\ncomposed his songs with two different audiences in mind. He marketed them widely to amateur singers, who could not be expected to partake in this process, but he also considered the Liederkreis to be a private genre, intended for an exclusive circle of refined and sophisticated musicians. At the same time, Schumann knew that his audience was not necessarily restricted to the handful of Davidsbundler and the mass of philistines whom he saw around him. (226--27) Each of these claims, avowed as if truths given to verification, is freighted with all the obscurities as to how and for whom the composer composes. To contend that Schumann &quot;viewed the construction of musical mean­ ing as an interactive process&quot; is, first of all, to suggest that Schumann sets himself apart from his contemporaries in this endeavor-that he is un­ usual in this regard. This in itself should raise suspicions. But that&#39;s the least of it. It doesn&#39;t take much imagination to suppose that a composer...\n\nRobert Schumann's relationship with the Letters has been widely recognized, and his early interest in the connections between literature and music has lasted his entire life. For him, music and literature were not separate, but were different facets of the same transforming agent: art, whose function is to convert the prosaic of existence into poetry, understood in a broad sense, applicable to all vital aspects. Through his own writings, this paper reviews the profound relationship between the composer and literature, from childhood to his last years, remarking the early, and lasting, influence of his favorite writer, Jean Paul.\n\nThe year 1849 witnessed a period of intense activity for Robert Schumann (1810–56) which, among other chamber works, saw the creation of his op.73, initially entitled Soirée-Stücke für Pianoforte und Clarinette and subsequently published by C. Luckhardt, Kassel in July of the same year as his Fantasiestücke, op.73. Both versions have been recorded many times, mainly on clarinet or violoncello, but also on a variety of other instruments. It is fair to say they are a veritable chestnut in Schumann’s chamber music repertory. For this reason, we believe the background, as well as aspects of performing this exceptional work, deserves further scrutiny.\n\nThis paper proposes a new approach to the performance of Schumann's music, in particular to his song cycle Dichterliebe op. 48. Starting from the many productive instabilities and inconsistencies that characterize the compositional approach in Dichterliebe, I ask under which conditions we could think a performance practice that embraces these inconsistencies instead of stabilizing them into a finished performance. To do so, I propose the appropriation from music performance of the philosophical notion of \"the problem\" as formulated by Gilles Deleuze, connecting it with the \"pre-individual\" in Gilbert Simondon and the notion of \"outside,\" mostly in the acceptation of Maurice Blanchot and Michel Foucault. A critique is enacted of what I suggest calling the traditional \"image of musical thought.\" From this critique can emerge a performance practice that moves away from the \"problem of performance,\" regarded in its traditional form as a representative practice oriented towards recognition, and that embraces instead the \"performance of the problem,\" where the problematic dimension of Schumann is enhanced and further dynamized."
