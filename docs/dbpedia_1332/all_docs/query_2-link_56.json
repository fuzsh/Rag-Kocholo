        "text": "For inspirational books, Nelson Mandela wins it in a walk for me as both author and subject. No Easy Walk to Freedom became a book after it was a Presidential address, and I see is also someone else’s pick above. Mandela: The Authorized Biography is pretty comprehensive about his life and political career and especially the chapter of history that led to the end of apartheid. When I despair about the politics of dealing with movement conservatism in North America, Mandela is a useful reminder of someone who was able to effectively come to terms with a movement (and a general dynamic) that was far worse and more unpromising in so many ways.\n\nThe World Religions Bible is an excellent anthology of scripture from a wide variety of religions, and would rank above the Bible alone as an inspirational text for me. Philosophical Taoism is probably — aside from the ambient and ubiquitous influence of Christianity as a Westerner — the religious philosophy that’s influenced me the most in daily life, so the Tao Te Ching would be on there. For thinking about politics, Sun Tzu’s The Art of War — while it may be something of an Eighties business-culture cliche — is also genuinely valuable. So is Machiavelli’s The Discourses, which can be found in packaged form with The Prince in various editions but is a far more comprehensive guide to his thought than the latter (I’ve often thought that if everyone who was accused of being “Machiavellian” was actually so in the sense of having actually read and absorbed much of what’s in The Discourses, it would be far for the better). Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth was also a formative influence.\n\nCan the mockery of my choice, The Lord of the Rings, at least be gentle?\n\nI’ll defend it thus: believers get from the bible a source of solace, of guidance (WWJD), and of beauty. Also, for many, the very familiarity of the text weaves it somehow into the essence of their being.\n\nI was one of those children who had read the whole trilogy (this was before there was a Silmarillion) dozens of times before reaching puberty. More recently I had tears in my eyes at several points during the movies because, to my mind, Jackson just got it so right. I find much of the prose stirring (yes, I know some of it’s wooden, but so is much of the bible), even to the point of wishing Frodo’s going into the West to be read at my (hopefully not impending) funeral. I read it for comfort and solace during my teenage years as my mother was slowly dying of cancer. It offers the possibility of what I can only describe as some sort of moral fidelity to a fictitious Event. (Recall that Badiou himself believes that the non-existence of the resurrection is no obstacle to its evental status.) I find the tragic dedication to duty and beauty inspiring.\n\nAnd yes, I know full well that it’s racist, classist, sexist, and probably a couple of -ists I never noticed. What the name of that Lacanian construction that Zizek keeps referring to? – the one that goes “I know full well…but yet…”\n\nWithout The Lord of The Rings, my life would have been diminished, and maybe I would be less of a person. I am grateful for it, and to it. I think that a Christian would say all of those things about the bible.\n\nWhat a delightful set of posts! And we should share poetry more often! :-)\n\nJust after posting last night and just before falling asleep, I did come up with a few more things, especially films: there are two types of films that I also return to, one about (the meaning of) ‘Life’, and the other about Justice/Politics; ‘Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin’ would fall in the first category, and ‘Cry Freedom’ (and most of what Ken Loach did) in the latter.\n\nAnd I probably was too pessimistic about non-fiction too; only two weeks ago I re-re-read ‘The cost of Living’ by Arundhati Roy, – but then again, that is such a short book (an essay, really), that it could be on a website too.\n\nAutobiographies can do the trick too – I haven’t read JS Mill’s, which was mentioned, which sounds like a great idea. But in those cases it’s more that I keep thinking about, and remembering, what i read – without physically returning to the book.\n\nAnd yes, Brecht, and Le petit prince… and Master and Margarita (but that one has the Bible -sort of- weaved in, so it’s bending the rules of the game). I also read an excellent biography of Bulgakov (called ‘Manuscripts don’t burn’ – though I read it in Dutch), which makes one read MM very differently, and makes it much more powerful.\n\nColin (and others) are right that an important question is what one needs ‘this book’ for – different books/media for different purposes (the same in fact with poetry – there is also ‘life poetry’ but also lots of ‘political poetry’ (the many wonderful Amnesty International collections, for example).\n\nI think the idea of books ‘provid[ing] support’ is a pretty deadly one, killing for literature, but it is fun to read bits and pieces of people’s favourite poetry which is how the tread has turned out. I second Tohm Hurka’s choice of Larking and would add Edward Thomas who is similar to Larkin in lots of ways, just as direct and intimate, but with a very different emotional resonance. Here’s one which I prefer to all other WWI poems:\n\nAs the team’s head-brass flashed out on the turn\n\nThe lovers disappeared into the wood.\n\nI sat among the boughs of the fallen elm\n\nThat strewed the angle of the fallow, and\n\nWatched the plough narrowing a yellow square\n\nOf charlock. Every time the horses turned\n\nInstead of treading me down, the ploughman leaned\n\nUpon the handles to say or ask a word,\n\nAbout the weather, next about the war.\n\nScraping the share he faced towards the wood,\n\nAnd screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed\n\nOnce more.\n\nThe blizzard felled the elm whose crest\n\nI sat in, by a woodpecker’s round hole,\n\nThe ploughman said. ‘When will they take it away? ‘\n\n‘When the war’s over.’ So the talk began â€“\n\nOne minute and an interval of ten,\n\nA minute more and the same interval.\n\n‘Have you been out? ‘ ‘No.’ ‘And don’t want to, perhaps? ‘\n\n‘If I could only come back again, I should.\n\nI could spare an arm, I shouldn’t want to lose\n\nA leg. If I should lose my head, why, so,\n\nI should want nothing more…Have many gone\n\nFrom here? ‘ ‘Yes.’ ‘Many lost? ‘ ‘Yes, a good few.\n\nOnly two teams work on the farm this year.\n\nOne of my mates is dead. The second day\n\nIn France they killed him. It was back in March,\n\nThe very night of the blizzard, too. Now if\n\nHe had stayed here we should have moved the tree.’\n\n‘And I should not have sat here. Everything\n\nWould have been different. For it would have been\n\nAnother world.’ ‘Ay, and a better, though\n\nIf we could see all all might seem good.’ Then\n\nThe lovers came out of the wood again:\n\nThe horses started and for the last time\n\nI watched the clods crumble and topple over\n\nAfter the ploughshare and the stumbling team.\n\n@John\n\nWell, as for the proposition that you look to books for truth rather than support, obviously, insofar as you admit that the two may fail to coincide, to decide to choose words that are comforting rather than true is to engage in transparent self-deception. That transparency defeats the project of choosing support over truth, because if you know you’ve chosen comforting lies, that itself removes any comfort and support the lies might provide, plus it saddles you with the consiousness of yet another example of your own stupidity and weakness.\n\nThat leaves the proposition that the truth is invariably anti-supportive, that it systematically afflicts and undermines, rather than comforts and supports. Here we are indeed at a question of faith, as it were, and I can’t dispose of this objection of yours as logical inconsistency, as I could your first objection. Or perhaps, to put it more inclusively, your first objection only makes sense if it is simply your second objection stated in a less direct form. If you start from the assumption that the project of setting out to find comfort and support in the truth is one that can achieve success, then it is certainly true that you might indeed set out to find comfort in books, because you believe that you can leave your BS detectors fully operational, and at least some comforting things you read will survive the test and prove as true as they are supportive. “Not all that glitters is gold.”, so to speak, and many comforting things will prove deceptive, but that hardly means that there is nothing that both glitters with comfort, and is also the gold of truth.\n\nBut, of course, what Shakespeare actually wrote, and it is admittedly a hard teaching, is that, “All that glitters is not gold.” Nothing that is supportive is true. To cite another hard teaching, or perhaps the same hard teaching in another form, what Jesus says about spiritual riches is that to those who already have much, more will be given, but those who have little will have even that taken from them.\n\nThis really is a matter of axioms, so it’s not as if there is any way you could be convinced that I am right by some argument, or that you, if you truly believe that some things that glitter are gold, can be convinced that I am right. But I think it is worth formulating as clearly as possible these axioms we live by.\n\nAnd, just to make my seemingly anti-social creed a little more accessible, if not convincing, think of it in terms of perspective. No matter how wise and generous we might be, all of us are stuck in a universe of experience in which we are the absolute and sole center. But the truth, which I think you will admit unless you are a solipsist, is that we are absolutely not the center of anything. We are quite contingent. There was a universe here before we existed, there will be one after we’re gone, and even during this brief period when we are around, that universe would function quite well without us.\n\nOf course there’s nothing terribly disquieting about this Copernican dethronement of the ego as expressed in the abstract. We all have to stop being practical solipsists some time around age 2 0r 3 in order to successfully navigate an outside world that really would squish us like bugs unless we followed its rules rather than live as if things were arranged entirely as we would like, and we lived in a magic world in which we merely had to wish to make things happen. It’s not as if you have to achieve Buddha nature to get to the point of following the world’s rules in order to exploit them to maximize your comfort. That’s a trick we all master by age 2 or 3.\n\nWhat you don’t have to do to get by is take this Copernican dethronement of your ego any further than just getting by. My idea is that truth and comfort battle it out as categorical enemies in that zone beyond merely getting by. Nothing that reassures you that you are the center of the universe is at all true, because that is simply not true. And anything that tends to the realization of the truth that you are not the center of the universe, and takes that realization past the minimum it has to attain in order for you to get by, is not going to be comforting. Where we have not completed our own individual Copernican revolutions and attained complete selflessness, there we find the truth undermining and obnoxious, but it is only there that we find any truth.\n\nHopefully it’s ok to interpret “people” sufficiently broadly to include stuff like webcomics. The conclusion of the Phillipe thread in Achewood was weirdly poignant for me (not least because it was the last cohesive and complete storyline in Achewood). And in terms of the sheer number of times I’ve returned to an item for inspiration and solace per time unit, nothing much compares to the xkcd with zombie Marie Antoinette. (This is cheating the chosen metric a little, because it’s printed out over my monitor at work. But still.)\n\nA quick argument for why including comics/webcomics seems fair. A comic combines the full cognitive engagement of text with the gestalt instantaneous recognition of static visual art, so it’s a uniquely well-positioned format to convey emotional relief. (Which just makes the nearly comprehensive fail of Hallmark cards, whose insert passages are uniformly wincing-cringe-inducing, all the more astonishing. When scholars generations hence look back on us, they’ll comment drily on our apparent inability or unwillingness to match the poetry of our epoch’s best writers to the visuals of our epoch’s best artists and then mass-produce them on cardstock. If you’re commissioning a couplet or sonnet to pair with a ‘get well soon’ or ‘congratulations on your achievement,’ you’re doing it wrong.) It’s nice to be able to instantly reabsorb the image and allow the text to be recalled to mind, with gaps of words already filling in.\n\nIt’s much easier (for me at least) to imprint an extended block of poetry into memory by superimposing each stanza on a readily identifiable and coherently related image, rather than memorize the sound or syllables themselves. (Fair warning though, this led me to memorize sweet is the sleep of hand-to-hand, sweeter still the sleep of heart-to-heart while completely forgetting its context. Of the various questions one’s future in-laws can ask on a first visit, there’s few more panic-inducing than “last night on your way to bed, were you quoting Sumerian fertility poetry to me?” … Uh. … “Just wanted to check if you two had news for us.” Dislodged quotation snippets are dangerous in the era of google.)"
