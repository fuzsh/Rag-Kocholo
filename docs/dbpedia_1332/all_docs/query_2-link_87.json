        "text": "Here’s the interview rockcritics.com published 12 years ago with Paul Williams. It was Pat Thomas, I’m pretty sure, who suggested the title, and I saw no reason to dispute it.\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nThe Godfather of Rock Criticism: Paul Williams\n\nBy Pat Thomas, with Christoph Gurk (August 2001)\n\nGrowing up in the late 1970s, there was very little available to read by legendary rock scribe Paul Williams. His books were out of print, old issues of Crawdaddy! were long gone, and Paul himself was M.I.A. for the most part. It wasn’t until Paul published his first major tome on Bob Dylan [Bob Dylan: Performing Artist] that I was able to get into the meat of what made Paul great. Here was a book about Dylan that didn’t worry about what color shirt he was wearing the day he recorded this song or that one. The book went past that bullshit and got into the essence of the music. How does it sound and more importantly how does it feel? Paul was able to explain feelings about Bob’s music that I didn’t know I had. And most importantly, although Paul’s writing was very personal, he left his ego at the door. Later when I met Paul, there was no ego, no “I am a rock legend” or “I know everything” attitude, that I have experienced time and time again from music journalists with far less to brag about than Paul Williams.\n\nPaul, for many reasons, is not gonna be on MTV interviewing Pearl Jam, he’s not gonna blow hot wind in front of a video camera doing a documentary on the history of rock n roll–he’s just not that kind of guy. I strongly suggest you check out his revamped and reborn Crawdaddy!. No ads, no corporate sponsorship, just solid heartfelt writing. Paul’s writing has moved me to check out bands I never would have dreamed of checking out, because he brings the human element into it, gets inside of himself, seemingly getting inside of me. Now, I know this sounds all flowery and new agey, but Paul came out of the 1960s and he never lost his naiveté about listening to music; it still sounds fresh to his ears. He’s not some jaded hack on the staff of (fill-in-the-blank magazine) being forced to listen to crap he doesn’t wanna listen to, he only reviews what he really likes and what truly moves him. I think that’s rare these days.\n\nOne of Paul’s faves is Neil Young, who I personally have given up on (though I applaud his commitment to keep waving the flag). Nevertheless, it’s a Neil Young song title that sums up Paul Williams for me, and that’s “Mr. Soul.” What follows is a previously unpublished interview I did with Paul in a café in Germany a couple of years back. (Also joining us was Christoph Gurk, who at that time was editor of Germany’s most respected, if overly scholastic, music magazine, SPEX).\n\nSo what does Paul have to brag about, but doesn’t? The man started the first real rock music magazine, Crawdaddy!, while still a teenager–a year-and-a-half before Jann Wenner startedRolling Stone. Via Crawdaddy!, he gave a lot of other “legends” their first writing outlet: Sandy Pearlman, Peter Guralnick, Jon Landau, and Richard Meltzer, to name just a few. He also hung with Tim Leary and sang with him on John and Yoko’s “Give Peace A Chance” single, recorded in a Montreal hotel room in 1969. If you ever get a chance to see the video from that day, Paul’s clearly in it…I could go on all day. He’s the man. Long may he run.\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nSomething New: The Birth of Crawdaddy!\n\nPat Thomas: Why don’t we just start at the beginning: How you first got into writing. Were you doing any fiction or non-fiction writing before you actually started writing about rock ‘n’ roll?\n\nPaul Williams: Well, not really, I was writing high school term papers or something like that, but I usually say that I got started as a professional writer by publishing myself, because when I started Crawdaddy! I didn’t have anyone else writing for me so I had to write all this stuff to fill up the pages. And it took a while, but after all I got a sense of what I wanted to do, you know? And I started sounding more like something that was really me. My first publications outside ofCrawdaddy! were either, like, Hit Parader reprinting something from Crawdaddy!, and then other magazines calling me up because Crawdaddy! was starting to get attention.\n\nChristopher Gurk: That was ’66, right?\n\nPaul Williams: Yeah, the first issue came out at the end of January in 1966.\n\nPat Thomas: And how old were you then, Paul?\n\nPaul Williams: 17.\n\nPat Thomas: How did you get the idea? This was really the first rock magazine or fanzine…\n\nPaul Williams: In the States, yeah.\n\nPat Thomas: So how did you dream this up?\n\nPaul Williams: Well, there were two big influences on me. One was that I’d been a science fiction fan and was used to putting out magazines. When I was 14, I put out my first science fiction fanzine, and there was a whole community of people doing that, and I put that out for a couple years. You know, mimeograph stencils and writing your own magazine seemed normal to me coming out of that world. The other influence was, when I started Crawdaddy! I was at Swarthmore College near Philadelphia, I’d grown up in Cambridge and the Boston suburbs, and there was a very active folk scene, and of course there were folk music magazines…\n\nContinue reading “From the Archives: Paul Williams (2001)” →\n\nSeven months ago it was 45 years ago today.\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“Like an overattended child, this album is spoiled. It reeks of horns and harps, harmonica quartets, assorted animal noises, and a 41-piece orchestra.”\n\n– Richard Goldstein, review of Sgt. Pepper in the New York Times, 1967\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“So, as expected, it had to be the Beatles themselves to do the job of (one-more-time) summing up the recent by summing up the whole thing in a soft cataclysmic combination of death, sleep and multiplicity/variety, as if they hadn’t done it before… so this time it would have to be a really real end-of-culture/end-of-the-world thing. And that’s precisely what Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band was/is. Bringing with it the consequent death of art forever (until someone forgets) and subsequent everybody-influenced-by-everybody-but-particularly-by-the-Beatles-and-Sgt.-Pepper, eventually dispersing it everywhere and thus inevitably devaluing the specific Sgt. Pepper focal point.”\n\n– Richard Meltzer, The Aesthetics of Rock, 1970\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“The comparison with Gershwin, in fact, is not unjustified. Just as ‘Embraceable You’ and ‘I Can’t Get Started’ were flawless popular songs but ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ was disastrous pretention, so with the Beatles. At the level of ‘Baby Let Me Drive Your Car’ or ‘Hard Days Night,’ they’d been inventive, funny, acute and that’d been enough; in Sgt. Pepper, they retained the same qualities but their new ambitions demanded something more. Ingenuity and quickness weren’t remotely enough, and the loss in power proved fatal. They went flat: after all, what does third-rate Art have on Superpop?”\n\n– Nik Cohn, Pop From the Beginning, 1969\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“…a Day-Glo tombstone for its time.”\n\n– Greil Marcus on Sgt. Pepper in the Stranded discography, 1979\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nThe Two Sides of Sgt. Pepper: An Honest Appraisal of The Beatles’ Classic – A nearly two-hour audio excursion into Sgt. Pepper, featuring (amongst others) Greg Kot, Ann Powers, Anthony DeCurtis, and Jim DeRogatis.\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“Rock musicians were creating new music, so writers had to create new criticism. Writing had to be an appropriate response to the music; in writing about, say, Sgt. Pepper, you had to try to write something as good as Sgt. Pepper. Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.”\n\n– Michael Lydon, review of Paul Williams’s Outlaw Blues, Rolling Stone, April 19, 1969\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nBillboard Top LPs of 1967\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“Usually, people point to [Goldstein’s] Sgt. Pepper review as the moment he got his scarlet T, for turkey. He panned the record, dig, at precisely the instant when everybody was getting rather off on it. In recent times, certain revisionists and cynics have not only forgiven him, but consider him to have been right–what a joke.”\n\n– Richard Meltzer, preface to “Redd Foxx Gets off the Pot” in A Whore Just Like the Rest, 2000\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n– Ellen Willis, “The Star, the Sound, and the Scene,” New Yorker, 1968\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“Goldstein was disappointed with Sgt. Pepper. After an initial moment of panic, I wasn’t. In fact, I was exalted by it, although a little of that has worn off. Which is just the point. Goldstein may have been wrong, but he wasn’t that wrong. Sgt. Pepper is not the world’s most perfect work of art. But that is what the Beatles’ fans have come to assume their idols must produce.”\n\n– Robert Christgau, Esquire, 1967\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“Any of these songs is more genuinely creative than anything currently to be heard on pop radio stations, but in relationship to what other groups have been doing lately Sergeant Pepper is chiefly significant as constructive criticism, a sort of pop music master class examining trends and correcting or tidying up inconsistencies and undisciplined work, here and there suggesting a line worth following… Sooner or later some group will take the next logical step and produce an LP which is a popsong-cycle, a Tin Pan Alley Dichterliebe. Whether or not the remains of Schumann or Heine turn in their graves at this description depends on the artistry of the compiler.”\n\n– William Mann, The Sunday Times, May 29, 1967\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nBillboard, July 29, 1967\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“That a song [‘A Day in the Life’] of such intellectual sophistication and artistic resourcefulness should arise out of the same tradition that only a dozen years ago was spawning ditties like ‘Rock Around the Clock’ seems almost unbelievable. But the very swiftness of the development indicates its real nature. Unlike other popular arts, rock has not been forced to spin its substance out of itself. Instead, it has acted like a magnet, drawing into its field a host of heterogeneous materials that has fallen quickly into patterns. No other cultural force in modern times has possessed its power of synthesis.”\n\n– Albert Goldman, “The Emergence of Rock,” New American Review, 1968\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n– Langdon Winner, 1968\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“If being a critic were the same as being a listener, I could enjoy Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Other than one song which I detest (‘Good Morning, Good Morning’), I find the album better than 80 percent of the music around today. But it is the other 20 percent–including the best of the Beatles’ past performances–which worries me as a critic.”\n\n– Richard Goldstein, “I Blew My Cool Through the New York Times,” 1967 (from Goldstein’s Greatest Hits)\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“So, if Sgt. Pepper passes, what am I grousing for? Well, it did work in itself, it was cool and clever and controlled. Only, it wasn’t much like pop. It wasn’t fast, flash, sexual, loud, vulgar, monstrous or violent. It made no myths.”\n\n– Nik Cohn, Pop From the Beginning, 1969\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\n“Almost immediately, Sgt. Pepper was certified as proof that the Beatles’ music — or at least this album — was Art. But what mattered was the conscious creation of event — the way in which the summing-up-the-spirit-of-the-times style of the music (which for the most part has not survived its time) was perfectly congruent with the organizing-the-spirit-of-the-times manner in which the album was released and received. Which is to say that Sgt. Pepper, as the most brilliantly orchestrated manipulation of a cultural audience in pop history, was nothing less than a small pop explosion in and of itself. The music was not great art; the event, in its intensification of the ability to respond, was.”\n\n– Greil Marcus, “The Beatles” chapter in The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, 1979\n\nPaul Williams’ book, Outlaw Blues, has an interview conducted with Doors producer Paul Rothchild, from March 1967, after the band’s first record release. It has to be the most unspoiled interview since nearly all of the infamous lizard king shenanigans have yet to occur.\n\nThe following year, in “I’m Not A Juvenile Delinquent: The Death of Frankie Lymon,” Bill Millar writes a lovely obituary for Frankie Lymon in Soul Music Monthly, March 1968, mentioning all family, including his three wives, yet not by name.\n\nIn Keith Altham’s piece in the March 1970 issue of, Fusion, he deems The Nice “perhaps one of the most controversial groups on the pop music scene today,” before going on to say how they are, “praised by many for relieving us from the excesses of guitar-oriented heavy rock they are condemned by others for relying too heavily on theatricality and riffs stolen from Bach.” Powdered wigs for Keith Emerson not included.\n\nThat same year, Amon Düül gets a review with ‘premature heat’ in Creem Magazine from Lester Bangs, who later rather characteristically, recanted somewhat. To wit: “Amon Düül is the monstrosity. I don’t know who at Prophesy ever dreamed that this album deserved the States, but that man is lost in space. This record, which was called Psychedelic Underground in its German edition, is thirty minutes of the kind of clattering ‘space jam’ that is likely to result anytime you get a bunch of amateur musicians together with huge amps and too much dope for them even to say something musical by accident.”\n\nThe next year, Lester makes a telling observation with his account of a New Year’s Eve party in his Phonograph Record piece. “I attended a great party thrown by someone I didn’t know and inadvertently fell into a protracted conversation with this nearsighted social worker about 20 or 25 who kept babbling about his Volkswagen until I finally had to say: “Wait a minute. Are you telling me that the owning of a Volkswagen is a social, or a political act?”\n\nAt Lou Reed’s 1973 Buffalo, NY show, Crawdaddy! reported, a fan(atic) rushed the stage and bit the punk godfather in the ass, screaming, “Leather!” as he rushed security to get to the pre-punk icon (Bangs’ whereabouts being unknown at the time, but he would publish a big fat story about Lou two years later). One wonders what the nibbler subsequently thought of Rob Halford.\n\nIn 1975 Mick Taylor split from the accounting firm of Jagger & Co. causing little girls everywhere to Jones for a blonde Stone. “No doubt we can find another 6 foot 3 inch blonde haired guitarist that can do his own make-up,” opined the brainier Glimmer Twin to reporters. Tell that to Ron Wood, you thick-lipped Beelzebuba.\n\nThe same year, Nick Kent is amid his four-part story, “Brian Wilson: Last Beach Movie,” for the NME. Highlights include Van Dyke Parks telling Wilson to “write a fuckin’ middle-eight,’ and Wilson crying at the Whiskey before later breaking into song on stage.\n\nWhile discussing his disinterest in Mick Ronson, David Bowie, tells Chris Charlesworth from Melody Maker in 1976, “Anyway, I’m not a great Dylan fan. I think he’s a prick, so I’m not that interested.”\n\nIn “Simple Minds,” from the March issue of ZigZag, Lindsay Hutton enthused that he’d “NEVER BEEN this goddam (sic) excited about a rock’n’roll band for ages,” going on to say that, “The monster media called NEW WAVE is almost finished and the climate is right for an upheaval to break the monotony of bandwagonning (sic again) ex-heavy metal losers and bozos that overindulge in calculated weirdness.” Hutton stated this, perhaps prematurely, in 1979.\n\nIn “Part-time Punks: The Buzzcocks,” a retrospective and interview by Paul Lester for The Guardian, March 2002, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley spoke about recording together again, and falling in love – the latter with another woman."
