One of the most unusual entertainments Off Off Broadway is “Salmon Show and Others,” Bob Carroll's one‐person show which opened earlier this season at the Performing Garage. Mr. Carroll garnered high praise from The Times's Mel Gussow, who called him “a born performer.. . .an original, his own species.” The show follows the life cycle of the salmon, played by Mr. Carroll, from the point of view of the salmon, who along the way has some observations humorous and otherwise on the state of modern society. It has now beer extended until Feb. 11. (See Theater)\n\nTwo years ago, singer Jo Sullivan, wife of the late Frank Loesser, emerged from retirement for an engagement at the Ballroom, where she delivered her own renditions of songs Mr. Loesser had written for some of his many Broadway musicals, among them “Guys and Dolls,” “The Most Happy Fella” and others. “Not only does Miss Sullivan speak of his work with warmth and enthusiasm that the composer himself might have hesitated to display, but she also presents it with compelling vivacity and sings it superbly,” The Times's John S. Wilson wrote of her performance Miss Sullivan is back at the Ballroom, ac companied by pianist Colin Romoff, in an engagement running through next Sunday. (See Music)\n\nYehudi Menuhin, the internationally renowned violin virtuoso,will give a duo recital with his sister, pianist Hephzibah Menuhin, on Saturday at Carnegie Hall.
