        "text": "Celebrities & Musicians with Tinnitus:\n\nNeil Young - (loud music) main reason for his \"acoustic\" music during early 90's\n\nBarbra Streisand - \"Streisand has ascribed her volatile temperament to the tinnitus from which she has suffered since she was seven.\" source: news.independent.co.uk\n\nPete Townshend - \"I have severe hearing damage. It's manifested itself as tinnitus, ringing in the ears at frequencies that I play guitar. It hurts, it's painful, and it's frustrating.\" Townshend is completely deaf in one ear from an explosion when Keith Moon blew up his drum set live on stage in the early 1960's and loud amps. He has tinnitus, resulting partly from the band's live gigs but mainly the deafening volume in which he and Entwistle used to listen to playbacks over the studio \"cans.\" There are reports saying that he is unable even to hear his phone ring. The Sun newspaper reported Townshend said his hearing got worse after the band's recent US tour. Quote from Pete: \"The recent return to touring and to me playing electric guitar - albeit more quietly than in the 1970s - led to further deterioration of my hearing,\" the 57-year-old said. \"My right ear, which encounters my own edgy guitar and the machine gun strokes of the drums, has suffered badly. Luckily for me, I still have my left ear, which seems to be less @#%$ up. When I've worked solo in the past five years I've not used drums. This has meant I could play more quietly I think. With The Who, there is of course no way to play the old songs without drums. I've no idea what I can do about this. I am unable to perform with in-ear monitors. In fact, they increase the often unbearable tinnitus I suffer after shows.\" source from Sky News\n\nJohn Entwhistle - According to Who scholar Andy Neill, Entwhistle was pretty deaf, and tended to rely on lip-reading. He didn't have tinnitus but still played bass at his usual \"everything on 11\" volume.\n\nWilliam Shatner - stage/prop explosion on set of StarTrek (during mid 1960's)\n\nLeonard Nimoy - stage/prop explosion on set of StarTrek (during mid 1960's)\n\nDavid Letterman - T in one ear, has had T a long time: Dave mentioned that he too had ringing in his ears, and has had it for a long time to William Shatner\n\nPaul Schaffer - \"He's got that?! I've got that!\" on Billy Bob Thornton's character with Tinnitus in 'BANDITS'\n\nBill Clinton? - (wears hearing aid) T probably?\n\nTony Randall\n\nEngelbert Humperdinck\n\nRosalynn Carter\n\nSteve Martin - musician (banjo player), actor, comedian. He acquired Tinnitus while filming a pistol-shooting scene in \"¡Three Amigos!\" in 1986. \"You just get used to it.\"\n\nLeslie Nealson - (actor in Police Academy movies)\n\nMark O. Hatfield\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau - Influential eighteenth century political philosopher. From \"Confessions\" (1780) \"...a great noise started up in my ears, a noise that was triple or rather quadruple, compounded of a low and muffled humming, a softer murmuring as though of running water, a piercing whistle...This internal noise was so loud that it robbed me of the keen ear I had previously enjoyed and made me, not completely deaf, but hard of hearing... in spite of the throbbing in my arteries and the humming in my ears, which since that time, some thirty years ago now, have never left me for a moment...The noise was irksome, but it caused me no suffering: it was not accompanied by any chronic affliction, apart from insomnia at night...\" P. 222, Oxford World's Classics paperback edition, Oxford University Press, 2000\n\nJean-Francois Champollion - (1790-1832) Champollion was a French Egyptologist and scholar who is acknowledged as the father of modern Egyptology. He is best known for deciphering the Egyptian Hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone. His deciphering of hieroglyphics laid the foundations for modern Egyptology and Egyptian archaeology. In the book \"The Keys to Egypt\", it describes how Champollion drove himself to complete an encyclopedia of his work. \"Depressed and feeling more and more unwell, Champollion now wrote to his brother about the damage done by the strain of work: 'My poor head hurts, my tinnitus, the humming and buzzing noises, has worsened and leaves me neither day nor night. I have frequent spasms and am incapable of occupying myself seriously for more than a quarter hour...' \"\n\nRichard Thomas\n\nBrian Wilson? T? - deaf in one ear from when his father hit him in the head with a board at an early age\n\nDave Pirner - (Soul Asylum) (loud music)\n\nBob Mould - (alternative music icon)\n\nNeve Campbell - loud dance clubs\n\nJeff Beck - band Yardbirds (loud music), From an interview with rock guitarist Jeff Beck: \"Yes, it's in my left ear. It's excruciating... I mean, it's the worst thing 'cause it's not... It never... It does go away - it's not true to say that it doesn't but, uhh... It doesn't... The doctors say it won't... It isn't actually going away - you've just gotta suppress... They try to come to terms with what it actually... Why some people fear it - that's the psychology behind it. They know it's there but why is it such a horrible sound? Well, you can say why is a guy scratching at a window with his nails such a horrible sound - I couldn't put up with that! This is worse!\"\n\nAs Jeff told MTV - June 1993, He was asked to do a special guest spot with Guns 'n' Roses but had to cancel out. Jeff was going to play \"Locomotive\" with the band, but during the rehearsals, he used Slash's amp rig which aggravated his tinnitus forcing him to drop out of the gig.\n\nDouglas J Noble - musician, guitar instructor, and music journalist out of Edinburgh, Scotland. From a Jeff Beck interview: \"I've got tinnitus in my left ear...I mean it's permanent! Like just now...\"\n\nMike Patton - T? lead singer for Faith No More; Wrote the Mr. Bungle's tune \"Slowly Growing Deaf\".\n\nBurt Reynolds\n\nSting - (loud music)\n\nLiberty Divito - (Billy Joel's drummer) (loud music)\n\nEric Clapton - (loud amplifiers)\n\nEric Johnson - has developed T (loud music/amps); source from Guitar Player Magazine interview: \"I'd run two Marshall stacks onstage and crank the monitors. I started using Fender Deluxe Reverb amps and 50-watt Marshalls around '97, after I started having some problems with tinnitus. It was my own doing -- being irresponsible and thinking I was invincible...Yes, though it has been better lately. Take care and wear plugs. Don't think it can't happen to you. When I had a speaker reconed at the been here for years reconing shop in Austin the owner said, \"I've reconed speakers for every guitarist in Austin for years and as far as I know there aren't any rock 'n roll lead guitarists here who don't have tinnitus to some degree or another. Many have it so bad they have trouble sleeping.\"\n\nJames Hetfield - Metallica rhythm guitar and uses Sonic II Ear plugs\n\nLars Ulrich - drummer for Metallica\n\nVanilla Fudge - Tim Bogert (bassist): \"Tinnitus, big time. That’s the price you pay for having a darn good time. Nothing’s free!\"\n\nRadiohead - lead singer\n\nMotorhead - Lemmy Kilminster (thrash-punk-metal pioneers): \"We just like it loud, you know?\"\n\nKevin Shields - guitarist/singer for My Bloody Valentine: \"I did the damage to my ears listening to mixes in headphones at very loud levels without giving my ears time to recover.\"\n\nBlinda Butcher - bassist/singer for My Bloody Valentine: \"I had a punctured ear drum which fortunately they were able to put right but for a while I couldn't hear out of one ear and it was very depressing. On stage we all wear hearing protection and encourage anyone who sees us regularly to do the same.\"\n\nGeorge Martin? - retired from music due to hearing loss\n\nGeorge Harrison? - had hearing damage from loud music\n\nThomas Edison\n\nGraham Cole - UK actor and singer, suffers tinnitus and hearing loss\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nTed Nugent - Amboy Dukes guitarist: \"My left ear is pretty much whacked. But I can still hear really good in my right ear. Early on, I would stick shell casings, which I always had handy, in my ear, to protect my right ear because that was the one that was facing the amp the most.\"\n\nRick Emmett - Triumph guitarist, source from Guitar Player Magazine\n\nBono - U2 lead singer, he even sings about it in his lyrics.
