He was a member of the Marx Brothers (with Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, and Zeppo Marx).

On screen, Chico is often in alliance with Harpo, usually as partners in crime, and is also frequently seen trying to con or outfox Groucho.

A prodigy by any measure, Bernstein's prowess extended beyond his roles as a conductor and pianist, establishing him as an esteemed composer, author, and lecturer as well. His musical genius shone brightly in the orchestral and theatrical worlds, with legendary compositions like West Side Story. Bernstein's journey toward becoming an eminent musician began at Boston Latin School, where he first discovered an affinity for music. His talent was further nurtured and honed when he attended Harvard University, studying music theory and composition. Upon graduation, his passion led him to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he studied conducting. Bernstein then joined the ranks of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra as an assistant conductor in 1943, ultimately becoming its music director in 1958. Over the span of an illustrious career, Bernstein composed music for opera, ballet, orchestral performances, choruses, piano, and even film scores. Works like Candide, On the Town, and Chichester Psalms exhibit the range of his compositional skills. Beyond his musical accomplishments, Bernstein was known for his charismatic persona and prodigious ability to educate and inspire others about music. His contributions to television series like Omnibus and Young People's Concerts are testaments to his enduring legacy as both a musician and educator. Despite his passing on October 14, 1990, Bernstein's influence continues to resonate in the world of music, serving as an inspiration for generations of musicians and music lovers alike.\n\nBirthplace : Poland\n\nLeonard Chess (March 12, 1917 – October 16, 1969) was an American record company executive and the co-founder of Chess Records.
