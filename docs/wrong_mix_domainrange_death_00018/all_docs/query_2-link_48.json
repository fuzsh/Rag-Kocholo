WASHINGTON ii—no 2 INDUSTRIAL February , 1916 PEACE IN AUSTRALIA THROUGH MINIMUM WAGE AND ARBITRATION.1 BY HENRY BOURNES HIGGINS, PRESIDENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN COURT OF CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION. The new province is that of the relations between employers and employees. Is it possible for a civilized community so to regulate these relations as to make the bounds of the industrial chaos nar­ rower, to add new territory to the domain of order and law? The war between the profit maker and the wage earner is always with us, and, although not so dramatic or catastrophic as the present war in Europe, it probably produces in the long run as much loss and suf­ fering, not only to the actual combatants, but also to the public. Is there no remedy ? During a brief sojourn in the United States in the summer of 1914 I had the good fortune to meet many men and women of broad and generous outlook and of admirable public spirit. They were anxious to learn what I, as president of the Australian court of conciliation and arbitration, could tell them of Australian methods of dealing with labor questions. I propose now, on the invitation of the editor of this Review, to state briefly the present position, confining my survey to my own personal experience. The Australian Federal constitution of 1900 gave to the Federal Parliament power to make laws with respect to “ conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.’12 Following the ex­ ample of the United States Constitution, the constitution left all residuary powers of legislation to the States, and the theory generally 1 Reprint of an article entitled “ A new province for law and order, industrial peace through minimum wage and arbitration,” in Harvard Law Review, November, 1915.

But an exception was made, after several discussions, in favor of labor disputes which pass beyond State boundaries and can not be effectually dealt with by the laws of any one or more States. Just as bush fires run through the artificial State lines, just as the rabbits ignore them in pursuit of food, so do, frequently, industrial disputes. In pursuance of this power an act was passed December 15, 1904, constituting a court for conciliation, and where conciliation is found impracticable, arbitration. The arbitration is compulsory in the sense that an award, if made, binds the parties. The act makes a strike or a lockout an offense if the dispute is within the ambit of the act—if the dispute is one that extends beyond the limits of one State. In other words, the process of conciliation, with arbitration in the background, is substituted for the rude and barbarous processes of strike and lockout. Reason is to displace force; the might of the State is to enforce peace between industrial combatants as well as between other combatants, and all in the interest of the public. Under the act the court consists of a president, who must be one of the justices of the high court of Australia. The high court is modeled on the Supreme Court of the United States, having often to decide whether acts are constitutional, but it is also a court of appeal from the supreme courts of the States. The first president of the court of conciliation was appointed February 10, 1905, and on his resignation in September, 1907, I was appointed as his successor. The first task that I had to face was not, strictly speaking, con­ ciliation or arbitration. The Federal Parliament imposed certain excise duties on agricultural implements manufactured, but it pro­ vided for the remission of the duties in the case of goods manufac­ tured under conditions, as to the remuneration of labor, which the president of the court should certify to be “ fan and reasonable.”1 The act gave no guidance as to the model or criterion by which fairness and reasonableness were to be determined. In dealing with the first employer who applied to me for a certificate, I came to the conclusion that the act was designed for the benefit of employees and that it was meant to secure for them something which they could not get by individual bargaming with their employers. If A let B have the use of his horse on the terms that B give the horse fair and reason­ able treatment, B would have to give the horse jiroper food and water, shelter, and rest. I decided, therefore, to adopt a standard based on “ the normal needs of the average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilized community.” This was to be the primary https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis i Excise tariff, 1906. [90] MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 3 test in ascertaining the minimum wage that would be treated as “ fair and reasonable” in the case of unskilled laborers. At my sug­ gestion many household budgets were stated in evidence, principally by housekeeping women of the laboring class, and, after selecting such of the budgets as were suitable for working out an average, I found that in Melbourne, the city concerned, the average necessary expenditure in 1907 on rent, food, and fuel in a laborer’s household of about five persons was £1 12s. 5d. (about $7.80, taking a dollar as equivalent to 4s. 2d.); but that, as these figures did not cover light, clothes, boots, furniture, utensils, rates, life insurance, savings, accident or benefit societies, loss of employment, union pay, books and newspapers, tram or train fares, sewing machine, mangle, school requisites, amusements and holidays, liquors, tobacco, sickness or death, religion or charity, I could not certify that any wages less than 42s. ($10.22) per week for an unskilled laborer would be fair and reasonable. Then, in finding the wages which should be treated as fair and reasonable in the cases of the skilled employees, I relied mainly on the existing ratios found in the practice of employers. If, for instance, the sheet-iron worker got 8s. ($1.95) per day when the laborer got 6s., the sheet-iron worker should get, at the least, 9s. ($2.19) when the laborer’s minimum was raised to 7s. ($1.70). In the case referred to, the employer did not raise before me the point that the act was invalid, but, having failed in his application for a certificate, he refused to pay the excise duty, and defended an action to recover the duty before the high court on the ground that the act was invalid; and he succeeded, by a majority of three jus­ tices to two, on the ground that the act was not really a taxation act at all, but an act to regulate labor conditions, and as such beyond the competence of the Federal Parliament.1 But the principles adopted in the case for ascertaining a “ fair and reasonable” mini­ mum wage have survived and are substantially accepted, I believe universally, in the industrial life of Australia. In the first true arbitration case—that relating to ship’s cooks, bakers, etc.—the standard of 7s. ($1.70) per day was attacked by em­ ployers, but I do not think that it has been attacked since, probably because the cost of living has been rising. The court announced that it would ascertain first the necessary living wage for the unskilled laborer, and then the secondary wage due to skill or other excep­ tional qualifications necessary. Treating marriage as the usual fate of adult men, a wage which does not allow of the matrimonial con­ dition and the maintenance of about five persons in a home would not be treated as a living wage. As for the secondary wage, it seemed to be the safest course, for an arbitrator not initiated into the mysteries 1 King v. Barger, Commonwealth v. McKay, 6 Com. Law Rep., 41 (1908L https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [91] 4 MONTHLY REVIEW OP THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. of the several crafts, to follow the distinctions in grade between em­ ployees as expressed in wages for many years. The distinction between the basic or primary or living wage and the secondary wage attributable to exceptional qualifications neces­ sary for the performance of the function is not fanciful; it was forced on the court by the problems presented and by the facts of industrial life. Yet it has to be borne in mind that though the essential natural needs come first, the conventional needs (e. g., of artisans as distin­ guished from laborers) become, by usage, almost equally imperative.1 The following propositions may, I think, be taken to be estab­ lished in the settlement of minimum wages by the court; and it is surprising to find how often, as the principles of the court’s action come to be understood and appreciated, they guide parties disputing to friendly collective agreements, without any award made by the court. 1. One can not conceive of industrial peace unless the employee has secured to him wages sufficient for the essentials of human existence.2 2. This, the basic wage, must secure to the employee enough where­ with to renew his strength and to maintain his home from day to day.3 3. The basic wage is the same for the employee with no family as for the employee with a large family. I t rests on Walt Whitman’s “ divine average,” and the employer need not concern himself with his employee’s domestic affairs. 4. The secondary wage is remuneration for any exceptional gifts or quafffications,4 not of the individual employee, but gifts or qualifi­ cations necessary for the performance of the functions, e. g., skill as a tradesman, exceptional heart and physique, as in the case of a gas stoker,5 exceptional muscular training and power, as in the case of a shearer,6 exceptional responsibility, e. g., for human life, as in the case of winding or locomotive engine drivers.7 5. The secondary wage, as far as possible, preserves the old margin between the unskilled laborer and the employee of the skilled or ex­ ceptional class.8 6. After ascertaining the proper wages, basic and secondary, the court considers any evidence adduced to show that the employers ought not to be asked to pay such wages.9 I t will consider grounds of finance, of competition with imports, of unfairness to other workers, of undue increase in prices of the product, of injury to the public, etc. 1 Engine drivers, 7 Com.

The wages can not be allowed to depend on the profits made by the individual employer, but the profits of which the industry is capable may be taken into account. If the industry is novel, and those who undertake it have to proceed economically, there may be a good cause for keeping down wages, but not below the basic wage, which must be sacrosanct. Above the basic wage, bargaining of the skilled employee may, with caution, be allowed to operate.1 8. The fact that a mine is becoming exhausted or poorer in its ores is not a ground for prescribing a lower rate than would otherwise be proper. If shareholders are willing to stake their own money on a speculation, they should not take part of the employee’s proper wages also. The court can not endanger industrial peace in order to keep unprofitable mines going.2 9. The court does not increase the minimum on the ground of affluence of the employer. It is not affected by the fact that one of the employers can, by skillful management, by enterprise, or by good fortune, make very large profits.3 10. The minimum rate must be based on the highest function that the employee may be called on to exercise. The employer must not give a plumber laborer’s work and pay him laborer’s wages if he has also to do plumbing.4 11. In finding the proper minimum rate the court tries to find what would be proper for an employee of average capacity called upon to do work of the class required. If the employer desires to secure the services of an exceptional workman, he is free to do so. The payment of higher rates is left to the play of bargaining.5 12. The court does not attempt to discriminate in wages on the ground of comparative laboriousness. Discrimination on such a ground is neither safe nor sound. The court declines to give an extra rate to hod men if they carry beyond a certain height.6 13. The court will not discriminate in wages as between the sev­ eral States so as to interfere with the freedom of trade between the States provided by the constitution.7 14. The court will not keep down wages on steamers so as to enable them to beat State railways in competition or to help one competitor against another.8 1 Broken Hill Mine, 3 Com.

The court accepts and follows the usual practice of making rates for casual employment higher than the corresponding rates for continuous employment.1 16. The court, in obedience to the act, provides exceptions to the minimum rate in the case of aged, slow, or infirm workers, but the exceptional cases must be disclosed to the representative of the union and be well safeguarded.2 17. But the court will not provide exceptions to the minimum rate for “ improvers,” men paid more than boys and less than jour­ neymen, men who are used to beat down the claims of competent journeymen, and are thus a perpetual menace to the peace of the community.3 18. The court regards the old system of apprenticeship as un­ suitable for factories under modern conditions, and it objects to fixing a rigid proportion of apprentices to journeymen without regard to the circumstances, e. g., the character of the output of each factory. But if conditions of apprenticeship are in dispute, the court will, especially if both sides wish it, and for the sake of peace as well as efficiency, make regulations on the subject. The proper method, however, seems to be, in boot factories, to coordi­ nate the work of the factories with the work of the technical schools.4 19. The court will not prescribe extra wages to compensate for unnecessary risks to the life or health of the employee or unnecessary dirt. No employer is entitled to purchase by wages the right to endanger life or to treat men as pigs.5 20. The court gives weight to existing conventions, usages, preju­ dices, exceptional obligations and expenses of the employees; for instance, that masters and officers are required to keep up a certain appearance, and that stewards must provide themselves with uniform and laundry.6 21. Where it is established that there is a marked difference in the cost of living between one locality and another, the difference will, so far as possible, be reflected in the minimum wage.7 22. But where, as in the case of the wharf laborers at ports, all the employees and nearly all the employers desired that there should be no differentiation, the court bases the minimum wage on the mean Australian cost of living.8 1Builders’ laborers, 7 Com.

In cases such as that of ship’s stewards, where the employees usually receive from passengers “ tips” (or “ bunce”), the average amount of the tips must be taken into account in finding whether the employee receives a living wage. But the minimum wage will be raised to its proper level if the practice of tipping can be stopped.1 24. In cases where employees are “ kept,” found in food and shelter by the employer, the value of the “ keep” is allowed in re­ duction of the wages awarded. At the time when the keep of single men, such as laborers, cost in lodgings, usually 15s. ($3.65) per week, the court reduced the wages by 10s. ($2.43) only. For the 15s. ($3.65) at the family home would go further than it would go for hoard and lodging outside of the home; and the employer who feeds large numbers of men can buy the necessary commodities in large quanti­ ties and on advantageous terms. The 10s. ($2.43) per week seemed to represent fairly the amount of expenditure of which the home was relieved by the absence of the man.2 25. The principle of the living wage has been applied to women, but with a difference, as women are not usually legally responsible for the maintenance of a family. A woman’s minimum is based on the average cost of her own living to one who supports herself by her own exertions. A woman or girl with a comfortable home can not be left to underbid in wages other women or girls who are less fortunate.3 26. But in an occupation in which men as well as women are em­ ployed the minimum is based on a man’s cost of living. If the occu­ pation is that of a blacksmith, the minimum is a man’s minimum. If the occupation is that of a milliner, the minimum is a woman’s mini­ mum; if the occupation is that of fruit picking, as both men and women are employed, the minimum must be a man’s minimum.4 27. As regards hours of work, when disputed, the court usually adheres to the general Australian standard of 48 hours; generally 8f hours on five days, 41 hours on Saturday. But in exceptional cases the court has reduced the hours—in one case because of the nerveracking character of the occupation;5 in another case, that of builders’ laborers—because the men have to “ follow their job,” spending much of their own time in traveling.6 28. The court has conceded the eight-hour day at sea as well as in port, to deckhands on ships;7 to officers on ships,8to marine engineers.9 1 Ship’s stewards, 4 Com.

But there are sundry necessary exceptions, and the master retains the absolute right to call on any man in emergencies involving the safety of the ship; and for other purposes he may call on any man, paying extra rates for the overtime. The hours of navigating officers were sometimes shocking and involved danger to ship, cargo, and passengers.1 29. In certain exceptional cases the court has granted a right to leave of absence for two or three weeks on full pay to employees after a certain length of continuous service; not, of course, to casual or temporary employees.2 30. The court refuses to dictate to employers what work they should carry on, or how, or what functionaries they should employ, or what functions for each employee, or what tests should be applied to can­ didates for employment.3 31. The court leaves every employer free to carry on the business on his own system, so long as he does not perpetuate industrial trouble or endanger industrial peace; free to choose his employees on their merits and according to his exigencies; free to make use of new ma­ chines, of improved methods, of financial advantages, of advantages of locality, of superior knowledge; free to put the utmost pressure on anything and everything except human life.4 32. As regards complaints of disagreeable or onerous conditions, the court treats as fundamental the consideration that the work of the ship, factory, mine, etc., must be done, a consideration next in order to that of the essential needs of human life. An order will not be made that is inconsistent with the effective management of the undertaking.5 33. On the same principle the court steadily refuses to make orders which would militate against the public interest or conven­ ience. It has refused to order prohibitive overtime rates for leaving port on Sundays;6 it has refused to forbid the employment of casuals or to forbid “ broken time” in tramway services. Casuals or “ broken time,” or both, are necessary to meet the extra traffic at certain times of the day.7 These are some of the principles of action adopted by the court. But, it may be asked, what about piecework ? How does the court fix piecework rates? The first great case in which piecework rates were directly involved was that of the shearers.8 At the time of 1 Ship’s officers, 6 Com. Arb., 6, 16, 17 (1912). 2 Ibid., 15, 25; 7 Com.

In that case the court prescribed the piecework rates on a time-work basis—found the piecework rates which would enable an average shearer to earn such wages per week as would be the just minimum for a man with the qualifications of a shearer if he were paid by time. Having found that the shearer should, as a “ skilled” worker get a net wage of £3 ($14.60) per week for the time of his expedition to the sheep stations to shear, and having found that a rate of $5.84 per 100 sheep would give this net result, the court fixed $5.84 per 100 as the minimum rate.1 In finding the net returns of the whole expedition, allowances had to be made for days of traveling and waitmg, expenses en route, cost of mess and combs and cutters.2 This system of finding the net result of the expedition, and what would be a fair return for the expedition, was also adopted in the case of persons employed by fruit growers on the River Murray.3 Sometimes the court protects pieceworkers in mak­ ing their bargain by prescribing that their remuneration shall not fall below, in result, a certain time-work minimum.4 The system of arbitration adopted by the act is based on unionism. Indeed, without unions it is hard to conceive how arbitration could be worked. It is true that there are methods provided by which the court can intervene for the preservation of industrial peace even when its powers are not invoked by any union; but no party can file a plaint for the settlement of a dispute except an “ organization,” that is to say, a union of employers or of employees registered under the act.5 One of the “ chief objects” of the act, as stated in section 2, is “ to facilitate and encourage the organization of representative bodies of employers and of employees and the submission of industrial disputes to the court by organizations;” and it follows that the court will not assist an employer in devices to stamp out unionism.6 It is, of course, better for an employer that he should not be worried by complaints of individual employees and that any complaints should be presented collectively by some responsible union. He has then the advantage of being able to deal with his employees on a con­ sistent scheme, equitable all round the service, and his' time is not taken up by petty complaints or individual fads. A demand made on him comes from a responsible executive, with the consent, direct or indirect, of the organized body of members of the union. Moreover from the point of view of the employees, it is better that an individual employee should not, by complaining, incur the risk of becoming a 1 5 Com.

From the point of view of the court and of the public, it is fair to state that in nearly every case—I can only remem­ ber one case to the contrary—the influence of union leaders has always been in the direction of peace. It would not be so probably if there were no means of obtaining an improvement of conditions except by strike, actual or threatened, but in Australia the leaders can hold out to the members of the union a prospect of relief, without strike, from the court or from some wages board.1 It is significant that, in the one exceptional case referred to, the leaders of the union have been converted so that they are now strong advocates of arbitration. But then comes the difficult question of “ preference to union­ ists. ” Preference to unionists is the Australian analogue of the “ preferential union shop/’ made familiar in some of the garment industries of the United States. The act gives the court power to direct that, as between members of organizations (unions) of em­ ployees and other persons desiring employment at the same time, preference shall be given to such members, other things being equal.2 But it is only a power, not a duty, to order such preference, and the court is very loath to exercise the power. “ The absolute power of choice (between applicants for employment) is one of the recom­ mendations of the minimum-wage system from the employer’s point of view—he can select the best men available when he has to pay a certain rate.” 3 For this reason preference was refused in the case of shearers, etc.,4 in the case of seamen,5 in the case of builders’ laborers.6 Yet the court recognizes the difficulty of the position. As was said in the builders’ laborers case: The truth is, preference is sought for unionists in order to prevent preference of nonunionists or antiunionists—to prevent the gradual bleeding of unionism by the feeding of nonunionism. It is a weapon of defense. For instance, some employers here hired men through the Independent Workers’ Federation—a body supported chiefly by employers’ money and devised to frustrate the ordinary unions—and those who applied for work at the office of this body would not be introduced to the employer unless they ceased to be members of the ordinary unions and became mem­ bers of this body. What is to be done to protect men in the exercise of their right as free men to combine for their mutual benefit, seeing that the employing class has the tremendous power of giving or withholding work? The only remedy that the act provides is an order for preference, and it is doubtful whether such an order is appro­ priate or effective. It is, indeed, very trying for men who pay full dues to a legiti­ mate union to work side by side with men who do not—with men who look to their own interests only, seeking to curry favor with the employers, getting the benefit of any general rise in wages or betterment of conditions which is secured without their 1Marine engineers, 6 Com.

Every fair man recognizes the difficulty of the position—-every man who is not too much of a partisan to look sometimes at the other side of the hedge. In another case recently before me, a nonunionist told me that he acted solely on the basis of his personal interest, without any regard for the inter­ ests of his fellow workers. He looked for favors to himself, because he kept away from those who combined for the common good of the whole body. It is not out of consideration for such men that I refuse preference; it is rather out of consideration for such employers as honestly take the best man available, unionist or not. I do not want them to be harassed with the doubt, when selecting men for a post, whether they can prove their appointee to be better than all the unionist applicants. I refuse preference, also, out of consideration for many who have not joined any union simply because they have not felt the need. In the case of country building work, for instance, it is common for men on farms, etc., when farm work is not pressing, to take a job as builders’ laborer. Why should the employer be compelled to bring union laborers from the city? After all, the direct way for unionists to counteract unfair preference of nonunionists is for the unionists to excel—to give to the employer the best service. It is nearly always found that employers prefer a first-class man who is a unionist to a second-class man who is a nonunionist.1 The only case in which the court has ordered preference is the case of a tramway company which deliberately discriminated against unionists and refused to undertake not to discriminate in future.2 It is to be observed that the court is not given power by the act to order that the employer shall not discriminate against unionists in giving or withholding employment. The imposition of a minimum wage, a wage below which an em­ ployer must not go in employing a worker of a given character, implies, of course, an admission of the truth of the doctrine of modern economists, of all schools I think, that freedom of contract is a misnomer as applied to the contract between an employer and an ordinary individual employee. The strategic position of the em­ ployer in a contest as to wages is much stronger than that of the individual employee. “ The power of the employer to withhold bread is a much more effective weapon than the power of the em­ ployee to refuse to labor.” 3 Low wages are bad in the worker’s eyes, but unemployment, with starvation in the background, is worse. The position was put luminously once, as well as with un­ conscious humor,v by an employer on whom a plaint was served for settlement of a dispute by the court. In place of filing an answer he wrote a letter to the registrar, denying that he was a party to any dispute. “ I have never,” said he, “ quarreled or disputed with a laborer of any kind. * * * If we can not agree, well, we will part; that ends the whole. * * * Love is the power which will end all struggles, not legislation.” Other respondents pin their faith, not to “ love,” but to the sterner “ law of supply and demand.” https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 1 7 Com.

They treat this law as being, in the matter of wages, more inex­ orable and inevitable than even the law of gravitation, as not being subject, as laws of nature are, to counteraction, to control, to direc­ tion. “ One may dam up a river, or even change its course, but one can not (it is said) raise wages above the level of its unregulated price, above the level of a sum which a man will accept rather than be starved.” 1 If the court did nothing else than drag such theories into the light of day and into free discussion it would be doing good service to the community. But it is coming to be recognized that what the court does in fixing a minimum wage is by no means novel in principle. There are many acts of many legislatures which pre­ scribe minimum conditions on other subjects. For example, mining acts often prescribe minimum conditions as to ventilation, timbering, safety appliances, machinery, sanitation. These matters are not left to individual bargaining. There are no definite figures with regard to the cost to the parties of arbitration proceedings, but the cost is very slight. There are seldom any costs incurred in employing lawyers, for, under section 27 of the act, lawyers can not be employed except with the consent of both parties, and the employees generally refuse their consent. The secretary of the organization generally puts its case, and the employees or some permanent officer generally put the employers’ case. The principal expense of an arbitration is that of bringing witnesses. If prohibition proceedings are taken in the high court to prevent the enforcement of an award on the ground that the court of conciliation has exceeded its jurisdiction (of which I shall say more presently), no doubt heavy, very heavy, expenses are incurred, but these are not expenses of the arbitration. But it has to be admitted that proceedings in the court of con­ ciliation often take a very long time, sometimes weeks; in a few cases, months. The proceedings can not be otherwise than lengthy, as the disputes of which the court can take cognizance are so widespread— must extend from one State into one or more other States. More­ over, the habit is to bring before the employers, and afterwards before the court, a very long list of conditions in dispute, and the case of each employer has to be fairly considered by the court in connec­ tion with each grievance. The number of employers’ respondents to a plaint is generally great. There were 311 employers in the engine drivers’ case,2 570 in the case of the builders’ laborers,3 650 in that of the fruit growers,4 and 2,549, at least, in that of the shearers.5 1 Engine drivers, 5 Com.

The act pur­ ported to give this power to the court, but it was held by the high court, on a case stated, that the act was in this respect unconstitu­ tional and invalid.1 This want of power to make a common rule for the industry not only lengthens the proceedings, but it also may operate to the prejudice of the employers who are bound by the award. For the court can deal only with employers who employ members of the union. Some rival employers may have no members •of the union in their employment and therefore have to be excluded from the award. Their hands are free as to wages, while the hands of the others are fettered, and this is, of course, unfair as between competitors in the trade. In one case, that of the boot factories,2 the difficulty was met by the employers and employees concurring in an application before the wages hoards of each of the States con­ cerned to have the terms of the award made a common rule for the State. But this remedy is not always available. There is a provision in the a c t3 enabling the court to appoint a board of reference, assigning to it the function of determining specified matters which under the award may require to be determined. Such a provision, if properly drafted and valid, would be of eminent service to peace. Difficulties often arise under an award, owing to the vast variety of methods in the different undertakings, as to the application of the words of the award to some particular case. These and other difficulties ought to be met by collective adjustment, between repre­ sentatives of the employers on the one side and the representatives of the union on the other, with a neutral chairman; but from the nature of the case there would have to be a separate board in each of of the centers of the industry. Nothing would tend more to prevent serious friction and to promote mutual understanding of employers and employees. “ A suitable board of reference, under the asgis of a strong union, is a safety valve for any industry.” 4 But, unfortu­ nately, as the section stands, with the interpretation put upon it by the high court, it is practically useless. The parties on both sides of a dispute often seek a board, or rather boards, of reference,5 but the court can not generally help them. Sometimes, however, the parties to the dispute make and file agreements between the union and the several employers for a board and leave the court to award on the other subjects in dispute, and the. agreements are certified by the 1 Boot factories, 11 Com.

Arbitration by the court is meant to be a substitute for the method of strike, and “ you can not have award and strike too.” 6 In one case, while the court was preparing an award for seamen and firemen, information came th a t the firemen of the steam­ ship Koombana refused to work on the ship unless a certain chief steward were removed. The position was serious; the ship carried the mails, as well as passengers and cargo, for ports on the west Australian coast. There was an agreement in existence under which it was a breach of agreement on the part of the union if by reason of any dispute a vessel were detained 24 hours. The court intimated that it would not make its award so long as the agreement was not observed. As a result, officials of the union conducted suitable firemen to the port where the vessel lay, put them on board, and the Koombana went on its way; then, and not till then, the court gave its award.7 The power to vary an award has also been held over the head of a recalcitrant union. It is not fair to keep the employers bound by the award if the union takes the benefit of the award and rejects the burden. The court has power to lower or annul the minimum wage in such a case if necessary.2 Fortunately it never has been necessary. I may give one case in point. The wharf laborers were on strike in Brisbane; seamen who were enjoying the benefit of an award were ordered to unload their vessel. They were naturally in­ disposed to comply, but, before refusing, they telegraphed to the executive of their union for directions. They were told by the ex­ ecutive to unload or they would lose the award. They unloaded. Another very valuable power is that conferred by Parliament in 1910, under which the president may, when a dispute exists or is 1 Engine drivers, 7 Com. Arb., 132,135 (1913). 2 F ruit growers, 6 Com.

The attendance is compulsory, enforcible by penalty.1 Fre­ quently a quiet talk at such a conference has prevented a strike which was imminent.2 Frequently the parties arrange to proceed for arbitration and make temporary arrangements for carrying on work until the award.3 Sometimes an actual strike confined to one State though the dispute extended to two States, has been stopped, the men going back to work at the old rates until the award.4 A further amendment was made in the act in 1911, under which, if no agreement has been reached at the conference, the president can refer the dispute into the court for arbitration.5 The fact that this whip is in the hands of the president, to be used in the last resort, and that the party with the stronger position for the time being will have to submit to an award if he takes up an obstinate attitude against all agreement, is found to operate as a strong inducement to compro­ mise and to reasonable arrangements by consent. Agreements in lieu of award have often been fixed up in a conference or as the result of a conference.6 The agreements are generally produced in court when the case is called on, and the president certifies to them, and has them filed, and they operate, are enforceable, as an award.7 In one long case, where the court was faced with a dispute in 10 tram­ way undertakings, no less than 8 of the undertakings arranged agree­ ments during the course of the long hearing, with the assistance of the president given in frequent interviews with the parties in chambers.8 It must not be supposed that the desire for the assistance of the president or of the court is confined to employees. At first there was a tendency on the part of employers, individually, and in association, to resent interference, as preventing the employers from carrying on, as they said, their own business in their own way. But facts have been too strong for them. Employers now frequently request the president to intervene and to summon a conference in order to prevent a stoppage of work.9 They seek regulation, by agreement or award, in order that they may not find their plant lying idle and their business at a standstill and in some cases a season lost. 1 Sec. 16a. 2 Seamen, 4 Com.

Perhaps it will be well to give a concrete case. There is in Victoria a great butchering trade in lambs for export, involving, I believe, more than a million pounds per annum. The lambs are sent down to Melbourne in the spring, September or October, and unless they are butchered at once they deteriorate in condition and the season is lost. The men suddenly refused to go to work at the old rates; telegrams flew up to the country settlements to stop trucking any more lambs; the settlers were faced with the prospect of losing their market, and the storekeeping and incidental industries with the prospect of grievous loss. It so happened that the same demand was made on employers in New South Wales, so that there seemed to be a two-State dispute which gave jurisdiction to the president. A conference was summoned at the request of the employers, the men induced to go to work under the conditions already in operation on a promise that the court would arbitrate and make the award retrospective to the resumption of work, and the season was saved.1 The parties prepared themselves peacefully to discuss their differences before the court, but—this is the point—the work went on. Another concrete case, showing the desire of both sides for definite regulation of conditions by the court, is that of the ship’s officers. The men, in their demands, had been too specific; the high court had decided that the dispute must be treated as confined to the specific demands made, and that the court of conciliation could not prescribe a remedy for any grievance different from that remedy demanded. The court of conciliation found that the granting of the demands, as asked, would tend to promote strife rather than peace in the industry, and stated its difficulties to the parties. Both parties were so anxious for a definite arrangement of conditions that they consented to embody in an agreement any terms whatever that the president thought proper, whatever the ambit of the dis­ pute, whatever the jurisdiction of the court. The president accord­ ingly continued the hearing of the case and drew up an agreement which both parties signed and which they have both loyally observed.2 There is such a strong desire for the assistance of the machinery of the act that on several occasions an attempt has been made by employers, with or without the concurrence of employees, to induce the president to intervene in cases in which he has had to refuse his assistance, on the ground that the dispute does not extend beyond one State and must be dealt with, if at all, by State author­ ities.3 Quite recently the president has had, however, to make an exception to his rule not to meddle, even by consent, with matters outside his jurisdiction. There was a dispute between laborers and 1 Export butchers, 7 Com. Arb., 52, 54 (1913). 2 Ship’s officers, 4 Com. Arb., 89, 91 (1910); Hairdressers, 6 Com.

In view of the serious effects of a stoppage of the works in time of war, the president consented to act, heard the parties, and gave an award, and the parties are peacefully acting in accordance with it.1 But the course of the court, like the course of true love, does not always run smooth. It has to meet some bitter opposition. Some­ times the opposition comes from a union of employees—generally, a union which avowedly accepts the doctrine of the “ class war,” and aims at “ the emancipation of labor by the abolition of the wage system.” 2 I have even seen a cartoon, in a labor newspaper, showing a laborer walking toward a gate marked “ Freedom,” and a bull dog with a collar marked “ Arbitration” bars his path. I t is but fair to say that this cartoon appeared in a State which has a local arbitration court. But the attacks on the court and its awards are, of course, generally made from the side of employers, many of whom naturally resent any curtailment of their powers. The appli­ cations for prohibition against the president have been sometimes in part or temporarily successful. Prohibition is applied for because of some alleged excess of the court’s jurisdiction, and the argument generally turns on the questions, Was there a dispute, and if there was, did it extend beyond one State? Sometimes the argument turns on the validity of some section of the act. The proceedings are very long and very costly, and it is astonishing what a wealth of learning is involved in the meaning of the word “ dispute” and the words “ extending beyond the limit of any one State.” The dis­ cussions occupy a very considerable proportion of the Commonwealth Law Reports, but they would not interest those for whose informa­ tion I write this article. The legal discussions do not affect the principles or methods of action of the court of conciliation in cases where there is jurisdiction. It has to be admitted that the awards in nearly all cases have been made in a period when the cost of living is rising and that therefore they have generally increased the existing minimum rate. The court found, about 1911, that the cost of living was substan­ tially increasing, but it refused to raise the basic wage until the increase could be quantitatively stated.3 It suggested the expedi­ ency of official statistics on the subject, and the Commonwealth statistician now furnishes periodically statistics which have mate- https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 1 Naval base—not reported 2 F ruit growers, 6 Com.

According to the Commonwealth statis­ tician, the cost of living, taking Australia as a whole, has increased by 25 per cent from 1901 to 1913. For such necessaries as could be bought in 1901 for $4.87 one must now pay S6.08.1 What will happen if the cost of living should decrease—if the minimum for the basic or living wage shall have to be lowered ? It is a fair question, but it is for the future to give the answer. I wish to confine my words to my personal experience. Yet there have been cases in which the court has refused increases or has actually decreased the minimum rates, and the employees have listened to the reasons and loyally submitted. In the case of the. shearers,2 the rates for shearing, $5.84 per 100, as fixed by my predecessor, were not increased; and the strongest union in Australia, the Australian Workers’ Union, acquiesced. In the same case the court found that too high mini­ mum rates had previously been fixed for wool pressers and lowered them, stating its reasons. There was no strike, no refusal to work, no expression, that I know, of discontent. In the case of the builders’ laborers,3 the court fixed lower rates for Ballarat and Bendigo than for Melbourne and lower rates for Melbourne than for Sydney, all because of differences in the cost of living. The union leaders were troubled because these cities had always maintained the same “ union rate” ; but they told the members of the union the court’s reason, and there was peace. Again, in the same case, the court fixed for Melbourne a lower minimum rate for scaffolders and demolishers than had been previously fixed by the wages board, 31 cents per hour instead of 33 cents per hour, and the men submitted. The truth is, I think, that if the men secure the essentials of food, shelter, clothing, etc., , they are not so unreasonable as is sometimes supposed. They do not love strikes for the sake of strikes; and the great majority are generally quite willing to submit to reason if they feel that they are reasonably treated. This article is confined, as I stated at the beginning, to the Federal court of conciliation and to my own actual experience in connection therewith. But American readers should know that in each of the six Australian States there is some wages board system under the State law or some industrial or arbitration court. Victoria was the first State to adopt a system of wages boards, about 1896; and her example has been more or less followed in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. Western Australia has an arbitration court, and New South Wales has a combination of the two systems, wages board and an industrial court. There is no organic connection between the State systems and the Federal system. The object of the wages boards is primarily to prevent sweating or underpayment; the 1 Postal electricians, 7 Com. Arb., 5, 12 (1913). 2 Shearers, 5 Com. Arb., 48 (1911). https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 3 Builders’ laborers, 7 Com. Arb., 210 (1913). [ 106] MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 19 object of the Federal court is to preserve or restore industrial peace. The Federal court deals with disputes, as such, and prescribes wages, etc., merely as incidental to the prevention or settlement of disputes; the wages board prescribes minimum wages and has no direct relation to disputes. But, as is obvious from the nature of the case, the sys­ tems often overlap. A wages board consists, generally, of repre­ sentatives selected by employers and of representatives selected by employees in equal numbers, with a neutral chairman. There is not, I think, any fixed principle stated by the legislatures for the guidance of the boards in prescribing the minimum wage. At one time, the Victorian legislature enacted that the minimum wage should not exceed the wage paid by “ reputable employers;” but this negative provision has been found unsuitable, and repealed. The wages boards can not deal with all industrial conditions; the Federal court can deal with any industrial condition that comes into dispute. The wages boards do not publish the reasons for their determinations; the Federal court does. As a result I find that the wages boards frequently look for guidance in their action to the reasoning of the Federal court. The wages boards, within the limits of area assigned to them, bind all employers by their determinations; the Federal court can only bind those who are concerned in the dispute. The wages boards, being State creations, are very much affected by the consideration of interstate competition.1 In dealing with boot fac­ tories, the New South Wales tribunal would have fixed the minimum for journeymen at $2.19 per day, but for the fact that the rival factories of Victoria had a minimum of $1.95 per day. The Federal court, when asked to intervene, was able, as an Australian tribunal, to bind the employers of both States to pay the $2.19 per day.2 Another weakness in the wages board system is that employees, in the presence of an employer or a possible employer, have not the in­ dependent position which would enable them to act fearlessly. This is especially the case where, as in the case of city tramways, there is only one undertaking where a tramway man can get employment. In the case of the Brisbane tramways it appeared that it was the manager who, as a member of the wages board, made all the proposals, and that every one of his proposals was carried unanimously.3 Again, the decision of the wages board of one State is frequently inconsistent with the decision of the wages board of an adjoining State. There is no one final coordinating authority as in the case of the Federal court, and the result is often that contrasts appear, and dissatisfac­ tion arises, and industrial trouble. For instance, a large mining dis1 Engine drivers, S Com. Arb., 9, 17 (1911). 2 Boot factories, 4 Com. Arb., 1, 8 (1910). 8 Tramways, 6 Com. Arb., 130, 149 (1912). https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [107] 20 MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. trict, of essentially the same physical and industrial character, with the same cost of living, is divided by the artificial boundary line be­ tween two States. The wages board of one State prescribed one set of wages and conditions, the wages board of the other State pre­ scribed a lower set. The consequences were disastrous.1 A New South Wales wages board gave in the case of builders’ laborers,2 the lowest rate to scaffoklers, and the highest to hod men. The Victorian wages board gave the highest rate to scaffoklers. The New South Wales board gave a low rate to demolishers; the Victorian board gave the highest rate. The Federal court, when it came to act, prescribed a flat minimum rate for all the laborers, and the employees were satisfied. They knew that a man of exceptional value as a scaffolder or in any other capacity would still be able to demand and obtain a rate higher than the minimum. It is often said that the minimum rate tends to become the maximum, but there has been no proof of such tendency as yet. Moreover, the wages boards are often not suitably grouped, and there is a tendency to ignore the interests of unrepresented minorities, of employers as well as of employees. For example, there was in,Victoria a “ Flay, chaff, wood, and coal board,” composed, as to employers, of ordinary wood, coal, and produce re­ tailers. They managed to get a determination which kept their own yardmen at low wages, but fixed a disproportionately large minimum for yardmen who handled coke, because the gas company of the city was practically the only vender of coke and it was not represented on the board.3 But most of these defects, and other defects which I could point out, are not of the essence of the system and will probably be removed or obviated in the light of experience. Employers have assured me that they welcome the fixing of minimum rates by the boards or by the court. They know now definitely what they must pay, and, so long as they pay it they feel no more the incessant nag­ ging of unions or employees as to wages. Nor can any impartial person deny the immense relief which the system of wages boards has afforded to thousands of the most helpless families throughout Aus­ tralia. Wages boards constitute one of the most useful factors of those which tend in the words of Russell Lowell, to “ lift up the man­ hood of the poor” and to provide proper sustenance and upbringing for the children of the nation. Perhaps I should add here that up to the present I have not been able to trace any increase of price of commodities to the fixing of minimum wages. It is not the function of the court to ascertain the truth as to the causes of increased prices, but the court watches https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 1 Engine drivers, 7 Com.

[ 108] MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 21 for any sidelights on this important subject. In one case, I believe, a wages board raised the wages of milk carters by 24.33 cents per day and the milk vendors at once raised the price of milk by 2.03 cents per quart. For 100 quarts per day, this would mean an increase of receipts to the amount of $2.03 per day, so that the milk vendors had raised the price of milk far beyond the amount necessary to recoup them for the additional wages. It will be asked, however, what is the net result of the court of conciliation? Have strikes ceased in Australia? The answer must be that they have not. There have been numerous strikes in Aus­ tralia, as elsewhere. But since the act came into operation there has been no strike extending “ beyond the limits of any one State.” Those who are old enough to recall the terrible shearers’ strike and seamen’s strike of the “ nineties,” with their attendant losses and privations, turbulence and violence, will realize how much ground has been gained. The strikes which still occur within a single State, and disputes within a single State are outside the jurisdiction of the court. It can be safely said that, since the act, every dispute “ ex­ tending beyond the limits of any one State” comes before the court or the president, either on the application of parties to the dispute, or on the initiative of the officers of the court.1 Moreover, with the exception, of one doubtful case, in which I was not personally con­ cerned and do not know the full particulars, there has been no in­ stance of an award being flouted by the employees, no instance of the employees refusing to work under an award. There have been cases in which parties have differed in the interpretation of an award in its application to exceptional circumstances; there have been instances of inadvertent disobedience, and these cases have sometimes come to the courts in the form of an action for a penalty. But these were cases in which the award was treated as regulating the rights of the parties, not treated as a thing to be rejected. In 1911, Parliament intrusted to the court another formidable function, the settling of wages, hours, and conditions of labor for Federal public servants. This function does not rest on the con­ stitutional power to make laws for conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes;2 it rests on the absolute power of the Common­ wealth in relation to its own servants. The public servants are allowed to group themselves in unions, “ organizations,” as they think fit, and to approach the court with a plaint. It seems at first sight curious that Parliament should intrust any tribunal with a power of adjudicating on such subjects, but Parliament has been careful to retain the final control of the Commonwealth finances. For the award does not come into operation till the expiration of 30 i Sec. 19. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2 Sec. 51 (XXXV). [109] 22 MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. days after it has been laid before both houses, and Parliament can, if it sees fit, pass a resolution disapproving of the award. This remarkable jurisdiction over public servants deserves a study all to itself, and I can only say, though there have been several impor­ tant awards under it no award has yet met with the disapprobation of Parliament and no resolution of disapproval has even been tabled. In conclusion, I may state that I am not unaware of the farreaching schemes, much discussed everywhere, which contemplate conditions of society in which the adjustment of labor conditions between profit makers and wage earners may become unnecessary. Our Australian court has nothing to do with these schemes. It has to shape its conclusions on the solid anvil of existing industrial facts, in the fulfillment of definite official responsibilities. It has the advantage, as well as the disadvantage, of being limited in its powers and its objects. Its objective is industrial peace, as between those who do the work and those who direct it. It has no duty, it has no right to favor or to condemn any theories of social reconstruction. It neither hinders nor helps them. But it is obvious that even if all industries were to be carried on under State direction, industrial peace would be as vitally important as it is now; and that it could not be secured without recognition of the principle which the court has adopted, that each worker must have, at the least, his essential human needs satisfied, and that among the human needs there must be included the needs of the family. Sobriety, health, efficiency, the proper rearing of the young, morality, humanity, all depend greatly on family life, and family life can not be maintained without suitable economic conditions. The reasoning which has lately com­ mitted to the court the function of settling conditions of labor for public servants would not be less, would be even more applicable, if the State had more servants than it has. Yet, though the functions of the court are definite and limited, there is opened up for idealists a very wide horizon, with, perhaps, something of the glow of a sunrise. Men accept the doom, the blessing of work; they do not dispute the necessity of the struggle with nature for existence. They are willing enough to work, but even good work does not necessarily insure a proper human sub­ sistence, and when they protest against this condition of things they are told that their aims are too “ materialistic.” Give them relief from their materialistic anxiety; give them reasonable certainty that their essential material needs will be met by honest work, and you release infinite stores of human energy for higher efforts, for nobler ideals, when “ Body gets its sop, and holds its noise, and leaves soul free a little.” https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [ 110] MONTHLY REVIEW OP THE BUREAU OP LABOR STATISTICS. 23 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR CONFERENCE ON EMPLOYMENT HELD AT CHARLESTON, S. C., DECEMBER 16-17, 1915. In order to make more effective and widespread the services of the division of information in the Bureau of Immigration, the Depart­ ment of Labor has held two conferences on employment with officials of various States and municipalities engaged in placing the unem­ ployed in positions. The first conference of this kind was held at San Francisco, Cal., August 2-16, 1915, the proceedings of which were reported in the October issue of the M o n t h l y R e v i e w . The second conference was held at Charleston, S. C., on December 16-17, 1915, on the occasion of the meeting of a southern commercial con­ gress at that place'. I t aimed to bring the executive officers of the Department of Labor intrusted with the distribution of labor into touch with the official representatives of States and municipalities in the Southeastern part of the country engaged in similar activities. The Secretary of Labor was named chairman of the conference, and the Commissioner General of Immigration acting chairman. The following program was prepared for the two-day session. PROGRAM. I.

After deliberation and discussion, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted: Whereas, it is of paramount importance to the future of the Natiofi. and the several States that every effort be made by the Federal Government and the several State governments to conserve the human resources of the Nation, making each indi­ vidual as far as possible a self-sustaining and wealth-producing unit; and Whereas, the problems of the unemployed in the centers of population and in the manufacturing and rural districts, and of bringing men upon idle lands are matters of vital concern to the welfare of the whole country; and Whereas, the Secretary of Labor of the United States, having recognized fully these essential facts, has undertaken to provide intelligent and practical means for the solution of these two great problems and has called this district conference for the adaptation of the general plan to the conditions that must be met in the several States: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense of this conference that the success of the general plan proposed by the Secretary of Labor depends upon the application of the principles of cooperation, and therefore there should be the closest cooperation between the Fed­ eral, State, and municipal authorities dealing with these problems, thus making the system of handling purely democratic, avoiding waste of money in misdirected but well-meaning but independent efforts, and instead concentrating the useful effect of each dollar expended in a cumulative manner, and making, through cooperation of the Federal, State, and municipal authority acting jointly, a clearing house for un­ employment throughout the Republic, the Federal Government supplementing and aiding the States and municipalities in every way provided by law, and also estab­ lishing joint offices wherever that can be done, interchanging powers and opportuni­ ties for employment as far as possible, and affording under auspices of its officers, in furtherance of the plans of cooperation, to States and municipalities the use of the franking privilege, cooperation of the post offices in displaying notices, etc., and the States and municipalities utilizing their powers to the fullest extent in the premises. Resolved, That agreements be entered upon in all possible instances with existing State and municipal departments and bureaus whereby a representative of the United States Department of Labor will be stationed in such offices in the State as may be agreed upon for the purpose of cooperative work. Resolved, That this conference in taking this action proclaims that this cooperative effort is designed to provide employment for the unemployed American citizens and other residents of the United States and also to such citizens and residents upon desirable unused agricultural land, regardless of State or section whence they come, but in all instances taking due care and giving careful attention to natural preferences of different localities for laborers and settlers of particular types. Resolved, That the purpose of this entire effort is to care for unemployment prob­ lems in any State from the ranks of the unemployed of that State first, then from adjoining States, and then from distant States, etc., and so with the bringing of set­ tlers to the land. Resolved, That the Secretary of Labor be requested to put such plan of cooperation into effect in the States here represented at the earliest possible date. Resolved, That the officials representing States and municipalities at this confer­ ence recommend th at the plan of operation outlined in the foregoing be adopted by all States and municipalities in the South having departments or bureaus charged with the class of work contemplated, and, further, that those States and municipalities not having such departments or bureaus endeavor to secure by legislation such depart­ ments or bureaus, in order that they may adopt the plan. Resolved, That we express to the Secretary of Labor our thanks for calling this con­ ference, and respectfully suggest to him the calling of another such conference in the South in the spring. Whereas, There has been a quite encouraging response to the invitation of the Secre­ tary of Labor to meet in conference in this city, and Whereas: Those of us who have gathered here have been the recipients of many courtesies and attentions at the hands of our friends of the city of Charleston and of this hospitable State, now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the thanks of this conference be extended to those who have favored us with their presence and encouragement, to the officials of the State and city, and all others who have made our stay here both pleasant and inspiriting. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [112 ] MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 25 Those attending the Conference were— ’ Hon.

WILSON, SECRETARY OF LABOR, BEFORE THE FIRST SOUTHERN STATES CONFERENCE ON EMPLOYMENT AT CHARLESTON, S. C., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1915. Mr. Chairman, Governor, and gentlemen of the conference: I am reminded this afternoon of the words of the Master when he was here on earth that “ where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,” and I have always felt that where two or three are gathered together for the purpose of working out the problems of human association, there the Master is in the midst of them. When the Constitutional Convention met in 1787 one of the delegates from Massachu­ setts, Mr. Gerry, proposed at the opening of the sessions that there should be a record vote on all of the propositions that came before the convention, and Col. Mason, a delegate from Virginia, objected and made this suggestion: That they had come into that convention without any preconceived ideas of the ultimate form that the Con­ stitution should take; that during the discussions men would take particular view­ points relative to items, articles, or sections that should be included in the document, but after the fuller discussion of the subject matter their viewpoint might change, and https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [113] 26 MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. that it would be a very embarrassing situation in developing the Constitution if, as they went along, each one was required to make a record of his vote. It would be embarrassing because it would be difficult for him to overcome the natural prejudice there is against taking various viewpoints and then having to change them after dis­ cussion. I have felt that in these conferences we are holding in various parts of the country we are in exactly the same situation. We have come here without any fixed viewpoints. We have viewpoints, it is true, but they are not so unalterably fixed but that by discussion we may change them. If discussion did not change them this con­ ference would be valueless. In dealing with the problem of unemployment we have one of the greatest of the existing problems of human association before us. There has been a wonderful growth of our urban population. It has grown out of all proportions to our rural population. There has been a tremendous growth of our industrial activities, and because of the tremendous growth it has not been systematized along the line of utilizing our labor power to it3 fullest value. We have had exchanges for all kinds of things, all kinds of commodities. There have been built up places where men may come to invest in stocks; places where men may come to buy wheat, cotton, mules—anything and everything th at is in use; but we have had no clearing house where the employer and the employee could meet and know that both could be satisfied. The new Department of Labor of the Federal Government has been authorized among other things to advance the opportunities for profitable employment of the wage earners of the United States. In addition to that there is in the immigration laws a provision which creates a division of information for practically the same pur­ pose. We have undertaken to secure cooperation of State and municipal bodies on the same subject matter in order to make a more effective organization than the Federal Government could accomplish alone. We do not hope to solve entirely the problem of unemployment as a result of the work we are doing with regard to labor distribution. We do hope, however, that, in so far as there are opportunities for employment, by the establishment of clearing houses of information on that sub­ ject, these opportunities can be filled and by filling them reduce unemployment to a minimum. When we have reduced unemployment to a minimum, when we have found employment for every unemployed man for whom there is a job, then dealing with the balance will be a much easier problem than dealing with them now. In that connection it must always be borne in mind that the land is the basis upon which human existence rests, and if there are means open by which those who are unemployed in industrial pursuits may have access to the land, have means of culti­ vating the land, and of subsistence until they can get returns from the land, then we will be in a position to absolutely solve the question of unemployment and create a continuous balance as between the urban and rural population of our country. In connection with that we are suggesting to the Federal Congress the idea of placing at the disposal of the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Labor the surplus head tax that has accrued from the ad­ mission of aliens into the United States in excess of the cost of handling the Immigra­ tion Service. We believe that the head tax was never intended to be a producer of revenue; that it was placed upon the immigrant primarily for the purpose of meeting the expense of carrying on the Immigration Service, and secondly, of protecting the alien after he arrives in the United States. These were the purposes of imposing the tax on the immigrant, and yet the tax itself has produced a revenue of approximately ten million dollars in excess of the actual needs of the Immigration Service. That money is now in the Treasury of the United States. If Congress in its wisdom can be induced to appropriate that ten million dollars to be continuously available for ex­ penditure under the joint direction of the three departments, while it is but a drop in the bucket compared with the problem with which we are dealing, yet it could be https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [114] MONTHLY REVIEW OE THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 27 used over and over again to assist in relieving the problem of unemployment in oyr large cities. Under ordinary circumstances there are large numbers of unemployed men in our big cities who have had agricultural training and there are people coming to our shores every day who have had agricultural training in Europe, and who, if they had the means, would gladly go out upon our lands. They do not go out, how­ ever, from our cities, either the native or the alien, as farm laborers, because of the fact that in nearly every instance farm labor is seasonal labor; and while they may go out for a season or two seasons and find employment, they ultimately drift back into the towns and cities and are unable to get back into our agricultural communities and acquire land. They have not the means in the first place, and, not having the means, of course, our banking institutions can not give them the necessary credits. You would not want nor like to be a depositor in a banking institution that accepted credits of that kind as a basis for its loans. Banking institutions in order to be sound, in order to be faithful to the community in which they exist, must insist upon some kind of substantial credits that can be realized upon in order that they may be protected in their loans. If these ten millions of dollars, however, could be made available for the three departments mentioned and utilized fo.r the acquisition of lands, then divide the lands in such a manner as to establish community centers where community life would exist even on the farm, then take your colonists out to occupy your lands in that particular community, utilizing mortgages upon the lands as a basis for credit and personal notes as a protec­ tion for the money advanced for the purchase of tools and machinery with which to work the farms and for subsistence; and if, in addition to the mortgage and notes, you have the indorsement of every member of the community for each individual, you would have a class of security that would make the Government practically absolutely safe in loaning this money without having to use bank securities for it. The money would be coming back in two or three years and keep on coming back. If it was found that the expenditure of that ten millions was a practical matter, it would not be difficult to induce Congress to make additional appropriations. One difficulty occurs, however, and that is that when the Federal Government steps into South Carolina or any other State and acquires land in that manner, immediately the adjoining land is enhanced in value. The people who hold the adjacent land will not sell it to the Federal Government at the same rates that the first tract was acquired. So there should be some means for preventing those who are holders of the land from securing the unearned increment that they have not been responsible for creating. So that means ought to be devised that the Government could buy the surrounding land at the same price paid for the first tract whenever the owners desired to sell. Whether that can be worked out I do not know, but I throw the thought out as worthy of consideration. In carrying out the work of labor distribution our first problem was that of dealing with the harvest hands in the Middle West, and then the work of industrial institu­ tions. In brief we have come to this conclusion, that the proper course for us to pursue is to have the municipal, the State and the Federal agencies operating in the same suite of rooms, with the municipal agency utilizing its close touch with the people of the community for the gathering and dissemination of information relative to employment; the State agency utilizing its close touch with people in the State for the purpose of gathering and disseminating information; the Federal institution utilizing its broader field and its franking privilege in order to keep both branches in touch with exterior points; and that by the three cooperating in the .same building and in the same suite of rooms you have created but one central clearing house for labor, and there would not be the mixed condition that would grow out of having the three labor bureaus in the same city working separately. There could be as many branches as the needs of the city or State required, but they should all be managed https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [115] 28 MONTHLY REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. cooperatively. By doing so we can reduce unemployment to the minimum, and having reduced it to the minimum we can proceed to deal with the problem of the un­ employed who still remain, free from the embarrassment of having a large number of unemployed. I thank you gentlemen from the various States and cities for your courtesy in responding to our invitation to be here. I want to assure you that we seek to cooperate with you to the fullest extent in solving these great problems of unemployment and a sensible, practica"
