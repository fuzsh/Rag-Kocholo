My Captain!” is an elegy written in 1865 by Walt Whitman, a poem on the tragic death of American president Abraham Lincoln. The poem was first published in the pamphlet Sequel to Drum-Taps which assembled 18 poems regarding the American Civil War, including another Lincoln elegy, “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d”. It was included in Whitman’s comprehensive collection Leaves of Grass beginning with its fourth edition published in 1867.\n\nSource(s)\n\n“הוֹ קְבַרְנִיט! קְבַרְנִיטִי!‏ | O Captain!

He was born in Dovsk near Rogachev (now in Belarus), then in the Russian Empire in 1899. Halkin emigrated to New York City with his family in 1914. He lived and studied in the United States from 1914 to 1932. He studied at the Hebrew Union College and Columbia University. In the US, he taught Hebrew Literature and Language. He worked as an English teacher in Tel Aviv from 1932 to 1939, but then returned to America, to become professor of Hebrew Literature at the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. He made his final move to Israel in 1949, when he succeeded Joseph Klausner as Professor of Modern Hebrew Literature and became head of the department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nWalt Whitman\n\nWalt Whitman (May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist, and journalist. A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse."
