        "text": "An episode from 7/19/24: Tonight, I read the small biographies of nearly two dozen poets, the kind of colorful summaries usually found in poetry anthologies. In many cases, reading a paragraph or two about twenty people is enough to get the sense of a life, and of just how varied the lives of poets (or anybody) can really be. The biographies come from Volume One and Volume Two of the Poem a Day series.\n\nYou can support Human Voices Wake Us here, or by ordering any of my books: Notes from the Grid, To the House of the Sun, The Lonely Young & the Lonely Old, and Bone Antler Stone.\n\nEmail me at humanvoiceswakeus1@gmail.com.\n\nAn episode from 7/5/24: Tonight, I devote an hour to wondering how we talk about childhood and memory, how we live with memory and meaning, how we perceive time and recollect the most vivid events of our lives.\n\nFor me, music is inseparable from all of this, and I play a few songs in this episode: Mother Natureâs Son (The Beatles), High Hopes (Pink Floyd), T. S. Eliot reading from East Coker, the Molto Adagio from String Quartet #15/Op. 132 (Beethoven), Mishima (Closing) (Philip Glass), American Beauty (Thomas Newman), the Andante Adagio from String Quartet #3: Reflections on my childhood/Childhood Fantasia in New England (Alan Hovhaness).\n\nThis episode grew out of a conversation with Tom Hart at Sequential Artists Workshop, and I dedicate to him.\n\nYou can support Human Voices Wake Us here, or by ordering any of my books: Notes from the Grid, To the House of the Sun, The Lonely Young & the Lonely Old, and Bone Antler Stone.

During a 2015 Fresh Air interview with LÃ¡szlÃ³ Nemes and GÃ©za RÃ¶hrig about their 2015 film, Son of Saul, a brief story about an actual Sonderkommando member is told. It remains one of the most overwhelming minutes that I have ever heard.\n\nIn the second part, I read from Daniel Mendelsohnâs 2006 book, The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million. The book is Mendelsohnâs attempt to discover what happened to six members of his family who were murdered in the Holocaust, and the section I read from is about the difficulty of truly entering the mind and situation of a sixteen year-old girl, who is rounded up with a thousand other Jews, and murdered.\n\nYou can support Human Voices Wake Us here, or by ordering any of my books: Notes from the Grid, To the House of the Sun, The Lonely Young & the Lonely Old, and Bone Antler Stone.

Couched in a much longer narrative that contains shape-shifting, war, revenge, brief appearances by Odin and Loki, and finally Sigurdâs ability to hear the language of birds and animals, it is a brilliant and vivid example of storytelling in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\n\nI read from the two great sources of the story, the Volsung Saga (in the Jesse Byock translation) and Snorri Sturlusonâs Prose Edda (in the Anthony Faulkes translation). I also discuss the history of the story, and its reworking in the Nibelungenlied, and Wagnerian opera.\n\nListen to the other Great Myths here.\n\nYou can support Human Voices Wake Us here, or by ordering any of my books: Notes from the Grid, To the House of the Sun, The Lonely Young & the Lonely Old, and Bone Antler Stone.

His books Crow, Moortown Diary, Remains of Elmet, and River contain his best poetry, and they are models for any artist in how handle nature, animal life, myth, and autobiography in their work. The poems that read are:\n\nA Childish Prank (the audio of Hughes reading the poem comes from here)\n\nCrow's First Lesson\n\nCrow Tyrannosaurus\n\nCrow & the Birds\n\nCrowego\n\nCrow Blacker than Ever\n\nCrow's Last Stand\n\nCrow & the Sea\n\nFragments of an Ancient Tablet\n\nNotes for a Little Play\n\nLovesong\n\nLittleblood\n\nCrow's Courtship\n\nCrow's Song about God\n\nThis is a revision and complete re-recording of an episode first posted in August of 2021, which included fewer poems. I've used the opportunity to also read from Jonathan Bate's biography of Hughes, Hughes's later notes to the book, as well as handful of letters he wrote about the collection.\n\nYou can support Human Voices Wake Us here, or by ordering any of my books: Notes from the Grid, To the House of the Sun, The Lonely Young & the Lonely Old, and Bone Antler Stone. I've also edited a handful of books in the S4N Pocket Poems series.\n\nEmail me at humanvoiceswakeus1@gmail.com.\n\nAn episode from 4/17/24: Tonight, I read a handful of poems on modern lifeâwhatever âmodernâ might mean in words spanning the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries. In many of the poems we hear the complaint of every age, that âthe world has never been so bad.â In others, descriptions of the suburbs are enough, or of car culture, or of how we get our news or even begin to live with stories of atrocity and war. Some poems ask us to pay attention to the work and details of everyday life, others wonder if we shouldnât look to past poets for wisdom and guidance. If a âmodernâ mindset means anything, it seems to mean proliferation and flux, a sense of not being settled.

All of them can be found in his Collected Poems. I also read from his letters, and the essay about Stevens at The Poetry Foundation. The poems are:\n\nAnecdote of the Jar\n\nThe Snow Man\n\nSix Significant Landscapes\n\nAnecdote of Men by the Thousand\n\nHow to Live.

Tonight, I read only a small sampling from Norman Longmate's How We Lived Then: A History of Everyday Life During the Second World War.\n\nThe book focuses on the home front in Britain and the experiences, mostly, of everyday civilians, the elderly, women, and children: How do you live through the Blitz? How do parents say goodbye to their children, millions of whom were relocated from urbans areas to the countryside, to protect them from attack? How do you eat when food is rationed, what kind of social life is possible, and was the BBC allowed to be funny (spoiler alert: yes)?\n\nYou can support Human Voices Wake Us here, or by ordering any of my books: Notes from the Grid, To the House of the Sun, The Lonely Young & the Lonely Old, and Bone Antler Stone.\n\nEmail me at humanvoiceswakeus1@gmail.com.\n\nAn episode from 12/13/23: Thereâs a certain lesson Iâve learned from sports figures, poets, and critics, and I was reminded of it while watching Bradley Cooperâs new movie about Leonard Bernstein, Maestro. What does it mean that the attention and opportunities that so many aspiring musicians and conductors dream of, only ever lands on a few people, like Bernstein?\n\nAnd what does it mean that the earliest dreams of actorsâwhich include being able to portray figures like Bernstein, and to recreate and embody defining moments in their livesâalso only ever lands on a few people, like Bradley Cooper? While talking about this, I play an excerpt from a New Yorker interview with Bradley Cooper from last month.\n\nI end the episode with a small question for all of us: considering how easy it is nowadays to find a new book, movie, podcast, or album, has anyone out there developed a disciplined way of saying no, of stopping, of creating time when absolutely nothing of culture can intrude?\n\nYou can support Human Voices Wake Us here, or by ordering any of my books: Notes from the Grid, To the House of the Sun, The Lonely Young & the Lonely Old, and Bone Antler Stone.\n\nEmail me at humanvoiceswakeus1@gmail.com.\n\nAn episode from 11/13/23: Tonight, I talk about our attachment to music as teenagers and adults, and the lessons that loving musicâand finding meaning in musiciansâ life storiesâcan teach us.\n\nFirst, I read two passages from Patti Smithâs memoir, Just Kids. Those parts on her early life with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, before either of them were well-known, are incredibly moving. Next, I talk about my attachment to the band Mazzy Star, and then read from a listenerâs email about seeing the band Living Colour perform live for the first time, after years of listening to their music. Finally, I read a few passages from Words Without Music, a memoir by the composer Philip Glass.\n\nIf you have a story of your own to share about art, creativity, religion or myth, email me about it and it could appear in an upcoming episode.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

It is being published simultaneously at Bryan Heltonâs The Basilisk Tree, and once again I give Bryan my infinite thanks.\n\nThis will be the third long poem of mine that he has published this year to coincide with an episode of Human Voices Wake Us â the other two are on Leonardo da Vinci and Pythagoras. Please take the time to check out the rest of The Basilisk Tree, or to even submit your own poetry.\n\nWhile introducing my Shakespeare poem, I mention that it was in part inspired by an episode I did here on the (real or fictional) love life of Walt Whitman.

Since an illness has kept me from recording a new episode this week, I thought it worthwhile collecting those six weeks of shorter readings here:\n\n3 Poems from my long work-in-progress, The Great Year: âThe Autumn Village,â âI was in Iceland centuries ago, â âSmith Looks Up the Long Roadâ\n\nTwo readings from Shakespeare: âOf comfort no man speakâ (Richard II, act II scene 2), âAll the worldâs a stageâ (As You Like It, act II scene 7)\n\n3 Poems on Work: Philip Levine (1928-2015): âAmong Children,â Elma Mitchell (1919-2000), âThoughts After Ruskin,\" Mary Robinson (1758-1800), âA London Summer Morningâ\n\nFavorites from T. S. Eliotâs Four Quartets\n\nThree Poets & Mythology: Eavan Boland (1944-2020), âThe Making of an Irish Goddess,\" Michael Longley (b. 1939) âThe Butchers,\" Robert Pinsky (b. 1940), âThe Figured Wheelâ\n\nBlake & His Animals: Three passages from William Blake (1757-1827): one from Visions of the Daughters of Albion and the last two from Milton. I hope that plucking these three passages from his longer work can suggest how variedânot just how prophetic and opaque, but simply beautifulâso much of his poetry can be.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

Through a discussion of two of his paintings which depict decapitation, we can understand how, in Caravaggio's early career, he was able to paint directly from life; but when he went on the run to escape a charge of murder, he depended instead upon his memory.\n\nIn the second part, I read from the father of history, Herodotus (c. 484-c. 425 BCE), and his description of royal the burial rites of the \"barbarian\" Scythians, who lived in the area of the Black Sea. The translation and essays I read are from the Landmark Herodotus, edited by Robert B. Strassler.\n\nIn the last part, I play a section of a talk given by Ian McKellen on the \"Tomorrow and tomorrow\" speech from Macbeth.

Nowhere else is the terror and mystery of human suffering more deeply expressed, and Godâs response to it remains a confounding and sublime performance. The translation is by Raymond Scheindlin.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

It isnât hard to come by details of Heaneyâs life, but Stepping Stones (where Heaney is interviewed at length in what amounts to an autobiography), is a good place to start. His poems are collected in 100 Poems, and in the individual collections.\n\nThere are many ways to look at Heaneyâs work, and the ten poems I choose only present one picture: a poet as at home on the farm as he was at Harvard; as interested in literary history as in archaeology and the deep interior of the Irish imagination; as concerned with childhood, memory, and family as with the darkest aspects of human life. In introducing these poems, I reflect on Heaneyâs importance in my own life, and the huge impact his death had on me, ten years ago this month.\n\nThe poems I read are:\n\nPersonal Helicon (Death of a Naturalist, 1966)\n\nThe Forge and Bogland (Door into the Dark, 1969)\n\nThe Tollund Man (Wintering Out, 1972)\n\nThe Strand at Lough Beg (Field Work, 1979)\n\nSquarings #2, #8, #40 (Seeing Things, 1991)\n\nfrom his translations of Beowulf (1999)\n\nUncoupled (Human Chain, 2010)\n\nThe episode ends with Heaney's reading of \"The Tollund Man.\"\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

What circumstances can lead one monarch to order the execution of another? And why, over the past twenty years, was Mary Oliver the best-selling poet in America? Tonight's episode is another three-parter:\n\nIn the first part, I read from one of the great scholars of the Hebrew Bible in our time, James Kugel. I focus on a passage from his How to Read the Bible, and his summary of the variety of meanings that the twenty-third Psalm have inspired since it was first written. He asks how we judge the validity of any interpretation.\n\nIn the second part, I read from Peter Ackroyd's Tudors, on the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587).\n\nIn the third part, I read three poems from the American poet Mary Oliver (1935-2019). They can all be found in her career-spanning selection, Devotions: \"White Owl Flies into and Out of the Field,\" \"Wild Geese,\" and \"Snow Moon - Black Bear Gives Birth.\"\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

The translation is by T. J. Luce.\n\nIn the second part, I read from the diary of the French art historian AgnÃ¨s Humbert, who lived in Paris during the first months of the German occupation in World War Two, and who was involved in some of the earliest resistance activities in France.\n\nFinally, I read a small section of William Blakeâs long poem, Milton, where his personal mythology is given free reign over the city of London.\n\nThe music I play in the introduction, from Ludwig Goransonâs score to the movie Oppenheimer, can be found here.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

It is remarkable how the album was made by Springsteen, alone in his bedroom, with a cheap recorder. For someone who bridges and so seamlessly combines music of the fifties, sixties and seventies, Nebraska sounds nearly timeless.\n\nIn the second part, I read a small section from Simon Schama's 1995 book, â Landscape and Memoryâ . Here, he talks about not just his own Jewish ancestry, who hailed from the woods and forests of Ruthenia (on the border between today's Poland and Lithuania), but also about the fate of one Polish village's Jewish population, during and following World War Two.\n\nIn the third part, I read from book 24 of â Homer's Iliadâ , translated by Richmond Lattimore. In one of the most moving scenes anywhere in Homer's epics, Priam, the king of Troy, pays a visit to Achilles, the greatest warrior on the Greek side. Achilles has only recently killed Priam's son, Hector, in battle, and the old man comes to Achilles for beg for his son's body back, so that he can be given a proper funeral and burial.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

The most prominent voices here are those of Robert Oppenheimer and his fellow physicists, whose dedication and excitement to develop the bomb was matched only by their misgivings (though rarely their outright regret) in the years after World War Two.\n\nWhile I previously dedicated four long episodes to the subject, I tried here to isolate the most vivid quotations, and the most difficult ideas, into one episode. The sources I drew on for this episode are:\n\nâ The Making of the Atomic Bombâ , by Richard Rhodes\n\nâ Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bombâ , by Richard Rhodes\n\nâ American Prometheus: The Triumph & Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimerâ , by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin\n\nâ J.

The first is an excerpt from Rachel Carson's (1907-1964) â The Sea Around Usâ , on the deep history of the sea, and the beginnings of all life within it. Next is an excerpt from archaeologist Barry Cunliffe's â Facing the Ocean: The Atlantic and Its Peoplesâ , where he illustrates all the strategies and passed-down knowledgeâof winds, tides, currents, landmarks, marine life, etc.âthat sailors in prehistoric Europe would have utilized to travel on the ocean.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us â on Substackâ , where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

The poem follows an Irish immigrant making his way through the American South, North and West, during the Civil War. The book is part travelogue, battle epic, and spiritual biography, and after describing how the book was written, I read one of my favorite sections from late in the poem, where the protagonist finds himself as a kind of shaman and religious figure, wandering the West.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

First is the entry on Weaving from Taschenâs Book of Symbols; next, from Michael Pyeâs The Edge of the World, is the story of the city of Domburg, in the Netherlands, and the tremendous archaeological finds that storms and the shifting North Sea have revealed there, over the centuries; and last, from Mircea Eliadeâs Patterns in Comparative Religion, are a few remarks on the religious significance which farming once held, in premodern agricultural societies.\n\nThe question I ask, about the spiritual significance once given to what now appear to be straightforward, practicalâand even machine-dominatedâtasks, is to wonder what aspects of our everyday lives can be made sacred in the same way? Is this possible any more?\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

I am also thrilled that the poem is being simultaneously published at The Basilisk Tree. Many thanks to its editor, Bryan Helton, for coordinating all of this with me.\n\nFor anyone who wants to look closer at the earliest Classical accounts of Pythagoras, his life, and his teachings, check out: The History of Greek Philosophy Volume 1: The Earlier Presocractics and the Pythagoreans, by W.

Tonight, I devote an entire episode to Odinâs many masks: as poet and shaman, as god of death and war, and as the perfect embodiment of the world as the Norse knew it, filled with brutality and betrayal. The episode is divided into three sections:\n\n(about 5:37) On Odin and poetry; a reading of the most famous stanzas from the Havamal, and the story of Odinâs theft of the Mead of Poetry\n\n(about 58:07) On Odin and warfare, death\n\n(about 1:22:06) What archeology, and classical and medieval historians, can tell us about Odin\n\nThe nonfiction books I rely on for most of this episode are E. O. G. Turville-Petreâs Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia, Rudolf Simekâs â Dictionary of Northern Mythologyâ , and John Lindowâs â Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals & Beliefsâ .\n\nThe translations I read from are: â â Andy Orchardâs translation of the Poetic Edda, â Anthony Faulkesâ âs and â Jesse Byockâ âs translations of the Prose Edda, and Lee M. Hollanderâs translation of the Heimskringla.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

In my own life, I ask if perhaps poetry, writingâand even this podcastâfall into that category, and wonder if itâs all worth it.\n\nThe music used for the intro is Pink Floyd's \"Is There Anybody Out There?\"\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

Tonight, I read from the scattered remarks of John, Paul, George, and Ringo that are found at the beginning of the huge hardcover book The Beatles Anthology, and which cover their childhoods and the years before The Beatles became famous. As you listen, ask yourself how your own childhood might be summarized and collected from anecdotes like these.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

The book spans his entire career, and his lifelong preoccupations with history, violence, family, and mythology.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

Tonightâs episode is devoted to Jonathan Bateâs biography, Radical Wordsworth: The Poet Who Changed the World, where he more than answers the question. For me, anyone who cares about poetry devoted to nature, introspection, and autobiography, can still learn the most from Wordsworth. And his concernsâthe necessity of emotion and plain language in poetry, the belief that we have no greater story to tell than our own, and his love for the natural worldâare as contemporary as anything on the news.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

As I mention, living as I do in a city usually inundated with snow, it has been bizarre to have not shoveled the driveway even once. And since the next few weeks of episodes are already planned out, it seemed appropriate to get to spring early, since the earth is doing that already. The poems are:\n\nEmily Dickinson (1830-1886), âThere is another skyâ\n\ne. e. cummings (1894-1962), âO sweet spontaneousâ\n\nRichard Eberhart (1904-2005), âThis Fevers Meâ\n\nKenneth Rexroth (1905-1982), from âToward an Organic Philosophyâ\n\nVernon Watkins (1906-1967), from âThe Tributary Seasonsâ\n\nEdna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950), âSpringâ (âTo what purpose, April, do you return again?â\n\nAbbie Huston Evans (1881-1983), âThe Old Yellow Shopâ\n\nElinor Wylie (1885-1928), from âWild Peachesâ\n\nHenry King (1592-1669), âA Contemplation upon Flowersâ\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564-1616), from Act 3 of King Lear\n\nTed Hughes (1930-1998), âFour March Watercoloursâ\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

How to get by in the world as a devotee of culture, solitude, ritual, beauty, tradition and individuality?\n\nThere is of course no one answer, and anyway, poetry should stay as far away from direct âadvice,â or proscription of any kind. Still, when I sit back and think about the kind of poems that help me through the day â and the months, and the years â these are some of them:\n\nWallace Stevens (1879-1955), How to Live What to Do\n\nGalway Kinnell (1927-2014), Tillamook Journal\n\nEdith Nesbit (1858-1924), Things That Matter\n\nSeamus Heaney (1939-2013), #2 from Lightenings\n\nRobinson Jeffers (1887-1962), Joy\n\nLouise GlÃ¼ck (1943-), Summer Night\n\nW. B. Yeats (1865-1939), A Prayer on Going into My House\n\nEmily BrontÃ« (1818-1848), âOften rebuked, yet always back returningâ\n\nHenry Vaughan (1621-1695), Man\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

Are poems about family and friendship love poems, just as much as those about romantic feeling, and longing, and heartbreak?\n\nAnd even more: what is romantic love? What, for instance, did T. S. Eliot mean when he said, âLove is most nearly itself/When here and now cease to matter,â or when Emily Dickinson wrote of âWild nightsâ?\n\nThe poems I read are:\n\nTed Hughes (1930-1998), Bride and Groom Lie Hidden for Three Days\n\nWallace Stevens (1879-1955), Bouquet of Belle Scavoir\n\nKatherine, Lady Dyer (c.1585-1654), Epitaph on Sir William Dyer\n\nElizabeth Barret Browning (1806-1861), #43& #44in Sonnets from the Portuguese\n\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892), #7from In Memoriam\n\nMatthew Arnold (1822-1888), Dover Beach\n\nRuth Pitter (1897-1992), But for Lust\n\nElizabeth Jennings (1926-2001), One Flesh\n\nSeamus Heaney (1939-2013), #3 in Clearances\n\nLouise GlÃ¼ck (1943-), Brown Circle\n\nEavan Boland (1944-2020), The Necessity for Irony\n\nWalt Whitman (1819-1892), To a Stranger\n\nEmily Dickinson (1830-1886), Wild Nights\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

Thanks to a letter written by Fyodor Dostoevsky, who visited Dickens in London in 1862, we also hear Dickens speaking privately in a way that he rarely did publicly, admitting that his villains were better reflections of himself than his more lovable and generous characters. We also answer the question: what do David Copperfield and Jane Eyre have in common?\n\nFrom the introduction to her Selected Stories, Alice Munro (born in 1931, and winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize) describes how, as a homemaker, she came to writing short stories very nearly by necessity. She also discusses how she set her first attempts at fiction in faraway, historical, or BrontÃ«-inspired surroundings, and only later came to see the artistic potential of her own backyard, in the Lake Huron region of Canada.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

Rephrased only slightly, nearly all of their concerns (over technology, gender, nationalism, war, eugenics) feel like they could appear in the news or on the street today. Then and now, what is actually going on alongside all the dread? What can we learn from these voices that sound so much like our own, and what will people look back on 2023 learn for themselves?\n\nEach of these quotations can be found in Philipp Blomâs wonderful book, â The Vertigo Years: Europe, 1900-1914â .\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

What does prose require that poetry does not, and vice-versa, especially when the accounts we have are separated by centuries of historical change, and religious conversion?\n\nIn this third episode on Norse Mythology, I read the story of Ragnarok from the Prose Edda (dating to c. 1220), and then its corresponding section in the poem Voluspa (c. 1000) in the Poetic Edda. Each section is preceded by the story of the death of Odin's son, Balder, which in many ways precipitated Ragnarok. I also read from a later poem, Balder's Dreams (c. 1300).\n\nThe translation of the Poetic Edda (and Balder's Dreams) that I read from is by Andy Orchard, and the Prose Edda by Anthony Faulkes. The commentary I read from throughout the episode comes from the translation and commentary by Ursula Dronke.\n\nThe essential reference books on Norse myth that I will be using for this series are John Lindowâs Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals & Beliefs, Rudolf Simekâs Dictionary of Northern Mythology, and Andy Orchardâs Cassell Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend.\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

In the same generation as T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, Williams is perhaps best known for never becoming an expatriate, and instead living most of his life as a family doctor in Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nHis poems can be found in The Collected Poems Volume I: 1909-1939, The Collected Poems Volume II: 1939-1962, and Paterson. The biographies I read from are Paul Marianiâs William Carlos Williams: A New World Naked, and the essay on Williamsâ life at The Poetry Foundation.\n\nThe poems I read are:\n\nPastoral (1917)\n\nDanse Russe (1917)\n\nWaiting (1921)\n\nThe Great Figure (1921)\n\nThe Red Wheelbarrow (1923)\n\nFlowers by the Sea (first version) (1931)\n\nWar, the Destroyer! (1942)\n\nApproach to a City (1946)\n\nTo a Dog Injured in the Street (1954)\n\nDeep Religious Faith (1954)\n\nfrom Asphodel, That Greeny Flower (1955)\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

It was there, at the age of twenty-sevenâand after years of personal and professional failuresâthat he hit bottom â¦ and suddenly realized he was an artist.\n\nIn the first half of the episode, I read from Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smithâs biography, â Van Gogh: The Lifeâ . The second half is devoted to a handful of letters Van Gogh wrote to his brother in 1879 and 1880, where he admits the humiliation of his failures, and then revels in his newfound passion for drawing and painting. The letters can be â found online hereâ .\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.

Macy in the movie Magnolia, who has âa lot of love to give?â And are you like van Gogh, who knows he has a purpose, but canât find it yet?\n\nDonât forget to support Human Voices Wake Us on Substack, where you can also get our newsletter and other extras.
