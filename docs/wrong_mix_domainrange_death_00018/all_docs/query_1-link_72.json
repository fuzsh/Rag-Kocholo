        "text": "This paper aims at investigating the ways in which Walt Whitman incorporated and grappled with the issue of the Civil War in his poetry. Throughout his life and work, he promoted himself as the poet of American democracy. However, this sense of joy and celebration was temporarily disrupted by the Civil War and its ugly aftermaths; Whitman \" s optimism was blighted for a while, but his boundless faith in human goodness enabled him to transcend the evil of the Civil War. He soon realized that the atrocities and horrors of the Civil War and the corruption he witnessed during the Reconstruction Era were only transient phases in American history and that America will rise from the ashes into something more beautiful and regenerate.\n\nOn the surface, the old English poem The Wanderer as adapted by J.R.R. Tolkien for The Lord of The Rings seems to be confronting the age-old loneliness and grief as experienced by the exile. Although the author and origins of this poem are unknown, The Wanderer is a narrative poem of the epic style. It is of substantial length, elevated language, and includes a central heroic figure along with nearly all the poetic literary devices (Hill,630)."
