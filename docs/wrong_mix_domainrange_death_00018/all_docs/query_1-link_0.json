        "text": "3.\n\nNew York City\n\n\"Immigrants arriving,\n\nfifteen or twenty thousand in a week . . .\"\n\n\"Mannahatta\"\n\nAlthough the events of 1871 are not especially memorable in American history, the year offers a good starting place for a consideration of relationships between Walt Whitman and the Irish. Essential to this consideration are two letters written by Whitman in the summer of that year, each of which suggests he had found in New York's Irish community verification of his long-held faith in the gradual absorption by his country's immigrants of the principles and practices of democracy. It could not have come at a better time for the poet of democracy, who in the same year published Democratic Vistas, a somber prose meditation revealing a generally bleak outlook on the nation's future. That we should see in Whitman's private letters a glimmer of hope occasioned by the sight of New York City's Irish policemen, even while he publicly castigated American society as \"canker'd, crude, superstitious, and rotten,\" is not something to be ignored.1 The glimmer is especially significant because Whitman had not always been so sanguine about the city's Irish immigrants, especially the Irish Catholics. Indeed, his earliest published utterances on them were filled with the kind of venom most often associated with nativism. Unfortunately, the alteration was not so public as had been his earlier attack, appearing as it did in private correspondence rather than, as before, in a public newspaper. In truth, it must be allowed that his warming toward the Irish may have been somewhat influenced (since Whitman was susceptible to such influences) by a show of appreciation for his work coming at about this time from a group of writers and scholars in Dublin. Certainly he was influenced by his deep love for particular Irish friends, some of whom were born in Ireland and others born in America. But there is no reason to doubt that Whitman was also genuinely impressed in 1871 by the changes that time had wrought in the condition and the character of New York's largest ethnic group. There is, in fact, reason enough to believe he welcomed the thought that his early belief in the democratic impulses of the Irish immigrants was vindicated by those changes.\n\nWhitman's exposure to the Irish in the cities of Brooklyn and New York spanned the years before and after the great migration spurred by the famines in Ireland that began in 1845. In New York the pre-famine Irish population has been estimated as high as twenty-five thousand, or one-fourth of the city's total.2 Mostly Protestant, either Anglican or Presbyterian, the earliest immigrants joined the middle class in Brooklyn and New York. Some of those who came after the 1798 uprising, men like Thomas Addis Emmett and William James Mac Nevin, were by their culture and refinement considerably more aristocratic than their revolutionary activities would indicate. De Witt Clinton, United States senator, mayor of New York City, and governor of New York, was of Irish descent. When he initiated New York's great engineering project, construction of the Erie Canal (completed in 1825), he coincidentally opened up employment opportunities for hundreds of Irishmen.\n\nIn subsequent decades Catholic Irish immigrants were increasingly among the poor who gathered in neighborhoods on the fringes of middle-class enclaves. Whitman's recollection, in 1889, of a family by the name of Murphy whom he had known \"in New York 30 or 40 years ago—famous men in their line—stationers,\" is an indication of the prosperity attained by the earlier arrivals.3 An 1866 New York Times description, however, of the Irish living in the area just south of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the largest allotment of poor Irish were found and not far from where Whitman's family was living, offers a different picture, one that Whitman could not have ignored:\n\nHere homeless and vagabond children, ragged and dirty, wander about; here the utterly poor congregate; and here accumulate all the causes of pestilence or disease; decaying garbage, dead animals, filthy and unclean privies, with crowds of unwashed human beings packed together, and houses badly arranged for ventilation. Here the drainage or sewerage is usually imperfect and the whole soil is thus ripe for diarrhea or cholera.4\n\nIn New York City conditions were no better. Edgar Allan Poe described an Irish squatter camp in the southern portion of the site where Central Park was later built. By Poe's account, a typical Irish shanty there was about \"nine feet by six, with a pigsty applied externally, by way both of portico and support.\" Built entirely of mud, the shanty, as Poe recalls it, would seem to have been \"erected in somewhat too obvious an imitation of the Tower of Pisa.\"5 In other parts of the city the Irish were crowded into buildings and neighborhoods never designed to hold such large numbers of people. One result of this, as the Times noted, was contamination of the city water supply drawn from shallow wells. When cholera struck the worst neighborhoods of the city in 1832 and 1835 as the result of the contaminated water, the Irish who lived there were believed to be the cause of the contagion.6 Cholera, a concomitant of poverty and, more specifically, of a lack of sanitation and pure water, spread rapidly among the Irish. As a result, their poverty became so linked with the disease in the minds of the city's more fortunate that cholera came to be looked upon by many as a necessary scourge of nature eliminating the poorest, and least \"desirable,\" members of society.\n\nWhitman seems not to have been completely immune to this line of reasoning. Though he was in the safer regions of Brooklyn and Long Island while the epidemic raged in 1832, he later worked it into one of his fiction pieces, presenting the disease in such a way as to somewhat uphold the belief that epidemics can function as a means of moral cleansing. In the summer of 1845 he published \"Revenge and Requital; A Tale of a Murderer Escaped,\" in John L. O'Sullivan's Democratic Review. It is the story of Philip Marsh, a man who commits murder and escapes the law before punishment can be meted out. Marsh finds redemption for his guilty soul by nursing cholera victims in the \"dirtiest and wretchedest section of the city, between Chatham and Centre streets.\" The location was on the fringe of Five Points, in the Sixth Ward—known as the \"Bloody Ould Sixth\"—where the poorest of the city's Irish were congregated, the same area to which Jacob Riis would turn for material for his 1890 exposé of conditions among the city's poor. Though it is unlikely it was his first visit, given his journalistic career, Whitman mentioned going to the Five Points area in September 1868, claiming the visit was \"instructive but disgusting.\"7 While Marsh's redemption, gained through selfless contact with contagion, is not the interpretation of cholera's purgative effects adopted by the morally righteous of the city, it partakes of the generalized belief that such widespread disasters can offer opportunities for moral redemption and cleansing; indeed, Whitman describes the murderer as an \"unterrified angel of mercy and charity\" and as a \"messenger of health.\"8\n\nIn 1849 when cholera struck New York again, Whitman became concerned for the inhabitants of Brooklyn and two years later wrote an article in that city's daily Advertiser ( June 28, 1851) on the need for pure water to be supplied by the city, as New York had done for its citizens by building the Croton reservoir. Later, in \"Song of Myself,\" Whitman identified not with the healer, as in his story of Philip Marsh, but with the victims of the disease:\n\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp,\n\nbut I also lie at the last gasp,\n\nMy face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl . . .\n\naway from me people retreat.\n\nAskers embody themselves in me, and I am embodied in them,\n\nI project my hat and sit shamefaced and beg.\n\nSince the subject of cholera is encompassed in the poem by a wider identification with other unfortunates, such as the imprisoned and street beggars, it is possible to see in these lines an oblique reference to the city's Irish, who in their poverty are embraced by the poem's persona as selflessly as are the cholera victims by Philip Marsh. Whitman's identification with the Irish poor may have stemmed from an early association with them in Brooklyn, where he and his family barely managed to remain above the level of poverty that obtained in the immigrant neighborhoods. Brooklyn's \"Irish Town\" was located near the navy yard, not far from where the Whitmans lived in the 1820s and where Walt's brother Jesse worked for a time. The family was still in Brooklyn in 1855 when the Irish made up Brooklyn's largest foreign-born element, numbering 56,753 out of a population of 205,250.10\n\nIn the 1850s when he was fashioning the all-encompassing poetic voice he believed America needed, Whitman experimented by assuming a fluid, flexible persona. Among the many tentative lines written in this manner in his notebook is one in which he directly associates that persona with the newly arrived Irish: \"The poor despised Irish girls and boys immigrants just over.\"11 New York was by then at a saturation point, having absorbed thousands of famine exiles in the preceding four years, and the newly arrived Irish were indeed poor and despised. The 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass, however, contained a direct reference to these immigrants that subtly reminded them that for all their troubles in America, they were still better off here than at home. The reference appears in the poem later titled \"The Sleepers,\" a marvelous evocation of sleep and its dreams, where the narrator is capable of entering the night visions of the sleepers whose dreams he describes. Among such visions are those in which \"ships make tacks in the dreams . . . the sailor sails . . . the exile returns home, / The fugitive returns unharmed,\" and \"the immigrant\" (suggesting the many songs of exile fashioned by the Irish in America) \"is back beyond months and years; / The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood, with the well-known neighbors and faces, / They warmly welcome him . . . he is barefoot again. . . . he forgets he is well off . . .\"12\n\nAs the immigrants were forced into ever tighter precincts the Irish neighborhoods of the midcentury became the worst slums of the city. In 1871, however, by which time the United States had absorbed, subsequent to the 1845 famine, some 2.5 million Irish emigrants, conditions had improved considerably for most of New York's Irish. They formed 21 percent of the city's population, and as a consequence of their numbers and their political aspirations, they had moved into the mainstream of its life. In fact, the Irish had become a potent force in what was still a workers' city. They had moved ahead in the workforce to become tailors, shoemakers, metalworkers, and masons, while still filling those roles they had earlier claimed as carters, coachmen, housemaids, longshoremen, and ferrymen. The city's largest union, the Laborers' Union Benevolent Society, was made up mostly of Irish members, and by the end of the 1860s nearly all the officers of New York's unions were Irish, either native or descendent.13 By 1872 the \"Tammany Tiger\" was headed by its first Irish Catholic leader, John Kelly, paving the way for the election in 1880 of New York's first Irish mayor, shipping magnate William Grace.\n\nThe years just prior to 1871 also had wrought some changes in Whitman's life, not all of them welcome. Most had been within his family structure. Thomas Jefferson Whitman, or Jeff, the brother to whom he had felt closest since their six-month sojourn in New Orleans in 1849, had moved to St. Louis with his wife and two daughters. There Mattie, Jeff's wife, had developed a persistent throat ailment from which she would die in 1873. Louisa Whitman, the poet's mother, widowed since 1855, was also beginning to show signs of poor health and of wearing down under the pressures of caring for her son, Edward, who had mental and physical disabilities, and worrying about the deteriorating mental health of another son, Jesse, her eldest.14 The child of yet another son, Andrew, who died in 1863, had been run over and killed by a cart while playing in the street, the result of his mother's drunken neglect.\n\nAs counter to these there were the upswings in Whitman's authorial life. Leaves of Grass had seen its fourth edition in 1867, and he continued to work on poems to be added to the next edition. Through the good offices of the publisher of the magazine Galaxy he had published two essays in 1867, \"Democracy\" and \"Personalism,\" which had been fused into the soon to be published Democratic Vistas (1871). In the same year he would produce Passage to India, the title poem of which is arguably the last of his great poems. Since the publication of some of his poems in England in 1868, he had become a focus of attention for a number of prominent figures there, among them a female admirer, Anne Gilchrist, who sent an impassioned marriage proposal he did not accept. In the summer of 1871 Edward Dowden, professor of English literature at Trinity College, Dublin, issued a significant essay, \"The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman,\" which reflected a growing admiration for the American bard among Irish literati. In 1871 he would also be hailed by the English poet Algernon Charles Swinburne and receive warm letters from that country's poet laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson.\n\nAlthough he had lived in Washington, D.C., since 1863, Whitman was still a son of \"Mannahatta\" and returned often to visit friends there and his mother in Brooklyn, as he did in 1871. New York, then as now, had a tendency to believe itself the center of the world, but Whitman would have been quite conscious of the fact that the District of Columbia had been provided for the first time with a form of territorial government. Other events that would not have escaped his attention in 1871 included the establishment of the first Civil Service Commission, though Congress, not able—until the assassination ten years later of President Garfield—to see the need to replace the spoils system, failed to continue its support; the organization of the country's first professional baseball association, displacing amateurs; and the fire in Chicago that destroyed an area of more than three square miles, consuming human lives and property including the original draft of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Of more immediate interest to the vacationing Whitman would have been some New York events of that summer: work on the bridge between the cities of Brooklyn and New York entered the second of its fourteen years; more than a hundred people were killed when a boiler exploded aboard the Westfield, a Staten Island ferry; and at least fifty people were killed in a riot involving Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants. All of these events would have impressed Walt Whitman, but we have his comments on only one, the Irish riot.\n\nOn June 20, 1871, Whitman returned to Brooklyn on his annual vacation from his position as clerk, third class, annual salary of sixteen hundred dollars, in the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C. Just three months earlier he had been declared dead by the New York World, which ran a lengthy obituary in the mistaken belief that he had been killed by a railroad train in Croton, New York. Though to one correspondent he claimed the false report kept him from \"hardly stir[ring] out in New York,\" it was really his mother's illness that kept him close to home.15 While in Brooklyn Whitman wrote regularly to his beloved friend in Washington, Peter Doyle, being careful to set Pete's mind at ease about his health by assuring the younger man that he was doing very little work and spending most of his time at home caring for his mother. When not with her, Walt told Pete, he was riding the ferry and visiting Coney Island. On Sunday, July 16, he even wrote a letter to Pete while on the sands of Coney Island, expressing the time-honored sentiment, \"Pete, I wish you were with me.\"16 Two days earlier he had written Doyle and another friend, the Irish American William Douglas O'Connor, news of quite a different sort, the murderous riot that took place July 12 in New York City at the annual parade of the city's Orangemen commemorating the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Both of the friends to whom he wrote were \"Irish\" (as Whitman used the term), and Whitman seems to have felt the particular need to share with them his feelings on the subject. To Pete he wrote:\n\nThere was quite a brush in N.Y. on Wednesday—the Irish lower orders (Catholic) had determined that the Orange parade (protestant) should be put down—mob fired & threw stones—military fired on mob—bet. 30 and 40 killed, over a hundred wounded—but you have seen all about it in papers—it was all up in a distant part of the city, 3 miles from Wall street—five-sixths of the city went on with its business just the same as any other day—I saw a big squad of prisoners carried along under guard—they reminded me of the squads of rebel prisoners brought in Washington, six years ago—.17\n\nWhitman wrote much the same thing to O'Connor, only emphasizing to him the peculiar manner in which so much of the life of a big city can go on unconcernedly while mobs riot and the police and militia kill.18\n\nThe riot in New York on that July day in 1871 was actually a repeat of what occurred at the previous year's Boyne Day. Orangemen, originally members of an Ulster Protestant Society in Ireland dating to 1795, were, in the United States, members of an ethnic organization whose principal activity was its annual celebration of the Battle of the Boyne. The 1870 observance had been given an extra boost by the fact that in May President Grant had declared the government would no longer tolerate the Irish Catholic Fenian Brotherhood functioning as a kind of separate government within the United States.19 Actually, it was an empty gesture, for the Fenians had ceased some years before to wield the force of numbers they had once commanded, but the Orangemen took it as a token of further Catholic defeat. On July 12 they had a procession up Eighth Avenue to a park located at Ninetieth Street, where a picnic and dance were to be held. One report credits twenty-five hundred men, women, and children with parading to tunes of \"Boyne Water,\" \"Derry,\" and others \"obnoxious to the Catholics.\"20 As it passed a road construction site where a large number of Irish were employed, the procession attracted unfavorable attention and was soon followed by the workers and other Irish Catholics. The Metropolitan Police were notified, but by the time they reached the park a shower of stones was falling on the Orange-men. A general melee followed, with clubs, sticks, and anything that could serve as a weapon being brought to bear. The militia were called, but by the time they arrived the injured were scattered about the streets. Groups from both sides of the combat tried to crowd into horsecars to escape, and as the fighting continued it brought wreckage to the cars and animals as well as to innocent passengers. Eight people died as a result, fifteen were wounded, and only six arrested; a subsequent investigation cast doubt on the willingness of the city's police to put down the rioters.21 New York's Irish waited to see what the following year would bring.\n\nAt the time, the New York Irish were as closely linked to the powerful Tweed Ring as any politically motivated ethnic group could hope to be. William M. Tweed was Grand Sachem of Tammany Hall, deputy street commissioner of New York City, and New York state senator. Peter Barr Sweeny, one of the original Ring organizers, was a Tammany sachem and city chamberlain, and Richard B. Connolly was the city comptroller. The Irish had been in America long enough to be able to see some of their number move up into the ranks of the well-to-do, and some even became Republicans. For example, in 1871 Edward Gleason, superintendent of the Union League Club, a highly respectable Republican political group, was able to build a house on 128th Street near Fifth Avenue. Though the location was considered \"in the country,\" the house was designed by the prestigious architects Calvert Vaux and Frederick Withers. Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted designed Central Park, and he and Withers had just completed the plan of the spacious estate Olana in Hudson, New York, for landscape artist Frederick Church.22\n\nDespite the evidence of economic gain, most of the city's Irish still toiled as laborers at low wages, competing always with the latest immigrants and with free blacks. Labor activism among Irish immigrants throughout the midcentury had focused mainly on improved wages, and this limited objective hampered any strides toward overall improvement of working conditions. In addition, Irish workers originally impeded their own progress by forming rival groups and secret societies whose memberships were determined by place of origin in Ireland.23 Only gradually did the idea of benevolent societies replace these secret organizations. Benevolent societies, forerunners of organized labor unions, had political and religious as well as occupational roots. In March 1846 Whitman wrote in the Eagle of a meeting of laborers held at Carroll Hall (a conservative Catholic political society often opposed to Tammany Hall) for the purpose of forming a benevolent society that would care for sick members and bury its dead, \"as well as to regulate the prices of work.\" One speaker who, Whitman says, addressed the gathering \"in very animated language\" was Michael F. O'Connor. A partial victory was claimed by reading aloud letters from contractors who had agreed to the demanded wage, among them Messrs. Collins, Brady, S. and P. O'Donnell, Quinn, and Burns. While Whitman makes no mention of this, note the Irish names of the contractors, who may have been Americans born to immigrant parents and who are indicative of entrepreneurial advancement possible in a labor-dominated economy that was beginning to break down, creating the need for unions.\n\nCraft workers, among whom the prefamine Irish immigrants numbered highly, were essential to the working class that developed in New York from the 1790s to the mid-nineteenth century. Whitman was part of this working class; because of his particular craft, printing, he was aware of the encroaching mechanization that would revolutionize the very character of work and create a new social and economic order based on what Sean Wilentz has labeled \"capitalist conceptions of wage labor as a market commodity,\" where the worker's labor was no longer his or her own.24 In the mid-1830s the city's unions had maintained that those workers who attained the status of journeymen had the right to determine the worth of their labor, which was said to be their own \"property.\"25 By the time Whitman was writing about unions in the Eagle, in 1846, unions represented not just the city's craftworkers but also laborers such as the stevedores and dock builders, where the influx of Irish was just beginning to be felt.\n\nIn his Eagle article Whitman warmly supported the organization of a benevolent society but denounced the attempt to regulate wages, which he saw as similar to tariffs, fair trade laws, and other such restrictions on business, to all of which he was opposed. He examined the case of the workers, however, and found it worthy of attention, pointing out that they labored from sunrise to dark for sixty-four and a half cents and were docked exorbitantly for being only minutes late. \"And,\" he exclaimed, \"many of these men have families of children to feed, and clothe, and educate—and potatoes are a dollar a bushel, and flour and beef unusually high! . . . Let our philanthropists not go to oppressed England and starving Ireland for samples of scanty comfort.\"26 A month later Whitman was not so sympathetic. He editorialized that the new Laborers' Association had not only set its own prices and hours but the men now refused to work unless all were employed, which, he says, the city's requirements did not at the time justify. He regretted that the laborers were \"going to the very excess of injustice which they complained of in their own former employers.\"27\n\nThe following day the editor reported that several of those in the association had called upon him and made him realize he had not done its members justice, for they were in fact ready to receive any work when available. One supposes that the contingent of workers with whom he met included more than a few Irish, for Whitman went on to a lengthy discussion of the condition of Irish laborers. Whigs and nativists, he claimed, say the Irish are a \"low ignorant set\" who do not belong in the country. He argued that though they were ignorant in \"book-lore\" and \"perhaps uncouth in manners,\" they had come here \"pining and panting for a new and better home\" and were opposed to \"all kinds of tyranny.\" Largely because of this last-named quality, Whitman professed to have felt great pride when in a political meeting he had seen \"a mortar-stained laborer coolly taking his prominent part in the proceedings.\" He thought he was witnessing \"the budding in a fellow creature's long darkened breast, of the seeds of freedom, and of a knowledge of his own rights.\" There is, Whitman claimed, a glory to such a dawning \"even in the despised hod-carrier.\"28\n\nThe same spring of 1846 brought a strike at Brooklyn's Atlantic Dock by Irish dock construction workers seeking higher pay. There was violence, especially when the construction firm brought in German workers to replace the striking Irish. In the Eagle Whitman claimed the disturbances were not caused by Brooklyn workers but by \"blustering rowdies\" from New York \"who seize every occasion to fan the flames of riot.\"29 Late in his life Whitman claimed to have been familiar with the dockworkers, \"the Be-Jesus boys,\" he called them, \"in New York—stevedores on the wharves: I am soft for them, too—the real genuine fellows: but there's a rough gang, set, in New York . . . a dangerous gang.\"30 Dangerous they no doubt were, and the violence of their strikes was far from Whitman's vision of comradely workers. In the Atlantic Dock strike German workers were attacked and badly beaten, for which a number of Irish were indicted. The indictments broke the strike, and though many of the Irish returned to their jobs, the workforce was carefully set at half Irish, half German, which meant that many Irish workers lost jobs. Most devastating, however, there was no increase in salary for the laborers on land, who were mostly Irish, while the dredgemen, all Germans, received an increase of five cents an hour, bringing their hourly rate to eighty-five cents, five cents more than the Irish were paid.31\n\nIn editorializing on the worst aspects of the dock strike Whitman pointed out that, \"with all their faults, the Irish are a warm-hearted people.\" He then told of a striking Irishman who found some forty or so non-English-speaking Germans (scabs called in to replace the strikers) who had finished work but were fearful of crossing the picket line to get to the ferry and return home to New York. The Irishman took the Germans to the boat and saw them safely across the river, where, with no common language in which to do so, they made every effort to convey to him their gratitude.32\n\nConsideration of this type did not extend to black workers, however; the Longshoremen's United Benevolent Society, formed in 1852, operated exclusively for the Irish dockworkers but proclaimed its willingness to accept any white workers it deemed worthy of working the docks. The key word here is \"white,\" for in 1850 the Irish dockworkers had gone on strike to force the firing of a black worker. Subsequent strikes, in 1852, 1855, 1862, and 1863, though undertaken for higher wages, also involved violence aimed at black workers brought in to replace the strikers.33\n\nOn principle, in the 1840s and 1850s Whitman did not support the idea of organized labor, which he saw as an attempt to interfere with business and manufacturing. There was always the hope, however, that the narrowness of focus that shaped the views of most immigrants would expand under the influence of democracy. About 1856 Whitman noted to himself what he believed to be the \"Gist\" of his work: \"To give others, readers, people, the materials to decide for themselves, and know, or grow toward knowing, with cleanliness and strength.\"34 Below this he lists a number of New York newspapers and their street addresses, perhaps with a view of finding in at least some of them outlets for his proposed educational program. The only ethnic paper on the list is the Irish-American, at 116 Nassau Street, and while there is no direct evidence that Whitman actually published in it, the paper was the one Irish newspaper in New York that would have welcomed such a liberal approach.35\n\nThe Irish-American began publication in New York in the summer of 1849; its owner and editor was Patrick Lynch, former editor of the Boston Irish Catholic newspaper, the Pilot. In Boston Lynch had used his paper to support revolutionary movements in Europe and repeal of the enforced union of England and Ireland. These positions made him unpopular with the Roman Catholic hierarchy of Boston, who feared seeing their people in the States thrust into dangerous situations if they adopted Lynch's views. Lynch learned from his experience, and in moving to New York to begin publication of the Irish-American, he made an effort to reconcile Irish American republicanism and Roman Catholic interests. In the first issue of the paper he indicated he would support democratic-republican principles but would not forsake Catholicism, and in later editorials he scrupulously defended the honor of the Church.36 Nevertheless, Lynch's republican tendencies were strong, and though his newspaper bore on its masthead the motto \"neutral in religion and politics,\" it was not long before it clearly demonstrated its editor's leanings. These sympathies may have led Whitman to see the paper as a possible outlet for his own democratic proselytizing, a way of placing in the hands of its readers \"the materials to decide for themselves\" and thus hasten the democratization of the Irish in America.\n\nThe process of democratization, Whitman knew, had begun long before among the Irish Protestants who had arrived in the States earlier. It could continue among the more recent Catholic arrivals, he believed, if the influence of their priests could be overcome. The Irish had started coming to North America before that continent boasted a free and independent nation. The first to arrive were mostly Protestants—Ulster-Scots who were Presbyterian (Andrew Jackson's parents were among these) and others who were Church of Ireland or Anglican. Many proved themselves valiant in both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. A slow but steady immigration rate continued, with an upsurge early in the 1840s that seemed to signal the spiraling rate of increase that would follow the famines in Ireland. Among those who came in the years of a declining economy in the southern counties of Ireland, immediately preceding the famine, were Catholics who then found themselves at odds with the already established Protestant Irish when such issues arose as the controversial move to fund parochial schools with public tax monies. The famine, of course, brought the great waves of Catholic immigration. In the years between 1847 and 1851, 848,000 Irish entered New York City's port. So many of them remained in the city that in 1860 New York was the most Irish city in the United States, with the Irish population totaling some 200,000 out of a total population of 800,000.37\n\nCensus figures for 1870 show a New York City Irish-born population of 201,999.38 At that time roughly 75 percent of New York's Irish voted Democratic (the remainder, Protestants for the most part, made up the Irish wing of the city's Republican Party), though there was some discontent that the Democrats did not see fit to run an Irish candidate for mayor.39 Nonetheless, the Irish vote in New York (11 percent of the state's total population and 21 percent of the city's) was strong enough to secure the elections in 1870 of Democrats A. Oakey Hall as mayor and John T. Hoffman as governor.40\n\nThe Irish had played a vital role in shifting the political power base away from Albany and toward New York City. The earliest Irish immigrants found their way into whichever of the parties suited their political philosophy, but as the immigrant population increased and especially as it became clear that the immigrants intended to remain in the city, they were viewed by the Democratic Party as a means of gaining power through sheer force of numbers. This brought the Irish into the rivalry between upstate and downstate politicians in which Albany Whigs, later Republicans, sought to keep the city submissive to the state government. Already highly politicized when they arrived in America because of their own country's forced subservience to England, the New York Irish allied with the Democrats, who were fighting to gain control of city politics. When the doors to the Tammany Society and the Democratic Party were opened to them they entered in great numbers, eventually finding their way, by 1870, to Albany. For some years William Tweed wielded great power in the state legislature. Of its fewer than thirty members, nine were native Irishmen, the parents of another eight had been born in Ireland, and three had other Irish family connections.41\n\nTweed's power extended into the streets of the city, where his Irish backers formed the largest group of municipal workers. In 1871 Tweed introduced in the state legislature a new charter for New York City which was opposed by a group of anti-Irish dissidents calling themselves the \"Young Democrats.\" Hoping to curb Tweed's control of the party, the group planned a coup. With the help of the Metropolitan Police, however, Tweed was able to prevent the meeting at which the takeover was to occur, an indication not only of his influence on the police force but of the large number of Irish who marched in its ranks. Other powerful forces were at work as well, led by wealthy reformers who, stimulated to action by disclosures in the Republican New York Times of massive fraud and financial misdealings within the city government, now sought to oust Tweed and restore fiscal responsibility. Unfortunately, any threat to Tweed was seen by the Irish political bloc as a threat to them.\n\nBy the time the July 1871 observance of the Battle of the Boyne arrived, the city's Irish were already roiling. In January their rival political factions, Catholic and Protestant, had vied for the honor of welcoming five Fenian prisoners recently released from English jails. Among the five were Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, who within a few years would command the distinction of being Ireland's most public, and most radical, exile, and John Devoy, the lifelong Irish freedom fighter. Devoy was a longtime associate of another exiled Fenian, John Boyle O'Reilly. The city's contending Irish sectarians were each eager to convey the rebels to the parade and festivities that awaited them. So fierce was the competition between the Tammany Catholics and the Orangemen that the exiles, who were interested only in gaining support for Ireland's cause, eschewed all convoys, turned away offers of swank hotels to stay at the less prestigious Sweeney's Hotel, and publicly chastised the New York Irish for their disunion.42\n\nSpring brought its own troubles. In May there had been labor unrest, with Irish workers striking for pay increases. By July the city's Irish on both sides of the religious fence were smarting with the memory of the previous year's riot. The Catholics sought to have the mayor issue an order restraining the Orangemen from parading, but Hall chose to hide behind his superintendent of police and had him issue the ban. This cowardliness, as well as the ban itself, stirred the non-Irish of the city to public outcry. In an effort to quiet things, Governor Hoffman issued a proclamation sanctioning the observance. Resentment at this edict coming from the governor they had elected spilled over into the streets as gangs of Irish laborers set upon the marchers with results much as Whitman described them. At the height of the riot, with the procession of Orangemen determinedly advancing on their tormenters, a shot was fired from a nearby window, and the militia of the Eighty-fourth Regiment, called out by the governor, fired into the crowd killing and injuring scores of people. The count of dead and injured on this one July day was in the neighborhood of 165.43 It was, the Times said, \"a day never to be forgotten in the history of the City of New-York.\" Certainly it was a day to arouse memories of the previous decade's draft riot, another stain on the city's history in which the Irish had figured prominently. One account of the Orange Riots, published in 1873, evoked the draft riot by way of praising \"the almost universal faithfulness of the Roman Catholic Irish police to their duty. In this [the Boyne Day riot], as well as in the draft riots, they have left a record of which any city might be proud.\"44\n\nSuch praise was a tribute to the members of a largely Irish police force that all but owed its existence to the need, real or perceived, to hold in check the city's Irish. In nineteenth-century New York, street riots were a form of public exhibition, an \"acting out\" of frustration and grievance and so much a part of the cityscape that Whitman includes \"the fury of roused mobs\" in his descant on the city in \"Song of Myself.\" Riots, along with increased crime, created a need for a fully staffed municipal police force to replace the system of part-time wardens and watchers considered sufficient early in the century. For a time, after the police force was established, members of the city's governing body, the Common Council, were allowed to appoint men to serve two-year terms as police officers, thus initiating a political connection to law enforcement not easily corrected. In 1845 the Democrats then in power brought into existence a force of eight hundred paid police; by 1856 the city's \"Civic Army,\" as it was called, numbered twelve hundred, but, fearful of such an army in their midst, citizens insisted they be unarmed and without uniforms.45 Uniforms were introduced soon after, however, in the hope they would command respect from the roughs of the city. With the Democratic Party's continued hold on city politics, jobs on the police force became a part of the party's patronage offered most often to the Irish on whose support the party relied. Though there were times when they were accused of favoring their own, over the years the Irish police came to win the respect of most of the city's citizens.\n\nWhitman, too, was impressed by New York's police and their actions in the Orange Riots. He wrote to Peter Doyle:\n\nThe N. Y. police looked & behaved splendidly—no fuss, few words, but action—great, brown, bearded, able, American looking fellows, (Irish stock, though, many of them)—I had great pleasure in looking on them—something new, to me, it quite set me up to see such chaps, all dusty & worn, looked like veterans—46\n\nSimilarly, to William O'Connor he commented:\n\nthe Policemen looked & behaved splendidly—I have been looking on them & been with them much, & am refreshed by their presence—it is something new—in some respects they afford the most encouraging sign I have got—brown, bearded, worn, resolute, American-looking men, dusty & sweaty—looked like veterans—the stock here even in these cities is in the main magnificent—the heads either shysters, villains or impotents—.47\n\nWhitman appears to have been looking at the police from a dual perspective, both of which aided his newly acquired respect. For one thing, he associates them with veterans of the Civil War, a group he held in the highest regard and personal affection. In so doing, he sees, perhaps for the first time, beyond their ethnic \"stock,\" viewing them not as Irishmen but as Americans—or at least as \"American-looking.\"48 From the vantage point of this new regard, he can clearly delineate them from the scurrilous politicians at whose behest they function. Indeed, most New Yorkers were beginning to see those at the head of the city's political organization, the Tweed Ring, in the same light as Whitman does here, as villains. Perhaps the only good thing to come out of the Orange Riots of 1870 and 1871 was the way in which they hastened a public recognition of rampant political infamy so that, amid mounting evidence of fraud and corruption, 1871 saw the end of the Tweed Ring and its hold on the city's politics.\n\nWhat we cannot fail to notice in Whitman's account is the personal reaction he registers, the pleasure he derives from observing the police, an emotion which is \"something new to me,\" he says. If we connect this to his comment on their \"stock,\" an obvious reference to their Irish roots, we recognize an admission of a change of mind, perhaps even of heart, about the presumed character of these Irishmen.\n\nThe question of character was a subject on which most nineteenth-century New Yorkers held opinions, since character and its national determination had come very much to the foreground of public discourse, largely as the result of the great influx of Irish. At the time of Whitman's letters, the individual who most fully epitomized the adverse image of the Irish politician as possessed of incorrigibly low character was one of the villains to whom Whitman obliquely refers, Irish-born Richard Barrett Connolly, known as \"Slippery Dick,\" who came to America in 1826 and rose to become comptroller of New York City in the years 1867 to 1871. Connolly was the principal factor in the downfall of the Tweed Ring because of financial malfeasance from which he personally profited, to the tune of some six million dollars he is believed to have taken with him when he fled the country to avoid a jail sentence. Amid the general blatancy of the Ring members' wrongdoing, Connolly stood out for what was described as his low cunning, his greed, and the way in which he had distinguished himself in the course of his political rise by a shrewd use of his ethnicity to further his career.49\n\nConnolly moved through the ranks, keeping pace with the political advancements being made by New York's Irish. In 1839 he was elected to the Tammany Society and worked his way up. He latched on to the campaign of the former Democratic United States Senator Fernando Wood when Wood sought Irish support for his bid for mayor of New York in 1854. So fully was Connolly later identified with the city's Irish that when Whitman wrote his 1871 letter to O'Connor, contrasting the upright behavior of the New York police with the chicanery of their leaders, he may well have had in mind the Irish-born Connolly. Whitman wrote his letter on July 14, just six days after the New York Times (its owner having refused a bribe from Boss Tweed not to publish) had begun printing the full record of Connolly's impropriety.\n\nWhitman's improved perception of Irish police may also have been helped by his deep attachment to Peter Doyle and his family. Pete's brother, Francis, was a police officer in Washington, D.C. In May 1871, before leaving Washington for New York, Whitman had prepared an editorial defending Francis Doyle against newspaper claims of brutality in the arrest of a young boy on theft charges. Evidently the newspaper had taken up the case as something of a cause, for Whitman refers to a persistence in reportage that \"amounts to persecution.\" The reprimand by Doyle's superiors is enough, he claimed, to bring the matter to an end, but Whitman could not resist adding his own admonition, that the attempt to make \"martyrs and heroes of the steadily increasing swarms of juvenile thieves and vagabonds who infest the streets of Washington\" is a disservice to the citizenry. As to Francis Doyle, he is described as \"a little stern perhaps\" but the bearer of \"an excellent reputation\" who \"served the Union cause, as soldier or sailor, all through the war.\"50 The article remained in Whitman's notebook, unpublished, perhaps at the request of the officer himself or of his family, who may have wished to avoid exacerbating the situation. Before the year was out Francis Doyle was dead of a gunshot wound inflicted by Maria Shea (known as the \"Queen of Louse Alley\") when he attempted to recover articles she had stolen. Whitman attended Doyle's funeral on New Year's Eve 1871 and must have found it a sad ending to a year that had seen the Irish caught up in too many instances of violence in American streets.51\n\nThe larger issue in the Whitman letters is his changed attitude toward the Irish in general. No longer the \"coarse, blustering rowdies,\" as he described the union organizers he had once condemned, the Irish had come to mean to him such beloved friends as Peter Doyle and William Douglas O'Connor. If the events of that year moved Whitman to recall earlier ones involving New York's Irish, he could not have failed to note the distance he had covered in his personal reactions to this immigrant group. It was a leap shared by many Americans, for whom the Civil War and the heroic participation of thousands of Irish-born immigrants proved a turning point in attitudes. But despite his changed attitude, there is little reason to believe Whitman would not have continued to justify his intent, if not his rhetoric, in the New York Aurora in 1842 when he publicly reviled the Irish and took on no less a figure than the Reverend John Hughes, bishop (later the first archbishop) of New York. His intention would have been the same in 1871, for the one constant in Whitman's attitude toward the Irish is revealed in his description to Peter Doyle of a segment of the Boyne Day rioting, \"the Irish lower orders (catholic).\" It was their allegiance to Roman Catholicism, rather than the Irish themselves, that Whitman could not accept, for he viewed their church not only as undemocratic but as antidemocratic. When he could dissociate the Irish from their religion he found much about them to his liking, even identifying his poetic persona with them in Leaves of Grass. Privately, as in the cases of Doyle and O'Connor, he could love them above all others. But an Irish friend's Catholicism could remain a stumbling block, so much so that, as shall be seen in the case of John Boyle O'Reilly, Whitman felt forced to deny its existence.\n\nWhitman's furious and unguarded attack on New York's Catholic Irish in 1842 might be offered as evidence of strong anti-Irish feelings had it not occurred when he was still quite young and opinionated, if it did not also suggest the matter was part of the ongoing viciousness common to the city's newspaper business, and, most significantly, if it did not reveal cultural influences he could hardly be expected to have withstood. Recent verifications of Whitman's journalism and the availability of the full texts of his Aurora editorials are helpful in understanding the matter.52 Coupled with a historical background on the public school issue and placed within a biographical framework, they allow a more complete narrative to emerge.\n\nWhen the twenty-three-year-old Whitman joined the staff of the Aurora in 1842, first as the writer of a series of articles and then as editor, the two-penny daily was one of many newspapers produced in New York City. Among the others were such popular papers as James Gordon Bennett's Herald and a relative newcomer, Horace Greeley's Tribune. Most of the newspapers of the time aligned themselves with a political party, and the Aurora was mildly Democratic, though it concentrated more on the city's social scene than on its politics. As editor, Whitman would alter this. He was no novice to the field, having already racked up at least ten years' experience on Long Island papers—the Patriot, a Democratic organ; the Whig Star; and the self-proclaimed Democrat. For one year, 1838–1839, he was owner, editor, and printer of his own paper, the Long Islander, produced near his birthplace in Huntington. In Manhattan he had worked on weeklies, Park Benjamin's New World and the somewhat idiosyncratically named Brother Jonathan. The jingoistic but literarily discriminating Democratic Review, owned by John Louis O'Sullivan, published some of Whitman's early short stories and poetry. In his late years Whitman recalled O'Sullivan as \"a handsome, generous fellow. He treated me well.\"53 To be treated well in the rough and tumble world of New York journalism of the time was not a small matter, but neither was Whitman's move into the heady atmosphere of the democratic crusade spearheaded by O'Sullivan and the Democratic Review.\n\nJohn L. O'Sullivan was not typical of any of the Irish who came to America either in the prefamine or the famine years. While most Irishmen who arrived in the decade he did, the 1820s, were Ulster Protestants who fell into the broad category of artisans and craftworkers, the O'Sullivan family could boast an assortment of men who made their living and their mark as soldiers and rebels, fighting in various European countries (most often on the losing side) generally, though not always, in opposition to England. John Louis was born on a British warship off the coast of Gibraltar in 1813 and was brought to New York in 1827. Though baptized a Catholic, he was an Episcopalian for most of his life, before returning to the Catholicism of his family.54\n\nO'Sullivan's true religion was democracy, which he believed was the future of all countries and the world's most needed form of political advance. Despite his own scholarly achievements, he eschewed the fields of teaching and the law to enter the world of newspaper and magazine writing. Early work in New York City led to the launching of a paper in Washington, D.C., in 1835. O'Sullivan decided to use its location in the nation's capital and its favored position with the newly elected Martin Van Buren to turn it into a national journal of literature and politics intended to further the advance of democracy and of the Democratic Party. O'Sullivan quickly gathered into his fold some of the country's outstanding writers and thinkers by promising them a truly democratic forum in which they might express any political idea, while he as editor would uphold the party line. In practice, the latter consideration pretty much limited the published materials to those written from a Democratic perspective, but the magazine also had a strong literary goal, which was to present the very best that a democratic society could offer. While the New England writers, with the exception of Nathaniel Hawthorne, generally sniffed at his invitation to write for the Review, O'Sullivan was really interested in the kinds of materials that were more likely to emanate from such democratic—and Democratic—centers as New York City. In 1841 he moved the Democratic Review to Manhattan. By then he was a member of the New York state legislature, and the magazine's ties to the Democratic Party were stronger than ever.\n\nIn addition to the party's aims, O'Sullivan hoped to advance those of the Young America movement, which in these, its early years, were principally literary and cultural. Young America had no real connection to the Young Ireland movement of the 1840s, but it shared a common nationalistic fervor, which in Ireland, of course, took the form of promoting Irish culture over the claims of the dominant English culture. O'Sullivan and the Young America group promoted the development of an American culture that would reflect the working-class interests and attitudes most evident in cities such as New York. Small wonder that Whitman felt himself to have been well treated by O'Sullivan, for Whitman's social, cultural, and political views accorded with his. In fact, Whitman's first entry in the Democratic Review, \"Death in the School-Room (A Fact)\" in 1841, not only denounced corporal punishment of children but probably also was intended to support O'Sullivan's stand in the state legislature against capital punishment.\n\nWhitman had already been initiated into the turbulent world of politics, both through his experiences with newspapers that served as party organs and via his own involvement as an appointed Democratic electioneer on behalf of Van Buren. In the 1840 presidential campaign he took part in political debates and gave speeches for the party and its candidate, achieving some local recognition though his oratorical skills were somewhat lacking.55 He was also quite familiar with Tammany Hall and its political objectives. The Tammany Society, originally a fraternal group named for a Native American chieftain, had its origins in late-eighteenth-century Enlightenment ideals, which quickly became Jeffersonian principles. Its benevolence toward the indigent and the working poor of the city led to support from that quarter for Tammany's later political aspirations. In the 1820s the society offered membership to the Irish, and a decade later they and it were dedicated Democrats. By 1840, when the society supported Van Buren for president, its political influence reached deep and wide in the city, where it had become synonymous with the Democratic Party. Whitman's electioneering for Van Buren in that campaign brought him into close contact with Tammany. In 1877 he remembered learning much about Thomas Paine from a personal acquaintance of the great infidel, Tammany member Colonel John Fellows. It was, he recalled, \"some thirty-five years ago, in New York city, at Tammany hall, of which place I was then a frequenter.\"56 That would have been around 1842, about the same time he went to the Aurora. By then Whitman's philosophical and political ideas had been shaped by an early exposure, via his father's liberalism, to such socialistic and anticlerical reformers as Robert Owen and Frances Wright. His later absorption of firsthand accounts of one of his father's heroes, Thomas Paine, well may have served to fuel the anger evident in his Aurora editorials when Irish Catholics became a dominating influence on Tammany and the Democratic Party. At the time, Catholicism was antithetical to those who believed, as did Whitman and his father, in individual liberty and freedom of thought.\n\nGiven his political background, it is not surprising that the new editor of the Aurora would move the paper into the political sphere. Nor is it surprising that the issue that would capture his attention strong opinions on the subject. His role as schoolteacher had come about not by his own choosing. When the great fire of August 1835 swept through the printing district of New York, only two of the city's six large morning newspapers survived the flames. Along with the print houses and newspapers lost in the fire went the jobs of many, like Whitman, who were employed within its precincts. Having attained the position of printer only a short time earlier in that year, Whitman's was a case of last hired, first to go, and he had reluctantly turned to schoolteaching. It was an alternative he preferred to working with his housewright father, but it thrust him back to Long Island which, after his years of city life, he found irritating. Letters to a sympathetic friend describing his torments at Woodbury, Long Island, in the years 1840 and 1841, though written partly in jest, reveal his dissatisfaction with life as a country school teacher forced to sleep in the homes of his pupils and partake of such rural pleasures as \"huckleberry pic-nics.\"57 Despite this dissatisfaction, Whitman took seriously the whole subject of education and later wrote articles and editorials advocating better education of teachers and improved methods of instruction. His very popular short story \"Death in the School-Room (A Fact)\" was written while he was teaching on Long Island, the year before his involvement in the Bishop Hughes school affair.58\n\nWhile Whitman was still teaching on Long Island in 1840, New York City's Bishop John Hughes approached the city's Public School Society seeking funds for Catholic schools. The society was a private philanthropic agency instituted in 1805 to administer school funds drawn from the state budget and allocated by the city's Common Council. Since the hundred or so city schools were not part of the state's district school system, the society was also charged with providing general supervision of the city's schools. Attendance at city schools was not mandated by law, which meant that thousands of children did not attend any school and thus received no education. When the bishop informed the Whig governor William Seward that many Catholic children were kept from school or were sent to church schools by parents who saw it as a matter of conscience, the governor was genuinely, as well as politically, motivated to do something. He proposed reforms that would make the city's schools, including the eight church-funded Catholic schools educating approximately three thousand children, part of the state system and allow for the establishment of additional public schools that would satisfy the desires of Catholic parents.59\n\nThe reason why many Catholic parents felt conscience bound to keep their children from the public schools had to do with the generally accepted Protestant culture that permeated the schools, including hymns, readings without interpretation from the King James Bible (Catholics believed the Scriptures needed to be interpreted by clergy), textbooks that presented history from a Protestant viewpoint, and many teachers and supervisors who looked down upon their \"unenlightened\" Catholic charges. Perhaps the most blatantly offensive textbook was the widely employed The Irish Heart which, using poor imitations of an Irish brogue, presented Irish characters who in every way justified the claim of the book's preface: Irish emigration was making America \"the common sewer of Ireland.\"60\n\nSince the Irish made up the city's dominant Roman Catholic group and had the formidable Bishop Hughes as their leader, they became the center of the storm of protest that developed over the school fund issue. The protest began when, on the strength of the governor's proposals, Hughes went to the Common Council seeking funding for his schools. The Democratic-controlled council reacted by accusing Seward of trying to win Irish Catholic votes, which, through Tammany Hall, the Democrats were able to command. While the council considered Hughes's request, the Presbyterian Church and the Jewish community let the council know that they, too, would be looking for their share of the public funds; they were soon followed by the Baptists, Methodist Episcopalians, and Dutch Reformed. With this kind of stimulus, the council took a hard look at earlier state legislation (specifically the 1824 law nullifying the 1813 statute that had allowed sectarian schools to partake of public funds) before denying the Catholic request in January 1841. It concluded that Catholics had a right to send their children to Catholic schools, but Catholic schools did not have a right to public funds. At this Hughes went into high gear, issuing letters to the general public in which he argued the Catholic position and using the pages of the Catholic weekly newspaper, the New York Freeman's Journal, to advance his cause.\n\nIrish-born John Hughes, who became bishop of New York in 1842, was not a careful and reasoned contender but an emotional one, and he saw injustice to his parishoners in this and many other aspects of the city's political life. His response to the council's decision was that since the state legislature had given the council and, through the council, the Public School Society, the right to administer state funds, only the legislature could rule on the matter. Hughes was counting on Seward to wield influence in Albany.\n\nThe Catholics presented their petition to the legislature, which turned it over to the state's highest educational officer, John C. Spencer. Spencer eventually recommended that the state district school system be extended to include New York City. Under this plan the districts would choose their own representatives to administer the district school, thus ethnic and religious concerns would be addressed on a local level. Hughes was delighted with this recommendation. It was submitted to the legislature for action but was delayed largely because of complaints from the Public School Society, which feared its own imminent demise under the new system. The nativists also began to rumble their displeasure, and with what seemed like a strong negative reaction to the proposal—and with an election looming in November—both the Whig and Democratic parties turned against the Catholics. Hughes took a desperate measure and offered a slate of independent candidates under the banner of Carroll Hall. His aim was really to push the Democrats into endorsing the Catholic position on the school issue, but they failed to give in. As a result, the Carroll Hall candidates, all of whom were elected, split the Democratic vote, allowing the Whigs to take City Hall. Only those Democrats who had not had Catholic backing were defeated, which proved Hughes's point to the party. At the state level the Whigs lost control of both houses as well as numerous other posts and began to fear both the power of Hughes's leadership and the Catholic vote.\n\nThe Democrats were equally fearful of losing the Catholics, and the Democratic majority in the state legislature soon was ready to pass whatever school bill would placate them. Seward first proposed Spencer's plan but, seeking a compromise, altered it to provide for the continuation of the Public School Society. Hughes gathered over twelve thousand signatures on a petition backing the governor's plan and presented it to the State Assembly in January 1842. The Public School Society, still fighting to retain control, asked for a delay and for an investigatory committee of state and city education officials. The committee, under the leadership of Assemblyman William Maclay, reported to the assembly that the Public School Society was not doing a good job of educating children, or of gaining the trust of parents, or of handling school funds. The assembly then engaged in a general debate of the bill and began writing rules of organization by which the new district schools would operate. March 1842 was the crucial time when New York City was engulfed in turmoil over this matter, and it was then the new editor of the Aurora entered the picture.\n\nWhitman began by pointing out his familiarity and experience with the state district schools; he also claimed to have over the previous six months visited every public school in the city. He promised that the Aurora's position would be based on \"wholesome judgement of the city's truest advantage.\"61 The paper's position proved to be squarely in favor of the Public School Society, which the editor claimed was educating all the city's children with no prejudice. He provided details of enrollments in various schools, including percentages of Catholic students, adding that there were many Catholic teachers. The following week Whitman began his attack on Bishop Hughes: the petitions Hughes had garnered did not contain legitimate signatures; on his instructions Catholics kept their children out of school when state officials visited in order to support his case; and, getting to the heart of the matter, \"this cunning, flexible, serpent tongued priest has had the insolence to appear in the political forum.\"62 Whitman continued to write editorials on the subject, questioning the wisdom of the state legislators who he claimed lacked experience to judge the matter, insisting that Hughes controlled Catholic politicians by the threat of excommunication, blaming priests for stirring up Catholic parents who were otherwise satisfied with the schools, and pointing out the intelligence and decorum of female students at a public school in Five Points, one of the worst Irish neighborhoods.\n\nOn St. Patrick's Day his editorial was headed, \"Insult to American Citizenship!\" It dealt with a rally held at City Hall Park the day before by supporters of the Public School Society and claimed the rally was overrun by its opponents using the rowdiest of mob tactics. Whitman describes them as \"foreigners,\" \"filthy wretches,\" \"blear-eyed and bloated offscourings from the stews, blind alleys and rear lanes,\" who broke up the meeting with \"howlings in their hideous native tongue.\" Priests were there, he says, \"sly, false, deceitful villains\" who encouraged the mob. He calls on citizens to rise up against the \"hypocritical scoundrel Hughes, and his minions.\"63 The following day Whitman published extracts from a letter he had received that defended Hughes, but he claimed his paper would continue to fight religious \"fanaticism.\"64\n\nWith this diatribe Whitman had moved dangerously close to the position of the Native American Party, though when charged with this he protested it was not so. As he would later do on the question of slavery, Whitman tried to find a midpoint between what he saw as the extremes of nativism and a surrender to the demands of \"foreigners\" in the country's midst. Just four years later, in June 1846, he would editorialize in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle against the antiforeigner position of the Native American Party by pointing out the simple facts of available land in \"the New World\" as opposed to the old. Then, using Ireland to make his point,\n\nThere is too much mankind, and too little earth.—What horrors are every month to be seen in Ireland from Bantry Bay to the Giant's Causeway! What wretchedness in the hovels of the poor peasants! What grief and hunger have reigned among her people ever since Castlereagh [Viscount Robert Stewart] and Pitt [British prime minister] consummated the atrocity of \"the Union!\"65\n\nOn March 24, 1842, however, his Aurora editorial began to widen the focus of his attack in ways that need to be taken into consideration. He points out the bind in which Tammany finds itself for its heavy reliance on the Irish vote, which now places Tammany in Hughes's hands. He also attacks the party organ, the New Era, and its editor, Levi Slamm, for having gone over to the side of the Catholics.\n\nWith this piece Whitman appears to have begun a not-so-subtle campaign to discredit the New Era and, by suggesting the need for a \"truly American\" paper to represent the party, to posit the Aurora as a suitable replacement.66 Whitman's attention to the school bill had been dwindling because for a time it appeared the bill would not become law. Instead, he stepped up his attack on the New Era, claiming it hoped to dictate to the Democratic Party its own support of foreigners, \"a large portion of whom are now in open rebellion.\" Later in the month he would remind his readers of the party's already expressed dissatisfaction with its journalistic organ and asserted the Democratic Party will \"never\" be ruled by \"foreign priests\" and the New Era.67 On March 29 he reviewed \"The New York Press,\" evaluating each newspaper, and proclaimed the Aurora \"by far the best newspaper in the town.\" Obviously hoping to displace the New Era, on the following day Whitman offered a definition of his paper's position relative to nativism, a position he no doubt believed would bring it into line with the Democratic Party. Claiming it is not \"antiforeigners,\" the paper is, he says, pro-America in that it sees this republic as possessing the capacities for solving the problem of how far humans can evolve in self-perfection and self-government.68 This definition, really of his own beliefs, is not to be discounted, for it reveals a genuine concern of Whitman's that remained with him throughout his life.\n\nWith an April 12 election looming that involved all the seats on the city's Common Council, the Democrats held an inconclusive strategy meeting at Tammany Hall on April 5. The next day Whitman implored the party not to follow the dictates of the New Era and its Irish Catholic cohorts but to stand by its democratic principles.69 Hughes, however, was not waiting for the party to make up its mind. Once again he declared an independent Carroll Hall ticket of nominees for city offices but conceded the ticket would be withdrawn if the Maclay bill was passed. Whitman pleaded in the Aurora with the state Democrats to stand firm against these tactics, but the party was too fearful of losing the city's Irish vote to heed such pleas. After numerous amendments the legislature passed a school bill that did not allow public funding of religious schools but did proscribe all sectarianism in the public schools and made the city schools part of the state system with a board of education to oversee them. The school bill was passed (by a vote of 13 to 12 when New York City Democratic Senator John Scott, who opposed it, deliberately avoided the roll call), and the Carroll Hill candidates returned to the Democratic fold. The Aurora editor was so disgusted by his party's capitulation that he strongly urged Democrats not to vote for either party in the city election. Robert Morris, the Democratic mayor, was reelected, and the Whigs, who gained control of the Common Council, joined forces with the Native American Party to urge a repeal of the new school law. Whitman vented his fury crying, \"Has it come to be, that Irishman is a better title to office, here, than American?\" He warned that the Catholics would continue to press their advantage, which Tammany, having gone this far, would not be able to withstand.70 His final word on the subject was titled \"Americanism,\" where he firmly repudiated the doctrines of the Native American Party but confessed a desire to see Americans remain free of foreign influences whether from within or without the country.71\n\nWhile Whitman's attacks on Bishop Hughes and Irish Catholics are highly offensive to readers today, they were exceeded by editors in other city papers, especially by James Gordon Bennett of the Herald, who engaged in personal vituperation bordering on mania and who believed Hughes was attempting to organize an Irish political party. The highly respected Evening Post warned Catholics against \"priestly influence in the sphere of politics,\" and the Whig Tribune branded the actions of the Catholics \"cowardice, insult and treachery.\"72 All of these papers and their editors, including Whitman, were deeply concerned for a basic principle of democracy at stake in this issue, the separation of church and state, which they believed would have been compromised by the use of public funds to teach religion in the schools.73 The matter of \"priestly influence in the sphere of politics\" was one that Americans eventually came to understand as a legitimate right of clergy in a democracy, but at the time it was frightening. Most important, what the Protestant majority, including Whitman, had to learn to accept was the justice of demands by minorities for full inclusion in the political process, not just—as was the case with the Democratic Party—to provide dependable votes. American history, of course, reveals that succeeding generations of varying majorities have had to learn to accept this idea, that it is part of the process of democratization and is perhaps most common to the urban experience.\n\nClear from Whitman's Aurora editorials is his genuine fear of the spread of ideas that bound the individual to religious beliefs and hierarchical institutions, such as the Roman Catholic Church, which he believed subverted the principle of self-determination underlying democracy. The Irish immigrant played into this fear only insofar as he or she refused to break free of the religious bond. Whitman's views were shared even by some of Hughes's supporters, among them Horace Greeley and New England's most conspicuous convert to Roman Catholicism, Orestes A. Brownson. A decade later Brownson reached the conclusion that the Irish gave Catholicism a bad name and that anti-Catholic bias was really predicated on hatred of what Irish Catholics represented to the general public.74 Unlike Brownson, whose spiritual journey took him through at least four religious affiliations, Whitman's appreciation of formalized religion was never to go beyond his admiration for the Quaker orator Elias Hicks. In notes written in the 1860s he seems to be attempting to modify his reactions to religious practices he had earlier condemned and to see them as part of a developmental process of which he no longer complains:\n\nThose stages, all over the world leaving their memories and inheritances in all the continents—how credulous! how childlike and simple! the priests revered—the bloody rites, the mummeries and all the puerile and bad things. . . . Of present and past, I do not blame them for doing what they have done, and are doing—I applaud them that they have done so well.75\n\nIn 1842, however, when he saw the highly political Catholic immigrants rallying to their priests' cries, he clearly feared the worst for the future of the Republic. It was a reaction in which he was far from alone. Newspapers such as the Aurora reflected more than the thoughts and attitudes of their writers, they reflected the popular society within which they found an audience. The language Whitman employed was that of his readers, and the image his words evoked was one already familiar enough to be recognizable to them. His horror at the mix of Irish Catholicism and politics and his descriptions of the Irish as subhuman violent rioters point to the figure of \"Paddy,\" invented by antebellum Americans faced with an influx of immigrants unlike any that preceded them. Whitman's characterization of the Irish as disturbers of peaceful political meetings goes right to the heart of the fear that gave rise to the stereotype: the perception of the Irish as politically subversive and, in their Roman Catholicism, a fundamental threat to democracy. One study of the stereotypical Paddy distinguishes between its two principal icons: extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics. Extrinsic characteristics, those that are manifest and demonstrable—having to do with inherited qualities and physical traits, economic conditions, religious and political convictions, and such behavioral dispositions as violence and \"rowdiness\"—constituted the popular image of Paddy in the 1840s and 1850s. This was a calamitous move away from an earlier perception that defined the Irish by intrinsic characteristics pertaining more to intellect, morality, and a love of freedom. The usual year of demarcation between the two is 1845, the year of the Irish famine; however, in New York City, where Irish immigration was heavy even prior to the famine, the change occurred a few years earlier, which places it at about the time of the 1842 public school debate.76 In fact, we find Whitman using the word \"Paddies\" that year in the Aurora.\n\nWhat occasioned the use of this particular ethnic slur was a bloody street fight that escalated into the kind of mob behavior so easily ignited in New York's troubled neighborhoods and just as easily turned into rioting. On the afternoon of the April 1842 city elections a band of Protestant Irish, nativists, and other anti-Irish Democrats, all of whom felt themselves to have been ignored by their party in favor of the Irish Catholics, descended upon a Catholic neighborhood and beat its inhabitants fiercely. The Catholics retreated but regrouped a few hours later, and the fighting resumed. Mayor Robert H. Morris and the police came to restore peace, but by some accounts the police did more harm to the Catholics than had their opponents. More and more combatants joined the action. When the Catholics retreated to their homes, they were followed by members of the Spartan Band (the principal instigators of the day's battles) who invaded the Irish Sixth Ward, even entering private homes and destroying the first floor of the Sixth Ward Hotel where a polling place was still open. The Spartans next headed for the bishop's residence behind St. Patrick's Cathedral on Mulberry Street. Hughes was not at home, so the mob vented its anger on the first floor of the building by smashing windows and threatening to burn the residence, a threat they might have made good but for the arrival of police.\n\nWhitman commented editorially on the disturbances a number of times in the next few days, casually remarking, with regard to the damage to the bishop's residence, \"Had it been the reverend hypocrite's head, instead of his windows, we could hardly find it in our soul to be sorrowful.\"77 The following day he visited the Sixth Ward Hotel and, while admitting some destruction to property and individuals, denied it was extensive and accused the Catholics of having started \"the whole rumpus, merely to generate sympathy for their cause, and to make capital of.\"78 He also accused the \"bog trotters\" of having roamed the streets on election day seeking trouble and \"grossly insulting\" Americans. Even before the election day riot Whitman had briefly noted a \"great fight\" between some Sixth Ward Irish and members of \"Mike Walsh's Spartans.\" \"The Spartans routed the Paddies in magnificent style,\" Whitman reported, adding, \"We like this young Walsh, and his society.\"79\n\nThe Spartan Band was led by Mike Walsh, a Protestant Irishman and friend of Whitman, who also wrote for the Aurora on occasion and who later would go far in Democratic politics. At this point he and his friend \"Yankee\" Sullivan were street brawlers and rioters, the very things that should have qualified them as Paddies, but because they were Protestants and, like Whitman, disaffected Democratic Party members, their behavior was excusable in his eyes.\n\nDespite the disappointments he had experienced in 1842, Whitman regained his faith in the Democratic Party and proved himself so loyal to it that four years later he was rewarded with the editorship of the Brooklyn Eagle. One of his first pieces bears out his earlier contention in the Aurora that he was not a nativist. In the first week of March 1846 Whitman wrote in the Eagle of visiting New York docks where he saw ships at anchor that had weathered the cruel winter storms in the Atlantic the preceding months. The \"dangers and escapes\" these ships had endured were not lost on him, and he marveled at the condition of one, \"[H]er spars, sails, and rigging are actually drooping.\" Two weeks later he was present when a Liverpool packet arrived, \"her decks covered with emigrants.\" He was glad on their account that after their stormy passage the weather was fine, so that their impressions \"of the strange land they had chosen for their home\" might be sunny ones. The immigrants were, he says, \"a robust good looking set, mostly Hibernians and, spite of Nativism, we sent them a hearty welcome to our republic, and a wish that they might indeed find 'better times a-coming!'\"80\n\nThese are the same sorts of emigrants Herman Melville described in Redburn (1849), where his young sailor makes his first transatlantic voyage from New York to Liverpool and back. On the return trip the ship transports a number of emigrants, most of whom are leaving Ireland. While the conditions of their passage are stringent, it is clear from Melville's description, as well as Whitman's, that the \"coffin ships\" with their cargoes of starved and disease-ridden refugees had not yet begun to arrive in New York, so that Whitman could plausibly imagine the immigrants concerned only for good weather. It was no doubt the later arrivals of starved and sickened souls who moved him to write, in Leaves of Grass, of the sacredness of every individual, \"no matter who, / Is it a slave? Is it one of the dullfaced immigrants just landed on the wharf? / Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the welloff. . . . just as much as you.\"\n\nNot yet aware in 1846 of the desperation that in many cases impelled the immigrants, what Whitman welcomed was a desire for political freedom that he read into the act of Irish emigration. A few months later this understanding of their situation was altered by his reading of a report on the Irish Coercion Bill of 1846 against which Daniel O'Connell fought a final battle before his death the following year. The copy was provided for him by one of the members of the Laborers' Association, several of whom earlier had taken him to task for his criticism of their association. The report proved something of a revelation to Whitman, who claimed never to \"have realized the wrongs and destitution of Ireland so vividly\" before reading it. \"What a black and dreary narrative it furnishes,\" he exclaims, \"of a nation having the truest and fullest resources, both in the natural talent of its citizens, and in the facilities of the country—and yet all crushed for the want of a judicious and liberal government!\"81\n\nIt is obvious that Whitman saw signs of inherent good character in the Irish, so when he pointed to them as a stumbling block to the possibility presented by democracy for a human evolution into a more perfect form he was pointing to an extrinsic quality not rooted in character but in behavior, specifically the seeming refusal of the Irish to participate in this evolutionary process. This apparent refusal was especially frustrating to those who shared Whitman's more liberal view that a free society could not compel the individual; thus the Irishman who remained unwilling to change must be allowed to flourish in what Americans such as Whitman believed to be willful ignorance. To them the Paddy demonstrated not an inherent lack of character and intelligence but a determined preference for ignorance by clinging to his Roman Catholic faith, obeying its clergy, and maintaining a belligerent form of sectarian and political activity.\n\nDistinctions such as those Whitman made between Paddies and the type of Irishman suggested by the nickname \"Yankee\" Sullivan (with the fusion that would later give rise to the hyphenated American) were of the kind that had transformed the earlier image of the Irish, and its generalized ethnic application, to more specific differentiations between Ireland-born long-term residents, recent immigrants, and Irish Americans. The distinctions would also explain Whitman's disavowal of the Native American Party, for, as he insisted, he was not antiforeigner and would not exclude any from the blessings of liberty and democracy. But he did expect the foreigner, once admitted, to seize the opportunity to improve his or her character and condition. An undated notebook entry gives evidence of Whitman preparing a speech, perhaps intended for a gathering of nativists, which expressed his feelings: \"It is mentioned that the Irish and German and other foreigners mix in our politics.—Gentlemen with perfect respect I say you can think what you choose about this:—It is a credit to men and no disgrace to them to take an eager interest in politics.\"82 A similar note finds Whitman addressing his imagined audience as \"Proud sirs!\" and mockingly adopting their tone in mimicry of their patronizing attitudes: \"How those niggers smell!—How dare that Paddy ride in the same omnibus with me?\"83 Apparent contradictions fall away when these varied statements are viewed as part of the process of developing a wholistic concept of democracy and as part of Whitman's attempt to satisfy himself as to the role of the immigrant in its achievement.\n\nPerhaps the opportunity he received to live away from New York for a time helped to enlarge Whitman's vision. When he lost his editorship of the Brooklyn Eagle in 1848, Whitman left New York to work on the New Orleans Daily Crescent. There he produced a series of character sketches drawn from that city's exotic types, one of them an Irishman named Patrick, but no Paddy. \"Patrick McDray\" is a sketch of a \"hardy-looking Hibernian\" who by dint of his industry in the hauling of goods to and from the levees has raised himself to the position of, as the fictitious name suggests, independent drayman, working the docks and streets of the South's most important port city. Whitman's Patrick may have been one of the Irish laborers who had earlier dug the canals young Jeff Whitman admired in the city. Many of the draymen had made their first mark in New Orleans as laborers on the canals before moving into the carting business, where they quickly pushed aside the blacks who previously had done this work.84 Though some in the city complained of an Irish recklessness on the roads, Whitman is openly admiring of \"Pat's\" industry and the eagerness with which, once landed in \"our rightful land,\" he has improved, so that he is now \"Mr. Patrick McDray, who owns his own team and drives it like a gentleman.\"85 The emphasis on McDray's title indicates Whitman's desire to suggest what Paddy might become in America—a capitalistic owner of his own business and worthy of being called \"Mister.\" Unstated is the fact of slavery, which supported the economy into which Patrick McDray has bought himself a place.\n\nIn striking contrast to the portrait of the fictitious Patrick McDray is Whitman's description, for a later New York magazine article, of George Law, an Irish American who, though born to poverty, became very successful in the shipping industry and who, in developing political aspirations, showed contempt for the poor. Whitman's article, titled \"Street Yarn,\" depicts Law as\n\nA big, heavy, overgrown man, with a face like a raw beef-steak, little piggy eyes, queer, dry, straight, harsh, coarse hair, \"of a speckled color,\" made up of brownish red and gray, rather dirty clothes, and quite dirty, yellow dogskin gloves. He goes rolling along in an elephantine style, and for fear of being trod on, probably, people get out of the way. That is George Law, who never will be President.86\n\nThe political reference that concludes the sketch is specific to Law's thwarted presidential aspirations in 1853, but in a more general way it makes the point, even in this highly unflattering portrait, that his political failure is attributable to his character, not to his Irish ancestry.87\n\nThere were few questions of more general interest to antebellum America than character. The possibility held out by democracy for character formation and reformation led the states and their citizenry, especially in the North, into all manner of reform movements and attempts at social engineering. In the more high-minded New England states such movements were truly reformist, but in New York City they often took a political bent. Such was the case with the temperance movement, to which Whitman briefly lent himself out of a need for money. After leaving the Aurora Whitman accepted seventy-five dollars from Park Benjamin, owner of the New World, to produce a novel to be published as a supplement to the newspaper. Thus was born Franklin Evans; or The Inebriate, A Tale of the Times, a temperance novel. Whitman later offered a few different versions of its creation, one being that he wrote it while under the influence of rum, but he was clearly embarrassed by the novel and always insisted it was done for the money. Part of his embarrassment may have been for Evans's purple prose (though it sold well both in the newspaper and in a subsequent book publication), but it may also have had to do with the politics surrounding New York's temperance movement at the time. Though the Washington Temperance Society was nationwide, temperance became a political issue in nineteenth-century New York State when, under the guise of reform interests, the Republicans attempted to pass legislation that would regulate the sale of liquor and limit the number of licensed saloons. This was aimed at New York City, where Democratic political power was closely tied to the high number of Irish saloon owners. By the mid-1850s nearly 15 percent of those Democratic officeholders whose occupations are known were saloon keepers.88 The Tammany Society and the Democratic Party frequently held meetings in saloons, especially in Irish wards, where recruits were sought from among the ever-increasing numbers of newly arrived immigrants. Often, in return for the use of their premises for such purposes, saloon keepers were made ward captains and eventually became nominees for political office. Organizations such as the Washingtonians, which later published Whitman's novel, became part of the campaign to limit alcohol because their interests dovetailed with those of the Republican Party. In the 1840s they even made inroads among city firemen who, often in large numbers, took the pledge in Protestant churches.89 In the New York Aurora in March 1842 Whitman reported that the Washingtonians led a procession of New York City firemen past City Hall, followed by \"an immense number of citizens, formerly intemperate men, but now worthy members of society.\"90 The Republican effort to legislate the sale of liquor in saloons failed, at least in part, because of the opposition mounted by such New York Democratic worthies as Mike Walsh and \"Yankee\" Sullivan. While Whitman was writing Franklin Evans and Protestant churches were pledging firemen to temperance, Sullivan was opening his saloon, the Sawdust House, to firemen in Engine Company 27, who made it their headquarters.91\n\nReformers who did not commit themselves to specific areas, such as temperance or the penitentiary movement, often brought to bear on the subject of character reformation advances being made in science, especially in the field of what later was called eugenics. Whitman's interest in character formation as it pertained to the development of a society made up of morally superior individuals inevitably led him to considerations of the nature/nurture theme, which would have had particular application to immigrants. Embedded in this general theme were such questions as, Was it enough for individuals to be transplanted to a democratic soil? Could their characters be freshly nurtured and perfected simply by partaking of freedom, or environments? If the latter, could their children overcome this inheritance to become the kinds of perfect Americans Whitman describes in \"Starting from Paumanok\": \"A new race, dominating previous ones and grander far.\"\n\nOne of the places Whitman looked for answers to questions such as these was in the writings of German philosophers (which he read in translation), whose arguments often were predicated on physiological principles.92 From them and from such American homespun theorists as Oscar Fowler he pieced together his own notions of progressive science and fashioned a hope for a future democracy based on a race of healthy, wholesome individuals capable of acting freely in a free society. As did many Americans in the 1840s and 1850s, Whitman looked to such contemporary sciences as phrenology and physiognomy for an understanding of the interplay of eugenics and character. These two closely related fields claimed to offer much needed assistance in determining the character of individuals and were taken very seriously in their time.\n\nBecause such theories supported the general reform movement alive in America throughout much of the nineteenth century, they were believed to have application beyond mere self-improvement. That Americans more than those in other nations felt the need to understand the connections between character and environment can be directly laid to the freedom afforded individuals in the United States and to the presence within the country of peoples from various national backgrounds. One instance of this was the concern focused on the freedom the country offered to take advantage of others, either in such entertaining ways as those of P. T. Barnum or in the criminal intentions of a confidence man. This freedom lent an urgency, especially in large cities, to the search for some obvious way of gauging the character of another—perhaps by observing head formations or facial characteristics. While the immigrant also could have benefited from such useful knowledge, it was more often the native born who sought ways to anticipate the probable outcome of encounters with the foreigner. Beyond this lay a more far-reaching concern for the influence on democracy of the \"racial\" characteristics, as they were then termed, of ethnic Americans.\n\nOriginating in Germany, phrenology came to the United States via the lectures of Johann Spurzheim. It enjoyed enormous success in the 1840s, with thousands flocking to learn its principles. In essence, it promised to provide information about individuals by means of craniology, measuring the skull, and then, by charting the skull's formation and contours, drawing conclusions about the brain, which was believed to be the principal factor in determining character. Whitman was introduced to this methodology in 1846 when he heard a lecture in New York by Orson Fowler, who with his brother, Lorenzo, formed a team that expounded the \"science\" and made it popular through lectures, publications, and private readings of heads. Fowler did not claim that character traits were permanently set by the brain's formations but that through learning what portions of the brain were most developed one could encourage desirable traits by exercising that capacity and repressing less desirable traits. Though Whitman dismissed Fowler's assertions of phrenology's total creditability, he saw a sufficient amount of truth in it to have his head read in July 1848 by Lorenzo Fowler, a reading that indicated he was high in self-esteem, caution, combativeness, and in both amativeness, that is, love for the opposite sex, and adhesiveness, the capacity for same-sex love.93 For many years Whitman attempted to improve himself by either enlarging or \"depressing,\" as he called it, some of these capacities, most notably by depressing his tendency toward adhesiveness when he felt it leading him too strongly.94\n\nPhysiognomy, an outgrowth of phrenology, was a simpler method of determining character, for it depended on observation and interpretation of facial features and expressions. Here one sees the potential for racial stereotyping reaching beyond that offered by phrenology. Phrenology demanded the use of measuring tools and charts, but anyone could engage in physiognomy merely by observing the faces of others. One of the poems (later called \"Faces\") in Whitman's first edition of Leaves of Grass draws its inspiration from this system, though it does not include references to specifically racial features. Such racial characteristics as flat noses, slanted eyes, high or low cheekbones and foreheads, and lip size could all be interpreted by the physiognomist in ways that developed a hierarchy of national groups. The simian-faced cartoon depictions of Irish males that became popular in New York newspapers and elsewhere left little doubt of where the Irish fit in this hierarchy.95\n\nOrson Fowler took up physiognomy along with phrenology but, recognizing its limitations, moved beyond it to observations of the entire body in what was called physiology. Not surprisingly, the taller Anglo-American stature was privileged over that of other ethnic groups, and from this was drawn a conclusion of national and moral superiority. Again, reference to depictions of the Irish stereotype reveals Paddy's diminished physical stature. Obviously, the physical condition and appearance of many Irish were more attributable to poverty than to ethnicity, but such distinctions were easily blurred under the dictates of pseudoscience.\n\nThe influence on Whitman of these theories is clear, not only in his own adoption of phrenology as a self-directed discipline but also in his insistence on physiology via his body-based poetry. In an 1868 poem, \"One's-Self I Sing,\" he makes it clear that he has moved beyond the exclusive tenets of phrenology and physiognomy and has taken up physiology: \"Of physiology from top to toe I sing, / Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say the Form complete is worthier far.\" What this meant to his developing thoughts about the various ethnic groups arriving in the United States, the Irish in particular, is not certain, but the indications are that even before this he had become more of what we today would term a behavioralist, one who observes and values behavior over appearance or psychological characteristics as an indicator of character. The 1848 character sketch of the New Orleans drayman is a brief portrait of individualized character demonstrated in the behavior of one Irish immigrant. From it, as well as from other indications of approval of Irish individuals, it is possible to detect a movement away from his earlier fear that the Irish posed a threat to democracy.\n\nAs is often the case with Whitman, one finds the softening of attitude related to the female, either within his own personality or in those of others. If we return to the partially quoted stanza from \"One's-Self I Sing\" and complete it, we find the claim, \"The Female equally with the Male I sing.\" But even prior to this Whitman had extolled the female and included the Irish female. The most sympathetic depiction of the Irish Whitman ever penned was of Irish women, though it never got beyond the pages of his notebooks. In a lengthy sketch probably intended for a newspaper and written sometime around 1850 or earlier but never published, Whitman presents a composite picture of Irish immigrant women seeking employment as servants, the occupation with which they became all but synonymous. Seeing in domestic service an opportunity to better themselves while living within the security of a middle-class home, Irish women—whose migration was not so often famine-driven as it was a desire for gainful employment—were happy to take positions that were scorned by American women. In the 1840s and 1850s when Whitman wrote his account, an estimated 80 percent of women employed as servants in New York City were Irish born.96 Because of their vast numbers, they could only expect to earn from four to seven dollars per month in the city, though elsewhere in the country they commanded more.97 If wages were lower, some compensation was found in the freedom with which the women could leave houses where they were made to work too hard or for too many hours and seek better positions. The demand for \"help\" was great, and since women in other immigrant groups sought marriage at an early age, the Irish women, who in general preferred to remain single and maintain their independence, quickly learned to advertise their availability once they had acquired some experience.\n\nWhitman's article is titled \"Wants,\" which refers to newspaper advertisements placed by those Irish women who had been in service already but were looking for new places and could afford to pay for such an ad. Whitman reminds us, however, that at the offices of the \"Irish Emigrant Society\" can be seen the women \"just from Ireland\" in their thick woolen capes on the warmest days, their worn leghorn hats, and heavy, \"well-nailed\" shoes, seeking entry into this occupation. The Irish Emigrant Society was founded in 1841 under the auspices of Bishop John Hughes, but in 1847 Republicans in Albany created a Board of Commissioners of Emigration. It is not clear from his notes to which of these organizations Whitman is referring, but he displays symp"
