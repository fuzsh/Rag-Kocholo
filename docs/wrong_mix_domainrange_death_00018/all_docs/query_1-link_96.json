Even upon assuming his first major position as editor of the New York Aurora in 1842, he had already founded and edited one small newspaper, the Long Islander; worked as a printer’s devil and apprentice and then typesetter for two other Long Island papers and the New World in New York City; and contributed short pieces, articles, and fiction to sixteen different newspapers and literary magazines during a remarkably productive period in 1840–1841. Even at nineteen years old, Walt Whitman was already a prolific writer on a range of topics in a wide variety of styles. But Whitman’s journalism was often surprisingly conventional. In the “SunDown Papers,” for example, Whitman aligned himself with a contemporary form of Christianity that cultivated a reader’s moral sensibilities, going so far in No. 4 of the series to criticize strongly the use of tobacco, tea, and coffee for the “evil” they worked on the mind, body, and nervous system. He concluded that his outlook was not narrowly puritanical, but rather one grounded in reason: In conclusion, I would remark, that I am not one of those who would deny people any sensual delights, because I think it is a sin to be happy, and to take pleasure in the good things of this life. On the contrary, I am disposed to allow every rational gratification, both to the palate, and the other senses. I consider that we were placed here for two beneficent purposes; to fulfill our duty, and to enjoy the almost innumerable comforts and delights he has provided for us. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 20) In “Sun-Down Papers” No. 8 (the longest of the series) Whitman described a dream that transported his speaker into a land where “the temple of Truth” stood and where “inquirers” examined the temple through various shapes and types of optical glasses in an attempt to discern Truth. Rather than look through a\n\nman-made device, the speaker, like the Bard of Leaves of Grass, asked the reader to filter the cosmos through herself or himself: “Behold!” thus it spoke, “and learn wisdom from the spectacles which have this day unfolded to thine eyes. Thou hast gazed upon the altar of Nature; but hast seen how impossible it is to penetrate the knowledge which is stored within it. Let pride therefore depart from thy soul, and let a sense of the littleness of all earthly acquirements bow down thy head in awe before the mighty Creator of a million worlds. Thou hast seen, that whatever of the great light of truth it has been deemed expedient to show to mortals—can be most truly and usefully contemplated by the plain eye of simplicity, unaccompanied by the clogs and notions which dim the gaze of most men—and hast with wonder seen how all will still continue to view the noblest object of desire through the distorted medium of their own prejudices and bigotry.” (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 26–27) This remarkable article, appearing in the Long Island Democrat on October 20, 1840, positions Whitman in the Protestant Christian tradition of the seeking believer who accepts duty and enjoyment of life’s pleasures as concurrent while also situating himself, in his critique of prejudice and bigotry, in the tradition of the freethinking ecumenicalism of Thomas Paine. One could practice restraint and avoid excesses, yet savor and enjoy the delightful experiences of the senses. One could assume humility and a sense of one’s “littleness” and thus through “the plain eye of simplicity” see “whatever of the great light of truth it has been deemed expedient to show to mortals.” Denominationalism and sectarianism in their extremes resulted from men viewing “the noblest object of desire [‘the temple of Truth’] through the distorted medium of their own prejudices and bigotry.” By the time he was twenty-one, Whitman was already inviting his readers to see with “the plain eye of simplicity,” unhindered by presuppositions or the presumed advantages of doctrinal systems (Stacy, Walt Whitman’s Multitudes, 27–33). When Whitman became the “leading editor” of the New York Aurora on March 28, 1842, the paper had been in full production for only about four months. Its first lead editor, Thomas Low Nichols, had resigned after three months and would forsake daily journalism to become a medical doctor and promote, with his physician wife, health foods, spiritualism, and hydropathy. The two senior partners of the Aurora, Anson Herrick and John F. Ropes, attempted to find a niche audience by positioning their new paper against the salacious topics of the penny press: seductions, disappearances, sensational crimes such as emxii introduction\n\nbezzlement and murder, and other maleficence perpetrated up and down the social scale. The market “hook” for the Aurora was that it would be “a sound, fearless and independent daily paper, which shall at all times and on all occasions advocate and sustain the dignity and interests of our country” (qtd. in Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 1). Whitman took to this outlook and orientation avidly and enthusiastically. His employers boasted that Whitman was a “bold, energetic and original writer” who would carry out the “original design” of the paper. In his March 29, 1842, article, “The New York Press,” Whitman provided short sketches of twelve city newspapers (including the Aurora) and concluded: Very few really good papers are published in New York. Most of them are bound up in partisanship or prejudice, and are incapable of taking enlarged and comprehensive views of matters and things. Five sixths of them are directly or indirectly under the control of foreigners; they therefore, though possessing some marks of ability, are not imbued with any wholesome American spirit. They cannot and do not come out with that fiery enthusiasm in the cause of truth and liberty—that vigor of advocacy—that energy and boldness and frankness which will ever mark the apostle of the new system—the system which teaches far different doctrine from the rusty, cankered, time-honored, anti-democratic philosophy that looms up in Europe, and is planting its poisonous seeds too widely among us. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 82) But Whitman’s embrace of the American spirit often took perplexing turns in the Aurora. Throughout the spring of 1843, editorials in rival newspapers and letters to the editor sharply criticized the Aurora for being anti-immigrant and for promoting nativism. In his March 30, 1842, article, “Defining Our Position,” Whitman quoted directly from a critical letter and replied that the “motives of the Aurora, in some of its recent steps, have been much misunderstood” (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 85). Whitman asserted that the anti-American influences resided not in the people coming to the United States, but in the form and circulation of foreign ideas, customs, or notions that found favor and subverted the potency of a democracy where man “can be trusted to govern himself.” In this regard, though Whitman claimed to be a universalist against religious bigotry, he was also a proponent of cultural assimilation: We would that all the taint of time defiled custom—all the poisonous atmosphere of European philosophy—all the fallacious glitter of a literaWalt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xiii\n\nture which, being under the patronage of courts and princes and haughty church, is not fitted for our beloved America—all the aristocratic notions, interwoven so tightly with social customs, as to be almost ineradicable— we would that all this might have no sway in the land. These things are not for such as we. A higher and holier destiny, a more worthy mission, we sincerely hope, belong to us. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 85) The occasion for the correspondent’s charges against the Aurora had to do with the New York public schools and the efforts of Catholic bishop John Joseph Hughes, with support of Whig governor William Seward, to change the system of public school funding in New York City so that parochial schools would receive operational monies. Whitman blamed the “lowest class of foreigners” for disrupting a public meeting on the matter and for bullying and intimidating peaceful citizens and driving school officials from the stage. Whitman characterized these “foreigners” in terms that make us cringe today: Bands of filthy wretches, whose very touch was offensive to a decent man; drunken loafers; scoundrels whom the police and criminal courts would be ashamed to receive in their walls; coarse, blustering rowdies; blear eyed and bloated offscouring from the stews, blind alleys and rear lanes; disgusting objects bearing the form of human, but whom the sow in the mire might almost object to as companions—these were they who broke into the midst of a peaceful body of American citizens—struck and insulted the chosen officers of the assemblage, and with shrieks, loud blasphemy, and howlings in their hideous native tongue, prevented the continuance of the customary routine. We saw Irish priests there—sly, false, deceitful villains—looking on and evidently encouraging the gang who created the tumult. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 57) In responding to public criticism of this kind of language, Whitman conceded that he used “harsh epithets” in condemning Bishop Hughes and his Irish priests: “but that we know our motives are good, and that our aim is holy; and that therefore we shall be absolved from blame” (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 89). In these self-important terms, it is possible to sense Whitman’s anxiety about the volatile state of American democracy during the 1840s, a time when the founding generation had been gone for a generation and universal white male suffrage, itself only a generation old, stood atop whole populations unrepresented in the political contests of the day. Like many Americans, Whitman viewed the xiv introduction\n\ngrowth of new immigrant populations in American cities, the advent of the first industrial revolution, and ongoing sectional tensions with a degree of trepidation. For Whitman, newspapers existed to educate Americans about the right paths for their relatively new republic, and therefore could lay claim to a “holy” aim. From Whitman’s point of view, the school controversy, with its resulting riots and street violence that disturbed the city for a period of weeks, was a severe test of democracy and its principles. His attacks often ran to the conspiratorial and warned of the “Hughes clique” or the “Catholic priests—those hired fomenters of discord and assassins of union” (New York Aurora, April 6, 1842). Accordingly, an Irish faction supposedly manipulated Tammany Hall, using the power of their votes to leverage support for the passage of a favorable school bill in Albany that would fund religious inculcation with public dollars and thereby undermine the creation of freethinking citizens. Here Whitman’s ecumenicalism faltered against his universalism, and he found himself attacking the faith of immigrants he hoped would assimilate into the “American spirit.” Complicating matters was the 1843 New York City mayoral election, where the Irish vote played a key role. When the school bill passed and when the Irish-supported ticket won the city election, Whitman framed the defeat in terms dire to the Republic: The indignation of large numbers of our citizens is roused to a pitch altogether ungovernable, against the insults and absolute tramplings upon American citizenship by the Catholics and ignorant Irish. What conduct this indignation will exhibit itself in, it is impossible to tell. Hughes’ house is much injured, and in all likelihood the cathedrals would have been attacked and sacked, if the people had not been deterred by the military. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 115) When the turmoil finally subsided as Whitman neared the end of his editorship with the Aurora, he again responded to the charge that his editorials promoted Native Americanism, as if the tone of them likewise made him uncomfortable: Yet with all our antipathy for everything that may tend to assimilate our country to the kingdoms of Europe, we repudiate such doctrines as have characterized the “Native American” party. We would see no man disfranchised, because he happened to be born three thousand miles off. We go for the largest liberty—the widest immunities of the people, as well as the blessings of government. Let us receive these foreigners to our shores, and to our good offices. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 124) Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xv\n\nWith the election lost and the fervor cooled, Whitman pragmatically pulled back from the angry and vitriolic rhetoric and charges he had made against Bishop John Hughes and the Catholic priests and returned to basic bromides of democratic principles. Within the ideology of Whitman’s Jacksonian inclinations, as the nation expanded geographically and demographically, the base of free voters had to expand continuously in order for the foundations of the Republic to remain strong, or at least strongly Democratic. Practically, a split between native and Irish Democrats opened a political space for rival parties. Retaliations and recriminations, such as disfranchisement, choked off “the largest liberty,” and, as much as Whitman mistrusted at this point the American Catholic hierarchy, he recognized that religious liberty and the safety of Catholic Churches were part of the larger democratic equation. While the Catholic school bill was the prime newsworthy topic during Whitman’s short tenure at the Aurora, his work there also provided him with column space to develop a distinctive voice and style that delighted in scenes, or “peeps,” of activities, and people of the city, all expressed with a conviction that the newspaper could educate the American citizenry. His reporting strengths were descriptive, out-and-about walks and excursions, strolling down a main thoroughfare like Broadway down to the Battery, or observing the same from a vantage point of the balcony of P. T. Barnum’s American Museum. In Aurora articles like “Something Worth Perusal” (April 7, 1842) and “Sentiment and a Saunter” (April 13, 1842) Whitman developed an ambulatory style that registered sites, sensations, and the immediate process of thought and reaction in the process and rhythm of walking; in these articles Whitman was an urban loafer before he was loafing on the grass. This style offered infinite variation for the author since the saunterer’s attention was selective, but his voice introduced the reader to the infinite variety and universal qualities of the things he heard and experienced (Stacy, Walt Whitman’s Multitudes, 56–59). One stroll took Whitman into the park to observe young boys earnestly and competitively playing a game of marbles, and a group of older gentlemen who observed them: How ardent the little gamesters are! How pleased at gaining a spherical moiety of clay—and how cast down at losing it! Thus it is. In our greener age, we pursue shadows and toys; in maturity, the toil and the sweat and the fever are for benefits as intangible, and phantom gewgaws, intrinsically xvi introduction\n\nas valueless as the objects of our youth. (“‘Marble Time’ in the Park,” New York Aurora, April 4, 1842) Whitman also took his readers along for behind-the-scenes “peeps” at the interiors of antebellum New York City. His March 16, 1842, Aurora article, “Life in a New York Market” (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 55–56), describes a Saturday night visit to the Grand Street market and the colorful sellers and buyers there and the sights and sounds of a bustling, well-stocked marketplace where commerce made for a rich scene. Another piece from March 18, 1842, describes New York boardinghouses and the diversity of characters found there (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 61–62). Another “peep” took Aurora readers inside a Jewish synagogue and described in positive terms the religious rites, the rituals of prayer, and the individual readings from the sacred Torah (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 76–77, 83–84). In the second visit, Whitman described the overall impression of what he heard and saw (even if he did not understand the language or the ritual). His “fancy” transports him to the original land of the Jews: We were in the holy city. The places of the haughty nobles—the magnificent temple which the Jews loved as the apple of their eye . . . And along the public thoroughfare came trailingly a solemn group. In the centre was a pale being with a crown of thorns bound round his forehead, and blood trickling down his brow. It was the Holy Savior of Man, bearing the cross upon his shoulder. And as he passed, the mob scouted and reviled him—his very friends thought it scorn to recognize him; all but one, a woman, who followed him even to the place of his crucifixion. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 84) Another “peep” took Whitman to the House of Refuge, where 200 young boys or juvenile delinquents lived and went to school in a place of tight military discipline. These articles showed the rich variety of life and scenes in New York without the editor being the subject of attention or the sensibility or personality through which all had to pass. The displacement was away from the editor to the reader, to a “you” or “our” or “we.” Whitman also had philosophical and ethical pretensions. Such an article could be occasioned by a death, such as that of the impoverished McDonald Clarke, who had power and promise as a poet, but whose nobility and gentleness, according to Whitman, proved to be the weakness that caused his death. In his last week with the Aurora Whitman wrote about children and their inWalt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xvii\n\nnocence (April 16, 1842), “Life and Love” on April 20, “The Ocean” on April 21, and “Dreams” on April 23. At the end of “Life and Love” Whitman observed: So let us be more just to our own nature, and to the gifts which the Almighty has made ineradicable within us. Casting our eyes over this beautiful earth, where so much joy and sunshine exist—looking on the human race with the gentle orbs of kindness and philosophy—sending our glance through the cool and verdant lanes, by the sides of the blue rivers, over the crowded city, or among those who dwell on the prairies, or along the green savannahs of the south—and we shall see that everywhere are the seeds of happiness and love. Yet unless they are fostered, they will be entombed forever in the darkness—and their possessors may die and be buried, and never think of them but as baubles and worth no care. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 133) These four philosophical pieces can be read as Whitman’s attempt to regain balance and a wider, more universal perspective after the narrow sectarian and political battles that erupted in New York in often ugly and violent ways during the debate over public school funding. The reasons for Whitman’s separation from the Aurora are unclear, and what scanty evidence exists proves to be contradictory and circumstantial. Both the owners and Whitman recriminated each other bitterly in print. From Whitman’s point of view, he left the paper because his contributions to its success were not appreciated or recognized and because the two proprietors introduced disruptions that hampered the daily running of the paper and its meeting a tight production schedule. Nonetheless, his editorship of the Aurora resulted in an expansion of circulation by 25 percent to a distribution of 5,000 daily (Bergman, “Introduction,” lii). According to Whitman, this was due to his ability to write lively, fresh lead articles and take strong, independent positions that exposed and assailed “a thousand dangerous influences operating among us—influences whose tendency is to assimilate this land in thought, in social customs, and to a degree, in government, with the moth eaten systems of the old worlds” (“We,” Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, April 9, 1842, 106). Besides this aggressive defense of all that was “American,” Whitman developed a repertoire of articles that honed his prose and brought some measure of balance to the paper and a day-to-day sense that no matter what the upsets, life would continue in ordinary ways that were interesting and illuminating. He did what Herrick and Ropes hired him to do: expand the newspaper’s circulation and take strong and independent stands xviii introduction\n\nagainst the supposedly dangerous influence of European ideas and customs in America, all through original and compelling writing. The period from April 1842 to March 1846 is one in which Whitman utilized all his newspaper experience and his writing skills to make a living and remain active in the competitive literary marketplace. After leaving the Aurora, Whitman edited the New York Evening Tattler, wrote for and edited the Sunday Times, and contributed articles to the Sun and the Daily Plebian. In the period 1843–1844 he edited the New York Statesman and then the New-York Democrat (merged with the New York Plebian in October 1844). Two of the papers he edited were publications created for Democratic political campaigns and for the promotion of certain tickets and candidates. These papers quickly disappeared after their purposes were served, and when published, had few of the leading editorials, news features, or stories like those Whitman had written for the Aurora. Unfortunately, few issues of these papers have survived, although references to them or items from them were reprinted in other papers (Bergman, “Introduction,” lxi). In addition, Whitman successfully placed articles, poetry, fiction, and sketches in a number of newspapers and in literary magazines before he began his work as chief editor of the daily Brooklyn Eagle in early March 1846. He also wrote a series of fifty-five articles for the Brooklyn Evening Star, an assignment that signaled his move across the river to Brooklyn, his boyhood home. Two publications from the early 1840s represent Whitman’s development of an article type he later used at the Eagle and, ultimately, refined into a complex patriotism that deemed the American republic “essentially the greatest poem” in the first edition of Leaves of Grass (1855). “A Ramble up the Third Avenue—The Old House at Kipp’s Bay—Landing of the British Troops There in 1776—Washington’s Bravery and Escape” in the Sunday Times for March 20, 1842 (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 140–142), and “Twenty-Fifth November” in the Sun for November 25, 1842 (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 163–164), were ostensibly commemoration and historical pieces in which Whitman visited Revolutionary War battle spots and recalled in vivid detail what decisive moments or battles took place there. Though much of the physical evidence of the war had disappeared as new buildings and roads replaced those standing in 1776, Whitman took the reader to the exact historical spot where the Battle of Long Island took place and in quick sketches painted the scene of military conflict. At Kipp’s Bay on Manhattan Island, Whitman’s George Washington reacts with an uncharacteristic outburst when his troops flee the oncoming redcoats: Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xix\n\nOn this occasion—and it is said to have been, with one exception, the only time he was heard to use profane language during the revolution—the commander-in-chief pulled his chapeau from his head, cast it upon the ground, called the retreating soldiers d----d scoundrels and cowards, and at the same time pulled a pistol from his holsters, and threatened to shoot the first man that passed by him. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 142) The Sun article for November 25, 1842, lamented the fact that the day of the British evacuation of New York in 1783, which formerly had been recognized with as much enthusiasm as July 4th, was now no longer celebrated, and indeed was almost forgotten. However, the opportunity was still there to walk “this classical ground of the island of Manhattan” and be on the spot where Washington was only fifty yards from the advancing British columns until his “aids [sic] pointed out to him his danger and hastened him from the scene” (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 142). For Whitman, commemoration and remembrance offered communion with the past and an opportunity to measure one’s commitment to democratic principles against those who risked all for independence and the well-being of the new republic. In this regard, Whitman’s journalism echoed contemporary patriotic discourses, but it also offers modern readers the opportunity to uncover the germ of the poet’s own brand of patriotism where an idealized United States represents the will of a democratic cosmos (Stacy, “Washington’s Tears,” 218). Between the years 1846 and 1848 Whitman again found himself working on a Democratic paper. The Brooklyn Eagle, and King’s County Democrat, a daily paper with a weekly issue on Wednesdays for circulation on Long Island, was something of a promotion for Whitman. Whereas larger Democratic papers overshadowed the Aurora in New York, the Eagle represented received Democratic opinion in the burgeoning city of Brooklyn. As editor, Whitman found himself in the middle of a technological revolution that was changing how news was gathered, reported, and distributed. In 1846 the Magnetic Telegraph Company established a network that included connections between New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. (Reid 117–127). In at least four Eagle articles Whitman referred to specific news that had been received by way of the Magnetic Telegraph Company, such as news about battles in the U.S.-Mexico War or the signing of the Oregon Treaty, which settled a boundary dispute between the United States and Britain. On June 15, 1846, Whitman noted that ratification of the treaty was pending in the Senate, which took place on June 18, 1846. News was moving faster, and events xx introduction\n\nand developments had more currency and even, to some degree, a sense of simultaneity—that is, what was confirmed as happening was continuing to happen; news was approaching up-to-the-minute. With a direct telegraph line between Washington, D.C., and New York City, the newspaper became the medium through which news happened since the telegraph’s coded messages became print faster in newspapers than in any other print medium. Likewise, as passage across the Atlantic sped up with the use of clipper ships, European and British newspapers arrived sooner and with more frequency. At the Eagle, Whitman worked on the cusp of this news and information revolution. Developments in the steam-powered printing press increased the speed of printing threefold in 1830, and by 1837 a press could produce 4,000 papers in an hour (Emery and Emery, 135–143). Reliable, faster printing meant that editors had more time to sift through other newspapers, read the latest telegraphic reports, and find that elusive “hook” for a story or leading article. In his April 19, 1847, article titled “Our New Press” (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. II, 250) Whitman described “our new napier press” as “truly a magnificent piece of workmanship” with its “dull rub-a-dub [shaking] our table from the room below while we write.” Other social and political developments proved as transformative as technology. The U.S.-Mexico War, from April 25, 1846, to February 2, 1848, took place within the time frame of Whitman’s Eagle editorship and brought the excitement of almost daily direct news from the battlefields and two fronts, public celebrations of major victories with fireworks and massive parades, and questions over the legitimacy of the war and the exacting of territory from Mexico after its defeat, as well as a host of military men who would be likened to Revolutionary heroes in the press. Whitman’s position on the U.S.-Mexico War was never in doubt and never varied: the war was, for him, a fortuitous opportunity that offered a higher purpose, namely, the spread of democratic ideals across the continent. On September 2, 1846, less than five months into the war, he wrote: That the popular instincts go for an increased “area of freedom,” is undeniable. And the popular instincts are right. Our union will stand steadier, the broader and more massive the base on which it stands. It is not the vulgar spirit of conquest and acquisition, either: it is exulting pride in the spread of man’s rights, and in the surrounding of their identity with the highest phase of national grandeur, potential strength, and wealth—of physical extent in one compacted nation—athwart which the sun of heaven ever beamed! (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. II, 42) Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xxi\n\nOver a year later, on December 2, 1847, he wrote: We have lofty views of the scope and destiny of our American republic. It is for the interests of mankind that its power and territory should be extended—the farther the better. We claim these lands, thus, by a law superior to parchments and dry diplomatic rules. (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. II, 370) Those criticizing the United States, such as Horace Greeley’s New York Tribune, Whitman believed, failed to see how the “very large accessions of fertile territory” will assure the future prosperity of the country (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. II, 370). Other large political crosscurrents, related to simmering domestic conflicts reopened by the war, ran through the period of Whitman’s Eagle editorship, the most critical one being the question of the extension of slavery into new lands and whether new states, once established, could decide on the question of slaveholding. Whitman’s position was that slavery worked against national interests and was finally unprofitable; slave labor depressed the wages of free laborers and created an economy that undermined the economic viability of small farmers and artisans, those closest to the founders’ ideal citizens. In this, Whitman hewed to arguments of the laboring and urban wing of the Democratic Party, which quickly coalesced around free-soil politics in the late 1840s. Likewise, Whitman believed the nation’s growth and its development of the largest possible freedoms and opportunities for happiness and well-being were predicated upon the largest possible base of free men able to act with only limited and necessary restraints of law and government, an idealism that echoed the free-market ideology of New York Democrats like William Leggett, whose “Locofocos” challenged Tammany Hall Democrats in the mid-1830s. Furthermore, Whitman believed that both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson foresaw the eventual end to slavery and that the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 exemplified the founders’ inclination. Whitman’s faith in the “natural death” of slavery proved popular, but finally fantastical. In his November 4, 1847, article titled “Verdict of the Undaunted Democracy of the Empire State in Behalf of the Jeffersonian Ordinance” Whitman wrote: They love our party yet; but it must be true to itself, and true to its great duties—true to the memory of the revolutionary fathers who fought for freedom, and not for slavery—true to him, the calm-browed one, and xxii introduction\n\nthe noblest democrat of them all, that, in his original draft of the declaration of American independence, inserted as one prime charge against the king and parliament of Great Britain that they had not taken measures to prevent the extension of slavery in the colonies. Have the ages so rolled backward, and humanity with them, that what we went to war to stop, seventy years ago, we shall now keep up a war to advance? (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. II, 349) As the U.S.–Mexico War continued, Whitman became increasingly aware that the issue of the extension of slavery could rend the nation and that efforts like the Wilmot Proviso (passed in the House of Representatives twice, in 1846 and 1847, and defeated in the U.S. Senate twice) to ban slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico could not prevail; in fact, the proviso threatened to divide the Democratic Party itself. The issue split the New York state Democratic Party temporarily in half, as “Barnburners” abandoned the national ticket and its presidential nominee, Lewis Cass (supported by “Hunkers,” who hunkered down to maintain party unity), to form the relatively short-lived Free-Soil Party and nominate former president Martin Van Buren. Whitman’s Eagle editorials during this period read backward in American history to what he saw as the foundational principles and intentions in the Declaration of Independence, the War for Independence, the Northwest Ordinance, Washington’s and Jefferson’s seeming ambivalence toward slavery, and the political revolution resulting from the two administrations of Andrew Jackson. Whitman set forth his arguments in favor of the Wilmot Proviso with great consistency: an extension of slavery threatened the laboring classes by weakening the economic viability and professional integrity of their work. Broadly, the growth of slavery undermined the principles of freedom and democracy. When animated by the slavery debate, Whitman spoke with fervor and eloquence, even against his own professional interests. His support of the Wilmot Proviso and his free-soil position put him on a collision course with the Eagle’s publisher, Isaac Van Anden, and, as a result, Whitman was dismissed in mid-January 1848, perhaps because of his antipathy toward the Democratic nominee, Cass, who rejected the proviso in the name of states’ rights. In this case, Whitman’s dismissal was purely political, and Whitman, along with thousands of free-soil Democrats, temporarily fell out of good graces with the New York Democratic Party. Though the Free-Soil Party disappeared as a political force after 1852, divisions within the Northern Democratic Party over the slavery issue remained, to be exploited by Whigs like Abraham Lincoln later in the decade. Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xxiii\n\nBut the slavery debate was only one of Whitman’s interests at the Eagle. He wrote about schools, visiting them frequently, and the need for enlightened, well-prepared teachers as well as policies and practices of discipline that respected students and abstained from corporal punishment. He advocated healthy outdoor exercises and games and parks where people could find relaxation and enjoyment of nature. He regularly provided “Literary Notices” of new magazines, books, and other publications that would provide enjoyment, knowledge, worthy moral and social instruction, a sense of history, and an awareness of the world and its great literature. Any reading that aimed at or elevated the lives of people, especially youths and young adults, he highly recommended. Whitman brought issues of public safety and sanitation to his readers’ attention, advocating safe and clean streets and water. He frequently wrote about music and operatic performances as well as drama, endorsing American performers and productions, and commended exhibitions of works of art. He argued that Brooklyn needed institutions of culture and science, such as an observatory or theater. These elevating and ennobling resources were especially needed in Brooklyn, a city of working-class people living modestly and practical-mindedly without the flair, excitement, and sharp contrasts available in commercial New York. Whitman also wrote about poverty and the impoverished and about the exploitation of women workers in New York and Brooklyn. He believed that low pay was the cause of crime, alcohol use, and physical violence. He consistently wrote against protective tariffs as interference with a free and open trade that would bring improvements in employment and wages. These issues resonated with the workers and families of Brooklyn who were hard hit by what became a regular cycle of “panics” and recessions or depressions. As editor, Whitman was largely responsible for the expanded circulation of what was already a heavily subscribed paper. He worked assiduously to improve the quality and finish of the paper, insisting that the compositors follow his texts exactly (Bergman, “Introduction,” lxv). The paper received praise and commendations from other publications, and Whitman frequently wrote about New York sites and events he continued to visit and enjoy, composing some of his earliest pieces on crossing the Brooklyn ferry (“Philosophy of Ferries,” Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. II, 308). He also tackled international developments and conditions, writing movingly about the starvation in Ireland and supporting Irish relief and contributions. With dismay and sadness, he wrote about the Poles’ unsuccessful effort to liberate themselves from the grip of Poland’s partitioning xxiv introduction\n\noccupiers. His interests were always deeply humanistic, with a ready sympathy for the oppressed and unfortunate. Before his next and last extended editorship, from the spring of 1857 to the summer of 1859 with the Brooklyn Daily Times, Whitman went to New Orleans with his brother Jeff and wrote articles for the New Orleans Crescent, but within a matter of months he was back in Brooklyn. He became the editor of a Free-Soil Party newspaper, the Brooklyn Freeman, in early September 1848 and managed to keep it going for a year even after the free-soil candidates polled 10 percent of the national vote but won no electoral votes in the 1848 election. The party elected two senators and fourteen representatives to the Thirty-First Congress, however, which no doubt provided it with presence and voices and explains Whitman’s continuation with the Freeman until September 11, 1849. The intense factionalism of the Barnburners and the Hunkers continued to be particularly heated in the state of New York, and did not die down after the 1848 election of former general and Whig candidate Zachary Taylor to the presidency. In the first issue of the Freeman Whitman declared his detestation of “Old Hunkerism” and its local representatives: Without any real talent, or even a tolerable share of the popular lore, these men have “managed” themselves into office, and into control of the Democratic party here. We have very close at heart the desire to prevent them from ever taking their seats in high places again; and we would resuscitate the Democrats of Brooklyn from their parlaying influence. (qtd. in the Brooklyn Daily Advertiser, April 25, 1849) Whitman may have overestimated the readership for a radical paper like the Freeman or the continuing intensity of burning issues once elections were settled. Strictly political newspapers generally had short lives and thrived before elections; papers based on principles, as Whitman’s Freeman, were even harder to sustain. When Whitman ended his editorship of the Brooklyn Freeman in September 1849, it would be seven years and eight months until he sat in the editor’s chair again. He had transformed the Freeman into a successful daily paper of the FreeSoil Party orientation and participated avidly in the give-and-take of partisan policies waged in the daily press. Starting in mid-December 1849 he had a brief stint as the principal editor of the New York Daily News, but the paper, although well funded and equipped, failed to make it beyond its second full month of publication (Rubin, 224–225). After that, Whitman’s connection with newspapers was that of a freelance contributor, and he used his technique of creating a Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xxv\n\nseries of articles to sell ten installments of “Letters from a Travelling Bachelor” to the New York Sunday Dispatch, which ran from October 14, 1849, to January 6, 1850; “Paragraph Sketches of Brooklynites” and “Church Sketches” to the Brooklyn Daily Advertiser, which ran from May 18 to June 6, 1850; his “Letters from Paumanok,” which ran in four installments in the New York Evening Post in 1851; and his “New York Dissected” series and other articles that appeared in Life Illustrated over a period of almost a year in late 1855 through 1856. Other contributions were scattered in a number of different publications in the early 1850s. During these years Whitman entered the critical phase of his development as a poet, the years that would produce the first two editions of Leaves of Grass. He pursued moneymaking enterprises like freelance writing, real estate ventures that involved the buying and selling of houses as well as their construction, job printing, and the sale of books and stationery out of the family house. Once he was out of the day-to-day and hour-by-hour regimen of newspaper editing, Whitman began to open up his horizons and take in a wider variety of experiences and contacts. He frequently stopped by the studios of Brooklyn artists, spent evening hours at the opera and took in the performances of Allessando Bettini and Marietta Alboni, and visited libraries where he could in solitude and silence read the literary works that at his editor’s desk he would have had to digest quickly in order to write notices of them. In “How ‘Leaves of Grass’ Was Made” (published in the New York Star in 1885 and in Frank Leslie’s Popular Monthly in June 1892, two months after Whitman’s death) the poet described his alternation between open-air experiences on the Long Island seashore and the cultural attractions and people of the city, particularly “the singing of the contralto Alboni and Italian opera generally” as “saturating and imbuing everything before I touched the pen to paper on my own account” (Whitman, “How ‘Leaves of Grass’ Was Made,” 732). As a journalist, Whitman had to write for a deadline set by typesetting, proofreading, and the press run. Whitman loved this atmosphere and thrived in it, but once he was out of its grip and out of the public role as editor, he could “best express my own distinctive era and surroundings, America, Democracy” with what “must be an identical body and soul, a personality—which personality, after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself—indeed could not be any other” (Whitman, November Boughs, 13). Here, then, was the essential shift in Whitman’s writing life. The journalistic world of a daily newspaper allowed for the personality of an editor, but a personality in the service of circulation and favorable readership, a personality xxvi introduction\n\nthat was acceptable to the proprietor of the paper. Whitman, now a freelancer and nascent poet, committed himself to using his “imaginative faculty” “to give ultimate vivification to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only” (Whitman, November Boughs, 7–8). Though during the next five years Whitman wrote articles for four newspapers and relied on his training and experience as a printer to make a scant living, his most significant work was the writing and printing of Leaves of Grass (1855), the preparation of the second edition in 1856, and the promotion of the work, going so far as to write a few positive reviews in which he anonymously introduced himself and his book. In June 1857, after an almost eight-year hiatus as a newspaper editor, Whitman began his affiliation with the Brooklyn Daily Times, an evening paper published six days a week and sold for “six cents a week by carrier or $3.25 a year by mail” (“Walt Whitman as a Journalist,” Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 435). His work at the Times, which spanned two years, was roughly the amount of time he had worked for the Eagle. The Panic of 1857 and the resulting economic downturn received attention in the Times, and a number of articles documented the hard times of unemployment, the inability of people to pay rents or taxes, and the need for poor relief. Whitman also wrote about practical innovation, especially the railroads as a force of economic development. In this regard, the articles focused heavily on local questions and issues for Brooklyn and the Eastern District of Long Island. He highlighted matters related to sanitation, public health and safety, and the schools and education, and he supported the development of the Ridgewood Reservoir and the Brooklyn Water Works system, which provided the city with fresh, clean water. Whitman also promoted Long Island, continuing his practice of walking into the countryside and describing sites and vistas that were inspiring and restorative. His was a Long Island in transition, as railroads connected its more remote parts, making it more a part of the market economy and changing its largely rural character. Whitman also promoted the development of Brooklyn cultural institutions and continued to write book notices and reviews, always one of his strong suits as an editor, and framed his essays on new books or magazines in terms of their usefulness and educational value, thereby maintaining the reformist theme of his earliest journalism. Whitman did not limit himself to the local, however. His articles on international developments provided perspectives beyond Brooklyn and reflected Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xxvii\n\nhis burgeoning interest in places like China, India, and Russia and his continual reading of world history, past and current. A series of articles on the laying of the Atlantic Cable proved noteworthy not only for their celebration of technology and American ingenuity but also for Whitman’s conviction that the Atlantic Cable would have transformative moral ramifications on international relations. Almost twenty years later, in “A Passage to India,” he included the Atlantic Cable as one of three world-changing modern wonders. Emory Holloway and Gay Wilson Allen have speculated that Whitman may have alienated or offended the local ministers over his comments on prostitution or his revelation of the dangerous conditions in churches, making them potential fire hazards (Bergman, “Walt Whitman as a Journalist,” 436). One scholar even has questioned the extent to which Whitman had editorial control over the content of the Brooklyn Daily Times (Loving, 227–232). Whatever the case, Whitman ceased to publish in the Times around June 1859, and thereafter his day-to-day contact with the newspaper world ended. Because he did not have a financial stake or investment in any of the large papers he worked for, Whitman could not negotiate conditions of editorial freedom. William Cullen Bryant, of the New York Evening Post, and Horace Greeley, of the Tribune, could parlay their initial investments into editorial control and then into personal fortunes (Brown, William Cullen Bryant; Williams, Horace Greeley). But Whitman needed his pay in order to live and could not afford to “buy into” the papers on which he worked. Although June 1859 marked the end of Whitman’s services as an editor to any paper, he remained for almost the rest of his life an active contributor of articles and poetry to a wide array of publications. In the period from 1859 to late 1891 he published just over 130 articles in newspapers and 51 articles in magazines, including seven substantial articles in the prestigious North American Review, concluding with “Have We a National Literature?” in March 1891. He published sixty-four poems in newspapers and another forty-five in magazines. From 1863 through 1865 he reported from Washington, D.C., on the nation’s capital during the Civil War in nine extended letters to the New York Times, and in the same period published war articles of local interest in the Brooklyn Daily Union and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. One of Whitman’s most successful types of publications continued to be the progressive and interlinked series. His most extensive (in terms of newspaper space and numbers) was “Brooklyniana: A Series of Local Articles on Past and Present” with No. 1 published in the Brooklyn Daily Standard on June 3, 1861, and No. 39 (which really was No. 23) published on November 1, 1862 (in all, there xxviii introduction\n\nwere twenty-two articles, two of the installments with two parts). In March, April, and May 1862 Whitman published seven articles in a series titled “City Photographs,” which were featured in the New York Leader. Later, in 1874, he developed another series titled “’Tis But Ten Years Since,” which ran in consecutive issues of the New York Weekly Graphic from January 24 to March 1, 1874. This series commemorated the Civil War veterans and the preservation of the Union. Whitman’s longest association with a publication was with The Critic: A Fortnightly Review of Literature, the Fine Arts, Music, and the Drama, published in New York. In the second issue of The Critic of January 28, 1881, he published “How I Get Around at 60, and Take Notes. (No. 1),” and five more of this series came out, with No. 6 appearing in the July 15, 1882, issue; each was the lead article. Between January 29, 1881, and February 28, 1891, Whitman published twenty prose pieces and eight poems in this journal, and many of the articles or essays were collected into later volumes of his prose. A number of these publications were reprinted in other publications as well, which did not make him any money but certainly circulated his name as a prose writer and poet. Whitman’s more than thirty years as a contributor and correspondent from 1859 to 1891 illustrate his savvy regarding the publishing market and his ability to write articles that were salable and provided income. He recognized that his knowledge of and passion for New York City and Brooklyn could be turned into features that editors desired. He capitalized on his growing fame and reputation as a poet and became a noted literary historian and critic of American and British poetry and literature. His many book reviews and notices provided him with a knowledge of and familiarity with literature, history, biography, and other areas that few other writers could claim. In his writings he also proved to be a passionate and knowledgeable historian of America from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, as well as a keen critic of his times. Whitman’s work as a journalist is important for what it reveals about the way his sensibility as a skilled print tradesman established an occupational route that sustained him while at the same time cultivating his literary aspirations. Perhaps more significant, journalism honed Whitman’s sense that a piece of writing was a built object as well as the medium for ideas. This sensibility came to fruition in the poet’s careful crafting and recrafting of Leaves of Grass over thirty years. Whitman imagined an audience of readers with whom he could personally connect both through his words and the book itself. His engagement with the political developments and issues of the day caused him to define and solidify Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xxix\n\nhis democratic and moral principles and to align himself with what he believed to be American values established through the American Revolution and the early republic up through the administrations of Andrew Jackson. While party politics often disappointed him, democracy, as a vital and expanding force, never did. The newspaper and, later, Leaves of Grass were the media through which democracy was proclaimed. Whitman’s deep faith in the “penny press” was first expressed in his March 26, 1842, New York Aurora editorial when he declared that it could “disperse the clouds of ignorance; and make the great body of the people intelligent, capable, and worthy of performing the duties of republican freemen” (Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 74). He saw the penny papers as “mighty engines of truth” pitted against the larger newspapers representing the vested interests of the moneyed, aristocratic, and privileged class that sought to stifle or control surging popular democracy. He recognized this development as “our experiment of democratic freedom” that necessitated new doctrines, innovations, and “systems of policy” that would develop the “capacities of men for self-government” and extend citizen self-reliance to a new standard (“Swing Open the Doors!,” Brooklyn Daily Eagle, July 28, 1846, Whitman, The Journalism, Vol. I, 481). Whitman periodically wrote editorials that championed the role of the press in forwarding and securing the full extent of the democratic experiment, and he remonstrated against those newspapers and editors that were bogged down in party politics or self-interested agendas. In his “The Press—Its Future” editorial for the Brooklyn Daily Times issue of July 31, 1857, he wrote: “The introduction of the magnetic telegraph and the invention of lightning presses have made the press the institution par excellence, of the day. . . . Newspapers have become the mirror of the world, without looking into which, no one can accomplish anything.” During his editorship of the Brooklyn Daily Times, Whitman wrote over twenty articles on the press and journalists, reflecting his ability to stand back and view the field and profession in which he worked. In his poem “Years of the Modern,” from the “Songs of Parting” cluster in the 1881 edition of Leaves of Grass, he wrote: With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the wholesale engines of war, With these, and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all geography, all lands; . . . The newspaper was a “modern” force and transforming agent that Whitman knew from the inside as editor, as printer, and as freelance contributor. xxx introduction\n\nWhitman’s journalism sustained him for over fifteen years, and his versatility in a variety of genres (reportage, narrative, polemic) allowed him to improve the quality and circulation of at least two papers, the Aurora and the Eagle. He found great satisfaction in the work, though also profound frustrations, generally from the political imperatives placed on him in the highly partisan newspapers of the 1840s and 1850s. He imagined an audience of readers with whom he could personally connect and whom he could influence for the better in a variety of ways, but newspapers finally proved too limited a medium for this connection. He needed total editorial control in a world where editors faced proscriptions from publishers, politics, and the public. While his engagement with the political developments and issues of his times helped him hone his democratic vision and align himself with what he believed to be the spirit of the American Revolution, the penny press of his day and Democratic newspapers in particular proved too limited for his purview. Whitman’s editorships ended with resignation or termination (or both), and his freelance work proved too piecemeal and scattered to allow the construction of a sustained voice. Ultimately, Whitman’s stalled career in journalism provided a twofold legacy: its opportunities for sustained writing established, as Emerson said, a long foreground for Whitman’s vibrant and freewheeling poetry; and, perhaps more important, journalism’s limitations pushed Whitman to seek another medium to capture the cosmos with words. In this light, today’s readers of Whitman are doubly indebted to his career in journalism. In one sense, we have always known Whitman’s journalism, since so much of Specimen Days and Collect is made up of prose that originally appeared in newspapers. In another sense, though, we have only very gradually become aware of the scope, quantity, and chronological sweep of his journalistic writing. The history of the publication of Whitman’s pre–Civil War journalism is piecemeal, confusing, and still ongoing. It began in the 1920s, when editors Cleveland Rodgers and John Black published The Gathering of the Forces (1920), which made available texts of Whitman’s writings for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1846 and 1847. Rodgers contributed a lengthy essay titled “Whitman’s Life and Work, 1846–1847,” which was valuable in establishing the facts and circumstances of Whitman’s editorship as well as asserting the importance of his journalism in his development as an American poet and spokesman: If this seems long and at times excessive in its praise of what, after all, is only a small part of the work of Walt Whitman, it must be charged to Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xxxi\n\nmy own enthusiasm, stirred by the discovery of so much that is new and inspiring in what Whitman called these “big strong—days—our young days—days of preparation: the gathering of the forces.” (Whitman, Gathering of the Forces, liii) While Rodgers and Black presented Whitman’s newspaper writings in complete form, nearly faithful to the originals, they removed the editorials and articles from their original chronological sequence, thus blurring historical context. In 1921 Emory Holloway published The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman, which contained some of Whitman’s first substantial newspaper pieces, including the 1840 “Sun-Down Papers” from the Long Island Democrat, along with some articles from other papers, including his sketches for the New Orleans Crescent (1848). More of Whitman’s journalism appeared in the 1930s. Emory Holloway and Vernolian Schwarz edited I Sit and Look Out: Editorials from The Brooklyn Daily Times (1932), and Holloway’s introduction provided significant facts about Whitman’s editorship, commentary on the articles, and an explanation of probable reasons for Whitman leaving the paper. The selections made by Holloway and Schwarz represent only about 10 percent of the writing Whitman did for the Brooklyn Daily Times from the spring of 1857 through June 1859, and many of the editorials appear in incomplete and unreliable texts, with silent omissions. Charles I. Glicksberg’s Walt Whitman and the Civil War (1933) printed “City Photographs,” Whitman’s 1862 series of articles about New York City that he wrote for the New York Leader, along with a number of his New York Times Civil War pieces. Then, in 1936, Holloway teamed up with Ralph Adimari to publish New York Dissected: A Sheaf of Recently Discovered Newspaper Articles by Walt Whitman, which reprinted all of Whitman’s articles of late 1855 and 1856 from Life Illustrated, including the series “New York Dissected,” which ran in six parts in July and August 1856. It was not until 1950 that additional collections of the journalism became available, when two books appeared: Walt Whitman of the New York Aurora: Editor at Twenty-Two, edited by Joseph Jay Rubin and Charles H. Brown, and Florence Bernstein Freedman’s Walt Whitman Looks at the Schools, which included articles from the Brooklyn Evening Star and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Except for Joseph Jay Rubin’s The Historic Whitman (1973), which reprinted the complete run of Whitman’s “Letters from a Travelling Bachelor” (ten letters from the 1849–1850 New York Sunday Dispatch), the rest of the journalism published and made available for the first time came scattered in various journals, the results of archival detective work by such scholars as William White, who discovered xxxii introduction\n\nunpublished articles, poems, letters, notes, fragments of printing proofs, and so forth. No other researcher could match the resourcefulness and dogged searching of White, a journalism professor at Wayne State University who, in addition to his many other contributions to Whitman scholarship, published a bibliography of Whitman’s journalism in 1969 that laid out clearly just how extensive Whitman’s newspaper work was. The importance of the journalism was underscored by the emergence of a body of criticism that began to deal with Whitman’s newspaper work, including Robert D. Faner’s Walt Whitman & Opera (1951), Thomas L. Brasher’s Whitman as Editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle (1970), and Ezra Greenspan’s Walt Whitman and the American Reader (1990). In 1998 The Journalism, Volume I: 1834–1846 appeared, edited by Herbert Bergman, with associate editors Douglas A. Noverr and Edward J. Recchia. Volume II, covering 1846–1848, followed in 2003. With these volumes, part of The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman, the journalism could for the first time be found in authoritative texts edited to modern textual standards. The early journalism finally began to take its place alongside Whitman’s poetry, prose, manuscripts, notebooks, daybooks, and correspondence, which had already been carefully edited by scholars. This current volume utilizes a four-part topical structure. The first three— “Democracy and Politics,” “Moral Suasion,” and “The Arts”—reflect Whitman’s broad interests over the course of his career as a journalist. The final section, “Come Closer to Me,” deserves some explanation. The articles in this section, ranging from 1839 through 1865, illustrate how Whitman sought to develop and convey a personal voice and sense of the immediacy of experience that was more than reportorial and that sought the effect of having the reader at the writer’s elbow in a shared experience of observation and sensation. The intended effect was to move the reader closer to Whitman so that between the “I” of the author and the “you” of the reader something personal was shared and exchanged. For Whitman, this was a central need, this seeking of a connection that would become the hallmark of much of his poetry. His ability to create this sense of intimacy between writer and reader was also one of the reasons that he was hired as an editor by newspapers seeking to expand their readership. Whitman was known for his literary style, his ability to bring a fresh, new voice and perspective to a newspaper and make it distinct and individual in a competitive and crowded market. Other newspapers and editors acknowledged his skill at this and his ability to produce results; in fact, two newspapers, the Aurora and the Eagle, grew impressively in circulation under his editorship. Walt Whitman’s Journalism Career in New York and Brooklyn xxxiii\n\nThe editorials and articles are presented here in chronological sequence in each section, and each of the texts is complete, presented exactly as it appeared. The goal is to present the development of Whitman’s ideas and positions over the course of his journalistic career (which was his whole public life as a writer), to capture the rich variety of articles he published, to demonstrate his principles and convictions about the United States and Americans, and to suggest his incredible range of interests and knowledge. This volume includes only a small percentage of the total body of Whitman’s journalistic writings, and the focus is on the earlier work from the three newspapers he edited; these are the pieces that were not reprinted or gathered in his later prose works, as was his practice in Democratic Vistas, and Other Papers; November Boughs; Specimen Days and Collect; and Good-bye My Fancy, published between 1871 and 1891. In publishing his later journalism in book form, Whitman recognized the important connection it had to his literary reputation. In gathering a broad selection of his earlier journalism in book form, we hope to show how it had an equally important connection to Whitman’s development as a writer. The titles of some articles have been regularized for overall consistency and to facilitate citation. Those titles regularized are the ones that appeared in all bold capitals and were set on the left margins of the columns with the text starting after a dash following the title. These were shorter, non-“leader” articles. All other titles have been reproduced as they appeared.\n\nxxxiv introduction\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBergman, Herbert. “Preface” and “Introduction.” In Walt Whitman, The Journalism, Volume I: 1834–1846, ed.

Each department of taste and science, and even political economy, (strange as it may seem) is imbued with a principle which leads to copying from the English or other Europeans—in their similar department. And we bend in slavish adoration to that which ushers itself in with the stamp of foreign approbation. We dare not question the infallibility of London and Edinburgh critics. A man comes among us with certificates from royal colleges, and baronet professors, and diplomas of employment as court purveyor in whatever his line may be—and our obedient republicans bow themselves humbly to the mandate. Why should this be? Have we not people among us as worthy and as capable, as these European itinerants? Have we not scholars as learned, and philosophers as wise? If we have not, it is from the neglect and ingratitude of their own countrymen—who refuse to give them encouragement, or bestow their well earned meed2 of praise. But we have. Native Americans3 are numerous among us, who equal in scientific attainments the best and noblest of the old world. The great bar is, that they have been brought up in our midst; they want the enchantment of distance, and the settling test of foreign applause. The Aurora prides itself on being imbued with an American spirit. We look upon emigrants to our republic with friendly and generous eyes; but many things they bring with them might far better be left at home. Brought up to believe in the doctrine of loyalty, and the superstitions of every kind that mark all the countries of Europe, these people find it difficult, when they come to our shores, to throw off the opinions they have worn so long. Again we say, we have no disposition to look upon foreigners with prejudiced eyes; for we view all the human family with the broad glance of benevolence Democracy and Politics 3\n\nand love. We say this, not to curry favor with foreigners; that we should disdain. The Aurora has shown that it has no fear or flattery for them. Let the citizens of this great republic be more just to themselves. Let us respect our own capacities, and not hide our lights under bushels.4 notes 1.

In the 1840s “Native American” often signified white, Protestant “native” citizens opposed to Catholic and often Irish immigrants. While Whitman’s editorials in the Aurora contain many of his most nativist sentiments, explicitly so in other Aurora editorials regarding the public funding of Catholic parochial schools, later, in the cluster “Chants Democratic and Native American” from the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass, Whitman used “Native American” in terms more universal than contemporary nativists. In his nativist articles of the spring of 1842, Whitman echoed many of the breathless warnings about the threat of Irish Catholics to American democracy and especially feared politics riven by ethnic and religious allegiances. 4. “Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.” Matthew 5:15, KJV.\n\n4 part i\n\nOrgans of the Democracy1 New York Aurora\n\nMarch 29, 1842\n\nIt is useless to conceal the fact that the democratic party in New York labor under the disadvantage of having no publication really creditable to them, and really calculated to further their interests. At the present time, the Post,2 Standard,3 and New Era,4 are all at loggerheads. The rock on which they split is the school question; the Standard being plumply in favor of the existing system—the Post also evidently opposed to a change, yet fearful to come out openly—the Era violently arrayed on the side of Hughes and the Catholic priests.5 The plain truth of the matter is, it is only by the most strenuous exertions that the New Era has permission to keep out its flag as the organ of Tammany Hall.6 A large majority of the democratic leaders do not hesitate to express their contempt and dissatisfaction with the Era. They are openly in favor of lopping off from any connection with that stupid print. In this exigency the Era knows that by taking up cudgels for the defence of the Catholic interest, it will have that interest disciplined to its support, as a kind of forlorn hope. The Era undoubtedly thinks, too, that the Tammany leaders will not have the fearlessness decidedly to repudiate the move it has taken—for fear of losing the votes of those under the control of the priests. It remains to be seen whether the whole democratic party are to be led by the nose, by this manoeuvre of a clique of jesuits, and a paper which thus stabs the vitals of the party for the chance of a little advantage to itself. Not a word has yet been said by the Era, about the nomination of Robert H. Morris as Mayor.7 The Hughes faction, no doubt, are opposed to that nomination. For our own part, we do not think the city could select a more worthy man than he who at present occupies the mayoralty. He has all the qualifications of experience, ability, and character, that are necessary. As far as we have any preference, therefore, at present, we hope Morris will win the race.8 It is wonderful that the democrats do not take summary steps in this business. It is an insult and a disgrace to the party, that a journal presuming to be Democracy and Politics 5\n\ntheir organ should thus barter away their honor, and marshall itself under the dictation of a selfish clique of foreigners. The Tammany party want, here in New York, a newspaper bold, manly, able, and American in its tenor; a newspaper vigorous and original and fresh. Until they have such a one, the organs at present recognised as theirs, will be no better than dead weight to them. 9 notes 1.

Recchia (New York: Peter Lang, 1998), 79. 2. Alexander Hamilton founded the New York Evening Post in 1801; by the 1830s the Post published editorials representing the reform interests of editor-in-chief William Cullen Bryant (1794–1878) and editor William Leggett (1801–1839), labor reformer, free-market activist, and founder of the short-lived “Locofoco” faction of the Democratic Party. The Locofocos demanded free trade against economic monopolies and sought to undermine Tammany Hall’s control of the Democratic Party in New York City. Whitman, an admirer of Leggett’s anti–Tammany Hall iconoclasm, called him “glorious.” See Allan Nevins, The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1922), 141, 224. 3. The New York Standard was edited by John I. Mumford (1791–1863), a prominent merchant, Democratic publisher, and politico who, in addition to his work on the Standard, held patronage positions in the Customs House of New York and was a delegate to the Democratic State Convention of 1852.

Levi Slamm (1816–1862), editor of the New Era in 1842, was a prominent Locofoco activist who followed William Leggett out of the New York Democratic Party in 1835 and proved instrumental in the return of the Locofocos to Tammany Hall in 1838 after the Democrats accepted Leggett’s antimonopoly platform. The Aurora, in the weeks before Whitman’s arrival as editor, described the New Era as the “official organ” of Tammany Hall. 5. In 1842 Bishop John Hughes (1797–1864) marshaled the growing power of Irish American immigrants in New York City to force Democratic Party support of public funding for parochial schools. For more on this “school war” of 1842, see Edwin Burrows and Mike Wallace, Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 499; Diane Ravitch, The Great School Wars: A History of the New York City Public Schools (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974), 46–47.

Such men are to be found in political organizations, in charge of newspapers, and in high stations. We have taken some pains to watch the movements of these people, and see what effect their mean opinions of the working men would have upon their opinions of government, state policy and public affairs. We have obtained much light on this subject, and, after long and close observation, we find that these people are, almost invariably, the admirers of monarchy, the lovers of such a government as would grind the poor into dust, and elevate their own dear selves high above all others. They are so fond of themselves as to be unable to remember that the working man possesses intelligence sufficient to criticize the acts of public servants or conductors of the public press; they think nothing too absurd for the gullibility of the people—the columns of newspapers under their control teem with the most absurd misrepresentation and fraud—packed organizations and emissaries are hired to manufacture public opinion among the knowing ones, with the hope of its spreading throughout the community, the state or the nation— these and a thousand others are the means used by these designing knaves. In the end, however, we have always noticed, that no matter how strong the triumph of error built upon these false notions of the working people may be, its end and overthrow by these very people whom it despises, is sure to come the moment the power goes back in the hands of those who conferred it. This fact—proved by history—developed by the every day occurrences of life—should teach political leaders, and all persons who serve the people, to have constantly before them, “the greatest good to the greatest number.”2 With this motto, affectionately cherished in all their deliberations for political power, we will guarantee, to those who adopt it, the lasting favor of the people; and to the people in return, we will guarantee a wise government, just laws, protection to life and property, prosperity and happiness. 8 part i\n\nParties must remember that the masses of the people are as intelligent as the wire pullers3 of any faction or clique; and that all public measures—their effects upon the public weal, and their bearing upon the rights of the people—are watched with argus eyes4 by the people: those who forget this principle, whether conductors of the press or of government, may depend upon a fate like that which has cast thousands of their predecessors into the dark abyss of oblivion. notes 1.

Argus was a legendary Greek giant with 100 eyes.\n\nDemocracy and Politics 9\n\nTexas1 New-York Democrat August 12, 1844\n\nBy a late arrival from Vera Cruz, we learn that the utmost activity prevails in the arrangements for invading Texas—that the 15,000 men authorised for the expedition, are coming in from the various provinces, and that the four millions required to commence the campaign, will be made up as soon as the amount can be collected from the different States among whom it has been apportioned. Under the pretence of repairing the fortifications at St. Juan de Ulloa, and the defences at Vera Cruz, Santa Anna has drawn from England, on security of the mines, two millions worth of powder, ball, cannon, muskets, and ammunitions of war; and several officers connected with the East India army in the late wars, have had permission of the British Government to join the Mexican army destined against Texas. These preparations convince us of the serious intentions of Santa Anna in his designs against Texas. He knows the country has already experienced reverses at the battle of San Jacinto—is determined to retrieve his losses, and soothe his wounded honor—and Texas is not in a condition to repel this formidable invasion, and without aid from the United States, we apprehend the revengeful and sanguinary Mexicans will succeed.2 Shall we permit Mexico to recover Texas? The answer every where will be NO! Under no circumstances can the government of the people of the United States allow Texas to revert to Mexico. We are bound by our stipulations with France in the treaty of 1803, to admit Texas into the Union as soon as possible, and to protect her against the encroachments of any power.3 It is true we made a treaty with Spain in 1819, and surrendered Texas without being aware of the binding obligations of our treaty of 1803, and consequently the cession of Texas to Spain is, in one sense, null and void, and Texas reverts to the United States, if it is still the wish of her people to come into the Union.4 The injudicious rejection of the treaty by the Senate cannot alter the state of affairs.5 Texas is ours, and the people will have it. In spite of secret as well as open opposition, by ill-advised 10 part i\n\nfriends and our enemies the federalists6 and abolitionists,7 there is a great, and growing, and animated spirit everywhere bursting forth in favor of Texas. In this state it burns with a steady and increased flame, which cannot be extinguished. Measures, however, must be taken forthwith to arrest the progress of Mexico. It has been asked whether it will be necessary to call Congress together to adopt measures to prevent Texas from falling a prey to her invaders. With the temper and disposition of the present Senate, nothing can be expected. The President has the power to protect the general interests of the country, and can order the forces of the southern division of the army towards the frontiers, and a naval force to rendezvouz at Galveston, to watch the movements of the enemy, and to act definitely whenever the people of Texas shall apply for aid. This is no time to talk of results or apprehensions of a war with Mexico. We are bound to prevent the fall of Texas, if we are wise, and we will do it at any hazard. notes 1. This transcription is taken from Walt Whitman, The Journalism, Volume I: 1834–1846, part of The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman, ed. Herbert Bergman, Douglas A. Noverr, and Edward J. Recchia (New York: Peter Lang, 1998), 196–197. Americans began to settle within the borders of Texas in 1821 when Moses Austin received permission from the Mexican government to bring 300 families, many who were slaveholders, into the Red River region. The population of Anglo-American slaveholders continued to grow in Texas throughout the early 1830s despite the Mexican government’s abolishment of slavery and closing of the Texas-U.S. frontier to further Anglo settlement in 1829. When, in 1835, President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna dissolved the Mexican Congress and instituted a military dictatorship, Texas (along with a number of other Mexican provinces) formed a provisional government, which, when the Mexican army sought to reestablish its authority there, declared Texas an independent republic. After the defeat of the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto (1836), Britain, France, and the United States officially recognized the independent Republic of Texas, which existed between 1836 and 1845, when it was annexed by the United States. K. Jack Bauer, The Mexican War: 1846–1848 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1974), 6–7. 2. Whitman here is fanning the flames of war with Mexico in line with the expansionist platform of the Democratic candidate for president in 1844, James K. Polk. Though the United States did not annex Texas until 1845, since February 1844 the administration of John Tyler had maneuvered American warships in Mexican waters, and Brevet Brigadier General Zachary Taylor had marched an expedition force to the border of Texas, ostensibly in defense of the independent republic. By the time Polk took his oath of office Democracy and Politics 11\n\nin March 1845, both houses of Congress had already voted in favor of annexation. Bauer, Mexican War, 7–9. 3. Portions of the Red River region in the Republic of Texas lay within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase Treaty of 1803. 4. Here Whitman attempts to explain away the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819, where the United States relinquished all claims to Texas in return for rights to Florida. See Philip Coolidge Brooks, Diplomacy and the Borderlands: The Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1939). 5. In April Secretary of State John C. Calhoun negotiated a treaty with the government of Texas for its annexation, though it failed to achieve two-thirds approval in the U.S. Senate. 6. Here Whitman refers to the Whig opponents to annexation by the name of the defunct elitist party of Alexander Hamilton and John Adams. 7. By 1844 the abolitionist press had been active for over a decade and inspired vehement opposition from both Southerners and Northerners. The best known of these publications, William Lloyd Garrison’s Liberator, had been banned from Southern mail; in 1835 Garrison himself was attacked in Boston by an anti-abolitionist mob. Abolitionists feared that the annexation of Texas would lead to the expansion of slavery beyond the boundaries of the Missouri Compromise (1820).\n\n12 part i\n\nAll Reforms in Government Must Come from the Democratic Impulse!1 Brooklyn Daily Eagle April 22, 1846\n\nIs not this true? Look back through the history of our nation, from the close of the Revolutionary war to the present moment, and deny it who can? Now we would not be considered one of those bigots2 that think there is no good in humanity, except what resides in some favorite school of faith—We believe in a general average of good. We think moreover that a very large portion of that so-called whig party,3 have much in common with the soundest and truest democracy. But the paramount feature stamped—ingrained, we may call it—in the public career of that party, has hitherto been, is, and doubtless will be, the very opposite of reform. —It is averse to innovation, loves the old rather than the new, and will not favor any “experiment.” —Therefore say we to the people of this island, that if the coming State Convention is to result in any real reform to the Constitution, it must be through the democratic impulse; and to give play for that impulse we must elect the Democratic Delegates. —What dependence is there upon the whigs? If we expect wholesome fruit, do we plant thistle-seeds?4 notes 1. Transcribed from scanned original, Brooklyn Public Library—Brooklyn Collection.

The American Whig Party had its origins in the fight over the rechartering of the National Bank during the first administration of Andrew Jackson. The name was originally Democracy and Politics 13\n\nused by the parliamentary forces that overthrew James II during the Glorious Revolution (1688), and, later, by American revolutionaries. The American Whigs took the name as a way to critique “King Andrew” Jackson and his heavy-handed use of the veto power. See Michael F. Holt, The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 27–28. While Democrats often painted Whigs as “an association of narrow-minded, silk-stocking patricians bent on telling other people how to behave,” the Whig Party successfully practiced populist campaign techniques in the election of 1840, where the Whig nominee, William Henry Harrison, defeated the incumbent, Martin Van Buren. Holt, 106–107, 190. 4. An important result of the 1846 constitutional convention, among others, was the election of state judges and a twenty-year cycle for proposing a constitutional convention on statewide ballots.

Indeed in all the late elections of importance, we have noticed the growing and acknowledged influence wielded by this branch of our party. They are rapidly taking precedence of those who are their betters by age. Whether this will be productive of benefits remains to be seen. If we may express our opinion, however, founded on deliberate surveyal of the political history of the past twenty years, we should say it would. Some writer has observed that most of the political reforms of modern times proceed from young men. A little thought will convince any “anxious inquirer” of the truth of this remark. In our party—the party of progress—it is especially necessary that each successive generation, which is supposed in many respects to be wiser than its immediate predecessor, should lift itself out as much as possible from that which has gone before it, act independently, and with a reliance as much as possible on itself, and its own judgment. Of course the lessons of the past are not to be despised. We may learn much from its experience, its tyranny, its ignorance, and its abominable bigotry. But the past, we often think, brings us more than enough evil to counterbalance its good. We rely too much upon it. We work our course through its example. We are afraid to trust in the fact that we are as men walking in daylight, while they were groping in the dimness of the early dawn—that we therefore are better than the men of old.3 The Democratic party, in all its civil disputes, has hitherto seen its more liberal portion come off victorious. The period of victory is merely a question of months. The staid old must in due time die off, and the ardent young must take their places—and the effect of this is, that we cannot hold any conservative opinions long. But the method of a change is worthy of attention. It is unseemingly that members of the same family should “scratch each others’ eyes,” and allow Democracy and Politics 15\n\nthe most exacerbated feelings of spite to operate in their intercourse. Besides, what good does it do? Abuse neither convinces men, or produces a happy effect on the neighboring spectators. notes 1.

This title might have had particular resonance for Whitman’s readers as it echoes popular democratic movements of this period like the Young Italy movement (1831) of Giuseppe Mazzini (1805–1872); the Young Hegelians, who inspired Karl Marx"
