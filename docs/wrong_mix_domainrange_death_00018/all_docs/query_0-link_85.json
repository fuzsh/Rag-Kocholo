A vast batch left to oblivion. — ^Whitman PREFACE Since 1914, when I began work on this book, I have often hoped that its appearance might coincide with the centennial of the poet's birth, and that it might thus serve as my stone to cast upon his cairn, which, I knew, would then swell under the contri- butions of many hands. But the World War — strange fulfil- ment of the prophecy in Whitman's \"Years of the Modem\" — taking me overseas for a year, delayed the completion of the work by so much, and more. Now that it is ready to print, I trust the poet will not find the peace of his rest diminished that I have added my stone to his grave. And yet I have been warned by some who claim special information in the matter that Whitman himself would hardly approve of such a work as this that I have done. However that may be, Whitman has al- ready had his ample say. The autobiographical ^'Leaves of Grass\" is, at least for those who have the clue to its meaning, his best in- terpretation; but he has also laid a shaping hand upon the bi- ographies of Burroughs, and Bucke, and Traubel, and (through these and his own often-quoted \"Specimen Days\") indirectly upon all others. There is a sphere for autobiography and another sphere for biography. The present volumes, tnough in no sense authorized by Whitman, are indeed far more autobiographical than biographical. In fact, they are autobiographical m the Whitman sense to a degree greater than the writings which he himself preserved. Somewhere — in one of the conversations with Horace Traubel — he registered an objection to autobi- ographies which, like Rousseau's \"Confessions,\" are deliberately planned in retrospect; such books should grow unconsciously, he said, like a diary. Now, from 1855 on. Whitman's autobi- ography did grow in this manner, keeping tally of his unfolding life; that was the principle on which he steadfasdy retained in it the expression of certain phases of his life even when he had hap- pily outgrown the passions which gave them meaning. But so far as the real evolution of the man who published the First Edition in 1855 is concerned, the record was never collected in any ade- quate way by himself; thus his autobiography is of two sorts, X PREFACE part retrospective and part introspective. I have compiled these volumes in the belief that, however a poet may elect to write about himself, the serious student should approach his life and work historically, examining both in accurate relation to the age in which he lived and wrote. For some reason Whitman seems to have preferred that his past, particularly the period before 1855 and certain later periods, should remain secret except in so far as he himself might be willing to illuminate it. That was, of course, the privilege of the living poet; but it is as clearly the duty of the biographer who writes long after his death to seek in that past, and especially in the literary records of that past, the true evolution of the man and the writer. There were two probable reasons why Whitman thus did his part in intensifying the shadow cast upon his youth and young manhood by the dis- proportionately brilliant light of those minute chronicles written by friends who had known him only in old age: (a) the early work of his pen was decidedly inferior and uninspired, and (b) Whitman found it congenial and convenient, as have most prophets, not only to cast in his lot with the future, but also rather sedulously to cultivate the obscurity of his own past. Moses must emerge from the desert and Mahomet from his mountain in order to obtain a hearing; Whitman followed a similar prophetic instinct in his efforts to make a picturesque and romantic wilderness of his own early environment. To that extent his autobiography as hitherto known is unrealistic. But it is more strange that among all the books that have been written about Whitman few have approached the study of his unique genius in a manner and with a method at once sympa- thetic and thorough. The great bulk of the writings preserved in this sourcebook appears never to have been examined by Whit- man's biographers at all, though such writings were obviously the place in which to discover the crescent poet, philosopher, and reformer. None of his biographers seems to know that he con- tributed to the Hempstead InquireVy the Long Island Democracy or the Long Island Farmer. I cannot discover that any but a few essayists, and they most cursorily, has made a personal ex- amination of his contributions, chiefly during his most formative years, to the Brooklyn Eaghy TimeSy or Uniony or to the New Orleans Crescenty or to the New York TribunCy Evening Pasty or Daily Graphic. It would seem that not many hours have been spent in searching for his war correspondence in the New oars SSittM^MliMriiaMIMHiiMH PREFACE XI. York TimeSy and students of Whitman have, one and all, been unaware that during the early years of the Civil War he contributed to the Brooklyn Standard a specially copyrighted series of articles on local history that would itself fill a fair- sized volume. Most biographers pay their passing respects to \"Franklin Evans,\" Whitman's dime novelette, and yet die tales \"Little Jane\" and \"The Death of Wind-Foot\" have always been given erroneous dates of composition notwithstanding the fact that they lie imbedded in this much-talked-of, but little- read, \"tendency\" novel. To point out these hiatuses in Whit- man biography is not to disparage the work of his biographers nor to minimize the importance of the light they have cast upon the problems involved. Few, perhaps none, of them have had opportunities for examining aJl the material contained in these volumes. And yet it seems to me that the time has come for a more thorough study of Whitman origins than any yet recorded. It is the attempt of the present publication to assist in the study of Whitman through an examination of his earlier and less- known writings, unguided by any preconceived notions of his youth drawn from his own maturer work or from the familiar character of the Camden sage, kindly and dignified but young no longer. Whatever value the book may have will therefore appear, not when tested by previous conceptions of Whitman's growth and character, but when employed as a test of those conceptions. If the work that I have done corrects old errors or if it substitutes facts for old guesses, my object will, in either case, have been accomplished. Specifically, my purpose has been to collect all of Whitman's magazine publicarions not found in his \"Complete Prose\" and to select trom his countless newspaper stories, book reviews, editorials, criticisms of art, music, drama, etc., such as have particular biographical or literary value, with such others as may be needed fairly to indicate his thought and style of com- position in each stage of his pre-poetic career. The volumes contain also the first publication of a considerable number of Whitman manuscripts which possess unusual value in the study of the genesis of his poetry. The Whitman notebooks are too numerous, and in some cases too illegible, to be presented here in their entirety; I have, however, included without omission or abridgment those which are the most important from the point of view of the present collection, i.^., those antedating 1855, and from the later ones I have extracted whatever seemed lii PREFACE to throw new or important light on Whitman problems, bio- graphical or critical. The complete set of these notebooks is now available to the student in the Library of Congress. . . . The only Whitman compositions known to me which, though falling under the principle of selection just stated, are not here in- cluded are his contributions to certain newspapers, like the Brooklyn Freeman^ of which diligent search has. as yet failed in locating any files or numbers, and a few manuscripts (such as <<An American Primer,\" \"Diary in Canada,\" \"Lafayette in Brooklyn,\" and \"Criticism: An Essay\") which have been pub- lished in fairly accessible booklets since the poet's death. The authenticity of the writings given in this collection is established by Whitman's signature (in a few cases that of his known nom de plume)y by the direct transmission of the manu- scripts through his literary executors or other responsible per- sons, or by such other evidence as is set forth in the footnotes to the various selections. In the case of newspapers for which Whitman was the sole editorial writer, the dates that bounded his editorship have been established beyond peradventure and selections made only from issues comprehended between those dates. A careful study has also been made, by way of verifica- tion, of all the internal evidence afforded by the selections themselves. Wth the exception of the excerpts from the Brooklyn TimeSy to the files of which I had only a limited access, and the digest of his book reviews in the EagUy nearly all the quotations have been made without any abridgment whatever. Nothing has been \"expurgated\" or altered in its meaning, and wherever a word or a passage has been omitted or inserted the fact has been indi- cated, omissions by asterisks and additions by brackets. But it has seemed to me that it would be unjust to Whitman and inconvenient for the reader should I preserve the punctuation exactly as it stands in the columns of die very inexpert journals of half a century and more ago, or that I should retain obvious typographical errors. Some commas which were not only superjfluous but obstructive I have omitted, and in a few cases I nave modernized other marks of punctuation where to do so would not alter the meaning except to make it clearer. But, believing that punctuation and spelling no less than phrase- ology and grammar have their place in revealing mental pro- ceties, I have preserved Whitman's eccentricities in regard to these except wnere I judged that they would be particularly PREFACE »ii baffling or irritating to the modern reader. All verse and manu- scripts have been given in faithful copy even to the point of retaining meaningless punctuation and fragments of sentences. To facilitate the use of the volumes by the Whitman student, I have added numerous footnotes, giving places and dates of publication, cross references, and such other information or in- terpretation as was deemed helpful toward an understanding of the text. In a few cases several Whitman utterances on a given subject, or in a series, have been placed in juxtaposition (out of dieir strict chronological order) that one might throw light upon another. The manuscripts which antedate the 1855 edition of the \"Leaves of Grass\" have been collated both with that edition and with the current authorized edition. Further- more, I have attempted, in two introductory essays, to evaluate all this heterogenous material and to render it accessible to various types of students, such as psychologists, genealogists, historians, students of American life, manners, journalism, and literature, and students of Whitman in particular. Space has been wanting, of course, to give a complete story of Whitman's life or to essay a comprehensive estimate of his work, but I have tried to point out the relation of this new material to the outstanding problems of Whitman biography and criticism. The definitive biography of Whitman, when it comes to be written, will make use of this material only in its just relation to what has hitherto been known; but here diere is opportunity to do little more than to index the material in the volumes in the form of two essays. The student who desires to examine in chronological order all the early writings of Whitman, including those preserved in the \"Complete Prose,\" is referred also to the bibliography which, in collaboradon with Mr. Henry S. Saunders, I prepared to accom- pany my chapter on this poet in the \"Cambridge History of American Literature,\" Volume H. In collecting material for such a sourcebook as this I have nat- urally been placed under manifold obligations both to libraries and to individuals. Of the former I desire to thank, in particu- lar, the Queens Borough Public Library, of Jamaica, Long Island, which repeatedly opened for me its rare files of the Long Island Democrat and of the Long Island Farmer; the Long Island Historical Society, of Brooklyn, for innumerable courte- sies during several years, including the supplying of files of the Brooklyn Star^ Eagle^ Advertizer, Standard, and Patriot, as well xiv PREFACE as many other rare and serviceable volumes; the Howard Me- morial Library and the Louisiana State Historical Society, of New Orleans, for giving me access to their files of the New Or- leans Crescent and for other services; the Brooklyn Public Library, the Pratt Library (Brooklyn), the Columbia Univer- sity Library, the library of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, the Li- brary of Congress, and especially the New York Public Library, without whose united assistance I could never have brought the present work to a state of even approximate completion. My indebtedness to individuals is likewise great. Not to mention by name the officials of the institutions just enumerated, I have been placed under obligation by the following persons: Mr. William Kernan Dart, of New Orleans, who kindly permitted me to read his article \"Walt Whitman in New Orleans\" while it was still in manuscript and who otherwise assisted me in iden- tifying some of Whitman's contributions to the Crescent; Mr. Herbert F. Gunnison, Mr. William H. Sutton, and Mr. A. J. Aubrey, of the Brooklyn Eagky for the highly appreciated court- esy of having unsealed for me many volumes of their journal which were not to be duplicated elsewhere, and for other ser- vices; Mr. Richard C. Ellsworth and Mr. George R. Rothwell, of the Brooklyn TimeSy for a similar kindness; Mrs. M. L. Val- entine, of New York, for permission to examine her large col- lection of Whitman manuscripts and to make use of one of them here; Mr. Louis L Haber and Mr. Alfred L. Goldsmith, also of New York, for permission to publish Whitman manuscripts which they own; Mr. Frank Hopkins, Mr. Max Breslow, Mr. Oscar Lion, the late Horace Traubel, Mrs. Orvetta Hall Bren- ton. Miss Rica Brenner, Mr. Edgar P. HoUoway, and Miss Mary HoUoway, for varied assistance; Mrs. Ina M. Seaborn, of London, Ontario, who placed me deeply in her debt by allowing me to make an extended examination of the great collection of Whitmaniana left by her father. Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke; Mr. Thomas B. Harned, a close friend and now the only sur- viving literary executor of Whitman, who generously placed in my hands, for use here and elsewhere, all the Whitman material that came to him under the poet's will, including the extremely interesting and valuable manuscript notebooks to which refer- ence has already been made, and who has offered me, for use as a frontispiece, the last unreproduced Gutekunst photograph of Whitman; Mr. Henry S. Saunders, of Toronto, who placed at my service his uncommonly large collection of Whitman k^BuAu mdam. PREFACE XV writings and who has rendered important and enthusiastic as- sistance in tracing some of the poet's very fugitive publications; Mr. G. G. Wyant and a certain anonymous reader, sometime connected with the Yale University Press, for helpful criticism; Professors John Erskine and Ashley H. Thorndike, of Columbia University; Professor Bliss Perry, of Harvard; and Professor Killis Campbell, of the University of Texas, and my colleague. Professor Edgar A. Hall, a suggestion from the first of whom was largely responsible for my undertaking, in a different form, the present research. Nor can one publish a collection similar to this without being made the debtor, in sundry ways, to that genial fraternity, the dealers in old and rare books. To no one, however, am I so much indebted as to my wife, who has prepared the Subject Index and who by years of varied assistance and encouraging faith has lightened a la- borious task. Brooklyn, 1920. (u^yyu^ny^ POSTSCRIPTUM The manuscript of the present work was already in the hands of its publishers when a selection from Whitman's writings in the Brooklyn Jiaily Eaghy entitled \"The Gathering of the Forces,\" appeared. Since the announcement of my intention to publish the results of the research offered to the reader herewith had antedated by some years the work of Messrs. Rodgers and Black, there was no occasion, as there was litde opportunity, for me to alter the principle on which I had in- cluded or excluded material. A very few minor changes have been made, however, as the book went through the press. Wherever possible I have consulted the reader's convenience by referring him to \"The Gathering of the Forces,\" rather than to the rare files of the Eagky for some material not reproduced here. i.:^ CONTENTS VOLUME I PAOI Introductory Essays I.

INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL I. ANCESTRYANDEARLYUFE(i8i9-i836) Our knowledge of Whitman's ancestry comes lai^ely from the poet himself. The blood of English, Dutch, and Welsh forbears blended in his veins, but it is obvious that he was proudest of his HoUandic stock. In his historical sketches of Brooklyn and Long Island ' he has much to say in praise of the physical sound- ness, the cleanliness, intelligence, and religion of the Dutch col- onists in New Amsterdam,* but very little to say about the English. Yet if the common sense, the sound judgment, the enterprise and patience, the slowness of movement and of thought, and the religious toleration of his Dutch (and Quaker) forbears were all to appear in the man and in his work, hardly less apparent were to be the tenacity of purpose and the mys- tical idealism of his English (New England) stock. As one reads the present volumes, these two ancestral strains will be found contending together for the mastery, or else, in moments of greatest achievement, uniting to create the \"Leaves of Grass,\" Whitman's maternal grandfather. Major Cornelius Van Vetsor, a prosperous farmer at Cold Spring, he describes as \"jovial, red, stout, with sonorous voice and characteristic physiognomy,\"* while his wife is pictured as being \"of sweet, sensible character, housewifely proclivities, and deeply intuitive and spiritual.\"* It is pleasant to see this wholesome couple in the simple country setting of the ghost story which Whitman, as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, culls for his readers from the stores of family legend.^ Both the Major and his sweet-tempered wife were 'The \" Brooklyniini,\" II, pp. iti-yi\\,ptiim. ■See n, pp. 5, 114-117, 300. 'Quoced from John Burrouglu in \"Complete Prose,\" p. 6. '\"An Incident on Lung Ulind Forty Years Ago,\" I, pp. 149-151. xxiv INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL of the Quaker persuasion, a fact which — chiefly through the poet's mother — came to influence his own character and writings. Major Van Velsor, like Walt's father, was a personal friend of Elias Hicks, whose home was at Jericho,^ not far from Cold Spring; and any anecdote concerning the Quaker leader was carefully preserved by Whitman.* It would seem, however, that the younger Whitman never went the whole way with the disciples of Fox; he did not believe, for instance, that the doc- trine of non-resistance could ever dominate the lives of men.' But he was at times powerfully influenced by what these reli- gious mystics call the \"inner light.\"* He even interpreted the Scriptures so much in the manner of the Friends as once to conceive of the spirit which inspires his own poetry as a rein- carnation of the soul of Jesus.* To him \"the divine Jew\" was the supreme character of the ages, but unique only in the degree of his divinity.* As to the genuine Quaker, so to him outward show and ceremonialism meant litde,^ creed and dogma no more.* He detested the doctrinal bickering of the sects,* mnce to him religion was always the simple spirit of reverence and direct communion with an immanent deity that it was to the Hicksite Quaker; he looked upon religion as a mode of living rather than as a phase of life.^® If we may judge by the great number of his allusions and quotations, the Bible ^^ was one of the chief sources of his inspiration, Shakespeare^^ being its only close rival.

INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xxv Whitman's memory for dates is seldom worthy of implicit trust, but when he says^ that his father moved the family to Brooklyn in May, 1823, he is at least approximately correct.' Except for summer excursions to the Island, the poet spent his boyhood in Brooklyn, then a village small and primitive enough' for his curious eyes to have explored all its picturesque corners^ and to have been familiar with all its leading person- ages.^ As a sturdy lad of six, he stood in line among his school- fellows to await the arrival of that hero of the Revolution who was by chance to lay upon him the \"sacred hands\"* of a Eatriot.'^ This act of Lafayette's can scarcely be said, in the ght of the original story (told in 1857),' to have had any refer- ence to the boy's character or appearance; nevertheless it seems to have lingered in the latter's mind with the significance of a Erophetic symbol. At any rate, it was several times repeated y him' — not, it must be admitted, without a natural increment of sentimental detail. We next see the idle and mischievous boyi® throwing brickbats into the mulberry trees in Nassau Street, unafraid of being driven away by the good-natured ladies who owned them and unmindful how near his missiles might fall to the heads of unwary pedestrians.^^ And doubtless he was with the rest of the village urchins when they went, equipped with bent pin and tow string, to angle for \"killy-fish\" in the stagnant marches of the Wallabout, long since obliterated by the construction of the City Park.^^ On Sundays he attended the Dutch Reformed Sunday School in the old-fashionfed, gray stone church on Joralemon Street^' as later he was to study human nature from his vantage-point in the galleries of the Sands Street Methodist Church during the hey-day of the old-time revivals.^* The fervour with which the revival hymns were sung may have given him some early ideas of the power of song to fuse the sentiments of a people.^^ Whether 1 See II, p. 86.

In the latter half of his life Whitman seldom went to church, but it would seem that he had no deep prejudice against the institution when he was younger. He was on good terms with the ministers' and not infrequently surrendered the editorial columns of the Eagle for long reports of their sermons,* and as editor advised the building of more houses of worship* and recommended attendance upon divine service.* At times he even looked upon himself, in inspired moments, as the founder of a new religion or cultus,^ though not, to be sure, of an institutionalized church.® On week days the boy attended the public school in Sands Street,' where, however, the only incident that impressed him as worthy of later record was his hearing the explosion that wrecked the Frigate Fubon (June, 1829) in the Navy Yard *Sce II, p. 293. 'If so, it was probably not the type of conversion in which a sense of sin predominates for he once said to Horace Traubel: \"I never, never was troubled to know whether I would be saved or lost: what was that to me?\" (\"With Walt Whitman in Camden,\" UI, p. 494.)

In the 1830's the schools, like the newspapers, were, of course, far below modem standards. When Whitman studied the public school as teacher and as a self-appointed editorial inspector, he came to realize how poor they often were. Possibly he had sensed this even as a pupil. Apparently he had not made much use, however, of what educational opportunities he had at school. A granddaughter of his Brooklyn schoolmaster, Miss Theodora Goldsmith, Lady Principal of the Adelphi Academy, writes me: \"He [Whit- man] was a boy in Sands Street school, now called Public School No. x, some time during the thirties. My grandfather, Benjamin Buel Halleck, was a teacher for ten or a dozen years in that school and for a part of the time principal as well. He remembered Walt Whitman as a big, good-natured lad, clumsy and slovenly in appearance, but not other- wise remarkable. My grandfather was surprised when Walt proved, long afterwards, to be a poet, saying: 'We need never be discouraged over anyone.*\" Whitman had his own method of self-education, as will appear in this essay and in the one which follows; but he always exerted as much influence as he possessed in securing a higher standard of schools for others, whether secondary or higher, in dty or country.

INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xxvii close by.* A few days later he followed, boy-like, the funeral procession of an officer slain on the Fulton^ only to have his sensitive nature offended when the band, which had approached the cemetery with all the impressive solemnity of a naval funeral, marched off to the tune of a lively jig.* Whitman seems to have spent much of his time, both as boy and as man, in loitering in burial grounds, whether in the city or in the country, meditating much, as from the first he was to write much, on the problems of death and the grave.' It would be far from accurate, however, to describe him as a moody lad, obsessed with gloomy thoughts. It was doubtless first-hand knowledge that he had of the village entertainments which he recalled in the \"Brooklyniana\" sketches thirty years later — the balls, parties, sleigh rides, lectures, concerts, itinerant shows, singing schools,^ or special celebrations.^ Either Whitman had left school by 1830, at the age of eleven,* or else he began work as office and errand boy to \"Lawyer Clarke\" during a vacation period. Neither this employment nor that in the office of the unnamed doctor mentioned by Bucke^ could have been of very long duration, for in the next summer the office boy was to become printer's devil for the Long Island Patriot^ in the office of which he was to learn from that venerable printer, William Hartshorne, \"the craft preservative of all crafts.\"' It has not been sufficiently emphasized that during his more formative years Whitman's vantage point for looking at life was nearly always a newspaper office,' except when it was some favourite spot in nature.

The rever- ence thus engendered for Washington, in particular, was in the boy and young man littie less than religious.' His own pro- phetic mission, when it should be announced to him, was thus predestined to take on a patriotic significance, ^th the pro- prietor of the PiUrioty Samuel E. Clements,* a \"hawk-nosed Southerner,\" the young apprentice was on good terms and was taken riding by him on Sundays.* From Clements Whitman doubtiess received his first ideas of the South, and perhaps from him adopted the arguments in defence of slavery which he was to introduce into his hastily written \"Franklin Evans\"* (1842). In the Patriot office he also became acquainted with Henry C. Murphy, later to prove influential in local politics, to be elected repeatedly to Congress, and to be sent as minister to The Hague.^ The law firm of Murphy, Lott, and Vanderbilt, it is said, shaped very largely the policies of the Eagle; it may have been there- fore that Whitman's early friendship for Murphy in the Patriot office had something to do with the former's selection, in 1846, as editor of the Eagle, His loss of that editorship, in any case, was due to his opposition to the conservative Murphy faction of the Democratic Party' — to this and to some dissatisfaction on the part of the Eaglets proprietor, Isaac Van Anden, with Whitman's irregularity in performing his editorial duties. Though Murphy had been a cause of his losing so comfortable a berth,® Whitman was willing to write a very laudatory sketch of the politician for the Brooklyn Times in 1857.^® Precisely what Whitman did after leaving the Patriot is not clear. \"I was at Worthington's in the summer of '32,\" he records.^^ This *Scc II, p. 047. «Scc II, pp. 246-247. •Sec I, pp. 22, 72-78, 95, 118, 197, 246; cf, II, pp. 2-3, 284-288. * Sec I, p. 234, note, II, pp. 3-4, 9, note 3, 86, 248-249, 294. •See \"Complete Phmc,\" p. 10.

INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xxix Worthington was probably another printer, and perhaps at the time postmaster as well.i With him, however, Whitman remained only a few months, for in the fall he went to work as printer's devil on Col. Alden Spooner's Long Island Star^ a Whig organ published weekly.* He was still doing odd jobs for the Star when his family returned to the Island to live, in 1833.* He joined the family for a short period in 1836,* but where he was and what he was doing in the three intervening years we can only surmise. Perhaps he remained with Spooner later than 1833. But this, rather than the date he gives^ (1836-7), must have been the period in which he wandered as a journeyman compositor to the larger and more fascinating city across the East River. In that case it is not unlikely that he himself had at that time the difficulties in finding a boarding-house which are reflected in the experience of Franklin Evans.* In 1835 *^ was not easy, it seems, to discover an inex- Eensive room in the home of a family diat was clean, that ad young children about, and that did not make attendance upon family worship obligatory. Much of the poet's life was to be spent in boarding-houses and hotels,^ a fact which doubt- less had its influence in shaping his rather detached attitude toward the family as an institution. At this time he was making the acquaintance of the theatre and the opera,^ both of which were to have much to do in his education. A naively conde- scending exposition of the latter forms the theme of one of his earliest manuscripts.' Of the theatre and the opera he made a serious study however impressionistic it may have been, and prepared himself by reading the play or libretto in advance.^® *See II, p. 296, note. *See II, pp. 86, 246. \"See II, p. 86. ^Ikidem, '\"Complete Prose,\" p. 10.

LONG ISLAND (i 836-1 841) We can only guess the reason which influenced Whitman, in 1836, to turn his back on the city which had fascinated him with its varied sights and which, through its opportunities for self- education in newspaper office, theatre, opera, amateur theatri- cals, and multitudinous human contacts, had generated in him a deep but ill-defined ambition. If, as I believe, \"The Shadow and the Light of a Young Man's Soul\"^ be largely autobio- graphical, perhaps it suggests the cause of Whitman's five-year absence from New York; he may have been, like Archie Dean, simply out of employment.^ For it was unemployment, he tells us, that drove most of the country school-teachers to their unremunerative if not uncongenial tasks.' Or he may have made his customary summer visit to his relatives, intending to enjoy such natural beauties as the season and the Island af- forded, and from this he may have drifted into school-teaching in the same casual manner in which he seemed to drift from newspaper to newspaper. A glance at his photograph of this period* is sufficient to discover in him that \" want of energy and resolution\"* which he ascribed to Archie Dean. He was ambi- tious, as I have said, but not wholesomely or happily so, for he was proud, disinclined to steady work, and prone to feel that the labour dictated by necessity was somehow beneath his ca- pacity.* Each has his care; old age fears death; The young man's ills are pride, desire. And heart-sickness, and in his breast The heat of passion's fire.7 It was natural for him to shift from district to district, seeking novelty where advancement was impossible. Within five years he had taught seven schools, besides editing one paper for eight or ten months and writing for others.' These frequent changes *See I, pp. 229-234. *Sce I, pp. 229-231.

On the whole they were fortunate, for they not only brought him into contact with the various phases of life on the Island,' but likewise taught him the solid worth and common sense of the self-reliant country folk and of the middle classes,^ a lesson which he had scarcely learned, or was likely to learn, in the east- ern cities.* In celebrating the \"divine average\" the poet began with the small farmer rather than with the industrial proleta- riat. But in electing to spend the years from seventeen to twenty-two in the country, this sensitive, inclusive, mystical bard derived another benefit. It meant that he would develop more slowly but more sanely. A Walt Whitman without poise,^ balance, would be inconsequential indeed. The chief significance of his \"boarding round\" among the rather illiterate Islanders, of his attendance upon country frolics^ clam bakes,' fishing and sailing parties,' of his solitary walks by day or night, and of his long rides,^^ is therefore to be sought in the whole spirit and conception of the \"Leaves of Grass\" no less than in the pages of reminiscent prose in the \"Brooklyniana\" sketches or in the \"Letters from Paumanok.\"\" What merits Whitman's experimental Long Islander may have had we cannot know, for, though the paper still flourishes, there seems to exist no file running back to the days of his connec- tion with it. A contemporary sheet, however, chanced to pre- serve for us mere samples of his prose ^' and verse ^' quoted from the Huntington weekly. They are nothing of which a nineteen- or twenty-year-old boy without appreciable schooling needed to be ashamed, yet they constitute no unanswerable argument why their author should not have been replaced by another editor when he grew hopelessly irregular in mounting his 'In point of information Whitman was probably as well equipped as the average country teacher of his day, for the small salary paid — twenty years later, it was only forty or fifty dollars a quarter, exclusive of board — could not command the masters of a pretentious curriculum.

It is likely that the Long Islander experience was helpful in securing for Whitman the first, impermanent editorial positions in the city after his return.' By the fall of 1839, as we have seen, he found it necessary to return to school-teaching, that stand-by of budding Ameri- can genius. But as his ambition for a journalistic, if not a literary, career was growing more definite, he this time efiPected a compromise which permitted him to oscillate between the school-house and the printing-office. Whitman lived in the family of James J. Brenton, in the village of Jamiuca, who edited and published the weekly Long Island Democrat^ for which the young journalist worked as typesetter and as contributor at such times as he was not occupied at his school a short distance down the Flushing road. The combination of teaching and journalism, however, seems to have had little influence upon his writing while at Jamaica other than to have suggested the caption for a series of very immature essays. Not one of the \"Sun-Down Papers from the Desk of a Schoolmaster\"' refers to school matters, but all are frankly didactic in manner. Though only seven of these have come to light,* there were apparently eleven in all.^ Ten poems complete the publica- tions of the Jamaica period. The connection with Mr. Brenton was on the whole very beneficial to Whitman. The older jour- nalist had faith in him as a writer and encouraged him, both then and through the varying fortunes of later years.* In the Democrat office Whitman doubdess learned something about the management of a newspaper, he had an opportunity to publish his juvenilia pretty regularly,^ and he had access to a circulating library of four hundred volumes.* It appears that the youth also knew at that time Henry Onderdonck, Jr.,* the iSee II, p. 87; ef, \"Complete Prose/' p. 188. •See II, pp. 87^8. *See I, pp. 32-51. ^Including one copied from the Hempstead Inquirer and one published in the other Jamaica weddy, the Long Island Farmer, *The series was numbered. *Brenton included Whitman's sentimental sketch, \"Tomb-Blossoms,\" in the \"Voices from the Press,\" which he published in 1850, and through the Democrat congratulated Whitman whenever the latter obtained a new editorial position.

Concerning Whitman's domestic life at this period, little is known,^ but clearly he was already going his own strange, self- ^New and welcome light is thrown upon this period of Whitman's life by a letter to me from Mn, Orvetta Hall Brenton, daughter-in-law of Whitman's Jamaica employer. Some allowance will have to be made, in reading it, for inaccuracy in detail, since it was based on conversations that took place about forty years ago, but it preserves at least the household tradition of Whitman and doubtless gives a fairly true picture. I omit only the general introductory paragraph. \"Whitman was a very young man when he became a member of the Brenton household at Jamaica to learn the printing trade from my father-in-law at the office of the Long IsUaul Democrat, It u not possible, however, for me to verify your dates of 1839 or 1840. This definite information might be found in the files of the Long Island Democrat at Jamaica. My husband's parents died some thirty-five years ago, and my husband was too young when Whitman lived at the house to remember much about him. \"My mother-in-law, hfrs. Brenton, was a practical, busy. New England woman, and very obviously, from her remarks about Whitman, cared very littie for him and held him in scant respect. He was at that time a dreamy, impracticable youth, who did very fittle work and who was always 'under foot' and in the way. Except that he was ai- ways in evidence physically, he lived his life very much to himself. One thing that impressed Mrs. Brenton unfavorably was his disregard of the two children of the house- hold — two small boys — who seemed very much to annoy him when they were with him in the house. \"Birs. Brenton ahrajrs emphasized, when speaking of Whitman, that he was inordi- nately indolent and lazy and had a very pronouncni disinclination to work! During some of the time he was in the household, the apple trees in the garden were in bloom. When Whitman would come from the printing office and finish the mid-day dinner, he would go out into the garden, lie on his back under the apple tree, and forget every- thing about going back to work as he gazed up at the blossoms and the sky. Frequendy, at such times, Mr. Brenner would wait for him at the office for an hour or two and then •end the 'printer's devil' up to the house to see what had become of him. He would invariably be found still lying on his back on the grass looking into the tree entirely ob- fivioos of the fact that he was expected to be at work. When spoken to, he would get op refaxctantly and go slowly back to the shop. At the end of such a day, Mr. Brenton would come home and say, 'Walt has been of very litde help to me to-day. I wonder what I can do to make him realize that he must work for a living?' and Mrs. Brenton would remark, 'I don't see why he doesn't catch his death of cold lying there on the ground under that apple tree!' \"Whitman was such an annoyance in the household that Mrs. Brenton was overjoyed when he finally decided to leave the office of the Democrat. Mr. Brenton, however, was sorry to have him go, for, even in those early days, he showed marked ability as a writer and was of great value to the 'literary' end of the newspaper work. How long he was in Jamaica, or what salary he received, I do not know. Of course, in those days, a cons i derable part of the salary consisted in ' board and lodgings.' \"I do not thmk he attended school at all at Jamaica, and I do not know where he first taught school, but I have always been under the impression that it was at, or near, Huntington. \"Another detail comes to mind in regard to his behavior in the house. He cared nothing at all about clothes or his personal appearance, and was actually untidy about hit persoo. He would annoy Mrs. Brenton exceedingly by 'sitting around' in his shirt •leeves, and seemed much abused when she insisted on his putting on his coat to come to the fiunily table.

Ultimately he found a way to recon- cile the world of his fancy with the equally wondrous world of his senses — a \"path between reality and the soul\"; but his Jamaica days knew the distraction of dwelling in two discon- nected realms at once. His fondness for loafing and inviting his souV already becoming pronounced, accounts for what success he was to attain both as seer and poet, as well as for what nu- merous failures he was to experience as a professional writer. But he was as yet less a \"kosmos\" than a chaos. Though his nature was never to conform to a really simple character type, certain later experiences, mystical or practical, were to charge him with a dominating purpose, single and powerful enough to impel, to fortify, and to encourage;* but at twenty he was un- able to fuse and focalize his desires on any of the ordinary ob- jects of human endeavour, whereas the extraordinary end of his singular existence was still but a tantalizing adumbration.' During a part of Whitman's residence at Jamaica he had taken an active interest in politics. The warfare of political parties was still a new and exciting game in America, and Walt's patriotic upbringing and his fondness for addressing himself direcdy to the people* insured his participation in it sooner or later. Webster's oratory never left much impression on his memory,* yet it may have been the speech which the eloquent senator delivered in Jamaica on September 24, 1840, that stimu- door where Mrs. Brenton had to pass him every time she wished to get the dishes and stumble continually over his feet. He would never think to remove his feet from the pathway until requested definitely to do so, nor would he move at all out of the way unless he was told to. \"I am sorry I cannot tell you more. My impression has alwajrs been of a dreamy, quiet, morose young man, evidently not at aJl in tune with his surroundings and feeling, somehow, that fate had dealt hard blows to him. I never heard him spoken of as being in any way bright or cheerful. I cannot see how he could have been an interesting or suc- cessful teacher because of hit apparent dislike of children at the time we knew him. I never heard a word against his habia. He spent most of the time off duty reading by the fire in the winter or out of doors dreaming in the summer. He was a genius who lived apparently, in a world of his own. He certainly was detached enough nom the Brenton household at Jamaica.\" » See I, pp. 44-46; II, p. 314. *See \"A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads,\" \"Leaves of Grass,\" 1917, III, 44- See also II, p. 60. *lhidem (first reference). ^ See I, p. 115. •See \"With Walt Whitman in Camden,\" III, pp. 175-176. ' INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xxxv lated lum to active political enthusiasm, for he was himself electioneering in Queens County that fall.^ By July 29, 1 841 , he had so far ingradated himself with the Tammany organization as to be selected as one of the speakers to address a mass meet- ing of some ten thousand persons in the Park (now City Hall Park) in New York;* and by 1848 he was politically important enough to be appointed one of Brooklyn's fifteen delegates to die Free-scnl Convention which met that year in Buffalo.' But in time his interest, thoueh always enlisted in political causes, ceased to be attracted (ifindeed there had ever been any seri- ous attraction) to a political career. Even had he chosen to deliver his *' Leaves of Grass'' message through the spoken instead of the written word, it is improbable that Whitman could ever have become a great orator. He thought too slowly to adapt himself to the exigencies of impromptu eloquence.^ But if he did not have the talents of an orator, he nevertheless had the instincts of one. His most successful prose is vibrant with declamatory periods,* while all his serious writing is an cflFbrt to address himself more or less personally to his reader.* That his patriotism was idealistic rather than time-serving is sofficiendy indicated by the single fragmentary speech that has come down to us' and by the occasional patriotic odes pub- lished in his vouth.* His political power lay in his sound and dinnterested judgment* and in his fearless public spirit. The sentimental eagle-screaming of the odes just mentioned was nothing novel in that platitudinous age, but Whitman fell into it the more readily, no doubt, because his personal sentiment had found inadequate means of expression. That strong ama- tive nature which was to get itself recorded fifteen years later iSeeII,p.87. 'See I, p. 51 note.

He seems to have found no one at this period, however, who could under- stand or respond satisfyingly to his mystical hunger for affection. Archie Dean had a confidant in his mother, but Whitman's mother, though doubtless die best friend of his youth, found him as much a mystery as did the rest, and could only ponder in her heart the strange nature of her son.^ As we have seen, he was too much of a dreamer to fit comfortably into the practical New England household of the Brentons, while his Quaker liberality of religious views sometimes caused him to be looked at askance by the orthodox Long Islanders.' His life must have been devoid even of any intimate friendship with the young of either sex, for his verse insistendy complains that Luckless love pines on unknown.' Despairing of ever finding a lover on earth, he at times longs, as the unrequited affection of youth has taught many a poet to long, for death, that in another world a spirit may perchance be found to mate with his.* Thus he who was to become the poet of joy and of absorbing affection began his singing with melan- cholv chants of despair and the grave.* The dream of death as a release from an unhappy life persisted with him for years.* Often it is tragic death that he describes,^ sometimes the death of youth and innocence, fit for flowers and sentimentalizing.* He dallies with the idea in the introverted luxury of his loneli- ness, even going so far as to imagine an ideal death scene for himself amidst the nature that he loved.* It is well not to take these poems too seriously, however, for, profoundly self-reveal- ing though they be. Whitman's native caution probably re- minded him from the first that they were only idle dreams.^* This unreciprocated affection did more than to make the poet moody; it made him humanitarian. Had the youth met a Mrs. Stannard or a Miss Royster, like Poe, his later celebration of affection might have been more often personal and less often »See \"In Re Walt Whitman\" (Traubd, Horace, ed.), p. 34; »!» \"With Wait Whit- man in Camden,\" III, p. 538. *See \"Walt Whitman Fellowship Paper,\" No. 14. * See I, p. 10. ^See I, pp. 9-xa 'See sn/nt, p. xxvu, note 3. *Ikidim, »£. g., I, pp. 8-9, 12-13, 51-60. •£. r,, I, pp. 35-37.

But as it was, his affection waa to become most charactenstic when most indefinite, atmospheric, impersonal.' He professed to take no stock in the romantic sentiments as described by Byron and Bulwer,* and when he urged upon mankind the duty of brotherly love he meant simply \"that healthy, cheerful feeling of kindness and good will, an affectionate tenderness, a warm-heartedness, the germs of which are plentifully sown by God in each human heart.\"* Thus ungratified desire finds a temporary relief in sublimated ex- pression, and the youthful writer naively follows a deep instinct in preaching against impulses which he subconsciously fears. Whitman the reformer sometimes had himself for his most interested and susceptible audience.* When he plunged with extravagant zeal into the various reform movements dliat were sweeping over the country in the 1 840' s, and excoriated the users of even tea, coffee, and tobacco' — as later he was to speak out against less venial sins — he probably did not realize it, so blame- less were his own habits at the rime, but it was the puritan in him challenging to a long and tragic struggle the \"caresser of life.\"' Growii^ out of the causes of unrest which I have mentioned, itself perhaps a greater cause of unrest than any other, was Whitman's fermcnring literary ambidon. It became the stronger because it promised to satisfy his other de«res. The political idealist, the dogmatic teacher, the priest of brotherly love, the social reformer, the dreaming poet, and the original artist might conceivably combine in the writer, though the world would have to wait fifteen years to leam just what unique sort of book such a writer would bring forth. At first the pros- pect of a career entered upon from motives of worldly ambition seemed vain and unworthy.'

Whitman felt that the wilderness temptation would bear reconsideration. He began to dream of a book which was one day to make him famous.^ It is interesting to note that originally the intent of the book is philosophical (perhaps religious) rather than artistic, that no novelty of form is mentioned, and that in it the treat- ment of romance and sex, which later came to have such import- ance in the plan of the ''Leaves of Grass,\" was to be definitely and totally excluded because of complete ignorance on the part of the prospective author.* The plan of the book was as yet very hazy in Whitman's mind,' but he intends its burden to t>e a caution against what he afterward called \"the mania of owning things/* In this he was probably too sincere to realize that by adding the vow of poverty to those of chastity and charity he was justifying to himself, not only his absorption in a mystical contemplation of the universe, but also his constitutional anti- pathy to the sort of routine application which accumulates the goods of this world. Anyway, this child certainly was father of the Brooklyn carpenter who is said to have turned his back on fairly profitable house-building in order to publish, ugain and again, a volume of poems that would not sell. This early announcement that, if the world would but have patience, Nazareth should yet produce her prophet affords, in its amusing mixture of modesty and naive egotism, a suggestive glimpse of the process whereby the affection of a gifted man, turned inward upon himself for want of other object, produces the artist and benefactor of mankind. It also warrants us in tracing the con^ scious genesis of the ''Leaves of Grass\" farther back in the life of its author than has commonly been done. It would seem, in- deed, that Whitman's conception of truth was already trans- cendental and that he was acquiunted with some simpler type of mystical ecstasy.' But to suppose that the young man was always inditing in his heart such weighty matters would be to n^lect that other side of his nature which took uncommon delight in physical sen- sations and personal experiences as such. He attended coun- try celebrations,' entered with zest into the spirit of picnic *See I, pp. 37-39. ^Ikidem, *See \" A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads,\" in \"Leaves of Grass,\" 1917,111, p.44. *Sce I, pp. 37-39.

INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL mux excumons to the Great South Bay,' occasionally visited New York,* and mingled with every class of people. Once he wrote a bit of absurd dc^gerel, perhaps descriptive of himself.' Agun, he preceded Stevenson oy a generation in writing a frank and unabashed apolc^ for idlers — philosophic idlers — like himself.* Clcariy his feet were already set on the Open Road, and hence- forth neither man nor woman would be able long to detain him in his journey through These States as a vagabond prophet of art, religion, and democracy. If in these Jamaica stcetches he appears to lack reverence for man and for man-made conven- tions, it cannot be s^d that he was deficient in that sense of re- ligious awe which Carlyle always discovered in his heroes, whether men of letters or founders of religions.* 3. NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN (1841-1848) If it was fortunate that the nascent poet could spend the years between seventeen and twenty-two amidst the simple, whole- some conditions of country life, where, under the influence of work and play, of human contact and mystical meditation, he might with Dutch thoroughness lay the foundation of his future he^th and character, perhaps it was equally to be desired that the coming bard of democracy should spend the foUoiring years of his protracted youth in the heart of the metropolis. Con- cemit^ the next seven years of his life we know little except what Whitman has seen fit to tell us in his own writings or what has caudously been entrusted to his biographers. Some of these writings have only recendy come to light, and the mass of them — particularly the newspaper editorials — have never been given a really thorough examination by any competent person. Such neglect can no longer be excused by blanket allusions to the banality of his early prose; for whether a poet begin his success- ful singing at twenty or at thirty-five, the third decade of his life is always bit^raphically important The elements of Whitman's nature which were beginning' to emerge into consciousness during the last period now assume more definiteness of expression.

'See I, pp. ¥>-4i- xl INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL though it is not known that at this time he found any lasting lover or friend. His transcendental faith in the goodness and trustworthiness of nature now b^ins to lead him into spheres of indulgence that were in marked contrast to the asceticism of the previous period — spheres from which he later withdrew with aversion if not regret.^ But all these experiences were the education of the poet, and they help to explain the weltschmerz and the discernment in his verse. In the preceding period he had slowly realized that his calling was literature; now ne b^ins that intimate connection with newspapers, magazines, and books which one must look upon as constituting his chief apprenticeship as a writer. Of course Whitman's tenure of office in the news- paper world was likely to be no more permanent than in the less exacting realm of country schools. According to his own record he was connected — as compositor, contributor, or editor — with nine newspapers or literary journals in eight years,' besides writing a novelette and contributing to four magazines. If the ordinary criteria of success be applied, this was, without doubt, a bad record; but if Whitman's peculiar mission was, first, to be in himself a synthesis of life m America during the turbu- lent nineteenth century and, second, to express that life in a book more or less suggestive of its youth, its energy, its flowing picturesqueness, and its crude democracy, then the constant shifts whereby he was enabled to study life and nature from a multiplex viewpoint were, in the main, not only beneficial but absolutely necessary. During this period the youthful bigotry evidenced in his fondness for lecturing the world is gradually qualified by an increasing receptiveness to new and diverse im- pressions, until the dme for his first true oracular expression comes in 1 847-1 848. No conventional duty is allowed to inter- rupt his lifelong habit of strolling amidst his kind — observing, sympathidng, \"absorbing'' — and thus forming, against the day of his authentic poetic utterance, the subconscious mystical synthesis to which I have referred. Thus his famous \"cata- logues,\" which appeared in his prose before they were incor- porated in his verse,' assume a significance that is biographical as well as artistic. He missed nothing that was to be seen. He attended the theatre and the opera;^ he studied the fairs and *Sec Bliss Perry, loc, eit., pp. 151-152. *See infra^ p. xxvii, note 9. * See /or/, pp. fadi-lziu. «See I, pp. 143-144, 1521-154. i5^«58» ^SS^^SSl H, pp. 97-w«. «48; •!» \"The Gathering of the Forces,\" II, pp. 349-351 j 359- INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xli exhibidons;^ he patronized the public baths;' he was familiar with all the police courts and the slums;* he wrote crude special articles on Sing Sing,^ on the hospitals,^ the asylums,* the schools;^ he attended picnics,* went on steamboat and railway excursions,* and was present to take part in political meet- ings and celebrations.^® He attended lectures\" and concerts,\" gazed in awe at the great city fires,\" and loitered amidst the flipping\" and on the ferries.\" Wherever human life was \"magnificently moving in vast masses,\" there was he to feel and absorb it. It was no accident, therefore, that he should have found much to attract and inspire him in the \"average man \" of the city, even as he had discovered the more obvious virtues of the countryman. His own life is still, as always, fundamentally complex. He can resist anything better than his own \"diversity,\" which has as yet prevented any blending of his sentimental dreams of the past with his heroic prophecies of the future.

But, on the other hand, he cries out for progress along various lines and himself seeks to lead the way. Thus he was learning to be, not only a voice of the present complexity, but a link between the past achievement and the future hope. At the same time that he was growing to be a reformer without a party, an artist with- out a school, and a prophet without a cult, he was also translat- ing into the ''American'' language wisdom as old as the world. Not one of Whitman's contributions to the Aurora^ the «S«», the Tattler y the Statesman^ or the Democrat (all of New York) has as yet been unearthed; but fortunately we have complete files of the Brooklyn Eagle during the two years of his editorship. These old numbers of the Eagle make it clear that here as else- where Whitman was himself first and newspaper functionary afterward. And yet — perhaps for that very reason — it can be said that, like Greeley and Bennett, he went beyond the cur- rent conception of editorial opportunity and responsibility.' Had his training fitted him for such a hearing as Greeley or Bryant obtained through the Tribune and the Evening Posfy his influence upon journalism might have been as wide as his policy was far-sighted and individual. For to him a newspaper was a living thing, its readers individual human beings.^ Sometimes his journal is the scourge of reform, purg- ing the temple of democracy;* sometimes it is an Adienian forum, resounding with discussions of the basic principles of good government;* at other times it is a humanitarian pulpit, defending the ignorant, the weak, the helpless;^ now it is a college class-room, in which books are sifted and appraised, and their treasures disclosed;® now it is itself a miniature li- brary, stocked with poems, tales, novelettes, extracts, or ** Sab- bath reading\";* again it is a political stump, from which the editor urges the claims of candidate or party with a vehemence > Sec I, pp. aa-ij, 72-78, 95-96, 117-118. *Sce I, pp. 91-97. \"See I, pp. 115-117, 137; Brooklyn Daily Eagle ^ September 29, 1846. <See I, p. 115. •See I, pp. 106-108, 108-110, 121-113, 125-126, 137, 152-154, 156, 162-163, 168-170. ■See I, pp. 159-160, 166-168; Brooklyn Daily EagU, December I4, 1846; al9o**The Gathering of the Forces,\" I, pp. 57-^4.

No paper in the city, I think, attempted to cultivate so large a field of usefulness. If Whitman was often out of the editorial ofiice, it was to become his own reporter, for he had none. If he n^lected or ignored party politics at times, he was acting as his own musical or dramatic critic. If he occasionally broke away from the confinement of the city and had a loiter over the Island, he was at once renewing his youth and awaken- ing his self-interested city readers with country correspond- ence.' His style often left much to be desired, but certainly it was fresher and dealt with more important journalistic matter than was to be found in the pages of any Brooklyn contempo- rary. If the circulation of the Eagle really decreased during his editorship, as it is said to have done,^ that fact no more dis- proves the value of Whitman's innovations than the popular n^lect of the 1855 edition of the \"Leaves of Grass** accurately rates the worth of that highly original book. However, the employer watched the \"ninepences\"* and laid store by them even if the editor did not, and so the time came when Whitman's intractability, when he swung the paper vigorously in line with the radical Barnburner or Free-soil wing of the party, gave Mr. Van Anden and the conservative bosses of the party a welcome opportunity to replace him with S. G. Arnold,* a more correct, conventional,^ and docile editor.^ The doggedness with which Whitman later issued his ^^Leaves,\" refusing to be persuaded, either by Emerson or by the Attorney General of Massachusetts, > See I, pp. 160-162,171-174; also ** The Gathering of the Forces,\" 11, pp. a-45. \"See I, pp. 114-115, 141-144, 151-152, etc.; alBo\"The Gathering of the Forces,\" I, pp. 25-06, 17-18. *See I, pp. 174-181. «By W.

Here he was right on nearly every question of public interest, he conscien- tiously strove to elevate the standards and to enlarge the whole- some influence of the press, he was public-spirited and fearless, and he knew not how to turn back from a course deliberately chosen. But when, in his casual, self-confident way, he se- cured his next employment, in New Orleans, it was to be in an environment as strange to the puritan in him as it was congenial to the indolent if wide-awake caresser of life. 4. NEW ORLEANS (March— May, 1848) Few indeed were the facts known concerning Whitman's journey to New Orleans until very recent years. Whitman wrote for the New Orleans Crescent^ but failed otherwise to preserve an interesting account of this trip, made by rail, mountain stagecoach, and river steamboat^; but like other accounts bom of novelty and child-wonder, it shrinks in size as its inspiration wanes, until, when the Father of Waters is reached, the prose ceases entirely, giving way to only an impres- sionistic litde poem in conventional measures.* The narrative is entertaining, however, because of the light it throws upon the means of transportation common at the time, on the ap- pearance of the towns and rivers, on the incredible cheapness of living costs, the character of the inland inhabitants, and the promise the young poet saw in the West.' Walt had left Brooklyn, with his fifteen-year-old brother Jeff, on February 11; they arrived in New Orleans about ten o'clock on the night of February 25. The two weeks of varied travel were doubdess crammed with experiences of inter- est and enlaigement for the virile and receptive child of New York. As for New Orleans, we know that it remained in Whit- man's memory as one of his three \"cities of romance.\"* 'See I, pp. i8i-i9a '\"The Missiisippi at Midnight/' the original vernon of which is to be found in the Ysk Rniiw, October, 191 5, p. 173.

INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xlv The day after their arrival the Whitmans found a boarding house at the comer of Poydras and St. Charles streets, but to youths accustomed to the Dutch spotlessness of Madam Whit- man's housekeeping, the place seemed dirty beyond endurance.^ More comfortable quarters were soon found in the \"Fremont house, next door to the theatre and directly opposite the office/'* It appears that a month later they were not living in New Or- leans proper, but in Lafayette, then a suburb.' Walt found the Fremont House convenient because there one might go to his meals as irregularly as one liked.^ Occasionally, at least, his breakfasts were taken in the French market.^ If any of his adolescent asceticism with reference to the use of coffee remained in 1848, it was to vanish before the delicious beverage he found in this market.® Many years afterward he recalled the superior wines of which the city had boasted,^ but he either did not drink much in the spacious bar-rooms he loved to frequent' or else he concealed the fact from his brother.' His dress was simple, but immaculate.^® He was trying to save money, for he hoped to be able to send home enough to pay the interest on a loan;^^ and by the last of April he had, according to Jeff, \"quite a sum.\" \" His salary is unknown, but it must have been a very fair one for that time, for the amount saved would be in addition to all or a part of the two hundred dollars advanced to him in New York to cover travelling expenses and to bind the bargain.^' Possibly, however, misunderstanding this as ^^expense money\" instead of a loan (the agreement had been made in fifteen minutes),^^ he thought he had more to his credit than the ^Manuscript letter from Jefferson Whitman to his mother, in the Bucke collection. ^IHdim, Cf, II, p. 77.

At any rate, though pleasantly situated^ he intended to return north as soon as he had saved a thousand dollars.^ New Orleans interested him, but appar- ently it was no rival to his affection for his home.' Whitman's work was in the editorial department of the Cres- centy but, in contrast to much of his earlier experience, he was not sole editor nor even editor-in-chief. Besides him there were an editorial writer, a city editor, and a translator, his own principal duty being to ^<make up the news'' with pen and scis- sors, though he also wrote some editorials and sketches.' He went to work about nine in the morning and got away from the office before eleven at night.^ But he must have had his usual stroll about town within these hours — between the time for \"copy\" and that for \"proofs\" perhaps — for he sometimes cov- ered the recorders' courts (police courts) and collected material for his \"Sketches of the Sidewalks and Levees.\"* Notwith- standing the pleasantness of his situation, it is difficult to see how a man of Whitman's habits, temperament, and training could have long continued to work harmoniously, even with affable co-labourers, in an office where his independence was left so un- Erotected by the indefinite division of labour. However, the reak, when it came, was with his employers, and was occa- sioned by a difference over money matters and a (to Whitman) inexplicable estrangement between himself and the owners of the paper, Messrs. Hayes and McClure.* This difficulty, taken with the fact of JefTs homesickness and .indisposition and of Walt's own unrooted nature, sufficiendy accounts for their de- parture homeward, only three months after their arrival in New Orleans.' Whitman's writings of this period will be criticized in the following essay, but some of them, having biographical impli- cations, must also be mentioned here. With the exception of the single poem before mentioned,* Whitman wrote no verse on this Southern \"jaunt,\" unless some of the \"Leaves of Grass\" ^See note 12, p. xlv, infra. 'On March a8 he wrote to his mother: \"My prospects in the money line are bright.

INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xlvii passages descriptive of the South were written at that time and preserved many years only in manuscript.^ And even his prose, with a few exceptions, was unconmionly slipshod and inartistic. Perhaps he had never before been so typically z. journalist as in these hasty and crude expressions of what he was seeing and feeling in New Orleans, impressions not crystallized but held a moment in solution ere they should be gone forever. It is therefore instructive to compare the anonymous record of his New Orleans life written at the time for a newspaper which could have been read by very few who knew him at the North — ^written with little expectation that it could ever be used to throw light on the evolution of a great poet — with his later culled reminiscences of that life published by that poet grown famous.' In these earlier sketches we recognize the Whitman familiar to the pilot-houses of the New York ferries and to the drivers' boxes of the Broadway stages. He roams among the cemeteries,' visits the old St. Louis Cathedral,^ converses with the returning heroes of the Mexican War,^ lounges in the spacious bar-rooms of the hotels, studying the picturesque cosmopolitanism of the types to be found there,* exposes the frauds of fake auctioneers,^ strolls about the levee and con- verses with the river-men,' or satirizes human folly and drops, like Irving, a sympathetic tear upon misfortune.' But do these contributions to the Crescent reveal a romance of his own? Biographers who believe that there was a very significant Whitman romance in New Orleans in 1848 have based their conjecture lai^gely on the following evidence :i® (i) In reply to persistent and disconcerting inquiries from his Eng- lish admirer, Jfohn Addington Symonds, concerning the inner meaning of some of Whitman's poems of affection, the poet wrote, on August 19, 1890, the following rather cryptic sentences: \"My life, young man- hood, mid-age, times South, etc., have been jolly bodily, and doubt- less open to criticism.

Harned have mentioned the old poet*s promise to g^ve them, his literary executors, a deposition concerning the facts of his \"secret\" — a promise which he never found the right mood for keeping.' (2) Whitman's departure from this congenial Southern city, in which he had pleasant employment and good health, was so sudden, and the reasons which he gave for it seemed so inadequate, that some biographers have concludni that the real cause was to be found in a romance which threatened his prophetic and artistip independence. (3) Until recently none of Whitman's characteristic verse could be traced back beyond the 1848 journey to New Orleans, so that the ex- periences of this journey are sometimes taken to have been the inspira- tion that liberated his song. (4) A poem, \"Once I Pass'd through a Populous City,\" seems to de- scribe a transitory residence in some large and picturesque city of which the reminiscent poet recalls only the passionate attachment of a woman who was broken-hearted at his parting. From these facts Mr. H. B. Binns, M. Leon Bazalgette, and others have elaborated a fairly complete story, with the result that it is now quite commonly assumed that Whitman did have a liaison in New Orleans in 1848. A young man of fine personal presence — so the story goes — he was seen by a Southern woman of high social standing, for whom to see him was to love him. This attachment, the chief responsibility for which (despite Whitman's confession to Symonds of his own culpability) is usually placed at the lady's door, in time bore fruit; but an ob- stacle to an open marriage with the middle-class Northern jour- nalist had been encountered in the pride of her family. Ac- cordingly some versions of the story suppose that there was a secret marriage (again despite the evidence of Whitman's letter to Symonds), and that the young husband was bound for life by a pledge of secrecy concerning the whole affair. Then, having learned in three months the mysteries of true love, and *Scc •* With W»lt Whitman in Camden,\" II, pp. 316,318, 425, 510-511, 543; III, pp. 80, 119-120, 140, 253, 364. > Horace Traubel has also told me of Whitman's surprise and confusion when the former day called on the poet almost inunediately after the departure of a visitor who, he told, was Whitman's grandson (or son?). INTRODUCTION: BIOGRAPHICAL xlix having learned to forswear them, he returned north and began composing the \"Leaves of Grass.\" Now, Whitman may indeed have had an affaire de cosur in New Orleans, but in the light of new evidence we shall have to modify this explanation of how it all occurred and perhaps assign its date to a later journey to the South, even if we do not abandon the conmion theory altogether. First let us re- examine the evidence used by the biographers. As we have seen, the suddenness and the unlooked-for earliness of Whit- man's departure from New Orleans is adequately accounted for without supposing that a woman or her family had any- thing to do with it. As to the a posteriori evidence found in the maturer and more poetic verse which followed, it may be true that the first rhythmical lines of the \"Leaves\" were written shortly after the return North rather than just be- fore;^ but they appear in a notebook containing the date 1847, to which year we must assign Whitman's first definite efforts' to compose the novel volume which was to see the light of print in 1855. The latter part of this notebook contains,' it is true, the first draft of the description of sexual ecstasy to be incor- porated in \"Song of Myself\" (Sections 28-30); but as to that. Whitman's letter to Symonds, in its studied indefiniteness, im- plies that the period of his \"body-joUiness\" included his earlier manhood as well.* There remains the evidence of the poem, \"Once I Pass'd through a Populous City.\" This lyric prob- ably refers to New Orleans, but its original form* proves that it was first intended, not for a \"Children of Adam\" poem de- scriptive of the love between the sexes, but for a \"Calamus\" poem descriptive of that \"adhesiveness,\" or attachment of man to man, which Whitman preached as a complement to his gospel of individuality, in his religion of sentimental democracy.* I suppose his reason for disguising the emotion which gave birth to this poem was the poet-prophet's desire to avoid a chaige of effeminacy. But the important fact made clear by it is that a Whitman poem of tenderness addressed to a \"rude and ignor- ant man\" (doubtless a counterpart to the Pete Doyle of the Washington period) could, through slight emendations, become ^Sce U, p.

The history of the poem goes far, I think, toward showing that Whitman retained m manhood some of the characteristics of the sexually indis- criminate affection of a child. And his ability to direct his romantic sentiments toward man as well as toward woman ac- counts, perhaps, for a certain indefinable attraction which healthy-minded men like Doctor Bucke no less than healthy- minded women like Mrs. Gilchrist have felt in his verse. The arrist is expected to pass in his imagination from the man's point of view to the woman's, and back again, at will; Whitman IS almost solitary among the major poets of the world — unless Shakespeare be an exception — in his tendency to do this with his heart. This peculiarity, he seems to have thought, was what made him akin to the great religious teachers of the past. But he also knew that such a nature would be misunderstood, and that it might even prove dangerous.' But let us return to the problem of the New Orleans romance. It is now plain that if a woman entered Whitman's life between March and May, 1848, the fact, as well as her character and social position, must be established by other evidence. The letter to Symonds is apparently competent testimony, though it has at times been discounted as being either a fabrication or the result of hallucination; but it is not definite as to dates.* How- ever, some of Whitman's prose pieces written for the Crescent show how far he was from being insensible to womanly beauty in the social capital of the South.' Nine days before he left for home he published anonymously a humorous skit^ describing h"
