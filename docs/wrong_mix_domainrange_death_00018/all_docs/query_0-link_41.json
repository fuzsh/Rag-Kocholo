I have\n\nalso frequently told them that men in the Christian world are in such gross\n\nignorance respecting Angels and Spirits as to suppose them to be minds\n\nwithout a form, or mere thoughts, of which they have no other idea than as\n\nsomething ethereal possessing a vital principle. To the first or ultimate\n\nheaven also correspond the forms of man's body, called its members, organs,\n\nand viscera. Thus the corporeal part of man is that in which heaven\n\nultimately closes, and upon which, as on its base, it rests.\"\n\n--SWEDENBORG.\n\n\"Yes, truly, it is a great thing for a nation that it get an articulate\n\nvoice--that it produce a man who will speak forth melodiously what the\n\nheart of it means.\"\n\n--CARLYLE.\n\n\"Les efforts de vos ennemis contre vous, leurs cris, leur rage impuissante,\n\net leurs petits succ s, ne doivent pas vous effrayer; ce ne sont que des\n\n�\n\ngratignures sur les paules d'Hercule.\"\n\n�\n\n�\n\n--ROBESPIERRE.\n\nTO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT.\n\nDEAR SCOTT,--Among various gifts which I have received from you, tangible\n\nand intangible, was a copy of the original quarto edition of Whitman's\n\n_Leaves of Grass_, which you presented to me soon after its first\n\nappearance in 1855. At a time when few people on this side of the Atlantic\n\nhad looked into the book, and still fewer had found in it anything save\n\nmatter for ridicule, you had appraised it, and seen that its value was real\n\nand great. A true poet and a strong thinker like yourself was indeed likely\n\nto see that. I read the book eagerly, and perceived that its substantiality\n\nand power were still ahead of any eulogium with which it might have come\n\ncommended to me--and, in fact, ahead of most attempts that could be made at\n\nverbal definition of them.\n\nSome years afterwards, getting to know our friend Swinburne, I found with\n\nmuch satisfaction that he also was an ardent (not of course a _blind_)\n\nadmirer of Whitman. Satisfaction, and a degree almost of surprise; for his\n\nintense sense of poetic refinement of form in his own works and his\n\nexacting acuteness as a critic might have seemed likely to carry him away\n\nfrom Whitman in sympathy at least, if not in actual latitude of perception.\n\nThose who find the American poet \"utterly formless,\" \"intolerably rough and\n\nfloundering,\" \"destitute of the A B C of art,\" and the like, might not\n\nunprofitably ponder this very different estimate of him by the author of\n\n_Atalanta in Calydon_.\n\nMay we hope that now, twelve years after the first appearance of _Leaves of\n\nGrass_, the English reading public may be prepared for a selection of\n\nWhitman's poems, and soon hereafter for a complete edition of them? I trust\n\nthis may prove to be the case. At any rate, it has been a great\n\ngratification to me to be concerned in the experiment; and this is enhanced\n\nby my being enabled to associate with it your name, as that of an early and\n\nwell-qualified appreciator of Whitman, and no less as that of a dear\n\nfriend.\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nW. M. ROSSETTI.\n\n_October_ 1867.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nPREFATORY NOTICE\n\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF LEAVES OF GRASS\n\nCHANTS DEMOCRATIC:\n\nSTARTING FROM PAUMANOK\n\nAMERICAN FEUILLAGE\n\nTHE PAST-PRESENT\n\nYEARS OF THE UNPERFORMED\n\nFLUX\n\nTO WORKING MEN\n\nSONG OF THE BROAD-AXE\n\nANTECEDENTS\n\nSALUT AU MONDE\n\nA BROADWAY PAGEANT\n\nOLD IRELAND\n\nBOSTON TOWN\n\nFRANCE, THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF THESE STATES\n\nEUROPE, THE SEVENTY-SECOND AND SEVENTY-THIRD YEARS OF THESE STATES\n\nTO A FOILED REVOLTER OR REVOLTRESS\n\nDRUM TAPS:\n\nMANHATTAN ARMING\n\n1861\n\nTHE UPRISING\n\nBEAT!
