Inscriptions\n\nOneâs-Self I Sing\n\nOneâs-self I sing, a simple separate person,\n\nYet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.\n\nOf physiology from top to toe I sing,\n\nNot physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say\n\nthe Form complete is worthier far,\n\nThe Female equally with the Male I sing.\n\nOf Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,\n\nCheerful, for freest action formâd under the laws divine,\n\nThe Modern Man I sing.\n\nAs I Ponderâd In Silence\n\nAs I ponderâd in silence,\n\nReturning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,\n\nA Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,\n\nTerrible in beauty, age, and power,\n\nThe genius of poets of old lands,\n\nAs to me directing like flame its eyes,\n\nWith finger pointing to many immortal songs,\n\nAnd menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,\n\nKnowâst thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards?\n\nAnd that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\n\nThe making of perfect soldiers.\n\nBe it so, then I answerâd,\n\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\n\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\n\nand retreat, victory deferrâd and wavering,\n\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\n\nfield the world,\n\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\n\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\n\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\n\nIn Cabinâd Ships At Sea\n\nIn cabinâd ships at sea,\n\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\n\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\n\nOr some lone bark buoyâd on the dense marine,\n\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\n\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\n\nmany a star at night,\n\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\n\nIn full rapport at last.\n\nHere are our thoughts, voyagersâ thoughts,\n\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\n\nThe sky oâerarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\n\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\n\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\n\nbriny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\n\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\n\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\n\nAnd this is oceanâs poem.\n\nThen falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\n\nYou not a reminiscence of the land alone,\n\nYou too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purposâd I know not\n\nwhither, yet ever full of faith,\n\nConsort to every ship that sails, sail you!\n\nBear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it\n\nhere in every leaf;)\n\nSpeed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the\n\nimperious waves,\n\nChant on, sail on, bear oâer the boundless blue from me to every sea,\n\nThis song for mariners and all their ships.\n\nTo Foreign Lands\n\nI heard that you askâd for something to prove this puzzle the New World,\n\nAnd to define America, her athletic Democracy,\n\nTherefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.\n\nTo A Historian\n\nYou who celebrate bygones,\n\nWho have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races, the life\n\nthat has exhibited itself,\n\nWho have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates,\n\nrulers and priests,\n\nI, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself\n\nin his own rights,\n\nPressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself,\n\n(the great pride of man in himself,)\n\nChanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,\n\nI project the history of the future.\n\nTo Thee Old Cause\n\nTo thee old cause!\n\nThou peerless, passionate, good cause,\n\nThou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,\n\nDeathless throughout the ages, races, lands,\n\nAfter a strange sad war, great war for thee,\n\n(I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be\n\nreally fought, for thee,)\n\nThese chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.\n\n(A war O soldiers not for itself alone,\n\nFar, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this book.)\n\nThou orb of many orbs!\n\nThou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!\n\nAround the idea of thee the war revolving,\n\nWith all its angry and vehement play of causes,\n\n(With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,)\n\nThese recitatives for thee,âmy book and the war are one,\n\nMerged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,\n\nAs a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,\n\nAround the idea of thee.\n\nEidolons\n\nI met a seer,\n\nPassing the hues and objects of the world,\n\nThe fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,\n\nTo glean eidolons.\n\nPut in thy chants said he,\n\nNo more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in,\n\nPut first before the rest as light for all and entrance-song of all,\n\nThat of eidolons.\n\nEver the dim beginning,\n\nEver the growth, the rounding of the circle,\n\nEver the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)\n\nEidolons! eidolons!\n\nEver the mutable,\n\nEver materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering,\n\nEver the ateliers, the factories divine,\n\nIssuing eidolons.\n\nLo, I or you,\n\nOr woman, man, or state, known or unknown,\n\nWe seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,\n\nBut really build eidolons.\n\nThe ostent evanescent,\n\nThe substance of an artistâs mood or savanâs studies long,\n\nOr warriorâs, martyrâs, heroâs toils,\n\nTo fashion his eidolon.\n\nOf every human life,\n\n(The units gatherâd, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)\n\nThe whole or large or small summâd, added up,\n\nIn its eidolon.\n\nThe old, old urge,\n\nBased on the ancient pinnacles, lo, newer, higher pinnacles,\n\nFrom science and the modern still impellâd,\n\nThe old, old urge, eidolons.\n\nThe present now and here,\n\nAmericaâs busy, teeming, intricate whirl,\n\nOf aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,\n\nTo-dayâs eidolons.\n\nThese with the past,\n\nOf vanishâd lands, of all the reigns of kings across the sea,\n\nOld conquerors, old campaigns, old sailorsâ voyages,\n\nJoining eidolons.\n\nDensities, growth, facades,\n\nStrata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,\n\nFar-born, far-dying, living long, to leave,\n\nEidolons everlasting.\n\nExalte, rapt, ecstatic,\n\nThe visible but their womb of birth,\n\nOf orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape,\n\nThe mighty earth-eidolon.\n\nAll space, all time,\n\n(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,\n\nSwelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,)\n\nFillâd with eidolons only.\n\nThe noiseless myriads,\n\nThe infinite oceans where the rivers empty,\n\nThe separate countless free identities, like eyesight,\n\nThe true realities, eidolons.\n\nNot this the world,\n\nNor these the universes, they the universes,\n\nPurport and end, ever the permanent life of life,\n\nEidolons, eidolons.\n\nBeyond thy lectures learnâd professor,\n\nBeyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen, beyond all mathematics,\n\nBeyond the doctorâs surgery, anatomy, beyond the chemist with his chemistry,\n\nThe entities of entities, eidolons.\n\nUnfixâd yet fixâd,\n\nEver shall be, ever have been and are,\n\nSweeping the present to the infinite future,\n\nEidolons, eidolons, eidolons.\n\nThe prophet and the bard,\n\nShall yet maintain themselves, in higher stages yet,\n\nShall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy, interpret yet to them,\n\nGod and eidolons.\n\nAnd thee my soul,\n\nJoys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations,\n\nThy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet,\n\nThy mates, eidolons.\n\nThy body permanent,\n\nThe body lurking there within thy body,\n\nThe only purport of the form thou art, the real I myself,\n\nAn image, an eidolon.\n\nThy very songs not in thy songs,\n\nNo special strains to sing, none for itself,\n\nBut from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,\n\nA round full-orbâd eidolon.\n\nFor Him I Sing\n\nFor him I sing,\n\nI raise the present on the past,\n\n(As some perennial tree out of its roots, the present on the past,)\n\nWith time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws,\n\nTo make himself by them the law unto himself.\n\nWhen I Read The Book\n\nWhen I read the book, the biography famous,\n\nAnd is this then (said I) what the author calls a manâs life?\n\nAnd so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?\n\n(As if any man really knew aught of my life,\n\nWhy even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life,\n\nOnly a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections\n\nI seek for my own use to trace out here.)\n\nBeginning My Studies\n\nBeginning my studies the first step pleasâd me so much,\n\nThe mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\n\nThe least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\n\nThe first step I say awed me and pleasâd me so much,\n\nI have hardly gone and hardly wishâd to go any farther,\n\nBut stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\n\nBeginners\n\nHow they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,)\n\nHow dear and dreadful they are to the earth,\n\nHow they inure to themselves as much as to anyâwhat a paradox\n\nappears their age,\n\nHow people respond to them, yet know them not,\n\nHow there is something relentless in their fate all times,\n\nHow all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,\n\nAnd how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same\n\ngreat purchase.\n\nTo The States\n\nTo the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist\n\nmuch, obey little,\n\nOnce unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved,\n\nOnce fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever\n\nafterward resumes its liberty.\n\nOn Journeys Through The States\n\nOn journeys through the States we start,\n\n(Ay through the world, urged by these songs,\n\nSailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)\n\nWe willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.\n\nWe have watchâd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on,\n\nAnd have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the\n\nseasons, and effuse as much?\n\nWe dwell a while in every city and town,\n\nWe pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the\n\nMississippi, and the Southern States,\n\nWe confer on equal terms with each of the States,\n\nWe make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear,\n\nWe say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the\n\nbody and the soul,\n\nDwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,\n\nAnd what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,\n\nAnd may be just as much as the seasons.\n\nTo A Certain Cantatrice\n\nHere, take this gift,\n\nI was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,\n\nOne who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the\n\nprogress and freedom of the race,\n\nSome brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel;\n\nBut I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.\n\nMe Imperturbe\n\nMe imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,\n\nMaster of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things,\n\nImbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,\n\nFinding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less\n\nimportant than I thought,\n\nMe toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee,\n\nor far north or inland,\n\nA river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these\n\nStates or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,\n\nMe wherever my life is lived, O to be self-balanced for contingencies,\n\nTo confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as\n\nthe trees and animals do.\n\nSavantism\n\nThither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and\n\nnestling close, always obligated,\n\nThither hours, months, yearsâthither trades, compacts,\n\nestablishments, even the most minute,\n\nThither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;\n\nThither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,\n\nAs a father to his father going takes his children along with him.\n\nThe Ship Starting\n\nLo, the unbounded sea,\n\nOn its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even\n\nher moonsails.\n\nThe pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so statelyâ\n\nbelow emulous waves press forward,\n\nThey surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.\n\nI Hear America Singing\n\nI hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,\n\nThose of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,\n\nThe carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,\n\nThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,\n\nThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand\n\nsinging on the steamboat deck,\n\nThe shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as\n\nhe stands,\n\nThe wood-cutterâs song, the ploughboyâs on his way in the morning,\n\nor at noon intermission or at sundown,\n\nThe delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,\n\nor of the girl sewing or washing,\n\nEach singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,\n\nThe day what belongs to the dayâat night the party of young\n\nfellows, robust, friendly,\n\nSinging with open mouths their strong melodious songs.\n\nWhat Place Is Besieged?\n\nWhat place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?\n\nLo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,\n\nAnd with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,\n\nAnd artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun.\n\nStill Though The One I Sing\n\nStill though the one I sing,\n\n(One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to

have you reckonâd the earth much?\n\nHave you practisâd so long to learn to read?\n\nHave you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\n\nStop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of\n\nall poems,\n\nYou shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions\n\nof suns left,)\n\nYou shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through\n\nthe eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,\n\nYou shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,\n\nYou shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.\n\n3\n\nI have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the\n\nbeginning and the end,\n\nBut I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\n\nThere was never any more inception than there is now,\n\nNor any more youth or age than there is now,\n\nAnd will never be any more perfection than there is now,\n\nNor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\n\nUrge and urge and urge,\n\nAlways the procreant urge of the world.\n\nOut of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and\n\nincrease, always sex,\n\nAlways a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.\n\nTo elaborate is no avail, learnâd and unlearnâd feel that it is so.\n\nSure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well\n\nentretied, braced in the beams,\n\nStout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,\n\nI and this mystery here we stand.\n\nClear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.\n\nLack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,\n\nTill that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.\n\nShowing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,\n\nKnowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they\n\ndiscuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.\n\nWelcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,\n\nNot an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be\n\nless familiar than the rest.\n\nI am satisfiedâI see, dance, laugh, sing;\n\nAs the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night,\n\nand withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,\n\nLeaving me baskets coverâd with white towels swelling the house with\n\ntheir plenty,\n\nShall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,\n\nThat they turn from gazing after and down the road,\n\nAnd forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,\n\nExactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?\n\n4\n\nTrippers and askers surround me,\n\nPeople I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and\n\ncity I live in, or the nation,\n\nThe latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,\n\nMy dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\n\nThe real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\n\nThe sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss\n\nor lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,\n\nBattles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news,\n\nthe fitful events;\n\nThese come to me days and nights and go from me again,\n\nBut they are not the Me myself.\n\nApart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\n\nStands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\n\nLooks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\n\nLooking with side-curved head curious what will come next,\n\nBoth in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\n\nBackward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with\n\nlinguists and contenders,\n\nI have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\n\n5\n\nI believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\n\nAnd you must not be abased to the other.\n\nLoafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,\n\nNot words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not\n\neven the best,\n\nOnly the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\n\nI mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\n\nHow you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turnâd over upon me,\n\nAnd parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue\n\nto my bare-stript heart,\n\nAnd reachâd till you felt my beard, and reachâd till you held my feet.\n\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass\n\nall the argument of the earth,\n\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\n\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\n\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women\n\nmy sisters and lovers,\n\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love,\n\nAnd limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\n\nAnd brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\n\nAnd mossy scabs of the worm fence, heapâd stones, elder, mullein and\n\npoke-weed.\n\n6\n\nA child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;\n\nHow could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.\n\nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green\n\nstuff woven.\n\nOr I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\n\nA scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\n\nBearing the ownerâs name someway in the corners, that we may see\n\nand remark, and say Whose?\n\nOr I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.\n\nOr I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,\n\nAnd it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\n\nGrowing among black folks as among white,\n\nKanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I\n\nreceive them the same.\n\nAnd now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\nTenderly will I use you curling grass,\n\nIt may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,\n\nIt may be if I had known them I would have loved them,\n\nIt may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out\n\nof their mothersâ laps,\n\nAnd here you are the mothersâ laps.\n\nThis grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,\n\nDarker than the colorless beards of old men,\n\nDark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\n\nO I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,\n\nAnd I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\n\nI wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\n\nAnd the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken\n\nsoon out of their laps.\n\nWhat do you think has become of the young and old men?\n\nAnd what do you think has become of the women and children?\n\nThey are alive and well somewhere,\n\nThe smallest sprout shows there is really no death,\n\nAnd if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the\n\nend to arrest it,\n\nAnd ceasâd the moment life appearâd.\n\nAll goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\n\nAnd to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\n\n7\n\nHas any one supposed it lucky to be born?\n\nI hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\n\nI pass death with the dying and birth with the new-washâd babe, and\n\nam not containâd between my hat and boots,\n\nAnd peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,\n\nThe earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\n\nI am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\n\nI am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and\n\nfathomless as myself,\n\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\n\nEvery kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,\n\nFor me those that have been boys and that love women,\n\nFor me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,\n\nFor me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the\n\nmothers of mothers,\n\nFor me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\n\nFor me children and the begetters of children.\n\nUndrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\n\nI see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\n\nAnd am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\n\n8\n\nThe little one sleeps in its cradle,\n\nI lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies\n\nwith my hand.\n\nThe youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,\n\nI peeringly view them from the top.\n\nThe suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\n\nI witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol\n\nhas fallen.\n\nThe blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\n\nthe promenaders,\n\nThe heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the\n\nclank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\n\nThe snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\n\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rousâd mobs,\n\nThe flap of the curtainâd litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,\n\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\n\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his\n\npassage to the centre of the crowd,\n\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\n\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starvâd who fall sunstruck or in fits,\n\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and\n\ngive birth to babes,\n\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls\n\nrestrainâd by decorum,\n\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances,\n\nrejections with convex lips,\n\nI mind them or the show or resonance of themâI come and I depart.\n\n9\n\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\n\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,\n\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\n\nThe armfuls are packâd to the sagging mow.\n\nI am there, I help, I came stretchâd atop of the load,\n\nI felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\n\nI jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,\n\nAnd roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n10\n\nAlone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\n\nWandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\n\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\n\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-killâd game,\n\nFalling asleep on the gatherâd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\n\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,\n\nMy eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.\n\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\n\nI tuckâd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\n\nYou should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\n\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west,\n\nthe bride was a red girl,\n\nHer father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking,\n\nthey had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets\n\nhanging from their shoulders,\n\nOn a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant\n\nbeard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\n\nShe had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks\n\ndescended upon her voluptuous limbs and reachâd to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\n\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\n\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\n\nAnd went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\n\nAnd brought water and fillâd a tub for his sweated body and bruisâd feet,\n\nAnd gave him a room that enterâd from my own, and gave him some\n\ncoarse clean clothes,\n\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\n\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\n\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passâd north,\n\nI had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock leanâd in the corner.\n\n11\n\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\n\nTwenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\n\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\n\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\n\nShe hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.\n\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\n\nAh the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you,\n\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\n\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glistenâd with wet, it ran from their long hair,\n\nLittle streams passâd all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also passâd over their bodies,\n\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the\n\nsun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\n\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,\n\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n12\n\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife\n\nat the stall in the market,\n\nI loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\n\nEach has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in\n\nthe fire.\n\nFrom the cinder-strewâd threshold I follow their movements,\n\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,\n\nOverhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\n\nThey do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\n\n13\n\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags\n\nunderneath on its tied-over chain,\n\nThe negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and\n\ntall he stands poisâd on one leg on the string-piece,\n\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over\n\nhis hip-band,\n\nHis glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat\n\naway from his forehead,\n\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of\n\nhis polishâd and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,\n\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as\n\nforward sluing,\n\nTo niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,\n\nAbsorbing all to myself and for this song.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what\n\nis that you express in your eyes?\n\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and\n\nday-long ramble,\n\nThey rise together, they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wingâd purposes,\n\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\n\nAnd consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\n\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,\n\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,\n\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n14\n\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\n\nYa-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\n\nThe pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\n\nFind its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\n\nThe sharp-hoofâd moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\n\nchickadee, the prairie-dog,\n\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\n\nThe brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,\n\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,\n\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamourâd of growing out-doors,\n\nOf men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\n\nOf the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and\n\nmauls, and the drivers of horses,\n\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\n\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\n\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\n\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will,\n\nScattering it freely forever.\n\n15\n\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\n\nThe carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane\n\nwhistles its wild ascending lisp,\n\nThe married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner,\n\nThe pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,\n\nThe mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,\n\nThe duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,\n\nThe deacons are ordainâd with crossâd hands at the altar,\n\nThe spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,\n\nThe farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and\n\nlooks at the oats and rye,\n\nThe lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirmâd case,\n\n(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his motherâs\n\nbed-room;)\n\nThe jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,\n\nHe turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;\n\nThe malformâd limbs are tied to the surgeonâs table,\n\nWhat is removed drops horribly in a pail;\n\nThe quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by\n\nthe bar-room stove,\n\nThe machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat,\n\nthe gate-keeper marks who pass,\n\nThe young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do\n\nnot know him;)\n\nThe half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,\n\nThe western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their\n\nrifles, some sit on logs,\n\nOut from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;\n\nThe groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,\n\nAs the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them\n\nfrom his saddle,\n\nThe bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their\n\npartners, the dancers bow to each other,\n\nThe youth lies awake in the cedar-roofâd garret and harks to the\n\nmusical rain,\n\nThe Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,\n\nThe squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemmâd cloth is offering moccasins and\n\nbead-bags for sale,\n\nThe connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut\n\neyes bent sideways,\n\nAs the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for\n\nthe shore-going passengers,\n\nThe young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it\n\noff in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,\n\nThe one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne\n\nher first child,\n\nThe clean-hairâd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the\n\nfactory or mill,\n\nThe paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporterâs lead\n\nflies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering\n\nwith blue and gold,\n\nThe canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his\n\ndesk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,\n\nThe conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,\n\nThe child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,\n\nThe regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white\n\nsails sparkle!)\n\nThe drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,\n\nThe pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling\n\nabout the odd cent;)\n\nThe bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock\n\nmoves slowly,\n\nThe opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-openâd lips,\n\nThe prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and\n\npimpled neck,\n\nThe crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to\n\neach other,\n\n(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\n\nThe President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great\n\nSecretaries,\n\nOn the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,\n\nThe crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,\n\nThe Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,\n\nAs the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the\n\njingling of loose change,\n\nThe floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the\n\nroof, the masons are calling for mortar,\n\nIn single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;\n\nSeasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gatherâd, it\n\nis the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)\n\nSeasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows,\n\nand the winter-grain falls in the ground;\n\nOff on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in\n\nthe frozen surface,\n\nThe stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep\n\nwith his axe,\n\nFlatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,\n\nCoon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through\n\nthose drainâd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,\n\nTorches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,\n\nPatriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons\n\naround them,\n\nIn walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after\n\ntheir dayâs sport,\n\nThe city sleeps and the country sleeps,\n\nThe living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,\n\nThe old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;\n\nAnd these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,\n\nAnd such as it is to be of these more or less I am,\n\nAnd of these one and all I weave the song of myself.\n\n16\n\nI am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,\n\nRegardless of others, ever regardful of others,\n\nMaternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\n\nStuffâd with the stuff that is coarse and stuffâd with the stuff\n\nthat is fine,\n\nOne of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the\n\nlargest the same,\n\nA Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and\n\nhospitable down by the Oconee I live,\n\nA Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest\n\njoints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,\n\nA Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin\n\nleggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,\n\nA boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;\n\nAt home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen\n\noff Newfoundland,\n\nAt home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,\n\nAt home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the\n\nTexan ranch,\n\nComrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving\n\ntheir big proportions,)\n\nComrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands\n\nand welcome to drink and meat,\n\nA learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,\n\nA novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,\n\nOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,\n\nA farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,\n\nPrisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\n\nI resist any thing better than my own diversity,\n\nBreathe the air but leave plenty after me,\n\nAnd am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n\n(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,\n\nThe bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,\n\nThe palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\n17\n\nThese are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they\n\nare not original with me,\n\nIf they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,\n\nIf they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,\n\nIf they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.\n\nThis is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,\n\nThis the common air that bathes the globe.\n\n18\n\nWith music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\n\nI play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for\n\nconquerâd and slain persons.\n\nHave you heard that it was good to gain the day?\n\nI also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit\n\nin which they are won.\n\nI beat and pound for the dead,\n\nI blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.\n\nVivas to those who have failâd!\n\nAnd to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\n\nAnd to those themselves who sank in the sea!\n\nAnd to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!\n\nAnd the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!\n\n19\n\nThis is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,\n\nIt is for the wicked just same as the righteous, I make appointments\n\nwith all,\n\nI will not have a single person slighted or left away,\n\nThe kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,\n\nThe heavy-lippâd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;\n\nThere shall be no difference between them and the rest.\n\nThis is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,\n\nThis the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,\n\nThis the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,\n\nThis the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.\n\nDo you guess I have some intricate purpose?\n\nWell I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the\n\nside of a rock has.\n\nDo you take it I would astonish?\n\nDoes the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering\n\nthrough the woods?\n\nDo I astonish more than they?\n\nThis hour I tell things in confidence,\n\nI might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.\n\n20\n\nWho goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;\n\nHow is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\n\nWhat is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\n\nAll I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,\n\nElse it were time lost listening to me.\n\nI do not snivel that snivel the world over,\n\nThat months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\n\nWhimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity\n\ngoes to the fourth-removâd,\n\nI wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\n\nWhy should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\n\nHaving pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counselâd with\n\ndoctors and calculated close,\n\nI find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\n\nIn all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,\n\nAnd the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\n\nI know I am solid and sound,\n\nTo me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,\n\nAll are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\n\nI know I am deathless,\n\nI know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenterâs compass,\n\nI know I shall not pass like a childâs carlacue cut with a burnt\n\nstick at night.\n\nI know I am august,\n\nI do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,\n\nI see that the elementary laws never apologize,\n\n(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by,\n\nafter all.)\n\nI exist as I am, that is enough,\n\nIf no other in the world be aware I sit content,\n\nAnd if each and all be aware I sit content.\n\nOne world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,\n\nAnd whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten\n\nmillion years,\n\nI can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\n\nMy foothold is tenonâd and mortisâd in granite,\n\nI laugh at what you call dissolution,\n\nAnd I know the amplitude of time.\n\n21\n\nI am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\n\nThe pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,\n\nThe first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate\n\ninto new tongue.\n\nI am the poet of the woman the same as the man,\n\nAnd I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,\n\nAnd I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\nI chant the chant of dilation or pride,\n\nWe have had ducking and deprecating about enough,\n\nI show that size is only development.\n\nHave you outstript the rest? are you the President?\n\nIt is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and\n\nstill pass on.\n\nI am he that walks with the tender and growing night,\n\nI call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\n\nPress close bare-bosomâd nightâpress close magnetic nourishing night!\n\nNight of south windsânight of the large few stars!\n\nStill nodding nightâmad naked summer night.\n\nSmile O voluptuous cool-breathâd earth!\n\nEarth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\n\nEarth of departed sunsetâearth of the mountains misty-topt!\n\nEarth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\n\nEarth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\n\nEarth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\n\nFar-swooping elbowâd earthârich apple-blossomâd earth!\n\nSmile, for your lover comes.\n\nProdigal, you have given me loveâtherefore I to you give love!\n\nO unspeakable passionate love.\n\nThruster holding me tight and that I hold tight!\n\nWe hurt each other as the bridegroom and the bride hurt each other.\n\n22\n\nYou sea! I resign myself to you alsoâI guess what you mean,\n\nI behold from the beach your crooked fingers,\n\nI believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,\n\nWe must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,\n\nCushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,\n\nDash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\n\nSea of stretchâd ground-swells,\n\nSea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,\n\nSea of the brine of life and of unshovellâd yet always-ready graves,\n\nHowler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,\n\nI am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.\n\nPartaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,\n\nExtoller of amies and those that sleep in each othersâ arms.\n\nI am he attesting sympathy,\n\n(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that\n\nsupports them?)\n\nI am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet\n\nof wickedness also.\n\nWhat blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\n\nEvil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,\n\nMy gait is no fault-finderâs or rejecterâs gait,\n\nI moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\nDid you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\n\nDid you guess the celestial laws are yet to be workâd over and rectified?\n\nI find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance,\n\nSoft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,\n\nThoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\n\nThis minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\n\nThere is no better than it and now.\n\nWhat behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such wonder,\n\nThe wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.\n\n23\n\nEndless unfolding of words of ages!\n\nAnd mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\n\nA word of the faith that never balks,\n\nHere or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.\n\nIt alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,\n\nThat mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\n\nI accept Reality and dare not question it,\n\nMaterialism first and last imbuing.\n\nHurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\n\nFetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,\n\nThis is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of\n\nthe old cartouches,\n\nThese mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.\n\nThis is the geologist, this works with the scalper, and this is a\n\nmathematician.\n\nGentlemen, to you the first honors always!\n\nYour facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,\n\nI but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\n\nLess the reminders of properties told my words,\n\nAnd more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\n\nAnd make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and\n\nwomen fully equipt,\n\nAnd beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that\n\nplot and conspire.\n\n24\n\nWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,\n\nTurbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,\n\nNo sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,\n\nNo more modest than immodest.\n\nUnscrew the locks from the doors!\n\nUnscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\nWhoever degrades another degrades me,\n\nAnd whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\nThrough me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current\n\nand index.\n\nI speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\n\nBy God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their\n\ncounterpart of on the same terms.\n\nThrough me many long dumb voices,\n\nVoices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,\n\nVoices of the diseasâd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,\n\nVoices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\n\nAnd of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the\n\nfather-stuff,\n\nAnd of the rights of them the others are down upon,\n\nOf the deformâd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\n\nFog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\n\nThrough me forbidden voices,\n\nVoices of sexes and lusts, voices veilâd and I remove the veil,\n\nVoices indecent by me clarified and transfigurâd.\n\nI do not press my fingers across my mouth,\n\nI keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\n\nCopulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\nI believe in the flesh and the appetites,\n\nSeeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me\n\nis a miracle.\n\nDivine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am\n\ntouchâd from,\n\nThe scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,\n\nThis head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\n\nIf I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of\n\nmy own body, or any part of it,\n\nTranslucent mould of me it shall be you!\n\nShaded ledges and rests it shall be you!\n\nFirm masculine colter it shall be you!\n\nWhatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!\n\nYou my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!\n\nBreast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!\n\nMy brain it shall be your occult convolutions!\n\nRoot of washâd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded\n\nduplicate eggs! it shall be you!\n\nMixâd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\n\nTrickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!\n\nSun so generous it shall be you!\n\nVapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!\n\nYou sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!\n\nWinds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!\n\nBroad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my\n\nwinding paths, it shall be you!\n\nHands I have taken, face I have kissâd, mortal I have ever touchâd,\n\nit shall be you.\n\nI dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\n\nEach moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\n\nI cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,\n\nNor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the\n\nfriendship I take again.\n\nThat I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,\n\nA morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics\n\nof books.\n\nTo behold the day-break!\n\nThe little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,\n\nThe air tastes good to my palate.\n\nHefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising\n\nfreshly exuding,\n\nScooting obliquely high and low.\n\nSomething I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,\n\nSeas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\nThe earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,\n\nThe heavâd challenge from the east that moment over my head,\n\nThe mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\n\n25\n\nDazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,\n\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\n\nWe also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\n\nWe found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\n\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\n\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\n\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\n\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\n\nWalt you contain enough, why donât you let it out then?\n\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\n\narticulation,\n\nDo you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?\n\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost,\n\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\n\nI underlying causes to balance them at last,\n\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,\n\nHappiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search\n\nof this day.)\n\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,\n\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\n\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\n\nWriting and talk do not prove me,\n\nI carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\n\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\n26\n\nNow I will do nothing but listen,\n\nTo accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.\n\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames,\n\nclack of sticks cooking my meals,\n\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\n\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,\n\nSounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,\n\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of\n\nwork-people at their meals,\n\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,\n\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing\n\na death-sentence,\n\nThe heaveâeâyo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the\n\nrefrain of the anchor-lifters,\n\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking\n\nengines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and colorâd lights,\n\nThe steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,\n\nThe slow march playâd at the head of the association marching two and two,\n\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\n\nI hear the violoncello, (âtis the young manâs heartâs complaint,)\n\nI hear the keyâd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\n\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\n\nAh this indeed is musicâthis suits me.\n\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\n\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\nI hear the trainâd soprano (what work with hers is this?)\n\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\n\nIt wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possessâd them,\n\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lickâd by the indolent waves,\n\nI am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\n\nSteepâd amid honeyâd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,\n\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\n\nAnd that we call Being.\n\n27\n\nTo be in any form, what is that?\n\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)\n\nIf nothing lay more developâd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\n\nMine is no callous shell,\n\nI have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\n\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\n\nTo touch my person to some one elseâs is about as much as I can stand.\n\n28\n\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\n\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\n\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\n\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly\n\ndifferent from myself,\n\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\n\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\n\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\n\nDepriving me of my best as for a purpose,\n\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\n\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\n\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\n\nThey bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,\n\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,\n\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\n\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\nThe sentries desert every other part of me,\n\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder,\n\nThey all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.\n\nI am given up by traitors,\n\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\n\ngreatest traitor,\n\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.\n\nYou villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,\n\nUnclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\n\n29\n\nBlind loving wrestling touch, sheathâd hooded sharp-toothâd touch!\n\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\nParting trackâd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,\n\nRich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,\n\nLandscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\n30\n\nAll truths wait in all things,\n\nThey neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\n\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\n\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any,\n\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\n\nLogic and sermons never convince,\n\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\n(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\n\nOnly what nobody denies is so.)\n\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\n\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\n\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\n\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\n\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\n\nbecomes omnific,\n\nAnd until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\n\n31\n\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars,\n\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg\n\nof the wren,\n\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-dâoeuvre for the highest,\n\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\n\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\n\nAnd the cow crunching with depressâd head surpasses any statue,\n\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\n\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\n\ngrains, esculent roots,\n\nAnd am stuccoâd with quadrupeds and birds all over,\n\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\n\nBut call any thing back again when I desire it.\n\nIn vain the speeding or shyness,\n\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,\n\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powderâd bones,\n\nIn vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\n\nIn vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,\n\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\n\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\n\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\n\nIn vain the razor-billâd auk sails far north to Labrador,\n\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\n\n32\n\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and\n\nself-containâd,\n\nI stand and look at them long and long.\n\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\n\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\n\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\n\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\n\nowning things,\n\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\n\nyears ago,\n\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\n\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their\n\npossession.\n\nI wonder where they get those tokens,\n\nDid I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?\n\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\n\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\n\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\n\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\n\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\n\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\n\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\n\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\n\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\n\nHis nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\n\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.\n\nI but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\n\nWhy do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\n\nEven as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\n\n33\n\nSpace and Time! now I see it is true, what I guessâd at,\n\nWhat I guessâd when I loafâd on the grass,\n\nWhat I guessâd while I lay alone in my bed,\n\nAnd again as I walkâd the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\n\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\n\nI skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\n\nI am afoot with my vision.\n\nBy the cityâs quadrangular housesâin log huts, camping with lumber-men,\n\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,\n\nWeeding my onion-patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips,\n\ncrossing savannas, trailing in forests,\n\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,\n\nScorchâd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the\n\nshallow river,\n\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the\n\nbuck turns furiously at the hunter,\n\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the\n\notter is feeding on fish,\n\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\n\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the\n\nbeaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;\n\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flowerâd cotton plant, over\n\nthe rice in its low moist field,\n\nOver the sharp-peakâd farm house, with its scallopâd scum and\n\nslender shoots from the gutters,\n\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leavâd corn, over the\n\ndelicate blue-flower flax,\n\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with\n\nthe rest,\n\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\n\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low\n\nscragged limbs,\n\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,\n\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,\n\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\n\ngoldbug drops through the dark,\n\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to\n\nthe meadow,\n\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\n\nshuddering of their hides,\n\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle\n\nthe hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\n\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,\n\nWherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,\n\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it\n\nmyself and looking composedly down,)\n\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\n\nhatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\n\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\n\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\n\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\n\nWhere the half-burnâd brig is riding on unknown currents,\n\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\n\nWhere the dense-starrâd flag is borne at the head of the regiments,\n\nApproaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\n\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,\n\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,\n\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of\n\nbase-ball,\n\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\n\nbull-dances, drinking, laughter,\n\nAt the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the\n\njuice through a straw,\n\nAt apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\n\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;\n\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,\n\nscreams, weeps,\n\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are\n\nscatterâd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\n\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to\n\nthe mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\n\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,\n\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,\n\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles\n\nfar and near,\n\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived\n\nswan is curving and winding,\n\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her\n\nnear-human laugh,\n\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the\n\nhigh weeds,\n\nWhere band-neckâd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with\n\ntheir heads out,\n\nWhere burial coaches enter the archâd gates of a cemetery,\n\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,\n\nWhere the yellow-crownâd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at\n\nnight and feeds upon small crabs,\n\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,\n\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over\n\nthe well,\n\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,\n\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\n\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtainâd saloon, through the\n\noffice or public hall;\n\nPleasâd with the native and pleasâd with the foreign, pleasâd with\n\nthe new and old,\n\nPleasâd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\n\nPleasâd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,\n\nPleasâd with the tune of the choir of the whitewashâd church,\n\nPleasâd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,\n\nimpressâd seriously at the camp-meeting;\n\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,\n\nflatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\n\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turnâd up to the clouds,\n\nor down a lane or along the beach,\n\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\n\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheekâd bush-boy, (behind me\n\nhe rides at the drape of the day,)\n\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animalsâ feet, or the\n\nmoccasin print,\n\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\n\nNigh the coffinâd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\n\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\n\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\n\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\n\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\n\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\n\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\n\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the\n\ndiameter of eighty thousand miles,\n\nSpeeding with tailâd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\n\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\n\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\n\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\n\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\n\nAnd look at quintillions ripenâd and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\n\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\n\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\n\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\n\npike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck,\n\nI take my place late at night in the crowâs-nest,\n\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\n\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\n\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is\n\nplain in all directions,\n\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my\n\nfancies toward them,\n\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\n\nbe engaged,\n\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\n\nfeet and caution,\n\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruinâd city,\n\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\n\nof the globe.\n\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\n\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\n\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wifeâs voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\n\nThey fetch my manâs body up dripping and drownâd.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\n\nThe courage of present times and all times,\n\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\n\nsteamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\n\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\n\ndays and faithful of nights,\n\nAnd chalkâd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\n\nnot desert you;\n\nHow he followâd with them and tackâd with them three days and\n\nwould not give it up,\n\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\n\nHow the lank loose-gownâd women lookâd when boated from the\n\nside of their prepared graves,\n\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\n\nsharp-lippâd unshaved men;\n\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\n\nI am the man, I sufferâd, I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\n\nThe mother of old, condemnâd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\n\nchildren gazing on,\n\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\n\nblowing, coverâd with sweat,\n\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\n\nbuckshot and the bullets,\n\nAll these I feel or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\n\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\n\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinnâd with the\n\nooze of my skin,\n\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\n\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\n\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\n\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\n\nwounded person,\n\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mashâd fireman with breast-bone broken,\n\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\n\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\n\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\n\nThey have clearâd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\n\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\n\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\n\nof their fire-caps,\n\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\n\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\n\nI am an old arti"
