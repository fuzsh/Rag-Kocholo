        "text": "This award-winning page is a work-in-progress by Jeff Lindsay representing one of the most controversial discoveries ever about the origins of the Book of Mormon, the finding of overwhelming evidence for plagiarism from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. Mormon apologists will immediately nitpick at the slight problem of publication dates (Whitman's first edition of the Leaves of Grass in 1855 appears to postdate the 1830 Book of Mormon by about 25 years), but such arguments are mere smokescreens that can be readily blown away. The simple fact is this: Walt Whitman is surely the best nineteenth-century candidate ever proposed for Book of Mormon plagiarism, offering parallels far richer than other writers and scholars have proposed using other texts. The details of how such an early copy of Leaves of Grass fell into Joseph's hand may require further investigation, but with the evidence I present below, the case for Joseph Smith as a plagiarist should be greatly clarified. However, only PART of the evidence can be fit onto this page. For the FULL story, please purchase my new book, The Fraud Makers: Proof that the 1830 Book of Mormon was Copied from Walt Whitman's 1855 Work! (cover shown below).\n\nThis page has not received the official approval of any organization (in spite of several impressive awards), but simply provides my carefully researched findings that you can evaluate for yourself. Please consider my arguments carefully before jumping to conclusions! There is much to consider.\n\n2004 Update: The conclusions on this page have received the ultimate compliment and stamp of academic approval by being incorporated into the script of a major dramatic production that may eventually become a major Hollywood video, or at least a new soul-saving video by the producers of The God Makers. The script, \"One Day in the Life of Joseph Smith, Translator Extraordinaire of the Book of Mormon,\" shows exactly how Joseph Smith could have plagiarized from dozens of sources, including Leaves of Grass, in preparing the Book of Mormon.

However, convincing Mormons of this obvious fact has always been a frustrating battle, due both to Mormon ignorance and the difficulty of pinning down the complex and sinuous details of Joseph Smith's dark plagiarism. Mormon apologists have been able to brush aside previous attempts at proof, in large part because fellow scholars dealing with this issue have often failed to focus on the most plausible sources for the Book of Mormon. Few points have been scored by pointing to trivial word combinations or contrived parallels, which have often been the meagre fruits of scholars using weak but tempting candidates such as the writings of James Adair, Ethan Smith, Solomon Spaulding, William Shakespeare, or even E.T.A. Hoffman. And even an occasional \"direct hit\" such as the occurrence of the term \"Nephi\" in the Apocrypha or a mention of writing on brass tablets therein does little to stir Mormons from their apathy, for such parallels are so sparse that they fail to explain the origin of the meat of the Book of Mormon text, and can even be turned by clever apologists into arguments for the plausibility of the Book of Mormon.\n\nAnd so we, the objective inquirers into matters Mormon, have been impeded in our efforts to clarify Mormon thought and quench Mormon testimonies--impeded by technical challenges in trying to show what should be obvious to all but the most blind--yet it is the most blind who need our clarity of vision most. Like knowing the correct answer to a mathematical problem, but lacking the details of the proof, we have failed to score badly needed points--until now.\n\nAt last, the proof is in, the evidence has been solidified, and I am proud to announce that I have, at long last, found the best and strongest candidate from the nineteenth century for the text of the Book of Mormon. This candidate offers such rich and detailed parallels to so much of the Book of Mormon, that even the most testimony-saturated Mormon should be wakened from his or her blindness by the iron-clad case for plagiarism that can now be demonstrated \"in spades.\"\n\nThe prime candidate, far richer in parallels and much more obviously a source for content of the Book of Mormon than ANY other source available in the nineteenth century, is a source renowned for its poetic language, its King James tone, its wide-ranging discussion of voyages, ships, battles, theology, Native Americans, the New World, commerce, and numerous other features found in the Book of Mormon, yet it has been overlooked as a potential Book of Mormon source by most scholars for decades. This source, the strongest candidate for plagiarism yet, is famous now, but was virtually unknown in Joseph Smith's day. I refer to Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, and an objective analysis, which I undertake below, will readily convince even the most skeptical that it is indeed a far better source than any scholar has proposed to date to account for the nefarious Book of Mormon.\n\nThe astute reader, upon hearing the first mention of Leaves of Grass as a candidate for Book of Mormon plagiarism, will immediately sense a tantalizing possibility. The very title itself suggests \"Leaves of Brass\"--and thus \"Plates of Brass\"--a Book of Mormon parallel from the get-go. Coincidence? Not when considered in light of the overwhelming evidence of plagiarism that I present below.\n\nBut why was this connection--with all its tantalizing possibilities--so long overlooked? Why am I, a lowly and humble writer with only a limited number of advanced academic degrees and only a few major honors from respected professional and scholarly organizations, the first one to make this important discovery? It is because previous scholars have been blinded by the \"official\" publication dates for Leaves of Grass, which was first printed in 1855, and which was printed again with additional text in 1891. These minute details of publication date offer the crafty Mormon apologist an easy out, a seemingly safe retreat from the battlefield of intelligent debate. We can readily anticipate their indignant calls: \"But how could there be plagiarism if Whitman wrote his work AFTER the Book of Mormon was published in 1830??!!\" And therein lies the Mormon lie: the date of publication has NOTHING to do with the date a text was written, except for one obvious fact: the date of writing MUST BE EARLIER than the date of publication.\n\nWalt Whitman, born in 1819, lived in New York--the same state as Joseph Smith, and could easily have been a childhood friend of Joseph, or perhaps Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, or even Solomon Spalding. Undoubtedly, a young Walt Whitman must have prepared at least several critical parts of his text prior to 1830, parts which were obviously incorporated into the Book of Mormon. Yes, Walt may only have been eight or nine years old when the plagiarism occurred--but that makes him an ideal victim! Joseph Smith was not stupid. Which makes more sense--to plagiarize from a published source that anyone could spot, or to plagiarize from an as-yet-unpublished source belonging to a child who, for all Joseph knew, would never have the moxy to get his text into print? In fact, Joseph almost got away with his fraud, for it would be long after his death that Leaves of Grass would see the light of day, and well over a century before your humble author would sort through the miasma of scholarly confusion to finally pinpoint the smoking gun, the surest nineteenth century candidate available for the plagiarism of Joseph Smith.\n\nUndoubtedly, Walt Whitman was a child prodigy. Some might wonder if even a child prodigy could produce such a profound text, wondering if perhaps Whitman himself stole his early text from yet another unknown writer--but for this we have no evidence, so let us dismiss such thoughts and move on.\n\nTechnical Details: Electronic and Printed Sources\n\nIn most of my examinations of Whitman's Leaves of Grass, I have relied on the electronic text the Leaves of Grass available from the Gutenberg Project. (2013 update: Project Gutenberg appears to be having trouble. Here is an archived link to the Project Gutenberg source of the text. A version of the text is also provided directly by Archive.org.) This is the complete and essentially final version of the text, as fully printed in 1891 and 1892. (But recall that at least parts of it could well have been written prior to 1830 by young Walt Whitman, perhaps a boyhood friend of Joseph Smith.) I suggest that you acquire the text yourself and do your own searching to verify what I have found. Some sentences or phrases are broken up by two carriage returns and four spaces between the split fragments of the line, so if you wish to search for strings longer than one word, you will get better results if you modify the text initially using your word processor (I prefer the shareware program TextPad from TextPad.com for working with large text files). The idea is to replace double character returns followed by 4 spaces with a single space. In TextPad, hit F8 and replace \"\\n\\n \" (four spaces follow the final \"p\") with \" \" (a single space), making sure that you have checked the \"regular expression\" box. In MicroSoft Word, enter control-H and replace \"^p^p \" (four spaces trailing) with \" \" (a single space).\n\nThe electronic text does not give the printed page number or line numbers, but all phrases are readily found with electronic searching. However, I have also employed printed manuscripts in my explorations as well, including Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition, ed. Malcolm Cowley, New York: The Viking Press, 1959 (hereafter 1855 Edition), and the Norton Critical Edition of Leaves of Grass, ed. Sculley Bradley and Harold W. Blodgett, New York: W.W. Norton and Comp., 1973 (hereafter Norton Critical Edition).\n\nOverview: Plagiarized Themes and Overarching Concepts\n\nBefore we examine specific phrases, words, names, and sections of the Book of Mormon that have been lifted from Whitman, let's first consider the broad issues that tie the two inextricably together. My first hint that Whitman ought to be considered as a source for the Book of Mormon came in reading the entry, \"Whitman, Walt\" in Vol. 27 of Funk and Wagnalls New Encyclopedia (1990), which states that the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass was written in \"long cadenced lines that resemble the unrhymed verses of the King James Version of the Bible.\" What? A nineteenth century text written in King James language? The possible connection demanded further investigation, in spite of the (easily resolved) technical difficulty regarding publication date. The encyclopedia article (p. 294) goes on to indicate that one of Whitman's poems dealt with \"visionary flight, symbolizing life, death, and rebirth\"--all concepts from the Book of Mormon (visions, life, death, resurrection, and being born again).\n\nIn fact, the scope of Whitman's text deals with most of the major themes and concepts in the Book of Mormon. He is fascinated with ships and ocean voyages and journeys to foreign lands, all important stories and symbols in the Book of Mormon. He deals with the state of the human soul, with themes of good and evil, life and death, peace and war, freedom and captivity, body and soul, time and eternity, kings and subjects, and so forth. He treats laws and courts, industry and commerce, records and writings, joy and sorrow, and so forth, and explores the meaning and purpose of life, as does the Book of Mormon. And as we shall see, the specifics of his text--the words and phrases and groupings of concepts--serve as clearly impressed fingerprints that show us the true source of the Book of Mormon: Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass.\n\nWhile I could say much more of the broad themes, let us begin with the specifics.\n\nPlagiarized Names in the Book of Mormon\n\nMost scholars seeking evidence of plagiarized names in the Book of Mormon can only offer a few crumbs--a few contrived parallels, or perhaps a single impressive find--but Whitman provides us with the mother load when it comes to names, as we would expect if the true source for the Book of Mormon has been found. Mormons will be shocked to find in Whitman the origins of unusual Book of Mormon names, such as Ether (given in exactly that form--twice!--and in the context of ocean voyages in barges!), or Alma (derived from \"Alamo\" in a section serving as the source for the many wars in the book of Alma). These two direct hits--and new finds, I must add--would be impressive enough on their own and would readily justify new Web sites or pamphlets exposing the fraud of the Book of Mormon. But as always, there is more, much more, for I have finally discovered the true source of the Book of Mormon. Below are just a sampling of the Book of Mormon names--many now explained for the first time!--that I have found to be derived from Whitman. (Question marks after some Book of Mormon names indicate that their relationship to Whitman's text is still uncertain and may require further research to fully validate.)\n\nWords Used by WhitmanPlagiarized Book of Mormon Names EtherEther (as I show below, Whitman's use of \"ether\" is in the context of an ocean voyage with barges, just as in the Book of Ether!) AlamoAlma (and as I show below, Whitman's \"Alamo\" section is in the context of wars and forts and valiant young men, just as in the Book of Alma!) CameradoCumorah ChemistChemish LemonLamoni, Laman LemonadeLamanite PaumanokPacumeni (a shift in the order of consonants has occurred-- this clumsy attempt to cover the plagiarist's tracks only strengthens the evidence of plagiarism!)

Further examples could be given of Biblical names common to both the Book of Mormon and Whitman, making it unclear which source Joseph used for these names. Examples include Adam, Timothy, Abraham (from \"Abraham Lincoln\"), Eve, Jerusalem, Hebrew, Babylon, Egypt, Syria, etc., and even that all-important Book of Mormon name, Jehovah. Witnesses close to Joseph have testified that Joseph knew little of the Bible when he undertook his work of \"translation,\" raising questions about how he incorporated so many Biblical concepts into his text. But Joseph's familiarity with Whitman can readily account for at least some of the names and concepts that were previously assumed to come from the Old Testament.\n\nFive-word Parallels!\n\nWhile I will discuss examples in more detail below, please note that the parallels between Whitman and the Book of Mormon are not only strong in terms of themes and common elements, but strong and convincing right down to specific expressions from Whitman copied verbatim in the Book of Mormon. Normally a plagiarist will change a few words or modify their order to cover the crime to some degree, and Joseph often did this. But apparently sometimes he got so sloppy that entire phrases have been lifted verbatim from Whitman, and not just two- or three-word phrases, but sometimes entire FIVE-WORD PHRASES! Here are a few examples, some of which we shall treat more fully later:Five-word Phrases Common to Whitman and the Book of Mormon\n\nThe meaning of all things. Whitman: \"My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things, . . .\" 1 Nephi 11:17: \". . . nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.\" (Tellingly, this passage is in a scene of prophecy, and the lifted passage from Whitman is associated with \"prophetical screams.\")\n\nOf the souls of men. Whitman: \"Of the progress of the souls of men and women. . . .\" Alma 40:7: \"I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men. . . .\" The same phrase is also in Alma 40:9 (a double blunder!).\n\nBy day and by night. Whitman frequently uses the phrase \"by day and by night,\" a five-word phrase found also in 3 Nephi 4:21: \"safely by day or by night.\"\n\nThe beginning and the end. Whitman uses this phrase more than once. One example: \"But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\" Given Whitman's emphasis of this term, it should be no surprise to find it also in the Book of Mormon, specifically in 3 Nephi 9:18, where we read that Christ is \"the beginning and the end.\"\n\nThe righteous and the wicked. Whitman speaks of \"all the righteous and the wicked,\" which is parroted in 3 Nephi 24:18: \"Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, . . .\"\n\nThe face of the earth. This tell-tale phrase is one of the most common phrases in the Book of Mormon, repeated an astonishing THIRTY-EIGHT (38) TIMES! Examples include 1 Nephi 1:11, 1 Nephi 10:12,13; 1 Nephi 12:5, 1 Nephi 14:12; Alma 13:22; etc. It's source is a classic Whitman passage about the prophecies of seers and other spiritual topics, which we'll discuss in more detail below. (Thanks to Dr. Dr. Walter Reade for pointing this one out to me.) In fact, this actually should count as a SIX-WORD PHRASE, for Whitman speaks of things that are \"on the face of the earth,\" and many of the 38 plagiarized Book of Mormon passages have \"upon the face of the earth.\" The minor change of \"on\" to \"upon\" hardly conceals the crime of plagiarism. Thus, in all fairness, we have a SIX-WORD parallel--absolutely fatal to the cause of defenders of the Book of Mormon!\n\nThe Son of God shall come. Actually, this should also be counted as a six-word parallel, for Joseph Smith directly plagiarizes six words from Whitman's phrase, \"The true son of God shall come singing his songs,\" vainly trying to disguise his crime by dropping the word \"true.\" But with almost insane abandon, Joseph then repeats Whitman's phrase THREE TIMES in the Book of Mormon (Alma 9:26, Alma 11:35, and Alma 21:7). (Thanks also to Dr. Dr. Walter Reade for this one!)\n\nWhile much can be (and sometimes will be) said of any of these examples, I believe that not even the most hardened and cynical Mormon apologist can dismiss these words as \"trivial.\" For example, \"righteous\" and \"wicked\" are very specific nouns of great thematic importance in the Book of Mormon, where many verses borrow these foundational concepts from Whitman in various orders and with various minor modifications. But in spite of valiant attempts at a cover-up, Joseph slipped in letting this verbatim five-word phrase survive in his final text. Like DNA evidence in a murder, this phrase--or any other five-word phrase--is evidence enough to convict! We can only hope that the Mormons on the jury will have the courage to open their eyes and shout \"guilty!\"\n\nI could mention several near-hits, such as Whitman's five-word phrase \"the face of the sea\" which is nearly identical to a related five-word phrase in Ether 6:5, \"the face of the waters,\" where \"the waters\" clearly refers to \"the sea.\" Changing \"sea\" to \"waters\" is precisely the kind of action a plagiarist undertakes to hide his crime, and actually strengthens the case for plagiarism. Or I could mention his five-word phrase in \"all the righteous and the wicked,\" which is borrowed with a trivial change in word order in Alma 11:44: \"both the wicked and the righteous.\"\n\nThough slightly less impressive than the five-word hits, there are numerous examples of directly plagiarized four-word phrases in the Book of Mormon. For example, Whitman writes, \"Out of the depths the storm's abysmic waves,\" while 3 Nephi 28:20 offers, \"they were delivered out of the depths of the earth. In another parallel involving \"depths,\" there is a four-word phrase found in two other lines of Whitman, \"but in the depths of my heart\" and \"the old mad joy in the depths of my soul, . . .\" Whitman's \"in the depths of\" occurs verbatim in Ether 6:6: \"buried in the depths of the sea, . . .\" Remarkably, this improbably four-word phrase occurs not just in Ether 6, but also in 1 Nephi 8:32; 1 Nephi 18:10,15,20; 2 Nephi 9:42; Mosiah 4:11; Mosiah 21:14; Alma 63:8; Ether 2:25; 3 Nephi 9:4,6,8; and 3 Nephi 10:13. Thus, Whitman's four-word phrase is completely reproduced an incredible FOURTEEN TIMES in the Book of Mormon! Other four-word phrases taken from Whitman (recently identified by Dr. Dr. Walter Reade, personal correspondence, Sept. 8, 2002) include \"I am a man,\" \"be of good cheer,\" \"there is no God,\" \"to sing the song,\" \"to go to battle,\" \"out of the land,\" out of my breast,\" \"from time to time,\" \"many hundred years hence,\" \"the pains of hell\" and \"born of a woman.\" And there are even more that we will consider below.\n\nThe phrase \"many hundred years hence\" is particularly unusual--a phrase almost never used in typical English writings, yet its fingerprint on the Book of Mormon in Jacob 7:7 identifies Whitman as the source, who wrote: \"A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them, . . .\" Both Joseph Smith (writing as Jacob) and Whitman were discussing events that allegedly would happen in the future, and both use this unusual phrase in that context.\n\nAny honest statistician will confirm that the odds of more than one four-word or especially more than one five-word passage accidentally occurring in identical form and order in another unrelated text is astronomically small. The arguments of those who disagree--Mormon apologists, no doubt--can be dismissed as utterly lacking credibility or intellectual honesty. Thus, the case for Whitman as the true source of the Book of Mormon is already certain. But there is a mountain of further ammunition to be used, especially if we are to drive Mormons from their intellectual foxholes and the delusion of \"testimony.\" Naturally, our vigorous assault on their beliefs, however ludicrous, is motivated by nothing but genuine love for these dear but pathetically deceived cultists. And so, let us bring out the ammo.\n\n2013 Update: Computerized Finds Fuel the Fury!\n\nMany thanks to Ben McGuire, who at my request kindly applied his computerized tools to compare the Book of Mormon text with Leaves of Grass, revealing even more five-word parallels. Here is the list, which can no longer be thought of as merely a smoking gun--it's more like a smoking missile launcher that has score a devastating direct hit on the Book of Mormon.\n\nBen McGuire's List of Five Word Parallels\n\nall the inhabitants of the\n\nall the land of the\n\nall the lands of the\n\nam i that i should\n\nand all that in them\n\nand i know that the\n\nand i will make a\n\nand in all these things\n\nand in the name of\n\nand that they are the\n\nare the children of the\n\nas he did in the\n\nat the feet of the\n\nat the head of the\n\nborn of a woman and\n\nby day and by night\n\nby the light of the\n\nby the mouths of the\n\nfrom the face of the\n\nfrom the top of the\n\ni am the son of\n\ni do not deny the\n\ni do not know what\n\ni know not but the\n\ni speak the word of\n\ni will tell you what\n\nif they are not the\n\nin the midst of the\n\nin the midst of you\n\nmen of that city and\n\nof me i am the\n\nof the body or the\n\nof the earth all the\n\nof the earth and i\n\nof the earth and the\n\nof the earth cannot be\n\nof the first year of\n\nof the justice of the\n\nof the land and the\n\nof the sea and the\n\nof the souls of men\n\nof the women and children\n\nof the world and all\n\nof the world for all\n\non the face of the\n\nout of the earth and\n\nout of the land and\n\nout of the land of\n\nsee that the word of\n\nsome of the words of\n\nson of god shall come\n\nstand in the presence of\n\nthat there is no god\n\nthe beginning and the end\n\nthe face of the earth\n\nthe inhabitants of the earth\n\nthe lands of the earth\n\nthe meaning of all things\n\nthe men of that city\n\nthe midst of the sea\n\nthe rest of the earth\n\nthe righteous and the wicked\n\nthe three hundred and sixty\n\nthe west to the east\n\nthe world i do not\n\nthem and i will make\n\nthis is what i have\n\nthose who do not believe\n\nthou hast given us a\n\nto sing the song of\n\nto stand in the presence\n\nupon the hearts of the\n\nwe know not but that\n\nwho do not believe in\n\nArmed with this kind of overwhelming evidence, it is not a trivial matter to see how Joseph Smith constructed the Book of Mormon. As he plodded along, randomly selecting themes from Whitman's Leaves of Grass for his text, he would frequently pause and flip open his early preview copy of Whitman's not-quite-published text, saying to himself, \"I could really use four or five words now to complete this sentence.\" Then bingo, his eyes would fall upon a phrase such as \"this is what i have\" or \"and i will make a\" and then he's simply blurt that out for his scribe to write down. With the help of Whitman's text, writing another book became a trivial exercise. No wonder it only took a few weeks to \"translate\" so many pages.\n\nIt's All Over: Six and Seven-Word Parallels!\n\nUpdate from May 30, 2002: I just found a stunning SIX-WORD PARALLEL in a passage so typical of Whitman and the Book of Mormon, a passage dealing with obedience and faith. Here is the original from Whitman:\n\nOf obedience, faith, adhesiveness;\n\nAs I stand aloof and look there is to me something profoundly affecting in large masses of men following the lead of those who do not believe in men.\n\nThis line was sloppily plagiarized in Mormon 9:1:\n\nAnd now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in Christ.\n\nExact five-word parallels are more than enough evidence to convict Joseph Smith of fraud, but here we have SIX WORDS lifted with NO CHANGE in order, grammar, spelling--an exact and surprising copy of the words as well as the themes of Whitman.\n\nBut it gets much worse. As we shall see below, there is a shameless SEVEN-WORD PARALLEL that Joseph boldly lifted from Whitman. Did he think we wouldn't notice??\n\nAfter all that, I was rather shocked to find a full SEVEN-WORD parallel in the Book of Mormon, lifted straight from the Leaves of Grass, and even placed in the same context as Whitman's passage. So much of Joseph's work had been plagiarized with deftness, with signs of intelligent efforts to hide the crime. Then how could he have been so clumsy? If only Fawn Brodie were still with us (some days I think she is), she could no doubt look into Joseph's mind and tell us what was going on during his work, but without her skills, we can only speculate. Perhaps Joseph was overly tired, or perhaps he let the inexperienced Oliver Cowdery have a hand in the plagiarism in the middle of the Book of Alma. But whatever the source, we have an example of plagiarism in Alma 37:37 that should forever close the case against the Book of Mormon. Here is the offending passage:\n\nCounsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.\n\nCompare this to the following passage from Whitman, in section 40 of his most famous poem, \"Song of Myself\" (p. 74 in the Norton Critical Edition):\n\nSleep--I and they keep guard all night,\n\nNot doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\n\nI have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\n\nAnd when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\n\nThe SEVEN-WORD PHRASE (yes, seven!) \"and when you rise in the morning\" has only been changed microscopically in the Book of Mormon, replacing \"you rise\" with \"thou risest\" to give it a King James Version twang, but all will recognize that these are the same words. Thus, we have seven words lifted straight from Whitman--absolutely unaccountable except by BLATANT and SHAMELESS PLAGIARISM.\n\nBut there is more! Notice that Whitman's use of this unique phrase is in the context of sleep, and of being guarded and protected in sleep by one who loves and cares for the sleeper. This is exactly the case for Alma 37:37. Even the word \"sleep\" in that verse has been plagiarized from Whitman.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, my beloved Mormon brothers and sisters, honest people everywhere, look at the evidence! The case now is so strong, that the best descriptive words I can craft are these (feel free to quote me): \"It is over. It is over. It is over.\" (No, Charles Larson did not come up with my phrase first.)\n\nOf course, staunch apologists will argue that these are \"just a few examples\" of apparent plagiarism in \"only a handful of sentences\" that do nothing to account for the contents and stories of the Book of Mormon. To remove any foundation for such deceptive arguments, let us take a more sweeping look at the Book of Mormon, which shows evidence of plagiarism throughout.\n\nPlagiarism from Start to End: The Epigraph\n\nLet us begin with the first words of Whitman's Leaves of Grass found in his epigraph:\n\nCome, said my soul,\n\nSuch verses for my Body let us write, (for we are one,)\n\nThat should I after return, . . .\n\nFrom the opening verses of Whitman, we see themes that would be repeated throughout the Book of Mormon: the soul, the body, the writing of verses, unity and oneness, and returning (e.g., from the dead, or after being scattered). For example, the phrase \"my soul\" appears numerous times (1 Ne. 8:12; 15:25; 16:24; 17:47; 2 Ne. 1:15, 16, 21; 4:15, 17, 26-31; etc., etc.). The word \"come\" occurs in the same verse as the phrase \"my soul\" four times (2 Nephi 1:21, 2 Nephi 11:6, 2 Nephi 26:10, and Alma 31:31).\n\n2 Nephi 11:1-2,6 contains the following parallels to the Epigraph's first two lines:\n\n1 And now, Jacob spake [= said] many more things to my people at that time; nevertheless only these things have I caused to be written, for the things which I have written sufficeth me.\n\n2 And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah [=verses], for my soul delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him. . . .\n\n6 And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save Christ should come all men must perish.\n\nMost of the concepts in Whitman's first two lines are found in the opening lines of 2 Nephi 11!\n\nOf the Soul and Body\n\nWe have already noted Whitman's use of \"my soul\" and \"my body\" in his opening lines. Later Whitman writes \"I too with my soul and body.\" Interestingly, the phrase \"soul and body\" or \"body and soul\" occur in the Book of Mormon as well:\n\n1 Nephi 19:7: \"of great worth, both to the body and soul. . . .\"\n\n2 Nephi 1:22: \"the eternal destruction of both soul and body.\"\n\n2 Nephi 20:18: \"his fruitful field, both soul and body;\"\n\n2 Nephi 20:18 is actually a remarkably strong parallel to Whitman, for the entire verse introduces several concepts from a single pair of Whitman's lines. Here is 2 Nephi 20:18:\n\nAnd shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.\n\nAnd here is the related passage from Whitman:\n\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the field the world,\n\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\n\nWho would ever think of linking field, body, and soul? Whitman does, and so does Joseph Smith in 2 Nephi 20:18. Talk about finding fingerprints! (And as we shall see later, this passage from Whitman was also lifted in the story of Lehi's vision of the tree of life!)\n\nFurther, the basic Mormon teaching that the body is divine is lifted from the pages of Whitman as well:\n\n\"Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and includes and is the soul;\n\n\"Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body, or any part of it! . . .\"\n\n\"If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, . . .\"\n\nAs a further examine of specific body and soul language common to Whitman and the Book of Mormon, compare Whitman's \"O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul . . .\" with Alma 40:18, \"the reuniting of the soul with the body.\" Note that a three-word phrase closely joined with a two-word phrase has been borrowed, but Joseph has clumsily reversed the order of Whitman's phrases, a common technique used by plagiarists to cover their tracks.\n\nAn interesting grouping of words occurs seven times in the Book of Mormon: \"the souls of men\" (see in 1 Nephi 14:3; 1 Nephi 15:35; Alma 40:7; Alma 40:9; Helaman 8:28; 3 Nephi 28:9; Mormon 5:8; and Ether 12:4). This VERY PHRASE is found in Whitman, a four-word fingerprint exposing the plagiarism of Joseph Smith--and he uses this phrase in a religious discussion about eternal progress, so characteristic of Mormon theology! Here is an excerpt from Whitman:\n\n. . . the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe.\n\nOf the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance.\n\nBut notice that Whitman doesn't just say \"the souls of men\"--he says \"OF the souls of men.\" This FIVE-WORD PHRASE is used VERBATIM in both Alma 40:7 and Alma 40:9:\n\n7 I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this time of death to the time appointed for...\n\n9 . . . space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired\n\nPrevious scholars arguing for plagiarism in the Book of Mormon would have been on much stronger ground if they could have offered such examples as these, with exact five-word parallels common to the Book of Mormon and any other text (apart from the Old Testament, of course, which the Book of Mormon text makes a point of quoting--quotation with attribution is not plagiarism, if we are to be intellectually honest). The fact that I have found MULTIPLE five-word clusters from Whitman that are copied verbatim in the Book of Mormon--and even an amazing SEVEN-WORD parallel--is evidence of the highest order (seen so far, anyway) for plagiarism.\n\nOne more example on the theme of souls: Just as Whitman speaks of the souls of men and women, 3 Nephi 17:25 likewise speaks of \"two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.\" (And of course, this recalls the five-word parallel to Whitman found in Alma 14:10, \"of the women and children.\") One can only wonder if there's an original idea anywhere in the Book of Mormon?\n\nWhitman and the Resurrection\n\nNot only does Whitman speak of the body and the soul in language similar to the Book of Mormon, but also speaks often of the theme of resurrection and immortality, concepts that permeate the Book of Mormon, often using language from Whitman as well Whitman's concepts. From Whitman, we have:\n\n\"I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,\n\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\"\n\n\"Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.\"\n\n\"But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard the ship!\n\n\"Ship of the body, ship of the soul, voyaging, voyaging, voyaging.\"\n\n\"Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal; . . .\"\n\n\"I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!\"\n\nAlma 40:18 also speaks of \"the reuniting of the soul with the body--one of many resurrection passages using words and concepts from Whitman. A very Whitmanesque passage on resurrection (the joining of soul and body) is found in Alma 11:44:\n\nNow, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, . . .\n\nThis universal gift to all, including the bond and the free (e.g., masters and slaves, prisoners and others), is described in language similar to this passage from Whitman:\n\n. . . all the masters with their slaves, Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\nAll the hapless silent lovers,\n\nAll the prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,\n\nAll the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying, Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\nI too with my soul and body, . . .\n\nWe have previously noted the shameless FIVE-WORD PARALLEL, \"the righteous and the wicked\". Surely Whitman was Joseph's source. (Note that Whitman suggested and even praised the trek of pioneers long before the rise of another well-known copier, Brigham Young.)\n\nConcerning events after death, Whitman provides the phrase, \"return in the body and the soul, / Indifferently before death and after death,\" with a suspiciously similar construction repeated in Alma 12:27: \"it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment.\"\n\nMosiah 2:28 links the concepts of immortality and peace: \". . . that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above. . . .\" These concepts were first linked by Whitman: \"Now I absorb immortality and peace.\" But to fully appreciate the significance of Mosiah 2:28 in the debate over plagiarism, we must consider its context in the Book of Mormon passage known as King Benjamin's speech.\n\nKing Benjamin's Speech\n\nWe just saw that Mosiah 2:28 mentions words from Whitman. Mosiah 2:28 is one part of the well-known farewell speech of King Benjamin as he stood before the people from a tower (Mos. 2:7-8), looking out at them, an old (Mos. 2:26) but very spiritual man facing death (Mos. 2:28) with the contentment of a clear conscience (Mos. 2:15), looking to the time when he would \"shall stand to be judged of God\" (Mos. 2:27). The next verse (Mos. 2:28) was mentioned above, but I now give it in full:\n\nI say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.\n\nCompare these concepts with the context of Whitman's \"immortality and peace\" passage:\n\nI stand and look at the stars, which I think now never realized before.\n\nNow I absorb immortality and peace,\n\nI admire death and test propositions.\n\nHow plenteous! how spiritual! how resume!\n\nThe same old man and soul--the same old aspirations, and the same content.\n\nBut this is just the beginning of the parallels between Whitman and King Benjamin's speech. Whitman repeatedly states that he is no better than others, as does Benjamin in Mosiah 2:26 (\"I . . . am no better than ye are\").\n\nWhitman speaks repeatedly of towers and towering structures (e.g., \"lofty and dazzling towers\"), explaining the use of a tower for King Benjamin's speech. Surprisingly, one of Whitman's occurrences of towers is mentioned with other common objects of the Book of Mormon: \"With all the rest, visible, concrete [Helaman 3:7 gives \"cement\"--which is also found elsewhere in Whitman, as is the cement-like material \"adobie\"], temples [Alma 16:13 and others], towers [Alma 48:1 and 50:4] goods [Alma 31:24; 4 Nephi 1:25], machines [Jarom 1:8 mentions \"machinery\"] and ores [1 Nephi 17:9 and others], . . .\" This is consistent with a general pattern, wherein Joseph appears to fixate of small portions of Whitman--neglecting the vast majority of the work--and to weave those key passages into significant portions of the Book of Mormon.\n\n1 Nephi 1 Explained\n\nNot only does Joseph Smith plagiarize the opening words of Whitman in the alleged writings of Nephi, but Nephi's opening words themselves are also plagiarized--from the opening words of Book II of Whitman, no less, \"Starting from Paumanok.\" It's a double parallel, at least. Further, the basic themes of Nephi's writings are contained in these words from Whitman that open this portion of his text:\n\nStarting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,\n\nWell-begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother,\n\nAfter roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,\n\nDweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,\n\nOr a soldier camp'd or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a miner in California,\n\nOr rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat, my drink from the spring,\n\nOr withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,\n\nFar from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy,\n\nAware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of mighty Niagara,\n\nAware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and strong-breasted bull,\n\nOf earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow, my amaze,\n\nHaving studied the mocking-bird's tones and the flight of the mountain-hawk,\n\nAnd heard at dawn the unrivall'd one, the hermit thrush from the swamp-cedars,\n\nSolitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.\n\n2\n\nVictory, union, faith, identity, time,\n\nThe indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,\n\nEternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.\n\nThis then is life,\n\nHere is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.\n\nHow curious! how real!\n\nUnderfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.\n\nSee revolving the globe,\n\nThe ancestor-continents away group'd together,\n\nThe present and future continents north and south, with the isthmus between.\n\nTo those familiar with the Book of Mormon, no explanation will be needed to grasp the audacity of such obvious plagiarism as is found in the books of Nephi. However, given the obfuscation of Mormon apologists that is sure to follow, let me point out a handful of the many parallels between the above passage of Whitman and the alleged words of Nephi:\n\nFirst Nephi and Book II of Whitman both begin with a reference to birth.\n\nFirst Nephi and Book II of Whitman follow the mention of birth with reference to excellent parents--\"goodly parents\" in 1 Nephi 1:1 and a \"perfect mother\" in Whitman.\n\nBoth Nephi and Whitman mention the city of their birth.\n\nBoth refer to their extensive journeys.\n\nBoth refer to a diet of meat. Nephi wrote \"we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness\" in 1 Nephi 17:2.\n\nBoth refer to springs or \"fountains\" (e.g., the fountain of pure water in Lehi's dream in 1 Nephi 8).\n\nBoth refer to flowing rivers or streams (e.g., the river they called Laman in 1 Nephi 2:8)\n\nBoth involve camping in the wilds\n\nBoth discuss rocks and earth (e.g., the firmness of the Valley of Lemuel in 1 Nephi 2 or the altar of stones in 1 Nephi 2:7)\n\nBoth involve heading out to the New World\n\nBoth mention riches (e.g., 1 Nephi 3:16)\n\nBoth treat the topic of faith (e.g., 1 Nephi 1:20 and 1 Nephi 2:19\n\nBoth treat eternal progress (indeed, the whole story of Nephi's journey is used as a metaphor for our eternal progress--see Alma 37:37-47)\n\nBoth involve a quest for the promised land (\"divine soil\" in Whitman)\n\nBoth involve sailing around a major part of the globe\n\nBoth involve a new land with a narrow neck of land (isthmus).\n\nAnd many further parallels could be made from the single passage of Whitman cited above, but these 16 should eliminate any possibility that Joseph came up with so many parallels to Whitman by mere chance.\n\nAs if that were not evidence enough, look at the further evidence of plagiarism in 1 Nephi 1:8,9, which indicates that Lehi's vision included a view of Christ and twelve beings whose brightness is compared to heavenly objects:\n\n9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day.\n\n10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.\n\nThis passage is only slightly changed from Whitman's original text regarding a marvelous captain, of whom Whitman writes:\n\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\n\nAnd just as Whitman introduces these themes in the context of battle and surrender, so Lehi's vision deals with the pending battle for Jerusalem and the surrender of the Jews!\n\nThe vision about the pending destruction of Jerusalem sets the stage for Lehi's departure from Jerusalem and his journey to the New World. This concept, too, comes from Whitman, who wrote, \"You Jew journeying in your old age . . .\"--a clear parallel to Lehi. But the parallels become even more numerous as we turn to the subsequent ocean voyages of Lehi and other key figures in the Book of Mormon.\n\n\"But wait,\" the hardened Mormon apologist might answer, \"if there were plagiarism from Whitman in 1 Nephi 1, surely we should expect something more concrete that just thematic parallels, perhaps even something like a verbatim five-word parallel.\" An impossible demand? No! The hopes of the Mormon apologist are readily dashed by an appeal to fact: THERE IS ACTUALLY A SIX-WORD PARALLEL IN FIRST NEPHI CHAPTER ONE! 1 Nephi 1:14 shamelessly uses Whitman's complete six-word phrase, \"all the inhabitants of the earth\"! And in Whitman, this fingerprinted phrase occurs in the context of Whitman's vision of the world in the poem, \"Salut au Monde!\", just as 1 Nephi 1 discusses Lehi's vision. Such facts leave no refuge for benighted Mormon apologists! Who can deny the plagiarism of the Book of Mormon now?\n\nOcean Voyages by Ship\n\nWhitman speak frequently of ships and voyages by ship. In fact, he says that he \"moved away to distant continents,\" as did Nephi, Mulek, and the Jaredites. One passage in particular describes much of Nephi's ocean voyage and the voyage of the Jaredites, as well as the related discussions of books, faith, finding a new land, etc.:\n\nIn cabin'd ships at sea,\n\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\n\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\n\nOr some lone bark buoy'd on the dense marine,\n\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\n\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under many a star at night,\n\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\n\nIn full rapport at last. Here are our thoughts, voyagers' thoughts,\n\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\n\nThe sky o'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\n\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\n\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\n\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\n\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\n\nAnd this is ocean's poem.\n\nThen falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\n\nYou not a reminiscence of the land alone,\n\nYou too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos'd I know not whither, yet ever full of faith,\n\nConsort to every ship that sails, sail you!\n\nBear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it here in every leaf;)\n\nSpeed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the imperious waves,\n\nChant on, sail on, bear o'er the boundless blue from me to every sea,\n\nThis song for mariners and all their ships.\n\nThe parallels to the Book of Mormon are remarkable. Ocean voyages, and the thoughts of voyagers, are essential elements of the Book of Mormon. Nephites, Jaredites, Mulekites--they all crossed the sea to the New World, joyous and full of faith, coming in ships for the Nephites and Mulekites, or barks as recorded in the Book of Ether (note how even the unusual name Ether is plagiarized?), enduring waves and winds, to come to a promised land. And further, the writings of Nephi provide reminiscences of his former land, recorded in a book that he hopes will fulfill its destiny (see, for example, 2 Nephi 27, 1 Nephi 6, etc.). And Nephi's very first verse refers to \"mysteries,\" as does Whitman, and to his book or \"record,\" as does Whitman, and of the \"proceedings in my days,\" similar to the reminiscences of Whitman--again, Whitman explains 1 Nephi 1 without any doubt.\n\nThree concepts from Whitman's single phrase, \"spread your white sails my little bark athwart the imperious waves,\" are used on a single phrase of a verse in the Book of Mormon, Mormon 5:18: \"as a vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor.\" And of course, the concept of \"waves\" per se is found in the Book of Ether, discussed more below, and in Nephi's writings (e.g., 2 Nephi 8:15, and implicitly in the great storm on the sea of 1 Nephi 18:13).\n\nThe Book of Ether deserves particular focus, for \"ether\" is mentioned twice in the above-quoted passage from Whitman--surely the source for the unusual name of the Book of Ether--a book which just happens to describe the ocean voyage by barges (barks) of the Jaredites. Whitman speaks of a \"whistling winds,\" \"large imperious waves,\" and twice mentions at least one \"bark\" [=barge] \"cleaving the ether.\" Now examine Ether 2: 24,25:\n\n24 For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth.\n\n25 And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?\n\nPause for one stunning moment to realize that the FIVE-WORD phrase, \"the midst of the sea,\" is lifted VERBATIM from Whitman. Now look Ether 6:4-7:\n\n4 . . . and it came to pass that when they had done all these things they got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God [=faith].\n\n5 And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should be a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind.\n\n6 And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the depths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind.\n\n7 And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.\n\nFaith in God, crossing the sea, storms, imperious/ mountain waves, barks = barges or ark or vessels, and even the name of Ether--all these parallels to Whitman give away the true source of the Book of Mormon. What thinking person would ascribe these close, even intimate parallels, as the result of mere chance? Not I!\n\nAs always, there is more, much more. In a later passage, Whitman also uses the concepts of storms, ocean, and billowing waves:\n\nI see them raised high with stones by the marge [probably suggestive of \"barge\" to Joseph Smith] of restless oceans,that the dead men's spirits when they wearied of their quiet graves might rise up through the mounds and gaze on the tossing billows, and be refresh'd by storms, immensity, liberty, action.\n\nAnd as we saw above, Ether 6:5,6 contains similar words: \"face of the waters . . . tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind . . . mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the great and terrible tempests . . . . Even the phrase \"mountain waves\" in Ether may have been suggested by Whitman's combination of \"stones\" and \"mound\" in the context of waves and storms in his passage cited above, leaving precious little to Joseph Smith's ingenuity in creating the two verses above from Ether, or in creating the whole story of barges crossing the storm-tossed sea.\n\nIncredibly, Whitman uses a five-word phrase, \"the face of the sea,\" in a context involving waves, much as Joseph Smith does in Ether. Here is Whitman's passage:\n\n. . . the face of the sea\n\nalmost touching,\n\nThe boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves,\n\nLook at the brazen similarity to a related five-word phrase in Ether 6:5\n\n. . . the Lord God caused that there should be a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, . . .and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind.\n\nA five-word match followed by a sister two-word match should remove all doubt from those who would argue that the case for plagiarism is built on \"random coincidences.\" Mormons, wake up!\n\nBut there is still more along these lines! Consider this passage, which speaks of sailing the ocean to come to a new continent (the New World), and, of course, Whitman's characteristic concepts of oceans, ominous waves and depths of the sea (concepts that Joseph could not resist borrowing):\n\nIn I myself, in all the world, these currents flowing,\n\nAll, all toward the mystic ocean tending.\n\nCurrents for starting a continent new,\n\nOvertures sent to the solid out of the liquid,\n\nFusion of ocean and land, tender and pensive waves,\n\n(Not safe and peaceful only, waves rous'd and ominous too,\n\nOut of the depths the storm's abysmic waves, who knows whence?\n\nEven further, in his poem, \"With Antecedents\" in Leaves of Grass, Whitman further develops themes that would be incorporated into the Book of Mormon, themes of maritime journeys to new continents, of apostasy, religion, kings and kingdoms, prophets (oracles), and looking forward to great works many years in the future:\n\nWith antique maritime ventures, laws, artisanship, wars and journeys,\n\nWith the poet, the skald, the saga, the myth, and the oracle,\n\nWith the sale of slaves, with enthusiasts, with the troubadour, the crusader, and the monk,\n\nWith those old continents whence we have come to this new continent,\n\nWith the fading kingdoms and kings over there,\n\nWith the fading religions and priests,\n\nWith the small shores we look back to from our own large and present shores,\n\nWith countless years drawing themselves onward and arrived at these years,\n\nYou and me arrived--America arrived and making this year,\n\nThis year! sending itself ahead countless years to come.\n\nThe relationship of this passage to the Book of Mormon is so obvious--and so harmful to Mormon claims--that no further elaboration is needed.\n\nOne unusual aspect of Nephi's voyage is the use of the compass-like round ball of brass that Lehi found outside his tent one morning. The name \"Liahona\" may be derived from the name \"Lena\" that appears in Whitman. In any case, this object is introduced in 1 Nephi 16:10 as a \"round ball\" and is not called a \"compass\" until 1 Nephi 18:12 and 1 Nephi 18:21, where it is used on the ship while Lehi's family is sailing to the New World. In other words, the Book of Mormon calls it ball, until they are on the ship, and then it is \"the compass\"--clearly a \"mariner's compass.\" By now the reader may not be too surprised to learn that Whitman introduces this term--and does so in the context of sailing to the New World:\n\nThe plans, the voyages again, the expeditions;\n\nAgain Vasco de Gama sails forth,\n\nAgain the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass,\n\nLands found and nations born, thou born America,\n\nFor purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd,\n\nThou rondure of the world at last accomplish'd.\n\nThe Book of Mormon also refers to Nephi's ocean voyage as having a great purpose, one that led to the birth of the Nephite and Lamanite nations in the found land we now call the Americas, and the books also uses the word \"probation\" in the context Nephi's journey as well (1 Nephi 15:31,32). And this journey could not have succeeded without the miraculous \"mariner's compass.\" There is no room for coincidence with parallels so strong and specific.\n\nI could rest my case here, but there are many other topics that bear the mark of plagiarism. I shall choose only a few to further illustrate the overwhelming nature of the case against the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.\n\nRecords from the Jews and the New World\n\nThe Tanners and other renowned scholars are impressed to find the phrase \"in the records\" in both the Apocrypha and the Book of Mormon, but I find much more compelling parallels regarding \"records\" that point to Whitman as the actual source for the Book of Mormon. For example, Whitman writes, \"I hear the Hebrew reading his records,\" which so ably describes Nephi and Lehi. Whitman also speaks of \"records of the earth,\" foreshadowing the burial of gold plates in the earth by Moroni.\n\nWhitman not only is the source for the fascination with records in general in the Book of Mormon, but also introduces the concept of engraved records and records associated with the Egyptian language--showing that the whole concept of \"reformed Egyptian\" was plagiarized as well. Look at this tell-tale passage:\n\nI see Egypt and the Egyptians, I see the pyramids and obelisks.\n\nI look on chisell'd histories, records of conquering kings, dynasties, cut in slabs of sand-stone, or on granite-blocks, . . .\n\n\"Engraved (chiselled) histories cut in slabs (plates)\"--must we look any further to identify the true source of these concepts in the Book of Mormon?! And note that Whitman mentions such key Book of Mormon concepts as Jews, Hebrews, Egypt, Egyptian, the New World, America, all more or less in the context of \"records.\"\n\nTo remove all doubt, let me point out that Whitman is also the source for the coming forth of buried records from the Hill Cumorah through the work of the \"hero\" Joseph Smith! First, the very name Cumorah is derived from a word used several times by Whitman, \"Camerado.\" Now consider the following passage about ancient records and a hill:\n\nAs the Greek's signal flame, by antique records told,\n\nRose from the hill-top, like applause and glory,\n\nWelcoming in fame some special veteran, hero,\n\nWith rosy tinge reddening the land he'd served,\n\nJoseph Smith, that \"special veteran\" and \"hero\" in his own mind, serving his land and people, so he claimed, allegedly brought forth the \"antique records\" that \"rose\" from the earth out of a \"hill-top\"--an act that he prophesied would bring the attention (\"applause and glory\") of the world. His name, he said, would be had for good or evil around the world--resulting in the \"fame\" Whitman speaks of. And is it not more than coincidence that the plates themselves were richly gold colored--virtually having a \"rosy tinge\"?\n\nBut there are even more references to records and recording information in Whitman:\n\n\"The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records reach. . . .\"\n\n\"Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past, . . . \"\n\n\"Not a mark, not a record remains--and yet all remains. . . .\"\n\n\"All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded, . . .\"\n\nNear the end of his discourse, Whitman speaks of records (apparently roll = scroll, but \"recording\" in general is mentioned) preserved for future years--a theme found in the Book of Mormon:\n\nA special verse for you . . .your mystic roll strangely gather'd here, . . .\n\nHenceforth to be, deep, deep within my heart recording, for many future year,\n\nYour mystic roll entire of unknown names, or North or South,\n\nEmbalm'd with love in this twilight song.\n\nThis sounds much like Mormon in his twilight discourse over the many unknown names who perished in the final war of the Nephites, yet whose story would be preserved--buried deep, deep in the earth--to come forth like a mystic scroll of heartfelt recording after many future years.\n\nIn fact, Whitman appears to be the source for the specific story of Mormon, the great soldier, killed in battle, who nevertheless left us his story scrawled on golden tablets. Here is the relevant text from Whitman:\n\nI mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;\n\nMortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could understand,)\n\nThe halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose--yet this sign left,\n\nOn a tablet scrawl'd . . .\n\nMore generally, we can say that Joseph Smith and the Mormons are not the only ones who have expressed an interest in the Hebrews, ancient records, engravings and writing on tablets, multiple \"Bibles,\" genealogy, and the \"truthfulness\" of such things. In fact, such an interest must have been sparked by Joseph's study of Whitman's early text, for Whitman writes of \"the Hebrews, the ancient of ancients,\" and, quoting parts of a brief three-line passage, says:\n\nI respect . . . the Hebrews, . . .\n\nI see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception, . . .\n\nAnd so, no doubt, Joseph's fascination for these very topics was no act of religious creativity, but yet another expression of plagiarism! And of course, the words \"Bible\" (2 Nephi 29:3), \"accounts\" (3 Nephi 5:16, or \"account ... of old\" in Ether 8:9), \"genealogy\" (1 Nephi 3:3), etc., were apparently borrowed from Whitman.\n\nHere I say \"apparently\" borrowed, recognizing that we cannot determine with 100% certainty that EVERY instance of apparent plagiarism was due to actual plagiarism. To be intellectually honest and fair, as always, scholars such as I must recognize that chance parallels can occur sometimes, especially when only a single word or two is involved. But taken together, even a small subset of the parallels I present in this paper should provide conclusive evidence for Joseph Smith's heavy reliance on Whitman--and the parallels I provide only scratch the surface, for I based on the abundance that I have encountered in almost every place I search, there must be the thousands of parallels between Whitman and the Book of Mormon, far more than other scholars have found even after extensive digging in such ill-suited proposed sources as View of the Hebrews, Shakespeare, or the Apocrypha.\n\nTurning to a peripheral point related to the topic of records, the Book of Mormon provides an impressive three-word match to Whitman in a discussion of records. From Mormon 9:33: \"if we could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no imperfection in our record.\" The three-word phrase originates in Whitman: \"And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and can be none in the future, . . .\"\n\nStill not impressed? Then consider the Book of Mormon's unusual use of the term \"treasury\" with regard to the records of Jews. Mentioned in 1 Nephi 4:21, it was under the control of Nephi's relative and military commander, Laban, and contained the sacred brass plates that Nephi needed to take for their journey to the promised land. Other scholars have tried to suggest that this concept is related to the mention of records and a treasury in the Apocrypha, but Whitman is more compelling as the \"apparent\" source of this concept. Not only does Whitman speak extensively of records throughout his work, but he introduces the concept of a treasury in a way far too similar to the Book of Mormon to be a \"chance\" occurrence. Consider this passage:\n\nIt is not to be put in a book, it is not in this book, . . .\n\nYou may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,\n\nYou may read the President's message and read nothing about it there,\n\nNothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury department, or in the daily papers or weekly papers,\n\nOr in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts of stock.\n\nNot only does Whitman speak books, reports, accounts and other records, but he explicitly links these concepts to an official treasury. Further, he does so in the context of major political and military leaders (e.g., the President, analogous to Laban in the Book of Mormon), who had authority over the treasury (as did Laban), and also does this in the context of written texts in various languages (analogous to the Hebrew and Egyptian writings apparently in Laban's treasury) and other valuable items--all clearly showing that Whitman is the source for the story of Laban's treasury and the plates of brass--or Leaves of Brass, if you will, almost as if Joseph subconsciously wanted to acknowledge his source!\n\nReligious Discourse about Christ\n\nThe Book of Mormon is about a group of Jews (Hebrews) in new lands who were waiting for their Messiah, Jesus Christ. This foundational concept, like virtually all foundational concepts of the Book of Mormon, originated with Whitman, who wrote:\n\nYou Jew journeying in your old age . . .\n\nYou other Jews waiting in all lands for your Messiah!\n\nThis presages Lehi, the prophet from Jerusalem wandering in his old age, looking forward to the coming of the Messiah, and teaching that Jews in all lands look to the coming of the Messiah. Further, note that the Book of Mormon plagiarizes a five-word phrase from Whitman on this very topic, identifying who this Messiah is: \"the son of God shall come,\" a phrase repeated three times in the Book of Mormon, as previously noted (Alma 9:26, Alma 11:35, and Alma 21:7). But the evidence for plagiarism is much deeper than simply the incredible \"coincidence\" of five exact word being repeated in the exact order and with essentially the exact meaning found in the Book of Mormon. The evidence of plagiarism become overwhelming when one considers the context of Whitman's passage, which is rife with Book of Mormon themes. The context comes from a Whitman poem called \"Passage to India,\" which immediately suggests the Book of Mormon theme of migration by boat between the Old and New Worlds. Now look at the actual paragraph from which Joseph Smith stole the phrase \"[the] Son of God shall come\":\n\nAfter the seas are all cross'd, (as they seem already cross'd,)\n\nAfter the great captains and engineers have accomplish'd their work,\n\nAfter the noble inventors, after the scientists, the chemist, the geologist, ethnologist,\n\nFinally shall come the poet worthy that name,\n\nThe true son of God shall come singing his songs.\n\nThen not your deeds only O voyagers, O scientists and inventors, shall be justified,\n\nAll these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth'd,\n\nAll affection shall be fully responded to, the secret shall be told,\n\nAll these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hook'd and link'd together,\n\nThe whole earth, this cold, impassive, voiceless earth, shall be completely Justified,\n\nTrinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted by the true son of God, the poet,\n\n(He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains, . . .)\n\nThe themes of ocean crossing, justification, works and deeds, the healing of our pains, the work of the Godhead (Trinitas) being accomplished by the son of God--what more obvious source for Book of Mormon themes could there be? But compare the Whitman passage to the relevant passages in the Book of Mormon for even more surprising evidence of plagiarism! They also discuss salvation from sins and other themes in the above passage. I leave the details as an exercise for the reader.\n\nThe Book of Mormon's focus on Christ (the Messiah) is also explained by other passages in Whitman, including:\n\n\"I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful God the Christ, . . .\"\n\n\"Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and poems,\n\n\"From this side, lo! the Lord Christ gazes-\"\n\n\". . . underneath Christ the divine I see . . .\"\n\n\"I see Christ eating the bread of his last supper in the midst of youths and old persons,\"\n\n\"Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the Christ himself,\n\n\"Dead and divine and brother of all,\"\n\nEven the LDS concept of Christ as the \"brother\" of all mankind is found first in Whitman (though they may say Christ is nevertheless much more than \"just\" their elder brother).\n\nThe Book of Mormon gives specific prophecies about the crucifixion of Christ, and refers to his pierced hands and feet and side (3 Nephi 11:14,15). Whitman employs the same symbols:\n\nThis cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,\n\nThe spear thrust in thy side.\n\nWhitman also uses the word \"atonement,\" which is highly characteristic of the Book of Mormon.\n\nScholarly critics of Mormon religion have long understood that the Book of Mormon's persistent emphasis on Christ, coupled with the pivotal role of Christ in Mormon theology, as well as Mormon religious adoration of Christ, constant discussion and teaching regarding Christ as Savior and Messiah, and the seemingly sincere attempt/desire of faithful Mormons to emulate Christ, were all part of a sinister attempt by Joseph Smith to convince people--including members of his own church--that Mormons believed in Christ and were Christian. However, the source for Joseph's deception was unclear--until now. Walt Whitman was the inspiration for the Christ-centered theology of the Book of Mormon. And Whitman, an atheist, obviously did not believe in Christ in the least, yet felt moved to write eloquently of the true son of God. Whitman, the atheist, wrote deceptively about Christ, undoubtedly serving as a mentor and guide--whether he recognized it or not--for the essence of Book of Mormon, and as the direct source for so much of its contents. I could rest my case with this one section of my argument alone, and convince all but vilest of Mormon apologists. But with an eye to the salvation of their souls, I will provide even more devastating evidence of plagiarism, leaving the benighted apologists utterly without excuse if they still resist my logic.\n\nForts, Breastworks, and Defensive Structures:\n\nThe Book of the Alamo--or the Book of Alma?\n\nPrevious scholars of Mormonism have erred in pointing to a brief discussion of Indian mounds in a book by James Adair as the source for defensive walls of earth in the Book of Mormon. Whitman offers something much more convincing. Section 34 of \"Song of Myself\" in Leaves of Grass, referring to the defense of the fort at Alamo, is a virtual blueprint for the battle scenes in the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon. It is filled with terms and concepts that Joseph Smith relied on over and over again. It is no coincidence that the book that borrows most heavily from Whitman's tale of the Alamo should itself bear a similar name: Alma = Alamo with only a slight shift in vowels, the kind of thing any beginner in the Hebrew language would recognize as perfectly natural for a would-be Semitic work. Here is part of the Alamo passage, so which any honest person will instantly recognize as the source for much of the book of Alma:\n\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\n\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\n\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\n\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\n\n'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.\n\nRetreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,\n\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,\n\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\n\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of war.\n\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\n\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\n\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\n\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\n\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\n\nHere I shall highlight only a few of the military parallels that could be made to the fortifications described in the Book of Mormon, particularly in the Book of Alma/Alamo:\n\nAlamo was a fort, and Whitman uses the word \"fort\" to describe it. The Book of Alma frequently mentions forts and fortifications as well (Alma 48:8,9; Alma 49: 13,19; Alma 50:10; Alma 51:23, 27; Alma 52: 2,5,17; Alma 53:7; Alma 55:25).\n\nWhitman describes the bravery of valiant young men at the Alamo, just as Alma describes the bravery of the valiant 2,000 \"stripling warriors\" (Alma 53, etc.).\n\nThe unusual word \"breastwork\" is used in reference to a military defense against enemy attacks in both the Book of Mormon (Alma 54:4) and in the Alamo passage.\n\nWhitman later uses the word \"breastwork\" again in the context of white men defending themselves against an Indian attack, so similar to the Nephite use of breastworks against the Lamanites. From Whitman:\n\nThe battle-bulletin,\n\nThe Indian ambuscade, the craft, the fatal environment,\n\nThe cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism,\n\nIn the midst of their little circle, with their slaughter'd horses for breastworks,\n\nThe fall of Custer and all his officers and men.\n\nIn another military passage, Whitman speaks of \"entrenchments\"--a reference to ditches dug for defensive purposes, much as in the Book of Mormon (Alma 48:8; 49:18; 53:3-4).\n\nThe parallel to trenches that are dug, resulting in defensive heaps of earth, is clearly and concisely stated in Whitman's phrase, \"we dig the trenches and gather the heaps.\"\n\nIn the preface note to his second annex, \"Good-bye My Fancy\" in Leaves of Grass (p. 539 of the Norton Critical Edition), Whitman writes of \"marches, battles, carnage--those trenches hurriedly heap'd by corpse-thousands\"--concepts strikingly similar to those of Alma.\n\nJust as some Book of Mormon forts in Alma employ defensive lines formed by raising earth, so also Whitman speaks of forts and lines of raised earth together:\n\nRude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,\n\nI see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay . . .\n\nThe defensive use of entrenchments that result in protective mounds of earth in the Book of Mormon is further hinted at in Whitman's passage, \"Now of the older war-days, . . . he stands on the intrench'd hills amid a crowd of officers.\" (Also perhaps the source of great battles being held on the Hill Cumorah/Ramah in the Book of Mormon.)\n\nBoth Whitman and the Book of Mormon refer to enemy soldiers dying in these trenches. Alma 49:22 describes defensive trenches filling up in part with the bodies of advancing enemy soldiers, which is quite similar to a passage from Whitman:\n\nThe war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,\n\nAnd again the advance of the armies.\n\nNoiseless as mists and vapors,\n\nFrom their graves in the trenches ascending, . . .\n\nThe brief truce after battle, with grim burial-squads, and the deep-fill'd trenches\n\nOf gather'd from dead all America, North, South, East, West,\n\nWhitman mentions forts several times, as does the Book of Mormon.\n\nAlma 50:2,3 speaks of the \"frame of pickets\" that were placed on top of the ridges of earth that surrounded the protected cities. Likewise, Whitman speaks of \"pickets\" in a military context: \"Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark, . . .\"\n\nWithin a span of just two lines (discussed in more detail later), Whitman mentions Native American \"mound-builders,\" relics in Central America, and the Hebrews in the context of ancient lore, thus undoubtedly suggesting to Joseph Smith the concept of ancient Hebrews in the Americas who built defensive works comprising great mounds of earth--an astonishing set of parallels clearly indicative of plagiarism.\n\nWhile some writers have pointed to weak parallels between James Adair and the Book of Mormon regarding walls of earth (breastworks) and defensive structures of earth used in war, much richer and more extensive parallels are found in Whitman.\n\nWhitman's Alamo/Alma passage also describes the marching of prisoners of war, an event also found in Alma 57: 13-16, in which Lamanite prisoners were sent under guard of Nephite soldiers to the land of Zarahemla, only to escape on the way, as described in Alma 57:28-33, where the specific word \"marching\" is used in verse 31.\n\nAlso note that Whitman's Alamo passage makes much of large numbers of enemies killed by small numbers of defenders, a theme common in the Book of Mormon and Alma in particular.\n\nImportantly, Whitman's emphasis on the youth of the defenders at Alamo strongly parallels the account in Alma chapters 53 and 56 to 58, which tells of the 2000 valiant converted Lamanite young men from the people of Ammon, the \"stripling warriors\" or \"sons of Helaman.\" Whitman uses a lesser number, \"four hundred and twelve young men,\" but importantly, he uses a specific number of young soldiers, as does the Book of Mormon. These aren't ordinary soldiers, but, as Whitman explains,\n\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\n\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\n\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\n\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\n\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\n\nCompare these extreme accolades with those in Alma 53:20-21:\n\n20 And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all--they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.\n\n21 Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.\n\nCan there be any doubt that the story of the 2000 \"young men\" and valiant soldiers of Alma 53 is derived from the \"four hundred and twelve young men\" of Whitman?\n\nMilitary Description in General\n\nThe Book of Mormon describes scalping of enemies (Alma 44:12-15), attackers who put paint on their faces (Alma 3:13) or dyed their skin with blood (3 Nephi 4:7), who made frightening sounds when attacking (3 Nephi 4:9), who had war parties, who undertake secret marches to surprise and slaughter their enemies (Alma 52:22 and others), and who killed by swinging sharp weapons (Enos 1:20; Mosiah 9:16; Alma 2:12). Incredibly, all these concepts can be found in one concise passage of Whitman:\n\nThe drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and guttural exclamations,\n\nThe setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march,\n\nThe single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter of enemies;\n\nThe evidence of plagiarism is simply overwhelming. Further, Whitman's use of the word \"slaughter\" is reflected over a dozen times in the Book of Mormon, typically in a military context involving the slaughter of enemies. For example, Mosiah 10:20 says, \"we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them.\"\n\nOther relevant war concepts in Whitman include the following:\n\n\"And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\n\nThe making of perfect soldiers. . . .\n\n\" I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\n\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance and retreat, victory deferr'd and wavering,\n\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the field the world,\n\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\n\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\n\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\n\nAgain, numerous Book of Mormon themes appear to have been first conceived by Whitman.\n\nLehi's Dream\n\nOften emphasized by Mormons as one of the most important \"revelations\" in the Book of Mormon, Lehi's dream in 1 Nephi 8 depicts many elements suspiciously similar to elements in Whitman. Ever looking for shortcuts, Joseph Smith plagiarizes from himself when he repeats this dream a few chapters later (1 Nephi 11), now experienced by Nephi but with added interpretation. Look at the obvious parallels to Whitman:\n\nBe it so, then I answer'd,\n\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\n\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance and retreat, victory deferr'd and wavering,\n\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the field the world,\n\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,...\n\nLikewise, Nephi saw this dream with guidance from a Shade = Spirit (1 Nephi 10:1-6), and Lehi saw a man in a white robe who appears to him in the dream (1 Nephi 8:5). Both Nephi and Lehi saw people moving toward eternal life and others falling away into darkness--the concept of \"advance and retreat\" or \"victory . . . and wavering\" or \"life and death\" from Whitman. And in 1 Nephi 8:20, Lehi saw \"a spacious field, as if it had been the world,\" clearly lifting the linkage of field and world from Whitman. And in the very next verse, Lehi saw people \"pressing forward\" in parallel again with the term \"advance\" in this passage from Whitman.\n\nThe dream also includes \"mists of darkness\" (1 Nephi 12:17), and in the very next verse, mentions that \"the large and spacious building, which thy father saw, is vain imaginations and the pride of the children of men\" (1 Nephi 12:18). The arrogant people of this building laughed at those making their journey through the mists toward the tree of life (1 Nephi 8:27). Incredibly, these concepts also come from a single passage of Whitman:\n\nBut in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\n\nWearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,\n\nWhile scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord. . . .\n\nMormons, I'm not making this stuff up! Check it out for yourselves.\n\nThe Hand and Spirit of God\n\nTwo common Book of Mormon themes pertain to \"the hand of God,\" a four-word phrase used 20 times (or 29 times if we include the plural form, \"the hands of God\"), and \"the Spirit of God,\" another four-word phrase used 12 times in Joseph Smith's text. Is it any surprise that these vitally important four-word phrases are directly lifted from Whitman? In fact, they come from two adjacent lines in the following passage, filled with themes that later would be pawned off as \"novel\" LDS doctrine:\n\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,\n\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\n\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\n\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters. . . .\n\nNotice that Whitman introduces his pair of four-word phrases in the context of \"peace and knowledge,\" while twice using the phrase \"I know\" in typical \"Mormon testimony\" style. Is it any surprise that the Book of Mormon, as well as Mormon doctrine in general, so closely ties the concept of the Spirit of God to peace, knowledge, revelation, and testimony? Of the many examples that could be cited, consider these few Whitmanesque verses from the Book of Mormon:\n\nAlma 5:46: \"Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God.\"\n\nAlma 24:30 And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness,\n\nAlma 38:6 Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things.\n\nJoseph must have written the book of Alma shortly after reading of the spirit of God in Whitman's text, for it is a consistent theme in Alma.\n\nNote the last example from Alma 38:6 uses nearly every word of Whitman's line, \"And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\" including the phrase \"I know\" and \"the spirit of God,\" as well as other words like \"is,\" \"that,\" and \"the.\" Whitman's \"my own\" becomes \"myself\" in Alma 38:6, and \"brother\" becomes \"son,\" and the trivial word \"and\" has been deleted, but these cosmetic changes fail to conceal the egregious theft of AN ENTIRE THIRTEEN-WORD PHRASE FROM A FOURTEEN-WORD LINE from the pages of Whitman. But to be conservative and fair to the utmost, we shall not claim this as a perfect thirteen-word parallel, though its impact on the validity of the Book of Mormon could hardly be greater if Joseph had not made those few trivial changes.\n\nAnd what is the knowledge that Whitman's text links to the spirit of God? It is the knowledge that all men are brothers, a typical LDS theme. In fact, another verse in Alma likewise links Whitman's four-word phrase to the word \"brethren\":\n\nAlma 7:5: \"And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla, . . .\n\nHaving clearly established that Joseph plagiarized Whitman's unusual grouping of knowing or knowledge with the phrase \"the spirit of God,\" one might naturally wonder if Joseph did the same for the sister phrase, \"the hand of God,\" which is also introduced with the same language, \"I know that.\" Of course, the answer is a resounding YES! Consider these examples:\n\nMosiah 27:36 \"And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.\"\n\nAlma 17:9 \". . . an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.\n\nAlma 29:9 \"I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.\"\n\nMormon 5:23 \"Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not that he hath all power, and at his great command the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll?\"\n\nThe last two verses are especially indicative of plagiarism. Alma 29:9 exactly follows Whitman's form: \"I know that . . . the hands of God. . . .\" This one verse alone should be enough to establish my hypothesis, but it is but one brick in a vast fortress of doom for the Book of Mormon.\n\nBy now, even the most skeptical reader will have detected a persistent pattern in this tale of plagiarism, pattern that we will continue to develop in the hopes of reaching, perhaps, one more soul.\n\nAnimals, Plants, and Minerals\n\nWhitman is clearly the source for many animal species and minerals or metals mentioned in the Book of Mormon:\n\nI see the nomadic tribes with herds of oxen and cows,\n\nI see the table-lands notch'd with ravines, I see the jungles and deserts,\n\nI see the camel, the wild steed, the bustard, the fat-tail'd sheep,the antelope, and the burrowing wolf\n\nI see the highlands of Abyssinia,\n\nI see flocks of goats feeding, and see the fig-tree, tamarind, date,\n\nAnd see fields of teff-wheat and places of verdure and gold.\n\nI see the Brazilian vaquero,\n\nI see the Bolivian ascending mount Sorata,\n\nI see the Wacho crossing the plains, I see the incomparable rider of horses with his lasso on his arm,\n\nI see over the pampas the pursuit of wild cattle for their hides.\n\nCompare the above to 1 Nephi 18:25:\n\nAnd it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And we did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper.\n\nOr consider Ether 9:18:\n\nAnd also all manner of cattle, of oxen, and cows, and of sheep, and of swine, and of goats, and also many other kinds of animals which were useful for the food of man.\n\nAs for other species in Whitman, note that wolf is found in 2 Nephi 21: 6 and 30:12; Alma 5:59, and 3 Nephi 14:15. Horses are also mentioned in Enos 1:21 and elsewhere. Wheat is mentioned in Mosiah 9:9 and elsewhere. Figs are mentioned in 3 Nephi 14:16.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has long been criticized for the inclusion of the word \"honey bee\" in Ether 2:3 (though to be fair, it does not say that there were honey bees in the New World--they occur in an Old World context). But at least we can now recognize where Joseph Smith got this idea: from Whitman, who mentions \"honey-bees\" in the phrase, \"Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon.\"\n\nScholars have long puzzled over the source of Joseph's seemingly novel introduction of elephants into the Book of Mormon (Ether 9:19). The mystery is now solved. Whitman writes, \"In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones, . . .\" Whitman's mastodons undoubtedly inspired Joseph to add elephants to his work.\n\nTurning to things arboreal, Whitman's use of the general term \"tree\" obviously inspires much of the Book of Mormon. For example, Whitman links soil and trees in the passage, \"(Tallying Earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultuous waves,)\", much as trees and soil (i.e., the nurtured earth or the medium for planting) are linked repeatedly in the lengthy parable of the olive tree in Jacob 5. Whitman's phrases, \"As some perennial tree out of its roots\" and \"Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree\" both link trees and roots, as does Jacob 5 (e.g., verse 8, \"the root of this tree will perish\"), Alma 5: 52, and Alma 32: 37-41.\n\nWhitman also mentions specific trees found in the Book of Mormon, such as the fir tree (\"conical firs\" in Whitman) that is mentioned in 2 Nephi 24:8; the oak tree in 2 Nephi 12:14 and 2 Nephi 16:13; the fig tree (discussed above); the olive tree (\"You olive-grower tending your fruit on fields of Nazareth\"--akin to Jacob 5); and the cedar in 2 Nephi 12:13, 2 Nephi 19:10, and 2 Nephi 24:8.\n\nAs for minerals, let us look at metals in particular, for virtually every reference to metals in the Book of Mormon can be traced to Whitman. Key metals in the Book of Mormon include brass (brass plates), gold (gold plates), silver, and steel (e.g., Laban's sword and Nephi's bow). Amazingly, all of these are mentioned in a single phrase of Whitman: \"golden brass and silvery steel.\" Whitman also discusses iron, as does the Book of Mormon. Brass gets further emphasis from Whitman in the phrase \"the great box bound with brass,\" suggestive of the box used to store the plate, or perhaps suggestive of the seal on the metal plates that Joseph Smith would receive. In passing, one can hardly fail to notice that Whitman is the source for the concept of sealed writing, for he offers this tell-tale phrase: \"receiv'd writing and seal.\"\n\nWhitman as Translator and Seer?\n\nWhitman's writings are filled with references to his prophetic and visionary status. \"I am afoot with my vision,\" he writes, or later, \"I wander all night in my vision, . . .\" Or consider this prophet-like passage:\n\nAs in a waking vision,\n\nE'en while I chant I see it rise, I scan and prophesy outside and in,\n\nWe have previously noted that the Book of Mormon contains a five-word phrase, \"the face of the earth,\" taken from a classic Whitman passage on prophecy, freedom, and the reality of visions and the spiritual world--all themes at the core of the Book of Mormon. From Whitman:\n\nWhat else is so real as mine?\n\nLibertad and the divine average, freedom to every slave on the face of the earth,\n\nThe rapt promises and lumine of seers, the spiritual world, these centuries-lasting songs,\n\nAnd our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announcements of any.\n\nMuch could be said for many of the numerous verses that plagiarize from Whitman's passage above. As one typical example, consider 1 Nephi 22:2,3:\n\nAnd I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all things made known unto the prophets, which shall come upon the children of men according to the flesh.\n\n3 Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual; for it appears that the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the earth, and also among all nations.\n\nNephi refers to the future captivity of the House of Israel and their scattering on all the face of the earth, as foretold by prophets and seers who wrote of the temporal and spiritual world in their songs centuries ago. The influence of Whitman in this passage goes far beyond the five or six words that are directly lifted.\n\nMuch more from Whitman could be quoted, showing the real inspiration that caused Joseph Smith to both serve as and write about prophets, seers, and men who have visions. Not surprisingly, Whitman's concept of the prophetic man includes the gift of translating! Recall that Joseph Smith made much of his alleged gift to translate ancient sacred writings--writings about heaven and hell, about the soul and the body, writings filled with poetry--into the new tongue of English. As we shall see, these themes are solidly Whitmanesque, for it was Whitman who wrote:\n\nI am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\n\nThe pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,\n\nThe first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into new tongue.\n\nAnother related passage from Whitman gives further insights into several Book of Mormon concepts:\n\nEvery existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,\n\nHe resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and any man translates, and any man translates himself also,\n\nOne part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees how they join.\n\n(Peripheral note: borrowing from Whitman's \"bestow it upon\", the Book of Mormon uses \"bestow ... upon,\" and \"bestow upon\" or \"bestoweth upon\" at least 7 times!)\n\nCompare Whitman above to Mosiah 8:13, where we read of seers and their miraculous gift to translate ancient records and foreign tongues:\n\nNow Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.\n\nIn addition to Whitman serving as the source for translating ancient tongues, he also introduces the very concept of seers. In his poem \"Eidolons,\" for example, he states, \"I met a seer.\" Was he sarcastically referring to young Joseph Smith? Further, what did Whitman mean when he wrote, \"Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?\" Most scholars who have studied Whitman in depth agree that this line was probably written AFTER 1830, so we may ask if Whitman here makes a veiled reference to the \"prophetical\" role he played for his boyhood friend, Joseph Smith. And one may even wonder if Whitman was perhaps in on the fraud himself--an issue which I cover in depth in my soul-saving book, The Fraud Makers (see the cover above, and get price information in the Summary section at the end of this page).\n\nOpposition in All Things:\n\nWhitman and 2 Nephi 2\n\nPrevious scholars have long puzzled over the sophisticated philosophical discourse of Lehi in 2 Nephi 2, who treats ancient and profound themes in a manner that seemed utterly beyond what an uneducated Joseph Smith could have fabricated. The only reasonable source for the philosophical depth of 2 Nephi 2 and much of the rest of the Book of Mormon is not Spaulding, Ethan Smith, the Apocrypha, or any other commonly accused source, but that philosopher of the heart himself, Walt Whitman.\n\nFor example, the previously quoted passage above from Whitman (the one beginning with \"Every existence\" and mentioning parts that join rather than counteract) involves themes from 2 Nephi 2, such as the nature of \"existence\" (2 Nephi 2:25) and the joining of diverse parts in 2 Nephi 2:11: \"there is an opposition in all things . . . all things must needs be a compound in one\"). And many further passages of Whitman further develop these themes. For example, Whitman writes, \"Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase,\" much like the themes of opposition leading to progress in 2 Nephi 2. And in Whitman's \"uncollected manuscript fragments\"--one of the poems he considered including in Leaves of Grass (see the Norton Critical Edition, op. cit., p. 691), he writes:\n\nDivine is the person/ body - it is all - it is the soul also How can there be immortality, except through mortality?\n\nThis is a key theme of 2 Nephi 2 and other parts of the Book of Mormon, that death and the Fall of man were necessary to bring about eternal life and the resurrection.\n\nThe discussion of Adam and the Garden of Eden (2 Nephi 2 and many other places in the Book of Mormon) is also found in Whitman's poem \"To the Garden the World\" in Book IV, \"Children of Adam.\"\n\n2 Nephi 2:20 contains a four-word phrase that is a dead give-away for its true source. The phrase is \"of all the earth,\" referring to how Adam and Eve \"have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all the earth.\" How can Mormon defenders explain the easily-confirmed fact that Whitman twice employs the very same four-word phrase, \"of all the earth\"? Here are our two examples:\n\n\"To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth, . . .\"\n\n\"Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love.\"\n\nThe second example offers a suspiciously close parallel to 2 Nephi 2:20, for in the five lines preceding Whitman's second usage of \"of all the earth,\" we learn that the female antecedent of \"her\" is \"an ancient sorrowful mother . . . mourning her shrouded hope and heir\"--in parallel to Joseph Smith's mention of that ancient mother of all, Eve, and her heirs, the family of all the earth.\n\nThis single example from 2 Nephi 2:20 of an exact four-word phrase from Whitman in a context so similar to Whitman's should convince any intelligent reader that plagiarism has occurred. But this little finger left many prints. In fact, Whitman's exact four-word"
