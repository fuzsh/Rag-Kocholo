O henceforth,\n\nElements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick, and audacious;\n\nA world primal again--vistas of glory, incessant and branching;\n\nA new race, dominating previous ones, and grander far, with new contests,\n\nNew politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts.\n\nThese my voice announcing--I will sleep no more, but arise;\n\nYou oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you, fathomless,\n\nstirring, preparing unprecedented waves and storms.\n\n19.\n\nSee! steamers steaming through my poems!\n\nSee in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing;\n\nSee in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut, the flat-boat, the\n\nmaize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods village;\n\nSee, on the one side the Western Sea, and on the other the Eastern Sea, how\n\nthey advance and retreat upon my poems, as upon their own shores;\n\nSee pastures and forests in my poems--See animals, wild and tame--See,\n\nbeyond the Kanzas, countless herds of buffalo, feeding on short\n\ncurly grass;\n\nSee, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets, with\n\niron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce;\n\nSee the many-cylindered steam printing-press--See the electric telegraph,\n\nstretching across the Continent, from the Western Sea to Manhattan;\n\nSee, through Atlantica's depths, pulses American, Europe reaching--pulses\n\nof Europe, duly returned;\n\nSee the strong and quick locomotive, as it departs, panting, blowing the\n\nsteam-whistle;\n\nSee ploughmen, ploughing farms--See miners, digging mines--See the\n\nnumberless factories;\n\nSee mechanics, busy at their benches, with tools--See, from among them,\n\nsuperior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, dressed in working\n\ndresses;\n\nSee, lounging through the shops and fields of the States, me, well-beloved,\n\nclose-held by day and night;\n\nHear the loud echoes of my songs there!

Always the priceless delta of Louisiana!\n\nAlways the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas!\n\nAlways California's golden hills and hollows--and the silver mountains of\n\nNew Mexico! Always soft-breathed Cuba!\n\nAlways the vast slope drained by the Southern Sea--inseparable with the\n\nslopes drained by the Eastern and Western Seas!\n\nThe area the eighty-third year of these States[1]--the three and a half\n\nmillions of square miles;\n\nThe eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the main--the\n\nthirty thousand miles of river navigation,\n\nThe seven millions of distinct families, and the same number of dwellings--\n\nAlways these, and more, branching forth into numberless branches;\n\nAlways the free range and diversity! Always the continent of Democracy!\n\nAlways the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travellers, Canada,\n\nthe snows;\n\nAlways these compact lands--lands tied at the hips with the belt stringing\n\nthe huge oval lakes;\n\nAlways the West, with strong native persons--the increasing density there--\n\nthe habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning invaders;\n\nAll sights, South, North, East--all deeds, promiscuously done at all times,\n\nAll characters, movements, growths--a few noticed, myriads unnoticed.\n\nThrough Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering.\n\nOn interior rivers, by night, in the glare of pine knots, steamboats\n\nwooding up:\n\nSunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the valleys of the\n\nPotomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys of the Roanoke and Delaware;\n\nIn their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks the\n\nhills--or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink;\n\nIn a lonesome inlet, a sheldrake, lost from the flock, sitting on the\n\nwater, rocking silently;\n\nIn farmers' barns, oxen in the stable, their harvest labour done--they rest\n\nstanding--they are too tired;\n\nAfar on arctic ice, the she-walrus lying drowsily, while her cubs play\n\naround;\n\nThe hawk sailing where men have not yet sailed--the farthest polar sea,\n\nripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes;\n\nWhite drift spooning ahead, where the ship in the tempest dashes.\n\nOn solid land, what is done in cities, as the bells all strike midnight\n\ntogether;\n\nIn primitive woods, the sounds there also sounding--the howl of the wolf,\n\nthe scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the elk;\n\nIn winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead Lake, in summer visible\n\nthrough the clear waters, the great trout swimming;\n\nIn lower latitudes, in warmer air, in the Carolinas, the large black\n\nbuzzard floating slowly, high beyond the tree-tops,\n\nBelow, the red cedar, festooned with tylandria--the pines and cypresses,\n\ngrowing out of the white sand that spreads far and flat;\n\nRude boats descending the big Pedee--climbing plants, parasites, with\n\ncoloured flowers and berries, enveloping huge trees,\n\nThe waving drapery on the live oak, trailing long and low, noiselessly\n\nwaved by the wind;\n\nThe camp of Georgia waggoners, just after dark--the supper-fires, and the\n\ncooking and eating by whites and negroes,\n\nThirty or forty great waggons--the mules, cattle, horses, feeding from\n\ntroughs,\n\nThe shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees--the\n\nflames--also the black smoke from the pitch-pine, curling and\n\nrising;\n\nSouthern fishermen fishing--the sounds and inlets of North Carolina's\n\ncoast--the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery--the large sweep-\n\nseines--the windlasses on shore worked by horses--the clearing,\n\ncuring, and packing houses;\n\nDeep in the forest, in piney woods, turpentine dropping from the incisions\n\nin the trees--There are the turpentine works,\n\nThere are the negroes at work, in good health--the ground in all directions\n\nis covered with pine straw.\n\n--In Tennessee and Kentucky, slaves busy in the coalings, at the forge, by\n\nthe furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking;\n\nIn Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long absence, joyfully\n\nwelcomed and kissed by the aged mulatto nurse.\n\nOn rivers, boatmen safely moored at nightfall, in their boats, under\n\nshelter of high banks,\n\nSome of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or fiddle--others\n\nsit on the gunwale, smoking and talking;\n\nLate in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing in the\n\nGreat Dismal Swamp-there are the greenish waters, the resinous odour, the\n\nplenteous moss, the cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree.\n\n--Northward, young men of Mannahatta--the target company from an excursion\n\nreturning home at evening--the musket-muzzles all bear bunches of\n\nflowers presented by women;\n\nChildren at play--or on his father's lap a young boy fallen asleep, (how\n\nhis lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!)\n\nThe scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Mississippi--he\n\nascends a knoll and sweeps his eye around.\n\nCalifornia life--the miner, bearded, dressed in his rude costume--the\n\nstaunch California friendship--the sweet air--the graves one, in\n\npassing, meets, solitary, just aside the horse-path;\n\nDown in Texas, the cotton-field, the negro-cabins--drivers driving mules or\n\noxen before rude carts--cotton-bales piled on banks and wharves.\n\nEncircling all, vast-darting, up and wide, the American Soul, with equal\n\nhemispheres--one Love, one Dilation or Pride.\n\n--In arriere, the peace-talk with the Iroquois, the aborigines--the\n\ncalumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and endorsement,\n\nThe sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then toward the\n\nearth,\n\nThe drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and guttural\n\nexclamations,\n\nThe setting-out of the war-party--the long and stealthy march,\n\nThe single-file--the swinging hatchets--the surprise and slaughter of\n\nenemies.\n\n--All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes, of these States--\n\nreminiscences, all institutions,\n\nAll these States, compact--Every square mile of these States, without\n\nexcepting a particle--you also--me also.\n\nMe pleased, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's fields,\n\nMe, observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies, shuffling\n\nbetween each other, ascending high in the air;\n\nThe darting swallow, the destroyer of insects--the fall-traveller\n\nsouthward, but returning northward early in the spring;\n\nThe country boy at the close of the day, driving the herd of cows, and\n\nshouting to them as they loiter to browse by the roadside;\n\nThe city wharf--Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans,\n\nSan Francisco,\n\nThe departing ships, when the sailors heave at the capstan;\n\nEvening--me in my room--the setting sun,\n\nThe setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the swarm of\n\nflies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre of the room,\n\ndarting athwart, up and down, casting swift shadows in specks on\n\nthe opposite wall, where the shine is.\n\nThe athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners;\n\nMales, females, immigrants, combinations--the copiousness--the\n\nindividuality of the States, each for itself--the money-makers;\n\nFactories, machinery, the mechanical forces--the windlass, lever, pulley--\n\nAll certainties,\n\nThe certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity;\n\nIn space, the sporades, the scattered islands, the stars--on the firm\n\nearth, the lands, my lands!\n\nO lands! O all so dear to me--what you are (whatever it is), I become a\n\npart of that, whatever it is.\n\nSouthward there, I screaming, with wings slow-flapping, with the myriads of\n\ngulls wintering along the coasts of Florida--or in Louisiana, with\n\npelicans breeding,\n\nOtherways, there, atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, the\n\nNueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the Saskatchewan,\n\nor the Osage, I with the spring waters laughing and skipping and\n\nrunning;\n\nNorthward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I, with parties\n\nof snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and aquatic plants;\n\nRetreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the crow\n\nwith its bill, for amusement--And I triumphantly twittering;\n\nThe migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh\n\nthemselves--the body of the flock feed--the sentinels outside move\n\naround with erect heads watching, and are from time to time\n\nrelieved by other sentinels--And I feeding and taking turns with\n\nthe rest;\n\nIn Canadian forests, the moose, large as an ox, cornered by hunters, rising\n\ndesperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his fore-feet, the\n\nhoofs as sharp as knives--And I plunging at the hunters, cornered\n\nand desperate;\n\nIn the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the\n\ncountless workmen working in the shops,\n\nAnd I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself than\n\nthe whole of the Mannahatta in itself,\n\nSinging the song of These, my ever-united lands--my body no more inevitably\n\nunited part to part, and made one identity, any more than my lands\n\nare inevitably united, and made ONE IDENTITY;\n\nNativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral plains,\n\nCities, labours, death, animals, products, good and evil--these me,--\n\nThese affording, in all their particulars, endless feuillage to me and to\n\nAmerica, how can I do less than pass the clue of the union of them, to\n\nafford the like to you?\n\nWhoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you also be\n\neligible as I am?\n\nHow can I but, as here, chanting, invite you for yourself to collect\n\nbouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?\n\n[Footnote 1: 1858-59.]\n\n_THE PAST-PRESENT._\n\nI was looking a long while for the history of the past for myself, and for\n\nthese chants--and now I have found it.\n\nIt is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither accept\n\nnor reject;)\n\nIt is no more in the legends than in all else;\n\nIt is in the present--it is this earth to-day;\n\nIt is in Democracy--in this America--the Old World also;\n\nIt is the life of one man or one woman to-day, the average man of to-day;\n\nIt is languages, social customs, literatures, arts;\n\nIt is the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery, politics,\n\ncreeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations,\n\nAll for the average man of to-day.\n\n_YEARS OF THE UNPERFORMED._\n\nYears of the unperformed! your horizon rises--I see it part away for more\n\naugust dramas;\n\nI see not America only--I see not only Liberty's nation but other nations\n\nembattling;\n\nI see tremendous entrances and exits--I see new combinations--I see the\n\nsolidarity of races;\n\nI see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's stage;\n\nHave the old forces played their parts? are the acts suitable to them\n\nclosed?\n\nI see Freedom, completely armed, and victorious, and very haughty, with Law\n\nby her side, both issuing forth against the idea of caste;\n\n--What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?\n\nI see men marching and countermarching by swift millions!\n\nI see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken;\n\nI see the landmarks of European kings removed;\n\nI see this day the People beginning their landmarks, all others give way;\n\nNever were such sharp questions asked as this day;\n\nNever was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God.\n\nLo! how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest;\n\nHis daring foot is on land and sea everywhere--he colonises the Pacific,\n\nthe archipelagoes;\n\nWith the steam-ship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the wholesale\n\nengines of war,\n\nWith these, and the world-spreading factories, he interlinks all geography,\n\nall lands;\n\n--What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the\n\nseas?\n\nAre all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe?\n\nIs humanity forming _en masse_?--for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;\n\nThe earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war;\n\nNo one knows what will happen next--such portents fill the days and nights.\n\nYears prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to pierce it,\n\nis full of phantoms;\n\nUnborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;\n\nThis incredible rush and heat--this strange ecstatic fever of dreams, O\n\nyears!\n\nYour dreams, O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether I\n\nsleep or wake!)\n\nThe performed America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,\n\nThe unperformed, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.\n\n_FLUX._\n\nOf these years I sing,\n\nHow they pass through convulsed pains, as through parturitions;\n\nHow America illustrates birth, gigantic youth, the promise, the sure\n\nfulfilment, despite of people--Illustrates evil as well as good;\n\nHow many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,\n\nobedience, compulsion, and to infidelity;\n\nHow few see the arrived models, the athletes, the States--or see freedom or\n\nspirituality--or hold any faith in results.\n\nBut I see the athletes--and I see the results glorious and inevitable--and\n\nthey again leading to other results;\n\nHow the great cities appear--How the Democratic masses, turbulent, wilful,\n\nas I love them,\n\nHow the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the sounding and\n\nresounding, keep on and on;\n\nHow society waits unformed, and is between things ended and things begun;\n\nHow America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of freedom, and\n\nof the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and of all that\n\nis begun;\n\nAnd how the States are complete in themselves--And how all triumphs and\n\nglories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,\n\nAnd how these of mine, and of the States, will in their turn be convulsed,\n\nand serve other parturitions and transitions.\n\nAnd how all people, sights, combinations, the Democratic masses, too,\n\nserve--and how every fact serves,\n\nAnd how now, or at any time, each serves the exquisite transition of Death.\n\n_TO WORKING MEN._\n\n1.\n\nCome closer to me;\n\nPush close, my lovers, and take the best I possess;\n\nYield closer and closer, and give me the best you possess.\n\nThis is unfinished business with me--How is it with you?\n\n(I was chilled with the cold types, cylinder, wet paper between us.)\n\nMale and Female!\n\nI pass so poorly with paper and types, I must pass with the contact of\n\nbodies and souls.\n\nAmerican masses!\n\nI do not thank you for liking me as I am, and liking the touch of me--I\n\nknow that it is good for you to do so.\n\n2.\n\nThis is the poem of occupations;\n\nIn the labour of engines and trades, and the labour of fields, I find the\n\ndevelopments,\n\nAnd find the eternal meanings.\n\nWorkmen and Workwomen!\n\nWere all educations, practical and ornamental, well displayed out of me,\n\nwhat would it amount to?\n\nWere I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman, what\n\nwould it amount to?\n\nWere I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that satisfy you?\n\nThe learned, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms;\n\nA man like me, and never the usual terms.\n\nNeither a servant nor a master am I;\n\nI take no sooner a large price than a small price--I will have my own,\n\nwhoever enjoys me;\n\nI will be even with you, and you shall be even with me.\n\nIf you stand at work in a shop, I stand as nigh as the nighest in the same\n\nshop;\n\nIf you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, I demand as good as\n\nyour brother or dearest friend;\n\nIf your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I must be\n\npersonally as welcome;\n\nIf you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for your sake;\n\nIf you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds, do you think I cannot\n\nremember my own foolish and outlawed deeds?\n\nIf you carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite side of the table;\n\nIf you meet some stranger in the streets, and love him or her--why I often\n\nmeet strangers in the street, and love them.\n\nWhy, what have you thought of yourself?\n\nIs it you then that thought yourself less?\n\nIs it you that thought the President greater than you?\n\nOr the rich better off than you?

diseased,\n\nbroken down, without innocence, without means.\n\n11.\n\nHer shape arises,\n\nShe less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever;\n\nThe gross and soiled she moves among do not make her gross and soiled;\n\nShe knows the thoughts as she passes--nothing is concealed from her;\n\nShe is none the less considerate or friendly therefor;\n\nShe is the best beloved--it is without exception--she has no reason to\n\nfear, and she does not fear;\n\nOaths, quarrels, hiccupped songs, smutty expressions, are idle to her as\n\nshe passes;\n\nShe is silent--she is possessed of herself--they do not offend her;\n\nShe receives them as the laws of nature receive them--she is strong,\n\nShe too is a law of nature--there is no law stronger than she is.\n\n12.\n\nThe main shapes arise!\n\nShapes of Democracy, total result of centuries;\n\nShapes, ever projecting other shapes;\n\nShapes of a hundred Free States, begetting another hundred;\n\nShapes of turbulent manly cities;\n\nShapes of the women fit for these States,\n\nShapes of the friends and home-givers of the whole earth,\n\nShapes bracing the earth, and braced with the whole earth.\n\n_ANTECEDENTS._\n\n1.\n\nWith antecedents;\n\nWith my fathers and mothers, and the accumulations of past ages:\n\nWith all which, had it not been, I would not now be here, as I am;\n\nWith Egypt, India, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome;\n\nWith the Kelt, the Scandinavian, the Alb, and the Saxon;\n\nWith antique maritime ventures,--with laws, artisanship, wars, and\n\njourneys;\n\nWith the poet, the skald, the saga, the myth, and the oracle;\n\nWith the sale of slaves--with enthusiasts--with the troubadour, the\n\ncrusader, and the monk;\n\nWith those old continents whence we have come to this new continent;\n\nWith the fading kingdoms and kings over there;\n\nWith the fading religions and priests;\n\nWith the small shores we look back to from our own large and present\n\nshores;\n\nWith countless years drawing themselves onward, and arrived at these years;\n\nYou and Me arrived--America arrived, and making this year;\n\nThis year! sending itself ahead countless years to come.\n\n2.\n\nO but it is not the years--it is I--it is You;\n\nWe touch all laws, and tally all antecedents;\n\nWe are the skald, the oracle, the monk, and the knight--we easily include\n\nthem, and more;\n\nWe stand amid time, beginningless and endless--we stand amid evil and good;\n\nAll swings around us--there is as much darkness as light;\n\nThe very sun swings itself and its system of planets around us:\n\nIts sun, and its again, all swing around us.\n\n3.\n\nAs for me, (torn, stormy, even as I, amid these vehement days;)\n\nI have the idea of all, and am all, and believe in all;\n\nI believe materialism is true, and spiritualism is true--I reject no part.\n\nHave I forgotten any part?\n\nCome to me, whoever and whatever, till I give you recognition.\n\nI respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;\n\nI adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god;\n\nI see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without\n\nexception;\n\nI assert that all past days were what they should have been;\n\nAnd that they could nohow have been better than they were,\n\nAnd that to-day is what it should be--and that America is,\n\nAnd that to-day and America could nohow be better than they are.\n\n4.\n\nIn the name of these States, and in your and my name, the Past,\n\nAnd in the name of these States, and in your and my name, the Present time.\n\nI know that the past was great, and the future will be great,\n\nAnd I know that both curiously conjoint in the present time,\n\nFor the sake of him I typify--for the common average man's sake--your sake,\n\nif you are he;\n\nAnd that where I am, or you are, this present day, there is the centre of\n\nall days, all races,\n\nAnd there is the meaning, to us, of all that has ever come of races and\n\ndays, or ever will come.\n\n_SALUT AU MONDE!_\n\n1.\n\nO take my hand, Walt Whitman!\n\nSuch gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!\n\nSuch joined unended links, each hooked to the next!\n\nEach answering all--each sharing the earth with all.\n\nWhat widens within you, Walt Whitman?\n\nWhat waves and soils exuding?\n\nWhat climes? what persons and lands are here?\n\nWho are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?\n\nWho are the girls? who are the married women?\n\nWho are the three old men going slowly with their arms about each others'\n\nnecks?\n\nWhat rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?\n\nWhat are the mountains called that rise so high in the mists?\n\nWhat myriads of dwellings are they, filled with dwellers?\n\n2.\n\nWithin me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;\n\nAsia, Africa, Europe, are to the east--America is provided for in the west;\n\nBanding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,\n\nCuriously north and south turn the axis-ends;\n\nWithin me is the longest day--the sun wheels in slanting rings--it does not\n\nset for months.\n\nStretched in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the\n\nhorizon, and sinks again;\n\nWithin me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,\n\nMalaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.\n\n3.\n\nWhat do you hear, Walt Whitman?\n\nI hear the workman singing, and the farmer's wife singing;\n\nI hear in the distance the sounds of children, and of animals early in the\n\nday;\n\nI hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Tennessee

Canada;\n\nI hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule;\n\nI hear the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of the mosque;\n\nI hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches--I hear the\n\nresponsive bass and soprano;\n\nI hear the wail of utter despair of the white-haired Irish grandparents,\n\nwhen they learn the death of their grandson;\n\nI hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice, putting to sea at\n\nOkotsk;\n\nI hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, as the slaves march on--as the husky\n\ngangs pass on by twos and threes, fastened together with wrist-\n\nchains and ankle-chains;\n\nI hear the entreaties of women tied up for punishment--I hear the sibilant\n\nwhisk of thongs through the air;\n\nI hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms;\n\nI hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends of the\n\nRomans;\n\nI hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful God,\n\nthe Christ;\n\nI hear the Hindoo teaching his favourite pupil the loves, wars, adages,\n\ntransmitted safely to this day from poets who wrote three thousand\n\nyears ago.\n\n4.\n\nWhat do you see, Walt Whitman?\n\nWho are they

mariners of the world;\n\nSome are in storms--some in the night, with the watch on the look-out;\n\nSome drifting helplessly--some with contagious diseases.\n\nI behold the sail and steam ships of the world, some in clusters in port,\n\nsome on their voyages;\n\nSome double the Cape of Storms--some Cape Verde,--others Cape Guardafui,\n\nBon, or Bajadore;\n\nOthers Dondra Head--others pass the Straits of Sunda--others Cape Lopatka--\n\nothers Behring's Straits;\n\nOthers Cape Horn--others the Gulf of Mexico, or along Cuba or Hayti--others\n\nHudson's Bay or Baffin's Bay;\n\nOthers pass the

off the shore of Paumanok, quite still;\n\nI see ten fishermen waiting--they discover now a thick school of\n\nmossbonkers--they drop the joined sein-ends in the water,\n\nThe boats separate--they diverge and row off, each on its rounding course\n\nto the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers;\n\nThe net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,\n\nSome of the fishermen lounge in their boats--others stand negligently\n\nankle-deep in the water, poised on strong legs;\n\nThe boats are partly drawn up--the water slaps against them;\n\nOn the sand, in heaps and winrows, well out from

from your Western golden\n\nshores;\n\nThe countries there, with their populations--the millions _en masse_, are\n\ncuriously here;\n\nThe swarming market-places--the temples, with idols ranged along the sides,\n\nor at the end--bronze, brahmin, and lama;\n\nThe mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman;\n\nThe singing-girl and the dancing-girl--the ecstatic person--the divine\n\nBuddha;\n\nThe secluded Emperors--Confucius himself--the great poets and heroes--the\n\nwarriors, the castes, all,\n\nTrooping up, crowding from all directions--from the Altay mountains,\n\nFrom Thibet--from the four winding and far-flowing rivers\n\nof China,\n\nFrom the Southern peninsulas, and the demi-continental islands--from\n\nMalaysia;\n\nThese, and whatever belongs to them, palpable, show forth to me, and are\n\nseized by me,\n\nAnd I am seized by them, and friendlily held by them,\n\nTill, as here, them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and for you.\n\n5.\n\nFor I too, raising my voice, join the ranks of this pageant;\n\nI am the chanter--I chant aloud over the pageant;\n\nI chant the world on my Western Sea;\n\nI chant, copious, the islands beyond, thick as stars in the sky;\n\nI chant the new empire, grander than any before--As in a vision it comes to\n\nme;\n\nI chant America, the Mistress--I chant a greater supremacy;\n\nI chant, projected, a thousand blooming cities yet, in time, on those\n\ngroups of sea-islands;\n\nI chant my sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes;\n\nI chant my stars and stripes fluttering in the wind;\n\nI chant commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work--races\n\nreborn, refreshed;\n\nLives, works, resumed--The object I know not--but the old, the Asiatic,\n\nresumed, as it must be,\n\nCommencing from this day, surrounded by the world.\n\nAnd you, Libertad of the world!\n\nYou shall sit in the middle, well-poised, thousands of years;\n\nAs to-day, from one side, the Princes of Asia come to you;\n\nAs to-morrow, from the other side, the Queen of England sends her eldest\n\nson to you.\n\nThe sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,\n\nThe ring is circled, the journey is done;\n\nThe box-lid is but perceptibly opened--nevertheless the perfume pours\n\ncopiously out of the whole box.\n\n6.\n\nYoung Libertad!\n\nWith the venerable Asia, the all-mother,\n\nBe considerate with her, now and ever, hot Libertad--for you are all;\n\nBend your proud neck to the long-off mother, now sending messages over the\n\narchipelagoes to you:\n\nBend your proud neck for once, young Libertad.\n\n7.\n\nWere the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?\n\nWere the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so long?\n\nWere the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while unknown, for\n\nyou, for reasons?\n\nThey are justified--they are accomplished--they shall now be turned the\n\nother way also, to travel toward you thence;\n\nThey shall now also march obediently eastward, for your sake, Libertad.\n\n_OLD IRELAND._\n\n1.\n\nFar hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty,\n\nCrouching over a grave, an ancient sorrowful mother,\n\nOnce a queen--now lean and tattered, seated on the ground,\n\nHer old white hair drooping dishevelled round her shoulders;\n\nAt her feet fallen an unused royal harp,\n\nLong silent--she too long silent--mourning her shrouded hope and heir;\n\nOf all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, because most full of love.\n\n2.\n\nYet a word, ancient mother;\n\nYou need crouch there no longer on the cold ground, with forehead between\n\nyour knees;\n\nO you need not sit there, veiled in your old white hair, so dishevelled;\n\nFor know you, the one you mourn is not in that grave;\n\nIt was an illusion--the heir, the son you love, was not really dead;\n\nThe Lord is not dead--he is risen again, young and strong, in another\n\ncountry;\n\nEven while you wept there by your fallen harp, by the grave,\n\nWhat you wept for was translated, passed from the grave,\n\nThe winds favoured, and the sea sailed it,\n\nAnd now, with rosy and new blood,\n\nMoves to-day in a new country.\n\n_BOSTON TOWN._\n\n1.\n\nTo get betimes in Boston town, I rose this morning early;\n\nHere's a good place at the corner--I must stand and see the show.\n\n2.\n\nClear the way there, Jonathan!\n\nWay for the President's marshal! Way for the government cannon!\n\nWay for the Federal foot and dragoons--and the apparitions copiously\n\ntumbling.\n\nI love to look on the stars and stripes--I hope the fifes will play \"Yankee\n\nDoodle,\"\n\nHow bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!\n\nEvery man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.\n\n3.\n\nA fog follows--antiques of the same come limping,\n\nSome appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless.\n\nWhy this is indeed a show! It has called the dead out of the earth!\n\nThe old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!\n\nPhantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!\n\nCocked hats of mothy mould! crutches made of mist!\n\nArms in slings! old men leaning on young men's shoulders!\n\nWhat troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all this chattering of bare\n\ngums?\n\nDoes the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for\n\nfirelocks, and level them?\n\nIf you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the President's\n\nmarshal;\n\nIf you groan such groans, you might baulk the government cannon.\n\nFor shame, old maniacs! Bring down those tossed arms, and let your white\n\nhair be;\n\nHere gape your great grandsons--their wives gaze at them from the windows,\n\nSee how well-dressed--see how orderly they conduct themselves.\n\nWorse and worse! Can't you stand it? Are you retreating?\n\nIs this hour with the living too dead for you?\n\nRetreat then! Pell-mell!\n\nTo your graves! Back! back to the hills, old limpers!\n\nI do not think you belong here, anyhow.\n\n4.\n\nBut there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it is,\n\ngentlemen of Boston?\n\nI will whisper it to the Mayor--He shall send a committee to England;\n\nThey shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the royal\n\nvault--haste!\n\nDig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-clothes, box\n\nup his bones for a journey;\n\nFind a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied\n\nclipper,\n\nUp with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer straight toward Boston\n\nbay.\n\n5.\n\nNow call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government\n\ncannon,\n\nFetch home the roarers from Congress,--make another procession, guard it\n\nwith foot and dragoons.\n\nThis centre-piece for them!\n\nLook, all orderly citizens! Look from the windows, women!\n\nThe committee open the box; set up the regal ribs; glue those that will not\n\nstay;\n\nClap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.\n\nYou have got your revenge, old bluster! The crown is come to its own, and\n\nmore than its own.\n\n6.\n\nStick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from this\n\nday;\n\nYou are mighty 'cute--and here is one of your bargains.\n\n_FRANCE, THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF THESE STATES._[1]\n\n1.\n\nA great year and place;\n\nA harsh, discordant, natal scream out-sounding, to touch the mother's heart\n\ncloser than any yet.\n\n2.\n\nI walked the shores of my Eastern Sea,\n\nHeard over the waves the little voice,\n\nSaw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wailing, amid the roar of\n\ncannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings;\n\nWas not so sick from the blood in the gutters running--nor from the single\n\ncorpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils;\n\nWas not so desperate at the battues of death--was not so shocked at the\n\nrepeated fusillades of the guns.\n\nPale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued retribution?\n\nCould I wish humanity different?\n\nCould I wish the people made of wood and stone?\n\nOr that there be no justice in destiny or time?\n\n3.\n\nO Liberty! O mate for me!\n\nHere too the blaze, the bullet, and the axe, in reserve to fetch them out\n\nin case of need,\n\nHere too, though long repressed, can never be destroyed;\n\nHere too could rise at last, murdering and ecstatic;\n\nHere too demanding full arrears of vengeance.\n\nHence I sign this salute over the sea,\n\nAnd I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,\n\nBut remember the little voice that I heard wailing--and wait with perfect\n\ntrust, no matter how long;\n\nAnd from to-day, sad and cogent, I maintain the bequeathed cause, as for\n\nall lands,\n\nAnd I send these words to Paris with my love,\n\nAnd I guess some _chansonniers_ there will understand them,\n\nFor I guess there is latent music yet in France--floods of it.\n\nO I hear already the bustle of instruments--they will soon be drowning all\n\nthat would interrupt them;\n\nO I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,\n\nIt reaches hither--it swells me to joyful madness,\n\nI will run transpose it in words, to justify it,\n\nI will yet sing a song for you, _ma femme!_\n\n[Footnote 1: 1793-4---The great poet of Democracy is \"not so shocked\" at\n\nthe great European year of Democracy.]\n\n_EUROPE, THE SEVENTY-SECOND AND SEVENTY-THIRD YEARS OF THESE STATES._[1]\n\n1.\n\nSuddenly, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,\n\nLike lightning it leaped forth, half startled at itself,\n\nIts feet upon the ashes and the rags--its hands tight to the throats of\n\nkings.\n\nO hope and faith!\n\nO aching close of exiled patriots' lives!\n\nO many a sickened heart!\n\nTurn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh.\n\n2.\n\nAnd you, paid to defile the People! you liars, mark!\n\nNot for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,\n\nFor court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his simplicity\n\nthe poor man's wages,\n\nFor many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken, and laughed at in the\n\nbreaking,\n\nThen in their power, not for all these did the blows strike revenge, or the\n\nheads of the nobles fall;\n\nThe People scorned the ferocity of kings.\n\n3.\n\nBut the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction, and the frightened\n\nrulers come back;\n\nEach comes in state with his train--hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,\n\nSoldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.\n\n4.\n\nYet behind all, lowering, stealing--lo, a Shape,\n\nVague as the night, draped interminably, head, front, and form, in scarlet\n\nfolds,\n\nWhose face and eyes none may see:\n\nOut of its robes only this--the red robes, lifted by the arm--\n\nOne finger crooked, pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake\n\nappears.\n\n5.\n\nBack to Full Books"
