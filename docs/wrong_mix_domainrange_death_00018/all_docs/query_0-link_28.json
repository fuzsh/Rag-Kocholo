        "text": "Conrad Busken Huet (born December 28?, 1826, The Hague, Netherlands—died June 1, 1886, Paris, France) was the greatest and also one of the liveliest Dutch literary critics of his time.\n\nA descendant of an old French Protestant family, Busken Huet studied theology at Leiden and became pastor of the Walloon chapel at Haarlem but resigned because of his modernist views. He turned to literary criticism and from 1863 to 1865 was an editor of the influential literary magazine De Gids (“The Guide”). After many disappointments, he left the Netherlands for the Dutch East Indies [now Indonesia], where he worked as a journalist. For the last years of his life he lived in Paris."
