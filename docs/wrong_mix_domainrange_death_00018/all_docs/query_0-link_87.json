        "text": "We waited on a wet Haarlem street, a shop of clock maker history.\n\nPainters carefully dip bucket brushed high on scaffolding at Beje.\n\nDoor opens, welcomed by tour guide her ebullient smile, we 20\n\nthe next English tour for Ten Boom Museum on Barteljorisstraat.\n\nHaarlem, Netherlands, in the seeming peaceful summer 2015.\n\nSaw straightaway quaint with warmth seeping love from walls,\n\nseized my hearts inspiration by adorned photos of Ten Boom family.\n\nCrimson draperies in parlor windows, piano upright, remembering.\n\nHer Majesty the Queen Wilhelmina of Netherlands, over the BBC\n\nradio, “Hello Hollander’s, the lights have gone out over Free Holland”.\n\nMay 1940, the German Blitzkrieg ravaged Netherland Dutch people.\n\nRevolting the Ten Boom family; father Casper, sisters Corrie, Betsie\n\nFervent Christians reverent respectful of Jews, “God’s ancient people”.\n\nNatzification slithered demonic annihilation of entire Jewish population.\n\nCasper stubborn stood alongside Jews in Nazi line, demanded a star.\n\nWith Gods love, engaging the Beje, made a safe-house for the resistance.\n\nCloset wall designed, built back of Corrie’s room hid six in upright stance.\n\nA buzzer installed gave a minute to hide, Jews, students, and intellectuals,\n\nClearing chess table, dinnerware, to appear there were only three there.\n\nA hundred food vouchers, had been provided to feed those fleeing in prayer.\n\nFebruary 28, 1944, a Dutch informant brought Gestapo to Ten Boom's shop door.\n\nRaided then kept under surveillance for the day, arresting 35, entire household.\n\nSix safely hidden in Corrie's closet, escaped 3 days later aided by Dutch resistance.\n\nCasper at 84, sent to Scheveningen prison, near the Hague, died soon after.\n\nCorrie and Betsie, bitterly remanded to nefarious Ravensbruk, now sister prisoners.\n\nRavensbruk, women’s concentration camp, with gas chambers, slave labor.\n\nDaily death toll count from disease, malnutrition, overwork and dark despair.\n\nFrom Holland, Russia, Poland, Germany and France, over hundred thousand\n\nkilled or died. Betsie would read a smuggled Bible, promised listeners spiritual survival.\n\nBetsie died at 59, on December 16, 1944, her Christmas season heavenly arrival.\n\nTwelve days from Betsiie’s death, came Corrie's providential release from Ravensbruk,\n\nA clerical error caused calling her number. One week later, Gestapo\n\ntaking all ladies her age to the Nazi gas chamber.\n\nBefore Betsie died, to Corrie she whispered, “There is no pit so deep that God’s love is not deeper still”.\n\nthen another, “God will give us the love to be able to forgive our enemies”\n\nAt 53, Corrie began her worldwide ministry, speaking in over sixty countries,\n\nspanning 32 years. Wrote a bestseller, “The Hiding Place”, later made into the movie.\n\nOn April 15, 1983, her 91st birthday, she died. She and her family had saved over 800 lives. The Jewish tradition states, only blessed people will die on their birthday.\n\nCorrie Ten Boom in grace and truth, blessed many lives.\n\nIt was my humble honor, to write this tribute to God's faithful woman, Corrie Ten Boom. My wife and I celebrating our 38th anniversary in Amsterdam, planned ahead to tour the Ten Boom Museum, a short train ride to Haarlem. It was just as I said, I felt love ooze from the walls and photos. We both carefully stepped into the now opened closet, where the six hid safely. Our imginations of what it would be like,were horrifying. Corrie's authenticity of faith, love and forgiveness is revealed in her book and the movie, \"The Hiding Place\".\n\nHer willingness to forgive enemies, a hard thing, is calling out to our hearts to also forgive those that have hurt us, she is an example of Christ's forgiveness to us.\n\nIt came to an amazing moment, when she saw the SS guard, at a speaking engagement. Her response is copied below, so you can read and understand, where from her love and forgiveness flowed.\n\nFrom https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/women/10-amazing-things-you-never-knew-about-corrie-ten-boom.html\n\n“It was at a church service in Munich that I saw him, a former S.S. man who had stood guard at the shower room door in the processing center at . He was the first of our actual jailers that I had seen since that time. And suddenly it was all there – the roomful of mocking men, the heaps of clothing, Betsie's pain-blanched face.\n\n“He came up to me as the church was emptying, beaming and bowing. ‘How grateful I am for your message, Fraulein.’ He said. ‘To think that, as you say, He has washed my sins away!’ His hand was thrust out to shake mine. And I, who had preached so often to the people in Bloemendaal the need to forgive, kept my hand at my side.\n\n“Even as the angry, vengeful thoughts boiled through me, I saw the sin of them. Jesus Christ had died for this man; was I going to ask for more? Lord Jesus, I prayed, forgive me and help me to forgive him. I tried to smile, I struggled to raise my hand. I could not. I felt nothing, not the slightest spark of warmth or charity. And so again I breathed a silent prayer. Jesus, I prayed, I cannot forgive him. Give me Your forgiveness.\n\n“As I took his hand the most incredible thing happened. From my shoulder along my arm and through my hand a current seemed to pass from me to him, while into my heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed me. And so I discovered that it is not on our forgiveness any more than on our goodness that the world's healing hinges, but on His. When He tells us to love our enemies, He gives, along with the command, the love itself.”\n\nMore infomation:\n\nhttp://tenboom.com/en/\n\nhttp://tenboom.org/aboutthetenboomsc48.html © on May 08 2018 05:07 AM PST, Steven Blake Horton boom • corrie • ten • war • world"
