        "text": "O TAKE my hand, Walt Whitman!\n\nSuch gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!\n\nSuch join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next!\n\nEach answering all--each sharing the earth with all.\n\nWhat widens within you, Walt Whitman?\n\nWhat waves and soils exuding?\n\nWhat climes? what persons and lands are here?\n\nWho are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?\n\nWho are the girls? who are the married women?\n\nWho are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about each\n\nother's necks?\n\nWhat rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?\n\nWhat are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?\n\nWhat myriads of dwellings are they, fill'd with dwellers?\n\nWithin me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;\n\nAsia, Africa, Europe, are to the east--America is provided for in the\n\nwest;\n\nBanding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,\n\nCuriously north and south turn the axis-ends;\n\nWithin me is the longest day--the sun wheels in slanting rings--it\n\ndoes not set for months;\n\nStretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the\n\nhorizon, and sinks again;\n\nWithin me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,\n\nMalaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.\n\nWhat do you hear, Walt Whitman?\n\nI hear the workman singing, and the farmer's wife singing;\n\nI hear in the distance the sounds of children, and of animals early\n\nin the day;\n\nI hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Tennessee and\n\nKentucky, hunting on hills;\n\nI hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing the wild horse;\n\nI hear the Spanish dance, with castanets, in the chestnut shade, to\n\nthe rebeck and guitar;\n\nI hear continual echoes from the Thames;\n\nI hear fierce French liberty songs;\n\nI hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative of old\n\npoems;\n\nI hear the Virginia plantation-chorus of negroes, of a harvest night,\n\nin the glare of pine-knots;\n\nI hear the strong baritone of the 'long-shore-men of Mannahatta;\n\nI hear the stevedores unlading the cargoes, and singing;\n\nI hear the screams of the water-fowl of solitary north-west lakes;\n\nI hear the rustling pattering of locusts, as they strike the grain\n\nand grass with the showers of their terrible clouds;\n\nI hear the Coptic refrain, toward sundown, pensively falling on the\n\nbreast of the black venerable vast mother, the Nile;\n\nI hear the bugles of raft-tenders on the streams of Kanada;\n\nI hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule;\n\nI hear the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of the mosque;\n\nI hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches--I hear\n\nthe responsive bass and soprano;\n\nI hear the wail of utter despair of the white-hair'd Irish\n\ngrandparents, when they learn the death of their grandson;\n\nI hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice, putting to sea\n\nat Okotsk;\n\nI hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, as the slaves march on--as the\n\nhusky gangs pass on by twos and threes, fasten'd together with\n\nwrist-chains and ankle-chains;\n\nI hear the entreaties of women tied up for punishment--I hear the\n\nsibilant whisk of thongs through the air;\n\nI hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms;\n\nI hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends of\n\nthe Romans;\n\nI hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful\n\nGod--the Christ;\n\nI hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the loves, wars,\n\nadages, transmitted safely to this day, from poets who wrote\n\nthree thousand years ago.\n\nWhat do you see, Walt Whitman?\n\nWho are they you salute, and that one after another salute you?\n\nI see a great round wonder rolling through the air;\n\nI see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, grave-yards, jails, factories,\n\npalaces, hovels, huts of barbarians, tents of nomads, upon the\n\nsurface;\n\nI see the shaded part on one side, where the sleepers are sleeping--\n\nand the sun-lit part on the other side,\n\nI see the curious silent change of the light and shade,\n\nI see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants of them, as\n\nmy land is to me.\n\nI see plenteous waters;\n\nI see mountain peaks--I see the sierras of Andes and Alleghanies,\n\nwhere they range;\n\nI see plainly the Himalayas, Chian Shahs, Altays, Ghauts;\n\nI see the giant pinnacles of Elbruz, Kazbek, Bazardjusi,\n\nI see the Rocky Mountains, and the Peak of Winds;\n\nI see the Styrian Alps, and the Karnac Alps;\n\nI see the Pyrenees, Balks, Carpathians--and to the north the\n\nDofrafields, and off at sea Mount Hecla;\n\nI see Vesuvius and Etna--I see the Anahuacs;\n\nI see the Mountains of the Moon, and the Snow Mountains, and the Red\n\nMountains of Madagascar;\n\nI see the Vermont hills, and the long string of Cordilleras;\n\nI see the vast deserts of Western America;\n\nI see the Lybian, Arabian, and Asiatic deserts;\n\nI see huge dreadful Arctic and Antarctic icebergs;\n\nI see the superior oceans and the inferior ones--the Atlantic and\n\nPacific, the sea of Mexico, the Brazilian sea, and the sea of\n\nPeru,\n\nThe Japan waters, those of Hindostan, the China Sea, and the Gulf of\n\nGuinea,\n\nThe spread of the Baltic, Caspian, Bothnia, the British shores, and\n\nthe Bay of Biscay,\n\nThe clear-sunn'd Mediterranean, and from one to another of its\n\nislands,\n\nThe inland fresh-tasted seas of North America,\n\nThe White Sea, and the sea around Greenland.\n\nI behold the mariners of the world;\n\nSome are in storms--some in the night, with the watch on the look-\n\nout;\n\nSome drifting helplessly--some with contagious diseases.\n\nI behold the sail and steamships of the world, some in clusters in\n\nport, some on their voyages;\n\nSome double the Cape of Storms--some Cape Verde,--others Cape\n\nGuardafui, Bon, or Bajadore;\n\nOthers Dondra Head--others pass the Straits of Sunda--others Cape\n\nLopatka--others Behring's Straits;\n\nOthers Cape Horn--others sail the Gulf of Mexico, or along Cuba or\n\nHayti--others Hudson's Bay or Baffin's Bay;\n\nOthers pass the Straits of Dover--others enter the Wash--others the\n\nFirth of Solway--others round Cape Clear--others the Land's\n\nEnd;\n\nOthers traverse the Zuyder Zee, or the Scheld;\n\nOthers add to the exits and entrances at Sandy Hook;\n\nOthers to the comers and goers at Gibraltar, or the Dardanelles;\n\nOthers sternly push their way through the northern winter-packs;\n\nOthers descend or ascend the Obi or the Lena;\n\nOthers the Niger or the Congo--others the Indus, the Burampooter and\n\nCambodia;\n\nOthers wait at the wharves of Manhattan, steam'd up, ready to start;\n\nWait, swift and swarthy, in the ports of Australia;\n\nWait at Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin, Marseilles, Lisbon, Naples,\n\nHamburg, Bremen, Bordeaux, the Hague, Copenhagen;\n\nWait at Valparaiso, Rio Janeiro, Panama;\n\nWait at their moorings at Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore,\n\nCharleston, New Orleans, Galveston, San Francisco.\n\nI see the tracks of the rail-roads of the earth;\n\nI see them welding State to State, city to city, through North\n\nAmerica;\n\nI see them in Great Britain, I see them in Europe;\n\nI see them in Asia and in Africa.\n\nI see the electric telegraphs of the earth;\n\nI see the filaments of the news of the wars, deaths, losses, gains,\n\npassions, of my race.\n\nI see the long river-stripes of the earth;\n\nI see where the Mississippi flows--I see where the Columbia flows;\n\nI see the Great River and the Falls of Niagara;\n\nI see the Amazon and the Paraguay;\n\nI see the four great rivers of China, the Amour, the Yellow River,\n\nthe Yiang-tse, and the Pearl;\n\nI see where the Seine flows, and where the Danube, the Loire, the\n\nRhone, and the Guadalquiver flow;\n\nI see the windings of the Volga, the Dnieper, the Oder;\n\nI see the Tuscan going down the Arno, and the Venetian along the Po;\n\nI see the Greek seaman sailing out of Egina bay.\n\nI see the site of the old empire of\n\nAssyria, and that of Persia, and\n\nthat of India;\n\nI see the falling of the Ganges over the high rim of Saukara.\n\nI see the place of the idea of the Deity incarnated by avatars in\n\nhuman forms;\n\nI see the spots of the successions of priests on the earth--oracles,\n\nsacrificers, brahmins, sabians, lamas, monks, muftis,\n\nexhorters;\n\nI see where druids walked the groves of Mona--I see the mistletoe and\n\nvervain;\n\nI see the temples of the deaths of the bodies of Gods--I see the old\n\nsignifiers.\n\nI see Christ once more eating the bread of his last supper, in the\n\nmidst of youths and old persons;\n\nI see where the strong divine young man, the Hercules, toil'd\n\nfaithfully and long, and then died;\n\nI see the place of the innocent rich life and hapless fate of the\n\nbeautiful nocturnal son, the full-limb'd Bacchus;\n\nI see Kneph, blooming, drest in blue, with the crown of feathers on\n\nhis head;\n\nI see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-beloved, saying to the people,\n\nDo not weep for me,\n\nThis is not my true country, I have lived banish'd from my true\n\ncountry--I now go back there,\n\nI return to the celestial sphere, where every one goes in his\n\nturn.\n\nI see the battle-fields of the earth--grass grows upon them, and\n\nblossoms and corn;\n\nI see the tracks of ancient and modern expeditions.\n\nI see the nameless masonries, venerable messages of the unknown\n\nevents, heroes, records of the earth.\n\nI see the places of the sagas;\n\nI see pine-trees and fir-trees torn by northern blasts;\n\nI see granite boulders and cliffs--I see green meadows and lakes;\n\nI see the burial-cairns of Scandinavian warriors;\n\nI see them raised high with stones, by the marge of restless oceans,\n\nthat the dead men's spirits, when they wearied of their quiet\n\ngraves, might rise up through the mounds, and gaze on the\n\ntossing billows, and be refresh'd by storms, immensity,\n\nliberty, action.\n\nI see the steppes of Asia;\n\nI see the tumuli of Mongolia--I see the tents of Kalmucks and\n\nBaskirs;\n\nI see the nomadic tribes, with herds of oxen and cows;\n\nI see the table-lands notch'd with ravines--I see the jungles and\n\ndeserts;\n\nI see the camel, the wild steed, the bustard, the fat-tail'd sheep,\n\nthe antelope, and the burrowing wolf.\n\nI see the high-lands of Abyssinia;\n\nI see flocks of goats feeding, and see the fig-tree, tamarind, date,\n\nAnd see fields of teff-wheat, and see the places of verdure and gold.\n\nI see the Brazilian vaquero;\n\nI see the Bolivian ascending Mount Sorata;\n\nI see the Wacho crossing the plains--I see the incomparable rider of\n\nhorses with his lasso on his arm;\n\nI see over the pampas the pursuit of wild cattle for their hides.\n\nI see little and large sea-dots, some inhabited, some uninhabited;\n\nI see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of Paumanok, quite\n\nstill;\n\nI see ten fishermen waiting--they discover now a thick school of\n\nmossbonkers--they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,\n\nThe boats separate--they diverge and row off, each on its rounding\n\ncourse to the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers;\n\nThe net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,\n\nSome of the fishermen lounge in their boats--others stand negligently\n\nankle-deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs;\n\nThe boats are partly drawn up--the water slaps against them;\n\nOn the sand, in heaps and winrows, well out from the water, lie the\n\ngreen-back'd spotted mossbonkers.\n\nI see the despondent red man in the west, lingering about the banks\n\nof Moingo, and about Lake Pepin;\n\nHe has heard the quail and beheld the honey-bee, and sadly prepared\n\nto depart.\n\nI see the regions of snow and ice;\n\nI see the sharp-eyed Samoiede and the Finn;\n\nI see the seal-seeker in his boat, poising his lance;\n\nI see the Siberian on his slight-built sledge, drawn by dogs;\n\nI see the porpoise-hunters--I see the whale-crews of the South\n\nPacific and the North Atlantic;\n\nI see the cliffs, glaciers, torrents, valleys, of Switzerland--I mark\n\nthe long winters, and the isolation.\n\nI see the cities of the earth, and make myself at random a part of\n\nthem;\n\nI am a real Parisian;\n\nI am a habitan of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Constantinople;\n\nI am of Adelaide, Sidney, Melbourne;\n\nI am of London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, Limerick;\n\nI am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, Brussels, Berne,\n\nFrankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, Florence;\n\nI belong in Moscow, Cracow, Warsaw--or northward in Christiania or\n\nStockholm--or in Siberian Irkutsk--or in some street in\n\nIceland;\n\nI descend upon all those cities, and rise from them again.\n\nI see vapors exhaling from unexplored countries;\n\nI see the savage types, the bow and arrow, the poison'd splint, the\n\nfetish, and the obi.\n\nI see African and Asiatic towns;\n\nI see Algiers, Tripoli, Derne, Mogadore, Timbuctoo, Monrovia;\n\nI see the swarms of Pekin, Canton, Benares, Delhi, Calcutta,\n\nYedo;\n\nI see the Kruman in his hut, and the Dahoman and Ashanteeman in their\n\nhuts;\n\nI see the Turk smoking opium in Aleppo;\n\nI see the picturesque crowds at the fairs of Khiva, and those of\n\nHerat;\n\nI see Teheran--I see Muscat and Medina, and the intervening sands--I\n\nsee the caravans toiling onward;\n\nI see Egypt and the Egyptians--I see the pyramids and obelisks;\n\nI look on chisel'd histories, songs, philosophies, cut in slabs of\n\nsand-stone, or on granite-blocks;\n\nI see at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mummies, embalm'd, swathed in\n\nlinen cloth, lying there many centuries;\n\nI look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping\n\nneck, the hands folded across the breast.\n\nI see the menials of the earth, laboring;\n\nI see the prisoners in the prisons;\n\nI see the defective human bodies of the earth;\n\nI see the blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunchbacks, lunatics;\n\nI see the pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers, slave-makers of the\n\nearth;\n\nI see the helpless infants, and the helpless old men and women.\n\nI see male and female everywhere;\n\nI see the serene brotherhood of philosophs;\n\nI see the constructiveness of my race;\n\nI see the results of the perseverance and industry of my race;\n\nI see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations--I go among them--I\n\nmix indiscriminately,\n\nAnd I salute all the inhabitants of the earth.\n\nYou, whoever you are!\n\nYou daughter or son of England!\n\nYou of the mighty Slavic tribes and empires! you Russ in Russia!\n\nYou dim-descended, black, divine-soul'd African, large, fine-headed,\n\nnobly-form'd, superbly destin'd, on equal terms with me!\n\nYou Norwegian!

Wallachian! Bulgarian!\n\nYou citizen of Prague! Roman! Neapolitan! Greek!\n\nYou lithe matador in the arena at Seville!\n\nYou mountaineer living lawlessly on the Taurus or Caucasus!\n\nYou Bokh horse-herd, watching your mares and stallions feeding!\n\nYou beautiful-bodied Persian, at full speed in the saddle, shooting\n\narrows to the mark!\n\nYou Chinaman and Chinawoman of China! you Tartar of Tartary!\n\nYou women of the earth subordinated at your tasks!\n\nYou Jew journeying in your old age through every risk, to stand once\n\non Syrian ground!\n\nYou other Jews waiting in all lands for your Messiah!\n\nYou thoughtful Armenian, pondering by some stream of the Euphrates!\n\nyou peering amid the ruins of Nineveh! you ascending Mount\n\nArarat!\n\nYou foot-worn pilgrim welcoming the far-away sparkle of the minarets\n\nof Mecca!\n\nYou sheiks along the stretch from Suez to Bab-el-mandeb, ruling your\n\nfamilies and tribes!\n\nYou olive-grower tending your fruit on fields of Nazareth, Damascus,\n\nor Lake Tiberias!\n\nYou Thibet trader on the wide inland, or bargaining in the shops of\n\nLassa!\n\nYou Japanese man or woman! you liver in Madagascar, Ceylon, Sumatra,\n\nBorneo!\n\nAll you continentals of Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, indifferent\n\nof place!\n\nAll you on the numberless islands of the archipelagoes of the sea!\n\nAnd you of centuries hence, when you listen to me!\n\nAnd you, each and everywhere, whom I specify not, but include just\n\nthe same!\n\nHealth to you! Good will to you all--from me and America sent.\n\nEach of us inevitable;\n\nEach of us limitless--each of us with his or her right upon the\n\nearth;\n\nEach of us allow'd the eternal purports of the earth;\n\nEach of us here as divinely as any is here.\n\nYou Hottentot with clicking palate!
