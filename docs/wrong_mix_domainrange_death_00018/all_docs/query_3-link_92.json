According to the New York Times, the GRAMMY nominated self-conducted orchestra “brims with personality or, better, personalities, many and varied.” A Far Cry was founded in 2007 by a tightly-knit collective of 17 young professional musicians—the Criers—and since the beginning has fostered those personalities, developing an innovative structure of rotating leadership both on stage and behind the scenes. By expanding the boundaries of orchestral repertoire and experimenting with the ways music is prepared, performed, and experienced, A Far Cry has been embraced throughout the world with hundreds of performances coast to coast and across the globe, and hundreds of thousands of online views of live streaming concerts and YouTube archives. Dreams and Prayers and Law of Mosaics, the first albums from A Far Cry's in-house label, Crier Records, have collectively garnered a GRAMMY nomination and critical acclaim from the New Yorker’s Alex Ross. The Criers are proud to call Boston home, and maintain strong roots in the city, rehearsing at their storefront music center in Jamaica Plain and fulfilling the role of Chamber Orchestra in Residence at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Collaborating with local students through an educational partnership with the New England Conservatory, A Far Cry aims to pass on the spirit of collaboratively-empowered music to the next generation.\n\nBaritone David Kravitz has been widely praised for the \"power, character\" and \"resonance and fluency\" of his singing (Boston Globe; Opera News), his \"brilliantly natural\" acting and \"perfect comic timing\" (Boston Globe; St. Louis Post-Dispatch), his \"eloquent\" and \"superb\" diction (Boston Phoenix; Boston Herald), and his \"drop-dead musicianship\" (Boston Globe) on both the operatic and the concert stages. In the 2010–11 season, Mr. Kravitz sings the Businessman in Intermezzo for his debut at New York City Opera, and appears as the United Nations Delegate in the world premiere of Tod Machover’s Death and the Powers at Opéra de Monte-Carlo, with subsequent performances of the work that season at Chicago Opera Theater and in Boston in a production by the American Repertory Theater. He also returns to Opera Boston as the Provost Marshall and Gold Merchant in Hindemith’s rarely performed Cardillac, sings Handel’s Messiah for his debut with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, covers Matthias Goerne in Britten’s War Requiem led by Seiji Ozawa and appears as Nick Shadow in The Rake’s Progress with Emmanuel Music. He closes the season as Taddeo in L’italiana in Algeri with Boston Midsummer Opera.\n\nBaritone Edward Parks is a graduate of the Metropolitan Opera’s Lindemann Young Artists Development Program, and made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the 2009-2010 season as Fiorello in Il barbiere di Siviglia. He since appeared at the MET as Schaunard in La bohème, Larkens in La fancuilla del West and returned this season for La Bohème, Don Carlo, and Die Zauberflöte. He sang Valentin in Faust at the Atlanta Opera; the Count in Le nozze di Figaro at Central City Opera, Zurga in Les pêcheurs de perles at the Michigan Opera Theater, Marcello in La bohème and Sharpless in Madama Butterfly at PORT Opera, Count Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro at the Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Laurent in the Chicago Opera Theater and Long Beach Opera’s co-production of Tobias Picker’s Thérèse Raquin, and Ford in Falstaff and Count Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro with the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra. Concert credits include a recital with Susan Graham for the Marilyn Horne Foundation, Schubert’s Winterreise at both the Schubert Club in St. Paul and in Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall, and Orff’s Carmina Burana with the Prague Proms International Music Festival and the Czech National Symphony Orchestra. Future seasons will see his debut with Virginia Opera and a return to the Metropolitan Opera."
