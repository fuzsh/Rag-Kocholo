Hague's own research. (Don's work, which covers \"Royal & other Navies Day-by-Day in World War 2\" can be viewed at this website, a section of Gordon Smith's site Naval-History.net). The escorts named on this page also came from D. Kindell.\n\nFurther details have been added with the help of:\n\n\"Axis Submarine Successes of WW II\", Jürgen Rohwer\n\n\"Loyd's War Losses\", Vol I.\n\nSee also Convoy KMS 6.\n\nBr=British, Norw=Norwegian, Du=Dutch, Am=American, Pa=Panamanian.\n\n† = dead\n\nCommodore was the captain of Houston City, Vice Commodore the captain of Cliona, Rear Commodore the captain of Benalbanach.\n\n* Note that these 5 ships are not included in MKS 1X from Gibraltar by A. Hague. (They are, however, included in Convoy MKS 1Y below).\n\nClan Mactaggart, on a voyage from Gibraltar for Clyde in ballast, was torpedoed and sunk on Nov. 16 by U-92. She had a crew of 100, 17 gunners and 55 Naval personnel - 2 crew and 1 Naval personnel were killed.\n\nEscorts:\n\nNov. 12: Convolvulus\n\nNov. 12-Nov. 15: Enchantress\n\nNov. 12-Nov. 17: Marigold\n\nNov. 15: Stornoway\n\nNov. 15-Nov. 17: Brixham, Coreopsis, Rothesay\n\nNov. 15-Nov. 23: Bideford, Woodstock, Landguard, Londonderry (S.O.), Louisburg, Lulworth\n\nNov. 16-Nov. 23: Prescott\n\nRelated external link:\n\nThe attack on Clan Mactaggart\n\nA 1 form was received from Robert Martin (source: Public Records Office, Kew), supplemented by information received from Don Kindell, based on A. Hague's own research.\n\nNo ships are listed in the 3rd column in the original A 1 form. However, A. Hague gives the following stations (the remaining ships have been given the same station [by A. Hague] as the A 1 form):\n\nHe lists Algerian in station 63, City of Christchurch in station 51, Fort Chipewyan in station 61, Jean Jadot in station 31, Kaia Knudsen in 32, Ocean Liberty in 53, Ocean Volga in 42, Ocean Wanderer in 62, Oporto in 33, Tiba in 41, and Zebulon B. Vance in station 52.\n\nThis could simply meant that the ships were moved as the voyage progressed.\n\nA. Hague has a note re Dewdale saying \"recalled to Gibraltar\". (She does not show up again until MKS 10 in March).\n\nRelated external links:\n\nSL, HG and MKS and MKF convoys - In Chronological order.
