        "text": "Citation preview\n\nPage 1 →\n\nIntroduction All the arts are capable of duende, but where it finds its greatest range, naturally, is in music, dance, and spoken poetry, for these arts require a living body to interpret them, being forms that are born, die, and open their contours against an exact present. —FEDERICO GARCÍA LORCA To study performance is not to study completed forms…[but to] become aware of performance itself as a contested space, where meanings and desires are generated, occluded, and of course multiply interpreted. —ELIN DIAMOND IN 1882 IN HIS BOOK Specimen Days and Collect, Walt Whitman published a short reiterative prose piece called “Ventures, on an Old Theme.” In it, he makes his case again for an American poetry free of meter and rhyme, insisting, “In these States, beyond all precedent, poetry will have to do with actual facts, with the concrete States, and—for we have not much more than begun—with the definitive getting into shape of the Union.” He calls on a new breed of lofty poet to cement the states together, to divert the danger of crass materialism and instill the virtues of “nationality and patriotism.” Whitman ends by announcing his belief in the reciprocal relationship that must exist between the artist and the public in a democracy, with the epigrammatic assertion, “To have great poets, there must be great audiences, too.”1 That sentence has echoed through the ages, and served as both a foil and a rallying cry for American poets who have sought to understand and articulate the cultural dynamic of popularity. In a 1914 issue of Poetry, the editor, Harriet Monroe, and her foreign correspondent, Ezra Pound, debated the motto taken from Whitman on the cover of the magazine: “To have great poets, there must be great audiences, too.” Pound opened fire first, protesting, “The artist is not dependent upon his audience,” and judging Page 2 → that “this sentence is Whitman tired. You have only to compare Whitman to my mutton-headed ninth cousin, or to any other American of his time who had the ‘great audience,’ to see the difference.” He goes on to compare Whitman unfavorably to Dante, who “never gave way” to a desire to capture a large public, and whose terms for that public—“the rabble”; “the vulgo”—make clear his distaste and distinct sense of superiority: “The artist is not dependent upon the multitude of his listeners. Humanity is the rich effluvium, it is the waste and the manure of the soil, and from it grows the tree of the arts.” Monroe argues conversely that modern democracy demands a different conception of the relationship between the artist and the masses: “Modern inventions, forcing international travel, inter-racial thought, upon the world, have done away with Dante's little audience, with his contempt for the crowd, a contempt which, however, disregarded the fact that his epic, like all the greatest art, was based upon the whole life of his time, the common thought and feeling of all the people. No small group today can suffice for the poet's immediate audience, as such groups did in the stay-at-home aristocratic ages; and the greatest danger which besets modern art is that of slighting the ‘great audience’ whose response alone can give it authority and volume, and of magnifying the importance of a coterie.”2 She finds that there must be an “energy of sympathy” reciprocal to the “energy of creation” to invigorate a democracy, and thereby validate the art of the “poet-prophet.” The Whitman motto continued to appear on the cover of Poetry until 1950 when the editor, Karl Shapiro, removed it at T. S. Eliot's suggestion, much to his later regret.3 Other poets and poetry commentators have wielded Whitman's message to express their views on the popularization of poetry and its effects. The African American poet Sterling Brown in an essay entitled “Our Literary Audience,” published in Opportunity in 1930, had this to say: “‘Without great audiences we cannot have great poets.’ Whitman's trenchant commentary needs stressing today, universally. But particularly do we as a racial group need it.” He makes his case for the vital need of the black artist to write realistically about all of black life, including the most common elements of it, and the consequent need for the black audience to be receptive to representations of the race that are truthful even if they are not “idealistic, optimistic tracts for race advertisement.”4 Brown ends his essay in reaffirmation of Whitman: “Without great audiences we cannot have\n\ngreat literature.” On the other hand, a number of years later, in 1962, the poet Louis Simpson reacted with abhorrence to Whitman's formulation, contending, Page 3 → “This tag from Whitman, which adorns or used to adorn every issue of Poetry, is about as close to the opposite of the truth as you can get. To have great poetry all that is needed is great talent.”5 Simpson's elitist sense is in line with Pound's and Eliot's, and suggests that the cultivation of a public in fact may be an impediment to producing a lasting literature. More recently, an article in Time (December 16, 1991) on the emergent poetry slam scene ran Whitman's sentence as its epigraph, teeing up its discussion of “the new generation of defiantly populist poets” intent on communicating poetry to as large an audience as possible, with the idea being to effect a cultural revolution. In an article in Toronto's National Post (February 28, 2006) Whitman's formulation is once again cited, this time as preface to the announcement of the North American tour of rapper Saul Williams and the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails and the exploration of Williams's decision to expand his reach by performing for the “white kids wearing all black” that largely comprise the audience for Trent Reznor, founder of Nine Inch Nails. As these sitings demonstrate, Whitman's epigram increasingly is deployed in discussions about poetry in performance off the page, framing tensions between page and stage—that is, between textuality and orality—that shape so many of the discussions around poetry performance in the modern period and debates surrounding the merits of publicness. In “The Peril of the Poetry Reading: The Page Versus the Performance” published on the website of the American Academy of Poets, David Groff, who concedes that “public poetry events bring people together, creating a community for the most intimidating of the verbal arts,” expresses reservations about the embodiment of poetry and its public appeal: “But even if the poem takes on a fresh life when it's delivered in the voice of its maker, it loses more than it gains…. Only when we acknowledge that a poem performed is no substitute for a poem read in private will we truly advance the cause of the poetic word.” Many assumptions about poetry and its cultural prestige are packed into that statement, and many of them are contested in this book. Groff goes on to ask the loaded question: “In the effort to make poetry popular, is poetry-making itself debased?” He answers his own question with lament: “There's no chance for the poet or listener's eye to pause, slow down, or linger over a line. How many times have you wanted to ask a poet to decelerate or reread a poem? A recited poem vanishes faster than a vapor trail.” The evanescence of performance is seen here as a failing, with no distinction made Page 4 → between a poem read well and a poem read poorly (who would enjoy the latter?). In his keynote address at the 1996 PEN Literary Awards, Richard Howard sounds the same note as Groff, offering up “a modest proposal that may yet restore an art that was once the glory and the consolation of our race to something like its ulterior status. My proposal is simply this: to make poetry, once again, a secret”: “We have failed…to make poetry known; we have merely made it public. If we are to save poetry, which means if we are to savor it, we must restore poetry to that status of seclusion and even secrecy that characterizes our authentic pleasures and identifies only our intimately valued actions.” On the other side stands future poet laureate Robert Pinsky, who, in reply to Howard, asserts that poetry is “part of our shared communal life, as surely as is the Internet,” and that the participation of poets in the public sphere is “part of the civic life of art, a part of the way society held onto the art of poetry, thereby preserving it for the unborn.”6 In the following pages I explore the civics of American performance poetry and the nexus of its oral and print modalities in the light of shifting political and cultural formations in the nation over the last century and a half. In many ways, my book is as much a study of public performance poetry in the United States as it is a study of the cultures that give rise to it and the performance of cultures and cultural identities within it. For too long we have not paid close enough attention to the meanings that emerge in particular performance contexts; we have not questioned fully enough the situatedness of public performance poetry or sought to understand the ramifications of certain poems as first and foremost to be read aloud, to be staged for a live audience. In an effort to help correct the balance, I analyze a range of materials, many of which have not garnered much in the way of critical attention before, including multiple printed and recorded versions of poems. Keeping in mind the dialectic of performance and text, I seek to show how performance on the page often seeks to authenticate performance off the page, and vice versa. As the anthropologist Dennis Tedlock reminds us, “There is nothing about writing, in and of itself, that requires a text to be fixed for all times and places. Writing, like speaking, is a performance.” That is to say, writing, like speaking, can resist reproduction (“Performance's only life is in the present”) such that even if it is\n\nperformed again, “this repetition itself marks it as ‘different.’”7 Often it is the case with the poets taken up in the following chapters that no single performance in print, just as no single oral Page 5 → performance by them, is definitive. By parsing individual performance styles, I reveal the semantic value of extralexical, or paralinguistic, features, and submit to a rehearing certain poems that we thought we knew well. In addition to these prosodic concerns, I am also interested in how audiences responded to poets in performance both on and off the page, whether live or electronically, and how those responses are shaped by the pressures of American mass culture. The politics surrounding poets’ negotiations of the cultural economy and the rise of new communications technologies within it are crucial to a thorough understanding of how a public performance poetry is sounded and heard in the modern period. Often, these politics inflect the fictions of performance that poets construct in and about their work, in tropes of utterance and audition that often are imbued with national significance. John Miles Foley, refusing the oral/written dichotomy, proposes a four-part taxonomy of oral poetry: material composed and transmitted entirely without writing; works written for oral performance (“voiced texts”); poems transmitted in writing from preliterary times, such as Homeric epic, Beowulf, and Mahabharata; and, finally, poetry like James Macpherson's Ossianic poetry and Elias Lönnrot's Kalevala that is written to be experienced as oral, although read by literate audiences (“written oral poetry”). The poetry I address falls primarily under the categories of “voiced texts” (scripts) and “written oral poetry” (poetry that seeks to encode in it a quality of oralness). In many cases, a poem that is performed aloud subsequently is written down, serving as a kind of transcript, and I examine closely these transpositions as well. It is important to note that Foley does not consider at any length the impact of mediatization on his types of oral poetry. Of course, writing is a medium, and so a performance that exists in printed form is always “mediated,” but when I speak of a “mediatized” performance I mean, as performance theorist Philip Auslander points out (by way of Jean Baudrillard), “to indicate that a particular cultural object is a product of the mass media or media technology,” that is, produced by electric amplification: “‘Mediatized performance’ is performance that is circulated on television, as audio or video recordings, and in other forms in technologies of reproduction.”8 This condition of mediatization affects in essential ways our reception of performance poetry and its cultural work. Related to mediatization is the critical concept of “liveness,” which has been the subject of much lively debate within the field of performance studies of late. In opposition to Peggy Phelan, who finds that one of the Page 6 → defining features of performance is that it stands outside the cultural economy, Auslander (I think correctly) “doubt[s] very strongly that any cultural discourse can actually stand outside the ideologies of capital and reproduction that define a mediatized culture or should be expected to do so, even to assume an oppositional stance.”9 Theirs is a debate over the ontology of performance, with Phelan taking the view that “performance's only life is in the present,” that by its very nature it “cannot be saved, recorded, documented, or otherwise participate in the circulation of representations of representations,” and, on the other hand, Auslander asserting that there exist no significant ontological distinctions between live and mediatized cultural forms, that “in our period of history, and in our Western societies, there is no performance that is not always already a commodity.”10 While Auslander takes aim at those who would valorize live performance over the mediatized, he recognizes that many poets “impute to live performance the social, perhaps even political, function of opposing the oppressive regime of ‘electronic noise’ imposed upon us by the mass media” and celebrate the “ostensible curative powers” of live performance as well as its “putative ability to create community”; as he sees, “Concepts such as these do have value for performers and partisans of live performance. Indeed, it may even be necessary for performers, especially, to believe in them.”11 That observation, along with his comments on authenticity and simulation in a digital age, will figure in my discussion, as I document the evolution of spoken poetry in a modern consumerist America and the politically freighted mythologies that attend it. Federico García Lorca identifies spoken poetry as among those arts that “require a living body to interpret them,” one of the “forms that are born, die, and open their contours against an exact present.” In that exact present, we can speak of “performance” in two ways: bodies bring poems into being—that is, they enact poems—through a dramatic entertainment; and bodies bring subjectivity into being. Lately, in a range of disciplines, a great deal of attention has been paid to the nature of the self and the ways in which identity is constructed in the world. The\n\nsociologist Erving Goffman, for example, shed much needed light on the cultural performance of the self, showing that in everyday life we are always performing roles. Judith Butler similarly contends that identity categories such as gender, race, class, and sexuality are performed rather than essential, that they are socially and culturally constructed and thus are always contested and in flux. She refers to the daily reproduction (or re-citation) of acts and practices Page 7 → that affirm gender and other social norms that we inherit as “the performativity of identity.” Her notion of performativity is based on her reading of philosophers J. L. Austin and Jacques Derrida. Drawing a distinction between performative utterance and constative utterance, Austin contends that the former are not true or false and actually perform the utterance to which they refer; thus, performative utterances perform the action they designate. Derrida finds that identities are reproduced, or “cited,” as repetitions of normative injunctions; these repeated iterations both consolidate the force of identity and, as Butler believes, provide the occasion for its subversion. I will seek to show the ways in which poets acknowledge, either implicitly or explicitly, this truth about identity formation (and deformation) in their performance poetry and poetics. Thus, although Charles Bernstein argues that “the poetry reading enacts the poem not the poet; it materializes the text not the author,” my strong sense is that what is performed at a poetry reading is necessarily both the poet and the poem.12 It is perhaps not surprising, then, that what is at stake in so much public performance poetry is cultural identity itself—markers of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, and nationality. Just as with these categories, which are socially and culturally constructed and which thus evolve continually, the poetry that I examine in this book is also shifting. With respect to the construct of nation, which, as Benedict Anderson observes, is not tangible or palpable—it represents “an imaginary community”—orality offers a means by which to incarnate abstract values and ideals; it helps make “nation” feel real. Otto Bauer relatedly argues that national character is “changeable,” and declares that “ego” is intimately bound up in nation and the idea of nation; as the thinking goes: “If someone slights the nation they slight me too…[F]or the nation is nowhere but in me and my kind.” The egos on display in public performance poetry either go in for this thinking or strenuously resist such chauvinism, sometimes even as they undertake their own alternative nation-building. This study stands at the crossroads of the humanities and social sciences, and the importance of anthropology and sociology not only to the performance of identity but to the textual performance of poetry in the United States cannot be overstated. In recent years, much work has been done in these fields to articulate a set of best practices for dealing with oral performance and its transcriptions. In his essay “Breakthrough into Performance” (1975), the anthropologist Dell Hymes called for a more thorough study of “variation in performance,” citing the “virtual absence of serious Page 8 → stylistic analysis of native American Indian traditions and of individual performers.” In essays in the early 1960s, Hymes laid out an approach that he called “the ethnography of speaking,” which sought to discover the patterns and functions of speaking within specific cultural contexts in terms of setting, participants, ends, act sequence, key (tone), instrumentalities (communication channels), norms of interaction and interpretation, and genre. Through this model, Hymes helped pioneer a linguistic anthropological approach to ethnopoetics, and the various patterns and functions that he identifies will underlie discussion in subsequent chapters. Elizabeth Fine in The Folklore Text (1984) discusses the history of what she calls, via the linguist Roman Jakobson, “the ‘intersemiotic’ translation of performance to print,” and her insights shape my readings. Fine draws on a range of anthropologists and sociolinguists in her theorizing of how to handle the movement of speech into writing, to construct a “performance-centered text,” that is, a transcript of a performance that would convey contextual and stylistic information, in part through typography and layout. Believing that performance is situated behavior, Fine illustrates how one would go about rendering “the oral-physical symbols of artistic verbal performance” through “the two-dimensional, visual symbols of the printed page.”13 Although in this book I am not myself attempting to create performance-centered texts, her examination of the implications of performance theory for re-creating oral poetry in a print medium, and of the scoring methods to do so, bears importantly on the construction of performance-centered texts by American public poets themselves. Of course, performance presumes an activated audience, and performance poetry presents itself as one of the most persistently dialogic of forms, embracing polyvocality and resisting as it does finality and closure, with the work\n\nnot to be identified with any single graphical or performative realization of it. Although Bakhtin stamped poetry as monologic and the novel as dialogic, his poetics of utterance, where the only way to understand the self is in relation to an addressee, very much applies to poetry, and, in particular, to orally performed poetry, where the social and political value of intonation sounds literally. As we will see, Bakhtin's theory of the emancipatory potential of carnival also can help clarify the sometimes subversive enactments of performance poetry in the public sphere. That phrase, the public sphere, also calls for comment. According to the social philosopher Jürgen Habermas, in the eighteenth century the public sphere consisted of organs of information and political debate such as Page 9 → newspapers and journals, as well as institutions of political discussion such as parliaments, political clubs, literary salons, public assemblies, pubs and coffeehouses, meeting halls, and other public spaces where sociopolitical discourse took place. For the first time in history, individuals and groups could shape public opinion, giving direct expression to their needs and interests while influencing political practice. As Habermas's critics have noted, and Habermas since has conceded, the liberal public sphere that he describes was not as diverse or as tolerant as he imagined; thus, working-class, plebeian, and women's public spheres developed alongside the bourgeois public sphere to represent voices and interests excluded in this forum. Sometimes these public spheres overlap; other times, they conflict. One interest of this study is to plot the involvement of public performance poetry in emergent counterpublic spheres. Nancy Fraser defines a counterpublic sphere as a place “where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs.”14 As Gerard Hauser further explains, such a sphere is by definition “a site of resistance,” and “its rhetorical identity is as an arena for hearing proscribed voices, expressing proscribed ideas, and entertaining the alternative reality they advance to the existing order.” Whether the resistance is militant or not, the discourse of a counterpublic sphere “speaks…of an alternative reality to that of the majority culture and their exclusion from its processes of decision making that bear on their lives.”15 Central to this matter of publicness or counterpublicness are the related concepts of aura and artistic reproducibility, with the rise of new technologies and of increasingly media-dominated public spheres impacting in important ways on public poetry and its sitings. Walter Benjamin notes that, at one time, artistic works had an “aura” deriving from their uniqueness, and that the new media shattered this quasi-religious ethos. The reproduction of works of art (by means of photography or radio transmission) means that they are actually designed for reproducibility; in cinema, for instance, we have copies without an original. Benjamin does not mourn the aura destroyed by mechanical reproduction, believing that art is thereby liberated from a “parasitical dependence on ritual” and authenticity, and so can participate in history and politics.16 The quality of duende (emotion, expression, authenticity) prized by most spoken word poets leads some to take a dim view of the mechanics of reproduction; in other instances, though, such technologies are embraced by these poets in an effort to forge Page 10 → community on a grand scale, to catalyze widespread social and political change, typically with the idea that aura, authenticity, and cult value are not routed thereby. Roland Barthes's 1967 pronouncement of the “death of the author” also rings differently in the situation of the artist performing live, a figure who can be seen and heard as not dead, a palpable presence. When this same poet turns to the pen (or keyboard) to craft performance-centered texts, she simultaneously affirms and challenges Barthes's view that “writing is the destruction of every voice,” as she works against writing's lack in an effort to preserve and reproduce the charismatic poetic voice.17 If the presence of the poet in performance does impose some limit on the performed text, since to separate the work from its creator would seem an impossibility, we might argue that it is not always the same voice's body on display, a condition that thereby offers another form of plenitude. Indeed, if we do not identify any one performance of the poem as authoritative, we could say that there as many meanings to the poem as there are performances of it. Thus, we do not need to deconstruct the author, as Barthes would have us do, to appreciate the multiplicities of public performance poetry. It is important to state that in this book my focus is on poets committed to an oral poetics (as opposed to poets who, while they may read their poetry on occasion, are perfectly content on the page) and who are, at the same time, public poets, by which I mean poets interested in reaching and cultivating a mass audience, not an elite coterie. So while it may be true, as a writer in the slam poetry anthology The Spoken Word Revolution (2003)\n\nnotes, that “Robert Frost was probably the twentieth century's greatest U.S. performance poet,” he is not taken up here because, although he is intensely interested in the sounds of poetry (and in “the sound of sense”—or intonation—in poetry) and performed famously on many occasions, including John F. Kennedy's inauguration, he did not compose (and recompose) for performance primarily; his poetry sits comfortably on the printed page.18 At issue in these pages is poetry made with an awareness of a live audience to whom the work could be read aloud, or of a distant reader-audience who would perform it out loud themselves. It also is crucial to note at the outset a few other boundaries of this study. First, in these pages I primarily examine what has been termed “oral poetry,” a form Richard Kostelanetz defines as “syntactically standard language written to be read aloud,” rather than “text-sound art,” or pure sound poetry, which “extends back to primitive chanting” and is not syntactically Page 11 → standard.19 Second, I focus on types of lyric poetry as opposed to verse drama, where performativity is more obviously at issue. Third, my intention throughout is to read American public performance poetry and its rhetoric in the context of a technologically advanced (mass-mediated) society, a condition that Walter Ong refers to as “secondary orality,” which (as opposed to “primary orality,” that is, the orality of preliterate cultures) is “essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print.”20 Therefore, I do not explore aboriginal oral poetry, where understandings and constructions of speech are far different from what they are in a literate society. It is necessary to state, too, that the mantle of “oral poet” has not always been happily worn by some of the artists represented here, despite the fact that these same artists clearly often are writing toward performance off the page. Sonia Sanchez, for one, bristles at being labeled in this way, finding that it is “much easier to relegate our [African American] form to being always oral form,” that a double standard is at play, with a white poet like Allen Ginsberg, who often “chants” his work, not marginalized as “an oral poet” in the same way that she or Amiri Baraka, whom she claims Ginsberg based his delivery style on anyway, would be. Indeed, she has gone so far as to deny being a “performance poet,” a designation that she feels is meant “to limit us [African Americans],” “to keep us out of the arena of being poets.”21 I will carefully weigh the racial implications of these remarks, and my twin focus on the poem in the mouth and in print—and on the interplay between them—is intended not to relegate any of the poets discussed in the pages that follow to an inferior position, but to see them as participating in a major, though often overlooked, tradition—indeed, as squarely at the center of American literature from the 1850s to the present. Bob Holman, whose work I address in my final chapter, refers to the oral poetic tradition as “the Hidden Book,”22 one, that is, that has rarely been read and contains within it a richness worth knowing. It is the purpose of this critical study to recover that Book and attend to its performativities. Tracing a history of performance poetry in the United States from Whitman through the rap-meets-poetry scene, I argue that the country itself and its publics and counterpublics have spoken themselves into being in the act of poetry performance, whether through registers of resonance or dissonance. The title of my first chapter, “Walt Whitman ‘Live,’” intends to position Page 12 → Whitman as modern America's first performance poet. Although he was not a widely or wildly popular poet-performer of his day, as others, like James Whitcomb Riley, were, Whitman was thoroughly committed to the idea of performance and a public poetics of voice, to the aesthetic ideals of improvisation and open-endedness. Others have pointed up the “profound significance of the voice in Whitman's thinking,” but have not viewed that item in light of his poetic revisioning, which I tie to his urge to “liveness.”23 “Voice” in his work has been framed as “a crucial mediating trope,” but it has not been shown yet how in his work voice serves as a metonym for nation, and for Whitman's performance of self and nation.24 Indeed, too often discussions of presence in Whitman studies are separated out from the cultural work that Whitman seeks to perform through his poetry, left unconnected to the political events of his day. As I argue, Whitman's poetry is founded on the masculine politics of the “launch'd voice” as formulated in the nineteenth century in America, and the textual instability of Leaves of Grass stands as a sign of his essential performativity. It is noteworthy that he would appear to be one of the first poets to record his poetry via the phonograph; moreover, his meditations on vocalism in his notebooks significantly shape his concept of a public\n\nperformance poetry. While several critics have noted Whitman's debt to oratorical media, they have not examined in relation to it his typographical inscriptions or his practice of poetic revision. I show how Whitman embodies myriad cultural identities in multiple editions of Leaves and how his performances respond to the nuances of shifting ideologies and express his desire to forge, in the face of great odds, a national polity. Whitman's encounter with emergent sound recording technologies and with the culture of celebrity (and the issues of aura and presence that obtain there) further shape his mythologies of the spoken word and their corresponding notions about America and Americanness. Ambivalent heir to Whitman, Vachel Lindsay cultivated a peculiar performance style that he sought to score in marginal reading directions in the performance-centered texts of The Congo and Other Poems (1915) and later works. In performance, Lindsay put on the forms of “blackness” through a complex affair of mimicry, trying to redeem the figure of the public poet at a time when literary popularity (and mass culture itself) was deemed feminizing. His “higher vaudeville” performance pieces stage related cultural anxieties and encode vocalization in strongly gendered terms. I read his performance of a masculine working-class identity against the performances Page 13 → of other male modernists and of Edna St. Vincent Millay's famous performance of femininity in her popular recitals, and link that performance to his civic ideology. I also examine Lindsay's stage presence with respect to the rise of the radio and other communications technologies saturating middle America, interrogating his advocacy of directness and liveness, of all things unmediatized. In the end, I interrogate Lindsay's disenchantment with the commodification of the spoken word and point up his predicament, the “ordeal” that he endured as a result of his bid for publicity in a fast-industrializing cultural economy. The so-called New Negro poets demonstrate both on and off the page the vexed question of “authenticity” as it relates to vocal reproduction and an emergent racial politics. When James Weldon Johnson published his book of sermonic poetry God's Trombones (1927), a rescue of Reconstruction-era preaching, he chose not to include marginal reading instructions or expressive typography, as Lindsay had done. Johnson's decision not to compose performance-centered texts cuts two ways: first, it suggests his view that only those familiar with the figure of the black preacher will hear the poem properly, that it is a racially closed system; second, it insists that the black poet must refuse dissonant sound effects (dialects) that would fail to uplift the race. In addition to Johnson's sermonic poetry, Zora Neale Hurston's transcriptions of the black preaching voice in Mules and Men (1935) and the white southern writer Dr. Edward Clarkson Leverett (Ned) Adams's in Congaree Sketches (1927) illustrate the racial problematics of rehearing. The chapter goes on to consider the career of Langston Hughes and his effort to perform African American citizenship in his social poetry. I “listen fluently” (Hughes's character Simple's words) to his print and recorded voice in light of the politics of the Left (socialism and black nationalism), and against the grain of the poet Sterling Brown's voice, and end by examining Hughes's remodelings of his own previously published poetry as part of his evolving performance of a black public sphere. In the chapter following, the curtain opens on the landmark reading of six Beat poets at the Six Gallery in San Francisco on October 13, 1955, a siting that represents a new phase in the history of American poetry as performance art, if not a beginning. Drawing on Bakhtin's concept of the “carnivalesque,” I show how the Six Gallery reading, where Allen Ginsberg performed “Howl” for the first time, sought to challenge the dominant culture and its social hierarchies and effect “communitas.” In the process, I explore the ideology of voice that crystallizes during the Cold War, with personal Page 14 → audibility imagined as a potent resistance to U.S. imperialist aggression. In reading Ginsberg's divergent oral performances (and subcultural and mainstream reactions to those performances) as soundings of race and gender, I also find that the content and style of certain poems change in response to shifts in national and Ginsberg's own sexual politics. Anne Waldman, who offers a fiercely gendered reading of ritual vocalization and event in line with contemporaneous feminist performance art, provides a compelling counterpoint. I also investigate the phenomenon of jazz poetry in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with special attention to a section of Ferlinghetti's A Coney Island of the Mind (1958) and its subversive performance of American commodity culture and personal identity within it. With the full flowering of black cultural nationalism in the 1960s, poets began to worry about and insist on the full integration of the black artist in the black community. Amiri Baraka (formerly Leroi Jones) communicates an aggressive subaltern politics in his poetry, and his performance aesthetic underscores the changeableness of\n\ngender, race, and nation. Don L. Lee (later Haki Madhubuti), in step with Baraka, develops a delivery style and scripted vocal presence that are meant to publicize poetry to the black community in a wider way, using rap to dissolve distinctions between high and low culture. Through audiotexts and the soundscapes surrounding their production, I explore as well prominent women poets of the movement, notably Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez, and their chants of a new black womanhood, some of which were performed with gospel choirs and blues bands in an attempt to bring poetry—and the black nationalist message—to an expanded cross-section of African Americans. Throughout the chapter I weigh the politics of amplitude in Black Arts movement poetry and the cultural effects of the mediatization of the grain of the voice. In my final chapter, “Slam Nation,” which re-cites the title of a 1998 documentary film on the slam poetry scene (SlamNation), I respond to one of the most interesting and controversial new poetic forms to erupt onto the U.S. cultural scene in recent years. The poetry performed at the slam has been dismissed by some as nothing more than a sideshow attraction; however, as this cultural form has spread, making poetry more accessible to more people, slammers have continued to theorize their aesthetic in serious terms, and the form has begun to be taken much more seriously. Drawing on statements about the slam by its organizers, poets, and audiences, I trace the American roots of its participatory poetics and show how it seeks to construct what Bakhtin calls a “second culture,” an alternative to the Page 15 → dominant culture from whose values the poets largely dissent. I also demonstrate how a vulgar humor incites a treacherous laughter that temporarily suspends the official hierarchies of the dominant culture in effecting the participants’ own identitarian politics. My chapter ends with an analysis of virtual performances of public poetry, its multimediatic extensions, and on the simulation of liveness in a digital age. The performance theorist Elin Diamond has stated that performance is “a contested space, where meanings and desires are generated, occluded, and of course multiply interpreted.” This definition is consistent with Judith Butler's contention that identity itself is a contested construct. The idea of the performance space as agon stands out, with poets vying in public with themselves, with other poets, with their audiences, and with American culture. Whitman observed that “the place of the orator and his hearers is truly an agonistic arena. There he wrestles and contends with them—he suffers, sweats, undergoes his great toil and extasy. Perhaps it is a greater battle than any fought by contending forces on land and sea.” The person who wins, he observes, is capable of establishing the “mightiest rule.”25 In the chapters to come, we will assess how Whitman and descendant poets amplify this expressed ideology of the spoken word as they map for themselves a quintessentially American history and theory of public poetry.\n\nPage 16 →\n\nCHAPTER 1 Walt Whitman “Live”: Performing the Public Sphere Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive and ever keeps vista. —WHITMAN, FROM “BY BLUE ONTARIO'S SHORE” The want for something finished, completed, and technically beautiful will certainly not be supplied by this writer, as it is by existing esthetic works. —WHITMAN IN CONVERSATION, VIA TRAUBEL WHITMAN IS NOT WELL KNOWN for having recited his poetry out loud to others, and is on record as saying that he was “nothing of a reader,” that, in fact, he preferred not to read his own work and couldn't recite it in any event, since he didn't have it memorized (WWWC, 9:124). Despite such claims, he did perform on numerous occasions, both in private and in public, and attached great significance to those exercises. From his memoranda we know that he was in the habit of reading poetry aloud to himself from his youth, riding omnibuses up and down Broadway “declaiming some stormy passage from Julius Caesar or Richard, (you could roar as loudly as you chose in that heavy, dense, uninterrupted street-bass.)” (PP, 727). To his friend Horace Traubel in 1889 he recalled, “I did my best reading when I was alone that way—off in the woods or on the shore. Long ago, when I was a young man, Coney Island was a favorite spot. At that time Coney Island had not the reputation it has now—it was then a desert island—nobody went there. Oh yes! When I read, it was in solitude, never in frequented places, except perhaps, Broadway, on the stage-coaches, where a little noise more or less made no difference.” Earlier that year, again to Traubel, he recounted of his lyric “A Voice Out of the Sea,” “I always enjoyed saying it—saying it to the winds, the waters, the noisy streets—on Page 17 → stagecoaches. And one has love for the sound of his own voice—somehow it's always magnetic” (WWWC, 5:321, 463). In discussion with Traubel about the practice of reading aloud, Whitman cites Ernest Legouvé's The Art of Reading (translated into English in 1879), a copy of which he owned, explaining that in one of the chapters an actress named Rachel is described as being “aroused when going to her room and reading aloud her plays, whatnot,” in part under the spell of her own voice; he concludes that “there are some who contend that no one can get a full or adequate idea of a poem till it is heard rendered aloud—the human voice to give it its free scope ring! ” and adds, “I don't know but there's a vast deal to be said to that effect” (WWWC, 5:321). Although Whitman does not say so, in this remark he picks up another thread in Legouvé's book, from the chapter “How Reading Reveals,” where that author contends that “even reading aloud is not without its delusions. If it discovers beauties, it detects faults as well…. How many writers and writings that I used to admire passionately, that possibly you admire passionately now, I have found totally unable to stand this terrible test!” Whitman tells Traubel that he always had tried his own poems-in-progress out by reading them aloud to himself “in a palpable voice” and by doing so was able “to get a new angle on them—see things I could not see in any other way” (WWWC, 3:375). In another conversation with his friend he notes, “The great French writer Legouvé says this is the final, the supreme, test, after all else is tried—how will a poem read, recite, deliver: with what effect? How will it hold its own when repeated? That is the court in which it must justify itself.” While he says he would not give such a theory his “radical endorsement,” Whitman regards it as one “not to be rejected scornfully” (WWWC, 4:116). In his early years, Whitman shaped by hand his texts for ultimate portability, creating reading copies that he could take with him on site to declaim. On the cover of a reading copy of Shakespeare's Richard the Second that he made by tearing the leaves of the play out of a complete volume and binding them in wrapping paper, he wrote: “Had it put this shape to take in my pocket to Coney Island on my seashore jaunts—read it & ‘spouted’ it there.”1 Whitman also bundled together late in life a set of poems that he deemed “favorite” pieces for “spouting,” and, pointing to the package of poems sitting on a chair, told Traubel, “I was a great spouter in my early days—even later on—had my favorite pieces—these among them” (WWWC, 5:463). He imagined the same fate for Leaves of Grass, saying Page 18 → on August 21, 1888, “I have long teased my brain with visions of a handsome little book\n\nat last…for the pocket. That would tend to induce people to take me along with them and read me in the open air: I am nearly always successful with the reader in the open air” (WWWC, 2:175). This imagined pocket edition anticipates Gems from Walt Whitman (1889), in whose compilation Whitman assisted, Haldeman-Julius's Little Blue Books, and the beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti's populist City Lights “Pocket Books” series—a series that includes Allen Ginsberg's Howl.2 In a review of the 1855 edition of Leaves that he penned himself, Whitman, speaking of himself in the third person, explains the importance of the spoken word to his art, stating, “In the scheme this man has built for himself the writing of poems is but a proportionate part of the whole. It is plain that public and private performance…have their equal call upon him and receive equal attention.”3 Clearly, Whitman was not content to appear merely as a writer, wanting to make an impression upon us as an oral performer, to simulate a live vocal presence. As he felt, the printed voice does not measure up to the “launch'd” voice and is, in the end, a sign of the artist's failure to prove his publicity, his complexion literally “pallid” from the lack of sunlight that comes of too much privacy: “Poets here [in America], literats here, are to rest on organic different bases from other countries; not a class set apart, circling only in the circle of themselves, modest and pretty, desperately scratching for rhymes, pallid with white paper, shut off, aware of the old pictures and traditions of the race, but unaware of the actual race around them—not breeding in and among each other till they all have the scrofula. Lands of ensemble, bards of ensemble!” (PP, 1357). Indeed, the affective force of Whitman's verse, his desire to reach people directly, led him so far as to assert the importance of understanding his poetry as essentially not “literary,” by which he means not figuratively dense but also not static and self-contained: “No one will get at my verses who insist upon viewing them as a literary performance…or as aiming mainly toward aestheticism” (PP, 671). Whitman tied his rejection of the “literary” to oral performance more conspicuously in 1888, at the same time disavowing the title of “poet” as he made his goal plain: “If they call me no poet then no-poet it may be. I don't care what they call me—by one name or another name—it is all one—so that I produce the result—so that I get my word spoken and heard—maybe move men and women” (WWWC, 2:150). Although certain reviewers of Leaves warned against reading the poems Page 19 → aloud, especially to a mixed audience, many have found his verse ripe for recitation.4 Abraham Lincoln is reported to have read aloud from the book—an “unusual” occurrence apparently, as it is reported that Lincoln rarely vocalized anything in his Springfield law office but newspaper extracts; Leaves, though, we are told, he “read with sympathetic emphasis verse after verse,” hailing them for their “virility, freshness.”5 The former slave Sojourner Truth also was struck by the oracularity of Leaves read aloud, exclaiming, “It was God who wrote it.”6 Henry James, despite writing some unsympathetic reviews of Whitman's work, nonetheless, according to Edith Wharton, was cured of his stammer when reciting Whitman, whose lines poured fluidly from his lips.7 Much later, Doc Searls, senior editor of Linux Journal, a leading technology magazine, reported on his popular blog that Whitman's poetry came alive for him in the voice of The Prairie Home Companion's Garrison Keillor, whom he heard on the radio reciting Whitman: “I was so knocked out by what I heard that I had to pull over and stop the car. Here, I knew, was Truth with a capital T.”8 In light of this sense of the clarifying and transformative power of utterance, Whitman himself is not always sanguine about the communicative capacity of the printed page, despairing at times, as he does in “The Unexpress'd,” that “in poesy's voice or print—[there is] something lacking” (PP, 653). Often ironically he would distance himself from the material conditions of print in his poems, referring to them as obstacles to be surmounted, impediments to his ability to communicate with “power and pathos” (WWWC, 6:365). The 1855 version of “A Song for Occupations” announces his distaste for the printed word, even as he must succumb to it: “I was chilled with the cold types and cylinder and wet paper between us. / I pass so poorly with paper and types…. I must pass with the contact of bodies and souls” (LGV, 1:84n). In “Now Precedent Songs, Farewell” he finds that some of the best of himself is left unremarked on the printed page: “From fibre heart of mine—from throat and tongue—(My life's hot pulsing blood, / The personal urge and form for me—not merely paper, automatic type and ink,) / Each song of mine—each utterance in the past—having its long, long history” (LVG, 3:728). In “Song of the Open Road” he concedes that much simply is “untransmissible by print” and confesses in a hushed tone that “I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes, / We convince by our presence”\n\n(PP, 303). Indeed, Whitman favors terms such as “song,” “chant,” and “utterance” throughout his writings when describing his poetry. Page 20 → Whitman's ambivalence was keen: He knows that he has little choice but to rely on the page to express his message to America, despite the reticence of the page, and so adopts strategies to breach the divide between script and speech. What we have in the case of Leaves is a text that promotes the fiction of its own liveness at every turn: we encounter as readers the presence of a physical speaker where we would expect absence. For Whitman, there was to be no difference between the book of poems and his own body and its voice: “Who touches this [Leaves] touches a man”; “this is no book, but more a man, within whose breast the common heart is throbbing so much. These are no printed leaves, human lips O friend for your sake freely speaking” (PP, 611; NUPM, 4:1467). At the same time, no matter how often or how closely we read the poem on the page, Whitman insists, there are always other possible performances of it, with no two performances identical. Whitman's insertion of bodily self-images in his books speaks to his concern for performance as well as his ambivalence with respect to emergent technologies of reproduction. As we see in various versions of Leaves, beginning with the 1855 edition, photographic portraiture helps him to define his presence to an audience. Peggy Phelan has remarked that “all portrait photography is fundamentally performative,” as it “tries to make an inner form, a (negative) shadow, expressive: a developed image which renders the corporeal, a body-real, as a real body. Uncertain about what this body looks like or how substantial it is, we perform an image of it by imitating what we think we look like. We imagine what people might see when they look at us, and then we try to perform (and conform to) those images.”9 Whitman tried to live up to certain photographic images of himself and worked to deny the validity of others: as a photographic subject, he was the consummate performer. Ed Folsom has shown how photographic images of Whitman in his books point to his desire to construct “an illusion of presence,” and yet to expose at the same time the “constructedness” of identity, as in the 1855 frontispiece engraving: “Instead of seeking an engraving that pretended to be a copy of a daguerreotype, he had Samuel Hollyer…engrave Gabriel Harrison's daguerreotype in a way that did not attempt to disguise but rather emphasized the artificial and constructed nature of the steel-cut image.” Photographs had to be engraved in books for most of Whitman's life, and Whitman reprinted the 1855 engraving in the 1856, 1876, 1881–82, 1884, 1888, 1889, and 1892 printings of Leaves. Once it became possible to Page 21 → reproduce photos in books, Whitman continued to highlight the contingency of identity, staging “a retreat from advancing technologies” with the woodcut portrait by William J. Linton in his 1876 issue of Leaves. As Folsom observes: “Whitman's retrogression from steel engraving to woodcut, then, serves to intensify the sense of artifice and to indicate ways that inked words and inked portraits could mutually support each other as they advertised themselves as artists’ constructions of identity.”10 As he was doing this, Whitman also was tipping into his books portraits of himself. In 1876 he included an actual photo in Leaves, and in his 1882–83 Specimen Days and then in 1888 he used one of the new halftone processes of photo reproduction that allowed the mass printings of photographs on specially treated paper. On the one hand, Whitman handled each book himself, and so in that sense did not yield completely to the economy of mass production; on the other hand, he tried to reach as many people as he could, lamenting at the end of his career that he and his poetry had not been “absorbed” as fully as he had hoped they would be early on. Beginning with the 1876 edition of Leaves, Whitman is one of the first poets to include a facsimile of his signature in his books. While the reproduction of a signature served as an act of authentication of personhood for someone like Frederick Douglass, it served as an act of authentication of personality for Whitman, since what was at stake for Whitman was not his credibility as a writer (as it was for Douglass), but rather his credibility as an affective writer. As Whitman put it tenderly in an 1888 note in Leaves: “I have wanted to leave something markedly personal. I have put my name with pen-and-ink with my own hand in the present volume. And from engraved or photo'd portraits taken from life, I have selected some, of different stages, which please me best, (or at any rate that displease me least,) and bequeath them at a venture to you, reader, with my love” (PP, 1365). He designates the 1888 Complete Poems and Prose an “authenticated and personal book,” one that has been touched and signed by the poet himself.\n\nThe illusion of the book as unmediated object stands as proof of Whitman's concern for cultivating an intimate relationship with his audience, for dissolving distance and coming into direct personal contact. As I argue, Whitman is the first American poet in a condition of “secondary orality” to prize liveness and to theorize and authorize a public poetry based on the phenomenology of liveness. Coming of age with the phonograph and other sound-recording technologies, Whitman wanted his poems to be “felt, like the magnetism of a presence,” but sometimes Page 22 → worried about the vulnerability of the printed word to inauthenticity and manipulation in a mass-mediated society.11 In his performances on the page, through successive editions of Leaves, he foregrounds the communicative media of writing and voice, aligning and realigning his Americanism in provocative ways as he goes. I aim to show that Whitman's poetic texts—texts that exist in a state of change—intend to establish the poet's publicness through the performance of gender, political authority, and social relations for a nation in crisis.\n\n“POWER AND PATHOS”: AUDIBILIZING MASCULINE SENTIMENT Whitman's desire to declaim in public was not unique; it was informed by a culture caught up in the enthusiasms of the spoken word. Whitman's contemporary, Mark Twain, wrote from Philadelphia that he had taken part in “what is called a free-and-easy,” an event that occurs “at the saloons on Saturday night, at which a chairman is appointed, who calls on any of the assembled company for a song or recitation, and as there are plenty of singers and spouters, one may laugh himself to fits at very small expense.”12 The saloon was established by midcentury as the social center for workers and the single men of boardinghouses, and the entertainment that it offered enacted the camaraderie that built group identity. The “free-and-easy” exemplifies the performative culture in which Whitman partook. While there is no evidence that Whitman performed at a free-and-easy, Justin Kaplan reports that “At Pfaff's [a beer cellar on Broadway] during the first September of the war Walt read aloud from the manuscript of a new poem (“Beat! Beat! Drums!”) that was about to be published, almost simultaneously, in the Boston Evening Transcript, the New York Leader, and Harper's Weekly” (263). After the war, Whitman remembered fondly the close association he had had with the young men at Pfaff's, remarking, “We all loved each other more than we supposed.” Although in retrospect he claimed that “my own great pleasure at Pfaff's was to look on—to see, talk little, absorb,” his performance as both auditor and orator there predicts his desire to construct and participate in a larger fraternal public sphere on the Pfaff's model (WWWC, 1:417).13 During the Civil War, Whitman performed in the intimacy of hospital wards, making a record of his recitals in his diary: “October 1st, 1863. Among other things in my visits to hospitals, I commence reading pieces” Page 23 → (NUPM, 2:537). Ten days later he wrote to Abby Price: “Then I read to the boys—the whole ward that can walk gathers round me & listens.”14 In Specimen Days he recalls, “In camp and everywhere, I was in the habit of reading or giving recitations to the men. They were very fond of it, and liked declamatory poetical pieces. We would gather in a large group by ourselves, after supper, and spend the time in such readings” (PP, 767). In this setting, he found another way to connect with men in sympathetic terms. For the first time in the 1871 version of “As I Sat Alone by Blue Ontario's Shore” Whitman tells of his ministrations in the camps and the power of “personal presence,” or what he calls “magnetism,” in an entry in Specimen Days: “Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd to breathe his last, / This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored, / To life recalling many a prostrate form” (PP, 751; LGV, 1:205). In these lines we not only hear, but hear about, the salvific “voice,” an appendage every bit as tangible as arm or hand, with the ability to resurrect dead soldiers. Whitman kept up this practice of reading to small groups, though in a far different context, once the war was over. Herbert Gilchrist documented Whitman's visits to Gilchrist's mother's house in Philadelphia in 1876–77, on one occasion noting, “In the evening Sunday he recited Tennyson's Ulysses grandly, and at my request the Mystic Trumpeter [one of Whitman's poems]. He said it exercised his lungs, the animal part—but that he did mostly this, and seldom entered into the spiritual part.”15 Whitman's friend, Maurice Bucke, reported that he had heard Whitman read “Mystic Trumpeter” “in a manner which singularly combined strong emphasis with the very realization of self-composure, simplicity and ease,” further noting, His voice is firm, magnetic, and with a certain peculiar quality we heard an admiring auditor call\n\nunaffectedness. Its range is baritone, merging into bass. He reads very leisurely, makes frequent pauses or gaps, enunciates with distinctness, and uses few gestures, but those very significant. Is he eloquent and dramatic? No, not in the conventional sense, as illustrated by the best known stars of the pulpit, court-room, or the stage—for the bent of his reading, in fact the whole idea of it, is evidently to first form an enormous mental fund, as it were, within the regions of the chest, and heart, and lungs—a sort of interior battery—out of which, charged to the full with such emotional impetus only, and without ranting or any of the usual accessories or clap-trap of the actor or singer, he launches what he has to say, free of noise or strain, yet with a power that makes one almost tremble.16\n\nPage 24 → The poetics of naturalness that Bucke posits here—one that is without affectation but powerfully affective, demonstrating a “sincerity of voice and manner”—is a sign of the times, as Whitman proposes to bring oratory in line with intimate conversation (the poet not “ranting,” but “leisurely” speaking), to insist on the centrality of passionate speech as embodied in delivery to the project of persuasion and the communication of moral truths.17 As Whitman's fame grew, he was invited to perform his poetry at official celebrations and commemorations. He “spouted” his poem “After All Not to Create Only” (later titled “Song of the Exposition”) at the American Institute Exhibition in New York City in 1871 for $100; the published text of that poem states that Whitman recited it to “2–3,000 people and 5–600 hushed workmen,” and the preamble suggests another instance of Whitman's magnificent ability to puff himself: His manner was at first sight coldly quiet, but you soon felt a magnetism and felt stirred. His great figure was clothed in gray, with white vest, no necktie, and his beard was unshorn as ever. His voice is magnificent, and is to be mentioned with Nature's oceans and the music of forests and hills. His gestures are few, but significant. Sometimes he stands with his hands in his breast pockets; once or twice he walked a few steps to and fro. Just as Whitman imagined his unrhymed and unmetered verse to be as “liquid, billowy waves,” so his auditors in this instance sensed (or were imagined to have sensed) in his vocalism a poet without affectation or a stultifying formality (WWWC, 1:414). In that performance, we are told he was “perfectly self-possessed,” and his overall delivery (“A few allusions of his poem were in a playful tone, but the main impression of markedly serious, animated, and earnest”) met with hearty approval. Later in life, Whitman did make a name for himself as an orator, in particular through his Lincoln lecture, which was delivered nineteen times in eleven years and concluded with a recital of his popular elegy “O Captain! My Captain!” The speaking bureau manager James Pond records in Eccentricities of Genius (1900) that Whitman “gave a few readings under my management during his life,” with one bringing in $1,800 in receipts; of another event, at Madison Square Theatre on the anniversary of Lincoln's birthday, Pond notes, “Just as he [Whitman] was about to recite ‘My Captain,’ a little girl, the granddaughter of [the poet] Edmund Clarence Stedman, Page 25 → walked out upon the stage and presented him with a beautiful bouquet.”18 Traubel described his reading of the poem at the conclusion of his final lecture as done “with greatest effect—power and pathos,” no doubt restrained in gesture as was the lecture, which was billed in 1887 as itself a “prose poem.”19 Through his performance of his elegy for the slain president, he was in effect performing patriotism. In the 1880s, when Whitman gave public lectures and readings, he was asked to recite the poem so often that he exclaimed (in 1888), “Damn My Captain…. I'm almost sorry I ever wrote the poem,” though, he admitted, it had “certain emotional immediate reasons for being” (WWWC, 2:304). This frustration of the public poet in the face of repeated requests to recite a standard is a thread that we will find running throughout the history of modern American poetry performance. Published to immediate acclaim in the New York Saturday Press, “O Captain! My Captain!” was widely anthologized during Whitman's lifetime. The poet was distressed, though, to find the punctuation of “O Captain! My Captain!” deranged in the initial printing. On page proofs for a second publication, Whitman crossed out the\n\nexclamation point at the end of the first line, replacing it with a semicolon; other punctuation marks at line ends also are emended. The editors apparently had erred by picking up earlier versions (what Whitman calls “bad perversions”) of punctuation and whole lines that had appeared in the poem prior to Whitman's 1871 revision of it. (Whitman revised the poem in 1866 and again in 1871.)20 His revisions suggest the care with which Whitman composed paralinguistic features on the page, trying to enforce particular vocal effects in order to carry through the urgencies of the personality behind the scripted word. In “A Font of Type” Whitman refers to the printer's arsenal as “This latent mine—these unlaunch'd voices—passionate powers, / Wrath, argument, or praise, or comic leer, or prayer devout.” When he states parenthetically, “(Not nonpareil, brevier, bourgeois, long primer merely),” he means that these points of type (listed in ascending order of size: six-, eight-, nine-, and ten-point) are to be regarded as more than inert characters, “pallid slivers” though they may be; they are expressive of character, and must be enlisted by the page-bound poet as part of a carefully orchestrated system of vocal notation (PP, 614). As late as 1879, Whitman still was projecting into the future an image of himself on the stump: “I intend to go up and down the land (in moderation) seeking whom I may devour, with lectures, and reading of my own poems” (PP, 1301). The parenthetical qualifier “in moderation” suggests Page 26 → Whitman's understanding of the nervous exhaustion that such vocal expenditure could cause. The American neurologist George M. Beard noted in 1881 that “American oratory is partly the product of American nervousness. For success in the loftier phases of oratory, fineness of organization, a touch of the nervous diathesis are essential”; he concluded that “this delicacy of organization, united with Saxon force, makes America a nation of orators.”21 Beard makes plain, then, that if American oratory relies on a certain fineness of temper, it also relies on a racial robustness. Whitman's use of the verb “devour” suggests his vision of oratory as a consuming of the audience, as the incorporation of many into one: “Notwithstanding the diversity of minds in such a multitude, by the lightning of eloquence, they are melted into one mass, the whole assembly actuated into one and the same way, become as it were but one man, and have but one voice” (NUPM, 6:2239). The political dream of the masses congealed into a single voice, a single nation, lies at the heart of his republican performance aesthetic. Indeed, the conjunction of oral performance and nationhood hearkens back to the textual foundation of the American republic itself, as do fictions of oral performance, with utterance standing as a figure for the making of the United States, a political entity that is imagined as “spoken into being.”22 Jay Fliegelman notes the ambivalence at the heart of understandings of orality in the eighteenth century: “In one view orality was ‘an inner voice of emotion’ and an expression of subjectivity. In another it was ‘public-oriented oratorical communication,’ a mode of expression in which national values and a common sensibility were to be articulated and reinforced or (if romanticized as preliterate) recovered.” He also has shown that the Declaration of Independence is a document made to be “heard as performance” rather than “read silently,” coming as it does with recital directions: “The locations of the marks on the rough draft of the Declaration as well as the locations of the ‘quotation marks’ on the proof copy of the Dunlap broadside represent not breath or punctuational pauses but precisely what Jefferson discusses: rhythmical pauses of emphatical stress that divide the piece into units comparable to musical bars or poetic lines.” With the text operating as score, telling the reader how to position the voice at any given moment, he finds that, “rather than merely standing in opposition to print, orality can also be, and in the eighteenth century often was, a defining characteristic of print, a set of cues within a text that signal it is to be heard by the ear (as performance) as much as it is to be read by the eye.” Such recital cues are designed to compensate for “the anonymity (the absence Page 27 → of a physical speaker) of written prose, and for whatever ambiguity was occasioned by that anonymity.”23 In early editions of Leaves Whitman, in an effort to get his word heard, employs dots to separate words and phrases to instruct the reader in how to hear the work and how to perform it when reading it aloud.24 These dots are not unlike those throughout the Declaration of Independence that attempt to instruct the voice in how to posture in a public reading of it. Of the Declaration of Independence and its vocal markers, Fliegelman finds that such inscriptions of the body on the page “serve as print culture's compensation for the loss of an expressive oral mode, a compensation for the inadequacy of print culture to rise to the challenge of demonstrating rather than merely representing the affective.” He further notes that the oral readings of the Declaration that Jefferson's markings overtly contemplated made it “an event rather than a document. They [i.e., the readings] gave it a voice,\n\nwhich…was experienced emotionally and responded to vocally. Read out loud, the document that denounced a false community would galvanize the bond of a true one.”25 The Irish stage actor Thomas Sheridan's prosodic criticism Lectures on the Art of Reading (the second part, The Art of Reading Verse, first published in 1775), where he advocates the elocutionary use of a natural language of the heart, influenced Jefferson's notation of the Declaration of Independence as well as Whitman's idea of oratory and his scoring of the voice in the poem on the page, a scoring that similarly constructs vocalization as performing political power. (That these dot-devices, a common feature of the 1855 edition of Leaves, substantially recede after that initial publication—many of them replaced by a dash—I will take up later on.) Whitman believed that it was through the thrilling directness of “live” performance—as opposed to some secondhand notation or recording of it—that a democratic society best could be substantiated. In his notebook entry of April 24, 1857, Whitman idealistically foresees himself on the national stage, “on occasion, at Washington to be, launching from public room, at the opening of the session of Congress—perhaps launching at the President, leading persons, Congressmen, or Judges of the Supreme Court,” with the ambition “always to hold the ear of the people” (NUPM, 1:1554). Early in his career, when he saw himself on the lecture circuit, he imagined holding forth in the seats of political power across the country, harboring “the idea of strong live addresses directly to the people, adm. 10c., North and South, East and West—at Washington,—at the different State Capitols—Jefferson Page 28 → (Mo.)—Richmond (Va.)—Albany—Washington &c—promulging the grand ideas of American ensemble liberty, concentrativeness, individuality, spirituality &c &c” (NUPM, 6:2234). Whitman further observed that “although the Lectures may be printed and sold at the end of every performance, nothing can make up for that irresistible attraction and robust living treat of the vocalization of the lecture, by me, —which must defy all competition with the printed and read repetition of the Lectures” (NUPM, 2:407). Making a distinction between the live oration and a reproductive representation of it, Whitman insists on the superiority of the former. Whitman was an insatiable consumer of live performance, including public declamation, theater, and opera. Peggy Phelan's notion that performance's only continued existence is in the spectator's memory coincides with Whitman's, although Whitman is dismayed by the fact that a performance is undocumentable, whereas Phelan valorizes the live event that she believes stands outside of the economy of reproduction and therefore possesses an “oppositional edge.”26 In sympathy with a Bowery reviewer's feeling of “regret that a great art should in its nature be transitory,” Whitman laments, “Well, this great thing [the live performance] has been, and all that is now left of it is the feeble print upon my brain, the little thrill which memory will send along my nerves, mine and my neighbors, as we live longer the print and thrill must be feebler, and when we pass away the impress of the great artist will vanish from the world” (PP, 1210). Although Philip Auslander contends that the concept of “liveness” is not applicable to performance until the 1930s, after sound recording and motion pictures reach maturity, believing that writing is “not…a form of recording in this context,” Whitman understood it as such (even if it was to his mind a pale recording) and, moreover, set out to prove that writing itself, like speaking, can be a performance; indeed, Phelan finds that the challenge for writing “is to re-mark again the performative possibilities of writing itself,” and advocates “the act of writing toward disappearance, rather than the act of writing toward preservation.”27 Whitman's fond recollection of the 1830s Bowery Theatre, his celebration of the b'hoy subculture, points to his fascination not only with participatory live performance but with the theater of masculinity as well: “Pack'd from ceiling to pit with its audience mainly of alert, well dress'd, full blooded young and middle-aged men, the best average of American-born mechanics…the whole crowded auditorium, and what seeth'd in it, and flush'd from its faces and eyes, to me as much a part of the show as Page 29 → any—bursting forth in one of those long-kept-up tempests of hand-clapping peculiar to the Bowery—no dainty kid-glove business, but electric force and muscle from perhaps 2000 full-sinew'd men.”28 These working-class men enact their manhood as they become “a part of the show,” performing a cultural identity as the actors perform a character on stage. After hearing and seeing Emerson perform live in 1847, Whitman wrote enthusiastically in the Brooklyn Eagle about that event as well, sharing with Emerson a gendered vision of the forceful spoken word, which, both men believed, stood as a sign of masculine sexual and cultural potency. As David Porter says of Emerson, “To his\n\nmind the thundering affectiveness of the poet was a manly virtue to be preferred to the character of Bryant's poems, Greenough's sculpture, and Dr. Channing's preaching. Of these he said: ‘They are all feminine or receptive and not masculine or creative.’”29 Dismissing Dr. Channing, Emerson found himself instead “intoxicated by the ravishing pulpit eloquence of Edward Everett,” noting “how joyfully & manly he spreads himself abroad.”30 In his essay “Genius” Emerson states: “I know no more striking instance of the representative character of genius than we have in the rare fact of genuine eloquence. The orator masters us by being our tongue. By simply saying what we would but cannot say, he tyrannises over our wills and affections.” As Emerson imagines, the orator even has the awesome power to bridge racial, class, and religious divides, noting of Father Taylor's effect that “the whole various extremes of our little village society were for once brought together. Black & white, poet & grocer, contractor & lumberman, methodist & preacher joined with the regular congregation in rare union.”31 Whitman also was a fan of Father Taylor and was drawn to his communitarian ideal, which, he realized, hinged on a poetics of liveness: “The mere words, (which usually play such a big part) seem'd altogether to disappear, and the live feeling advanced upon you and seiz'd you with a power before unknown” (PP, 1144). Also, with Emerson Whitman claimed of the Italian tenor Bettini: “None have thoroughly satisfied me, overwhelmed me, but this man. Never before did I realize what an indescribable volume of delight the recesses of the soul can bear from the sound of the honied perfection of the human voice. The manly voice it must be, too,” for the woman's by comparison is “but as the pleasant moonlight.”32 The “perfect physique” required for oratorical performance is that of a man, too, a “representative man, with perfect power,” Whitman remarks, drawing on Emerson's figure of the “representative man” who is both of his age and Page 30 → transcends it (NUPM, 6:2234). He also praises the orator Henry Ward Beecher, noting that it is “refreshing that his bold masculine discourses were without that prettiness and correctness of style that, say what we will, is very often accompanied by emptiness and something very akin to effeminacy.”33 In the 1856 version of his poem “Song of the Broad-Axe,” this social construction of the spoken word shows again in his salute to “the brawniest breed of orators and bards,” robust men endowed with the gift of prophetic speech (LGV, 1:181). In the poem finally titled “By Blue Ontario's Shore,” the bard is more deeply sexualized, charged (in the 1856 and 1860 versions) with “Plunging his seminal muscle into its [the nation's] merits and demerits, / Making its geography, cities, beginnings, events, glories, defections, diversities, vocal in him” (LGV, 1:194). Each of these instances speaks to how Whitman imagines the performance of America as bound up in the performance of masculinity—a masculinity that takes the athletic and affective as indicators of nationality and patriotism.\n\nREVISIONING AMERICA: THE PERFORMATIVE POLITICS OF PRINT Whitman described Leaves as “an attempt” “from first to last, to put a Person, a human being (myself in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century, in America) freely, fully and truly on record” (PP, 671). His sense of himself as the embodiment of a particular time and place suggests that Leaves is in fact more than just a performance of a discrete identity; it is, as well, a performance of America in the period in which he lives. At the end of his career, he puts forth some “Last Saved Items,” one of which is the statement, “Essentially my own printed records, all my volumes, are doubtless but offhand utterances f'm Personality, spontaneous”; he goes on to reiterate that his goal all along has been “to see how a Person of America, the last half of the nineteenth century, w'd appear, put quite freely and fairly in honest type” (PP, 1325). This last dispatch expresses his interest in the performance semiotic of speech and text, his feeling for the way that the oral and literate coexist and interact; it also attests to his belief that the truth-bearing quality of the printed word is rooted in oral “spontaneous” speech. The provisionality that we find hovering over the poems of Leaves directly responds to and in the end stands as a figure for the performative cultural politics in the United States in the mid-nineteenth century: “My Book and Page 31 → I—what a period we have presumed to span! those thirty from 1850 to ’80—and America in them!” (PP, 660). Whitman wanted his poetry to serve as a living document of these years, a text like the Constitution that is adaptive to changing times. In his effort “to give the personality of Walt Whitman” in Leaves, then, he enacts his cultural moment—or rather, a series of cultural moments of which he is a part—even as he complicates the notion of a fixed, unitary selfhood. Some have claimed that when Whitman began to revise his work, he betrayed his early desire to produce a natural spontaneous language and with it a poetics of liveness. Mark Bauerlein marks the end of Whitman's “experimental\n\npoetics” at the moment in the 1860 edition when “upon rereading his earlier poems and finding them inadequate to his present condition, [he] revises and reorganizes them for further publication. In his attempt to improve and update his book, Whitman violates the supposedly universal, irrefutable, and immutable language of his heart, and commits the pure emotive idiom to calculated editorial amendation.” But does the subsequent revising of already published poems necessarily violate their “pure emotive idiom,” what Bauerlein also refers to as a “poetics of presence-feeling”?34 Doesn't remaining true to the emotion of the moment call for improvisation, “spontaneous” response? Bauerlein seems to be troubled by the destruction of the original writing's “aura”; however, for Whitman, the sense of an original is due much less reverence, and textual emendations made easy in an age of mechanical reproduction are offset by his design of his own books, which allowed him to retain the originality of his own hand, to facilitate the presence of the aura in the mechanically reproducible work of art. The question of authenticity is a crucial one in and for Whitman's poetry, hanging heavily over his many textual inscriptions as it does still over his purported mediatized voice—the wax cylinder recording of his poem “America” that may or may not (depending on whether the reader is in fact Whitman) preserve his presence in perpetuity. Critics have debated which edition of Leaves is the most “authentic,” the truest to Whitman's prime intention and vision, and Whitman himself threw his weight behind the third edition (1860) at the time of its publication, going so far as to say that the two preceding editions were prototypes only, that Leaves had not really ever even been published before.35 Later in life he changed his tune, allowing that he valued highly all of the iterations of his book, and so refusing Page 32 → to allow any one edition to override another; as he told his friend Horace Traubel, “They all count—I like all—I don't know that I like one better than any other” (WWWC, 1:280). It is important to see, as Whitman himself did, that each of the editions enacts a unique self and cultural moment, that in the end what we have is (to borrow Judith Butler's phrase) “a string of performances that constitute and contest the coherence of that ‘I,’” in Whitman's case an “I” famously positioned as the first word of the first poem of the first edition of Leaves.36 One question that Whitman's successive editions and various performances of himself raises is whether there is indeed such a thing as an original, true, and authentic self, or whether, rather, identity is contingent, approximate, always a copy of a copy, a semblance of a self. It is my view that Whitman's provisoriness seeks to make accommodation with mass production (without violating its claim on performance) through an open-endedness that both betrays the notion of the autotelic text and flows from his understanding of the performative nature of selfhood. If Whitman believed that each photographic portrait of him was a singular take—“one of many, only—not many in one,” as he doubted the ability of the single static portrait to capture the plurality of his selves, he read “These United States” obversely, according to the motto e pluribus unum (out of many, one), imagining himself as a “joiner” of states into the body of a holistic nation (WWWC, 3:72). His public poetry registers his understanding and close monitoring of politics, in particular tensions around the contingent issues of sectionalism and slavery, as the construct of “voice” becomes a metonym for Whitman's performance of self and nation. Moreover, his view that his poems “grow of circumstances, and are evolutionary” matches his sense of the United States as in a perpetual state of becoming (“Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive and ever keeps vista”): his improvisations seek to shape public opinion, to assert his own relevance and the abiding soundness of his Americanism. Particularly interesting is Whitman's work while the second edition of Leaves was going through the press in 1856, a year of radical political change in the United States. The election of 1856 intensified the conflict between North and South, as the major parties split along sectional lines: the Democratic party won the election by carrying a majority of slave states; the Republican party carried no slave states and all but five of the free states. This increasing sectionalism directly informs Whitman's revisions, as he struggles to heal the nation, to “fuse” it before it comes unglued. One Page 33 → prime field for Whitman's retrofitting is “Song of Myself,” originally untitled when it appeared in the 1855 Leaves, but assigned the title “Poem of Walt Whitman, an American” in the 1856 edition. Proclaiming not only his name but his national affiliation, Whitman seeks to defuse intensifying sectional antagonisms spurred on by violence in Kansas over the question of slavery, to remind his audience of their shared national identity. He refers to himself as “Walt Whitman, an American” in the first two editions (1855\n\nand 1856), changing that designation later, in less nativist times, to “Walt Whitman,…of mighty Manhattan” (1867–71) and “Walt Whitman,…of Manhattan the son” (1881); as Reynolds reasons, the Know-Nothings peaked in popularity in June 1855, a fact that helps explain Whitman's strident nationalism in poems of that period, although, Reynolds adds, Whitman was a nativist with a difference (that is, he did not consistently adhere to the antiforeign and anti-Catholic bias of the Know-Nothings).37 Whitman's Americanism is also a response to mounting sectionalism in the country: Whitman wants to identify himself as an “American” perhaps not primarily to repudiate the Other, but to insist on that identity in the face of forces bent on disunion. Indeed, it is the first three editions of Leaves (1855–60) that include the tag “Walt Whitman, an American,” as Whitman's nationalism continues to inflect the poem past nativism's peak, in the run-up to war. In 1856 Whitman began the practice of dating his poems in relation to the birth of the nation (1776, or rather “The Year I of These States”), and the thirty-two poems within the 1856 edition of Leaves are meant to stand for the thirty-two states of the Union (“There are Thirty-Two States sketched—the population thirty millions”) (LGV, 1:177; PP, 1333). (At the time, there were only thirty-one states, but Whitman anticipates the entry of Kansas.)38 The poem “Resurgemus” (so-called when first published in Horace Greeley's Tribune in 1850) became “Poem of The Dead Young Men of Europe, the 72d and 73d Years of These States” in 1856. The title of his poem on the 1854 trial of the returned fugitive slave Anthony Burns appears as “Poem of Apparitions in Boston, the 78th Year of These States” in 1856 and 1860 (changed to “A Boston Ballad. / (1854)” in 1871). Likewise, in “Lesson Poem” (later titled “Who Learns My Lesson Complete?”), Whitman alters the 1855 designation that he was “born on the last day of May 1819” the next year to read that he was “born on the last day of May in the Year 43 of America.” In the same poem, the statement, “I have become a man thirty-six years old in 1855,” turns into “I have become a man thirty-six years old in the Year 79 of America” Page 34 → in 1856. These renditions constitute Whitman's desire to preserve the union by reminding his readers of the genius of the constitutional framework, which affiliates “These States” and yet allows for their separateness, “a simple elastic scheme” (PP, 472). Issuing and reissuing his own age in relation to the birth of the country signifies the extent to which he sees himself as synecdoche for the nation (“These States, what are they except myself?”) (PP, 482). That in “Lesson Poem” Whitman's reports of his age disappear after the Civil War signifies the abatement of his need to promote himself so aggressively as “a Person of America” once the union has been secured and some sense of a collective national identity is congealing. Another hallmark of the 1856 and 1860 Leaves is the extent to which the poems harp on regional diversity and sectional particularity within the expanding nation in an effort to demonstrate to states that their rights are respected under federalism. In 1856 Whitman produced a new poem called “Poem of Many in One” in which he seeks to negotiate the vexed question of the political relation of the states. Rather than foreground the poem as a romantic reverie (as he does in 1867 and 1871 with the revised title “As I Sat Alone by Blue Ontario's Shore”), Whitman in 1856 alludes to the U.S. motto e pluribus unum as an antidote to a mounting sectionalism, reminding his audience that America will retain its pluralism and states their due authority under the umbrella of union. In line with this view, Whitman issues in the poem a catalog of coastal states—a list dropped in all later variants of the poem—to remind Americans of the topographical variety of the country and the poet's job to take a full accounting of it: “The blue breadth over the sea off Massachusetts and Maine, or over the Virginia and Maryland sea, or over inland Champlain, Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, Superior, or over the Texan, Mexican, Cuban, Floridian seas, or over the seas off California and Oregon, not tallying the breadth of the waters below, more than the breadth of above and below is tallied in him” (LGV, 1:194). In 1856 and 1860 only, he also includes in the poem the following citation of North American regional plenitude: “Its ample geography, the sierras, the prairies, Mississippi, Huron, Colorado, Boston, Toronto, Raleigh, Nashville, Havana, are you and me” (LGV, 1:207). Likewise, in “Song of Myself” geographical diversity is not articulated with the same vigor after 1860, with the line “We walk the roads of Ohio and Massachusetts and Virginia and Wisconsin and New York and New Orleans and Texas and Montreal and San Francisco and Charleston and Savannah and Mexico” cut in all future variants (LGV, 1:60). Page 35 → Other poems that Whitman revises as part of his performative poetics are about the issue of slavery and its cultural\n\neffects, and bespeak an evolving racial politics. Most strikingly, a passage in which a slave vents his fury at his condition is excised from it, but not until the 1881–82 edition of Leaves; the 1855 version of the passage (largely unchanged until it is dropped) reads as follows: Now Lucifer was not dead…. or if he was I am his sorrowful terrible heir; I have been wronged…. I am oppressed…. I hate him that oppresses me, I will either destroy him, or he shall release me. Damn him! how he does defile me, How he informs against my brother and sister and takes pay for their blood, How he laughs when I look down the bend after the steamboat that carries away my woman. Now the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk…. it seems mine, Warily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, my tap is death. (LGV, 1:116) Why, one might wonder, would such a passage be kept so long after abolition, not simply stricken from the poetic record in 1867? The answer would seem to be that these remarks invoke a condition of oppression that has not ended with the end of slavery: while members of families are no longer being sold down the river (“I look down the bend after the steamboat that carries away my woman”) circa 1871–72, the injustice with which African Americans are treated continues apace under Jim Crow. Whitman's retention of these lines suggests that it is only after black males achieve suffrage through the Fifteenth Amendment (ratified in February 1870 and so probably too late to figure in the so-called 1871–72 Leaves, which actually was first printed in 1870) that anything like a recuperation of their humanity is possible.39 As Ed Folsom and Kenneth M. Price observe of the powerful deleted passage, in it Whitman is “letting his voice emerge from the black slave's mouth”: “Whitman's attempt is not to speak for the black slave but to speak as the black slave.”40 It is no doubt the delicate situation of speaking either for or as a black slave after suffrage—of appropriating that voice, Page 36 → which symbolizes subjectivity and political agency—that leads Whitman no longer to want to perform his act of ventriloquy. It is also during Reconstruction that Whitman begins to amend a number of previously published poems in order to take account of the Civil War and its aftereffects and decry the moral corruption that he sees gripping the federal government. One of the most thoroughgoing re-dressings is to his poem “Respondez!” in 1871 (its last appearance in Leaves), where he decries the moral turpitude into which the country has sunk, lines not present in 1856–67: (Stifled, O days! O lands! in every public and private corruption! Smother'd in thievery, impotence, shamelessness, mountain-high; Brazen effrontery, scheming, rolling like ocean's waves around and upon you, O my days! my lands!\n\nFor not even those thunderstorms, nor fiercest lightnings of the war, have purified the atmosphere;) (LGV, 1:261) These lines significantly enlarge the tenor of the poem, which, originally addressed to the political malfeasance of 1856, is turned into one about the political and corporate mire of Reconstruction. Of course, both versions of the poem seek to expose through a series of sharp-tongued transpositions the depravity of the times—as true for 1856 as 1871, or so Whitman felt. He builds into the poem an utterance not meant to cancel out previous utterances, then, but to prove them, to reveal the self-consistency of American cultural history and his own performance of it: “As America fully and fairly construed is the legitimate result and evolutionary outcome of the past, so I would dare to claim for my verse” (PP, 664). While Betsy Erkkila has documented well some of the changes that Whitman effects in these reconstructed Reconstruction-era poems, she does not comment on the poet's particular use of parentheses or on the relationship of that device to the matter of oral performance and the poet's simulation of liveness. Michael Moon refers to these marks of punctuation, abundant in the 1860 edition of Leaves, as “the typographical sign of utterance through ‘dead lips,’” taking his cue from lines in “As I Ebb'd with the Ocean of Life”: “(See! from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last! / See—the prismatic colors, glistening and rolling!).” As he finds, “This utterance emerges from between parentheses, themselves bits of ‘type’ which form a Page 37 → typographical figure or ‘impression’ of the ‘dead lips’ which enclose as they disclose what is said, encrypting the poet's voice far within the text and, indeed, launching its utterance from a posthumous position, from ‘beyond’ the space of ordinary human utterance which the reader presumably still occupies and from which the first two editions of Leaves of Grass were written.”41 As vivid as Moon's description is, it is more profitable to read parenthetical interpolation in Whitman's poetry as a sign not of a speaker with both feet in the world of the dead, but of a speaker with both feet in the world of the living, standing beside (literally, “an insertion beside”) the addressee: parentheses stand as a badge of topicality, of presence, not of posthumousness, allowing Whitman to validate and authenticate truths of already uttered poems—truths that he finds to be essentially unchanged and unchanging (as the essence of all parentheses is that, without them, the sentence is complete). In Whitman's verse after 1867 we find an increasing reliance on parentheses, as he seeks to modulate more finely his printed voice and prove the prophetic fitness of his poetry. (Of the thirty-five parenthetical statements in “Song of Myself” in the final edition of Leaves, only one appears as early as 1855, with two more added in 1860; the vast majority appear after the Civil War, in 1867, with twenty-three new parenthetical statements joining those three, for a total of twenty-six. In the 1871–72 edition, Whitman revises to include five more, and in the final Leaves, there are an additional four.) In “Song of the Banner at Daybreak,” we are told for the first time in 1871 (the poem marks its first appearance in Drum-Taps in 1865) that “(The war is over—yet never over…. out of it, we are born to real life and identity;)” and, later on, that “(The war is completed, the price is paid, the title is settled beyond recall;).” The first of these statements is especially intriguing for the way that it imagines the war constructing us as citizens: our very identity as “American” is, in a continuing way, performed by the war and its legacies. Post–Civil War re-visioning of “By Blue Ontario's Shore” echoes this idea in a line added to the poem in 1867, “The war—that war so bloody and grim—the war I wish to forget—was you and me”; here, again, Whitman directly identifies us not with but as the war, our performance of social relations as Americans bound up in it. In 1871, the following change to the line is made: “The war, (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will henceforth forget), was you and me” (LGV, 1:207). The parenthetical comment is seemingly more sure here, as the speaker asserts that from this time forth he will forget the war, not just “wish” to forget it, being distant enough from it. Page 38 → A final phase of Whitman's textual performance entails a shift from the unabashed nationalism so prominently on display in the Centennial (1876) edition of Leaves to the ethos of internationalism that inflects poems tailored for the final editions. In 1881–82 Whitman adds “Song of the Universal” to Leaves (the poem was first published in 1874 in the New York Evening Post), with the image of America “Embracing carrying welcoming all,”\n\ncomprehending with due respect the cultures of “other lands” (PP, 370). He also folds back into Leaves his poem “On Journeys through the States,” which appears in 1860 for the first time but then is left out in 1867, interpolating two lines that transform the national procession of 1860 into an international goodwill tour “(Ay, through the world—urged by these songs, / Sailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)” (LGV, 2:313). In text intended as the 1867 preface to Leaves, Whitman's identification of America with the world (indeed, as synecdoche for the world) resounds: “I claim that in literature, I have judged and felt everything from an American point of view which is no local standard, for America to me, includes humanity and is the universal.”42 In 1876, this attitude substantially recedes, as Whitman becomes more attuned to the charge of parochialism and arrogation, insisting that no one nation can stand for all others, that there exist legitimate multiple points of view. In “Passage to India” Whitman hails in 1871 “The earth to be spann'd, connected by network, / The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage, / The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near, / The lands to be welded together” (LGV, 3:565). Here the poet appears as a different sort of fuser—not of America, as earlier, but rather of all democratic nations. “Song of the Exposition,” a poem “Originally recited for Opening the 40th Annual Exhibition American Institute, New York, noon, September 7th, 1871,” first included in Leaves (as an annex) in 1872, and issued again at the international Centennial exposition held in Philadelphia in 1876, likewise turns from a poem trumpeting the plenitude of America only into a multicultural celebration of the wealth of nations (LGV, 3:612). In a proposed 1876 preface to a foreign edition of his work, he announces that his main poetic purpose is “to suggest and help a deeper, stronger, (not now political, or business, or intellectual, but) heroic, artistic, and especially emotional, intertwining and affiliation of the Old and New Worlds”: The “glory” of “These United States” is now measured “not in their geographical or republican greatness” but rather “in a vaster, saner, more splendid COMRADESHIP, typifying the People everywhere, uniting closer and closer Page 39 → not only The American States, but all Nations, and all Humanity. (That, O Poets! Is not that a theme, a Union, worth chanting, striving for? Why not fix our verses henceforth to the gauge of the round globe? the whole race?” Penning “international poems,” Whitman reveals that heretofore patriotism has been defined too narrowly (“we have adhered too long to petty limits”), as he continues to take stock of the world and America's place in it"
