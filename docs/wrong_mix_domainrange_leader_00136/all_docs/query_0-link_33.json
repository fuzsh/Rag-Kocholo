        "text": "Read the first comments we received\n\nMwalimu Nyerere's economic policies for Tanzania did prove to be disastrous for his people. However he made sure that his people were Tanzanians first, unlike other societies in Africa where tribalism is the order of the day. As a Kenyan I have great admiration for Mwalimu in that he had the foresight to know that division along tribal lines would tear his country down. For this alone he stands out as one of the great leaders of our time. May his soul rest in peace.\n\nMundu wa Mbalo, U.S.A.\n\nNyerere would forever remain in African history as one of the great prophets of the age.\n\nMujtaba Adam, Nigeria\n\nTanzania has lost a leader who brought the country to Independence. Every country goes through ups and downs economically. and we all learn from our mistakes. Today I feel Tanzania is the most safest country to live in Africa. The country has lost a great leader who kept the people of Tanzania united together. I was born and raised in Dar Es Salaam, until moved to US. Nyerere has done a lot for the country and will be missed all people who respected his honest policies.\n\nAnita Gandhi, California, USA\n\nIn every era there are certain great personalities who leave their mark on the history and culture of mankind, men who personally influence the way in which their contemporaries think, act and live. This was Julius Nyerere. no matter what he did, he did it in good intention. He was a great man. He was a political prophecy.\n\nNeema Sitta, USA\n\nThe most important point is not that Mwalimu Nyerere failed in his villagisation policy. The point is that he had a plan for his country although it turned out not to be viable. If I may borrow from another prominent African, the main problem with the continent nowadays is that its leaders don't have any ideology. At least Nyerere was different.\n\nJanvier D. Nkurunziza, UK\n\nSo have a lot of countries failed in their economic reforms,eg. Russia, Republic of Congo etc. Mwalimu left us a legacy of keeping a country politically and culturally united.\n\nSalma Sulemanji, USA\n\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere, was a great leader of his generation. As a person who grew up in Tanzania, I do understand Dr Nyerere's accomplishment, he worked tirelessly for the independence of most of the southern African countries, despite the difficulties he had with western governments during 1960s and 1970s, but he didn't gave up. This is the man who had goals to fulfil and he was able to fulfil them, and even before his death, he saw all countries south of Tanzania's borders were free and ruled by their own people, not the colonial one.\n\nNarsus Barnabas, Finland/Tanzania\n\nRath Andor, You do not see m to understand. You have never lived or been to Tanzania ...so do not talk about something which you do not know. I have lived there and enjoyed the benefits brought by Nyerere to his country. He was an honest man and who had a vision for his people. All this negative criticism from the west is because he did not submit to the needs of the MANIPULATIVE western countries. The west had always tried to get their way around politics in Africa and other third world countries. BUT NOT IN TANZANIA. When it came to Nyerere they could not do anything. He deserves a good goodbye from the people he liberated and that is what he received. So why are you whining ?\n\nKristasen Balf, Sweden\n\nMualimu, Mualimu!! A great son of Africa and indeed father of African generations born and unborn. Dr Nyerere was and is indeed a hero and role model of African Leadership, irrespective of his failed socialism. Like Sir Ketumile Masire, Botswana's former President, we salute you Dr J. M. Nyerere.\n\nOmphile Rhee Hetanang, Botswana\n\nLike any other life, Nyerere's cannot simply be reduced to a single issue, no matter. True, the Ujamaa, or \"solidarity\" as it might be generally translated from Kiswahili, does loom large among his national policies. But other policies and the personal qualities that made them possible are as much what made Nyerere Mwalimu as anything else. Among these are his unflinching commitment to African liberation, laying the foundation a truly united republic where tribalism and other sectarian divides that characterise most of the rest of Africa were tamed, modest living and earthly humour. All these things made Nyerere a very popular person with ordinary Tanzanians and other Africans.\n\nNgendanyoye, Switzerland\n\nHow can you call a leader that renders your country one of the poorest in the world a prophet? To give him credit he admitted failure, which if many other African leaders could do Africa would be a better continent. If Tanzanians were liberated by this man why has Tanzania just embarked on a program of indignation after forty years of independence?\n\nWhy? Because he created what is very common in Africa, a massively corrupt bureaucracy. Once you had a job with the government you had a job for life. Your salary was low but bribes were good. Dictators like Moi, Mugabe and Nujuma, to name a few, should take cognisance of his actions an step down thus bringing freedom to your own people\n\nPhillip, South Africa\n\nI have admired Mw. Julius Nyerere for a long time. I could see the problems in my homeland, Kenya, as the rich got richer and the poor perished. The leaders grabbed what the could and expected to worshiped for it. Mwalimu on the other hand was creating a united country with a motto of 'do not exploit or allow yourself to be exploited'. He encouraged the people of his country to strive at being self-reliant. He also knew that Tanzania would not go very far on its own and tried to forge unity in the region thus the creation of the 'East African Community' and Tanzania itself was a union of Tanganyika and Zanzbar. The support his country gave the liberation movements was invaluable. The western powers did not care about the liberation and freely traded and supported the white minority regimes. The south African countries have a lot to thank Mwalimu for.\n\nNdungi wa Mungai, Australia\n\nHe was neither a political messiah nor a false prophet because he was honest and intelligent, but not an achiever. He was only an idealist.\n\nL. Mariri, Botswana\n\nThe path to Hades is paved with good intentions ......\n\nF. Binsley, USA\n\nI would like to ask expatriates like Neil Ashurst what they have achieved in Africa? Their achievements can be seen by everyone who looks at the situation of Africa objectively: The African today is poorer than he was in the 80s; five-sixth of the world's wealth is in the hands of one-sixth of its population. So the question begging for an answer now is what capitalism has accomplished if policies like those introduced by Mwalimu Nyerere are today considered failures?\n\nWesterners have always looked at any diversions from their accepted norms to be bad and they have gone out of the their ways to sabotage such policies from their very conceptions. I wonder how guys like Neil Ashurst can explain the fact that stooges like Mobutu at one time had six times more money than their countries debts and the west did not complain? The solution to Africa's problem would only come from illustrious sons of Africa like Mwalimu Nyerere. May his soul rest in peace.\n\nNuhngoh, Cameroon\n\nI don't care what others think of Nyerere. To me, He was a honest man, genuinely concerned about Tanzania; and throughout his entire life he fought for the betterment of Tanzania.\n\nImma Malele, UK\n\nIf he preached his theories as a prophet, then he was a great liar.\n\nMohammad Imran Aslam , Malaysia/Pakistan\n\nLike an old African (Oromia) saying \"To try may be to fail, but not to try is the surest way to failure\". Whether he succeeded or not. His teaching and influence had a lot of impact throughout out the word. His stature and presence and what he had done to liberate Africa alone qualify him to be called one of Africa's greatest statesmen if it is not the world.\n\nNatoli Oromo, Oromia\n\nNyerere was a great thinker, he walked the walk and talked the talk. May his soul rest in peace!\n\nSsevvume Richard, Uganda.\n\nIt is a great loss not only to our country but to the whole world. He was a great leader whose wisdom and leadership was surely to be admired. Being a youth, he is a role model for me and the world to follow.\n\nMustafa B. Dinani, Tanzania\n\nI was amazed by all the negative criticism, the late Mwalimu Nyerere received upon his untimely death. I am an Ethiopian by origin, who had the chance to live in Tanzania for four years, from 1990 to 1994. I went to high school there, and learned Nyerere's Ujaama in Siasa (politics) class, although I don't agree with everything Ujaama stands for, I admire the basic fundamentals, which are free education and health service for all, and in order to reach these goals you have to form a community, some call it, villagization.\n\nThe other most amazing thing is, when the rest of Africa is engaged in meaningless wars, including my country, Ethiopia; Tanzanians were enjoying peace and harmony. Yes, even though, they were poor, they did not become stooges for westerners or Russia, and kill their brothers and sisters. Because, Mwalimu has taught them that, the solution for African problem does not come from the west or Russia, it comes from us, the Africans. Little knowledge is very dangerous, so please study the issues before jumping to conclusions, and see things from all aspects, economical, social and political. Mwalimu rest in peace.\n\nYoseph Mekonnen, USA\n\nI am amazed by the snide comments about Nyere mostly from Westerners: yet there is a country in the West that prides itself on its probity and democratic ideals, but politicians are elected depending on how much money they can muster. As fir Human Rights, Convicts, including children are kept waiting for years on Death Row before they are executed in revolting ways.\n\nJanet, UK\n\nTo me, Mwalimu Nyerere is Africa's greatest man of our time. He was a righteous man who tried to the best of his human ability to do good, not for himself but for mankind in his country, for Africa and the international community as a whole. I thank God (for him) now that he is going to be buried in the soil of a TOTALLY FREE AFRICA, which was one of his missions! It is enough to say that Mwalimu was a selfless GOOD MAN, an example I can not easily sight anywhere in Africa.\n\nEmmanuel Malaba, Tanzania\n\nTanzania, and indeed Africa will never be the same again after the loss of an illustrious son, and a towering figure, Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere. Nyerere was not only the architect of Tanzanian nationalism, but a champion of the struggle against the forces of oppression, colonialism and man's inhumanity to man in continental Africa. He lived and died fighting the good fight to uphold the ideals of human rights and dignity, and to foster an egalitarian society across all Africa. Nyerere walked the walk and talked the talk with utmost selflessness, humility and equanimity. Nyerere was a man of character and vision. The peace, tranquillity and sense of national pride that prevail in Tanzania today is only a part of his enduring legacy. Africa will sorely miss Dr Nyerere.\n\nNwora Onwuzulu, Nigeria\n\nFalse prophet? Nyerere was not a prophet, he was just a realist who with good intentions tried to show that Africa can go on it's own way without blindly following western ideologies. Those who claim that he failed say so because they measure success with material development. Those who see success as peace and unity will not fail to see that Nyerere excelled in these. His achievements will remain in Tanzania and Africa for many years to come!\n\nPeter, UK/Tanzania\n\nNyerere is often credited with the far-reaching achievements of Tanzania's health and education systems. Yet they were paid for by Western taxpayers, who kept these programmes alive on artificial life support. Between them Sweden, Norway, Finland, Holland and Canada provided around £2.7 billion every year; in 1983-84 British aid amounted to £26 million. By the mid 1980s Tanzania was the highest per capita recipient of foreign aid in Africa.\n\nNyerere's own policies of socialist collectivisation had reduced Tanzania to one of the world's poorest countries by 1985, burdened by debt and with inflation running between 30 and 40 percent, industry at only 30 percent of capacity, and crippled by a lack of foreign exchange to import raw materials and spare parts. Nearly half of the 330 firms nationalised by the government had gone into liquidation and a third of those that survived lost money. Tanzania had become dependent upon imports of cereals and had to introduce rationing; peasants in Shinyanga province faced starvation through lack of maize.\n\nIf this is kind of late ex-President held up as a shining example of African leadership, then maybe Africa needs no more \"great leaders\".\n\nHenry Case, UK\n\nIt is interesting to note that most of the negative comments about Nyerere so far have predominantly been from the US, from people like Rath Andor. Nyerere's self-reliance policies obviously turned out to be impractical for many reasons, a lot of which had to do with the ideological acrimony at the international level between the super powers. His ideas were well meaning, and could probably still be applied today with the will of the people.\n\nNevertheless, the important issue is that Nyerere admitted to the failure of the program himself. Moreover, Nyerere will be remembered for a whole lot of other ideas and deeds some of which include the total decolonization of Africa, and the dismantling of all the brutal racist regimes in southern Africa. It is absurd to suggest that Tanzanians were better off during colonial rule. Colonialism as a global arrangement was evil and untenable. Whatever mirage(s) of \"better conditions\" under colonialism anywhere in Africa were just that, illusions. Where they existed, they were for the few who constitute the present sentimental colonialists and their offspring who long for the return of that by-gone era. Nyerere was and is ours. His mistakes are ours because we claim them. His achievements brought us light, and for that Africa will forever be thankful. As for Mr. Rath Andor and the like, I wonder what they have to say on behalf of the likes of Mobutus and Bandas. I bet they are their heroes.\n\nMoses Warotua Haimbodi, Namibia/USA\n\nJulius Nyerere proved to be one of the Greatest African and World Leaders. He enjoyed respect not only in Tanzania but through out the world. Among other aspects that gained him popularity was his voluntary act to step down as the president of Tanzanian and leader of the ruling party. He showed a very good example to the other World Dictators and, those leaders who want to die in office that all people can, and should have a chance to lead.\n\nMwalimu Nyerere's leadership went through the \"Learning Circle\" consisting of four basic stages: 1- What happened during the period? (Reflection), 2- Why did it happen?, 3- What lessons were learned?, 4- What can be done to improve the situation?.\n\nMichael Mondi Lopidia, Southern Sudanese in UK"
