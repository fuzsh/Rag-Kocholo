The School was co-founded by the six sister parties in Southern Africa, namely Chama Cha Mapinduzi of Tanzania, the African National Congress of South Africa, the Mozambique Liberation Front Party and the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, the South West Africa People's Organization Party of Namibia and the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message in this regard.\n\nSong Tao, Minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, read out the congratulatory message at the groundbreaking ceremony. Song expressed that President Xi Jinping’s congratulatory message fully shows the CPC’s best wishes to the six sister parties for well building and operating the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School, as well as fully embodies the CPC’s profound friendship with the six sister parties, thus charting the course for and injecting impetus into the further enhancement of exchanges and mutual learning. President Xi Jinping and leaders of African countries will gather at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation this September, which will surely inject new strong impetus into the development of China-Africa relations in the new era. The CPC is willing to, together with the six sister parties, intensify experience exchanges and mutual learning in party governance and state administration, adhere to the development path that is suitable to respective national conditions, and jointly build an even closer community of a shared future for China and Africa.\n\nJohn Pombe Joseph Magufuli, President of Tanzania, attended and addressed the groundbreaking ceremony. Magufuli warmly welcomed Song and secretary-generals of the six sister parties in Southern Africa to attend the groundbreaking ceremony of the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School and jointly witness the important historical moment. Magufuli expressed that the great CPC has always stood together with the six sister parties during their struggle for national independence and liberation, thus forging profound friendship. At present, the six countries in Southern Africa have entered a new important development stage and faced the new mission of exploring a development path that is suitable to respective national conditions and realizing economic independence and liberation. Magufuli thanks the great CPC for continuing to provide the six sister parties with precious support which will inject strong impetus into the deepening of the great friendship with the CPC.\n\nSecretary generals of the six sister parties in Southern Africa attended together the groundbreaking ceremony, and respectively read out the congratulatory letters from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi, Angolan President Joao Lourenco, Namibian President Hage Geingob, and Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa. They all expressed that the founding of the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School will surely play a fairly important role in the party building in Africa, and provide a new platform for party-to-party exchanges and cooperation between Africa and China. They hoped to continue strengthening experience exchanges and mutual learning with the CPC in the future.\n\nAfter the speeches, Song, together with Magufuli and secretary generals of the six sister parties in Southern Africa, laid the foundation for the School.\n\nThe Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School is a joint training institution of the six sister parties in Southern Africa. The School was co-founded by the six parties and built by a Chinese company as a result of a bid invitation.\n\nEnditem"
