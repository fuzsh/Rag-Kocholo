        "text": "DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - Retired Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere has been replaced as international mediator in the Burundi conflict, it was learnt in Dar es Salaam.\n\nThe Tanzania News Agency (Shihata) reported on Monday that the change is contained in a joint agreement signed between a delegation representing Burundi military ruler, Major Pierre Buyoya, and that of the Council for National Defence and Democracy (CNDD), led by Leonard Nyangoma.\n\nNyangoma was Burundi's interior minister. He retreated to the bush after the assassination of that country's first democratically-elected President, Melchior Ndadaye, on Oct. 21, 1993.\n\nShihata cited articles in the so-called general accord, signed in Rome on March 10, which says Nyerere had been replaced by Andrea Riccardi of Italy.\n\nAccording to the accord, Riccardi will conduct the new mediation under the auspices of a Rome-based religious community known as Saint Egidion.\n\nThe two delegations of the government in power in Burundi and that of CNDD have decided to convene the coming meetings as planned and agreed that all negotiations will exclusively take place in the city of Rome, Italy, with the mediation of the Saint Egidion community, the agreement states.\n\nInvestigations here have revealed that Buyoya's delegation was led by Bernard Barandereka, Burundi's Minister of Mines while that of CNDD was under Leonce Ndarubagiye, a former Provincial Governor.\n\nThe accord says the two parties decided that the peace dialogue should be conducted in the presence of the religious community as mediator. Observers could also be allowed to the talks, it adds.\n\nThe two delegations have met twice in Rome, apparently to conduct Secret talks under Riccardi, the accord explains. The first meeting was held from Feb. 29 to March 10 and the second on April 10.\n\nThe organisation of the opening ceremonies of the so-called secret talks was overseen by Riccardi in collaboration with Father Matteo Zuppi. Also present was Italian Senator Rino Serri, who is Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, the former majority party thrown out of power by Buyoya last July 25, the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) has condemned the Buyoya-CNDD accord.\n\nFRODEBU said the accord was aimed at sabotaging efforts by countries in the Great Lakes region and the international community to bring permanent peace to Burundi.\n\nThe party's national chairman, Jean Minani, maintained in a telephone interview Sunday, that his party still recognises Nyerere as the sole mediator in the incessant Burundian conflicts.\n\nHe said FRODEBU was, by extension, determined to respect Arusha as the negotiating venue and not anything to the contrary.\n\nWe in FRODEBU will respect and adhere to all decisions made so far by the heads of state of the countries in the Great Lakes region on finding a permanent solution to the ongoing Burundian political crisis, he stated.\n\nCopyright =A9 1997 Panafrican News Agency.
