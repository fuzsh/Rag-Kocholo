The English-language version of the program is also available on television and online. To help viewers better understand Chinese diplomacy, Xinhua is releasing a variety of reports that include anecdotes, clips from major speeches, facts and figures.\n\nBEIJING, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are a selection of keywords concerning China's foreign policy and related explanations:\n\nCHINA'S AFRICAN POLICY\n\nIn March 24, 2013, ten days after being elected president of China, Xi Jinping visited Africa on his first trip abroad as president.\n\nXi announced that China-Africa relations should be guided by sincerity, concrete results and good faith in a speech at the Julius Nyerere International Convention Center in Tanzania.\n\n\"Friendship and cooperation between the two people has become symbols of China-Africa relations and are well received by the international community,\" said Xi.\n\nCHINA'S NEIGHBORHOOD DIPLOMACY\n\nAfter President Xi took office in 2013, China's neighborhood diplomacy entered a new phase, one featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness.\n\n\"A good neighbor is not to be traded for gold,\" Xi famously said in 2013. China's neighborhood diplomacy will not only benefit its neighboring countries, but will also contribute to the peace and prosperity of the region and the rest of the world.\n\nIn October, 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte paid a four-day visit to Beijing, China. The visit presented an opportunity for relations between the two countries to restart on fresh, more positive footing."
