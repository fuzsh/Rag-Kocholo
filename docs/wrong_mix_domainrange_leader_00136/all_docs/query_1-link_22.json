        "text": "The South Centre Agreement was opened for signature in September 1994 on the occasion of the Annual Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 held in New York under the chairmanship of Algeria. The Centre is the first intergovernmental institution of the South of its kind at the global level. Constituting an additional mechanism to facilitate and promote South-South co-operation on a South-wide basis, the South Centre has the following among its central objectives:\n\nTo contribute to South-wide collaboration in promoting common interests and coordinated participation by developing countries in international forums dealing with South-South and North-South matters, as well as with other global concerns;\n\n- To foster convergent views and approaches among countries of the South with respect to global economic, political and strategic issues related to evolving concepts of development, sovereignty and security;\n\n- To contribute to better mutual understanding and co-operation between the South and the North on the basis of equity and justice for all and, to this end, to the democratization and strengthening of the United Nations and its family of organizations.\n\nSo as to be able to pursue these objectives effectively, and without aiming to be a Secretariat, the South Centre has been established as an intergovernmental body of developing countries which enjoys full intellectual independence.\n\nThe South Centre works for the benefit of the South as a whole, making efforts to ensure that all developing countries and interested groups and persons have access to the CentreÂ’s publications and the results of its work, irrespective of membership.\n\nThe following countries have signed and ratified the Agreement of the South Centre: Algeria, China, Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Egypt, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Libya, Malawi, Malaysia, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Tanzania, Viet Nam, Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe."
