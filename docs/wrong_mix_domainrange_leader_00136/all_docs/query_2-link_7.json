        "text": "\". . . It is particularly important that we should now understand the connection between freedom, development, and discipline, because our national policy of creating socialist villages throughout the rural areas depends upon it. For we have known for a very long time that development had to go on in the rural areas, and that this required co-operative activities by the people . . .\n\n\"When we tried to promote rural development in the past, we sometimes spent huge sums of money on establishing a Settlement, and supplying it with modern equipment, and social services, as well as often providing it with a management hierarchy . . . All too often, we persuaded people to go into new settlements by promising them that they could quickly grow rich there, or that Government would give them services and equipment which they could not hope to receive either in the towns or in their traditional farming places. In very few cases was any ideology involved; we thought and talked in terms of greatly increased output, and of things being provided for the settlers.\n\n\"What we were doing, in fact, was thinking of development in terms of things, and not of people . . . As a result, there have been very many cases where heavy capital investment has resulted in no increase in output where the investment has been wasted. And in most of the officially sponsored or supported schemes, the majority of people who went to settle lost their enthusiasm, and either left the scheme altogether, or failed to carry out the orders of the outsiders who were put in charge - and who were not themselves involved in the success or failure of the project.\n\n\"It is important, therefore, to realize that the policy of Ujamaa Vijijini is not intended to be merely a revival of the old settlement schemes under another name. The Ujamaa village is a new conception, based on the post Arusha Declaration understanding that what we need to develop is people, not things, and that people can only develop themselves . . .\n\n\"Ujamaa villages are intended to be socialist organizations created by the people, and governed by those who live and work in them. They cannot be created from outside, nor governed from outside. No one can be forced into an Ujamaa village, and no official - at any level - can go and tell the members of an Ujamaa village what they should do together, and what they should continue to do as individual farmers . . .\n\n\"It is important that these things should be thoroughly understood. It is also important that the people should not be persuaded to start an Ujamaa village by promises of the things which will be given to them if they do so. A group of people must decide to start an Ujamaa village because they have understood that only through this method can they live and develop in dignity and freedom, receiving the full benefits of their co-operative endeavor . . .\n\n\"Unless the purpose and socialist ideology of an Ujamaa village is understood by the members from the beginning\" at least to some extent it will not survive the early difficulties. For no-one can guarantee that there will not be a crop failure in the first or second year - there might be a drought or floods. And the greater self-discipline which is necessary when working in a community will only be forthcoming if the people understand what they are doing and why . . .\n\n\"The fact that people cannot be forced into Ujamaa villages, nor told how to run them, does not mean that Government and TANU have just to sit back and hope that people will be inspired to create them on their own. To get Ujamaa villages established, and to help them to succeed, education and leadership are required. These are the things which TANU [Tanzania African National Union] has to provide.\n\n\". . . The Arusha Declaration and the actions relating to public ownership which we took last week were all concerned with ensuring that we can build Socialism in our country. The nationalization and the taking of a controlling interest in many firms were a necessary part of our determination to organize our society in such a way that our efforts benefit all our people and that there is no exploitation of one man by another.\n\n\"Yet these actions do not in themselves create socialism. They are necessary to it, but as the Arusha Declaration states, they could also be the basis for fascism\" in other words, for the oppressive extreme of capitalism. For the words with which I began my pamphlet Ujamaa in 1962 remain valid; socialism is an attitude of mind. The basis of socialism is a belief in the oneness of man and the common historical destiny of mankind. Its basis, in other words, is human equality.\n\n\"Acceptance of this principle is absolutely fundamental to socialism. The justification of socialism is Men; not the State, not the flag. Socialism is not for the benefit of black men, nor brown men, nor white men, nor yellow yellow men. The purpose of socialism is the service of man, regardless of color, size, shape, skill, ability or anything else. And the economic institutions of socialism, such as those we are now creating in accordance with with the Arusha Declaration, are intended to serve man in our society. Where the majority of the people in a particular society are black, then most of those who benefit from socialism there will be black. But it has nothing to do with their blackness; only with their humanity. . . .\n\n\"The Arusha Declaration talks of Men, and their beliefs. It talks of socialism and capitalism, of socialists and capitalists. It does not talk about about racial groups or nationalities. On the contrary, it says that all those who stand for the interests of the workers and peasants, anywhere in the world, are our friends. This means that we must judge the character and ability of each individual, not put each person into a pre-arranged category or race or national origin and judge them accordingly. Certainly no one can be a socialist unless he at least tries to do this. For if the actions taken under the Arusha Declaration are to mean anything to our people then we must accept this basic oneness of man. What matters now is that we should succeed in the work we have undertaken. The color or origin of the man who is working to that end does not matter in the very least. And each of us must fight, in himself, the racialist habits of thought which were part of our inheritance from colonialism.\n\n\"It is not an easy thing to overcome such habits. But we have always known that it is necessary, and that racialism is evil. We fought our independence campaign on that basis. And the equality of man is the first item in the TANU Creed. For in our constitution we say 'TANU believes (a) That all human beings are equal; (b) That every individual has a right to dignity and respect.'\n\n\"If we are to succeed in building a socialist state in this country it is essential that every citizen, and especially every TANU leader, should live up to that doctrine. Let us always remember two things. We have dedicated ourselves to build a socialist society in Tanzania. And, Socialism and Racialism are incompatible.\"\n\nThere is little to show that Butiama, the birthplace of Julius Nyerere, raised one of Africa's greatest sons.\n\nMud huts surround the Catholic Church where Nyerere used to pray, and both the church and the mud huts tell a story. From the mud huts came the children who knew exactly when Mwalimu would have his breakfast, and dutifully came to share it with him every morning, and in the church their parents shared a common faith and prayer.\n\n'At first, it was bread and butter for both Mwalimu and the kids. Soon I couldn't cope with the increasing numbers of children joining him for breakfast, so I downgraded it to porridge and kande (a boiled mixture of maize off the cob and pulses),' recalls Mwalimu's former housekeeper, Dorothy Musoga, 74, now living in retirement in Mwanza at a house built for her by Mwalimu.\n\nI met Dorothy by sheer coincidence during Mwalimu's funeral at a pub put up by the Tanzania Peoples Defence Force (TPDF) building brigade at Butiama. Like all Mwalimu insiders, she was full of praise for the departed former president but, above all, worried about the future of his family and what she called Mwalimu's 'other children' who loved to share his breakfast.\n\n'With Mwalimu dead, free breakfast for poor villagers will become a thing of the past,' Dorothy reflected, almost to herself, between sips of warm beer. The poverty of their parents remains, as does the lack of infrastructure at Butiama, which Mwalimu didn't want to transform into an edifice to be envied by Tanzania's 8,000 registered villages.\n\nDuring the last week of October, vehicles thronged the dusty road to Butiama, which runs 11 kilometres from Makutano Juu along the Mwanza-Sirali highway. In fact, the road to Butiama was only made passable by last-minute grading. The net result, however, was a far from comfortable drive. The workmen had, in effect, only succeeded in increasing the circulation of dust.\n\nThe drive was a journey through abject deprivation and grinding poverty. On the way we saw small plots of cassava, much of it wilting under the searing heat. The land was mostly bare.\n\nOn Saturday, October 23, when Mwalimu was buried, Butiama may well have started to slip back into oblivion, to become what it once was, an unknown village in the middle of nowhere. With Tanzania's propensity for neglecting matters until they become a crisis, Butiama's transition from a collective shrine to an ordinary village is likely to be swift.\n\nThe process may, indeed, have started earlier, with Mwalimu's own house, which stands obscured from view by the relatively more affluent boma where the reigning patriarch of the Wazanaki, Chief Japhet Wanzagi, lives. By village standards, the chief's boma stands out as an island of prosperity in a sea of deprivation.\n\nMany people take their first house as a proud possession, but the sewage system at the late Nyerere's first house bears marks of his self-denial. Children fetch water from a public standpipe and their mothers wash clothes in the open. The house itself could do with a fresh coat of paint. Nearby, and just as hidden, is the house where Nyerere's mother, the late Mugaya, lived. However, judging from the relatively wealthier homestead of the chief, Mwalimu was no more than a peasant - which the Tanzanian government would want the world to believe. The truth is that the former president was in fact a prince who simply chose to shun the trappings of privilege out of his own conviction.\n\nThe day after the burial, October 24, I arrived at the village just as villagers in their Sunday best were leaving church. They behaved as if nothing had happened, a stark contrast to the day before when some of them had broken down, unable to reconcile themselves to a future without Nyerere. I was now seeing a different scenario; a people resigned to their common fate.\n\nOnly one person, Dr Ebenezer Mwasha, still remained in the past, eleven days after it had all happened. Dr Mwasha is among the scores of professionals who worked closely with Mwalimu both as individuals and as public servants. 'I always looked forward to Mwalimu's homecoming. I never thought I would have the misfortune to receive his body one day,' Dr Mwasha said ruefully a day before Tanzanians and their well-wishers buried Mwalimu.\n\nI met Dr Mwasha again the Sunday after the burial, and he was still unable to believe the obvious. He and his wife were waiting to see Mama Maria, Mwalimu's widow, before he could drive back to Machame in Kilimanjaro region, where he now runs a non-governmental organisation dealing with primary health care. He told me he had been helping Mwalimu to put up an appropriate sanitation and water supply system at his new house, the one the Tanzania Peoples Defence Forces (TPDF) had built for him.\n\n'It is sad that the old man didn't have much time to stay in it,' Dr Mwasha said. Others at Butiama echoed his words. 'It was God's will, we cannot do anything' a primary school teacher, Gambiwa Masubo, said.\n\nGambiwa accosted me with poems for which he wanted me to find a publisher. 'Can The EastAfrican publish them, please?' he pleaded. Unfortunately, all them were in Kiswahili. In one of the poems, Gambiwa says Mwalimu has 'cleared the bush' so that the rest of Tanzania can move forward.\n\nWhen I later visited the compound of Mwitongo, where Mwalimu was buried not far from the graves of his parents, only a few insiders and the late Nyerere's close family members had remained, among them his former press secretary Sammy Mdee and former aide-de-camp Philemon Mgaya. At the grave itself, TPDF soldiers from the army's building brigade were erecting a permanent structure.\n\nThe mood was still sombre, but noticeable was lighter than before. Some of the mourners took turns to have their pictures taken at the graveside. Was this some transition from mourning to a heritage industry? Now people had accepted the inevitable, Mwalimu's grave was already taking on the air of a world heritage site.\n\nWhen Chairman Mao was asked what he thought about the French Revolution, a century and a half after it had taken place, he retorted: 'It's too early to say.'\n\nFew in Tanzania can give a better answer about the impact of Nyerere's death. For the poor children of Butiama, however, the days of free breakfast with their beloved grandpa are gone. It is hard to imagine what will follow.\n\nJulius Kambarage Nyerere was born at Butiama near the shores of Lake Victoria in the north of Tanganyika. His father had 22 wives and Julius was one of 26 children from his eighth wife, Kambarage.\n\nJulius's father, Nyerere Burito, was a junior chief of the Wazanaki tribe. His grandfather was appointed the first chief of the Wazanaki by the Germans and when he died, his position was awarded on merit to Burito.\n\nWhen Julius was a small child, he played around naked in his father's house. The other children were envious of him because his father was a chief, and yet the family was not rich.\n\nJulius remembers how the cold troubled him one night and how his mother gave up her dark cotton cloth to cover him and the other children, though she had nothing left for herself.\n\nLike other village children, Julius helped his parents fetch water, chop wood and look after the goats.\n\nIn an interview with Drum, Julius's mother remembered him as 'a good child - in fact, almost too good! If I had to go somewhere and I told him to stay in one place, I would find him there when I came back.\n\n'Among his stepbrothers, there was one called Bill, and the two of them became inseparable for a long time. They also acted as leaders among the children at home.'\n\nJulius remembers well the first day he saw a motor car, when he was about six or seven. The car was on the road near their home and strange people stood around it.\n\nJulius was in the bush nearby, watching them carefully. Then he ran back to his father and told him that there were visitors to see him. His father asked him, 'My son, are these visitors Europeans or Indians?'\n\nJulius could not answer because he did not even know what Europeans or Indians were, let alone the difference between them.\n\nWhen he reached the age of twelve, he was taken to school. He recalls that he had no clothes of his own and wore a piece of cloth given to him by his mother. She also gave him money to buy new clothes.\n\nJulius was the smallest child in his group and he says that he was clumsier than many of the others.\n\nOne of his school friends says, 'Julius was always truthful, one had to believe what he told you. All the time Julius was buried in books. One of his favourite authors was John Stuart Mill, who left him thinking seriously about the rights of man.'\n\nNyerere's mother noticed a change in her child after he started school. 'He was still considerate and helped me during the holidays, but he seemed always deep in thought.'\n\nWhen Julius was 22 he entered Makerere College, Uganda. Chief Fundikira, who was to become a minister in Nyerere's first Cabinet after independence, remembers those days: 'If you want the truth, one did not particularly notice Nyerere.'\n\nYet it was at Makerere where Nyerere learned to lead. His organisation, the Tanganyika African Welfare Association, was not a political one, but it aimed to assist the small number of Tanganyikan students at Makerere.\n\nThe welfare association soon joined with the Tanganyika African Association, an organisation started by Tanganyika civil servants, which was also restricted to welfare problems.\n\nNyerere wanted to fight against discrimination, for African rights, for equal work and equal salaries. He felt bitter about the favours which the Europeans enjoyed.\n\nNyerere later described these demands as the 'politics of sheer complaint'. They did not get to the root of the problem. The aim was to make their rulers listen to African grievances so that they could make changes.\n\nIn those days there was no talk of removing the British from power. Nyerere says, 'When I was born, there was not a single person who questioned why we were being ruled, and if my father had heard that we wanted changes, he would have asked me, 'What do you think you can do, you small silly boy?'\n\nNyerere's father died during the First World War, so he was never to ask this question of Nyerere. It was Nyerere's mother who had to confront her son's involvement in the fight for independence.\n\n'I began to know about Julius's activities when he was teaching at Pugu College in 1952. Every day a man called Aziz Dossa came to our house and he would talk with Julius for a long time. One day I overheard them talking about taking over the government from the Europeans.\n\n'I became afraid. Later I asked Julius if what I heard was true. When he said yes, I became more frightened. I told him that what he was doing was bad. God had given him a good job and now he wanted to spoil it. But he said that what he was doing would benefit not only us but everyone in the country.'\n\nThree years later Julius's mother went to meet him at the airport, when he was returning from New York after delivering his famous address to the United Nations.\n\nWhen she arrived, she was very surprised to find so many people there. The crowd was shouting, 'Tanu! Tanu! Tanu!'\n\n'That was the first time that I realised that my son had become such an important person. Soon after this, he resigned from his job to work for Tanganyika African National Union full-time.'\n\nNyerere's Tanganyika African National Union (Tanu) suffered constant harassment before the 1958/59 general election. Nyerere was banned from making public speeches, and twelve Tanu branches were shut by the government. And as if the banning order were not enough, Nyerere was accused of libelling two British officials and put on trial. The following excerpt is from Drum, November 1958.\n\nThe SUN has not yet risen but hundreds of people are already gathered round the small courthouse in Dar-es-Salaam. Some have come from distant villages, with blankets and cooking utensils as if for a camping holiday. They have been in Dar-es-Salaam for more than a week at the trial of the president of the Tanganyika African National Union, Julius Nyerere, on a charge of criminal libel. It was alleged that Nyerere wrote an article in which two district commissioners were libelled.\n\nPolice constables line the streets round the court and a riot squad stands ready nearby in case of trouble. As the time draws near for the court to open, the crowds jostle and shove for the best positions.\n\nThe trial has been a mixture of exciting arguments, explosive surprises and hours of dullness. Mr. Pritt (Nyerere's counsel) insisted that the two commissioners should be called to give evidence. He accused the government of prosecuting Nyerere without investigating his allegations.\n\nThe government was telling the world that if anybody said anything against a district commissioner, he could be put into prison for saying what was true.\n\nWhen Nyerere gave evidence, he took full responsibility for the article and said that he had written it to draw the attention of the government to certain complaints. He was followed by three witnesses who spoke of 'injustices' they had suffered at the hands of the two district commissioners.\n\nHalfway through the proceedings, the attorney-general appeared in court in person to announce on behalf of the Crown that it would not continue with the counts concerning one of the commissioners.\n\nNow, on the last day of the show, the stars begin to arrive: Mr. Summerfield, the chief public prosecutor, Mr. NM Rattansey, defence counsel who is assisting the famous British QC, Mr. DN Pritt.\n\nMr. Nyerere, wearing a green bush shirt, follows later. He smiles and waves as members of the crowd cheer him.\n\nThe curtain goes up with the arrival of Mr. LA Davies, the magistrate. The court is packed. Everyone is tense and hushed. The magistrate sums up then comes to judgment - Nyerere is found guilty!\n\nThe magistrate, in passing sentence, says he has formed the impression that Nyerere is an extremely intelligent and responsible man. He fines Nyerere Pounds150 or six months. The money is raised by locals and the Kenya defence fund.\n\nTanu coasted to a landslide victory in the 1958/59 general election, held under a tripartite system that required every constituency to send one African, one Asian and one European member to the legislature. Each voter had to vote for one candidate of each race.\n\nBesides its own African candidates, Tanu sponsored an Asian and European candidate for each seat. It won 29 out of 30 seats.\n\nFollowing this, the new British governor, Sir Richard Turnbull, announced that Tanganyika would be developed as an African state. In doing so, the British acknowledged for the first time the power of the nationalist movement. In March 1959, Governor Turnbull increased Tanu's role in the government significantly, appointing five members of the newly elected Legislative Council to his 12-man cabinet.\n\nInitially only three ministerial posts were to be filled by Legislative Councillors, one from each race group - but Nyerere insisted on an African majority. Turnbull conceded, and three Africans, an Asian and a European, all Tanu supporters, were appointed. For Nyerere. this victory was a turning-point. Freedom was now in sight. In its March 1959 issue, Drum interviewed Nyerere on his vision of the future.\n\nTANGANYIKA WILL be the first, most truly multiracial democratic country in Africa. When we get our freedom, the light of a true multiracial democracy will be put high upon the top of the highest mountain, on Kilimanjaro, for all to see, particularly South Africa and America.\n\nTanganyika will offer the people of those countries free entry, without passports, to come and see real democracy at work. As long as we do not have a popular government elected by the people on democratic principles, we will strive for freedom from any kind of domination.\n\nWe regard the Trusteeship as part of a scheme to keep Tanganyika under the British Crown indefinitely. The greatest enemy of our vision is the Colonial Office.\n\nBut Tanganyika cannot be freed by drawing up resolutions or by tabulating long catalogues of the evils of colonialism. Nor do we find it enough to tell rulers to quit Tanganyika. It will be freed only by action, and likewise the whole of Africa.\n\nContinued colonialism is preventing investment in this country. Germany, for example, cannot invest money as long as the British are still here. I agree that the country lacks technicians. So what? Shall we give the British another 40 years to train them? How many have they trained in the past 40 years?\n\nAs far as money for a self-governing Tanganyika is concerned, Tanganyika has not been receiving much money from the British taxpayer at all. For the past 11 years, Tanganyika has only received Pounds9 million. I can raise 100 times that within a year if it becomes necessary.\n\nI believe that the continued, not existence, but citizenship of the European would be taken for granted had not the white man created a Kenya, a Central Africa, a South Africa and other similar places and situations.\n\nAfrican nationalism is not anti-white but simply anti-colonialist. When George Washington fought the imperialists, he was fighting for the divine right of Americans to govern themselves; he was not fighting colour.\n\nThe white man wants to live in Africa on his terms. He must dominate and be recognised by the rest of the inhabitants of this continent as their natural master and superior. But that we cannot accept. What we are after is fellow citizenship, and that is exactly what is frightening the white man.\n\nThe question is not whether we must get rid of whites, but whether they must get rid of themselves.\n\nWhites can no longer dominate in Africa. That dream is gone. Africa must be governed by Africans in the future. Whether an immigrant African will have an equal part to play in this free Africa depends upon him and him alone. In Tanganyika, we are determined to demonstrate to the whole of Africa that democracy is the only answer.\n\nWe are being held back, not only by local Europeans, but by the Colonial Office and, I believe, by Europeans in neighbouring countries, who are frightened of the possibility of success in Tanganyika.\n\nLast week. I had this rather terrible nightmare, in which I dreamt that I was dead! Now, as fate would have it, when I awoke I discovered that I was indeed very dead .... Kaput! And what's more? My dead soul had already arrived in the land of the dead, wherever that was.\n\nSince it was still morning and being a stranger in that land of the dead, I went into a nearby Caf\", where I intended to order Coffee, then while at it, also ask for some directions. Coincidentally, it happened to be the same Caf\" in which former African leaders liked to take their breakfast.\n\nThe first one to arrive was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere. Mwalimu headed straight to my table and without even glancing, the former president of Tanzania sat down, put on his glasses and began perusing a little booklet which he had brought along. \"I still can't find anything wrong with this!\" He muttered to himself, shaking his head.\n\nI craned my neck to have a look at the booklet's sleeve and to my surprise, it was written; 'The Arusha Declaration of 1967!' So I decided to greet him. \"Shikamoo Mwalimu, I happen to come from Arusha, a town where that declaration was endorsed.\"\n\nNyerere looked up in surprise, extended his hand and shook mine strongly. Just then two more former African leaders joined us at the table, One being the former Congo president, Mobutu Sese Seko and the other was the former Field Marshall, Idi Amin Dada of Uganda. Nyerere introduced me to them. \"Hello both of you! This fellow here comes from my former country!\" He said.\n\n\"So! Which part of Tanzania do you happen to come from?\" Asked Idi Amin Dada. He looked as well nourished as he always used to be, but this time more serene.\n\n\"Arusha!\" I replied.\" You know, that place which is alleged to be the center point between Cape Town and Cairo City.\"\n\n\"Is Arusha in Tanzania! Wasn't it supposed to be somewhere in Rwanda or Burundi?\" Asked Mobutu, rather perplexed. He was still adorning a leopard skin over his shoulders.\n\n\"Arusha is in Tanzania you should know that!\" retorted Mwalimu. \"Maybe you got mixed up by the idea of the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the 1994 Rwanda genocide being based there and the fact that it was also where the Burundi Peace Negotiation Sessions were being held.\"\n\n\"Well, it could be,\" said Mobutu, still not very much convinced.\" Anyway, what is new back there in the world? Do our people in Uganda; Tanzania and Zaire, still miss us?\"\n\n\"Can't be so sure about that!\" I replied.\" Especially in Zaire. By the way, there is no Zaire, the country's name had been changed into the 'Democratic Republic of Congo,' or in short DRC!\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" Yelled Mobutu. \"What a long, exotic and cumbersome name, it makes tongues bleed to pronounce it.\"\n\n\"So did 'Mobutu-Sese- Seko-Kuku- Ngbendu-Wa- Za Banga,\" said another former African leader who had just joined us at the table. \"The name also used to be quite long, weird and extremely cumbersome. In fact, many tongues, hearts, necks and other parts of human anatomies, shed pure blood, in the process of trying to pronounce it properly!\" The newcomer who said this was none other than .... Laurent Desire Kabila, the founder of DRC.\n\n\"And, what is wrong with human anatomies bleeding?\" asked Idi Amin. \"They are supposed to!\"\n\n\"Stop it now!\" commanded Nyerere, banging on the table and spilling Mobutu's coffee. \"This guy here has just arrived from Tanzania and I want him to tell us about the country, but all you seem to be doing here, is reminisce about your past bloody eras!\" This statement certainly made the other fellows to shut up.\n\n\"Anyway there is nothing new about Tanzania save for the fact that, the country is about to hold its third Multiparty General Elections on October 30. There are ten presidential candidates from about eighteen political parties. However, your old pal, Justice Joseph Sinde Warioba thinks that, there is only one political party and the rest are just groups of whining people .... which they are!\"\n\n\"I understand that this time a woman is also running for the presidency,\" sneered Field Marshall Idi Amin. \"Don't you think this is stretching democracy rather too far?\"\n\n\"No! I don't think so,\" shouted Canaan Banana from another table. The former ceremonial president of Zimbabwe was taking hot milk and sausages. \"There is nothing wrong with a woman running for the presidency as long as she is not allowed to win. It helps convince foreign donors to continue pouring money in our coffers.\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" Supported Mobutu. \"What is important here is cash. An African leader needs money, gold and diamonds to run his hundred castles, feed his thousand women, buy cars for the millions of boot-lickers under his heels, reinforce the loyal military forces and still have enough change left to deposit into his numbered Swiss accounts.\"\n\nNyerere once more opened his Arusha Declaration booklet, shook his head and muttered; \"There is nothing wrong with this manifesto, why did the Tanzanian people chose to trash it? Soon they will all be talking like Banana, Mobutu and Idi Amin .... How I weep for the country!"
