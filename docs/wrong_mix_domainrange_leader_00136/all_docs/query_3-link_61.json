        "text": "We are pleased to present the proceedings of the sixth European Alliance for Innovation (EAI) International Conference on Emerging Technologies for Developing Countries (AFRICATEK 2023), co-organised with the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology in Arusha, Tanzania. This edition focused on smart cities in developing nations, particularly in Africa, and the role of technology in addressing challenges and unlocking potential. AFRICATEK 2023 gathered scholars, researchers, practitioners, and innovators from around the world to exchange ideas, research findings, and practical insights on harnessing technology for sustainable development in Africa. The conference explored themes such as smart city frameworks, technological innovations, and design approaches critical for progress in sectors like education, healthcare, agriculture, and urban planning. The proceedings include rigorously selected papers and four keynote addresses, discussing the transformative impact of technologies like IoT, AI, and data analytics. This volume highlights the fusion of traditional practices with modern solutions and the potential of these innovations to drive socio-economic growth, environmental sustainability, and improved governance and healthcare. We extend our gratitude to the organising and technical program committees, partners, sponsors, and participants for their contributions to the conference's success. The collaborative efforts and insights gained at AFRICATEK 2023 reflect our commitment to integrating cutting-edge technologies in developing regions, paving the way for a future of prosperity and equity. The proceedings of AFRICATEK 2023 serve as a scholarly record and guide for future research, innovation, and policy formulation, aimed at leveraging emerging technologies for societal betterment. We hope this volume inspires continuous dialogue and progress. https://lnkd.in/dcJGkMfr Sabine Moebs Antoine Bagula\n\nJoin us next Wednesday, July 17th, for the second instalment of our exciting webinar series - Unlock Your Potential: DCU Faculty of Engineering and Computing Micro-Credentials 2024/2025.
