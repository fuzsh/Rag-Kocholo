        "text": "The immense growth in cooperation between Asia and Africa since the 1990's in trade, foreign investment and development assistance came on the heels of the renewed interest of Asia's leaders in Africa's development. Reverse developments in both regions in the decades following independence moved Asia's development much further into modernization and rapid economic growth, while slowing down Africa's catch-up process and inclusion into globalization. The campaigns of Dr. Mahathir of Malaysia and Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore to foster south-south partnership to include Africa in globalization in Africa, on different terms than dictated within the policies and perspectives of contemporary global liberalism, have been highly significant in Africa's development prospects. Globalization brought many Africans to Malaysia, yet Malaysians seem to know little about Africa or the growing African population. The forms of knowing about Africa and Africans in Malaysia tend to be inappropriate and are based on dramatic events of illegal character covered by the English language media. Dramatic knowledge leads to unwanted clashes of identity. However, the African diaspora in Malaysia form an important part of the renewal taking place in Africa. more appropriate knowledge of Africans would enhance foreigners' contribution to Malaysia and Malaysia's contribution to African development.\n\nIn this obituary and research note, we dedicate our prayers and peaceful thoughts to the late Associate Professor Dr Hamidin Abdul Hamid (1970-2022), who recently passed away in the late afternoon of September 19, 2022. Malaysians knew him through his national television appearance, famous witty commentaries on national electoral issues, past adjuncts and visiting posts, and consultations. He will always be remembered for his contributions and legacy in advancing African Studies in Malaysia. To colleagues, former students, supervisees, and known associates and academic networks within and outside the circle of History, African Studies, Leadership, and Malaysian elections, his presence is always felt. We are always honoured to know his excellent works in many impactful ways. As part of this attribute to the late Dr Hamidin, the rest of this research note provides updates on current trends in Malaysia-Africa relations and African Studies at Universiti Malaya and in Malaysia generally. We also would like to express our sincere gratitude to SINERGI's Editor-in-Chief, and the rest of her editorial team, UKM Press, and SPHEA, UKM for providing us with the opportunity to share our views on research in Africa-Malaysia relations.\n\nThis thesis is an analysis of the underlying factors that influenced Malaysia-Singapore relations during the watershed period of Mahathir Mohamad as the Prime Minister of Malaysia (1981- 2003). The study proposes that the bilateral tensions between Malaysia and Singapore were, to a large extent, affected by such things as the burden of historical baggage from their acrimonious parting in 1965, after a short period of unification; the differences between them in their perceptions and approaches in handling bilateral relations; and their political cultures and the leadership styles of their prime ministers, but for the purposes of the present study, specifically those of Mahathir and Lee Kuan Yew. The thesis examines a number of key areas of discord between states and leaders alike. Despite the strong underlying differences, the thesis argues, the two states have existed in a condition of interdependency in the post-1965 period. They have had to find ways in which to suppress the culturally- and historically-conditioned tensions in order to ensure their respective statesâ€™ economic growth and political and social development. As a result, we have the curious situation in which both Malaysia and Singapore have found ways of maintaining engagement. In doing so, they have avoided raising tensions to the point of conflict, and, indeed, been able to build bridges through consistent, and determined, application to their bilateral affairs. The thesis provides some explanations as why this should be the case.\n\nDiscrimination (ICERD) deemed to threaten the complexity of ethnic relations in Malaysia, the speech of the 7th Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammad in ratifying the remaining core instrument in human right regarding International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) erupted a public demonstration from Malay-Islam Community which is Himpunan 812, ICERD elements are entirely different from Malaysia whereby dominated by racial and religious elements thus it can further threaten the balance of multiethnic and multireligious in Malaysia. Even before the Himpunan 812, on the 23rd November, 2018 Malaysia government release an official statement that it will not ratify the ICERD. Still, Malay-Islam community is putting the pressure towards the newly elected Federal government not to ratify ICERD. This paper will discuss the reasons that ICERD is not compatible with the Malaysia Federal Constitution. Also, this paper will focus on Malaysia role in combating racial discrimination, and the last part of this paper is discussing the confusion of national identity that leads to ICERD.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia are often considered as kins. The perspective has been influencing the relationship between the two which has been shaped by identity discourse. History, however, proved that geostrategic considerations determined the relationship of the two significantly in the past. This article aims to discuss the Indonesia-Malaysia relationship in the past from geostrategic perspective, and to discuss how are the prospects of the relationship in the Maritime Axis era. This article argues, the relationship between Indonesia and Malaysia is not only determined by identity factors, but also geostrategic ones. Most scholars think that the relationship of the two are the result of culture politicization, but the author sees that geostrategic factors, which is Malaka as one of the center of gravity, are very determinant."
