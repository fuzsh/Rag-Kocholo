        "text": "Punk Propoganda: The Zine and Ladyfests\n\nAn important goal to the Riot Grrl movement, the desire to define their feminism in relation to their mothers, manifested in the various declarations and manifestas created within their zines. These pieces of feminist literature cried for a Revolution Grrl and Lady Style, Now!, all within the pages of self-published and self-distributed magazines, created by and for queer and female youth. Within a constantly growing and evolving network, the movement easily distributed their zines through music clubs, independent record labels, record stores, and zine distributors (distros).\n\nAccording to Zobl, zines can vary widely in design (from photocopied collages to color-printed magazines) and content (from sharing intimate personal experiences to political activism). Print zines are exchanged among friends, and sold at distros, concerts, bookstores, coffee shops, and record stores (448). Content also includes collages of pictures of women, essays, and vegan cooking recipes, and address issues like self-defense, womens health, Riot Grrl, lesbian, queer and transgender issues, feminist parenting, music, and pop culture (Schilt, Zobl, 172). When the internet became more accessible, e-zines began their existence, written by cybergURLs and allowing anyone with internet access to become in-the-knowimportant in including girls with no access to the independent music scenes hard-published zines depended upon for distribution.\n\nZines served as powerful instruments for women and girls in analyzing and deconstructing the portrayal of women in society. Notable zine compiler Leah Lilith Albrecht-Samarasinha provides powerful insights into zine writing, adolescence during Grrl Power, and the flaws of the movement. In her zine Patti Smith, named after her greatest influence as a grrl, she published articles by herself and other teenage girls about sex and depression that couldnt get published in school newspapers and magazines because they were taboo subjects. Many of her subjects, in fact, involve dealing with sex, suicide, eating disorders, life as an adolescent queer, and inter-familial abuse, with a protogrrl aesthetic (Albrecht-Samarasinha).\n\nA rare type of contributor to the Riot Grrl zine network, she explores her experiences as a mixed-race, working class, identified queer adolescent, and felt that the movement did not understand or respect my colored girl, leather-dyke, femme, survivor self (3). Yet to her, the important connection lied within the notion that grrl zines and music linked angry girls, identified as outsiders of mainstream culture, reassuring her that she wasnt the only freak; to love ones freakishness; and create personal liberty through expression. Albrecht-Samarasinha remarks that it was a movement founded in the ideas that girl love can save the world, that grrl unity can conquer allwhich it cant, and those of us who realized that ended up moving further out, creating our own new freak zines (4). The writer acknowledges the movement as a good starting point for women to get their expressive ball rolling, building up their empowerment for lives as women transitioned from grrls.\n\nLadyfests began to be organized in Olympia by ex-Bikini Kill member Tobi Vail, and were festivals consisting of feminist art, music, and activism. The idea originated from the same grassroots, DIY ethics as other elements of Grrl Power, and served as a means to spread platforms for feminist, queer, and transgender art, activism, culture, and politics that encourage young women and feminists to take the self-empowering leap from consumer to cultural producer/performer/organizer (Zobl, 449).\n\nWith these products of the DIY ethos, grrl power has managed to create new symbols, codes, and images for self-representation while participating in communities provided by sharing information through zines and Ladyfests. Doing-it-yourself, for Riot Grrls, meant self-empowerment through self-expression shared through self-created works, which resulted in a liberation from the mainstream economy. By meeting within their local chapters, distributing zines, playing in bands, and organizing and attending shows, Riot Grrls found creative, expressive outlets for feminist ideals and womens and human rights.\n\nGirl Power Politics\n\nOne of the most important issues that surfaced in the Riot Grrl movement, female sexuality, emerged in its most concentrated form yet. Grrls within the movement demanded the reclamation of previously insulting terms by writing whore and slut on their bodies, oftentimes with lipstick, in order to empower sexual freedom and call attention to the taboo subject of young womens (and that of womens in general) sexuality and desire. While the movement never really provided a solution to dealing with this sexual energy (how should a girl deal with this pent-up desire?), it certainly raised questions and awareness regarding this subject. Riot Grrl also reclaimed girl (as grrl, like a growl) and lady to indicate an identification with feminism, queerness, and an alternative youth community (Zobl, 445).\n\nBikini Kills Riot Grrl Philosophy published in their eponymous zine raised many other cultural/political issues and critiques grrls shared. The list the band provided included the desire to figure out how what the grrls do impacts, reflects, perpetuates, or disrupts the norm, seeking alternatives to bullshit christian capitalist ways of doing things (476). They value communication over competition, and support ideals that validate and challenge individuals in order to strengthen them and form stronger communities, which are needed in order to eliminate bullshit like racism, ablebodyism, ageism, specieism, classism, thinism, sexism, anti-semitism and heterosexism. And like punk, the movement strives to dismantle capitalism, searching for an alternative economy more conducive to sharing information instead of profiting because one fits in the norm.\n\nAs a response to the hierarchical position in punk music, Riot Grrl created a decentralized form of rule within the movement. The environment is supportive and unity-minded, allowing young women to share experiences and insights without feeling threatened or dominated as in mainstream society. By eliminating the middle man and following the DIY method, grrls spread a political agenda and call to revolution without the restrictions of male control and eliminating the hierarchical roles between performer and audience member at music shows.\n\nAnyone who identified as feminist, punk, queer, or Riot Grrl could participate, and in the United States unfortunately, these participants mainly came from middle- and upper-classes, had college educations, and were white women in their late teens and early twenties. The movement began with college-aged young women hungry for social revolution in an open environment for possibilities, and the movement was not able to spread much more. Some males were allowed, depending on issues discussed in chapter meetings. The women and girls within the movement have once again reversed rolesfrom consumer to producer, from listener to speaker, from reader to creator, from audience to performerand the result is empowerment as an active and critical member of the movement.\n\nSeeking to break away from the Riot Grrl movement and become more directly involved in politics, some political activist groups were created by women in the early 1990s to extend the reach of their voices. Nicole Panter and Exene Cervenka founded the Bohemian Womens Political Alliance, a pro-woman, pro-choice, pro-child, pro-minority, pro-queer, pro-Earth, prolific, prodigious, profane, pro-arts, pro-change, pro-union and anti-censorship (Beyette, 1) political activist group. The founders both share punk roots, and seek to further womens rights within the political sphere by fundraising for Bohemian-friendly (and female) politicians, providing women of the working class and Bohemian lifestyle with rightful representation in the US government.\n\nIn the Alliances manifesto, the women declare, We are the weird girls who didnt fit in the little girls your parents wouldnt let you play with the teenagers who dressed in black, the bad girls who climbed out of our bedroom windows after dark and caught taxis home at dawn. We are the daughters of Lilith, Lily Munster, Patti Smith and Emma Goldman. We are the women your preachers warn you about (Beyette, 1). Similarities to Riot Grrl extend beyond ideals shared in their manifesto into ideas of decentralizing government and the identification of mainstream organization as decidedly male-dominated. In fact, it was this attribution of patriarchy to the media that fueled a deadly war between the mainstream media and the Riot Grrl movementa war that ended with a clear winner.\n\nThe Media VS Riot Grrl\n\nAs Riot Grrl began growing nationally (and internationally), it seems only natural that media coverage would become more intensive. Yet Riot Grrls refused to cooperate for interviews as a part of their stance against mainstream patriarchy, and the misrepresentative mainstream media depictions of members of the movement began to circulate. Magazine articles and music news commonly pitted bands and important women within the movement against each other, creating rumors of rifts between friends and rivalries between musicians, perpetuating the stereotype of competitive, catfighting women.\n\nThe mainstream media searched for any way to disunite the threat of strong, powerful women coming together to make a change, and they exploited any opportunity to tear apart women dangerous to a centralized patriarchal institution. The mainstream also served as an excellent tool in pointing out the sexism in the music industry, using derogatory terms to describe female musicians, almost as if to say, Whoa! Shes pretty good for a girl. And kinda hot, too! They also grouped female artists together, undifferentiating them (according to Anna Feigenbaum, professor of communications at Richmond University with an interest in gender, sexuality, climate change, and migrant rights) and thus demeaning, confining, and marginalizing themespecially women of color. Magazines, news articles, and footage worked together to make the women within the movement appear ridiculous, immature, angry with men, and intoxicated with feminism.\n\nIn a Rolling Stone article, Grrls at War, the writer pits women rock veterans as being jealously against Riot Grrl. The article also explores the flaws of the movement without acknowledging the benefits it had on young women as an outlet in a culture that usually silences them, and portrays the grrls interviewed as naïve. Maggie Vail, sister of Tobi Vail of Bikini Kill, remarked, It was such a creepy time period for the mainstream media. They co-opted everything and they eventually co-opted Riot Grrl (Meltzer, 31). More attractive women became pin-ups in the mainstream, because they were hot and wearing little clothinga way to draw major capital on the bad-girl image after which hetero males lust; they didnt understand or probably want to investigate the feminist ideologies powering the movement, and the masses fed by the mainstream media saw only what the industry wanted them to see: the fashion of the riot grrls.\n\nIn response to the unfair and disrespectful representation, Riot Grrl called for an all-media blackout, absolutely refusing any interviews or phone calls with the press and completely shutting them out of their movement. Yet they forgot about young girls living in places without local music scenes or feminist existence. Girls in such areas may have wanted or needed such a message or a connection with a community in which they may feel an important part of, and a movement cooperative with the press may have presented such an opportunity in those areas.\n\nAround 1994, Riot Grrl began to implode as the group divided into two sects: women involved for political reasons, searching for ways to discuss political identities and organizing benefit shows, and women involved for personal gain, seeking to popularize their zine or band. Bands began to break up, grrls in the movement moved on to positions in life for womyn, and it seemed that the zine was the only surviving component of the girl power revolution. The mainstream popular media had attempted to discredit young feminists views, invalidating their anger and their experiences, and thus making them disappear. They succeeded in disbanding the collective, destroying the Riot Grrl community, and once again women were individuals, left to face the harmful values held in patriarchal society mostly alone.\n\nCritiquing Grrl\n\nDespite the determination to revolt against the mainstream and ensure girl-style liberty for young feminists of the era, many of the pitfalls of the Riot Grrl movement are unfortunately similar to those of our society. Within the movement, there was an obvious divide between insiders and outsiders; it was like high school, in which the popular, hardcore girls were visibly separated from the unpopular followers. And following in suit of many other music subcultures, Riot Grrl reflected race and class issues found within society. If a girl was not white, hadnt attended college, and not middle-class, then she was marginalized within the movement, and her experiences were rarely acknowledged and her desires never met.\n\nThis is not to say they Riot Grrl movement was not accepting; they encouraged minority women to participatethey just lacked the means and the knowledge about how to embrace and acknowledge differences. The term grrl itself also confines girls to a feminine box, ignoring non-femme identities, as pointed out by Anna Feigenbaum. While I believe that in this situation women must be able to unite and be recognized as able to dump internalized sexism, I acknowledge the importance of society to realize that although we work together, we are not the samea separation difficult for a binary-filled world to grasp. And Riot Grrls reluctance to sell out instills a real-fake binary, a hindrance to feminism in music or music in general. Why cant women make a living off of creating feminist-positive music that spreads their message to the masses?\n\nPost-Grrl: Angry Womyn/Foxcore\n\nWhen the new wave of women in music hitting the sound waves soon after Riot Grrl, the media was ready to dub them angry women, succeeding in coining the most popular and deluded idea of feminists in pop culture. The fact that men created that term trivialized the anger of female musicians. Bands like L7 appeared androgynous and other bands like Hole, The Nymphs, PJ Harvey, and Babes in Toyland stood out from male grunge bands. Yet their male counterparts supported their woman peers, no longer objectifying them and even sometimes seeking to adopt their look as grunge played with cross-dressing and gender-bending roles.\n\nAnd when Sonic Youths Thurston Moore created the controversial term foxcore, he did so with the satirical eye-roll of most men involved in the movement; if he were truly serious as some feminists suspected, his now-wife and then band-mate Kim Gordon (supportive of feminism and the Riot Grrl movement) would have had a thing or two to say. The mainstream media adopted the term, unaware of Moores sarcastic intent when describingloud, female-fronted groups, and foxcore became an umbrella term for female-led bands in the 1990s. Sonic Youth included many pro-women lyrics in their songs, such as in Kool Thing: I just wanna know, what are you gonna do for me?/I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls/From male white corporate oppression?/ Fear of a female planet? As exemplified with this lyric, these bands held similar goals to that of Riot Grrl in challenging the corporate worldyet there were many, many differences between the two groups of musicians.\n\nSimilar to Riot Grrl, the Angry Womyn wave contained mostly female rock bands that made loud, metallic music with powerful emotional themes. The names of songs and albums combine femininity and anger, and many band names referenced female stereotypes and anatomy (Hole, Babes in Toyland). Yet the goal for this group of musicians was rocking out, not necessarily revolutionunlike Riot Grrl. The new musicians sought to draw attention to culturally taboo parts that were seen as too feminine for rock and rolland they did so in a highly publicized way, such as an incident in which the lead singer of L7, Donita Sparks, removed her used tampon on stage and flung it into an unruly audience.\n\nThe bands gave the popular media what it wanted, and as a consequence, Foxcore amounted to success Riot Grrl never imaginednor wishedto receive. They had music videos on MTV and signed to major record labels, showing that women can finally make a living by creating music and have enough financial security to provide for themselves and their family. The poster-woman for success within the movement, Courtney Love, publicly voiced her ambition for successloudly and unabashedly. The kinderwhore look adopted by Love and many of the other musicians of the movement represents the dichotomy into which women must divide within society: a clearly feminine look, with confused internal conflicts manifested through unkempt hair, smeared makeup, and dirty and torn clothes. Despite all of the critiques of selling out within the grunge movement, Foxcore finally provided the mainstream with the messages of angry women, managing to still hold onto the punk ethos of sex, drugs, music, and generally not giving a shit.\n\nPost-Grunge to Today\n\nFoxcore paved the way for more women musicians to find their way into the mainstream, but once these more sellable artists achieved status, the women of grunge found themselves once again struggling for success. Young musicians like Alanis Morrisette and Fiona Apple dominated the airwaves, still singing songs about sexual abuse and female issues, but with appearances easier for the public to digest; i.e., pretty and nonthreatening. Women in music continued to be represented as more and more docile, less and less threatening; the Spice Girls beat the term Girl Power into the minds of young girls and onto t-shirts in every mall in America and Europe, symbolizing the ultimate commercialization of the empowerment of young girlsand the market reached significantly younger than that of Riot Grrl and Foxcore. Five-year-old girls chanted girl power and lusted after the high-heels and makeup donned by the women in bubblegum pop, praising Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. While these artists slipped into the mainstream because of the popular demand for female bands, the term Girl Power was exploited and then ultimately forgotten. Female representation in music downgraded to objectification once more, but this time under the guise of empowerment.\n\nWomen finally had some sort of strong representation in music mainstream, but whether or not it was the representation healthy for young girls and women is strongly debatable. Sure, the songs flout female sexuality, but it is in a manner which allows the woman to be the object, not the subject, and the appearance of Britney Spears as a hyper-sexualized schoolgirl really raises the question of how badly we need this representation, especially when aimed to a younger demographic. Now, the music industry helps objectify girls at younger ages by aiming potential role models clad in heels, make up, and revealing clothing at them. Once again, the mainstream media focuses on fashion rather than content, and therefore perpetuates harmful anti-feminist propaganda into the masses.\n\nWhile todays radio waves are mostly dominated with hits by the Britneys and Mileys of the world, young women are beginning to turn to other bands and musicians that hold values similar to those of Riot Grrl. Le Tigre, Bikini Kills Kathleen Hannas new band, writes odes to proto-punk goddesses and feminist theorists like Gertrude Stein, and similarly, young women are looking back to past movements for musical release and inspiration. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, fronted by the beautiful and often androgynous Karen O, create strongly punk-influenced music with lyrics full of female sexual contentwith the woman as the subject of the fantasy, such as in the song Bang! in which she chants, As a fuck son, you sucked. Karen O yelps, squeals, howls, growls, and makes other inhuman noises characteristic of punk music while donning bizarre outfits and a bowl haircut. And oh yeah, shes Koreannot whiteand accepted as a talented, kickass musician (she has also composed a movie soundtrack for Where the Wild Things Are, maintains a solo side project, and helps up-and-coming bands by performing with them and producing tracks). The Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Le Tigre are two successful bands among the alternative crowd, and if you dig deeper, youll find many more powerful, female-led or female-only rock and folk bands voicing their experiences and struggling against the grain of a finely-combed patriarchal society.\n\nRiot Grrl ideas still thrive in alternative music, grrl zines, and pro-women conferences and Ladyfests, created or organized by passionate, intelligent women looking to share their struggles and provide community in a society that encourages individualism for optimal consumerism. Bands release songs and entire albums online for free, eliminating the middle man and spreading their woman agenda to anybody with access to the internetsomething Im sure the Riot Grrl movement would have done if it had as much access to the web. As feminist propaganda continues to circulate in the underground, it is only a small question of when it will re-emerge as another wave like Riot Grrl, and what lessons will the women involved have learned.\n\nMuch like punk music, feminism has appeared to die with every emergence into pop culture. I believe this is simply because the popular culture ends up attempting to turn every surfacing into a commercialized product because of the capitalist nation in which we live. But it is a movement of strong ideals that challenges the way everybody involved thinks, and only those of the most open minds become the fervent supporters the movement needssupporters who can acknowledge, accept, and use differences to provide every individual with equality. And it raises many que stions about American society when a challenging, engaging ideology cannot survive in the mainstream, but thrives in the underground among outcasts, open-minded individuals, and people actively seeking stimulation outside of the mainstream. If only mainstream, capitalist American society were not so binary-centric, phallo-centric, power-centric, and self-centric, it would acknowledgelike I have since I was littlethat rock is not sex-/gender-identity specific. The world would be a much better place if everyone realized women are just as awesome as men.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nMeltzer, Marisa. Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music. 1st ed.
