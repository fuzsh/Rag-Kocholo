        "text": "The Y2K resurgence is about more than nostalgia for low-rise jeans and body chains; it’s also a return to a mood that Le Tigre frontwoman Kathleen Hanna once called “the party after the protest.”\n\nWhile pop and rap rock were dominating MTV in the early 2000s, a local New York scene was burgeoning with buzzy indie sleaze bands. The Strokes and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were selling out clubs and signing major label deals. Meanwhile, queer artists like a post-Bikini Kill Hanna were experimenting with a genre that was later deemed electroclash, fusing dance tracks with punk rock and pop elements. While looking for some collaborators for her solo side project, Hanna connected with zine maker Johanna Fateman, artist and filmmaker Sadie Benning, and JD Samson, a recent film school grad who came onboard as a projectionist. Samson joined the band full-time when Benning dropped out and Le Tigre, as herstory recognizes it, was born.\n\nA feminist art electro-pop punk trio whose fusion of politics, multimedia and choreography brought a playfulness to their radical content, Le Tigre was revolutionary in its subversion of music tropes and trends. By pairing colorful matching outfits and choreographed dance moves with songs about white supremacy and feminist theory, Le Tigre poked fun at (and had fun with) what was expected of women on stage, especially as their venues grew larger to accommodate a burgeoning fanbase.\n\nThough Le Tigre was an extension of the work Hanna and Fateman had already been doing through the riot grrrl heyday in the early ’90s, the end of that decade was fraught with sexual assaults at Woodstock ’99 and the hypsersexualization of women in the industry. Le Tigre's success, despite a lack of mainstream radio play or MTV spins, was in its resistance to the fabricated idea that feminism was dead and that political songs couldn’t move crowds anymore.\n\nWhile many contemporaneous pop artists were singing about failed heterosexual relationships and cannibalizing what was left of riot grrrl’s third-wave feminism to capitalize on “girl power,” Le Tigre gave audiences the chance to scream along to sarcastic songs like 2001’s “F.Y.R.”: “Yeah, we got all the power getting stabbed in the shower / And we got equal rights on ladies night!”\n\nWhen I saw you at This Ain’t No Picnic last summer, you played right before the headliner, LCD Soundsystem. On stage, the singer James Murphy told the crowd that he used to do sound for Le Tigre.\n\nJohanna Fateman: Just to put the James Murphy thing in context, we are from the same sort of New York scene. He did do sound for us and he did an early remix for us of “Deceptacon,” and so we’ve just known him for a long time. But Le Tigre was active and providing music and part of this new electronic punk thing happening before LCD Soundsystem was making records, I believe. DFA [Records] was doing some stuff, but it’s not like we were born out of LCD Soundsystem; they were born out of us.\n\nYou said it!\n\nJD Samson: With that being said, we didn’t even know that he said that because we just went backstage and hung out with our families or something. That’s really nice that he said that, and I think we have a good relationship with him and a lot of the other bands that we get grouped with, but I don’t think individually or as a team we really care about being qualified with any sort of headline or group of people. That’s the beauty of this project in a lot of ways: we just are doing what we’re doing and we don’t really need anyone else to tell us if it’s good or bad or if it fits or it doesn’t.\n\nThere’s been a real resurgence of “indie sleaze,” a very early 2000s moment that, in a lot of ways, gets positioned as pretty heterosexual and dominated by men, especially in terms of the music. In the documentary Meet Me in the Bathroom, Karen O talks about feeling so alone as a woman in that space, but there were bands like Le Tigre around, so I'm just curious about your relationship to that scene.\n\nJS: First of all, I don’t care about being part of that brand or label and I don’t think any of us do. From a historical perspective, we were friends with feminists and queers and we were part of the art world, and so yes, we were bands at the same time doing a similar kind of thing, but it was in response to a cultural moment and a political moment. So I think that it’s not weird that we had a lot of the same ideas and the textures are similar. Personally, I had straight friends who were part of these bands and I went to see them and was friends with them and hanging out with them. But as a band, we were not going to Yeah Yeah Yeahs shows and hanging out with them. I just did an interview with [the podcast] Indie Sleaze and I said, “Yes, we were a part of making music in the early 2000s and yes, our music sounded — and sounds — the way that it did right then, and I think that that's part of a collective consciousness more than anything.” It wasn't like we got our indie sleaze card to get us into the indie sleaze party or whatever. That's what happens when things become trendy or retro: everyone wants to put everyone into a box.\n\nJF: There’s stuff about that time that was really great that was happening all across genres. But I guess in a way, when I hear “indie sleaze,” I think of American Apparel, and now when I think of American Apparel, I think of sexual abuse. And I also associate it with Vice magazine, which in the early 2000s was essentially like an alt-right magazine. I think we can see in hindsight that that was not like innocent irony. I think we saw it then, too, but I think that kind of culture of casual sadism, where it’s actually cool to use slurs — I associate that with that era and those disgusting people that we avoided, who hated us also. I mean, it’s not like we were beloved by those people.\n\nJS: I think also it had a lot to do with drugs and alcohol. That was just not the identity of Le Tigre ever. We never drank before a show, but we weren’t straight edge or anything. I only drank when I went to indie sleaze parties is what I’m trying to say.\n\nJF: [laughs] I only drank when I was shopping at American Apparel. I would look at a T-shirt and do a line of coke.\n\nI remember the first time that I saw Le Tigre on the cover of Curve magazine in 2004. I was coming out at the time and I thought, “Wow, I can be cool and a dyke!” [laughs] I went back and re-read that interview and found so much of it centered around your decision to sign with a major label for This Island. Reflecting back on that album, do you recall the press focusing largely on the struggle for fans to accept that move? How much was that part of a press narrative? Was your experience different with feminist or gay press versus mainstream press?\n\nJS: We definitely had questions about that because I think people want to place us in an indie space and also want to pinpoint us as a band that’s preaching to the choir, so it’s like, “What does that mean when you open it up to talking to a larger audience?” I think there were some interesting conversations that stemmed from that question within the band and also in press, but we also had so many questions from more mainstream press about our gender and about what feminism is that we hadn’t really had as much before. Overall, the experience of doing press for that record opened up a whole flood of new kinds of questions that seemed a little bit off-base.\n\nJF: Sometimes it’s hard because of the content of our music and stands we’ve taken on certain things. It’s almost like people want us to be political pundits and have the perfect talking points to present about gay marriage or police brutality or abortion rights. We know about all those things and we have feelings about them, but I don’t feel like the most qualified person to speak about that. There are activists doing really high-level policy work and I really wish they had that space to talk about it and not us.\n\nWe also answered questions like, “Why are you on a major label? What made you want to make this change? What was it like working with Ric Ocasek?” Stuff like that. It’s been elusive to actually talk about our art. I think what we really feel like is artists. JD and I worked together yesterday in the studio getting the show together for the tour, and the kinds of things we think about and talk about are so not the public face of the band. Some of that’s intentional, I guess, because you have a persona, but some of it I wish people could know more about, like how we collaborate and how we think about art.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the process of curating this tour?\n\nJS: We got asked to do the This Ain’t No Picnic show in 2019 with plans to play the festival in 2020, prior to the election, so I think our interest in playing the show stemmed from that relevance. Getting our stuff together for that show was such a crazy process because a lot of the electronics we used on stage are now obsolete, so we had to dig into our hard drives, and the hard drives of other people, and open computers from the 1990s to try to pull stuff off of it and create a piecemeal version of the songs again.\n\nThe relevance became super tangible to us during that process, so we got more and more excited to play and say certain things. This new show is really focused on the video content, [which] is always displaying the lyrics, and I think that that became a really important thing for us: even if you’ve never heard our music, you can still understand what we’re talking about, read the words, and I think that that adds a new relevance. So expect that and outfits. Cool outfits.\n\nJF: We’ve been doing this combination of updating certain things. We’re working on this Pointer Sisters cover that we did on the last record and we’re listening to it and it’s kind of an outlier for us. It’s not totally feeling like us. It was an outlier at the time and 17 years later or whatever, it now just feels kind of alien: how do we make this more reflective of not just who we are, but who we were then?\n\nSome things are really interesting to do exactly the way they were because sitting with it and really being in that double reality moment where you’re like, “What did it mean then? What does it mean now?” Some of it is so powerful to me in ways that I almost didn’t understand when we were doing it; we were too in it to reflect on it. I found that really fun and amazing and rewarding to just be like, “Wow, OK. What were we thinking back then? And who are we?”\n\nSince you've been on hiatus, have you had any moments noticing Le Tigre’s resonance or influence in the world?\n\nJS: I teach at the recording music school at NYU, and so I feel like my students are always grasping for what kind of relevance their professors have. It’s a constant flurry of “You were in that band? Cool!“ So it doesn’t feel as rare I guess for it to come up.\n\nJF: As far as music goes, sometimes people will be like, “You guys were so influential on this or this.” I’m not trying to say we weren’t, but we were part of a group of people, like Wynne [Greenwood] from Tracy + the Plastics and Chicks on Speed, and even M.I.A., who we weren't friends with, but we felt like we were kind of part of this group of women working with electronic music, pushing the bounds of pop and punk and electro. I do hear that in music right now, or I have been hearing that in music. I hear Peaches in a lot of stuff. So I don’t necessarily feel ownership over any of those stylistic things, but we’ve had songs that are big on TikTok and stuff like that. I guess it shocked me that kids would be into “Phanta” of all songs.\n\nThe duo behind the folktronica project Natural Wonder Beauty Concept open up about their debut album.\n\nWill Le Tigre be writing and recording any new music?\n\nJF: I could see doing something with the songs that we reworked for the tour. I could see doing a release of those as singles or something like that. Or maybe even editing some of the video material we ended up using into something cool. But I do think Le Tigre was time-specific. And I don’t know. I don’t want to do it. I’m not ruling out writing music. I could see that being fun or being the right medium for me to work on something. It’s been fun playing guitar and fun relearning the songs, so I don’t think it’s never going to be be a part of my life again, but I don't think it's going to be my main thing.\n\nJS: Teaching music, I have to be immersed in music all day and I feel like it gives me so much inspiration. So I do still make music. I do remixes and I also have a band, Crickets, and I scored a film called 32 Sounds, [which is] an immersive experience. And honestly, it's just been really fun to make music for making music’s sake, and not trying to go out on tour and play huge festivals — be part of that machine.\n\nThis conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nLe Tigre is on tour now through the end of July.\n\nGet the best of what’s queer.
