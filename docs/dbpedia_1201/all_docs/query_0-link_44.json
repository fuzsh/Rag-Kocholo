        "text": "Girls\n\nGirls, the San Francisco duo of Christopher Owens and J R White, arrives with shoulders shrugged, head slightly down. Its debut album, titled “Album” (True Panther Sounds/Matador), is a lean ramble, in no way ostentatious. Knowingly or not, Mr. Owens has the tender brooding of Buddy Holly down cold, with a touch of Elvis Costello’s shakiness in his voice. But “Album” isn’t clean: it’s flayed and ragged and hazy. Like so much of the noise and psychedelia lately infesting the indie-rock underground, underneath the slop lies terrific instincts for clean, artful melody. In that vein “Album” is one of the year’s most bracing pop releases, and one of the best, a devastatingly fresh reframing of the pop songbook. Mr. White lends versatile support on these numbers, which pilfer elementary punk, country-rock and 1950s-vintage shuffles. (A beautiful instrumental with stirring gospel organs is called “Curls.”) But Mr. Owens is the revelation, with deliciously malleable voice and attitude: desperate on “Ghostmouth,” snide on “Lust for Life,” pleading on “Lauren Marie” and on “Hellhole Ratrace, ” just plain old winded. The feelings are complicated but the songs are raw  like templates for others to copy.\n\nMen\n\nJ D Samson was a second-wave addition to the long-on-hiatus feminist dance-punk outfit Le Tigre, helping the group shift from shouty and angular to shouty and smooth. Ms. Samson’s latest project, Men  which includes Michael O’Neill and Ginger Brooks Takahashi, her former band mates in Hirsute  began as a Le Tigre spin-off but has developed into a force in its own right. “Limited Edition Demo” (Men Make Music), the group’s debut EP, is full of dreamy post-disco: “Off Our Backs” recalls “Borderline”-era Madonna, and “Credit Card Babie$” is new wave agitation on the politics of procreation: “Raise our kids/Radical politics/Sontag in the crib.” Ms. Samson sings in a faint, naïve voice, which only makes her tart lyrics more beguiling; over Men’s slick, jaunty arrangements the words land like slaps. The group will spend the fall touring with Gossip, then Peaches. As for Le Tigre, reports this summer had the group working on songs for the coming album from another avatar of complicated feminism: Christina Aguilera.\n\nDarlings\n\n“I saw Brian crowd-surfing on some people/But there was no band at all.” That’s Peter Rynsky, singer of Darlings, at the outset of “Eviction Party,” a splash of lo-fi elegance that, like most Darlings songs, squeezes meaning from the inconsequential. On its winning debut album “Yeah I Know” (Famous Class), this young New York band  Mr. Rynsky, the guitarist Joe Tirabassi, the keyboardist Maura Lynch and the drummer Matt Solomon  plays casually rendered garage-pop that’s masking an arched eyebrow: they’re all working harder than they appear to be. Among the best here is “Friends Forever,” a dry love letter that’s part surf-rock, part musical theater. “I can’t wait to see your skinny legs again,” Mr. Rynsky sings, “because we’re more than friends/and I need you.” During the unprintable chorus, the affair moves from the park to a literal dark room to a metaphorical one. “Don’t make me get down on my knees,” Mr. Rynsky sings, though it sounds like he wouldn’t mind.\n\nBoys Like Girls\n\nThere’s no way Boys Like Girls listened to the final version of their recent single “Love Drunk”  the title track from their second album, on Columbia  and pegged at as anything but a brazen rip-off of the Killers’ “Somebody Told Me.” But then again, as source material goes, that’s a smarter choice than the band’s used in the past. Its self-titled debut was pop-emo at its dimmest, but “Love Drunk” is, in places, a pleasant improvement, with the band’s brattier instincts tamped down. Produced by Brian Howes and the team of S*A*M and Sluggo (the auteurs of arena emo), it’s appealingly diverse. “Two Is Better Than One” is a sharp ballad, and “She’s Got a Boyfriend Now” is surprisingly wistful for a band heretofore resistant to feeling. Most aptly, “Real Thing” and “The Shot Heard Round The World” crib from 1980s power-pop, a genre that, seen through another lens, was emo before emo itself.\n\nBoy Crisis\n\n“Highly licensable” probably isn’t the praise Boy Crisis has been striving for, but there it was, springing from the mouth of Alexandra Patsavas, the music supervisor behind “Gossip Girl” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly. But what could be sold by Boy Crisis, a Brooklyn-via-Wesleyan band (what group isn’t these days?) whose spastically seductive debut album “Tulipomania” (B-Unique), due this month, is teeming with joke-R&B. (Boy Crisis shares a member, Victor Vazquez, with hip-hop ironists du jour Das Racist.) Chromeo got here first, and better, and more sincerely, but Boy Crisis has honed its electro-soul schtick with nods to Prince, hip-hop and literature. Its MySpace page features two video clips for “Dressed to Digress,” one of its sharper songs. In one clip the group stands clustered tight, as if in a Sears portrait studio, and harmonizes glee-club-style. In the other, a young woman swoons over teen-mag tear sheets of the band taped to her walls. Images of Mr. Vazquez festoon her bedsheets. Soon the band members materialize, and at the moment of seduction it becomes clear: if there’s a mumblecore John Hughes making films, this should be the soundtrack."
