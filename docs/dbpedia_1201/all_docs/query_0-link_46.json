        "text": "Dance-punk artists list, with photos, ranked best to worst by votes. List of good dance-punk bands includes a filter so you can sort by the groupsâ€™s label and what albums they've put out. This list of the top dance-punk bands in the world includes all musicians who have released recordings that have gotten distribution, and is an up-to-date list. Dance-punk groups and artists are shown below along with any additional genres in which their music belongs. If available, you can also see information about where all dance-punk bands on this list got started. These are truly the greatest dance-punk bands of all time, since the most famous dance-punk artists ever are listed, and the order is decided by actual fans of the best dance-punk music.\n\nYou can click on the dance-punk band names to see more information about that particular notable dance-punk group. If they're near the top of the best dance-punk artist list, though, then they should have at least some information available. All the top dance-punk bands named on the list also have discographies on their pages if you click on the dance-punk band names themselves.\n\nList is made up of many different artists, including Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Pink. You get to decide which artists make it to the top with your votes. What makes the most sense to vote on, is it between MGMT and LCD Soundsystem?\n\nAll important, significant and iconic names in dance-punk music history deserve your votes, so make sure to choose wisely. You can only vote once on this list.\n\nThe list includes all new dance-punk bands, and if there are any missing on the list, you can always add them yourself. Just make sure they aren't already on the list and check your spelling, because this is already an accurate compilation of the best examples of dance-punk, as well as a good place to start if you're asking yourself, or friends, exactly how to get into dance-punk music. Especially since the bands at the top of the list will at the very least be the best choices if you're looking for a list of good dance-punk bands with which to start out. No point in listening to them if they aren't actually good or even half-way decent dance-punk bands.\n\nThis list answers the questions \"who are the best dance-punk bands of all time?\" and \"who is the greatest dance-punk musician ever?\"\n\nIf you know enough about the genre, please vote based on the quality of the band's music instead of just voting for the most popular dance-punk bands that you might've heard of, but not really listened to closely enough to cast an informed vote.\n\nTweet this or Facebook it to make sure your friends weigh in too. {#nodes}"
