        "text": "Le Tigre (Kathleen Hanna, JD Samson, and Johanna Fateman) have reunited and will bring their joyous, experimental post-riot grrrl antics and conceptual multimedia performance to stages across the world later this year. The band’s last gig was on September 24, 2005, at the Operation Ceasefire concert at Washington Monument in Washington DC, where they joined a coalition of artists calling for an end to the U.S. war in Iraq.\n\nThe band formed in New York City in 1999 and decided to abandon traditional punk instrumentation. Instead they paired drum-machine beats and looped 8-bit samples with the simplest, serrated guitar riffs and call-and-response vocals. Though rage had its place in Le Tigre, the band, became known for celebratory songs such as “Hot Topic”—a shout-out to queer and feminist artistic inspirations (from David Wojnarowicz and Lorraine O’Grady to Catherine Opie and Vaginal Davis.)\n\nLe Tigre have a shared a vision for multimedia performance, touring with a slide projector in their early days with video later becoming a key component of their live show which fans can still look forward to on the upcoming tour.\n\nHanna, who has been touring with Bikini Kill will be heading down under shortly to play a number of sold out shows across Australia.\n\nPhoto Credit: Leeta Harding"
