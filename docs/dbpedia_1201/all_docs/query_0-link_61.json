        "text": "We’ve already shared our Albums & EPs Of 2023, Tracks Of 2023 and our final Soho Radio show of the year, but now the GIHE team have put together a round up of some of their music related highlights from the past twelve months.\n\nFrom the eclectic and brilliant lineups that Mari organised for our monthly GIHE gigs at The Shacklewell Arms and Sebright Arms, to the monthly Soho Radio shows that Kate & Tash produced and hosted; the GIHE team were grateful to feel connected – either through the internet or in real life – to our friends and followers, and that’s something our Personal Highlights of 2023 reflect.\n\nRead below for a recap of some of our best bits of the year. Huge thanks to everyone who has supported GIHE. We’ll see you in 2024. x\n\nGIHE Live with STRAIGHT GIRL at The Shacklewell Arms\n\nWhilst I truly love all the gigs I host, and am so grateful to all the amazing bands who play for us, the lovely venues, and everyone who makes it out, there are sometimes gigs that do stand out as particularly memorable. This year, one such gig was when Leeds based artist STRAIGHT GIRL came to headline for us in July. With their immense swirling energy and magnetic tongue-in-cheek charisma, they spread all the fizzing queer joy we could ever desire; immersing themselves within the crowd (quite literally at times!), they created a wonderfully unifying exuberant euphoria. And, with support from the fierce raging power of band-on-the-rise, sister duo ALT BLK ERA, and the gritty, immersive allure of The Dead Zoo, it was a night we won’t be forgetting in a hurry. We were also able to raise money for vital charity London Trans Pride.\n\nThanks again to all the incredible bands who’ve played at our gigs this year, putting on these events is my most favourite thing to do and you always make it so worth it. Thanks too, in particular, to The Shacklewell Arms, where we’ve been lucky enough to host most of the gigs. A really lovely team of chilled out folk (including some of the best sound engineers like the legendary Sofia!) who seem dedicated to creating a safe, inclusive space.\n\n(Mari Lane – GIHE Co-Founder)\n\n(Photo Credit: Cassie Barnard)\n\nGIHE Live with Problems Patterns at Sebright Arms\n\nThis year has been a pretty special one for Belfast punks Problem Patterns, with the release of their highly acclaimed album, Blouse Club, via Alcopop! Records (one of our albums of the year!) supporting total legends Le Tigre in Glasgow, and doing live sessions for the likes of Deb Grant and Tom Ravenscroft on BBC 6Music. So it was an extra special honour to have them return to play live for us again, following their headline set at Shacklewell Arms back in 2021. This time, they headed up a line-up of total dreams, with support from Fightmilk and Dogviolet, selling out Sebright Arms. As expected, they completely blew us away with their immense raw power and wonderful unique charisma; it’s always a fantastic experience seeing them live, and it’s particularly lovely to see a band who not only deliver stark political messages, but do so with a vibrant energy, their endearing closeness as friends and sparkling wit shining throughout.\n\nIt was also a real treat to have long-time faves Fightmilk deliver the most fun-filled set of sing-along punk-pop anthems new and old, whilst band-on-the-rise Dogviolet exuded a spellbinding majesty opening the night. An evening of all the best vibes, I seemed to switch between grinning from cheek-to-cheek and crying tears of joy throughout, and just feel so grateful to have hosted such a special event. As with all our gigs, we were also collecting donations for charity on the door, and this time managed to raise money for vital organisation Rainbow Migration.

We spoke about the evolution of and lasting influence of Riot Grrrl culture, and how it’s been a gateway movement and sound for so many young women and non-binary folk into creating music today. Hope won an award for her hard work, and I’m not surprised. Featuring great contributions from GRRRL Music, Where Are The Girlbands?, Mia Hughes, Rachel Roberts, Venus Grrrls, Katja Macabre, Delilah Bon, Bambie Thug, Television Screams and Skint Knees; it’s well worth a listen. Link here.\n\n(Kate Crudgington – GIHE Co-Founder)\n\nGIHE Great Escape Special show with SPIDER on Soho Radio\n\nWe usually cover The Great Escape on GIHE, but this year, we dedicated our entire May Soho Radio show to artists who we were most looking forward to seeing live across multiple venues at the three day festival in Brighton. The playlist included tracks from JFDR, Seraphina Simone, Delilah Holliday, HotWax, Coach Party, Problem Patterns, ARXX, CLT DRP, Whitelands, Human Interest and more.\n\nIt was a privilege to have Dublin-born, London-based alt-pop artist SPIDER join us in the studio for a chat about her upcoming performance at the festival. She was such a vibrant and charismatic force and we really enjoyed chatting to her about her EP, HELL OR HIGH WATER, and listening to the challenges she has faced as a young, female artist of colour sharing her music on the internet, and how it’s made her more determined to make her mark in alternative music scenes.\n\nListen back to the show here. Read our overall review of The Great Escape here. (KC)\n\nDeershed Festival\n\nWith Deer Shed festival included in this list after I’d been for the first time last year, I’m afraid I’m a creature of habit and can’t not include it here again after having the opportunity to go this summer. Promoting a real family focus, whilst hosting an incredible range of exciting new artists, it oozes the warmest of vibes and – being smaller in size than most other festivals – creates a space that feels comfortingly intimate; an inclusive safe haven for artists and fans of all genres and ages. This year, I had another dreamy time. Whilst Friday evening was brought to a close by the joyous, empowering energy of Dream Wife (with GIHE fave Straight Girl even making an appearance!), on Saturday highlights included the riotous power and playful allure of Panic Shack, the compelling fierce energy of Sprints and the blissful groove of All Day Breakfast Cafe. And, on Sunday, I fell in love with Pet Snake, immersed myself in the cutting post-punk power of English Teacher and cried my way through the searing twinkling emotion of The Big Moon. Despite the rain, another beautiful weekend at Deer Shed, which I hope to replicate for a third time next year (with CMAT and The Go! Team on the line-up, I’m sure it won’t disappoint!) (ML)\n\nGIHE x Morning Glory Live Takeover on Soho Radio with NYX\n\nIt was so much fun covering Soho Radio’s Morning Glory show in September, presenting live from the studio! Tash and I had a blast playing tracks from some of our GIHE “spotlight” artists, and Tash had a chat with Glasgow newcomer Litty, who fronts indie band Brenda. In the second half of the show, we were joined in the studio by Alicia and Philippa from the NYX electronic drone choir. We spoke to them about their collaborative album with Gazelle Twin, Deep England, their contribution to the Diablo IV video game soundtrack, and the instinctive ways in which they use technology to enhance the power of the human voice. We also set some time aside to fangirl over afromerm/CIL too, who has recently joined their ranks. I’ve been following NYX’s work for a long time, so it was a privilege to be able to have them as guests on our show.\n\nListen back to the show in full here. (KC)\n\nLe Tigre Live at The Troxy\n\nHaving been lucky enough to previously catch Bikini Kill and The Julie Ruin live over the last few years, I didn’t think there’d be another opportunity for me to see Kathleen Hanna live, but I’m extremely pleased to have been wrong. The holy trinity of inspirational bands was completed for me when I got to see Le Tigre live in June, along with GIHE pals Tash, Kate and Paul, and it was just as wonderful as expected. Anyone who knows me will know how much Kathleen means to me, and it felt extra special to see Le Tigre; you could say they were my ‘gateway’ into all things riot grrrl. I have so many memories of being a teen, and dancing to ‘Deceptacon’ at the local indie night, which then lead to me discovering Kathleen Hanna’s other work. Since then, their music has continued to soothe and motivate with its cathartic joy, their fizzing politically-charged energy often being a lifeline for me. And yes, many tears were shed seeing ‘Keep On Livin’ live. (ML)\n\nLingua Ignota Live at Islington Assembly Hall\n\nWitnessing one of Lingua Ignota’s final UK shows under her old moniker was a truly breathtaking experience. I’ve been privileged to see her live in London three times before, but this performance felt like unlike any other. Sat at her piano, clothed in a red mesh dress, she performed songs from her impressive back catalogue, unleashing her immense, dynamic vocals on to a crowd of devoutly silent listeners. Truly one of the most intense shows I have ever attended. Lingua Ignota may be “dead”, but long live Reverend Kristin Michael Hayter, who has risen from the ashes and become an entity all of her own. You can listen to a live recording of Lingua Ignota’s final performance via bandcamp here. You can also listen to Reverend Kristin Michael Hayter’s debut album, SAVED!, here. (KC)\n\nYAKKIE Live at The Victoria, Dalston\n\nIt’s hard to pin-point much ‘good’ news to have come from 2023, but one thing that was undeniably great to happen was the formation of brand new super group YAKKIE. Fronted by interminable force of nature Janey, plus phenomenal musicians Robin (Petrol Girls, Personal Best), and Ankles and Jodie (both of Colour Me Wednesday), it’s been amazing to see this absolute epic collective of faves come together in all their punk-rock glory for this special project. It was a real honour to be at The Victoria for their first ever proper gig this autumn; a truly empowering night of rage, joy and unity. And it really was particularly wonderful to see Janey back on stage, in her element; she really does have a sparkling charisma and immense presence that is unlike anyone else I’ve ever seen. So, thank you YAKKIE for coming into existence just when we needed you the most; at the moment, it’s more important than ever to have bands like them, not afraid to speak up for what’s right and use their platform as a real force for change. (ML)\n\nHuge thanks to the bands and artists who have played live for GIHE, been a guest on our Soho Radio shows. Huge love to everyone who has listened in, read our reviews or attended one of our gigs this year. Take care of yourselves and we’ll see you all in 2024. x\n\nSince they shared their debut single ‘Big Shouty‘ with us back in 2020, Problem Patterns have been lighting up our musical radar with their relatable, riotous anthems. The Belfast-based DIY punks have progressed from making music together as a hobby, to becoming a personal favourite of Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna, winning a Northern Irish Music prize, and supporting the likes of Le Tigre and Dream Wife on tour. These accomplishments are the product of sheer determination, authentic friendship and a shared defiance in the face of adversity.\n\nOn their debut album Blouse Club, Alanah Smith, Bethany Crooks, Beverley Boal and Ciara King use their collective talents to rage against misogyny, classism and homophobia in both societal and industry spheres. Not defined by traditional band structures, Problem Patterns routinely switch up instruments and mic duties for their songs, which makes for a refreshing take on the subject they’re tackling. This collective instinct, raw emotion and radical resilience permeates each of the twelve tracks on their debut full length record.\n\nPowerful opener ‘Y.A.W‘ – an acronym for ‘Yes All Women’, antagonising the social media hashtag ‘Not All Men’ – is a visceral rumination on the universal rage and despair that permeates our consciousness in the wake of public violence towards women, in particular, the misogynist killings of Sarah Everard and Aisling Murphy. It’s a vehement, necessary anthem for women and girls who have spoken out against violent misogyny only to be told they’re “just a bitch who can’t take a joke”.\n\nAs Alanah demands “Who do we call for help? / When the help seems like a threat to me?” her bandmates create a cathartic cacophony of relentless sound around her. ‘Y.A.W’ is such a direct moment of unleashed anguish that it sets the precedent perfectly for everything that follows on Blouse Club. The aptly titled ‘Big Shouty’ is based on the band’s own personal experiences of sexist bullshit, with each verse tackling some of the comments they’ve received during their time together. Problem Patterns’ ability to recycle this rage into hard-hitting, but hugely enjoyable anthems is what makes Blouse Club so compelling.\n\nWhether it’s Bev gleefully chanting “When the people are hungry / they’ll eat the rich!” on ‘Advertising Services’, Ciara screaming through the chorus on ‘A History Of Bad Men Part II’, or Alanah acknowledging the burnout that comes with chronic illness on ‘Picture Of Health’ (“I will never be the picture of health / I just wanna be better to my self!”) there’s always a palpable sense of relief when Problem Patterns unpack these unfiltered feelings and frustrations. Drummer Beth undoubtedly feels this in every cell of her body when she steps up to the mic to perform the excellently named ‘Lesbo 3000’. She directly calls out the homophobia experienced by queer women, with her extended screams of “Call me a Dyke!” making for a bold and empowering moment of reclamation.\n\nThe band serve listeners another vital dose of this empowerment on the seminal ‘TERFs Out’. Alanah rightfully highlights that “LGB is nothing if not for the T!”, as they tackle transphobic attitudes. The track reiterates all that Problem Patterns stand for and provides a vital statement of support for their trans friends and fans in the process. The anthemic ‘Letter Of Resignation’ flows in a similarly cathartic vein, as Bev steps forward to celebrate queer ally-ship and tear down those who discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, specifically in places of employment. “I’m standing up for who I believe in / you can’t fire me, I’m leaving!” she chants in playful defiance, surrounded by riotous riffs and marching beats.\n\nOn ‘Pity Bra‘ (which GIHE premiered ahead of the album’s official release!), Alanah tells the story of an important night that Problem Patterns spent watching Sleater-Kinney back in 2020, that strengthened the creative foundations of the band. It serves as an interlude on Blouse Club, but it’s transient moments like this that accurately reflect the importance of nurturing platonic bonds, as they can be just as passionate and fulfilling as other relationships.\n\nThe band provide further aural antidotes and release more pent up frustrations on ‘Who Do We Not Save?’ and ‘Poverty Tourist’. The latter calls out the appropriation of working class culture in the music industry, whilst the former takes aim at the incompetent Tory government and their continued attempts to privatise the NHS. Both are bursting with the group’s trademark empathy, anger and wit, helping to offset the anxiety of the uncertain times we’re currently living through.\n\nNamed after the unofficial speakeasies that were frequented by women in the wake of World War II when they were denied the right to drink in public bars, Blouse Club is the musical manifesto of four friends whose sound refuses to remain underground. Together, Problem Patterns use their collective talents to create riotous feminist punk anthems that provide comfort and catharsis in equal measure, and their debut album is a powerhouse example of these undeniable skills.\n\nFollow Problem Patterns on bandcamp, Spotify, Twitter (X), Instagram & Facebook\n\nPhoto Credit: Carrie Davenport\n\nKate Crudgington\n\n@KCBobCut\n\nGIHE favourites Problem Patterns have returned with a double dose of delightful, disruptive noise on their AA single release ‘Lesbo 3000’ / ‘Poverty Tourist’. Taken from their upcoming debut album, Blouse Club, which is due on 27th October via Alcopop! Records, the Belfast-based Riot Grrrls tackle homophobia and working class appropriation on their anthemic new tracks. We can’t wait to hear both of them live when the band headline for us at the Sebright Arms in Hackney on 17th November (tickets are cheaper in advance and available from DICE).\n\nNot defined by traditional band structures, Problem Patterns routinely switch up instruments and mic duties for their riotous songs, which always makes for a refreshing take on the subject they’re singing about. Following on from previous single ‘Letter of Resignation’, which saw guitarist Beverley Boal step forward on vocals, on ‘Lesbo 3000’ drummer Bethany Crooks takes the lead as she calls out the prejudices around homophobic language and reclaims it for herself and the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n“‘Lesbo 3000’ was written partly out of frustration and also to reclaim and have ownership over my sexuality,” explains Bethany. “The frustration is that lesbianism is consistently invalidated, we’re told that we just haven’t ‘met the right man’ yet or that some random man in a bar has a magic appendage in his trousers that will completely negate your attraction to women. The reality is that homophobic attacks are becoming more and more consistent with right wing social media emboldening bigots, while ‘lesbian’ remains one of the top search topics on all porn websites. (Mostly) men think that lesbians exist for their sexual gratification, but if they see two women holding hands they go absolutely berserk.”\n\n“I also thought it was important to reclaim the slur ‘dyke’,” she continues. “I’ve been called a dyke multiple times by homophobes who want to hurt me, but if I can reclaim that word it completely takes the power out of it. Yes I am a dyke. And that feels really powerful to say.” With the aid of some truly stunning local drag artists in the accompanying video for ‘Lesbo 3000’, Bethany and the grrrls gleefully dismantle these damaging prejudices and riotously reclaim the language that doesn’t belong on the tongues of ignorant bigots.\n\n“We really wanted it to feel joyful and silly even though the song has quite a serious subject matter,” Bethany comments on the visuals, which were directed by long-time collaborator Brendan Seamus. “We decorated the set like a big gay party! We toyed for months with the idea of paying homage to ‘Addicted To Love’ and ‘Man I Feel Like A Woman’, and thought that involving local drag artists would be a perfect tonic to the constant depressing news cycles surrounding LGBTQ+ attacks and discrimination we see nowadays. Carl Hartt, Hester Ectomy, Xxxpresso Martini and FRUITY were the backing band and they all absolutely killed it. We are so grateful that they even wanted to participate in the video, and they really served 80s hair metal/bimbo/sexy punk realness.”\n\nProblem Patterns are driven by a strong DIY ethos and as a working class band, they feel it’s important to call out the appropriation of this culture in the music industry and further afield. Their second AA-side track ‘Poverty Tourist’ does just that. Fuelled by the riotous dual vocals of Alanah Smith and Ciara King, as well as King’s potent bass line, the track is a Beastie Boys-style blast of pure punk catharsis that came about during the band’s final writing session before they recorded their album.\n\n“We’re a working class band and there are experiences that are very unique to us which we have bonded over,” Alanah explains about the track. “It’s incredibly frustrating to see those struggles co-opted by folks who have never had to worry about money. The kind of people who will dig around charity shops to ‘curate’ bits for their Etsy store where they will sell these items at 10x the price. Charity shops exist to serve the community and there are people that depend on them because there are no other options. It’s the rich kids moving into impoverished areas to make themselves sound more interesting, driving up the rent and gentrifying the area.”\n\n“This sort of romanticisation of the poor is very prevalent in the music scene, especially in bands (and industry types) who align a working class background with being perceived as more authentic. People dress up and change their accent for personal gain only, but as Jarvis Cocker once said, ‘If you called your dad he could stop this all’ – and of course, he also said, ‘Everybody hates a tourist.’ It’s cosplay, it’s gross, and it’s always obvious when someone is doing this.”\n\nFresh from performing live on BBC 6Music, supporting electro-punk icons Le Tigre on their Manchester and Glasgow tour dates and playing a knockout set at Brighton’s Great Escape festival earlier this year, it’s been a joy to witness Problem Patterns’ hard work pay off. Listen to ‘Poverty Tourist’ below and pre-order your copy of their debut album, Blouse Club, here.\n\nFollow Problem Patterns on bandcamp, Spotify, Twitter, Instagram & Facebook\n\nPhoto Credit: Carrie Davenport\n\nKate Crudgington\n\n@KCBobCut"
