        "text": "This post has been updated.\n\nOakland rock festival Mosswood Meltdown has announced the full lineup for its 2023 event.\n\nSet for 4th of July weekend, the festival will feature feminist electronic punk band Le Tigre, the first show in 20 years of groundbreaking riot grrrl group Bratmobile, “Supersonic” hitmakers J.J. Fad, proto-hip-hop New York group ESG, a reunion of the Oakland queercore group Gravy Train!!!!, Tina & the Total Babes, the Avengers, the Rondelles, Mika Miko, Quintron & Miss Pussycat and more.\n\nFormerly known as Burger Boogaloo, the festival underwent a rebranding during the pandemic and emerged this past summer for the first time since 2019. In July, the festival bridged together generations of rock musicians, allowing newcomers like the Linda Lindas to share a stage with longtime performers like Bikini Kill.\n\nFor its upcoming festival, Mosswood will see the renaissance of musical acts that made splashes in the early 2000s punk scene, including the angsty bubblegum power-pop group Tina & The Total Babes. And a certain generation of local punks will be very excited about the return of Gravy Train!!!! Featuring Bay Area multi-hyphenate Brontez Purnell, the band made a name in the aughts with funny, raunchy, overtly queer lyrics and wildly entertaining live shows.\n\nIn a sea of corporate music festivals, Mosswood remains a refuge for punk and rockabilly lovers who prefer a DIY spirit and in-your-face music and expression. Once again, the festival will be hosted by filmmaking icon John Waters at Mosswood Park.\n\nFull lineup:\n\nLe Tigre\n\nBratmobile\n\nGravy Train!!!!\n\nMika Miko\n\nESG\n\nTina & The Total Babes\n\nThe Rondelles\n\nJ.J. Fad\n\nQuintron & Ms. Pussycat\n\nThe Avengers\n\nSnooper\n\nBrower\n\nMorgan & the Organ Donors\n\nMemo P.S.T\n\nCumgirl8\n\nWarp\n\nMosswood Meltdown takes place Saturday, July 1 to Sunday, July 2, 2023 at Mosswood Park in Oakland.
