        "text": "With the release of “Scared for the Climate“, the independent artist, Love, Builder of Worlds, delivered an electrifying DIY alt-rock anthem that captures the essence of punk rebellion with the precision of a seasoned artist.\n\nThe single encapsulates a raw, urgent message wrapped in the infectious energy of funk-drenched synth punk—a stylistic nod to the dance-punk vibes reminiscent of Kathleen Hanna’s work in Le Tigre. The track’s short, snappy runtime is no barrier to its impact; instead, it enhances its punchy, protest-driven ethos. The lyrics hit hard and fast, their pseudo-hip-hop delivery layering a sense of immediacy over the compelling synth rhythms. The result is a powerful musical manifesto that does more than just sound an alarm—it’s a public safety announcement for the planet.\n\nLove’s unique artistic background, as part of the Olólúfè Collective, infuses their work with a profound understanding of intersectional struggles. They navigate through genres—from punk rock to afrobeat—with the ease of a genre-defying originator, underscoring their commitment to challenging colonial binary frameworks through music.\n\nScared for the Climate is a fiery call to awareness, urging listeners to confront one of the most pressing existential threats of our time. Through this track, Love, Builder of Worlds, doesn’t merely aim to entertain but to galvanise action, making it a quintessential listen for those attuned to the pressing issues of our era and the potent power of music as a form of resistance.\n\nScared for the Climate is due for release on May 5th; stream the single on Bandcamp, SoundCloud and Apple Music.\n\nReview by Amelia Vandergast\n\nIf you never got over the disbanding of the Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, wipe your tears with the kinetic rhythms in the seminal single from the Welsh dance-punk duo, Bag of Cats.\n\nDevil at My Houseparty, featuring Will Griff, is a mind-mashing blend of psych, garage rock and proto-punk, all pulled together by punk-pierced guitar loops and alt-electronica synthetics that augment the anthemic track to the nines.\n\nBetween the rolling rhythms, distorted blues riffs, and caustically infectious electronic elements inspired by the likes of LCD Soundsystem and Jamie T, Devil at My Houseparty is a firestorm of twisted genre contortions that will make your pulse pound and get the adrenaline flowing.\n\nThe magnetic appeal of the duo comprising Sophie Holliday and Barney Williams doesn’t end there; lyrically and vocally, Bag of Cats, couldn’t be more ensnaring. They’ve perfected the formula of playfully roguish swagger. The mischievously jocular vibe is definitively rock n roll, just not rock n roll as you’ve known it before.\n\nIn the process of giving the Welsh music scene more than it bargained for, Bag of Cats has garnered a staunch fanbase which only seems to grow with every release and livewire performance.\n\nDevil at My Houseparty is now available to stream via Spotify.\n\nReview by Amelia Vandergast\n\n‘all the world is crazy’ is ironically a sentiment that no one of sane mind could disagree with. When Sarah Sunday used it as the proclamation in her latest hyper pop-punk anthem, she made it impossible for her audience not to get down with the endemic of cognitive sickness.\n\nThe future-pop elements around the pop-punk guitar-driven hooks created the EDM evolution that the genre has never known it needed but has silently been crying out for. If any track has what it takes to make the masses shake off the depressing presumption that they’re outliers for feeling suffocated by entropy, it’s the anthemically sticky-sweet triumph.\n\nHer uplifting vocal energy augmenting the lyrics, which cut right to the core of the madness we’ve tried to put our heads in the sand and ignore, ensured all the world is crazy is one of the most seminal anthems of the summer. We utterly adore her.\n\nall the world is crazy was officially released on the 1st of May; stream the aptly zany official music video via YouTube.\n\nReview by Amelia Vandergast"
