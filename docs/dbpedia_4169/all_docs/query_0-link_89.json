        "text": "The purity of the songs written and sung by Trinity Seely are a deep-rooted reflection of the ranching lifestyle she lives and loves. Trinity Seely's life has taken her to many different places. Ranging from the Chilcotin of British Columbia, where she grew up. Her family has gone from the Handcart Ranch in Wyoming, to the Sandhills of Nebraska, onto the mountains in Cascade, Montana and now to California, where she, her husband and kids live and work on a Boys Ranch. Her honest lyrics touch the heart...Trinity's personal look into the life of a ranch wife gives her a deep perspective and appreciation into a lifestyle that some say is a bygone era. Trinity released her debut album back in December of 2011. Produced by fellow western artist, Brenn Hill and Ryan Tilby. Trinity's self titled CD has received multiple outstanding reviews. These reviews include write ups in the Western Horseman, Ranch and Reata, Cowgirls in Style, Working Ranch Magazine and True West. She was named one of True West's favorite western artist for 2012.

Trinity Seely embraces the oral traditions of the cowboy life and offers a musical window into her life as a cowgirl and ranch wife.\" -Jennifer Denison\n\n​Trinity Shares with us in \"He Rides for the Brand\" what it is about the cowboy life that gets us by the heartstrings so we never want to leave. And as one of her fans stated, \"A lot of people sing from the heart, Trinity sings \"With her heart.\" ​\"Her style of music is a blend of Western, Folk and traditional Country. her voice and songs are reminiscent of the timeless Suzy Boggus, especially in \"A Cowboy Song\"-Jennifer Denison\n\n​Rick Huff with the Western Way stated, \"Trinity grew up in the genuine western life and tradition, so she knows whereof she sings....and writes...and does both very well.\" Trinity's Website\n\n​"
