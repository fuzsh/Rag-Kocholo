        "text": "Q-and-A with Riders In The Sky musician Ranger Doug\n\nRiders In The Sky is returning to the Don Gibson Theatre, sharing humor and musicianship “The Cowboy Way.”\n\nThe show introduces the audience to Ranger Doug, a guitarist and yodeler who sings baritone and lead; Too Slim, the upright bass player with sharp wit and a necktie resembling a cactus; Joey The Cowpolka King who plays his “Stomach Steinway” to delight listeners; and Woody Paul, who sings tenor and lead and also plays fiddle.\n\nFans of the movie “Toy Story 2” will recognize their music from the album. The album and also song “Woody’s Round Up” won the group their first Grammy Award in 2001 for Best Musical Album for Children. They won another Grammy in the same category for “Monsters Inc. – Scream Factory Favorites,” a companion CD to Pixar’s movie.\n\nRiders In The Sky performs at 8 p.m. 8 p.m. Friday, Aug. 16 at the Don Gibson Theatre, 318 S. Washington St., Shelby. Tickets cost $32.50 for adults and $15 for children, available at DonGibsonTheater.com, by calling 704-487-8114 or visiting the box office.\n\nHere’s a Q-and-A with Ranger Doug about the group’s history and entertaining the fans:\n\nQ: How long have you been able to yodel?\n\nA: “I have no recollection of not being able to. I just worked on it, developed it, practice. Like you have to with any instrument. I’ve always done it since I was a kid.”\n\nQ: What do audiences think when you yodel?\n\nA: “It’s the kind of thing that makes you smile. You don’t want to hear it every song but when you do hear it, it just makes you light up.\"\n\nQ: What makes Riders In The Sky unique?\n\nA: “I think it’s unique in that it combines so much humor with a love of traditional western music.”\n\nQ: What’s your idea of a perfect audience?\n\nA: “One that encompasses all age ranges. We find that we have our grandpas there enjoying the music from when he was young, moms there enjoying the laughter, and kids are loving the western music they’re being introduced to and cowboys and having fun.”\n\nQ: Do you all write your own comedy material or just wing it?\n\nA: “Well, both. The skits develop out of the things that happen, ad lib on stage.”\n\nQ: Is there a secret to success in the music business?\n\nA: “We have to be first, best or different. I think we sort of fall into the different category.\"\n\nQ: What can the audience expect when you perform at the Don Gibson Theatre?\n\nA: “They can expect a show with kind of like Sons of the Pioneers meets Monty Python. It’s a show that’s a lot of fun. It celebrates the beauty of the West. A lot of fun.”\n\nQ: What do you enjoy most about performing live?\n\nA: “Just seeing the reaction of the people, seeing the delight on peoples’ faces. Letting them take an hour of their cares of overdue mortgages and surly teenagers and come have some fun with it.”\n\nQ: What’s the most challenging aspect of being on the road?\n\nA: “Well, of course, time away from family is probably the hardest thing. Secondarily, it’s a grind. We are grinding home from a 28-hour drive from Durango, Colorado to get home. That just wears you down a little bit. We love what we do and we love getting out there and doing it.”\n\nWhat’s your relationship like with the fans?\n\n“Oh, very close. We come out after every show. We feel like it’s part of the whole deal, to come out and sign autographs and talk with people. We have a very close relationship with our fans. We’re not an aloof bunch of people, I can tell you that.”\n\nQ: Why is it important to meet the fans?\n\nA: “We feel it’s part of the job, as much as entertaining on the stage, is interacting after the show as well.”\n\nYou can reach Wade Allen at 704-669-3331 and follow him on Twitter @wadeallenstar."
