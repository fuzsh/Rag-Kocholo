        "text": "If you're gonna be a dreamer, you better be a doer. -Marty Brown\n\nIt's been five years since country music legend George Strait has released a new album. His last, Honky Tonk Time Machine, was released back in 2019. Well, George fans are pumped because country's reigning king just dropped news that his 35th studio album- Cowboys and Dreamers- is on the way!\n\nGeorge recently kicked off his 2024 tour, which includes ten stadium shows sprinkled throughout the U.S.. His first show was in Indianapolis over the weekend. By the way, Chris Stapleton and Little Big Town joined him at the kickoff. That's where George surprised the 50,000+ fans in attendance with the exciting news about his brand new album.\n\nDuring his set, George performed 32 songs. Three of them appear to be from that upcoming album. In Indy, he gave fans a sneak preview.\n\nHere they are!\n\nTHREE DRINKS BEHIND\n\nGOING MIA\n\nHONKY TONK HALL OF FAME\n\nWhile there's no release date set for George's new album, there's some additional news about the project from Maceo, Kentucky native Marty Brown. The singer/songwriter, who penned the biggest hit of his own songwriting career- \"I'm From the Country\" for Tracy Byrd, has landed a cut on George's album. He's been trying for twenty years to get George to record one of his songs and that patience and persistence paid off.\n\nThis news has been brewing for a while. I ran into Marty in downtown Owensboro last summer and he told me that he was about to have big some news. He told me that a country music giant was about to cut a song of his. Well, Marty's prediction happened and we're about to get to hear it.\n\nWhile Marty can't spill all the beans about the song he wrote for George, he did share this on social media:\n\nGeorge Strait is having a media fire storm after announcing the coming of his 2024 album soon. Marty Brown has an original song on it and is proud of all his other songwriting friends who made it on there too!!! Here we Go!!!!!\n\nMarty adds, \"I thought going into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame was my swan song, but this George Strait song is!\"\n\nWhile George and Marty fans wait to hear the song, Marty has a bunch of tour stops planned here in southern Indiana and western Kentucky. Tonight (May 8th), he's playing at Feinstein's in Carmel, Indiana. Saturday, June 1st, he's playing at Lock and Keel in Tell City, Indiana. Friday, July 19th, he's playing at the Spencer County, Indiana Music Festival in Rockport. Then, Saturday, August 10th, he's playing at the Hopkins County Fair near Madisonville, Kentucky."
