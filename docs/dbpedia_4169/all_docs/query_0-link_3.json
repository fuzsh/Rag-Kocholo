The people in their songs find themselves invigorated at the ends of their days, having achieved true fulfillment. They've got purpose. They've got decently warm coffee in their tin cups and they've got their trusty saddle horses between their legs. They might be wearing stiffened with sweat clothes. They may have a stink about them, but they're happy to be with their buddies, driving cattle across the plains or tying their horses up outside the saloon for what's always a happy hour. Their songs - some of the most famous of which have been prominently featured in Pixar's \"Toy Story\" franchise -- are filled with notions of that camaraderie amongst cowboy friends, of living off the land, a soft breeze for a babe and needing very little other another day just like the one recently completed, where everything felt right and good.\n\n$20.00\n\nHome On The Range\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nRiders In The Sky collaborate with iconic Western actor Wilford Brimley in what critics are calling \"an American classic.\" Twelve songs hand-picked by Wilford, reflecting his love of cowboy music, jazz, and vintage popular song.\n\n$15.00\n\nRanger Doug Sings... Songs of the Frontier\n\nRanger Doug\n\nRanger Doug steps out to sing a few of the ballads he has collected in his long career, ably supported by fellow Riders In The Sky; story songs, folk songs, sentimental songs, and songs of the trail and the wagon train.\n\n$15.00\n\nSay No More It's Freddy LaBour\n\nFreddy Labour\n\nToo Slim's wacky solo CD under the obviously fake show business name of Freddy LaBour. Fans of the Riders' bass plucker's humor and skewed vision will share Baxter Black's assessment: \"Freddy, there aren't many people who can write funny stuff. You're one of 'em.\" Original folk music for original people.\n\nAmericaâs Favorite Cowboy Songs\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nRelease Date: September 1, 2012\n\nLabel: Cracker Barrel\n\nBack in the Saddle Again\n\nCool Water\n\nI Ride An Old Paint\n\nRed River Valley\n\nBuffalo Gals / Bear Creek Hop\n\nStreets of Laredo\n\nHow Does He Yodel?\n\nTumbling Tumbleweeds\n\nHome ON the Range\n\nThe Old Chisholm Trail\n\nThe Strawberry Roan\n\n(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\n\nWoody's RoundupÂ\n\nÂ\n\n$20.00\n\nLand Beyond the Sun\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\n$20.00\n\n\"Lassoed Live\" at the Schermerhorn with the Nashville Symphony\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nHighlights of Riders' three night stand with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, ably led by Assistant Conductor Kelly Corcoran.

In the wake of the film's success, Disneyland launched an immensely popular variety show spinoff featuring some of the music on Woody's Original Roundup. Subtitled A Rootin'-Tootin' Collection of Woody's Favorite Songs, this imaginary soundtrack to a fictional TV show is spiritedly played by cowboy band Riders in the Sky. The songs are compact ditties that kids will fall in love with--especially the title track, the darling \"Jessie, the Yodelin' Cowgirl,\" and the hit \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" Without much fanfare, this hoedown has leapt to the front of the pack as one of the year's best children's music releases. --Andrew Bartlett for Amazon\n\nGreat Big Western Howdy!\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nA Great Big Western Howdy! is a studio recording released by the Western band Riders in the Sky in 1998.\n\nYodel the Cowboy Way\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nYodel the Cowboy Way is a compilation recording released by the Western band Riders in the Sky on January 13, 1998.\n\nSongs of The Sage\n\nRanger Doug\n\nRelease Date: March 14, 1997\n\nLabel: Warner Bros.\n\nPublic Cowboy #1: The Music of Gene Autry\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nPublic Cowboy #1 is a studio recording released on CD by the Western band Riders in the Sky on October 22, 1996.\n\nCowboy Songs\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nCowboy Songs is a compilation recording released by the Western band Riders in the Sky in 1996.\n\nCowboys in Love\n\nRiders In The Sky\n\nCowboys in Love is a studio recording released by the Western band Riders in the Sky, released in 1994.
