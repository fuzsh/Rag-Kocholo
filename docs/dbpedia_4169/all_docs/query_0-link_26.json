        "text": "Wylie Gustafson is an American original. The native Montanan singer/songwriter has recorded 24 albums backed by over 3 decades of performing around the world. He remains distinct in country music as one of the few authentic voices of the genre. Wylie’s muse is the empty sprawl of his native Montana home where he crafts the words and music that reflect his life on the 4th generation family ranch.\n\nFor over the last 33 years, he and his band, The Wild West, have performed their refreshing blend of cowboy, western, and traditional country. They are hugely popular on the festival and theatre circuit. Stateside, they have performed at such prestigious venues as the National Folk Festival, MerleFest, the Bumbershoot Festival, The Stagecoach Festival, A Prairie Home Companion, The Conan O’Brien Show and the Grand Ole Opry (with over 50 guest appearances). Worldwide, their universal appeal has taken them to China, Russia, Australia, Europe, South America, and Japan. As one critic called him, “The coolest cowpoke around. Forget everything you hate about modern Country, this guy is old school cool without being a tired period piece.”\n\n[ Read More ]\n\n​\n\nJust the RANCHY stuff! Our newly released compilation album \"Bunchgrass\" is available to purchase. If you are looking for the antithesis of sissy Nashville music... this is your biscuit. Real rural music from the empty sprawl of northern Montana.\n\n​\n\nSaving County Music's 8/10 review of the album is quoted as: What you do get on the record is this artist’s signature mix of cowboy poetry and yodeling, songs of the Western puncher, and straight up classic country.​ Brilliantly composed with minimalist instrumentation that carefully chooses each tasty note and the exact right tone and instrument to perform it with, the wide open space is respected on Bunchgrass just like it is in the West.\n\n​\n\nGet \"Bunchgrass\" today at Wylie's Facebook Shop!\n\n​\n\n​"
