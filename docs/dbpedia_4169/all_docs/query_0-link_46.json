        "text": "When Beyoncé released RENAISSANCE in July 2022, she revealed that the album would be part of a \"three-act project.\" One year and eight months later, she delivered on her promise in a big, bold way with act ii: COWBOY CARTER.\n\nThe expansive 27-track project finds the star experimenting with country, folk and Americana, pushing the boundaries of genre in a way she never has before — and, in classic Bey fashion, serving up a poignant response to naysayers.\n\n\"It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed…and it was very clear that I wasn't,\" she shared in an Instagram post the week before the album's release. \"But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive.\"\n\nFrom thoughtful cameos to old-school instrumentation, COWBOY CARTER is the culmination of everything that makes Beyoncé one of the most influential artists of her time, flexing her knack for statement pieces as well as her versatility.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from Beyoncé's long-awaited new album, COWBOY CARTER.\n\nIt's Not Country, It's KNTRY\n\nBeyoncé revealed the COWBOY CARTER track listing in a rodeo-inspired concert flyer posted to Instagram on March 27. The artwork shared an important tag at the bottom: \"Brought to you by KNTRY Radio Texas.\"\n\nKNTRY Radio is a fantasy station with a wide open format created for COWBOY CARTER, and hosted by Willie Nelson in two short \"SMOKE HOUR\" interludes. Throughout the album, you'll hear samples of old songs by Chuck Berry and other classic artists.\n\nAs Beyoncé stated in another pre-release Instagram post, COWBOY CARTER isn't a country album. Instead, popular styles are blended together in surprising ways to create a new sound that's purely Beyoncé. (There's even a moment, on \"DAUGHTER,\" where she sings a verse from a famous Italian opera called \"Caro Mio Ben.\")\n\nWhether through an intro, an interlude or a powerful verse, it's clear that Beyoncé and her guests are trying to open minds musically with these songs. \"If there's one thing you can take away from our set today, let it be this,\" Nelson said in the second of his two \"SMOKE HOUR\" radio-style interludes on the album. \"Sometimes you don't know what you like and someone you trust turns you on to some real good s—. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I'm here.\"\n\nIt's A Unique Continuation Of Her Mission\n\nCOWBOY CARTER begins the same way as it ends, with Beyoncé proclaiming, \"Them big ideas are buried here, Amen,\" in the intro of opener \"AMERICAN REQUIEM,\" and then \"Them old ideas are buried here, Amen\" in the last line of closer \"AMEN.\"\n\nThose statements reflect exactly what Beyoncé set out to do with COWBOY CARTER: celebrate the Black community's roots within the country space, while addressing the lack of cultural acceptance of it. The album celebrates Blackness in the way she's always done, but in a way that feels even more revolutionary.\n\nThis is perhaps best exhibited in the trap-infused track \"SPAGHETTII.\" \"Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they?\" asks Linda Martell — who was the first Black woman soloist to appear at the Grand Ole Opry — on the song's intro. \"In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand/ But in practice, well, some may feel confined.\"\n\nAs Beyoncé adds in the first verse, \"Now we on a mission, tried to turn me to the opposition/ I'm appalled 'bout the proposition/ Y'all been played by the plagiaristic, ain't gonna give no clout addiction my attention.\"\n\nBeyoncé has long been at the forefront of honoring Black culture, and COWBOY CARTER is her most boundary-pushing addition to the conversation yet — and she hopes to change the \"old ideas\" into \"big ideas.\"\n\nIt Takes Her Cinematic Love To The Next Level\n\nIt's no secret that Beyoncé loves her visuals. Though COWBOY CARTER isn't a visual album like some of her previous releases, a press release revealed that each of the songs on the album are inspired by Western films. In a statement, Beyoncé named five specific films as primary influences: The Harder They Fall, Killers of the Flower Moon, Urban Cowboy, The Hateful Eight, and Five Fingers For Marseilles.\n\nSeveral of the COWBOY CARTER visuals have elements of Western films, from the desert and mountainous landscapes of \"AMERIICAN REQUIEM\" and \"OH LOUISIANA\" to the rainy ashtray in \"AMEN.\" And it's likely not a coincidence that a track called \"SPAGHETTII\" ended up on an album inspired by Westerns.\n\nBeyoncé even made a new catchphrase out of the most famous Western movie actor of all time on \"BODYGUARD,\" where she declares she'll \"John Wayne that ass.\"\n\nIt's Her Most Organic Sound Yet\n\nPivoting from the electronic landscape of RENAISSANCE, Beyoncé favors analog instruments over digital sounds on COWBOY CARTER. As \"TEXAS HOLD 'EM\" foreshadowed, there's plenty of banjo, boot-stomping beats and guitar plucks — and even Beyoncé's fingernails as percussion — across the album.\n\nRaw instrumentation is also sprinkled throughout, particularly on \"FLAMENCO\" and her stunning cover of the Beatles' \"Blackbird\" (whose title is given an act ii twist as \"BLACKBIIRD\"). And if anything sounds a little unpolished, Beyoncé wants you to know it was completely intentional.\n\n\"With artificial intelligence and digital filters and programming, I wanted to go back to real instruments, and I used very old ones,\" Beyoncé explained in a press statement. \"I didn't want some layers of instruments like strings, especially guitars, and organs perfectly in tune. I kept some songs raw and leaned into folk. All the sounds were so organic and human, everyday things like the wind, snaps and even the sound of birds and chickens, the sounds of nature.\"\n\nIt's Another Family Affair\n\nNow that Beyoncé's first-born daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, has played a prominent role in her mom's career — winning a GRAMMY in 2021 for her part in \"Brown Skin Girl\" and famously dancing on the RENAISSANCE World Tour — it was time for her little sister to shine.\n\nSix-year-old Rumi Carter contributes an intro on \"PROTECTOR,\" by asking Bey if she can \"hear the lullaby.\" Though Rumi isn't featured in the rest of the track, hearing her voice at the beginning makes the song's sweet sentiment all the more impactful: \"And I will lead you down that road if you lose your way/ Born to be a protector,\" Beyoncé sings on the chorus.\n\nWith so much to uncover in COWBOY CARTER, Beyoncé already has the anticipation high for the final part of her album trilogy. Will act iii feature Rumi's twin brother, Sir Carter? Will the rumors of Beyoncé exploring her rock side be true? We'll hopefully find out soon enough, but for now, get lost in the world of COWBOY CARTER — a testament to Beyoncé's prowess as an ever-evolving trailblazer.\n\nA Brief History Of Black Country Music: 11 Important Tracks From DeFord Bailey, Kane Brown & More\n\nEnter The World Of Beyoncé\n\nIn 1997, all-female R&B groups were thriving: TLC already had seven Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, En Vogue had numerous platinum singles, and Xscape reached No. 1 more than once. Soon, a quartet of teenagers would burst upon the scene and leave an indelible impact.\n\nWhile Destiny’s Child are now canonical in the world of '90s and early aughts R&B, the group initially experienced spotty success. Their 1997 debut single, \"No, No, No (Part 2)\" peaked at No. 3 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and was certified platinum. Yet their eponymous album, released in February 1998, only hit No. 67. Their follow up single, \"With Me,\" also failed to set the charts ablaze.\n\nDestiny’s Child's underwhelming chart performances could’ve easily derailed the budding group. Fortunately, the four ambitious girls from Texas had other plans.\n\nBeyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and Le Toya Luckett were determined not to become one hit wonders, and quickly went back into the studio to record their sophomore album. Released on July 14, 1999, The Writing’s On the Wall became Destiny’s Child’s highest selling album and spawned some of their most iconic songs — one of which led to the group's first GRAMMY win. Not only did the album establish Destiny's Child as a household name, but it fine tuned the R&B girl group concept to perfection.\n\n\"We had no idea that The Writing's on the Wall would be as big a record as it was. Especially worldwide,\" Beyoncé said in a 2006 Guardian interview.\n\nIn celebration of the iconic album's 25th anniversary, read on for five reasons why The Writing’s On the Wall is the defining album of Destiny’s Child’s career.\n\nIts Members Took Creative Control\n\nOn their debut album, Destiny’s Child tapped into the neo soul trend popularized by the likes of D’Angelo, Erykah Badu, and Maxwell — artists in their early-to-mid twenties with a maturity the teen quartet didn’t yet have. The references and creative direction clashed with the reality of the group members being so young.\n\n\"It was a neo-soul record and we were 15 years old. It was way too mature for us,\" Beyoncé tol the Guardian.\n\nHeading back into the studio, the girls made sure to eradicate any misalignments and put more of themselves into their sophomore album. In an interview with MTV, the members said The Writing’s On the Wall had a fresher, more youthful vibe because \"it comes from us.\" The quartet's fingerprints are all over the 16 track album: Each member co-wrote at least 50 percent of the album.\n\n\"Even at the time, Beyoncé would produce a lot of their background vocals, and she was a leader even at a young age,\" Xscape's Kandi Burruss said in a Vice interview, reflecting on her work as a songwriter and producer on The Writing's On the Wall. This heightened presence enabled the group to develop lyrics that boldly reflected their opinions and youthful energy. In turn, The Writing's On the Wall netted a run of iconic hit singles.\n\nRead more: Destiny's Child's Debut Album At 25: How A Neo-Soul Album From Teens Spawned R&B Legends\n\nIt Pushed R&B Forward\n\nLike its predecessor, The Writing’s On the Wall is very much an R&B album. However, Beyoncé's father Mathew Knowles — who still managed the group at the time — brought in producers who weren’t afraid to experiment. The result was a more commercial album that fused classic R&B with pop influences, creating a sound that was simultaneously contemporary and timeless.\n\nKevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs and Burrus (who would go on to co-write and produce TLC’s \"No Scrubs\") contributed to five of the album's tracks, shaping its overall sound and differentiating it from Destiny’s Child. The duo kept a few elements from the group’s debut effort, including the sing-rapping heard on \"Bug A Boo\" and \"Hey Ladies.\" With syncopated beats, thumping basslines, and their knack for writing catchy hooks, Briggs and Burrus created R&B records with the perfect blend of chart-friendly accessibility.\n\nOn the Missy Elliott produced \"Confessions,\" synthesizers, drum machines, and electronic garbling were layered to create a lush, futuristic backdrop. Further subverting the classic R&B ballad, Elliott paired what sounds like a cabasa to match Beyonce’s cadence throughout the verses which gives her laidback vocals an almost robotic feel. In addition to producing, Elliott’s velvety vocals also appear quite prominently on the chorus, adding to the track’s sonic tapestry.\n\nGRAMMY-winner Rodney Jerkins was tapped to produce \"Say My Name.\" The original beat Jerkins used was two-step garage, a subgenre of UK garage. No one else liked the sound, so he completely revamped the track into the GRAMMY-winning anthem we know today. Jerkins melded funk-inspired guitar and a call and response approach, then modernized them with a shimmery, polished production. This helped \"Say My Name\" become the group’s most listened to song on Spotify with over 840 million streams. Jerkins has even gone on record to say this is his favorite song he’s produced to date.\n\nRead more: \"Say My Name\" 20 Years Later: Why The Destiny's Child Staple Is Still On Everyone's Lips\n\nIts Music Videos Praised Black Culture\n\n\"For me, it is about amplifying the beauty in all of us,\" Beyoncé said in a 2019 interview with Elle when asked about the importance of representation. Even before her solo work, the importance of spotlighting Black culture was evident in Destiny's Child's music videos.\n\nIn \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" we see the group play the role of hair stylists in a salon which is an obvious nod to Beyoncé's mother’s longstanding relationship with all things hair. Near the end of \"Bug a Boo,\" the members change into their version of majorette costumes and dance in front of a marching band. Majorettes and marching bands have a vibrant legacy within HBCUs; almost 20 years after this video premiered, Beyoncé revisited this very concept for her 2018 Coachella performance.\n\nIt Delivered Mainstream Success\n\nThe Writing’s On the Wall was a hit across the charts. The group earned their first No. 1 singles on Billboard’s Hot 100 with \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Say My Name.\" Promotions for the latter also reinvigorated album sales and helped shift another 157,000 copies (an impressive 15 percent increase from their first-week sales). The fourth and final single, \"Jumpin’, Jumpin’\" was released during the summer of 2000 and became one of the most played songs on the radio that year.\n\nSongs from the album were nominated at both the 42nd and 43rd GRAMMY Awards. Destiny’s Child took home their first golden gramophone at the 2001 GRAMMYs, winning Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"Say My Name.\" The single also won Best R&B Song and was nominated for Record Of The Year.\n\nWith 14 nominations, Destiny’s Child remain the most nominated girl group in GRAMMY history. With worldwide sales of 13 million, The Writing’s On the Wall is also the fourth best-selling girl group album of all time.\n\nIt Expanded The Concept Of \"Girl Power\"\n\nThe Writing’s On the Wall was much more than catchy, radio-friendly tunes. Lyrically and in production, the album reintroduced Destiny’s Child as the architects for their own lives. The tongue-in-cheek Godfather-inspired intro tees up each song with a commandment for their partners and, at times, for themselves.\n\nOften misconstrued as a gold digger anthem,\"Bills, Bills, Bills\" empowers a woman to confront a lover who's financially taking advantage of her. This is a far cry from the theme of a young woman focused on finding love — a common theme on Destiny's Child — and puts their confidence on full display. \"So Good\" is a sassy, uplifting anthem which explicitly addresses haters with pointed lyrics like \"For all the people ‘round us that have been negative/Look at us now/See how we live.\" Destiny's Child was sending a clear message: they’re going to be fine regardless of what others say.\n\nAnd when the group became tabloid fodder due to unexpected lineup changes, \"So Good\" took on a new meaning for persevering through hard times. While there are some songs with morally questionable lyrics — we’re looking at you ‘\"Confessions\" — the consistent message of embracing one’s self-worth and independence is clear.\n\nMore Girl Group Sounds & History\n\nWith one bold tweet, Tanner Adell's life changed.\n\n\"As one of the only Black girls in the country music scene, I hope Bey decides to sprinkle me with a dash of her magic for a collab,\" she wrote, minutes after Beyoncé premiered \"TEXAS HOLD 'EM\" and \"16 CARRIAGES\" during this year's Super Bowl in February.\n\nAt first, Adell was mocked for her pitch. \"You're trying too hard, love,\" one user said. Another chimed in, \"Baby, that album is finished with all the songs cleared. I don't know about this one. Maybe, open for the tour,\" another user remarked.\n\nBut she wasn't bothered by the chatter: \"Those people said I look desperate, I'm like, 'You must not know me, b—!\" Adell reveals to GRAMMY.com with a hearty laugh.\n\nConfidence is the inner core of the Tanner Adell ethos. And her boldness paid off because shortly after when Beyoncé approached her to feature on COWBOY CARTER.\n\nIn Adell's first music release of 2024, she appeared alongside Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, and Reyna Roberts in Beyoncé's cover of \"BLACKBIIRD\" by The Beatles. It was a full-circle moment for Adell in more ways than one, as her father used to sing the song to her as a child. Little did she know, decades later, she would popularize the track's backstory — the plight of Black women in the American South — alongside one of her heroes.\n\nBut before Adell became one of Beyoncé's songbirds, she was also the Buckle Bunny. On the 11-track mixtape, Adell traced the provocative tales of an acrylic nail-wearing, lasso-wielding heartbreaker. But for every Black girl that listens, it's more than a country project. It's also a reminder that it's okay to be feminine and girly, just like Shania Twain, Carrie Underwood or Taylor Swift.\n\nAmong her rodeo of exciting firsts, Adell tacks another on June 8, when she makes her debut at Nashville's Nissan Stadium during CMA Fest. She'll perform on the Platform Stage at the stadium; the next day, she'll play a set at the Good Molecules Reverb Stage outside of Bridgestone Arena.\n\nBelow, hear from Adell about her most memorable firsts thus far, from having her debut daytime television performance on \"The Jennifer Hudson Show\" to bonding with Gayle King behind the scenes at Stagecoach Music Festival.\n\nSeeing Her Breakthrough Single, \"Buckle Bunny,\" Have A Second Life\n\nI released \"Buckle Bunny\" on the Buckle Bunny EP in July 2023. I actually teased it on social media first. Almost nine months before that, I had gone super viral with it. It was doing incredibly well, so my plans were to release it in January or February of last year. But, I ended up signing a record deal in December of 2022. There were plans for it at that time, but the timeline kept getting pushed back. It turned into a fight to get that song back into my hands, which was what prompted me to go independent. Eventually, I was able to work with my label, shake hands, and mutually part ways.\n\nI started this year as an independent artist with this song that everybody loves. It's become a huge part of my brand, but it's really my life story. People might think it's a dumb song that was easy to write, but I was called a \"buckle bunny.\" As a teenager growing up between Los Angeles and Star Valley, Wyoming, I was into glam country, and \"Buckle Bunny\" is the pinnacle of that.\n\n\"Buckle Bunny\" was my first single that charted. I felt like I finally had broken through that invisible box that Nashville put me in as a country musician. It was me saying, I'm not going to follow any rules. I'm going to be as true to myself as possible.\n\nWe, as Black women, have been fighting our whole lives. We've been fighting for space. I'm purposely trying to bring softness into the picture, allowing women who listen to my music to know that it's okay to feel that way. We don't always have to have our walls up.\n\n\"Buckle Bunny\" is aggressively confident, but I think that's the door to softness. You have to be self-assured to let your walls down. My newest single, \"Whiskey Blues,\" is my next step into that. I have another song on my social media, \"Snakeskin,\" that people want me to release. \"Buckle Bunny\" is like the girl who protects those softer moments.\n\nIn a way, I look at all of this as a relationship between Tanner Adell, the artist, and Tanner, the person. For me, Tanner Adell is the buckle bunny. Then, you have Tanner, who's on the inside, writing all of these songs.\n\nServing A Bold Fashion Statement On Her First Major Red Carpet\n\nI wore Bantu knots! I've always loved Bantu knots in all styles, the really small ones and the larger ones. There were ideas about whether I should do a certain number of them that was significant to me in some way.\n\nI work very closely with Bill Wackermann, who was the CEO of Wilhemina Models. He does a lot of styling and has a close relationship with my manager. So, my manager was like, \"You would love him!\" At the time, I was trying to hone in on what myself is. What's the message I'm trying to convey through my fashion, hair, and beauty?\n\nBill sat down with me, and I told him I wanted Natalia Fedner to do my dress, which is that stretchy chain metal dress. Originally, I thought I would do my long blonde hair, but Bill was the one who told me, \"This is your first major red carpet as an invited artist. Think about what you want your hair to say.\" As a Black woman, our hair tells 1,000 stories with whatever it is, and the lightbulb went off in my head.\n\nI knew I wanted my hair to say everything I needed to say without having to say anything at all. I also knew there would be a lot of people who didn't know the significance behind it or just thought it was some extreme hairstyle.\n\nI've looked very deeply into my heritage. It turns out I have a bit of Bantu heritage in my DNA. I thought that was so cool because I do love the knots so much.\n\nThe CMT Awards were a big thing at my school, Utah Valley University. Everyone would get together in the dorms and watch the show. It's crazy that a couple years ago, I was watching it, and I'm here now. I feel very respected and loved. People I've looked up to would come up to me, and I was like, \"I'm a huge fan.\" And they're like, \"No! I listened to you.\"\n\nI got to meet Gayle King, who I absolutely love. I remember watching her from afar while she was doing \"CBS Mornings.\" She saw me from across the room, and I kid you not, in the middle of her interview, she started walking towards me. She was like, \"I just want to tell you that you're so beautiful. The Bantu knots are stunning.\" That was my favorite moment of the night.\n\nI also had the chance to see Tiera Kennedy. She's so sweet. We got matching blackbird tattoos before that. Being on the red carpet for the first time, it was comforting to see a familiar face. It really reinforces that idea that I belong here.\n\nBeing A Part Of COWBOY CARTER\n\nSo, I'm adopted. I have four siblings. We're all biracial, but our adoptive parents are both white. Obviously, my dad is a white man with five Black children. My parents always wanted me to understand that I am a Black woman, and he was very educational when it came to music. He taught me about the Black female power players and the buzz in the industry. But The Beatles were his favorite. So, when I finally told them the news, my dad immediately got choked up. He told me that \"Blackbird\" was one of his favorite Beatles songs.\n\nMy dad isn't the best with words when it comes to expressing his emotions, especially in front of people. He's a quiet, reserved dude. So, he eventually texts me, sending me screenshots about the meaning behind \"Blackbird.\" The reason why it was his favorite song was because he had Black girls, and he told me, \"This is special. This is not a burden to carry, but it might be a bit of weight on your shoulders. Keep your head up high and walk knowing that this is why he wrote this song.\"\n\nI can remember going to a recital as a kid and being so nervous, but my dad was so confident and excited about my abilities. Was that strategic? Was it quiet strength? Maybe. It feels like this song has been a part of my whole life. So, to be on it, on such a massive album, feels very divine.\n\nThe whole process was a surprise. It took a few weeks to set in. But I always knew I would work with [Beyoncé], and I always said it's a matter of \"when,\" not if.\n\nOn the day of the Super Bowl, I saw that black-and-white picture of her, and I thought it looked a lot like a photoshoot that I took the week before. Let me make a tweet, just to put it out there. I don't know — she's magical! She has her way of knowing everything that's going on all the time.\n\nI think that tweet has almost 10 million views. It was fun to go back to that tweet to see the people who were supporting me. And also getting to say \"I told you\" to the people who didn't. It kicked off a Renaissance — pun intended.\n\nPerforming At Her First Stagecoach Music Festival\n\nI have bad social anxiety, and I get nervous in front of crowds and people. So, festivals were never something that interested me, but Stagecoach was always one I felt like I could go to. And I was not disappointed.\n\nI had the first slot of the day, which is a s—ty slot for anyone, but you have to pay your dues in country music. It's how you build your cred with these festivals, to show you're a hard worker and will perform like you're at a sold-out show in Madison Square Garden. And I did.\n\nMentally, I prepared for no one. I told myself it was okay if nobody came, and I'll perform like I always do. I'll figure out where the camera is and perform it for the jumbotron, so if no one comes to the pit, the people watching the livestream will have a great show.\n\nWell, I didn't have an empty pit! People showed the f— up and out. I heard people in line thought they were going to miss it because the gates opened late. Within the first 10 minutes, the VIP pit was half-filled with people screaming and running in their sweet little cowboy boots and hats. That never happens at Stagecoach or Coachella, but it's a testament to the relationship I built within my listeners. It was eye-opening for me. I don't think I'm ever going to play to a dead crowd again.\n\nBefore, Levi's reached out and said I was the first artist they wanted to collaborate with for Stagecoach. So, they custom-made my outfit. I told them I have these ribbons, inspired by my mom, who was a rodeo queen. I also told them if they can't incorporate them, I probably won't do it. But they loved it! And it was special because it came back to my mom. She was a winner, so when I wear the ribbons, I'm also a winner.\n\nMy mom has competed in over 1,000 competitions and probably places in half of those. In Wyoming, we had a big wall, covered in those IQHA (International Quarter Horse Association) ribbons. She gave me a strong sense of competition.\n\nMaking Her Debut On Daytime TV\n\nI have overcome very serious, debilitating stage fright. I don't get nervous anymore, and performing live is my favorite thing. But I was not prepared for what a television show taping looks like.\n\nWe had a soundcheck, and there were a bunch of suits in groups of threes and fours standing everywhere. There were all these cameras and lights. Then, I start realizing I'm about to meet J. Hud, who I made little custom Crocs for. It was a dream come true.\n\nI know a lot about her story. We have very different upbringings, but we're similar in the sense of trying to stand on ground that isn't steady. I see her as someone who is a great example. She's reached so many different avenues. For me to be able to sit down with an EGOT winner is a great honor.\n\nI kind of like to keep my manifestations as quiet as possible. I don't tell anybody anything, but an EGOT is something I wouldn't mind having, you know?\n\nI look at her as a woman who exceeded greatness. So, it was just amazing — and for my first television debut. I felt like this is right for me.\n\nWhy 2024 Is The Year Women In Country Music Will Finally Have Their Moment\n\nEditor's Note: This article was updated on May 20, 2024 with information about Post Malone's collaboration with Morgan Wallen, \"I Had Some Help.\"\n\nSince Post Malone burst onto the mainstream nearly a decade ago, he has continued to flaunt his genre-defying brand of musical brilliance. For his latest venture, it’s time for gold grills and cowboy hats: Posty’s going country.\n\nThough his musical origins are in rap, Malone has seamlessly traversed pop, R&B, and blues, always hinting at his deep-seated country roots along the way. In the last year, his long-standing affinity for country music has moved to the forefront, with appearances at the CMA Awards, a country-tinged Super Bowl LVIII performance, and a feature on Beyoncé’s COWBOY CARTER. Next up, he’ll make his debut at California's Stagecoach Festival alongside some of country music’s biggest names — and pay tribute to some of the genre greats.\n\nWhile it’s unclear exactly what the Texas-raised hitmaker will be singing, his 45-minute set on Saturday, April 27 is labeled “Post Malone: Performs a special set of country covers.” After years of performing covers for and alongside country stars, the performance is arguably one of the most full-circle moments of his career thus far.\n\nAhead of his Stagecoach premiere, read on for some of Posty's biggest nods and contributions to the country music scene over the years — that could culminate in his own country album soon enough.\n\nA Slew Of Classic Country Music Covers\n\nMalone has a history of channeling his musical heroes, often pulling on his boots to deliver heartfelt covers. He's paid tribute to country icons many times, including covers of Hank Williams Jr.'s classic, \"There's A Tear In My Beer” in a 2018 fan-favorite video.\n\nDuring a 2022 Billy Strings tour stop at The Observatory in Los Angeles, Malone made a surprise appearance and used the moment to honor Johnny Cash alongside Strings. The pair delivered an acoustic duet of Cash's infamous murder ballad, \"Cocaine Blues.\"\n\nAnd just this year, Malone covered Hank Williams Sr. during a surprise performance at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. On April 3, he closed out the annual Bobby Bones' Million Dollar Show with a rendition of Williams' \"Honky Tonk Blues.\"\n\nA Longtime Kinship With Dwight Yoakam\n\nMalone has long collaborated with Dwight Yoakam, marking a friendship and professional partnership that spans his career. Yoakam is a GRAMMY-winning trailblazer known for his pioneering blend of honky tonk, rock and punk that shook up the country scene in the 80's with his blend of \"cowpunk.\"\n\nThe pair frequently joined forces on Yoakam's SiriusXM Radio spot \"Greater Bakersfield,\" where one standout 2018 appearance features Malone covering Yoakam's own “Thousand Miles From Nowhere” as the two laugh, strum and belt out the lyrics together in perfect harmony.\n\nOn April Fool's Day in 2021, they playfully teased fans with the prospect of a double country album release — which may not seem so far-fetched three years later.\n\nIt's fitting that Malone would find such deep inspiration in folks like Yoakam, a man who first rode onto the country scene with a new take on a traditional sound. Much like Yoakam bridged generations with his music, Malone brings a new yet familiar energy to the country scene, embodying the spirit of a modern cowboy in both style and sound.\n\nA Country Tribute To Elvis\n\nMalone teamed up with Keith Urban for a duet rendition of \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" during the \"Elvis All-Star Tribute Special,\" which aired on NBC in 2019. Originally written and performed by blues musician and songwriter Jimmy Reed, \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" was famously covered by Presley and commemorated through Urban and Malone's unique blend of modern guitar-slapping country-rock charisma.\n\nThat wasn't Malone's only country collab that night, either. He also covered Presley's \"Blue Suede Shoes\" alongside Blake Shelton, Little Big Town and Mac Davis.\n\nA Celebration Of Texas With Country Legends\n\nIn March 2021, Matthew McConaughey and his wife, Camila, hosted the \"We’re Texas\" virtual benefit concert, to help Texans coping with that year's disastrous winter storms during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFollowing performances by George Strait, Kacey Musgraves, Willie Nelson, and Miranda Lambert, Malone — who moved to Dallas when he was 10 — served as the night's final entertainer. He performed Brad Paisley's \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" followed by Sturgill Simpson's \"You Can Have The Crown\" backed by Dwight Yoakam.\n\nA Rousing Tribute At The 2023 CMA Awards\n\nAt the 2023 CMA Awards, Malone joined country stars Morgan Wallen and HARDY on stage to cover late icon Joe Diffie‘s “Pickup Man” and \"John Deere Green.\" Malone's first-ever performance at the CMAs felt more like a reunion than a debut, with Malone right at home among his collaborators.\n\n“I’ve manifested this for years,\" HARDY told Audacy's Katie Neal. \"Slight flex here, but I started following [Post Malone] when he had like, 300k Instagram followers. I was on the 'White Iverson' terrain, like the first thing that he ever put out and I was like, ‘this is dope,’ and I've been with him ever since.”\n\nAfter the performance, Malone hinted to Access Hollywood that it might be the start of a new chapter. When asked if a forthcoming country album would be in the works, he answered, “I think so. Yes, ma'am.” (More on that later.)\n\nA Countrified Appearance At Super Bowl LVIII\n\nBefore Beyoncé announced COWBOY CARTER in a Verizon Super Bowl ad, Malone offered Super Bowl Sunday's first country-themed clue at the top of the night with his tender rendition of \"America The Beautiful.\" Sporting a bolo tie and brown suede, Malone delivered his patriotic performance with a characteristically country drawl while strumming along on acoustic guitar before Reba McIntire's star-spangled rendition of the national anthem.\n\nMalone's performance followed in the footsteps of a long line of country artists who have kicked off the national sporting event, which started with Charley Pride in 1974 and has included Shania Twain, Faith Hill and Garth Brooks.\n\nA Tip Of The Hat To Toby Keith\n\nHis much-teased country album may not be too yonder. After confirming that a country album was in the works during a live Twitch stream on his channel, Malone has spent much of this year teasing forthcoming new work. There is no scheduled album release date as of press time, but Malone has shared snippets of new songs including “Missin’ You Like This” and dropped sneak peeks of collaborations with Morgan Wallen, HARDY, Ernest, and Luke Combs.\n\nIn February, Malone posted a sample of a collaboration with Combs, \"I Ain't Got A Guy For That,\" the first in a series of song snippets shared across his social channels.\n\nMalone and Wallen have been teasing a collaboration since the end of 2023. After building plenty of anticipation, they debuted “I Had Some Help” during Wallen's headlining set at Stagecoach in April. Officially releasing the track on May 10, the song didn't just prove to be a banger — it debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and broke the record for most streams in a single week with 76.4 million official U.S. streams, according to Luminate and Billboard.\n\nNo matter when the album may come, Post Malone’s Stagecoach set will only up the anticipation for some original country music from the star — and from the looks of it, fans and genre stars alike are more than ready for it.\n\n12 Must-See Acts At Stagecoach 2024: Tanner Adell, Charley Crockett & More\n\n\"Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they? In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand. But in practice, well, some may feel confined.\"\n\nWith those words, spoken on \"SPAGHETTII\" by Linda Martell — the first commercially successful Black female artist in country music and the first to play the Grand Ole Opry solo — Beyoncé provides a proxy response to her original call on Instagram 10 days before COWBOY CARTER was released: \"This ain’t a Country album. This is a “Beyoncé” album.\"\n\nShe delivered on that promise with intent. Through a mix of homage and innovation, Beyoncé's latest is a 27-track testament to her boundless musicality and draws from a rich aural palette. In addition to its country leanings, COWBOY CARTER includes everything from the soulful depths of gospel to the intricate layers of opera.\n\nBeyoncé's stance is clear: she's not here to fit into a box. From the heartfelt tribute in \"BLACKBIIRD\" to the genre-blurring tracks like \"YA YA,\" Beyoncé uses her platform to elevate the conversation around genre, culture, and history. She doesn't claim country music; she illuminates its roots and wings, celebrating the Black artists who've shaped its essence.\n\nThe collective album proves no genre was created or remains in isolation. It's a concept stoked in the words of the opening track, \"AMERIICAN REQUIEM\" when Beyonce reflects, \"Nothing really ends / For things to stay the same they have to change again.\" For country, and all popular genres of music to exist they have to evolve. No sound ever stays the same.\n\nCOWBOY CARTER's narrative arc, from \"AMERICAN REQUIEM\" to \"AMEN,\" is a journey through American music's heart and soul, paying tribute to its origins while charting a path forward. This album isn't just an exploration of musical heritage; it's an act of freedom and a declaration of the multifaceted influence of Black culture on American pop culture.\n\nHere's a closer look at some of some of the musical genres touched on in act ii, the second release of an anticipated trilogy by Beyoncé, the most GRAMMY-winning artist of all-time:\n\nCountry\n\nBefore COWBOY CARTER was even released, Beyoncé sparked critical discussion over the role of herself and all Black artists in country music. Yet COWBOY CARTER doesn't stake a claim on country music. Rather, it spotlights the genre through collaborations with legends and modern icons, while championing the message that country music, like all popular American music and culture, has always been built on the labor and love of Black lives.\n\nIt's a reckoning acknowledged not only by Beyoncé's personal connection to country music growing up in Texas, but the role Black artists have played in country music rooted in gospel, blues, and folk music.\n\nEnter The World Of Beyoncé\n\nCountry legends, Dolly Parton (\"DOLLY P\", \"JOLENE,\" and \"TYRANT\"), Willie Nelson (\"SMOKE HOUR\" and \"SMOKE HOUR II\"), and Martell (\"SPAGHETTII and \"THE LINDA MARTELL SHOW\") serve mainly as spoken-word collaborators, becoming MCs for Queen Bey. Some of the most prolific country music legends receiving her in a space where she has been made to feel unwelcome in music (most notably with the racism surrounding her 2016 CMA performance of \"Daddy Lessons\" with the Dixie Chicks) provides a prolific release of industry levies. Martell, a woman who trod the dark country road before Bey, finally getting her much-deserved dues appears as an almost pre-ordained and poetic act of justice.\n\n\"BLACKBIIRD,\" a version of the Beatles' civil rights era song of encouragement and hope for the struggle of Black women is led softly by Beyoncé, backed by a quartet of Black female contemporary country songbirds: Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, and Reyna Roberts.\n\nBeyoncé holds space for others, using the power of her star to shine a light on those around her. These inclusions rebuke nay-sayers who quipped pre-release that she was stealing attention from other Black country artists. It also flies in the faces that shunned and discriminated against her, serving as an example of how to do better. The reality that Beyoncé wasn't stealing a spotlight, but building a stage for fellow artists, is a case study in how success for one begets success for others.\n\nRead more: 8 Country Crossover Artists You Should Know: Ray Charles, The Beastie Boys, Cyndi Lauper & More\n\nGospel, Blues, & Folk (American Roots)\n\nAs is Beyoncé's way, she mounts a case for country music with evidence to back up her testimony. She meanders a course through a sequence of styles that serve as the genre's foundation: gospel, blues, and folk music.\n\n\"AMERIICAN REQUIEM\" and \"AMEN\" bookend the album with gospel-inspired lyrics and choir vocals. The opener sets up a reflective sermon buoyed by the sounds of a reverberating church organ, while the closer, with its introspective lyrics, pleads for mercy and redemption. The main verse on \"AMEN\", \"This house was built with blood and bone/ The statues they made were beautiful/ But they were lies of stone,\" is complemented by a blend of piano, and choral harmonies.\n\nHymnal references are interlaced throughout the album, particularly in songs like \"II HANDS II HEAVEN\" and in the lyrical nuances on \"JUST FOR FUN.\" In the later track, Beyoncé's voice soars with gratitude in a powerful delivery of the lines, \"Time heals everything / I don't need anything / Hallelujah, I pray to her.\"\n\nThe gospel-inspired, blues-based \"16 CARRIAGES\" reflects the rich history of country songs borrowing from the blues while simultaneously calling back to songs sung by field laborers in the colonial American South. \"Sixteen dollars, workin' all day/ Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make\" serves as the exhausted plea of an artist working tirelessly long hours in dedication to a better life.\n\nRhiannon Giddens, a celebrated musician-scholar, two-time GRAMMY winner, and Pulitzer Prize recipient, infuses \"TEXAS HOLD 'EM\" with her profound understanding of American folk, country, and blues. She plays the viola and banjo, the latter tracing its origins to Sub-Saharan West Africa and the lutes of ancient Egypt. Through her skilled plucking and bending of the strings, Giddens bridges the rich musical heritage of Africa and the South with the soul of country, blues, and folk music.\n\nPop, Funk, Soul & Rock 'n' Roll\n\nAll in, Beyoncé is a pop star who is wrestling with labels placed on her 27-year career in COWBOY CARTER. Fittingly, she brings in two other pop artists known for swimming in the brackish water between country and pop, Miley Cyrus and Post Malone. Her intentional inclusion of two artists who have blurred genres without much cross-examination begs the question, Why should Beyoncé's sound be segregated to a different realm?\n\nOn \"YA YA\" Linda Martell returns as the listener's sonic sentinel, introducing the track like a lesson plan: \"This particular tune stretches across a range of genres. And that’s what makes it a unique listening experience.\" The tune sinks into the strummed chords of Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" before leaping into a fiery dance track that features reimagined lyrics from the Beach Boys, with soulful vocal flourishes and breaks that show the throughline connection between '60s era rock, funk, and pop music.\n\nRobert Randolph lends his hands on \"16 CARRIAGES\" with a funk-infused grapple on his pedal-steel guitar. It's a style he honed through his early years touring and recording with his family band and later in his career as an in-demand collaborator working with names including the Allman Brothers, and Norah Jones.\n\nThe lesson is solidified as the album transitions into an interlude on \"OH LOUISIANA,\" featuring a sped-up sample of a classic track by Chuck Berry. This moment emphasizes the pop superstar's nod to civil rights era music history, spotlighting a controversial artist celebrated for his pioneering contributions to rock 'n' roll. (It's a part of music history Beyoncé knows well, after starring as Etta James in the 2008 film Cadillac Records, a veiled biopic of the legendary Chicago label Chess Records.)\n\nClassical & Opera\n\nOpera was missing from many listeners' Beyoncé Bingo card, but didn't surprise those that know her background. Beyoncé was trained for over a decade starting at an early age by her voice teacher David Lee Brewer, a retired opera singer who once lived with the Knowles family.\n\nCOWBOY CARTER gives sing-along fans a 101 opera class with \"DAUGHTER.\" In Italian, Beyoncé sings passages from the 1783 Italian opera \"Caro Mio Ben,\" composed by Giuseppe Tommaso Giovanni Giordani. The aria is a classic piece of vocal training that fittingly shows off her full range — taking us back to the earliest days of her vocal teachings.\n\nHip-Hop & R&B\n\nMidway through the album on \"SPAGHETTII\" Beyoncé announces, \"I ain't no regular singer, now come get everythin' you came for,\" landing right where expectations have confined her: in the throes of a romping beat, experimenting with sounds that blend hip-hop with R&B and soul. The track notably highlights the talent of Nigerian American singer/rapper Shaboozey, who also shows up to the rodeo on \"SWEET HONEY BUCKIN'\" brandishing his unique mix of hip-hop, folk-pop, and country music.\n\nBeyoncé worked with longtime collaborator Raphael Saadiq on this album, a career legend in the R&B industry, who lends his mark to several tracks on which he wrote, produced, and played multiple instruments. Beyoncé also utilizes the Louisiana songwriter Willie Jones on \"JUST FOR FUN,\" an artist who draws on a contemporary blend of country, Southern rap, and R&B in the hymnal ballad.\n\nThe violin-heavy \"TYRANT\" and \"SPAGHETTII\" both underscore hip-hop's long love affair with the classical string instrument (See: Common's \"Be,\" and Wu Tang Clan's \"Reunited\" as the tip of that particular iceberg) with a blend of soulful R&B lyrics paired with beat-based instrumentalization.\n\nIn a world quick to draw lines and label sounds, Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER stands as a vibrant mosaic of musical influence and innovation. Ultimately, Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER isn't seeking anyone's acceptance. As a Texan once told she didn't belong, her critical response claps back at this exclusion. It's also a reminder that in the hands of a true artist, music is limitless.\n\nRun The World: Why Beyoncé Is One Of The Most Influential Women In Music History"
