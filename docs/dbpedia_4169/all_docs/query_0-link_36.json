        "text": "Icelandic rock band KALEO ignites their return with a crisp and comfy new single following the trials and tribulations of a lonesome cowboy.\n\nSince gaining popularity in 2016 with platinum-certified album ‘A/B’, the four-piece band have successfully maintained their position in various parts of mainstream media such as film, television, and live TV. Their ability to write reflective lyrics with a unique and instantly recognisable sound has gained the attention of billions of people globally, selling out hundreds of shows and allowing them to obtain over 60 international certifications.\n\nEven being 3 years out of the game, having gone quiet since the release of their album ‘Surface Sounds’ back in 2021, it’s apparent they haven’t lost their ability to create yet another track to have on repeat. KALEO’s return with standalone single ‘Lonely Cowboy’ is a pleasant surprise, and in turn has received a warm welcome by fellow supporters. Commenting on the new track, lead guitarist and vocalist JJ Julius Son says “my friends and family have always encouraged me to put it out, but now was the right time. It’s an important one for me.”\n\nListeners can feel the downhearted nature of the cowboy as we are guided through his growing desperation for a loyal companion. And although lyrics such as ‘When the desert night is cold, I just want someone to hold me close/I don’t want to die alone, who’s gonna love me when I’m gone?’ give an overarching theme of questioning and despondency, the howling backing vocals and layering of acoustic guitars give glimmering undertones of hope.\n\nGruff and grounding vocals give a striking performance throughout, and it’s clear the band are sticking with their well-loved signature sound that allowed them to gain their world-wide status back in 2016. Grand bridge verses leading up to bold choruses take us on an untamed journey of the lonesome cowboy exploring the wild west. JJ notes that the song “feels like a Spaghetti Western, and I love those vibes”. The sentimentality of this single can be felt throughout, once again enticing loyal fans back into the vivid imagination and storytelling of KALEO.\n\nThe overwhelming push of orchestrated instruments in the final verses give a sense of ambition for our hankering cowboy, sending him off on his way as the vocals and acoustic guitar get stripped back for the last few lyrics.\n\nThe single is also accompanied by an impressive video performance in Rome’s Historic Colosseum, featuring a solitary JJ Julius Son dressed in a full western inspired outfit, perfectly mirroring the lonely cowboy we encounter in the song.\n\nKALEO are currently on tour across the USA and Canada, and with their recent single release of ‘Lonely Cowboy’, (and hopefully more to come), we can hope to expect some UK and European dates to join."
