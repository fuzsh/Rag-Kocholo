        "text": "During our our little excursion out west, back in August and September of 2914, we drove over 2,000 miles and ambled through parts of Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. One of the most interesting stops was when Peggy and I spent two or three nights with our r-e-a-l-l-y long-time friend, Rhonda Sedgwick Stearns, at her lovely and comfortable loghouse on the prairie.\n\nYessire, bob. Welcome to the wide open spaces.\n\nEntranceway to Rhonda’s place.\n\nThree of Rhonda’s horses came up each day for some food and lovin’.\n\nThis is one of several books which Rhonda Sedgwick Stearns has written. This non-fiction book is her story of the life Keith W. Avery, who was a respected Western artist. In addition, he was a knowledgeable horseman, rodeo competitor and cowboy, not to mention his decades as a high school teacher.\n\nRhonda took us a few miles to the northeast of Newcastle to this fine restaurant. It is snuggled down in the canyons, the pine trees and the deer and the pronghorn antelope. You talk about rustlin’ up a really tasty steak. Oooo, weee! Thes folks presented me with one of the doggone tastiest steaks my ol’ lips ever wrapped around. Mighty nice steaks and might nice folks, too.\n\nHere on July 20, 2015, I have added a link to a video I made of Bob the cowdog playing pool on top of the pool table. Alas, Bob is no longer a spring chicken so she, like many of us, is pretty stove up. Still, she (yes, Bob is a female cowdog) does the best she can at “Senior Citizen speed” and seems to enjoy it. I posted it on YouTube and here is the link:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAcxfDdsiQU\n\nWill Stearns was a no-nonse, straight-ahead cowboy when he married our little Rhonda. Together they worked hard to scrape out a living. They were both cowboys who loved the land, the livestock and the people of the area. While they always had their own place to work, they also hired out to other ranches to help their neighbors with the fall and spring roundups, the doctoring, branding and such. They were often in the saddle from before sunup until after dark, no matter whether it was blowing snow or raining so hard they had trouble getting through the mud and the runoffs.\n\nWill died in March of 2013. He had requested a true cowboy funeral. So his friends and neighbors built a beautiful wood casket for him, put his body in it and transported it to an old cowboy cemetery southwest of their house. And they did so in a wooden, horse-drawn wagon. He was buried in a quite pasture a long way from the highway. We miss you Will, but we plan on seeing you at the Great Reuion one day.\n\nBelieve me, I have known a large number of very fine and generous and kind people in my 73+ years. Most of those names you wouldn’t even know. But some of them have been famous in business or politics, the movies or on TV shows, or in rodeos, or as talented authors and poets and valuable contributors to their own town and/or state. A select few ever achieve national prominence.\n\nHowever, this was my very first time to go visit a friend who has done that. Though she is still traveling to speaking engagements, writing newspaper columns and cowboy poetry, she already has a monument erected at the park near the fairgrounds. Yep, that is none other than our friend Rhonda Sedgwick Stearns. She is quite a lady and is an influential witness for Christ no matter where she may be.\n\nI don’t know who made the following statement, but it certainly does apply to Rhonda. I am proud to know her, not just as a great writer and cowboy poet, but as my sister in Jesus Christ. She, as always, has been an encouragement to both Peggy and to me. As the cowboys say of dependable and trusty pards in difficult circumstances, “She would do to ride the river with.”\n\nKeith W. Avery,\n\nRenaissance Cowboy\n\nby Stan Paregien Sr\n\nCopyrighted July 10, 2015\n\nKeith W. Avery was born on Dec. 3, 1921,\n\nOver in Lansing, Michigan’s west side.\n\nHowever, when he was nearly age three,\n\nThey moved to rural Lowell to long abide.\n\nIt was a magic place with large maple trees,\n\nAnd plenty of places for a kids to hide.\n\nHis parents taught him early that laziness\n\nAnd dishonesty they would not abide.\n\nWell, Keith went to a school with eight classes\n\nIn a one-room school far from any town.\n\nWhile he was smart and learned quickly,\n\nOften he was bored and played the clown.\n\nOne day, while his female teacher spoke,\n\nHe was clowning around with a certain pal.\n\nShe stopped and asked what he was saying.\n\n“None of your business,” he said to the gal.\n\nKeith had never been sucker-punched ’til then.\n\nShe gave him a knuckle sandwich to his jaw.\n\nThat cured the class clown of his rude behavior,\n\nAnd–worse–someone told his ma and his pa.\n\nFunny how things turn out, ’cause he loved\n\nThat woman for teaching him about respect.\n\nAnd she taught him some folks really care,\n\nAnd so he learned a lot from being decked.\n\nNow the ancient Hebrew language was written\n\nAnd read from right to left, so we are told.\n\nMaybe that’s why Keith W. Avery’s teacher\n\nAnd mom came up with a reading plan so bold.\n\nYou see, young Keith had a phenomenal memory,\n\nSo rather than read he memorized and recited stuff.\n\nBut his 2nd grade teacher and his mother knew\n\nHis odd way of learning would never be enough.\n\nSo to wean him away from his unique behavior,\n\nThey made him read from right to left.\n\nNow that was a doggone big challenge for the kid,\n\nBut at “reading backward” he was quite adept.\n\nYes, in a matter of months he had learned to read well,\n\nRather than to memorize, so he got up to speed.\n\nBut all the rest of his days folks thought him kinda odd\n\nFor starting at the back of any book he wanted to read.\n\nBy the time he was in high school in Lowell, Michigan\n\nHe had another . . . , well, big mouth he had to feed.\n\nThat was no small expense to provide room and board\n\nTo his hungry horse, even if it was a pretty steed.\n\nThat’s when, to afford his horse, he ran a paper route\n\nSeven miles long, out there in the country, of course.\n\nKeith earned enough money for his equine expenses,\n\nBut the best part was he ran the route on his horse.\n\nWhen winter time in Michigan set in, that was a test.\n\nHe often returned home in the dark, ’bout half-froze.\n\nHe’d dismount and liven his feet by kicking the barn,\n\nThen he’d scrape ice from his gloves and his nose.\n\nWhy, back in about 1950 he was at Bartlesville, Okla.,\n\nRanching for hire and riding bulls and broncs for fun.\n\nIt was the thrill of the ride that really had him hooked,\n\nNot to mention getting a nice check when he was done.\n\nAt various times he was a horse trainer, breeder, judge,\n\nTrader, showman and rodeo producer to boot.\n\nIf there was a horse somehow involved in an event,\n\nKeith W. Avery was probably there, the horses to salute.\n\nAvery did not begin college until he was 30 years old,\n\nBut he excelled at the University at Las Cruces, N.M.\n\nEven while deep in studies, he cleaned out stables, and\n\nTrained horses to help bring home the necessary dough.\n\nKeith, with a few detours, became a high school teacher\n\nBecause it paid to support what he really like to do.\n\nThat was to read, write his poems and paint with his brush,\n\nWhen he wasn’t riding a horse or cooking up a stew.\n\nHe had begun writing general poetry way back in 1942,\n\nWhen of all things he was a sergeant in the U.S. Army.\n\nIn 1990 he wrote a book, Ridden Hard and Put Up Wet,\n\nA self-illustrated collection of his own cowboy poetry.\n\nIn 1995 along came writer Rhonda Sedgwick Stearns\n\nWith Trails of a Wanderer: The Keith W. Avery Story.\n\nAn experienced rancher, horse woman and author,\n\nRhonda told his tale with insights only she could see.\n\nFact is, pards, Keith W. Avery was a solid citizen cowboy,\n\nOne who never partied, got drunk or even swore.\n\nHe just never bought into the popular myth that a person\n\nHad to do those kinds of things or life would be a bore.\n\nAvery was a multi-talented sort of renaissance man–\n\nA rodeo star, a teacher, a poet, and businessman.\n\nAnd he was of the old school regarding business ethics,\n\nFor he accepted a man’s word and the shake of his hand.\n\nHe liked to call himself a wide-eyed wanderer,\n\n‘Cause he loved to travel far and even near.\n\nTravel, for him, was both fun and enlightening,\n\nSo he wandered here and there with no fear.\n\nBut he was always more at peace with himself\n\nWhen around horses and back country land.\n\nSo Keith Avery always had horses in his barn\n\nAnd a paint brush or a writing pen in his hand.\n\nHe was on the board of many horse organizations,\n\nBut the American Paint Horse Association was best.\n\nHe dearly loved those paint and pinto breed horses,\n\nNot that he had any less appreciation for the rest.\n\nSadly, Keith Avery in his last years lost his vision.\n\nMacular degeneration ended his ability to paint.\n\nNot only that, but he couldn’t see the horse colors\n\nOr a sunset, but he suffered with great restraint.\n\nSo, my friends, the next time you’re out in the wild,\n\nThink how this horseman followed his very own plan.\n\nRaise a glass or a coffee cup toward the north star,\n\nAnd salute Keith Avery, for he was a real good man.\n\n———————————————————————–\n\nRhonda Sedgwick Stearns’ book, Trails of a Wanderer:\n\nThe Keith W. Avery Story was published by Guy Logsdon\n\nBooks in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1995 for The Cheff Center\n\nFor the Handicapped, Inc., in Battle Creek, Michigan.\n\nDo you remember this ol’ cowhand from the Rio Grande?\n\nFred and Barbara McGinn, long-time friends of ours who live in Edmond, Oklahoma, two different summers have had us up to their large and comfortable cabin near Westcliffe, Colorado for a few days. That 5+ bedroom cabin is surrounded by tall pine trees and gorgeous birch trees. In 2014 we were joined there by other close friends–Tom and Sue Gooch and James and Glenda Cotton, all certified Edmondites.\n\nThere’s never a traffic snarl up there. Hardly any noise, unless you call the wind blowing through the trees a noise. We drink coffee and eat, go for walks, drink coffee and eat, drive around to see the deer and the other wildlife, drink coffee and eat, play cards and usually go to a Sunday non-denomination church service outdoor among the birch. Last year, Fred kindly arranged for me to do the preaching there for some 30 or so friendly folks. A deer actually saundered through the woods behind me as I spoke. That sunny Sunday morning it didn’t matter what our politics were like, what our occupations or ages were, what our bank accounts looked like or what denomination we normally met with. We were level at the cross. Believers from many different states and backgrounds. We had a fine service and then enjoyed a potluck meal together, all in a small clearning under a canoply of trees. Friends, it doesn’t get much better than that.\n\nThat evening, the eight of us drove to the north side of tiny Westcliffe to attend a, . . . well, a different kind of worship. We met with the friendly and enthusiastic ranch folk at the Westcliffe Cowboy Church. Their music was of the country-Western variety, with Christian lyrics layered over some well-known melodies and played by four or five talented musicians. We were all blessed by being there with them.\n\nThe cowboy church there is just a few years old, but they have a nice “Western-style” building filled with Western-style decoration. And get this: their several acres of land and buildings are their’s, not the bank’s. Their mission has been and is to reach the unchurched cowboys in the area. The preacher explained that they did not want to “steal sheep” from other congreations and haven’t. They are making a real impact in the lives of people in that area who are involved in the ranching industry or who simply love the cowboy lifestyle. Jeans, cowboy hats and boots are the order of the day.\n\nAs visitors, each of our couples was given a “Cowboy New Testament.” Here are some photos of this NIV version. Needless to say, I was just a “w-e-e bit” surprised to open it up and see the faces of two cowboys (and Christian singers) Peggy and I know. That was R.W. Hampton and Jeff Gore, really fine entertainers and excellent witnesses for the Lord.\n\nWell, buckeroos and buckerettes, that’s all there is. There ain’t no more.\n\nThis marks the very last issue of my THE COWBOY WAY blog, barring some miracle of resurrection a long way down the road. Due to health issues and other considerations, I am consolidating this blog and my STAN’S PARADISE REPORT blog into my THE PAREGIEN JOURNAL blog, located at http://www.paregien.wordpress.com .Writing this blog has been a fun and a satisfying ride for me.\n\nAlso, I will continue publishing every two months to my new web site, STORYTELLING DIGEST (http://www.storytellingdigest.com).\n\nI hope you’ll mosey over and take a look at the two which are left standing.\n\n— Stan Paregien\n\nDuring last August, Peggy and I took the longest vacation trip of any that either of us had ever done. We flew to St. Louis and visited people, flew to Omaha and visited people in Lincoln and over in Kearney. Then we flew from Omaha to Denver, rented a car and began our “land cruise.” We cruised right on through Colorado, Utah, Idaho, over to Montana, down to Montana, then down to Wyoming and returned our rental car back to Denver and flew back home to Florida on September 11th.\n\nWe kept bumping into cowboy-related things or people or animals. So I thought I would share a few photos of that aspect of our trip. Here we go.\n\nThe owner of this store in Florence, Colorado turned out to also be an accomplished artist and Western novelist. He has about six novels to his credit, and he did the artwork for each of the covers. Sure are lots of talented folks out there.\n\nWe and our friends James and Glenda Cotton ate supper one night at a Mexican restaurant in Canon City, Colorado. I was intrigued by the fact that on their drink list was a “Roy Rogers” drink right along with a “Shirley Temple.” When our congenial waiter brought a single check, Peggy said to him: “Oh, please, we would like to have one check for each couple.” The 45-ish waiter smiled and said, “Oh, no problem at all.” And with that he tore the check in two and handed half to Peggy and the other half to our friends. We were all kinda stunned for just a few seconds, then we all broke out laughing. Then he brought two checks. I got the impression he had enjoyed pulling that little joke on lots of other diners, too.\n\nThe photos here, about this cowboy church, were actually taken in 2012 when I first discovered it on my initial visit to Westcliffe, Colorado. Preacher Smith told me that the congregation’s mission is to convert to Christ “the unchurched cowboys and ranchers in this area. We are not going after any other church’s members. And we have found a real need here in this valley for such a mission. This church property, including every building on it, is paid for.”\n\nThey tell first time attendees that they are welcome. But they make clear they do not have a normal “church membership role.” They consider this body of believers to be a family and all are welcome. They do practice baptism by immersion, and they have communion every Sunday. Rather than passing around a collection plate, they simply have an offering box just inside the auditorium. And that auditorium, by the way, is decorated cowboy style with mounted heads of trophy deer and elk around the room.\n\nThey have a band composed of very good musicians. And they largely use country music songs which have had the original words changed to a Christian message with a cowboy slant, when possible.\n\nThey even have a rodeo arena on their land. They hold calf ropings and mutton bustings every once in a while for entertainment and to further interest cowboys and ranchers in the message of the Gospel.\n\nThese folks are enjoying a good ol’ watermellon feast in the area of Twin Falls, Idaho.\n\nThe men above have pretty fancy saddles and clothing, so they may have been duded up for a parade or some such in the Twin Falls area of Idaho.\n\nAs a photographer and history enthusiast (i.e., nut), I find it extremely hard to pass up a chance to take a photo of an old barn, or an old ranch house, or an old service station, or an old . . . . Well, you get the idea.\n\nI really liked the way the above photo turned out, with the weeds in the foreground the pretty buckskin horse next to the old barn.\n\nOn this leg of the trip, we stopped in Spaulding, Idaho (just east of Lewiston) at the National Nez Perce Museum. The photo below shows a Nez Perce man next to his paint horse.\n\nI was particularly intrigued by the above photo of a Nez Perce man who was a champion rodeo contestant. His name was “Jackson Sundawn” and the writing on the photo says “Champion of the 1916 Round Up.”\n\nWell, that’s it ol’ pards for this time. Next, we’ll show the cowboy-related items we found in Montana and Wyoming. That includes several photos of a visit with had in Newcastle, Wyoming with our long-time friend Rhonda Sedgwick Stearns. She spent her life growing up on ranches and working for other ranchers in the eastern part of Wyoming. Her many books and countless poems are authentic reflections of her own experiences and of folks she has known.\n\nAdios for now.\n\nWhen you get time, please take a look at my two other blogs:\n\nThe Paregien Journal (www.paregien.wordpress.com)\n\nStan’s Paradise Report (on living in Florida; www.stansparadisereport.com)\n\n–Stan\n\nTwo of our dear Christian friends were poor Tennessee tobacco farmers, Arah and Billy Smith. They lived in an unpainted shanty with floors so slanted your gravy would run off the edge of your plate if you were not careful. They were like grandparents to us, and we still miss their love and hospitality. Note that their “team” was a mule and a horse, nothing like a matched set.\n\nGene Paregien stands in the woods north of Stroud, Okla., in 1972 holding his father’s vintage .22 Remington Pump rifle. Stan’s parents bought that rifle for him in about 1953.\n\nGene Paregien is on his horse Shag while his uncle Tim Allen is on our horse Daisy. Photo taken north of Stroud, Okla., in 1972 by Peggy Paregien\n\nGene Paregien in 1972 proudly stands by his shetland horse, Shag. At that time Gene could already ride like the wind, either with a saddle or without. He really loved that little horse and had a world of fun on it.\n\nThis photo taken north of Stroud, Okla., in 1972 shows Gene Paregien riding Shag bareback and his maternal grandfather, W.W. (“Woody”) Allen, riding our horse Daisy. Moments later they took off or a little trail ride. At some point Gene got tickled by something Woody said or did, tickled enough to lose his balance and fall off of Shag. That’s when the horse’s hoof stepped squarely on the end of one of Gene’s fingers, mashing it so much that the doctor had to remove the nail. That really cooled down his enthusiasm for riding horses.\n\nThis is the only photo known to exist of Stan Paregien’s maternal grandmother, Mrs. John (Vada Walters) Cauthen, being on a horse. It was taken by Stan Paregien north of Stroud, Okla., in 1972.\n\nPeggy Paregien made these matching shirts and vests for the two men in her life: Gene and Stan Paregien. Photo taken north of Stroud, Okla., at Christmas of 1972 by Peggy Paregien.\n\nGene Paregien rides Shag while his paternal grandmother, Mrs. Harold (Evelyn Cauthen) Paregien, rides Daisy on our place north of Stroud, Okla. Photo by Stan Paregien\n\nWell, neighbors, that is about it for this second segment of my cowboy roots. One more section to go, that being from 1980 to 1987.\n\nUntil then, ride safe and ride for the brand. Or as they say in Oklahoma and Texas, “Dance with them what brung you here.”\n\nHowdy y’all:\n\nThought I’d take another ride down the ol’ memory trail. Hope you’ll come along, as we are traveling far back in time and space to a whole ‘nother world. The world of my youth, from 1943 to 1954.\n\nDig those fancy cowboy boots. Eh, I was always told they were cowboy boots. Looking at ’em up close and personal, heck, they kinda look like something band majorettes might wear. Shucks, couldn’t be. Cowboy boots kinda emphasized my muscular legs, right?\n\nI’m not real sure, but I think Edna May ran off with a 6-year old rich kid. I don’t know who she was and I don’t think I ever saw the sweetie pie again. Oh, say, about that haircut. No, not hers. Mine. For some reason, I decided that I wanted to be a barber when I grew up but I could not see any good reason why I should wait that long. So I began my barber practice by practicing on myself — hence the big gap in the front part of my hair. That new-style hair cut did not spark a wave of copycats.\n\nMy mom, Evelyn Cauthen Paregien, was a woman of many talents. One of them, in her early years, was sewing. She made me the Western shirt I’m wearing as well as the whole outfit (minus the hat) that my sister Roberta is wearing in this photo.\n\nIf there ever was a fake fight, this one takes the prize. I am wearing another cowboy outfit made by my mother. You can see that I am clearly beating up on my badly outnumbered and outfoxed cousin Jerry Paregien. Or is it that he is knocking me around like a punching bag? Kinda hard to tell, the fists were flying so fast. This boxing exhibition took place in 1949 at our company-provided house on the Todd Estate Ranch about three miles west of Santa Paula, Calif.\n\nHere I am in 1952, armed and dangerous with my Red Ryder BB gun. Sure wish I had that thing today.\n\nIt does on occasion get mighty nippy in sunny southern California. Somebody left a water sprinkler on overnight and this was the result. Hey, was this my long-lost first love, Edna May Burger maybe? Naw.\n\nThe above is one of my favorite photos from my youth. We had made a trip to Tulsa, Oklahoma to see my mother’s folks (John and Vada Cauthen) for Christmas. And on the way back to Newhall, California, we encountered a really big snow storm. So my father, Harold Paregien, took a photo of my sister Roberta and my mom Evelyn and me playing in the snow on the edge of Flagstaff, Arizona. Those doggone snowflakes still hold the record in my book as being the largest ones I’ve ever seen. It was beautiful, especially with all the pine tree covered mountains in that area.\n\nThat is a railroad track crossing there to the right of Tony’s nose. And just on the other side of that was (and is) Highway 126. That railroad track is no longer there, and neither is the company-owned house in which we lived. The house was located just a hundred yards or so inside the Los Angeles County line.\n\nThe horse Tony turned out to be far too head-strong for my sister to control. So our dad bought the horse on the right named Little Bit, and it was a really gentle, good horse for Roberta to ride. We spent a lot of time riding through the mountains surrounding our house, all of it the property of Newhall Land and Farming Company. Our father farmed the English walnut orchards there in the flatlands.\n\nRoberta and I rode in a parade at nearby Val Verde, California in 1954, along with our saddle pal Ann Walker. Her father, Slim Walker, also worked for the Newhall Ranch (her mother’s name was Tess Walker). The red marker on the left is Roberta on Little Bit, then the next red marker shows me on Taffy, and the third is Ann Walker on her horse.\n\nRoberta on Little Bit in 1954\n\nThis was my father’s brother, Bueford Paregien, and his family. They had one more daughter after this photo was taken. As you can see, they were kinda into the cowboy thing, too. That is my cousin Roger Paregien on the left, then Bobby Paregien and Danny Paregien. They all stuck pretty close to Bakersfield for decades.\n\nStan on Taffy, with the railroad track behind them and Highway 126 on the other side\n\nFor whatever reason, now lost in the maze of history, my parents decided to leave California and move back to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Perhaps my mom just figured it was time to live close to her parents for a change. I don’t know. What I do know is that we had to sell our horses and about 18 years would pass before I would owe a horse, again.\n\nThose were wonderful days there on the Newhall Ranch. Lots of wide-open spaces to explore. Lots of relatives and friends in and out all the time. Just very good years. And through it all, I went to the movies to see the latest adventures of Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Rex Allen, Jimmy Wakely, Tex Ritter, Gregory Peck, John Wayne and dozens more. It just couldn’t have been much better than that for a kid in love with the cowboy way of life.\n\nThanks for droppin’ by. Come back soon, ya hear?\n\n—Cowboy Stan Paregien\n\n“Slick” Paregien and his saloon gal, Persimmon Juice Peggy\n\nDeadwood, S.D. in 1877. Oh, wait. Make that 1987.\n\nIn 1987, while living 48 miles away from civilization–that’s how far we were from the nearest McDonald’s or Walmart–we left dear ol’ Laverne, Oklahoma in late June to head north to Sheridan, Wyoming. That very nice city was where the annual convention of the Western Writers of America was being held that year.\n\nPeggy and I also took along our teenage daughter, Stacy, and her teenie-bopper friend Belinda Bond. We loaded up and off we went. Up through the heartland of America, through Kansas and east to Wyoming. There was frost on our windshield when we got up to eat breakfast in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Beautiful country and it was about to get even better.\n\nWe traveled up through the majestic snow-capped Tetons (the French trappers named them such, saying that looked like . . . eh, well . . . let us say, ample breasts . . . if you get my drift). Then we spent several hours ooo-ing and awww-ing at Yellowstone’s marvelous river, lakes, geysers, waterfalls, mountains and animals. We spent a couple of nights at a lovely and rustic log-cabin resort close to the east entrance to Yellowstone. We all went horseback riding the next morning.\n\nAfter a peaceful night’s rest, we drove the fairly short distance to Cody, Wyoming and got a motel. We toured the fabulous Buffalo Bill Cody Museum and some of the other local sites, including “Old Trail Town western town.” The owner–Bob Edgar, an artist as well–had brought to one location (on the west side of Cody) maybe two-dozen or more historic cabins (think hiding place of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), school houses, saloons, ranch houses, etc. He was on site that day and gave us a personal tour of several buildings, then we bought a couple of paintings of his and said adios.\n\nThen it was a scenic drive over the Big Horn Mountains to the valley where the Holiday Inn at Sheridan, Wyoming was located. This was my third WWA convention, as in 1984 at Jory Sherman’s invitation I attended the convention in Branson, Missouri. I missed the next convention in 1985. But both Peggy and I attended the 1986 convention in downtown Fort Worth, with excursions to the “Cowtown” district and other location.\n\nOne evening we all were loaded onto tour buses and taken to the Eaton Ranch, sorta southeast of Sheridan (though I wouldn’t guarantee that direction). It is a huge ranch and mining company. Well, the mining company part comes from mining the pockets of tourists like us. Still, it was a great experience. We had a wonderful bar-b-que diner and then music and some dancing. Mighty nice, indeed.\n\nOn one day we took a trip to the Custer Battlefield National Monument & Cemetery near Hardin, Montana. It was a moving experience standing on that peaceful hillside and imaging the awful carnage and loss of life which took place that day when General Custer was badly out-numbered and his command virtually wiped out.\n\nBill Gulick, author of THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL and many other books,\n\nstands at the foot of the tombstone of Walter Stanley Campbell, his mentor\n\nand professor at the University of Oklahoma.

The last few days had been a feast of food, renewing friendships and meeting new folks, and finding out what was working and not working in the world of Western writing (fiction and non-fiction). It had been a great time.\n\nSee ya down the trail.\n\n–“Cowboy Stan” Paregien\n\nBradenton, Florida"
