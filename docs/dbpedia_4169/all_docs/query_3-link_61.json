        "text": "Originally written and performed by Michael Martin Murphey, \"Cherokee Fiddle\" was re-cut by Lee for Urban Cowboy.\n\n\"Azoff came out one night and heard me do \"Cherokee Fiddle,\" which was a big hit for me in Houston,\" Lee told Texas Monthly. \"He said, 'You want to sing it in a movie?' Well, people were bulls--tting me all the time. So I said, 'Yeah, sure, just as soon as I finish this watermelon. You bet.'\"\n\nInterestingly enough, however, the tune didn't become a country hit for Lee until a remixed version was released in 1982.\n\nAccording to Mancuso-Winding, Scaggs and songwriter David Foster were asked to write \"a seductive love song, something with some tenderness\" for Madolyn Smith's character, Pam.\n\n\"We only got the tape the night before shooting the scene, and the song wasn’t done yet,\" she recalled. \"It was rough, just a beat and a melody with Boz humming. And it was magical.\"\n\nThe finished product is indeed soft-rock perfection that became a huge adult contemporary hit.\n\n\"Boz saw the footage of John and me slow-dancing to the instrumental, and that's when he added lyrics and the title, \"Look What You’ve Done to Me,\"\" Smith told Texas Monthly. \"Before that they called it \"Pam’s Theme.\"\"\n\nThis easygoing song, which was co-written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey, was a hit long before Urban Cowboy: The song reached No. 8 on Billboard's country singles chart in 1975.\n\nThe crossover made sense: The song features Frey's keening lead vocals; Bernie Leadon contributing twangy guitar and mandolin; and the entire band unfurling gorgeous multi-part harmonies.\n\n\"Lyin' Eyes\" nabbed a Grammy for Best Pop Performance By a Group and was also nominated for Record of the Year.\n\nThe namesake of the club Gilley's, both in the movie and in real life, put a tender country spin on the Ben E. King classic. The musician covered the song at the behest of producer Jim Ed Norman: \"I thought what it expressed would be great in the movie,\" Norman told Texas Monthly. \"So I took all day working on it with Gilley. He’d sing the vocal, then I’d ask for another, and another, and another. Finally around 4PM, I saw him leaning against the wall, exhausted.\"\n\nWhen Mancuso-Winding gave Lee cassettes of songs to consider covering, choosing one was a snap. \"Within the first 15 songs, I pulled out \"Lookin’ for Love,\"\" he told Texas Monthly. \"I couldn’t believe I hadn’t written it myself: It was the story of my life up 'til then. I changed the rhythm on it, turned it into a two-step, and they put it in the movie.\"\n\nIt's no wonder \"Lookin' for Love\" is so successful: Lee's world-weary voice is a perfect match for the lyrics."
