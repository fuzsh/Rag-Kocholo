        "text": "DEMING - Totsie Slover, host of The Real West from the Old West radio show on KOTS 1230-AM, invites you to a concert with lawman Jim Wilson at 6 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 13, at Luna Rossa Winery.\n\nAdmission is free, but plan on buying CDs and tipping the singer. Snacks will be provided and beverages will be on sale.\n\n“My music is for people who live on gravel roads and the ones who have always wanted to. Cowboy music is a great way to keep in touch with our traditions and reaffirm freedom as western people,\" Wilson said.\n\nWilson is a Texas native who was born in Austin and raised in San Antonio. For nearly 30 years he served as a Texas Peace Officer in Denton and Crockett counties. In 1988, he was elected Sheriff of Crockett County (Ozona), Texas, and served in that capacity until his retirement from law enforcement in 1996.\n\nWilson began playing folk and country music while he attended Texas Christian University, in the 1960s. However, his earliest musical recollections were of his father singing the old cowboy songs, such as “Leaving Cheyenne” and “Streets of Laredo.” With the emergence of contemporary cowboy music in the 1980s, Wilson naturally returned to his musical roots.\n\nIn May of 2002, Jim Wilson released his first album, Border Bravo. Recorded in Lubbock, Texas, and produced by Andy Wilkinson, Border Bravo is a collection of cowboy songs and border ballads that focus on the American Southwest and the changing frontier. Wilson co-wrote three of the album’s songs and carefully selected the rest to tell some tales of the border country, one of the last frontiers. In November 2003, Border Bravo received the award for “Best Traditional Album” from the Western Music Association.\n\nWilson performs across the country at western music festivals, house concerts and ranch barbecues. He is an active supporter of the Western Music Association and has served on the board for several years, holding the position of vice-president when his term expired in 2003.\n\nWilson began writing for gun magazines while he was still sheriff of Crockett County. In short order, Wilson selling articles and columns to Guns & Ammo and Handloader magazine (Wolfe Publishing Co.). About 1995, Wilson began an exclusive association with Shooting Times Magazine and its parent company, Intermedia. He was handgun editor for the magazine and wrote Gun Smoke, the popular back page column.\n\nIn 2008, Wilson also began doing a regular segment on the NRA’s “American Guardian” TV show and is often featured on the other NRA TV shows that air on the Outdoor Channel."
