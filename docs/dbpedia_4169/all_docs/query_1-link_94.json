        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nNo one writes the old west like Seven-time Spur Award-winning author Elmer Kelton. In The Cowboy Way, Kelton captures the action, adventure, brotherhood and betrayal of the old west, chronicling the highs and lows of cowboy life in these sixteen stories, collected together for the first time.\n\nReview Quotes\n\nPraise for The Cowboy Way\n\n\"Texas as a myth looms large in the American psyche. The late Kelton perfected that myth... the storylines vary, each one is tinged with nostalgia--which might be exactly what readers are looking for from such a timeless author.\"\n\n--Booklist\n\nPraise for Elmer Kelton \"One of the best.\"\n\n--The New York Times \"You can never go wrong if .. . you pick up a title by Elmer Kelton.\"\n\n--American Cowboy \"One of the greatest and most gifted of Western writers.\"\n\n--Historical Novel Society \"One of America's premier Western writers.\"\n\n--The Dallas Morning News\n\nELMER KELTON (1926-2009) was the seven-time Spur Award-winning author of more than forty novels, including the Texas Rangers series, the Hewey Calloway series, and the Buckalew Family series.
