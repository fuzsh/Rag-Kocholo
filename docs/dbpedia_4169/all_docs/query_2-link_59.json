        "text": "You could also ask “why do artists outside of the country genre use complex chords instead of the simpler harmonies of country music?” The complex harmonies are not necessarily better.\n\nIn the country genre, there is a culture where an artist will make a song, and millions of everyday people who may not have had access to musical schooling can get themselves a guitar and learn to play and sing that song. If you know a few chords and have a capo and can sing a little bit, the reason you may love country music may be because you can play some or all of the songs yourself. That is a really beautiful tradition that also exists in some other genres like Blues.\n\nMany country artists come right out of that tradition — they didn’t have musical schooling, they just got a cheap guitar and taught themselves how to play country. Then they starting writing songs with that same basic musical toolkit, adding to that culture, telling their own stories.\n\nSo the focus in Country (and Blues) is on the storytelling, performance, and playability by a broad audience rather than the orchestration and arrangement. An analogy might be black and white photography, where you are deliberately putting aside color to focus more intensely on composition, texture, mood, lighting, subject.\n\nIn other genres it can be the opposite. In Jazz and Concert music, for example, there is an academic exploration of what is possible that is prioritized over making your songs playable by the everyday person. The photography analogy there might be not only using color film, but making video, making motion graphics, pushing the technical envelope.\n\nIn short, the simple harmonies of Country are a feature, not a bug.\n\nOne of the important roots of country music is the folk music brought to the Appalachians by European (particularly Irish) immigrants in the late 18th and early 19th century, with influences from African music (the banjo being the most obvious one) and the parallel development of congregational church music (the development of which was itself influenced by some of the same traditions). None of these are noted for the use of highly complex harmonies or harmonic developments.\n\nMusicians in these developing communities would also in many cases not have been professionals, but family members getting together and performing, which requires a straightforward, commonly-understood system of achieving 'harmony that works'.\n\nAlthough this early American traditional music included ballads and dances, It also seems that when the music started to be published and broadcast, it was the 'good-time' music - the dances - that was most marketable, and these were mostly oriented around major tonality. This led to what we think of as 'Country music' being associated most associated with the major key and scale in particular (although of course there are many minor-key country songs, these still don't make up a high percentage).\n\nA large part of the marketability of Country music is still based around its perceived authenticity and connection with the traditions of working and farming communities. For that reason, music that deviates a long way from these roots tends not to be labelled simply as 'Country'. A lot of Southern Rock, for example, has identifiably country elements, but is seen as separate. Outlaw Country also tends to include a wider range of influences, including more of the older ballad-style music, blues, and folk.\n\nSources : Appalachian Traditional Music - A Short History & Country Music - Piero Scaruffi\n\nI think it is hard to answer a question like this in any other way than with an opinion, even if it is based on some experience.\n\nWhen I look at a general cross section of country bands, there are, in many cases, a lot more players on the stage. Fiddles, lap steel, lead and rhythm guitar, bass, piano, etc. This typically means that you need to leave larger holes in what you play for others to fill in the gaps. Maybe you're jamming on a G major and the fiddle player is hitting the F# to make it sound as a Major 7th.\n\nSo while you might look up a chord chart for a simple tune and see a bunch simple chords, that is likely just the \"meat\" of the song, odds are good that when that artist takes the stage, he is playing with a host of other musicians adding notes to the harmony that turn those simple chords into much more complex harmonies.\n\nI could likely go on with other reason why I might choose simple chords to write a country tune, but for the most part it comes down to artistic expression.\n\nAs r lo mentions above, Western Swing is full of harmony you might expect to hear coming from a Jazz group.\n\nIt depends on what one calls country music. What I heard today I don't really consider country. I call it everything but. I remember the old days of country music, mostly because I am old enough to have been there. Back then, country wasn't a genre. It was a way of life and music was part of our way of life. Bluegrass was indeed born out of Appalachian Mountain music. Country music of the deep South was a totally different influence. Southern Country or Old Timey music as we called it,was a convergence of Appalachian Mountain music, Southern Gospel with a more than slight influence by Sacred Heart Music. Back then the focus on vocal harmonies more than on instruments. Music was less often planned than simply materialization. When I was learning to play guitar, I would go out on a Saturday morning and put a couple of watermelons in the spring. I would get my guitar and sit under an Weeping Willow and start practicing. Most times someone would stop and holler out,\" You gonna be here a while?\".\n\nBy the time evening rolled around there might be 50 people there and tables of food.\n\nOur Country rarely featured a banjo, but you could just about swing in any direction and hit a Mandolin Player.\n\nI learned \"Flat Picking sitting under that Willow from my cousins and neighbors.\n\nChord structures were often very complex. If you can imagine a yardfull of folks few of which owned a TV, a car or even a radio, then you can imagine how much they enjoyed showing off. Us younger folks (I was about 10 at the time, nearly 60 years ago, always had our favorites that we prayed we would be able to emulate some day. I will never forget the first time I clipped a capo on my guitar. I was nearly laughed out of my own yard. They didn't call them cheaters for nothing. In that time and in that crowd, if you couldn't pick without cheating, you better practice or get used to being made fun of.\n\nI miss those wonderful days.Not just the music ,but the way of life. Today, they call anything Country. But if it ain't Country, it just ain't.\n\nI hear a lot of fantastic musicians, but I ain't heard anything country in years.\n\nI agree somewhat with the original post.Chord structure sets the style. You can play anything you want to add call it what you want, but you can't make it something it ain't.\n\nI guess everyone has an opinion and of course this is just mine.\n\nI'll attempt a scientific answer which might partially explain this, but I should also say up front that I believe there is a large social/cultural component to this which is explained well in the other answers.\n\nThere have been a number of studies (see below) which asked people to rank particular dyads (two notes together) and triads (three notes - commonly known as a chord) in terms of consonance and dissonance. (See Kameoka and Kuriyagawa, 1969; Hutchinson and Knopoff, 1978, 1979; Cook and Fujisawa, 2006; Johnson-Laird et al., 2012)\n\nA couple of things arise from those studies. Major chords are almost always at the top of a ranked preference list for consonance, with minor chords coming in slightly lower. Another point is that the results differ between musicians and non-musicians with the latter being more tolerant of some kinds of dissonance or chord alterations.\n\nAlongside these studies, the study of what makes a chord consonant or disonant has been studied since the ancient greeks. Even the great mathematician Leonard Euler wrote a lot on this in 1739. Of all of these theories that I've looked at, I find the recent work by Frieder Stolzenberg to be the most convincing, in particular the paper \"Harmony Perception by Periodicity Detection\". That paper contains details of the studies on chord preference and also has good references to the other work in this area.\n\nThe details of Stolzenberg's work aren't too important here but the point I want to emphasis is that we, as humans, seem to respond to some chords differently and that we naturally gravitate to those which are more periodic. This is backed up by a plausible neurological model on how our perception of harmony works. That suggests that harmony isn't a 100% cultural phenomenon.\n\nHow does that relate to country? Here's where I have to hypothesise a little bit because I'm not aware of any studies that address this directly. My impression is that the transmission and popularity of a country music song relied mainly on being passed from player to player initially and then, later, on its ability to make an impression on the first listen when broadcast by radio. The audiences would probably have mainly been without musical training. Given our general preference for consonant, major chords exists this suggests that songs which used a simpler set of chords would be more transmissible.\n\nIf you look at something like jazz, it seems plausible that the harmonic complexity of that music developed over time. This might be related to the way it was originally intended for dancing. Dancers wouldn't judge a song by the harmony alone, which gave the musicians (with their more developed palette of consonance and dissonance) more room to stretch out and embelish the harmony.\n\nAs an example, if you count Western Swing as country (which I do) you can hear that the harmony is slightly more complex than typical \"cowboy songs\" of the era (lots of 6ths and 9ths, some blues scales). This might be because Bob Wills and similar acts were known for dancing primarily before then gained wide appeal via radio.\n\nAs I said, this can only ever be a partial answer due to the complexity of what makes up a given music genre. I hope that this offers a direction on why a genre might prefer simple chords though."
