        "text": "By Jagannath Roy\n\nCountry and Western music is now the rhythm of the young peoples’ hearts, not only of the West but also of the East. I always become nostalgic when I listen to country songs. The country is my love, passion, and inspiration for life. In a word, it is the only haven of my lone heart. I think it happens the same to you all. Well, I’d like to share some findings briefly here in this article on Country and Western music.\n\nThough there are no specific definitions of Country and Western music, yet we can certainly define it as the synthesis of Country and Western music. Both are the genres of American popular music. For our convenience, we’ll term this genre sometimes by the title Country and Western to the rest of this article.\n\nOrigin And Development Of Country And Western Music\n\nCountry and western music is a folk genre that originated from American popular music. We can discover its roots from the Southeast and Southwest and West America. This music genre fused with the two regional styles — the Country and Western. Initially, there was a common difference between the two genres. Country music of the southeast used fewer instruments like guitar, fiddle, banjo, and harmonica, whereas the Western of the Southwest and West favored steel guitars and big bands whose style touched on rhythm. The lyrics of Country and Western music depict the emotions and experience of rural and urban poor whites. Sometimes they openly narrate the affairs of illicit love, crime, and prison life.\n\nCountry and Western is descended rightly from the folk songs, ballads, and popular songs that spread in America from the English, Scottish, and Irish settlers of the southeastern seaboard. Country and western has gained a nationwide audience from around the ’60s of the last century. To make a clear understanding of the Country and Western music, we should have a glance at the history of the Country and the Western music genre independently.\n\nCountry music was the music of working-class American and Afro-American working-class people who lived in the south, chiefly in the Appalachian Mountains. It began to gain national attention in the 1920s, blended with Appalachian folk and blues. The soulful ballad of country tunes played in upbeat at barn dances. The Appalachian folk, pejoratively called Hillbilly, originated from several European and African music genres like English ballads, Irish and Scottish traditional music, particularly fiddle music, hymns, and African-American blues, which had an impact on the development of Country music. Banjo, American fiddle, fretted dulcimer, and guitar used to perform Appalachian music. Fiddlin’ John Carson and Carter Family were the most famous of the Appalachian musicians.\n\nBlues, a musical genre, came from the Afro-American people of North-America, that combined spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. It originated around the 1860s in the south of the U.S. Electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, piano, and harmonica used in blues. Bessie Smith (1894–1937), Blind Lemon Jefferson (1897–1929), and Charley Patton (1887–1934) were among the earliest blues singers of America.\n\nWestern music is a kind of country music that came from the Western part of the U.S and Western Canada. Several European folk music traditions and various cowboy songs had a direct impact on Western music. Western music depicts the life of North American cowboys and the working-class people of the highlands. This genre developed with English, Irish, Scottish folk ballads and, Mexican folk music. Tejano, a popular music style and the fusion of American, European, and Mexican folk music, also influenced western music.\n\nThe Country and Western music is the genre that came from Appalachian music and Western music in the mid of the 20th century by the music industry. Now, this genre amalgamated into the modern name Country music.\n\nChristianity And Country Music\n\nMost of the genres of Country and Western music propagandize secularism. Only the genre, gospel country music used to praise and worship Christ. Country singers perform country gospel in social and religious ceremonies used for motivating people with messages to lead a life morally in the right way. There are many organizations to promote Christian country singers, among them International Country Gospel Music Association (founded in 1957) plays a key role both in recording and spreading Christian country songs.\n\nThe famous radio personality Bob Wilson aired Christian country songs and Southern Gospel in his popular radio program — Gospel Country Round-up. The leading Country stars, The Louvin Brothers, the Carter Family, The Grand Ole Opry, and Faith Hill contributed largely to Christian Country music. Jesus Take the Wheel, I surrender, etc. are famous key tracks from Christian country music.\n\nCountry Music And Politics\n\nCulturally, Country music was the form of expression of the working-class people of North America very before the first recording of Country music in the 1920s by the Carter Family or Jimmie Rodgers. Country music was the living narrative of blue-collar Americans. Later, the country singers and composers like Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, Carrie Underwood, Bob Dylan, Brad Paisley, Country Rapper Cowboy Troy, and Joan Baez depict the contemporary sociopolitical phenomena with their country lyrics.\n\nMusic plays a role both in the anti-establishment and pro-establishment political movements. Country and Western music rightly do the same, composing and playing from the national anthem and patriotic songs to anti-war and anti-imperialist lyrics viz. the Beatles censored in the 1960s and 1970s. Pete Seeger’s songs like We Shall Overcome addressing the civil rights movement in America and Where Have All The Flowers Gone lifting a protest against the war and war politics Of the American State. Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind against the Vietnam War, Carrie Underwood’s Love Wins, and Brad Praisley’s Wheelhouse are also groundbreaking lyrics representing the social and political reality of contemporary America and convey the messages to break the chains of confinement.\n\nSome Well-known Country Stars And Entrepreneurs\n\nFirst Generation (1920–1930)\n\nJimmie Rodgers (September 8, 1897 — May 26, 1933)\n\nJimmie Rodgers, an American singer-composer and musician is regarded widely as the father of Country music.

We know that traditional folk or county music was the narrative of the working-class people of America. They would portray love, pain, sufferings, hopes, and dreams of their everyday life through their notes that were promise-bound always to the time. Modern musicians have adopted the country genres into their works. But we find distortions often in their performance. Despite this, country singers and composers played a great role in the 20th century. I’m Free From Chains, Blowin’ in the Wind (1963), The Times They Are a-Changin(1964), and Man in Black meaningfully represented the time and its interests.\n\nThe problem of unemployment was the burning issue of American society very before the covid-19 pandemic. The condition of the black people was worse than the whites both economically and socially in America. We stand before another great economic depression. People are suffering from insecurity. They have no dreams. They are also politically strayed. Now, it is the best time for country singers and composers to be the pathfinder for the people who are now in a stranded position socially, politically, and economically. They can motivate people with their country spirit. So, Country and Western music have more way to a go-ahead."
