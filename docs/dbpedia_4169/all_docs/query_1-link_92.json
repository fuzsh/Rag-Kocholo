        "text": "October 24, 2020\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Macmillan - Tor/Forge for an e-galley of this collection of short stories.\n\nElmer Kelton was a new Western author for me and I sincerely enjoyed reading these short stories as an introduction to his longer fiction. I learn a lot about an author by starting out with this type of collection including style of writing and keeping my interest focused. I will say that Mr. Kelton was successful in both of those instances.\n\nThere are 16 short stories included in this collection with publication dating from 1951 to 2010; 12 of the stories are set in the Old West and 4 in modern times. I definitely enjoyed the Old West stories because their subjects were so varied. The stories from modern times had their focus on essentially the same subject which were interestingly written, but not favorites. These stories all follow along with the \"code of the West\" feeling where there is a specific cowboy way of thinking and living your life. Pride, resourcefulness, determination; all are traits exhibited by the lead characters in these stories. There were no lawman stories so also no outlaws which made each of these short stories highlight the everyday life in the harshness of the west.\n\nKelton was a very prolific writer so there is much more for me to explore. This would also be a good jumping-off place for anybody who wanted to sample the works of this author with a view to reading his full length novels. I can certainly see myself headed down that trail.\n\nJune 27, 2021\n\nI received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley to read and review.\n\nTHE COWBOY WAY by well known western author Elmer Kelton is a collection of short stories that vary in the era they take place in, and the settings and characters that make up each tale.\n\nExcellent stories in all, and it’s not surprising given the quality of the author’s prolific output that includes several classics including my favorites “The Time It Never Rained” and “The Day the Cowboys Quit”.\n\n5 stars.\n\nJuly 21, 2021\n\nSheer pleasure! I had never read an Elmer Kelton before, but he is clearly a great writer in his genre, which is tales of the Old West. Each of these stories is a little gem. Kelton sets the scene in a few brisk sentences, introduces you the characters, poses a dilemma or problem, then solves the problem in a way you would not have suspected, and always with a genuinely humorous twist. If that sounds easy, just try it. It is not great literature, but the stories exude a sense of authenticity, and each one is satisfying. The Old West was mostly an invention, and Kelton probably did his bit of embroidering on the theme. The Rugged Individual and the lonesome cowboy with a heart of gold make their required appearances here, but they are here to entertain, not glorify, and their random acts of selflessness and harmless good humor will spice up anyone's day. .Kelton, who died a few years ago, was a master of the form.\n\nSeptember 7, 2021\n\nThere’s the right way of doing things, the wrong way of doing things, but above all there is the cowboy way of doing things. This book is a collection of sixteen short stories written by Elmer Kelton about the western way of life. What I enjoyed most (his writing style apart) was these stories spanned close to 100 years of western history, but the cowboy way of doing things remained true to form whether the cowboy was riding a horse or driving a truck. Each story includes aspects of the struggles we face within everyday life—we may struggle, but in the end, we overcome by doing it the right (cowboy) way. Excellent read.\n\nJune 30, 2024\n\nThe Cowboy Way\n\nReaders don’t need the forty-some-odd novels to know Kelton is the greatest western writer of all time. These sixteen short stories impart both the great drama of the west and, more impressively, the quiet desperation of those scratching out a living in agriculture from a harsh country. Kelton finds the majesty and human triumph in both the great and small.\n\nWe read a nice bookend of Hughey Calloway stories. The quintessential American cowboy does not disappoint. In between we are treated to glimpses into the lives of sheep herders, ag teachers, and working cowboys.\n\nOctober 28, 2020\n\nElmer Kelton has been a must read in the western genre for many years. My uncles introduced me to his titles when I first started reading. These short stories are awesome. They bring to life the people and places of an era when the land dictated your livelihood and the law was enforced with prejudice. If you've never read westerns, this is a great book to start with. If you love westerns as I do, what are you waiting for?\n\nFebruary 19, 2021\n\nThis book is a compilation of short stories. I really enjoy Kelton’s writing, but the stories were not very long, so they were over before I was able to get in to the characters. The stories were well plotted though, and I had read a couple of them before as they were taken from his full-length novels.\n\nSeptember 13, 2023\n\nI've been reluctant to read cowboy books as I always thought they were about gunslingers, Indian fighters, saloons, etc.\n\nHow wrong I was. This book highlights what a true cowboy really is. These stories were so wonderful and well written that each story was a pleasure to read.\n\nNormally, I donate my books after reading them, but this one is staying on my shelf.\n\nJanuary 26, 2021\n\nIn a similar vein as the Louis L’amour books in that they all have happy and tidy endings.\n\nJuly 29, 2021\n\nDecent anthology of old time western stories where honor is prominent."
