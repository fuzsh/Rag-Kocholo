        "text": "A new series on family-entertainment television network INSP showcases the lives of three cowboys in Alabama who are maintaining the common cowboy code while trying to make a living building a cattle business in South Alabama.\n\nToday's cowboys have to cope with long hours, injuries, and uncertain income, but the three men featured in The Cowboy Way: Alabama wouldn't want it any other way.\n\nTheir co-ownership of the Faith Cattle Company is based on unconditional support as well as a work-hard-play-hard philosophy.\n\nThe show airs in August, and has already been given the green light for a second season, notes Doug Butts, INSP's Senior Vice President of Programming, in a statement.\n\n\"During post-production, it became clear to everyone that we've got a great show on our hands,\" he says. \"These cowboys are the real deal: down-to-earth, likable and very entertaining. They are a band of brothers, and audiences will love them,\" he adds.\n\nBubba Thompson, a skilled carpenter, brings his charm, integrity, and strong work ethic to his cowboy life. Some TV viewers first met him as a runner-up on a southern-style dating show, although he has since relinquished his bachelor status and is happily married.\n\nCody Harris is a cowboy with a history on the rodeo circuit, where he won several championships in calf roping. Now retired from rodeo competition, he makes room in his cowboy life for work as a rodeo producer, father, and husband to a champion barrel racer.\n\nChris \"Booger\" Brown grew up on his family's farm, and has spent his life as a rancher. The series also highlights his skill as a horseman and a horse trainer, as well as his sense of humor which helps get him and his friends through the tough days of herding cattle and working fields.\n\nThe Cowboy Way: Alabama airs on Thursdays, at 8:00 p.m., Eastern, on INSP."
