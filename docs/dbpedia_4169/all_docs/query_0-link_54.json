        "text": "Bobby Marquez has a magnetic smile and refreshing tongue-in-cheek, but heartfelt, honky-tonk style that stirs an energy with audiences singing and dancing along. The Texas-born singer/songwriter is reaching crowds far and wide on radio, national television appearances and tours across the U.S., Australia and Ireland.\n\nIn 2018, Bobby Marquez was awarded the Academy of Western Artists Pure Country Male Vocalist award and the CMA of Texas Cowboy/Western Artist award. Both honors celebrate his self-penned tribute song, The Cowboy Way, which celebrates the lessons of standing by your beliefs and keeping your word.\n\nAn album by the same title, The Cowboy Way, features a duet with country music legend Johnny Rodriguez on an updated version of Riding My Thumb to Mexico, along with a duet with the Queen of Bluegrass, Rhonda Vincent on his self-penned song, For Awhile. The other tracks on the album, featuring original Bobby Marquez music, stay true to his catchy lyrics and moving melodies.\n\nBobby Marquez’s self-titled, debut album was not only chosen as the album of the year in European ‘Country Music People” magazine, but it was also a top-seller across the UK. The album produced the top ten Texas Chart and Music Row Chart hits, She’s Not From Texas and That’s Life.\n\nBobby Marquez has been seen on national television shows, Larry’s Country Diner, The Penny Gilley Show, Better Nashville, Cheyenne Country, Studio 23 Nashville and Country Fix. His music is heard worldwide on radio. Satellite listeners can tune-in to Willie’s Roadhouse for Marquez’s music.\n\nThe performer’s songwriting has been recorded by everyone from Alan Jackson and Ty Herndon to George Strait. Bobby has shared the stage with Ray Price, Mel Tillis, Johnny Rodriguez, Martina McBride, David Ball, Janie Fricke, Johnny Lee and Lonestar… just to name a few."
