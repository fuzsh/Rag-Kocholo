Grammy Award-winning, old-school western music group Riders in the Sky celebrates “Christmas the Cowboy Way” on stage Nov. 29 to kick off the holiday season at Door Community Auditorium.

For more than 30 years, this classic cowboy quartet has carried the flame passed on by Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, revitalizing the western music tradition. In “Christmas the Cowboy Way,” Riders in the Sky will infuse classic Christmas tunes with the open-plains spirit of cowboy music, sprinkling the evening with their western wit and down-home charm.

The program includes original songs like “Riding Home on Christmas Eve,” “Deck the Bunkhouse Walls” and “The Last Christmas Medley You’ll Ever Need to Hear.” The audience will be invited to join the Riders in traditional holiday tunes such as” I’ll Be Home for Christmas” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” All this yuletide spirit will be supplemented with the Riders’ classic western favorites.

Riders in the Sky have been performing together since 1977. In that time, it’s chalked up two Grammys, for Best Musical Album for Children in 2001 (for “Woody’s Roundup”) and 2003 (”Monsters, Inc. Scream Factory Favorites”), as well as over 6,100 concert appearances in all 50 states and 10 countries, appearing in venues from county fairs to the Hollywood Bowl. The foursome has been inducted into the Grand Ole Opry, and its music has been featured in motion pictures, including the Pixar animated movies “Toy Story 2” and “For the Birds,” and since 1988 it has hosted and performed live on its public radio show “Riders Radio Theater.”

Riders in the Sky presents “Christmas the Cowboy Way” at 7 p.m. Nov. 29 at Door Community Auditorium, 3926 Wisconsin 42, Fish Creek. Tickets are $22 to $38. For advance tickets or more information, visit the DCA box office, call (920) 868-2728 or go to www.dcauditorium.org.
