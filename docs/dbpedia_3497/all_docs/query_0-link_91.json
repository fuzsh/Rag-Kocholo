After the introduction of sound films, Spanish-language cinema thrived in the city’s downtown theatres, screening throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s in venues such as the Teatro Eléctrico, the California, the Roosevelt, the Mason, the Azteca, the Million Dollar, and the Mayan Theater, among others. Through the Mexican-owned distribution company, Azteca Films, Inc., Spanish-language films were distributed to hundreds of theatres in the United States. With the emergence and growth of Mexican and Argentine sound cinema in the early to mid-1930s, downtown Los Angeles quickly became the undisputed capital of Latin American cinema culture in the United States. Meanwhile, the advent of talkies in 1930 resulted in the Hollywood studios hiring local and international talent from Spain and Latin America, including Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba, for the production of films in Spanish. Parallel to these productions, a series of Spanish-language films was financed by independent producers who utilized Hollywood rental studios. Both Hollywood and independents contributed to the foundation of a Spanish-language film culture. By the mid-1930s, local producers and Latin American film companies supplied the growing local Spanish exhibition market in Los Angeles, while distributors sent films throughout the United States and Latin America. As a result, Los Angeles can be viewed as the most important hub in the United States for the production, distribution, and exhibition of films made in Spanish for Latin American audiences. Given the level of film production in Spanish, it is not surprising to learn that in the 1930s, the Hollywood film studios also trained Hispanic filmmakers and technicians for its “Cine Hispano” productions. Once production ended, many of them returned to their native countries and contributed significantly to the establishment of national cinemas in Latin America. Others left when the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) broke out and then had an impact on the Spanish film industry, once the war ended. The demand for Spanish-speaking actors to work in the “Cine Hispano” productions attracted Hispanic Hollywood talent, local stage performers and international actors who collaborated in the making of a very diverse American cinema that showcased the idiosyncrasies, traditions and cultures of Latin America and Spain. Among key figures were Mexican actors José Mojica, Ramón Novarro, Dolores del Río, Tito Guízar, Lupita Tovar and Lupe Vélez; Spanish writers, actors and directors included Edgar Neville, Conchita Montenegro, Juan Torena, José López Rubio, Miguel de Zárraga and Gregorio Martínez Sierra; and South American actors and directors Carlos Gardel, Mona Maris, Barry Norton, José Bohr, Car5\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nlos Borcosque and Tito Davison. Their work presented an on-screen reflection of Hispanic identity that has not been equaled since the advent of film talkies. Hollywood’s “Cine Hispano” was exhibited in U.S. theaters and distributed to the mass market of Spanish-speaking countries where it competed with the emergence of national film productions. For decades, the Spanish-language productions of Hollywood have been ignored by film historians, because nationalist Latin American film critics mercilessly attacked the films, even while some titles were embraced by local audiences. The arguments made against Hispano Hollywood focused on two issues that continue to inform discussions even today, namely, that Hollywood Anglos had been completely tone deaf when it came to employing Spanish-speaking actors from different countries with strongly identifiable regional accents. Secondly, Hollywood producers were indifferent to cultural differences between various Latin American countries, often mixing conflicting musical or cultural heritages. In the following pages, these criticisms come up repeatedly. At the same time, even nationalists have understood that despite its sometimes wrong-headed attempts at producing films for Spanish-speaking audiences, the industry trained a whole generation of film technicians who founded film industries that eventually competed against Hollywood. In 2013, the UCLA Film & Television Archive received a grant from the Getty Foundation to stage “Recuerdos de un cine en español: Latin American Cinema in Los Angeles, 1930-1960,” as a part of their citywide exhibition, Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA (Latin America/Los Angeles). That exhibition of nearly forty classic films from Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and Hollywood took place from 23 September to 10 December 2017. A curatorial committee, consisting of Colin Gunckel, María Elena de las Carreras, Alejandra Espasande Bouza and Jan-Christopher Horak, was responsible for programming the series, with many films preserved specifically for the program by the UCLA Film & Television Archive. Apart from the film program, screened at the Archive’s Billy Wilder Theatre, as well as at the Downtown Independent, formerly the Azteca Theatre, the project produced a catalogue and a book, Cinema Between Latin America and Los Angeles. Origins to 1960 (2019, Rutgers University Press), edited by Gunckel, Lisa Jarvinen, and Horak. As a prelude to the Fall series, and in conjunction with the 73rd FIAF Congress in Los Angeles, the UCLA Film & Television Archive and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences organized a symposium from 29 April to 3 May 2017 on the production of Spanish-language cinema during the “golden age” of the Hollywood studio system. “Hollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-language Cinema in Los Angeles” brought together scholars and film archivists from all over Latin America, Spain and the United States to discuss the many issues surrounding the creation of Hollywood’s “Cine Hispano.” The goal of the symposium was to explore the making of Spanish-language films by the Hollywood studios and U.S. and Mexican independent producers, seeking to capitalize on the Spanish-language market of the Americas and Spain. The symposium discussed filmmakers, stars, crafts people, exhibitors and distributors involved in production and circulation of U.S.-made Spanish-language films. Many of the papers were presented in Spanish with simultaneous English translations, while English speakers were translated into Spanish. The contributions presented at this two-day symposium are collected and partially revised here. In some cases, manuscripts have been rewritten for publication, in others, the\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nauthors chose to publish their symposium texts, albeit translated into English. The essays have been organized slightly differently than the presentations at the FIAF Conference. The volume is broken into two sections: “Exhibition, Distribution, Reception” and “Production.” The book begins properly with a study of the Los Angeles exhibition market for Spanish language cinema in the 1930s and 1940s. Acknowledging the pioneering work of Colin Gunckel, Horak presents a history of the rise and fall of Mexican cinema theatres in L.A.’s now razed Mexican neighborhoods around downtown Main Street. Until the late 1940s, the fortunes of these cinemas were connected to the work of Frank Fouce, the Azteca Film Company, and the Calderón Brothers, producer/distributor/exhibitors from El Paso and Chihuahua. Together, they created a system of production, distribution and exhibition which was completely out of the control of the Hollywood majors, despite being headquartered in its backyard, and can be viewed as constituting a major minority cinema. In contrast to Horak who focuses on exhibition in Los Angeles, Peruvian film researcher Violeta Núñez Gorriti analyzes distribution and exhibition of Hollywood’s Spanish-language films in four key Latin American markets, namely in Lima (Peru), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Montevideo (Uruguay), and Mexico City (Mexico). Núñez Gorriti looks at how local distributors, who had previously had monopolies on all exhibitions, were supplanted by a system of first- and second-run cinemas, which screened both Hollywood Spanish and English films. The absence of systematic information for other Latin American countries precludes incorporating other cities into this study. As a result, the findings here are provisional, until more data allows for a broader and more accurate understanding of the market, but it seems evident that Hollywood’s Spanish-language features were not rejected out of hand by local audiences. Catalan archivist and film historian Esteve Riambau looks at a different aspect of the reception of Hollywood Spanish-language cinema by analyzing reviews and comments in the well-known Spanish-language film magazine Cinelandia (1927-1936). Published in Los Angeles by the Spanish-American Publishing Co., the magazine addressed a largely female audience, while promoting American cinema in all Spanish-speaking markets. In contrast to the first two essays in this volume which attempt to relativize the alleged lack of popular success for Hollywood’s Hispanic productions, Riambau demonstrates that journalists usually led the charge against these films, undergirding the Hollywood Hispano project’s reputation as being an abject failure. The reception of a given film often has long-term consequences for the ultimate survival and preservation of a title. Given the oft-repeated negative reputation of Hollywood’s Hispano cinema, as well as extremely high mortality rates for all films produced in Hollywood in the early 1930s, it is not surprising to learn that the great majority of these films have been lost. Roberto Green Quintana looks at the challenges for film preservationists when dealing with Spanish-language film productions from this period. He discusses the work by the UCLA Film & Television Archive and others to preserve and make available films for the Fall 2017 film program, “Recuerdos de un cine en español: Latin American Cinema in Los Angeles,” while noting some of the film technical issues when working with this material.\n\n7\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nThe book’s second section, highlighting Spanish-language film production, begins with a key text, as demonstrated in the number of citations in this volume. Juan B. Heinink and Robert G. Dickson’s monograph, Cita en Hollywood (1990), is indeed the urtext for the history of Hollywood Hispanic cinema. In it, the authors document and briefly discuss every Spanish-language film made between 1929 and 1939, whether by the major Hollywood studios or by independent producers. Their Spanish-language essay in that volume is translated into English here for the first time and revised specifically for this publication, making this groundbreaking text available to non-Spanish speakers for the first time. Following these broad-based studies, the volume continues with essays on individual filmmakers and actors who played significant roles in the production of Spanish-language films in Hollywood in the 1930s, and then often returned to their native countries (or elsewhere), to help establish domestic film industries in Latin America. María Elena de las Carreras, for example, looks at the amazing career of the Chilean film director Carlos Borcosque, who after receiving training in Hollywood in the 1930s, cutting his teeth on Spanish-language films at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, went on to become one of Argentina’s most prolific and successful film directors of the studio era, completing over thirty feature films between 1939 and 1966. As in the case of almost all Latino directors, Borcosque earned a living and learned a craft, but had little possibility to develop his artistic persona, until he began making films in Argentina. The Director of the Cinemateca de Cuba in Havana, Luciano Castillo, on the other hand, looks at the Hollywood career of film director Ramón Peón, who directed Cuba’s most well known silent film, La Virgen de la Caridad (1930), before moving to Hollywood, and then establishing himself as a major force in the Mexican film industry of the 1940s and 1950s. In Hollywood, however, Castillo demonstrates that Peón, despite his previous accomplishments in Cuba, suffered long periods of unemployment at the margins of the industry, sometimes working as an assistant director, but also having to earn his keep as a street performer. Next, María Esperanza Vázquez Bernal and Xóchitl Fernández analyze the film career of Gabriel García Moreno, a Mexican film director who moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s after completing several silent films in Mexico. Once there, García Moreno became involved in the invention of motion picture technology, e.g., the Moreno-Snyder sound film camera, which he tried unsuccessfully to market. He next worked on inventing a low-cost color film process, but ultimately returned to Mexico City, where he designed and built a modern sound film studio for the Calderón Brothers in 1937, thus helping to create the infrastructure for a Mexican film industry. Among the Spanish-speaking actors who populated Hollywood’s Hispanic features in the early 1930s was the Spanish actor Romualdo Tirado. According to Alejandra Espasande Bouza, a film archivist at the Academy Film Archive and one of the co-curators of “Recuerdos de un cine en español: Latin American Cinema in Los Angeles, 1930-1960,” Tirado began his career as a child actor in Spain, but soon relocated to Mexico, later becoming a fixture in the Los Angeles Mexican theatre scene, while commuting regularly in the 1920s between the two cities. With the advent of Hispanic Hollywood features, Tirado advanced to a reliable character actor in literally dozens of Spanish-language films.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nNext, César Fratantoni looks at the case of Carlos Gardel, the Argentine tango singer, who may have had the most unique career in Spanish Hollywood. Cases of autonomy under the umbrella of a major studio are extremely rare in the Golden Age of Hollywood, the period ranging from the 1920s to the 1950s. Yet, in 1934 Carlos Gardel arrived in New York City and managed to control the production of four very successful Spanish-language films, using Paramount’s production facilities and distribution network. Thanks to newly discovered documentation, and the survival of many of his letters, we have a rare look at the challenges a Hispanic producer would face, if he tried to do business with one of the Big Five. One of the earliest independent Mexican producers working in Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1930s was the actor-director Guillermo Calles. Rogelio Agrasánchez Jr.’s essay on the Native American film star, who began his career in Hollywood before World War I, is adapted from his book, Guillermo Calles: A Biography of the Actor and Mexican Cinema Pioneer (2010). In his contribution, Agrasánchez theorizes that the actor suffered descrimination as an actor and director, due to his ethnic origins, and, despite several successful films as director, could not find appropriate work in Hollywood. Rosario Vidal Bonifaz, from the University of Guadalajara, discusses the amazing career of Mexican opera star José Mojica, certainly the most prolific and successful of the Latin stars in Hollywood. A native from Jalisco, José Mojica became one of the most important tenors of his time, and a star at the Fox Film Corporation between 1930 and 1934, when the company attempted to capture the Hispanic markets through popular musicals. The author reviews the short, yet sparkling, film career of Mojica and its impact on some Latin American markets (Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Spain). Vidal Bonifaz concludes with a short analysis of La cruz y la espada (1934), one of the few Spanish-language films that has survived in its full-length version; the film is also considered by some to be the reason why, years later, its leading man decided to quit Hollywood and withdraw to a Peruvian monastery. Catalan professor and film scholar Núria Bou’s presentation analyzes the acting style of Conchita Montenegro in La femme et le pantin (1929, Jacques de Baroncelli) and her Hollywood films (1930-1935). The author postulates that La femme et le pantin and her American films were more erotic and risqué than any films she made in Hollywood for Spanish-speaking audiences. Through textual and comparative analysis, the essay demonstrates how the “American performance style” influenced her subsequent film work, and the impact that this approach also had on the reception of her films in Spain. According to Spanish journalist and historian Mar Díaz Martínez, Antonio Moreno´s story is one that should not be forgotten: he embodied the American dream, like very few in the silent era, but his life and career were changed dramatically after the arrival of sound, not because of his voice, but because of his American-accented Spanish. His filmography, starting with D.W. Griffith and ending with John Ford, is a fascinating trip through classic Hollywood cinema, a master class in demonstrating how unfair film history can be to stars who don´t become legends. But Antonio Moreno deserves to become a legend, once his story has been properly told.\n\n9\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nEduardo de la Vega Alfaro’s essay relates the previously unknown history of the production of Contrabando (1932), shot by Mexicans in Tijuana and Baja California at the moment when Hispanic cinema made in Hollywood had reached its apex. Financed by the politician, soldier, and revolutionary Agustín Olachea Avilés, the film visualizes the rebellion of a group conspirators opposing the elected government, after the murder of General Álvaro Obregón Salido. Produced both in Spanish and English versions, the film was an early attempt to utilize conventions developed in the “Mecca of Film,” in order to create a nationalist cinema, while also competing directly with the most powerful film industry in the world. Finally, Mexican film studies professor Bernd Hausberger offers a fascinating footnote on the aborted career of Celia Villa, a daughter of the Mexican revolutionary politician Pancho Villa. Capitalizing on the notoriety of her father, especially in the United States, Celia Villa attempted to parlay her connections into a Hollywood film career, especially after she was hired for the publicity tour of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s Viva Villa! (1934, Jack Conway). However, as Hausberger notes, Celia Villa was also represented in the press as an exotic “other,” her public persona formed by ethnic- and gender-inflected stereotypes, which mitigated her career. The volume closes with a complete bibliography of all sources, and a list of the Spanish-language films produced between 1929 and 1939, as well as short biographies of the contributors to this volume. It is hoped that the historical research presented here will contribute to an expansion of historical interest in the long-neglected Spanish cinema of Hollywood in the 1930s.\n\n10\n\nI Exhibition, Distribution, Reception\n\nCreating a Minority Cinema: Spanish-Language Film Exhibition in Downtown Los Angeles before World War II Jan-Christopher Horak SPANISH-LANGUAGE CINEMA IN LOS ANGELES On May 20, 1932, the Teatro California on Main Street in downtown Los Angeles presented the local premiere of Mexico’s first “National” sound feature fiction film, Santa (1932), directed by Antonio Moreno and starring Lupita Tovar, both of whom had substantial careers in Hollywood. The film had previously premiered in Mexico City (30 March) and El Paso, Texas (16 May), at a hugely successful midnight screening, but it seems clear from the publicity push that the L.A. premiere was to introduce Mexican cinema to a worldwide audience. Only Los Angeles could boast an international corps of film journalists who could potentially carry the news of the Mexican achievement to the rest of the globe. According to an article in La Opinión, Santa was coproduced by José and Rafael Calderón, who brought the film to Los Angeles and probably financed the premiere, which drew an A-list of Hollywood personalities, including Tovar, José Mojica, Mona Maris, Laurel and Hardy, Barry Norton, Ramón Pereda, Julio Peña, Juan Torena, Paul Ellis and Carlos Villarías. Mojica and the Mexican Consul, Mr. Joaquín Terrazas, were named official hosts.1 The movie pre-show featured local artists, including the popular baritone Rodolfo Hoyos, the tenor Manuel Maytorena and the Pasadas Sisters, directed by Ernesto González Jiménez. The theatre was decorated with huge portraits of the film’s stars, Tovar, Moreno and Carlos Orellana, and the crowds jockeyed to see and talk to their favorite Spanish-speaking actors,2 while critics in the next morning’s papers praised the film for its realism and its melodrama. As La Opinión wrote:\n\n1 2\n\nPremiere announcement in La Opinión, 20 May 1932, 6; see also La Opinión, 29 May 1932, 4. Rogelio Agrasánchez Jr., Mexican Movies in the United States. A History of the Film Theaters and Audiences 1920-1960 (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Company, 2006), 50ff.\n\n13\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nWe are positive that the Mexican community, almost in its entirety, will attend the California Theater. We know that Mexicans want to see the movie not only for its merits, but also because it’s the first one, because it tells a touching story, and, mainly, because it’s a Mexican film.3 The L.A. premiere of Santa embodies an early moment in the history of a vibrant cinema culture that has all but disappeared in Los Angeles, namely Spanish-language cinema in downtown’s first- and second-run theatres on Main Street. Spanish-language films were in fact screened at numerous cinemas throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, with the great majority of these films originating from Mexico, followed by Argentina, Spain, Los Angeles and Cuba, all of which maintained indigenous film industries. With ticket prices rarely exceeding ten and fifteen cents, going to the cinema was a family affair for Mexican-American audiences, who flocked there with children and grandparents in tow to see images from home and hear their mother tongue. In these cinemas, Latinos/ Latinas became producers of spaces for dialogue, which were unique and separate from the institutionalized culture and politics of Anglo-America. The cinemas of Mexico and Argentina in the classic studio period 1930-1960 are no longer the terra incognita they once were, thanks to the work of a number of younger film scholars who have freed themselves the prejudicial notion that all Latin American cinema before the Cuban Revolution was nothing more than pale imitations of Hollywood in Spanish.4 Nevertheless, there is still much work to be done, both in terms of analyzing the surviving films as cultural products in an international market, and, especially, in terms of the history of distribution and exhibition of these films within and outside Latin America. Thanks to the groundbreaking work of such scholars as Rogelio Agrasánchez Jr., Colin Gunckel and Lisa Jarvinen, we now know that the Los Angeles film market was of some significance to Mexican-Americans in Southern California and Texas.5 And from Agrasánchez we also learn that nearly five hundred cinemas in the United States showed Spanish-language films at least occasionally in this time period.6 However, it was while conducting research for the Getty Foundation-funded film program, “Recuerdos de un cine en español: Latin American Cinema in Los Angeles, 1930-1960,” as a part of Pacific Standard Time: LA / LA, that I became aware of just how extensive the penetration of Latin American cinema into the American market had been. In point of fact, it is almost shocking to realize that virtually 100% of Mexico’s film production received play dates in the Los Angeles film market in the 1930s and 1940s. As a result, Los Angeles was not only the most important showcase for Spanish-language films in the United States, but also provided a window to Latin America and the world on Mexican and Argentine cinema. Indeed, through Latin American film\n\n3 4 5 6\n\n\"El estreno de Santa en el T. California,\" in La Opinión, 22 May 1932, 4.

Spanish-language theatres, but misses the Arrow, which in 1940 was renamed Teatro Azteca.\n\n14\n\nCreating a Minority Cinema: Spanish-Language Film Exhibition in Downtown Los Angeles before World War II\n\njournalists working in Los Angeles and covering the American film scene, it is likely that national film distributors and exhibitors in Latin America would have been well-informed about which films were successful in the belly of the beast. Furthermore, Los Angeles was not only a center of Spanish-language film exhibition, but also a not-insignificant producer of Spanish-language films in the 1930s, both studio-contracted and independent film productions. Furthermore, Vermont Street in Los Angeles became the headquarters for the two major distributors of Latin American films in the United States: Azteca Films, Inc., and Clasa-Mohme, Inc. Functioning efficiently at the level of production, distribution and exhibition, L.A.’s Spanish-language cinema thus reveals the contours of a completely intact minority cinema in the United States, which operated independently of the American studio majors, who supposedly had a monopoly at all levels of the film industry. To my knowledge, such a concept of a minority cinema in the United States has previously only been discussed in the literature in terms of African-American cinema in the so-called “race film era,” while Spanish-language cinema has been perceived as existing only in the margins, and not as a functioning system. In fact, though under-capitalized and subject to economic intrusions, this cinema was able to survive for more than three decades outside the institutional infrastructure of mainstream American cinema, i.e., Hollywood. Just how was it possible to create an intact and generally stable infrastructure for the production, distribution, and exhibition of Spanish-language features in Los Angeles, largely outside Hollywood’s centripetal power? Obviously, a demand for Spanish-language culture, whether film, theatre or press, manifested itself in the empirical presence of Spanish-speaking audiences, hungry for films in their native tongue.7 Such an audience already existed when audiences flocked to Main Street theatres to see Spanish-language versions of American films, and more importantly, Spanish-language popular theatre.8 Once American interest in Spanish version productions waned, the Mexican film industry and some U.S. independents increasingly met the growing demand for Latin American cinema. The start was slow, even after the worldwide success of Santa. But by the late 1930s, the number of community cinemas had increased from zero to five. At the same time, Argentina’s film industry made huge inroads into the Spanish L.A. market, without Mexican film producers losing ground, because audience demand had supported a growing number of Spanish-language cinemas. Moving all these foreign language productions into the American film market involved a distribution system, which grew ever larger from the 1930s to the 1940s. Finally, reliable screening spaces had to be available. While there were a number of cinemas screening Spanish-language films in the early 1930s, the exhibition market did not stabilize until after 1933, when the Depression’s grip on the film industry slowly weak-\n\n7 8\n\nSee oral history with Lilia Guízar, the daughter of Tito Guízar, and her husband Ramón Inclán, a film critic in the 1950s for La Opinión.

It was with the reestablishment of the Teatro California as a first-run house that Frank Fouce entered into L.A.’s exhibition market. His empire would by the end of the thirties grow to five theatres, then begin shrinking again in the post-war period, but remain a vibrant part of the community until the 1960s, when television and other external factors upended most Spanish-language film theatres. This essay, then, will first address the existence of a Spanish-language cinema culture in Los Angeles in the 1930s and 1940s, then discuss the distribution of Spanish-language films in North America, and close with a statistical analysis of national cinemas and trends for exhibition in the local theatrical market of Los Angeles. As was the case with Hollywood, Spanish-language cinema in Los Angeles was above all a popular cinema, encompassing many different genres and stars, the latter moving freely between film studios in Mexico City, Hollywood, Buenos Aires, and even Madrid. Unlike some Mexican film historians who remain narrowly focused on a handful of films from Mexico’s Golden Age, I have analyzed all advertisements and short “reviews” in La Opinión for the years 1930-1942 to ascertain not only which Spanish- language films premiered and were reprised, but also to ascertain that audiences were grateful for all kinds of films in Spanish, even those “version films” produced in Hollywood at the beginning of the sound era. I thereby modify the established wisdom promulgated by nationalist film critics and intellectuals that such films were deeply unpopular with audiences. Utilizing empirical data from advertisements allows us to define the contours of Spanish-language cinema in the United States as a minority cinema, catering to the needs of recent immigrants from Latin America, as well as Spanish-speaking Americans. I have limited my research to the pre-World War II period, as a matter of convenience, but also because structural changes in the Mexican community after World War II, connected to urban renewal and the expulsion of Mexicans from the city center, changed the terms of this minority cinema. After World War II, Los Angeles city fathers approved the destruction of downtown Mexican neighborhoods, and with them several Mexican theatres, so that the city could project an Anglo-Saxon image that would attract immigrants from the mid-western United Sates. As a result, the cultural spaces for community dialogue moved to other real and virtual sites, including new Spanish-language television networks.\n\nEMPRESA FOUCE The Los Angeles Spanish-language theatre market cannot be separated from the name of Francisco (“Frank”) Fouce. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, of Spanish parents on 26 October 1899, Fouce immigrated with them to Los Angeles in 1902.9 Growing up in Los Angeles, Fouce began working in the film industry as a child actor, according to family sources.10 When he was fourteen, his dad, Antonio Fouce, died, only forty-eight years old,11 possibly forcing Frank’s mother to run a boarding house with furnished rooms just blocks from\n\n9 10 11\n\nAn obituary for Fouce’s mother, ‘Loyisa’ (sic) Fouce, actually Luisa, states she “moved to California thirty-eight years ago.” See Los Angeles Times, 25 August 1938, 36. His Los Angeles Times obituary states that he was a silent film actor at one time, but probably only as an extra or bit player, since no actual credits could be found. See Fouce obituary, Los Angeles Times, 13 January 1962. California Death Certificate, 14 January 1914, Los Angeles, CA (Ancestry.com). Antonio Fouce applied for citizenship in October 1905 and affirmed he had entered the United States via San Francisco on 22 March 1902.

The 1920 U.S. census lists Fouce as living at home with his mother Luisa, his brother Manuel, his sister Dolores, and her two children, with Fouce’s occupation given as motion picture timer in a lab. He married Anna Rosen that same year on New Year’s Eve.12 City directories list Frank as living at home until 1926, his occupation variously listed as machinist (1917), clerk (1921) and manager of the Gay Theatre (1925) on N. Main St.13 According to some sources, he became manager of the Teatro Alegría on Main Street in 1925.14 In 1927, Fouce is listed as a motion picture director, living on N. Plymouth Blvd. in Hollywood. A year later he moved back to downtown L.A. (408 ½ Boylston St.) and was working in a film lab (1929). He next managed the Teatro Estella (1930), a legitimate Spanish-language stage. While his address in the City Directory was listed as Boylston St., a 1930 census document notes that Fouce and his wife were again living with his mother and he was unemployed.15 By 1932, Fouce and his wife Anna had moved back to Hollywood (Lodi Place), right in the shadow of Columbia’s Gower Studios, indicating an improvement in his financial situation. When the Calderóns opened Santa in May 1932, Fouce was working for Columbia, possibly in their Spanish-language film production unit, and it is probable he had helped negotiate the deal with the California, since Carne de cabaret (1931, Christy Cabanne) and two other Spanish Columbia features had been screened at the California in 1931. Sometime after the Santa premiere, Fouce established his own distribution company, Spanish International Pictures (SIP), which continued to operate at least on paper until 1936.16 Prior to acquiring the California in 1933, Fouce purchased local distribution rights to La voluntad del muerto (1930, George Melford), Drácula (1931, George Melford), Resurrección (1931, Edwin Carewe), Don Juan diplomático (1931, George Melford), and Contrabando (1932, Alberto Méndez Bernal, Raymond Wells). Once he acquired the California, Fouce initially only showed films for which he had purchased local rights. Like Santa and La Llorona (1933, Ramón Peón) many SIP films were also distributed by Azteca.17 I’ve dwelt on Frank Fouce’s biography in some detail, because it demonstrates that Fouce moved at the fringes of the film industry, and, given changing jobs, was not in an economically secure position, at least through his twenties and early thirties. The question then becomes, how was Fouce able to build up a theatrical empire in a few short years and during the depths of the Depression? Fouce must have received loans or financing from someone. As will be demonstrated below, I’m relatively certain that it was the Calderón Brothers who helped Fouce, better said that Fouce may have initially been a representative for the Calderón family operations, whose goal it was to create a theatrical market for Mexican films in Los Angeles. Fouce leased the California in August 1933, and three months later the Teatro Eléctrico. In November 1934, he added the Hidalgo as a second-run space. By 1938, he had become the most important Spanish-language exhibitor in the city, operating the Cal-\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17\n\nSee 1920 United States Federal Census, and California County Birth, Death, Marriage Records, 1849-1940 (Ancestry.com).

The California usually ran as a first-run house, the Mason presented live theatrical shows, while the other two theatres functioned as second-run, although Fouce would often open a big film in all three Main Street cinemas at once, as he did when on 9 February 1938 he opened Bajo el cielo de México (1937), Fernando de Fuentes’s sequel to Allá en el rancho grande (1936).18 Fouce also still occasionally utilized the Teatro México, on South Main Street, which he had leased in 1935, programming, e.g., Tito Guízar’s Mis dos amores (1938, Nick Grinde) there in June 1939.19 The Arrow/Azteca opened in late March 1939 and was utilized as both a first- and second-run theatre, putting the Roosevelt out of commission at least for a few years.20 In 1944, Fouce purchased the Liberty Theatre at 136 S. Main St., while leasing the Mayan on South Hill St., and purchasing the Mason in 1946, which he had previously leased.21 In March 1949, Fouce purchased the Mayan and a year later he leased the Million Dollar Theatre from the Harry Popkin Organization, while continuing to operate the California and Mason. By the time he died on 11 January 1962, Frank Fouce had also branched out into Spanish-language broadcasting, owning KXETV in San Diego and numerous other stations that became a part of Univision.\n\nL.A.’S MAIN STREET SPANISH-LANGUAGE CINEMAS When the California Theatre opened its doors at 810 S. Main Street on Christmas Eve 1918 with a screening of Douglas Fairbanks’ The Americano (1918, John Emerson), it had a seating capacity of 1900, making it one of the largest cinemas in the city.22 Owner Fred Miller and manager Harry Leonhardt immediately received praise for their elaborate stage and film presentations and the orchestral music of Carli Elinor,23 making it a direct competitor to Sid Grauman’s only recently opened movie palace, the Million Dollar. In October 1919, Samuel Goldwyn, looking for a first-run theatre in Los Angeles, leased the California and installed Samuel (“Roxy”) Rothafel, who reopened the theatre on 7 November 1919 with Goldwyn’s Flame of the Desert (1919, Reginald Barker). But Rothafel’s tenure was short-lived: in January 1920, he moved on to Chicago, although the California remained a Goldwyn house under Fred Miller’s direction, as an advertisement from 1922 documents.24 By 1925, though, diminishing profits forced Miller to close the theatre, while he managed others, like the Alhambra, Figueroa, and, beginning in 1927, the Carthay Circle. Then in May 1930, Miller decided to reopen the California, initially showing American films. However, within four months, Miller had changed the name to the California International25 and apparently signed contracts with some of the major studios to release their Spanish-language versions, since it then became a first-run theatre in October and\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nLa Opinión, 9 February 1938, 4.

After the world premiere in February 1932 of Columbia’s Hombres en mi vida, (1932, David Selman), starring Lupe Vélez and Gilbert Roland, the California went dark. In March the theatre was leased to Albert E. Finger, who opened the Yiddish-language feature, His Wife’s Lover (1931, Sidney M. Goldin) on 7 March; a short-lived endeavor.26 What had happened? The fact that only four studio-produced Spanish-language features opened in the first five months of 1932 meant the production pipeline had dried up. This fact is in accordance with previous research on Hollywood’s production of Spanish-version films, which has noted the cessation of most version production after 1931. The closing of the California may have also had something to do with the worsening Depression, which left huge numbers of Mexican-Americans unemployed and destitute. According to statistics, wholly one-third of L.A.’s Spanish-speaking audience of 150,000 was deported by zealous Federal authorities, working ironically in conjunction with the Mexican Consulate, which endeavored to repatriate citizens.27 This was not the first intrusion into the Mexican-American community and would certainly not be the last. Main Street’s film culture would physically disappear in the next wave of anti-Mexican, anti-immigrant policy. In the post-World War II period, the Los Angeles city fathers in cooperation with the federal government accelerated urban renewal in the Bunker Hill and North Main Street Mexican area, “clearing out neighborhoods and literally splitting communities with freeways;” urban renewal in L.A. meant Mexican removal.28 In Spring 1932, Rafael Calderón was initially unable to find a screen to show Santa, because the California, the only acceptable theatre in the community, was closed. The California was subsequently procured through the intervention of Frank Fouce. Supposedly, the California’s manager, Mr. Finger, who had leased the theatre in March from its owner, Fred Miller, was not interested in showing Mexican films, but only Yiddish-language films, which he had a hand in distributing.29 This narrative may be partially apocryphal, since Finger literally only programmed one film at the California in March, but as La Opinión noted about the Santa premiere: “A foreign company is in charge of the opening of the film. This company is run by a man named Finger, who has shown Jewish films at the California before.”30 The question remains, to what degree Frank Fouce was involved in the premiere, beyond helping broker the rental, and if his association with the Calderóns began at that time or had begun earlier.\n\n26\n\n27 28 29 30\n\nHis Wife’s Lover was announced for a two-week run, but may have only played a week. The presentation included two Yiddish shorts and a stage show. No other screenings could be documented. Finger was not a film man, but a salesman, who may have lost his shirt. He apparently still had a lease on the California when Santa premiered, and therefore handled the theatre logistics for the premiere, according to press reports. Sánchez, 123.

La Opinión, 1 May 1932, 7.\n\n19\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nIn the Summer of ’32, many in the Mexican community hoped that Santa’s two-week run, followed by the first run of Guillermo Calles’s Regeneración (1930, Guillermo Calles), would lead to a revival of the California as a Spanish-language house; it was not to be. The California would remain, except for a brief run of revivals in early 1933, dark until August, when Frank Fouce finally acquired the theatre. The California reopened on 14 September 1933 with another Calderón distributed property, La Llorona (1933, Ramón Peón). Just as Santa had been a Calderón distributed “national production,” so too was La Llorona advertised as a national production. After purchasing the theatre from Fred Miller, Fouce installed new projectors, a Western Electric sound system, and renovated the whole theatre, including new paintings, new drapes, upholstery, and new carpets. In announcing the reopening of the California, Fouce stated: “The California will be totally renovated for the new season. No expense has been spared, as we believe that it’s our duty to give the Mexican community a venue worthy of their culture and their finesse.”31 Interestingly, despite the fact that there were no regular screenings of Spanish-language films at the time, La Opinión pushed back on Fouce even before La Llorona’s premiere: “Unfortunately, there are class divisions. As a result, middle-class and upper-class audiences will attend the California, while Mexican working classes will attend the Hidalgo Theatre, because of its location and the nature of its shows.”32 As in the case of the Santa premiere, La Llorona’s premiere was preceded by a live stage show. Fouce followed up with a premiere on 28 September of La sombra de Pancho Villa (1932, Miguel Contreras Torres), a patriotic film about the Mexican revolution, and with a biopic of the famous Mexican composer Juventino Rosas, Sobre las olas (1933, Miguel Zacarías), on Columbus Day; all three films were distributed by Fouce’s Spanish International Pictures. The California would continue as a flagship theatre of the Empresa Fouce until January 1, 1949.33 Two days later, the Broder Association of Detroit (Jack Broder) opened the theatre with the reprise of a Jorge Negrete film and continued Spanish-language programming through the 1950s.34 The theatre was then purchased by Bruce Corwin and the Metropolitan Theatre chain, programming Mexican films into the 1970s, according to Colin Gunckel, who also dates the cinema’s demise in 1987, after a final stint as a Pussycat Theatre.35 Less than three months after opening the California, Fouce took over the management of the Teatro Eléctrico, with programming commencing on 30 November 1933 with La Llorona. The cinema first appears in the 1913 Los Angeles City Directory as the Electric Theatre, located at 212 N. Main Street, M.M. Hurwitz proprietor.36 It would change hands several times over the next decade, until Harry Ewing acquired it in 1922.37 Ewing, who also owned the Estella Theatre and after 1930, the Hidalgo, programmed the Electric with popular Mexican theatre, including zarzuelas, and occasionally films. The cinema was wired for sound in 1930, advertising itself as “El Teatro de sonido perfecto,” reprising Sombras de gloria (1930, Andrew L. Stone) in September, but programming of\n\n31 32 33 34 35 36 37\n\nLa Opinión, 24 August 1933, 4. La Opinión, 6 September 1933, 4.

Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library.\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nfilms remained extremely irregular, often going dark between second-run screenings of Spanish and American films. In November 1933, Fouce took over, renaming it Teatro Eléctrico. As it seated only 345 patrons, Fouce ran the same sequence of films at the Eléctrico that he had previously opened at the California, at least until February 1935 when Fouce premiered Juárez y Maximiliano (1933, Miguel Contreras Torres, Raphael J. Sevilla) at all three Fouce houses simultaneously, which by then included the Hidalgo. Sometimes, the Eléctrico would double bill a Spanish feature with an American film, as it did in September 1936 when Celos (1935, Arcady Boytler) was paired with Times Square Playboy (1936, William McGann). The Eléctrico would continue as second-run for the California and co-premiere house with the California and Hidalgo, until the theatre was renamed the Roosevelt in April 1940. The Teatro Hidalgo was the oldest and possibly most ragged theatre in the Mexican community. Located at 373 North Main, where the 101 Freeway now intersects the street, its urban Mexican neighborhood North and South of the Hidalgo long demolished. A photo taken on 25-26 November 1931 of the Hidalgo—those are the dates that José Mojica’s Cuando el amor ríe (1930, David Howard, William J. Scully) was reprised there—shows the theatre sandwiched between a mom and pop grocery store and a dancing hall. Most of the buildings on the block are two-story, with a larger three-story structure just South of the theatre, housing a Mexican dentist, the Farmacia Hidalgo at 363 N. Main (which regularly advertised in La Opinión) and a hotel. The large windows above the marquee are dark and curtainless. The marquee, with its single ring of lights around Teatro Hidalgo in relief, looks like it could date from the nickelodeon era. The dark entrance leads into a theatre space that accommodated 750 patrons. It is unclear when the Hidalgo was built, but it starts making an appearance in 1914 in City Directories. It was from the start a legitimate theatre for Mexican folk productions, but also presented films regularly. At the dawn of the sound era, the theatre changed hands several times. In July 1930, Meyer Tallis, who had owned the theatre since April 1925, sold it to a consortium, including Romualdo Tirado, Ernesto González Jiménez and Arturo Pallais Jr., all well-known theatrical figures in the Mexican-American community through their management of the Teatro México. Five months later, in November 1930, the owner of the Estella and Electric, Mr. Harry E. Ewing, bought the Hidalgo, renovated it, and installed new Western Electric sound film projectors. The first sound film to be shown there was Sombras de gloria in April 1930. But film screenings remained irregular until after the 27 November 1930 reopening with a reprise of Paramount’s El cuerpo del delito (1930, Cyril Gardner, A. Washington Pezet), becoming a reliable second-run house and even occasionally premiering films, like Benito Perojo’s El embrujo de Sevilla (1931), a Spanish film produced in Germany. By March 1932, Carlos Emanuel had purchased the theatre, showing Spanish-language films until he sold the Hidalgo to Frank Fouce in August 1934. Fouce continued to utilize the Hidalgo as a second-run, but abandoned the space in May 1936, with Ramón Peón’s Padre querido (1935) being the last film screened. It was demolished that same year. In early 1937, Frank Fouce acquired the Roosevelt Theatre, a space seating 800 persons. Located at 842 S. Main Street, the theatre had been built in 1913 and was called the Miller Theatre after its owner Fred Miller. He leased the theatre to others for several\n\n22\n\nCreating a Minority Cinema: Spanish-Language Film Exhibition in Downtown Los Angeles before World War II\n\nyears in the later teens, then sold it in 1924, although it continued to be called the Miller until 1926. From 1929 to 1932, it was called the Triangle Theatre and managed by Samuel H. Human. In 1932, a Main Theatre at that address briefly advertised in La Opinión as “El cine de las familas,” but showing second-run American titles.38 In January 1937, La Opinión featured an advertisement, noting that the Roosevelt Theatre would soon present “2 grandes películas” and would be a family theatre, but it was not until May that the Roosevelt is listed as an Empresa Fouce cinema. It began screening films on 2 July 1937 when ¡Ora Ponciano! (1936, Gabriel Soria) premiered there, as well as at the California and Eléctrico.39 Fouce closed the theatre in April 1939 after México lindo (1938, Ramón Pereda) had premiered there. Almost exactly a year later, on 3 April 1940, the Roosevelt moved to a new location at 212 N. Main Street, the space previously occupied by the Eléctrico. Like its former namesake, the Roosevelt continued to operate as a first- and second-run house throughout the 1940s, although it was only a fraction of the size. Fouce shuttered the theatre on 31 October 1949 and it was demolished in 1960. Beginning in September 1938, the Mason Opera House was listed as an Empresa Frank Fouce theatre. However, it wasn’t until three years later, 11 September 1941, that Fouce inaugurated regular programming of Spanish features with a reprise of Cantinflas’s Ni sangre, ni arena (1941, Alejandro Galindo), renaming the house the Teatro Mason. Located at 127 S. Broadway, the Mason Opera House had been built in 1903 with more than 1500 seats and was operated for more than two decades by the A.L. Erlanger organization, hosting many of this country’s most famous legitimate stage actors. Sold in 1928, the Opera House was managed by Chester N. Sutton in the early 1930s. In the early 1940s, Fouce programmed mostly older features as reprises, but by 1943 it had become a firstrun house with films premiering there and at the California or at the Liberty. In January 1946, Fouce purchased the theatre from Louisa B. and H.V. Hoffman, after having leased it for eight years;40 he also added a new marquee “Home of Mexican Films,” allowing the theatre to stand out from the other small businesses on the block. Once Fouce gave up the California and opened the Mayan in March 1949, the Mason again became a second-run space, and remained so after Fouce purchased the Million Dollar in 1950. Fouce closed the Mason in December 1954. It was demolished the next year.41 Frank Fouce’s final acquisition in the 1930s was the Arrow Theatre, which he purchased in March 1939. Opened as a legitimate theatre in 1925, the 550-seat house was located at 251 N. Main St. It was operated by a variety of individuals in the late 1920s, but in 1930, Carl H. Drane became manager; the Arrow reprised Sombras de gloria in November and Así es la vida (1930, George J. Crone) in December, but these were oneoffs. Between March and September 1936, the Arrow under the management of Walter and John Menard attempted some reprises of older Spanish-language films, but regular programming did not begin again until Fouce inaugurated the theatre on 22 March 1939 with the Spanish version of Snow White, Blanca Nieves (1937, Walt Disney), followed by\n\n38 39 40 41\n\nLa Opinión, 18 September 1932, 7.

Fouce operated the Arrow, which he renamed the Azteca in March 1940, as a second-run theatre until May 1941, when he abandoned the space. The new name reflected his wish to identify the theatre as embedded in the Mexican community, but may have also been a nod to his distributor and probable financial partner, Azteca Films. The only competition to the Empresa Francisco Fouce were the cinemas of James C. Quinn, who operated the Monterey on Whittier Blvd. in East Los Angeles, the Unique on 1st Street in Boyle Heights, and, beginning in December 1940, the Teatro Vernon on Vernon Street, just South of Downtown in Huntington Park; all were suburban theatres that offered split-week American-Spanish programming.42 The Unique began programming Mexican films in August 1939, while the Monterey opened on 24 September 1939, both of them functioning as third- and fourth-run theatres.43 While the Vernon’s Spanish-language programs closed after only a year, in December 1941, the other two theatres remained neighborhood third-run Spanish houses through the end of the 1950s.\n\nAZTECA FILM DISTRIBUTION Thus, in the period under question, from 1930 to 1942, the Spanish-language film market expanded in Los Angeles from at times zero cinemas to seven screens at the end of the decade. This incredible growth of Mexican-American screens was only possible because there was a significant audience of native speakers. Amazingly, new films from Mexico could not alone satisfy that growing market. According to Agrasánchez, the demand for Mexican films was so great because contract laborers and other immigrants again began flooding into the United States, thanks to the subsiding effects of the Depression.44 Frank Fouce and other community theater owners increasing turned to screening older films, which had proved themselves popular in the past. The L.A. theatrical market for Spanish-language films thus functioned both as a site of discovery for new Latin American and Spanish feature films, and for the remembering of classic hits from the past. Both acts of reception functioned directly on the local level, on the national level through the distribution of La Opinión and its reportage of the cine scene, and on the international level via the reports of Latin American correspondents, all of which benefited distributors of Spanish-language film “product.” The creation of a Spanish-speaking exhibition market would not have been possible without a functioning distribution system. While La Opinión advertisements in many cases did not list distributors, it is clear that Azteca Films had a virtual monopoly on distribution of Mexican films to the United States.45 In point of fact, just as the Hollywood majors con-\n\n42 43 44 45\n\nLa Opinión, 22 December 1949, sec. 2, 3.

However, no listing or address could be found in either the Motion Picture Almanac or the Film Daily Yearbook. According to an article in Variety, Cinexport was based in New York, where company head José Guerrero also owned the Teatro Hispano, at 136th St. and 5th Avenue, and attempted to organize a Spanish-language theatre circuit in New York City. See Variety, 29 June 1938.\n\n24\n\nCreating a Minority Cinema: Spanish-Language Film Exhibition in Downtown Los Angeles before World War II\n\ntrolled film exhibition in the United States through vertically structured companies that included production and distribution, so, too, did Mexican-Americans monopolize the Los Angeles Spanish-language theatrical film market through control of theatres, distribution, and, increasingly, production.46 The key to understanding that system is the relationship between Frank Fouce and the Calderón Brothers, which began some time before the premiere of the first Mexican sound film in Los Angeles, Santa (1932). Even before the premiere of Santa, the Calderón Brothers had been active in film exhibition and distribution in the United States. José and Rafael Calderón had started out as exhibitors in Chihuahua, Mexico, in the 1920s, then expanded across the border to El Paso and San Antonio, Texas.47 By the 1930s, they had moved into production with José’s son, Pedro A. Calderón, producing films, like La Zandunga (1938, Fernando de Fuentes), and into owning their own studios and laboratories in Mexico City.48 With capital from the Calderón Brothers, Frank Fouce was probably able to purchase the California; the Empresa Fouce expanded with the acquisition of the Hidalgo, the Electric and México, while Fouce apparently kept his hand in distribution. His letterhead in 1938 not only included the names of his theatres, but also “Spanish International Pictures. Motion Picture Producers, Brokers, & Distributors;” the film titles listed on the letter’s left margins being titles also distributed by Azteca, indicating that in fact Fouce’s company and the Calderón Brothers’ operations were economically linked, if not identical.49 The Calderón family connections to Los Angeles ran deep. An older brother of José Calderón, Mauricio, had moved to the city prior to World War I and operated a music store on North Main Street with a music publishing business, Repertorio Musical Mexicano, which soon became a hub for Mexican musicians working in the recording industry.50 Knowledge of that business probably encouraged the Calderóns to produce films with popular music, once sound came in, but also allowed them to gauge prospects in the growing film industry. Azteca Film Inc. was founded in 1931 by José and Rafael Calderón, along with Alberto Salas Porras, in El Paso, Texas, with a Los Angeles office located at 1906 Vermont Avenue. Rubén Antonio Calderón, Rafael’s son, was named Manager, and Gustavo Acosta, another blood relative, as Booker for the L.A. Exchange. Acosta later worked for Columbia’s Latin American distribution office, and was probably responsible for brokering a deal for Columbia to distribute many of the Calderón films in Mexico in 1947. Interestingly, the Azteca logo on film advertisements listed El Paso as its headquarters, possibly because Rafael Calderón was still identified as President in trade address books, although he primarily directed the mother ship, the Calderón exhibition operations: the Circuito Alcazar. It is likely that the distribution business for both North\n\n46 47 48\n\n49 50\n\nSee “Lo que ha dado; lo que dará « Azteca Films »,” in La Opinión, 2 January 1938, sec. 2, 3, which notes that Azteca had the concession for all premieres of “our national cinema” in Los Angeles since 1935. A spreadsheet from 1957 for Los Chiflados del Rock and Roll shows that the Calderóns owned twenty-five theatres in Mexico at that time. Calderón Estate Collection, Permanencia Voluntaria. In an interview with La Opinión, Rafael Calderón announced the purchase of the National Studios in Mexico City, and that Azteca Films would distribute new Mexican films to the American Southwest. See “Del cine en México”, La Opinión, 18 March 1934, sec. 2, 3. The Calderón family remained in the film-producing business until the late 1980s, and were responsible for producing literally hundreds of films, many in later years exploitation titles.

Azteca Films then “began boosting the film industry in Mexico, buying as many films as it could,” as well as distribution offices in San Antonio, Denver, Chicago, and New York. Azteca’s work was clearly perceived as promoting the interests of Mexican culture.52 In 1939, the Los Angeles exchange was sending out an average of twenty films a day to cinemas in California, Arizona and Nevada. In 1944, ownership of the L.A. office of Azteca was transferred to Rubén and his brother, Guillermo Calderón (with Porras), including a catalog of 136 films, a significant number yet to be released.53 Azteca had a virtual monopoly on Argentine films through a deal with Argentina Sono Film. When Azteca was nationalized by the Mexican government in 1954, the Cinematográfica Mexicana Exportadora (CIMEX) underpaid $ 1.7 million for the distribution company; at the time, Azteca owned more than 600 titles from Mexico. As Agrasánchez notes, “Azteca operated practically without competition from 1932 until 1942…”54 In 1942, Clasa-Mohme, a distributor founded by Gustav Mohme and Clasa Films, opened a distribution office on Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, and was soon competing successfully against Azteca, inaugurating a new phase in the American Spanish-language film market. While the premiere of Santa led to the Mexicanization of the L.A. Spanish-language film market, beginning in late 1933, that market first formed with the production of Spanish-language films by the American majors. Three distinct phases thus mark the development of that exhibition market in the 1930s: (1) 1930-33, when Hollywood produced and distributed Spanish “talkers” and theatres were still owned by Anglo-Americans; (2) 1934-37, when films produced in Mexico began to dominate the market and Mexican-Americans acquired their own theatres; (3) 1938-1942, when the market became increasingly diverse with productions from Argentina, Cuba, Mexico, Spain, and local independently produced films vying for attention.\n\nHOLLYWOOD VERSION PRODUCTION Except for 1930, when less than thirty Spanish-language films were screened in Los Angeles, some of them still silent, the number of sound films screened per year averaged between fifty and sixty until 1935. Through 1933, the great majority of these films were supplied by the Hollywood majors, who initially premiered Spanish films in their own first-run theatres, but quickly switched to the Mexican theatres on Main Street. However, independent producers, often working with local Mexican directors, also supplied films to that market. Hollywood stopped producing Spanish versions of their English-language films by 1932, except Fox, which had set up a Spanish-language film unit to produce original films in Spanish, and Paramount’s Paris and Astoria operations, where Spanish “talkers” continued to be produced until at least 1935. In 1934, as studio production\n\n51 52 53 54\n\nSee “Salió a Texas el señor Calderón,” in La Opinión, 2 December 1939, 4.

Thus, while Los Angeles had seen thirty-eight films from Hollywood in 1933, thirteen films from Mexico and two from Spain, 1934 brought thirty-one Mexican films, twenty-one American-produced Spanish films, and one from Spain/Germany to the city. Given the lack of screening opportunities described above, it is not surprising that many Hollywood Spanish-language films only played for two or three runs. However, there were also major hits: Sombras de gloria, independently produced by Sono-Art Productions at the Metropolitan Studios, opened at the Fox Criterion in January 1930, and was then reprised at least fifteen times that same year, including runs at the Hidalgo, México, Eléctrico and Arrow. Almost as successful with ten runs was Así es la vida, also independently produced at Metropolitan by Sono-Art, and El vuelo de la muerte (1933), Guillermo Calles’ independent Mexican-American production, with eight runs. Only a few studio films reached that last bar, and they were mostly Fox films starring Mexican opera and recording star José Mojica: El precio de un beso (1930, James Tinling, Marcel Silver), Fox’s Spanish version of One Mad Kiss (1930, Marcel Silver, James Tinling), La ley del harem (1931, Lewis Seiler), Melodía prohibida (1933, Frank Strayer) and La cruz y la espada (1934, Frank Strayer). Also moderately successful were Carne de cabaret (1931), Columbia’s Spanish version of Ten Cents a Dance (1931, Lionel Barrymore) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s La Mujer X (1931), the Spanish version of Madame X (1929, Lionel Barrymore) directed by Carlos F. Borcosque, the Chilean director who would help build the Argentine film industry a few years later. Thus, of the 176 American films produced and screened in Los Angeles before 1934, only the handful mentioned above enjoyed very successful runs. On the other hand, only 11% of Hollywood-produced films tanked completely in their first run. Obviously, the income generated from the Mexican community (and apparently from Latin America) was insufficient for the accountants in the major studios, but the numbers suggest we must modify slightly the established wisdom that Latin American audiences in general, and Mexican-American Angelenos in particular, completely failed to embrace Hollywood’s efforts. It should also be noted that unlike early Mexican films, e.g., Santa and La Llorona, Hollywood’s product was seldom reprised in later years, but that may have had more to do with Azteca as monopoly distributor than their lack of popularity.\n\nTHE RISE OF MEXICAN CINEMA IN LOS ANGELES The period 1934-1937 saw both the establishment of the first Mexican-American owned cinemas through Frank Fouce and a major uptick in film production in Mexico after the runaway success of Allá en el Rancho Grande. Fouce began operating the Hidalgo and the California, then expanded to include the Eléctrico, the Arrow, and occasionally the México during this period. As a result, the number of Spanish-language films screened increased from 54 films in 1934 to 67 films in 1937. At the same time, the percentage of Mexican films increased from 54% in 1934 to 83% in 1937, while independent American films replaced studio product, remaining steady at around 35% until 1937, when it dropped to 13%. The first major hit in the L.A. market was Gabriel Soria’s Chucho el roto (1934), which opened at the Hidalgo in April 1934, and then was reprised ten times by 1938 and another ten times through 1942. A year later, in October 1935, Madre querida (1935, Juan Orol) premiered at the California and was then reprised fourteen times through 1942. Allá en el 27\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nRancho Grande (1936) opened at the California and Eléctrico simultaneously in February 1937 and was reprised twenty-three times. Only slightly less successful was another Gabriel Soria film, ¡Ora Ponciano! (1936), which opened simultaneously at the California, Eléctrico, and Roosevelt in July 1937 and was reprised fourteen times. Other hits included Fernando de Fuentes’ Bajo el cielo de México (1937) with fifteen runs, Jalisco nunca pierde (1937, Chano Urueta) and Amapola del camino (1937, Juan Bustillo Oro), both with thirteen runs. At the same time, Mexican films were not uniformly successful, with as many as thirty-two films during this period screening less than twice after their initial L.A. premiere. Meanwhile, except for Miguel Contreras Torres’ independently produced American feature, No matarás (1935), with eight runs, American films continued to underperform, usually not reaching more than three or four reprises. Thus, it seems clear that Latino audiences in Los Angeles preferred films with folkloric themes that emphasized Mexicanidad and were popular entertainments, rather than art films. For example, classics of the Golden Age, like Arcady Boytlers’ La mujer del puerto (1935), Fuentes’ El fantasma del convento (1934) and Vámonos con Pancho Villa (1935) underperformed, compared to more popular fare. Overall, about 12% of Mexican films released failed to garner more than a few runs, which still seems an acceptable failure rate, given the intense competition.\n\nARGENTINA RISES With an increase in the number of screens in the immediate pre-World War II period, the overall number of Latin American films screened in the local Los Angeles market increased significantly, including not only films from Mexico but also from Argentina, Spain, Cuba and Latino producers in Los Angeles. The number of available screens expanded in part due to new Spanish-language programming at the three suburban theatres owned by James C. Quinn, but also because Fouce’s cinemas were running at full capacity for the first time. As a result of this rise in capacity, the number of Spanish-language films screened in Los Angeles jumped from 85 to 197 films between 1938 and 1942, with the number of playdates exploding from 184 to 520. While the number of Los Angeles premieres only increased slightly from 46 in 1938 to 71 in 1942, the number of reprises increased geometrically from 138 to 449. That increase was possible because of Quinn’s second- and third-run theatres, but also because Azteca made many more older films available. Thus, a popular film, like Chano Urueta’s Jalisco nunca pierde (1937), which opened in September 1937 at the California, Roosevelt and Eléctrico, and was reprised in all three theatres during the course of 1938, enjoyed further runs at the Arrow in 1939, at the California and Roosevelt in 1941, and at the Unique and Monterey in 1941. Other very popular Mexican films in this period, garnering more than ten playdates, were: Mientras México duerme (1938, Alejandro Galindo), La casa del ogro (1938, Fernando de Fuentes), Diablillos de arrabal (1938, Adela Sequeyro), El capitán aventurero (1938, Arcady Boytler), Mi madrecita (1940, Francisco Elías), Cuando los hijos se van (1941, Juan Bustillo Oro) and El gendarme desconocido (1941, Miguel M. Delgado). Including a comedy with Cantinflas, a musical with Mojica, and a crime drama with Arturo de Córdova, this list reveals a broadening of audience tastes over previous years, when the comedias rancheras predominated.\n\n28\n\nCreating a Minority Cinema: Spanish-Language Film Exhibition in Downtown Los Angeles before World War II\n\nIn the same time period, the percentage of films from Mexico decreased from 87% in 1938 to 58% in 1942, a significant drop, due both to a cut in production in Mexico, but also because of increased demand for Spanish-language cinema, which Azteca met by distributing new films from Cuba and, most importantly, Argentina. The real drop in the percentage of Mexican films occurred in 1940, when the number of Argentine films jumped from an average of five to nine films in the years 1935-39 to twenty-nine in 1940, fifty-eight in 1941 and fifty-seven in 1942. This is somewhat surprising, given that Argentine films performed on average significantly less well than Mexican films. Except for La ley que olvidaron (1938, José A. Ferreyra), which opened at the California in July 1940 and was reprised more than nine times until 1942, many Argentine films averaged only two or three reprises and some less, thus failing at the box-office. Unlike Mexican films, which often premiered in Los Angeles only weeks after their Mexican openings, Argentine films were often released with a two- or three-year delay, which may account for a drop in their success. Thus, Manuel Romero’s Fuera de la ley (1937) opened at the California in March 1941, while Melodías porteñas (1937, Luis Moglia Barth) premiered in June at the same theatre. On the other hand, Luis César Amadori’s El pobre Pérez (1937) opened in April 1940 and went on to six reprises before the end of 1942. Other successful Argentine films included La vida es un tango (1939, Manuel Romero) with seven play dates, Caminito de gloria (1939. Luis César Amadori) with six dates, Puerta cerrada (1939, Luis Saslavsky) with seven, Doce mujeres (1939, Luis Moglia Barth) with seven, and El matrero (1940, Orestes Caviglia) with six in 1941-42. Except for Doce mujeres, all these films seem to feature specifically Argentine subjects (tango, the pampas), which may account for their popularity. As noted, the box-office numbers for popular Argentine films lagged by half behind the numbers of the most popular Mexican films. In 1939, films from Spain also had a brief boost in popularity. Whereas only two to five Spanish films screened per year in the 1930s, eleven films opened in Los Angeles from Spain in 1939, possibly the result of the end of the Spanish Civil War, which made international commerce feasible again. Since the number again dropped in 1940, one can assume that interest may have peaked for local audiences. Mostly directed by Florián Rey or Benito Perojo, titles from Spain performed less strongly than Argentine titles. Only two films achieved box-office numbers equal to Mexican films, namely La hermana San Sulpicio (1934), a religious film, and Nobleza baturra (1935), both starring international star Imperio Argentina and directed by Florián Rey. Independently produced American Spanish-language films enjoyed a second vogue in 1940, with no less than eighteen titles premiering that year. As Lisa Jarvinen and others have noted, these films produced between 1938 and 1940 proved to be the last gasp of American-made Spanish-language films. In contrast to the early 1930s, when Hollywood’s Spanish-language films were only marginally successful or flops, most of the films from the later period managed to achieve at least results similar to the Argentines. The following titles, including three films starring Tito Guízar, had at least seven runs in L.A. until the end of 1942: Verbena trágica (1939, Charles Lamont), Mis dos amores (1939, Nick Grinde), Papá soltero (1939, Richard Harlan), and El otro soy yo (1939, Richard Harlan). El milagro de la Calle Mayor (1939, Steve Sekely), and Odio (1940, William Rowland) achieved at least ten playdates, equaling some of the most successful Mexican films. The evidence indicates that these independent American films performed better than\n\n29\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\ntheir reputation in the literature. The last-named title, Odio, was distributed in L.A. as a Mexican film, marking a future trend whereby American capital shifted to Mexican film production in the 1940s and 1950s. 1940-41 also saw the distribution of at least eleven Cuban films, although almost 50% apparently flopped. One can assume that given the low level of capitalization in the film industry of Havana, low production values may have played a role in these box-office duds. The remainder, however, were modest successes with four to six runs, including Ahora seremos felices (1938, Fred Bain, William L. Nolte), La canción del regreso (1939, Max Tosquella, Sergio Miro), Estampas habaneras (1939, Jaime Salvador), Cancionero cubano (1940, Jaime Salvador). All of the films were comedy romances with lots of Afro-Cuban music, while Estampas was screened at the California in July 1940 under the title Chaflán en La Habana, as it was in Mexico, to cash in on Mexican star Carlos (“Chaflán”) López’s minor role in the film.55 Nevertheless, the very fact that Cuban films were distributed in the L.A. market belies previous historical givens, and bolsters the argument of Luciano Castillo that there was a foreign reception of pre-revolutionary Cuban films. In the 1950s, Mexican producers would increasingly invest in Cuban film productions, including Yambaó (1957, Alfredo B. Crevenna), produced by Rubén Calderón, and Santo contra el cerebro del mal (1961, Joselito Rodríguez), produced by Rubén’s cousin, Jorge García Besné.\n\nCONCLUSION In this essay, I have endeavored to document the exhibition of Spanish-language cinema in a specific locale, namely Los Angeles, produced in Mexico, Spain, Argentina, Cuba and the United States in the pre-World War II sound period. I have documented the history of Mexican film theatres on and off Main Street in downtown Los Angeles, operated by Frank Fouce, but probably financed by José Calderón, a Texas and Chihuahua-based film exhibitor, hoping to create a market in America for Mexican films. As a result, L.A.’s mostly Mexican audiences viewed virtually 100% of Mexico’s film production in the 1930s, but also representative stars and popular film genres from five Spanish-speaking countries; this reception space therefore can be considered a transnational space, embedded in the larger Anglo-American space of Hollywood mainstream cinema. I have further demonstrated that Azteca Films, the distribution arm of the Calderón Brothers’ empire, dominated the American market for Latin American films, at least until 1942. In outlining the contours of an intact and functioning Spanish-language film industry, consisting of film exhibition, distribution and production, and based in Los Angeles, I demonstrate that the Hollywood majors did not have an absolute monopoly on film production and reception. Rather, what we are viewing must be understood as a vibrant minority cinema, established literally in the backyard of Hollywood.\n\n55\n\nSee advertisement for Chaflán en la Habana in La Opinión, Vol. 14, No. 310, 21 July 1940, sec. 2, 3.\n\n30\n\nHollywood’s Spanish-Language Movies in Buenos Aires, Lima, Montevideo, and Mexico City Violeta Núñez Gorritti METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH This paper is a first attempt to analyze the distribution-exhibition process in four cities in Latin America of Spanish-language films produced by Hollywood. Three are located in South America: Lima, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, while Mexico City is in North America. The absence of systematic information from other cities prevents us, for the moment, to realize a broader, more accurate understanding of the process and reach final conclusions. The rise of talking pictures in the late 1920s brought with it a number of problems that had to be solved. One was language. Not everyone understood English. The need to make films intelligible for foreign audiences caused Hollywood producers to film the same film in different languages. Between 1929 and 1939, about 175 feature films and a significant number of shorts were made in Spanish and distributed throughout the Americas and Spain. In many cases, the Spanish versions were exhibited before the original version was released. To define the Spanish talking pictures made by Hollywood studios, we used Cita en Hollywood, published by Juan B. Heinink and Robert G. Dickson. In order to undertake a comparative study of distribution and exhibition, we consulted Mexican, Peruvian and Uruguayan “Billboard cinematographic” information, but, unfortunately, found only partial information for Argentina. Film distribution in the silent period was generally organized via “Cinematographic Programs” that were substantially modified when talking pictures started. The Programs, amalgamated by distributors, procured films from different companies and countries, creating an extensive distribution-exhibition circuit. The most important and famous in South America was Max Glücksmann’s Program from Argentina, which had an influence on Chile, Peru and Uruguay. After the rise of talking pictures, older distributors no longer had access to Hollywood films, because American companies opened exchanges in almost every country. In many cases the Programs were subsumed under Mexican and Argentine film distribution, while in others, they disappeared. The distribution circuit was maintained, but was reorganized to meet new needs imposed from Hollywood. As\n\n31\n\nCarlos Gardel and Rosita Moreno, El día que me quieras (1935, John Reinhardt).\n\nHollywood’s Spanish-Language Movies in Buenos Aires, Lima, Montevideo, and Mexico City\n\na general premise, we will theorize that the distribution-exhibition of Hollywood Spanish-language films contributed to redefining the interests of “the Mecca of Cinema.” To better explain the process of change we will take as an example the city of Lima, Peru.\n\nDISTRIBUTION-EXHIBITION IN LIMA As in many Latin American countries, the projection of moving images arrived in Lima in 1897, shortly after their introduction. Film exhibition was initially organized after 1900 by theatrical entrepreneurs. In 1908, with the opening of urban spaces for theatrical film exhibition, promoted and financed by native capital, the arrangement was permanently formalized. Foreign distribution began to influence the Lima market in 1911. In September, Pathé signed a contract with the General Cinematographic Society SGC of Buenos Aires. A determining factor in the configuration of the market was the exclusivity of cinematographic programs. The emergence of the Cinema Theater Company, the International Film Company, and the entrance into the local market of Argentina’s General Cinematographic Society resulted in a reordering of the market that was steadily growing. In 1915, the Empresa del Cinema Teatro and the Compañía Internacional Cinematográfica were founded; both extended their market reach to Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile, where they opened branches. In 1917, Universal Pictures announced a direct deal for cinemas in the newspaper El Comercio. Soon, Max Glücksmann’s Free Program and the Sociedad Anónima Cinematográfica Sud Americana, both from Argentina, settled in Lima. The distribution companies offered theater owners a program of films from different countries and companies, especially from Hollywood. In order to receive it, the cinemas had to work exclusively with that company, and also had to save a place in the exhibition circuit. In advertising, the smaller cinemas announced that the program “was the same” as projected in the main theaters. The cinemas paid distributors for the program, either through a daily rent or a percentage of the box-office. The distributor offered a feature film, plus short films and newsreels to complete the program. The film market in Lima between 1897-1929, corresponding to the silent period, was complex. It was organized according to the category of the theater, the origin and prestige of the production company (Metro, First National, Universal, etc.), the economic performance of the hall, and the genre of the film. The top-tiered movies were premiered in a circuit of five first-class theaters, located in the city center, called “circuit head,” giving rise to a particular name for that circuit, for example the “Excelsior Circuit.” The cinemas needed to offer a varied and attractive bill and were required to change programming daily. For matinees, films for children and young ladies were projected, reserving vermouth and evenings for premieres, or for events focusing on a specific audience, e.g., “for males only”. Each first-class theater premiered a minimum of two films a week. The premieres on Tuesdays and Thursdays included vermouth. After the first premiere, the film went to a main hall in a neighborhood for a second premiere, and was then programmed in other smaller theaters, until it completed a circuit that could be extended for a period of 33\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\none month to more than fifty movie theaters. Previous feature releases were programmed again in the following weeks, as second-run. Perhaps this system was influenced by the theater tradition where each troupe that arrived in a city brought a new repertoire but released the previous season’s hits. Other films from previous seasons were reprised, given their original success. Finally, due to these successes, there were annual releases of films. From the silent period 1897-1929, Lima inherited approximately fifty-three movie theaters, built in its main urban centers; twenty-one of these premises were opened in the early years of the 1910s. By the end of the 1930s, there would be eighty cinema theaters. Talking pictures first opened in December 1929. The adaptation to new sound cinema systems was a gradual process. The investment required to purchase new equipment involved costs that exhibitors initially rejected. The reluctance to accept talking pictures was thus strengthened by the economic crisis that occurred as a result of the 1929 Wall Street Crash, and the political instability caused by the fall of the Leguía regime in Peru. Furthermore, there was major resistance to new film lease conditions, motivating the creation of the Association of Cinematographic Exhibitors in 1931, in defense of their interests. Many theaters preferred to program silent films from the old programs before submitting to the new norms; such was the case of the Sala San Martín, which became a faithful defender of silent films. Also, the musicians of the Lima Society demanded the stop of talking pictures, because sound films eliminated the need for their services. In spite of these facts, all theaters in Lima had sound equipment by the end of 1933.\n\nAUDIENCES AND CINEMATOGRAPHIC INFRASTRUCTURE In 1930, Lima had 350,000 inhabitants, but by the end of the decade it had 500,000. It had sixty-five urban cinemas, which expanded to eighty locations in 1940. In 1930, the population of Mexico City was 1,230,000 inhabitants, which grew to 1,758,000 by 1940. Cinemas in the urban centers increased from twenty to forty-two locations between 1930 and 1939. The population of Buenos Aires was 1,575,000 inhabitants by the end of the 1920s, rising to 2,415,142 in the next decade. Over five hundred movie theaters dotted the province of Buenos Aires. The population of Montevideo in 1930 was 481,725 inhabitants with eighty theaters. By 1940, the population had risen to 708,852 inhabitants, while the number of cinemas remained the same. Between 1930-1939, 3,698 feature films were released in Lima, 3,142 in Montevideo and 3,141 in Mexico City. Hollywood dominated 75% of all distribution, leaving little margin for competitors, including native producers who were in the process of expanding. We note that Lima, despite having a lower population, exhibited more films than its Latin American peers.\n\n34\n\nHollywood’s Spanish-Language Movies in Buenos Aires, Lima, Montevideo, and Mexico City\n\nFeature films released in Lima, Montevideo and Mexico City 1930-1939 Year\n\nLima\n\nMontevideo\n\nMéxico City\n\n1930\n\n287\n\n176\n\n244\n\n1931\n\n238\n\n228\n\n244\n\n1932\n\n263\n\n246\n\n278\n\n1933\n\n321\n\n294\n\n275\n\n1934\n\n372\n\n287\n\n348\n\n1935\n\n415\n\n307\n\n286\n\n1936\n\n452\n\n304\n\n389\n\n1937\n\n459\n\n396\n\n388\n\n1938\n\n456\n\n428\n\n284\n\n1939\n\n435\n\n376\n\n405\n\nTotal\n\n3698\n\n3142\n\n3141\n\nLatin American-produced talking pictures entered the market in 1933. In the 1930s, Lima exhibited 167 Mexican, 112 Argentine, and 41 Peruvian films. Montevideo screened 121 Argentine and 15 Mexican films. Mexico City offered 160 domestic titles and 19 Argentine films. These numbers were substantially modified in the next decade. Between 1936-1940, a total of 27,367,888 tickets were sold in movie theaters nationwide in Peru. In Montevideo in the 1930s, tickets sold amounted to more than 46 million; in both cases we do not know gross ticket sales, nor have we found similar information for Buenos Aires or Mexico City.\n\nSPANISH-LANGUAGE HOLLYWOOD CINEMA: FIGURES AND CONSTANTS As is known, Hollywood companies made around 175 Spanish-talking feature films between 1930 and 1939. We have found that 154 of these films were distributed in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Lima and Montevideo; specifically, 137 were released in Lima, 115 in Montevideo, and 97 in Mexico City. The numbers for Buenos Aires were too incomplete to allow for a figure. The Spanish-language films of Hollywood were premiered in Lima as an “exclusive” with the same sumptuousness and publicity as English-language American product. The first Spanish-talking feature, produced by Paramount, El cuerpo del delito (1930, Cyril Gardner, A. Washington Pezet) opened on August 12, 1930 at the Teatro Princesa, an exclusive first-run Paramount cinema. It was followed by Charros, gauchos y manolas (1930, Xavier Cugat), Amor audaz (1929, Louis J. Gasnier), Cascarrabias (1929, Cyril Gardner), Drácula (1931, George Melford), El proceso de Mary Dugan (1931, Marcel De Sano) and Nada más que una mujer (1934, Harry Lachman). Lima cinemagoers could hear comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy say in Spanish “to the races” in La vida nocturna (1930, James Parrott) and Una noche de duendes (1930, James Parrott), and hear Buster Keaton in Spanish in\n\n35\n\nHollywood Goes Latin: Spanish-Language Cinema in Los Angeles\n\nEstrellados (1930, Edward Sedgwick) and ¡De frente, marchen! (1930, Edward Sedgwick). They could hear and see Carlos Gardel in his films, which made his Lima fans even more delirious since they already knew him through his records. The premieres of Spanish-talking pictures followed similar pre-existing patterns. Metro, Warner, and Universal features premiered at the Teatro Colón and Cine Teatro Excelsior, and Paramount films at the Teatro Princesa. Given the reluctance of cinema owners to adapt new technical sound systems and the new rules of the game, many Lima cinemas did not exhibit these films until later, after they adapted to sound. In the early years of the decade the premiere of the films were featured as “exclusives” in a single theater with all the pomp and pageantry necessary. When Hollywood reduced its interest in the production of films in Spanish they stopped such elaborate treatment and premieres were scheduled in theaters of less importance, similar to Mexican and Argentine films, leaving the largest cinemas in each city reserved for English-language Hollywood features. In Mexico City, the first Spanish sound film to premiere was Sombras de gloria (1929, Andrew L. Stone), on January 30, 1930. In the case of Montevideo, it was El cuerpo del delito (1930, Cyril Gardner, A. Washington Pezet), which premiered on June 20. Columbia, Fox, Metro, Paramount, Universal and Warner contributed 135 films, representing 88.23% of the total distributed. We note that only twenty-seven modified the exhibition title.
