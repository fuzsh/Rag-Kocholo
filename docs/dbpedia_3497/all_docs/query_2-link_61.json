The music featured in a film, usually referred to as that film's \"score,\" comes in later during the filmmaking process, most likely during the post-production phase (although there are some exceptions), so it is usually not given much thought until a film has wrapped production. Similarly, a film's audience doesn't usually put too much stock into a film's score, choosing to focus on other, more visible aspects, such as the acting, VFX, or cinematography, instead. But in reality, music can make or break a movie, and finding the right score for your film is a crucial part of filmmaking.\n\nThe history of film scores predates even the invention of sound in film, as filmmakers realized they not only needed something aural that could accompany the visuals of a film to stimulate audiences but also something that would mask the sounds that the projector would make whenever a film would be shown. Prior to the invention of sound, an in-house pianist or orchestra would provide the score for a film to give audiences the full audiovisual experience. Upon the invention of sound in film and prior to the inclusion of recorded dialogue in movies in 1927, films would only feature scores as their only aural element, with filmmakers recruiting composers to write bespoke music for their films. Since then, film scores have come leaps and bounds, perfectly integrating and amalgamating with imagery, dialogue, and sound effects to create the perfect moviegoing experience for audiences everywhere.\n\nNowadays, most filmmakers work closely with a composer to build a score for a film, deciding on the right tone, direction, and sound that would best fit their film. These scores are composed in-house with a full orchestra, and may also feature vocalists in addition to both acoustic and electronic instruments. They come in a wide range of genres depending on the genre of the film itself. For example, a Western film will most likely feature a Western-inspired score, while a historical war epic will feature a score with a more orchestral, hard-hitting approach. Nowadays, filmmakers have also cultivated close working relationships with composers and regularly work with the same composer for a number of films. A prime example would be Christopher Nolan, who consistently works with either Hans Zimmer (Interstellar and Inception) or Ludwig Göransson (Tenet and Oppenheimer) on a regular basis.\n\nThroughout the past century, film scores have started to gain more relevance and momentum in film circles, and they are now recognized as not only tools to elevate a film, emphasizing its themes and highlighting its performances but also works of art in their own right. The very first Academy Award for Best Original Score was awarded to Victor Schertzinger and Gus Kahn for their work on One Night in Love in 1935, and many more have been handed out to composers since then. These days, a film's score will also get released on streaming, as well as on vinyl to appeal to a wide market of collectors and score aficionados.\n\nWe at #RedSeaFilmFoundation recognize the importance of scores in film and we are proud to announce that the next edition of our Lab series, ‘Music For Film’, will focus on composing and scoring.
