        "text": "On this Page 8\n\n[?]\n\nWITH FOOTLIGHT AND MOVIE STARS ]\n\nGossip 'Twixt Shadow and Shine\n\nA Spanish Role.\n\n'Fascination,' the latest Mae Murray\n\nproduction, reveals the famous star in the\n\nmost ambitious of her roles. No other\n\ncharacter that she has portrayed requires\n\nas much difficult emotional acting as ''Fas\n\ncination,' which is opening at the Prince\n\nof Wales Theatre to-morrow. Altogether\n\nit marks a new- step in her career, a step\n\nin the direction of tensely emotional drama.\n\n'Fascination' is by Edmund Goulding,\n\nwho wrote Miss Murray's successful 'Pea-\n\ncock Alley' from a story of Ouida Ber\n\nsere.- Most of the scenes are laid in\n\nSnaiu. Miss Murray appears as Dolores\n\nDo Lisa, the daughter of a Spanish father\n\nand an. American mother. She seeks im\n\nmunity from the rigid restrictions of her\n\nSpanish home, and joins the crowds going\n\nto the Easter Day bull fight. ? There she\n\nbecomes fascinated by a handsome torea\n\ndor, and this fascination leads- her into a\n\nseries of vivid adventures. The star exe\n\ncutes some remarkable dance studies, and\n\nher magnificent gowns cannot fail to at\n\ntract attention. '\n\nAll Star Casit. .\n\nThose photoplay lovers, and they are\n\nmany,- who made acquaintance with Sir\n\nAnthony Hope 's famous characters in\n\n'Prisoner of Zenda' will be delighted to\n\nknow that they all return to the screen\n\nagain in the celebrated sequel production^\n\n'IRupert of Hentzau,' who commences a\n\nseason at the Majestic Theatre to-morrow.\n\nSuch celebrated players as EJaine Ham\n\ninerstein, Lew Cody, Bert Lytell, Hobart\n\nBosworth, Claire Windsor, Bryant Wash\n\nburn, Marjorie Daw, Mitchell Lewis,\n\nAdolphe Menjou, and Gertrude Astor enact\n\nprincipal parts. It is held to be the first\n\ngenuine all celebrity cast ever assembled\n\nin any motion picture.\n\nTheatre Royal's Prologue.\n\nDressed in the character of Robert Stev\n\nens, the broken artist, Rod'Mobney will be\n\nthe centre of interest in a prologue to ' ' The\n\nFace on the Barroom Floor,' at the Theatre'\n\nRoyal to-morrow. He will recite the dra\n\nmatic poem, 'The Face on the Barroom\n\nFloor, ' ' with special musical effects by 'the\n\nRoyal, orchestra.\n\nThe Davis Cup.\n\nThe following is a copy of th.e circular\n\nletter issued by the management of the\n\nTheatre Royal to the secretaries of Perth's\n\nnumerous tennis clubs and associations. It\n\nshould prove of interest to the tennis en\n\nthusiasts: — 'I have pleasure in informing\n\nyou that, on next Saturday, November 24,\n\n1923, we will be screening for one week\n\nonly, in addition to our ordinary film pro\n\ngramme, a very excellent and exclusive\n\nfilm of the contest for the last Davis Cup.\n\nI might mention that throughout the East\n\nern States, this film has been spoken of as\n\nbeing highly instructive, besides interest\n\ning, to all tennis players and supporters of\n\nvthe game. The whole tournament is faith\n\nfully depicted, taking about 20 minutes to\n\nscreen, and every stroke of the players,\n\nboth in the singles and doubles (Anderson\n\nand Hawkes v. Tilden and Williams), is\n\nshown, both at ordinary film rate, and in\n\nslow motion, which enables onlookers to\n\nhave a view of all angles of the play. The\n\nfamous trophy itself, the Davis Cup, is also\n\nshown, and of more than usual interest\n\nare the picture studies of each player in\n\naction, particularly the wizardy of Tilden\n\nand the vigorous service of Anderson. The\n\nvalue of the film to players so far away\n\nfrom the scene of the contest cannot be\n\ntoo highly stressed, and as these pictures\n\nare solely exclusive to the Theatre Royal,\n\nno other opportunity will be afforded the\n\nmembers of clubs of seeing it, beyond, of\n\ncourse, country clubs. I would be glad if\n\nyou would be good enough to bring this\n\nmatter before your club members— -if prac\n\nticable this circular might be posted on\n\nyour notice hoard — as there may be cer\n\ntain among them desirous 'of making up\n\nparties during the week, or individual mem\n\nbers who would wish to see. the film. Seats\n\nmay be reserved for either the matinee or\n\nnight show by ringing A2317. In any\n\nevent, I would appreciate a telephone call,\n\nor visit from you, if convenient, but I\n\nhave no hesitation in saying that f rom_ the\n\npoint of view of a tennis enthusiast this is\n\nan excellent opportunity of witnessing # a\n\nthorough pieturisation of the nmeh dis\n\ncussed match.'\n\nA Freak Turn.\n\nBreit Hart, German strong man, import\n\ned for Keith's vaudeville, has opened in\n\nNew York. Though lacking a showmau\n\nly finish in presentation, some of his feats\n\nare sensational. He bites links of chains\n\nin two with his teeth and drives nails into\n\na plank with his fists. For a concluding\n\nexhibition he lies prone on top of spikes\n\nupstanding from wood, while allowing a\n\nhorse ridden by men to walk over a plat\n\nform upheld by him. A committee of\n\nabout 25 men from the audience acts as\n\ninspectors upon the stage. Thd turn is a\n\nfreak but not a fake.\n\nOnly an Actor. :\n\nWalter George, head of the Sunshine\n\nPlayers, tells' many interesting stories of\n\nactual experiences whieh he has, met with\n\nin different parts of the world. The fol\n\nlowing is a good one. It was in South\n\nAfrica. The destination of the company\n\nwas some 60 miles out from Pretoria. All\n\nthe baggage was delayed at Johannesburg,\n\nso Mr. George sent the company ahead\n\nwhile he stayed behind to investigate\n\nthings. He found that the carrier had\n\noverslept himself, but managed to secure\n\nthe baggage. There was no other train\n\ntill midnight. He hunted u' the station\n\nmaster, who telegraphed to his_ colleague\n\nat Pretoria, and arranged with him to stop\n\nthe tram going to Rustenburg at Wonder\n\nbloom (so named after a wonderfully pecu\n\nliar tree there). A special car and truck\n\nwere made' up for Mr. George and hi& iug\n\ngage at Johannesburg, and when he over\n\nhauled the waiting train the passengers\n\nwere all curiosity to know who the dis\n\ntinguished person was that kept the tram\n\n?IIIWIllllMllllllliHWIM^'''^'— — ™™\n\nwaiting so long. 'Where's the ijassen\n\nger?' called out the conductor of the. de-\n\nlayed train. 'I'm the passenger,' was\n\nthe reply of the entrepreneur. 'Have we\n\nbeen waiting here for you?' with the ac\n\ncent on the ''you' which was hardly com\n\nplimentary. 'Yes.' Words failed. the\n\nconductor, and a look of ineffable disgust\n\nstole over his countenance as he walked\n\nover to the engine-driver and shouted, ' ' Go\n\nahead mate! we've been waiting all this\n\ntime for a blooming actor.'\n\nA Step Nearer Goal.\n\n?Victor Schertzinger, director of Jackie\n\nCoogan's first Metro picture, 'Long Live,\n\nthe King,' has contributed a distinct in\n\nnovation to the screen, whieh brings the\n\nart of- motion pictures a step nearer its\n\ngoal. This noted director, who is equally;\n\neminent as a musician and composer, has\n\nwritten an entire original music score for\n\n'Long Live the King.' This music' is\n\nbeing played by a 'set orchestra' during\n\nthe filming of the scenes, and the same\n\nmusic will serve as the score for the pic\n\nture when it is presented in the theatre\n\nof the* world. It is tho. first time that ori-.\n\nginal music has ever been written to pro\n\nvide a stimulus for screen acting. It is\n\npractically a fulfilment of the prediction\n\nmade several years ago by Deems Taylor,\n\nnoted music critic ap.d. composer, t!w.t in\n\nstead of music being ntted to a jjlc'tu..':\n\nafter- it was finished, the action and tem\n\npo would follow a musical theme andjfiio\n\ntwo arts be fused in a creative sensoK$W~\n\ning the production period.

In 'Soul of a Beast'\n\nshe is a circus girl, who is befriended by\n\nOscar the elephant, and it is a question\n\nwhether the clever little actress or. the re\n\nmarkable beast is the star performer.

Walthall, famed for his interpre\n\ntation of the Little Colonel in D. W. Grif\n\nfith's 'Birth of A Nation,' has the leading\n\njaajc role. His appealing characterisati^i\n\nof Robert Stevens, artist and derelict, is,\n\nthe highlight of the picture. It is upon\n\nbjs shoulders that the major burden of the\n\nstory's suceeas rests, and he surpasses\n\nhimself. Exciting moments follow in quick\n\nsuccession. The storm scene, where a\n\ncrowded passenger ship flounders in1 the\n\ninountainous waves while treacherous .yat\n\ntinpr rocks almost surround.it, ja one of the\n\nmost thrilling the reviewer has seen in\n\nmany a day. And just as it seems disas\n\nter must follow^ Walthall staggers up the\n\nlighthouse ?winding stairs and lights the\n\nlight. Another bit of action that gave a\n\nthrill was the prison rebellion of the pri\n\nsoners. . It was a primitive slice of life, |\n\nblood curdling in its realism. Director i\n\nJack Ford has fashioned a convincing sue- j\n\neial with the mass of material he had at his |\n\ndisposal. He selected a cast of. popular\n\nand capable players that could not be im- |\n\nproved. Opposite Mr. Walthall is Ruth\n\nClifford, and others, including Alma Ben\n\nnett, Walter Emerson, Frederick Sullivan.\n\nNorval M'Gregor, Michael Dark, and Gus\n\nSsville. The story has to do with the ar\n\ntist, Robert Stevens, who becomes engaged\n\nto Marion Von Vleck, but through the\n\n(Teaehery of her brother the engagement '\n\nis broken, and Marion later marries some\n\none else. Stevens, heartbroken, his £aii:h\n\nin himself broken, lakes to drink, and sinks\n\nlower and lower, until one day, brooding\n\nby himself in a dive' of disrepute m the i\n\nunderworld, Ihngs plant a wallet in hisi\n\naccused and imprisoned for theft. The\n\naction sweeps along at a rapid pace, with\n\none thrill after another occurring, inciud\n\ning the spectacular prison rebellion and\n\nthe storm, before Stevens comes home to\n\ncast anchor in the love harbor and find hap\n\npiness in his love and his art.\n\nAnniversary Weefc. .\n\nAiTangements are being made to issue\n\nseason tickets for the coming anniversary\n\nweek, which commences at the Prince of\n\nWales Theatre on December S. The six\n\nmost popular pictures will be screened,\n\nA Big erent Bole.\n\nHaving been so far afield as the army\n\nand navy for his last two Universal pro\n\nductions, Hoot Gibson has come pretty\n\nclo^e to home in the feature he had just\n\nstarted iinder the dkection of EAwai$\n\nb'edgwiek. It is called ' The Extra Man, ''\n\nand tells the story of a young cowboy wkt\n\ncomes to Universal City to break into the\n\nmovies.\n\nCo5$y Producing. ?\n\nAt the cost of a small fortune, Thomas\n\nH. luce has reproduced the stokehold of a\n\nlarge steamer for a scene in his screen\n\nversion of Eugene O'Neill's dramatic sen\n\nsation, 'Anna Christie.' The three\n\nboilers alone in the stokehold added a\n\nbig item to the cost sheet of the produc\n\ntion, the material for each one reaching tha\n\n500 dollar mark. Surrounding the mas\n\nsive boilers, a specially constructed tank\n\nhas been built to bold the flood water for\n\nthe scene , where William Russell, as an\n\nIrish stoker, narrowly escapes drowning\n\nwhen the steamer is wrecked in the fog.\n\nAdjoining this 'set' there is a water tank\n\non a high platform, from which a huge vol\n\nume of water could be released at a rao»\n\nluent's notice. So gigantic and complicat\n\ned is the setting that a battery of 40 ear\n\npocket, and he is captured by the police,\n\npenters worked day and Bight for three :\n\nweeks to complete the wo.rk by the time the\n\ncompany returned from a 'location' trip\n\ntb San. Francisco. The set is the most\n\nEo'm/pletc of its kind ever reproduced on\n\na studio lot. The atmospheric conception\n\nhas been carried out for the screen in\n\nminutest detail from a description -written\n\nof the stokehold scene in 'Anne Christie'\n\nby the playwright. The stifling, coaldust\n\nladen air, the dim bulks of furnaces and\n\nboilers into whose fiery red mouths half\n\nnaked meu heap coal — the rhythmic swing\n\nof shovels from floor to furnace— the leap\n\ning) terrible flames from the fuel, give a\n\ndramatic touch to the Ince -production.\n\nPrince of Wales Vaudeville.\n\nAfter an extremely successful season,\n\nEdna Davis, the champion 14-year-old sy\n\nlophonist, terminates her engagement at\n\nthe Prince of Wales theatre this evening,\n\nMiss Davis is a skilful instrumentalist, and\n\n: her repertoire is extensive and' high-class. -\n\nEileen and Marjorie will continue their\n\nseason to-morrow. Their exhibitions of\n\naerobatics and tumbling have shown them\n\nto be unusually accomplished, their skill\n\nand dexterity being greatly admired. They\n\npromise further startling feats in to*\n\nmorrow's ehange. A new act also book\n\ned for to-morrow ^ is that of Brull and\n\nHelmsley, an artistic duo, who have at\n\ntained considerable success in sketches.\n\nTheir characterisations are faultlessly exe\n\ncuted, while they also number dancing and\n\nmusic in their accomplishments.\n\nWithout a Pailure.\n\nThat very popular and charming little\n\nscreen star Elaine Hammerstein has b'een\n\ndubbed by her fellow-players and by hard\n\nboiled critics as 'the star without a fail\n\nure.'
