        "text": "Prestige Pictures\n\nMusicals\n\nThe Woman's Film\n\nComedy\n\nSocial Problem Films\n\nHorror Films\n\nConclusion\n\nThe following analysis classifies the class-A feature films of the major Hollywood studios into six broad production trends: (1) prestige pictures; (2) musicals; (3) the woman's film; (4) comedy; (5) social problem films; and (6) horror films. The names given to the production trends are those used in the trade; the arrangement of the trends reflects a hierarchical ranking based on relative production costs, duration, and box-office performance. Individual trends are broken down into their component production cycles—comedy, for example, is broken down into sentimental, screwball, comedian-centered, and so on—and each is discussed from the perspective of product differentiation, studio by studio. As pointed out in the Introduction, the discussion is informed by contemporaneous polls and awards, especially Film Daily's Ten Best, and industry discourse in the trade press and in reviews.\n\nPrestige Pictures\n\nThe prestige picture was far and away the most popular production trend of the decade. Before defining the trend, some statistics are in order. From 1930 to 1933, the years of the Depression, fourteen of the forty films that made it to Film Daily's Ten Best, were prestige pictures; from 1934 to the end of the decade, about half of the films on the lists fell into this category. Of the sixty-seven pictues on Variety's Top-Grossing Films lists, close to thirty were prestige pictures. Compared to the total output of the majors, prestige pictures accounted for a small percentage, but compared to the total production budgets, they accounted for a lion's share. Moreover, prestige pictures played a crucial role defining the public image of a company.\n\nThe prestige picture is not a genre; rather, the term designates production values and promotion treatment. A prestige picture is typically a big-budget special based on a presold property, often as not a \"classic,\" and tailored for top stars. Motion Picture Herald identified four types of properties used for these pictures: (1) nineteenth-century European literature, such as the novels of Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, Alexandre Dumas père, and Victor Hugo; (2) Shakespearean plays, notably A Midsummer Night's Dream and Romeo and Juliet; (3) best-selling novels and hit Broadway plays written by Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning authors \"that have been acclaimed by the classes and bought by the masses,\" such as Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, Hervey Allen's Anthony Adverse, and Marc Connelly's The Green Pastures; and (4) biographical and historical subjects taken \"from originals or from books and plays produced by authors of known worth,\" especially biographies of European and American \"great men,\" natural disasters (the San Francisco earthquake, the Great Chicago Fire), folklore (the adventures of Robin Hood and his Merrie Men), and war (Civil War, Crimean, and the Great War).1 Thus, the prestige picture encompassed different genres, several motion-picture styles and other production trends—musicals, biopics, historical dramas, women's films, and even horror films.\n\nRegardless of the genre, prestige pictures were injected with plenty of star power, glamorous and elegant trappings, and elaborate special effects. Irving Thalberg devised the concept of multistar vehicles to make MGM's top prestige pictures. Industry practices dictated that one or two names were necessary to carry a typical class-A picture, but MGM, having the largest roster of stars in Hollywood, infused some of its prestige pictures with a galaxy of stars to generate maximum impact at the box office. Grand Hotel (1932), for example, listed six stars, four of whom were among the biggest draws in Hollywood—Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, and Wallace Beery. Rasputin and the Empress (1932) was designed as a vehicle for the three Barrymores—John, Ethel, and Lionel—the royal family of the American stage, and was the only picture in which they appeared together. Dinner At Eight (1933) listed eight stars, five of whom lived up to their billing—Wallace Beery, the Barrymore brothers, Marie Dressier, and Jean Harlow.\n\nBecause of the technical difficulties and added expense of using Technicolor, prestige pictures were shot almost exclusively in black and white. Nonetheless, all prestige pictures were high-ticket items, ranging in cost from $1 million on the average to $4.1 million for the most expensive picture of the era, Selznick's Gone With the Wind (1939). In addition to having bigger budgets, these pictures were longer than the 70-90-minute running time of the average feature. Hell's Angels (1930), which was released with a 135-minute running time, held the record for sound films until MGM's The Great Ziegfeld (1936), which lasted 4 minutes short of three hours. Selznick's Gone With the Wind lasted 220 minutes and set a new record.\n\nAt the exhibition level, prestige pictures were given splashy premieres and the roadshow treatment. Conventional class-A pictures lasted 80-90 minutes and were normally exhibited on a \"grind\" basis during first run—that is, on a continuous-performance basis. Prestige pictures, with their longer running times, were particularly suited to roadshowing, which entailed twice-a-day performance, intermissions, and reserved seats. Because the practice also meant higher ticket prices, higher film rentals, and extended runs, this pattern of release had the potential of recouping production costs much faster than normal. However, roadshowing had a downside. Because the practice required an expensive exploitation campaign to be effective, it increased a company's exposure when a picture met resistance at the box office. Roadshowing was popular during the 1930 season, dropped out of favor for two years during the Depression, and then resumed its privileged status for the remainder of the decade, when from six to ten prestige pictures were typically accorded this treatment each year.2\n\nThe prestige picture, having its roots in the earliest days of the feature film, was an established production trend at the very start of the decade. Nearly all the titles on Film Daily's Ten Best in 1930 were prestige pictures and ranged in style from comedy of manners (Pathe's Holiday), to drama (MGM's Anna Christie), to historical biopic (UA's Abraham Lincoln), to stage-bound melodrama (Warners' Old English), to war pictures (Universal's All Quiet on the Western Front). The war picture, with three examples, was the most popular cycle on the list: Tiffany-Gainsborough's Journey's End (directed by R. C. Sherriff) and United Artists' Hell's Angels (Howard Hughes), in addition to All Quiet. This last film, which ranked number one, made a strong pacifist statement. Based on Erich Maria Remarque's classic antiwar novel, the picture signaled Universal's intent to carve a niche for itself in the first-run market. To help adapt the novel, Universal hired the playwright Maxwell Anderson, the author of the famous antiwar drama What Price Glory? Produced at a cost of $1.45 million by Carl Laemmle, Jr., the picture starred Louis Wolheim and Lew Ayres and was acclaimed for its vivid and graphic portrayal of trench warfare. To make this landmark picture, Universal constructed a small town consisting of thirty-five standing sets and staged the battle scenes over a thousand acres of the studio's Irvine ranch. Lewis Milestone, the director, enhanced the realism of the spectacle by bringing \"all the fluidity of silent films to the camera—which freely tracked and panned and soared over the battlefields or the little German town. … At the same time Milestone imaginatively explored the possibilities of sound.\" Universal's first entry into the prestige market, All Quiet won Oscars for best picture and best director.3\n\nDeclining admissions during the Depression put a damper on the production of silent-style epics, musical extravaganzas, prestige costume pictures, and other expensive productions. Going against the grain of the market, RKO risked $1.5 million in 1931 to produce Cimarron (Wesley Ruggles), an epic Western starring Richard Dix that was based on the Edna Ferber best-seller. The picture began with an awe-inspiring re-creation of the 1889 Oklahoma Land Rush that used thousands of extras racing pell-mell on horseback, in wagons, and on foot to stake out claims on the millions of acres on the Cherokee Strip. Although the picture received rave reviews, won an Academy Award for best picture, and even made it to the top echelon of box-office winners in 1931, earning $1.38 million, it still lost money.\n\nParamount's The Sign of the Cross (Cecil B. DeMille) fared better the following year. This, the first historical costume epic of the sound era, marked DeMille's return to the studio after a hiatus of seven years and revived his flagging reputation. Waldemar Young and Sidney Buchman adapted Wilson Barrett's play, which was first filmed in 1914. Charles Laughton gave an outstanding performance as a petulant Nero; Claudette Colbert, as his lascivious wife, Poppaea; Fredric March, as the prefect of Rome, Marcus Superbus; and Elissa Landi, as the Christian maid Mercia. DeMille spent eight weeks and $650,000 to make what the New York Times called \"an opulent and striking pictorial spectacle.\"4 The spectacle included Christians being fed to the lions, gladiator fights, revealing costumes, erotic dancing, and Poppaea taking a bath in a four-hundred-gallon pool of asses' milk. The Sign of the Cross failed as a road-show attraction, but redeemed itself in general release.\n\nIn 1933, Fox released one of the most highly praised and successful prestige pictures of the period, Cavalcade (Frank Lloyd, 1933). It was based on Noel Coward's pageant of the twentieth century, the hit of London's 1931-1932 season, and celebrated the experiences of a British upper-class family and their servants from New Year's Eve 1899 to the same evening in 1932. The film remained faithful to its source in most respects. Reginald Berkeley's adaptation repeated the episodic structure of the original and contained vignettes of Jane and Robert Marryot against backdrops of soldiers departing for the Boer War in South Africa, the funeral of Queen Victoria, the voyage of the Titanic, the Great War, the Jazz Age, and the Depression. The picture was produced in Hollywood, but the principals—Clive Brook, Diana Wynyard, and Frank Lawton—and other members of the cast were British. Period music was used to capture the spirit of each age, and William S. Darling's authentic-looking settings of Edwardian England—an upper-class home, a pub, a music hall, and Trafalgar Square, among others—evoked a strong sense of nostalgia. Produced by Winfield Sheehan at a cost of $1.25 million, Cavalcade won Academy Awards for best picture, director, and art direction and grossed close to $4 million during its first release, much of which came from Great Britain and the Empire.\n\nThese few pictures were exceptions, for studios mostly had to devise cheaper, alternative ways to sustain prestige production. Warners fed the prestige market by releasing a series of vehicles designed around George Arliss, an aging British character actor. The series began with Disraeli (Alfred E. Green) at the close of 1929. Making his American theatrical debut in 1902, Arliss played the title role of Louis N. Parker's Disraeli several times on stage and once in a silent film. By the time Arliss made the sound version, the role had became his trademark. Disraeli was an enormous hit and enjoyed long runs in New York and other large cities worldwide.\n\nThereafter, Warners produced motion-picture versions of Arliss's other stage vehicles. Old English (Alfred E. Green), based on John Galsworthy's novel The Stoic, made it to Film Daily's Ten Best in 1930. Arliss's subsequent prestige vehicles for Warners included two biopics, Alexander Hamilton (1931) and Voltaire (1933), both of which were directed by John Adolfi. Arliss's pictures did not earn money: for one thing his acting style was considered old-fashioned; for another, his films were stage-bound. Nonetheless, Arliss was a publicrelations success. As Variety put it, \"allowing that none of this English star's films may have been dynamic successes, nevertheless, it may be said that the Arliss releases were an opening wedge and many a film will profit by the pioneering of this British actor and his type of work.\"5\n\nUnited Artists released two noteworthy pictures by Samuel Goldwyn, Street Scene (King Vidor, 1931) and Arrowsmith (John Ford, 1932). Prestige for Goldwyn meant Pulitzer Prize winners and Nobel laureates. was based on Elmer Rice's 1929 Pulitzer Prize-winning play about big-city tenement life. Since the play was regarded as a masterpiece of American naturalism and had been produced in many countries, Goldwyn decided to respect the original and brought Rice to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Goldwyn signed Sylvia Sidney to play the lead and hired nearly a dozen actors from the Broadway cast to reprise their roles in the film. Richard Day designed an authentic-looking single set of a Manhattan West Side street, complete with elevated tracks that preserved the unity of place of the original production. Alfred Newman added an extra dimension to the film by composing a main theme reminiscent of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue to conjure up the hustle and cacophony of city life. Arrowsmith was based on the 1925 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Sinclair Lewis, who in 1930 became America's first Nobel laureate in literature. Lewis's novel was an exposé of the medical profession. As adapted by playwright Sidney Howard, the film subordinated the exposé elements of the novel as it followed an idealistic young doctor and hopeful scientist, Martin Arrowsmith (Ronald Colman), and his unselfish wife, Leora (Helen Hayes), from a small-town practice in North Dakota, to a research institute in New York, to an isolated island in the West Indies, to a farm in Vermont. Richard Day's sets included an impressive streamlined modern research facility, the McGurk Research Institute, which is used \"as a symbol for the sterile, antihumanistic values ascribed to in the 'pure' science idealism of Dr. Arrowsmith.\" In producing pictures such as these, the New York Times said, Goldwyn was a \"pioneer picture producer who has quite often shown a desire to lead the public rather than follow it.\"6\n\nMGM, the only studio to go through the Depression unscathed, had the most success exploiting the prestige picture. Describing the company's position in the industry, Fortune said in 1932 that \"for the past five years, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has made the best and most successful moving pictures in the United States. No one in Hollywood would dream of contradicting this flat statement.\" To produce the yearly roster of pictures, Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg operated without fiscal constraints. As Ronald Haver put it, they felt free \"to spend as much as necessary to do it right. This lordly disregard for money was one of the things that made picturemaking at MGM such an obsession with the people who worked there during its years of greatness.\"7\n\nTwelve MGM pictures made it to Film Daily's Ten Best in the years 1930-1933, four of which were prestige pictures—Anna Christie (Clarence Brown, 1930), Grand Hotel (Edmund Goulding, 1932), The Guardsman (Sidney Franklin, 1931), and Rasputin And The Empress (Richard Boleslawski, 1932). Practically all of the studio's twenty-two films on the list in the rest of the 1930s fell into this category. Going into the thirties, Irving Thalberg looked to the theater for story ideas and talent to make his prestige pictures. MGM had held back Greta Garbo's talking debut as long as possible, worried that her Swedish accent would be unacceptable for the new medium. Thalberg found the perfect vehicle in Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie, a naturalistic drama about a waterfront prostitute that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1921. In one sense, Anna Christie departed from the typical Garbo vehicle in that \"Garbo wore only the drabbest of clothes amid the most sordid surroundings\"; in another sense, it continued her established pattern. Garbo played a poor farm girl who runs away from drudgery, becomes a prostitute, falls for a seaman, loses him when she tells him of her past, but wins him back in the end. Garbo's accent sounded natural in the role because the heroine was also Swedish. Moreover, the adaptation built up suspense by delaying her entrance until well over thirty minutes into the film. And when she said her first lines, \"Gimme a viskey. Chinger ale on the side. An' don't be stingy, babee,\" audiences applauded. Variety said, '\"Garbo talks' is, beyond quarrel, an event of major box office significance.\"8\n\nThalberg next signed the most glamorous and sophisticated couple of the American stage, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, to make The Guardsman. Produced at a cost of $374,000, the picture was a faithful adaptation of Ferenc Molnár's comedy of manners, which the Lunts originally performed for the Theatre Guild in 1924. Variety said of the picture, \"To the sophisticated it is all sublimated high comedy; to the commonality of gum chewers, it will be either a dark mystery or a sacrilege.\"9 The failure of the picture convinced the Lunts to confine their considerable talents to Broadway.\n\nFailing to develop the Lunts into motion-picture stars, Thalberg tried to transform his wife, Norma Shearer, into \"the screen equivalent of a great lady of the theater.\" To begin, Thalberg teamed Shearer with Robert Montgomery in Private Lives (Sidney Franklin, 1931), an adaptation of Noel Coward's sophisticated comedy, which he designed as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence and which had enjoyed long runs the year before in London and New York. Thalberg then teamed Shearer with Clark Gable in Strange Interlude (Robert Z. Leonard, 1932), MGM's second adaptation of a Pulitzer Prizewinning drama by Eugene O'Neill. This controversial play had been a hit starring Lynn Fontanne during its original 1928 Broadway run, but Thalberg's production was only politely received, mostly because of its unconventional use of voiceover to replicate the play's asides that were spoken directly to the audience to reveal a character's thoughts.\n\nThalberg's sorcery worked better for Grand Hotel, a multicharacter picture based on Vicki Baum's best-seller Menschen im Hotel. MGM acquired the motion-picture rights to the book for $6,000, but with the proviso that the studio would finance a dramatization of the novel on Broadway. William A. Drake did the adaptation, which was produced by Herman Shumlin for $55,000. The play was a big hit and earned MGM a handsome profit as well as the property. Drake wrote the screenplay with Frances Marion (uncredited). The all-star cast contained Greta Garbo as the world-weary ballerina Grusinskaya, John Barry-more as the luckless Baron von Geigern, Joan Crawford as the hotel stenographer Flaemmchen, Wallace Beery as the ruthless industrialist Preysing, and Lionel Barrymore as the downtrodden clerk Kringelein. In addition to the illustrious cast, the appeal of the picture resided in the art deco sets designed by Cedric Gibbons, in the gowns by Adrian, and the influential Grand Hotel narrative formula, which interwove the stories of a cross section of humanity within a single setting. Produced at a cost of $700,000, the picture was given road-show treatment and grossed nearly $2.6 million the first year of its release. It won the Academy Award for best picture and ranked number one on Film Daily's Ten Best.\n\nProducing Rasputin And The Empress, Thalberg united the royal family of the American stage for the first and only time the Barrymores would appear together on the screen. Lionel had joined MGM in 1926; John had signed a non-exclusive contract with the studio in 1931; but Ethel had remained content with the theater. In getting her to do Rasputin, Thalberg hoped to entice her to sign a long-term contract. John, who was billed first, played Prince Chegodieff, Rasputin's assassin; Ethel played the czarina; and Lionel played the mad monk Rasputin. Written by Charles MacArthur and directed by Richard Boleslawski, a Russian-trained Polish expatriate, this historical epic of the tragic Romanovs cost $1 million. Although the Barrymores received good notices, the picture could not recover the huge outlay and became one of the studio's costlier failures.\n\nThalberg's heart attack in 1932 convinced Louis B. Mayer to reorganize the studio by creating autonomous production units to replace the central-producer system. To share responsibility for MGM's prestige pictures, Mayer hired his son-in-law, David O. Selznick, another \"boy genius,\" who had just finished a successful production stint at RKO. For his MGM debut, Selznick followed in Thalberg's footsteps by producing Dinner At Eight (1933), based on the George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber 1932 comedy hit containing interlocking stories about the behind-the-scenes events leading up to a posh Manhattan dinner party. Envisioning a multi-star vehicle along the lines of Grand Hotel, Selznick chose Frances Marion and Herman J. Mankiewicz to write the screenplay. George Cukor, who had just finished Little Women for RKO, was brought in to direct. The picture cost only $387,000 to make, received excellent reviews, and returned more than $3 million in rentals to MGM.\n\nTwo prestige pictures released in 1933 forecast the future course of the trend. The first, UA's The Private Life Of Henry VIII, was a historical biopic produced and directed in Great Britain by Alexander Korda. Starring Charles Laughton in the title role, the picture premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on 12 October 1933. Produced at the modest cost of £60,000, the picture grossed about $500,000 in the United States, an enormous amount for a British picture, and much more abroad. Laughton's virtuoso performance won him an Academy Award, the first Oscar ever awarded to a British-made film. Korda also proved to the world that a British film could match the spectacle and lavishness of anything produced in Hollywood, which sparked a brief interest in the United States in British costume pictures and historical biopics in general.\n\nThe second 1933 prestige film, RKO's Little Women (George Cukor), was considered the first picture of the decade based on a literary classic to be turned into an artistic and commercial success. Initiated by David O. Selznick before he joined MGM, the project was revived by his successor, Merian C. Cooper, as a vehicle for RKO's newest star, Katharine Hepburn. Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman adapted Louisa May Alcott's novel, winning an Oscar for their efforts. Variety described the picture as a superb \"human document, sombre in tone, stately and slow in movement, but always eloquent in its interpretations. … There doesn't occur a picture in recent film history pro duced with so uncompromising a degree of sincerity, or one that so wholeheartedly aims at an honest realization of a significant novel of another era.\" Earning $800,000 in profits, Little Women became one of RKO's biggest hits of the decade.10 It was nominated for an Academy Award as best picture and ranked number five on Film Daily' Top Ten list of 1934.\n\nA second wave of prestige pictures hit the market early in 1934 \"in numbers so thick as to constitute the champion of cycles since sound came in,\" said Variety.11 They consisted mostly of historical biopics, among them MGM's Queen Christina (Rouben Mamoulian), Viva Villa! (Jack Conway), and The Barretts of Wimpole Street (Sidney Franklin); Paramount's The Scarlett Empress (Josef von Sternberg) and Cleopatra (Cecil B. DeMille); UA's House of Rothschild (Alfred L. Werker).\n\nMGM's The Barretts of Wimpole Street ranked number one on Film Daily's Ten Best. Based on Rudolf Besier's genteel dramatic biography of Elizabeth Barrett, which had enjoyed a long Broadway run with Katharine Cornell in the starring role, The Barretts of Wimpole Street united three Oscar winners—Norma Shearer, who played \"the captive maiden\" Elizabeth Barrett; Fredric March, \"the dashing young knight\" Robert Browning; and Charles Laughton, Elizabeth's \"cruel ogre father.\" The New York Times said, \"For the high-minded aspiration which went into the production, there can be nothing less than a shout of benediction. Hollywood could make no more fitting answer to her critics than this.\" The picture not only gave Shearer her most widely acclaimed great-lady-of-the-theater role but also earned a substantial profit.12\n\nThe number of prestige pictures rose dramatically thereafter, and for the remainder of the decade they constituted 50 percent of the pictures on Film Daily's Ten Best. The traditional explanation for the revival of the prestige picture was that pressure from the Legion of Decency forced the industry to launch its Better Pictures Campaign of 1934. For example, during the height of the Legion of Decency campaign, Variety reported,\n\nBuffeted by church and reformer into the greatest amount of space ever concentrated in the country's newspapers over any other two months in its history, and faced with another accounting of its stewardship to the public in the fall, filmdom is taking advantage of the national recess on a clean screen to do some things it has never done before. It is delving furiously into major company archives for facts [to produce period pictures]. (\"What the Public Wants,\" 7 August 1934, p. 1)\n\nLooking back to the causes of the revival, the Motion Picture Herald observed two years later,\n\nAn increasing demand for better pictures, crystalized in the Legion of Decency movement in 1934, led to the voluntary adoption by the industry of higher standards of production and the resultant success of a group of literary masterpieces, so-called, made into pictures has been so great that today a larger number of the \"million dollar\" productions than ever before are built around notable literary successes, either old or new. (\"Producers Aim Classics,\" 15 August 1936, p. 13)\n\nBut these explanations ignore the economics of producing prestige pictures. The ability of prestige pictures to attract audiences was well understood by Hollywood. However, the heavy investments required to make these pictures placed them out of reach of most companies until general economic conditions improved and operations stabilized. Stated another way, the majors waited out the worst of the Depression and revived the trend when people had more disposable income to spend on entertainment.\n\nImproved conditions at the box office meant that prestige pictures could resume their privileged places on production rosters. By 1936, the so-called million-dollar grosser was \"no longer the rarity it [had] been during the long, lean years following the 1929 attack of indigestion in [the] industry,\" said Variety. Typically only a dozen or so pictures grossed $1 million in any given year. But in 1936 forty surpassed that mark. Concurrently, the million-dollar production became commonplace. Variety reported that at least thirty-five titles on the 1937-1938 release schedules cost more than $1 million, and of these, two or three had budgets of more than $2 million.13\n\nTo broaden the potential market for prestige pictures, Hollywood even flirted with producing Shakespeare. Educated middle-class Americans were not habitual moviegoers. In 1936 the Hays Office estimated that 36 million such people attended the movies infrequently, as little as once a year or only for special pictures. Warners spearheaded the crusade to capture this market by producing A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935), a decision that Variety described as \"probably the biggest gamble ever taken by any picture company or producer.\" The decision to produce the first Shakespearean talkie also marked a switch in policy at Warners away from \"its exclusive image as producer of popular realist films\" to big-budget prestige pictures.14\n\nWarners planned to re-create for the screen Max Reinhardt's outdoor production of the play presented at the eighteen-thousand-seat Hollywood Bowl during the summer of 1934. Germany's most important stage producer and director, Reinhardt had immigrated to Hollywood to escape Nazi persecution. Reinhardt's innovative staging of Shakespeare's play, which included \"a lovely ballet of the fairies and a startling performance by a boy actor named Mickey Rooney in the role of Puck,\" attracted capacity crowds and prompted Variety to announce, \"Shakespeare had made good in Hollywood!\"15\n\nPulling out all the stops, Warners budgeted $1.3 million for the picture, an extremely large amount by the studio's standards, and scheduled a seventy-day shoot. Warners hired Reinhardt to direct the picture, but since Reinhardt had little experience with the ways of Hollywood, the studio assigned contract director William Dieterle, a former pupil of the impresario, to co-direct. Screenwriters Charles Kenyon and Mary McCall, Jr., preserved the play almost word for word. Anton Grot designed a fantastic fairy-tale forest on two large soundstages and magnificent interior sets and props. Because Grot's immense forest overpowered the actors, cinematographer Hal Mohr was brought in to redesign it and to devise a new lighting system. He won an Academy Award for his efforts. Erich Wolfgang Korngold arranged and elaborately executed the score, using Mendelssohn's incidental music for the play. The two ballet sequences were directed by Nijinska. The cast was drawn mainly from Warners' contract-player roster. Dick Powell played Lysander; James Cagney, Bottom; Victor Jory, Oberon; Joe E. Brown, Flute; Olivia de Havilland, Hermia; and Anita Louise, Titania. To play Puck, Mickey Rooney was borrowed from MGM.\n\nWarners launched the picture simultaneously in New York and London on 9 October 1935 and then in other capitals around the world the next day. A gala opening at the Warners Theatre in Beverly Hills was set for the following week. To prepare audiences for the roadshow release in the United States, Warners distributed low-priced editions of the play to schools, literary societies, and cultural groups; planted stories and photographs of the principal cast at work in hundreds of magazines and newspapers; and gave away recordings of Mendelssohn's incidental music to radio stations. \"Not a schoolchild lives in America today who hasn't heard about the picture, written essays about it, and then ducked seeing it, if possible,\" said Variety.16\n\nThe picture was a succès d'estime. For example, the New York Times said, \"If this is no masterpiece, it is a brave, beautiful and interesting effort to subdue the most difficult of Shakespeare's works …. It is a credit to Warner Brothers and to the motion picture industry.\" Variety also praised the picture for its publicrelations value and added that Warners would not be perturbed if it lost $500,000 on the project.17\n\nHollywood's next venture into Shakespeare, MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936), surpassed Warners' A Midsummer Night's Dream in lavishness and scope. Starring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, the picture was produced by Irving Thalberg at a cost of $2 million. To assist Cedric Gibbons and Adrian in the design of the sets and costumes, the studio dispatched Oliver Messel, a British art expert, to Verona, Italy, where his staff took thousands of pictures so that the Renaissance could be captured on the screen as never before. Talbot Jennings created a cinematic adaptation of the play by trimming about a fourth of the verse and by opening up the action beyond the confines of the stage. George Cukor, who brought Little Women and David Copperfield to life, was entrusted with the direction. Choreographer Agnes de Mille staged the period dances at the Capulet ball.18\n\nAn ecstatic Frank Nugent of the New York Times said, \"Never before, in all its centuries, has the play received so handsome a production … the picture reflects great credit upon its producers and upon the screen as a whole. It's a dignified, sensitive and entirely admirable Shakespearean—not Hollywoodean—production.\" MGM's exploitation campaign was even more extensive than Warners' and reached millions of people. However, when the picture posted a $900,000 loss, Variety concluded that the Shakespeare cycle was a \"B.O. Washout … over almost before it got around the first curve. What started out to be the beginning of a new era of enlightenment at the studios and the propulsion that was to fill the theatres with new audiences has ended on a note of disappointment.\"19\n\nThereafter, biopics, costume-adventure pictures, adaptations of literary masterpieces, and even the class-Á Western became the staples of prestige production. Of the group, the biopic was most esteemed. The motion picture most responsible for building this reputation was Warners' The Life of Emile Zola (William Dieterle, 1937), starring Paul Muni. One of the most honored motion pictures of the era, The Life of Emile Zola won an Academy Award and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best picture and made it to the number-one spots on the Film Daily and New York Times Ten Best lists. Muni had won an Oscar the year before for his performance in the title role of The story of Louis Pasteur (William Dieterle, 1936), which launched a series of biopics that made him, in Nick Roddick's words, \"a kind of thinking man's Lon Chaney, impersonating the great men of history … aided by extensive make-up jobs.\" Muni and the Warners biopic set a high standard, and the appearance of a star in a biopic was taken as an index of his or her seriousness as an artist.20\n\nBiopics depicted European personages at first, but by the end of the decade the focus shifted more to American heroes such as Alexander Graham Bell, Knute Rockne, Florenz Ziegfeld, and Abraham Lincoln. Hollywood preferred foreign biographies because they \"carried with them virtually no audience preconceptions, and were thus more easily adjusted to contemporary values.\" For example, the New York Herald Tribune said that Twentieth Century's The House of Rothschild (1934) \"belongs very definitely to the type of historical narrative that is concerned, not with escape, but with a parallel to present-day conditions. With a shrewd eye on the current plight of the Jews in Hitler's Germany, the picture shows its Semitic family as the victims of race hatred and Nordic oppression.\" In an attempt to explain the shift to Americana in biopics, Paul Vanderwood noted that Hollywood was following the lead of historians, biographers, and writers who reacted to deteriorating world conditions by burrowing \"backward into the national consciousness to discover how their predecessors had survived the pressures of their most difficult times.\"21\n\nThe costume-adventure film was revived by two 1934 hits—MGM's Treasure Island (Victor Fleming) and Reliance-United Artists' The Count of Monte Cristo (Rowland V. Lee). A spirited adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, Treasure Island starred Wallace Beery as Long John Silver and Jackie Cooper as Jim Hawkins. Containing \"as fine a lot of cutthroats as ever have infested a film,\" Treasure Island was one of the year's biggest box-office attractions. The Count of Monte Cristo, based on Alexandre Dumas's historical novel, had been made several times as a silent. Reliance's version, which was named to Film Daily's Ten Best, starred Robert Donat as Edmond Dantès in his American film debut. \"A walloping melodrama of revenge, conceived on the grand scale,\" Monte Cristo \"is made in heaven for the manufacturers of the costume film drama,\" said the New York Times.22\n\nAdventure films dealt \"with make-believe, with soldiers-of-fortune, explorers, pirates, avengers, rescuers and trouble-shooters\" drawn from Sir Walter Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Alexandre Dumas, Rafael Sabatini, and other masters of historical fiction.23 The perfect escapist fare for an audience coming out of the Depression, the swashbuckler\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin Press, 1982], pp. 13-14\">\n\ndealt with the heroic virtues. Usually there was an idealized hero defending the honor of a lady in a chivalrous and charming manner. Evil-incarnate villains were to be dispatched, but in a \"romantically violent,\" stylized series of action set-pieces that were usually rendered with less than graphic reality. Color, dash, romantic order, and excitement prevailed, and in the end, of course, there was the triumph of good over evil. Here was audience wish fulfillment on a grand scale.(Rudy Behlmer, ed., The Sea Hawk [Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1982], pp. 13-14)\n\nWarners became the leading purveyor of costume-adventure pictures by producing a series of Errol Flynn swashbucklers; however, just about every company tried its hand at the cycle.\n\nThe popularity of the costume-adventure picture also helped revive the prestige Western. Consigned mostly to the Â ranks since Cimarron went down to defeat in 1931, the class-Á Western had been kept alive almost single-handedly by Paramount, which produced Texas Rangers (King Vidor, 1936), The Plains-man (Cecil B. DeMille, 1936), Wells Fargo (Frank Lloyd, 1937), and The Texans (James Hogan, 1938). Beginning in 1939, as reported by Variety, there flowed from Hollywood \"the rootin', tootin', shootin'est, bowie-knife-wielding bunch of ride-'em'-cowboy, major budget westerns the picture biz has witnessed in a decade.\"24 According to the trade paper, it was a \"tossup\" whether Paramount's Union Pacific (Cecil B. DeMille) or Fox's Jesse James (Henry King) revived the cycle, but that season also saw the release of UA's Stagecoach (John Ford), Warners' Dodge City (Michael Curtiz), Fox's Drums Along the Mohawk (John Ford), and Universal's Destry Rides Again (George Marshall), among others.\n\nThe comeback of the class-Á Western can be attributed to fact that \"oaters,\" as they were known in the trade, had never really lost their appeal. As Variety observed, \"a good western picture never misses at the box offce. From the earliest film days … the western has held its place against all other types of popular stories. There have been times when the majors have left the field to the independent producers. But they return. Then the western, produced on a grand scale, is revived and invariably, when well done, is handsomely rewarded.\" Another cause was the \"surge of Americanism sweeping the country\" as tensions in Europe increased. Hollywood no doubt wanted to boost national morale by producing these pictures; but it might also have anticipated the closing of foreign markets by tailor-making a cycle mainly for domestic consumption.25\n\nOf note here is that two Westerns released in 1939 were accorded prestige treatment. Testifying to the potential drawing power of the cycle, Warners and Paramount launched Dodge City and Union Pacific, respectively, with special premieres in locales, as Variety put it, \"indigenous to the subject matter\" of the pictures. Premiering its picture, Warners dispatched trains carrying 350 stars and studio executives from Hollywood and New York to Dodge City, Kansas. The trains stopped at cities along the way to promote the picture, making the \"hinterland feel … as important and big with its $3 premiere as Hollywood in the past with its five- and ten-dollar openings.\" The festivities at Dodge City, which had a population of 10,000, attracted a crowd of 75,000. In total, Warners spent $75,000 on the premiere and considered the money well spent.\n\nParamount's premiere of Union Pacific was even grander. President Roosevelt was enlisted to strike a telegraph key from his desk to start the celebration in Omaha, Nebraska, which included a banquet and parade that attracted over 250,000. Afterward, Paramount planned a ten-thousand-mile train tour carrying the film's stars and studio publicity men to coincide with the opening of the picture in first-run cities.26 As will be discussed later, Selznick took this publicity practice to its apogee when he launched Gone With the Wind.\n\nThe principal producers of prestige pictures after 1934 consisted of MGM, Warners, and United Artists in that order. 20th Century-Fox was a close runner-up and produced a series of biopics that included Lloyd's of london (Henry King, 1936), The Prisoner of Shark Island (John Ford, 1936), Suez (Allan Dwan, 1938), Jesse James (Henry King, 1939), Stanley and Livingstone (Henry King, 1939), The Story of Alexander Graham Bell (Irving Cummings, 1939), Swanee River (Sidney Lanfield, 1939), and Young Mr. Lincoln (John Ford, 1939). All were \"romances of personal success and triumph over adversity.\"\n\nThree Fox pictures made it to Film Daily's Ten Best—In Old Chicago (1938), Alexander's Ragtime band (1938), and Stanley and Livingstone (1939), all of which were directed by Henry King. The first two pictures are prestige musicals and are discussed in the following section. Stanley and Livingstone, an example of \"Hollywood's fervent Anglophilia,\" owed much of its structure to Warners' Life of Emile Zola. Spencer Tracy played Henry Stanley, the American newspaperman, and Cedric Hardwicke, Dr. David Livingstone, the British explorer and missionary.\n\nRKO and Paramount lagged far behind other members of the Big Five. RKO followed up Little Women (1933) with John Ford's The Informer (1935), a \"sleeper\" starring Victor McLaglen that found its own way to the public. Dudley Nichols adapted Liam O'Flaherty's novel set in Dublin about a despicable drunk who would lie and betray anyone to save his own skin. Shot in seventeen days at a cost of around $260,000, the picture opened to adulatory reviews, but it withered at the box office. However, after being named best picture by the New York Film Critics and after winning Oscars for best director, best actor, and best adaptation, word-of-mouth advertising revived the picture.\n\nAfterward, RKO had little commercial success with its prestige pictures until 1939. Among the many fine pictures released by the studio that year were two outstanding prestige pictures produced by Pandro S. Berman, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (William Dieterle, 1939), a horror picture based on the Victor Hugo classic, starring Charles Laughton, and Gunga Din (George Stevens, 1939), a costume adventure picture based vaguely on a Rudyard Kipling poem, starring Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.\n\nParamount produced only one prestige film that made it to the Film Daily list after 1934, Lives of a Bengal Lancer (Henry Hathaway, 1935), a Kiplingesque adventure film produced by Louis D. Lighton about a gallant band of British fighting men who guard the northern frontier of Britain's empire in India. Cecil B. DeMille, Paramount's main purveyor of prestige films, faltered throughout much of the decade. After the conversion to sound, DeMille switched from depicting \"the marital misadventures of the leisured class\" to historical and frontier epics, such as Cleopatra, The Plainsman, and Union Pacific.27 Although Cleopatra is best remembered today for its immense stylized sets, writhing and gyrating dancers, gaudy showmanship, and Claudette Colbert's provocative costumes, Union Pacific, a saga of the first transcontinental railroad, starring Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck and complete with spectacular train wrecks, Indian sieges, and colorful characters, was his most successful picture at the box office.\n\nAmong the Little Three, Columbia was the only other studio besides UA to produce a prestige picture. Columbia's only entry, Frank Capra's Lost Horizon (1937), was based on James Hilton's novel about a Utopian civilization hidden in Tibet called Shangri-La and was produced at a cost of over $2.5 million, an incredible sum for the studio. Coming nowhere close to recouping its production costs, Lost Horizon was responsible for the drop in Columbia's profits from a high of $1.8 million in 1935, the year following the release of It Happened One Night, to a mere $180,000 in 1938.\n\nAnalyzing MGM a second time, Fortune reported in 1939 that the studio \"has for at least eight years made far and away the best pictures of any studio in Hollywood. Metro's gross revenue from film rentals has been consistently higher than that of other studios, and as a result Loews', Inc., has been and still is the most profitable movie company in the world.\"28\n\nIrving Thalberg, in his capacity as a special-projects producer, delivered three prestige pictures before his untimely death in 1936—Mutiny on the Bounty (Frank Lloyd, 1935), Romeo and Juliet (George Cukor, 1936), and The Good Earth (Sidney Franklin, 1937). Mutiny on the Bounty was the most successful. Based on novels by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, this adventure classic starred Charles Laughton as the sadistic Captain Bligh of HMS Bounty and Clark Gable and Franchot Tone as his antagonists, Fletcher Christian and Roger Byam. Produced at the then-astronomical cost of $2 million and shot largely on location using life-size reproductions of the ships Bounty and Pandora, the picture grossed $4.3 million, making it one of the biggest moneymakers of the decade. The New York Times called it \"just about the perfect adventure picture.\"29Film Daily's poll ranked it number one. In the Academy Award sweepstakes, all three leads—Laughton, Gable, and Tone—were nominated as best actor, a first in the history of the awards. They lost to Victor McLaglen in The Informer, but Mutiny on the Bounty captured the Oscar for best picture.\n\nThalberg got the idea of doing The Good Earth after attending a Theatre Guild dramatization of Pearl S. Buck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel in 1932 that starred Claude Rains and Alla Nazimova. Thalberg spent three years and $2.8 million on the picture, the most MGM had spent on a film since Ben-Hur (1925). To make this epic about Chinese life as authentic as possible, Thalberg dispatched a second unit to China, where it shot 2 million feet of footage to be used for process shots to create the proper atmosphere. Cedric Gibbons and unit art director Harry Oliver worked two years designing and constructing a replica of a Chinese province, complete with peasant huts, palace, and rice paddies on five hundred acres in the San Fernando Valley. Meanwhile, the script by Talbot Jennings, Tess Schlesinger, and Claudine West underwent constant revision. Paul Muni was borrowed from Warners to play the farmer Wang, and Luise Rainer was chosen to play his wife O-lan.\n\nThalberg died early into the shoot, and Albert Lewin, his associate, took over. MGM released the picture with the dedication \"To the memory of Irving Grant Thalberg,\" which marked the first time a Thalberg project at MGM carried his name. A. Arnold Gillespie's special effects depicting a plague of locusts attacking the crops and Karl Freund's camerawork created a picture of immense visual appeal. Frank Nugent of the New York Times called The Good Earth \"one of the finest things Hollywood has done this season or any other.\"30 A month after the picture's release, MGM scored a great publicity coup when Rainer and Muni were voted Academy Awards for their previous year's performances in The Story of Louis Pasteur and The Great Ziegfeld, respectively. At Academy Award time the following year, Luise Rainer won the best-actress Oscar for her performance as O-lan, which accomplished the seemingly impossible feat of winning back-to-back Oscars.\n\nDavid O. Selznick, who had rapidly become Thalberg's equal as a producer of prestige pictures, specialized in translating literary masterpieces to the screen. Little Women had vindicated his \"long-held belief that, contrary to industry tradition, classics were not taboo screen material, but could, with proper care and intelligent handling, be turned into artistic and commercial smashes.\"31 Selznick put his ideas into practice in 1935, his last year at MGM, by turning out three such pictures, all of which made it to Film Daily's Ten Best and were enthusiastically received.\n\nDavid Copperfield (George Cukor, 1935), adapted from the Dickens classic by Howard Estabrook and Hugh Walpole, starred Freddie Bartholomew, Selznick's newest discovery, in the title role. In a bit of offbeat casting, W. C. Fields played Micawber, and Roland Young, Uriah Heep. Although Selznick and Cukor had scouted England for suitable locations, the film was ultimately shot on the MGM lot at a cost of little over $1 million. The New York Times hailed it as \"gorgeous photoplay which encompasses the rich and kindly humanity of the original so brilliantly that it becomes a screen masterpiece in its own right. The immortal people of David Copperfield … troop across the … screen like animated duplicates of the famous Phiz drawings, an irresistible and enormously heartwarming procession.\"32 A great hit with the public, the picture ranked number one on Film Daily's Ten Best.\n\nSelznick next produced Anna Karenina (Clarence Brown, 1935), a vehicle designed for Greta Garbo. Playing opposite John Gilbert in 1927, Garbo had made a silent version of the Tolstoy novel for MGM entitled Love. In Selznick's remake, which was written by Clemence Dane, Salka Viertel, and S. N. Behrman, Fredric March played her lover, Vronsky; Basil Rathbone, her husband, Karenin; and Freddie Bartholomew, her son, Sergei. Mounted with a scrupulous regard for period authenticity, Selznick's picture emphasized the implicit social criticism in Tolstoy's novel by depicting Muscovite society of the 1870s as decadent and frivolous. Although Anna Karenina cost well over a $1 million, Brown's direction of this poignant, tragic story, which brought the best out of Garbo, made the picture a critical and commercial success.\n\nFor his final MGM entry, Selznick turned to another Dickens classic, A Tale of Two Cities (Jack Conway, 1935), which \"outdid even David Copperfield in spectacular scope and dramatic force.\"33 Adapted by W. P. Lipscomb and S. N. Behrman, the picture had an impressive cast headed by Ronald Colman as Sydney Carton and dramatized memorable scenes of the French Revolution such as the storming of the Bastille, mass rioting for meat, and the kangaroo-court trials leading to the guillotine.\n\nAfter Selznick left MGM to become an independent producer, the studio promoted Hunt Stromberg, one of Thalberg's associate producers, to the prestige ranks. Stromberg came through for the company by producing a string of commercial and critical successes that included the Thin Man series, the Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy operettas, and two big-budget prestige extravaganzas, The Great Ziegfeld (Robert Z. Leonard, 1936) and Marie Antionette (W. S. Van Dyke, 1938). (The Great Ziegfeld is discussed in the following section.)\n\nMarie Antoinette, which marked Norma Shearer's triumphant return to the screen after a two-year hiatus, was based on Stefan Zweig's biography. Produced with a running time of 160 minutes (trimmed to 149 minutes after the first runs) and at a cost of $2.3 million, Marie Antoinette was MGM's most lavish extravaganza of the decade. Bosley Crowther described why:\n\nMayer and Stromberg instructed Cedric Gibbons, the studio's head designer, to prepare the most exquisite and impressive settings that could be conceived. Versailles itself was slightly tarnished alongside the palace Gibbons whipped up. He did some exquisite reproductions of the buildings of eighteenth-century France. Ed Willis, the head of the prop department, was sent to Europe to buy furniture and rugs. He stocked his department for all time with the antiques he bought for Marie Antoinette. The costumes were nigh museum items. There were 152 roles to be garbed. The studio's great technical departments were triumphantly tested on this film. (The Lion's Share, p. 244)\n\nAs the queen of France who died on the guillotine during the revolution, Shearer gave the performance of her career. Fine support was given by Robert Morley, John Barrymore, Joseph Schildkraut, and Gladys George, among others. Tyrone Power, on loan from 20th Century-Fox, was the nominal leading man, but his presence was lost in the spectacle. Although the picture grossed a handsome $3 million, it was not enough to recoup the negative cost.34\n\nOf the remaining MGM prestige pictures, several deserve mention. The first, San Francisco (W. S. Van Dyke, 1936), was a disaster film with songs. Anita Loos wrote the screenplay from a story by Robert Hopkins, and John Emerson, Loos's husband, co-produced the picture with Bernard Hyman. Set on the Barbary Coast of San Francisco in 1906, the picture teamed Clark Gable, as Blackie Norton, the owner of a music-hall saloon, and Jeanette MacDonald, as Mary Blake, an aspiring prima donna torn between the cabaret and the opera house. MacDonald's numbers alternated between rousing popular songs (\"Would You?\" and \"San Francisco\"), religious numbers (\"Hosannah\" and \"Nearer My God to Thee\"), and operatic arias. A ten-minute earthquake sequence, the creation of special-effects artist A. Arnold Gillespie and editor John Hoffman, marked the climax, which the New York Times described as \"a shattering spectacle, one of the truly great cinematic illusions; a monstrous, hideous, thrilling debacle with great fissures opening in the earth, buildings crumbling, men and women apparently being buried beneath showers of stone and plaster, gargoyles lurching from rooftops, watermains bursting, live wires flaring, flame, panic and terror.\"35 Produced at a cost of $1.3 million, the picture was a huge hit, making it to Variety's and Film Daily's honor rolls, and inspiring a cycle of big-budget disaster pictures.\n\nLouis D. Lighten, a new producer to MGM's ranks, produced the greatly admired Captains Courageous (Victor Fleming, 1937), an adventure picture featuring Freddie Bartholomew and Spencer Tracy that was based on Rudyard Kipling's tale about \"an imperious and detestable young scamp who toppled from a liner's rail off the Grand Banks, was picked up by a Portuguese doryman … and became a regular fellow during an enforced three-months' fishing cruise.\"36 Tracy, who won his first Oscar for best actor, became a star with this picture.\n\nMGM's prestige lineup also includes two noteworthy British pictures, The Citadel (1938) and Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939). Both were produced by Victor Saville at MGM's Denham Studios outside London to meet Great Britain's quota requirements for foreign film companies. The quota requirements specified that foreign film companies had to distribute a certain number of pictures each year produced in Great Britain by an all-British cast and crew, with the exception of the director and one star. The law assumed that the presence of these talents in a picture would be enough to make the it palatable for an American audience.\n\nThe Citadel (King Vidor) was based on A. J. Cronin's novel \"about a young Scots doctor who changes objectives in mid-career and has to be jolted back into the line of humble medical service again.\" Ian Dalrymple, Frank Wead, Elizabeth Hill, and Emlyn Williams wrote the screenplay. Robert Donat headed the British cast, playing Andrew Manson, M.D., a character whom Cronin patterned after himself. The American contingent consisted of King Vidor and Rosalind Russell, who played Donat's wife. According to the New York Times, Vidor succeeded in making a film having \"the pace of a Hollywood production, the honest characterization typical of England's best films, and the sincerity and depth which are proper to no country but are in the public domain of drama.\"37\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Chips (Sam Wood), another vehicle for Robert Donat, was based on James Hilton's sentimental novella about a gentle teacher at an English public school. The New York Times described the story as follows: \"The Mr. Chips of the Hilton [fictional] biography was the somewhat dull young pedant who came to Brookfield's ivy-grown walls in his twenties, took quiet root there, languished miserably for a decade or two and then, under the tender cultivation of a woman's hand became such a human, quizzical and understanding person that all Brookfield eventually began to regard him as an institution.\"38 R. C. Sherriff, Claudine West, and Eric Maschwitz wrote the screenplay. Greer Garson, making her screen debut, played Chips's wife. Donat's tour de force performance, in which he aged from twenty-four to eighty-three, was so moving that he beat out Clark Gable in the Academy Award balloting for best actor. A smash hit everywhere, the picture topped the Film Daily poll.\n\nWarners ranked second in the number of prestige pictures that made it to Film Daily's Ten Best. After the failure of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the studio turned to the American theater and produced a classic of quite another sort. The Green Pastures (1936) was based on Marc Connelly's Pulitzer Prize-winning folk drama, which told the creation myth in \"terms that a southern black preacher might have used to explain Genesis to his Sunday school pupils.\" Opening in 1930, the play enjoyed a five-year run on Broadway and on the road with an all-black cast. Warners spent $800,000 to replicate the play. Connelly did the adaptation and shared the directing with William Keighley. And like its Broadway counterpart, the film had an all-black cast featuring Rex Ingram as De Lawd, Oscar Polk as Gabriel, Eddie Anderson as Noah, and Frank Wilson as Moses. Although the nation's press lavished praise on the picture, it did only moderate business. \"American racial sensibilities had begun to change [by 1935],\" explained Thomas Cripps, and \"the movie could make only a fraction of the monumental impact of the Broadway production; it neither celebrated nor memorialized racial history; it merely repeated itself.\"39\n\nWarners got the prestige formula right in 1936 when it produced The Story of Louis Pasteur, Anthony Adverse, and The Charge of the Light Brigade. \"Thereafter the pattern was set for the rest of the decade,\" said Nick Roddick. \"Energies were concentrated on one major prestige production per year, which almost invariably turned out to be Warners' most successful movie.\" The key production personnel who shaped the Paul Muni biopics consisted of associate producer Henry Blanke, director William Dieterle, cinematographer Tony Gaudio, and editor Warren Low. Pasteur established the narrative formula for the pictures, which Variety described as follows: \"As is usual with films using historical figures as protagonist the menace is the impersonalized symbolism of ignorance and redtape.… In each instance the farsighted and heroic central figure fought with narrow-minded and unimaginative defenders of things as they are and won a victory over the obstructive elements.\"40\n\nThe conflict in Pasteur is between \"crusading science, on the one hand, and entrenched medical stupidity, on the other,\" as personified by the French Academy of Sciences and its president. Pasteur, like most biopics, played fast and loose with the facts. The New York Times noted that the picture ignored the work of such scientists as Lister and Koch, and made Pasteur \"the only voice crying out in a wilderness of medical ignorance for physicians to wash their hands, boil their instruments and so avoid infecting their patients with puerperal fever.\" But in defense of the picture, Roddick said, \"The screenplay's aim is to make the impact of the hero's discoveries accessible to audiences who know little and care less about preventive medicine in particular and scientific discoveries in general.\"41 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences seemingly made a similar assessment by awarding Sheridan Gibney and Pierre Collings an Oscar for their screenplay. Muni won the Oscar for best actor.\n\nThe Life of Emile Zola (1937) was clearly designed as a sequel. \"Pasteur fought bacteria, while Zola opposed lies.… Like Pasteur, who had to face obstacles, Zola had to suffer from defamation, prison, flight, and deportation.\" However, Zola was designed to make more of a political statement than Pasteur. From the very inception of the project, \"the Dreyfus affair\" was to be the central focus of the story and Zola's literary career the \"backstory.\" By highlighting Zola's fight to free Captain Alfred Dreyfus, who \"was in 1894 accused on the flimsiest evidence (presumably because he was Jewish) of selling military secrets to the Germans and condemned to Devil's Island for life,\" Warners alluded to anti-Semitism and placed the picture squarely in its tradition of social consciousness. The New York Times said of the picture, \"Rich, dignified, honest and strong, it is at once the finest historical film ever made and the greatest screen biography, greater even than The Story of Louis Pasteur, with which the Warners squared their conscience last year.\"42 Among the honors heaped on the picture, an Academy Award was given to Norman Reilly Raine, Heinz Herald, and Geza Herczeg for their screenplay. Paul Muni was edged out for the best-actor Oscar by Spencer Tracy in Captains Courageous, but Joseph Schildkraut, who played Alfred Dreyfus, received the award for best supporting actor.\n\nJuarez (1939), the third Muni biopic, was a portrait of Benito Juárez, the Mexican patriot and liberator who overthrew Napoleon Ill's puppet regime in Mexico in 1867. The screenplay, written by John Huston, Wolfgang Reinhardt, and Aeneas MacKenzie, was based on a play by Franz Werfel and the novel The Phantom Crown, by Bertita Harding. Brian Aherne played Maximilian; Bette Davis, his wife, Carlotta; and Claude Rains, Napoleon III. Produced at a cost of $1.25 million, making it by far the most expensive biopic in the series, Juarez had far wider scope than the previous Muni biopics, and true to Warners' tradition of social consciousness, it made the most overt political statement of the series. As Variety remarked, the picture introduced \"historical data that contains current timeliness. There is frequent mention of the Monroe Doctrine, of one-man rule over the lives and destinies of millions, and of the rights of the common man to possess land and work out his own salvation.\" However, the picture left audiences cool. Juarez \"had more going against it than its obvious technical and artistic flaws,\" said Paul Vanderwood. \"In 1939 most American were either confused by or unconcerned with international events; not many understood the ideological arguments at hand.\"43\n\nWarners' costume-adventure films fared much better at the box office. Two pictures signaled the shift, Captain Blood (Michael Curtiz, 1935) and Anthony Adverse (Mervyn LeRoy, 1936). A remake of a 1923 Vitagraph silent, Captain Blood, described by Variety as \"a lavish, swashbuckling saga of the Spanish main,\" was released in December 1935 on the heels of MGM's Mutiny on the Bounty. Casey Robinson adapted Rafael Sabatini's rousing historical novel set in the West Indies of the 1680s about a doctor-turned-pirate who leads his \"Brotherhood of Buccaneers\" to fight for the cause of England. Warners had originally signed Robert Donat for the lead, but for unknown reasons, he bowed out. The studio then decided to take a gamble on a relatively unknown contract player from Australia, Errol Flynn. Olivia de Havilland, who had come to Warners' attention in A Midsummer Night's Dream, was chosen to add romantic interest. The opening scenes dragged, there were inconsistencies in the plot, and the picture contained only one spectacular scene, the climactic sea battle; nonetheless, it was enthusiastically received. It also made stars out of Flynn and de Havilland.\n\nIf Captain Blood showed signs of Warners' economizing, Anthony Adverse exhibited an uncharacteristic extravagance. Frank Nugent of the New York Times introduced the picture as follows:\n\nAmerica has the tallest buildings, the longest subways, the most chewing gum, the hardiest flag-pole sitters, Hervey Allen's 1,224-page Anthony Adverse and the Warner's gargantuan film edition of it. If size is your deity and you feel you will be impressed to hear that eighty-odd speaking parts and a cast of 2,000 have shared the task of translating Anthony into film, then you will relish the Strand's new picture. (NYTFR, 27 August 1936)\n\nProduced at a cost of more than $1 million, this 141-minute version of Allen's 1933 picaresque novel probably \"set Warners on a course of large-scale costume pictures which would continue through to the end of the decade,\" according to Roddick.44 Starring Fredric March in the title role, this episodic picture is set in the Napoleonic era and follows the adventures of a young man from Naples to Africa, the Caribbean, and Paris. Although it received mixed reviews, the picture became Warners' most successful picture of the year and even won four Academy Awards, including best supporting actress (Gale Sondergaard, receiving the first-ever Oscar in that category), cinematography, and score.\n\nHaving discovered a new star in Errol Flynn, Warners embarked on a cycle of costume-adventure pictures that combined the talents of Flynn with Olivia de Havilland and Michael Curtiz. In all these pictures, Flynn plays \"a man for whom moral and political decisions are unambiguous, and who is provided with the chance to put these decisions into practice through direct physical action.\" Erich Wolfgang Korngold's lush musical scores added immense charm to the cycle.45\n\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade (1936) solidified the cycle. Adapted from the Tennyson poem by Michel Jacoby and Rowland Leigh, the picture was probably inspired by Paramount's Lives of a Bengal Lancer (Henry Hathaway, 1935), which starred Gary Cooper and Franchot Tone. Variety called Light Brigade a \"magnificent production\" with countless exploitation possibilities in which Errol Flynn \"lives up to the promise of previous film efforts as the youthful major [Geoffrey Vickers] who sacrifices all to avenge the slaughter of his comrades.\"46 The \"tremendous sweep\" of the surging charge of six hundred cavalrymen riding into the \"valley of death\" with \"sabers forward and lances leveled through a deadly thunder of cannon and rifle fire\" provided the spectacular climax.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) marked the triumph of the cycle. Originally planned for Jimmy Cagney, Robin Hood is Flynn's finest picture, for he and his role are perfectly matched: \"In Errol Flynn, Sir Robin of Sherwood Forest has found his man, a swashbuckler from peaked cap to pointed toe, defiant of his enemies and England's, graciously impudent with his lady love, quick for a fight or a frolic,\" said Frank Nugent of the New York Times. Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian provided the love interest, which was \"properly motivated and nicely woven into the plot fabric,\" unlike the usual clumsy and arbitrary treatment romantic scenes received in the typical costume-adventure picture.47 The storybook cast featured Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne and Claude Rains as Prince John.\n\nNorman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller fashioned an original screenplay based on legend and lore that contained pageantry and color, a clearly articulated populist message, humor, and a spectacular climax. Warners spent close to $2 million to produce the picture, considerably more than Douglas Fairbanks's 1922 silent Robin Hood, which at $1.5 million was the most expensive picture produced up to that time. Brilliantly photographed in three-strip Technicolor, the action shifted between scenes in Sherwood Forest, shot on location in Chico, California, and the town of Nottingham and its castle. Michael Curtiz's vigorous direction, together with Sol Polito's fluid camerawork and expressionistic lighting, articulated the picture's key moments. Carl Jules Weyl, who designed the monumental sets, was the first and only Warners art director of the decade to win an Oscar. Erich Wolfgang Korngold's score, which also received an Academy Award, added a stirring musical dimension. The Adventures of Robin Hood was named to several ten-best lists and has achieved the status of a classic.\n\nFlynn's last swashbuckler of the decade, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), began the downward trajectory of the cycle. The picture was based on Maxwell Anderson's historical drama Elizabeth the Queen, which starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in the Theatre Guild production of 1930. The script by Norman Reilly Raine and Aeneas MacKenzie retained much of the poetic quality of the original. A Technicolor production containing stylized sets by Anton Grot and an outstanding score by Korngold, the picture was directed by Michael Curtiz as a series of tableaux rather than as an action film. However, the picture was really Bette Davis's. Playing an aging but still vital Elizabeth, she held the center of focus. Flynn, as the young Earl of Essex and a suitor, was not up to his role. As the New York Times put it, \"Flynn is a good-looking young man who should be asked to do no more in pictures than flash an even-toothed smile and present a firm jaw-line. His Essex lacked a head long before the headsman got around to him.\"48 Following The Sea Hawk (1940), an almost entirely formulaic swashbuckler, Flynn specialized in Westerns and, after December 1941, war films.\n\nUnited Artists ranked third as the company with the most prestige pictures to reach the Film Daily Ten Best in the 1930s. Twentieth Century Pictures was UA's principal producer of high-quality fare from 1933 until it merged with Fox Films in 1935. During its two-year association with UA, Twentieth Century delivered eighteen pictures, including two hit prestige pictures, The House of Roth Schild (Alfred L. Werker, 1934) and Les Miserables (Richard Boleslawski, 1935)49\n\nAfter 1935, UA's principal producers of prestige pictures were Sam Goldwyn and David O. Selznick. Goldwyn remained UA's most prolific partner, delivering twenty pictures to the company from 1935 to 1939. His biggest hit was The Hurricane (John Ford and Stuart Heisler, 1937), an adaptation of the novel by James Nordhoff and James Norman Hall that starred Dorothy Lamour and Jon Hall. The most memorable thing about the picture was the twenty-minute storm sequence at the end. The handiwork of special-effects expert James Basevi, this climax, said the New York Times, contained \"a hurricane to blast you from the orchestra pit to the first mezzanine. It is a hurricane to fill your eyes with spindrift, to beat at your ears with its thunder, to clutch at your heart and send your diaphragm vaulting over your floating rib into the region just south of your tonsils. The Basevi hurricane, in a good old movie word, is terrific.\"50\n\nBut Goldwyn's reputation as a producer of class pictures was sustained by three he made in collaboration with William Wyler, Dodsworth (1936), Dead End (1937), and Wuthering Heights (1939). All experimented with adaptation, and all made it to Film Daily's Ten Best. Producing Dodsworth, a prestige woman's film, Goldwyn again turned to Sinclair Lewis, but this time via a stage version by Sidney Howard that was produced in 1932 with Walter Huston in the title role. Howard's dramatization consisted of fourteen scenes interrupted by curtains. In adapting his play for the screen, Howard retained the \"master scene\" structure, but rewrote much of what took place off-stage into the action. \"A story of the disintegrating marriage of a middle-aged couple\" during a European grand tour, the film starred Walter Huston in the role he created on Broadway; Ruth Chatterton played the wife, \"a silly, shallow, age-fearing woman of ingrained selfishness and vulgarity,\" and Mary Astor was \"the other woman.\" \"An attempt to explore a level of experience which the movies had shunned,\" Dodsworth was hailed by Variety as \"a superb motion picture which yields artistic quality and box office in one elegantly put-together package.\"51 Dodsworth was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, but won only for Richard Day's art direction. The film did a respectable business of nearly $1 million.\n\nTo produce Dead End, a prestige social problem picture, Goldwyn spent $165,000 to acquire the rights to Sidney Kingsley's long-running stage hit, a considerable amount for the time. Like Elmer Rice's Street Scene, which Goldwyn adapted in 1931, Kingsley's naturalistic drama depicted tenements as the breeding ground of crime. It starred Sylvia Sidney as Drina, \"the same optimistic city-dweller she had played in Goldwyn's Street Scene,\" and Joel McCrea as Dave Connell, who is sucked back into the slums after six years of studying to become an architect. Goldwyn borrowed Humphrey Bogart from Warners to play \"Baby Face\" Martin, an ex-con who returns to his old neighborhood after ten years unrepentant and unreformed. Leo Gorcey and five other players from the stage production (who became known as the Dead End Kids) were chosen to reprise their roles as juvenile delinquents. Lillian Hellman did a \"near-literal film adaptation\" of the play, and true to the original, confined the action to a single setting, the waterfront along New York's East River, to intensify \"the claustrophobia felt by their trapped characters.\" Richard Day designed \"a realistic set that jammed slums right up against a luxury apartment, wooden docks, and an inlet of the East River into which the Dead End Kids could dive. It offered many different levels and angles with which Wyler and Toland could create visual interest.\"52 Considered an \"important\" picture of social protest, Dead End grossed more than $1.4 million.\n\nGoldwyn's Wuthering Heights was one of the most widely admired pictures of the decade, winning the New York Film Critics award for best picture, among other honors. Based on Emily Brontë's strange tale of a tortured romance, it starred Laurence Olivier as the demon-possed Heathcliff and Merle Oberon as his beloved Cathy. Originally written on speculation for UA's Walter Wanger, the screenplay by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur did a major job of surgery on the novel by going \"straight to the heart of the book,\" exploring its shadows and drawing \"dramatic fire from the savage flints of scene and character hidden there.\" Art director James Basevi recreated an authentic version of the Yorkshire moors in the San Fernando Valley and, at Goldwyn's insistence, advanced the period of the setting from the Regency to the Victorian to better show off Merle Oberon and the women. William Wyler's sensitive direction, Gregg Toland's chiaroscuro lighting and deep-focus photography, and Alfred Newman's evocative score created \"one of the most distinguised pictures of the year,\" in the opinion of New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent.53 More attuned to popular tastes, Variety observed,\n\nWuthering Heights will have to depend on class audiences. Its general sombreness and psychological tragedy is too heavy for general appeal. With that setup, and lacking socko marquee dressing, picture is more of an artistic success for the carriage trade.… Stark tragedy is vividly etched throughout. Tempo is at a slow pace, with many sequences devoted to development of psychological reactions of the characters. It's rather dull material for general audiences. (VFR, 29 March 1939)\n\nWuthering Heights grossed $1.2 million in the United States, a respectable amount, but not enough to break even. Presumably, the uncompromising treatment of the story kept the masses at bay.\n\nDavid O. Selznick joined United Artists in 1935. In forming Selznick International Pictures (SIP), Selznick described his production policy: \"There are only two kinds of merchandise that can be made profitably in this business, either the very cheap pictures or the very expensive pictures.\" Concerning SIP, he said, \"There is no alternative open to us but to attempt to compete with the very best.\"54 Selznick produced nine pictures for UA before he made Gone With the Wind. Prestige pictures based on literary classics figured prominently in his roster, among them Little Lord Fauntleroy (John Cromwell, 1936), The Prisoner of Zenda (John Cromwell, 1937), and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Norman Taurog, 1938).\n\nHowever, only A Star Is Born (William Wellman, 1937) made it to Film Daily's Ten Best. Based partly on RKO's What Price Hollywood? (George Cukor, 1932), which Pandro S. Berman produced when Selznick was executive head of the studio, A Star Is Born was essentially a celebrity biopic based on composites of Hollywood types. Effectively using Technicolor, the movie presented \"the most accurate mirror ever held before the glitering, tinseled, trivial, generous, cruel and ecstatic world that is Hollywood,\" in the opinion of the New York Times.55 Janet Gaynor played the Cinderella role of Vicki Lester, and Fredric March, Norman Maine, her alcoholic husband, who once was the biggest star in Hollywood. William Wellman and Robert Carson won an Oscar for their original story.\n\nSelznick acquired the motion-picture rights to Margaret Mitchell's 1,037-page novel Gone with the Wind for $50,000 in June 1936, just as it hit the market. After the novel was accepted by the Book-of-the-Month Club, Macmillan, the publisher, boosted the original print order to forty thousand from ten thousand. Rave reviews, the Pulizer Prize, and word-of-mouth publicity made Gone with the Wind, the first novel of a thirty-five-year-old Atlanta housewife, the most popular American novel ever written to that time. By 1937, one year after publication, \"sales of the novel had reached the astonishing figure of 1,375,000, with no let-up in sight, confirming the book's unofficial status as a modern classic.\" By the time of the film's premiere in December 1939, more than 2 million copies of the book had been sold.56\n\nIf there ever was a presold motion picture, Gone with the Wind was it. As Roger Dooley put it, \"Gone with the Wind seems never to have lost its grip on the public imagination since the novel was published. From 1936 to 1939 the amount of publicity it received, some promoted by Selznick, much spontaneous, was unparalled in this century.\"57 American fans took over the job of casting the role of Rhett Butler. Clark Gable, named in a national poll as the \"King of Hollywood,\" was the public's unanimous choice for the part of Rhett Butler. However, he was securely tied to MGM. To borrow Gable from the studio as well as money to complete the financing of the picture, Selznick approached his father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer. Driving a hard bargain, Mayer offered Gable's services and $1.25 million in financing, but demanded in return the distribution rights to the picture and 50 percent of the profits for five years. Selznick had no choice but to sign on the dotted line.58\n\nFinding someone to play Scarlett was another matter. Of all the devices Selznick used to generate interest in the film, the talent search proved the most effective. Selznick had used the ploy before, but this time he received the cooperation of nearly \"every female performer between the ages of Shirley Temple and May Robson\" who had decided she must have the part.59 Selznick's people toured the country, auditioning candidates from high school, college drama departments, and community theaters. Finally, on 13 January 1939, Selznick announced that the Scarlett O'Hara sweepstakes had been won by Vivien Leigh, a young British actress who was comparatively unknown in this country.\n\nDeveloping the picture, Selznick was obligated to remain faithful to the source, yet the epic size novel presented enormous difficulties. Using the talent search to gain time, Selznick hired Sidney Howard, the Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist, to develop the script. Starting on the mammoth project in 1937, Howard continued to work on the construction and dialogue of the second half while the picture was in production.60 In addition to Howard, Selznick's production staff consisted of seasoned Hollywood professionals that included the distinguished production designer William Cameron Menzies, art director Lyle Wheeler, costume designer Walter Plunkett, special-effects designer Jack Cosgrove, cameramen Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan, and composer Max Steiner. Selznick chose George Cukor to direct, but personal differences between Cukor and Gable shortly into the shoot forced Selznick to replace Cukor with Victor Fleming.\n\nGone with the Wind \"was innovative in many ways in the film industry: cost, length, fidelity to the source, and especially the way it pushed the frontiers of Technicolor photography to their limits of excellence.\"61 It cost $4,085,790 to make—more than any picture had ever cost in the entire history of the American film industry. Running more than three and a half hours, the picture was nearly twice the length of a conventional feature.\n\nUsing a premiere to launch a picture was a common practice, but the Gone with the Wind premiere in Atlanta on 15 December 1939 established a new high for motion-picture publicity. According to Newsweek, \"Governor E. D. Rivers proclaimed Friday, the day of the premiere, a public holiday throughout the state; all state buildings were closed and the Confederate banner flew from the Capitol masthead beside the flag of the United States. Atlanta went the governor two better; Mayor Hartsfield declared a three-day festival.\"62 Half of Atlanta's 300,000 population lined the streets to greet the motorcade that carried the film's stars, feature players, and executives from the airport to their hotel. The city presented an appropriate facade, celebrating the architecture and finery of the 1860s, with its citizens dressed up in the hoop skirts and claw-hammer coats of the antebellum era. The highlight of the festivities was a charity ball at the City Auditorium the night before the premiere.\n\nA few days after the Atlanta premiere, the picture opened in New York simultaneously at the Capitol and the Astor on a reserved-seat basis. The Hollywood premiere took place on 27 December 1939 at the venerable and prestigious Cathay Circle Theater in the Wilshire District. January marked the beginning of the national roadshow play-off, the most prestigious form of release. In all the key cities, the picture was shown on a reserved-seat basis at top ticket prices and with an intermission after an hour and forty-five minutes.\n\nAt Academy Award time, Gone with the Wind won an unprecedented eight Oscars in most major categories. Hattie McDaniel received an Academy Award for supporting actress, which marked the first time a black had ever been nominated, let alone honored. In recognition of Menzies's contribution, Selznick created the special credit \"Production Designed by William Cameron Menzies.\" Since there was no precedent for what Menzies had done, the Academy awarded him a special plaque at the Oscar ceremonies to recognize his \"outstanding achievement in the use of color for the enhancement of dramatic mood.\" Clark Gable did not win the Oscar for best actor; that honor went to Robert Donat for his title role in Goodbye, Mr. Chips. Nor did Steiner win an Oscar for his score, oddly enough, because the Academy rules for the music category did not distinguish between dramas and musicals. The Oscar that year went to the musical classic The Wizard of Oz. However, Selznick won the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his efforts as producer.\n\nThe box-office returns matched the picture's epic scope. By the end of May 1940, the picture had grossed an astonishing $20 million. No picture had ever come close to this. This gross was from the first roadshow play-off. Yet to come were the general release and the return engagements. When the results were in, Gone with the Wind had established a box-office record that stood for more than twenty years.\n\nMusicals\n\nThe musical, the only new production trend to grow out of the talkies, had become box-office poison by the summer of 1930. That season, said Variety, \"marked the end of the gold rush west and the long portage back by many of the New York contingent…. They pushed the musicals beyond the pale of public acceptance, so they can't make pictures with tunes any more, or at least for a few months.\" Hollywood released sixty musicals in 1928 and over seventy in 1930, but by 1932, the number had fallen to less than fifteen. Musicals proliferated after the conversion to sound because the public, at least at first, grew tired of endless dialogue. Musicals, moreover, created ancillary profits for the music-publishing and phonograph companies newly acquired by the majors. As Alexander Walker pointed out, \"between 100,000 and 500,000 sheets of a song could be sold, and an equal number of discs, within a month of a successful musical's release. (Without a film behind it, a song was usually lucky to sell 30,000 copies in three months.)\"63\n\nIn its rush to capitalize on sound, Hollywood initially experimented with three types of musicals, the all-star revue, the Broadway adaptation, and the backstager. The revue was used by producers to showcase stars and contract players and to offer \"proof positive that everyone could now talk, sing and dance at least passably well.\"64 Modeled after vaudeville and burlesque and perfected by Florenz Ziegfeld, Earl Carroll, and other Broadway showmen, the revue was essentially a series of comic sketches, gaudy musical numbers, acrobatics, and even short dramas presented in a variety format, each introduced by a master of ceremonies. Elaborate routines, especially big dance numbers, might be photographed in two-strip Technicolor. Shot straight on in front of the proscenium, this type of musical was the most stage-bound of all. Among the more memorable revues are MGM's The Hollywood Revue of 1929, Warners' The Show of Shows (1929), Fox's Movietone Follies of 1929, Paramount's Paramount on Parade (1930), and Universal's King of Jazz (1930).\n\nThe Broadway adaptation transferred operettas and musicals to the screen. Warners led the way with its production of The Desert Song (Roy Del Ruth, 1929), which was based on the popular operetta by Sigmund Romberg; it was followed by MGM's The Rogue Song (Lionel Barrymore, 1930) and Paramount's The Vagabond King (Ludwig Berger, 1930), which were adaptations of Franz Lehár and Rudolf Friml operettas, respectively. The most successful adaptations, RKO's Rio Rita (Luther Reed, 1929) and UA's Whoopee! (Thornton Freeland, 1930), were based on Flo Ziegfeld hits.\n\nRio Rita, a musical western extravaganza, grossed an incredible $2.4 million. Whoopee! did even better and started a series. Produced by Sam Goldwyn at a cost of $1 million, the picture was an adaptation of a smash musical comedy built around Eddie Cantor. To bring Eddie Cantor to the screen, Goldwyn hired Ziegfeld to co-produce the picture and Busby Berkeley, the dance director, to restage his numbers. Goldwyn also hired most of the original Broadway cast to repeat their roles. Calling Whoopee! the best musical comedy to date, Variety liked just about everything in the picture—its effective use of Technicolor throughout; Cantor's comic antics and his songs, particularly \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" and \"Makin' Whoopee\"; and Berkeley's numbers, particularly the Lady Godiva routine that was shot with an overhead camera. A personality-centered musical, Whoopee! made little attempt to integrate the comedy routines, songs, and story. Nonetheless, Cantor's feature-film debut grossed over $2.6 million worldwide and started a popular series that included Palmy Days (1931), The Kid From Spain (1932), and Roman Scandals (1933). All were released through United Artists.\n\nThe backstage musical was the most enduring cycle of the lot. MGM's The Broadway Melody (Harry Beaumont, 1929), the studio's first sound feature, set the pattern for all the show-business pictures to follow. Promoted as \"All Talking! All Singing! All Dancing!\" The Broadway Melody was \"the first movie to use songs both within a story and as part of a Broadway show being performed, and it was the first to have an original score created specifically for its use.\" The songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed contained several hits—\"You Were Meant for Me,\" \"The Wedding of the Painted Doll,\" and the title song, \"Broadway Melody.\" The screenplay by Edmund Goulding contained in pristine simplicity the main elements of the cycle—backstage romances, wise-cracking chorines, an imperious impresario, a dilettante backer, and big-hearted moments. Charles King played a song-and-dance-man, and Bessie Love and Anita Page, two sisters from the Midwest who try to break into show business. Chosen by exhibitors nationwide as their premiere sound attraction, the picture made over $4 million by the end of 1929 on an investment of $2,80,000. So many imitations of The Broadway Melody were rushed into production that within a year, Variety published an article entitled \"Ingredients for Backstage Talkers\" that satirized all the hackneyed elements of the cycle.65\n\nOf all the early experiments to enliven the musical, none were as innovative as Paramount's continental fairy tales. These pictures eliminated much of the staginess that had characterized the early sound musical by shooting the musical scenes with some flexibility and by integrating story, locale, and scoring through editing. The cycle was short, consisting of three pictures directed by Ernst Lubitsch and one by Rouben Mamoulian. Built around Maurice Chevalier and/or Jeanette MacDonald, all are set in Europe rather than America and all are highly stylized.\n\nErnst Lubitsch's first sound film, The Love Parade (1929), started the cycle. A frothy operetta set in the mythical Central European kingdom of Sylvania, The Love Parade teamed Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald for the first time. Chevalier, the international music-hall star whom Variety called the \"'it' man from France,\" had starred in one other talkie; MacDonald, fresh from the musical-comedy stage, here made her motion-picture debut. Victor Schertzinger and Clifford Grey composed the score, and Ernest Vajda and Guy Bolton wrote the script, which was based on a French play. Lubitsch's use of the moving camera, editing, and off-stage business that inventively blended song and action led Variety to call The Love Parade \"the first true screen musical.\"66 A big hit, the picture made it to Variety's list of top-grossing pictures in 1930 and made MacDonald a star.\n\nRouben Mamoulian's Love Me Tonight (1932), which concluded the cycle, was even more innovative in the way it expanded what Gerald Mast calls \"the choreography of space.\" This Ruritanian operetta was written by Samuel Hoffenstein, Waldemar Young, and George Marion, Jr., from a French play. Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart wrote the score, which contains three of their most memorable songs—\"Isn't It Romantic?\" \"Mimi,\" and \"Lover.\" Of the picture's many cinematic highlights, none is more inventive than the opening sequence. Variety described the sequence as follows:\n\nIt is dawn over the vacant, sunlit street of Paris. First a street worker hammers at the pavements, a cobbler pounds at his last, a vagrant snores in a doorway and a knife grinder grates over his grindstone. Gradually other sounds of the waking day work into a jazzy cadenza as the camera walks into the bedroom of the gay young tailor (Chevalier) waking to a new day with a song on his lips. Roulade is \"Isn't It Romantic?\" a rollicksome canticle that seizes everybody he passes on the street, until a squad of maneuvering militiamen out in the country bring it to the ears of the Princess heroine. (VFR, 23 August 1932)\n\nBecause the cycle contained so-called risqué, naughty, and salacious moments, it is commonly assumed that the continental fairy tale operetta was a casualty of the Breen Office. However, Variety offered another explanation for its demise when its review of Lubitsch's The Smiling Lieutenant (1931) implied that the producers of the picture were out of touch with the audience: \"Their trouble is gauging the fan mentality, which they constantly outdistance by that foreign flair for matters classing as politely risqué comedy…. what they do is funny at the Criterion, for $2, but may not register so solidly out of town.\" Its review of Love Me Tonight said the picture would probably \"miss slightly for general release\" because it was based on an original source \"alien to American ideas\" and the story was \"innocent of that commodity called American hoke, and few pictures go to the heights without it within Mr. [Herbert] Hoover's borders.\"67\n\nWarners discovered a formula to revive the musical in 1933 when it produced three Busby Berkeley musicals in a row, 42nd Street, Gold Digers of 1933, and Footlight Parade. Motivated in part by exhibitors who demanded something to compete with music headliners on radio and by the poor box-office returns of revues, Darryl Zanuck decided to resurrect the backstage musical. Unlike the Lubitsch-type operettas, these Berkeley musicals were set in the very real world of Depression America and told gritty stories of backstage life spiced with platoons of chorus girls, upbeat music, and sex. The pictures were admired for their realism. Variety, for example, said of 42nd Street, \"Everything about the production rings true. It's as authentic to the initiate as the novitiate.\"68\n\nWhat made the series distinctive, of course, was Busby Berkeley's production numbers. Berkeley had used chiaroscuro and kaleidoscopic camerawork—including traveling shots, rhythmic cutting, and his famous overhead shots (the \"Berkeley top shot\")—at Goldwyn in the dance numbers for the Eddie Cantor musicals. At Warners, Berkeley took advantage of the studio's enormous technical resources to perfect these techniques and made himself into a legend in the process.\n\nThe Berkeley musical contained two types of music, rehearsal numbers sprinkled throughout the film and the formal Berkeley pieces, which Gerald Mast calls \"Big Musical Numbers,\" typically performed one after another at the climax in the following characteristic sequence: (1) a song built on a \"sexually suggestive location\"; (2) an \"abstract-geometric number\"; and (3) a \"social-commentary number.\" The songs that form the basis for the numbers also follow a pattern: a fox-trot first, a waltz second, and a march third. The screenplays contained nothing to suggest the songs or how they might be staged. To produce the musicals, the songs came first, with lyrics by Al Dubin and then the music by Harry Warren; afterward, Berkeley took over.69\n\nBerkeley's collaborators were director Lloyd Bacon, whose principal job was to keep the action moving at a fast pace; art director Anton Grot; costume designer Orry-Kelly; cinematographer Sol Polito; and songwriters Harry Warren and Al Dubin. In front of the camera, Warners used familiar faces from its stock company: Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler as the favored romantic team; Joan Blondell, Ginger Rogers, Una Merkel, Aline MacMahon, and Glenda Farrell as tough-as-nails gold diggers; and Ned Sparks, Guy Kibbee, Louise Fazenda, Frank McHugh, and Hugh Herbert as favorite clowns.\n\nLaunched by a coast-to-coast publicity campaign, 42nd Street (Lloyd Bacon) became a smash hit, a milestone that Variety labeled \"the Broadway Melody of 1933.\"70 Adapted by James Seymour and Rian James from a novel by Bradford Ropes, the picture incorporates ingredients from such pioneering efforts as MGM's The Broadway Melody (1929) and Warners' On with the Show (1929). 42nd Street follows a Broadway-bound musical comedy called Pretty Lady from its first rehearsals to its out-of-town tryout. Along the way, the audience is introduced to a slave-driving director (Warner Baxter), a lecherous financial backer (Guy Kibbee), an over-the-hill star (Bebe Daniels), juvenile leads (Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell), hard-boiled chorus girls (Ginger Rogers and Una Merkel), plus other assorted types.\n\nThe story uses a hoary Cinderella plot device: the temperamental leading lady sprains her ankle just before opening night and is replaced by an unknown chorus girl, who thereby becomes a star. Ruby Keeler, who plays the unknown chorus girl Peggy Sawyer, receives the following pep talk from Warner Baxter, the director, just as she goes on:\n\nNow listen to me—listen hard…. Two hundred people—two hundred jobs—two hundred thousand dollars—five weeks of grind—and blood and sweat—depend on you. It's the life of all these people who have worked with you. You've got to go on—and you've got to give—and give and give—they've GOT to like you—GOT to—you understand…. You can't fall down—you can't—Your future's in it—my future's in it—and everything that all of us have is staked on you—All right, now I'm through—but you keep your feet on the ground—and your head on those shoulders of yours—and go out—and, Sawyer—you're going out a youngster—but you've GOT to come back a star! (Rocco Fumento, ed., 42nd Street [Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1980], p. 182)\n\nKeeler goes on to perform the first big musical number of the picture, \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo,\" a duet with Clarence Nordstrom staged on a honeymoon train to Niagara Falls. Although the number resembles a conventional theatrical prologue and could have been sung and danced on a Broadway stage, Berkeley added an impressive stunt: he breaks apart the Pullman car like a jaekknife and moves his camera down the aisle to leer at amorous couples in their compartments. The second big number, \"Young and Healthy,\" is a kaleidoscopic piece sung by Dick Powell and displays a bevy of chorines on a huge revolving platform. For \"42nd Street,\" a spectacular six-minute finale, Berkeley used his full bag of tricks. After starting out with Ruby Keeler singing the title song and tap dancing atop a taxi, the number opens up into an expressionistic ballet that mixes melodrama, farce, and comedy, and concludes with a cutout of the New York skyline that parts to reveal Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell atop a skyscraper waving to the camera.\n\nWarners had completed 42nd Street by the end of 1932, but held up the release after the first preview until a sequel was put into production. Written by Erwin Gelsey and James Seymour, Gold Diggers of 1933 (Mervyn LeRoy) is based on Avery Hopwood's play Gold Diggers, a well-worn property Warners had used for a silent in 1923 and for a musical, in Gold Diggers of Broadway, in 1929. Gold Diggers of 1933, like 42nd Street, focuses on the difficulties of financing a show during hard times. In Gold Diggers this problem is resolved by Dick Powell, an aspiring songwriter who puts up the cash to bankroll the show he has written. But as the title implies, the picture is also about gold-digging chorus girls. A subplot traces the efforts of Joan Blondell and Aline MacMahon to stymie the efforts of Powell's stuffy older brother and the befuddled family lawyer to break up Powell's engagement to show girl Ruby Keeler. A Cinderella plot device is also used in this picture; this time the juvenile lead suffers a bout of lumbago, and Powell goes on in his place.\n\nGiven a free hand by the studio, Berkeley created numbers that were longer and more elaborate than previously. The picture opens with a rehearsal number for a Broadway revue, \"We're in the Money.\" Offered as a morale booster for Depression audiences, the song was performed by chorines (led by Ginger Rogers) clad only in large, strategically placed gold coins. The big musical numbers consist of \"Pettin' in the Park,\" a risqué piece displaying girls in skimpy lingerie and in nude silhouette; \"The Shadow Waltz,\" a pageant featuring a stageful of hooped-gowned dancers who play neon-lighted violins and create a series of geometric patterns; and \"Remember My Forgotten Man,\" Berkeley's paean to America's unemployed inspired by the then-recent march on Washington of despera"
