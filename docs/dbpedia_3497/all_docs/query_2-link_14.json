Don, who has fallen in love with Ginger himself, realizes that the act will devastate Ginger and her father, and decides to protect them by calling off the act, but Wingate rejects his pleas. At a masquerade party on the eve of the show's opening, Ginger is introduced to Don, the masked host, and later reports to \"Harry Mann\" that she was thrilled by the delightful host. The play opens to uproarious laughter at the Bolivar troupe's act. Interpreting the audience's response as an insult, Ginger leaves the theater despondent. Don follows her, in blackface for his next act, but the rain soon washes away his disguise, thus revealing his identity. Because Ginger believes she has been deceived, the Bolivars pull their troupe out of New York and head back upstate, where they resume their search for another actor to play the Confederate soldier. Don, still in love with Ginger, has followed the troupe, and presents himself to Ginger at the audition, where the leading lady takes him back into her arms after he delivers the line \"I love you\" more convincingly than the other applicants.\n\nLess"
