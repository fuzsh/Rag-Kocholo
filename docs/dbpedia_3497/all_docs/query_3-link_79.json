        "text": "BROOKLYN, NY -- Award-winning animation director Peter Sluszka has released the first official trailer for his new stop-motion short film, Hardboiled. The trailer showcases the elaborate hand-crafted sets and the meticulous stop-frame character animation with a healthy dose of period-specific trailer tropes.\n\nHardboiled is a stop-motion satire of the urban American crime drama that features a cast of food. The film follows the exploits of tough talking detectives, Harry and Callaham (an egg and a slice of ham) as they frustrate their boss, an irascible knish, shake down a sleazy bacon pimp, and tangle with a megalomaniacal strawberry.\n\nThe film features the voice talents of Tony award-winning actor George Irving, who also voiced the original Heatmiser, and Emmy award-winning actress Anne Heche, as well as Lola Glaudini, Joey Wells and Edd Hall.\n\nSluszka’s career in animation spans 18 years and various media, including commercials, music videos, television, and feature films. He’s collaborated with such visionaries as Michel Gondry and Bjork and has garnered accolades from across the industry.\n\nCurrently in production in Brooklyn, New York, Hardboiled is 80 percent complete and is expected to wrap in mid-2017. An Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, which has raised $11,145 from 108 backers towards a flexible goal of $75,000, is underway to help raise funds to finish the film.\n\nFor more information, visit hardboiledfilm.com or follow along behind the scenes on Instagram @hardboiledfilm.\n\nSource: Hardboiled"
