        "text": "Poverty-stricken Grand National certainly had something to sing about in 1938. The upstart studio had somehow managed to corral both James Cagney and director/songsmith Victor Schertzinger, not to mention the pretty Evelyn Daw, a discovery of Schertzinger. What they didn't have, alas, was an adequate budget -- a reported 450,000 dollars was hardly enough for what was meant to be a top-grade musical -- or a good story. Granted, James Cagney goes along way, but not even he can save Something to Sing About, which lacks both polish and a first-class score. What it does have, however, is Dwight Frye playing a gay hairdresser and that is at least somewhat entertaining."
