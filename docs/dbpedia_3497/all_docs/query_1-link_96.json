        "text": "I have to flag from the start that I used to live in Hong Kong, and whilst there, I definitely dug deep into some gems of Hong Kong cinema. But it was actually before that, at the somewhat less exotic location of Leamington Spa, whilst I was at university, that I first watched Hard Boiled. I was introduced when my Film Studies friend had a few of us over to his house. “I have this action film you’ve got to watch.”\n\nAnd even though I sat in front of his quite small television to see what it was that had him so excited, when I stood up again two hours later I had just experienced an all-out assault on the senses that is, to me, the greatest action film ever made. (Spoilers follow, because, showing the film’s credentials, it has a proper plot as well as jam-packed action).\n\nThe film opens calmly, with a scene in a jazz club with Chou Yun Fat’s character, ‘Tequila’, playing the clarinet in a band. Nice. It then switches to a tea house, where policeman Tequila and colleague Benny, are watching gun smugglers negotiate a deal whilst everyone sits around drinking tea and eating yum cha; the twist is that everyone is carrying a bird cage with a live bird in it, giving a sense of nature and peace.\n\nThis peace is then completely shattered when the deal goes wrong and the teahouse descends into a shootout of utter carnage. In a great reveal, Tequila had three guns concealed in the base of his own bird’s cage, which he breaks out to use with extreme prejudice as bad guys get taken down. Unfortunately also do a few of the good guys, including — no! — Benny, by Tequila’s own hand. When filming, the crew managed to find a location that was about to be closed, allowing them to go to town with squibs, pyrotechnics, and people falling through windows, ending in complete devastation.\n\n(Incidentally, if you think this may be realistic to Hong Kong teahouses, I can tell you that it is not: no one in teahouses carries bird cages. However, the teahouse nearest to my old office actually did have a Triad assassinated in there one morning, whilst I was at work down the road. The teahouse remains open for business to this day.)\n\nAfter the ruins of the teahouse start cooling, it is then established that the other protagonist in the story is *Tony Leung Chiu Wai’s Alan, who is deep undercover working for a Triad group, before being poached by a rival gang. Alan is the source of much of the film’s themes, and indeed, much of the ‘acting.’\n\nShould he switch from one group to the other, and betray his boss? Should he stay loyal? Or should he just go wherever he can get the most information about the Triads to relay back to the police, which he does by coding messages in song lyrics attached to flowers he sends to the Police Chief? And how is he ever going to get out of this in one piece? All the time he does this, he is making origami cranes to commemorate every person he had to kill, and sailing around on his boat, because he’s too cool for an apartment (and, in Hong Kong, the boat is probably bigger).\n\nMeanwhile, the two gangs eventually have a standoff, taking place in a warehouse where all sorts of stunt-y mayhem takes place. Not least of which is some motorbike acrobatics, with one rider sliding across the floor whilst blazing a machine gun, before righting himself to smash a rival henchman in mid-air with his bike and crush him against a wall. That’s got to hurt.\n\nWith one group victorious, the film’s pièce de résistance is the final battle which takes place in a hospital, as Tequila and Alan find the group’s weapons storage depot, and combine to take them down once and for all.\n\nThe ending was deliberately set in as incongruous location as possible for a weapons cache and hence a battle, as the police have to take down the Triads whilst also maintaining the safety of the patients, including a whole ward of babies. Again a disused spot was used for the filming, allowing the film crew to smash the entire building to pieces without anyone getting (too) upset about it.\n\nChow Yun Fat had already worked with John Woo many times before this — see also The Killer, A Better Tomorrow, and A Better Tomorrow 2, all of which are worth your time — but this was the zenith of their cooperation. Chow follows the “John McClane School of Police” as a physical everyman — no Arnie or Sly muscles on display— but he’s still effortlessly cool.\n\nChow slides down a bannister whilst shooting with both hands, maintaining a trademark toothpick in his mouth as he does so. He dives through flour that turns his face white, which then transforms to bright red as he shoots a bad guy from point-blank range and gets splattered. He abseils from a ceiling to take on a whole team of goons on his own. He slides through a morgue on a body tray, he shoots people whilst holding a baby, he jumps out of a window holding onto a phone cable (still with the baby). But it’s okay, because he’s a man of culture who plays in a band, right?\n\nMeanwhile, Woo is the conductor of the chaos, employing every technique you can think of to keep you in the thick of the action. Slow-motion, long single-take shots, wire leaps, vehicular smashes, setting stuntmen on fire whilst they crash through windows as they shoot someone, spending the entire film’s budget on squibs as all sides cause a unilateral ammunition shortage by blasting everyone and everything in their way, as the body count ends up in the hundreds.\n\nThere are a couple of hand-to-hand fights, but this is a gunfire film; the Internet Movie Firearms Database (apparently it is a thing) lists out no less than 54 distinct makes and types of guns that are used in the film. You name it, someone shoots it.\n\nBoth Chow and Woo used their Hong Kong work, but in particular, this film was a calling card to try to crack Hollywood in the 90s — to mixed success. Chow fell into the Hollywood category of “we like them but we don’t know what to do with them” as he made middling action film The Replacement Killers, the weak Bulletproof Monk, and was cast as The King of Siam opposite Jodie Foster in Anna and the King (a film that I still don’t really believe exists). That was more than enough and he went back to Asia; first film back — Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. So we all won with that decision. He has worked continuously in Chinese cinema since, albeit with more character actor roles, and less double-fisting gun ballistics.\n\nWoo also took some time to get going in the US, with the fun, but hardly essential, Hard Target and Broken Arrow. He finally hit the heights again with the classic Face/Off, before the trials and tribulations of Mission: Impossible 2 brought him back down to earth (thankfully, unlike Tom Cruise hanging off the cliff one-handed). I love John Woo, and I love Mission Impossible films, but that remains the weakest of the series. He too came back to Asia where he made the decent Red Cliff series, but his output since then has been minimal, with only a handful of films in the last 10 years. Someone give this man some sh*t to blow up!\n\nTony Leung chose to eschew Hollywood, for a while at least, staying in Hong Kong to work with the cream of Asian cinema, such as Wong Kar Wai with whom he made Chungking Express, 2046, and famously In The Mood For Love. He was in Zhang Yi Mou’s stellar Hero, Ang Lee’s good but rather naughty Love, Caution, and then worked with Woo again in Red Cliff 1&2. With that body of work behind him, he could come to the West on his own terms, finally headlining an MCU film no less when he turned up as the real Mandarin in Shang Chi & The Legend of the 10 Rings.\n\nEmpire once described Hard Boiled as “Infinitely more exciting than a dozen Die Hards.” Hyperbole maybe, but if ever a film was in that sphere, it is this one. You strap yourself in and take a ride through the bullet-ridden underbelly of Hong Kong in a way that has never been done before or since. If you have never watched a Hong Kong film, or you are a fan of action cinema, or you just want to see something that you have never seen on the screen, then be clear: you need to see this.\n\n* — not to be confused with another stalwart Hong Kong actor, Leung Ka Fei, who also confusingly chose the English name Tony. Even worse, they once appeared in the same film together, Eagle Shooting Heroes. Unfortunately it’s not very good."
