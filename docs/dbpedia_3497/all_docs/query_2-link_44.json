        "text": "Reviews of silent film releases on home video.\n\nCopyright Â© 1999-2024 by Carl Bennett\n\nand the Silent Era Company.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nRobin Hood\n\n(1922)\n\nWith the production of The Mark of Zorro (1920), Douglas Fairbanks had tripped upon the swashbuckling larger-than-life characterization that defined the remainder of his motion picture career. Between Zorro and his next historical swashbuckler, The Three Musketeers (1921), Fairbanks made one more of the âhabit of happinessâ comedies that were indicative of his early career, The Nut (1921). After The Three Musketeers, he never looked back.\n\nRobin Hood was Dougâs first $1 million-plus extravaganza. In those silent days, a big-budget film based on a public domain story could be undermined by a poverty row production company that would dash off a film based on the same story, give the film the same title and reach theaters before the major production could be completed. With the intent to thwart any such attempt to confuse audiences and cash in on his advance publicity, Fairbanks copyrighted and released his film under the title Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood.\n\nFrom New Yearâs Day 1922, the Fairbanks company kicked into high gear to produce the grandest spectacle the world had yet seen on film. The mammoth castle of King Richard and the Nothingham town sets required hundreds of carpenters and hundreds of thousands of dollars to complete, and they were authentic down to the smallest detail (as much so as Hollywood money could buy). Hundreds of extras had to be outfitted in historically accurate costumes. Months of shooting ensued. When the film was completed, the release prints made and the publicity paid for, Fairbanks had spent $1.4 million of his own money for Robin Hood. And it was a success. In the days when quarters bought you a movie theater ticket, Robin Hood made $2.5 million.\n\nDoes the film stand up under the weight of its historical story, its grand spectacle and its bloated budget? Of course it does, even for modern audiences. A film viewer today can readily understand why Fairbanks was a star. His energetic and enthusiastic performance still radiates from the screen today (that is, when the shy Earl of Huntingdon/Robin Hood isnât required to talk with ladies of the court). Fairbanks is an engaging Robin Hood, but I question why the roles of Sam de Grasse as Prince John and of Wallace Beery as King Richard werenât reversed. Perhaps for Beeryâs brutish strength as Richard and for de Grasseâs shifty-eyed and villainous John. Sam de Grasse would later serve as an ideal villain to Fairbanksâ hero in The Black Pirate (1926). In supporting roles Enid Bennett portrays a flaccid Maid Marion and Alan Hale Sr. a dedicated and sincere Little John.\n\nâ Carl Bennett\n\nThis Blu-ray Disc edition has been scanned from a 35mm fine-grain duplicate print at 4K high-definition and digitally cleaned for approximately 175 hours at 2K resolution. Presumably the source material originated in the Raymond Rohauer collection and is now held by the Cohen Media Group. The color-tinted image is significantly sharper and more detailed than has been available on home video. With dust, speckling and other print flaws removed, the remaining picture issue would be the subtle exposure fluctuations that are quite difficult to remove without compromising image quality. Overall, this release is a substantial visual improvement and a worthwhile upgrade for collectors.\n\nThe film is accompanied by a fine music score compiled by Rodney Sauer and performed by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, a small string and horn ensemble. The music is quite pleasing. It is a welcome relief that we can watch this film without being subjected to the annoying syncthesizer recording used for Kinoâs DVD editions.\n\nThe discâs supplementary material includes audio commentary for The Black Pirate by film historian Rudy Behlmer; The Black Pirate outtakes with commentary by Behlmer (18 minutes); and additional The Black Pirate outtakes (29 minutes). There is no supplemental material pertaining to Robin Hood.\n\nThis is the premiere of Robin Hood on Blu-ray Disc home video. The improved picture quality coupled with the new music score makes it quite easy for us to highly recommend this as the best available home video edition of the film.\n\nUSA: Click the logomark at right to purchase this Region A Blu-ray Disc edition from Amazon.com. Your purchase supports Silent Era.\n\nRobin Hood was considered a lost film in the 1950s but has, nonetheless, survived. From the condition of the print used for the DVD video transfer, we can deduce that the original negative and any original release prints have long since disappeared. However, the source print used (possibly a 16mm reduction print) is in very-good shape, with some dupe print film grain and print speckling noticeable in the final picture. This generally does not distract from the viewerâs enjoyment of the film.\n\nI do have a picky problem with the soundtrack for this home video edition. The original music score prepared in 1922 by Victor Schertzinger for the filmâs release has been presented here, performed in digital stereo by Eric Beheim on a MIDI-based synthesizer system. And while I know the limited economics of preparing a home video version of a commercially moderate retail product have made this a necessary budget decision, a small chamber orchestra would have made a much more pleasant recording and appropriate soundtrack. Yes, in an ideal world this could be done.\n\nOverall, Robin Hood remains an engaging and grand epic film and it is given a very-good presentation in this DVD home video edition that was replaced by the 2004 Kino edition noted above.\n\nThis Region 0 NTSC DVD edition has been discontinued\n\nand is . . ."
