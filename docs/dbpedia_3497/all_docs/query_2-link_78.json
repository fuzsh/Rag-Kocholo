        "text": "Musicals were a staple on the early talking screen, where photographed transcriptions of stage hits like No No Nanette! , The Desert Song, Rio Rita, Follow Thru and Whoopee were popular until audiences grew tired of their obvious artificiality. Lubitsch was one of the few silent directors to work successfully in the new form, beginning with this, his first sound film. Perhaps it helped that The Love Parade was an original musical written for the screen, but Lubitsch turned the convention of stage operetta on their head to create a intimate (his performers often spoke and sang directly to the camera), sophisticated style of musical comedy that contrasted both with the extravaganzas other directors were making at the time and the later, elaborately choreographed musicals of Busby Berkeley and Fred Astaire."
