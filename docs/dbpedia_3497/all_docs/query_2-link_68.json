        "text": "âTangerineâ was also used as background music in the 1984 movie Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. The Broadway show Dream, which honored Johnny Mercer, opened on April 3, 1997, and ran for 133 performances. The production featured âTangerineâ among the Mercer songs performed by a sixteen member cast that included Margaret Whiting, John Pizzarelli, and Lesley Ann Warren.\n\nIn Skylark: The Life and Times of Johnny Mercer, author Philip Furia quotes Mercer describing Schertzinger as âa doll to work with.â Schertzinger loved Mercerâs lyric to âTangerine.â Said Mercer, âI donât know why I called it âTangerine,â except that it had a kind of Latin flavor, the melody.â Furia points out that since South America was not involved in WWII, music of that genre offered escape from the conflict.\n\nThe lyric tells of a renowned Argentinean beauty: âTangerine, She is all they claim, With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame.â She dazzles men and women alike, âBut her heart belongs to just one, Her heart belongs to Tangerine.â"
