        "text": "It's lovely to find a gem like this, as sometimes I start to wonder if I've exhausted the '30s and '40s' supply of quality musicals.\n\nBing Crosby plays a composer who ghost-writes tunes for superficially charming songwriter Basil Rathbone. Due to some fun contrivances, he happens upon Rathbone's secret lyricist - Mary Martin - and the two fall in love. A clever premise, and when you learn that it came from Billy Wilder, that makes perfect sense.\n\nThe production is handsome - full of gleaming white sets - there are some fun cameos and in-jokes (like a lovably grouchy Oscar Levant slagging off his own book, and bits for Crosby cohorts John Scott Trotter and Ken Carpenter), while the story…\n\nVictor Schertzinger’s musical comedy about two ghost-writers whose tunes are attributed to a composer. Starring Bing Crosby, Mary Martin, Basil Rathbone, Oscar Levant and Oscar Shaw.\n\nThe story concerns Bob Sommers (Bing Crosby), a talented but unenterprising songwriter who makes his living writing songs for others. Cherry Lane (Mary Martin) is a wishful musician, and also one who ghost-writes.\n\nBoth occur to be employed for a composer (Basil Rathbone) who has a terrible case of writer's block. Neither Bob nor Cherry knows about each other, until they encounter by chance, love each other and start to team up in the optimism of making it in the music industry on their own.\n\nBing Corsby and Mary Martin both give good performances…\n\nNot exactly high energy, but that is one of the beauties of classic cinema: not everyone is running around with a megaphone all the time. Obviously made by people (Schertzinger, Wilder, Crosby, Martin) with lots of knowledge about and deep love for the popular music of the time. So much so that they realize that the mechanics of the cultural industry and personal expression are not stark opposites, but intricately interconnected. Alienation, after all, is both an objective condition in modern societies / under capitalism and something extremely personal. Great to see the act of performance treated so nuanced and carefully, too. Crosby and Martin might not exactly set the screen on fire, yet their gentle relationship is cleverly offset…\n\nAnother uninspired 1940 musical. This one shouldn't be so dull, given its well-chosen actors, a couple of good songs, and a story partly credited to Billy Wilder. Bing Crosby and Mary Martin realize that they are both ghostwriting music for defunct songwriter Basil Rathbone, who in reality has only written one hit. Rathbone is supposed to be an antagonist, but comes across as too tame, and you never buy him as a crooner maestro. There isn't much happening between Crosby and Martin either, as they butt heads in a thin attempt at conflict. The forward motion of the plotting has something cheap about it, as if we're only watching four people; Crosby and Rathbone gaze distantly, as if they are…\n\nAbsolutely charming film starring Bing Crosby and Mary Martin as ghostwriters whose songs are credited to a composer played by Basil Rathbone. Crosby is light on the hep-cat, but it's there along with a lot of humble charm. Mary Martin is the musical equal of Jean Arthur. Rathbone brings a light touch to his upper-crust cad. Oscar Levant steals the film.\n\nSteals it.\n\nI've seen him in a few films before. An accomplished piano player who never looks like he belongs on the big screen, Levant wildly improvises with great success. (You even see Bing crack up in a couple of shots.) He tosses out sidebars like Bob Hope (\"That guy would take a bow at his own funeral.\"), plays…"
