        "text": "The second book? It’s coming along. Slowly. I write slowly. Wait, that’s not quite right. I write fairly quickly – I just think of what to write slowly.\n\nI can tell you the title: Starcrossed. And I can tell you that it opens at a polo match. There was an era during Hollywood’s Golden Age when stars, studio heads and others in the movie industry were crazy for polo. There were something like 25 polo fields in the 1930s in the Los Angeles area. And my heroine, motion picture star Frankie Franklin, of course, plays.\n\nMost of the fields are long gone, but one survives at Will Rogers Historic State Park, once the private ranch of America’s “poet lariat.” We visited on our 2022 research trip, and with the beautifully preserved ranch house, the stable and the polo field, we found our imaginations effortlessly swept back to the time when Will himself lived there on the ranch in Pacific Palisades. He had it built in the 1920s, and he lived there until his death in a plane crash in Alaska in 1935. We have his widow, Betty, to thank for its continued existence. She donated the ranch to the California State Parks in 1944.\n\n2024 Deb McCaskey\n\nA visit to Will Rogers State Historic Park takes you back to the 1930s.\n\nIt was his refuge, where he could entertain guests, and ride, rope, and play polo. Preserved in the park are the ranch house, the stable, a riding arena, and a regulation polo field where the Will Rogers Polo Club still plays from April to October. Trails wind through the hills high above Sunset Boulevard and offer hikers views of the ocean.\n\nRogers was the highest-paid entertainer in the early 1930s, and was a popular newspaper columnist as well as a movie and radio star. His skill with a rope was legendary; the small visitor center in the garage of the guest cottage shows film clips of some of his feats, such as throwing three lassos at once and roping a horse and its rider.\n\nRogers’ humor was topical, but also timeless. Consider: “I’m not a member of any organized political party. I’m a Democrat.” And: “Everything is changing in America. People are taking their comedians seriously and the politicians as a joke.”\n\nThe Rogers place provided inspiration in the Stardusted world for the ranch of Clay West, the singing cowboy who is Frankie Franklin’s best friend. In particular, I loved that you can see the polo field from the ranch house, and that the beautiful stable was, as Frankie says, like a “horse palace.”\n\nAfter the tour we lingered and enjoyed the rolling lawns surrounding the house, where families with kids and dogs played.\n\nDown on the polo field, two women’s teams faced off. Not being there as a reporter, but just to absorb the atmosphere, I didn’t get the teams’ names or who won, or any of that. In my mind, I was already seeing Frankie and her friends, galloping hell-bent up and down the field after the little white ball.\n\nYou can still see polo played at Will Rogers State Historic Park.\n\n2024 Deb McCaskey\n\nI wanted to move right into the ranch house the minute I walked in the door. Comfortable, filled with light, unpretentious, it’s about as close to a dream house as I could imagine. There’s a stone patio with a fireplace, and a line of rocking chairs on the front porch, where you can almost hear Will say, “Come on out and set a spell.”\n\nThe ranch house, front porch and patio — inviting:\n\n2024 Deb McCaskey\n\n2024 Deb McCaskey\n\nYou can see the house’s interior on a guided tour; our guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Rogers’s life and times. We were the only folks on that particular tour, and, as tour guides sometimes do, when the questions we were asking made it clear how enthusiastic we were to learn more, he added extra time, and stories.\n\nOur guide seemed to have a particular interest in how much Rogers loved the”Good Old Oklahoma Beans” his sister served and the fact that Rogers described them as “kinder soupy.” It seemed to say to him, and to us, that no matter how much wealth and fame Will Rogers acquired, at heart he was still a down-to-earth Oklahoma cowboy.\n\nThe recipe for Good Old Oklahoma Bean — posted near the visitor center:\n\nIt was July 4 in Glendale, and Errol Flynn didn’t have a lot to say.\n\nNeither did Walt Disney or Jimmy Stewart or Clayton Moore, TV’s Lone Ranger. As for Humphrey Bogart and Sammy Davis, Jr., they were hiding behind locked doors.\n\nIn fact, it was downright quiet and peaceful all afternoon at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, as we drove about, stopping the rental car here and there to get out and admire the green lawns, trees, sculptures and views. And to look for the graves of stars, of course.\n\n2023 Deb McCaskey\n\nSome of the statuary at Forest Lawn Glendale — one of which is a copy of Michelangelo’s David.\n\nAt the more extroverted Hollywood Forever cemetery down on Santa Monica Boulevard, they had just observed the holiday on July 1 with fireworks and a screening of Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure. We had a family event to go to that evening, but even if we hadn’t, being in the midst of huge crowds of people – living people, anyway – is not our idea of a fun time.\n\nBut here in the quiet hills above Glendale on the Fourth, all was quiet as – well, as the grave. Lots of graves. So, very quiet. The crowds here are underground or in niches, and all the more congenial for that.\n\nWhen we visited there were just a few other live folks around, all nearly as well behaved as the permanent residents. We saw a couple sitting under some trees just off the road, and a small group with lawn chairs who appeared to be having a picnic – near a loved one’s final resting place, perhaps.\n\nGlendale is the flagship Forest Lawn location – there are six altogether in southern California – and is the one where you’re most likely to find people from the Hollywood of the 1930s, the era we like to research.\n\nForest Lawn opened in 1906 and was taken over in 1917 by a new manager with the idea that the traditional marble orchard was depressing and unsightly. None of that here. It’s all rolling green hills, trees, flowers, fountains, and statuary here and there – while the dead rest under discreet grave markers level with the lawn.\n\nAccording to the Smithsonian magazine, this is the place that set the standard for the modern cemetery – oops, sorry, memorial park. “Park” sounds so much less, you know, deathy.\n\nThere are several churches here including the famed Wee Kirk o’ the Heather, modeled on one dating from the 14th century in Scotland. Stained glass windows in the kirk illustrate the old Scottish song “Annie Laurie” – the lady for whom the composer “would lay me doon and dee.”\n\nAll so sad and romantic.\n\nPublic domain/Wikimedia Commons – Boston Public Library Tichnor Brothers collection\n\nThe Wee Kirk o’ the Heather\n\nForest Lawn has also been described as the Disneyland of cemeteries, though it predates Walt’s theme park and, the Smithsonian speculates, may have inspired the great animator himself. Much less animated now, he and some family members share a walled garden with a statue of the Little Mermaid. (I know: I was hoping it would be Mickey, too.)\n\nGetting a peek at the deathstyles of the rich and famous is not so easy here. There are no maps for sale, or organized tours, much less movie screenings and fireworks. No matter how wild and crazy folks might have been in life, they now live by Forest Lawn rules. Which I ended up thinking, you know, is fine. I’m not sure Elizabeth Taylor wants to hear from me anyway.\n\n(Hollywood Forever, by contrast, has the maps and tours, not to mention an entire building – a pavilion – devoted to Judy Garland. Her frequent co-star Mickey Rooney is also easy to find in his crypt. But my favorite one is Burt Reynolds. His monument is a larger-than-life bust in a cowboy hat. His expression makes it seem like he would appreciate having company.)\n\n2023 Deb McCaskey\n\nLeft, Burt Reynolds at Hollywood Forever. Right, Errol Flynn at Forest Lawn.\n\nI could see returning here next time we’re in the area. Open space and quiet are hard to find in any city, and here you have a really big, really green, really well-tended garden where it’s nice to spend part of a warm day in the Los Angeles area, where you can find a peaceful spot and meditate on the meaning of life and death and picnics.\n\nThere’s also a museum here, with some very nice sculptures and, when we visited, an exhibit on panoramas, the large-scale art format that was all the rage in the 18th and 19th centuries. If you have a thing for panoramas, get there soon. This exhibit, “Grand Views, the Immersive World of Panoramas,” is open through Sept. 10, 2023.\n\nA final thought: I’m not sure what one gets out of visiting graves anyway. It’s not like the folks themselves are actually, well, there. I mean, yes, if you dug them up and opened the coffin and looked in – okay, this is getting much too ghoulish.\n\nWhat I mean to say is, I’m sure people’s souls (if we have them, and in my more optimistic moments I like to believe we do) have better things to do than hang around a place like this. Life reviews, spying on those they left behind, looking up old pals who died owing them money …\n\nBut if there are any ghosts around here, I expect one would be that of Errol Flynn. Very near his grave is the statue of a nearly naked woman, so close that it gives the impression that the old rapscallion is spending eternity looking up her skirt.\n\n.\n\nDid you come here on purpose? If so, great! So who am I and what am I the author of?\n\nI’m Deb, and after retiring from a career spent mostly writing and editing for a newspaper and then a university, I decided to write fiction like I had always wanted to but didn’t, knowing it was not a practical way to make a living.\n\nSo here I am, the author of … one book, so far. You can read the first chapter, and, if you like it, you can find the whole thing as an e-book at Barnes & Noble, and also as an e-book or paperback at Amazon. And if you don’t like it, well, has there ever been anything or anyone everyone likes, with the possible exception of puppies or Dolly Parton?\n\nI write slowly, mostly to amuse myself — though my husband may argue with this notion after hearing all that swearing from behind my computer screen. He is my willing accomplice in researching the era, 1930s Hollywood, that we both find fascinating. It gives me an excuse to read about the likes of stars like Carole Lombard and David Niven, and directors like George Cukor and Howard Hawkes. And it gives us travel goals as we visit places like Forest Lawn Memorial Park, the Hollywood Museum, Will Rogers State Park and other remnants of the era that still exist in and around Tinsel City.\n\nAt this writing I am working on a second book featuring my heroine Frankie Franklin. No ETA yet but when there are updates, you’ll find them here.\n\nWe’re planning another research trip. It would probably be more productive to stay home and write more of the book, but we have to be in Southern California anyway for a cousin’s 50th wedding anniversary. So we’re taking a few more days to to search out more windows on the history of the region.\n\nThe Autry Museum of the American West. The first hugely famous singing cowboy in the pictures was Gene Autry, who starred in films and on TV from the ‘30s to the early ‘50s. His pictures ignited many a kid’s cowboy/cowgirl fantasies and had little to do with real ranch life or real history. And yet, the museum he founded in 1988 now is a multifaceted, inclusive showcase for the authentic art, history and cultures of the West.\n\nThe Japanese American National Museum. I think I owe it to my characters Kit Noguchi, and her father Mr. Noguchi, to understand as much as I can about the Japanese American experience, especially in Southern California. I expect a one-day visit here will only make me realize how much more there is to learn.\n\nThe Bradbury Building. You’ve seen it in tons of movies set in Los Angeles, most famously in the first Blade Runner. It’s ornate, mysterious, mazelike – just made for noirish chase scenes. It’s just an office building, not a museum, and we understand if you don’t make too big a deal of playing tourist, you can walk in and look around.\n\nOther places are on the list, too. We’re looking forward to some unstructured time as well, to go wherever our fancy and our rental car will take us.\n\nIt’s funny: so much of what we think we know about history, we’ve learned from the movies, for better or worse. But when you start reading and visiting and trying to learn more, you often find stories much more interesting and complicated than you expected. Certainly more nuanced than what can be crammed into a couple of hours of screen time.\n\nSo there’s that. And of course there’s also, always, the food. I spent about 16 years writing newspaper restaurant reviews in the San Francisco Bay Area. The experience gave me an appreciation for high-end meals and ever-so-artistic presentations, but you know what? My favorite restaurants are the kind where they serve honest, simple, easy-to-understand food, like the French dip at Philippe’s, pictured here.\n\nA brace of French dips ready for the customers at Philippe’s. A dill pickle, a lovely pink pickled egg, macaroni and potato salads round out the lunch. Tapioca for dessert, anyone?\n\nEven though we had dinner at Musso & Frank (to get a sense of history) and Pump (because it was within walking distance of our hotel), the French dip at Philippe’s was, hands down, my favorite meal of the trip.*\n\nBut wait – two places claim to have invented the French dip. (Though you have to ask, how hard could that have been? It’s sliced roasted meat, inside a French roll, and you dip it in the roasting juices. Doesn’t get much simpler than that.)\n\nNow we must, absolutely must, try the other place where this iconic sandwich might have first been served: Cole’s, which is more of a saloon, from what I can tell. Works for me. I want to go for the dip but also to admire the neon sign.\n\nThe trip is some weeks away, and I hope to spend at least some of that time finding out and writing down what Frankie and her friends have been up to, so I can eventually share it with you.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*Quick take on atmosphere. We actually enjoyed the vibe more at and around Philippe’s — the downscale, working-class neighborhood felt authentic and was far less grating on the nerves than the noise and partying on Hollywood Boulevard outside Musso’s door. As far as Pump goes — I loved the garden-room decor but the place was so loud we asked to be moved to a quieter table. We were moved, graciously. But it was still loud at the new table. I had steak with bearnaise at Musso and some kind of fish at Pump — neither were as memorable at the sandwich at Philippe’s.\n\nOK, to be totally honest, I didn’t know I appreciated Angela Lansbury until she died yesterday, at the age of 96.\n\nLike so many of her generation, my parents’ generation, she was just always … there. There would be plenty of time to catch her. She would always be in another TV show or movie. Just like our parents would be home when we decided to visit. They were always there. Until they weren’t.\n\nSometimes you miss them more, remembering them years after they pass, than you did right at the beginning. Maybe immediately afterward, the loss is too new to process, or they were in pain or kidnapped by dementia and it was a relief, or maybe the relationship was so complicated you don’t know how to feel for a long time.\n\nThat’s with close-by loved ones, anyway. With entertainers, if we liked them, there may be nothing but great memories. We’re sad to lose them, but really, when they’re approaching 100 … maybe it’s more the passing of the era they represented that we feel sad about.\n\nAnd she was around longer than many others, in a career that lasted seven decades. She is not one of those I’ve researched because she was actually too young to be part of the world in the stories (I swear there will be a second one, at least) I want to tell. Born in 1925, she was only about 10 at the time of Stardusted.\n\nWhen I think of Lansbury I first think of Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast – no one sang “Tale as Old As Time” better. I get teary every time I hear her slightly cracked, world-weary but beautiful voice singing it.\n\nIn NPR’s story , she hints why: “ ‘I’m not really a singer,’ she admitted. ‘I have a serviceable voice, but how I use it — it’s the emotion under the note that sells the song.’\n\nAnd boy, could she sell it. I never saw her in Mame, but I can only imagine she sold all those songs, too.\n\nI hadn’t remembered she was in Gaslight, as a maid, until I saw it recently. (Pretty heady stuff, being directed by George Cukor in your very first role! She earned an Oscar nomination for it, too.) And I can still hear her saying, “Chadwick, give mama some sugar” as Elvis Presley’s Southern belle mom in Blue Hawaii.\n\nLike a relative you like when you see them once in a while at a family gathering but don’t really think of the rest of the time, she always added value to the occasion. Always welcome, always charming–she was even evilly charming as the mother in The Manchurian Candidate.\n\nBut one role I never saw her in, not once, was that of Jessica Fletcher in Murder, She Wrote. Which is funny, I guess. If you’re trying to write mysteries, you might think you would want to watch shows about people who write them–even if they are far more prolific and successful than you are–for inspiration.\n\nBut I have not seen even one episode of Murder, She Wrote. When I’m trying to write my own stuff–with life getting in the way in a new way every single damn day–the last thing I want is to watch someone gaily, effortlessly doing the thing that I can’t seem to get done.\n\nNor do I want to unconsciously pick up and copy a scene, a plot twist, or dialogue from a show without realizing it.\n\nBut now that I think about other times I’ve been happy to see Lansbury, maybe–after I’ve gotten a first draft done and have put it away for the recommended few weeks before starting to edit–I’ll finally pay her a visit in Cabot Cove.\n\nIf you’ve visited this page recently, you might have taken a look at the date of the most recent posts (before this) and thought, hm, okay, dead website.\n\nAnd while it’s true that I don’t post terribly often, the reports of the site’s death (if anyone thought it worth reporting), would be greatly exaggerated.\n\nThere are reasons. Maybe you’ll find them boring, maybe not, but there are reasons.\n\nReason 1: Every time I’ve thought I should write a post for the page, the little editor inside me looks over her reading glasses at me and says, “Dear, if you’re going to write, shouldn’t it be writing the next book?” And since I always listen to editors–even imaginary, inside-my-head editors–I took that to heart. Trouble is, the writing has been … um … slow.\n\nReason 2: Lockdown. We had–have–a pandemic going on. You’d think the 2020 lockdown would give one tons of time to write. And it did. But I didn’t. Much. Otherwise I’d be telling you all about the next book, obviously. And now I guess the coronavirus and its variants are endemic, but still we’re all going out again and feel like there’s a lot of catching up to do. And that brings us to …\n\nReason 3: Life. Yeah, all that catching up to do. Anyone who needs to get work done that’s solitary–music, art, writing–has discovered the socializing and creating don’t mix so well.\n\nSo I’ve been catching up with friends, having lunches, even taking on a temporary, part-time, remote (gluten-free, low-fat, nondairy) job, mostly because an old colleague asked me to.\n\nAnd you know what nearly all those friends are asking? “When’s the next book coming out?”\n\nMy answer in my head is something like, “You tell me and we’ll both know.” Which would be pretty smartass of me.\n\nAll I can tell you is, it’s coming along. It has Frankie, of course, and Max, Clay and Sam, Mr. and Mrs. Monty, Mr. Noguchi and Kit Noguchi, Mr. Wiseman, and a few new characters. And, of course, Frankie’s self-satisfied Persian cat, Major Bowes, and her gallant Thoroughbred mare, Rocket. And I’m pretty sure this one will be called Starcrossed.\n\nI’ll say it’s coming out by the end of the year. But don’t hold me to that.\n\nMeanwhile, my loyal sidekick and husband, Ralph, and I did a quick research trip to visit some of Frankie’s haunts in Hollywood. Here are some pictures!\n\n“My home, way up in these hills, just off Beachwood Drive, felt worlds away from the strange community in which I worked …”\n\n“You don’t really want me to leave, do you?”\n\n“I’m pretty sure I do,” I said. “I’d like to be alone.”\n\n“After what happened?” he said. “I thought we could talk. You know, if you needed to.”\n\n“I’ll be fine.”\n\n“You’ve had a traumatic experience. People need to talk after traumatic experiences,” he said\n\nI didn’t think I needed to talk. But maybe I needed a distraction. I felt my resolve giving way.\n\nHe moved toward the cocktail bar and picked up a bottle of Campari. “Negroni?”\n\n“Thanks,” I said, resistance gone. “Well played, sir.”\n\nHe did make an excellent Negroni. And he had made it clear, he wasn’t going anywhere.\n\n— Stardusted, Chapter Four\n\nBack in the days when we could still get together with friends for drinks at a restaurant or bar (I am writing this while in quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic, and no one with common sense has gone anyplace crowded for months), I used to find myself dithering when the server asked what I would like. I’ll admit to letting it figure into my decision what the drink would say about me–how’s that for shallow? Why not just order something I liked?\n\nTrouble was, I didn’t really know what I liked in the way of cocktails. I didn’t come from a family that drank them–well, except for Aunt Adeline and Uncle Whitey, whose parties featured a constantly running blender turning out pale green Grasshoppers … unless it was Pink Squirrels. Not exactly classics; at least not since the ‘60s.\n\nMy mom didn’t drink and my dad liked beer until he discovered the Tom Collins –which, from the recipe I just now looked up, seems to be basically gin-spiked lemonade.\n\nAnyway, these memories did nothing to help when I was standing or sitting there and my friends were ordering glasses of white wine or gins-and-tonics or whatever. What did I want? What did I like?\n\nI needed, I figured, a signature cocktail. Like when you think of the gals on Sex and the City, you think Cosmopolitans (pardon me, but, ugh). Like when you think of James Bond you think of martinis, shaken not stirred (now we’re talking). Like when you think of Hunter S. Thompson you think of rivers of Wild Turkey (that might be going a bit far).\n\nMaybe 11 or 12 years ago, I decided to go about this logically. I remembered a friend who liked to drink Campari and sodas, and I remembered I also liked the rather bitter liqueur when he’d let me taste it. So I started looking up “cocktails with Campari.” And that’s how the Negroni entered my life.\n\nBitter and sweet, cold and bracing, it’s one of those cocktails that forces you to take it slowly, and savor it. And it’s so strong that unless you’re in total self-destruct mode, you know you can only have one of them, especially if there’ll be wine with dinner.\n\nWe bought Campari, we bought gin, we bought sweet vermouth. And my husband, ace amateur mixologist, whipped up a Negroni for me. Love at first sip. I had found my signature drink.\n\nUsually I’m behind the curve on trends but it turned out I was just slightly ahead of the Negroni curve. I would often ask for a Negroni at a restaurant only to find out they had no Campari.\n\nThat’s hardly a problem anymore. (The Daily Beast has an excellent story about the rise of the Negroni–and gets extra points for somehow working Patrick Stewart into the piece.)\n\nAnd when I decided my heroine Frankie Franklin needed a signature drink, too, it seemed only fitting we should share this one. Since it was invented before 1920, it was certainly something a sophisticated young star would know about–especially one whose cowboy father knew its inventor, the Florentine Count Camillo Negroni, who spent some time cowboying himself. (You can see why research is so captivating.)\n\nAnd of course Max, Frankie’s significant other, also makes a mean Negroni. Like this:\n\nTHE NEGRONI COCKTAIL\n\n1-¼ ounces Campari\n\n1-¼ ounces sweet vermouth\n\n1-¼ ounces gin\n\nCombine the Campari, vermouth and gin in a an old-fashioned or rocks glass, with ice. At this point you can either serve it right in that glass or strain it into another glass, stemmed or not, preferably chilled. Garnish with an orange twist. My husband, being an artist, sometimes peels a lemon, instead, in one continuous strip and fashions it into a rose-shaped garnish. (Yep, he’s a keeper.)\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, I had a brief discussion with a friend about silent movies and how he doesn’t enjoy them so much — not because you have to read on title cards whatever dialogue the actors are saying, but because the acting was so “stagey.”\n\nThat’s what I thought, too, for years. But recently I’ve seen a few silents that struck me for the subtle expressiveness many performers were able to get across on camera, performances in which actors knew they were not projecting to a theater balcony. If all you know of silents are slapstick chases and stunts, and you love films, there are some overlooked gems out there if you know where to look.\n\nOne of these for me was a 1929 feature, actually known as a transitional sound film, called Redskin. It was shot partially in Technicolor, and featured a synchronized score and sound effects.\n\nBy the title and the era it comes from, you might be expecting this to be a film full of racial stereotypes and other insensitivity. But you would be surprised. Redskin actually is a sympathetic and relatively nuanced tale of a young Navajo boy, a fast runner named Wingfoot, taken from his family and sent to an Indian boarding school. The cruelty and tragedy of this era comes through in a few deft scenes. Despite adversity, though, Wingfoot excels, and goes to college, where he encounters more racism, but excels again, only to find upon his return that he is no longer fits in with his traditional family.\n\nDirector Victor Schertzinger avoids the most glaring stereotypes in this picture. It would have been great if Native actors had been found for the lead roles, but that’s probably asking too much, considering the times. With Richard Dix in the role of Wingfoot, the film invites you to see these characters as people, remarkably complex, not cardboard heroes and villains. The scenes in the Navajo and Pueblo villages are particularly affecting, shot on location partially in Canyon de Chelly and Acoma Pueblo.\n\nWe discovered this picture on a DVD, Treasures II: Social Issues in American Film, 1900-1934, a feature-length film amid a collection of obscure short films from a variety of sources including businesses and advocacy groups, produced by the National Film Preservation Foundation. It’s worth seeking out. (We found it on Netflix.)\n\nA note on the director:\n\nSometimes it seems as though people long ago used to be able to stuff many more accomplishments into a life — even a short one — than we do now, despite all our technological toys.\n\nPennsylvania-born Victor Schertzinger was much more than the director of this one remarkable film. He directed 89 films, in fact, including two of the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby “Road” movies. But he was also a concert violinist and symphony conductor, and a pioneering film composer who won best musical score and sound recording Oscars in 1934 for One Night of Love.\n\nAnd if that’s not enough, he also composed two standards that you’ll hear today on jazz stations and in cabaret shows, I Remember You and Tangerine.\n\nSchertzinger died in 1941, at the age of 53."
