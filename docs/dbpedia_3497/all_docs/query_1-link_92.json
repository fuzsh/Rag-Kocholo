        "text": "Good morning, friends!\n\nYou may not know this but after college, I completed training as a doula in DC. Although I only attended one birth (the birth of my favorite living peanut person, my niece), I carried with me a great deference for the birthing body. Unfortunately, my training did not do its due diligence in regards to education on maternal mortality or the racial disparities therein. Since then, I have learned a lot about the reality of being a Black, Brown, and Indigenous birthing person in this country and the reality is despicable.\n\n7/28 FUND RACIAL JUSTICE/ACTION ITEM:\n\nThis week, please read this open letter demanding a change in the treatment of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people and then scroll down to sign your name.\n\nTaking it one VERY SIMPLE (one click) step further, you can use this page to email your representatives about the Black Maternal Health Momnibus as outlined in the above open letter. This is real, impactful legislation at stake.\n\nIf you would like to donate somewhere to support this cause, one place to donate is BMMA (Black Mamas Matter Alliance). They have a diverse mission, including changing policy, developing research, and advancing care for Black birthing people.\n\n7/28 MOVIE BY A BLACK FILMMAKER REC:\n\nI was not able to watch a new movie by a Black filmmaker this week, so I’m going to recommend one I’ve already seen and you probably have, too. But if you haven’t! You must, must watch Get Out by Jordan Peele. It’s a horror movie, yes, but it’s also funny and smart and extremely thoughtful with super dynamic acting. Available on YouTube, Amazon, and iTunes.\n\n# 9: Hard Boiled\n\nDirector: John Woo\n\nHong Kong\n\nYear: 1992\n\nRuntime: 126 minutes\n\nLanguage: Chinese\n\n**As always, this post contains spoilers**\n\nHoo boy, y’all. Hold on to your BUTTS. Although directed by John Woo, set in Hong Kong, filmed only 3 years later, and with a cop-centric plot, Hard Boiled somehow rips exponentially harder than The Killer and I can’t wait to tell you all about it.\n\nFirst: it begins with a clarinet. How many action films open with a clarinet? My money is on one. There’s also a guy playing drums with those backscratcher-looking things. Do people still use those?\n\nWe find ourselves in a tea house in Hong Kong. Except in this tea house, there are song birds in cages all over the place. People bring in their own caged birds and there are cages hanging from the ceilings. I looked this up because I was SO confused and are you ready for this…apparently it used to be common for folks to bring in their pet birds to tea houses so they could socialize with other birds. Gawwwwddddddd.\n\nOur good buddy, Chow Yun-fat (the lead in last week’s The Killer), playing an undercover cop named Tequila this time, is dining with some dudes when a group of other dudes shows up looking suspicious. Turns OUT these other dudes are part of a Hong Kong Triad, which is basically like the Chinese mafia, and they are trying to make a gun smuggling deal by hiding weapons in their bird cage. I think you know where this is going…SHOOT OUT. So many people die in the first 15 minutes of this movie. So many. Also, Tequila shoots a gun while sliding down a bannister and chewing on a toothpick. I hope this GIF works:\n\nAt one point Josh said, “Oh no, an Uzi!” This is when I recalled that watching action movies with Josh is the most fun because baby loves action.\n\nTurns out the police had a guy on the inside of this Triad and Tequila killed him. WHOOPSY DAISY. (‘member when he accidentally shot Jennie’s eyes out in The Killer? #problematic #ACAB #seriously) This gets him kicked off the gun smuggling case. The plot is gonna get squirrely so let me just say the basic premise of the film is the cops vs. the Triad.\n\nSaxophone music plays. Josh says, “Damn, that’s funky.”\n\nIn a library, a Triad assassin named Alan murders a guy in a library for crossing Alan’s boss, Hoi. ALAN IS A VERY IMPORTANT CHARACTER. REMEMBER HIM. Another rival Triad leader, Johnny Wong, is impressed with Alan and recruits him for his team (is that the word?). Tequila investigates the murder while eating a sandwich (hate that) and discovers Alan hid the murder weapon in a book.\n\nJosh said, “Damn, that’s good detective work.”\n\nCut to the police precinct. Tequila and another police officer, Teresa, are dating but seem to hate each other? She is receiving flowers from another man, which actually turns out to be flowers from an undercover cop they have on the inside of the Triad!!! He sends them coded messages in the note cards and they decode them using that computer move from the 80s/90s/00s where you just type a bunch of shit on the keyboard and stuff happens.\n\nLater that day, Tequila is fishing at a port in a suit. At one point he catches a fish, BLOWS IN ITS MOUTH, and throws it back in. Something happened here with another guy in a suit but I was so distracted by this fish thing that I don’t know what happened. Also, I’m still waiting on the baby from the poster to show up.\n\nAt this point Josh said, “Something’s about to happen!”\n\nAlan (mobster), Johnny Wong (his new boss), and a bunch of their guys raid Hoi’s (Alan’s ex-boss) gun arsenal warehouse. There is LOTS OF FIRE AND SHOOTING. A motorcycle runs into an open truck taking out a dude head-on.\n\nJosh said, “Ohhhhh bitchin’!”\n\nAt one point, one of the Triad members lights a cigarette off of a burning car he’s leaning next to just by leaning a little bit further.\n\nJosh said, “This movie is COOL.” Josh is correct.\n\nTequila is at the warehouse, of course, because he can’t leave it alone even though he was told he’s off the gun smuggling case. When Hoi (Alan’s ex-boss) shows up, Alan kills him and all of Hoi’s men with no hesitation. THEN it rains down tear gas and Tequila propels down from the ceiling like NSYNC in their No Strings Attached tour (which I know because I was there, sweetie) except he’s shooting an automatic weapon.\n\nThere is so much shooting, so many explosions, so many men just throwing themselves through the air. Alan (mobster) and Tequila find themselves face to face with guns drawn and although Tequila fires, his gun doesn’t go off and Alan decides not to shoot him. Awkwaaaarrddd.\n\nThat night, Alan takes his houseboat for a spin where he screams on the deck for awhile. Meanwhile, Tequila asks his boss (probably a Sergeant or something) who Alan is because he suspects he’s an undercover copperoni. And the boss, being very cool and not suspicious, basically says “nunya” and Tequila’s like okay well I’m gonna kill him next time I see him and his boss is like you better not and Tequila’s like watch me.\n\nTurns OUT Alan is an undercover cop. Ope!\n\nThere are a couple more shootouts between Alan, Tequila, and Triad dudes. Tequila and Alan have a couple of heart to hearts in the middle of them about how Alan is tired of living a double life. Eventually, we are in a hospital, where I am very certain we are going to meet the baby from the poster ANY MINUTE.\n\nThere is a morgue shoot out, there is a secret room in a morgue shoot out, there is an electrocution, and sooooo many hidden guns. Apparently under the hospital is where the smugglers kept all of their guns! There are hostages and SWAT teams. In fact, Johnny says, “I’ve got more hostages than I’ve had hot dinners,” which is honestly a very weird thing to say. Eventually the entire hospital, which is partially on fire and basically a war zone, is locked down by Johnny. Teresa (Tequila’s girlfriend who he hates) shows up, where she helps evacuate all the babiiiieeeesssss. Tequila arrives to help her, where they put cotton in the babies ears to drown out the noise. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a baby with cotton in their ears, but I had never, and it is—hooooo boy it’s fucking cute.\n\nJosh said, “this hospital has been rocked,” and then asked, “Do you think Carol was born in a hospital?” Carol is our cat who was born in a hoarder’s backyard probably under an overturned rotting lawn chair.\n\nAlright, it’s baby time. It’s also time for one of the most WILD scenes I’ve ever seen on film. Tequila scoops up one of the babies, kills a bunch of dudes while holding it, wipes blood off of it, says “Excuse me” and kisses it a bunch to try to make it smile.\n\nHe realizes after a giant explosion that they are trapped in a burning building. So he wraps the baby up under his jacket and runs through fire so that his legs are literally on fire. The baby pees, putting out the fire on Tequila’s legs. Okay. Tequila, holding on to a bunch of electrical wires in one hand and the baby still in the other, jumps out of a window, using the wires as swinging ropes as the window explodes behind him and lands, handing the baby off to someone else not holding a bunch of electrical cords. OKAY.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnny Wong (Alan’s most recent Triad boss) is holding Alan (the undercover cop) hostage. Alan takes Johnny’s gun and shoots himself in the stomach. Tequila shoots Johnny through the eye. They both die.\n\nThe last scene is of Tequila destroying Alan’s file.\n\nI was truly startled by the number of people who seemed to have died in this film, so I looked it up! Turns out Hard Boiled has the 8th highest body count of any film ever with 307 deaths, which it TIED with you’ll never guess…Titanic! Coulda been one less if Rose…you know.\n\nLike most action movies, I’m learning, this movie didn’t really stick with me, but I was very entertained and impressed with the fight choreography. It takes a lot of talent to make chaos legible. I also like how the two John Woo films I’ve seen so far have challenged this idea of the “good guy/bad guy” binary. Don’t think we don’t notice these cops having a lot in common with these assassins, Woo! Do you think John Woo hates cops? But ultimately, my favorite part was how fun it is to watch action movies with Josh.\n\nWe are now into double digits, bbs! Next up is # 10, Walkabout, which is our first Australian film, and one I know absolutely nothing about. See you there!\n\nXOXO,\n\nSteph"
