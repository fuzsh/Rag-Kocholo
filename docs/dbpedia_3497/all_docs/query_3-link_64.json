        "text": "Nearly two years ago, we learned that action demigod John Woo (Hard Boiled, Face/Off) had teamed with Peacock for an English-language remake of his 1989 masterpiece, The Killer. Today, the NBCUniversal platform debuted a trio of deadly images from the upcoming movie which co-stars Nathalie Emmanuel (The Fast Saga, Game of Thrones), Omar Sy (Jurassic World), Sam Worthington (Avatar), Diana Silvers (Space Force), Eric Cantona (The Fragile Colossus), Tchéky Karyo (Le Femme Nikita), and Grégory Montel (Transatlantic).\n\nEmmanuel leads the story as Zee, a feared contract killer known as \"the Queen of the Dead\" in Paris' criminal underworld. When she refuses to murder a young blind woman (Silvers) on the orders of her handler Finn (Worthington), Zee finds herself hunted by old colleagues and a determined detective named Sy (played by a guy named Sy, fittingly enough).\n\n\"Her dilemma in this movie is that she's being asked to kill somebody who she doesn't believe deserves it,\" Emmanuel explained during an interview with IGN. \"And for some reason she can't believe that they deserve to be killed.\"\n\nRELATED: The Killer: John Woo Remake at Peacock Targets Jurassic World Star Omar Sy\n\nJoining the movie was a no-brainer for Sy, who's been a Woo die-hard for years. \"[He] changed everything with the action movie, all the slow motion, all those new ways to picture the action,\" the actor explained. \"But also, if you look closely with his movies, he’s a romantic guy. There are a lot small looks, chemistry between actors. It’s a lot about love, friendship, loyalty.\"\n\nGet Your First Look at John Woo's Peacock Remake of The Killer\n\nHow to Watch Jon Woo's Remake of The Killer\n\nCo-written by Matthew Stuecken, Josh Campbell, and Brian Helgeland, The Killer arrives on Peacock Friday, August 23. The film bears no relation to the David Fincher project of the same name.\n\nRELATED: John Woo's Hard Target Remains a Wild Ride 30 Years Later"
