        "text": "If one were of a sarcastic bent (who, me?) one might summarise BIRTH OF THE BLUES (1941) as a film about how Bing Crosby, Mary Martin and (gasp) Brian Quatermass McGinty Donlevy invented the blues. In fact, the itself movie is fairly clear that blues music already existed when Bing’s fictional character and his fictional gang appropriated it (to use a polite word) from Black musicians and audiences. Their motivation in doing so is depicted as wholesome — this music is awesome, but white folks don’t appreciate it and so they’re missing out, and so we need to form the first ALL-WHITE BLUES BAND to popularize this marvelous stuff.\n\nOf course the film is called BIRTH OF THE BLUES and not THEFT OF THE BLUES or POPULARISATION WITH WHITE FOLKS OF THE BLUES, so the implication is that the blues only existed in some kind of legally unrecognized pre-natal condition before Bing’s dexterous midwifery brought it purple-faced and sticky to the pallid masses.\n\nThe movie also chooses to embody its Black characters with such personages as Eddie “Rochester” Anderson and Mantan Moreland, who each has his own inescapably caricatured performance style. And while Eddie is still a somewhat agreeable presence, Moreland qualifies as one of those few actors whose very presence seems to make a film racist.\n\nThis might be survivable, but the film also makes frequent use of the D-word — I guess I have to use the word to make clear my meaning, the word “darkies.” When characters dismiss the music Bing loves as “d—ie music”, we assume they’re prejudiced and the movie doesn’t approve. But then Donlevy, an aficionado, also uses the term, and it seems like that’s just a term we’re all comfortable with, this is the South after all, yes sirree.\n\nThe film is nicely mounted and director Victor Schertzinger, not known as either a visual stylist or a bluesman, does serve up one nice visual surprise. As Bing gets the band a gig in a silent movie house, the slides projected on the big screen are full three-strip Technicolor in an otherwise appropriately b&w world. And I must have been tired because it took a couple of slides for me to even process this. “Would the slides in a movie house be colour? … Sure, I’ve seen examples of those slides, they WERE colour…. Hang on, this is a monochrome movie!”\n\nOne more thing — I recall discussing with a friend the way classical Hollywood movies, when they try to imagine modern classical music, tended to serve up pastiche Gershwin, particularly his Rhapsody in Blue, and when they try to imagine modern art, they go for pastiche Dali. We speculated on how sickly-sweet and overpowering those flavours would be together. Well, this is the movie that finally combines them, in its opening and closing credits:\n\nBIRTH OF THE BLUES stars Father Chuck O’Malley; Peter Pan; Quatermass McGinty; Europena Wiggs; Little Joe Jackson; Cahusac; Twister McGurk; Burglary Instructor (scenes deleted); Dolly; One of the Rhythm Boys; Buck Ware; The Trombenick; Big Bertha; Big Frank; Prof. Thurgood Elson; Bunsy Wellman; Orchestra Leader (uncredited); Pie Eye (uncredited); Wild Man Moore; Trombone Player in Band (uncredited); Hammacher’s Band Member (uncredited); Professor Magenbruch; Producer at Callahan’s Drive-In (uncredited); Soapy Jones; Labor; Barkilphedro; Max Jacobs; Gordon Cole; Man at Xanadu Great Hall (uncredited); Birmingham Brown; Pork – House Servant; Prof Potelle; Robert T. MacChesney (uncredited); and Spats’ Henchman.\n\nIt was rainy last Sunday so I suggested we have our own film festival at home. Try it!\n\nAn eclectic program, decided at random. First I watched THE ORE RAIDERS, and blogged about it, then I popped on THE BLACK WINDMILL (1974), which always looked like awful tommyrot when on TV, but it’s Don Siegel therefore worth a try. Reader, THE BLACK WINDMILL is indeed awful tommyrot, but with impressive credits. TV pan-and-scan showings, which I recall seeing bits of, ruined it utterly — the pleasure is all in Siegel’s framing and blocking. Ousama Rawi, the former Mr. Rita Tushingham, shot it, beautifully — there’s some particularly nice anamorphic city lights. Antony Gibbs, of PETULIA and PERFORMANCE, cut it, less successfully than one might have hoped, though the neatest bit is a long take from a locked-off position as bad guys frame the hero with a nudie photo staged in his own bedroom. Roy Budd, of GET CARTER, provides a GET CARTER type score, with added tabla drums. Veteran costume designer Anthony Mendleson makes his leading man look ridiculous. I think there’s a good argument for leading men dressing conservatively, as Cary Grant suggested. They don’t date, and anyway, why would a spy dress like THIS? I suppose, in a crisis, he could always turn sideways and hide behind his necktie.\n\nA distinguished cast includes cast includes Harry Palmer, Dr. Crippen, Empress Alexandra, Elizabeth Bathory, Sheik Abu Tahir and Maya the shapeshifter from Space 1999.\n\nFiona only joined that one midway, then insisted on some Bette Davis so we ran JEZEBEL, which we hadn’t seen in ages. I’ve often felt that the Germans in Hollywood had more racial sensitivity than native-born filmmakers, but although the black characters here all get bits of characterisation, and Eddie Anderson underplays for once, the movie never misses a chance at a cheap joke. When Henry Fonda says he feels haunted, wrinkled retainer Lew Paton stammers, “H-haunted?” in terror of spooks.\n\nStill, the soapy story compels, and Bette is playing a perverse, willful, stroppy filly much like herself. She adored Wyler’s disciplinarian approach, and dialled down her excesses. When she reacts to the news that Fonda has married, her face registers a dozen emotions and calculations at lightning speed, subtly enough that you can believe smiling Margaret Lindsay doesn’t notice them, and visibly enough that you can see Fonda does.\n\nAlso great work from Richard Cromwell and, shockingly, George Brent, whose sleepy approach to acting here becomes electrifying when he’s given something of real interest to play. His character is supposed to be a dynamic old-school swashbuckler, and by playing it with indifference he actually adds a convincing edge to it. This guy is so dangerous because he doesn’t advertise it.\n\nThe cunning use of POV shots I noted in THE ORE RAIDERS is present here, as Bette, embracing Fonda, makes particular note of the stick he’s left by the door. All her behaviour in the ensuing scene is an attempt to provoke him into using it on her, which he refrains from, much to her disappointment. Did I mention Bette’s character is a touch perverse?\n\nCo-writer John Huston was drafted in to direct a duel scene, and in a film full of smart grace notes, delivers one of the neatest, as the duellists take ten paces, clear out of frame and two puffs of smoke issue in from the edges of the screen, rendering the battle an abstraction, its outcome a mystery.\n\nWe followed this with another, contrasting Bette movie, LO SCOPONE SCIENTIFICO (1972), which I’ve tackled at greater length elsewhere. Let’s just say that, cast as a kind of monster-goddess, Bette again is playing a character remarkably like herself: indefatigable.\n\nShort subject: PIE, PIE, BLACKBIRD with Nina Mae McKinney and the Nicholas Brothers when they were small. She does an adorable rasping trumpet honk thing with her voice, an orchestra plays inside a giant pie, and the Bros. dance so hard, everybody turns into a skeleton. Will, if anybody was going to cause that to happen, it would be them.\n\nIt’s very funny to me that the props man couldn’t find a child skeleton — there was, it would seem, little call for such items — so he’s removed the shin-bones of an adult to make it dance shorter. Incredible to think that young Harold performed all those moves without knees.\n\nThen MIRAGE, based on regular Shadowplayer Daniel’s recent recommendation. Sixties Edward Dmytryk, when he’s supposed to be washed up, but there’s some interesting stuff afoot, not all of it pulling in the same direction, but still. Stars Atticus Finch, Felix Unger Oscar Madison, Anne Frank’s sister Margot, Willie Loman’s son Biff, Gaetano Proclo and Joe Patroni. Which is to say, Walter Matthau and George Kennedy are reunited after CHARADE, which was also scripted by Peter Stone, and Matthau and Jack Weston are together, prefiguring A NEW LEAF.\n\nStone’s script is witty as usual, perhaps too witty — there’s a good sense of Kafkaesque nightmare going on in the crazy amnesia/conspiracy plot, but you have Gregory Peck being all Gregory Peckory, stiff and bashful, and then making quips, and the sense of waking nightmare rather deserts one.\n\nBUT —\n\nDmytryk, a former editor, has discovered direct cutting — he’s seen MARIENBAD, in fact — or maybe the previous year’s THE PAWNBROKER. As Peck thinks back on baffling recent events, or retrieves fragments of memory from his earlier, lost-time spell, we cut in hard to snippets of dialogue from earlier or brief flashes of action. Best of all is a subway scene where the sound of the train continues unabated over glimpses of Walter Abel falling out of a skyscraper. Then he cuts to a watermelon hitting the ground and bursting, something that’s only been mentioned earlier. It’s a non-diegetic watermelon, perhaps the first of its race.\n\nIt’s dazzling and disturbing and would still look pretty nifty in a modern film. What makes it sellable to the great public of 1964 is that the odd technique is tied directly to the plot gimmick. Anyway, it’s very nice indeed, and makes you realise how conservative most cutting still is. Given Dmytryk’s late-career wallowing in turgid airport novel stuff, I wish he’d enlivened his work with this kind of monkey business a lot more. For a guy who’d sold out, who had to shore up his sense of self-worth with spurious justifications, accomplishing a nice piece of work like this must have been some kind of relief."
