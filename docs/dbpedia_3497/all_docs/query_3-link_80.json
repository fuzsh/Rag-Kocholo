        "text": "A landmark in film history, John Woo's Hard Boiled is \"nirvana for seekers of action\" (Marc Savlov, Austin Chronicle). Chow Yun-Fat (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) stars as Tequila, a cop hell-bent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partner's death. He teams up with an undercover cop (Tony Leung, Internal Affairs) whose secret identity as a Triad hitman hangs by a thread. The film raises gunfights to an art form, with some of the most celebrated action sequences ever, including a close-quarters teahouse shootout and a monumental firefight through the halls of a packed hospital. Simply put, Hard Boiled is \"one of the best action films of all time\" (James Rocchi, Netflix).\n\nWelcome to CriterionForum.org, one of the premier destinations on the web to discuss DVD releases from The Criterion Collection, Masters of Cinema, and other DVD production companies from around the world.
