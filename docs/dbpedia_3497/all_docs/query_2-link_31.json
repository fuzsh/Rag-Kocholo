        "text": "You’d expect 1939 classics like “The Wizard of Oz” and “Gone With the Wind,” which have been throwing off millions in revenues for decades, to look still great because they’re such cash cows for the owners. It’s a real surprise, though, to find a far-less-remembered Technicolor production from that fabled year looking positively spectacular in its Blu-ray debut next week from the Criterion Collection.\n\nVictor Schertzinger’s “The Mikado” was an Anglo-American production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s most popular operetta, filmed in England under the close supervision of the D’Oyly Carte company, which fanatically enforced its copyrights to ensure that stage production in the U.K. faithfully followed the originals — even half a century after they were introduced in the Victorian era.\n\nThe Savoyards did allow abridgements, including dropping several songs, to achieve a 91-minute running time for the film. The main concession to American tastes was the casting of Kenny Baker, a tenor best known as a sidekick on Jack Benny’s radio show (he eventually left and was replaced by Dennis Day) in the central role of Nanki-poo, a son of the Mikado (emperor) of Japan who disguises himself as a wandering mistrel to escape an arranged marriage to an older woman.\n\nNot to be confused with the little person with the same name who acted inside R2D2 in the original “Star Wars” trilogy, this Baker had the title role in Warners’ 1937 flop “Mr. Todd Takes the Air” but generally appeared lower on the cast list, a pleasant presence in films like “The Goldwyn Follies” (1938, introducing George Gershwin’s “Love Walked In” and reprising it several times), “52nd Street,” “Radio City Revels” and “The Harvey Girls.” The same year as “The Mikado,” Baker replaced Allan Jones as the juvenile in the Marx Brothers’ “At the Circus.”\n\nSchertzinger, too, was an American — and a composer of some note — whose directorial credits stretched back to 1917. He would go on to direct the first two Bob Hope-Bing Crosby “Road” movies before his death in 1941, shortly after completing “The Fleet’s In,” which contained four hit songs Schertzinger composed with lyricist Johnny Mercer.\n\nIn a video essay on “The Mikado,” director Mike Leigh reveals that the producers tried to entice Deanna Durbin to play Nanki-Poo’s love interest Yum-Yum in “The Mikado,” which was released in the U.S. by the singing superstar’s home studio, Universal Pictures (then partly owned by British movie magnate J. Arthur Rank, who bankrolled the picture). That intriguing possibility never happened and the part was played instead by a Brit, the charming Jean Colin.\n\nThe rest of the cast is entirely British. The film is dominated by a pair of D’Oyly Carte veterans — Martyn Green as Ko-Ko and Sydney Granville as Pooh-Bah — who show off comic chops honed from decades on the Savoy stage. Schertzinger is extremely respectful of the material.\n\nIf “The Mikado” seems at times less like a movie musical than a filmed stage play at times, it’s a very well staged and thoughtfully staged production with gorgeous sets and costumes that Hollywood veteran Harry Stradling has sumptuously photographed in lush three-strip Technicolor that looks remarkably vibrant for a movie more than seven decades old. Just don’t expect it to look as razor-sharp as Warners’ Blu-rays of “Oz” and “Wind,” which employed computer technology to achieve a degree of color registration that was impossible back in 1939, when Techicolor films typically had softer images than their black-and-white counterparts (the color palette of British Technicolor films is also a tad less aggressive than its Hollywood counterpart).\n\n“The Mikado” did well enough in the U.S. that it was re-released by Universal in 1948 and made its debut in prime time on ABC in 1956. U.S. rights have been controlled for many decades by Janus Films, parent company of the Criterion Collection, which licensed a bare-bones DVD release to Criterion’s distributor, Image Entertainment in 1998.\n\nBesides the interview with an enthusiastic Leigh, extras on the new Blu-ray include a deleted number, Ko Ko’s “I’ve Got a Little List,” featuring a shot of an actor made up as Hitler and a pointed reference to Britain’s appeasing prime minister, Neville Chamberlain. There are also archival radio recordings of numbers from a pair of 1939 Broadway productions that took advantage of the lapsed U.S. copyright for “The Mikado” for swing versions — “The Hot Mikado” with Bill “Bojangles” Robinson and “The Swing Mikado.”\n\n“The Mikado” is being released next Tuesday by Criterion simultaneously with the Blu-ray debut of Leigh’s splendid “Topsy Turvy,” his undeservedly forgotten and delightful 1999 masterpiece about the original production. It won best picture honors from the New York Film Critics Circle, no mean feat in a remarkable year that included “American Beauty,” “The Matrix,” “The Insider,” “Fight Club,” “Three Kings,” “Magnolia,” “Being John Malkovich,” “Boys Don’t Cry” and many other topnotch films as the century closed,\n\nLeigh veterans Jim Broadbent and Alan Corduner are terrific as, respectively, the repressed lyricist William S. Gilbert and hedonistic, drug-taking composer Arthur Sullivan, whose highly successful partnership is on the verge of breaking up when Sullivan’s wife (Leslie Manville, recently Oscar-nominated for Leigh’s “Another Year”) drags him to a Japanese exhibition that inspires him to collaborate on the satirical “The Mikado” instead of “serious” music.\n\nBest known for more spartan contemporary social dramas, Leigh does some of his most inspired work with this colorful backstage drama of artists at work. There’s a vast amount of period detail captured by Leigh’s longtime cinematographer Dick Pope, faithfully rendered in Criterion’s Blu-ray. The excellent cast includes Shirley Henderson and Timothy Spall, both of whom do their own singing along with everybody else (Corduner, besides being a superb actor, is an accomplished pianist).\n\nBesides a commentary track by Leigh and a featurette ported over from Universal’s DVD release of a decade ago, there’s a newly-filmed conversation between Leigh and musical director Gary Yershon; a 26-minute short film by Leigh from 1992 starring Broadbent; and four deleted scenes. Jolly good show.\n\nToday’s Warner Archive Collection releases are super-obscurities, including a couple from the UK: Kevin Billington’s “The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer” (1970) a political satire with Peter Cook, Harold Pinter. John Cleese and Graham Chapman; and Michael Apted’s heist thriller “The Squeeze” (1977) starring Stacy Keach and David Hemmings. Next week will bring Henry Koster’s “The Unfininshed Dance” (1947), a forgotten predcessor of “Black Swan” starring Margaret O’Brien and Cyd Charisse (more on that later). The WAC website is taking pre-orders for the long-awaited May 10 release of Leslie H. Martinson’s “P.T. 109” (1963) starring Cliff Robertson as John F. Kennedy during World War II. Already available as a WAC exclusive at the Critics Choice Video website is another bio-pic, Richard Thorpe’s “The Great Caruso” (1951) with Mario Lanza and Ann Blyth.\n\nOver on TCM’s website (aka Movies Unlimited), they’re taking pre-orders for the planned May 2 release of a “Pre-Code Double Feature” comprised of Rouben Mamoulian’s “The Song of Songs” (1933) starring Marlene Dietrich, Brian Aherne and Lionel Atwill, and Cary Grant’s feature debut, Frank Tuttle’s “This is the Night” (1932) starring Lila Damita, Thelma Todd, Roland Young and Charlie Ruggles. TCM’s ongoing “Vault Collection” partnership with Universal — which started out as a MOD program like WAC but has morphed into pressed discs for most recent releases — will also yield the scheduled June 6 release of an “Audie Murphy Westerns Collections” comprised of four U-I programmers: “Sierra” (1950), “Ride Clear of Diablo” (1954), “Drums Across the River” (1954) and “Ride a Crooked Trail” (1958).\n\nUpcoming Blu-ray upgrades of classics include 50th anniversary editions of Michael Curtiz’ “The Commancheros” and Robert Rossen’s “The Hustler” (both Fox, May 17), Sergio Leone’s “Once Upon a Time in the West” (Paramount, May 31), Robert Aldrich’s “Kiss Me Deadly” (Criterion, June 21), Robert Siodmak and Edgar G. Ulmer’s “People on Sunday” (Criterion, June 28) and the 15-disc “The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy: Extended Edition” (Warner, June 28)."
