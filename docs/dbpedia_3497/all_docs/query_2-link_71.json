Otherwise music and poetry by Charlie Mingus, Lonnie Hillyer, Walter Bishop, John Gilmore, Dannie Richmond and Charles McPherson.

Pennebaker\n\nImprovised impression of Dr. Timothy Leary's marriage, in which Charlie Mingus appears briefly playing piano.\n\nI've mostly quoted Meeker directly changing some of the punctuation. I hope this helps fill out the \"Filmography\" portion of the Mingus Page. I'm sure there are many more items to be found. I can recall an \"Ed Sullivan Show\" in the late sixties or early seventies on which Mingus, Archie Shepp, Roland Kirk, Roy Haynes and others appeared for one number.\n\ndw\n\nUnauthorized Videos\n\nLive In Norway, 1964\n\n(P) + (C) 1990 Green Line SRL\n\nJazz & Jazz Video Collection VIDJAZZ 15\n\nSo Long Eric (22:20)\n\nOrange Was The Color Of Her Dress (15:10)\n\nOw!
