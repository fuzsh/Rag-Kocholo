Victor Schertzinger, Photolithograph & Art.

Victor Schertzinger (1890-1941), director and composer. Some of his many films include: Scandalous Tongues (1922), A Boy of Flanders (1924), Thunder Mountain (1925), The Return of Peter Grimm (1926), Siberia (1926), The Lily (1926), Paramount on Parade (1930), Something to Sing About (1937), One Night of Love (1934), and Road to Singapore (1940).

This is an exceptionally rare hand tipped-in, photolithographic print of Victor Schertzinger from an exclusive Fox Films / Fox Studios collection dating to the Silent Film era. This photolithograph is exceptional in its quality, contrast, and production and is set against a custom illustrated background created directly from the artist's canvas. There were so few of these produced that this would make the ultimate gift for the Fox Studio or Victor Schertzinger collector.

Period Paper has obtained several exclusive collections of rare silent film memorabilia over the last year but few have compared to this collection. If you are a Fox Film Corporation, Fox Studios, or Fox News Collector, please see the other extraordinary pieces on actors/actresses and promotional film flyers offered from this collection.
