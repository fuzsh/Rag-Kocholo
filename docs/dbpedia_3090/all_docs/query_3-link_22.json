        "text": "By increasing the total seat count to 899 interior marquee seating and 48 exterior patio seating, our project team breathed new life into one of the most visible and highly trafficked destinations in the city.\n\nA complete aesthetic refresh of the food court was the main scope of this project, including new selections of materials, finishes and circulation strategy. The end result is a totally reimagined and unique dining experience, extending the amenities of the space by appealing to Toronto’s growing downtown population in addition to regular business lunch clientele.\n\nPatrons are drawn into the dining space by an LED media wall awash with color and images that shines over First Canadian Place’s parquette, conjuring up images of shopping and food enticing the senses. Inside the building, the ceiling plane of the main walkway is designed with expanses of wooden slats, meant to evoke the widespread Canadian landscape. The use of wood offsets the crisp, pristine lines of the white marble columns found throughout the existing lobby colonnade. The ceiling flows and meanders suggesting slower speeds of movement at its edges, while through its centre, faster traffic is directed with a cascade of natural light."
