        "text": "Spanning approximately 1.2 million square feet, four city blocks, this convention space was one of the largest in North America at the time of construction and the first Double LEED® Platinum Convention Centre in the world! Our forward-thinking adoption of technology would provide an opportunity to work closely with the designers using 3D modelling for complex details like having to construct 40% of the building over water in the Burrard Inlet, and reconstructing the shoreline to accommodate marine habitat. The Exhibition Hall measuring in at a whopping 240,000 square feet (5 football fields) is so big that the parking lot was built over top to maximize on space.\n\nIn keeping with the environmental requirements, the re-use of ocean water through the central plant would provide heating and cooling throughout the building, and if that wasn’t enough, the structurally glazed curtainwall is made up of over 2,500 glazing units covering 150,000 square feet which is enough to cover nine hockey rinks. With too many awards to list, this project was such a great success for the owner that it translated into another landmark project for PCL in the heart of downtown Vancouver."
