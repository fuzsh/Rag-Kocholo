        "text": "A film adventure like no other, FlyOver Canada is an amazing multi-dimensional theatre flying experience at Canada Place in downtown Vancouver.\n\nThe attraction’s new signature film Awaken Canada debuted on June 28th of this year. It takes passengers all across the country from both coasts on the east and west up to the Arctic in the north. Between August 1st and September 4th in 2024, there’s also Legendary Iceland: Landscapes and Lore.\n\nSpecial films later in the year are HowlOver Halloween (from October 3rd to 31st) and Soar With Santa (from November 21st to January 1st).\n\nFor tickets and full details about what’s showing at the theatre, see the FlyOver Canada website.\n\nFlyOver Canada at Canada Place\n\nFlyOver Canada is an exciting attraction located on the west promenade deck of Canada Place. Its physical address is 999 Canada Place in downtown Vancouver.\n\nThe entire FlyOver Canada experience takes about 25 minutes. It includes a short introductory film – the FlyOver Canada show – plus sometimes one other feature-flying movie presentation.\n\nLooking for an out-of-the-ordinary flying theatre experience? You’ll find it at FlyOver Canada.\n\nSee below for general information about FlyOver Canada. Or click FlyOver Canada at Halloween for information about the attraction in October, or FlyOver Canada at Christmas for details about the attraction during the winter holidays.\n\nThe FlyOver Canada Experience\n\nThe full FlyOver Canada experience lasts for about 30 minutes and includes a short pre-show film. After seeing the first short show guests walk to the next stage, where they sit down and buckle up in a row, ready for the main film or films to begin.\n\nIn addition to the regular multi-dimensional film experience about Canada, the attraction sometimes features additional shows too. At certain times of the year there might be a special presentation about China, Taiwan, the United States, Hawaii, Iceland or some other interesting land, or a special seasonal feature (like something with a Christmas or Halloween theme).\n\nFor tickets and full details about the theatre, see the FlyOver Canada website.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nDuring the main show, when the lights go off, the floor moves away and participants are left hanging over the theatre screen. It feels like being in a giant open-windowed silent helicopter. It’s quite exciting.\n\nAs the show takes spectators over different scenes, the row of seats moves with the film. The wind, mist and smells of the country follow the passengers too.\n\nThe FlyOver Canada film itself lasts for about eight minutes and covers Canada from the Arctic, to the Maritimes in the Atlantic, to Vancouver and the Pacific. FlyOver Canada offers one of Vancouver’s most unique and exciting experiences. We definitely recommend it!\n\nAdmission at FlyOver Canada\n\nThe cost of admission to FlyOver Canada varies depending on a number of factors including your age and both when and how you buy your tickets.\n\nAdmission rates for adults paying online vary by about $5 or so. Tickets for weekdays far in advance usually cost the least, whereas tickets at the gate on holidays usually cost the most. Children ages 15 and under cost about $10 less than adults.\n\nAs of August 2024, average prices for tickets purchased online are listed below. Depending on the date, days expected to be busy may cost a couple of dollars more and days expected to be quieter may cost $2 or $3 less.\n\nAdults: $29 to $33 online when bought in advance\n\nChildren (up to age 15): $19 to $23 online\n\nImportant Note: Because of seatbelt and ride-safety requirements, visitors to FlyOver Canada must be at least 40 inches (or 102 centimetres) tall. If you or your child is shorter than that, don’t purchase a ticket for them online.\n\nFor tickets and full details about the theatre, see the FlyOver Canada website.\n\nHours of Operation\n\nFlyOver Canada is open from 9:30 am until 9:30 pm. Shows run about once every 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nWho is FlyOver Canada for?\n\nFlyOver Canada is a perfect attraction for anyone over 102 centimetres or 40 inches tall who isn’t pregnant, not afraid of heights, not subject to motion sickness, and looking for half an hour of exciting and memorable entertainment. It’s a fun experience for almost everyone and highly recommended!\n\nThe oldest participant on the ride to date has been 104 years old! When we went for the first time we took two children, ages 10 and 12. What were their comments? “That was awesome! That was way better than a regular movie!” In short, they loved it and couldn’t wait to do it again. We’ve been back many times since!\n\nSeasonal Events at FlyOver Canada\n\nFlyOver Canada offers a number of seasonal “extras” at various times of the year.\n\nIn some cases it’s just a little touch, like at Easter when guests are greeted by the Easter Bunny with a chocolate egg at the end of the show (which happens some years).\n\nAt other times, like at Halloween and Christmas, the FlyOver Canada venue gets decorated. The pre-show also has a distinct holiday season-theme, and characters like a witch and Santa Claus make cameo appearances in the main film.\n\nFor details about the attraction’s main holiday-themed seasons, click FlyOver Canada at Halloween or FlyOver Canada at Christmas.\n\nFor tickets and full details about the theatre, see the FlyOver Canada website.\n\nSpecial Shows at FlyOver Canada\n\nIn addition to the regular FlyOver Canada film, from time to time the venue features a second and different film.\n\nLeading up to Chinese New Year in January or February, for example, Flight of the Dragon is a film about China and Soar Over Taiwan is a film about Taiwan. In 2024 Soar Over Taiwan showed from January 22nd to February 11th. Windborne: Call of the Canadian Rockies offers stunning views of Jasper, Banff and Yoho national parks. It showed from January 22nd until June 30th in 2024. Hawaii From Above and Wonders of the American West showed from February 12th until April 21st in 2024. Legendary Iceland: Landscapes and Lore shows from August 1st until September 4th.\n\nThere is also FlyOver America, which is just like the FlyOver Canada multi-dimensional film but with American places of interest and scenery. FlyOver America usually shows as a separate film at separate times for an additional price (although you can get a discount if you want to see both shows). Most years the film about the United States is shown in the early spring and then again in late fall.\n\nFor tickets and full details about the theatre, see the FlyOver Canada website.\n\nChina and Taiwan Videos\n\nFlight of the Dragon is often FlyOver Canada’s special seasonal presentation around Chinese New Year each year. In 2024, instead of Flight of the Dragon, FlyOver Canada featured Soar Over Taiwan, which is similar but features scenes from Taiwan instead of from Mainland China.\n\nTo get an idea of what the experience is like check out the following video about Soar Over Taiwan. It showed in Vancouver between January 22nd and February 11th in 2024.\n\nTips & Advice\n\nBelow are some tips to help you make the most of your experience at FlyOver Canada.\n\nTIP #1: Buy your tickets online in advance and save over 10% per ticket.\n\nTIP #2: Often FlyOver Canada offers convention delegates a discount.
