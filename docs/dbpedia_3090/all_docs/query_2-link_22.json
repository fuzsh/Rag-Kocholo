        "text": "Situated along the stunning waterfront vista of Coal Harbour, Canada Place is virtually the busiest hub of activity in downtown Vancouver housing not one but two convention centres along with the cruise ship terminal’s facility for numerous cruise ships bound for adventures to Alaska during the warmer months of the year.\n\nCanada Place plaza is the location of diverse events happening annually including a splashy display of fireworks during Canada Day as well as an outdoor cinema installation during the summer months. Take a leisurely stroll on the boardwalk to soak in the water and mountain view, plus there’s a great photo op by The Drop; a precisely positioned azure blue inverted exclamation mark located at the tip of the walkway. What’s more, Canada Place happens to be the pick up/drop off location of choice for several popular bus tours of the city as well as for shuttle service to destinations further out including Capilano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain. If you’re a first timer to Canada Place, head over to the Welcome kiosk to get some timely tips on a few must do, must see activities. If you’re seeking a bit of adrenaline, take a thrilling cross-Canada ride on the immensely popular Fly Over Canada, multi-sensory “flying” experience located on the second level of Convention Centre East. What are you waiting for: if you’re stoked to explore Canada Place, it’s conveniently located just a few short steps away from the Auberge Hotel!\n\nInsider tip: take the little known “underground walkway” connecting Convention Centre East to Convention Centre West via inside escalators located in each building to capture a different view of the cruise ships, Coal Harbour and the North Shore Mountains. Enjoy the native artwork flanking the walls while on your short walk underground; if you look up, you’ll capture a mobile of a lively school of metal salmon hung from the ceiling!"
