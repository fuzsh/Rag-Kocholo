        "text": "We’ll meet you at EdgeWalk base camp on the ground level to give you a full orientation before we ascend to the Summit Room, two storeys above the Main Observation Level. There, we’ll strap your harness onto the rail and you’ll be on your way. Starting at the south side of the Tower above 360 Restaurant, you will follow your guide around the circumference of the building before returning. The whole experience takes about 90 minutes from start to finish, with 30 minutes spent on the EdgeWalk.\n\nOnce you’ve completed your Walk, you’ll also receive a certificate of achievement, video, two (2) printed photographs of your Walk and a ticket to visit the rest of the Tower, including The Top!\n\nPlease plan to arrive 30 minutes prior to your scheduled EdgeWalk. Upon arrival at the entrance plaza, please bypass all ticketing lines and proceed directly to the Main Entrance. A team member will direct you through a brief security and health screening. Please allow enough time to gain access to the building, check in with our front desk staff and complete a waiver. In order to expedite entry, please consider travelling light and avoid bringing any unnecessary items or bags. Walkers aged 13-17 must be accompanied by a parent/legal guardian at the check-in process to provide written consent.\n\nWe’ll provide you with a Walk suit to be worn over top of your clothing. Depending on the weather, we’ll also provide hats, gloves and jackets, but you’ll want to dress appropriately for the conditions.\n\nWe also ask that you wear running shoes or similarly enclosed, lace-up footwear. If you didn’t bring a pair with you, we can provide you some to use during your EdgeWalk.\n\nWe want to make the thrill of EdgeWalk available to as many people as possible. That’s why we offer a specially designed one-piece wheelchair, which allows participants who meet our criteria the opportunity to participate. The existing safety equipment harness and overhead trolley system are exactly the same—we have adapted the Walk suit for easier dressing, and the wheelchair has its own attachment to the overhead trolley.\n\nAccessible EdgeWalk experiences will be available daily and must be booked by telephone. Please call 416 601 3833 to discuss your specific needs and arrangements."
