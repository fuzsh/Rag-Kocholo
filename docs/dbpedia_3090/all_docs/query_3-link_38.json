        "text": "Take us to the moment you entered the hotel. What are your first impressions?\n\nLocated on Burrard Inlet—with views to Stanley Park and the North Shore Mountains—the Pan Pacific is most recognizable for its so-called “Five Sails,” massive white sheets that have flown outside Canada Place, the surrounding complex, since Expo ’86. Although the original Teflon-coated fiberglass sails were replaced with new fabric around 2010, today the site remains one of the defining images—if not the most defining image—of Vancouver.\n\nWhat's the story behind the hotel?\n\nThe hotel is part of the Pan Pacific chain, a Singapore-based company that owns and operates 40 hotels worldwide. Located next to the cruise ship terminal, the Vancouver property shares Canada Place with a convention and trade center, as well as Flyover Canada, a virtual flight-motion simulator ride that speeds you across the entire country, from hundreds of (virtual) feet in the air. The ride never leaves the ground, of course. But if you do have a fear of heights, you may want to skip it.\n\nSounds extravagant. What about the rooms themselves—what can we expect?\n\nYou've got lots of great views to choose from: north and west, past the stunning Vancouver Convention Centre toward Stanley Park, or east, a more urban view that takes in historic Gastown and Vancouver's busy port beyond. As for the rooms themselves: Pillow menus and complimentary shoe-shines are included in the entry-level category, but if you want more—the 1,475-square-foot Opal Suite, for example—you’ll also get free private check-in, evening hors d’oeuvres, and a private lounge with a bar that operates on the honor system.\n\nAny good food options on site?\n\nOn the third floor, the Oceans 999 restaurant features live music and a well-regarded buffet-style brunch. On the same floor, the Coal Harbour Bar, with its bathed-in-blue aesthetic, is a great place to relax and unwind while staring out toward Stanley park. One floor up, the Five Sails restaurant is a more upscale experience. But there are so many options within a five-minute walk that your best bet is to head out and explore.\n\nHow's the service?\n\nThe service is impeccable, from luggage handling to check-in. They’ve had practice; in the past, they've hosted Bill Clinton, Aga Khan, the Dalai Lama, Princess Diana and Prince Charles, and more.\n\nWho are you likely to spot staying here?\n\nIn summer, with cruise ships heading from Vancouver to Alaska, Los Angeles, Hawaii, and Japan, many of the Pan Pacific guests are here for a few days before moving on. But there’s also a contingent of younger, well-dressed couple who wear their sophistication on their Gaultier sleeves.\n\nAnd what about the surrounding area—is the neighborhood worth exploring?\n\nYou’re at the foot of Gastown, arguably the best area in the city to grab a meal or a cocktail. You’re also within a couple of blocks of Vancouver’s busy downtown and the many drinking, dining and shopping options on Robson and Aberni streets. And if you want to take a Seabus ferry to North Vancouver’s Lonsdale Quay, with its market stalls and shops, you’re also a two-minute walk from the dock.\n\nIs there anything you'd change?\n\nThe street-level entrance seems disconnected from the rest of the hotel—a necessary, but unfortunate, design quirk.\n\nWell, can't win 'em all. Are there any other amenities we should be sure to check out while staying here?\n\nAt 11,500 square, Pan Pacific’s spa is the largest in British Columbia, with 26 treatment rooms, essential oil–infused steam rooms, and private couples' suites."
