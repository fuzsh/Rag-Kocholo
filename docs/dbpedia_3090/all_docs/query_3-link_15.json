        "text": "Project Overview\n\nConstruction Management for total refinishing of 37,000 M2 of Convention and Meeting Room Levels. Through extensive pre-planning, assignment of multiple superintendents to control up to 220 men on site, Unitech was able to complete $18 million in renovations to the front of house areas between April 6, 2009 and September 9, 2009 with two full use conventions in the middle. Multiple stakeholders with ongoing operations in Canada Place included the Pan Pacific Hotel with associated restaurant and spa, Ports Canada Cruise Ship Terminal, US Customs and the CN IMAX Theatre. Renovations to all back of house areas including the kitchen, servery and administration offices continued after the critical public space deadline was met and the Convention Centre was once again in full operation."
