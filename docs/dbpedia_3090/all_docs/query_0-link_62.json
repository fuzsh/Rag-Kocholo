        "text": "The CN Tower is open year-round. While our busiest months are in the summer, the changing weather conditions of the seasons can create a dramatically different experience, whether it’s the tops of Toronto’s skyscrapers poking through the clouds on a foggy day in the spring or the perfect crispness of a winter afternoon.\n\nThe time of day matters, too. Sunset and evening visits can make it feel like the city has lit up just for you, while mornings and afternoons can show off the full breadth and beauty of Toronto and Lake Ontario. No matter when you choose to visit, though, we always recommend that you buy your tickets ahead of time.\n\nThe best way to buy tickets is through our website, which will ensure that the date and time you wish to visit is available. Tickets can be purchased up to thirty (30) days in advance, and you can purchase up to a maximum of eight (8) tickets at a time—and children aged two (2) years and younger receive complimentary admission!\n\nYou can also buy tickets onsite at our self-serve kiosks or in person at the CN Tower admissions entrance. For existing tickets or vouchers that do not yet have a reservation time, please exchange them in person for a timed ticket. Entry times are subject to availability.\n\nDo not buy tickets from any other source other than the CN Tower or our verified partners, Ripley’s Aquarium and Toronto CityPASS, as the ticket may not be valid for admission. We reserve the right to deny admission in any instance where we cannot verify the origin of the ticket.\n\nAll ticket prices are in Canadian dollars and do not include applicable taxes unless stated otherwise; all prices are subject to change without notice. Tickets and gift cards/certificates are non-refundable, cannot be sold, and will not be replaced if expired, destroyed, lost or stolen.\n\nAll ticket sales are final; tickets are non-refundable, cannot be exchanged, and cannot be re-printed onsite. All ticket sales are subject to any public health measures taken by CN Tower to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which measures may change over time.\n\nAll tickets to the CN Tower are now timed—that means that they are valid only from the specific time and date on your ticket until the end of that day. Once you’re up on the Main Observation Level, you can stay as long as you like. Please note that each ticket is only valid for one trip up the elevator to the Main Observation Level and back.\n\nAdmission to The Top can be added to your Timed General Admission Ticket, either at the time of purchase online or from our kiosk on the Main Observation Level.\n\nIn general, we recommend you set aside two hours to get the full Tower experience.\n\nOur Security team inspects every bag and uses a metal detector to scan for prohibited items, which to ensure the safety of all of our guests, will be confiscated and not returned. See the full list of prohibited items here. We also randomly screen for explosives, and we keep the premises under video surveillance at all times. Our walk-through metal detectors are compliant with applicable electromagnetic standards on human exposure and pacemaker safety.\n\nAll CN Tower employees are trained in health and life safety, including evacuation procedures. In the event of an emergency, please follow instructions delivered over the public address system, or from uniformed employees and security personnel.\n\nGuests, contractors and visitors are expected to adhere to the Customer Code of Conduct. Failure to do so will result in immediate removal from the premises. Ticket holders may also be removed at any time, with the purchase price of their ticket refunded. For those found breaking any law, regulation or venue policy, we also reserve the right to remove them without compensation.\n\nWe’ll meet you at EdgeWalk base camp on the ground level to give you a full orientation before we ascend to the Summit Room, two storeys above the Main Observation Level. There, we’ll strap your harness onto the rail and you’ll be on your way. Starting at the south side of the Tower above 360 Restaurant, you will follow your guide around the circumference of the building before returning. The whole experience takes about 90 minutes from start to finish, with 30 minutes spent on the EdgeWalk.\n\nOnce you’ve completed your Walk, you’ll also receive a certificate of achievement, video, two (2) printed photographs of your Walk and a ticket to visit the rest of the Tower, including The Top!"
