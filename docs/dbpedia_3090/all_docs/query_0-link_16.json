        "text": "Then despite the name, your AirBnB isn't in Chinatown - and given the options for location, with 6 people I'm fairly certain you're doing a whole-home rental of an apartment... which is about 98% likely to be illegal (the remaining 2% of legit licensees are easily recognized as they only rent for a small part of the year when they themselves are on vacation from their primary home). Be aware that enforcement budget has increased, so there's a far-from-zero chance of your rental disappearing without any advance notice if caught - and zero compensation for you if it does...\n\nBut that aside, I'd just walk if you are all mobile. I walk through Chinatown to the pier with a big rolling case no problem, about 2 miles, and your total distance is such that by the time you rolled it to the station and paid 6 people fares, you would probably spend as much as taking 2 cabs! Anywhere in the area you're talking about would be <$10 fare on the meter - if it's a 3 ship day, yes, there could be another few bucks crawling along the last block or so but you can always ask to get out.\n\nIncidentally, big suitcases are effectively banned on Expo line trains - only the Canada Line has space for luggage, otherwise anything that basically doesn't fit your lap is technically against the rules... but enforcement is very low due to trains being automated, and if you are traveling outside peak hours (say 10am onward) you probably won't annoy other pax by stealing seats/standing room from them. But like I said, cabs are porbably going to be a wash in pricing anyway - SkyTrain is very poor value when you only travel a couple of stops!\n\nProbably one of the Espana towers - they have a website that's not owner-restricted login only, so you can read up on the amenities in case you fancy using the pool etc. - or Firenze Tower II the other side of Abbott. Either would be ideal for use of the Costco Elevator - just beyond the lower entrance to Stadium/Chinatown station - instead of Google directions. Once up top, Dunsmuir to Howe for getting to the pier, Coal Harbour etc. on foot without needing to go through Gastown.\n\nSightseeing-wise, with a day and a bit and not knowing what you like or don't I'll point you to Tripadvisor for the biggies - since there's 6 of you, maybe have everyone look over the Top Attractions list and choose their top 3 or so, compare lists, figure out who overlaps with whom and then split up! If you don't have free calls here, the citywide internet works perfectly well for messaging - look for #VanWiFi broadcasting all over downtown - to keep in touch and coordinate meeting back up for lunch etc.\n\nA bit of very-local info about your immediate surroundings: T&T supermarket in the circle of Keefer Place is a good spot for interesting snacks and even some hot takeout food as well as mostly-Asian groceries extremely close to your building. Abbott from Pender to Cordova is definitely a bit scruffier these days - but you might find some of the business on it convenient (e.g. Nester's your nearest Western supermarket, or London Drugs) and it leads up to Water Street which is peak tourist 'souvenir central', all Ye Olde Fake History with iron lampposts, cobbles, and the Steam Clock (that doesn't run on steam) put in during the not-very-historic 1970s. The whole of Gastown is pretty scruffy at the best of times despite some fancy stores - but it's not stabby! You will see street-people around and might get asked for spare change a lot, but you're not at any significant risk of mugging.\n\nVisiting Chinatown - the Sun Yat-Sen garden is absolutely top-notch, rear wall is on Keefer, entrance is just off Carrall down an alley as sometimes the square off Pender is gated these days due to racist vandalism of the location. Be sure to grab some photos of the rebuilt original gate and the new huge Millennium Gate on Pender (you can cut through the International Village Mall on the way to or from your building, the doors next to the ABC Store are right next to the gate). At the back of the mall, look way up, at the rooftops the far side of the Gate on the north side of Pender and you'll see a pretty unusual sight - a totem pole on the roof terrace of Swachays Lodge (native art sold on ground floor, no more food these days unfortunately).\n\nA few interesting historic buildings nearby if you're into architecture - Sun Tower at Beatty/Pender was briefly the tallest in Canada from 1912 until 1913 (the previous record holder, the Dominion building, is also close by at Victory Square - it was actually the tallest in the entire British Empire in 1910!) and on more the opposite end of record-setting, the world's narrowest commercial building is at Carrall & Pender, Sam Kee, worth a photo too (2 storey, window bays above the street, Jack Chow insurance is current tenant).\n\nGranville Island is most easily reached from the Plaza of Nations stop about a half mile away (Map here - stick in your building address for directions, since it's on the lower level it should route you appropriately). GI is mostly shopping, much of it food and some very quirky indy stores, both kiddy-focused and adults-only (booze rather than smut!) - if you see a show you like the look of at any of the theatres/comedy venues, it's a LOT quieter in the evening than daytime (pretty much every sightseeing tour bus stops on GI, so it gets mad busy from mid-morning through lunchtime to early afternoons before the tourist levels reduce)."
