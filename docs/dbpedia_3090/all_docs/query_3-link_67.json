        "text": "OUR STORY\n\nLocated on Vancouverâs waterfront with a dramatic mountain backdrop, the award-winning Vancouver Convention Centre offers one of the most beautiful settings in the world and convenient access to all the major visitor amenities in the downtown core. As British Columbiaâs flagship convention centre, the facility hosts more than 500 events and welcomes hundreds of thousands of attendees each year, while generating significant economic activity for the province.\n\nThe Convention Centre first served as the Canada Pavilion for the World's Fair Expo in 1986. Since then, it has tripled in size with the addition of its West building in April 2009, and is recognized as one of the leading convention centres in the world.\n\nThe Vancouver Convention Centre consists of two uniquely designed buildings, the iconic East building and connected West building, the worldâs first doubleÂ LEEDÂ®Â Platinum certified convention facility. With 466,500 square feet (43,340 square meters) of pre-function, meeting, exhibition and ballroom space, the facility is able to host multiple, simultaneous events as well as large single events with upwards of 16,000 delegates.\n\nThe Convention Centre is designed with the latest environmentally sustainable features and technology, including a six-acre âliving roofâ and an on-site blackwater treatment plant. The Centre also features Canadaâs largest waterfront ballroom with five-story high ceilings, open terraces, and floor-to-ceiling windows that offer breathtaking mountain and harbour vistas.\n\nThe Convention Centre is the first ever repeat winner of the International Association of Congress Centres (AIPC) Apex award for Worldâs Best Convention Centre. Vancouver has consistently been named North America's top destination for international meetings by the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA)."
