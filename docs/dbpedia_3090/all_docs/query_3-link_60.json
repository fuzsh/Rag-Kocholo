        "text": "Anchored off site in Vancouver's downtown harbour, the Canada Pavilion was the largest ever built by the federal government. The design concept blended the styles of a sleek luxury liner with a majestic roof line of five towering sails. Visitors could either enter the fair through the Canada Pavilion or shuttle via train from the main site.\n\nOutside and in, the pavilion housed one of the most comprehensive cultural festivals assembled in one place in Canada. The visitor began his journey through a variety of pop up performances in the style of a travelling circus. The queue into the pavilion was as entertaining as the pavilion itself.\n\nThe first show was comprised of award winning comedy sketches. The comedy routines were performed by a flamboyantly dressed Canada goose and a beaver.\n\nWondrous new Worlds presented a new vision of Canada in four dimensions -- deep space, the earth's atmosphere, undersea and the Arctic. The Celebration theatre hosted an array of patriotic films. Going back in time to the ice age, the Earth Watch theatre told the story of how people have adapted to the changing Canadian climate.\n\nThe Great Hall was a huge expanse. Here, an airship that looked like a flying saucer floated high above the crowd.\n\nTaking the space of an entire wall, the largest ever designed audio-visual presentation was comprised of 108 stacked monitors. By projecting visions of sailing, flying, and blasting into space, the \"Vidiwall\" gave the illusion that the pavilion was in constant motion.\n\nCanadian inventions and discoveries included a prototype of the Maglev (Canada's high speed magnetic levitation train) and new Ice breaker design.\n\nComputer technology was also showcased as visitors could get a hands on look at voice-recognition software (very new in 1986). A favourite exhibit was a robotic arm which visitors could manipulate to fold a paper airplane and toss it across the hall.\n\nArtworks from rising Canadian stars were also featured. A giant transformation mask symbolically told the West Coast Native story of the raven and first human.\n\nThe Canadian pavilion hosted 8 live shows a day, boasted an Imax theatre blended with 3-D technology, hosted the CBC Television newsroom, and was perpetually buzzing with buskers. Walking the promenades, street entertainers and story tellers were constantly gathering audiences.\n\nThe Canada Pavilion was a fair all to itself.\n\nFROM THE BEST OF EXPO GUIDE:\n\nThe Canada Pavilion's five shows, live entertainment and extensive exhibits make a visit here truly memorable.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:"
