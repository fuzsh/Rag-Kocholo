Here, visitors embark on a virtual flight traversing the nation; a single journey accommodates up to 61 individuals, transporting them to a 19-meter (62-foot) diameter spherical screen that employs simulated wind, mist, and various scents to heighten the experience.\n\nWithin the Convention Centre, exhibits from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics are on display, while the Olympic Cauldron against the backdrop of Stanley Park and the mountains offers a picturesque setting for capturing Christmas card-worthy photos.\n\nNavigational signage is well-placed, and a plethora of staff members are typically accessible to facilitate your journey to the appropriate destination.\n\nTip:\n\nFor the 'Fly Over Canada' movie, it's a good idea to pay for your timed tickets in advance over the Internet to avoid lines.\n\nVancouver Downtown Walking Tour\n\nNumerous historic and otherwise notable landmarks scattered throughout Downtown Vancouver make it a hot traveler's destination.
