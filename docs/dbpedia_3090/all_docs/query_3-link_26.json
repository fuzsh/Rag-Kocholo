        "text": "From the design of our double LEED® Platinum certified facility, the use of the latest green technologies to the adoption of green operating practices, the Vancouver Convention Centre is committed to being as environmentally sustainable as possible.\n\nWe’re proud to be the world’s first double LEED® Platinum certified convention centre. Here are a few reasons why we are truly green by design.\n\nThe West building’s six-acre living roof – the largest in Canada and the largest non-industrial living roof in North America – features more than 400,000 indigenous plant and grasses. Our unique roof is designed to act as an insulator, reducing heat gains in the summer and heat losses in the winter.\n\nThe roof is also home to four beehives with European honey bees. The bees help pollinate the plants on the living roof while supplying honey for our ‘scratch’ kitchen.\n\nA restored marine habitat is built into the foundation of the West building. Water quality in the area has improved dramatically, with the growth of a large variety of sea life.\n\nOur sophisticated black water treatment plant recycles grey and black water that goes back into our washrooms for toilet flushing and is used for rooftop irrigation during warmer weather.\n\nOur seawater heating and cooling system takes advantage of the adjacent seawater to produce cooling for the building during warmer months and heating in cooler months.\n\nNatural light and ventilation are maximized throughout the facility.\n\nLocal BC wood products from sustainably-managed forests are used throughout the facility.\n\nWe run an extensive facility-wide recycling program that includes organics."
