        "text": "For over 25 years BC Place has stood as an icon in the Vancouver skyline. As the largest event facility of its kind in the province, it has hosted over 26 million people since opening. The stadium had begun to fall into disrepair, and it became obvious that a major renovation would be required if it was to remain a viable locale for world class events. With Vancouver’s successful bid for the 2010 Olympic Games the stadium was to function as the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies. To create a space that would be suitable for such a significant event, Stantec was asked to help guide the stadium on its journey of renewal.\n\nStantec’s design team worked to completely transform the stadium from a tired, outdated facility into a vibrant center of the surrounding community. Features such as the world’s largest cable supported retractable roof, a unique LED exterior lighting system, and the second largest center-hung scoreboard in North America have garnered recognition from the local and international design communities. While a state of the art sound system, upgraded concessions, and improved seating provide patrons with an enhanced experience and level of entertainment."
