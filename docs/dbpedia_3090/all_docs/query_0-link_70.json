As part of the Concord CityPlace community, the building is adjacent to Rogers Centre and the CN Tower, cementing its foundation as a new piece of the city skyline.\n\nThe towers of Concord Canada House will be illuminated at night with a signature maple leaf motif, wrapping the building in light. Honouring the history of Toronto’s waterfront while featuring a Rideau-Canal-inspired skating rink, life here is a truly Canadian experience."
