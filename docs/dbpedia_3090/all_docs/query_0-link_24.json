        "text": "3 hours ago, PaulaPJ1254 said:\n\nWould you suggest we just request earliest check-in, drop the bags before that and then after check-in, head out to Cap? Is it worth the trip to Cap? I welcome any/all input on how best to best utilize my day in Vancouver before the RCI departure at 4pm. Thank you for your guidance.\n\nOnce you check-in for your cruise, you’re prohibited from leaving the terminal. This is because you will clear US Immigration in the terminal and once you’ve cleared those formalities, you’re considered to be on American soil.\n\nI think dropping off bags at 9:30 am and heading to North Vancouver is cutting it very close. You also have to worry about traffic crossing the Lion’s Gate Bridge. In reality, all aboard will be between 2:00 and 2:30 pm.\n\nIf I were you, I would check out of my hotel later and check in late for the cruise , like 1:00 pm because the lines start to die down during this time, or drop off bags at 9:30am and stick to walking around downtown Vancouver, maybe grabbing lunch. Honestly, those shuttles to Capilano are for passengers that are calling in Vancouver and have a later departure time like 8:00 pm or are disembarking with late flights.\n\nIf you’re set on going to Capilano, there’s an alternative. Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge is free and opens at 7:00 am. The experience is nearly identical as Capilano, but is further away by 20 minutes. Rent a car from the airport and return it to a downtown location near the Canada Place. If you’re on the road by 6:30 am, you’ll have no problems experiencing Lynn Canyon and making it to your cruise check-in on time. This would entail you bringing all your luggage in your car. If you do this, make sure to drop off your party at the Canada Place with the luggage and the person returning the car can walk back.\n\n@PJ1254, I see that you tried to 'flag' me not long after my post, but it seems to have stayed plain text so I didn't get a notification!\n\nNo harm done, as most of what I'd have said was already covered by @SCX22 - I too feel like the value of Cap is poor for visitors, you guys subsidize us locals significantly (we literally pay what you do for one day to get an entire year of access!), and frankly it's a bit of a circus. Lynn Canyon is not only quieter, but IMO a superior experience due to the much more natural surroundings, actual park rangers in an informative little museum/eco-centre, and the cafe is IMO better and verifiably a lot cheaper than food at Cap! The only downside is the hassle of getting there without your own vehicle - transit is possible but lengthy with at least one transfer, on the day you embark it's not a risk I'd take unless you did the rental car thing or found somewhere to stash bags so you could get there nice & early.\n\nAs to transit to Cap, a regular Translink bus from downtown literally stops right outside - which is why I mentioned the $3 ride if you really want to go (it does have a couple of distinctions, being much longer and higher than the Lynn Canyon bridge, and maybe the various modern froo-froo bits actually entice you!) Bus 246 is the one you want - Google Map with directions from a nice, central intersection - for CAD$3.15pp, even less for seniors and kids.\n\nIf it's still something that entices - or doing Lynn by transit or Grouse Mountain or some other North Shore site - then with an airport hotel I'd say that the only way to improve your timing is to spend some money, and stash bags downtown at cost for the morning. The Bell desk at the Pan Pacific holds bags for non-guests and in theory operates 24/7; there are also various luggage storage options in other hotels and shops you can find via Google - bounce, luggage hero, several others operate - which have a more formal system with a hefty guarantee against loss for probably a saving (last time I checked, rates per bag went ~$6-10 vs. $10 at the PP). The official cruise storage at the pier is even pricier, starting at $13!\n\nDepending how many people you have, how many bags need stored, a rental car might work out well financially compared to stashing a bunch of bags for a fee though if you already have good insurance through a credit card, use your phone for GPS etc. to avoid all the bells & whistles. Parking is cheap at Lynn, even cheaper at some other places out of town (with a car, going as far as Squamish would be low risk if you left early enough - so the gondola ride or Britannia Mining Museum might be enticing), and while the cost in Stanley Park is higher a car is actually a pretty efficient way to quickly hit some highlights, as parking rate includes ALL locations so you can stop at Totems, drive on to Prospect Point, then round to the Beaches, the Rose Garden etc. in short hops and the cost is the same for one person or if there's a bum on every seat of the car.\n\nBest thing(s) to do though? That's too dependent on your personal tastes for me to say - if you've never been here the temptation is of course to ask about Must Sees, but with just the morning you can't possibly do more than a tiny amount, so far better to try and figure out what's the best bang for YOUR bucks. Tripadvisor's great for popular site comparisons, a solid idea of what Joe Q Public thinks is 'best' comes from just reading the top ten rankings. Get everyone in your group to look separately, choose their personal top three things, compare lists, and see how close to being on the same page you all are about which things are best for you. Personally I don't even think Cap is a must-see at all, others rave about it because they get more from the experience of being on the highest/longest bridge, looking down through the glass floor of the cliffwalk etc. whereas for me woodlands should be more about the 'forest bathing' quiet ambience and a really narrow canyon with frothing white water is more attractive than a wide-but-boring one, so Lynn checks my boxes much better.\n\nAnd definitely be back in town by lunch if you do decide to roam further in the morning. You really want toi be walking into the pier at 2pm for your planned 4pm leaving - CBP take the pre-screening just as seriously as any other border crossing, and the passenger manifest has to be locked down and transmitted IIRC at least 90minutes before the ship leaves! If it's a busy day with some other ships leaving later, there may still be a bit of queueing even at 2pm unfortunately - but far less than there would have been earlier...\n\n18 hours ago, 1nolaguy said:\n\nSuzd123, I'm not sure if you are still following this but please clarify your advice above. You noted \" skytrain exit waterfront station enter Pan Pacific\", I google-mapped this and it appears about 5-6 blocks from WFS and PP. At 73 and dragging my wife and 4 bags that is quite a hall. Am I doing this correctly? Dropping bags in PP at CS sounds perfect but we are at YRV the night before sailing.\n\nWelcome to posting! Note that if you want to 'ping' someone, you need to type the @ symbol - once you do that, a little popup should appear with a list of names that gets smaller as you type each letter of their handle - and when you see the name you want, click it and you should see their name formatted in a blue bubble (example - I have addressed this post directly to you @1nolaguy so your name appears in a blue bubble, confirming I selected it correctly)\n\nIf you are comfortable moving yourselves and all your bags at least 400 yards without using a porter or an airport trolley, SkyTrain should work for you. If not, take a cab - they're much pricer for two people but are at least fixed rate and significantly cheaper than cruise transfers! $41 is the current rate to the pier from YVR, or vice versa (in CAD, so tip as you would at home for a cab but expect total cost to be about 75% of equivalent USD).\n\nSkyTrain does have multiple exit points - coming in from YVR it's best to board the back of the train, which means when you walk off you should see signs pointing you up to Granville Street conveniently close. There's an elevator right up to street level - and from here, it's DOWNhill to the pier! Not steep, but every little helps! Map from that specific entrance to the pier here. Check out Google's Streetview too, it makes it easier to follow a route if you have already virtually 'walked' it! If you're heading downhill, and can see mountains and water ahead of you, you're almost certainly going the right way!\n\nIf you're feeling good about roling those bags along, you can even walk down a ramp (same one the cars use, very obvious, but with a proper separated sidewalk) directly to the parking level. While it appears this year there's a new system enabling you to drop bags at street level just inside the convention hall, if you arrive early (<10am) you will almost certainly still have to go down to P2 to drop bags so the ramp is a handy shortcut."
