        "text": "Cities around the world are struggling with office towers left empty from the pandemic and the shift to hybrid work. In London, HSBC Bank recently announced it will vacate 8 Canada Square, its 42-story headquarters building, by 2027. The move could leave a colossal city landmark completely empty in London’s once-booming Canary Wharf financial district.\n\nEmpty office towers drain neighborhoods of street life and place investors and cities in peril by cutting off lease and tax revenues. Residential conversion is often touted as a solution, but not all office towers lend themselves to easy residential retrofit. That is especially true for properties of the size and scale of the 8 Canada Square—a 1.6-million-sq.-ft. (164,000-sq.-m.) building with a central core and deep floor plate.\n\nSo, what might be done to position 8 Canada Square for future use and a return to maximum occupancy? David Weatherhead, design principal of HOK’s London studio, proposes transforming the building into a vertical neighborhood with a mix of uses and occupants. It’s a solution that could also apply to empty office towers across the globe. Here’s how:\n\nTwo challenges of retrofitting a building like 8 Canada Square are that the structure has a relatively deep floor plate and a large structural core. Deep floor plates with central cores make it difficult to get natural light into the inner parts of the building, which is vital for residential use and occupant health and wellness.\n\nAside from its four-story podium, 8 Canada Square measures 184 feet (56 meters) wide on each side. This suggests that daylight would need to travel a prohibitively long way (half the length of the building, 92 feet / 28 meters) to reach the centermost point of the building. Yet the tower’s interior isn’t quite as deep as it appears.\n\nFour elevator banks in the central core push the building’s leasable space toward the perimeter of the building. On closer examination, the distance from the building’s shell to its structural core is a maximum of 42 feet (12.8 meters). This arrangement—coupled with the building’s generous floor-to-floor height of 13 feet (4 meters)—allows daylight to easily reach most occupied spaces within the building and opens the tower to various uses.\n\nLet’s explore.\n\n8 Canada Square’s four elevator banks allow the building to be segmented into four unique zones, each serviced by a dedicated bank of lifts. One could imagine 8 Canada Square broken into separate hotel, residential, office and lab zones.\n\nTransfer floors between each zone could provide shared social and connection spaces for the tenants of each zone. Amenities on these floors could include reception, dining, gyms and lounge spaces.\n\nLower levels of the building could act like a town square, bringing building occupants into contact with the broader community.\n\nSee also: Maker Communities Above London’s Train Tracks\n\nA building retrofit could also provide several ways to improve health and well-being, both for residents and the public. Rooftop gardens and greenhouses could provide local and sustainable food. Below grade, portions of the building’s car park could be transformed into a gym and fitness space and additional bike storage.\n\nTo be sure, none of the ideas outlined here are easy fixes. But they are achievable and could help ensure the long-term vitality of a London landmark. The same ideas shared here also could apply to hundreds of other office towers in cities worldwide.\n\nAlso worth mentioning are the financial and environmental savings of retrofitting a building compared to replacing it.\n\nRetrofits can be a less expensive option than building new.\n\nRetrofits cause less disruption to surrounding buildings with shorter build times.\n\nRetrofits are the best option when it comes to the environment and minimizing embodied carbon—the energy expended in the creation of concrete, steel and other building materials.\n\nWant to know about retrofit opportunities and creating vibrant, mixed-use communities? Let’s connect!\n\nAuthor David Weatherhead is a design principal in HOK’s London studio. His recent work includes the master plan for the Bollo Lane Mixed-Use Development, a TfL project that will transform underutilized land along the Piccadilly and District London Underground lines into a vibrant live-work community, and 10 New Bridge Street, a deep retrofit of an office building in the City of London which retains 75% of the building structure."
