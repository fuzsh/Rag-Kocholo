        "text": "The tower is used solely for office space and is not open to the public. In the early days there was a viewing deck but this was stopped due to concerns following IRA bombings.\n\n(taken from TallestSkyscrapers.info)\n\nHowever, it would appear that if you know somebody who works there, they are able to take you on a tour of the building.\n\n25 Canada square, the Citigroup building, which is one of the tallest buildings in London, does have a cafe on the 27th floor (I may be incorrect with the exact floor number), which is open to the public. It offers amazing panoramic views over London, and especially the Olympic sites and London City Airport.\n\nSource: I used to work for Citigroup\n\nCiti's cafe is on the 36th floor. However, you will need to know someone who works there such that you can be there as their guest.\n\nSince 2010 the tallest building in London has been The Shard (309.6m).\n\nImage © User:Colin / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-SA-4.0\n\nIt has a viewing gallery at the top:\n\nLondon's highest and best view is situated at the top of The Shard, on floors 68, 69 and 72. At almost twice the height of any other viewing platform in the capital, it offers visitors unparalleled 360-degree views for up to 40 miles.\n\nUnfortunately it's rather expensive, advance tickets start from £25.95 (adult), £19.95 (child)."
