        "text": "Frequently asked questions\n\nWhat is net zero emissions?\n\nNet zero emissions means achieving a balance between greenhouse gases emitted and those taken out of the atmosphere (Fankhauser et al, 2022). Many countries, companies, and organizations are setting targets for achieving net zero emissions as part of the global aim to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees of warming or less (Fankhauser et al, 2022).\n\nHow did you set your interim target? Why did you not set it higher?\n\nOur ambition is to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management.\n\nDecarbonizing 100% of assets under management is a significant undertaking. In setting the interim target, we focused on investments where (i) we have control and therefore sufficient influence over the outcomes; (ii) we assessed it was commercially viable to do so, and (iii) we could identify and implement actionable initiatives in the near term. Our intention is to increase the proportion of our assets on a path to net zero to 100% over time.\n\nWhat is the target reduction you intend to achieve by 2030?\n\nFor the assets included in our interim target we are targeting to reduce emissions by two-thirds by 2030, compared to a 2020 baseline. Some of our businesses, such as renewable power, are aiming to reduce emissions by 100% by 2030 while other businesses, such as our core office real estate business, are targeting a reduction of 50%. Brookfield, the asset manager, intends to be net zero by no later than 2030.\n\nWhat scopes of emissions are included in your net zero interim target?\n\nOur net zero interim target is based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We are planning to expand our emissions inventory over time to include material Scope 3 emissions, with the benefit of emerging guidance of calculation of Scope 3 as it becomes available.\n\nWhat is your base year?\n\nWe are using 2019 for our Real Estate portfolio baseline.\n\nWhat methodology are you using to align to net zero?\n\nAt the organizational level, we are utilizing the guidance provided by [Paris Aligned Investment Initiative Net Zero Investment Framework] to align to net zero. We will utilize specific sector guidance for business segments where specific guidance is available or being developed.\n\nAre you planning to use offsets to get to net zero?\n\nOur primary focus is reducing emissions. We are cognizant that even after taking every measure possible to reduce a company’s emissions, there may still be residual emissions. We expect to utilize offsets in instances where there are no technologically and/or financially viable ways to eliminate residual emissions.\n\nWhat is the difference between offsets and RECs (Renewable Energy Certificates)?\n\nA REC represents the environmental attributes of 1 megawatt-hour of electricity generated by an accredited renewable energy facility. Emerging market best practice is to use RECs to offset Scope 2 emissions (i.e. the emissions generated by purchased electricity, steam, heating, cooling). Buyers can choose vintage (i.e. year), location, and certification criteria – all criteria impact REC price.\n\nAn offset represents 1 metric ton of CO2 emissions generated by a GHG reduction project. Buyers can choose project location, project type, and certification criteria – with each impacting offset price. Can be used to offset Scope 1, 2, or 3 emissions:\n\nScope 1 – direct emissions generated onsite (i.e. natural gas combustion)\n\nScope 2 – indirect emissions generated by utilities\n\nScope 3 – indirect emissions via purchases, supply chain, employee travel etc.\n\nBrookfield Place is pleased to offer complimentary LIVE stream fitness sessions led by Marilyn Robinson.

Shortlisted for the 2018 Sobey Art Award, Bennett finds inspiration from images and stories created by the practice of artfully removing rock to create a petroglyph. Tepkik draws on the Mi’kmaq petroglyph that depicts the Milky Way, which has been found on the rocky shores of the lakes and rivers at Kejimkujik National Park in Nova Scotia.\n\nBennett’s work employs both large, printed fabric panels and highly reflective surface elements. The piece creates a link to Mi’kmaq ways of being and understandings of our known universe by presenting a visual conversation exploring Mi’kmaq creation stories.\n\nJordan Bennett’s largest piece to-date, the sweeping, colourful Polysilk fabric panels used in Tepkik will transport visitors into the realm of the night sky, bringing the stars and stories of our galaxy into view at any time of day. The installation title, Tepkik, is a Mi’Kmaq word for “night”, reflecting on the creation stories that are told through the stars in the sky. Historical references to the sky, land, and our galaxy are illuminated by Bennett’s bright treatment of colour, both traditional and pop, as well as his interpretation of Mi’kmaq quillwork patterns and motifs. By pushing his limits and employing new materials in his art practice, Bennett has given a new forum for these oral traditions to be told and shared. Using over 200 ft of Polysilk fabric and custom reflective vinyl typically used for road signs, Bennett uses contemporary materials to evoke cultural markers of the past.\n\nTepkik was presented at Brookfield Place New York in the summer of 2019 and was a featured exhibition of The National Gallery of Canada’s Abadakone / Continuous Fire / Feu Continuel in the fall of that year.\n\nAbout the Artist:\n\nJordan Bennett is a Mi’kmaq visual artist from Stephenville Crossing, Ktaqamkuk (Newfoundland). He lives and works on his ancestral territory of Mi’kma’ki in Terence Bay, Nova Scotia with his partner in life and art Amy Malbeuf. Jordan’s ongoing practice utilizes painting, sculpture, video, installation, public art and sound to explore land, language, the act of visiting, familial histories and challenging colonial perceptions of Indigenous histories and presence with a focus on exploring Mi’kmaq and Beothuk visual culture of Ktaqamkuk. In the past 10 years Jordan has participated in over 90 group and solo exhibitions nationally and internationally, as well as created numerous public art commissions. He has been the recipient of several awards and honours most notably short listed for the 2018 Sobey Art Award, long listed for the 2016 and 2015 Sobey Art Award, a Hnatyshyn Foundation REVEAL award and presented with the 2014 Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Councils Artist of the Year. Bennett holds a BFA from Sir Wilfred Grenfell College, Memorial University and an MFA from The University of British Columbia, Okanagan.\n\nBrookfield Place presents World Press Photo, a traveling exhibition of prize-winning images assembled by organizers of the world’s largest and most prestigious annual press photography contest.
