        "text": "Canada Place is an international symbol for Vancouver. This 1.78 million square foot mixed-use waterfront development initially served as the Canadian Pavilion for Expo ’86. The project presented a tremendous opportunity to connect Vancouver’s downtown with the harbour and would play an important role in its future development.\n\nThe notion of a promenade that would connect the city to the harbour became an important concept during the design process. An eleven-hundred foot long boardwalk running along the pier was created at a 45 degree angle to the city grid, overlooking the harbour, Stanley Park, and the mountains. Promenades at both sides of the pier on various levels lead to a plaza at the end of the pier, which is surrounded by an amphitheatre, restaurants, and a small shopping centre.\n\nThe multi-use character of the project was embraced to create urban life as a symbiosis of these different activities. A cruise ship terminal, bus terminal, parking, shopping centre, restaurants, convention centre, theatre, World Trade Centre, office building, and 550-room hotel are completely integrated at Canada Place. To have all these functions combined into one building was a rare urban opportunity and as a result has reflected a vibrant urban experience."
