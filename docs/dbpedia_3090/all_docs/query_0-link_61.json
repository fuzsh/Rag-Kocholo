If you require a setup other than this, it is the responsibility of the group to set up the room and then place it back to the standard boardroom setting by the end of the booked time. Alternative setups include: classroom style for a maximum of 56 people or theatre style for a maximum of 75 people. The Heritage Room is not set up with equipment to accommodate virtual/hybrid meetings - it is for in person meetings.\n\nInternal City of Edmonton: The Heritage Room is now bookable internally by City staff via their Google Calendar. Visit OneCity and search \"Heritage Room\" to view the booking and operational procedures for the Heritage Room. This is now a self-serve room.\n\nExternal non-profit organizations: The Heritage Room is available to local, registered, non-profit organizations once every 90 days (4 times a year). Groups are required to hold insurance for 2 million general liability. Please visit the above link to submit an application.\n\nLocated on the main floor, the City Room is the main public area and focal point of the building. Designed for public gatherings, presentations, and events, this area is bathed in natural light from an eight-storey glass pyramid, which is cleaned by a hydraulic arm (designed and built in Edmonton), which can also be used to hang decorations.\n\nThe virtually non-destructible floor incorporates travertine (honey-coloured stone) from the former City Hall with terrazzo (grey-coloured stone). The wood throughout the building's interior is maple and was laser cut to meet the acoustic needs of the City Room's upper storey."
