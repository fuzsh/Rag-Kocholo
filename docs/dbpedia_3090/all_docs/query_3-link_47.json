        "text": "Simon Little & Richard Zussman, Global News, April 17, 2024\n\nCanada’s latest federal budget is betting big on a housing boom, but some in B.C.’s construction industry say a labour shortage could make Ottawa’s housing goals “meaningless.”\n\nTuesday’s budget sets a target of building 3.87 million new homes by 2031, backed by $8.5 billion in spending on housing initiatives and $55 billion in construction loans modelled off British Columbia’s BC Builds program. “We now have a plan that’s going to get four million homes across the country built by 2031. That is going to make a huge, huge difference,” Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told Global News.\n\nBuilding those homes, however, will require thousands of skilled trades workers, and some in the industry say the bodies simply aren’t there.\n\nBC Construction Association, April 16, 2024\n\nStatistics reported in the Spring 2024 BC Construction Association (BCCA) Construction Industry Stat Pack and BCCA’s annual BC Construction Industry Survey Report show that while workforce numbers have improved over the past five years, it may not be enough for employers in BC’s construction industry who continue to face extreme pressures. This year’s industry survey report includes our bi-annual wages and salaries analysis, with highly favourable indicators for those considering a career in BC’s construction industry, but areas of concern for those who employ them.\n\nDemand for construction remains high in British Columbia, with major projects currently underway at an estimated value of $160B, an increase of $3B over the past six months. This represents an increase of 39% over the past five years. However, at $170B, the estimated value of proposed major projects remains at lower levels than in Spring 2023, when proposed projects were valued at $221B.\n\nDylan Kruger, Vancouver Sun, March 12, 2024\n\nThe federal government’s Housing Accelerator Fund showed promise, but seven cities in Metro Vancouver have had their applications denied.\n\nCanada needs more homes. That point is now painfully obvious and, thankfully, supported by all major political parties. Supply is the answer, and lots of it. In fact, according to expert studies, Canada must build 3.5 million additional homes by the year 2030. Unsurprisingly, we are nowhere close to hitting this target.\n\nWhile a plethora of other policies aimed at addressing the housing crisis have failed over the last decade, the federal government’s housing accelerator fund initially showed promise. Unlike previous ideas that attempted to suppress demand for new home ownership, the fund aims to incentivize local governments to do more to approve desperately needed new homes.\n\nElizabeth McSheffrey, Global News, Feb 20, 2024\n\nThe City of Vancouver is suing three companies it hired to do major rehabilitation work to the Granville Bridge, alleging the final product includes “defects” or deficiencies” that “pose a real and substantial danger” to users. A civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court this month names Associated Engineering (B.C.) Ltd., Graham Infrastructure LP and Ross Rex Industrial Painters Ltd. as defendants.\n\nGlobal News has reached out to each comment on this story, with Associated Engineering stating it’s “investigating” the issues raised. According to the civil claim, work on the Granville Bridge between 2019 and 2021 included the replacement of select expansion joints connecting segments of the bridge, the installation of rubber troughs and the recoating of structure steel members underneath certain expansion joints.\n\nJimmy Smith, BC Gov News, Feb 13, 2024\n\nThe Province has launched BC Builds to lower construction costs, speed up timelines, and deliver more homes that middle-income people who live and work in B.C. can afford.\n\nBC Builds is a new initiative that leverages government, community and non-profit owned and underused land with $2 billion in low-cost financing and a commitment of $950 million for the overall program. “Anyone looking for a place to live knows how hard it is – even if you make a decent salary there are not enough rental homes people can afford,” said Premier David Eby. “The private sector alone has not been able to deliver the homes middle-class people in B.C. need. That’s why we’re taking action through BC Builds to deliver lower-cost middle-income homes, faster, so the people who keep our communities working – like teachers, nurses, and construction workers – can find homes they can afford in the communities they love.”\n\nJoanne Lee-Young, Vancouver Sun, Feb 13, 2024\n\nComparable new buildings in the neighbourhood are mostly occupied except for a few of the lower floors.\n\nThe Vancouver Centre II office tower officially opened a year ago, but it has been one step forward, one step back in terms of filling its floors, according to local commercial real estate agents.They say it is surprising that GWL Realty Advisors’ 33-storey AAA office building at 733 Seymour St. in downtown Vancouver isn’t finding success with tenants. “If you look at other new builds, it’s fair to say they’ve been more successful,” says Vancouver-based Ross Moore, a managing broker at real estate company Cresa, which advises companies on leases. He hasn’t done a deal in the building at 733 Seymour, but says that comparable new buildings such as Oxford Properties’ The Stack, a 37-storey tower on Melville Street, are occupied except for a few of the lower floors."
