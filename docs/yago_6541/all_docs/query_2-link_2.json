        "text": "When five Kurdish prisoners are granted one week's home leave, they find to their dismay that they face continued oppression outside of prison from their families, the culture, and the government.\n\nWhen one of his horses is killed by an automobile, and when it is clear that neither justice nor charity will prevail, the man begins a slow slide into despair. On the advice of a local holy man, and fuelled by an indefatigable optimism, he sets out into the desert in quest of a mythical lost treasure, slipping further and further into that final, ineluctable moment.\n\nThis is the story of Cevher and his family, who all work in cotton fields in late seventies in Turkey. Cevher has to pay blood money to save his life. He even considers getting his daughter married to a rich and old guy. And on the cotton fields, they have to compete with machines, which are preferred to human workers. Eventually, workers unite and go on strike.\n\nAfter betraying his social class, denying his peasant roots and fleeing his native village, Cemil has become a successful businessman and has found a place in the sun among the bourgeoisie. Azem, his childhood friend, has followed a quite different way. refusing the rat race, he has remained close to people of humble origin.\n\nIsmail is out of work despite am obvious willingness to do almost anything to earn enough to provide for his family. He is too well educated for the jobs he hopes to find, but not well enough connected to find the work he is capable of doing.\n\nA father is not able to earn enough money to feed his family. He is waiting to emigrate to Germany. When his landlord's son kills a man while drunk, the father is prepared to answer for the deed himself, provided that the landlord supports his wife and children.\n\nThree poor friends who met in prison have been sent to on various offenses. These three friends do not want to get out when they are released. What are Abuzer, Haci and Arap going to do when they will be out? They have no one, no jobs. Apart from Haci and Arap, everything will be the same for Abuzer, who doesn't know where to go.\n\nMemed is a fugitive with a sole purpose to find and execute bandits in the mountains. When a rich landowner wants to avenge the death of his father, he hires Memed as a bounty hunter.\n\nCoban and his four comrades are smugglers who live in the bleak, inaccesable mountains. They are hard, pitiless men like the county they live in, whose daily commerce is in greed, danger, betrayal and murder."
