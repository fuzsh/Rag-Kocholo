The use of natural lighting long takes, and minimalistic dialogue in films like Umut (Hope) and Sürü (The Herd) contributed to a sense of raw immediacy and authenticity. This approach not only amplified the emotional impact of his stories but also reflected his personal and political struggles, including his time in prison, which significantly influenced his artistic vision.\n\nYılmaz Güney’s Top 5 Films Ranked\n\nYılmaz Güney: Themes and Style\n\nThemes:\n\nSocial Injustice and Oppression: Güney frequently addressed themes of social injustice, class struggle, and the plight of the marginalised.
