        "text": "Kurdish director Atif Yilmaz was another talent discovered by Hurrem Erman, who produced most of his best films: Hickirik/ Hiccup (1953), an adaptation of female writer Kerime Nadir's 1936 novel that was centered on a woman; Ala Geyik/ Fallow Deer (1959), starring Yilmaz Guney at the beginning of his acting career; and Suclu/ Guilty One (1960), adapted from Orhan Kemal's 1957 novel. Yilmaz was notable for focusing on stories of women, like in Daglari Bekleyen Kiz/ The Girl Who Watched the Mountain (1955), starring Sezin, and Kumpanya/ The Company (1958), and later in Ah Guzel Istanbul/ Oh Beautiful Istanbul (1966).\n\nAtif Yilmaz paid tribute to miniature painting and classical Turkish music in the musical comedy Yedi Kokali Hurmuz/ Hurmuz with Seven Husbands (1971), written by Sadik Sendil and starring Turkan Soray.\n\nYilmaz continued his portraits of women with films such as Selvi Boylum Al Yazmalim/ The Girl with the Red Scarf (1977), Mine (1982), Bir Yudum Sevgi (1984), Adi Vasfiye/ Her Name is Vasfiye (1985), in which the story of a mysterious woman is told by the men who know her, and Kadinin Adi Yok/ The Woman Has No Name (1988), the adaptation of Duygu Asena's bestselling feminist novel.\n\nHis films about women assumed post-modernist overtones with Aaahh Belinda (1986), in which a model of commercials ends up becoming the kind of housewife that she was advertising, and Hayallerim Askim ve Sen/ My Dreams My Love and You (1987), in which a man is so obsessed with a movie star that he imagines living with her characters."
