        "text": "Borom Sarret and Umut are two influential films made seven years apart, by Ousmane Sembène and Yilmaz Güney (respectively), two exemplary filmmakers from two different continents. These two films, like their creators, are driven by a common problémtique, and share significant contextual, aesthetic and thematic similarities. Also, they constitute cinematic turning points in their respective geographies by interrogating dominant power relations through their narratives and by daring to reclaim the “voice of the wretched of the earth” through their art.\n\nIn this paper, I first provide a brief overview of the biography and the filmography of the two filmmakers, and the significance of Borom Sarret and Umut in their careers. I then offer a comparative analysis of the two films, examining their socio-political contexts, and some of their main aesthetic and thematic characteristics.\n\nOusmane Sembène\n\nOusmane Sembène (1923 – 2007) was born in a fishing village in Senegal to a Muslim Wolof family[1]. He was expelled from primary school for striking back at his French teacher who had slapped him (Murphy 51) and started working while still in his teens. He joined the French Army at nineteen to mainly escape hunger and upon the end of his service, he participated in the Dakar railway strike of 1947 (subject of his novel, Les bouts de bois de Dieu (God’s Bits of Woods) (1960). A Communist party member, Sembène led a proletarian life in France for over a decade, participating in trade union activities while working at the Citroën factory in Paris and on the docks of Marseilles. Following his first novel, Le Docker Noir (1956), he published several books in French in late 50s and early 60s, but he quickly grew doubtful of their impact on the African people. The turning point in his life was his scholarship to the Gorki Studios in Moscow in 1961, where he studied filmmaking under prominent filmmakers like Mark Donskoi and Sergei Gerasimov. On his return to Africa, he began a long career in filmmaking, favoring local languages and focusing on issues of neocolonialism, poverty, critique of African bourgeoisie, and decolonization in Africa. (Armes)\n\nBorom Sarret (The Wagoner 1963) was Sembène’s first film. He subsequently produced 11 films among which are his first feature film, La Noire de…, (1966) winning the Prix Jean Vigo. His other films include: Mandabi (1968) in his native Wolof; Xala (1975); Ceddo (1977); Camp de Thiaroye (1987); and Guelwaar (1992). His last film Moolaadé (2004) on female genital mutilation won awards at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO).\n\nEven though he is not the first African filmmaker, Sembène is the first sub-Saharan African director of the first feature professional film made in Africa, Borom Sarret , which is considered a “manifesto for black African film”, anticipating the well known Third Cinema manifesto of Fernando Solanas and Octavio Gettino. The start of Sembène’s film career marked the start of an oppositional and neocolonial critical approach to filmmaking in Africa, and also elsewhere in the world. (Barlet 73) As a result, he has served as a model and a significant source of inspiration for many other African filmmakers who have followed his footsteps in shaping oppositional African cinema in a fast changing globalized world.\n\nWritten and directed by Sembène, Borom Sarret is an 18 min black and white film shot on location in post-independence Dakar. Through a panoramic approach, the film follows a day in the life of a poor cart driver (Ly Abdoulay), a “Borom Sarret”, as he runs into local people en route while traversing different neighborhoods of Dakar: an unemployed youth, a trader, a crippled beggar, a pregnant women, a griot[2] (professional storyteller), a man carrying the body of his dead child, a young member of the African elite, and a police officer. (Thackway 88) The climax of the film is when Borom Sarret has to sell his cart to pay the fine imposed by the police officer enforcing the law to keep the rich neighborhoods free from carts, (read, free from Borom Sarrets). As a result, Borom Sarret ends up returning home empty-handed to his wife and children. Throughout the film, Sembène’s own voice-over commentary (in French) expresses the driver’s reflections on life and society in the form of an internal monologue (Salhi 357).\n\nYilmaz Güney\n\nYilmaz Güney (1937-1984), born in a Kurdish family in Adana, southeastern Turkey, was one of seven children of a seasonal worker in cotton farms. He describes himself as an assimilated Kurd, who could speak Kurdish until age 15 at home, yet after that he “was cut off from his roots” by the state’s “Turkification” policies. (Kutschera) Güney quit his post-secondary studies at the age of 21 and became actively involved in the film world. As Yesilçam, the Turkish studio system, grew in strength, a handful of directors, including Atif Yilmaz, began to use the cinema as a means of addressing social problems. Güney first started working with Atif Yilmaz as an assistant and screenwriter, but soon began to appear in melodramas, action films and play adaptations, in as many as 20 films per year between 1958 and 1971. He became Turkey’s most prolific and popular actor in this period and earned the “Çirkin Kiral” (Ugly King) moniker with his darker skin and large noose in contrast to his European looking, pale and blue/green eyed counterparts. He gradually gained attention as a screenwriter and director, preoccupied with the plight of the dispossessed, people suffering from poverty, discrimination, and cruelties and injustices of everyday modern life. (Dönmez-Colin 42)\n\n“Following the military coup of 1960, he was arrested and found guilty of “communist propaganda” in a story he had published at age eighteen”. (Armes 270) He served 18 months in prison and was released in 1963. In 1968, Güney built his own production company, Güney Film, to produce and direct his own films. Over the next few years, the titles of his films mirrored the feelings of the people of Turkey: Umut (Hope, 1970); Aci (Pain, 1971); Umutsuzlar (The Hopeless, 1971); Agit (Elegy, 1972). Following the 1971 military coup, he was jailed during the production of his film Zavallilar (The Poor Ones) which was subsequently completed by Atif Yilmaz in 1975. Upon his release from prison, he completed his last film as both an actor and a director, Arkadas (Friend, 1974). He had just began Endise (Anxiety, 1974) when he was found guilty for killing an anti-communist public prosecutor in a night club as a result of a drunken row and provocation, and was given a prison sentence of 19 years.\n\nEven though he was imprisoned, Güney wrote two of his most successful and remarkable screenplays Sürü (The Herd, 1978) and Düsman (The Enemy, 1979), both directed according to Güney’s instructions by Zeki Ōkten. Düsman won an Honourable Mention at the30th Berlin International Film Festival in 1980. After another military coup in 1980, his films were banned in Turkey and he could no longer work from prison. In 1981 he escaped to Switzerland and finished his most remarkable film Yol (The Road, 1981), which brought him the Palme d’Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, directed once again by Şerif Gören. It was not until 1983 that Güney resumed directing, telling a brutal tale of imprisoned children in his final film, Duvar (The Wall, 1983), made in France with the cooperation of the French government. He died at age 45 in exile from cancer.\n\nLike Sembène, Güney also became one of the early leaders of oppositional filmmaking. The first self-reflective cinema movement in Turkey was the National Cinema in the early 1970s. National Cinema aimed at understanding the people’s aspirations and capturing Turkish experience through an authentically national industry financed by domestic capital, rather than through the importation of models from either the capitalist or socialist West. Throughout 1960s as critics continued to argue about the merits of various cinemas, “‘national cinema’, ‘nationalist cinema’, ‘popular cinema’, ‘religious cinema’, sexploitation films entered through the backdoor, further alienating the audience.” (Dönmez-Colin 41) In contrast, the Revolutionary Cinema, associated with Güney, echoing the principles of Third Cinema movement, “saw cinema as an action upon the world — as a weapon against the status quo”. (Giles and Sahin) Güney was the first actor-director, an insider of the filmmaking industry, who gave his support to this movement that had its origins in political activism rather than the film industry. “With Umut (Hope, 1970) Güney became, at a blow, the effective leader of the Revolutionary Cinema group, lending his prestige and box-office clout to the cause.” (Giles and Sahin) As Umut[3] heralded the beginning of the Revolutionary Cinema, also known as the “New Turkish Cinema”, critics began “to analyze Turkish cinema in two parts: Years before Hope and years since.” (Dönmez-Colin 41) As a result, Güney became a cause célèbre and a model for oppositional cinema in Turkey, subsequently focusing on long standing issues such as feudalism, class conflict, poverty, impacts of modernity, and marginalization of Kurdish people.\n\nUmut is written, directed and also acted by Yilmaz Güney, which has also an autobiographical value. It is shot in Güney’s hometown Adana, and the house where the main character Cabbar (Yilmaz Güney) lives is actually the house where Güney himself grew up in. The film is about a struggling impoverished phaeton (horse drawn carriage) owner, Cabbar (Y. Güney) who is trying to earn a living for his wife, aging mother and 5 children. When one of Cabbar’s two horses dies and he also loses his cart and only livelihood, he decides in desperation to go on a treasure hunt with the help of a local hodja with a reputation of having psychic powers. His last hope slowly turns to a tragic delusion as he loses all hold on reality in search of mythical buried treasure.\n\nContext\n\nAlthough they were made in different geographies at different times, Borom Sarret and Umut share a similar socio-political context of rapid change from traditional to modern society, and a rising resistance to neocolonialism, broadly understood. Borom Sarret is the emblematic cinematic expression of the post-colonial independence movement in Africa in the post World War II era. This was also an era of rapid modernization, expansion of local African bourgeoisie, urbanization, rapid erosion of traditional ways of life, and somewhat ironically also the increasing penetration of Eurocentric culture, market capitalism and centralized state control into everyday lives of Africans. The socio-political context for the making of Umut was not much different. In 1960s and 1970s, Turkey was going through increasing modernization and urbanization, while its large rural population was still in the grip of feudal landlords and its emerging industrial work force was struggling for basic labor rights.\n\nAlthough Turkey does not have a colonial history, Umut is made against a historical background of two intertwined neo-colonialisms. First, following World War II Turkey enters a period of dependency when it fully falls in the American sphere of global influence, which subsequently gives rapid rise to the dominance of capitalism and American culture, and Turkey’s increasing dependency on the West. The second is the historical and increasingly violent neo-colonial domestic dominance of Turkish state apparatus over the Kurdish population (20% to 30% of the population of Turkey). Starting in 1960s, Kurds who had been long confined to their distant villages begin to become increasingly more visible in growing cities and demand social rights and equality.\n\nWhile the American neo-colonial influence is quite visible in Umut, the Kurdish ethnic presence and cultural identity are suppressed[4]. “Though there are many signals that Cabbar and his friends are Kurds, Umut is not obviously a film about Kurdish issues.” (Kennedy 123) In one his last interviews, Güney admits that he could not make Kurdish films because of political pressures, but he confirms that his films were in fact about Kurds and their anti-colonial struggle for their rights[5]. After Umut the socio-political Kurdish neo-colonial context became increasingly evident in Güney’s films as he broke his silence and began to address socio-political and economic problems faced by Kurdish people more directly (e.g., Suru, Yol). (Kennedy)\n\nAesthetics\n\nBoth Borom Sarret and Umut are influenced by Italian Neo-realism. (Dahlberg) (Dönmez-Colin) They share significant similarities with one of the signature films of Italian Neo-Realism, Vittorio De Sica’s Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves, 1948). The lost object crucial for the narrative in all these three films is the livelihood of the protagonist[6]. Dalhberg’s argument about Borom Sarret and Bicycle Thieves, “Both men are simple and naïve, less able than their wives to deal with the practicalities of daily life” (Dahlberg) also seem to apply to Umut. Cabbar’s wife Fatma, grumpy, yet obedient, manages more skillfully than Cabbar every day household chores and challenges even though she whines and curses constantly.\n\nKennedy’s observations about neo-realist aspects of Umut are also applicable to Borom Sarret: “Realist and neo-realist influences, such as the use of non-actors, actual locations, and simple, naturalistic lighting set-ups, are evident throughout.” (Kennedy) Both films are shot on location. While Borom Sarret takes the spectators on a tour of Dakar, in Umut, we follow Cabbar in the streets of Adana, the city where Güney grew up. In both films, poor and rich neighborhoods are contrasted through subsequent segments shot in documentary style with an observing camera. Furthermore, both films also share the neo-realist open-ended approach, rather than offering a sentimental solution or a comforting closure, they leave it up to the audience to decide.\n\nDue to technical limitations, and the common practices of the period in the case of Umut, both films have no-sync sound; they are dubbed. They both also use traditional scores. While Güney uses the same original solemn score on repeated sequences, inspired by traditional Turkish folk tunes, Sembène uses traditional Senegalese background music throughout the film to mainly accompany his voice-over except when Borom Sarret is taking the well-dressed man to Plateau, the rich part of the city that is forbidden to the carts. The moment when the camera starts panning over the modern buildings of Plateau for an establishing shot, the sound track suddenly switches from the traditional Senegalese music to European classical music, as if marking the transgression into the alien world through an invisible boundary. The balance is restored when the music switches back to traditional singing when Borom Sarret returns to his neighborhood and starts feeling at home again.\n\nBorom Sarret and Umut both also display distinctive cinematic shot compositions. In Borom Sarret, “low angle shot of the cart driver looking up his tormentor, the policeman, standing over him with the high-rise homes of the bourgeoisie in the background” (Murphy 51) clearly has the influence of Sembène’s Soviet cinema education. There are also other numerous low angel shots such as of the high rises and Borom Sarret’s feet from the POV of the beggar, emphasizing the presence of underlying hierarchies. Like Sembène and very much in the neo-realist tradition, Güney also uses slow panning shots of the modern multi-story apartment blocks with long takes. However, he also experiments with new techniques, such as the “circling camera” at the scene where Cabbar beats up the pick-pocket, which significantly accentuates the violence.\n\nThemes\n\nThe two films have remarkably numerous common thematic elements. First and foremost, they both give voice to the historically marginalized populations, by depicting real people with real problems from their perspectives. (Dönmez-Colin 42) Borom Sarret is the first African film that speaks with an African voice that had been formerly silenced and infantilized. The voice-over in Borom Sarret, Sembène’s own, is reflective, analytical, and quite aware of the contradictions of the neo-colonial society on it’s so called path to modernity. (Diawara 25) Umut also gives voice to the underprivileged, mostly rural and Kurdish (more on this later in the paper), as economies and social relations that used to sustain these people disappear, their skills become obsolete, and they begin to find themselves at the mercy of a cruel and insecure society. In Umut, as Güney abandons his familiar action figure and lumpen proletariat roles, he switches to an “anti-hero leading an unheroic life” and expects from the audience to think about the aims and reasons of his character’s struggles.\n\nAnother set of common themes revolve around the tension between the modern and the traditional, including the urban versus rural. As mentioned above, in both films the protagonist’s livelihood depend on a horse drawn carriage that is threatened by the advance of the modern city and its amenities such as the paved roads, private cars and taxi cabs. Modern/traditional tension is also amply evident in both films in the constant contrast of the emerging brand new apartment buildings with the surrounding suburbs of squatter housing. In Umut, apartment buildings, swimming pools, women with European style dresses and manners are all contrasted with people’s destitute lives in impoverished neighborhoods. While large banking advertisements herald the coming of modern financial institutions and the penetration of market capitalism, large empty lots readied for the construction of new high rises further underline modernity’s relentless and unstoppable momentum. In Borom Sarret, in addition to a similarly rapid urbanizing landscape, modernity also surfaces in its moral indifference through the well-dressed man who claims to have “connections” in high places and disappears without paying his fee to Borom Sarret. Borom Sarret’s silent dialogue with the traffic lights marks another stark encounter with the modernity’s permeating controls over ordinary people’s lives.\n\nDespite the advances of modernity on many fronts, the traditional is still present in both films. The griot’s songs, reminiscent of Borom Sarret’s ancestors, reminds him of his noble roots, weighing momentarily so heavily on his consciousness that he gives the griot all of his money. The traditional also surfaces in both films as the irrational, mystical and religious. In Umut, one of the dominant themes throughout the film is the Muslim religious leader’s (hodja) supposed mystical powers that would lead Cabbar and his friends to the treasure. Though Cabbar is highly suspicious of such powers at the beginning, he later on substitutes his faith in the lottery tickets with a new faith in the hodja’s psychic powers. Like Güney who quietly demonstrates in Umut the irrationality and the futility of such a blind faith in the traditional, Sembène also questions the traditional through his voice-over of Borom Sarret’s regretful realisation of the money he had wasted on the griot.\n\nAnother key common theme central to both films is the injustice inflicted by the police, i.e., the state, on the protagonists whose encounters with the police in both films constitute a crucial turning point. The police officer in Plateau displays a complete lack of sensitivity towards Borom Sarret’s plight and treats him with utter disrespect. The officer in clean sharp looking uniform (representing the dignified state) is determined to enforce the law at any cost, including the loss of Borom Sarret and his family’s livelihood. Sembène suggests that the order the police is so driven to protect does not (cannot) benefit Borom Sarret, hinting that not much could have changed since the time of colonial hierarchies.\n\nIn Umut, Cabbar’s encounter with the police is not much different. The treatment of Cabbar at the police station is disrespectful and blatantly discriminatory. The police openly favour the owner of the private car who killed Cabbar’s horse, offering him a seat and a cigarette and addressing him respectfully, while insulting and blaming Cabbar not only for the death of his own horse, but also for damaging the rich man’s car. The encounter with the police, like in Borom Sarret, results in Cabbar’s loss of his livelihood, and also his eventual fall into absolute despair. Although neither of the films directly addresses the conflict between the social classes or the struggle between colonial and anti-colonial forces, each film clearly positions the state as unequivocally taking the side of the rich, the powerful, and the modern.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is a historical fact that these two “witness bearing films” (Genova 127) paved the way in their respective geographies for a new cinematic approach that would focus on the problems of the ordinary people and support social change. Regardless which school they are associated with, Third Cinema, New Turkish Cinema, Revolutionary Cinema, they demonstrated that cinema could be effectively subversive and critical in subtle ways without being didactic or becoming a propaganda apparatus.\n\nThere may be several alternative interpretations for the similarities between Borom Sarret and Umut despite their seemingly distant histories and geographies. However, the most plausible explanation seems to lie in a fundamental human comparable socio-political contexts, share a common agenda to provide an effective cinematic outlet for historically silenced voices to interrogate the causes of their oppression and poverty in search of dignity.\n\nBibliography\n\nArmes, Roy.
