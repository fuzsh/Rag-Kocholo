Seyyit Han postpones their marriage so that he can make his fortune elsewhere and return to the village to claim his \"bride of the earth.\" During his prolonged absence, a rich landowner begins to woo the lonely woman, and her brother, intent upon making this propitious wedding happen, spreads the rumor that Seyyit Han has died.",

        "text": "A significant portion of this is sequences showing people riding horses in the distance, crossing the screen, crossing the wide open spaces. It'd feel like filler if it weren't for the fact that it's beautiful; this film reminds (mostly American viewers) of Westerns despite being a Turkish film set in Anatolia. The story itself is direct enough, a love struggle that isn't entirely fair to the woman at the heart of it, with a bitter ending. There's a heart-wrenching death that sets off the final act of the film that is both unpleasant in its treatment of the character that dies and intense and unexpectedly brutal in a way that shows the narrative does not pull punches. It amplifies this and hurts it at once.\n\nThis was a familiar but well-executed violent revenge story which was elevated by the strong contrasts in its depictions of rural Anatolian life.\n\nIt included some beautiful cultural moments featuring music, dancing, ceremonies and horseback processions. That was played against the cruel treatment of the woman pushed into the heart of the conflict, as she's made to marry according to her family's wishes. It laid a clear groundwork for tragedy but still managed to surprise in the exact way it occurred.\n\nI loved the long quiet sections in this. Not only were they set in some gorgeous scenery but they gave extra weight to the change in pace in its final act."
