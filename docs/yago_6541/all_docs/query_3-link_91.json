        "text": "This evening the Goethe Institut hosted a screening of Yılmaz Güney’s 1978 film Sürü (“The herd”). This is a remarkable, mature work, one of those films shot while Güney was incarcerated but nevertheless able to direct (reportedly he was able to view the dailies in his jail). Its protagonist is a shepherd living in the hinterland of Kurtalan. We are once more in the region of Siirt, as in Güney’s earlier Aç kurtlar, about which I wrote a few days ago. And as in that earlier film, the main characters are identifiable as Kurdish via their dress and social position, even if all of the actors are speaking Turkish. Indeed, Güney stated in a late interview that the subject of Sürü was nothing less than “the history of the Kurdish people.”\n\nAs in Aç kurtlar, however, that story is related in the form of a parable whose ultimate meaning is elusive. The protagonist, Sirvan, is married to Berivan, a woman from a rival family, whom Sirvan’s father, a terrifying patriarchal ağa named Hamo, blames for their misfortunes. Berivan has been pregnant three times but the three pregnancies have resulted in miscarriage, stillbirth, and the early death of the child. The shepherds all complain that the land is being turned over to agricultural exploitation. Hamo must sell his herd in Ankara in a last ditch effort to raise enough money to survive the winter. Sirvan joins him reluctantly, in the hopes of finding medical care for the very ill Berivan.\n\nThe family interactions on the pastures play out on an almost mythical level. Feuding families, the conflict between nomad and farmer — all of this has a timeless element. Sirvan’s brother Silo discovers a cache of inscribed lead plates in a cave, some strange, unidentifiable antiquities that he trades with the local peddlar for raisins and lokum. (Eventually he realizes enough of their value to demand some cash.)\n\nThe modern world is first introduced in the course of a visit to Kurtalan. Here, as in Aç kurtlar, Güney exploits the decoration of the interior to dramatize the radical alienation of this world from the remainder of Turkey. A tourist poster of Istanbul, labeled Turquie, hangs in a waiting room packed full of the suffering and old, the weathered faces of the deeply poor. In the doctor’s office Berivan stares at a poster of the Mona Lisa bearing an ad for Visine.\n\nIt is the trip to Ankara that fully allows Güney to explore the radical difference between the southeast and the Turkish Republic. Everything on the train goes wrong. Many sheep become ill, others are stolen by bandits, and Silo is robbed by a prostitute, whom he has taken into the car with the sheep, of all of the money he had made from selling the antiquities.\n\nThe train ride also introduces the possibility and perils of political organization. A young man hawks leftist newspapers from car to car while another, who sings resistance songs the whole way, is under military custody, being shipped off to prison for, as he tells his guard, “singing songs.”\n\nBy the time the family arrives in Ankara it is clear that we are headed for a tragic end — the question is only how bad it can get. Half the herd has died and Hamo receives so little money that it is clear his family will starve. He continues to blame Berivan for all of their misfortunes. She, in the meantime, has become desperately ill. Sirvan brings her to stay with acquaintances from Kurtalan, a family who is guarding a building site in the upper-middle class neighborhood of Gaziosmanpaşa. The parents are bourgeois aspirationists — the father boasts of the caretaker’s apartment they will receive once building is finished, brings Sirvan and Berivan on a tour of the local department stores, and sponsors a night out at a sort of family-friendly nightclub where they watch a singer in a platinum blonde wig and a painfully bad comedy act.\n\nSirvan brings Berivan to a doctor but she is too shy to allow herself to be examined. The doctor prescribes some medicine anyways. The next morning Berivan is dead. Sirvan runs back to tell his father who once again blames Berivan for all their misfortunes; father and son begin to fight and when another man attempts to intervene Sirvan strangles him to death and is arrested. Hamo refuses to bring Berivan’s body back to Kurtalan. We last see him walking in the streets with Silo, who has been entranced by urban life the whole time and now seizes his opportunity to slip off into the crowd. The patriarch is left completely alone.\n\nIn what sense is this the story of the Kurdish people? Clearly there is, as in Aç kurtlar, a critique of disunity, exemplified by the pointless feud between Sirvan and Berivan’s families. The Turkish state is presented here not so much as an enemy as something completely foreign, ineffective, irrelevant. Early in the film we witness a strange gun battle in Kurtalan that leaves two men dead — the Jandarma appear long after everything is over to find only two corpses lying in the street, covered in newspaper.\n\nSirvan, as it happens, holds out great hope, if not for the Turkish state, then at least for Ankara, where, as he tells Berivan, the cure for every illness can be found. İşte güzel Ankara! he exclaims as he carries her on his back through the street, before breaking into a song about the city that he learned during his military service. But far from curing anything, Ankara is the setting for the final and total dissolution of the family. This is in one sense the story of modernity eroding traditional social structures, but the film holds no illusions about or nostalgia for those traditional structures.\n\nSo if the old ways are bankrupt and the Turkish state irrelevant, what is left? The son of the Gaziosmanpaşa caretaker is a young Marxist who tells Sirvan that the ağas are the same as the capitalists — exploiters of the working class. But what good is Marxist analysis for a pastoralist? Which means of production is he supposed to seize? This restrained film, economic in its means and explosive in its few moments of intense drama, seems to conclude on a note of complete hopelessness."
