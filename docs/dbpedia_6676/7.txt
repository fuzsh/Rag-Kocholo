'Love, Life and Laughter' is a gorgeous looking film. The message will raise eyebrows today, and the plot of the film is basically a man writing tragic fanfiction about himself and his girlfriend. However, the acting is great, with Betty Balfour giving a powerhouse lead performance, the production design is something to be admired and the costume design is real eye candy. There are really funny moments as well. The sets recall 'The Joyless Street', but this film has way more joy in it.
