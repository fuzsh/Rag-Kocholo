        "text": "This chapter addresses the presence of Blackpool in British cinema by paralleling three films separated in time but united by the trope of the journey and the focus on female protagonists. The first is Hindle Wakes, in its 1927 silent version of Stanley Houghton’s 1912 stage play, directed by Maurice Elvey, where two friends, young mill workers Fanny and Mary, travel from fictitious Lancashire mill town of Hindle to Blackpool during their summer wakes week holiday. The second is A Taste of Honey, directed by Tony Richardson in 1961from Shelagh Delaney’s play, where the character Jo travels from her home in Salford to Blackpool with her mother, her mother’s lover and a couple of friends. The third is Bhaji on the Beach, directed in 1993 by Gurinder Chadha from a screenplay by both Chadha and Meera Syal, where a group of women travel from Birmingham to Blackpool to have some ‘female fun time’. As I will suggest, Blackpool works in the three films as a prime location for the articulation of female desire and love, as well as frustration and intergenerational conflicts, and this can be observed in the films’ differences as well as in their interconnectedness. My aim, therefore, will be to employ a comparative approach in order to investigate how, in these films, architecture and the city interact with issues of gender and class within the enduring social-realist tradition of British cinema. I will first analyse their realist impulse, evident in their use of Blackpool as a real location and in their depiction of working-class and of diasporic subjects. I will then suggest that Blackpool can be seen as an instance of heterotopia, in Michel Foucault’s terms (1986), a space that contains other spaces, and explain the relevance of this concept by focusing on the films’ style and narrative. I will also suggest that Blackpool appears in the three films as a gendered heterotopia, whose atmosphere of leisure and excess both exacerbates and reflects the female working-class condition, seen here throughout the twentieth century but refuting a teleological view of history. The chapter ends with a reflection on the act of dressing up and dressing down by the female protagonists, seen as an analogy of the transformative power of the trip to Blackpool in these films."
