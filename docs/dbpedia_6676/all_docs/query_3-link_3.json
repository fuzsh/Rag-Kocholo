        "text": "Not technically an Awful British Comedian or Comedienne — but a skilled comic, a singer of comedy songs, and a working class heroine, Gracie Fields also married a silent comedian, Monty Banks, who had directed George Formby, so she’s about as ABC-adjacent as you can get without actually being Arthur Askey’s parasitic twin.\n\nWe’d always rather eschewed GF’s movies, clips of her singing on various old British best-of documentaries had served as a sort of aversion therapy, and I’d been inclined to agree with Ken Russell’s dismissal of this kind of British film — I think he saw her as a kind of male Arthur Lucan. But then we saw HOLY MATRIMONY in Bologna, a sort of homeopathic remedy, with a superb dialled-down perf from GF — not a screech in earshot — and realised she could be adorable. The no-nonsense working/lower-middle-class woman as combined powerhouse and harbour. So it was clearly time to dive in.\n\nWas SALLY IN OUR ALLEY the right place to start? Gracie clearly thought so, as it’s her first film (1931). Directed by Maurice Elvey, whose earlier HINDLE WAKES astonished us at Bo’ness — SO smart and progressive, you could tell that story now. If they still have Hindle wakes.\n\n“Well, that was GHASTLY,” proclaimed Fiona as The End came up, seventy minutes later. I didn’t think so. It was too odd, too well-meaning, and too quaintly primitive for me to resent. Gracie is Sally, who works in a The Green Man and sings on the side. She’s the one northern lass in this London pub, so she sings a song about that so we’ll understand. The plot contrives to have her adopt a waif (future Formby and Max Miller co-star/victim Florence Desmond, who gets to do her Garbo impersonation) and get separated, for a variety of contrived melodramatic reasons, from the love of her life, Ian Hunter. What a wild career that man had — from here to playing King Richard against Errol Flynn’s ROBIN HOOD, to playing the chunky Jesus in STRANGE CARGO, to second banana to Norman Wisdom, much of it loosely bracketed by two turns for Michael Powell (SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS in 1934 to THE QUEEN’S GUARDS in 1961 — the film that REALLY destroyed Powell’s career — PEEPING TOM is innocent!). And yet I feel like Hunter never really found his niche. Or maybe he did but by that time he was too chunky to get in.\n\nThe film is cheap, the sets are paltry, and the WWI sequence is a patchwork of stock footage — we must have had some brilliant artillery back then, because we repeatedly see a big gun fired in the desert and its shells explode in muddy fields. But we do get some location filming with the characters in a cart, so technically a traveling shot.\n\nApart from the leads and Florence we get a fleeting appearance from a barely-formed Robert Coote (What ho!), reliable ABC supporting gargoyles Gibb McLoughlin and Ian Wilson, who was playing small boys aged thirty. Credits include Miles Malleson (He won’t be doing the crossword tonight) and Alma Reville — Mrs. Hitch — who adapted the source play together.\n\nThe film was an RKO release of an ARP (Associated Radio Pictures) production — what this means, thrillingly, is that we get the RKO globe and beeping — those beeps are Morse code for “RKO” — followed by more beeping over the ARP logo, which must surely be Morse for “ARP”. Stick with me, kids, it’s not much fun but it’s educational.\n\nBy the time of KONG in ’33, both companies would merge and make RKO-Radio Pictures, before the remnant or ARP was quietly dropped. Here in ’31 Radio Pictures means just what it says, the company established specifically to translate actors from wireless to screen. Rudy Vallee made his attempt in 1929’s THE VAGABOND LOVER (“We do not speak of it in my house,” was his later verdict.)\n\nIt would be unkind — and unoriginal — to say that Gracie has a good face for radio. She has a characterful face. Even in repose, her expression is sour. I wouldn’t buy food in her pub, going by that look. British movie stars often tended to fall under the heading “unlikely” — the more conventionally appealing, the young, cute and symmetrical — emigrated rapidly, sometimes before even entering movies, like Cary Grant. The surprise with Gracie is that she has an unconventional voice too. In HOLY MATRIMONY this is repressed, and she’s great. Far more than her perfectly normal face and body, her voice is what makes her an acquired taste, like petroleum or hair. But the film has strategies to deal with this, notably her first song which not only establishes her Lancastrian origins but her stellar impersonation of a trombone. “Lancashire Blues” remains my favourite number in the film, a proper Mae West-type blues torch song. Later we get the comic ditty “Fred Fannakapan,” such at a swank soiree, where Gracie’s ability to charm an audience is established.\n\nThis bit is perhaps the sharpest in the film, with lots of interesting class conflict stuff. After winning the crowd over with her song, Gracie is immediately dropped when the dancing starts. When she dances with a waiter (Coote) he’s fired and she storms out. There’s a neat level of social accuracy here — the toffs aren’t personally brutal, they have a butler to be that for them. Fields does some good comedy here, alarmed by the backless gown they’ve put her in, but her scepticism about this whole crowd is established from the start, just by a look.\n\nEven if the film is tatty (it is), the sound quality poor, Elvey’s direction flat and static (a shot looking out of a Punch & Judy show is the main attempt at a camera angle), the attempt to showcase a working class woman and fined her awesome is nevertheless commendable. And she doesn’t screech every line.\n\nI’m tempted to leap straight to SHIPYARD SALLY, directed by Monty Banks, Gracie’s last UK pic. But I’m not sure if Fiona is up for it…\n\nI picked up FOR FREEDOM (1940) on a whim — the blurb on the back of the DVD box didn’t seem to make any sense — something about the rise of Hitler AND the sinking of the Graf Spee. The credits were interesting, though — it’s a Gainsborough picture, co-written by actor Miles “he won’t be doing the crossword tonight” Malleson and Leslie Arliss, future helmer of the studio’s signature films, THE WICKED LADY and THE MAN IN GREY, and co-directed by Maurice Elvey (HINDLE WAKES) and Castleton Knight. Knight made a short called PRELUDE which is a wee masterpiece, and is otherwise known for THE FLYING SCOTSMAN (1929) and for producing A QUEEN IS CROWNED, the Technicolor film of Elizabeth II’s coronation.\n\nFF is a quite bizarre thing, a propaganda movie made at the start of the war, when there was an urgent need for the film industry to prove itself an essential war service, but when nobody quite knew what a propaganda film ought to be or do.\n\nSo this is the story of a father-and-son team of newsreel makers. Scottish actor Will Fyfe is quite funny as the blustering boss, Anthony Hulme is somewhat stiff as his son. We see them shooting newsreels and screening newsreels, and this becomes a slender dramatic skeleton which the filmmakers decorate with a ton of newsreel footage. The characters comment on the unspooling archive somewhat in the manner of MST3K, though with fewer and worse jokes.\n\nBest and blackest joke is when the Russian newsreel guy comes in, and someone asks What happened to the previous guy? “He made a film Stalin didn’t like. They had to shoot it twice.” “And him?” “Shot once.”\n\nThe historical events focussed on give us a chance to figure out what the film thinks its purpose is: Hitler’s rise to power is shown, proving that he’s a bad man (Churchill was in the habit of calling him, literally, “That bad man”). Nazism is portrayed as a smoke-and-mirrors con-job on the German people (nothing about anti-Semitism), and in the most MST3K moment of all, Dr. Goebbels is basically live-dubbed with dialogue which makes him sound like simultaneously a movie producer-huckster and a Chicago gangster (“See?”). So we’re educating the British people to understand why they’re suddenly at war.\n\nThe movie is gentle to Chamberlain and the peace efforts, appeasement and all that — Chamberlain must certainly have still been PM when the movie was being prepped. By the time it opened, Norway was falling, France was in trouble, and Chamberlain was on his way out, to be replaced ironically by the architect of the Norwegian disaster, Churchill.\n\nThere’s an interesting bit where Chamberlain returns from Munich and we get Fyffe and son beaming a spotlight onto his balcony, a neat combination of verite and fiction footage.\n\nWe see Hitler in one scene, and it’s a convincing lookalike (above) but the camera angle somehow tells us this is not legit archive. Mostly the film is fairly honest about what it’s showing us — this is the exception.\n\nThen we get the sinking of the Graf Spee, the first British success of the war, to end on a rousing note. The filmmakers manage to tie this all together by having young Hulme disgrace himself with an ill-timed newsreel on world peace, right before the Anschluss, so he packs off to South America and is conveniently located to capture prime documentary footage of the naval battle there.\n\nThe film climaxes with a bunch of real warship stuff but it’s not certain this actually portrays the ships and skirmishes under discussion. But it also has some reconstructions featuring real people from the conflict — captured sailors. Chief among these is Captain Dove, whose merchant navy ship was boarded and sunk by the Germans. Dove is a great personality and a natural actor — he’d return to play a similar role in Powell & Pressburger’s 1956 BATTLE OF THE RIVER PLATE, which deals with the same events, though he had to stand by and watch Bernard Lee play the movie’s version of “Captain Dove.”\n\n“Do you have any secret papers?” asks the Nazi captain. Dove offers him these:\n\n“I’m sorry, I thought you said ‘cigarette papers.'”\n\nWe also get Terry-Thomas as a newsreader, though sadly he gets neither funny lines nor closeups, and a parody of a Lord Haw-Haw type, who flubs his lines amusingly: “The picket bottleship… I’m sorry, the pocket battleship…”\n\nSpecial effects are limited to one reasonably nice diorama of the Spee’s final fate, and a bunch of aerial shots which are basically animated maps, defiantly unspectacular until you imagine being way up in the sky looking down on real ships at which point the tabletop effects attain a kind of spurious splendour.\n\nUnfortunately Vice Admiral J.E.T. Harper now starts narrating at us.. He turns everything into a rather stuffy slideshow, and his presence in the film isn’t tied to the story set up so far — it feels like the filmmakers have been pushed out and the navy taken control. The fictional newsreelmakers. and the actual filmmakers, watch helpless from offscreen, mere civilians.\n\nI can’t imagine 1940 audiences catching this at their local ABC felt they’d had their money’s worth and seen a proper film, but maybe patriotic spirit would help them convince themselves it was all worth it. I found it a fascinating curio, though, and it’s got me fired up to re-watch the Powell-Pressburger version of this film’s third act."
