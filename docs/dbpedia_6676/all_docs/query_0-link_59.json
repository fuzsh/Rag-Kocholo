A seemingly reserved girl, she became something of a major national celebrity overnight even receiving random proposals of marriage. The stress of the new-found fame may have contributed to her early death from tuberculosis. She is buried on the mainland at St Aidan’s church in nearby Bamburgh where there is an impressive memorial to her life in the churchyard.\n\nSee also the Darling surname\n\nSara Davies MBE\n\nBorn 1984\n\nDragons’ Den Entrepreneur\n\nBusinesswoman and TV personality, born at Coundon in County Durham and the founder of the Crafter’s Companion.

Following defeat he fled Scotland and secretly took refuge in the tight-lipped riverside mining and keelmen community of South Biddick by the River Wear, a place noted for smuggling and activities outside the law. Here he took up residence with a mining family called Armstrong and corresponded with his brother in France. In 1749 Drummond would marry the Armstrong daughter, Elizabeth, though the family wasn’t initially aware of his identity. It seems the influential local Lambton family knew who he was but kept it secret. Drummond worked as a ferryman from a house on the banks of the Wear and unfortunately lost the purse containing the papers proving his identity in the great flood of 1771. He died in 1782 and his grandson Thomas Drummond campaigned to have the earl’s lands restored gaining support from John George Lambton (see also) but Drummond was led astray in London before his appearance at the House of Lords in 1831 to make his case.

The village of Coniscliffe on the banks of the River Tees near Darlington has a name meaning ‘King’s Cliff’ and the ancient church dedicated to Edwin overlooking the river there was probably on the dividing line between Bernicia and Deira. Coniscliffe may have been a royal centre associated with the king. Aethelfrith’s son, Oswald fled into exile during Edwin’s reign.

Flambard built Westminster Hall and made the king rich by a scheme of delaying appointments to important offices like abbots and bishops so the king could collect vast revenues durings their vacancy. Even the appointment of the Prince Bishop of Durham was delayed but eventually given to Flambard himself in 1099 three years after previous bishop William St Carileph had died. In 1100 after Rufus died in an ‘accident’ in the New Forest, Henry I became king and imprisoned Flambard in the Tower of London for embezzlement. Flambard was the first person to be imprisoned in the tower and was also the first to escape, using a rope. He fled to Normandy to join Henry’s brother Robert Curthose. Later pardoned, Flambard was allowed to return and continued the completion of Carileph’s cathedral at Durham. Flambard also built the powerful fortress of Norham Castle on the River Tweed overlooking the Scottish Border.\n\nPeter Flannery\n\nBorn 1951\n\nOur Friends in the North\n\nJarrow-born screenwriter and playwright best-known for Our Friends in the North which he had originally written as a stage play before adapting it as a television series.
