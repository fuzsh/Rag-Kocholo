        "meta_description": "Love, Life & Laughter: Directed by Maurice Elvey. With Gracie Fields, John Loder, Ivor Barnard, Allan Aynesworth. Gracie plays a London publican's daughter named after Nell Gwynn, who much like the original, becomes romantically involved with a King(John Loder). This one however, isn't English, but from a broken down mittleEuropean duchy with a lonely castle amidst an Alpine-like landscape. They meet while she's selling (quite Nell Gwynnishly)oranges on the streets, with proceeds for a charity trust. He gets to know her and hers at the pub, and she attends a full dress affair in his honor at the embassy. The King is informed by his father he must make an announcement that he's going to marry the princess of another royal family in order to acquire badly needed power and funds. Nellie is hurt and runs off, not understanding how much he really wanted her. A telegram with a confusing message is soon received at the pub, and the family leaves to go to the King's side, believing that Nell's to marry him after all. But the truth is evident on arrival, that though his feelings are still with her, he must marry the dull and emotional daughter of the wealthy neighboring monarch. Gracie-that is, Nellie, gamely makes the best of it and takes the silly princess though a crash course in charm, and in no time she become more presentable, and the royal wedding will be a success. Our Nell grins and bears it. Brave girl.",

        "text": "Without Gracie, this film would have disappeared without trace and I doubt anyone would have missed it, although for a rainy Tuesday in the 1930s, it was probably good enough. There is very little to relish in this fary tale romance other than the costume design and make-up, with the roles of Prince Charles and Nellie Gwynn are both wafer-thin and unbelievable. Gracie shines through of course, and does look truely wonderful, but even she can't compensate for the comedy which is not only predictable but also seems to fall flat most of the time. One for devoted fans!"
