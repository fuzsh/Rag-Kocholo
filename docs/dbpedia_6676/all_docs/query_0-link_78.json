This preface provides context for the republication of the author's 1929 book \"The Film Till Now\". The author discusses his initial lack of experience in filmmaking but enthusiasm for cinema. The book was an attempt to unlock opportunities in the film industry but had the opposite effect. Since then, the author has focused on filmmaking rather than writing. He has added new sections and notes to update the book, and brought in Richard Griffith to survey films from 1929 to 1948 from an American perspective. The author reflects on how one's understanding of older films changes over time, and on the challenges faced by filmmakers in securing funding amid the rise of large film studios controlled by business interests rather than artists.",
