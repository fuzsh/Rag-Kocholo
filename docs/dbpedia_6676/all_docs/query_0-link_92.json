        "text": "This is a guest post for Silent London by Neil Brand.\n\nAmong the gorgeously designed pavilions on the banks of the Seine at the Paris Exposition of 1900 was a small, ornate theatre called the Phono-Cinéma-Théatre, which contained a screen and a small musical ensemble. Across the screen moved the greatest actors, dancers, mimes and clowns of the day – they spoke, they sang, they moved to music provided by musicians playing live and they were often in exquisite, hand-tinted colour. Five years after the birth of cinema, film and recorded sound brought France’s finest theatrical artists to mechanical life for the lucky generation of fin-de-siècle Paris. It was ephemera among ephemera, Toulouse-Lautrec’s posters pulled aside to reveal the artists that inspired him, and, of course, not made to last – half a century of progress and war on an industrial scale would sweep away those films and the spirit of The Banquet Years, as well as millions of those lucky or wealthy enough to experience them, leaving the rest of us with just the books, the posters, a few photos … until last week.\n\nOn Thursday last the Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone, Italy, showed 23 surviving films of the 41 originally shot, most complete with their hand-colouring, many with their synchronised sound, almost all accompanied live by a small ensemble directed and arranged by John Sweeney. John had spent months finding as much of the original music to the dances and songs as possible, then rehearsed synchronising them to the pre-recorded singing and dancers’ steps, which were set in stone over a hundred years ago – the result was an astounding time-bridge that placed us all more viscerally in the Paris Exposition auditorium than any sound and image record could have done – the artists were now performing for us, their movements driven by John’s piano, their eyes returning our gaze and their efforts aimed at pleasing us.\n\nIt was all so relaxed – Little Tich missed a catch with his hat but just picked it up and carried on as if nothing had happened, the odd dance step was fumbled, but unlike the stiff subjects of so much still photography of the time, our performers did what they did for the camera just as they had done on stage for years (in some cases decades), blissfully uncaring of giving a “definitive” performance or of the legacy of our critical response from an unimaginable distance of posterity.\n\nSarah Bernhardt fought Hamlet’s duel beautifully, despite her 56 years, and with the addition of Frank Bockius’s uncannily precise sword clashes on triangle; Emilio Cossira sang Romeo’s aria from Gounod’s opera silently, his voice reproduced by Romano Todesco’s single notes on accordion, the intent of feeling vibrant in his features and his genial return for a second bow – Mariette Sully wrung genuine comedy out of singing and dancing “La Poupée” and Cléo de Mérode, La Grande Horizontale to many of the crowned heads of Europe, danced in the way that had turned those heads in the first place.\n\nWe found out what made 1900 audiences laugh, thanks to Jules Moy’s anarchic dancing master and Polin’s Troupier Pompette singing about, among other things, stroking a lady’s leg, wondering at the lack of resistance and, on raising her skirt, realising he is touching up the table leg. The entire 90-minute show was a triumph of 1900 and 2012 technology – I have worked with early film for 30 years, and never have I felt so privileged to see these wonders more clearly than any generation before, even the one for which they were intended.\n\nAbove all, I now feel I understand turn-of-the-century Paris with a profundity that was impossible before last Thursday night – its potency, its sexuality, within which the highest arts of performance were also the most immediately sensual and arresting, its gaiety and love of sensation, the vibrancy and diversity of its entertainments. The combined efforts of the Cinémathèque Française, Gaumont, Lobster Films, Olivier Auboin-Vermorel and the historical and aesthetic energy of Pordenone director David Robinson have brought not just a corpse but a memory back to life – theatre as film as theatre, a heady concoction only available through the medium of “silent film” – in London, the equivalent would be seeing a complete night at the music hall from 1900, in full colour and with synchronised sound – for now, London must get to see this show, preferably in the perfect surroundings of Hackney Empire where the artists can emerge from the proscenium arch of a Matcham theatre – but maybe after Paris has seen its own long-lost child, this November at the Cinémathèque Française – and, of course, John Sweeney and his ensemble will be there to assist at the rebirth.\n\nNeil Brand\n\nAn outstanding day at the Giornate: a varied programme of astonishing films, and excellent musical accompaniment. So while it was drizzly and grey outside, inside the Teatro Verdi all looked bright, even if most of the films tended towards bleakness. After the delightfully sugary surrealism of Felix Trips Thru Toyland (1925) for breakfast, the Giornate hit us with some heavy emotional dramas today – and I relished them.\n\nThe slow but seductive tearjerker Förseglade läppar (Sealed Lips, 1927) is the title track of the Swedish strand and it was a real beauty, directed by Gustaf Molander. Karin Swanström, director-star of Flickan i Frack pops up again (all too briefly as a jealous wife) in this Italian-set romance between a convent schoolgirl and a married English painter. Misunderstandings, emotional repression and heartbreak reverberated against a backdrop of stunning scenery, and with a nuanced, textured score by Stephen Horne too. All I spoke to agreed that the show was stolen by Stina Berg (also seen in Polis Paulus Paskasmäll) as the snuff-snorting nun Sister Scolastica – at her best when engaged in a comedy double-cat with a recalcitrant donkey. The opening sequence, in which Scolastica attempts to take her young charge to the train station was a beautifully simple idea, warmly and expertly played out.\n\nThe second Swedish title of the day came with a warning attached: it starts slow, cautioned the Giornate programme, but soon warms up. Did it ever. In Den Starkaste (The Strongest, 1929) two sailors compete for the hand of the skipper’s daughter, and despite her clear preference for one, and via many complications, they take their macho competitive streaks out into the Arctic Ocean where they are hunting on rival vessels. Blood is spilt on the glaciers, most of it belonging to seals – and in the staggering last reel, polar bears. Polar bears! The Arctic photography is crisp and gorgeous (especially when soundtracked by John Sweeney on the piano), and comes courtesy of expert Swedish cinematographer Axel Lindblom – who is also said to have photographed A Cottage on Dartmoor, more of which tomorrow.\n\nThe first in the highly anticipated Gerhard Lamprecht screenings should also have come with a warning: Die Unhelichen (Children of No Importance, 1926) is a three-handkerchief film if ever I met one. This tale of child neglect and exploitation (let alone what happens to the poor rabbit) was extremely distressing stuff, mostly due to its child stars, who offered heartrendingly desperate performances as the mistreated youngsters. Donald Sosin’s score gave the poignancy extra delicacy and depth. The misery has a purpose: Lamprecht was recreating life as he saw it on the streets of Berlin, but this particular story was based on the findings of an official report into child abuse. A glance through the week’s papers will reaffirm the fact that while it might be accused of manipulation, Die Unhelichen usefully directs the audience’s gaze towards the kind of terrible social problems we still all-too-often ignore.\n\nAn invigorating palate cleanser after all that angst, Dovzhenko’s breakout spy drama Sumka Dypkuryera (The Diplomatic Bag, 1927) out-Expressionisted the Expressionists. Breathlessly fast-paced, ultra-stylised and utterly ludicrous, the film was a joy to watch on the big screen, especially with suitably wild and wonderful accompaniment from Günter Buchwald and Frank Bockius. I wish the Bond franchise looked like this. No wonder Dovzhenko went on to be somebody – and the Ukrainian strand at the Giornate is already proving to be a winner.\n\nThe evening show commenced with a prizegiving (see below) and another modern silent short from Renée George, who last year presented the Paris-set romance Le Paris Nuage – I much preferred this year’s Lago Di Seta, set in Lake Como, and am intrigued to see where her globetrotting, and her adventures in silent cinema, take her next.\n\nThe main feature of the evening was a highlight of the Anny Ondra retrospective: gothicky claptrap it might be, but Czech production Prichozi z Temnot (Arrival from the Darkness, 1921) was wickedly entertaining, even if, yet again, Ondra had little to do, despite a dual role. Rather overburdened by voluminous costumes, crimped hair and overacting co-stars, Ondra pouted and swooned obligingly. And for this, she became the first Czechoslovakian movie star. The plot of the movie was all to do with the elixir of life, a hidden dungeon beneath a mysterious Black Tower, doppelgängers and suchlike popular horror tropes. You would have to have a very hard heart not to smile. And it was a pleasure to hear a Czech group accompany the movie: the Neuveritelno Trio provided enjoyably spooky and strange sounds, though they were nowhere near as camp as the business on screen. Will we see the beauteous Ondra in a role worthy of her talents yet? Fingers crossed.\n\nIntertitle of the day\n\nIt just has to be “I like strong men. Wind drives me to them” from The Diplomatic Bag. Joint runners up are “Sir, you sound as if you have a revolver in your pocket” from the same film, and “Shame on you, farmhand!” from The Strongest. The latter looks far better in the original Swedish, something like: “Hüt dräng!”\n\nLocal-boy-done-good of the day\n\nLondoner Tom Cleary won the prestigious Pordenone Collegium prize this year. The judges, who voted for his paper unanimously, said that he demonstrated a “rare and precious” writing style and a “fresh mind”. Tom, who is a regular volunteer at the Cinema Museum, is just 16 years old. Impressive, huh?\n\nSilent hunk of the day\n\nBengt Djurberg, star of The Strongest. I warned you I was shallow.\n\nFor more information on all of these films, the Giornate catalogue is available here\n\nUpdate: My Guardian report from the Giornate is here\n\nMy report from day two of the Giornate is here\n\nMy report from day one of the Giornate is here\n\nIt was another strong day, and an emotional one too, not least because we were saying our first farewells to the Corrick Collection. There’s just one more batch of these strange and vivid early films to go (on Saturday) before they depart the Giornate schedule for good.\n\nToday’s selection brought us an increasingly rare moment of comedy in the form of the three-minute romp Première Sortie d’une Cycliste (1907), fascinating early 1900s street scenes from China and Japan, a stencil-tinted biblical drama by Louis Feuillade (Aux Lions les Chrétiens, 1911) and some outrageous examples of animal cruelty, from quail-fighting to a brutal twist on archery in Distraction et Sport à Batavia (1911)\n\nThere was more early cinema to savour in Patrick Cazals’ documentary portrait of French star and film-maker Musidora. There was far more to her career than Les Vampires and Judex. She was a prolific writer (of letters, poems and scripts); a painter; a director; a film historian at the Cinématheque; a feminist icon; and yes, a muse to many. Where Musidora, la Dixieme Muse (2013) succeeded best was in interviewing her relatives – who could speak to her personality as well as her polymathic achievements. An affectionate hour. A recording of the woman herself included in the doc captured her opining that films should be produced like good books, with images worth revisiting 20 years after they are made. As the Verdi crowd watched, rapt, as clips of Musidora in her first screen appearance (Le Misères de l’Aiguille, 1913) played, we can fault her only on the scale of her ambition.\n\nAnother good day for the swedish cinema strand, with the first film of the day having special resonance for British silent cinema enthusiasts. Fången Nr 53 (Convict No 13, 1929) is the Swedish cut, more or less a remix, of Asquith’s A Cottage on Dartmoor. This is an ironed-out, simplified version in many ways: it’s a pure silent, so no “talkie” at the flicks; there are no flashbacks, it’s all told in a forward-facing straight line; those little montage inserts are gone too. But the differences are not all so glaring: a rearrangement of shots in certain sequences; altered intertitles give scenes, and the entire film, a subtly different air. It’s less violent, despite that macho title, and perhaps more dare-we-say-it romantic. And one more thing: it’s set in London, until the prison-break, when we are transported to “the highlands of Dartmoor”. Sterling accompaniment was provided by Stephen Horne who, after scoring the UK version, is far more alert to all these details than most of the rest of us.\n\nThe second Swedish film of the day, Hans Engelska Fru (Matrimony, 1927), was as we have come to expect, elegant, emotional, romantic, repressed – and just a little too slow and lengthy for many people’s tastes. I was smitten. Lil Dagover plays a society widow on the London party circuit who falls in love with a wealthy Swedish landowner who lives in splendid isolation near the Pole. The path of true love hits a glacier or two: notably the suave personage of Gosta Ekman as an avaricious playboy loitering in the London scenes and ready to pounce. Praise be, also, that both Karin Swanstrøm and Stina Berg were on hand to play the mothers-in-law. It wouldn’t be the same without them. Kudos to this film also for, despite being silent, having a crucial plot point balance on a radio broadcast.\n\nThe day closed with a really terrific film, one well worth the late night, so I will keep you hanging out for just a moment longer while I deal with some miscellany. I missed Turksib on this occasion, but kicked myself when I heard reports of John Sweeney’s score. You live and learn. I did watch the Soviet animation programme, however. I feel the important film to mention here is Pochta (Mail, 1929), the equivalent of our beloved GPO shorts: a charming mixed-media cartoon in which a global team of diligent postmen send a letter all the way around the world, from pillar to, um, post, as its recipient switches addresses. The blink-and-miss-it butterfly in the final frame was the finishing touch.\n\nThe biggest treat in the bunch, however, was the wacky Hollywood fantasy of Odna iz Mnogikh (One of Many, 1927) in which a Russian fangirl is magically transported to LA to cavort with her idols: Mary, Doug, Charlie, DW, Harold, Buster … and the Danish comedy duo Pat and Patachon, whom we endured on Sunday.\n\nSoviet film-making of an altogether grimmer nature cropped up in the early evening show. You know that when a Ukrainian film is landed with a title such as Bread (Khlib, 1930) you can bet your collective farm that there won’t necessarily be much of it about. A young solider returns from the front full of socialist fervour, but finds his father and many in his starving hometown resistant to his ideas. This film started incredibly strongly and nailed its message firmly to the screen (collective farming + centralised grain distribution = rich harvests for all), but lost its way towards the end. Ukrainian musicians Port Mone Trio provided a modern, powerhouse of a score, though. The Ukrainian strand is never dull.\n\nPrior to Khlib we saw 13 minutes of rural American bliss in blistering Prizmacolor: A Day with John Burroughs (1919) was a joyous nature walk in the company of the literary naturalist and three eager-to-learn scamps. Insects, petals and leaves in closeup; rippling landscapes of forest and wheat. I could have watched for hours, especially with Donald Sosin’s lyrical piano accompaniment.\n\nBut then, a good 13 hours after the day had begun, we voluntarily spent two and a half further hours, locked in urban hell with Gerhard Lamprecht’s emotional assault-course of a street film, Unter der Laterne (Under the Lantern, 1928). It’s Berlin in the 1920s and good girlkultur goes bad as Lissy Arna’s sweet Else falls through social strata like Alice down a rabbit hole: a bullying father, sexual double standards, the sleaziness of show-business and a thriving sex trade are no match for her morals and her romantic dreams. It’s like Pandora’s Box with less glamour and more heart and I savoured every wounding moment. The clever score provided by a group led by Donald Sosin and a record player made great use of a drinking song that features prominently in the stunning freehand intertitles: “Drink, drink, brothers, drink.” The inescapable circular structure, an insistence on escapism through oblivion – rarely has a song so jolly sounded so terribly sad.\n\nAnd on that note to bed. We’ve got unseen Orson Welles tomorrow. I’m more excited about the next Lamprecht, though, to be honest.\n\nIntertitle of the day\n\n“Romantiska dumheter!” Yes, it very well may be romantic nonsense, but I nevertheless enjoyed Hans Engelska Fru very much, thanks.\n\nFor more information on all of these films, the Giornate catalogue is available here\n\nMy report from day two of the Giornate is here\n\nMy report from day one of the Giornate is here\n\nMy report from day three of the Giornate is here\n\nAnother disappointing Anny Ondra performance – but in an unforgettable movie – two Mothers, a part-talkie that wants to be a silent, a Lamprecht with a happy ending, and Buster Keaton with a Benshi. Day six at Pordenone, coming right up.\n\nLet us begin with Anny Ondra. It has been extremely stressful. On paper, a programme of early films made by the bewitching star of The Manxman and Blackmail, Czechoslovakia’s first true silent movie star, promised to be my festival highlight. The reality has been brutal. In these early roles Ondra has had terribly little to do and been physically encumbered by towers of curls on her head and tentlike, unflattering dresses too. She has also, I would venture, been horribly underdirected. Hitchcock may have been a brute, but he would not have stood for her gazing into the near distance, twiddling her hair, when the camera was turning. Maybe she just needed a decent part to get her teeth stuck into; maybe the Czech film industry just didn’t know what they had in her. Maybe …\n\nAnyway, we’ve seen some enjoyable if occasionally hamfisted movies in this strand, and while there has been not as much as we hoped to see from Ondra, I am calling her sometime husband Karel Lamac as the hardest-working man in the Prague movie industry at the time. We have seen drama, action and slapstick from this chap. And he even directed some of these flicks, including today’s absurdity, which was admittedly early in his career. Otrávené Svetlo (The Poisoned Light, 1921) was a bizarre concoction almost like an adventure serial, with a meandering plot, ever-present danger and nonsensical movie-science of the highest order. Lamac stars as well as directs, in a story that contains much codswallop, but principally codswallop concerning a series of assassinations carried out via toxic lightbulbs. When the filament gets too hot, the glass shatters, releasing … poison gas! Thus, late in the movie, we have the threat of murder courtesy of a desk lamp. An anglepoisoning. Ondra appears to be tranquilised, Lamac is heaving the whole messy endeavour on his broad shoulders and, yes, the quarry sequences are quite nice. I bust a gut laughing: definitely in the so-bad-it’s-good-OK-maybe-it’s-just-bad-no-stuff-it-I’ve-not-had-this-much-fun-in-years camp. Camp being the operative word.\n\nThe day had begun with slightly more dignity: an American-style Swedish comedy, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson, 1928) followed the daily Felix cartoon. This was a delightful frippery from the dawn of the sound era. They had the technology, but according to a spoken prologue from the film’s star Fridolf Rhudin, not all of them had the inclination. Thus, the speech tells us we are about to watch a silent, and so we do, apart from a couple of instances where recorded music is used for a gag. Rhudin plays Fridolf, a hapless daftie who nevertheless has a knack for Heath Robinson-esque inventions. The plot hinges on his chutzpah and inventiveness and a series of coincidences, including the fact that two different women, plus his pet rat, are called Mary. The military setting allows for some great aviation sequences, though, and the extended banjo scene is adorable.\n\nEither side of lunch we found ourselves in bleaker, yet still edifying, territory: two different adaptations of Gorky’s Mother, one by Aleksandr Razumnyi from 1920, one the version we know best by Vsevolod Pudovkin from 1926. The former is closer to the source novel apparently, although I found it tricky to follow until the English translations of the intertitles had been switched on. Still, it was a very smartly shot film, with fixed-camera compositions opening up a neat depth of field, and revealing stark, black Lowryesque figures against driven white snow. The action sequences don’t compare though, and the thrill of seeing the Pudovkin film on 35mm, with accompaniment by Stephen Horne and Frank Bockius, was hard to top.\n\nAfter such heavy material, the thought of another Gerhard Lamprecht movie was a bracing one: those shown so far have been distressing stuff. A wiser mind than mine was today positing Lamprecht as a Weimar Ken Loach: the social conscience, the elegant realism … It makes sense, and if so, this was Lamprecht showing his Loachian knack for humour. Menschen Untereinander (People Among Each Other, 1926) is an ensemble drama based in a bustling apartment house in Berlin, thereby introducing several different social types and their stories. Lamprecht wants us to think about the consequences of economic inflation, the scant employment opportunities for older people, and the ethical posers related to the treatment of pregnant prisoners and their babies. He does all this expertly, and yes, the scenes between mother and child were sentiment at its best. But there is comedy, and it is very funny indeed. It helps that it is the grasping landlady who is left high-and-dry rather then the more sympathetic characters, but this film was witty and sharp as much as it was earnest and moralistic. My only gripe was that the character of the prisoner-mother, Gertrud, was comically underwritten. Aud Egede-Nissen does her very best with a character who appears to only activate her mind sporadically, and whose “baby” is obviously a doll for two-thirds of the film.\n\nA rousing finish to the day was provided by Benshi narrator Ichiro Kataoka taking to the stage to narrate a varied programme: some Japanese film shorts and fragments featuring epic fight scenes, Buster Keaton’s slapstick short The Blacksmith and Otome Shirizu Sono Ichi Hanamonogatari Fukujuso (The Scent of Peasant’s Eye, 1935), a heart-in-mouth melodrama about a young girl’s passionate crush on her sister-in-law featuring some beautiful pastoral imagery and sprightly camera movement. Between the film frames, the intertitle designs, the translations, the music and the Benshi’s voiceover there was a lot to take in here. Sometimes, I felt the incessant commentary could be distracting, but there is no mistaking the theatre of the occasion and and Kataoka’s spoken vocal range was just incredible. So many voices in one man. As David Robinson said in introducing the the show, “enjoy the music”: whether that was John Sweeney’s piano accompaniment or the inflections and shifting tones of Kataoka’s voice.\n\nScuttlebutt of the day\n\nI hear Too Much Johnson is a hoax/out-takes from a feature film/uses a stunt double in place of Joseph Cotten/meant to be a melodrama.

John Sweeney is one of London’s favourite accompanists, composing and playing for silent film and accompanying ballet and contemporary classes. He researched and compiled the music for the Phono Cinéma-Théatre project and is one of the brains behind the wonderful fortnightly Kennington Bioscope at the Cinema Museum. The Silents by Numbers strand celebrates some very personal top 10s by silent film enthusiasts and experts. When Silent London started with these lists I joked with a friend that what was needed was a list of silent films to avoid: no sooner had I spoken than films started coming to mind, but I also started thinking of the opposite list, of films that aren’t anything like as well known as I think they should be. So, I’ve settled for five films that you might think would be good but really aren’t, and five films that are definitely worth seeking out. Opinions differ and it’s quite possible that I’ve missed the point of some the films – put me right in the comment space below if you disagree.\n\nFive silent films to avoid\n\nNote: I make no claim that these are the worst films – merely that they should be a lot better given their reputation, or who made them.\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1916, Stuart Paton)\n\nYes, this film features groundbreaking underwater photography for a few minutes, but the screenplay is stupid, the acting is ridiculous, and the editing’s completely random. On IMDB someone writes “It’s by no means a bad movie”, but it is, it really is! Do not watch this movie.\n\nIf it’s submarines that float your boat, try Submarine, directed by Frank Capra.\n\nL’Atlantide (1921, Jacques Feyder)\n\nJacques Feyder was a wonderful director, as anyone who’s seen his Visages d’enfants will know, but this exotic farrago, weighing in at almost three hours, is dreadful. Two French soldiers stumble on the lost kingdom of Atlantis, in the middle of the Sahara Desert (!), which is ruled by the ageless Queen Antinéa. Featuring far too much sand and a decidedly uncharismatic performance from Stacia Napierkowska as the supposedly endlessly fascinating and desirable queen, you really don’t need to see this film.\n\nWatch instead: Visages d’Enfants.\n\nL’Inhumaine (1924, Marcel L’Herbier)\n\nContinuing the French theme … I remember playing for this film and suspecting after about 10 minutes that it wasn’t going to get any better. It didn’t. This film looks a million dollars, but that’s as far as it goes, and two and a half hours is a long time to be looking at set design.\n\nL’Herbier did this sort of thing much better in L’Argent.\n\nKino-Eye (1924, Dziga Vertov)\n\nI like a lot of Vertov, but this film, his first feature, is a mixture of dull and really irritating, with the Young Pioneers posting up propaganda on walls, marching around and generally sorting everyone’s life out. The relationship between the documentary and the experimental in this film is really uneasy.\n\nWatch The Eleventh Year (1928) instead.\n\nThe Extraordinary Adventures of Mr West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (1924, Lev Kuleshov)\n\nThere are all sorts of things to complain about in this Soviet comedy – an American businessman arrives in the Soviet Union with his head full of stereotypes about the Soviet State and its people but of course the real Bolsheviks are lovely and wouldn’t hurt a fly. But the main problem with this comedy is that it just isn’t funny.\n\nIf it’s Soviet comedy you want, you can’t do better than The House on Trubnaya, directed by Boris Barnet.\n\nFive silent films to seek out\n\nI could choose so many films in this category! For a start, some of the lesser known films of Dreyer and Sjöström, for example Dreyer’s The Parson’s Widow, which always reduces me to tears, and Sjöström’s gripping Ingmarssönerna, not to mention just about any film featuring Ivan Mosjoukine, escpecially the surreal Le Brasier Ardent, or the wonderful adventure story Michel Strogoff, but in the end my five choices are:\n\nThe Canadian (1926, William Beaudine)\n\nMade before The Wind, but with a remarkably similar story, I think I like this even more than its more famous cousin. An Englishwoman goes to the wheatfields of Canada to live with her brother on his farm, but quickly alienates everybody there. Seeking a way out, she marries a friend of her brother’s, which doesn’t solve her problems … Less gothic, but just as powerful as The Wind, and unaccountably neglected.\n\nLes Deux Timides (1928, René Clair)\n\nThe great (and justified) reputation of Clair’s The Italian Straw Hat has eclipsed this wonderful film: it may not be have that film’s perfection , but I think it’s funnier, and it also has some brilliantly inventive use of split-screen techniques . A timid lawyer makes a mess of defending a client, who then seeks his revenge by trying to marry the lawyer’s sweetheart, while her father is too timid to stop him. Don’t worry – it all works out in the end.\n\nTrue Heart Susie (1919, DW Griffith)\n\nThis film doesn’t have the reputation of some of Griffith’s other films, but to me it’s just perfect, in its strange way. A story of two people who can’t admit to their feelings for each other, it’s a very simple tale, with wonderful performances from Lillian Gish and Robert Harron. There’s a quality to Griffith’s direction, a kind of passionate sincerity, which combined with the wonderful performances, makes this film unforgettable.\n\nSmouldering Fires (1925, Clarence Brown)\n\nA 40-year-old businesswoman falls in love with a much younger colleague. Then her younger sister turns up … This film isn’t as well known as some of Clarence Brown’s other silents, but for my money it’s one of the best, with an extraordinary performance by Pauline Frederick as the businesswoman. Great direction, and a very touching story.\n\nThe Goddess (1934, Yonggang Wu)\n\nThe IMDB summary puts it succinctly : “Street walker by night, devoted mother by day, a woman fights to get her young son an education amid criminal and social injustice in China.” An unbelievably powerful film made in Shanghai in 1934, starring Lingyu Ruan as the mother, who gives a performance of searing intensity. Unsentimental and quite without melodrama, this is a great film. By John Sweeney\n\nMore Silents by numbers\n\nTen lost silent films\n\nTwo Barrymores today, two appearances from Little Tich and too much, as usual, to recount here. But like the hard-working Cupid in La Rose Bleue (Léonce Perret, 1911), I’m going to give it my best shot. So if you’re sitting comfortably …\n\nIn a move designed to cure, or provoke, homesickness in weary British bloggers, this morning we were treated to 90 minutes of Edwardian Entertainment courtesy of Bryony Dixon and Vanessa Toulmin. Accompanying the 40-odd shorts and fragments on piano, percussion voice and everything in between were Stephen Horne and Frank Bockius on stellar form (Horne’s witty use of a kazoo, yes kazoo, in a telephone sketch was priceless). This was a peek at England in its Sunday best and some more outlandish costumes. It was all fun, fun, fun with trips to the seaside, the Punch and Judy show, fireworks, the cinematograph, barrel jumping, the fun fair, the panto and many wonderful processions showcasing our forefathers and mothers’ considerable talent in the fields of costume design and formation dancing – and not just Morris troupes and maypoles. It’s enough to make one crave a stick of rock and a trip to the illuminations. Certainly my northwestern heart leapt at a panorama of Blackpool. And who could resist the sight of a row of Mutoscopes on Morecambe beach with the sign “Look at this and get a laugh”. The perfect solution for those of us who want to watch the flicks all day without depriving ourselves of vitamin D.\n\nIf you really want sunshine at this time of year, a trip to Greece is in order, and Oi Peripeteiai Tou Villar (The Adventures of Villar, 1924), the oldest film ever restored by the Greek Film Archive, was a sketchy comic caper, doubling as a sun-dappled tour of Athens. Larky nonsense, but great shots of the Acropolis etc. And now I can say I have seen a Greek silent movie, which is sure to wow the folks down at the Rose and Crown on my return.\n\nBut if you want something really gorgeous … the second Dawn of Technicolor compilation had many diverting treats inside, culminating in The Toll of the Sea (1922). This was an exceedingly picturesque melodrama, a reboot of Madame Butterfly in which Anna May Wong plays a young Chinese woman in love with an American. But the bond of love and “marriage” is held more sacred by her than him … Oh and it all ends in sadness and sacrifice and another word beginning with S. Not before Wong’s sumptuous wardrobe and elegant garden (complete with peacock!) have been given the full Technicolor treatment, though. The sweetest of sorrow and the sugariest of eye candy.\n\nAnd the Quality-Street colours continued through the afternoon with a short programme of hand-coloured films by George Méliès, some of which (Jeanne d’Arc, La Légende de Rip Van Winkle) featured live narration our esteemed host, festival director David Robinson. Blink and you missed it, but Little Tich appeared on the very tippiest of toes at the start of Le Raid Monte Carlo-Paris en Automobile (1905), reminding all assembled of his earlier turn in the Edwardian Entertainment programme.\n\nThe Méliès programme was preceded by 15 minutes of material from photographer and film-maker Paul Nadar: scraps of film showing dancers, street scenes and Nadar himself practising his fencing moves. I was particularly taken by the fragments of scenes taken and printed on paper: tiny, halting movements that were replayed a handful of times for the audience, like (don’t hate me) Victorian Gifs. Genuinely haunting, with sublime accompaniment by John Sweeney.\n\nBack to Hollywood though, and Lionel is my favourite Barrymore, this much has become apparent. This morning he was excellent as a guilty man tormented by the sound of sleigh bells reminding him of his dastardly deed in what else but The Bells (James Young, 1926) a lurid story set in rural France, notable also for an appearance by Boris Karloff as a travelling mesmerist – shades of Caligari once more. Hard to forget the scene in which Barrymore plays cards with the ghost of the man he murdered, staking the coins he offed him for, nor the courtroom nightmare, with Karloff extracting a confession under mental duress.\n\nBut John outgothicked his brother later in the evening, with a splendid showing of the 1920 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The house was packed to capacity, and the audience around me visibly squirmed at the ghoulish and quite frankly revolting goings-on on-screen. An actor as expressive as John Barrymore will always thrive with a double-role and scenery doesn’t get chewier than this. It’s hard not to think that Barrymore is having a ball, here. Why not? We were too. According to my sources, accompanist Philip Carli has masterminded this revelatory Barrymores retrospective and after having guided us through The Bells at 9am, he was back on duty at the keys for this evening – thrilling music for a thrilling film.\n\nImpromptu duet of the day: I found this clip of Donald Sosin and Stephen Horne on the San Francisco Silent Film Festival’s latest blogpost from the festival. I felt it my duty to share it with you, what with the cockney accents and all.\n\nHot new Pordenone trend: Queuing for evening screenings\n\nIntertitles (plural) of the day: I do love the classy, moralistic art titles for Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde:\n\nMy blog from the first day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the second day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the third day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the fourth day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the fifth day of the Giornate is here.\n\nFor more information on all of these films, the Giornate catalogue is available here\n\nYou know it’s Pordenone when you’re still having a conversation about melodrama, cliché and the difference between parody and sendup as you turn the key in the lock of your door at midnight. Or maybe that’s just me and the people I choose to hang out with. Still, I think it’s telling, because the penultimate day of the Giornate had plenty for us to chew on, get lost in and provoke the temper too.\n\nBut first, let me lay the scene: a medium-sized town in northern Italy, it’s Friday, spitting with rain. Interior: a bell rings, it’s nine am in the auditorium and it is clear that quite a few people in attendance have that Friday feeling. You know, the one was manifests itself in a splitting headache and grey circles under the eyes? But if there is one thing that we have learned this week, it is that Yakov Pratazanov is worth getting out of bed for.\n\nAnd Chiny I Liudi (Ranks and People, 1929), a portmanteau film comprising adaptations of three Chekhov short stories, was another great “serious comedy”, leading me to kick myself that I missed last night’s Don Diego I Pelageya (1928). Each story deals with the problems of living in a rigorously stratified society: a clerk fears he has offended a high-up and apologises to death; an officer is caught between asserting his authority and sycophancy to a general; a poor woman marries a heartless rich man, but has her head turned when she experiences high society. It was all beautifully done, as witty as it was tenderly heartbreaking. A false perspective frame of the clerk approaching his senior’s desk, and a high-angled shot pretty Anna admiring herself in her finery were particularly memorable. I’m more keen than ever to see tomorrow morning’s sound-era Pratazanov. Another 9am Soviet film, just how I like it.\n\nRussian cinema, but not as we know it, before the midday break without a curio from Germany: Panzerkreuzer Potemkin (1930). This is the “talkie” adaptation of Eisenstein’s classic, of course, featuring the Meisel score (in his own arrangement) and a lot of dubbed dialogue. All the intertitles apart from act breaks have been removed from the body of the film and historical explanations tacked on either end, read out in a thumping German voiceover. So it runs shorter than the original, but for me slightly less smoothly, which I freely admit may simply be due to my familiarity with the rhythms of the silent original. It seems strange to hear the men mutter their complaints rather than seeming to rise instinctively to a collective understanding of their circumstances. And because the film was conceived without so much dialogue, a lot of what we hear in this version is simply redundant. There’s an interesting, unintentional effect whenever dialogue runs over a montage cut, actually, as when an officer shakes a sailor awake or another sailor throws that fateful plate. But anyway, it would be very hard to kill the majesty of this movie – the images speak so eloquently that even if Stephen Horne were to reprise his kazoo routine from yesterday, the audience would still be moved. And of course, for a native German speaker, this may be the Potemkin they have always imagined. See what you think (please excuse the “Verdi tidemark”):\n\nToday was a tale of two Fairbankses, both of them Douglas Sr, and of two Barrymores, both of them John, whom I think we can all agree was a bit of a beloved rogue. In the film of the same title, which came first today, he plays a gadabout poet in a 15th-century Paris so smothered in snow that it looks like a Christmas card. And this is Barrymore a la Fairbanks, just to confuse you, leaping from rooftop to rooftop with a goblet of wine in his hand and a jaunty feather in his cap. You just know that he is going to save France (despite the best efforts of feeble-minded King Louis XI, played creepily by Conrad Veidt with a finger up his nose), win the heart of a fair lady (Marceline Day as a poetry-loving aristo), complete some audacious stunts and compose lots of jaunty (terrible) verse on the spot. There is also a completely gratuitous loincloth scene, for the keener Barrymore fans among us. The Beloved Rogue (Alan Crosland, 1927) is total bunkum, but much more fun than, say When a Man Loves. The only way to enjoy this sort of thing is to commit totally to it, and we were helped along by sparkling accompaniment from not one musician but four: a harmonious grouping of Donald Sosin, Elizabeth-Jane Baldry, Frank Bockius and Romano Todesco.\n\nBut John won’t win my heart that way: I crave romance, and splendour, and something beautiful to soothe my fevered brow. Beau Brummel (Harry Beaumont, 1924) will do the trick nicely thank you. It’s gentler, and more tender than the other JB films we’ve seen this week, even if equally as preposterous. Barrymore is the foppish captain deemed too lowly to marry his lady-love (an excellent, if teenaged, Mary Astor), who therefore plots to take obscure revenge on “society” by insinuating himself into the Prince Regent’s inner circle and fighting the system from within, yeah. But dear me, he does it in style. Skinny britches, umpteen rows of frogging, diamond buttons on his frock coat and a powdered wig – and still all you can concentrate on are those flashing eyes and his wicked comic timing. Preening in front of the mirror, practising his poses, or repeating the same lines to another pretty woman until he almost believes them himself … ah he’s a belov-able rogue here too all right. And in the end, it’s very touching, if both overdone and overlong. Stephen Horne was there for the duration (the Giornate showed the fullest print possible, of course), with a light touch on piano, flute and accordion bringing out the best of the comedy and plucking on our collective heartstrings. Good for the soul.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks is just as reliable a star as JB, if a simpler proposition all round. We were lucky enough to see The Good Bad Man (Allan Dwan, 1916) today, a western that went about its business as swift and straight as an arrow. Fairbanks is a Robin Hood cowboy, stealing from the rich-ish and giving to illegitimate children. Is there a dark secret in his past? Will he discover it, have his vengeance and live to make eyes at Bessie Love another day? I thought he just might – but was I right, kids? Kudos to London-based musician David Gray who accompanied the movie with verve and accuracy – he has been partaking in the Giornate’s musical masterclasses all week and this show marked his graduation.\n\nOur second sighting of Dougie was far more epic. The evening show brought another eye-popping collection of two-strip Technicolor treats, including a bizarre set of out-takes from The Gaucho (1927): a reel of attempts to shoot Mary Pickford as a vision of the Virgin Mary on a rockface. Shimmering loveliness its very self until an assistant hovers into view with a clapperboard. Fairbanks showed his face, and his biceps for the main feature, the unstoppable force that is The Black Pirate (Albert Parker, 1926): as gruesome as it is gorgeous and grand, this is a hard film to take against. If only because that dagger-down-the-main-sail makes you catch your breath each time. And in case you were wondering, John Sweeney can even make a sea shanty sound elegant. Classy stuff.\n\nAlmost time to turn in, and Whoozit (Harold L Muller, 1914) was our first bedtime story. Now, if a whole Charley Bowers movie makes very little sense at all, then I think it’s fair to say a single rediscovered reel will be a puzzler indeed. Great larks though: oysters with eyes humping across the bathroom floor, a teddy bear growing a beard, magic spectacles and an ogre sharpening a giant razor. Deeply enjoyable, brilliantly surreal.\n\nOne last thing before we go. The return of Sidney Drew, paired up here with Clara Kimball Young, to prove that the silent movies were spoofing silent movies long before pesky 21st-century scamps thought to do so. I thought Goodness Gracious; Or Movies as They Shouldn’t Be (1928) was ragged, but good clean fun, with hapless Gwendoline careering through loopy scenarios while chomping on her chicklit and waiting for her “brave youth” Cornelius to rescue her from another poorly framed misadventure. Undercranked and overegged and mad as a box of oysters. But a wiser soul than I caught up with me and raised a valid question: if this is the parody what is the original? Especially bearing in mind that this was made in 1928. Hmmm …\n\nCorpse of the day: Bessie Love’s dear old pa in The Good Bad Man, God love him. Flat out on his front porch and breathing like a freshly landed fish.\n\nAbsurd romantic metaphor of the day: Home is where the hearth is for John Barrymore and Marceline Day in The Beloved Rogue – “Your eyes have swept my heart clean and kindled a fire there that will outlast me.”\n\nTiny things I love about Pordenone No 36: When the logo appears before a film and a group of dedicated colleagues cheer their own archive.

It was surely fitting that our last glimpse of the Giornate, on the capacious screen of the Teatro Verdi, was the little feller himself, in extreme close-up, at high risk of having his heart broken, smiling to the end. City Lights, our gala screening tonight, is not my favourite Chaplin feature but that doesn’t mean it didn’t have power enough to sweeten the end-of-the-festival blues. Rumours that certain of the delegates are likely to be found curled up in Piazza XX Septembre like the Tramp himself come Sunday’s dawning were unsubstantiated as we went to press …\n\nSpeaking of which! I can’t wait a moment longer to to tell you about my most hotly anticipated movie of the Giornate. We all have our foibles, and as a newspaper journalist of increasingly long years, I do like a flick about the inkies. The Last Edition (Emory Johnson, 1925), freshly restored by EYE and the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, promised much joy for the unbridled newspaper geek. Shot on location at the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle, and with its full collaboration, this hotheaded movie is actually a rather clear portrait of the newspaper production process – from commissioning desk to printing press. Mostly the printing press. I was a bit bemused by the moment when the printer turns the masthead and headline upside-down on a plate that has already been made, just by turning a handle. Huh? But I loved the “rush the extra” sequence (“We’ve got eighteen minutes to change the story. C’mon boys!”), which follows the process of swapping in new copy at the last minute from the reporter filing to the copy desk, the typesetters and on to print. I’ve been there myself, with slightly different technology, but the same adrenaline, many a time. Although, needless to say, there were no female journalists in The Last Edition. All stonking if rather rough and ready and a fantastic picture of San Francisco in the 1920s too. I have no earthly idea why they needed to jazz up all this fascinating typesetting material with a plot involving gangsters, corruption and a massive fire at the newspaper office, but I may be slightly biased.\n\nI should mention that The Last Edition was preceded by a 1912 Thanhouser short The Star of the Side Show, about a young “midget”, who refuses to marry the neighbours’ boy, also short-statured, so gets signed up for the carnival instead. It is described in the catalogue as “a prototype for Tod Browning’s Freaks, only more endearing”. That about sums it up. A tricky film to love but another fabulously expressive performance from Marie Eline, the Thanhouser Kid in the lead role. No, in case you’re wondering, she was just a little girl …\n\nMy morning was rather topsy-turvy: super-excited about the cheap and cheerful B-movie, I wasn’t at all prepared for Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney (The Love of Jeanne Ney, 1927). It was playing in the Canon Revisited strand, which, combined with the weighty name of Pabst, leads one to expect greatness. And greatness we got, in many parts. Plenty of plot, perhaps a little too much, and plenty of style too, perhaps a little sporadically. In post-revolutionary Crimea, Jeanne, sweet Jeanne (Edith Jehanne), is in love with Andrew (a very handsome Uno Henning) who is gasp, a Bolshevik, and implicated in the death of her father … Oh never mind, that is just the beginning. The action swiftly moves to Paris, where Jeanne lives with her miserly foster-uncle and sweet blind sister, played by Brigitte Helm (might have preferred to see her in the title role). There is lots of romance, and flair (what a fellow festivalgoer called quite rightly “cool shit with the camera”) and it is all rather marvellous, if not quite what I expected. One to watch again, when my mind is not so befuddled. I found myself playing silent cinema bingo with this one, I confess: international jewel thieves, Russian Revolution, a blind girl, a sinister man with a moustache, a fateful train journey … Maison!\n\nBut I was excited about seeing the final Yakov Pratazanov film. I said so yesterday in fact. And it was excellent, but viewing conditions made it a strange one also. This was a silent movie, which was rereleased in sound form (both times a massive hit). A “talkie” framing plot is wrapped around the silent story, which comically contradicts what we are seeing on screen. However, for the first third or so, the spoken dialogue was not translated, so the framing device became a bit of a distancing device for the dummies like me who don’t speak Russian. However, Prazonik Sviatogo Yorgena (The Feast of Saint Yorgen, 1935) was a sharp and well-played anti-clerical satire (many familiar faces in the cast from the other Pratazanovs). Another one well deserving of a rematch.\n\nMy to-watch schedule is filling up, it seems, so I will save time by never, ever seeing The Mysterious Island (1929) again, much as I kinda enjoyed it, and I have a very soft spot for Lionel Barrymore. This two-strip Technicolor adaptation of Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was hugely ambitious, but terribly creaky. Time has not been kind to its special effects, and the intertitles in this Czech print were hugely wordy and scientifically nerdy too. I was transported back to watching films on TV during half-term as a wee mite. And I also quite fancied a trip to the aquarium …\n\nWe do get well looked after at Pordenone, though – The Mysterious Island was preceded by a few enticing Technicolor scraps, including a real highlight: Clara Bow in Red Hair (1928). With red hair, naturally. And this beauty too:\n\nSo it was left to Chaplin, and his City Lights, to bring down the curtain. A triumphant screening, with Gunter Buchwald conducting the orchestra as they played Chaplin’s notes around, atop and in between Chaplin’s jokes. The film is particularly suited to the lush orchestral treatment, structured as much musically as dramatically, with comic set pieces punctuated by sentimental interludes and the occasional jolt of big-city drama. And the seats of the Verdi rocked as the audience shook with laughter – it was a rousing finale to a tremendous week.\n\nGoodbye all – until next year, this is my last edition of the Pordenone Post.\n\nSo, this finally happened:\n\nI wrote this for the Guardian on Chaplin, City Lights and the Little Tramp earlier this year.\n\nMy blog from the first day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the second day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the third day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the fourth day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the fifth day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the sixth day of the Giornate is here.\n\nMy blog from the seventh day of the Giornate is here.\n\nFor more information on all of these films, the Giornate catalogue is available here\n\nThe Goddess | Why Be Good? | On With The Dance | The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands | Damn the War! | Experimental cinema | The Tribe\n\nSilent film screenings aren’t like other movie screenings. For one, there’s no shuffling out, or chatting during the credits. In fact, there is a distinct order to proceedings: the final card indicates “The End”; the music stops; there is a brief hush; and then, applause. But at the screening of Chinese classic The Goddess (1934) during this year’s London Film Festival, one member of the audience broke ranks. While everyone else in the Queen Elizabeth Hall caught their breath, in that precious pause between the lush orchestral music and the thunder of appreciation, a gentleman behind me forgot himself, and punctured the silence. “Wow,” he gasped. And who can blame him?\n\nThe Goddess (Shen Nu) was, is, a masterpiece, a terrible tale told with great humanity and capped by a staggeringly powerful performance from tragic star Ruan Lingyu. She plays a prostitute, a “goddess” in Chinese slang of the time, who does what she does because she has another mouth to feed at home, her cherished infant son. The scenes in which we see Ruan at work, soliciting, are obliquely shot (shadows, feet, meet at sharp angles), but still somehow bold. Perhaps that is because we are shown her as a mother, a neighbour first, and the reality of her job is a touch too tough to comprehend. And at the beginning of the film, it’s clear that she keeps her work separate from her home life. But one day a venal gambler (Zhizhi Zhang) moves in to her house, and lays his hands on her earnings. And then the gossips begin gossiping and it becomes horribly obvious that the Goddess’s plans to give her son a better life are in jeopardy. Ruan’s beauty is almost more than the film can handle at times, but her performance is deftly nuanced and terribly soulful. The joy on her face when she sees her son succeed at school, her horror when she realises the trap she has fallen into: I am haunted by both of them.\n\nWhile I know I am not the first to acclaim The Goddess, audience opinion was divided on the new score written by Chinese composer Zou Ye. It was undoubtedly beautiful, in fact for some it was too lyrical, but it drifted away from the film at times, missing the cues and shifts in tone that it should have been more alert to. When Ruan skips home with a brand new toy for her son, happy to be free at last, the music expresses her joy and liberation wonderfully. But that same tune continued over the heart-in-stomach lurch when she spots a hat on the table, and the whip pan that reveals the Gambler standing triumphant in her new flat.\n\nNothing to quibble about with the restoration though: the film looks gorgeous, clean and bright. I want, need, to see it again.\n\nAnd I would happily snap up a ticket to see Why Be Good? (1929) once more, especially as Colleen Moore’s life story, and this film, offer such a fine balance to the tragedy of Ruan Lingyu and The Goddess. Moore was quite the perkiest creation ever to appear on screen (her character’s name in this confection is aptly, if bazarrely, Pert Kelly). With her sharp bob and expert comic charm, she was the flappiest of flappers and a huge silent star. And while her career may not have prospered in the sound era, her finances did. She is a happy example of a silent star who invested wisely and lived comfortably until a ripe old age, hanging around long enough to appear in Kevin Brownlow’s Hollywood TV series for example.\n\nSadly, however, the films she left for safekeeping in the studio archive were not so well cared for, so the chances to see her work are few and far between. Why Be Good? is a happy recent discovery and restoration courtesy of the Vitaphone Project and the Bologna labs. All of the Vitaphone discs for Why Be Good? were salvaged, so this silent film has continual sound: music mostly. I confess I was a little wary of the prospect of a running soundtrack of jazz tunes, but I was wrong to worry. The songs are carefully chosen and as well as some mundane sound effects (clattering dance steps, bells and whistles), there are some nifty sound-design jokes, including a comic scene in which two drunken sots “sing” and pound on a car horn.\n\nAs to the movie itself, Why Be Good? is a far more likeable rendition of Synthetic Sin, which showed at Pordenone this month. Colleen is a dance-loving shop assistant, who likes to ham it up as a fast-living flapper when really she’s a good girl through and through. When she falls for the boss’s son (a rather deramy Neil Hamilton) he can sense this instantly, but once their respective fathers start meddling the scene is set for hilarious and heartbreaking misunderstandings. Featherlight fun, with a feminist twist (no, really) and Moore is as sweet and smart as the jazz age scene-setting is seductive. Apparently Jean Harlow is in there among the extras. I well believe it, everything in this film looked too gorgeous for words.\n\nSpeaking of which, Why Be Good? was preceded by a delightful colour short called On With the Dance (1927) in which Josephine Baker herself and many lesser-known, un-named chorus girls take to the stage. Baker’s dance is labelled the Plantation – after the club, and no doubt the other thing too. She’s wonderful, but it’s a little uncomfortable to watch her dancing in dungarees and rags. Anyway, a real treasure from the archive this, and the following scenes of chorus lines spinning through dances ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous are notable for their splendid colour and kooky camera angles. The closeup of a bewildered punter, his sweating face superimposed with a kaleidoscope of high-kicking legs, was hilarious. Very The Pleasure Garden … And of course, this sort of thing is always better with John Sweeney on the keyboard, so we were very much in luck.\n\nThere was another new and notable restoration on show at the London Film Festival, the feather in its silent cap: The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands (Walter Summers, 1927), which was this year’s Archive Gala. And this evening, back at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, was certainly memorable. I have never seen so many shiny brass buttons in one room, between the Royal Marines band on stage and the many Navy personnel in dress uniform in the stalls. And at how many screenings are you greeted at the door by sailors in crisp-blue-and-white handing out programmes? Too few.\n\nThis site already contains many, many words about this movie, but I’ll just add a few more to say that Summers naval spectacular looked wonderful on the big screen, crisply restored, and superbly accompanied by the Royal Marines playing Simon Dobson’s new multilayered and high-octane score. It’s a thrilling film, and more so when seen with a large and appreciative audience. It’s a big movie too, with so many men and such vast boats on an even wider sea, so this really is the best way to see it. The “Effort” montage sequence shone particularly – I encourage you to catch a cinema screening. Brace yourself for the gunfire though, it’s every bit as loud as it needs to be.\n\nYou can read my Guardian feature on The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands here. It is on an extended run at BFI Southbank and is on release at selected cinemas nationwide now, and you can also watch it on the BFIplayer.\n\nMaudite Soit la Guerre (Damn the War!, 1914) is a dreamlike piece that rapidly becomes a nightmare, a film whose vivid beauty lingers in the mind long after it has ended. It’s a film with a tough subject: young lovers divided by a brutal war between neighbouring countries. There are two things that make this film so special: the first is the gorgeous, and very sophisticated use of Pathé-color – that is aniline dyes applied by hand to each frame using a stencil. It’s more lifelike than you might expect, with delicately variegated foliage and crisp blue skies, but in fact the stained-glass effect, like an animated watercolour, is striking in itself. And the use of red washes to convey explosions enhances the battle scenes no end, which are already very well staged and framed (the aviation sequences are particularly memorable).\n\nThe second factor is a question of eerie timing: Maudite Soit la Guerre was prescient, rather than topical. This Belgian pacifist film, directed by Alfred Machin, a Frenchman, was made and released before the outbreak of the first world war, which makes its final message, that the horrors inflicted during conflict blight an entire lifetime, all the more powerful.\n\nBut even taken out of context, watched a century later, this is an assured film, as confident in its style as its political purpose. It’s not just the colours, but those raging war scenes and the way that throughout the film, double-exposures and cutaway inset scenes are deployed to tell the story with minimal use of intertitling. The final shot, a simple close-up with delicate blue and green tinting, is utterly devastating – and rendered beautifully in this fine restoration by the Belgian Film Institute.\n\nEver had to rearrange your face when someone asks incredulously whether anyone makes silent films these days? Yup, me too. There were plenty of silents and sort-of silents in the experimental film strand at LFF this year. Here are a handful of those I saw.\n\nAt just shy of three minutes, Stuart Pound’s Vampire Bat (2014) plays like a pop video: being a selection of snippets from Nosferatu (1922) stitched together, duplicated, rewound and replayed. There’s a touch of polarisation and a globular device creeping across the frame that almost recalls nitrate decomposition. And it all plays out to a hard rock soundtrack: Evangelista’s Vampire Bat. It’s cool (hat-tip FW, yeah?), but it doesn’t really go anywhere – except to remind you how terrifying Max Schreck is in this role.\n\nA silent twist on film noir, Urschrift (Julia Dogra-Brazell, 2014) “revels in the generic clichés of the 40s police procedural thriller”. The title means “original” and for most of its running time, the screen is taken up by a blank film frame, sprocket holes on display, slightly out of focus in scratchy black-and-white. Flash cuts of street neon, typewriter keys, guns, casinos and a sinister figure in a doorway combine with a juddering, collage soundtrack to evoke detective thrillers, projecting a whole movie on to those empty frames. Its remarkable how much visual and aural information Dogra-Brazell packs in this way – it’s a jumpy mini-noir and inexplicably unsettling.\n\nGerman film-maker Sylvia Schedelbauer offered a trip to the moon, of sorts, with her experimental film Sea of Vapors (Meer Der Dünste, 2014). This peculiarly intense film is comprised of black-and-white archive footage, a pulsing light and a driving electronic score. I confess I don’t really understand how the footage in a 15-minute movie can be “cut to emulate the lunar cycle” as Schedlbauer describes it, but I do see that this is a chill, kinetic film. The POV is perpetually moving forward, our focus drawn to circular shapes (the rising sun, an eyeball, a coffee cup, even the moon itself) as the film clips spin and dissolve into each other. Riveting.\n\nTimothy Smith’s Béton Brut (2014) is a more earthly proposition, and a little taste of silent London. This starkly photographed short is an ode to the capital’s concrete jungle, capped with an approving quote from le Corbusier. A montage of images of the Southbank, the Barbican, the Balfron tower and so on, this film reveres the austerity of these brutalist behemoths and then uncovers the subtle beauties of their architecture. It’s very grand to look upon, and the soundtrack is skilfully done: white noise blends into a collage of found sounds: first roadworks, then birdsong, as the seemingly faceless buildings reveal their true grace and character.\n\nAnd the one that got away: Despite my best(ish) efforts, I didn’t get to see The Tribe (2014), which intrigued me so much. My bad, as not only did it get great reviews, it won the first feature prize. I will rectify this as soon as possible. Meanwhile, here’s something of what my esteemed colleague Peter Bradshaw had to say about it:\n\nThis is a grimly compelling, explicit and violent film which is also a silent movie … you have to hope to understand the general gist and the larger building blocks of narrative without picking up on the minutiae – which is, interestingly, how movie-makers broadly conceive of their work in its early stages … But the main question is: signing is a language like any other, so why not have subtitles? … The point, I think, is that their silence underscores their alienation from us. They are a different tribe: outside the law, below the salt … It is a bleak but simple picture – at times it looks like Slaboshpytskiy draws on Samuel Beckett or Peter Brook to create a universal language of anxiety. Read Peter Bradshaw’s full review for the Guardian here.\n\nLondon is the best city in the world for silent cinema. OK, so maybe I should admit to a little bias, but really, between the BFI Southbank, the Barbican, the London Film Festival, the Phoenix cinema in Finchley, and the capital’s many film societies, rep cinemas, arthouse cinemas, orchestras, concert halls and festivals (including the many visits of the British Silent Film Festival, the Fashion in Film Festival and the recently departed Birds Eye View Film Festival) we are sitting pretty for silents. Whether it’s a symptom or a cause I don’t know, but we also have many of the world’s best silent film accompanists based right here in the Big Smoke.\n\nIt’s in this context that in the summer of 2013, two of London’s fabulous silent film musicians, John Sweeney and Cyrus Gabrysch, set up a “silent speakeasy” called the Kennington Bioscope: “a silent cinematic event dedicated to the rediscovery of forgotten masterpieces”. Since then, they have been creating silent cinema magic in South London on a regular basis. The Bioscope is cinephilia at its best – if you’ve been, you’ll know what I mean. If you haven’t been, you are missing out, and I am about to make you jealous. I can’t let another Bioscope go by without telling you all how amazing it is.\n\nThe KB (as I have never yet heard one person call it) is held once every three weeks at the Cinema Museum – a volunteer-staffed Aladdin’s Cave of cinematic memorabilia and ephemera. There are more than a few reasons why you voted this place as your favourite silent film venue of 2014. It’s a wee bit like a time machine, whisking you back to a more sedate era of cinemagoing. There’s always an interval, ushers may well be wearing natty uniforms, someone will undoubtedly strike a gong to prompt patrons to take their seats, and the adverts before the screening will remind those assembled of the proper etiquette required. Tickets, which cost just £3, are made of cardboard and ripped off a reel. Most important of all, the projection booth is staffed by an expert projectionist, showing films of all shapes and sizes as often as possible.\n\nThe Cinema Museum has all the right credentials for a silent film venue. To begin with, all shows are presided over by Charles Chaplin himself – in the form of Anna Odrich’s imposing sculpture, which divides the screening area from the bar. Chaplin used to live in the museum, in fact: the building was once the Lambeth Workhouse, where he spent some of his childhood.\n\nWhile the Cinema Museum doesn’t have all the plush comforts of the multiplex, get there early enough and you can bagsy one of the vintage tip-up cinema seats, plus there’s a bar selling hot drinks, booze and snacks. On the best Bioscope nights, there’s home baking on offer too.\n\nBut what of the actual movies? Well, I told you that the Kennington Bioscope observes golden-age picture palace practice. A night at the Bioscope comprises a full programme: shorts, interval and a main feature. The films will not, by and large, be widely available on DVD or theatrical prints; they will, on the other hand, be introduced by experts who love them, and of course, there will be glorious live musical accompaniment.\n\nMy last three visits to the Bioscope have featured Stephen Horne introducing and playing for Fritz Lang’s Destiny (1921), Kevin Brownlow presenting Rex Ingram’s Mare Nostrum (1926) and Neil Brand sharing and accompanying Tol’able David (1921). And yes, I do feel spoiled – I have waited years to see some of these films. While that third evening is still fresh in my mind I can tell you that the shorts programme consisted of the mini City Symphony Manhatta (1921), Harry Langdon in Remember When? (1925), Felix the Cat at war in Felix Turns the Tide (1922), and a French film of indeterminate date that combined live action and stop-motion to tell a story about a thief’s enchanted, and sticky-fingered, gloves. How’s that for variety?\n\nOver the Bioscope’s run we have seen stars including Rin Tin Tin, Colleen Moore, Marion Davies, Max Linder and Florence Lawrence on the big screen, and a heartening variety of collectors, archivists and experts alongside it introducing the films. And increasingly, the houses are full – the Bioscope attracts the capital’s die-hard silent fans, but more besides.\n\nA word about the price of admission I mentioned earlier – no, it’s not a typo. Entrance to the Kennington Bioscope can be yours for a suggested donation of just £3. Two pounds goes towards the Museum’s overheads and £1 towards prints and permissions. Everything else (including the organisers, the projectionists, the musicians, the bar staff and ushers and the guest hosts) seems to run on pure passion. That’s more than a bargain, this whole undertaking is basically a gift – to you.\n\nLong may it run, and run – the Kennington Bioscope is a cherished addition to London’s silent film scene.\n\nThe next programmed Kennington Bioscope night is on 28 January 2015, when Kevin Brownlow will present Clarence Brown’s Smouldering Fires (1925), starring Pauline Frederick and Laura La Plante. More information here.\n\nGet it together, people! We’re only on day two of the festival and it seems a collective mania has already descended. Call it camaraderie, call it cinephilia, call it cabin fever, but there was a feverish mood on Friday, for sure. I won’t criticise something that I admit I was part of but we should all know that somewhere the ghost of Ivan Mosjoukine is raising an immaculately painted eyebrow in our direction. He’s judging us, but silently, of course.\n\nSo the residents of Leicester may have heard wicked cackles emanating from the Phoenix art centre on Friday morning, because there were laughs a-plenty to be had, for the right and wrong reasons both. Forgive me for taking the films out of sequence, but I would like to introduce you to the second film first.\n\nAs I took my seat for Not For Sale (1924) I was whispering under my breath “Please be good, please be good …” And it was. This film is an out-and-out joy, with a classically British delicacy in its sentiment, humour and satirical bite. Those good vibes I was sending out were partly due to sisterly pride: the script is by Lydia Hayward, who wrote the H Manning Haynes adaptations of WW Jacobs stories that have so delighted previous iterations of this festival. I suppose I wanted a little more proof that she was crucial to their success. And Not For Sale, which is adapted from a novel by author and journalist Monica Ewer, provided it. This is a charming comedy, with an elegant structure, strongly written characters, sharp dialogue and yes, even a skein of feminism woven into its fabric. Toff Ian Hunter is slumming it in a Bloomsbury boarding-house run by the kind-hearted Anne (Mary Odette), and they fall in love … gradually. But when he offers a proposal, sadly he shows he has not left his old world and its shoddy values behind him. The central couple are adorable, but it’s the supporting characters (Anne’s lodgers, her rascally little brother and her theatrical sister) who make this a real ensemble treat. Plus, we had beautiful piano accompaniment from John Sweeney, so we were feeling incredibly spoiled. It boils down to this: the plot is preposterous but the characters, by and large are not, and so it has a grace and a truth often absent in romcoms …\n\nOr romantic dramas, such as today’s opening act The Rocks of Valpré (1919), a Maurice Elvey directed adaptation of an Ethel M Dell novel. The plot, the characters and even the location (Torbay doubles for coastal France) were all preposterous here. I couldn’t really understand anyone’s motivation: it was all rash promises, damaging misconceptions, wild coincidences and needless noble sacrifices. Nice to see Basil Gill again, here playing a younger man: one with a “European reputation” who “has an intimate knowledge of men” and who still gets the girl at the end of the story. Certainly it’s pretty, but not enough to distract me from the flaws I am afraid. I chuckled, and I sighed. Fair play to Elvey – this is the only existing film from his Stoll period, when I am reliably informed he was “churning them out” out a rapid pace and the problems in the film do mostly stem from the source novel. Still, it’s enough to make one throw one’s violin off the terrace and fall into a swoon, it really is.\n\nWould Hitchcock ride to the rescue after lunch? Charles Barr was on hand to introduce us to two different films that the young Alfred Hitchcock had had a hand in: both directed by George Fitzmaurice, both from 1922, both from Famous Players-Lasky’s “Islington experiment”. First up, The Man From Home gave us a transatlantic clash of cultures when young American girl Anna Q Nilsson travels to Italy, falls in love with a dubious prince, and her beau from back home (Norman Kerry) rides into town to clear up the mess. The plot was more than a touch convoluted but the comedy was effective if broad, and cor, look at the scenery. We were directed by Barr to note the hand of Hitchcock in a sketch Kerry uses to order “ham and eggs” at a swanky hotel. M’colleague Henry K Miller ventures that the high-angled shots of European coastlines and hotel terraces recall the fun bits of Easy Virtue. You could stretch your hand out further and almost swipe at To Catch a Thief too. But this was mostly fun – undoubtedly enhanced by Günter Buchwald’s exquisite accompaniment on violin and piano, and also Neil Brand, who was reading out the English translations of the intertitles from the back of the room. Very pleased that Brand saw fit to “do the voices” – less pleased that he didn’t treat us to a rendition of My Old Kentucky Home when Nilsson sat down to the piano back in Kokomo.\n\nThree Live Ghosts is a live ghost itself. Thought to be lost and gone for years, but it was here all along, mislabelled in a Russian archive as a sound film. Hitchcock designed the intertitles for this film, but they are definitely missing. As was much of the plot, the setting and even the characters’ names. The trouble is that TLG had been radically re-edited for Russian release – with the story tangled, extra images almost certainly inserted and names, characters and incidents rebuilt via the intertitles and so on. What we saw was hugely entertaining, utterly bizarre, far away from what George Fitzmaurice etc intended and ever so slightly frustrating. If you wanted to look “through” the film to see the hand of Hitch, you would have to declare yourself ‘cock-blocked. There were layers upon layers of mystery here. We’ll have to wait and see whether anyone gets to the bottom of it\n\nThe two “Hitchcock” films were punctuated by a Swedish film, The Strongest/Den Stakraste (1929), which I confess I “sat out”, having seen it in Pordenone two years back. Reports came back that it had lost none of its power to enthral and shock. In fact, several people seemed to be traumatised by the violence. What sensitive animal-loving souls we are.\n\nTo the finale then, and the only mania here was that slight buzz you sense when the audience sits down for an epic show. Questions hang heavy in the air. Will we make it through? Will it prove worth the time put in? Was it wise to order that glass of Merlot? At just over two and a half hours, you might think that Michel Strogoff (1926) would have to rely on something more than just the pungent charisma of leading man Ivan Mosjoukine and his sexy beard. Hmmm … Well, there was far more to our tale than that, not least John Sweeney’s heroically dramatic accompaniment, but even the gruesome violence, sugar-shaded Pathécolor and general epic design could not hold a candle to the film’s smouldering hero. I was there for him and almost him alone. An intense and captivating close to the day’s play that I haven’t even begun to process at this late/early hour.\n\nMost appealing invitation of the day\n\nI would, of course, dearly like to join the crew from Not For Sale on a “jolly old low-brow bank holiday”. Wouldn’t you?\n\nScreening trend of the day\n\nSpoken intertitles. A selection of foreign prints led to members of the BSFF crew and coterie taking up duty as the “voice of god”. Who knew Ivan Mosjoukine sounded just like Michael Eaton?\n\nComic relief heroes of the day\n\nThe war correspondents stole the show in Michel Strogoff, for me at least. Harry Blount of the Daily Telegraph and his Parisian counterpart offered humorous interludes in a heavy-going drama, supported each other through thick and thin, and God knows, they filed plenty of copy. Models for us all!\n\nVisit the British Silent Film Festival website\n\nThe town was like a loaded gun, needing only a spark to set it off – Victor Hugo, Les Misérables\n\n“It’s the last time I shall say it, so I shall say it,” began David Robinson, introducing what is surely not his final Giornate, but the last over which he will preside as artistic director. The Robinson era will close with the 34th Giornate del Cinema Muto, which looks on paper at least as if it will be a very special festival, with a jewel-studded programme. And he hands the baton to the surest of hands: the marvellous Jay Weissberg of Variety, who joined him on stage tonight by way of introduction, and performed as Robinson’s personal interpreter too. We said another goodbye on Saturday evening – this festival will be dedicated to the memory of one of its staunchest supporters, Jean Darling, who passed away in early September. A snippet of her singing Always at a previous festival began our gala evening, as Robinson took to the stage to say… what was it? Ah yes. “Welcome home!”\n\nBut before we get to the gala, and the speeches and the changing of the guard, we have a full afternoon of films to catch up on. Fasten your seatbelts, fellow Pordenauts*, we’re going on a journey.\n\nOur world tour began with trip to Berlin – this was not classic Symphony of a City territory mind, but a visit to Gypsy Berlin – from the camp to the racetrack to the streets. Terrifying to think what lay in store for the people featured in this film, Grossstadt-Zigeuner (1932), but it was a true gem, directed by the Constructivist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy with great verve and edited with playful intricacy. Despite its many stylistic flourishes, it’s a warm, humane portrait, and served as an excellent introduction to the main feature in this afternoon’s bill from the Other City Symphonies strand. The longer film was a document of Chicago, made by a German film-maker Heinrich Hauser in 1931. Weltstadt in Flegeljahren. Ein Bericht uber Chicago (A World City in its Teens. A Report of Chicago) carried itself at an unexpectedly relaxed pace, puttering up the Mississippi on a paddle steamer for the longest time before reaching the metropolis, and even then, we moved slowly, until the film suddenly discovered the residents of the city. It was heartbreaking to see the poverty caused by the Great Depression, etched in the faces of men being turned away from labour exchanges. When workers unloading banana boats at the dock empty the rotten fruit into the river, another group of men in row boats appear to scoop them out of the water. Elsewhere in the city, too, on the south side in the streets largely populated by African Americans, on the lake beach bursting with sun worshippers, Chicago was defined by its people, not its towering skyscrapers. Hats off too to Philip Carli, for fantastic piano accompaniment for both films.\n\nNext to Norway, for a flying visit, where we caught a luridly hand-painted tiger-taming short, in which the tamer’s hot pink shirt outshone the ferocious furries in the cage with him. And this morsel was to amuse our bouches for the first entry in the Russian Laughter strand, Nelzia li Bez Menia? (Vkusnoty) or Can’t You Just Leave Me out of This? (Delicious Meals) (1932). Opinion was divided on this one, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. This laugh-heavy Soviet propaganda comedy was, bizarrely, intended to promote the use of public canteens. Our hero is a discontented hubby, who hates cooking and tries out the canteen as an easy option. It’s completely disgusting, though he daren’t admit that to his wife. Thanks to some public-spirited activists and a newspaper campaign, however, the canteens are much improved – and when wifey fancies a change from her fella’s cooking they return to the scene of the food crime. It’s a weak joke in the finale: “Doesn’t hubby feel a fool that the food is so good, and the canteen so hygienic!” But the lead performance from Sergei Poliakov carries the show and the whole piece is a real delight. A delicious broth you might say, to tickle our tastebuds for the Italian beefcake to follow.\n\nForgive me for being crude, but how else to describe a strand called Italian muscle in Germany? Of the two famous strong men Carlo Aldini and Luciano Albertini it was Albertini’s turn to star today, in a confection called Mister Radio (1924). This German film was hugely watchable but skated perilously close to being utter tripe. What saved it from its ridiculous, threadbare plot and wooden acting were the imagination-defying stunts performed by our leading man. He leaped, he bounded, he dangled upside-down and carried four people at once on a single rope. The audience quite forgot itself and made an obscene amount of noise – gasping, laughing, gasping again. Impossible to resist doing so. It was exactly what, as John Sweeney pointed out afterwards, people who don’t watch silent films expect from a silent film. And although the plot was barely there, still Albertini ended up with the brunette with a past who really loved him, not the blonde ingenue with the terrible father, so … All’s well that ends well, as Shakespeare would say.\n\nWhich brings me to the gala evening. Two films tonight: one I simply adored and another that impressed rather than charmed me. Also, my eyelids were beginning to flutter. I had an early flight! And not enough coffee, certainly. First things first, Ernst Lubitsch and William Shakespeare seem to me a marriage made in heaven, and the director’s cheeky twist on Shakespeare’s tragedy of star-crossed lovers, Romeo und Julia im Schnee (1920) was a real tonic. This adaptation has only the scantest resemblance to the play and is in fact a mischievous rustic love story all of its own devising. I loved the fact that a legal dispute between the warring families came down to the weight of the sausages they sent to bribe the judge, and who could resist an apothecary who sells a young couple sugar water instead of poison and says they can pay the bill another time? All this, and Antonio Coppola’s deft original score, performed beautifully by a small orchestra.\n\nThe main feature of the evening, Maciste Alpino (1916) took us to the heart of the first world war, and the fighting in the Alps between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces. But this is an adventure comedy, not a real war flick, and while the scenery was monumental (a nod to the hand of Giovanni Pastrone), the tone was mostly light. Maciste is a handsome, heroic ogre, all superhuman strength and faultless patriotism, who could probably see off an entire army single-handedly. In one scene, he finds himself unarmed in a swordfight, so uses smoking firetongs instead. Why not? And he breaks his opponent’s sword, so … His almighty abilities did slacken the tension somewhat, I must admit. There were times also when I felt that the comedy was rather too gentle for the subject matter. But these are quibbles really – we saw a stunningly crisp restored print of a gorgeous film, with fantastic accompaniment from Philip Carli, Guenter Buchwald and Frank Bockius. Not the type of film one is likely to come across too often, and presented in the most immaculate way – that’s what we come to Pordenone for, after all.\n\nIntertitle in-joke of the day\n\nIn the Chicago film, a shot of cattle ready for market was followed by the intertitle “The way of all flesh” – but that’s not on until next Saturday!\n\nHot topic of the day\n\nBeyond the big news about Jay Weissberg taking over the reins next year, a delegate’s mind is liable to turn to material matters. The tote bag. Is it really, as it looks, made of paper? We hope not. Will it survive a rain shower? There is only one way to find out … the forecast for Sunday is not good.\n\nCasual animal cruelty of the day\n\nIt has to be the little boy in the Russian film attempting to saw the tail off the family cat. Yikes.\n\nFor more information on all of these films, the Giornate catalogue is available online here.\n\n* Hat-tip to Nicky Smith for “Pordenauts”\n\nThwack! Did you hear that? It’s the sound of the latest Hippfest programme landing on the digital doormat. I’m a big fan of Hippfest, a welcoming event, with an ambitious, highly entertaining, lineup of screenings and a frankly beautiful venue. If I could, I’d turn the Scottish thermostat up a couple of notches next month, because this southern softie will be back in Bo’ness for the festival, which runs from 22-26 March 2017, and takes place mostly in the town’s gorgeous vintage cinema, the Hippodrome.\n\nAs the schedule is announced today, that means the tickets are on sale already, and if something here catches your eye, book as soon as you can – Hippfest screenings can, and very often do, sell out.\n\nSo what’s on offer this year? The first day is devoted to female film pioneers, a subject close to my own heart: with a talk from film expert Ellen Cheshire, and an evening screening of Nell Shipman’s The Grub Stake (1923), with a brand new score from Jane Gardner and an introduction by yours truly. Read more about the amazing Nell Shipman here.\n\nThursday afternoon brings a Chinese double-bill – a lecture on the women of Chinese silent cinema by Professor Paul Pickowicz, and a screening of the BFI’s revelatory archive compilation Around China with a Movie Camera, introduced by composer Ruth Chan. On that subject, watch out for the Saturday afternoon screening of an unmissable Chinese silent, The Goddess (1934) starring Ruan Lingyu as a mother in a terrible predicament, with music by John Sweeney.\n\nThursday evening brings a screening of one of my favourite, and most unusual, modern silents: Together (1956) directed by Lorenza Mazzetti. It stars artist Eduardo Paolozzi (of TCR tiles fame) and Michael Andrews as deaf-without-speech dockers in London’s East End (the location-spotting alone is a treat for readers of this site). This brilliant film will be accompanied by a new score from Raymond MacDonald and Christian Ferlaino, which promises to be “a dynamic alternative reinterpretation of Mazzetti’s ground-breaking work”. There will be an introduction and a Q&A and the event will be supported by BSL interpretation and electronic note-taking.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, don’t miss Geoff Brown’s talk The Last Silent Picture Show, about the coming of sound to Britain, which will be illustrated by clips and is bound to be wonderful.\n\nBut Friday night belongs to Marion Davies, at her comic best along with Marie Dressler in The Patsy (1928), the sublimely funny film that is this year’s Hippfest gala. The Patsy famously features Davies’s brilliant impersonation of her fellow silent stars, a gag that is sure to play well among the Hippfest cognoscenti. Dressing up is encouraged (of course) and music will be provided by The Sprockets, playing an excellent (I heard it at Pordenone) score by the wonderful Maud Nelissen.\n\nSaturday brings The Goddess and more: a “jeely jar” double-bill of What’s the World Coming To? and The High Sign with Neil Brand on the keys; and eerie Expressionism courtesy of The Hands of Orlac (1924), starring Conrad Veidt and accompanied by Günter Buchwald and Frank Bockius. Over at the town’s steam railway station (told you this place was fab) Neil Brand presents an evening train-themed double-bill comprising a thrill-packed episode of The Hazards of Helen and the wonderful Teddy at the Throttle starring Gloria Swanson.\n\nBack in the Hippodrome, the Saturday night gala is Lev Kuleshov’s Soviet Western (yes, really) By the Law (1926), with a brand-new Hippfest-commissioned score by RM Hubbert, AKA Hubby. I haven’t seen this one before but it sounds outstanding, an adaptation of a Jack London novel about three gold prospectors facing danger, and difficult moral choices. If that has you all shook up, it must be time to let your hair down with The Sprockets at the Hippfest Speakeasy …\n\nSunday, the final day of the festival, dawns with a chance for local high-school students to drown out your Speakeasy hangover with their New Found Sound score to a programme of Scottish silents. After lunch, a chance to see the BFI’s latest flagship silent restoration, Arthur Robison’s stylish Irish underworld thriller The Informer (1929), accompanied here by Stephen Horne and Günter Buchwald. You also have a late afternoon appointment with Messrs Laurel and Hardy as John Sweeney accompanies three of the boys’ best films, including, yes, the restored The Battle of the Century.\n\nThen, for its closing-night trick, Hippfest will whisk you away to Chicago, for Cecil B DeMille’s brilliant, frequently hilarious Jazz-Age crime movie of the same name. I can’t recommend this film enough – for the courtroom scene alone, which is a classic of the genre. It’s bound to send you dancing like Roxie Hart out into the streets of Bo’ness afterwards, especially as Stephen Horne and Frank Bockius will be providing the music.\n\nAnother great lineup, I think you’ll agree. I’ll leave you with a few words from the festival’s director Alison Strauss:\n\n“At HippFest we are all about making cinema special – engaging the best musicians to accompany rarely screened titles, presenting those films in beautiful and atmospheric settings, seeking out the best restorations from the world’s archives, and generating an atmosphere of inclusion and fun with our audience.”\n\nSounds good? Read more and book your tickets here. I’ll see you there!\n\nDon’t forget to donate here and help the Hippodrome buy a piano"
