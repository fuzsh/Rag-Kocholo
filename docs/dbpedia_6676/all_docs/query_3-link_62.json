Korda intended Charles Laughton to play the role of \"Percy.\" Shooting began in Sep 1934, under the direction of Rowland Brown, who was replaced after a few days by producer Korda before Harold Young was assigned to take over direction. Modern sources add to the cast Roy Meredith (Viscount de Tournay), Billy Shine (An aristocrat), Brember Wills (Doman), Kenneth Kove ('Codlin,' a fisherman), Renee Macredy (Lady Q), Philip Strange, Carl Harbord, Philip Desborough, Hugh Dempster, Peter Evan Thomas, Derrick De Marney (Members of the Pimpernel League), Harry Terry ('Renad'), Douglas Stewart ('Merieres'), Arthur Hambling (Captain of the Guard) and credit Bernard Browne as assistant photographer.\n\nIn 1941, Leslie Howard starred, produced and directed an updated version of The Scarlet Pimpernel, entitled Mr. V, but released in the U.S. as Pimpernel Smith. Korda later oversaw two other films of The Scarlet Pimpernel, a sequel, The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel in 1938 with Barry K. Barnes and directed by Hans Schwartz (see above), and The Elusive Pimpernel in 1950, starring David Niven and directed by Michael Powell, who had wanted to make it into a musical.\n\nOther film versions of The Scarlet Pimpernel include a 1917 Fox picture starring Dustin Farnum and directed by Richard Stanton (see AFI Catalog of Feature Films, 1911-20), and its sequel, The Elusive Pimpernel, a 1919 British production by Stoll Pictures, directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Cecil Humphreys. A 1928 British and Dominions production starring Matheson Lang and directed by T. Hayes Hunter was entitled alternately The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Scarlet Daredevil and The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Television versions have included a 1955-56 British series, The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel, staring Marius Goring; a 1960 CBS telefeature on Family Classics titled The Scarlet Pimpernel, starring Michael Rennie and Maureen O'Hara; Battle of Wits, a 1973 British Anglia production for Great Mysteries, with Ian Bannen and Brewster Mason; and a 1982 CBS production The Scarlet Pimpernel, directed by Clive Donner and starring Anthony Andrews.\n\nLess\n\nIn 1792, the Prince of Wales reviews his palace guards.

Upon his arrival in England, Chauvelin offers Marguerite her brother's life if she assists in the capture of the Pimpernel. Meanwhile, Percy and Armand meet to discuss their future actions, and Armand questions Percy about his estrangement from his wife. Percy tells Armand that Marguerite testified against the Marquis de St. Cyr, the first aristocrat sent to the guillotine, and though he still loves her, he cannot forgive her this action. At the Granville Ball that night, Marguerite feigns illness to acquire a note from Sir Andrew ffoulkes, one of Percy's associates, which states that the Pimpernel will be in the library at midnight. With the note in his possession, Chauvelin goes to the library, only to find the sleeping Percy. Disgusted, Chauvelin then sits down and falls asleep himself, only to awaken and find a note from the Pimpernel. Though he suspects the still-sleeping Percy, Chauvelin cannot believe that such a foppish man is the hero he seeks. Later on, Marguerite tells Percy of her betrayal of the Pimpernel to Chauvelin. When Percy questions her on her denouncement of St. Cyr, Marguerite tells him that St. Cyr had unjustly sent her to prison because his son had fallen in love with her, and that she would have died there if she had not been freed by the Revolution. While Percy can finally understand his wife's actions and the two become close once more, he still does not disclose to her his secret identity. That evening, Marguerite looks up at a family portrait, only to realize that the mark of the Pimpernel is part of the family crest. She rushes to ffoulkes, who tells her that Percy has already sailed for France in an attempt to rescue both her brother and the Count de Tournay. Meanwhile, Chauvelin learns from a French prison guard that Percy has already freed Armand and de Tournay, and that his band plans to meet at the Brogard's Inn before sailing for England. Marguerite arrives at the inn before Percy, only to be captured by Chauvelin, who is there disguised as a priest. Percy arrives at the inn, and though he avoids Chauvelin's initial trap, he is forced to surrender to the French ambassador when he learns of Marguerite's plight. After saying goodbye to Marguerite, Percy is led off to face a firing squad. Chauvelin's exultation at the sounds of rifle shots is short-lived, however, as Percy returns to the inn unharmed, only to tell Chauvelin that the French soldiers were actually his men in disguise. Leaving the outwitted Chauvelin behind, Percy and Marguerite sail back to England, and Percy reminds his wife that she will never be free as long as he is alive, which will be a very long time.\n\nLess"
