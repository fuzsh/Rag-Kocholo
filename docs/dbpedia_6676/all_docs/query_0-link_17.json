        "text": "Editor's Week 2006\n\nDecember 29 - 2006\n\nThe wonderful circus scene in Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942) exists in a considerably longer version in the script dated October 30, 1941. From what I've heard, probably many of the key lines in this scene are Dorothy Parker's, though the script as a whole is attributed to Peter Viertel and Joan Harrison. My guess is that the scene was cut for reasons of running-time. A pity. Some of its substance and irony have gone missing. For example, a couple of the members of the circus troupe - and its most humane members - have every reason to dislike the police. 'Bones', aka the Thin Man, apparently got the idea for his present job after he went on a hunger strike at Alcatraz! And Lily, aka the Fat Lady, apparently had both a sister and a brother who 'went wrong' and who got into trouble with the police at an early age. (So she is instinctively sympathetic to the plight of the fugitives Barry and Pat.) Also, although the Thin Man's memorable line about 'normal' people being 'normally cold-hearted' is, of course, in the film, originally it was even more forceful: 'It's shocking to find how egocentric the world really is. How little it cares for the other fellow's troubles. Even freaks are normal in that respect.' 'Bones' is here trying to raise sympathy for Barry and Pat, but is almost defeated by the hostility of The Midget (ironically called 'Major') and by the opposing views (on everything, it seems!) of the Siamese Twins. Even the tender-hearted Esmeralda, aka the Bearded Lady, who appears to be the Thin Man's partner, has trouble making up her mind. But the Thin Man's summing up was always this: 'In this situation I find a parallel for the present world predicament. We stand defeated at the outset. You, Esmeralda, have sympathy, yet you are willing to remain passive and let the inevitable happen. I have a belief, yet I am tempted to let myself be overridden by force. The rest of you - with the exception of this malignant jerk here [The Midget], are ignorant of the facts and, therefore, confused. ...' At least two things typify Hitchcock about this moment. Obviously, the representative cross-section of humanity is one of them: cf similar 'cross-sections' in Lifeboat, Rear Window, Torn Curtain (the bus scene), etc. (I shan't attempt to include the 'cross-section' of history represented by the felled Sequoia in Vertigo, though it's tempting to do so.) But another matter, not quite as obvious, is how Hitchcock has managed to get away with a less than 'politically correct' slant in this scene - namely, his making fun of freaks, especially The Midget - precisely by using the world's political situation as an 'excuse'. 'Bones' labels The Midget 'Fascist', and quickly bundles him out of sight as the police turn up looking for Barry and Pat. 'Bones' justifies himself thus: 'In an emergency the minority must suffer - an historical precedent. Grab him, Esmeralda!' (That's in the script dated October 30, 1941.) A possible inspiration for this scene may the moment in John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath (1940) when several brave men from one of the roadside labour camps take it on themselves to dish out peremptory 'justice' on a group of hired trouble-makers. In both scenes, the entire emotive weight is with the non-pc people, which perhaps only goes to show that both Ford and Hitchcock knew a thing or two, beyond what the textbooks might say, about how to make democracy work. Finally, here are a couple of things not in the script dated October 30, 1941, but in the scene as filmed. (Presumably, they represent late amendments by Dorothy Parker.) First, when a suspicious policeman shines a torch on Pat and asks who she is, in the original script it is Esmeralda who yawns nearby and thus distracts the police, who feel guilty at waking everybody up. (Cf in Torn Curtain the distraction of someone lighting a cigarette as the military police approach the back of the bus where Michael and Sarah are trying not to be spotted.) Calling Pat a snake charmer is not in the early script. Second, Pat's remark in the film about why she elects to stay with Barry - 'It's a free country, isn't it?' - appears to represent another late addition. At least two cheers for Mr Hitchcock's (and his scriptwriters') take on democracy, then!\n\nDecember 16 - 2006\n\n(revised) I'm saying that in Vertigo, all around, on every side, is a vastness, associated with mystery and with the Oedipal aspect of the voyage of life. (Not for nothing is the bookshop in Vertigo called 'The Argosy', which may suggest just a merchant ship of that type but is also redolent of Jason's legendary ship 'Argo' in which he and his 'Argonauts' searched for the Golden Fleece; and also of the mythical giant Argus, said to have a hundred eyes! So: a vastness associated with looking and questing, with ships and the sea.) Associated, too - the Oedipal aspect - with an endless male-female search for wholeness, not always a peaceful search (hence the perennial 'battle of the sexes'). And, speaking of 'on every side', there are also literal ups and downs (heights and depths), associated, respectively, with life and hope and with death and annihilation. Again there are male-versus-female associations. If Camille Paglia is right, Western culture has traditionally been Apollonian and sky-oriented and male-dominated, whereas the neglected (by the West) realm of 'the chthonian' is associated with 'subterranean force' and 'murk' and ooze' - female attributes! (Cf Julia Kristeva's notion of 'the abject'.) True, Goethe's realm of 'the Mothers' isn't located underground, exactly, but rather 'beyond space and time'. Nonetheless, it is incontrovertible that Paglia wrote (as I quoted last time): 'The Mothers appear in Faust when the hero tries to materialize the spirit of Helen [Goethe's Eternal Feminine figure]. Adult love is overshadowed by maternal claims to priority. The male struggles through his sexual stages, returning to the mother even when he thinks himself most free of her.' To me, this could be describing what happens in Vertigo. I'll come to the end of that film - where the sinister-seeming nun, or mother-superior, surely represents what Paglia calls the Great Mother - in a moment. But first, a note on what psychologists, mystics, etc., call the 'oceanic feeling'. This was famously evoked in correspondence between Freud and the French writer Romain Rolland to refer to the feeling of being at one with the universe, a feeling which causes (in Rolland's words) 'a sensation of \"eternity\", a feeling as of something limitless, unbounded - as it were, \"oceanic\"'. Sadly, Freud said that he could find no trace of such a feeling in himself and attributed it to 'a regression to an earlier state: that of the infant at the breast'. He wasn't impressed with Rolland's claim that the oceanic feeling is the source of religious sentiments. Perhaps missing the point, he claimed that man's need for religion originated with the infant's sense of helplessness, saying, 'I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.' Certainly, Anthony Storr, in his book 'The School of Genius' (1988), takes issue with Freud's position, calling it 'less than satisfactory'. He points out that those who have experienced the states of mind recorded by, for example, Admiral Byrd and William James, 'record them as ... being the profoundest moments of their existence. This is true both of those who have felt the sense of unity with the universe and of those who have felt the sense of unity with a beloved person.' (p. 38) Triggers for these experiences can be of many kinds: for example, nature, art, religion, sexual love, certain forms of exercise, solitude, silence. (p. 188) Enough said. I think that the oceanic feeling is powerfully evoked in Vertigo, and is part of the film's Lost Paradise imagery, associated with the wounded, even impotent, Scottie's quest to overcome his 'weakness'. The 'motherly' Midge calls him 'a big boy now' and watches concernedly as he attempts to assert his masculinity, to emulate the father (even God). In this, he differs only in degree from, say, Guy in Strangers on a Train who at one point pauses beneath those printed lines from Kipling: 'If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster/ .../You'll be a man, my son.' Sadly, then, in trying to 'materialize' Madeleine, his Helen of Troy, in Judy, Scottie is only emulating Faust in Goethe's drama - and fated to the same disappointment. (Whether God will intervene to save him from damnation is, of course, left up in the air, so to speak.) I do see the 'mother-superior' who rises up so terrifyingly at the end that she causes Judy/Madeleine to elude Scottie's grasp and fall to her death, as the Great Mother. A comic precedent had been the spectre of Mrs Stevens coming to live with daughter and son-in-law (Francie and John) at the end of To Catch a Thief; a sombre echo of the mother-principle defeating the son-figure is, of course, the end of Psycho.\n\nDecember 15 - 2006\n\nSpeaking of netherworlds (see December 8, above), let's come back to Vertigo. How to convey what the Sequoia forest scene, with its sombre greens and blacks but also russets and late-afternoon sunlight, stands for? Apart, that is, from just the life/death 'force' that is the very subject of Vertigo, and which I call Will (after Schopenhauer)? The scene is based on a passing reference in Chapter Four of the Boileau and Narcejac novel. One of its antecedents/analogues in Hitchcock is the deserted mill in The Manxman (1928); another is the deserted art gallery in Torn Curtain (1966) - and there are several others (including the Tunnel of Love, with its water-wheel, in Strangers on a Train, as seen above). So, to repeat, what does the scene represent? For a start, it feels like the literal heart of the film (the latter conceived as a body flowing with life), yet something which people hardly give a thought to as they perform their daily business. (Note: in Torn Curtain the art gallery, which is likewise almost empty, invokes nothing less than the whole Graeco-Roman heritage of Western civilisation.) But equally, the scene is a womb-image, like the red-walled Ernie's Restaurant scene analysed here already (e.g., on December 1, above). At the end of the forest scene, Scottie and 'Madeleine' will emerge into the sunlight - one of the film's many moments of 're-birthing'. It is followed immediately by a scene that begins by featuring a different kind of tree, i.e., not a Sequoia, but a single wind-blasted Monterey pine on a clifftop, a scene in which 'Madeleine' appears to think of commiting suicide - all of which alludes to the 1944 'ghost' film The Uninvited, in which the Gail Russell character seems set on committing suicide as her mother had done before her. The image of the sea here isn't fortuitous: the film is full of such imagery, invoking what Freud called the 'oceanic feeling' of mystical significance (though he himself could make little of it). Beyond that again, the sea provides another life/death image: in The Uninvited, there is actually a line, 'The sea is a place of life and death and eternity, too.' And with its literal fluidity, the sea, too, is a womb-image to match the others. Now a further word about 'Madeleine'. She represents what Goethe and then Jung called the Eternal Feminine and, as such, is rather more an unattainable mother-ideal than she is a lover-figure. Significantly, Scottie never makes love to 'Madeleine' but only to Judy whom, though, he attempts (successfully) to make over into 'Madeleine' - and then promptly loses. It is said that many - all? - men seek a partner who resembles their mother. (Something of this is in Hitchcock's early film The Lodger where, though, the dead mother's image is also the dead sister's, and the Ivor Novello character is arguably incapable of consumating love for the blonde look-alikes of his mother/sister and so has to kill them instead: another anticipation of Psycho, the ultimate Hitchcock film about the all-powerful, all-forbidding Mother - or Great Mother in Camille Paglia's archetype. Read on.) Now, I've little space left in which to invoke Camille Paglia's notion of 'the chthonian' (or 'the chthonic'), but which the forest scene in Vertigo seems to me to approach in its evocative power. So I'll just note this. Western culture, writes Paglia in her book 'Sexual Personae' (1990), has always been pre-occupied with the Apollonian, with the intellect, with 'sky-culture', at the expense of attending to 'the chthonian, which means \"of the earth\" - but earth's bowels, not its surface'. Paglia continues: 'Jane Harrison uses the term for pre-Olympian Greek religion, and I adopt it as a substitute for Dionysian, which has become contaminated with vulgar pleasantries. The Dionysian is no picnic. It is the chthonian realities which Apollo evades, the blind grinding of subterranean force, the long slow suck, the murk and ooze.' Paglia calls it 'the west's dirty secret'. (I'm reminded by all of this of Psycho's 'faecal' swamp ...) Later, in a chapter called \"Goethe to Gothic\", she appears to associate it, if not with the womb, at any rate with the realm of 'the Mothers' in 'Faust', Part Two. In that place, in 'an eerie netherworld beyond space and time' - constituting 'the omphalos [navel] of the universe, a female heart of darkness' - reside the play's 'most imposing androgynes', i.e., 'the Mothers'. These 'blind goddesses ... are Greek Fates combined with Plato's eternal forms'. And Paglia notes: 'The Mothers appear in Faust when the hero tries to materialize the spirit of Helen [Goethe's Eternal Feminine figure]. Adult love is overshadowed by maternal claims to priority. The male struggles through his sexual stages, returning to the mother even when he thinks himself most free of her.' It was these last three sentences that I applied to the final scene of Vertigo in my book on Hitchcock. Next time: I'll spell out the implications.\n\nDecember 8 - 2006\n\nI was going to immediately add one more entry on Vertigo, but shall defer it. I was going to talk about the 'chthonic', i.e., netherworld, apect of the film, linked to the pernicious effect of 'mothers' on male ambition, with acknowledgement to Camille Paglia's brilliant book 'Sexual Personae'. But during the week I corresponded with Michael Walker about Strangers on a Train - which, incidentally, is another of Hitchcock's films with 'chthonic' references (see frame-capture below) - and the sexual symbolism of the first funfair scene. All that water, for one thing! It was surely in Hitchcock's mind when, nearly twenty years later, he was planning another film about a psychopathic murderer, Kaleidoscope, which would have had its character living beside a harbour and strangling a woman near a waterfall. Also, I suggested to Michael that the 'Magic Isle' in Strangers (where Bruno strangles Miriam) is a 'Lost Paradise' symbol, one of whose extensions of sexual association is the bedroom. Accordingly, when the murder is seen reflected in a lens of Miriam's glasses (discussed here last week), it looks as if Bruno is finally giving the flirtateous young woman her wish, i.e., gently putting her to bed. (The image is also suitably watery-looking and dark, suggesting drowning or the grave.) I then checked in the novel by Patricia Highsmith (Chapter 12) and found that an incredible amount of the funfair sequence has its origin there (though not, directly, the Tunnel of Love episode). Here are some quotes from the novel, with brief comments. (1) 'Now, on the train to Metcalf, he [Charley Bruno] had direction. He had not felt so alive, so real and like other people since he had gone to ... Quebec, full of castles [as a child with his mother and father] ... because his paternal grandmother had been dying ...' That's from the end of Chapter 11. Brilliant, isn't it? Also, was it what clinched Hitchcock's decision to set his next film, I Confess, in Quebec? (2) '... He was taking it easy, not getting excited. The merry-go-round played \"Casey would waltz with the strawberry blonde ...\" Grinning, he turned to Miriam's red hair, and their eyes met ...' Ah! That's the significance of the tune heard in the film! (3) 'Miriam and her friends entered a big lighted section where the bottom of the ferris wheel was and a lot of concessions and sideshows. ... There was a clang and a roar as someone sent the red arrow all the way to the top with a sledge-hammer. He wouldn't mind killing Miriam with a sledge-hammer, he thought. ...' Hmm, the ferociously set mind of the psychopath! (Cf the scene in the film where Bruno intently watches Guy play tennis.) The sexual symbolism of the red arrow shooting upwards isn't in the film, but the general idea comes across all right. And there is other phallic imagery (e.g., Miriam's ice-cream cone). (4) '... Under the bright lights, he saw that Miriam was covered with freckles. She looked increasingly loathsome, so he began not to want to put his hands on her soft sticky-warm flesh. Well, he still had the knife. A clean instrument.' Prolepses of Psycho here (I shan't spell them out) and a definite hint that Bruno is gay. (5) 'They were taking a rowboat. The prospect of a cool row was delightful to Bruno. He engaged a boat, too. The lake looked big and black ...' Bruno is indeed a cool customer, and all the more charming for having these inner resources of his (an ability to enjoy himself; his knowledge of rowing - like Melanie's in The Birds!). Blackness is being emphasised - Bruno's colour in the film - for Miriam's death is fast approaching. (6) 'He waited until they had paddled past, then followed leisurely. A black mass drew closer, pricked here and there with the spark of a match. The island. It looked like a neckers' paradise. Maybe Miriam would be at it again tonight, Bruno thought, giggling. ...' There you are - the island as (an ironic) 'paradise'! And trust Bruno to giggle - though that's not something Robert Walker's non-effeminate performance allows into the film. (7) 'His hands captured her throat ..., stifling its abortive lift of surprise. He shook her. His body seemed to harden like rock, and he heard his teeth crack. ... With a leg behind her, he wrenched her backward, and they fell to the ground together with no sound but of a brush of leaves. ...' And so to bed! Aroused, but in silence, and softly! Now, Hitchcock's film certainly took a lot from Highsmith's novel. But it wasn't all a one-way thing. I noticed, for example, the following. In Chapter 1, Bruno plunges out his cigarette in a pat of butter (harking back to Mrs Van Hopper and her jar of cold cream in Rebecca). In Chapter 2, Bruno asks Guy to choose a story: 'Which do you want, the busted light socket in the bathroom or the carbon monoxide garage?' (No prizes for knowing which Hitchcock film that latter is citing!)\n\nDecember 1 - 2006\n\nI suggested last time that the red walls of Ernie's Restaurant imply both life and death, harking back to the opening scene on a rooftop. Of course, the action of falling off a roof is an ambiguous act in itself - an image of death, obviously, but also, in terms of dream imagery, of birth. Scottie was already a 'failure' when, in one reading, he fell from the rooftop at the start of the film. (He had hoped to become Chief of Police but somehow significant promotion had eluded him.) Not surprisingly, then, the film has several moments of 're-birthing', all of them connected with Scottie's 'dream woman', Madeleine. The first is the very image we discussed last time, in which 'Madeleine' emerges from the dining room at Ernie's and pauses beside an image of a baby and a newly-blooming rose. Her emerald wrap - the colour of the ocean - is apt. Another image of 're-birthing' will occur when Scottie rescues 'Madeleine' from San Francisco Bay. Another will be when the made-over (by Scottie) Judy emerges, as Madeleine, from her bathroom at the Empire Hotel into the same emerald-green light, now redolent of mist and ghosts. So, coming back to Ernie's Restaurant, there's a sense that its red walls are womb-like. But Hitchcock is not finished. The sequence effectively began in long-shot as the camera panned from Scottie to discover 'Madeleine' dining with Gavin; it will climax with 'Madeleine' alone in close-up (see frame-capture below), then end on a dying fall as 'Madeleine' and Gavin exit past a full-length mirror that emphasises Scottie's sense of already losing this mysterious, beautiful woman. (The pay-off to this moment, and several echoes of it, will be Scottie's line later, 'I do have you now, don't I?') How artful this whole sequence is, and the close-up profile-shot of 'Madeleine' in particular! In Strangers on a Train (1951), in the initial funfair sequence, Hitchcock had employed a succession of small climaxes (e.g., a woman screaming in a river-cave) to ready the audience for the eventual big climax, the strangling of Miriam, seen reflected in a lens of her glasses that had been knocked to the ground. That sequence was essentially a suspense sequence. The climactic moment was lent additional impact by the exaggeration of the effect, by the sense that the inner meaning of the moment called for just this distortion from an everyday way-of-seeing. (Cf, say, the initial kiss in Rear Window, an effect achieved with a form of step-printing.) But the sequence in Vertigo is, rather, a more purely aesthetic one, though the technique has scarcely changed. The first climax had occurred when the camera in long-shot discovered the bare-backed 'Madeleine' dining with Gavin. The second occurs when 'Madeleine' pauses by the picture and the rose, and we can briefly savour her fine bosom and all of the beauty surrounding it - not least the rose which emblemises that beauty (as Madeleine herself emblemises beauty and 'life'). But the moment is fleeting. The final climax is our, and Scottie's, tantalising reward. In this glorious profile-shot 'Madeleine' is now seemingly only inches away from us, and her lips are poised, waiting. The music climaxes. Hitchcock daringly brings up the light on the red wall - a deliberate exaggeration that is perfectly right - and it is as if the rose we had just seen is now blooming at its very height. (What a pity second-unit director Herbert Coleman used the wrong lens for the supposedly matching shot that follows, after the cut-away to Scottie. There is a momentary jarring. I suspect that Hitchcock never fully forgave 'Herbie' for that!)\n\nNovember 24 - 2006\n\nWe discussed the moment from Vertigo shown below, in which 'Madeleine Elster' pauses in the lobby of Ernie's Restaurant, on our Yahoo group recently. Beside her is a trompe l'oeil painting showing a child - but which, from a slightly different angle, shows the child grown into a woman, and, from a different angle again, the child become an aged, wizened crone! (This information was provided by group member 'Charley' - whom I thank.) Let's notice a few other things about the moment. It is essentially a subjective shot from inside Scottie's consciousness, as he watches (is aware of) Madeleine from the Ernie's bar. The image is full of upright, vertical objects, including the door jambs in the foreground and background, the painting in its frame, and, below it, a single slender rose in a tall vase. Not entirely accidental is the fact that the door jambs are made of wood - redwood, which will figure in several other key scenes - nor the fact that the walls themselves are a rich red, almost a blood red, thus doubly signifying 'life' (which is part of the very subject of Vertigo, where, however, it is never separable from 'death', something I'll come back to). Now notice the scene's several pendant objects: the emerald below Madeleine's neck, the crystal chandelier, the picture. Pendant objects are something else that recur throughout the film, and, like the vertical objects, each time subliminally remind us of the film's title and the moment at the start when Scottie hung suspended from a rooftop (while we, the audience watched in a suspense of our own ...). The actual colour-scheme of the moment shown here has its further subtleties, not least the general artificiality of it: remove Madeleine from the shot and the effect is stark and unpleasant! Madeleine's emerald wrap (echoing the colour of her pendant) is complemented (set off) by the pink rose; the latter, in turn, is complemented (set off) by both the deep red of the wall and by the rose's green leaves. The whole frame is an art-work, itself full of works of art or lovingly crafted objects. (Not for nothing will Scottie refer to how Gavin made Judy over, into the false Madeleine ...) So what is going on here? If you will, we are being given the entire film in miniature! I'll do my best in the space remaining to indicate how that is. Take the emphasis on art, artificiality, and, above all, trompe l'oeil. That is the nature of Vertigo, with its related emphasis on appearance-versus-reality. In the original novel, the theme of 'art' is related especially to the Scottie character (there is no Midge character), someone who is 'never quite the artist', though he would like to have been (cf Brandon in Hitchcock's Rope). That theme is being echoed here, in Scottie's yearning consciousness. Again, the trompe l'oeil painting on the wall speaks of ephemerality (and of the difference time and space make to our perception ...), and this is related visually (i.e., in the film's frame) to both the pristine rose and to the exquisite 'Madeleine' herself. In their all-too-fleeting beauty, they are momentarily equated. Yet of course humans seek constantly to overcome, or transcend, the ephemeral, to find, or create, truth and beauty that endure. For a time (!), 'Madeleine'/Judy will become Scottie's art-object whom he tries desperately to 'make' and 'possess' and to 'keep', especially as she herself seems to possess (the secret or 'key' to) 'life' itself, to be the Eternal Feminine incarnated (cf the title-character of Hitchcock's never-made Mary Rose). How vertiginous! Now notice again that rose, Madeleine's flower (cf the nosegay from Podesta's flower shop). Madeleine is like Scottie's 'Rosebud' ? la Citizen Kane but also like the actual rosebud in the vase, which is 'perfect' for a time (!) and then wil be replaced by another, which in turn will be replaced, and so on. The rose's tall stem, with its dark green leaves, may remind us of the tall Sequoias ('always green, ever-living') in the forest scene, though, paradoxically, that scene is very dark and 'chthonic', and altogether the inverse of the Ernie's scene. Significantly, 'Madeleine' (or rather Carlotta speaking through her) is associated with the felled Sequoia ('Here I was born and here I died') - whose cross-section with its rings is itself an echo of the rose at Ernie's and all the other 'concentric circles' imagery (the nosegay, for example). But also, in the same scene, she leans back against one of the massive trunks of the growing trees, appealing to Scottie's, and her own, yearning to transcend, to be 'free'. In turn, that whole scene, and the one at Ernie's (where Scottie first sees 'Madeleine'), relate to Scottie's moment on the rooftop, looking down - virtually at his own death. So the blood-red of the walls at Ernie's may be a subliminal reminder of that 'death', yet the Ernie's scene itself is all about 'life'. My conclusion (with some indebtedness to Charles Barr): Scottie perched at the bar may really be still back on the rooftop, or already falling off it, seeing in a flash what 'life' is - namely, 'colour, excitement, power, freedom', and somehow beyond, yet incorporating, all those things, 'Madeleine' - but also that he must now die. And perhaps, next moment, after clinging to the roof, he had indeed fallen, and the film itself represents an illusion, a simulacrum, of perpetual 'life', imagined in exquisite slow-motion but really in a flash, inside Scottie's head, as he plummets into pain and blood and darkness ...\n\nNovember 17 - 2006\n\nNathalie Morris, of the University of East Anglia, has very kindly sent me details of her paper on Alma Reville (who in 1926 married Alfred Hitchcock), delivered last weekend at a forum in London. The topic of the forum was \"Women and Silent Britain\", invoking the early days of British cinema. In 1916 (or late 1915) Alma started work as a 'rewind girl' in the editing room of the London Film Company at Twickenham Studios. Already she was 'film mad'. Her keenness was soon noticed by director Maurice Elvey who gave her further work on the studio floor. In 1918 she actually co-starred (with Norman Page and Ernest Thesiger) in Elvey's The Life Story of David Lloyd George, about the wartime Prime Minister. And it seems that thereafter Elvey kept a benign eye on Alma. Accordingly, Nathalie Morris would refer to the 'Maurice Elvey connection'. For example, Morris suspects that Elvey helped Alma obtain temporary work as an editor at Stoll Picture Productions, circa 1922, after the American company Famous Players-Lasky shut down its UK operation at Islington Studios. (Alfred Hitchcock, meanwhile, had found work directing a film, never completed, called Number Thirteen.) Morris notes that Charlotte Chandler's biography of Hitchcock quotes Hitch thus: 'About 1923, before we worked together, young Miss Alma Reville asked me if I would mind shooting some inserts for a picture she was editing. Since it was lunchtime, I walked on the stage and just as I was looking through the viewfinder of a camera, a voice behind me said, \"That's my job. You stick to what's in front of it\". It was Jack Cox who later became my cameraman on Blackmail and a lot of other pictures'. Cox is known to have been Elvey's personal cameraman at Stoll between 1922 and 1923. His first film for Hitchcock would be The Ring at British International Pictures (1927). Meanwhile, Alma and Hitch had finally come together at a re-vivified Islington as crew members on Woman to Woman (1923), produced by Michael Balcon and Victor Saville. That picture was directed by Graham Cutts assisted by Hitchcock who also helped write the script and did the sets, and Alma was responsible for both continuity and editing. The rest is, well, history. Nonetheless, as Morris has found, there are plenty of by-ways still to be explored. She writes: 'During the course of my research I became aware of [an] astounding number of connections between Reville's separate work and Hitchcock's films. Reville [as we've seen] was an editor at the London Film Company, the studio that made an early version of The Manxman in 1916; she collaborated with [Hitchcock's friend] Angus MacPhail on scenarios for films such as The Constant Nymph and A South Sea Bubble in 1928; Madeleine Carroll's first film role was in The First Born [also 1928], a film that Reville had co-written with Miles Mander, the star of [Hitchcock's] The Pleasure Garden [1925]. The list could go on (and on).' Thanks so much for sharing that, Nathalie. Here are just a few thoughts. Your mention of Alma's contribution to the 1928 The Constant Nymph reminds me that soon after Hitch went to America, Hal Wallis sought him to film that very work (Margaret Kennedy's tale of a married composer's doomed infatuation for a young woman, his 'constant nymph' - with pre-echoes of Vertigo). It would have starred Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. As for the Hitch-Elvey connection, I've thought about it a bit. For example, I've been struck by the fact that Elvey directed a 1917 version of John Galsworthy's play 'Justice', scripted by Eliot Stannard (who would later write for Hitch) and starring Gerald du Maurier. I find this interesting because I've always thought that Galsworthy's play may have been the seed for The Wrong Man. (There are some pre-echoes of the 1957 Hitchcock film in the play.) Finally, I'm sure that Hitchcock would have seen Elvey's sound film In a Monastery Garden (1932), and again I wonder if there aren't significant elements of Hitchcock in it. Unfortunately I haven't been able to view it. But here's my reasoning. Composer Bernard Herrmann once said, with a touch of hyperbole, that if Hitch were left to himself, he'd score all his films with 'In a Monastery Garden' - presumably meaning the much-loved (in its day) piece of music by English composer Albert Ketelbey (1875-1959). (My Dad had a 78rpm gramophone record of it.) Also, Elvey's film starred John Stuart who the same year would make Number 17 for Hitch (and who had already appeared in The Pleasure Garden). The film is a melodrama about two brothers, one of them a gifted composer, and among the films it pre-echoes is certainly I Confess (1953). But, as I say, I haven't been able to see it, nor to find out if Elvey used Ketelbey's music in it. That's for further research! Meanwhile, to hear the music, click here: In a Monastery Garden.\n\nNovember 10 - 2006\n\nTonight a basically light-hearted entry. Bill Krohn ( 'Hitchcock at Work') has suggested, and I have echoed him, that Hitchcock's famous dinner of all-blue food served to his invited guests one evening was 'inspired' by Hitchcock's having read Joris Huysmans's 'decadent' novel, 'A Rebours'/'Against the Grain' (1884). There, black-skinned negresses serve a dinner of all-black food, on black plates, to the host's guests. For my part, I have suggested that this 'funery' joke (the host was mocking his temporary impotence!) reflects the sort of humour that Hitchcock brought to, say, the 'funery' dinner in Rope (1948), itself based on Patrick Hamilton's 1929 play. (For more on this, see my profile of Hitchcock: Great Directors.) But now I find that Huysmans - and very possibly Hitchcock - actually got the idea from elsewhere, namely, from a 'decadent' of another sort, and another era, the Roman emperor Domitian (AD 51-96). As I read Lesley Brill's book, 'Crowds, Power, and Transformation in Cinema' (2006) recently, I came across an entry based on Elias Canetti's notion that 'The moment of survival is the moment of power'. It referred to the Emperor Domitian thus: 'The terror [Domitian] inflicted on his noble subjects at his famous \"Funeral Banquet\" exemplifies the absolute power in which the paranoiac ruler glorifies. At night in a pitch-black room, Domitian's noble guests found place markers shaped like gravestones, naked servants painted black, and funereal accoutrements. After hours of expecting execution, the guests were returned to their homes and sent valuable gifts.' And Brill comments further: 'Mercy, the fact that the autocrat may allow his subjects to live, only multiplies his sense of power. [According to Canetti] \"He is able, as it were, to despatch them from life to death and then to bring them back to life again\".' This, I would argue, is almost an allegory of Hitchcockian suspense and the relation of Hitchcock to his audience! But I shan't spell it out tonight. I'll simply note that when Hitchcock held a press conference to launch Family Plot (1976), the various journalists were themselves given markers shaped like gravestones! And now, again from my recent reading, here's more about Hitchcock's famous blue-food dinner. Gary Giblin knows exactly where it was held. In his book 'Hitchcock's London' (2006), he has an entry on 'Lyons Corner House' in Soho, the scene of a memorable moment in Blackmail (1929) in which Alice and Frank quarrel over whether to see a new film called Fingerprints. (In fact, as Giblin notes, 'Alice is awaiting the arrival of a secret admirer, for whom she plans to ditch Frank.') Giblin then adds a footnote: 'Behind the Corner House, at the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Great Windmill Street, Lyons operated another famous restaurant, the Trocadero, which opened in 1896. Here, Hitchcock, a friend of the owner's son, staged one of his most famous practical jokes: a dinner party in which every item on the menu was blue! Among his guests was an old friend and fellow practical joker, Sir Gerald du Maurier. ... The restaurant closed in 1965 but the building still stands, a repository for trendy (i.e., touristy) shops and restaurants.'\n\nNovember 4 - 2006\n\nThis topic of 'subjectivity' is of course a huge one. (Incidentally, I've slightly revised the last entry. Hope it's a little clearer. Be aware, for example, how I'm saying that Norman Bates's 'pessimism' is a product of who he is, and we don't necessarily have to accept his generalisation that 'we're all in our private traps and ... never budge an inch'! On the other hand, from a philosophical perspective, it's difficult to deny a fundamental, Kantian truth in what he says. Paradox!) Now, I have said elsewhere that Hitchcock's films combine the pessimism of Oscar Wilde and the anti-pessimism of G.K. Chesterton - and that we won't understand what Hitchcock is doing unless we grasp this and can live with it! For ultimately those films are about us, the audience, and our individual subjectivities. They may initially imply various reasons why it's impossible, or near-impossible, to be 'free' - that's an implication, I take it, of those converging lines in the North by Northwest credits - but at the end of the day, or the end of the story, the films discharge us to our particular responsibilities, which are potentially life-affirming. This accords with the tenor of a recent article by sociologist Frank Furedi, called \"Putting the human back into humanism\". Citing 'the prevailing sense of diminished subjectivity', he writes: 'Social commentators regularly declare that we live in an era of the \"death of the subject\", \"the death of the author\", \"the decentred subject\", \"the end of history\" or \"the end of politics\". Such pessimistic accounts of the human potential inform both intellectual and cultural life in the West, providing a cultural legitimation for the downsizing of human ambition.' Furedi, though, thinks it's high time we resisted such depowering of subjectivity. (To read his article, click here: Frank Furedi.) For what it's worth, a strikingly similar conclusion seems to have been reached by legendary French thinker Michel Foucault (1926-1984). In works like 'Discipline and Punish' and 'The History of Sexuality' he had stood a standard Enlightenment tenet on its head: knowledge, which we traditionally thought would set us free, merely enmeshes us more efficiently in 'biopower' (modern society's capacity to regulate us all via statistics, normative sexual expectations, supervisory procedures, et al.). Talk about a (hapless) man/individual who knows too much! Talk about those imprisoning lines in North by Northwest! A consequence was that individual subjectivity was belittled (in two senses). But now a new book by Eric Paras, 'Foucault 2.0: Beyond Power and Knowledge', indicates that near the end of Foucault's short life, he changed position. In a late interview he reportedly said: 'I think it is characteristic of our society nowadays, that subjectivity has the right to assert itself, and to say ... \"that I cannot accept,\" \"that I don't want\", or \"that I desire.\"' He took to espousing Baudelaire's and Nietzsche's notions of 'the dandy' - the individual who makes his whole persona into a veritable work of art. Which may bring us back to Hitchcock. For Hitchcock, influenced by Oscar Wilde, certainly cultivated just such a persona as the dandy's. (Hitchcock's regulation dark suits, as Thomas Elsaesser points out, were his particular dandy's 'uniform'!) And from Wilde's (and Walter Pater's) notion of 'art for art's sake' - an inherent part of Wilde's dandyism - Hitchcock evolved his notion of 'pure film'. He now, I think, saw several things. Film is neither (just) 'objective' nor (just) 'subjective', but nor is it (just) 'nothing'. Rather, like the very Will of the world, it is a 'force' that is both 'objective' and 'subjective' at the same time. It has an objective reality of sorts - but what that 'reality' consists we can only know subjectively. It has to be interpreted, or even 'invented', and each time in a particular context that involves the audience (or individuals) interacting with the film. Just like the artist himself during the film's conception and making. But whether we can live up to the particular freedom that Hitchcock's own dandyism surely gave him - a freedom reflected in the films where, if not 'anything goes', at least we can 'expect the unexpected' - is an open question. I absolutely concur with Slavoj Zizek's point near the start of A Pervert's Guide to the Cinema (2006) about how, if we infer of Hitchcock's The Birds that the bird attacks reflect, say, the mother's jealousy of Melanie (or symbolise the Bomb, or ...), that inference/interpretation is only a convenience. As far as I am concerned, the birds are a reflection of us, the audience, and of our ever-so-protean Will. (Zizek, of course, would prefer to say 'of our Desire'.)\n\nOctober 27 - 2006\n\nToday some more thoughts on how Hitchcock's films are 'subjective' (cf above, October 20), this time apropos Psycho (and The Birds). Someone has kindly sent me the URL of an essay he once wrote on Psycho. Its argument is that psychoanalytic readings of that film typically pigeon-hole it with particular theories that prove too simplistic. For example, Dr Barbara Creed attributes to Norman 'the passive elements of the film' but then proceeds to note the shot of Norman spying on Marion: '\"Now Norman controls the look.\"' (He also ups and kills her, let's not forget!) To me, this criticism of a reading like Creed's is itself simplistic - or, anyway, inadequate. It fails to tell us what Hitchcock is actually doing. Again and again here, I have suggested how Hitchcock must be read, namely, as an ironist according to Friedrich Schlegel's definition: irony involves 'recognition of the fact that the world in its essence is paradoxical and that an ambivalent attitude alone can grasp its contradictory totality'. This is in keeping, most importantly, with the fundamental nature of the world's blind, amoral Will as described by Schopenhauer. The credits-sequence of Psycho is all about Will (though it may be based on the credits of Tod Browning's 1928 The Big City). A 'force' is at work here. And the concluding moments of the sequence are particularly strong in suggesting a city of tall buildings and their inverted reflection, in turn implying 'schizophrenia'. Accordingly, if Psycho is 'subjective', it is so, first, apropos its collective audience, the crowd or mass, as well as the individuals who comprise it. (Let's never forget this, for it's very important, too, apropos The Birds, where the birds are both Will and the mass audience, reflected.) Second, I think Psycho is 'subjective' apropos the 'divided' characters in it. (Two such characters are Lowery, who keeps a bottle hidden in his desk, and his client, Cassidy, who has a part of his life - not just his money - that he doesn't 'declare'.) Just before Norman tells Marion that he minds being in his 'private trap', i.e., his particular subjectivity, 'but I say I don't' (!), he makes his remarkable observation about this whole matter: 'People never run away from anything. ... I think that we're all in our private traps, clamped in them. And none of us can ever get out. We scratch and claw [like birds and animals] but only at the air, only at each other. And for all of it, we never budge an inch.' This is, of course, both poetic and pessimistic. For formulating his theory of Will - to which everyone and everything is subject (cf Hitchcock's famous remark, 'Everything's perverted in a different way') - Schopenhauer is traditionally labelled a philosophical pessimist. But clearly, I think, Schopenhauer's and Hitchcock's understanding of 'how the world goes' is essentially the same. On the other hand, precisely by reason of the fact that Psycho is so obviously a 'thesis' film (about its characters, and the nature of the masses), its 'subjective vision' (call this the film's style) provides an 'out'. Norman is something of a representative Everyman (like, say, Scottie in Vertigo) but at the same time an extreme instance of what he represents (Will?). So this 'subjective' style of the film implies a contract entered into by the filmmakers, comparable to the traditional role of a court jester: the film, like the jester, can always plead, 'I was only joking', and is allowed by us considerable licence as a result. Licence, that is, to tell the truth in all its essential paradox! Finally, I recently read Angelo Restivo's essay called \"The Silence of The Birds\". After noting the film's underlying 'electronic hum' - which I would say represents Will! - Restivo observes that the media invoked by the film (notably, the radio broadcasts) are 'radically incommensurate to the task that The Birds has set out for us.' The use of the word 'incommensurate' seems very apt here. It brings us right back to Kant's unknowable Thing-in-itself (see September 30 and October 6, above) which Schopenhauer equated with Will. And what is the task that the film has set out for us? Restivo's answer: '[it is] nothing less than the imperative to re-think the human, once we have moved \"beyond subjectivity.\"' Bravo! Restivo is I think quoting Slavoj Zizek here - someone else who constantly refers back to Kant. Of course, Kant insisted that to break out of 'subjectivity' is impossible! On the other hand, Schopenhauer believed that precisely art (and mysticism) could point the way. Another paradox! But it's that paradox that may indeed be at the heart of Hitchcock' films - which were, I keep noting, influenced by the Symbolist movement for which Schopenhauer was the philosophical figurehead.\n\nOctober 21 - 2006\n\nA News item here about a year ago noted that a play based on Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935) had recently opened at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. (Scroll down to UK stage production of The 39 Steps below to read the item.) Now Danny Nissim in London has emailed us to say that the production has moved there, and that he went to see it the other night with his wife and a couple of friends, 'all of whom know the film well ... and we all found it huge fun'. Here's Danny's report: 'I am writing to let you know that the other night I had a very enjoyable evening seeing the stage production of The 39 Steps at the Criterion Theatre, Piccadilly Circus, London (the theatre is appropriately a few minutes' walk from the London Palladium). This is the same production adapted by Patrick Barlow that your correspondent noted when it was on in Leeds. It now has a new director, Maria Aitken, and stars Charles Edwards as a wonderfully unperturbable Hannay with all (yes all) the other parts played by Catherine McCormack, Rupert Degas, and Simon Gregor. Although billed as \"John Buchan's 'The 39 Steps'\", this is 100% based on Hitchcock's film, with a little extra dialogue and business added here and there. Let me say right away that you would have to be a rather churlish purist (of either film or theatre) not to find this witty and affectionate version of the film hugely appealing. I cannot but agree with leading London magazine Time Out's reviewer who says \"Wholly irreverant yet entirely affectionate, it manages to both conjure the spirit of the original and make comedic hay from the theatre's unsuitability for the task.\" The fact that four actors take all the parts, with instant scene and costume changes only adds to the sense of frantic pace and surreal juxtaposition which are so characteristic of the film, and to be fair to Buchan, the flavour, if not the detail of which goes back to the book. I particularly liked the witty references to specific visual and aural moments in the film - we even get the classic cut with overlaid sound from the cleaning lady's scream to the train whistle, a moment of \"pure cinema\" you would have thought impossible to duplicate on stage, and all the more enjoyable when they carry it off. As your earlier correspondent notes, it's all here: the handcuffs, the stockings, Mr Memory (wonderfully played by Simon Gregor), the milkman, and of course Annabella Schmidt/Smith and Pamela (both very nicely judged by Catherine McCormack). Suffice to say that Rupert Degas shows his missing little finger to great effect, and I've given the entire cast due credit.' Thanks a lot, Danny. By the way, Piccadilly Circus itself appears fleetingly in Hitchcock's The 39 Steps although, as Gary Giblin's 'Hitchcock's London' (Midnight Marquee, 2006) notes, probably it's only a 'stock shot' (as the film's shooting script in fact calls it), showing the well-known lit-up signs. Finally, I'm going to pose to our readers one of the 'Ask Mr Memory' questions from Gary's book. The question is actually about Sabotage (1936). 'What does Vladimir - Verloc's paymaster - recall having seen on a sign in Piccadilly Circus?' And the answer is ... that it was 'the centre of the world'. (Gary's excellent and painstaking book will be reviewed on our New Publications page in the next few days.)\n\nOctober 20 - 2006\n\nToday's entry is adapted with few changes from something I've just posted on our Yahoo Group. There, I mentioned how the credits-sequence of Marnie (1964) provides a further instance of the sort of 'force' I discussed here last week operating in the Torn Curtain credits-sequence (see October 13, above). The look of the Marnie credits is 'old-fashioned' and sedate: decoratively-bordered pages turning of themselves, one after the other, a device at least as old as many 1930s literary adaptations by Irving Thalberg or David Selznick. But the sedateness is counterpointed by the rearing and plunging Bernard Herrmann score and an almost palpable 'cry' (as it were, in the night) - the sounds of a literal offscreen nightmare. The sense of an invisible 'force' at work (turning those pages, producing that nightmare) is counterpointed in turn with the noticeable near-silence of the opening scene - in which a shapely brunette, carrying a round yellow handbag under one arm and a suitcase in the other hand, walks away from us along an otherwise deserted railway platform. Another element of counterpoint is the sleek, modern look of the platform, especially the wing-like station canopy. The scene might almost have come from an Antonioni movie (could that be Monica Vitti walking away from us?!): indeed the nearby railway carriages look like they might have been deliberately painted grey for the film in order to match the generally steely appearance of the setting, including the gasometer in the background. The camera tracking the brunette tries in vain to keep up with her as she walks along a safety-line painted on the platform, which implies a lot about her determination to follow the (illicit) course she has set herself. For this is Marnie, seen now from behind in long-shot, but soon, in a pay-off shot, from in front, washing the black dye from her hair and emerging to our startled, but gratified, eyes as a blonde. (An irony of this 'full frontal' close-up shot is that Marnie isn't preparing to meet some boyfriend to have sex but - in the next sequence - to ride her beloved black stallion Forio. For Marnie isn't exactly your typical young office-girl ...) On our Yahoo Group someone reported that he had just seen Marnie for the first time and that it had 'blown his mind'! He would put the film, he said, up there with the other great films like Bergman's Persona, Resnais's Hiroshima, Mon Amour, and Welles's Citizen Kane (another Bernard Herrmann-scored work, of course). And I, for one, would agree with him. As I said on the Group, I have always been staggered by the people who think Marnie is just another pseudo-psychoanalysis story, full of 'crude' effects. I've pointed out here several times that the alleged 'crudeness' is obviously deliberate when you examine the film (but of course you should also be responding to the film at a visceral level, feeling Marnie's underlying hurt and anguish - the reason for which emerges at the end - and her brief moments of literal escape and fleeting happiness, notably when she is riding Forio). That is, the film is intentionally 'crude' and in-your-face and abrupt, in its music and cutting and use of red suffusions, for example - not to mention its dialogue. (We know that Mark Rutland will eventually 'tame' the wild, jaguarundi-like Marnie, not least because he is prepared when necessary to talk to her in language that isn't 'decent' or decorous - like those opening credits showing pages turning - but rather along the lines of his blunt instruction to her: 'Now let's back up and turn that Mount Everest of manure into a few facts.' By 'Mount Everest of manure' he means, of course, 'heap of horse shit' - which is certainly speaking to Marnie in terms she understands. Mark is an astute psychologist as well as zoologist.) In Marnie, Hitchcock took his use of 'subjective' style to its logical extreme, given that Marnie herself isn't some idealised anima-figure like 'Madeleine' in Vertigo - where everything is smooth and flowing and beautiful - but, on the contrary, someone who is herself constantly on edge, tormented, and subject to nightmares. In its 'expressionist', deeply-felt way Marnie is the equal of some of the plays of Strindberg ('Miss Julie', 'A Dream Play'), and in its absolute conviction, as 'perfect' a film as Vertigo. Its surface 'crudeness' belies its true quality. Tomorrow: the play of The 39 Steps has reached London ...\n\nOctober 13 - 2006\n\nAs I've said here before, one of my favourite sequences in Hitchcock is the credits-sequence of Torn Curtain (1966). (And I think the film itself is kilometres under-rated. Let's see what Michael Walker has to say about it in the forthcoming 'Hitchcock Annual'!) John Addison's lurching main theme will be reprised during the bus sequence later, and that's fitting because both sequences are life-death ones. During the credits a flame burns fiercely on the left of screen, suggesting the sun and/or the life-force. On the right of screen - in apposition, so to speak, to the burning flame - appear a succession of faces, the watchers and the watched, impassive or agonised (after an initial brief happy moment of love-making by Michael and Sarah). At the end, Sarah's face will plummet away from us. The sequence is, at one level, about Sarah's 'awakening' to the harsh reality, and the suffering, of life - thus anticipating the film itself. But it is also more. It is another of Hitchcock's 'Symbolist' sequences, of which there are many in later Hitchcock. (Arguably, whole films, like Vertigo, Psycho, and The Birds, are 'Symbolist' works.) At its most basic level, the Torn Curtain credits-sequence emblemises the creation of the world. The burning flame, evoking, as I say, the sun, initially emerges out of a swirling grey mist. Camille Paglia has described such a moment at the start of a chapter in 'Sexual Personae' (Penguin Books, 1991), a chapter called \"The Birth of the Western Eye\": 'Mythology begins with cosmogony, the creation of the world. Somehow out of the chaos of matter comes order. The plenum, a soupy fullness, divides itself into objects and beings.' But even more apt to Torn Curtain is a related passage from Schopenhauer (the favourite philosopher of the original Symbolists), in his remarkable essay \"On the Suffering of the World\": 'In Buddhism the world arises as a consequence of an inexplicable clouding of the heavenly clarity of the blessed state of Nirvana after a long period of quietude. Its origin is thus a kind of fatality which is fundamentally to be understood in a moral sense, notwithstanding the case has an exact analogy in the physical world in the origin of the sun in an inexplicable primeval streak of mist.' And another thing. Like so many Hitchcock credits-sequences, the one for Torn Curtain is all about a force - or forces. (The fact that Sarah is seen plummeting away from us at the end of the sequence suggests that one such force is gravity, thus linking the film to Vertigo. Of course, gravity in Vertigo is a metaphor for other entities or forces, most notably death and mortality.) Now I'd like to quote from an essay on the Symbolists by Shehira Doss-Davezac (whom I've quoted here previously - see September 30, above). In this passage, she herself quotes first from Poe, then from Schopenhauer (both of whom were seen by the Symbolists as virtual father-figures of the movement): 'In On the Natural Wickedness of Man [...] Poe had written: \"This mysterious force [of] which modern philosophy refuses to take account ... this primitive, irresistable force is man's natural perversity which makes him forever and at once both homicide and suicide, murderer and hangman.\" Schopenhauer's philosophy had indeed taken account of it, presenting men, we are reminded, as \"divided into tortured souls and torturing devils.\"' (Note: the Schopenhauer phrase is once again from \"On the Suffering of the World\". The world is Hell, he says there - anticipating another resonant moment in Torn Curtain where the image of the sun and the flames of Hell threaten to merge. Schopenhauer would indentify Poe's 'mysterious force' as the Will in man.) I want to suggest in passing that this force is almost the very subject of Hitchcock's films - informing many of their credits-sequences, for example - but I'll conclude with another aspect of this matter of 'force'. I suggest that it is connected to Hitchcock's creative genius. With his training in electrical engineering and draughtsmanship, Hitchcock, like many engineers, probably thought of the world in terms of 'force' quite naturally. It has been said of Leonardo da Vinci: he 'realized that the mechanical forces at work in the basic laws of mechanics operate everywhere in the organic and inorganic world. They determine animate and inanimate nature alike as well as man. ... So, finally, \"force\" became the key concept for Leonardo; as virt? spirituale ('spiritual property'), it shaped and ruled the cosmos. ... Leonardo's science offered a unified picture of the world ...' ('Encyclopedia Britannica', 2001 edition, on CD-ROM.) Hitchcock's extraordinary productivity and conceptualising power - not to mention his vision of the world itself and its people - may stem from a similar unified understanding as Leonardo's (or Schopenhauer's), I suggest.\n\nOctober 7 - 2006\n\nA useful book is 'A Pocket Guide to 20th Century Drama' (2001) by Stephen Unwin with theatre journalist Carole Woddis. Unwin is (was?) Artistic Director of English Touring Theatre, and the book contains essays on fifty key plays, from Arthur Schnitzler's 'La Ronde' (famously filmed by Max Ophüls in 1950) to Michael Frayn's 'Copenhagen' (which Howard Davies made for TV in 2002, about the meeting of Werner Heisenberg - see yesterday's entry, above - with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen in 1941). One of the essays is on Sean O'Casey's 'Juno and the Paycock' (1924), and it set me thinking about how Hitchcock's stodgy 1930 film version of the play - although a failure - relates to the director's later films. The play was the second of O'Casey's so-called Dublin Trilogy (after 'The Shadow of a Gunman' and before 'The Plough and the Stars') and all three plays are 'rooted in the popular traditions of music-hall and melodrama' - so Hitchcock should have felt quite at home (besides which, his mother was Irish). (But he later admitted that he felt defeated by the play's very tightness, so that, one imagines, he could neither open it out nor - by cutting away to 'things' - create what Siegfried Kracauer would call 'psycho-physical correspondences'.) At the heart of the play, we're told, 'is the great, and some would say eternal, struggle between men and women. The play presents the world of male folly, arrogance and war and sees it as disastrous and charming, destructive and seductive in equal measure.' (Some of that, I noted in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story', would carry over into Hitchcock's Sabotage [1936], though - the subject being anarchism - without the charm or seductiveness.) Both 'Captain' Boyle, the strutting 'paycock' of the title, and his equally feckless drinking partner Joxer, 'resemble a music-hall double act'. But 'Boyle's wife Juno is cut from a very different cloth. She is struggling to survive and keep her family and dignity together ... but she is also at times a working-class snob ... she is as limited in her down-to-earth attitude as Boyle is in his flights of fantasy. Despite all this, her struggle is presented as an heroic one.' That's true. The trouble is, I think, that Hitchcock's film, despite a fine performance by Sara Allgood, falls into the trap of sentimentalising Juno. The spectator is scarcely made aware of her personal limitations. In 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story' I suggested that Hitchcock afterwards sensed where he had gone wrong: 'For example, Juno represents both the first and the last of his films' positive \"Great Mother\" figures. Thereafter he would strive to give his films more psychology, even paranoia, with a result being the eventual emergence of the negative Great Mother figures in films like Rebecca, Notorious and ultimately Psycho. Much more interesting!' (Probably, of course, in all these cases Hitchcock was remembering the formidable Mrs Whittaker from Easy Virtue.) The authors of 'A Pocket Guide to 20th Century Drama' extend their observation to the other characters. All are flawed. For example, when, at the end, the socialist Jerry Devine returns and declares his love to Mary Boyle (who had thrown him over as suitor for the fortune-hunting Charlie Bentham), 'he soon reveals that his socialist concern for others is not universal when he discovers she is pregnant by Bentham.' (Above, on September 16, I wrote of Hitchcock's avowed God-like role: 'Almost inevitably, ... such a director will find himself portraying human subjectivity, even \"hypocrisy\". Hitchcock may well have been comparing himself silently to Sean O'Casey.) Now a related observation: 'For all O'Casey's [own] socialism and basic sympathy with the [Irish] nationalist cause, it is the expression of atheistic pacifism which is the most striking political statement in the play. When a tailor rebukes Juno for not having enough respect for the dead, her answer is direct: \"Maybe, needle Nugent, it's nearly time we had a little less respect for the dead, an' a little more regard for the livin'.\"' I don't know about you, reader, but I find that remark as boldly apt as Thornhill's in North by Northwest to The Professor: 'If you fellows can't lick the Vandamms of this world without asking girls like [Eve Kendall] to bed down with them and ... probably never come back, perhaps you ought to start learning how to lose a few cold wars.' Now, Juno in Juno and the Paycock (both the play and the film) has another memorable speech, which ends: 'Sacred Heart o' Jesus, take away our hearts o' stone, and give us hearts o' flesh! Take away this murdherin' hate, an' give us Thine own eternal love!' I don't doubt that Hitchcock felt the power of that thought - however obliquely, it informed key moments in his films (I would even include the despised Torn Curtain). The authors of 'A Pocket Guide to 20th Century Drama' have their own comment on Juno's words: 'At the start of the twenty-first century, it is shocking just how resonant this still sounds.'\n\nOctober 6 - 2006\n\nOne or two entries here a week just won't do! (But I'm afraid they may have to!) I was hoping to discuss some thoughts I've had recently on all of the following: Juno and the Paycock, Torn Curtain, Vertigo, and The Birds. (The latter is my particular preoccupation at present, being the subject of a long article 'in preparation'.) And then there's Lesley Brill's book already cited above and reviewed elsewhere on our site. And there's the outpourings of Slavoj Zizek ... But tonight, it's going to be none of those topics but rather a catching-up with some information sent by readers. Firstly, I'm grateful to Dr HH in Missouri who suggests a further significance of Gavin Elster's surname in Vertigo, which, as already noted (on September 3, above), means 'magpie' in German. 'In much of Europe', writes Dr H, 'magpies were birds of evil omen. One way of possibly warding off the bad luck that meeting a single magpie supposedly foretold was to greet it: \"Hello, Mr Magpie, how is your wife?\" Scottie's meeting with Elster is the beginning of his bad luck, and his growing interest in Elster's \"wife\" (Judy) will lead to two deaths.' Hmm, interesting! Just today, GD in Berlin has emailed me with something that significantly adds to this whole matter of German associations. The German word for 'vertigo' is 'Schwindel' - which also means 'swindle'! Scottie would certainly agree about that aspect of his 'bad luck'! (GD has also sent me details of the 'Kino im Kopf' [Psychological Cinema?] film season currently running in Berlin, which opened with Amie Siegel's Empathy [2004] and includes several Hitchcock films.) Next, I thank regular correspondent DF in Heidelberg, Germany, for his response to last week's topic here, which (readers will remember - or can check above) concerned tolerance. 'The problem of the Ding-an-sich, what is known in German as an \"erkennntnistheoretisches [theory of perception?] Problem\", is, as it happens, also reflected in hard science. This was pointed out very effectively by Jacob Bronowski years ago in one of the episodes of his excellent \"Ascent of Man\" series from the BBC. He was talking about Werner Heisenberg, and the Principle of Tolerance (better known, but not better named, as the Principle of Uncertainty) - that principle dealing with the behaviour of subatomic particles. Bronowski finally connects this with the hubris of people who think they know it all ...' I remember the 'Ascent of Man' series with particular pleasure, DF, and am happy that you have mentioned it in this connection! Finally, I thank AM in Melbourne (I think it's now Dr AM, by the way) for his kind words about what I said last time on alternative paths - the 'up' and the 'down' - to ultimate wisdom! My observations reminded him 'of something I read the other day about two contemporary philosophers, Deleuze (you've heard of him!) and the less well-known Alain Badiou, who was just in Australia (he's 70, but an incredibly powerful public speaker). Now, Badiou is a man of maths, science, physics ... but also with a great love for the arts, and what he calls the \"search for wisdom\", which again cannot privilege the high or low road! Badiou tells a story of how, one day, he tried to convince Deleuze of \"his way\" to the truth through mathematical logic, etc. Deleuze could not agree: to him, Badiou's line was finally all facts, figures, abstract imponderables, whereas he (Deleuze) sought a freer, more poetic and imaginative way to truth. But - this is the best part - Deleuze ended their exchange by paying this compliment to Badiou: \"You sing your song well, and it resonates\". And Badiou repaid the compliment by writing \"Deleuze: The Clamour of Being\" in which he, too, tries to let the theories of his \"opposite number\" resonate. This is, to me, a little like the wise relationship you posit between \"open\" and \"closed\" cinema ...' Thanks again, AM! (I was on Amazon.com a little earlier, buying Slavoj Zizek's 'Organs Without Bodies: On Deleuze and Consequences', and noticed the Badiou book there.) Tomorrow: I'm not sure - Juno and the Paycock, perhaps!\n\nSeptember 30 - 2006\n\nAs I wrote yesterday, human nature is blinkered. In all sorts of ways. Immanuel Kant effected a 'Copernican revolution' in philosophy by his insistence - which still gives philosophers a headache - on the unknowability of the Ding an sich, the Thing-in-itself. (Which means that we are all excluded from Total Knowledge.) In Psychology, I was taught about the Johari Window which refers to the fact that every human being has a 'blind spot' about himself. And of course there is human prejudice (political, racial, aesthetic, religious, et al.). When I mentioned to a friend (GD from Melbourne, but currently in Berlin) Prof. Ray Carney's 'set' against Hitchcock, he made a comment that I can scarcely better: 'Cinema is a broad church, as they say, and I do not belong to a single denomination. I think possibly Ray Carney is a fundamentalist - in more ways than one.' But, in this connection, I'd like now to take up the matter of introverts and extraverts - Platonists and Aristotelians - that I raised here yesterday. I have no doubt that Hitchcock was fundamentally an introvert and, yes, a Platonist. Immediately that would have set him apart, so to speak, from approximately 50% of the rest of the world, whose orientation was the opposite. (Prof. Ray Carney for one, perhaps?) As a filmmaker, though, he soon sensed that he wanted to overcome that barrier and to make films that spoke to everyone. In effect, he had set himself the same project of 'individuation' - self-overcoming - that Jung nominated as the life-project of humans everywhere; but in Hitchcock's case it was a project on a scale that few of us can undertake. That is, Hitchcock wanted to put himself in touch with the entire global audience, and so he set his goals accordingly. Now let me backtrack for a moment. In one way, Hitchcock's introversion is obvious enough: he was, by his own admission, always shy, and he always felt most secure when exercising his inner creativity at his desk or on a closed soundstage. But that's by no means the full situation. For Hitchcock was also a self-professed Symbolist ('for a while I even had Symbolist dreams', he told Charlotte Chandler), and a film like Vertigo is nothing if not a Symbolist work. So who were the Symbolists? They were members of a movement in the arts, especially in Europe, towards the end of the 19th century, and I can't do better than to quote from an essay about that movement by Shehira Doss-Davezac. She writes: 'Despite their differences and the diversity of their styles, [Symbolist] writers and painters had a bond in common - a certain mood: a disillusionment with politics, a dissatisfaction with materialism and a search for meaning, not in the natural world, but in the realm of Platonic Ideas of which the self, they believed, had intimations. As a group they had a global view of the world and of life on the one hand, and aesthetic concerns on the other. ... [R]epulsed by ...the Positivist ideals of Realism in painting and of Naturalism in literature, they turned their backs on traditional, academic modes of expression .... Positivism, they felt, called only upon parts of the total man, ignoring his spiritual needs, neglecting intuition whose intellectual resonances they argued, went far beyond the limited and limiting boundaries of reason.' (Quoted in Dale Jacquette, ed., 'Schopenhauer, philosophy, and the arts', 1996, pp. 253-54.) Okay. The above in a nutshell is the direction I see Hitchcock coming from. (Incidentally, I'm grateful to Bill Krohn, of 'Cahiers du Cinéma', who recently reminded me of how Hitchcock's under-rated I Confess [1953] is based on a 1910 play by an 'honourary Symbolist', Paul Anthelme.) But there's still much to be added. For one thing, I must insist that Hitchcock was aware of the potential criticism of his work by someone like Prof. Ray Carney: he had himself been subtly critiquing 'the masses' and their passive, 'half-alive' consumption of 'popular' culture and 'popular' mores virtually ever since he began making movies for those very people in the 1920s, and certainly ever since his portrayal of the two representative middle-class English tourists, Fred and Em, in Rich and Strange (1932). That is, Hitchcock made his movies about 'the English' from the inside - they were effectively 'love-hate' movies - exactly as the great Dickens had written his 'popular' novel 'Bleak House' - a Symbolist novel ahead of its time - back in the 1850s, critiquing the moribund condition of many English institutions, and people, of the day. (For some more observations re 'Bleak House', see \"Editor's Day\", September 16, above.) Now, Rich and Strange is a clear predecessor of Hitchcock's masterly North by Northwest (1959) of which I have recently declared that it is simultaneously a 'critiquing and acknowledging of an \"admass\" society'. You won't grasp the nature of Hitchcock's best work unless you see how he consistently did contradictory, or paradoxical, things. But he did - and Robin Wood's astute observation, 'Hitchcock was often too sophisticated for the sophisticates', applies. A final thought. Hitchcock is constantly let down by both the critics and scholars - even those who profess to admire his films - and by his fans. (Both camps can be very blinkered!) But such is the natural misfortune, and the privilege, of genius. So perhaps now turn to my review of Lesley Brill's 'Crowds, Power, and Transformation in Cinema' (2006) on our New Publications page: here.\n\nSeptember 29 - 2006\n\nTwo weeks ago (September 16, above), I responded to the critic and teacher, Luc Sante, who had reproved Hitchcock for lacking the 'depth' of Henri-Georges Clouzot. The latter's films, said Sante, make 'even Hitchcock's more somber efforts appear as light entertainment by comparison'. Well, I've spent half a lifetime hearing such accusations, in all sorts of contexts and against many different artists, filmmakers, thinkers, etc. (I'll explain this further below.) Accordingly, I simply said: let's not try to compare apples and pears. And now another such accusation against Hitchcock has been levelled, this time by Prof. Ray Carney, author of books on Cassavetes, Mike Leigh, and Carl Dreyer. And my response would be similar. After reading Richard Allen's essay on \"Camera Movement in Vertigo\" on this website recently, Carney wrote: 'I'm not big on crossword puzzles and rebuses and acrostics. [Critics] are so delighted with what [they] can do to and with Hitchcock that [they] never get to the more important question of what Hitchcock can do to you and for you (beyond giving you the sensation of having solved a puzzle or a math equation I mean).' Citing some Charles Higham-like accusations against Hitchcock - his alleged cynicism, cold-heartedness, brutality (or sadism), and 'the life-denying formal chilliness of Hitchcock's cleverness' - Carney concluded: 'I truly believe that Hitchcock's work is trivial and unimportant in the final analysis. He is just not good enough.' (To read the rest of Carney's piece, click here: Carney Mailbag.) What is the correct response to such charges? Well, firstly, I must repeat something I've said here before. I have always taught and believed that there are two types of film, which I call for convenience 'open' and 'closed'. The former may be represented by, say, the films of Jean Renoir or, yes, of John Cassavetes. The other type of film is Hitchcock's, or the work of the German Expressionists. Allowing that the distinction is seldom absolute, what is important to grasp is that both types of film are 'valid'. Or so I truly believe. I once pondered this in my very heart and soul. A longtime student of Shri Vijayadev Yogendra, who taught me yoga and much wisdom - 'Veejay', as his students called him, had been a personal friend and advisor to Pandit Nehru, Prime Minister of India - I reached a point where I had to decide: would I continue my study of the 'closed' Hitchcock or would I henceforth give my preference to 'open' filmmakers like Renoir and the later Rossellini? (Both the latter had made films in India, which may not be insignificant.) My decision was finally not too difficult. I simply remembered the words of Heraclitus (c. 544-483 BC), namely, that 'the way up and the way down are one and the same'. Taking this to mean that, over time, all paths to wisdom are ultimately one, I did not abandon Hitchcock! Indeed, my very 'openness' (as a yoga student) helped me to keep things in perspective. I could see where the English-born Hitchcock was coming from, all right, and I respected it; equally I repected the work of a filmmaker like Renoir. Both had made masterpieces (notably Vertigo and La règle du jeu) and that was good enough for me. It still is. Which isn't to say (1) that I wasn't also influenced by some other things I'd read or observed, and (2) that I don't better understand Hitchcock now, and would still defend him (and the choice I took to remain an 'Hitchcockian'). Apropos (1), consider this. As my regular readers know, I have always loved the novels of the Englishman Charles Dickens. Unfortunately, as far as some academics are concerned, Dickens was a 'popular' writer whose plots were based in melodrama. So even while I was studying Dickens for my Honours thesis at Monash University, Melbourne, I was aware that several members of the English Department held a decidedly snooty attitude towards him! This, despite the fact that Dickens is generally held to be the greatest English writer after Shakespeare! I thought then that those academics were being unfair and I still think that. And in time I realised that human nature itself is blinkered. In particular, gentle reader, I think that the great psychologist Carl Jung's division of human types into introvert and extravert is as profound an insight as you'll ever get. In his famous essay \"Psychological Types\" (which I commend to Prof. Ray Carney), Jung wrote: 'When we reflect upon human history, we see how the destinies of one individual are conditioned more by the objects of his interest, while in another they are conditioned more by his own inner self, by his subject.' And Jung prefaced his essay with a quite marvellous quote from the German poet and occasional playwright Heinrich Heine (1797-1856), whom, incidentally, Hitchcock had read. That passage begins: 'Plato and Aristotle! These are not merely two systems: they are also types of two distinct human natures, which from time immemorial, under every sort of cloak, stand more or less inimically opposed.' In short, I'll be suggesting tomorrow that Prof. Carney is simply not catholic (small 'c') enough, and that the greatness of Hitchcock - which has nothing to do with puzzles or rebuses or acrostics - has passed Carney by.\n\nSeptember 22 - 2006\n\nMore about 'God-like' directors. Gary Giblin's 'Hitchcock's London' notes of Frenzy (1972) that Hitchcock once commented on the high-angle shot showing Rusk (Barry Foster) pushing a trolley at night through a deserted Covent Garden, a view of London behind him. The latter was in fact a matte-painting by artist Albert Whitlock. The reason Hitchcock gave to Peter Bogdanovich for using a matte-shot here was that 'to light that area would have been impossible' (while keeping details of the background visible, presumably). But his explanation implies how keen he was to include the London skyline in the shot and thus make an expressionist 'statement'. (In just this manner, German Expressionist cinema typically located a protagonist within a social environment, often implying a two-way 'battle'. Significantly, an influence on the German screenwriters was the English novelist Dickens - another was the Swedish dramatist Strindberg, and another the Norwegian painter Munch - and Dickens even wrote a story called 'The Battle of Life'. At one point in Frenzy Rusk is shown alongside his cheery Mum from 'the garden of England', i.e., Kent, and an implication is that ever since his childhood something about the wider world has failed to measure up for him. [He's therefore still 'a mother's boy'.] Something has also failed to measure up for the film's Dick Blaney [Jon Finch], of course, but the deeper Lost Paradise connotations are with Rusk. Whether we like it or not, he may represent a feeling that we all have.) Hitchcock further told Bogdanovich that the 'beauty' of such shots 'is that you can become God'. (Quoted in Giblin, pp. 62-63.) Well, the word 'beauty' is ambiguous here, but not Hitchcock's obvious satisfaction with his God-like role. Now let's come back to the French director Clouzot for a moment. Without ever quite being as schematic or broadly symbolic about it as Hitchcock in Frenzy, Clouzot, too, caught something of the world's sadness in several of his films. Of the ageing Detective Lieutenant Antoine (Louis Jouvet) in Quai des Orfèvres, Luc Sante (see above, September 16) notes that he 'is a Sunday photographer whose repertory of subjects sounds uncannily like the career of Eugène Atget (old houses, shop fronts, deserted streets)'. But isn't a lot of filmmaking, including Clouzot's own, like that? He is often at his moody best when showing such scenes in his films. And indeed Siegfried Kracauer's 'Theory of Film: The Redemption of Physical Reality' (1960) has this to say about Eugène Atget (1857-1927): that his Paris street scenes 'are impregnated with the \"melancholy that a good photograph can so powerfully evoke\" ... Film makers have often exploited this intimate relationship between melancholy and the photographic approach ...' In turn, Walter Benjamin's famous essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" (1935) specifically likens Atget's 'deserted streets' to 'scenes of crime. The scene of a crime, too, is deserted; it is photographed for the purpose of establishing evidence.' Okay. So it may seem that both Clouzot's and Hitchcock's films display a 'natural' affinity for their photographic medium, not least because they deal in crime which represents one way of coping - or not coping - with 'the battle of life'. (On location at Covent Garden for Frenzy, Hitchcock gestured all around him and proudly told a reporter that his film was 'full of life'.) The highly-visual novelist Dickens, too, created stories - or 'panoramas' - in which crime was a recurring subject, and in which the various social classes contended with each other and with 'life'. But that's not the whole of the matter. To speak of 'panoramas' may remind us that Dickens was definitely influenced in his story-telling method by current innovations such as the magic lantern and the diorama, whose parents were the original camera obscuras invented in the thirteenth century. Charting the entire history of such optical devices and visual entertainments, in his book 'The Great Art of Light and Shadow: archeology of the cinema' (2000), Laurent Mannoni writes: 'there was one overriding godlike desire: to recreate life, to see a human alter ego, either hand-painted or chronophotographed, living and breathing on the screen'. Such a dream Mannoni sees as being finally fulfilled in 1895, with the first public screenings of cinema ...\n\nSeptember 16 - 2006\n\nI recently (August 26, above) wrote of how I've always felt that Hitchcock's films are told as if from the mind of an all-seeing God, and I quoted Hitchcock himself on how the director of a fiction film must create 'life'. Almost inevitably, I added, such a director will find himself portraying human subjectivity, even 'hypocrisy'. Another such director was the Frenchman Henri-Georges Clouzot whose masterly 'policier' Quai des Orfèvres (1947) I have on DVD. Notes on that film were written for the DVD by author and teacher Luc Sante. After observing that Clouzot could be tyrannical towards his actors, and that 'he meticulously sketched out every shot in advance of production', Sante writes this: 'But in [Clouzot's] work there is a depth, not to mention a profound darkness, that makes even Hitchcock's more somber efforts appear as light entertainment by comparison. And whereas Hitchcock's pictures tend to be set, for good or ill, in the world of archetypes, Clouzot always seems bent on recreating life itself with all its contradictions. He represents the supreme manifestation of that well-known pathological profile: the filmmaker as God.' How to respond to that? First, I don't want to end up comparing apples and pears, so I had better say at the outset that I doubt that it's exactly the case that Hitchcock sets his films 'in the world of archetypes'. Rather, like the novelist Charles Dickens, whose works Hitchcock knew well, he creates a strong central consciousness (say Pip's in 'Great Expectations' or Marnie's in Marnie, though the latter is not without mystery, it's true) and then gives other characters degrees of shading as needed. Peripheral characters may be quickly established with a brush stroke or two, that is, given some striking characteristic (say Miss Havisham's wheelchair and her room closed against the world, or Marnie's mother with her walking stick), but the overall effect is subjective: we're seeing Pip's or Marnie's 'world'. But, beyond that, there's a sense of the 'omniscient author' (or, in Pip's case, a sense that he's narrating from a position of both immediate engagement with the events he's remembering and mature hindsight - a technical feat by Dickens). The point is, that Dickens and Hitchcock both set up 'worlds within worlds' whose limitations are always implicit; the immured 'peripheral characters' are themselves reflections of the metaphysical immurement of the main character. I repeat: the overall effect is subjective, but with a sense of 'a key' (even if this may itself prove illusory, and the 'omniscient author' not really so - we're in Vertigo territory and I'll come back to this). Now, Dickens came from journalism, and Hitchcock compared himself to a journalist (see \"Why I Make Melodramas\" on this website). On at least one occasion, each created a work of immediate 'reportage' that was also 'metaphysical', that attempted an 'overview' of the highest order. I'm thinking of 'Bleak House' and The Wrong Man respectively. In the former, Dickens shows that nobody fully grasps how things are, that all are subject to the System symbolised by the central lawsuit in the Court of Chancery (as it was called). Dickens locates this situation in both time and space, and then provides a further marvellous symbol in Miss Flite's collection of caged birds. She keeps a number of linnets and larks in cages with the intention of restoring them to liberty when the lawsuit is finally resolved. 'They die in prison, though. Their lives, poor silly things, are so short in comparison with Chancery proceedings, that, one by one, the whole collection has died over and over again.' In The Wrong Man (itself influenced by 'Bleak House' I have no doubt), there is similar symbolism, beginning with the 'little lecture on evolution' that Rose's dentist had given her. (I have analysed this film at length in 'The MacGuffin'.) Which is God-like enough of Dickens and of Hitchcock. But in Hitchcock's Vertigo - which could hardly have been made without The Wrong Man as its predecessor - we are given further levels again. That will have to do, for today. The concluding question, then, is this: how does Clouzot measure up in comparison? I will simply answer: quite well. Quai des Orfèvres does indeed show a slice of life from immediate post-War Paris, and gives us its own 'worlds within worlds', not least the representative world of the Paris music-hall. And the same director's masterpiece, Le Salaire de la peur/Wages of Fear (1953), does show him at his most God-like. But apples and pears are not the same, and thus not really comparable, and I refuse to be drawn further - for today!\n\nSeptember 15 - 2006\n\nAn Italian influence on Hitchcock (besides, possibly, from early 'giallo' films)? Most definitely! It all goes back to the 1920s when Hitchcock shot sequences for his first feature, The Pleasure Garden (1925), on location at Lake Como in Northern Italy and was undoubtedly captivated, like so many other people, by the region's beautiful mountain scenery. It serves in the film as the setting for the honeymoon of Patsy [Virginia Valli] and Levet [Miles Mander] and as the film's principal Lost Paradise symbol. Hitch and Alma married the following year and had their own Lake Como honeymoon at the Villa d'Este; afterwards, they often returned there for holidays. Throughout his life, too, Hitchcock kept an eye on the Italian cinema, citing Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948) as one of his favourite 'chase' films. He enjoyed the Italian 'caper' comedy, Mario Monicelli's Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958), and soon afterwards met with its writers, Agenore Incrocci and Furio Scarpelli (billed as 'Age and Scarpelli'), in Rome. Later, he put them to work on his project called R.R.R.R.R., about a big hotel in New York run by an immigrant Italian with a dominating grandmother, but which is soon full of crooks, many of them the man's relatives. Apart from the comedy aspect, Hitchcock hoped to show behind-the-scenes workings of the hotel. (The whole idea was at least as old as Arnold Bennett's 1902 potboiler, 'The Grand Babylon Hotel'.) At about this time (the 1960s), too, Hitchcock watched several films by Visconti and Antonioni, and was greatly impressed. One Italian painter who certainly influenced Hitchcock was Giorgio di Chirico (1888-1978), the founder of Metaphysical painting, with its use of enigmatic imagery and dreamlike settings; but there were undoubtedly many others, perhaps going back at least as far as Masaccio (1401-28), the Florentine artist whose 'Adam and Eve Expelled from Paradise' is an early Lost Paradise masterpiece (and which film scholar Michael Walker would invoke apropos the ending of Hitchcock's 1929 The Manxman). But another Italian who probably had a particularly strong influence on Hitchcock, I've always felt, was Luigi Pirandello (1867-1936). I have written elsewhere: 'I doubt that the great Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello, celebrated for his understanding of the relation between \"theatricality\" and madness, could have written an ending of more psychological acuity than Psycho's.' (But if anyone could, he could, and with vast understanding and compassion.) I added: 'I once noted the likely influence of Pirandello's \"Right You Are (If You Think So)\" on the ending of the sound version of Hitchcock's Blackmail. And a remark by Hitchcock in an interview apropos Psycho strikes exactly the Pirandellian note: \"Reality is something that none of us can stand, at any time.\"' The fact is, that Pirandello was very much 'in the air' in the 1920s, including on the London stage (the above-named play opened there on 17 September, 1925, when it starred Claude Rains), but also literally on the airwaves themselves. It's quite likely, given Hitchcock's work on Elstree Calling (with its references to the public transmissions of primitive 30-line television at this time), that he caught the first live television drama, Pirandello's play 'The Man With a Flower in His Mouth', by the BBC on 14 July, 1930. The play was chosen primarily for its short length of half an hour, and its small cast - just two main characters - but also, no doubt, because, as I say, Pirandello was highly regarded in Britain by sophisticated playgoers and intellectuals (such as those who attended, and helped found, the Film Society, of which Hitchcock was a member). (Two other figures 'fashionable' with British intellectuals at the time were the great German thinker Nietzsche and the celebrated French philosopher Bergson - whose respective ideas can be detected informing Hitchcock films from Rich and Strange to Vertigo.) So that's my thought for today. Pirandello's sensitive studies in fiction, and in his plays, of ideas about reality and the line between normality and madness, and the need for compassion, can be detected in the films of such Italian greats as Fellini (8½) and Antonioni (Blowup), but also at moments in the work of Hitchcock (Blackmail, Vertigo, Psycho, et al.).\n\nSeptember 9 - 2006\n\nI finally got to watch Paolo Cavara's 1971 'giallo' called The Black Belly of the Tarantula (see August 11, above), and it isn't bad at all. Sure, it's pitched at the same shrill level of shock and outlandishness as other gialli I've seen, whose main drawback is that there's little room to modulate into more reflective or humorous or 'real' passages. (Italian Neo-Realism is out the window, very probably by design.) Its inventively languid score is by Ennio Morricone. And the director, Paolo Cavara, it turns out, began in movies as one of the directors of Mondo Cane (1962), which I saw at a young age and which helped make me cynical towards the human race ever afterwards! Actually, the scene in Tarantula in which a scientist in a white lab-jacket explains about the spider whose deadliest foe is a wasp that lays its eggs in its paralysed host for the larvae to feast on, could almost have come from Mondo Cane (given how Tarantula is drawing a facetious parallel with its killer's use of an acapuncture needle ...) Further, I was struck by how Tarantula came out the same year as Dario Argento's giallo called Cat o' Nine Tails (which, incidentally, once or twice borrows from Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief) and often resembles the Argento film, not least visually: 'mod' design, strong colour, emphasis on architecture. Both are about investigations, one (Nine Tails) into what happens behind the scenes at a private research institute, the other at an exclusive 'salon' for rich ladies. In both films, several scenes take place at night. Both contain blind (or seemingly blind) characters. Both include falls from high places. Also, of course, both include multiple murders of young women ... The question is, did Hitchcock see Tarantula before he made his serial-killer film Frenzy (1972), as Gary Giblin has suggested? The police inspector in Tarantula (Giancarlo Giannini) does look a bit like his counterpart (Alec McCowan) in Frenzy, and both policemen have agreeably homely wives who practise culinary arts to please their respective tired spouses in the evening. But it's impossible to be definite about this. I'd settle for saying that I wouldn't be surprised if Hitch had seen some giallo films - after all, we know his interest in Italian cinema at this time, especially the work of Antonioni. And his project called Kaleidoscope, which he'd recently worked on and then had to abandon, does rather sound like a mix of Antonioni and giallo elements. (Note: uncredited scripter on Tarantula was Antonioni's legendary screenwriter Tonino Guerra.)\n\n Additional information. My thanks to correspondent GC in Rome, Italy, for some of the following. First, some facts about director Dario Argento (Cat o' Nine Tails, Suspiria, Tenebrae), one of the leading giallo exponents. Argento was hailed by critics in the 1970s as the Italian Hitchcock because his early films contained Hitchcock references and ingredients. Nonetheless, Argento played down that title, explaining that as Hitchcock was a Catholic and he, Argento, wasn't, their cinematic approach was quite different, and that he owed much more to Sergio Leone for whom he had been a scriptwriter and assistant in the 1960s. Nonetheless, Argento has kept 'quoting' Hitchcock throughout his career, even using Hitchcockian actors in (mainly) minor roles: Karl Malden, Alida Valli (twice), Martin Balsam. His most recent film, made for TV, is in fact called Ti piace Hitchcock?/Do You Like Hitchcock? (2005). (Yes, and I was intrigued by something I recently learned about Argento's first giallo, L'Uccello dalle piume di cristallo/The Bird With the Crystal Plumage [1970]. Uncredited, it was based on a novel, 'The Screaming Mimi', by the respected pulp writer Frederic Brown, about an alcoholic reporter's quest to find a Jack-the-Ripper-like killer roaming Chicago. So you've a Hitchcockian ambience right there: cf The Lodger [1926]. Also, I've just been reminded, by Prof. Tony Williams [whom I thank], that Argento's film contains a 'cameo' by Reggie Nalder, who played the marksman in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much [1956]. Brown's novel had already been filmed in 1958, by Gerd Oswald, when it starred Anita Ekberg. Finally, gentle reader, did you know that Hitchcock had been going to film another Frederic Brown novel, 'The Mind Thing'? It had been his project immediately before he turned instead to The Birds [1963], which has a similar premise: wild creatures attacking humans.)\n\nSeptember 8 - 2006\n\nAs I've just written on our updated Links page, what is often fascinating - and instructive - is to compare a film's locations with how those places appear in the film itself. Some of the appeal of Gary Giblin's 'Hitchcock's London' (Midnight Marquee, 2006) is the opportunity it gives to study its location photographs. The same appeal informs the excellent handbook by Tony Reeves, 'The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations' (Titan Books, 2001), which I understand is now in a Second Edition. From A bout de souffle to Zulu (not to mention a dozen Hitchcock films), Reeves includes precise addresses, and even telephone numbers of hotels and guest houses, wherever possible. [Actual insights into the filmmaking process are few but not altogether absent. For example, we learn that the park seen in Antonioni's Blowup is Maryon Park, south of Woolwich Road, SE7. Reeves then adds: 'Antonioni notoriously manipulated reality to achieve his visual effects, painting paths black and grass green. The bushes, where the \"body\" was hidden, were added, and houses overlooking the park were false fronts. The tennis court, where students mimed the surreal tennis match in the park, is still there, unchanged. The antique shop (it was a grocery store) was in Clevely Close, at the park's northeast corner.'] I would speculate that an intrinsic interest of such photographs, and such information, is the way they can re-vivify the original film for us, whose initial effect on us had been lost, even forgotten. (I think of how the Surrealists would visit little-known parts of cities as a way, they claimed, of skinning their eyes and sharpening their senses. Antonioni himself, when in Melbourne years ago, asked to be taken to just such places; on one occasion, a film student of mine showed him around the old inner suburb, Richmond, where she was living.) Certain websites offer a particularly good way of re-visiting the locations used by one's favourite films. On our Links page, I have specified three of them. John and Brian Tunstill's 'Reel Streets' (here) is dedicated at present to just British films and requires an annual subscription of £10 if you want to access its full contents - which include material on Hitchcock's The 39 Steps and Frenzy, with The Man Who Knew Too Much coming. It could be money well spent. A virtue of Reel Streets is how its photographers have made efforts to match as exactly as they can shots of the present-day locations to actual frames of the films. The same observation applies to the absolutely splendid, and dedicated, site called 'Vertigo - Then and Now' (WayBack Machine). Last but not least, we now have Nándor Bokor and Alain Kerzoncuf's exciting, and stimulating, 'Locations from Hitchcock's films' (here), which is still under construction [Now Finished - AF] but is already capable of enlarging your appreciation of such films as To Catch a Thief, The Wrong Man, and North by Northwest. (One photo of the present-day Oak Bar of the Plaza Hotel shows that the painting seen behind Thornhill and his cronies in North by Northwest was likely a simplified studio reconstruction, no doubt reducing the risk of the audience's being distracted from what was essential.) Visit these websites soon. To end on, today, here's a location-shot of our own (actually cribbed a few months ago from the Web!). It shows the art gallery seen in Torn Curtain, identified by our current 'man in Berlin', GD, as the Old National Gallery. In the film, the building is first seen in a tourist pamphlet and then Armstrong (Paul Newman), viewed from above, is hurrying inside the building it"
