Williams, Isobel Scaife, Howard Douglas, Dorothy Vernon, Billy Bray\n\nHousemaster (1938)\n\nWhen the housemaster at a posh boarding school gets lumbered with looking after three young girls, his life and the lives of the pupils are disrupted.\n\nHousemaster is just one in a depressingly-long line of British films set in private schools. Occasionally an If or a Goodbye Mr Chips raises itself above the mass to say something different or get the genre so dead right it's compelling viewing, but Housemaster just treads the same old ground. Even the addition of three young girls can't lift it out of the ordinary.\n\nDespite the arrival of the women, the focus of the film is on the housemaster himself and his attempt to keep to tradition despite the eagerness of the new headmaster to make changes. Otto Kruger plays him with an air of depression and a transatlantic accent that does more to hint at a backstory for the character than the script allows. It's a decent-enough performance but not one that justifies the star focus.\n\nNone of the players makes much of an impression. The girls are remarkably sexless despite two of them courting a teacher and an over-aged schoolboy. Apart from the equally-sexless objects of their affections and the brother of the third girl the pupils scarcely notice they are there and most seem more interested in their car than their figures. It was truly a more innocent age.\n\nA less innocent aspect of the age is its emphasis on corporal punishment. The film opens with Kruger giving a child a beating. There's no condemnation of this, indeed a theme running through the film is spare the rod and spoil the child. The teacher courting one of the girls finally becomes effective by losing his rag and caning a misbehaving child. Child abuse as a rite of passage is not a theme that plays well these days.\n\nUltimately Housemaster is just another run-of-the-mill film that struggles to make an impression.\n\nScript adapt.: Dudley Leslie, Elizabeth Meehan. (o.a. Ian Hay)\n\nDirector: Herbert Brenon\n\nPlayers: Otto Kruger, Diana Churchill, Joyce Barbour, Ren√© Ray, Phillips Holmes, Kynaston Reeves, Cecil Parker, Walter Hudd, John Wood, Henry Hepworth, Michael Shipley, Jimmy Hanley, Rosamund Burnes, Lawrence Kitchen\n\nHousing Problems (1935)\n\nThe living conditions of the poor are alleviated by slum clearance and the construction of new homes.\n\nThe British Commercial Gas Association, as part of its PR campaign to persuade the nation that gas wasn't an outdated fuel, sponsored a number of short films in the 1930s. Few were as significant as Housing Problems, for its makers filmed real people talking about their own lives and problems. Looking directly at the camera and standing in their own homes, Mr Norwood, Mrs Hill and others explain what they have to put up with.\n\nHundreds of them, every direction. And not small ones, but large ones, just like beetles. You couldn't discern whether they were beetles or what, but they were bugs.\n\nLooked at today, the stars seem awkward and stilted. Most appear to be speaking pre-prepared lines and their Cockney chipperness is easy to mock. What's not so easy to mock are their living conditions. Their homelife is a constant battle against rats, bugs and damp. Some of their accommodation is downright unsafe and it's a wonder how some of the houses remained standing.\n\nLuckily, slum clearance is on the way with lovely new houses and flats for the people. To modern eyes, the flats look like the slums of the future but that's unkind. They're certainly a vast improvement on what went before and the tenants seem very happy.\n\nMany of the ambitious plans for slum clearance would be disrupted by the coming of World War II. And some of the plans would be helped by Hitler's bombs finally flattening the shored-up hovels.\n\nThe vox pop is now a staple of documentaries but at the time this was revolutionary. For all the worthy intentions of 30s documentary makers, working-class people were firmly in the seen-but-not-heard category. Admired as a group, but not allowed to speak for themselves. Housing Problems was the start of a new era in film making. Of course, their words were still filtered through the work of middle-class film makers, and that's largely still true today, but it was a step forward. And it still connects with audiences today.\n\nDirector: Arthur Elton, Edgar Anstey\n\nHue and Cry (1947)\n\nWhen a gang of kids suss that their weekly comic, The Trump, is being used by crooks for coded communication, they decide to round up the villains.\n\nThe synopsis of Hue and Cry makes it sound like one of those dire Children's Film Foundation efforts forced onto a generation of Saturday morning cinemagoers. However, this is the original next to which all imitations pale. It's also the very first Ealing Comedy.\n\nEaling as a film studio had made comedies previously, but this is the one that marks The Ealing Comedy as a recognisable entity. Hue and Cry is untypical of the genre - Alastair Sim is the only middle-class character in it, it's got lots of kids, and it mainly avoids the studio for the bombed-out ruins of London. It also has no pretensions to being satirical - indeed it's not really much of a comedy, more a light thriller.\n\nWhat makes it an Ealing Comedy are its credits (director Charles Crichton, script T.E.B. Clarke, producer Michael Balcon), its determination to be totally British, its lack of sentimentality and the fact that it's gloriously entertaining.\n\nMuch of the entertainment comes from the vigour of the young performers. Of the gang only Harry Fowler and Joan Dowling would go on to make much of a career in cinema, but they're all good. The acting isn't exactly naturalistic, but it's as close as the conventions of the time would allow. Of the grown ups, Alastair Sim goes way over the top as the cowardly hack, but he's allowed to because he's brilliant.\n\nIt's full of memorable moments particularly in the climax with what seems to be every child in London running through the rubble to capture the crooks. The joyous nature of these scenes are contrasted with the creepy atmosphere of a bombed-out warehouse where Harry Fowler is menaced by the chief villain.\n\nIt's a picture that has improved with age, thanks to the location shooting. The ruins of London's docklands provides a spectacular backdrop to the action. The more \"ordinary\" backgrounds also impress. This is a world in which kids work in fruit markets or printing offices, get on buses, hang about on street corners. It's normal life as it was sixty-odd years ago.\n\nScript: T.E.B.
