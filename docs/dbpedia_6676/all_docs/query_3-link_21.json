        "text": "Definitely more of a melodrama than a sci-fi film but I loooooved how anti-Capitalist it was. fuck those millionaires manipulating the stocks. It's interesting to me that the source material pre-dates even WWI, yet this film is very much aware of the impending WWII and the way that fat cat war profiteers took advantage of the nationalism that arose during WWI and is trying to steer us away from that into a more global, united people. alas. Also, the radium drill!! always wild to look at how many different ways radium was used before they realized it caused cancer, etc. wild.\n\nQuite possibly the dullest disaster film I have ever seen. I'm not positive because I found out halfway through that my most beloved aunt died today from Covid, so I couldn't really concentrate after that. But what I gleaned is that as long as it focused on the building of the Transatlantic Tunnel under the ocean floor, or on the disaster elements, it was good enough. But when it switched to relationship melodrama...snooze. Later disaster films learned to have multiple characters so you have multiple stories to tell while they fight to survive, but when you have only one and it's as boring as this, it takes the whole film down with it. It was handicapped to begin with by…\n\nA curiosity from a bygone era of film, 1935's \"The Tunnel\" (aka \"Transatlantic Tunnel\") is a slowly unfolding observation of the construction of of undersea tunnel linking the UK and the US. The film combines character study, early 20th century politics, and science fiction conventions in a lukewarm drama that is as interesting for what it lacks as what it possesses.\n\nThe story is simple: a man is compelled to spearhead the construction of a massive tunnel under the Atlantic. The project is long, expensive, and fraught with danger. There is not much driving conflict to the narrative, but the obstacles in building the tunnel and interpersonal relationships between the characters produce some drama. Themes of wealth, progress, work, and…\n\nThe Tunnel is an oddball: filmed in 1935 and set in the future of the 1940s, it's part sci-fi speculation and part Citizen Kane~esque epic drama. It centers on an engineer's vision to create a tunnel linking the US and England, and the toll that his increasing obsession to complete the task takes on his family. Interestingly though, much of the story is the meta-elements of building the tunnel: the hardships in securing funding, unscrupuolous investors trying to manipulate stock prices, and the need to keep positive media coverage over the multi-year project.\n\nFor the sci-fi side, we gets lots of video calling and helicopter-airplane hybrids. There are some pretty great sets of the tunnel under construction and overall visual…\n\nBoy, this thing felt years long. I’m not a big fan of sci-fi or disaster flicks so I’m sure I’m not the right audience, but even so it was very interesting as a curiosity in two main ways.\n\nFirst, the insane idea of building a tunnel from England to the US. Um, there was no mention of rest stops along the way, so I’m out. But if you accept the premise, you’ll be impressed with what the designers, model shop, cinematographer and special effects team came up with. They were having zoom calls in what 1934 thought would be the 1940s!\n\nThe second thing of note was with all the futuristic stuff, the commentary on geopolitics and capitalism, the filmmakers…\n\nA tunnel is to be built under the Atlantic Ocean, connecting England to the United States. Much is at stake - world peace, the moneys of its rich investors, and the family life of the man behind the science of the tunnel's construction. Released in 1935 the film was set in the then not so distant future and foresaw much later real events like the construction of the Channel Tunnel. It's a 1930s science fiction curiosity, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI watched this film while in Fisterra, Spain (one of the edges of Europe), thinking that the subject matter for this film might be interesting. The entire premise of the plot of this science fiction drama (made in 1935) is focused on the building a tunnel between the UK & the USA\n\nRichard Dix (playing the lead character) either doesn't do a good job with his role or perhaps it was that he was given quite simplistic dialogue to deliver. The same could be said for all of the other characters (the builders, the backers and the women involved in several love trianges of sorts).\n\nNothing in this is devloped to any extent and neither is the premise of the plot: that this tunnel will ensure peace for the world. Not even one line in this even suggests why such might be so.\n\n4.75/10\n\nYes, lets build a fancy tunnel between the US and UK! Very futuristic with televisions and cool looking tunnel trains. So the sci-fi aspect of the movie is satisfying. But the love drama took away from the coolness of it. Not that the women were not worth fighting for, but with such a fancy plot, it wasn't the melodrama I was interested in. But the acting was still quality with the main 4 (Richard Dix, Leslie Banks, Madge Evans & Helen Vinson) delivering and with many guest stars including a cameo of two of the most respected dramatical actors of the early 30s George Arliss and Walter Huston, as Prime Minister and President, respectively."
