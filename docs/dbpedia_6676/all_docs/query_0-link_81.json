        "text": "Editor's Week 2016\n\nDecember 17 - 2016\n\nIt's a while since we invoked Henry James here, apropos the Hitchcockian mysterioso of 'The Aspern Papers' (1888, 1908) and its film version The Lost Moment (1947), starring Robert Cummings and directed by Martin Gabel (who played Strutt in Hitchcock's Marnie, 1964). Of course, now there's a book, 'The Men Who Knew Too Much: Henry James and Alfred Hitchcock' (Oxford, 2012), edited by Susan Griffin and Alan Nadel; and it's to one of that book's essays, \"Bump: Concussive Knowledge in James and Hitchcock\", by Mary Ann O'Farrell, that I want to turn this time. The main idea is that in both James and Hitchcock characters have sudden moments of realisation that are intensely visual - the word for that used to be 'epiphany', or even 'gestalt', though O'Farrell uses neither of them - and in Hitchcock, at least, such a moment may be associated with a bump on the head (as befalls Iris Henderson in The Lady Vanishes, 1938, after which she is infinitely more watchful of her fellow travellers on a cross-country train somewhere near the Balkans). In turn, suggests O'Farrell, the character's realisation, at base, is like a little primal scene (a child's consciousness that its parents are having sex, which it mistakes for an act of violence by the father against the mother). (p. 80) Actually, the instance from James that O'Farrell first cites is the one in 'Portrait of a Lady' (1881) in which Isabel Archer comes upon her husband Gilbert Osmond with Madame Merle (Chapter XL) and, some thirty pages later (end of Chapter XLII), twigs to the moment's full significance - which was succinctly described by Paula Marantz Cohen in her 1999 essay \"James, Hitchcock and the Fate of Character\": 'James represents the moment of Isabel's revelation in visual terms: she enters a room and sees her husband sitting while her best friend is standing, and the visual iconography tells her, in a scenic flash, that the two have had an affair'. O'Farrell suggests that there's a comparable moment in Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954) when Tony Wendice describes having followed his unfaithful wife to an assignation with her lover: 'I could see them through the studio window as he cooked spaghetti over a gas range. They didn't say much - they just stood very natural together. You know, it's funny how you can tell when people are in love.' (pp. 77-78) (See frame-capture below.) Hmm. Another head-bump moment in Hitchcock, cited by O'Farrell, is that of Uncle Charlie in Shadow of a Doubt (1943) who, at age ten, was knocked down by a streetcar and concussed (an incident, btw, based on one that befell real-life serial murderer Earle Nelson: see my 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story'). As O'Farrell notes, in this case the 'concussive knowledge' that results is particularly one of feeling excluded from man-woman relations (the recurring image of couples dancing the Merry Widow Waltz represents, for Uncle Charlie, an unattainable ideal). Applying this to other Hitchcock films, O'Farrell suggests that Vertigo works similarly: Scottie learns that he had been set up by the father-figure Gavin Elster, and that when he 'drags Judy upstairs in the bell tower ..., he seems to want and to need to recreate the scene of his exclusion' (p. 80). (As we once noted, another famous author is also pertinent here: Jorge Luis Borges, whose 1940 tale \"The Circular Ruins\" - translated 1949 - contains the telling observation: 'Not to be a man, to be the projection of another man's dream, what a feeling of humiliation, of vertigo!') The invocation of the primal scene and a feeling of being an excluded onlooker, is cogent, certainly apropos Hitchcock's films, and could have been developed further. Strangely, O'Farrell never mentions Rear Window (1954) - contra Cohen. The latter notes: 'Isabel [Archer]'s drama revolves around a question associated with a domestic plot: who will she marry? Jeff's drama, however, revolves around a question associated with an action plot: how can he prove that the salesman Thorwald murdered his wife?' (I give specific primal scene imagery from Rear Window in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story' - and, as noted here recently, again find parallels in another famous author: this time E.T.A. Hoffmann, whom we know Hitchcock had read, and specifically Hoffmann's 1815 tale \"The Sandman\", which prompted Sigmund Freud to write a famous essay on \"The Uncanny\".) Nor does O'Farrell directly invoke Marnie apropos the primal scene, although the film's flashback specifically shows the little girl Marnie mistaking the sailor's actions for an attack on Marnie's mother. However, O'Farrell's essay has many fine features. And an interesting footnote cites Kaja Silverman on how James's 'The Golden Bowl' (1904) 'is in many ways an extended primal scene' (p. 223, n.5).\n\nP.S. Readers may like to visit Part Two of my article \"Shock, Horror, Spirit\" (on Psycho), now up on the 'Senses of Cinema' website: Psycho: Part Two\n\nDecember 10 - 2016\n\nUnder Capricorn is one of those Hitchcock films in which - realistically enough - nobody in the film grasps the whole situation and for a time this allows matters to spiral out of control. Even the perfidy of the housekeeper Milly is only partially to blame for what happens. Nonetheless, she drives much of the plot, as when - fearing that she is losing her dominance in the household - she goes upstairs and orders Winter ('You're a gentleman, aren't you, so can be trusted to keep your mouth shut') to load the bottles in Henrietta's cupboard into a sheet and accompany her back downstairs to humiliate Henrietta in front of the kitchen ladies; following this, Henrietta rushes from the kitchen and up to her bedroom. (This entire scene is filmed in one take, over several levels.) Later, Milly (accompanied by Winter) has the effrontery to complain to Flusky about Henrietta's having visited 'my kitchen', implying that Henrietta got what she deserved (of course, Milly doesn't go into details). Unfortunately for Milly's plans, Adare just then enters, and stands up to her, telling Sam that 'some act of calculated rudeness' had been performed against Henrietta. This spurs Milly to change the subject, to accuse her accuser of a 'rudeness' of his own (he had been in Henrietta's bedroom the night before - out of concern for Henrietta's silence after he had called out to her from the garden, with Sam looking on). This is too much for Winter, who sees what Milly is up to. He begins to say what had really happened in the kitchen (see frame-capture below), but Sam is overwhelmed by all this unseemly scene-making, especially as it feels to him like the 'gentlemen' siding against his own and Milly's kind, the 'commoners'. (And Milly has lied that Winter initiated what happened.) 'Blast all gentlemen', he says, and orders both Winter and Milly to leave. So Sam's insecurity is partly to blame for the inconclusive outcome to this scene. Similarly, matters are further 'sabotaged' by Charles whose feelings against Sam have become ambivalent (despite their having shaken hands). A couple of times, even before the Government House Ball (where Sam makes a 'scene' of his own), Charles blocks efforts by Sam to get closer to his wife: evidently, Charles wants to be the one who rehabilitates her, and unconsciously slights Sam. And again, although Milly leaves 'Minyago Yugilla' for a time, she comes back and uses the excuse of the 'trouble' over the shooting of Charles to stay on and look after Sam. Winter sees this and naturally is concerned. He tries to intervene: 'Is Miss Milly going to stay, after all?' But gruff Sam brushes the servant aside. So the situation is very complex - and human - and the prowling camera seeks to expose all this. I like Robin Wood's enumeration of the technical aspects of the film (and how they involve the audience): 'The play of interest and sympathy is guided partly by technical factors: who is or is not in the frame at a given moment, who is given centrality within the composition, who is in close-up and who in mid- or long-shot, who is observer or listener, what takes place outside the observer/listener's consciousness, to which only we as audience have access.' ('Hitchcock's Films Revisited', Revised Edition, 2002, p. 330) But I want to emphasise again that a great deal of what is in the film, and is felt by us, the audience, comes from the Helen Simpson novel: for example, the above-described scene with its diverse characters (and which eventually becomes too much for even Sam to handle), or the clever idea of Charles to whistle a tune to inspire Henrietta (the novel specifies 'Over the Hills and Far Away' which I think is the very tune we hear in the film, although it may also be known as 'Here We Go Gathering Nuts in May'). Leslie Brill's understanding of the 'projected shadows who suffer on our behalf' (see last time) is right-on. Finally, I want to quote something else I wrote in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story', and which recognises the film's imagery: 'The [veranda scene's] fiery colour is one of several reminders that Hell haunts this harsh land \"down under\", this \"infernal place\" as the Governor calls it ... But Australia's very harshness has its own beauty. Some things, Flusky will tell his wife, are \"all in your mind\". [So] the same fiery light that suggests the proximity of Hell is allowed, whenever it strikes Hattie's auburn hair ... to invoke a contrary condition ... (One may think of William Blake's lines about building \"a Heaven in Hell's despair\".)'\n\nDecember 3 - 2016\n\nMark Rappaport (writing on Under Capricorn in the 'Hitchcock Annual', 2003-04) says what I tried to say last time: 'When a movie is structured around its tracking shots, the description of the effect of what's up there on the screen is strictly personal. Those who like it describe it as stately, majestic, dreamlike. For those who hate it, it's funereal, glacial, self-conscious.' (p. 44) But there's also a deeper 'divide' between many of the commentators (reviewers, critics, scholars) of Under Capricorn that I have observed with some anguish. I think Marc Raymond Strauss (in his book 'Hitchcock Nonetheless', 2007) is right to praise Lesley Brill for his humane attitude. Specifying Spellbound, Under Capricorn and Marnie, Brill wrote (in 'The Hitchcock Romance', 1988): 'As we watch these three films, we see our own tarnished and unfortunate histories and discover the possibility of our own forgiveness. In the public privacy of a darkened movie theater, we find ourselves on the screen and shed tears of sympathy for the projected shadows who suffer on our behalf.' Strauss comments: 'No wonder most reviewers panned the film. It may be that the critics were not willing or able to address their own mortality in their critiques (certainly such admittance is rare indeed among any critic towards any subject). Hitchcock was really projecting our shadows onto his screen, I think.' (p. 120 - italics in originals) Strauss even says that Brill here gives us 'Hitchcock's real legacy' (p. 119), and again he is surely right! Now, full marks to Professor Ed Gallefent for spotting that the name of Flusky's mansion, 'Minyago Yugilla', in Under Capricorn translates as 'Why weepest thou?', a phrase twice applied in the Christian Bible (John 20: 13, 15) to Mary Magdalen, 'the patron saint of penitent sinners' (as Gallefent calls her). Gallefent even notes that Mary Magdalen was the subject of several paintings by Georges de La Tour, such as \"The Penitent Magdalen\" (c. 1640), which featured such symbols as a mirror (vanity?), a skull (mortality?), and a candle (spiritual enlightenment?), commenting that 'every one of [these images] occurs in Under Capricorn in various places and guises'. (\"The Dandy and the Magdalen: interpreting the long take in Hitchcock's Under Capricorn (1949)\", in John Gibbs and Douglas Pye (eds), 'Style and Meaning: Studies in the detailed analysis of film', 2005, p. 69). (See illustration below.) That's suggestive, obviously. But even more so is the fact that both times, when Mary Magdalen is asked why she is weeping, she is shown to have no reason for her tears (for Christ has risen, and does not need them). (Btw, my thanks to Sony C who pointed out to me that James Bridie, screenwriter of Under Capricorn, was a Scottish playwright who had written several plays on Biblical themes, and may have been chosen by Hitchcock with that fact in mind.) Surely the big implication for Hitchcock's film, with its palpable therapeutic motif (each of the main characters is rehabilitated by the end) is that all will be well, or may be so. (As noted here before, the lines from Emerson that Lil misquotes in Marnie hint at the same thing.) But nowhere does Gallefent directly respond to the therapeutic, or redemptive, motif in Under Capricorn (which Brill was so responsive to); instead his essay concentrates on Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman) as a penitent figure and her 'failure properly to mourn, the sense of a horror that cannot be worked through to its conclusion' (p. 70) Still, he does eventually ask the question, 'How can this situation be retrieved?' (p. 76), and notes that in Hitchcock there is sometimes a 'second chance' motif (as Chris Marker pointed out of Vertigo), which steers him to the structural matter (noted here last time) that events in Under Capricorn roughly repeat themselves when Sam fires his horse-pistol, wounding Adare (as Sam was alleged to have shot Henrietta's brother with a horse-pistol at Gretna Green), leading to a 'solution'. And at the end of the essay, Gallefent graciously admits: 'I am conscious that these observations only touch the surface of the complexity of Hitchcock's art in this project' (p. 82) (Meanwhile, one's trust in 'detailed analysis of film' may have been dented, a bit!) I would add that the sort of things I noted last time about the film's 'Australian' content, and visual beauty, are almost never mentioned by critics and scholars. Nor has any critic that I have read bothered to look at Helen Simpson's original novel (1937), which is unfair. For example, many of the critics and scholars praise the film's scene where Adare takes off his jacket to make a 'mirror' to show Henrietta her beauty (as part of her rehabilitation), not realising that this comes from the novel. (Hitchcock's craft is in the selection of such a detail, and in integrating it with other motifs, such as that of Adare's new-found creativity, his becoming an 'artist'.) To be continued.\n\nNovember 26 - 2016\n\nReader, don't misunderstand my attempt last time to accommodate Donald Spoto's position apropos Under Capricorn's style: note that I wrote, '[it] may appear obsessed with its long-takes' (yes, may)! In fact, that's a stand-offish understanding of them that I don't really hold: I love them, basically. Not only do I think Under Capricorn is the most beautiful film made by Hitchcock (and, yes, I have seen such other Hitchcocks as Notorious and Vertigo!), but I admire and enter into the long-takes every time, and believe I understand their nuances. Just as music-professionals sometimes appreciate certain works that the general public overlook, preferring other works by the same composer (i.e., finding them more accessible), so I have come to think of Under Capricorn as a film for 'insiders'. (In this case, I'm an 'insider' inasmuch that I have often 'taught' Under Capricorn, and written about it, and also because I think it helps that I'm Australian - I'll explain that shortly). Here goes, then. The frame-capture below is from the verandah scene that I have already mentioned (see November 12, above) in which Adare seeks to cure fellow-aristocrat Lady Henrietta (who, like him, comes from Ireland) of the habitual drunkenness and depression that has alienated her from her husband, ex-convict (and commoner) Sam Flusky (who, though, still deeply loves her). Charles is staying with the Fluskys at Sam's invitation. The scene begins with a view of the Flusky mansion bathed in afternoon sunlight. That view is actually a painting. As I explain in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story', it sets the mood and is apt: '(The matching passage in the novel [by Australian author Helen Simpson] is also picturesque, describing Hattie's head \"seen against red feathers of cloud\" as she sits at a French window.) The scene has an audible stillness, and one almost hears sunset approaching. Meanwhile the light is growing fiery. Hitchcock has caught a sub-tropical feel perfectly, doubtless reflecting his researches into light and cloud effects for Rope.' Of course, there's a very pragmatic reason for the sunset effect (in both novel and film): it is needed for the climactic moment when Charles takes off his jacket and holds it behind the glass of the French window to create what the novel calls 'a mirror impromptu' so that Henrietta, irradiated by the sunset, can see that she is still beautiful (she had long ago asked that all mirrors be removed from the house). But the film not only registers the effect sensitively, and beautifully, but it builds on it creatively (which is itself apt, given Charles's remark that rehabilitating Henrietta will be his 'first work of art' - note that another motif of both novel and film is that each of the three principal characters is 'rehabilitated' by events). In the very next scene, Charles will actually unwrap a real mirror that he has bought for Henrietta, and that moment is filmed in such a way as to make the comparison with a painting palpable (the reflection in it appears to be painted!). Meanwhile, the veranda scene has many fine touches. Look again at the frame-capture below. It comes at the moment when Charles first gets Henrietta to smile, at the memory of her dramatic entrance to the dinner held by Sam (described above, November 12). 'Was I dressed?' she asks. 'Yes, more or less!' Charles answers, with a gentle laugh - and she smiles back at him. Just at this moment, the ring on her hand, which she has raised to her face, catches the setting sun, and glints! Again, absolutely apt! Then the scene continues (beautifully underlined by Richard Addinsell's score) and the sunlight continues glowing, in keeping with the increasing light-heartedness of the pair's shared conversation, although Henrietta is still far from convinced that she is up to 'coming back' (as Charles puts it). That is, the light glows throughout their conversation, all filmed in one take - until suddenly there is a pause, and a moment's silence (after Charles's remark about how Henrietta will 'beat back the shadows'), and Henrietta glances up. Now, as the camera pans, there is a cut, and we see Milly passing inside the house: this is the shot that we talked about last time (see November 19 above, with its frame-capture - note the comparative darkness of the interior of the house). As the camera returns to the pair, Charles shivers: 'Brrrr. I felt as though somebody walked over my grave.' To be continued.\n\nNovember 19 - 2016\n\nMany prisoners sent to the penal colony in New South Wales were, as the opening commentary of Under Capricorn says, 'unjustly convicted', and that is important in the story that Hitchcock tells. But not only the legal system is consistently 'faulty' in Hitchcock, so too is human nature. (That's a reason why the philosopher Schopenhauer is so often relevant to Hitchcock's films: nearly a century before Freud, Schopenhauer wrote perceptively - and compassionately - of how sexuality is at the root of much human behaviour and thought.) In Under Capricorn, both Milly and Adare are 'blackguards' in their own way: Milly, the housekeeper, when she sets designs on the married master of the house (a well-known phenomenon: Freud himself noted it in his famous essay on Ibsen's 'Rosmersholm'); Adare, when he falls in love with Henrietta, the wife of the master of the house. Note that Milly and her master Flusky are both low-born, i.e., commoners; the Hon. Charles Adare and Lady Henrietta are both high-born, i.e., of the nobility. So when Adare and Milly speak their different understandings of 'the waltz', they do so from a particular class perspective: Adare enthuses about it, how it is fully respectable; but the religious Milly describes it to Flusky as pandering to lascivious feelings (she is trying to make him jealous that Adare has taken Henrietta to the Government House Ball). Arguably, when Milly resorts to encouraging Henrietta's drinking, and then to attempted poisoning - telling herself that she can see God's real intentions (presumably, that means Milly's marrying a widowed Sam Flusky) - she is being no more or less 'wilful' than when Charles loses his temper at Sam, calling him 'you blundering fool', and urging Henrietta to 'come away with me' to Ireland. Only the class perspective is different. (Milly was played by a rising star of English cinema, Margaret Leighton, and is both pretty and capable: see frame-capture below. Remember, too, that we don't know why Milly was convicted and sent to New South Wales, and are encouraged to think that she was one of the unjustly-sentenced ones. She may have simply stolen a loaf of bread, for example.) Ironically, the most wronged character in the film may be Sam Flusky, whose 'crime' for which he served seven years, was actually committed by Henrietta, namely, the shooting of her brother, Dermot, with a horse-pistol when he attempted to stop her and Sam from eloping, after he followed them to Gretna Green. So when a 'mirroring' of that shooting seems to occur - Sam's accidental shooting of Charles with another horse-pistol - and it looks like Charles may die, with Sam prosecuted on a capital charge (as a second offender), Henrietta's plea to the Governor, 'It was nobody's fault', carries reverberations for the whole film. Two or three 'confession' scenes follow (there has already been a big one, of Henrietta to Charles), including one by Charles himself that is actually a 'white lie', which is another irony, as it resolves the situation up to a point. For a while, though, it had seemed as if there were no way out: Sam describes the legal process as going 'on and on and on'. Donald Spoto thinks that 'to enjoy Under Capricorn, one has to feel a basic psychological affinity for the heavy theme of onerous fidelity, and for the nineteenth-century conceit of remorse freed by confession.' That's a bit prescriptive- a conceit - in itself (and the seeming suggestion that a spot of infidelity may sometimes relieve a life-situation is perhaps not relevant to appreciating this historical-genre film), especially when many a good movie has got around story drawbacks through the sheer force of its style and narration. On the other hand, having raised the matter of style, I'll accept Spoto's thought that Under Capricorn may appear obsessed with its long-takes: 'Too often motionless, the camera seems indifferent, as if actors had to keep talking until the film ran out.' While that particular aspect didn't bother me (they're good actors), sometimes when the camera did move, rather than make a cut, I had the feeling that an idea was being imposed on me. Cutting in a film, especially a craftily-edited film by someone like Hitchcock, can give the viewer a feeling of participation, of taking logical steps and choices inside one's own head. To be continued.\n\nNovember 12 - 2016\n\nI have happy memories associated with Hitchcock's Under Capricorn (1949), including watching a truly exquisite print on a moviola upstairs one evening at the old ABC (Australian Broadcasting Commission) building at Gore Hill, Sydney, New South Wales. It was my first trip to Sydney, and I had arrived that afternoon by bus from Melbourne. Now, with the lights of Sydney twinkling up at me from all around (the ABC building was a tall tower), I watched this wonderful colour film which re-creates early Sydney at the time of the newly-arrived Governor Bourke in 1831 (he is played in the film by Cecil Parker - also in the cast are Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotten, and Michael Wilding). It was almost a mystical experience, like being able to move backwards and forwards in time! Later that year, back home, I had the great pleasure to 'teach' the film to my Film/Drama students at the Melbourne College of Advanced Education. These trainee teachers were always great fun - bright and attentive - and I particularly remember taking them through several of Under Capricorn's 'long takes' and seeing how Hitchcock each time held back the 'cut' to have maximum impact (something he hadn't been able to do systematically in Rope, where many of the cuts were just reel-changes). For example, when wealthy ex-convict Sam Flusky (Cotten) one evening invites guests to dinner at his mansion 'Minyago Yugilla' on the outskirts of Sydney, the camera first tracks and tracks, starting with the arrival of the special guest, the Governor's cousin, Charles Adare (Wilding), and taking in the arrival of the other guests, until they all sit down at table. Something peculiar, the audience notices, is that there are only male guests - each of those, on arriving, had explained that his wife was detained at the last moment - signalling that something about the Flusky household has deterred the ladies from attending. Understandably, there is a certain damper on proceedings as the guests enter the dining-room! Nonetheless, conversation starts up as Flusky bids everyone be seated, and then - as the camera tracks down the table towards him (his back is to the room entrance) - it falters again. Flusky senses this, and now, finally, there is a cut to what the guests have seen: see frame-capture below. We see the bare feet of Lady Henrietta Flusky (Bergman) entering the room; she proceeds to stand behind her husband and we hear her say, 'Please be seated, gentlemen. I trust I am not too late to take a glass of wine with you.' Finally, the camera tilts to her face, and we see that she is beautiful, and that there is a rose in her ringleted hair. But she is drunk. Her reputation for being an alcoholic, we now realise, has preceded her and is the reason why the ladies have stayed away from the dinner. So the 'shock cut' to her bare feet, after several minutes of continuous footage, was dramaturgically justified. It represents inspired filmmaking by Hitchcock, and the film is full of inspired passages, even if James Bridie's screenplay (from the novel by Helen Simpson) has structural faults, and there are lethargic moments. (The moment when Sam, a former groom, shoots an injured horse offscreen and then returns to his house, and angrily clashes with Adare, who had been riding the horse, has long puzzled me. It seems unrealistic. We hear the pistol fired just offscreen, but not the whinnying of the horse: contrast Marnie. Only lately have I realised that maybe the filmmakers couldn't obtain the sound they needed, or weren't prepared to use it. Which makes you wonder just how the makers of Marnie obtained such a sound.) I very much like the scene late one afternoon on the 'Minyago Yugilla' verandah between Lady Henrietta and Adare, when he - at Sam's invitation - has decided to stay as a house-guest with the Fluskys and try to rehabilitate Hattie and thereby bridge the 'great gulf fixed' that has come between husband and wife. I describe the scene at length in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story' (it's one of my favourite passages in the book). But now, from that scene, here's another instance of how Hitchcock builds to a 'shock cut' after several minutes of continuous filming. The scene shows Charles listening attentively as Hattie tells of how she had followed Sam from Ireland to Australia after he was (wrongfully) convicted of shooting her brother. Gradually she opens up about the happy times that had preceded the terrible seven-years wait for Sam to serve his sentence. The light on the veranda positively glows as she speaks. But, after several minutes, there is a sudden cut. The housekeeper Milly (Margaret Leighton) has just paused at the veranda window, and Sam shivers. He is right to do so. (To be continued.)\n\nNovember 5 - 2016\n\n[A couple of deadlines are pressing here, so there's no \"Editor's Week\" this time. But I have added a News item immediately below. Back next week. KM]\n\nOctober 29 - 2016\n\nThe chapter on The Farmer's Wife in Mark Padilla's 'Classical Myth in Four Films of Alfred Hitchcock' (2016) supports the idea (see above) that Minta was linked in Hitchcock's mind to his wife Alma. Today's entry will focus on aspects of that beautifully-written, and -argued, chapter. For a start, Professor Padilla suggests that as Hitchcock in 1928 was newly married, 'the shy and sexually naive director might [have identified] with the bumbling [Farmer Sweetland]. Alma, in turn, may be found in the figure of Minta.' (p. 55) Further, having suggested that the ever-capable Minta is a Hestia-figure, meaning that she embodies qualities of the Greek Goddess of the Hearth, Padilla notes that 'the Hestian work ethic of Minta helps secure this character's move up in social position [she eventually marries the farmer], just as the industry of the Hitchcock-Reville marriage served as an economic catapult for their family'. (Ibid) Padilla quotes Charles Barr on the character of Minta: she is 'efficient, considerate, and entirely unpriggish'. And Padilla comments: 'Alma might have seemed similarly industrious to Alfred, as reflected in the production stills for this and other films of the director's silent era.' (Ibid) The Hestia theme is like a 'tonic chord' to which the film keeps reverting, notes Padilla. He points out that there are actually three fireplaces we see at Applegarth Farm, all of them (when we see them) in use. Padilla: 'The source play's directions ... specify the inclusion of a \"deep fireplace and range,\" but Hitchcock compounds this prop direction by featuring three burning hearths. The first is located in the upstairs bedroom; the second is in the main room behind the two marital chairs, a setting where guests are entertained; and the third is the large cooking range in the kitchen.' (p. 56) Crucially, 'Minta moves busily and freely in the three spaces. By contrast, the women whom [Sweetland] targets for his second wife are never visually connected to a burning hearth, even in their own homes. Only Minta of the older females in the film exhibit the goddess' sensibilities, which she embodies decorously, while the others are comically associated with other Olympian goddesses ...' (Ibid) (Padilla sees Widow Windeatt as 'an independent Hera figure' with a bit of Artemis for extra measure; Thirza Tapper 'projects an unconfident and confused Aphrodite'; Mary Hearn is like a 'clumsy Athena'; while the middle-aged barmaid Mercy Bassett 'suggests a Dionysian bacchante' - ibid.) Reader, if you have already seen The Farmer's Wife, you will recall that it begins with the death in the upstairs bedroom of Sweetland's first wife, Tibby, while Sweetland sits alongside, watching sadly, and Minta looks on, ready to do whatever is asked of her. Tibby's expiring words are actually to Minta: 'Don't forget to air your master's pants.' There is an intimacy here to which Padilla is responsive. He is also perceptive when he notes: 'The fact that the two women share body types and dark hair reinforces their sisterhood; neither woman shares appearances with the other females [Sweetland] pursues.' (p. 59) (I was reminded, to a degree, of how in Rear Window the ill-fated Mrs Thorwald, when we see her sitting up in bed, is like an older Lisa Fremont: in a way, the film is about Jeff's changing attitude to Lisa, from suspicion - he thinks she might become a nagging wife, like Mrs Thorwald - to admiration and unstinted love.) Padilla can also be ingenious. A good example is when he invokes the wedding of Sweetland's daughter, Sibley, followed by the couple's arrival home afterwards for the wedding breakfast, when Minta comes out to welcome them. (See frame-capture below.) Like 'a kind of Hestia priestess', she greets them, then ushers them into the main room where 'she places them directly in front of the burning fireplace'. (p. 61) Then: 'The organization of this scene evokes the ancient social practice as depicted on an ancient Greek pyxis [a round clay jar], housed in the British Museum in London.' (Ibid) And Padilla describes how such a jar - almost like cinema - 'presents, in a continuous scene, the groom's introduction of a bride into his new home ... It is itself a kind of reel showing a small film when one turns it - a kind of ancient Greek home movie celebrating a couple's wedding ...' (p. 61, p. 64) Beautifully put!\n\nOctober 22 - 2016\n\nThe Farmer's Wife is one of those Hitchcock films where the very life-force features palpably. It anticipates that other splendid comedy The Trouble With Harry (1955) whose range of characters, from the youngest (the boy Arnie) to the oldest (Captain Wiles), its seasons-imagery, and, above all, the general 'zest' (the Captain's word) combine to invigorate any viewer who 'enters in' to the film's spirit. There is a touch of the mystical about it. Actually, I have taken the phrase 'enters in' from The Farmer's Wife where it is used by Minta (the housekeeper Araminta) when she refers to her willingness to marry Farmer Sweetland: marriage is itself an exalted state that is valorised by both these films, very appropriately, as it is the consummation of the working of the life-force. Maurice Yacowar ('Hitchcock's British Films', 1977) puts the matter well when noting that The Farmer's Wife omits the play's political references (mainly spoken by Churdles Ash) so as to emphasise, instead, a potential disorder that 'is not of so simple a kind as could be solved by politics. Rather it is rooted in man himself, in his wilfulness, in his deluding perception, in the tricks of fate to which he is prey, in the shallow footing on which man bases his claim to be a rational, civilized creature.' (p. 77) Note especially 'deluding perception'. It reminded me of an astute observation by Charles Barr ('English Hitchcock', 1999) about Sweetland, as played by Jameson Thomas, whom Barr likens to later Hitchcock protagonists played by James Stewart and Cary Grant: '[Sweetland] can be seen, in fact, as a prototype for these [more] familiar Hitchcock protagonists in the way he combines the adult with the childish, a forceful male arrogance with a disarming vulnerability'. (p. 57) (Jeff in Rear Window, anyone? Or Devlin in Notorious?) In turn, I was reminded of an (only slightly simplistic) observation by Raymond Durgnat that I quoted here recently: '[Hitchcock] catches us in that semi-serious, semi-infantile area where we accept innocent and wicked as real moral states, and then insists that we grow up, a little.' ('The Strange Case of Alfred Hitchcock', 1974, p. 36) Hitchcock was always very aware that many people waver between adult and childish, though they may be caught for a time in a condition or mindstate that they know is inadequate or harmful, but can't readily get out of - until, if they are lucky, something 'saves' them. (Perhaps marriage?) In other words, it may take just a sudden - but long delayed - shift of circumstances or new realisation to effect a major change. As it happens, the very form of The Farmer's Wife provides one of the earliest instances in Hitchcock of a character making such a life-change, when, after four 'refusals' by the respective women he has asked to be his new bride, Sweetland realises - in an 'epiphany' - that the ideal woman for him has, all along, been his housekeeper, Minta. And what a fine figure of a woman she is! (See frame-capture below.) Was it my imagination when, towards the end of the film, I suddenly detected in Minta (Lilian Hall-Davis) some of the look and mannerisms of Shirley MacLaine in The Trouble With Harry? For, let's be honest, Hitchcock's 'interest' in blondes was more a generic thing - blondes have traditionally been heroines of myth and melodrama and movies - whereas the spirited redhead or brunette, who has more than just outward qualities, was what Hitchcock really appreciated (including his wife Alma). Here's how Barr describes the film's happy ending: 'one of Hitchcock's sunniest ... Doubts about its sexual politics are allayed, even if not altogether dismissed, by the chastened humility with which [Sweetland] approaches [Minta], by the indication of her own recently discovered feelings for him, and by the sheer comic energy that has permeated the film, consistently placing and undercutting his complacency as local patriarch.' (p. 61) Hmm. To be concluded.\n\nOctober 15 - 2016\n\nReader, if you haven't watched Hitchcock's The Farmer's Wife (1928), you have missed a treat. Go and obtain a DVD or Blu-Ray copy soon, making sure that it runs closer to (just over) 90 minutes than to two hours. (The latter is too slow.) I recently re-read both the original Eden Phillpotts play (1916, revised 1924) and watched again Hitchcock's film, knowing that a new book, 'Classical Myth in Four Films of Alfred Hitchcock', by Mark Padilla, devotes a chapter to it. (My thanks to Professor Padilla for recent correspondence. His chapter, we noted, evokes both Hestia, the goddess of the hearth and family, and the famous 'Judgement of Paris', in which the Prince of Troy must judge between three beautiful goddesses as to which is 'the fairest' - allowing an ironic reading by Professor Padilla, given that the original three, or four, candidates to become Farmer Sweetland's new bride are all middle-aged, and showing it! The farmer is himself middle-aged but, as played by Jameson Thomas, well-presented, not least because his dutiful young housekeeper, Araminta, played by Lilian Hall-Davis, keeps a watchful eye on his doings and appearance.) Now, the play and film are set in Devon, and there is much rural imagery in the scenes and dialogue. Some of it is quite voluptuous, as when Sweetland's elderly neighbour Coaker speaks of pulling turnips 'as round and white as a woman's bosom'. In 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story', I noted that the Phillpotts play for a time 'held the record for the longest run in London, a record now held by Agatha Christie's thriller The Mousetrap. That seems apt, not just because Christie herself was a Devonian [and, I find, an admirer of Phillpotts's work, who regular visited his home], but because The Farmer's Wife has the loose-seeming shape of a typical Christie detective story, with its alarums and excursions and final disclosures. Indeed, the two centrepieces of The Farmer's Wife are a wedding breakfast [when Sweetland's daughter, Sibley, marries early in the film] and a tea party whose main plot function is to let us get to know the women on Sweetland's list of candidates, or \"suspects\".' Nonetheless, the film is a comedy as much as a drama full of local colour; indeed, at times I felt the comedy and incident seemed to overwhelm the original play rather than follow it. On the other hand, I was impressed by how much detail from the play the filmmakers included. Here's an example. In Act I, a passing reference is made by Thirza Tapper to her forthcoming tea party: 'I have everything planned. The famous glee-singers are coming from Plymouth. They will perform under the araucaria after tea is over.' (An araucaria is a kind of conifer, sometimes known as a monkey-puzzle tree.) Sure enough, in the film, the glee-singers do perform at the party (which corresponds to Act II of the play), and very prominently a monkey-puzzle tree hangs over them. (See frame-capture below.) The filmmakers have fun with the glee-singers, both when Churdles Ash (Gordon Harker), the rather surly bachelor manservant of Sweetland, whom Thirza has 'borrowed' for the occasion, doesn't recognise these non-locals when they arrive, and he treats them as gate-crashers; and when they are singing in the garden, and the hanging 'tentacles' of the monkey-puzzle tree threaten to obscure them, so that they must stand awkwardly in order to be seen. But in a film full of sight-gags, perhaps the funniest is when Thirza's slow-witted maid, Susan, melts the ices intended for the party guests, and comes to tell her mistress what has happened: as she enters the room she bursts into tears and, at the same time, inadvertently tilts the tray of ices so that a stream of liquid runs on the floor, almost as if it were 'tears' shed in sympathy with the distressed maid. (Half-a-dozen other things are happening at the same time, and the scene is one of near-pandemonium.) More next time.\n\n To read a description of Mark Padilla's book, go here: Myth in Four Films\n\n And, reader, if you haven't yet visited my essay (Part One) on Hitchcock & Catholicism, and on Psycho in particular, please take Professor Padilla's recommendation ('a profound essay ... I learned much from it') and click here: Psycho: Part One\n\nOctober 8 - 2016\n\nThe Hitchcock film Murder! (1930) has some puzzling aspects, or rather prints of it do, and I'm not referring to the fact there are two different 'official' versions of the film, one English-language, the other German-language, the latter called Mary. (Both of those were shot at the same time, with actors swapping places on the same sets.) Nor do I mean that English-language versions have different endings (that seems to be because there were both English- and USA-release prints). Rather, I mean that shots differ in different prints, and sometimes, too, the soundtrack changes. But I'm not going to go into detail about this. I merely wanted to observe that D.A. Miller, in his book 'Hidden Hitchcock' (2016), has now added a further puzzle or two. Notably, he points out that when the jury foreman calls for a ballot of 'guilty' and 'not guilty' votes, on pieces of paper, a single close-up shows the votes being counted and we can readily see that there are 8 'guilty' votes and 3 'not guilty' ones. Yet, surprisingly, when the foreman in a fresh shot announces the result, he says that there are 7 'guilty' votes and 3 'not guilty' - and proceeds to ask who are the two people who haven't voted? Miller doesn't really know what to make of this, referring to 'my inability to say much about it' (and noting that even William Rothman's detailed account of the film had not mentioned the seeming botch-up). Hmm. I can think of at least two reasons why it might have happened! First, the original intention may have been to simply have one person abstain from voting, with that person being the film's lead character, Sir John (Herbert Marshall), to whom the camera would promptly travel for an explanation. (The film as we have it holds back on showing Sir John in the juryroom for as long as possible, although we had earlier seen him with the other jurors in the courtroom.) In the existing film, we hear from the two non-voters (neither of whom is Sir John) and then from two of the 'not guilty' voters, before we finally reach Sir John, who has also voted 'not guilty'. In other words, Hitchcock may have decided to expand the detail in the scene, while not bothering to re-film the ballot ('Not many people will notice!). Alternatively, maybe he deliberately wanted to confuse viewers, perhaps as a distraction from the fact that so far Sir John has not been seen in the juryroom at all. Note that there is another confusing point (not picked up by Miller): the film's opening credits list twelve actors playing the jury, none of whom is Herbert Marshall (Sir John). Someone was larking around! But enough of that. Let's pass to Miller's last chapter, on The Wrong Man. (Btw, it is followed by a long Notes section at the back of the book which, frankly, may be the most interesting part of the book - as sometimes happens! - containing a lot of useful information, succinctly given.) Here, Miller makes rather too much (it seems to me) of such things as the publicity still for The Wrong Man that shows Hitchcock in the Bickford's restaurant early in the film (I have always believed that this represented what was going to be Hitchcock's cameo before he decided to appear in a special prologue instead - nothing that Miller says rules this out, I think). And then there's what Miller claims is another Hitchcock 'cameo' in the same film: see frame-capture below. It occurs in the trial scene near the end of the film when - as the witness called Mrs James is appearing - we twice spot (for a fraction of a second each time) someone in the very back row of the courtroom, at the level of Manny's chin, who may, or may not, be Hitchcock. But Miller is beside himself with excitement and self-congratulation - 'by a kind of miracle, I was granted a vision of it' (p. 143) - and is convinced that this is indeed Hitchcock! My reaction was less intense than Miller's. For one thing, I wanted to ask: 'Aren't you getting over-excited?' People are often spotting 'new' Hitchcock cameos. (Didn't Philip Kemp recently think he saw Hitchcock in the street in The Lady Vanishes?) For another thing, contrary to Miller, I'm convinced that even if this person in the back row is Hitchcock, he never intended the shot (and its recurrence, about 19 seconds later) to constitute a cameo like the ones we usually call Hitchcock cameos. It would not have been in the spirit and mood of The Wrong Man. However Miller does raise an interesting possibility. Perhaps the identical-seeming recurrence of the 'cameo' indicates that the whole background behind Manny, above the level of the back of his seat, was rear-projected, and the footage was looped. (But would even rear-projection have been in the spirit of The Wrong Man? Some of us doubt it!) Back to more substantial things next time.\n\nOctober 1 - 2016\n\nThank you, reader, for being patient after I missed last week's entry which would have concluded a brief series on To Catch a Thief. I'll do that now. The passing reference last time to Cornelia Parker's 'PsychoBarn' prompted me to say to friend Sarah N (who sent me the photo of it, above) that artists who pay homage to Psycho (like Douglas Gordon, with his installation '24 Hour Psycho') have almost certainly felt that film's hypnotic, almost visceral hold on audiences, and especially the effect on audiences of the creepy Bates Motel set. I used an illustration or two from To Catch a Thief to show how I thought Hitchcock does this sort of thing (coming back to Psycho at the end). I said that I had just watched the moment after Francie Stevens (Grace Kelly) has given a memorable goodnight kiss to John Robie (Cary Grant) in a corridor of the Carlton Hotel, and the camera tracks Robie back down the corridor, past Francie's mother's room, to a side-turning which leads to a balcony. Here, cued by an inflection in Lyn Murray's score, the mood suddenly changes. Robie proceeds to the balcony and goes out onto it, then looks sideways to the lit-up window of Mrs Stevens's room. By having the camera follow so close to Robie (there are some cuts for emphasis, including to an 'impossible' shot from outside the building, as Robie comes onto the balcony - but no matter), the viewer takes in with Robie the exact position and size of the room, almost as if we had 'cased the joint' ourselves. (A robbery will occur that very night, but not from Mrs Stevens's room - that comes later.) Similarly, I suggested, in Psycho we see the Bates Motel courtyard from so many different angles, that it enters into us, like a familiar habitat, so to speak. We have seen that there is a gap between two 'wings' of the courtyard (into which Norman disappears as Lila and Sam arrive), and eventually we will follow Lila into that gap so that we emerge behind the motel (where a broken-down jalopy is stored, alongside old mops and pails and crates). From here, when Lila looks up, we see a view of the Bates house that we have not had before, but the (subliminal) point is that we feel a visceral sensation of having got to know the whole premises, almost as if we had stayed at the motel ourselves - which makes us more sensitive to the shocking events still to come, as Lila continues her exploration. (To get this angle at all probably meant extra expense at set-building time, but Hitchcock knew that it was worth it.) But let's come back to To Catch a Thief. One item worth mentioning is that there is an 'echo' later in the film of Robie's investigation of the view from the Carlton Hotel balcony, when police chief Lepic, in fancy-dress at the Sanford villa, likewise goes onto a balcony and gazes sideways at the lit-up rooms as guests prepare to retire for the night. We can read his mind, and the scene needs to be only brief. (He suspects that 'Le Chat' will shortly be on the prowl again.) And now come back to near the start of the film. We first meet Robie's capable housekeeper, Germaine, when she comes onto a patio of Robie's villa and shakes a mop in front of a view across a splendid hillside of houses and gardens. As she returns inside, moving from left to right, the camera takes a low angle and tracks in the opposite direction, from right to left. That is to say, we first have an almost three-dimensional view through the patio arches, then as the camera keeps tracking left (see frame-capture below) we glimpse something of the elegance (including a well-furnished side room) that the interior of the house will further reveal. And the sense of a lived reality facilitated by the tracking camera anticipates some of the effects I have described above. But also - and here is perhaps the main reason for the low angle - we quickly sense something of the formidable quality of Germaine, as exemplified by her thick legs! (She will shortly act as Robie's accomplice when he makes a quick getaway from the police.) She was based on a real person. The author of the original novel, David Dodge, revealed that when the film of To Catch a Thief was released in France, 'she went to see it twenty-seven times. She didn't always sit through it until the final clinch, but she knew the early scenes, in which her namesake appeared and her cooking and loyalties were praised, frame by frame and word by word.'\n\nSeptember 24 - 2016\n\n[Humble apologies. An elderly friend asked me to keep her company today. I'll post final thoughts on To Catch a Thief next time. Meanwhile, Part One of my long essay on Hitchcock and Catholicism, incorporating an unorthodox analysis of Psycho, has been published on the 'Senses of Cinema' website: Psycho: Part One You might like to visit it.\n\nAnd, speaking of Psycho, another friend, Sarah N, in New York, has sent me a photo of a temporary installation located at the roof garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Entitled 'PsychoBarn', it was made by artist Cornelia Parker out of pieces of an old barn, and echoing both Edward Hopper's painting 'House by the Railroad' (1925) and the Bates house from Psycho. I'll share the photo with you: see below. And you can read more here: Psycho Barn KM]\n\nSeptember 17 - 2016\n\nA knee-jerk reaction by some people to To Catch a Thief might be to dismiss it as a homage to money and privilege, and thus an irresponsible, even obscene, indulgence by Hitchcock! That's a reason why I have in the two preceding posts referred to 'undercurrents' in the film, and especially to Danielle's line about her underprivileged friends who must 'work like idiots for a loaf of bread'. The day after the recent terrorist incident in Nice (locale of To Catch a Thief's flower-market scene, played as slapstick comedy), the BBC published a sobering background piece, \"Why jihadists stalk the French Riviera\". (You can read it here: jihadists stalk the French Riviera.) Its essence is that while the French Riviera continues to be a 'playground for the cosmopolitan elite', move a mile or two from Nice itself 'and you find bleak housing estates where disaffected youths of migrant origin are vulnerable to radical Islam'. A social worker is quoted: 'The kids are told that they are in a land of unbelievers, so that when they steal and attack people it is justifiable.' Implicit is how many of them already have a sense of grievance, no doubt much like poor kids in East London in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, who may have glimpsed or heard about the privileged lifestyles on display just a mile or so away; or like kids in the favelas - shanty towns - of Rio de Janeiro today, where street gangs of disaffected, even homeless, youths periodically flourish. This sort of contrast of the very rich and very poor is, then, not new: the young Hitchcock, raised in the East End, was almost certainly familiar with it, both from his travels up and down every bus route in London when he was a boy, and from his trips at that time to London's Covent Garden market with his fruiterer father. (The Nice flower market in To Catch a Thief almost certainly had associations in Hitchcock's mind with Covent Garden - which of course he would revisit in 1972, in Frenzy. Shades, in fact, of George Bernard Shaw's Cockney waif Elisa Doolittle selling posies to rich Covent Garden opera-goers in 'Pygmalion', 1913.) So here's my main point: that Hitchcock knew what he was doing, and was hardly showing a callous indifference to the underprivileged classes. Quite the contrary. While making a 'comedy' - or what Peter Bogdanovich calls a 'holiday' film - he was implicitly commenting on the irony of how the world is constituted, and probably always has been. (In 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story' I quote a theme that recurs in several Hitchcock films: what the philosopher Schopenhauer called 'temporal justice versus eternal justice', meaning the lack of perfect justice in just about any society that has ever been, as opposed to some fairy-tale kingdoms or philosophers' utopias, say.) The panning-shot of the ruined castle at Èze (see last time) carries both a simple reminder of mortality (the passage of years) and a supernumerary reminder that humans have always contended with each other, and been forced to defend whatever privileges they (temporarily) hold. A friend, Mike C, visiting Canada this week sent me an email from Quebec City, where I Confess (1953) was filmed, reminding me again that it's a fortress city, dating back to the time when the French and the British fought each other in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indeed the so-called Old Quebec (Vieux-Québec) has its own intact fortress, La Citadelle, that forms the centre-piece of the ancient ramparts, and is visible in I Confess. (But I'll share with you a different view sent by my friend: the house where Mr Vilette is killed by the sacristan Otto Keller, shown here being visited by tourists last week on a guided tour of the city. See below.) Similarly, Old Fort Point in Vertigo (1958) is just one of that film's reminders of ancient military preparedness and/or bloodshed, going back as far as the Spanish conquest and its genocide of the Indians. But I'll end on a lighter note this week. I mentioned the 'slapstick' of the Nice flower-market scene in To Catch a Thief. There are other slapstick moments, again involving the French police or 'flics'. Take a look at the moment near the start when the police stop their car, baffled, and get out to look around for where the car they have been following may have got to. Suddenly it speeds past them, so they have to pile back into their vehicle and resume the pursuit. Hitchcock emphasises the slapstick note by speeding up the film here. But he hasn't finished. The pursued car (supposedly containing Robie) has hardly gone past them than it is forced to come to a halt up the road - which is blocked by sheep. (Echoes of The 39 Steps, 1935.) The police car again gives chase and again, at a critical moment, Hitchcock speeds up the film, this time creating the comic impression of the car swerving to a sharp halt. Cut to a close-view of the other car. It doesn't contain Robie at all, but only his capable housekeeper, Germaine (later established as having been a Resistance member who once strangled a German general). Hitchcock probably wanted to shorten the scene for effect, so the speeded-up film has a pragmatic side. But the comedy is also clearly intended. (By contrast, a speeded-up moment in Topaz, 1969, is merely awkward.) To be concluded.\n\nSeptember 10 - 2016\n\nCastles and military ruins figure prominently at moments in several Hitchcock films, reminders of a troubled past (and contentious human nature). In the frame-capture below from To Catch a Thief, the camera has just panned from the viaduct at Èze to show the medieval hill town of that name and the ruined castle above it. A slightly different type of reminder is conveyed early in the film by the spectacular helicopter (and VistaVision) shots of homes clinging intrepidly to the cliffs above the Côte d'Azur near Cannes. In an imperfect and often unjust world (see last time), there may be no real winners, except the intrepid 'life force' itself. Nonetheless, the film suggests that a day of personal reckoning may come for each of us. Robie tells Hughson that 'one day' he'll be sorry he took an ashtray from a hotel. At the film's climax, the police chief Lepic sees Robie on the roof and remarks solemnly, 'He's where I always knew he'd be some day.' Of course, To Catch a Thief is a comedy, and Hitchcock said that '[i]t wasn't meant to be taken seriously'. Reader, you may believe that, or not! Something I noticed this time around was the moment when Robie slaps Danielle (Brigitte Auber) at her father's funeral, after she calls him a murderer. She is almost certainly putting on an act, for in fact she had accidentally killed her father herself with a blow from a wrench intended for Robie; and Robie's slap carries moral significance, marking a stage in his efforts to redeem himself in other people's eyes, and his own. (I think Melanie in The Birds follows a similar trajectory, and I disagree with a commentator who says the slap Melanie delivers to the hysterical mother who calls her 'evil' in the Tides Restaurant is an over-reaction.) Young Danielle comes off badly in the film, being finally exposed by Robie as his imitator in the recent series of jewel thefts, although her father's boss, restaurateur Bertani (Charles Vanel), is named as the mastermind behind the robberies. Danielle's sense of injustice (see last time) won't save her from a long stretch in gaol. The filmmakers had to change the ending of the novel, for obvious reasons. There, the police are left empty-handed after Robie takes pity on the very person he has done his best to expose: he (and two friends) help Danielle to escape. 'Afterwards he could not remember any conscious change of attitude in himself, from pursuer of a thief to the thief's ally ... It was not because she was someone he knew and liked, nor because of her sex. She was a thief, he was a thief. [Police commissaire] Oriol threatened them both.' Now, my thanks to several recent correspondents, all fans of To Catch a Thief. The film's climax, with its traditional costume-ball, is set in the fictional San[d]ford villa near Cannes, but as Alain K has reminded me, some filming was done at the real Castle of la Croix des Gardes, also near Cannes. Earlier this year it was put up for sale, and you can read more detail here: Cannes Hitchcock house (However, that's not where the real-life robbery that inspired David Dodge's novel took place: that happened next door to the house he rented for a while, near Golfe-Juan, a port along the coast.) Thanks, too, to Douglas F, who appreciated my comments last time on the film's cast. I liked his own comparison of Jessie Stevens to the Unsinkable Molly Brown! As Douglas writes: 'Jessie Royce Landis plays [the] part with panache - it really comes over well!' Lastly, thanks to Barry Wiley (he gives me permission to name him), who is currently writing a novel on Jack the Ripper and his era, 'Jack and the Thought Reader'. It should be out next year. Barry was (and may still be) an Associate of the Inner Magic Circle in London and once came close to meeting Cary Grant at the Magic Castle in Hollywood. Barry writes: 'I sat behind [Cary] one evening. He was there with his daughter (he was a member of the Board of Directors). There is a rule at the Castle that no autographs will be requested, so I just enjoyed his reactions to a moderately decent magic act. That was about a year before he died; he looked great and was very cordial.' (Barry's book, here: Thought Reader) More on To Catch a Thief next time.\n\nSeptember 3 - 2016\n\nTo Catch a Thief (1955) is a hugely sophisticated entertainment that acknowledges its privileged position. It wins most audiences over. In 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story' I argued for why the insouciant-seeming John Robie (Cary Grant), a former cat burglar, who never served his full gaol sentence, is nonetheless a hero: the film 'implies that in a world subject to chance, where Mrs Stevens can become a millionairess overnight while Robie's former comrades still 'work like idiots for a loaf of bread' (as Danielle says), his attitude may even be commendable and life-enhancing. Three films later [I added], The Wrong Man will put a more sombre slant on these matters.' However, there is a place for both films, surely. I don't understand why 'Variety' called To Catch a Thief 'pretentious'. I find it to be, in essence, an honest picture of a set of people who have 'made it' thus far and are capable of enjoying themselves while they continue to face what life throws at them. In a sense, this is Hitchcock's own world - as well as that of the characters played by Grant, Jessie Royce Landis, Grace Kelly. Robie's current problem, of course, is that someone is imitating the distinctive style and methods that he had used as 'Le Chat', thus jeopardising his current freedom, which may in any case not be the total freedom he pretends. (In turn, one easily sees here an allegory of a rival director imitating Hitchcock's style and methods and threatening to supplant him.) Mrs Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis) is a wealthy widow, yes, but feeling pressures of her own, not least that she misses her (working-class) husband; the novel by David Dodge gives other details, such as how nowadays she is '\"always picking up imitation dukes who borrow money from her and forget to pay it back; or try to steal her jewels\"'. That's Francie speaking; she's played in the film by Grace Kelly. And Francie, too, has her own problems: most obviously, she must look after her mother as much as the reverse, and in the novel admits to sometimes feeling '\"more like the mother than the daughter\"'. (Both women are exceptional creatures, it almost goes without saying - and there you have further links to both Robie and, again, Hitchcock. All of Hitchcock's pictures, it is often argued, are like self-portraits, so much of himself did he put into those films.) Now, I want to begin to show why To Catch a Thief is 'hugely sophisticated' and works for most audiences. Remember that Jessie Stevens is nouveau-riche, and is currently trying - with an obvious measure of success - to inhabit the Riviera lifestyle that she feels right for her daughter. Here's a scene, and dialogue, that perhaps only Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes, and the four actors, could have got away with. At a table are Mrs Stevens , Francie, Robie (posing as 'Jack Burns', a 'lumberman' from Portland, Oregon), and insurance agent Hughson (John Williams). Despite a protest from Francie ('Oh mother, please ...'), Jessie launches into an account of how wealth came suddenly to her and Francie after Mr Stevens died. Apparently the family had owned a ranch, but it didn't even have indoor plumbing. As Mrs Stevens puts it, there was only a 'little thing out back' (see frame-capture below). Which prompts her next line: 'Poor Jeremiah. He'll never know how close he came to 20 million barrels of oil.' Cut to Robie's reaction - call it half-stifled mirth, but Grant does it just right, naturally - observed by Francie, who smiles placidly (befitting her quietness all evening so far). And that description will have to do. Yes, basically it's a lavatory joke, in a Hitchcock film! (Remember, Psycho was still five years away!) So where's the sophistication, exactly? Obviously not in the joke itself but rather in the general cordiality, where everyone at the table knows what has been conveyed but carries on unruffled, and enjoying themselves. Jessie immediately proceeds, in her own special way, to extol the merits of bourbon over champagne, and it's filmed beautifully (I mean that literally), her image reflected in a door-pane behind her. So this, I would say, is an instance of Hitchcock's direction at its purest: basically, direction of the actors who show us how to feel good! But it needs an undercurrent. Stephen Ronan (whom I've quoted here before) has mentioned a comparable instance, a speech by the director. Hitchcock: 'With the help of television, murder should be brought into the home where it rightly belongs. [Think about that, reader.] After all, I'm sure you will agree that murder can be so much more charming and enjoyable, even for the victim, if the surroundings are pleasant and the people involved are ladies and gentlemen like yourselves.' Ronan's comment: 'With that statement, Hitchcock shocked many in his Film Society audiences at Lincoln Center.' To be continued.\n\nAugust 27 - 2016\n\n[Sorry everyone. Work calls. Back next time. I'll just share with you for now two recommendations from Bill K in Los Angeles: 'two riffs on AH's single-set films'. The first is 10 Cloverfield Lane, produced by J.J. Abrams. Bill writes: '[it] was a surprise hit here and received wide distribution'. The other is the French Taj Mahal, directed by Bill's friend Nicholas Saada. Bill: '[Saada] had visited Mumbai and was horrified by the terrorist attacks [on the famous hotel] when they happened later. His heroine locks herself in the bathroom of her hotel suite to escape marauding terrorists, who we hear but never see. It's intercut with real footage shot in Mumbai and her vertiginous escape to an adjoining room, which was filmed on a soundstage. Hitchcock references abound.' There are trailers for both these films on YouTube. KM]\n\nAugust 20 - 2016\n\nWe have been talking about Rear Window and, in particular, its 'flashbulbs' climax. Now, I noted (see August 6, above) the ingenious way in which Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes took partial inspiration from Cornell Woolrich's novella, which doesn't have that exact scene but does refer to the 'flash' of a gun-shot and the nick-of-time arrival of Jeff's detective friend, which the novella calls a 'camera-finish'. What I didn't adequately comment on is the part played in the novella's scene by the bust of an Enlightenment philosopher. Woolrich gives the reader two names to choose from - the bust is that of either Rousseau or Montesquieu - to make his point without actually using the word 'Enlightenment'. And you sense his sardonic attitude to the usefulness of abstract philosophy, enlightened or otherwise, when a life-and-death situation arrives: might as well put that bust to practical use! In turn, I suggested last time (in comparing the film's climax to the one of H.G. Wells's \"Through a Window\") that the filmmakers themselves further sensed that we are all relatively powerless when it comes to pitting our limited, subjective selves against a world that may (strictly speaking, will) eventually turn on us: after all, death comes as the end, doesn't it? So there is an allegory about complacency at work here, and the film's 'flashbulbs' climax is its inspired expression. Here now are some related thoughts. Robin Wood, in an excellent documentary included on the Rear Window DVD (excellent not least because he figures in it) makes the point that people build 'facades' around themselves to protect them from 'the unpredicatability and chaos of life', i.e., 'all the things we don't understand and don't know, not simply in the world but within ourselves'. For what it's worth, the notion of civilisation as inherently fragile and how 'chaos and anarchy constitute [the world's] true moral reality' (Alan Sandison) was widespread in several authors at the turn of the 19th century and beyond: for example, in Rudyard Kipling, Joseph Conrad, John Buchan. (It also resembles Schopenhauer's notion of the blind cosmic Will, which was particularly influential at that time.) So very conceivably Hitchcock absorbed it from his reading of the authors mentioned, or from his deep acquaintance with movements like Symbolism. But I also mentioned last time another of Hitchcock's favourite authors, E.T.A. Hoffmann (1766-1822), and how his story \"The Sandman\" has striking generic similarities to Rear Window. In 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story' I give a partial synopsis: 'The student Nathanael becomes fixated on a house opposite his own occupied by Professor Spallanzani and his beautiful \"daughter\" called Olympia. Watching the house through binoculars, the student quite loses interest in his regular girlfriend, Klara. One day he goes to the house and at last encounters Olympia - who turns out to be just a life-sized doll ...' And I note that Sigmund Freud was fascinated with Hoffmann's tale, which he analysed in terms of 'castration anxiety', which certainly applies to Rear Window, so that Jeff's eventual confrontation with Thorwald may be further seen as that of the Oedipal 'son' with his 'father'. Also: 'the film's symbolism is [fitting], for the assault on a person's eyes constitutes a further reference to \"castration\" (cf Spellbound)'. Hmm. Jeff survives the encounter, and Thorwald is taken into custody, but each spectator must individually decide the significance of, for example, Jeff's new broken leg! (See frame-capture below.) (I have said elsewhere that Jeff is arguably 'defeated' in another sense, for he's like a David Lean figure who would, if he could, continue to travel the world professionally, with a woman waiting for him at each foreign destination! A 2009 article in 'Quarterly Review of Film and Video', by Andrew A. Erish, \"Reclaiming Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", makes a similar point: Jeff at the end of Rear Window has been 'robbed of his primary passion as a globetrotting photojournalist in search of truth and adventure'.) Finally, recall that when Thorwald enters Jeff's room, he asks, 'What do you want from me?' - to which Jeff has no answer. As Hitchcock put it to Peter Bogdanovich, 'What could [Jeff] say?' Jeff's impulses in pursuing Thorwald are complex and, finally, less rational than absolutely basic, like the Oedipal impulse or a native curiosity that most of us share. This week I was (re-)reading John Buchan's 'The Power-House' (1913) whose hero, Leithen, becomes excited as soon as he sniffs a mystery: 'I began to get really keen, for every man at the bottom of his heart believes that he is a born detective.' (Chapter 2) QED?!\n\nAugust 13 - 2016\n\nOne of Hitchcock's favourite authors was H.G. Wells (1866-1946) - for a start, he owned a complete set of Wells's works - and he would have quickly spotted the indebtedness of Cornell Woolrich's 1942 novella \"It Must Have Been Murder\" (later renamed \"Rear Window\") to Wells's 1894 short story \"At a Window\" (renamed the following year \"Through a Window\" - which is the name it goes by to this day). Even considered in generic terms, the several parallels or overlaps of Wells's story and Hitchcock's film are striking - with obviously some mediation by Woolrich's story! (Note: other interesting similarities, generic or otherwise, to Hitchcock's Rear Window are found in E.T.A. Hoffmann's 1815 tale \"The Sandman\" - recall that Hitchcock also owned a complete set of the German author's works - and its ballet version, Léo Delibes's 1870 'Coppelia'. Sigmund Freud was fascinated by the Hoffmann story and analysed it in his famous essay on \"The Uncanny\", especially in terms of 'castration anxiety'.) But we'll concentrate for now on the Wells story and how it builds to a climax that is in some ways close to that of Hitchcock's film. Let's start at the beginning. The story is set near London and opens: 'After his legs were set, they carried Bailey into the study and put him on a couch before the open window. There he lay, a live - even a feverish man down to the loins, and below that a double-barrelled mummy swathed in white wrappings. He tried to read, even tried to write a little, but most of the time he looked out of the window.' What Bailey can see - and incidentally we are told little about him or how he came to break his legs - is a view of the Thames. 'Up and down the river, all day long, things were passing ... Perhaps the river was quietest of a morning or late at night. One moonlight night some people drifted down singing, and with a zither playing - it sounded very pleasantly across the river.' In short, the expanse of the river anticipates the film's courtyard, and both Wells and Hitchcock are responsive to the varying moods and sounds. Wells continues: 'Then one afternoon, the captain of a slow-moving barge began a quarrel with his wife as they came into sight from the left, and had carried it to personal violence before he vanished behind the window-frame to the right.' (Note reminders that the reader is looking with Bailey through a window.) Is this the germ of Woolrich's novella? It seems likely - although the Wells story has a different 'villain', an aggrieved Malay worker from up-river who has run amok and who, armed with a kris (curved dagger), will cross the river and invade Bailey's room through the window. But at first Bailey, like Jeff, is unaware of the threat that is coming for him. He first has two visitors, a Mrs Green, who brings him his meals, and a friend, Wilderspin, to whom he converses. '\"Funny,\" he said, \"how these people [passing on the river] come from all points of the compass - from Oxford and Windsor, from Asia and Africa - and gather and pass opposite the window just to entertain me.\"' One thinks of what Hitchcock told Truffaut, that Rear Window would not have worked without its 'cross-section' of people in the apartments around the courtyard. In both cases (Bailey's and Jeff's), the invalid resorts to thinking that the people are there for him, to provide a show - which serves as a reminder of how self-deceiving we can all be, including readers and film viewers. (Compare the observation last time about an audience being almost hypnotised into 'agreeable passivity'.) In both cases, too, the final climax works to expose such a deception! In the film, Jeff tries to fight off Thorwald with camera flashes - providing mere tokens of reality (see frame-capture below) - but only succeeds in slowing things down, which is perhaps all that any of us can do from our subjective positions! In Wells's story, that is precisely the sort of effect aimed for. Bailey hurls medicine bottles at his attacker. A writer on Wells describes the scene thus: 'When the intruder advances into the room the effect is of a film seen in slow motion. \"It was Bailey's impression that the Malay took about an hour to get his second leg over the rail. The period that elapsed before the sitting position was changed to a standing one seemed enormous ...\" The illusion of time standing still reinforces the dream-like texture of the narrative and recalls the endless pursuits of nightmare ... indeed, the story as a whole possesses a cinematic quality heightened by its central motif of a window looking out on reality.' (J. Hammond, 'H.G. Wells and the Short Story', 1992) (I am grateful to the late Leslie Sheperd, who was an associate of film historian Liam O'Leary, for first drawing my attention to Wells's \"Through a Window\".) To be concluded.\n\nAugust 6 - 2016\n\nThe audience of a Hitchcock film, such as Rear Window (which we began discussing last time), is conditioned, even hypnotised, to adopt a certain state of mind, roughly one of agreeable passivity. It may be worth repeating something that screenwriter John Michael Hayes said when I once had the pleasure of interviewing him. (You'll find the same story in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story'.) He had felt that some of Hitchcock's American films had been relatively cold and humourless, and thus not as engaging of the audience as they might have been, mentioning The Paradine Case (1947) as an example. So for his first film for Hitchcock, whom he admired, he sought to break down audience resistance - even a certain hostility - from almost the first scene. That is why he had the no-nonsense nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), come upon Jeff with the words, 'The New York sentence for a peeping tom is six months in the workhouse!' And soon follow this up with her anecdote about how she had nursed an auto industry magnate and had predicted the stock market crash of '29: 'When General Motors has to go to the bathroom ten times a day, the whole country's ready to let go.' Hayes explained: that's the sort of line that makes an audience laugh out loud and prepare to enjoy themselves. (Somewhere I have heard it said that a stand-up comedian in a nightclub or cabaret knows that he must get the audience on-side in the first few minutes or he'll be having an uphill battle with them for the rest of the evening! Same idea!) Audiences traditionally enjoy settling into their seats and being happily passive - that is, not bored (they can be that at home) - while the comedian or film proceeds to regale or entertain them. In this sense, they relinquish the metaphorical limelight for a time, and appreciatively watch the show from the darkened room or auditorium. Well, something of that metaphor informs Rear Window (see last time), and may also account for why, in Strangers on a Train (1950), there's a moment when the amusing, normally extroverted villain Bruno (Robert Walker) at a carnival momentarily forgets himself and has to suddenly retreat from the light back into shadow - on this occasion he doesn't want to be recognised. (But he'll end up making a spectacle of himself anyway, as Hitchcock's, and Fritz Lang's, villains often did.) A variant on the idea is Hitchcock's rather tongue-in-cheek scene in Family Plot, 1976, where a whole congregation watch their Archbishop kidnapped in front of them and seem momentarily paralysed: Hitchcock drew an analogy with people in a real church or cathedral - or mosque or synagogue? - by saying, 'They're just so religiously solemn!' Reader, do you see the connection to Rear Window? As I suggested to my correspondent, RH, last week, Hitchcock's audience is agreeably hypnotised by the film's blend of comedy and suspense, and by its appeal to subliminal factors, such as the analogy with the audience's own collective mindstate, resembling that of a dreamer, who may tell herself, 'This is my dream, yet I can't intervene!' So at one point the very actors seem to act out our powerlessness - or what Siegfried Kracauer would call the viewer's state of 'lowered consciousness' - and we feel only its rightness rather than question it, although if it had continued for more than a few seconds (if the police had been delayed) then the spell might have been broken, as it must have been for RH (on a re-viewing?) who wondered why Jeff doesn't immediately call out to distract the villain, who has grabbed hold of the terrified Lisa in his apartment, 'Hey Thorwald, the police are coming!' Timing is (nearly) all, and Hayes and Hitchcock understood this very well. Now, next time I want to talk about the same film's remarkable 'flashbulbs' climax (see frame-capture below). In the space remaining here this week, I'll just mention how ingeniously the filmmakers were inspired by, and adapted, the corresponding climax of Cornell Woolrich's 1942 novella, which is rather different. Chiefly, knowing that Thorwald is coming to get him, the immobilised Jeff in his wheelchair resorts to a stalling tactic (he has phoned his detective friend to come and rescue him) by turning out the lights in his apartment, then setting up a dummy of himself in the wheelchair whose head is just visible above a blanket - and is really a sculpted clay head of an Enlightenment philosopher (Rousseau or Montesquieu - Jeff isn't sure), while meanwhile leaning to one side as far as he can. Sure enough, Thorwald, armed with a gun, is fooled. In the darkness, he fires blindly: 'The flash of the shot lit up the room for a second' and the bust is shattered. But now the detective arrives just in time - what Jeff calls a 'camera-finish' (my italics).\n\nJuly 30 - 2016\n\nSurely the most terrifying moment in Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) - even more than the film's 'flashbulbs' ending - occurs when Jeff (James Stewart) and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) watch helplessly as Lisa (Grace Kelly) is caught by suspected wife-killer Thorwald (Raymond Burr) searching his apartment, across the courtyard from Jeff's, for incriminating evidence (namely, Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring). Hitchcock proudly told the story about Joseph Cotten's wife at the Rear Window premiere: as Thorwald advances on Lisa and she screams out, 'Jeff, Jeff!', Mrs Cotten here turned to her husband and said, 'Oh do something, do something!' But how plausible is this moment - and/or does such a consideration matter? A correspondent this week, RH, to whom I am most grateful for his thoughts, told me that he has always been 'puzzled' by why Jeff (or Stella) doesn't respond by calling out loudly to distract Thorwald (who has now grabbed Lisa), 'Thorwald, the police are coming!' Instead we hear Jeff murmur impotently, 'Stella, what'll we do?' (See frame-capture below.) And for the space of several seconds, Thorwald continues to threaten Lisa as Stella and Jeff watch powerlessly (as it seems). Then the police arrive, having been already summoned by Jeff because Stella had spotted Miss Lonelyhearts, on the floor below Thorwald's apartment, preparing to overdose on sleeping pills - only the prescient Jeff, concerned for Lisa, had seized the opportunity to tell the police, 'A man is assaulting a woman at 125 West Ninth Street, second floor.' (For some earlier thoughts on screenwriter John Michael Hayes's ingenuity in getting characters out of tight corners, see entries on The Trouble With Harry above, especially July 2.) The fact remains, my correspondent is right: those several seconds are, strictly speaking, implausible. Nonetheless, I believe that the canny Hitchcock, with Hayes, knew exactly what he was doing, and could get away with. That is, he knew that most viewers (like Mrs Cotten) wouldn't notice the implausibility - for several reasons. For a start, hadn't Hitchcock once boasted, 'A film should be stronger than reason'? Also, hadn't he said, 'It [the film] should look real but never be real'? The fact is, there is something deliberately 'irrational', even dream-like, about Rear Window, right from its opening credits, when three bamboo blinds appear to raise themselves. Further, Hitchcock was a firm believer in the importance of a film's 'unity of emotion' (see entry on Dial M for Murder in the famous Hitchcock/Truffaut interview book). A certain hypnotic quality is thus activated, reinforced by other subliminal factors not the least of which is the film's use of glamorous stars (themselves contributing an 'impressive', if 'unreal', element to the story). Note that Jeff's broken leg keeps him relatively passive throughout the film (Lisa is decidedly its most proactive character) in a metaphor for the film's audience that many commentators (e.g., Jean Douchet) have pointed out. In turn, note that the audience of Rear Window is certainly unable to intervene in the action - even less than a theatre or opera or ballet audience can influence the performers onstage. Accordingly, the moment described above effectively sees Jeff and Stella being surrogates for the film's audience, and the film is so scripted. And I would say that Jeff 'keeps quiet' here (rather than calling out to Thorwald, which would be more 'rational') for several reasons: (1) it is consistent with his situation and general demeanour to this point (he is still whispering, surely needlessly, when he phones private detective Doyle minutes later, after the police have taken Lisa from Thorwald's apartment); (2) it keeps the 'unity of emotion' going (a different 'unity of emotion' prevails in The Birds - literally a more strident film - where characters in the Tides Bar do indeed call out from a window to warn the salesman against lighting a match near a petrol-spill!); (3) it generates excitement and suspense, which is what Hitchcock wanted; and (4) as I say, it is a subliminal metaphor for the audience's own powerlessness at this point (which has been further conditioned by the film as a whole, in keeping with Hitchcock's sense of the audience's general condition and unspoken challenge, 'Okay Hitch, you're in charge, entertain us!'). Besides, as I remarked to RH, don't we attend a movie in roughly the same spirit as Samuel Coleridge's famous remark about 'that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith'?! (For more on that topic, click here: Suspension of Disbelief)\n\nJuly 23 - 2016\n\nSomething different this time, occasioned by regular correspondent Martin P telling me that he watched Henry Hathaway's realist House on 92nd Street (1945), loosely based on the Duquesne spy ring case, and in which a memory artist is employed by the spies to smuggle information past security guards - a likely borrowing from Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935). But had such a thing happened in real life? Neither Martin nor I knew of any. What I was able to note included the following. That 'Mr Memory' in Hitchcock's film is based on a stage and music hall performer named 'Datas' (Englishman William Bottle) whose memoirs were published in the early 1930s (as far as I can tell) by Wright & Brown, London - and may thus have helped inspire the inclusion of the character in the film. (The Cromwell Road brains trust who worked with screenwriter Charles Bennett on the early stages of several of the 1930s thrillers were alert to just such stimuli they found in books, newspaper articles, other movies, and anecdotes.) But also, that the Hitchcock film's climax in which Mr Memory is shot while performing onstage may have been inspired by the climax of Fritz Lang's Spione (1928) whose villain, Haghi - dressed as a clown - dies onstage. In turn, Haghi's clown act was taken by Lang from real life, being modelled on the famous Grock in Berlin. Now, it will be useful to note some of what we know about Datas/ William Bottle from his memoirs ('Memory by DATAS') and other sources. He was born in 1875 in Newnham, Kent, where his father was a shoe repairer. Growing up, he had a succession of jobs, eventually being employed at the Crystal Palace Gas Works. But his prodigious memory must have been apparent from his teenage years, at least. In Chapter VI of his memoirs, he recalls that when the famous showman Phineas Barnum came to England in 1890, Bottle approached him for work: 'I thought he might take me on as a sort of freak, for even at this early age I had mastered most of the dates of all the important events in the world.' But Barnum told the youth that he was too young and should come back when Barnum returned to England in a year or two, '[when] I'll give you the engagement of your life'. However, Barnum died in Connecticut in 1891, and for a time Bottle kept working at the gas works. It was ten years before another entrepreneur 'discovered' him, and his stage career took off. As Datas, he appeared across England and went around the world - he visited Australia twice. Always, he insisted that questions from the audience should be brief and factual, although he was happy to elaborate on his answers. For example, if he were asked, 'When was Big Ben opened at Westminster?', he would, in addition to the actual date (1859), include other items of interest concerning Westminster and Big Ben. And invariably he would conclude, 'Am I right, sir?' (Sound familiar?) Of especial interest (also in Chapter VI) is the fact that for a while Bottle was friendly with both the infamous Harley Crippen and his ill-fated wife, known as 'Belle Elmore', who performed in the chorus-line at music halls where Datas was one of the principal acts. Indeed, Datas's memoirs seem to contain information that never emerged at Crippen's trial for murder where, although eventually convicted, he impressed many observers. (Filson Young, reporting on the Crippen trial, wrote: 'everyone who came in contact with him from his trial to his death - and some of them were fairly hardened prison officials - looked upon him not only with respect, but with something like affection'. Which may explain the tone of the extraordinarily moving 1935 manhunt novel by Ernest Raymond, based on the Crippen case, 'We, the Accused', which Hitchcock hoped to film.) According to Datas's memoirs, Belle Elmore towards the end often wanted to leave her philandering husband but not only did he threaten to beat her but he forced her to play a badger game whereby she would encourage the attentions of wealthy men knowing that Crippen would then blackmail them for being in a compromising situation with his wife. Finally, let's return to House on 92nd Street. The frame-capture below shows FBI man Briggs (Lloyd Nolan) about to arrest Manhattan Project employee Charles Roper for complicity in espionage. As played by veteran Canadian actor Gene Lockhardt, Roper looks inoffensive enough; the film 'explains' his prodigious memory ability by noting that he was a chess player who could carry 14 games in his head simultaneously. The film's producer Louis de Rochemont (of the famous 'March of Time' newsreels) insisted that real locations and actual newsreel footage be included wherever possible. Accordingly, the film ends with shots of the actual Duquesne spy ring (including Duquesne himself) being brought into police headquarters to be charged. Worth a look, especially as some of the film's shots almost certainly influenced Hitchcock's The Wrong Man (1957).\n\nJuly 16 - 2016\n\nOne of the sight-gags in The Trouble With Harry, we noted last time, involves a contrast of scales: a small tugboat dwarfed by a gigantic ocean liner. In fact, the film is full of such contrasts, which Hitchcock intended and saw as exemplary. In Marnie, he invoked a passage from Emerson: 'So nigh is grandeur to our dust/ So near is God to man.' Of Harry, he said that its contrasts might 'raise the commonplace in life to a higher level'. The characters are frequently seen amidst autumnal New England landscapes (with some impressive cloud formations), perhaps passing a row of tall trees stretching the length of the hillside. As early as the film's credits-sequence, visual contrasts are evident: see the frame-capture below. As the continuous left-to-right tracking shot ends, the artist's impression of Harry's corpse looms within the frame, dwarfing both birds and trees. The director's credit overlays this reference to the salutary presence of death. It almost seems to imply that Harry and Hitchcock are stand-ins for each other, with a message to impart. What could that be? Well, as noted earlier, the tone of Harry was transferred to the ten years of television shows (AHP/AHH) that Hitchcock hosted, and in whose wraparounds he invariably appeared. There, very often, he seemed to make light of murder and death. But surely the ultimate effect on the viewer was like reverse psychology: to emphasise the intrinsic value of human life, or all life, for that matter. Which is what both the novel (by Jack Trevor Story) and Hitchcock's film of Harry are decidedly about: what Ed Sikov (paraphrasing the film's artist, Sam Marlowe) calls facilitating 'the ongoing life-force'. ('Laughing Hysterically: American Screen Comedy of the 1950s', 1994, p. 167) In a way, Harry is a companion film to Rope (1948), which also centred on a dead body, but whose central characters - Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger), if not their naive mentor Rupert (James Stewart) - are more evil-minded than Harry's, by far. The central characters of Rope are seriously perverted; those of Harry are merely unthinking opportunists. (For example, watch Sam after he discovers Harry's corpse: he starts to run down the hillside - presumably to report his find to the authorities - then turns and comes back to begin calmly sketching the dead man's face.) So the tone of Harry is quite different from Rope's, even if the ultimate message is similar. Rupert, basically a good man, finally denounces the two murderers: 'Did you think you were God, Brandon?', and fires shots out the window to attract the police to the apartment. (Harry's body will finally be laid out afresh on the hillside, in the knowledge that young Arnie will find it and the authorities duly summoned.) Also, a lesson about the relativity of values is common to both films. Rupert had served in the recent World War and been wounded, gaining a limp that may imply he is now impotent. He thus has good reason for grievance, and his teaching of Nietzsche may be a consequence. Indeed he may seriously question why nations may kill millions with impunity, but individuals be held to account for a single murder. It takes him the length of the film to see a possible answer to that question. (But Bruno, in Strangers on a Train, just three years later, is not convinced. 'What's a life or two, Guy?' he asks his naive 'double', played by Farley Granger - who appears flummoxed for an answer.) If the truth be told, the 'values' on display in The Trouble With Harry, and then, arguably, in the wraparounds of the Hitchcock television shows, could almost be labelled 'nihilistic' - except that I happen to disagree with Rohmer and Chabrol, quoted by Sikov, who allege that Harry (along with the wartime Lifeboat) contains Hitchcock's 'most misanthropic point of view'. (p. 164) That is surely to miss the high degree of compassion, and humanity, that Harry manifests, for those who can see them. I'll end, then, by quoting from another English novel, one of Hitchcock's favourites, 'Love and Mr Lewisham' (1900) by H.G. Wells. The speaker is the hypocrite Chaffery, but Wells sees fit to allow him his astute reasoning: 'salvation is not in the nature of things, but whatever salvation there may be is in the nature of man.' (Chapter 28)\n\nJuly 9 - 2016\n\nContinuing our thoughts about The Trouble With Harry (1955). Re its 'Englishness', we have already invoked 'nonsense' authors like Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. We also noted that the novel's author, Jack Trevor Story, was a Londoner. Interestingly, Peter Ackroyd observes that many 'Cockney Visionaries' (he includes artist/caricaturist William Hogarth in that category) often compared their city to a prison. And even William Wordsworth is cited because he described London's citizens as 'Dreaming of nought beyond the prison wall'. Accordingly, let's think of Harry as a 'visionary' work. But, yes, it is full of sleight-of-hand and trompe-l'il in which the the swiftness of the camera and situations stops us from looking too closely at the 'nonsense'. The important thing is to catch the right spirit! (Even the business with a yawning cupboard door is as much an induced distraction for the audience as it is suggestive of the Captain's over-active conscience or symbolic of a metaphysical 'emptiness' behind appearances à la the mysterious green door in August Strindberg's 1901 'A Dream Play'.) This time I want to start by looking at the splendid scene in which Miss Gravely (Mildred Natwick) accompanies Captain Wiles (Edmund Gwenn) to his lakeside cottage, which he describes (pretentiously, as we'll learn) as 'just an old salt's snug anchorage' - and is initially embarrassed by noting that he has forgotten to remove from view his undergarments that he had hung out to air. (Here, Herrmann's jaunty music pauses, as if shocked! It will pause again later to allow Miss Gravely to reveal that she has her own reason for embarrassment, the fact that she believes she killed Harry Worp.) The getting-to-know-you early part of the scene is punctuated by sight-gags, not all of them obvious. Now, in the frame-capture below, Miss Gravely has finally got around to declaring that she hit Harry with the heel of her hiking-shoe after he - acting strangely - attacked her; and she declares that she wants the matter all cleared up. More on that in a moment. But note a couple of visual details. On the left is the full-bosomed ship's figurehead on which the Captain had leaned nonchalantly as he stated, 'I'm a man who can recognise the human qualities in a woman.' And on the right is another 'nautical' object, a framed picture of an ocean liner. Only, the real reason for the picture's being on the Captain's wall is certainly the fact that - if you look closely - it shows the (dwarfed) tugboat that the Captain once skippered, and on which (he'll confess) 'we never went more than a mile offshore'. So much for his much-boasted maritime adventures - with the just-mentioned gag (like certain lines in Psycho) only becoming resonant on later viewings of the film. Actually, as I wrote in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story', just about everyone in Harry, from the youngest upwards, is an opportunist, and the more human for it! Let's look at Miss Gravely for a moment. Here I'm grateful to correspondent DF who during the week told me that both Miss Gravely and the Captain reminded him of real people of a certain generation, and which Hitchcock (and Hayes) had got so right, as those people definitely 'existed in the 1950s still'. DF isn't at all offended by the sight-gag of Miss Gravely seemingly doing all the digging of Harry's grave, as there were hints earlier in the film that the Captain isn't perfect - commensurate with his capacity to tell white lies about himself. (And of course he has already dug and un-dug Harry's grave at least once.) Miss Gravely was once a nurse, one gathers. But for all her likely high degree of altruism, one sees that she can be a manipulator - an opportunist - when necessary. In keeping with the film's swift-moving aspect, notice that the audience once again, at the Captain's cottage, hardly has time to spot just how Miss Gravely suddenly directs matters once she sees that she has an exonerating reason for having struck Harry (that he must already have been half-crazed). With little consideration of others - notably Jennifer, who had earlier hit Harry on the head with a milk bottle - she tricks the Captain into agreeing to exhume Harry for the authorities to find. (Miss Gravely: 'Don't you agree?' Brief pause, as the Captain hesitates. 'I thought you would.') In other words, the filmmakers needed Harry to be dug up again at this point - to keep the film's running gag going - so they just hastened things along (an old 39 Steps principle, if we're honest). Concluded next time (probably).\n\nJuly 2 - 2016\n\nThe Trouble With Harry is like one, extended, good-natured chuckle. Even the artist Sam's dismissal of 'city people' as 'little people - people with hats on' is primarily meant to put Mrs Wiggs ('Wiggy') at her ease, rather than criticise the 'Wiggs Emporium' for not returning super dividends to its shareholders this year. Sam is himself indebted to the Emporium for its relaxed, laissez-faire way of doing business (buy literally half a pack of cigarettes at a time and pay when you can, or when one of your paintings gets sold). Sam's line always reminds me of Proust - 'Allow me to furnish the interior of my head as I please and I will wear a hat like everybody else's' - only Sam is happy to forgo the city, and hats, almost totally. He is otherwise sprucely-dressed (this being a Hitchcock film!), and,"
