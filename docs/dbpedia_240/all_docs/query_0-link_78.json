        "text": "Welcome to your guide for all the secret genre and category codes on Netflix in 2022. Below, we’ve compiled the most comprehensive list of hidden genre codes, content hubs, and frequently asked questions about category codes that can help unlock “hidden content” on Netflix. We have listed well over 4,100 secret codes on Netflix.\n\nNetflix genre codes, often referred to as “secret codes,” enable users to refine their searches into specific categories. Navigating Netflix can be challenging, as most regions now have well over 6,000 titles.\n\nHere is your ultimate guide on how Netflix category codes work and how to use them. We will also share some of our favorite categories to jumpstart your new Netflix discovery journey.\n\nHow to Use Netflix Category Codes\n\nHaving explored the benefits of using Netflix category codes, let’s examine how to use them effectively. As the title suggests, Netflix categories utilize IDs. You can use these IDs on the Netflix website to help filter your results.\n\nTo access a category page, you’ll need to type in the code manually or use the links provided below. Note that this is only possible using a web browser, from which you can then add items to your queue.\n\nYou can also type these codes into your TV device.\n\nIn the above example, we used the genre code 2787344, which directs us to the list of award-winning directors’ movies on Netflix.\n\nYou can also type a URL directly into your web browser:\n\nnetflix.com /browse/genre/INSERTNUMBER\n\nYou can find allocated categories on individual titles, too. You’ll see a list of genres assigned to the title by bringing up the title card and clicking on details. All these are clickable and lead directly to the genre page. Clicking on cast members and directors will also take you to their other works.\n\nPersonalized Category Codes\n\nIn addition to the number codes listed below, Netflix also has dedicated lists tailored to your preferences.\n\nChances are you’ve already seen these rows within your Netflix app, but you can also navigate to them directly using the following links:\n\nContinue Watching Page – An expanded list of everything you’ve been watching recently.\n\nGems for You – Designed to highlight hidden gems that are likely to interest you based on your viewing history.\n\nTrending Now – A page showing all the titles that are currently trending.\n\nNew and Popular – Displays top 10s, new on Netflix, worth the wait, and coming this week and next week rows.\n\nHow to Find Similar Titles to Another Title\n\nAnother way to quickly find new suggestions is by getting a list of similar titles.\n\nTypically, you can find this within the app or on the title card, but you can also trigger the page manually for a more extensive list of suggestions.\n\nFirst, you need to find the title ID of the show or movie for which you want suggestions. This can be done by loading the page; the ID should be in the Netflix URL. See it highlighted for Sons of Anarchy below.\n\nThen navigate to the following URL:\n\n“netflix.com/browse/similars/NETFLIXID”\n\nThat’ll then take you to a full page of suggestions similar to the show you’re searching for, and also, most of these titles are organized in a way that are geared toward you.\n\nNetflix Content Collections\n\nIn recent years, Netflix has begun introducing hubs to its service. These collections allow you to delve deeper into Netflix universes or creators’ works.\n\nShondaland Collection\n\nRyan Murphy Collection\n\nThe World of the Witcher\n\nList of Netflix Categories\n\nAmong the many different category codes on Netflix, some are specific seasons on Netflix. We’ve listed those below.\n\nOne category code you won’t find above but is key to using Netflix is by using the “recently added” category code. The code for that page is “1592210”. However, it’s worth noting that our What’s New on Netflix page is far superior.\n\nNetflix Main Genre Categories\n\nThe biggest way to use Netflix category codes is with genres. Although we’ve covered every genre code in our full list, we thought we’d list the headline categories below.\n\nAction & Adventure (1365)\n\nAnime (7424)\n\nChildren & Family (783)\n\nClassic (31574)\n\nComedies (6548)\n\nDocumentaries (6839)\n\nDramas (5763)\n\nHorror (8711)\n\nMusic (1701)\n\nRomantic (8883)\n\nSci-fi & Fantasy (1492)\n\nSports (4370)\n\nThrillers (8933)\n\nTV Shows (83)\n\nBelow, we’ve embedded over 4,100 category codes that will help you delve deep into the Netflix library in 2023.\n\nCategory NameCategory Code Scary Cult Movies from the 1980s2 Tearjerkers from
