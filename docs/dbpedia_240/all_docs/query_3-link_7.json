        "text": "By Kathleen McCoy, Contract Social Science Research Analyst, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation\n\nWhat about the boys?\n\nFew teen pregnancy prevention programs target boys. To help fill this gap, Bethany for Children & Families in Davenport, IA administers Wise Guys, a comprehensive sex education program. A new report highlights how they administered the program in middle schools.\n\nThe program's design focuses on meeting the specific needs of adolescent males. It aims to increase communication between boys and their parents and knowledge related to sexual attitudes and risky behavior. Wise Guys sessions are in boys-only groups, to help boys feel comfortable talking about topics related to male development and sexual health. From the perspective of one boy, this was important:\n\n“In health, there are a lot of people you’re embarrassed to talk in front of. There are both boys and girls in health. Wise Guys is a small group where you feel good to explain yourself. Nobody is going to judge you.”\n\nOn average, boys attended three quarters of the sessions. They liked participating in Wise Guys and were interested in program activities. They said that they thought the program would help them make better decisions. As one boy stated, “This program shows you how to make good decisions, and shows you what to do and what not to do, and how to be more mature.”\n\nMany boys wanted Wise Guys to meet for longer sessions or more often.\n\nThis work is part of the Personal Responsibility Education Program. Future reports on Wise Guys will cover program outcomes, such as delayed sexual initiation, attitudes about romantic relationships and knowledge of contraceptives and sexually transmitted infections."
