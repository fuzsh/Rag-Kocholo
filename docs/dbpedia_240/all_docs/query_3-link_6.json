Every Thursday, from 7-9 p.m. in Katz Family Pavilion, join your fellow Wise Guys for a game of hoops. Contact Jacob Hall at [email protected] if interested.\n\nRoad cycling club\n\nInteresting in joining a Wise Guys (and Gals) Road cycling club? We’ll take long (20-30 miles) rides on some of LA’s iconic routes on Saturday or Sunday mornings. Would you like to be on the list to be notified of upcoming bike rides? Sign up information will be available soon.\n\nWise Guys Sukkah Build 2023\n\nThursday, Sept. 28\n\nThe Wise Guys’ Sukkah Build is one of our annual staples. It’s not only our chance to finally build un-permitted housing in Los Angeles, but a great way to bond with your fellow Wise Guys, build meaningful friendships, and lend a hand (or two!) to help erect our congregational sukkah!\n\nPurim Game Night\n\nMonday, March 6\n\nOur Purim Eve Games Night included spirited games of Rummikub, Bananagrams, Boggle, backgammon, Scrabble, Cards Against Humanity (or others), poker, and Mahjong! We drank, we ate, and we heard selections from the Story of Esther at this adult Purim celebration.\n\nWise Guys Big Game Watch Party\n\nSunday, Feb. 12\n\nWe hosted over 70 attendees at our annual Big Game Watch Party, including children of all ages, with fun and engaging activities, snacks, beverages, and one of the most exciting Super Bowls in recent memory! From the game to the commercials, we enjoyed an evening of fun, football, and family. Our Katz Family Pavilion was lit up by our 30-foot wide high-definition projection, and we can’t wait to do it all again next year!\n\nWise Guys Ski Trip\n\nMarch 6-8, 2022\n\nThe Wise Guys returned to Mammoth Mountain this year for a revival of the annual ski trip. After COVID-19 paused the getaway, more than a dozen Wise Guys hit the slopes with Rabbi Yoshi and Rabbi Ron!\n\nClick on any picture to view it larger.\n\nWise Guys Big Game Watch Party\n\nFebruary 13, 2022\n\nThe Wise Guys hosted more than three dozen members of the Wise community in Katz Family Pavilion to watch the Los Angeles Rams defeat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl LVI.\n\nWith L.A. playing host to the NFL’s annual spectacular and tickets going for over $5,000 at kickoff, Wise families enjoyed the action—and the commercials—on a 25×18-foot projection display. In all, 44 community members joined the Wise Guys for a day of fun, watching the home team take home football’s biggest prize while safely socially distanced.\n\nWise Guys Sukkah Build\n\nThursday, October 10\n\nMore than twenty Wise Guys converged upon the Wise campus to complete our Tikkun Olam sukkah in advance of Sukkot. Fun was had by all as the Wise Guys prepared the Temple and School to celebrate this meaningful holiday.\n\nClick on any picture to view it larger."
