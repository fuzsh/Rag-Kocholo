        "text": "One of the Medal of Honor awardees went on to write a book about the event, which Clyde Bruckman, one of Buster Keaton’s writers, and Keaton read early in 1926. They immediately recognized the story’s potential as a film plot. The Great Locomotive Chase became the real- life basis for The General, which was made and directed by Keaton and Bruckman in 1926 and released in 1927. While The General was neither the first nor the last film to relate this historical event—the first appears to have been a 9- minute 1911 movie directed by Sidney Olcott called “Railroad Raiders of ’62”—Keaton and Bruckman’s movie was the first full-length feature to do so and the only one in which the events are satirized rather than played straight.\n\nKeaton claimed that The General was his favorite among all of his movies. In making it, he hoped to fulfill his “ambition to make a really big comedy with a historical atmosphere. [….] While this picture will be designed primarily for laughs, it is my aim to make it historically correct and equally acceptable in the North and the South. It will not be a burlesque, but a comedy spectacle of certain thrilling episodes in the struggle between the States.” (“Details of United Artists’ Productions: The General,” Motion Picture News (May 29, 1926), 2573) Keaton’s intention seemed apolitical, stating at the time, “you make villains out of the Northerners, but you cannot make a villain out of the South.” As film critic Jana Prikryl writes, “Later in life he declared that audiences would never laugh at a Civil War comedy whose villains are Southern: ‘They lost the war anyhow, so the audience resents it.’” (Jana Prikryl, “The Genius of Buster,” The New York Review of Books, June 9, 2011) As the cast is all-white, contains no obviously racist jokes about Blacks, unlike some of Keaton’s other films.\n\nIn The General, Keaton and Bruckman parody the original source material by telling it from the Confederate point of view and incorporating Keaton’s classic “stone-faced” reactions to every absurd thing that happens to him. Because of prevailing public opinion that the South should be pitied rather than vilified following the Civil War, Keaton decided to cast the Union soldiers as the bad guys and made the Southern engineer—his character—an earnest and scrappy underdog, much like his characters in The Navigator (1924) and Go West (1925). (Tom Dardis, The Man Who Wouldn’t Lie Down, (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1979), 139) Johnnie is courting Annabelle Lee, played by Marion Mack, when the Civil War begins. He doggedly tries to enlist, but is rejected on the grounds—which are never explained to him—that he’s more valuable to the South as an engineer. Annabelle, not knowing of his attempts to enlist, rejects him for his apparent cowardice. But when Union spies hijack the General with Annabelle aboard, Keaton single-handedly pursues them, frees Annabel, takes back the General, and thwarts a Union attack.\n\nNostalgia plays an important role in the creation and performance of the film and its music. Films using the Civil War as a setting were popular; D. W. Griffith’s racist 1915 The Birth of a Nation is probably the most notorious. But there are at least 130 movies made between 1908 and 1929 that either take place within the action of the war or use the war to create a set of circumstances on which to base a plot. (Eileen Jones, “The Cinematic Lost Cause,” Jacobin, August 2015) The Civil War and its consequences remained highly visible in both everyday life and culture well into the 1910s and 20s. Some 50,000 veterans—more than 40,000 former Union soldiers and about 9,000 Confederate veterans—met at Gettysburg in 1913 to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, and several books about and set during the war were best-sellers during the period, including Mary Johnston’s The Long Roll (1911) and James Lane Allen’s 1915 Sword of Youth.\n\nThe issues that we now see as integral to the Civil War, particularly the end of slavery and emancipation of slaves, are rarely touched upon in early movies about the War. Revisionist historians popularized the concept of the War as what Prikryl describes as “a cruel and sordid era dominated by economically rapacious Northern ‘carpetbaggers’ in league with barbaric black freedmen.” (Prikryl, “The Genius of Buster”) The vast majority of these films, which were made by white filmmakers for white audiences, focus on a set of common narrative tropes: a daring capture or rescue of an important object or piece of information, often related to the war effort; a love story in which a heterosexual couple and/or a family unit is divided by some aspect of the war (women pushing men into service is also a significant theme); and a sympathetic view of the Confederate South. While the first two are probably predictable, the attitude these films adopt in regards to the South may be surprising for audiences today. And although a number of silent Civil War movies relied on tragic or dramatic plot-lines pitting brother against brother, requiring sacrifices of non-combatants, or valorizing whites becoming vigilantes against Northern oppressors, some of these films, such as Hands Off! (1926), The Old War-Horse (1926), and Hay Foot, Straw Foot (1928) are, like The General, comedies.\n\nKeaton was very aware that he was making a fiction film about an event that had occurred within fairly recent cultural memory: only 64 years separate the actual Great Locomotive Chase and The General. So in addition to playing on the public’s pity for the South, Keaton also wanted to capitalize on their memories of the war and its cultural artifacts. Even so, collective memories of the Ku Klux Klan marching in support of The Birth of a Nation were fresh, and Keaton had his film open first in Tokyo to gauge audience reactions before screening it in the United States. While there is nothing in the film to rally white supremacists the way Griffith’s film did, Keaton retains a number of tropes previously established by “Lost Cause” movies, such as beginning the film with the shelling of Fort Sumter; the stoic hero completely engrossed in his mission to help save his town from a Northern attack; and a complete lack of references to slavery. To make his film both “historic” and palatable to audiences across the United States, Keaton relied on these tropes and the power of nostalgia to sell his movie.\n\nThere are multiple layers of nostalgia for audiences who experience live accompaniment at a showing of The General today or watch on video: nostalgia created from elements within the film; nostalgia that serves as paratext to the film—things that surround the film, such as music or marketing; and nostalgia that is added by the music that may have been used at the time of the film’s showing as well as that for modern screenings.\n\nDiegetic Visual Nostalgia\n\nThe first layer of nostalgia surrounding The General is that created by Keaton within the film itself, what I call diegetic visual nostalgia. Keaton wanted this film to have historical verisimilitude: he initially tried to purchase or rent the actual “General” locomotive engine from Chattanooga’s Union Station, where it was on display. (Today it can be seen at the Southern Museum in Kennesaw, Georgia.) But officials turned him down when they learned that the film was to be a comedy. Keaton also scouted locations in Tennessee and Georgia, but soon learned that not only had the areas been built up, they had also switched to modern railroad tracks on which Civil War-vintage stock could no longer run. In the Pacific Northwest, though, Keaton found exactly the setting he needed. Cottage Grove, Oregon, was still a mining and timber town in 1926, boasting just a single hotel but lots of wide-open spaces that just so happened to be crisscrossed with narrow gauge train tracks. As the North industrialized during the first decades of the twentieth century, a popular view arose in which the more rural South was seen as an Eden unsullied by coal and grit, and Cottage Grove and its environs provided just the right visual of a small Southern agricultural community. Keaton purchased three vintage Civil War train engines, war-used cannon, and a bevy of remodeled freight and passenger cars. The crew built sets right around the tracks, and Keaton hired on townspeople and Oregon National Guardsmen as extras, employing about 1,500 locals over the course of shooting the film.\n\nKeaton recreated Marietta in Oregon. Seeking to make a film “so accurate it hurts,” Keaton used engravings in the source book and Civil War photographs by Alexander Gardner, Mathew Brady, and other Civil War photographers as his visual guides. (This observation is credited to Orson Welles.) The sheer amount of photographs taken during the Civil War is astonishing: for the first time, camp sites, resting troops or those in preparation for battle, and the aftermath of battles could be documented in a stable and lasting visual medium. In addition to its role in accurately showing the horrors of war, photography provided detailed historical records that could be used for various, often-unforeseen future purposes. Using period pictures, Keaton had modifications made to the railway stock and passenger cars, created nineteenth-century building facades, and had costumes made when he could not secure actual Civil War-era materials. He grew out his own hair to a length popular among Confederate soldiers, made his own hats, and ensured that co-star Marion Mack was dressed and groomed as Southern women of her station appeared in photographs.Keaton also set up his shots to mimic the still images taken by Gardner and his teams of war photographers. Shooting during the summer and while the sun was high, Keaton positioned actors in front of machinery and at angles to buildings and other figures similar to those seen in Civil War images of soldiers manning cannon or posing in front of tents. While it’s impossible to know exactly why photographs of the Civil War Keaton saw, it’s clear that he made use of common poses and situations. Keaton’s scene in which Union soldiers sit around a table discussing plans neatly mirrors an image of soldiers seated around a rustic table a Yorktown, PA, in 1862; this is a frequently seen pose. The camera angles Keaton uses in his scenes trying to fire a cannon are similar to pictures taken of men on cannon platforms during the war, preparing charges. And the film’s most famous—and expensive— shot may have been inspired by the many images of steam trains and engineers on high trestles over rivers and gorges, such as one of the train engine “Firefly” taken during the war on a trestle of the Orange and Alexandra Railroad or a train wreck at Bull Run.\n\nThese visual references to the photography of the Civil War function to both reiterate Keaton’s desire for the film’s historicity and provide audiences with a familiar style of imagery inextricably linked with the War. These are created with painstaking attention to visual detail and then satirized. The soldiers shown in the film wear correct uniforms, but Keaton points out the impracticable and awkward nature of some of their features, such as when he struggles with his sword. Annabel may be a paragon of Southern womanhood, but she receives a satirical treatment that keeps her off any pedestals: she is shown to be naïve when she has to feed the engine’s fire, and she’s less-than-elegant when she’s unexpectedly drenched by the water tower. Reviewers noted that Keaton had “gone to considerable expense and trouble in making the picture,” writing, “there is an authentic character about it which shows that it wasn’t thought out over night.” The General, predicted the reviewer, “should be a riot south of Washington. (Laurence Reid, “The General,” Motion Picture News, 35, no. 8 (February 25, 1927), 681)\n\nParatexutal Nostalgia\n\nThe paratext is the material that surrounds a work and contributes to the broader understanding of it. For The General, the paratext includes things like period marketing, reviews, and commentary, as well as its reception over time up to the present. The paratext in this case also includes the music used at screenings of the film in 1927 and the music now attached to the film through various DVD releases, which I’ll get to below.\n\nAmerican advertising for The General at its 1927 release consisted primarily of lobby cards and magazine advertisements. Many of the lobby cards feature caricatures of Keaton done in an Art Deco style, his long face overwhelming the rest of his body. One oft-used caricature includes a stogie burning away between Keaton’s closed lips. Many of the images show Keaton in the grey uniform of the Confederacy. Most lobby cards include a drawing of the train itself somewhere in the background, although one design has Keaton seated on a flying cannonball. Several designs include colorized stills from the film, usually pictures of Keaton and Mack together, but some showing Keaton sticking his head into the mouth of a cannon or sitting on the side rail of the engine. Magazine ads [slide: ad] use the same images as lobby cards, but also incorporate studio-written slogans promoting the film as providing “trainloads of laughter” and “private laughs, corporal laughs, and major laughs.”\n\nThis paratext emphasized Keaton’s role as the primary character; the different versions showing him in uniforms or partial uniforms of both the North and the South communicated the fact that the film was a costume drama. The relatively few inclusions of Mack in the marketing material suggest that the romance element of the movie was not particularly important other than as a framing device. The cartoonish way in which the train itself is rendered—usually much smaller and in less detail than cartoons of Keaton himself— indicates that while Keaton may have been interested in filming a historic event, studio producers felt the need to tell potential audiences that the movie was a comedy involving a steam engine and all of the prospective shenanigans and stunts that trains made possible.\n\nMore recent marketing and packaging material has both emphasized and de-emphasized the film’s setting in the Confederate South."
