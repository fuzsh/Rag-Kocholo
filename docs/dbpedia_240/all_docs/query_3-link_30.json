        "text": "What happens when one man sets out to create the perfect pizza? The result is Wiseguy Pizza, a Washington, D.C. brand with five locations, which launched in 2012 by founder Nuri Erol. Erol, a native of Turkey, was on a mission to create the perfect pizza and traveled the world over searching for recipes.\n\nHe started Wiseguy Pizza with a New York-style dough, \"but he's taken everything — what he's learned across the world — and cherry-picked secret trades. Everybody makes pizzas, and everybody claims to have good pizza,\" said Alex Berentzen, COO of Thompson Hospitality Group, in a phone interview with Pizza Marketplace. \"But we have a really good pizza, and I'll tell you why: what makes our pizza so successful is it's put in stone deck ovens at 550 degrees. We use a pizza peel, obviously, but we don't use screens. We want the pizza to be directly on the stone.\"\n\nProvided by Wiseguy Pizza\n\nOn the menu\n\nThe result is a golden-brown crust with a crispy, puffy, bread-like texture. It can be folded, but diners hear a delicate crunch to the dough. Those who usually leave the crust behind don't at Wiseguy. The whole slice is enjoyed.\n\nBerentzen said consistency and quality ingredients makes Wiseguy a standout in the industry. The brand uses an all-natural cheese from Wisconsin, filtered water, a tomato sauce sourced from California and expensive olive oil. Sauces are made in house at the Navy Yard shop in a basement kitchen that functions as a commissary by a long-time employee to make it consistent. Dough is made on site at each location, however, in small batches.\n\n\"We serve 18 different types of pizza,\" Berentzen said. \"It sounds like a lot, but we've gotten very good at it. When you scale a concept and get ready for growth — which we are there now — it's about owning your craft and just getting it right. It's repetition, repetition, repetition.\"\n\nPizza accounts for 95% of Wiseguy's sales. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the brand sold pizza by the slice, but afterward sales have shifted to whole pies as well. Today, sales consist of 70% slices and 30% pies, Berentzen said.\n\nThompson Hospitality Group partnered with Erol and eventually took over the brand last year, bringing with it years of experience in both menu development and scaling brands.\n\n\"The reason we're so successful is we don't mess with the brands,\" Berentzen said. \"We don't change anything. That's a mistake that other operators do when you have an owner/operator founder create a wonderful restaurant brand, grow it to a few locations and then someone else partners and they start messing with the ingredients or how things are done. We haven't changed a thing.\"\n\nAlong with the consistency of the brand are long-time employees that have been with Wiseguy for 12 or 13 years or longer.\n\nAside from pepperoni, always a big mover, the brand's Chicken Paneer Pizza is a top seller on the menu. It includes a house masala sauce, chicken, paneer cheese, mozzarella, green and chili peppers, onions, tomato, cilantro and jalapeño sauce.\n\nThe Korean Chicken is also popular with house chili and sweet sauce, crispy chicken, mozzarella, cabbage mix and sesame aioli. Guests also like the Buffalo pizza, which features spicy chicken, buffalo sauce, cheddar, mozzarella cheese and Parmigiano.\n\n\"They're a little bit off the beaten path, but once people come in and they try them, they're hooked,\" Berentzen said.\n\nGarlic knots are popular, as are homemade chocolate chip cookies.\n\nOperations\n\nThompson has helped the brand add to its tech stack, including a new POS system to replace an outdated one. Online ordering was added, and a couple of shops are so busy they're putting in kiosks to speed up the ordering process.\n\n\"People want technology. I'd say about 40% of our orders are ordered off-premise through technology, either through third-party vendors or delivery or online ordering,\" Berentzen said. \"We have to (embrace technology). With our new solutions, it's seamless. … That's the support that Thompson Hospitality can give them — the structure, the systems and help the brand scale that way so that we can grow a little better. Technology is important for us.\"\n\nThe brand has also redesigned some packaging to include branding, which will roll out in the next four to six weeks.\n\nWiseguy Pizza has five locations in the D.C./Maryland/Virginia area. Thompson Hospitality has about 60 restaurants in the area, including the Wiseguy brand, as well as units in South Florida. A sixth Wiseguy Pizza will be built in the Ft. Lauderdale area.\n\nBy the end of next year, Berentzen said the Wiseguy brand will have doubled in size.\n\n\"We could easily handle this in the DMV area. We could go to 30 or 40 locations and not have to change a thing,\" he said, adding he doesn't worry about the brand growing too quickly. \"We have it down to a science.\"\n\nThompson Hospitality has 19 brands under its umbrella and opened 14 or 15 restaurants this year alone. With buying power and experience on its side, Thompson is helping Wiseguy Pizza grow in a methodical, but responsible, way.\n\n\"Our strength is our culture, so when we knew (the Wiseguy's location at) Wheaton (Mall) was opening, we hired people early on and put them in the other stores to train,\" Berentzen said, adding the new location had employees who had already been on the payroll for nearly two months.\n\nRecruitment and retention haven't been an issue, and sales have been up year over year.\n\n\"Our stores are doing great,\" Berentzen said. \"I wish we had more (Wiseguy locations). At some point we want to franchise the brand out, too.\"\n\nThere's a link on its website for folks interested in franchising, and the brand is just starting to collect some of that information.\n\n\"We have big plans for this brand,\" Berentzen said. \"I know this could be a national brand. It's perfect.\""
