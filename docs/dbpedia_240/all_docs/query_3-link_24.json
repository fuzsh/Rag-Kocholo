        "text": "About Wise Guys Pizzeria\n\nIt all started when Tim McNamara and Mike Ernst met in the 3rd grade at St. Norbert School in Orange, California. They grew up together as altar boys, team mates, and good friends. Their children followed their footsteps to St. Norbert where they were reunited and revisited their past through their children. Tim has been in the restaurant business over 30 years. His dream was to open a restaurant in his hometown of Orange. He opened his own restaurant Fish House Market and Grill in 2006. In the same center he had a chance to buy another restaurant and build from the ground up. With it being Italian driven, the dream was to develop our own recipes and make food from scratch. Mike was interested in partnering with Tim and Wise Guys Pizzeria was born.\n\nWise Guys has planted its seed in Texas because of a Godfather who had a dream, and a Godson who always looked up to him. Kevin McNamara has been in the restaurant business for 19 years, most of these years were spent working for Texas Roadhouse. He too, dreamed of opening his own restaurant. The reason behind his dream belongs to PaPa Mac, the patriarch of the family, who valued family time and making memories above all! What better way, than around the dinner table?\n\nWise Guys is passionate about Exceeding Expectations and providing an environment that not only allows for many memories, but also gives back to the community and our awesome God, who has guided every step. This is why we will vow to give back to the community through local ministries.\n\nWe pride ourselves in fresh food, family hospitality, hard work, and a hands on approach. Pizzas, Pastas, Premium Drafts….\n\nOur made from scratch recipes will keep you coming back for more! We are honored to serve you, and can’t wait to make your family part of ours."
