        "text": "If print as commodity was at the heart of national consciousness formation by the end of the nineteenth century, as Benedict Anderson has argued, cinema – as a new medium for imagining the nation and as a new commodity at the turn into the twentieth century – also helped shape and amplify the idea of a national consciousness.Footnote 1 Anderson defined the nation as “an imagined political community”; to him, it was “imagined” because “the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them.”Footnote 2 While Anderson did not consider cinema as a powerful medium for imagining the nation – in the sense that film theorists do when they refer to national cinema – his work opens up new lines of inquiry into the ways in which moving pictures, the next mass-produced industrial commodity after print, helped imagine the nation during a crucial moment of transformation of the United States, both technologically and demographically. The early twentieth century witnessed a heightened sense of nationalism and nativism precipitated by recent waves of European immigrants to the US, and leading to the campaign to Americanize the communities perceived as threats to American homogeneity. During the era of new immigration, between 1880 and 1920, the composition of the American population changed drastically, with over twenty million immigrants entering the United States between 1890 and 1924. The term “new immigrants” placed Southern and Eastern European new immigrants in opposition to the “old immigrants” of Nordic and Anglo-Saxon ancestry, accentuating their foreignness, and justifying the Progressive Era need to reform and educate them.Footnote 3 As a community imagined through language, in Anderson's terms, simultaneously open and closed, the nation inspires love and profound sacrifice, but how does a subject such as the new immigrant, coerced into or unable or unwilling to speak the language of the nation, learn to participate in it? How does the nation include or exclude its aspiring citizens, when nationalism and nativism preclude the nation from seeing its different subjects?\n\nAlthough Progressive Era reformers acknowledged silent film's potentially negative effects on so-called impressionable audiences – such as women, children, immigrants, and working-class Americans – they agreed on one fundamental idea: that film could educate. The role of the emerging film industry, although key in supporting the Americanization efforts – both in the local and the national Americanization campaigns targeting the newest immigrants to the United States – has been insufficiently examined by scholars of American studies. In its initial context, Americanization and Americanism – terms signifying the movement (to Americanize) and the (nationalist) ethos respectively – were often used interchangeably during the 1910s and 1920s to signify the process of acculturating immigrants through language, customs, behaviors and so on. The Americanism Committee of the Motion Picture Industry, for instance, convened in December 1919 in Washington, DC to set the parameters of the Americanization campaign, which enlisted the support of the film industry. As historian John Higham has shown, from the end of the nineteenth century to its pinnacle during World War I, “the crusade for Americanization … brought new methods for dealing with the immigrants,” revealing “the growing urgency” of nationalism.Footnote 4\n\nAs nativism and nationalism intensified during and after World War I, the term “Americanization” acquired negative connotations; if hyphenated identities thrived at the turn into the twentieth century, the war-era nationalism shaped Americanization into a patriotic enterprise, compounded by fears of racial and ethnic difference and threats to Anglo-Saxonism. Historians such as Gary Gerstle have argued that “coercion, as much as liberty, has been intrinsic to our history and to the process of becoming American.”Footnote 5 Film historians have also revealed the social and political roles of film across history.Footnote 6 Americanizers seized the opportunity to exploit the potential of this new medium to reach wider and wider audiences in the United States. Besides local organizations doing the work of Americanization on a small or large scale, the federal government itself used the new film industry in the service of Americanization, especially at the height of the Americanization movement, during and after World War I. What I call “spectacular nationalism” in this essay signals the visual affective connection of the (new) immigrants with their adoptive country. I propose that spectacular nationalism emerged as a form of immigrant affect – through what I call affective Americanization – a new line of feeling connecting immigrant subjectivity both with one's country of origin and with the United States. Affective Americanization, therefore, reinforced and disseminated through silent film, also indexed immigrant multiple allegiances. Like print and other cultural texts, silent film carried and revealed feelings and emotions; although such emotions were often stifled by institutional control, especially during the more militant phase of Americanization in the 1910s, affective Americanization as a specific site of encounter between institutions and immigrant subjects marked the immigrant viewers’ encounters with both film and institutional and national ideology.Footnote 7\n\nIn this essay I argue that, just as Americanization did not produce compliant citizens overnight, silent film as a new and powerful medium of persuasion – in its growing variety of genres, addressing different audiences – influenced the new American viewers’ transformation only in part. Of particular interest to this article is the use of film in industrial and educational contexts – which sometimes overlapped – purporting to both “educate” and Americanize the new immigrants to the United States, particularly immigrant workers. This article asks, what cultural work did silent film do for Americanization, the active and sometimes coercive campaign to make new immigrants into good Americans?Footnote 8 The films I have chosen to read as case studies later in this essay – industrial, educational, and nontheatrical films such as An American in the Making (1913), The Making of an American (1920), and others – illustrate the potential of silent film both as mimesis (or representation of ideology) and as ideology. How did silent film contribute to the mission of Americanization? Were new immigrants the innocent viewers that the American government, industrialists (like Henry Ford), and Progressive Era educators and Americanizers were imagining for immigrant children and their families? Were they complicit? Were they doubly exploited through the popular images that aimed at “representing” them, and, in their own uncritical reception of such films duped by the illusion of the medium? To answer these questions, I draw on scholarship in immigration studies and film studies, as well as archival materials in the National Archives, the Library of Congress (MBRS), Northeast Historic Film, and the New York Public Library. I rely on the theoretical work of film scholars like Lee Grieveson, Richard Abel, Giorgio Bertellini, Miriam Hansen, Katy Peplin, Gregory A. Waller, Sabine Haenni, and others. Hansen addresses the metaphor which understood film as a universal language that emphasized “egalitarianism, internationalism, and the progress of civilization through technology.” With the rise of the nickelodeon in the United States, film offered the potential to instruct and entertain through the medium's “non-verbal mode of signification.”Footnote 9 Building on Hansen's work, Bertellini notes the larger ideological work of film on early twentieth-century audiences: “to understand how films were experienced at the time of their first viewing is one thing; it is another to understand how they operated, semiotically and ideologically.”Footnote 10 Although both American capitalists like Ford Motor Company and the federal government used film strategically and complicitly in the local and national efforts to Americanize the new immigrants, I argue that early American cinema was also critical of Americanization, especially as it negotiated new immigrant concerns about labor, literacy, gender, and representation.\n\nAs industrial and educational films helped disseminate an ideal version of the desired American, silent film also helped perpetuate what Bertellini calls existing “visual patterns of national and racial differences.”Footnote 11 From its inception, silent film responded to white America's obsession with race. Early Hollywood perpetuated racial stereotypes in thousands of shorts and feature films; D. W. Griffith was a case in point, particularly in his films about Native Americans and African Americans. If other films simply glossed over the topic of race, a film like The Making of an American (1920) conceived of Americanization as a process of “whitening.”Footnote 12 In the 1910s, the popularity of films like Birth of a Nation (1915) or The Italian (1915) revealed the country's fascination with race. The typecasting of Italians revealed larger ingrained racist and nationalist rhetoric, such as certain immigrant groups’ unsuitability for citizenship. As Kevin Brownlow has shown, Irish actor George Beban, who played the lead role in The Italian, had a fundamental role in changing the film's initial title from “The Dago” to “The Italian.”Footnote 13 New immigrant groups such as Italians and Jews were targets of a new genre of films emerging in the early 1900s, especially educational films aimed at promoting good American citizenship in the context of a national panic about the new immigrants’ difference and unassimilability.Footnote 14"
