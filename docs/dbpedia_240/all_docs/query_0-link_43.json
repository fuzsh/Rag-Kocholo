This course engages a comparative understanding of racialized communities in American literature, including literary productions by authors of African American, American Indian, Chicano/a, Asian American, and Hispanic American traditions. Through comparative analyses, we will regard how textual productions by Americans of different backgrounds understand and negotiate their participation in the development of American cultures. Counts towards post-1800 requirement.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-219: Gothic Literature (4.00)\n\nIn tracing the origin and progress of this genre we shall study works by several celebrated writers of gothic fiction, among them Horace Walpole, William Beckford, Matthew Lewis, Mary Shelley, Ann Radcliffe, Joseph Sheriden Le Fanu, Bram Stoker, and Shirley Jackson, and supplement our literary engagement with a look at some outstanding examples of the gothic in American cinema.

Counts toward pre-1800 or post-1800 requirement depending on topic.\n\nDescription for \"SOUTHERN WOMEN WRITERS\"--The American South has arguably produced a disproportionate amount of the country's most well-regarded authors. In this course, students will examine writing from women living in the southern United States, considering what might make this region, its writers, and its writing, distinctive. Reading texts from a variety of authors, students will think about what aspects might work together to construct the Southern woman's voice--if it exists at all. Texts may include works by Alice Walker, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Monique Truong, Carson McCullers, Natasha Trethewey, Elizabeth Madox Roberts, and Jesmyn Ward. Cross-listed with WS-221.\n\nDescription for \"EARLY WOMEN WRITERS\"--What did it mean for a woman to find her voice at a time when the feminine ideal was to be chaste, silent, and obedient? We will study texts by a servant and a queen, autobiography and fantasy, love poems and tracts, from the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Restoration. Cross-listed with WS-221.\n\nDescription for \"RADICAL KOREAN WOMEN POETS\"--This course will investigate radically feminist Korean poetry spanning from Choson Era Korea (16th century) to the present.

Yi Yonju, a persona poet who adopted the voice of sex workers living on or near American Military bases between the 60s-80s, and the iconoclastic work of Kim Hyesoon and Kim Yideum, two women who are changing the course of Korean poetry in translation as well as apply their ideas to other contexts (i.e. border studies, human rights, women, gender, and sexuality, language and power. Prerequisite ENG-110.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-221: Developments in Fiction (4.00)\n\nExploration of topics in the history of the novel across literary periods.

Situating texts into frames of literary, social, and cultural representations of queerness, we will historicize the development of non-heteronormative sexual and gender identities in an effort to illustrate that our contemporary ideas about sexuality and LGBTQ identities are informed by various academic disciplines, cultural influences, and political ideologies. Cross-listed with WS-218.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-225: Women and Film (4.00)\n\nThis course will focus on the history of film with primary focuses on the achievements of women film directors and on feminist film criticism. We will examine the contributions of women film directors to such film historical moments as the Silent 160 Cinema, the Hollywood Studio System, the international art film, and contemporary independent film. Theoretical considerations will include ideology and genre, gender and spectatorship, and the cinematic gaze. Films for analysis will include the work of Lois Weber, Dorothy Arzner, Agnes Varda, Patricia Rozema, Jane Campion, Cheryl Dunye, and Catherine Breillat. Students will acquire a familiarity with current issues in film studies in addition to an overview of the development of narrative film. Students will utilize an array of critical skills to analyze film as a social/cultural text as well as an art form. Course requirements will include regular screenings, weekly essays, online exercises, weekly quizzes, and a synthesizing final exercise. Counts toward post-1800 requirement. (Cross-listed with WS-225.)\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-227: Southern Women Writers (4.00)\n\nThe American South has arguably produced a disproportionate amount of the country's most well-regarded authors. In this course, students will examine writing from women living in the southern United States, considering what might make this region, its writers, and its writing, distinctive. Reading texts from a variety of authors, students will think about what aspects might work together to construct the Southern woman's voice--if it exists at all. Texts may include works by Alice Walker, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Monique Truong, Carson McCullers, Natasha Trethewey, Elizabeth Madox Roberts, and Jesmyn Ward. Counts toward post-1800 requirement. (Cross-listed with WS-227.)\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-228: The Engl Language: History & Controversy (4.00)\n\nFor better or worse, English has become the language of the globe, spoken by peoples around the world, millions of whom have a national and cultural identity starkly different from that of the traditional Anglophone areas of Great Britain and the U.S. This course begins with the global present of the diversity of world Englishes, and then scrutinizes the origins of the language, from the misty prehistories of the Indo-Europeans and Germanic tribes, to the earliest records of the language left by the Germanic colonizers of the British island, through the gradual growth of the language to its present status today. Throughout, the course emphasizes the many varieties of the language both across time and at any given moment, from the first recorded varieties to the present, and the relation of these varieties to power and authority; individual, social, and national identity; and discrimination and social inequity. It interrogates myths about English, even ones that haunt its own textbooks. And it considers how events in world history-like the bloody invasions of the British island, like British and American imperialism-have had profound consequences on the very language that we will be speaking in the classroom.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110 or equivalent, including exemption\n\nENG-233: Shakespeare & the Folktale (4.00)\n\nShakespeare based a number of his plays on European folktales: The Taming of the Shrew, The Comedy of Errors, Titus Andronicus, The Merchant of Venice, All's Well That Ends Well, King Lear, Cymbeline, and The Tempest, among others. This course examines how Shakespeare adapted these stories for the Renaissance London theater. Counts toward pre-1800 requirement.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-234: Shakespeare & the Modern World (4.00)\n\nEven after his death, Shakespeare continues to create. His plays are extraordinarily successful because they are so endlessly adaptable. Japanese films, African dramas, and American novels have all taken Shakespeare's plays as powerful pre-texts for their own works, which fill in blanks, offer alternative perspectives, critique, and remake. We will study a selection of Shakespeare's works and the twentieth- and twenty-first century texts that revise them, both as comments upon Shakespeare and in their own right. Counts toward pre- or post-1800 requirement.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-235: Human and the Divine in World Lit (4.00)\n\nWhat is the essence of humanity? What is humanity's place in the cosmos, and what is the purpose of human life? From the very beginning of recorded history and in vastly differing cultures around the globe, human beings have sought answers to these questions through their understanding of their relation to a divine Other. This course examines some provocative and powerful literary meditations on the human/divine relation, meditations spread out over several millennia and originating from five different continents. It explores, among other things, the distinctive ways these meditations seek to account for basic aspects of human experience-for example, gender, sex, racial/ethnic difference, wealth inequity, hunger, yearning, aggression, violence, pain, and death-as well the points of contact among what may seem otherwise quite different works. Cross-listed with REL-299.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-236: Literature & Political Violence (4.00)\n\nAmerican writers have been considering the question of when it is right and just to employ violence for political purposes since, at least, Thomas Paine's Common Sense. In this course, we will consider this question and how Americans have written about political violence and protest over the course of the country's history. We will situate our texts by interrogating events and historical moments that will allow us to contemplate how leaders have used violence for political means, and we will reflect on how these leaders, and the historical events they have precipitated, are depicted in American literature, to better understand how writers shape our understanding of what political violence is. Our explorations of the course theme will include readings by authors such as Thomas Paine, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller, Tim O'Brien, James Baldwin, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gloria Anzalda, John Lewis, and others. Counts toward post-1800 requirement.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-238: Fantasy & Race in Medieval Literature (4.00)\n\nThis course examines the literary features, ideological aims, and sociocultural significance of medieval fantasy literature, exploring in particular the ways in which race appears and functions in this literature. The geographical and temporal center of gravity is literature produced in Britain in the years 1300-1500, but the course will also consider works of literature produced earlier, later, and elsewhere, including outside of Europe.\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-240: Lit & Leadership: Global Perspectives (4.00)\n\nThis course explores varying concepts of leadership by examining a selection of literary texts from across the globe. Based on fundamental skills of critical reading and critical appreciation, it also seeks to explore the role of intuitive understanding, mindfulness, and inclusivity in representations of leadership in literature. The course scrutinizes power structures and the incidence of marginalization, domination, and exploitation within and between societies, cultural groups, and nations, of which the selected literary texts offer a variety of scenarios across a wide range of geographical, social, religious, and political terrains, to contextualize and foreground the struggle of a protagonist in the quest for self-actualization. In mirroring life and its labors, its systems of exclusion and inclusion, these texts present characters and situations from which we can learn much about discovery of self in hostile and inhospitable environments and the ability to inspire and lead others in the process. The course focuses on developing cross-cultural understanding and exploring models of leadership to disrupt and overcome the regimes of marginalization and exclusion. Texts will include novels, movies, plays, biographies, fairy or folk tales, and essays, to be selected from the following works, among others, Joseph Badaracco's \"Questions of Character: Illuminating the Heart of Leadership Through Literature,\" Plato's \"The Trial and Death of Socrates,\" Sophocles' \"Antigone,\" Shakespeare's \"The Tempest,\" Shaw's \"St. Joan,\" Gogol's \"Dead Souls,\" Achebe's \"Things Fall Apart,\" Ngugi's \"Petals of Blood,\" Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman,\" Jean Cocteau's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" V.S. Naipal's \"The Mimic Men,\" Francis Ford Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now!,\" Edwidge Danticat's \"Breath, Eyes, Memory,\" and Malala Yousufzai's \"I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.\"\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110\n\nENG-280: Perspectives on Literature (4.00)\n\nThe foundation course for the English major, introducing both methods of literary research and major concepts, concerns, and figures in contemporary literary theory. This course is designed to make us more intentional readers and writers. As we learn about the assumptions and approaches of selected literary critics and theorists, we will become more aware of our own assumptions and more deliberate about our approaches as critical and creative writers of literature.\n\nCourse requisites: One 200-level literature course\n\nENG-310: Queering the Renaissance (4.00)\n\nMen desiring men, women desiring women, women presenting themselves as men, and men presenting themselves as women abound in early modern plays and poems. This course, which borrows its title from a path-breaking 1994 collection of critical essays, examines English Renaissance texts in which gender and sexual expression are not directed by male/female or hetero-/homosexual binaries. It will also consider literary criticism and modern adaptations of these texts, both for the light they shed on the primary texts and as objects of analysis in their own rights. Counts toward pre-1800 requirement. (Cross-listed with WS-310).\n\nCourse requisites: One 200-level English course\n\nENG-316: Gender, Sexuality, and Canterbury Tales (4.00)\n\nIn writing the Wife of Bath's Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer took on the persona of a boisterous fivetime widow in order to complain about the myriad ways that men abuse women, and then to tell a story in which Queen Guinevere orders that a rapist knight must go on a quest to discover what every woman really wants. Many centuries later, literary scholars are still arguing about exactly what Chaucer was up to in this cross-dressing, oddly self-interrogating literary performance, but all agree that it raises complex issues regarding sex and gender that remain powerfully resonant today. In this course we will read several works by Chaucer, identifying issues of sex and gender as they emerge in their literary and historical contexts, and considering them also through the lens of contemporary feminist, gender, and queer theory. We will seek to discover both what light that theory sheds on Chaucer's writing and how Chaucer's writing anticipates, complicates, and even evades that theory. Counts toward pre-1800 requirement. (Cross-listed with WS-316.)\n\nCourse requisites: ENG-110 or equivalent\n\nENG-319: Jane Austen (4.00)\n\nJane Austen's novels have always been popular, respected, and beloved, but contextualizing them reveals how very astute they were in examining the social relations and social problems of her day. This course will focus on close, contextualized readings of Austen's six completed novels. We will consider how these readings illuminate the historical moments in which Austen wrote. How did she conceive of courtship, love, and proper conduct for young women? How do her novels reach beyond these topics and address economic, political, philosophical, and gender issues? How does she use the form of the novel to do all this? What is her legacy for the centuries of fiction that followed her? Counts toward pre- or post-1800 requirement. Cross-listed with WS-319.\n\nCourse requisites: Complete any 4-credit 200-level English course.\n\nENG-320: Performance Approaches to Literature for Children and Young Adults (4.00)\n\nPERFORMANCE APPROACHES TO LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS--The study of literature written for young readers, with an emphasis on translating texts for performance. May be taught in a hybrid format. Counts toward post-1800 requirement. Cross-listed with THE-320.\n\nENG-321: Studies in Romanticism (4.00)\n\nSTUDIES IN ROMANTICISM--Thematic, generic or period studies (for example, British Romantic Writers, Transatlantic Romanticisms, Romanticism Through the Ages, or Romanticism, Orientalism and Imperialism). Description for \"BRITISH ROMANTIC POETRY/PROSE\"--This course focuses on one of the most remarkable periods of creativity in English literary history that signaled the decline of old feudal structures and ushered in an era of individualism, political revolution, and democratic values. Paradoxically, it also ended up generating a sense of revolutionary elitism and notions of artistic autonomy and cultural superiority that came to represent an important feature of European, and, of course, British, imperialism. Romantic writers, in turn, were heavily influenced by the Orient and freely appropriated its texts, aesthetics, and themes even as they satirized its mores and manners. In this course we shall trace the genesis of the Romantic movement in the reaffirmation of feeling and emotion over the classical (and Enlightenment) values of reason and restraint and study the relationship of the writers and their works to nature, imagination, and folklore, as also to political and cultural changes in England and to the grand design of empire building that was in full swing at this time. Course texts may include writings by, among others, William Jones, Helen Maria Williams, Charlotte Smith, Edmund Burke, Robert Burns, Anna Barbauld, William Blake, Hannah More Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Moore, Byron, the Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats.\n\nCourse requisites: 200-level literature course\n\nENG-322: The Brontë Sisters (4.00)\n\nBetween them, the three Brontë sisters produced a notable corpus of poetry and seven memorable novels, at least five of which have acquired a cherished position in the English literary canon-Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Villette, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, and Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and Agnes Grey. The other two, Charlotte Bronte's The Professor and Shirley, are better known to scholars than to readers generally. In this course, we will study the contributions of the sisters to the development of the novel, particularly in the area of the bildungsroman, the novel of (self-)education, and also scrutinize the tussle between the romantic strain of storytelling and the narrative of psychological realism. Taking into account debates about gender and the woman question, as well as ideologies of race, class, gender and empire during the Victorian period, the course will explore how the texts relate to, or are in dialogue with, these debates and ideologies. Central to our study of the assigned texts is the critical examination of relationships, interactions and outcomes among dominant and marginalized cultures, subcultures and groups, such as women, minorities, racial others, and those discriminated against on the basis of class or social rank. Counts toward post-1800 requirement. (Cross-listed with WS-322).\n\nCourse requisites: One 200-level English course\n\nENG-325: African American Fiction and Film (4.00)\n\nThe African American novel has proven to be a vibrant and resilient form, giving expression to the experiences and concerns of black people for more than 150 years. Through the representational potentialities provided by fiction, black writers have given witness and testimony to a people's quest for freedom, identity, justice, and equality. A primary category of analysis will be gender, as the reading list will consist of paired texts by female and male writers. A special film component will be available for film studies credit. Counts toward post-1800 requirement. Cross-listed with AS-325.\n\nCourse requisites: One 200-level English course\n\nENG-327: African Americans Abroad (4.00)\n\nThis course will focus on the literature produced by African American writers in response to their experiences of expatriation, exile, and travel in Europe and Africa. African American geographical movement is usually associated with the Middle Passage of the slave trade and the Great Migration from the Southern states to the North in the twentieth century. Less attention has been paid an African American diasporic mobility whereby black men and women have ranged far and wide across the Atlantic in search of physical safety, equal treatment, artistic inspiration, political asylum, economic opportunity, spiritual expression, and personal liberation. Some specific issues for scrutiny include: the shifting meaning of an American identity for blacks abroad; the ramifications of encounters with diasporic Africans; the effect of international experience and writing upon the shaping of the African American literary voice and tradition; the critique of America and its institutions and attitudes proffered from a geographically removed vantage point; the heightened ability of expatriate blacks to understand the workings of American racism; and the impact of black women living and traveling abroad. Primary texts will include fiction, essays, travel writing, autobiographies, and memoirs by such authors as David Dorr, Nancy Prince, Pauline Hopkins, W.E.B. Du Bois, T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting, Anita Reynolds, James Baldwin, Shay Youngblood, and Andre Lee. Counts toward post-1800 requirement. (Cross-listed with AS-327.)\n\nCourse requisites: One 200-level English course\n\nENG-330: Studies in Literary Genre (4.00)\n\nSTUDIES IN LITERARY GENRE--Studies focusing on specific traditional, marginal or innovative literary genres (for example, Modern Drama, Autobiography or The Graphic Novel).\n\nDescription for \"LIFE WRITING\"--From genres like captivity narratives, slave narratives, and commonplace books, to contemporary iterations in memoir, blogs, and reality television, literary life writing matters. Life narratives demand that readers attend to histories, lives, languages, and experiences that are often unfamiliar or different from their own. Reading transnational self-representational texts raises questions about ethics, veracity, memory, and subjectivity, and we will explore these issues and others as we examine how life writers understand and represent selfhood, addressing inherent implications of reading stories of others' lives.\n\nDescription for \"GRAPHIC NOVELS\"--This course looks at the recent explosion in comics. Topics include history of comics in newspapers and counterculture magazines; the rise of graphic memoir; comics theory. Scott McCloud, Art Spiegelman, Alison Bechtel, Mat Johnson, Alan Moore, Marjane Satrapi, and others.\n\nCourse requisites: 200-level literature course\n\nENG-332: Modernism (4.00)\n\nThe Modernists changed the face of literature, working from urban and rural spaces, in and outside conventional borders. This course will study the texts of the Modernists, exploring the different ways in which this group contested conventions and created a new space for artists by continuously challenging perceptions of art and trying to remake old traditions in modern ways. Readings will include both canonical and neglected works from authors such as William Faulkner, Gertrude Stein, Langston Hughes, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Jessie Redmon Fauset. In addition to literary examples of Modernism, students will examine different media from the period, including film and music. Counts toward post-1800 requirement.\n\nCourse requisites: Complete any 200-level English course.\n\nENG-338: Asian American Literature (4.00)\n\nIn genres as distinct as short stories, essays, novels, memoir, graphic narrative, and film, this course takes as its focus some of the myriad ways in which Asian American writers have negotiated and articulated a variety of literary positions in the twentieth century. Authors examined in this course explore questions of identity formation in relation to racial construction, international migrations of labor and capital, class, sexuality, military conflict, geography, language, silence, generational conflict, and performance. At the same time, we will consider representations of Asian American experience in literature and in film and discuss the ways in which these texts are in conversation with the term \"Asian American.\" Counts toward post-1800 requirement.\n\nCourse requisites: One 200-level English course\n\nENG-340: Ethnicity in American Literature (4.00)\n\nThis course asks students to examine debates over \"authenticity\" and representation, the influences of global conflict and border spaces, the resonances of cultural myths and memory, and the role of popular culture and nostalgia in ethnic American literature. We will discuss the many and intersectional ways in which groups are ethnicized and racialized, and how they engage power, geography, and cultural production. Counts toward post-1800 requirement.\n\nCourse requisites: One 200-level ENG course.\n\nENG-342: African Literature (4.00)\n\nThis course introduces students to a selection of postcolonial texts from across the African continent. It examines systemic structures of domination and exploitation, colonial and local, and investigates issues of race, class, tribal affiliation, identity, and gender in order to understand both the nature of the societies depicted and the motivating impulses behind the texts we study. The interdisciplinary approach will allow us to identify the residual effects of colonization as well as the internal dynamics of various postcolonial societies in Africa within a historical context.
