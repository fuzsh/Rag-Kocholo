        "text": "Lost films are not the only tragedy of the silent age. It’s time that we counted up all the forgotten stories, and the overlooked connections as well. The truth is that lost films and lost memories can’t be separated. One omission leads to another—and distorts our understanding of decades of cinema. When our collective mental image of silent film is dominated by a white male comedian acing a pratfall, or a white female star elegantly swooning in an embellished silk gown, we fail to make room for the films and characters that challenge this impression. If we had to establish a new avatar of silent cinema, could it be a laughing Black woman shot in a loving close-up? A Jewish woman defying a mob? Or a Native woman facing down a posse of cowboys? The answer is yes.\n\nImportant strides are being made toward recognizing that women, people of color, and members of other oppressed communities made silent films, and, even more so, in making those films accessible. But there are still persistent absences, lost histories of performers who were beloved by audiences in the 1910s and ’20s but are little known today. Their omission from the record books is not so innocent, because it was motivated by prejudice and has reinforced similarly pernicious attitudes in subsequent eras. We deserve to know the truth about the origins of cinema. We can’t allow the impression of a historical lack of diversity in the art form to limit access to the industry today.\n\nThe Pordenone Silent Film Festival, which this year held its first in-person gathering since 2019, offered a poignant case in point. One strand of the festival was devoted to a retrospective of the Weimar-era star Ellen Richter. A revelation to many, Richter proved the hit of the festival, and provoked some fruitful discussions about the ways in which popular entertainment and politics intersect and what we still don’t know about the history of the silent era.\n\nA sleek and vivacious actor with saucer eyes and a wide, pearly smile, Austrian-born Richter starred in seventy German feature films between 1913 and 1933. She was one of the biggest box-office attractions in Germany during the 1920s, appearing in everything from comedy to costume melodrama, but she was most associated with the serial-inspired, heavily plotted antics of fast-paced Reise-und-Abenteuerfilme, a.k.a. travel-and-adventure films. At Pordenone we saw two of these multipart features and so were able to enjoy her fashion-plate aviator circumnavigating the world in Der Flug um den Erdball (Willi Wolff, 1925) as well as her Armenian princess on a mission to save her incarcerated father in Die Frau mit den Millionen (Wolff, 1923). Often, thanks to her dark hair and eyes, Richter was cast as the German film industry’s concept of “exotic”: not just Armenian princesses but Spanish dancers and Gypsy girls—see Aberglaube (Georg Jacoby, 1919), a thundering variation on the Carmen theme, with Richter’s seductive beauty luring men to their inevitable destruction. In this way, her profile was similar to that of her near-contemporary, the Polish actor Pola Negri. But whereas Negri boarded a liner, headed across the Atlantic, and rebuilt her career in the Hollywood studio system, Richter stayed in Germany and started her own production company in 1920, which made nearly forty films. Richter had been the first muse of celebrated director Richard Eichberg in the 1910s, and worked with Joe May and Richard Oswald as well, but she subsequently made most of her films with her husband, the writer-turned-director Willi Wolff, in more crowd-pleasing genres.\n\nSo why doesn’t Richter have more than a sliver of contemporary name recognition, even an entry in the major German film history textbooks? As Barbara Hammer reminds us in Nitrate Kisses (1992), “Effective history does not retrieve events/actors by official history. But shows the processes that produced those losses. Those constructed silences.” Richter’s films filled cinemas, but box-office receipts and postcards easily fade—prestige rather than popularity is a reliable route into history, and Richter rarely worked with the more celebrated auteurs of the period. Most urgently, as a Jewish performer, Richter was heading for a dangerous bend in the road. She and Wolff weathered the transition to sound, making four talkies, but not the arrival of the Nazi regime and the eviction of Jewish creatives from the German film industry. That’s the loudest silence in her life story. Richter and Wolff left the country in 1933, settling first in Austria, then France, before fleeing Europe for the States in 1940 and becoming U.S. citizens in 1946. Wolff died a year later, while Richter lived to the age of seventy-eight, dying in 1969. They never made another film.\n\nViewed in 2021, the closing scene of Aberglaube, in which Richter’s character is brutally stoned to death by a baying mob, seemed to carry an eerie premonition of what was to come. While Richter had once been beloved of German audiences, she was soon yesterday’s woman: not accidentally forgotten but aggressively omitted from screen histories and early attempts to preserve German silent movies. Most of her films are now lost, at least partly because of this premeditated erasure. Without the posthumous credibility of having shared a set with a Lubitsch or a Lang, Richter has been mislaid along with them.\n\nFor German audiences in the 1920s, Richter and her work were as much part of the popular cinematic diet as the now-lauded greats of the national cinema, the newsreels, and the imported Charlie Chaplin films. This at least should make them of interest to film scholars. Those who have sampled the beauty of Richter’s performances will value her yet more highly. She was especially witty and glamorous in the sharp comedy Moral (Wolff, 1928), which skewered the hypocrisies of self-appointed small-town censors who attempt to thwart performances by a traveling Berlin revue by night while lining up incognito for private piano lessons with its beautiful star, Ninon (Richter), by day. In a small way, in a comic mode, the film foretells its own downfall and that of its star. At this date, even the pleasures of Moral (based on a 1908 play) are all too clearly spiked by portentous shadows of real-life scenes to come: not just when Ninon is jeered offstage, but also when the film she makes to entrap her duplicitous suitors is flushed, scrap by scrap, down the toilet. Although Moral is one of two original negatives of Richter’s films to survive, it is missing one and a half reels. That said, we can be grateful to the work of the Deutsches Filminstitut & Filmmuseum and the Filmoteca Valenciana on the new 4K digital restoration.\n\nThe wronging of Richter is about more than an individual actor’s diminished fame. We have long been used to reading certain pages of film history with a pinch of salt, to distrusting even prominent sources, but we too often register these lacunae as benign when that is not always the case. For example, Marlene Dietrich, like Paul Robeson, famously denied ever having made any silent films, a falsehood born of simple vanity. (She wanted to seem younger than her years, and who wouldn’t prefer to have debuted in a classic such as her first sound film, The Blue Angel?) The evidence has long contradicted her, although her silent films were conveniently hard to see. Finally, that is changing, and at Pordenone this year we witnessed the young and silent Dietrich, sporting a monocle no less, playing a flighty gold digger in a film produced by Richter’s company and directed by Wolff. If Dietrich had claimed 1927’s boozy rags-to-riches comic caper Der Juxbaron for her CV, might the Richter-Wolff partnership and their work be just a bit better known? Perhaps. Here, a little white lie bolsters a more egregious mistake. And vice versa. The silences of film history spread until they meet.\n\nAt its best, a silent film festival such as Pordenone functions more like an excavation than a museum. The programming can be closer to an active archaeological dig than a glass-fronted display case where objects are to be seen but not touched. Because so many of the films programmed are rarely shown, each screening prompts the audience to make further connections and facilitate future discoveries. It’s a place where the “new cinephilia,” defined by Girish Shambu in Film Quarterly in 2019 as finding pleasure “in a deep curiosity about the world and a critical engagement with it,” can coexist with celebration of the established classics. “The new cinephilia radiates outward, powered by a spirit of inquiry and a will to social and planetary change,” wrote Shambu. “It is no coincidence that so many filmmakers valued by the new cinephilia—women, queer, Indigenous, people of color—have an interest in activism, and view cinema itself as part of a larger cultural-activist project.”\n\nNew cinephilia, and the greater curiosity and diversity that it advocates, doesn’t have to mean new cinema. At the same time that we fight for marginalized communities to access the film industry, we can honor the people who came before them. There are stories such as Richter’s waiting to be amplified, or revealed, and there are people doing that work. Active participants in the new, historical cinephilia include the editors and contributors of Columbia University’s Women Film Pioneers Project (WFPP), where so many accounts of global female talent and innovation in the silent era meet and intersect, and Maya Cade (audience strategist at Criterion), whose site, Black Film Archive, points visitors in the direction of Black films streaming online (with several examples from the 1910s and 1920s). When Jacqueline Stewart began her job as artistic director at the new Academy Museum, she told the Los Angeles Times that she was drawn to the institution “because I don’t have to argue here for inclusive stories of film history. I didn’t come as a corrective to something that wasn’t happening. I came because that was already the baseline philosophy, that we can’t continue to perpetuate the same kinds of hierarchies and exclusions and blind spots in the way that film history is told.” One recent season at the Museum was devoted to the filmmaker Haile Gerima, and there’s a program on right now devoted to female composers, including Nora Orlandi and Fatima Al Qadiri.\n\nAt Pordenone, the Richter retrospective was curated by Oliver Hanley and Philipp Stisany as part of a broader project titled The Great Unknown, which aims to reverse the “miserable state of research and preservation” around this overlooked star. It was not alone in attempting to recalibrate perceptions of silent film. One section set out to reframe popular Hollywood cinema by presenting films under the names of their female screenwriters rather than their directors and stars. And one immensely popular strand heralded the return of Cinema’s First Nasty Women, which previously appeared at the festival in 2017 and 2019. This project, cocurated by Laura Horak, Maggie Hennefeld, and Elif Rongen-Kaynakçi, isn’t organized by identity or accomplishment so much as by spirit. Jay Weissberg, artistic director of Pordenone, and the WFPP are both partners on the project too. The eye-catching name is taken from Donald Trump’s notorious line on Hillary Clinton, and the project celebrates “rarely seen silent films about feminist protest, anarchic slapstick destruction, and suggestive gender play.” The Nasty Women screenings have appeared at archive cinema festivals worldwide, and next spring there will be a Blu-ray compilation.\n\nFor a taster of the program’s ethos you can’t do much better than the 1907 Pathé short La grève des nourrices (Nurses’ Strike). In this film, an escalating chase comedy with an activist edge that brought the house down at Pordenone, a citywide walkout of nannies causes havoc that results in gendarmes brandishing baby bottles (and being rapidly relieved of their duties) and disconsolate toddlers organizing into a union of their own. Or you could sum it up in just one image, the Indigenous American comedy star Minnie Devereaux (a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, also known by other names, including Minnie Provost) firing a gun at Roscoe Arbuckle in 1914’s Fatty and Minnie He-Haw. The film may be far from progressive, portraying Devereaux’s Native character as a far from appealing bride for Arbuckle. However, championing Devereaux’s work in silent comedy is pure new cinephilia—counting her and honoring her as one of the talented women of color who made silent-era audiences laugh just as much as their white male counterparts. It’s not about claiming “bragging rights” for “discovering” someone whose work was already well known to audiences in their day, but about filling in all the gaps around the stars and filmmakers who have been better remembered. This way we remind ourselves that cinema has never been exclusively the preserve of just one group, however much we have been persuaded to think that. And how better to drown out all those constructed silences than with the roar of laughter?\n\nAnother 1907 film shown under the Nasty Women umbrella shares a name with a famous Chaplin short from 1914 (which also played at the festival as part of a project for local young musicians). The star of this earlier Laughing Gas, from the Edison studio, is Bertha Regustus, a Black actor of immense charm and presence. The story is simple: A young woman (Regustus) visits the dentist and, having taken slightly too much nitrous oxide for her pain, chuckles and guffaws every step of the way home, infecting all and sundry with her contagious laughter. Commuters in her train carriage and the congregation in her church all collapse with mirth; police officers belly-laugh all the way to the courthouse; two scrapping laborers swallow their differences after a wheeze or two; and a gentleman rolls on a dining-room floor with glee, dragging a white tablecloth down with him. So often in popular American film of this period we see actors of color bearing the brunt of the joke, sidelined, shoehorned into a stereotype, or otherwise demeaned. It’s hard to celebrate these artifacts of historical (and not so historical) prejudice—which becomes yet another obstacle in the path of embracing the diversity of cinema’s past. However, this film is innocent and creates a splendid setting in which Regustus’s charisma can shine. In fact, her energetic and winning performance is the film’s trump card, and the joy of the film is happily timeless.\n\nAt night, Regustus’s smiling face illuminated the exterior walls of the festival venue, reminding passersby that the silent era deserves a more inclusive icon than the overused image of certain revered white male actor-directors. The faces of the silent era are diverse, and they include Bertha Regustus, Minnie Devereux, and Ellen Richter. It’s not about substituting one history for another but enriching our understanding of the past to better inform the future of cinema and cinephilia. The constructed silences of film history have been echoing for too long."
