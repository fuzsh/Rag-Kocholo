        "text": "The silent era represents cinema in its purest form. What distinguishes film from other art forms is the cinematography and the use of the camera to tell a story. Without the assistance of sound, silent movies actors had to rely on the power of the image, actions, and expressions.\n\nRELATED: 10 Practical Effects From Old Movies That Still Look Amazing Today\n\nThe silent era has fully shaped the modern film industry. The influence of silent era film movements, like German Expressionism and Soviet Montage Theory, can be seen in nearly every film produced today. While sadly over 75 percent of all silent films are considered lost, many of the ones that remain rank among the greatest works of cinema ever created.\n\n10 The Passion Of Joan Of Arc Consistently Ranks Among The Top Ten Films Of All Time\n\nThe Passion of Joan of Arc has been consistently ranked among the top ten films of Sight and Sound's once-a-decade poll ever since its inaugural list in 1952. The most recent poll, released in 2012, ranked The Passion of Joan of Arc as the ninth-greatest film ever made.\n\nBased on the infamous trial of Joan of Arc, director Carl Theodor Dreyer used the actual transcripts from the trial to create his script. The Passion of Joan of Arc has been praised for its revolutionary cinematography, which featured an unprecedented use of close-ups, severe camera angles, and high-contrast lighting. Renée Jeanne Falconetti's portrayal of Joan of Arc is one of cinema's most unforgettable performances.\n\n9 Metropolis' Revolutionary Special Effects Still Hold Up To This Day\n\nDirected by German Expressionist icon Fritz Lang, Metropolis was one of the first feature-length sci-fi films ever made. Set in a futuristic urban dystopia, Metropolis depicts the class struggles between the wealthy and the working class. Some of the film's themes include industrialization, mass production, modernization, and the emergence of fascism and communism in a post-World War I society.\n\nRELATED: 10 Old Monster Movies That Still Hold Up\n\nOne of the most expensive films produced during the silent era, Metropolis contains revolutionary special effects and production design. The film utilized miniatures, forced perspective, and the Schüfftan process to achieve its futuristic aesthetic. The Schüfftan process is a special effects technique that uses mirrors to make it seem like actors are occupying the same space as a miniature set.\n\n8 Buster Keaton Breaks His Neck Making Sherlock Jr.\n\nSherlock Jr. is one of six National Film Registry-inducted films directed by and starring Buster Keaton. Despite being a failure upon its initial release, Keaton's career revival in the late 1950s and 1960s has led Sherlock Jr. to become acclaimed as one of the world's greatest works of visual art.\n\nSome of Sherlock Jr.'s most famous scenes include the dream sequence where Keaton passes through a movie screen and enters the film world, the game of pool with an exploding ball, and when Keaton grabs onto a waterspout from a moving train. During the filming of the latter sequence, Keaton was thrown to the ground and slammed his neck against a steel rail. It was not until 11 years later that a doctor discovered Keaton had fractured his neck while filming this incredible scene.\n\n7 The Crowd Was One Of The First 25 Films In The National Film Registry\n\nSelected as one of the first 25 films to be preserved by the National Film Registry, King Vidor's The Crowd is one of the crowning achievements of the silent era. The Crowd focuses on the trials and tribulations of an American family trying to navigate life in New York City.\n\nFamed Nouvelle Vague filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard was once asked why more films weren't made about ordinary people. He responded that The Crowd already exists, so why remake it? The film is notable for its realistic depiction of a family's struggles and its cinematography, particularly its use of camera movement.\n\n6 The Phantom Carriage Is A Landmark Film Of Swedish Cinema\n\nA major influence on legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, The Phantom Carriage is a landmark film of Swedish cinema that was directed by Victor Sjöström, one of the silent era's greatest filmmakers. The Phantom Carriage is a mix of fantasy and horror. The film introduces the idea that the last person to die every year must drive Death's carriage and collect the souls of all who die the following year.\n\nRELATED: 10 Harsh Realities Of Watching Old Disney Movies\n\nThe Phantom Carriage has become a seminal film for several reasons, including its haunting imagery, brilliant use of double exposure, and its layered narrative structure that features flashbacks within flashbacks. In 2012, the Swedish film magazine FLM voted The Phantom Carriage the greatest Swedish film of all time.\n\n5 The Commercial And Critical Success Of City Lights Defies The Sound Era\n\nBy 1931, it was believed that the public was officially done with silent films. However, Charlie Chapin made City Lights a silent film, even though Hollywood was already several years into the sound era.\n\nTo the surprise of many, City Lights became a commercial and critical hit and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. City Lights follows Chaplin's iconic Tramp as he befriends a drunken millionaire and falls in love with a flower girl. The film features Chapin's trademark mixture of slapstick humor and sentimentality. Famed writer James Agee has called Chaplin's performance in City Lights' final scene the greatest acting.\n\n4 The Big Parade Was One Of The Highest Grossing Films Of The Silent Era\n\nKing Vidor's The Big Parade was the second highest-grossing film of the entire silent era. A romantic war drama, The Big Parade revolves around a rich American man who enlists to fight in World War I, experiences the horrors of warfare, and falls in love with a French woman.\n\nThe National Film Registry inductee The Big Parade has proven to be a highly influential war film, both for its anti-war themes and the production value of its battle scenes. John Gilbert and Renée Adorée have remarkable on-screen chemistry, resulting in one of the silent era's greatest love stories.\n\n3 Man With A Movie Camera Is Arguably The Most Influential Film Ever Made\n\nArguably the most influential film ever made, Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera is an experimental documentary that depicts life in the Soviet Union through revolutionary cinematic techniques. Voted the greatest documentary of all time in a Sight and Sound film poll, Man with a Movie Camera perfectly displays the visual power of Soviet Montage Theory.\n\nRELATED: 10 Golden Era Actors Who Would Have Been Great In Comic Book Films\n\nFor Man with a Movie Camera, Vertov invented and enhanced a multitude of cinematic techniques, including multiple exposure, slow motion, freeze frames, tracking shots, and split screens. All of these techniques have become staples of cinema after Man with a Movie Camera's release in 1929.\n\n2 Five Years After City Lights, Chaplin Made Modern Times\n\nIn 1936, nearly a decade after the end of the silent era, Charlie Chapin decided to produce yet another silent film. Like City Lights, Modern Times would go on to be a critical and commercial success. One of the first 25 films selected for preservation by the National Film Registry, Modern Times is both a world-class comedy and an exploration of the effects of industrialization.\n\nModern Times would be Chaplin's final silent film and the final movie to officially feature his iconic Tramp character. Chaplin, who began composing his own scores in City Lights, delivers one of cinema's greatest scores with Modern Times. The film's romantic theme, \"Smile,\" has gone on to become a pop standard.\n\n1 Sunrise: A Song Of Two Humans Is The Pinnacle Achievement Of The Silent Era\n\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans is yet another silent classic that was among the first 25 films inducted into the National Film Registry. This romantic melodrama depicts the redemption story of a man who seeks to reignite the love between him and his wife after his affair with another woman.\n\nDirected by leading German Expressionist filmmaker F. W. Murnau, Sunrise brought a European sensibility to Hollywood cinema. The overtly stylized nature of Sunrise's production design and chiaroscuro cinematography reflected the abstract aesthetic of German Expressionism."
