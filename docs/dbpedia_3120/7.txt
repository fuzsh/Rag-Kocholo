The Almighty, originating from Glasgow, Scotland, emerged as a hard rock band in the late 1980s, sustaining their musical journey through the 1990s. Consisting of members Ricky Warwick (vocals), Stump Monroe (drums), Floyd London (bass), and Tantrum (guitar), the band gained recognition for their vibrant live performances and a musical blend that incorporated elements of hard rock, punk, and alternative rock.

Their inaugural album, “Blood, Fire & Love,” landed on shelves in 1989, receiving acclaim for its raw intensity and robust sound. The subsequent release, “Soul Destruction” (1991), featured the hit single “Free ‘N’ Easy,” contributing to the band’s growing fan base.

In 1993, The Almighty presented “Powertrippin’,” revealing a more refined and melodic side, with notable singles like “Addiction” and “Crucify.” Despite achieving some success, shifting musical trends presented challenges, ultimately leading to the band’s disbandment in 1996 after their sixth studio album, “Crank.”

Following the breakup, Ricky Warwick pursued a solo career and later joined the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy. While sporadic reunions and performances have occurred, The Almighty has not returned to full-time activity. The band’s legacy includes a catalog of high-energy rock music blending punk and hard rock influences. Due to the enduring interest in their back catalog, this re-release vinyl package is significant, as fans have been eagerly anticipating it.

For the first time in 32 years, the band is embarking on a proper tour, and most shows are already sold out. Below are a few impressions of the music and the dates; if you can attend, I highly recommend it.

The debut release from Rick Warwick’s Almighty (formerly of New Model Army) undeniably draws inspiration from the biker metal sounds of Motörhead and early Def Leppard, serving as essential reference points. However, it avoids falling into purely nostalgic tendencies. The album’s structure, built strictly on essential and abrasive riffs, providing a backdrop for persistent anthems, leaves little room for innovation. Nevertheless, tracks like “Resurrection Mutha,” “Wild & Wonderful,” and “Detroit” successfully achieve their goals. At times, the sheer force of the music alone justifies the journey. The pure rawness of it all still appeals to my ear, even to this day—fast, gritty, harsh, speedy, and full of hooks, just the way I like it.

The follow-up release, “Soul Destruction,” seemingly suggests a label desire to soften the sound; however, the band showed little regard for such sentiments, as evident here. “Soul Destruction” stands as a heavy metal album in the vein of Motörhead and Saxon, with a clear connection to the blues. The album’s standout moments are concentrated on the first side, featuring the opening track “Crucify,” the cult-favorite “Free’n’Easy,” the acoustic interlude “Bandaged Knees,” and the magnificent riff in “Praying For The Red Lights.”

Both records offer a pleasant surprise for long-time fans of The Almighty. If you fall into that category, support the band and give it a listen, and try to attend one of their reunion shows if possible.

Score: 8/10
