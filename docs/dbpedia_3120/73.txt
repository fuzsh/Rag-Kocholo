This is how it all started: I was watching a TV commercial and I really liked the song; lucky me, I had my tablet in my hands so I only had to press the magic button the start the Soundhound app. In just a few seconds I was informed that this song was “The Whole of the Moon”, by the Waterboys. I had some free time, so I decided to spend some time to read about the Waterboys in the Wikipedia. From there, I found a connection to one of rather old but not forgotten bands, New Model Army (I think it was due to the combination of guitar and violin – but later I realized that NMA did not used a violin that much…). I decided to go on reading about NMA too, and then I realized that Ricky Warwick was one of the former band members – later he left and he formed… The Almighty! (In the meantime I also spent some time browsing about his ex-wife and ex-Headbangers’ Ball hostess, Vanessa Warwick, who is now in the real estate business and apparently married to some other guy, but this is now getting out of my initial search).
