For the armed forces of the Crown

Heavenly Father,

we commend to your gracious care and keeping

all the men and women in our Armed Forces at home and abroad.

Defend them day by day with your heavenly grace;

strengthen them in their trials and temptations;

and give them courage to face the perils that beset them;

and help them to know that nothing can separate them from your love;

in Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.

O Lord God of Hosts,

stretch forth, we pray, your almighty arm

to strengthen and protect our service men and women.

Support them in times of conflict,

and in their rest and training keep them safe from all evil;

endue them with courage and loyalty;

and grant that in all things they may serve without reproach;

through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.

For Those Deployed on Active Service

Almighty God,

stretch forth your mighty arm

to strengthen and protect the armed forces:

grant that meeting danger with courage

and all occasions with discipline and loyalty,

they may truly serve the cause of justice and peace;

to the honour of your holy name,

through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.

Lord our God,

our sure stronghold,

hear the voice of our pleading

and deliver us from evil.

Strengthen us as we strive for the poor and oppressed,

and establish your justice in all the earth.

Amen

Brian Elliott, from 'They Shall Grow Not Old'

From the Field Service Book of the British Army

Almighty God,

in you alone we find safety and peace.

We commend to your gracious keeping

all the men and women who serve in the Navy, the Army, or the Air Force,

who face danger and put their lives at risk so that others might live in safety.

Defend them day by day by your heavenly power;

and help them to know that they can never pass beyond the reach of your care.

Keep alive in them and in us your vision of that peace

which alone we must seek and serve;

Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.
