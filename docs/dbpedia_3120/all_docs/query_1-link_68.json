        "text": "Many Christians are familiar with the ichthys, the fish symbol also known as the “Jesus fish.” It serves as a symbol for Christians today and was also used by the earliest converts, typically as a code to help identify followers of The Way or safe places to meet. So, too, are we familiar with the cross, a symbol of the Christian faith serving to represent the sacrifice of Christ, the miracle of the resurrection, and the salvation available to all who desire it.\n\nBut what about the star of David, often used to represent Judaism? What is the star of David, and is it biblical?\n\nWhile the star of David isn’t mentioned in the Bible, it does reflect biblical themes, similar to the ichthys and the cross.\n\nWhat Is the Star of David?\n\nThe star of David is a Jewish symbol comprising two equilateral triangles laid atop each other and forming a six-pointed star. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the star of David is also known as the Magen David or Mogen David, meaning “shield of David.” It is found on Jewish tombstones and temples, and it has served for centuries to identify people of the Jewish faith. Nazi Germany forced all Jews to wear the Star of David on their clothing to identify — and persecute — them, and today it also appears on the flag of the State of Israel.\n\nAccording to The Star of Redemption, by Franz Rosenzweig, the hexagram, or star of David, comprises two interlocking triangles. It symbolizes the relationship between humanity and God, with the corners of one representing creation, revelation, and redemption, and the corners of the other representing Man, the World and God.\n\nOther sources say the direction of the two triangles carries much symbolic significance. One point up, signifying God, and the other down, signifying people. Together they represent a covenant between God and God’s people.\n\nKabbalistic Judaism (a mystical scholarly aspect of the faith) identifies seven spiritual foundations of the world, reflected in the seven compartments within the star of David—the six tiny triangles, and the large compartment at the center.\n\nThere are 12 sides on the triangles, with some believing these represent the 12 tribes of Israel: Asher, Dan, Ephraim, Gad, Issachar, Manasseh, Naphtali, Reuben, Simeon, Zebulun, Judah, and Benjamin.\n\nAs star or shield of David, it represents God, who is recognized as the true shield of David. King David, revered among Jews as the nation’s greatest military hero and identified as a “man after God’s own heart” (Acts 13:22), was not able to win on his own, but only because of the God-given guidance and support he received.\n\nDavid was God’s anointed one (1 Samuel 16:13), chosen by God to take the mantle of king after Saul went astray. He wrote many of the psalms, and his love of the Lord serves as a model for devotion and how we can express our gratitude for and dependence on God today.\n\nWhat Is the History of This Symbol?\n\nIn the 17th century, the Jewish community of Prague was the first to use the star of David as its official symbol, and from then on it became more widely used as a sign of the Jewish faith, though not in an official sense. It was also used as a symbol of the Zionist movement, which had as its goal the creation and support of a Jewish nation in Palestine, the Jews’ ancient homeland.\n\nNazis used it to mark Jews, forcing them at all times to wear a yellow badge with the six-pointed star.\n\nThe star of David is said to adorn the Leningrad Codex, the oldest complete edition of the Hebrew Bible in existence, dating to around 1008-1010 AD.\n\nSome accounts note Simeon bar Kosba led what became known as the Bar Kokhba revolt by Jews against Rome from AD 132 to 135, using the hexagram as a symbol. Others say the hexagram was the shape of King David's shield and others still say it was the symbol on King Solomon's ring, carrying mystical power and protection. However, scholars do not confirm this as specifically Jewish use. The symbol decorated some medieval cathedrals, as well.\n\nToday, many Jews use the symbol like Christians use the ichthys or cross, wearing it as jewelry or even getting it tattooed on their skin as a permanent mark of their faith, a constant and enduring symbolic covenant with the Lord.\n\nIs the Star of David Found in Scripture?\n\nThe star of David, however, is not found in the Bible nor in the Talmud, the set of teachings and commentaries on the Torah that form the basis for Jewish law. (The Torah comprises the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. They are the central documents of Judaism.)\n\nFurther, an article in the Jewish Encyclopedia by Joseph Jacobs and Ludwig Blau note, “The Jewish view of God, which permitted no images of Him, was and still is opposed to the acceptance of any symbols, and neither the Bible nor the Talmud recognizes their existence. It is noteworthy, moreover, that the shield of David is not mentioned in rabbinical literature.”\n\nHowever, many feel the star of David symbol — like the ichthys and the cross — is just that, a symbol, meant to remind people of the message and meaning, not serve as an idol to worship.\n\nSo, as with any symbol, it is not inherently anti-faith or anti-biblical.\n\nWhy Is This Symbol Associated with Judaism?\n\nThe tenets of Judaism form the basis of Christianity (Jesus Himself was raised in the Jewish faith, practiced the religious aspects of Judaism, and knew all the Scriptures), so many Christians feel comfortable embracing many of the religious symbols of Judaism.\n\nOver the years, especially as the cross became a prominent symbol for Christians, the star of David became a prominent symbol for Jews.\n\nHowever, Christians can indeed wear and use this symbol in honor of the Jewish roots of Christianity or in solidarity and honor for their Jewish friends and fellow lovers of Yahweh, God almighty, the God of creation. Christians should take care to wear the symbol with respect and sensitivity, acknowledging its importance to their Jewish friends and loved ones.\n\nIn fact, at times over the last few decades, many Christians specifically wore a star of David, either a yellow arm badge, emblazoned on a T-shirt, or as jewelry to show support and love for Jewish people who were facing anti-Semitic backlash and hate crimes. For example, in 1978, a New York Times article reported that many Christians planned to wear the star of David in response to the release of a television documentary on the holocaust, which was being released a few days before the start of the Jewish Passover that year. Nazis were planning a march in Skokie, Illinois, and between that and other anti-Semitic comments and behaviors, including denial of the existence of the Jewish Holocaust during World War II, Christians wore the star in solidarity with Jews to show their love and respect.\n\nWhile the star of David doesn’t appear in the Bible nor is it advocated as an “official symbol” of Judaism, it is a meaningful representation of a faithful people and the oldest monotheistic religion in the world. While they are different in many regards, Judaism and Christianity are both devoted to God and His will in the world.\n\nPhoto credit: ©Getty Images/Tetra Images"
