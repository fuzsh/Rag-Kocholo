I guess I’ve said that for many Psalms; this one has been particularly helpful for me. I would title Psalm 145, “Living for Something Bigger than You.”There’s something that you and I tend to do; we tend to make life all about us. We tend to shrink our lives down to the small confines of our wants, our needs, and our feelings. We tend to put",

This year, we’re going to spend our time in the Psalms—one of the largest and most significant portions of the Word of God.\n\nWe want to begin with some introductions to the Psalms so you can wrap your brain around, “What is this portion of God’s Word about?”\n\nThe first thing I want to say is the Psalms provide for us the Bible’s hymnbook. I don’t know if you’ve thought about this or not, but God designed and created human beings to sing—we’re singing people. We sing when we’re happy; we sing when we’re sad; we sing when we’re celebrating; we sing political songs; we sing at birthdays; we sing at funerals; we sing at holidays. Old people sing; young people sing.\n\nAnd so, it makes sense that God would dedicate a portion of his Word to singing, to songs. We’re told in the Scripture to sing unto the Lord, and there’s a way in which the songs you sing always reveal the content of your heart, always reveal what’s important to you, what you think about life. So in the Psalms, God not only teaches us to sing, but he teaches us how to sing and actually gives us songs to sing.\n\nI think the greatest example of the Psalms as a hymnbook is found in Psalms 120 through 134—they’re the Songs of Ascent. These were songs that were written to be sung as the children of Israel walked up the hill to Jerusalem to worship at the temple. The Sons of Korah, who were sort of the Old Testament worship leaders, would lead them in these songs.\n\nAn example is Psalm 122; let me read this:\n\n1 I was glad when they said to me,\n\n“Let us go to the house of the Lord!”\n\n2 Our feet have been standing\n\nwithin your gates, O Jerusalem!\n\n3 Jerusalem—built as a city\n\nthat is bound firmly together,\n\n4 to which the tribes go up,\n\nthe tribes of the Lord,\n\nas was decreed for Israel,\n\nto give thanks to the name of the Lord.\n\n(Psalms 122:1-4, ESV)\n\nI love this Psalm. You can feel the excitement that people have as they’re walking up to worship, and they’re singing of their joy to be invited to the temple. I like what it says in verse two: “Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem!” It’s like, “I can’t believe that I have been invited into the presence of God.” Psalm 122 is a Psalm of joy as people are singing their way into the presence of God.\n\nThere are other Songs of Ascent that are cries for help, because people are in distress and as they’re walking to worship, they’re thinking about the presence of God, and they’re thinking about the power of God, and they’re thinking about God being their helper.\n\nI love the Psalms. I love the songs of the Psalms. I love the fact that God has invited us to sing to him and he’s told us how to sing and he’s given content to sing. You and I would do well to pay attention to the songs of the Psalms. In fact, we would do well to sing the Psalms.\n\nThe song of Psalm 122 ends this way:\n\n6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!\n\n“May they be secure who love you!\n\n7 Peace be within your walls\n\nand security within your towers!”\n\n8 For my brothers and companions’ sake\n\nI will say, “Peace be within you!”\n\n9 For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,\n\nI will seek your good.\n\n(Psalm 122:6-9)\n\nPsalm 122 invites us to sing prayers to the Lord, prayers that he would make us secure and give us peace. I just want to say to you: sing the Psalms!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. What is one of your favorite Psalms, and why? What are the truths embedded in this favorite Psalm of yours, and how have they meant so much to you during a particular season of life?\n\n2. If you were to write a few stanzas of a song that defined your life today, what would the lyrics be? They don’t have to rhyme, and they don’t need to be put to music, but take some time to think about what your “song” would reveal about your heart and what is most important to you.\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Do you like to sing? How does singing make you feel? Did you know God created singing? Did you know that God loves to hear you sing? What songs can we sing today about God?\n\nFor Older Children: What is one of your favorite songs that you have been listening to recently? Let’s take some time to review the lyrics of that song. What are the values this song is promoting? What “truths” is this song encouraging you to follow?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

The Psalms are this extensive record of the prayers of God’s people. And in that way, they sit as a wonderful example of what it looks like to pray. They sit there in the middle of the Old Testament as a welcome to pray to the One who has the power and willingness to answer.\n\nWe should never take prayer for granted. Every time you pray, you are experiencing a personal miracle of divine grace, that the One who created everything, who rules everything, who sits in authority on the throne of the universe, is willing to hear us, is willing to listen to us, is so kind and tender that he welcomes us to bring our struggles to him.\n\nI love the fact that the prayers of the Psalms aren’t these pristine, well-organized, theological prayers, as if, “If you don't get your theology right in your prayer, God won't listen.” The prayers of the Psalms are kind of chaotic and personal. We have Psalms of praise and anguish and question and doubt. One thing that’s very clear in the Psalms is God welcomes us to be utterly honest in the Psalms. We don’t have to hide our experience from him. We don’t have to hide our doubts from him. We don’t have to hide our wonderment and our questions from him, and our angers from anguish from him. In other words, you don’t have to clean yourself up to come in prayer to God. The Psalms teaches us we can come to God in prayer exactly as you are. And I don’t know if you’ve thought about this, when you pray the Psalms, you’re actually praying, the Psalms, the songs, the prayers of Jesus.\n\nA good example of that is a very familiar prayer in the Psalms. This is Psalm 22:\n\nMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\n\nWhy are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?\n\nO my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer,\n\nand by night, but I find no rest.\n\nThose words, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” were prayed by Jesus on the Cross. In that moment where God turned his back on his Son, God took every ounce of our rejection so we would never again see the back of God’s head. Here are the words of Jesus on the Cross, recorded for us centuries before the birth of Jesus.\n\nI love the whole picture of the prayers in the Psalms. Here we are broken, confused, distressed, suffering, doubtful people, but we don’t have to live in guilt, we don’t have to hide in shame, we don’t have to act in front of our Heavenly Father as if we’re something that we’re not. The Psalms is a welcome to be completely, personally honest before God.\n\nGod is powerful enough and loving enough to handle your doubt, to handle your fear, to handle your guilt, to handle your suffering, to handle your wonderment about where he is and what he is doing. And he says, “You come to me, and I will hear, and I will answer.” Well, I would say to you: pray the Psalms!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. In what ways might you be taking the miracle of prayer for granted? Do you not pray as often as you should, taking for granted the opportunity to talk with your Heavenly Father and the Creator and Ruler of the universe? Or, if you do pray frequently, are you at risk of mindlessly and mechanically treating it as religious routine, taking for granted that each opportunity is a fresh and personal moment of spiritual relationship?\n\n2. When you pray aloud with or in front of others, are you tempted to “show off”? Are you afraid of being honest, withholding what you really believe and what you truly want to communicate with God?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Do you like to talk with mommy and daddy? Do you cry with mommy and daddy when you’re sad? Do you tell mommy and daddy when you are afraid? Do you ask mommy and daddy lots of questions? Did you know that you can talk with God, too, by praying? God wants you to tell him everything that you are feeling. How are feeling today, and how can you pray about these feelings to God?\n\nFor Older Children: When was the last time you felt unheard, that is, someone didn’t listen to you or take the time to understand what you were feeling or trying to communicate? In what ways are you feeling rejected or forsaken by your peers? Are you struggling to believe that God listens to you and understands what you are going through? In what ways might you be trying to fake your positivity and pretend as if everything is going well when in fact, you are distressed, discouraged, confused, suffering, and angry? Why is it beneficial to be honest, both with God and with others?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

I am deeply persuaded that the Psalms are in the Bible to keep us honest about our own struggle of faith in this fallen world. The Psalms picture our doubt, our confusion, our wonderment, our feelings at moments that we’re under attack, our wonderment about why it doesn’t seem like the good guys are winning, our questions to God, “Is God there? Does he hear? Will he ever do what he’s promised?”\n\nA great example of the struggle of faith that’s in the Psalms is one of my favorite Psalms; it’s Psalm 73. I want to read some of Psalm 73.\n\nTruly God is good to Israel,\n\nto those who are pure in heart.\n\nBut as for me, my feet had almost stumbled,\n\nmy steps had nearly slipped.\n\nFor I was envious of the arrogant\n\nwhen I saw the prosperity of the wicked.\n\nFor they have no pains until death;\n\ntheir bodies are fat and sleek.\n\nThey are not in trouble as others are;\n\nthey are not stricken like the rest of mankind.\n\nTherefore pride is their necklace;\n\nviolence covers them as a garment.\n\nTheir eyes swell out through fatness;\n\ntheir hearts overflow with follies.\n\nThey scoff and speak with malice;\n\nloftily they threaten oppression.\n\nThey set their mouths against the heavens,\n\nand their tongue struts through the earth.\n\nTherefore his people turn back to them,\n\nand find no fault in them.\n\nAnd they say, “How can God know?\n\nIs there knowledge in the Most High?”\n\nBehold, these are the wicked;\n\nalways at ease, they increase in riches.\n\nAll in vain have I kept my heart clean\n\nand washed my hands in innocence.\n\nWhat a struggle! So, Asaph, the writer of this Psalm, is saying, “I look around, and all the people, God, that hate you, all the people the break your commands, that mock your existence and your power, seem to have the easy life. And I seem to be being hammered.” And then he says something that, you won’t use these words, but I’ve heard people say many times, “All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.” He’s saying, “God, I’ve obeyed you for this? This is what I get for following you? This is what I get for being faithful?”\n\nWell, if you can’t relate to that struggle, I don’t know where you’ve been. Often, it does seem like evil is prospering and like the good people are suffering. Here’s what Psalm 73 asks us: “What are you going to do when your life doesn’t make sense?” You only have two options. You either run from God, or you run to God. Psalm 73 records words spoken to God. Psalm 73 is an act of faith because in all of his struggle, in all of his discouragement, in all of his wonderment of what in the world God is doing, the Psalmist doesn’t turn his back on God and walk away. He doesn’t hide in fear, shame, or guilt, but he runs to God. When life is the hardest, when it doesn’t make sense, don’t run from God, run to him!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. In what ways do the wicked around you seem to be prospering and increasing in riches? Who are those in your culture setting their mouths against heaven, and how do they appear to be getting away with it? Are you tempted to behave like them to get ahead? Are you jealous of the “blessings” that they are receiving for their behavior?\n\n2. How have you suffered for your faith? What decisions have you made, trying to honor the Lord and his commands, that appear to have negative, painful consequences? How have you responded to your suffering? Have you strayed from a lifestyle of submission and obedience in recent weeks, months, or years because of it?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Have you seen other kids being bad? Did they not get in trouble for being bad? How does that make you feel if someone is bad and doesn’t get in trouble? Does that make you want to be bad like them? Is it hard to follow the rules? Does it seem like the rules make your life bad? Why do you think mommy and daddy have rules for you?\n\nFor Older Children: Who are the popular kids among your peers? What makes them popular? Do you want to be popular like them, and are you tempted or willing to break the rules to be popular like them? How have you suffered or been made fun of for being a Christian and following what the Bible says? Are you angry at God for creating rules that seem to interfere with you having a fun life? What rules are getting in the way, and what fun do you think you are missing out on? How might those rules actually be for your safety and protection?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

I love what it says in Psalm 145, that his greatness is beyond our ability to understand. You can dig, and you can dig, and you can dig, and you will never get to the bottom of the glorious glory of God. The Psalms reveal a God whose infinite in power; there's nothing he cannot do. He is gloriously holy in every way and all of the time. He is full of grace and mercy. He is boundless in redeeming love. And in all of that, he is near. The Psalms reveal that God exercises all of this for the good of his children. God unleashes his infinite power, his glorious holiness, his grace, his love, for the good of his children.\n\nI think there is no better example of this than Psalm 136. Every verse of Psalm 136 has this phrase: “For his steadfast love endures forever.” Now you have to know what Psalm 136 does; it tells the entire history of Israel through the single lens of the steadfast love of the Lord.\n\nGive thanks to the LORD, for he is good,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever.\n\nGive thanks to the God of gods,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever.\n\nGive thanks to the Lord of lords,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever;\n\nto him who alone does great wonders,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever…\n\nto him who made the great lights,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever…\n\nto him who struck down the firstborn of Egypt,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever;\n\nand brought Israel out from among them,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever…\n\nto him who divided the Red Sea in two,\n\nfor his steadfast love endures forever;\n\nIt goes through the history of Israel and says, “This is why your history is what it is, because there is a God, he does exist, and his steadfast love endures forever!” There's nothing that can separate you from his steadfast love.\n\nWhat the Psalms want us to understand is the ultimate fact of facts, of the human existence, is the existence, the power, and the grace of God. You can have university degrees, but if you don't look at life through that lens—the lens of the presence, the power, and the grace of God—you will never understand life properly.\n\nHe is infinite in power. He is glorious in holiness. He is full of grace and mercy. He's boundless in love. And he exercises all of those amazing characteristics for the good of his children. God is the ultimate fact by which we should understand everything else in our lives!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Write your own “personal Psalm” that traces the history of your life. What are the five to ten key moments that you would highlight and remember? How is each an example of the steadfast love of God enduring forever in your life? Are you tempted to take credit for any of these life highlights, even partially, for what only God could produce and achieve? Imagine how arrogant and foolish Israel would have sounded if they boasted in these achievements in the Psalm 136.\n\n2. Now consider the 10,000 mundane moments of your everyday life of faith. Why do you need the steadfast and forever-enduring love of God just as much in these moments as the ones you highlighted above? Be specific. What are the “little challenges” you faced this week that you needed the presence and power of God for? What are the “little victories” of faith that you experienced that were only possible because of the presence and power of God in your life? In what ways are you taking credit for what only grace could accomplish and achieve in these little moments?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: What are your favorite things to do in life? Why do you love them so much? Did you know that only God could make these because he is the only one powerful enough? Did you know that God made these because he is so creative and smart? Did you know that God gifted these to you because he loves you so much? Who loves you the most in life? Did you know that God loves you even more than that, more than you will ever know? As much as these people love you, their love is not perfect and will disappoint sometimes. God’s love for you is perfect and will last forever!\n\nFor Older Children: What have been your favorite moments in life so far, and why? How is each an example of God’s love in your life? Write your own “personal Psalm” that thanks God these people, places, or moments. Are you tempted to brag about these highlights and make yourself the hero? Who do you love the most, and who do you think loves you the most? How have you experienced the imperfect love of another person? How has your love for another person been unreliable at times? How has God’s love for you been steadfast, day in and day out, in the little, ordinary moments? Why do you need his love just as much in these moments as in the big ones?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

There’s a fifth thing that I think may be the most important thing to understand about the Psalms: the Psalms give us a portrait of Jesus.\n\nYou could argue that the Psalms are one big finger pointing to the person and work of the Messiah—the Savior, the Lamb, the Lord Jesus. People talk about the Messianic Psalms, and there’s a way in which every Psalm is Messianic; every Psalm has references to the central character of the redemptive narrative—Jesus. The Bible is the biography of Jesus, so it would make sense that in the center of the Bible is this incredible portrait of Jesus.\n\nThere is so much revealed about Jesus in the Psalms: his character, his mission, his suffering, that he is the promised hope of the people of God. No matter what generation of the people of God, Jesus is the promised hope. The Psalms points to his resurrection and his ultimate reign. Jesus as Savior, Jesus as the Lamb, Jesus as the promised hope, Jesus as the risen, ascended King.\n\nAn example is very early in the Psalms. I think there’s a reason why it’s early in the Psalms, because it’s setting us up for what the Psalms is about. It’s Psalm 2; it’s entitled “The Reign of the Lord’s Anointed.” And it ends this way:\n\nI will tell of the decree:\n\nThe Lord said to me, “You are my Son;\n\ntoday I have begotten you.\n\nAsk of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,\n\nand the ends of the earth your possession.\n\nYou shall break them with a rod of iron\n\nand dash them in pieces like a potter's [wheel] vessel.”\n\n(Psalm 2: 7-9, ESV)\n\n“Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your heritage…You are my Son; today I’ve begotten you.” Who could these words be about but Jesus? Remember when Jesus was baptized by John, the voice from the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased!” This is the begotten Son. Who is the One that reigns over the nations? Well, that statement is fulfilled in Ephesians 1 that says that he rules far above all principalities and dominions and power, and he rules over everything for the sake of his body, the church.\n\nThe Psalms begins by pointing to Jesus, as the beloved Son of the Father. And the Father gives him the nations and says, “I’ve appointed you to reign as King of kings forever.”\n\nWhat Psalm 2 tells us to do is as we’re reading the Psalms, look for Jesus in the Psalms. He’s the hero of the story of the Psalms.\n\nIf you would ask me, “Okay, Paul, you’ve studied the Psalms, what is the hope that the Psalms offer to us?” I would say very quickly: the hope of the Psalms is Jesus. He’s the hero, he’s the hope! When you read the Psalms, look for Jesus!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. In what ways have the kings and rulers of this world set themselves against the Lord? How are those who have been granted temporary power by God defying God and using that God-given power to scorn his law, holiness, and created order? When those with authority do this and it impacts your daily life or threatens your comfort, how do you react? Are you lashing out in fear and defensiveness, or are you resting in the ultimate authority and eternal reign of God? What does Psalm 2 teach us about how God reacts when worldly leaders deride his rule?\n\n2. What power or domain of authority, however small, have you been entrusted with by God? How can you grow in wisdom and serve the Lord with fear and trembling in this area? Be specific. How can you better represent Jesus in your role of authority? How have you abused or misused the influence that you have been entrusted with? Share your shortcomings and ask others for accountability and wisdom and help.\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Who is in charge in your life? Who do you need to obey? Who are some people who set the rules that you must follow? What are some rules that you need to follow? What happens if you do not follow these rules? Is it easy to follow the rules or hard? Did you know that God is in charge over the people who are in charge of you? Did you know that God makes rules for the people who make your rules? What do you think happens if people break God’s rules?\n\nFor Older Children: Who are the authority figures in your life? Which do you like, and why? What is it about the way they exercise power that is appealing? Who do you dislike, and why? How have they misused or abused the power that they have? What coaches, teachers, or peers in positions of leadership love their power too much and love reminding you that they are in charge? Do you live in fear of those in leadership? Do you compromise doing what you know God says is right because of what those in power will say or do to you? In what ways are your struggles with these authority figures primarily your problem, and not theirs? In other words, even if the way they exercise control is imperfect, do you dislike them because you first and foremost dislike submitting to authority? How are you struggling with the authority of God in your life today?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

At its core, what is theology? Theology, in its essence, is the study of God. And I love the theology of the Psalms. The Psalms are theologically rich and theologically deep. The Psalms entertain for us some of the most significant theological questions.\n\nAnd like I mentioned earlier, we will never ever reach the bottom of our understanding of the theology of God because God’s greatness is unsearchable. You can dig and dig and dig and dig and dig, and you will never reach the bottom. I think that we’ll be studying the character of God and our relationship to God for all of eternity.\n\nBut the Psalms do more than just expose us to this rich and deep biblical theology. The Psalms teach us how theology is meant to be done. It’s very interesting that there is no set of abstract concepts in the Psalms. The Psalms are not distant; they don’t feel academic; they’re not impersonal. In fact, the opposite is the case. The theology of the Psalms is deeply personal, it’s deeply relational. And it’s very clear that in the Psalms you realize that, theological belief is not just something you do with your brain; theological belief is something that you live every day. You could argue from the Psalms that the theology that you live is actually the theology that you believe.\n\nI want to take you to Psalm 27, which for me is one of the bright examples of the deeply personal nature of the Psalms.\n\nThe Lord is my light and my salvation;\n\nwhom shall I fear?\n\nThe Lord is the stronghold of my life;\n\nof whom shall I be afraid?\n\n(Psalm 27:1, ESV)\n\nThese words were written when David was going through tragic personal things, and he says, “The Lord is light…The Lord is salvation…the Lord is stronghold.”\n\nNow, I don’t know what you think about what I said, but what I’ve done is just given you an example of bad, unbiblical theology, because I’ve left a word out that makes what David says completely change. He says, “The Lord is my light…The Lord is my salvation…The Lord is my stronghold.”\n\nHe’s not saying, “Somewhere out there, somehow there’s light; and somewhere out there, somehow there’s salvation; and somehow out there, there’s a stronghold.” No! He’s saying, “God is this for me. God is light for me. God is salvation for me. God is stronghold for me.”\n\nAnd when you handle theology that way, theology doesn’t just give you the identity of God; it redefines your identity as a child of God. Let me say that again: good biblical theology doesn’t just define God for you; it redefines who you are as a child of God. That’s what theology is meant to do, and as it redefines your identity, it redefines the way you live your life.\n\nI guess I’d like to say to you that there better be a big “MY” in the middle of your theology. Because what the Psalms teaches us is all that God is, in his magnificent glory and covenantal love, all that God is, he is for us by grace!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Why is a more formalized and academic study of theology important? How can you become a better student of your Christian faith? Have you benefited from, or considered taking, seminary courses or certificates to increase your knowledge and understanding of key components such as biblical interpretation, church history, or systematic theology. Why is this beneficial? But in what ways is isolated academic theological study potentially dangerous, if it does not transform your heart and life and increase your love for and service of Christ?\n\n2. What difficulties, struggles, or suffering are you going through right now? What are you afraid of? How are you afraid of? How has God been your light, salvation, and stronghold in the past? How can you preach those gospel truths to yourself again today? Be specific. What does it practically mean that God is your light, salvation, and stronghold?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Are you afraid of the dark? Are you afraid of other things, people, or animals? Do you know that the Bible says it’s okay to be afraid? Did you know that God designed us to experience fear, because we live in a dangerous world with some bad people who do bad things sometimes? Why is it less scary when the lights are on? Why is it less scary when mommy or daddy (or grandmom or granddad or other guardian) is with you? Did you know that Jesus is with you all the time and that you’re never alone? Do you like building forts and hiding inside? Why do forts keep you safe? Did you know that God is the biggest and strongest fort that you can ever be safe inside? Can we talk with Jesus about being afraid and being safe with him?\n\nFor Older Children: What are you most afraid of happening today or tomorrow? Are you afraid of certain events happening, or being embarrassed, or afraid of certain people? Why do these things make you so anxious and stressed? What are you biggest fears long-term in life? What are your biggest dreams and hopes? What are some dark things that you have experienced, or are experiencing right now? How is the Lord a light in these dark places and offers salvation, or rescue, from them? How can you “run” from danger into the stronghold of Christ? Remember, as much as we experience darkness and danger from outside (and Christ is light, salvation, and stronghold for these!), the darkest darkness and biggest danger is our own sin. What dark, sinful things are you struggling with in your heart and light that you need the rescued from by Christ?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

I feel like God has met me in very, very special ways; I hope he does with you too. I am going to give each one of these Psalms that we look at my own particular title, and we’re going to start with Psalm 1, and my title for this Psalm is “God Wants You to Thrive.”\n\nI don’t know if you have ever thought about this, but God is really committed to the thriving of the creatures that he’s made in his image. You see this from the very first moments of creation that God puts Adam and Eve in this beautiful garden where they have everything that they need, and he says, “You go be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth; you thrive!” When God brought Israel out of slavery, he gave them his law; and this law was so they would know how to live so that they would thrive. God gave them the promised land, a land filled with milk and honey, so that they would thrive. God sent his Son to give us not just life, but life overflowing, life abundant. By his grace we thrive. And then we will finally be in the new heavens and the new earth where there will be no more sin and suffering, and we will live with our Lord and thrive forever and ever.\n\nThat’s really what Psalm 1 is about, and it sets the tone for the rest of the Psalms by talking to us about where life, this thriving life, is to be found and where it’s not to be found. Let me read for you:\n\nBlessed is the man\n\nwho walks not in the counsel of the wicked,\n\nnor stands in the way of sinners,\n\nnor sits in the seat of scoffers;\n\nbut his delight is in the law of the Lord,\n\nand on his law he meditates day and night.\n\nHe is like a tree\n\nplanted by streams of water\n\nthat yields its fruit in its season,\n\nand its leaf does not wither.\n\nIn all that he does, he prospers.\n\nThe wicked are not so,\n\nbut are like chaff that the wind drives away.\n\nTherefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,\n\nnor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;\n\nfor the Lord knows the way of the righteous,\n\nbut the way of the wicked will perish.\n\nPsalm 1 confronts us with this temptation that all of us have to be increasingly comfortable with the counsel of those who do not offer life, who cannot deliver it. Maybe that’s Netflix or Hulu or Instagram or Twitter or TikTok. You always have to ask yourself, “What counsel am I submitting myself to? What view of life is influencing me?” And there’s this picture of growing comfortability: first we’re walking with this kind of counsel, then we’re standing, and then we’ve relaxed in, we’re sitting, we’re growingly comfortable with counsel that cannot give us life.\n\nWhere is life to be found? Well, according to the Psalms is to be found in God’s law. For us that means God’s Word. And the center theme of God’s Word is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nWell, how do I enter into this life? Well, Psalm 1 answers that question, “…by meditating in the Word.” I mean, there are probably three steps of meditation. First, that means the study of that Word. It means then asking the question, “How does God’s word then apply to my life, my situations, my relationship, my work?” And then, “What does it look like for me then to live that out?”\n\nYou know, the counsel of the world is not like that. This passage says it’s like chaff that the wind just blows away. It’s without purpose and is driven here and driven there.\n\nI love how Psalm 1 ends, it’s so sweet. It says, “The Lord knows the way of the righteous.” God just doesn’t give us his Word. He gives us himself with it, and his watchful eye and his loving care and his tender-hearted mercy. God knows your way. He knows everything about you. He knows everything you’ll face today. He knows everything you’re thinking, everything you’re struggling with. And he says, “You come to me. You meditate in my Word. You listen to my counsel. I want you to thrive.”\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Write down (or share with your group) a list of the voices that influence you the most. Consider the amount of time you spend listening to, watching, or engaging with, each one. Rank them, either by time spent or by the amount of influence you think each has over you. Include positive, negative, and seemingly neutral influences. Evaluate your list and pray over it; ask the Spirit to show you how you can be a better steward of your time and where you need to emphasize being influenced by righteous voices.\n\n2. Identify an area of your life, or a specific sin, where you have become growingly comfortable with ungodly motives, words, or actions. Was there ever a time where you thought, “I would never do that” or “That could never be me”? How did you let your guard down? How can you get from where you are back to where God wants you to be? Be specific. What do you need to confess, and how can you ask for help?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Do you like rules? Did you know that rules are put in place so that you can be safe, happy, and have fun? Who makes the rules? Do the people who make the rules love you and want what is best for you? Are the people who make the rules bigger and stronger and smarter than you? What rules do you not like? Why do you think those rules are there? What dangerous or bad thing could happen to you if you didn’t follow any rules?\n\nFor Older Children: Who has the most influence over your life? Create a list – friends, social media influencers, family, teachers, coaches, etc. Who do you listen to most on that list and why? Are any of those voices of influence foolish or harmful? Are any of those voices honoring to God? What did each of those voices say to you in the last week that influenced the way you thought, acted, or spoke? Are there some voices of influence that you need to cut out of your daily life? Why might that be hard to do?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

Our culture denies the existence of God; our culture denies his moral commands; people of faith are growingly misunderstood and mocked. We’re no longer in the center of culture, understood and esteemed as Christians; we’re now a fringe community–lots of misunderstanding and lots of fear about who we are and what we are. And so, I love Psalm 3. Listen to Psalm 3:\n\nO Lord, how many are my foes!\n\nMany are rising against me;\n\nmany are saying of my soul,\n\n“There is no salvation for him in God.”\n\nNotice what they attack here; the attack is deeply spiritual. “Why do you trust God? There is no salvation to be found in him. Biblical faith is unnecessary; it’s fueled by false hope that is built on a lie.” And we’re growingly going to face that attack from people who just don’t understand why we believe what we believe and will think that we are a threat. So, the question is, “How do you live among the skeptics?” Well, the answer is in this Psalm:\n\nBut you, O Lord, are a shield about me,\n\nmy glory, and the lifter of my head.\n\nI cried aloud to the Lord,\n\nand he answered me from his holy hill.\n\nI lay down and slept;\n\nI woke again, for the Lord sustained me.\n\nIf you’re going to live in a culture of skeptics, you have to constantly preach to yourself the truths of the gospel of who God is, and what he does. Let me say that again. You have to be committed to constantly preaching the gospel to yourself.\n\nWhat does he say? “God is my shield. God is my glory. God is the lifter of my head.” You know when you’re upset, your head falls. God is the one who lifts me up emotionally and spiritually. God is the one who actually hears and answers my prayer; God is the one who sustains me. You have to preach to yourself again and again the truths of the existence and the grace, the presence and the promises and the activity of God.\n\nAnd then the Psalmist says, I love this:\n\nI will not be afraid of many thousands of people\n\nwho have set themselves against me all around.\n\nIf this is who God is, if God is who he declares himself in his Word, if he is the one who meets me and sustains me, is present with me, answers my prayer, then why would I be afraid if I’m around a thousand skeptics? Because I do not believe what I believe because it’s culturally popular.\n\nI’m afraid that it’s true that fear in the face of mockery is often the result of ‘identity amnesia.’ I want to say that again: fear in the face of mockery is often the result of ‘identity amnesia.’ It’s a result of forgetting who God is, and who you are as his child.\n\nAgain, I love how this Psalm ends:\n\nSalvation belongs to the Lord; your blessing be on your people!\n\nSo, get up tomorrow, and say to yourself, say it aloud so you hear it, “Salvation and blessing belong to the Lord, and salvation and blessing are his gifts to his people.” If you’re going to live in a culture you’re now living in, and not be wracked with fear and doubt, you have to be committed to preaching to yourself the gospel of who God is and what he does on behalf of his people. You preach to you, day after day, day after day.\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. In what ways has your culture grown increasingly hostile towards Christians and Christianity over your lifetime, or in recent years? What are some fresh examples of your culture denying the existence of God or rejecting his law and created order? What is your emotional reaction toward this? Are you afraid, angry, defensive, or aggressive? How does Psalm 3 instruct our response?\n\n2. How can you equip yourself to engage winsomely in your cultural context? What resources are available to help you understand the issues of the moment and how Christian apologetics speaks to them? Where are you tempted to back away from the gospel message because of fear of conflict? In what ways have you been willing to compromise on biblical truth because of cultural pressure?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Did you know that not everyone believes in Jesus? Did you know that some people are mean to people who believe in Jesus? Did you know Jesus had enemies? Did you know that some people try and make fun of God? Do you think small people can make fun of a big God? Do you like it when people make fun of you? People might make fun of you if you tell them that you believe in Jesus, and that will be really hard, but God will always protect you and take care of you for believing in him.\n\nFor Older Children: Have you been mocked because of your Christian faith or background? What specifically do they make fun of? Have you been rejected or isolated because you won’t follow along with everything your peers do? Are you tempted to ignore what the Bible says just so you can fit it or avoid being made fun of? What can you do in those moments when you feel alone all because of your faith and belief in Jesus?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

How sturdy is your joy?\n\nYou know, we’ve been through a pandemic that seemed like it was stretching on forever. For many of us, that meant physical hardship, a loss of a job, struggles in our churches, loneliness, and the list goes on. I had a pastor contact me recently and said, “My people just seem discouraged; they seem to have lost their joy.”\n\nWell, joy in hardship is one of the primary themes of the Psalms; that surely is the theme in Psalm 4. If your joy is circumstantial, if it’s relational, if it’s work related, if it’s financial, or material, when hardship in those areas come, you will then experience a loss of your joy, and with it your motivation to continue.\n\nLet me read Psalm 4:\n\nAnswer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!\n\nYou have given me relief when I was in distress.\n\nBe gracious to me and hear my prayer!\n\nO men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame?\n\nHow long will you love vain words and seek after lies?\n\nBut know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself;\n\nthe Lord hears when I call to him.\n\nBe angry, and do not sin;\n\nponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent.\n\nOffer right sacrifices,\n\nand put your trust in the Lord.\n\nThere are many who say, “Who will show us some good?\n\nLift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!”\n\nYou have put more joy in my heart\n\nthan they have when their grain and wine abound.\n\nIn peace I will both lie down and sleep;\n\nfor you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.\n\nWell, the historical setting of Psalm 4 is important. Psalm 4 and 5 were written when David was in a cave, hiding with his band of brothers, from his son Absalom, who was conspiring to take his throne. Think of how heartbreaking that situation would be, betrayed by your own son.\n\nAnd notice again this theme that David preaches the truth to himself. He says, “God has given me relief before; the Lord has set me apart for himself, so, the Lord will answer me when I call.” Now, this is important: God will never ask you to deny reality. If you deny reality, you may reach temporary peace, but you’re not exercising Biblical faith. Biblical faith is not about denying reality. But if you meditate on your hardship, you’re going down.\n\nDavid is, again, in this moment, reminding himself of where his true security is found. He’s surrounded by guys who are panicking, and they’re saying, “Who will show us some good?” They’re saying, “Okay, David, how is this mess ever going to turn out anything but terrible?”\n\nBut David’s joy is undiminished, even in the cave because his joy is not horizontal; his joy is vertical. Let me say that again: David’s joy is not horizontal, it’s not circumstantial, it’s not relational, it’s not financial, it’s not material. Hs joy is vertical; the source of his joy is his Lord, not his situation. His safety is not in the hands of Absalom but in the hands of Lord.”\n\nAnd so, David says this; I love this at the end:\n\nIn peace I will both lie down and sleep;\n\nfor you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.\n\n“I’m just going to bed because I have a reason for peace.” That’s sturdy joy. Do circumstances keep you awake? Maybe your joy is horizontal and not vertical.\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. What are you currently going through that is unexpected, unwanted, and causing hardship? What was your immediate reaction to the distress? How have you matured through the suffering already? Where might God still be requiring you to grow spiritually, die to self, and rely on him? In what ways are you still sinning, holding on to idols, and/or questioning the goodness and wisdom of God during this difficulty?\n\n2. What brings you temporary happiness? In other words, what is your “wine” and “grain”, and when they abound, why are you happy? How are these good gifts from a loving God that you can enjoy? Have you become too reliant on the abundance, or even existence, of these things for happiness? How do you react when they are taken away or not accessible? Are you currently losing sleep (literally or figurately) over them? How can you take practical steps to appreciate and enjoy these gifts while still finding joy in the Giver, and not the gift? Might it require a season abandoning the gift completely?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Do you like to sleep? Did you know that sleep is a good thing, and that God created sleep because he loves us and knows that we need to rest? Are you afraid to go to sleep or be alone in your bed? Why? What makes you afraid? Did you know that God will always keep you safe, wherever you sleep? Did you know that you can talk to God before you go to sleep, when you are struggling to sleep, and when you wake up from sleep? What can you say to God when you are afraid?\n\nFor Older Children: Are you happy with your life right now? Why or why not? What makes you happy, and what do you want even more of in your life to be even more happy? What is stressing you out currently? Did you know that David had joy even though his life’s circumstances were far from happy times? Did you know that David was at peace even though he was stressed? How can there be a difference between joy (vertical) and happiness (horizontal)? How can someone be at peace even though they are stressed?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

My title for Psalm 8 is “The Pinnacle of Creation.”\n\nAgain, I want to start with some questions. Do you ever feel like your life just doesn’t matter, like you don’t have value, like you live unnoticed? Do you ever wonder what your place is, what your role was meant to be? Do you ever go through those moments where you feel like no one really knows and no one really cares? Some of you think that no one cares if I live or die, or in this immense universe that you live in, do you feel a little lost, or without value?\n\nWell, Psalm 8 is written for us when we’re in that kind of experience. It is a hymn about the dignity and honor of every human being made in the image of God:\n\nO Lord, our Lord,\n\nhow majestic is your name in all the earth!\n\nYou have set your glory above the heavens.\n\nOut of the mouth of babies and infants,\n\nyou have established strength because of your foes,\n\nto still the enemy and the avenger.\n\nWhen I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,\n\nthe moon and the stars, which you have set in place,\n\nwhat is man that you are mindful of him,\n\nand the son of man that you care for him?\n\nYet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings\n\nand crowned him with glory and honor.\n\nYou have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet,\n\nall sheep and oxen,\n\nand also the beasts of the field,\n\nthe birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,\n\nwhatever passes along the paths of the seas.\n\nO Lord, our Lord,\n\nhow majestic is your name in all the earth!\n\nPsalm 8 begins with the majestic glory of the Lord. His name is majestic in all the earth - every created thing points to his existence and his glory. The world we live in is like a building with the architect’s name on it - everything points to God!\n\nBut for people like you and me, living in this immense and glorious universe, that still leaves us with a question; it’s the ultimate question, “What is man? What am I?”\n\nThe way that you answer that question - “Who am I? What is my life all about?” - will shape everything you do and say in your life. “Am I just a being who happens to have risen to the top of the primordial soup? Am I just another speck on one ball in the middle of the universe?”\n\nWell, not according to Psalm 8. The question gets restated, “Why are you mindful of him? Why do you care for people?”\n\nThe answer comes. God says, “I’ve made you a little lower than angels. I’ve crowned you with glory and honor. I’ve given you dominion over what I created.” God says, “You have royal identity; you have divine appointment, you have a reason for living, your life matters, you have value in my sight!”\n\nWhat you tell yourself, about you, the identity that you live out, is terrifically important. What you tell yourself your purpose is, is terrifically important.\n\nGod says, “Don’t you get it? You’re the most valuable thing in my creation, and I’ve asked you to be the resident manager over everything that I’ve made - to have dominion. You live that dominion out in your home, in your relationships, in your work, in your church.”\n\nBut the thing that I love most about Psalm 8 is Psalm 8 is a finger pointing us to Jesus. Jesus is the ultimate royal son. Jesus is the ultimate one who is crowned with honor and complete dominion. If you have value, how much more value does Jesus have?\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. What has God entrusted you with? Where has he given you dominion? What is he asking you to manage? Write down or share with others a list of the spheres of your influence. What would it look like to be a good steward in these areas? How can you glorify God? Be specific. What are some of the challenges of life in a fallen world that make stewardship difficult? What are some of the selfish temptations of your heart that will distract you? How can you partner with and learn from other Christians in similar spheres of influence to better exercise dominion over what God has entrusted you with?\n\n2. How can you glorify God by recognizing and affirming the dignity, honor, and value of the lives of people that he has placed in your sphere of influence? Who do you know who feels worthless? How can you encourage and uplift them? Who do you know who is alone? How can you be hospitable? Who doesn’t have a home or feels like a stranger? How can you welcome them and greet them in the name of Christ? Who doesn’t have a voice? How can you fight for the oppressed, the forgotten, and the unborn?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: What are some jobs that people have? Do you know what my job is and what I do when I am at work? What would you like to do for a job when you get older? Did you know that God has given you work to do now? No matter how old you are or what your work job is, God has given us all the same task – to take care of the world he created. And of all the things that God created in the world, people are the most important, because they are made in God’s image. How can you take of your world and the things that God created? How can you take care of and love the valuable people that God created?\n\nFor Older Children: Do you feel worthless, or that you have little value and nothing positive to contribute? What happened recently to make you feel this way? Did someone tell you this, or treat you like you didn’t have value? What is the most majestic, beautiful, impressive thing in creation that you can think of? Did you know that you have more beauty and honor and value to God than that, because you are made in his image? Nothing that anyone says or does to you can reduce your value to God. In fact, God values you so much that he sent his only Son to die for you – he was willing to lose his own child to make you his child forever; that’s how much you matter! How can you remind yourself of the love that God has for you when you don’t feel loved? And, as you remind yourself of that love, how can you love others who feel unlovable?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

If you haven’t asked that question yet, you will someday. If you’re not suffering now, you will someday, and if you’re not suffering now, you’re near somebody who is.\n\nWe all go through those times when God feels distant. We all go through those moments when it seems like God is not hearing, he’s uncaring, and inactive. Maybe we even go through those times when we are tempted to doubt his goodness, his faithfulness, and his love.\n\nThe words of Psalm 10:\n\nWhy, O Lord, do you stand far away?\n\nWhy do you hide yourself in times of trouble?\n\nIn arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor;\n\nlet them be caught in the schemes that they have devised.\n\nFor the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul,\n\nand the one greedy for gain curses and renounces the Lord.\n\nIn the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him;\n\nall his thoughts are, “There is no God.”\n\nHis ways prosper at all times;\n\nNow, notice what’s happening here. Psalm 10 is one of many Psalms that reminds us that this struggle with what God is doing is a universal experience. And we wonder why God doesn’t do something with the people who proudly mock him, who live lives of deceit, lives of oppression and injustice. It’s the age-old question, “Why does it seem like the bad guys are winning?”\n\nAnd what Psalm 10 reminds us of is God does see, God does keep an account, he is king forever who will bring final justice to the oppressed. Here’s what Psalm 10 introduces us to: it’s a tension that we will all live with between the “already” of our conversion and the “not yet” of the final kingdom. And I want you to listen carefully. We live in a world where bad things happen and here’s why: because of God’s heart of mercy, he gives many more people time to confess and repent and turn. That means his judgment waits.\n\nGod’s mercy reigns, so his judgment waits. That means you and I are going to live in a messy world because God, in mercy, gives day after day after day so that those who do not know him, those who do not serve him, are given another day, another moment to confess to turn and to repent. His mercy means a messy world because his judgment waits.\n\nSo, how do you live in this world where bad things are going to happen, where it looks like the wrong people are winning? Well, you take God at his Word. You trust that he is who he says he is. And you don’t give way to feelings of despair when he doesn’t seem near and he doesn’t seem active.\n\nGod is a God of awesome mercy. He says that he does not find pleasure in the death of the wicked, but he turns to rebellious creatures, and he says, “Turn, turn, won’t you turn and live?”\n\nBecause of that mercy, we will live in a messy world. God has given us his guarantee that mess will end, and we will finally one day be ushered into a world of peace and righteousness forever and ever and ever again. Mercy will triumph over judgment!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Consider a time when you felt (or still feel) “hotly pursued” by the wicked? Did (or does) the Lord feel far away, hiding himself from you and delaying to answer your calls for help? In what ways do the ungodly people around you seem to be prospering, while you try to be faithful to the Lord and only seem to experience trouble after trouble? What was (or is) your response and interaction with God during these difficult times?\n\n2. How has the Lord been merciful and patient with you, both prior to your salvation and throughout your sanctification? When has he spared judgement or consequences when you deserved it? Are you too harsh and quick to condemn others? Who have you refused to forgive, or are too slow to forgive?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Have you ever gotten lost or separated from mommy or daddy (or grandparents or guardian) when you were out in the store or in a park or at church? Were you scared when you felt far away? But were you actually lost, or did you just lose sight of us and we were right there the entire time? God might sometimes feel far away from you (perhaps tell a story when God felt far away from you), but God will never be far from you ever. If God feels far away, you might just be looking the wrong way. Did you know that you can talk to God when he feels far away, and he will always hear you.\n\nFor Older Children: Is there someone, or several people, who always picks on you or tries to make your life difficult? Do your peers who do the wrong thing seem to be prospering, even though they are breaking the rules? Do you feel that you are getting “punished” for living a God-honoring life? How does this tempt you to follow the ways of the wicked? What promises has God made to reward his righteous children who follow him, even during times of trouble?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

My title for Psalm 14 is, “What Is a Fool?” So, if you want to be wise and you want to have wisdom shape everything you think, say, choose, speak, do, then you have to be able to recognize what foolishness is.\n\nNow I’m going to say some things that at first will surprise you but hang in with me. A fool is not defined as someone who says and does stupid things. A fool is not someone who espouses wrong or illogical political positions. A fool is not to be defined as someone who squanders opportunity or money. A fool is not someone who is full of himself, who is comfortable with injustice, is disrespectful or unkind.\n\nNow maybe you’re thinking, “Well, if these people are not fools, then who is?” The problem with all of these definitions is that they are more about what a fool does and not what makes a fool a fool in the first place.\n\nWhat is it that causes a person to be a fool, that makes a person foolish? Well, Psalm 14:\n\nThe fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”\n\nThey are corrupt, they do abominable deeds;\n\nthere is none who does good.\n\nThe Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man,\n\nto see if there are any who understand,\n\nwho seek after God.\n\nThey have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt;\n\nthere is none who does good,\n\nnot even one.\n\nHave they no knowledge, all the evil doers\n\nwho eat up my people as they eat bread,\n\nand they do not call upon the Lord?\n\n(And the Psalm goes on.)\n\nNow, I’m about to hurt your feelings, but the definition of a fool in Psalm 14, repeated in Romans 3, includes us all. We all like to say we’re on the wisdom side of things. But what Psalm 14 reminds us of is that one of the terrible things that sin does to all of us is sin reduces all of us to fools. And what is the epicenter of that foolishness? It’s a denial of the existence and presence of God.\n\nNow you’ve got to stay with me - not necessarily intellectual, not necessarily theological, but living as God doesn’t exist, no matter what your theology is. Living in your marriage, living in your parenting, living in your life of money, living in your life of sex, as if God doesn’t exist. 2 Corinthians 5:15 says that Jesus came so “…that those who live might no longer live for themselves…” There it is. I’m not living for God, my life itself is a denial of his existence, his authority, and my need of his grace.\n\nYou see, it is the existence of God that is the ultimate fact that gives fact to every other fact in the universe. Everything in creation, every creative thing ever done by human beings made in the image of God, points to his existence.\n\nYou could argue that the four most important words of the Bible are the first four words, “In the beginning God.” If God is on site, then everything in the entire world changes.\n\nSo, I have to ask you the question, “Are you a fool?” I don’t mean that you don’t have God as a theological starting point in your formal belief system, but do you live as a fool? Do you live whole days acting as if God doesn’t exist? Do you live with that state of God-amnesia in your parenting, when you handle your money, in your sexual life?\n\nThe epicenter foolishness is a denial of God at street level where I live every day.\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Prior to watching this video on Psalm 14, how would you have defined foolishness or identified a fool? Who are some people in your life that you would name as fools, and why are their life decisions or lifestyle foolish? More specifically, how have you, or why do you, distance yourself from them? There is an abundance of Proverbial wisdom and instruction is avoiding fools! (See Proverbs 14:7, 23:9, and 26:4-5 for just a few examples) But, in the context of this study on Psalm 14, how have you self-righteously, like the Pharisee in the temple (Luke 18:11), distanced yourself from fools in your life and considered yourself more righteous, by your own merit and works, than you actually are?\n\n2. How have you acted “like a fool” – according to the definition of Psalm 14 – this week? Identify at least one area of your life where you operated as if God did not exist, or that you did not need him, or that his law did not matter. Be specific. How did you think, what did you desire or dream about, how did you act, or what did you say, that was only possible because you acted in isolation, like a fool, as if God was not present in that time and place? What were the consequences of that foolishness? Have you confessed and repented of your foolishness, both vertically to God and horizontally to the person you sinned against in your moment of foolishness? How can you act wisely when the same or similar situation repeats itself in the future?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Let’s talk about two words and two kinds of people. The two words are foolishness and wisdom, and the two kinds of people are fools and the wise. Do you know what these words mean? Wise people obey God and follow the wisdom in the Bible, and foolish people are those who don’t. Why do you think they don’t obey God and follow the wisdom in the Bible? (Because they don’t think that they need God or his wisdom or his help) Did you know that mommy and daddy can be fools sometimes? (Perhaps confess an area of your life when you acted like a Psalm 14 fool and even more specifically, sinned against your children. Use this as an opportunity to seek their forgiveness and represent repentance) Why is it a wise decision to obey God and remember that he is with us all the time?\n\nFor Older Children: Who are some of the fools in your school, on your team, or in your social circle? Why do you think they are fools? How would you define foolishness, or stupidity? What stupid decisions did they make recently? Why do you think they made those decisions? What were the consequences? By that same definition, are you a fool sometimes? What was a silly, funny, even innocent mistake, that you made recently? (Laugh about being foolish) Why did you make that choice in that moment? What were (or are) the consequences? The Bible has a higher standard and deeper definition of being a fool, and did you know that mom and dad, by the definition of Psalm 14, are fools sometimes? (Perhaps confess an area of your life when you acted like a Psalm 14 fool and even more specifically, sinned against your children. Use this as an opportunity to seek their forgiveness and represent repentance) What is one area where you can submit to the existence, presence, and authority of God in your life??\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

I’ve just been so amazed by how practical these Psalms are, how do they really do speak into our experience and life in this fallen world. They require us to ask questions that maybe we wouldn’t normally ask of ourselves. And so, we want to jump in today to Psalm 15. I would entitle this Psalm “Who Is Worthy?”\n\nLet me read:\n\nO LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent?\n\nWho shall dwell on your holy hill?\n\nHe who walks blamelessly and does what is right\n\nand speaks truth in his heart;\n\nwho does not slander with his tongue\n\nand does no evil to his neighbor,\n\nnor takes up a reproach against his friend;\n\nin whose eyes a vile person is despised,\n\nbut who honors those who fear the LORD;\n\nwho swears to his own hurt and does not change;\n\nwho does not put out his money at interest\n\nand does not take a bribe against the innocent.\n\nHe who does these things shall never be moved.\n\nThis is really the question of questions; you couldn’t ask a better question than the one that is being asked by this Psalm. It is this: Who is righteous enough to dwell in God’s presence? Who has the right, by the way that he lives, to be accepted with God?\n\nWell, I can say right away, if you’re asking this question, you’ve already been visited by God’s grace. The average person on the street doesn’t care about being accepted into the presence of God. That average person isn’t haunted by their relationship with God. In fact, most people don’t think about this at all. So, if you’re asking this question, God has already met you and produced that desire in your heart.\n\nThe questions are these: Who walks blamelessly? Who always has truth in his heart? Who never speaks evil with his tongue? Who never wrongs his neighbor? Who always honors those who fear the LORD? Who makes promises to his own hurt and does not back away from them?\n\nI mean, if you could say, “Oh yeah, I’m that person; I’m always holy.” Well, you’re probably shockingly self-righteous or delusional. This is a tremendously convicting Psalm. You have to stand back from this Psalm and say, “If this is what it takes to be in God’s presence, I’m cooked.” Because I don’t live up to this standard, not just every day, but probably hourly, or moment by moment.\n\nNow, Psalms like this are designed to be aspirational, designed to produce this response in our heart - “I long to be this kind of person; I want to live this kind of life” - and to cause us to pray for God’s empowering grace because we fall so short of the standard that’s here in this Psalm.\n\nBut that’s not just where this Psalm goes, and it’s definitely not where this Psalm ends. This Psalm is an Old Testament finger pointing you to Jesus because the ultimate answer to the question is Jesus! Jesus lived a perfectly righteous life all of the time and in every way. And this is what’s important: he did that as our substitute because God knew that we would never live that way.\n\nAnd so, Jesus, in his righteous life and acceptable death, purchased for us our acceptance with God. So because we are now righteous in Christ, we can live in the presence of God.\n\nIf you can look at this list and say, “I just don’t live this way,” then you should be thankful for the grace of God that is found in Jesus, that God provided a substitute, who lived a perfectly righteous life so that we would have the eternal blessing of living in the presence of God.\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Consider the list of qualities of the person worthy enough to dwell on God’s holy hill. Without being unnecessarily self-condemning or punishing of yourself, how have you failed or fallen short in one or more of these areas in the last week (or another quality mentioned in Psalm 15)?\n\nSlandered or participated in gossip about someone else when you know you should have stayed silent or changed the topic of conversation\n\nMissed or ignored a chance to love your physical neighbor by serving them in practical manner (even something as minimal as taking in their trash can)\n\nSelfishly used your money for your own pleasure and gain when there was a clear opportunity to give generously or use it for Kingdom purposes\n\nThen, consider the motivation of your heart behind that action, or failure to act.\n\n2. After considering the way (or ways) in which you failed to live a worthy life, identify examples of how Christ did so perfectly. How should his perfection, in the face of your failure, give you assurance and peace? Do you wallow in guilt or beat yourself up with shame unnecessarily, when Christ has taken the punishment already? How does his perfection and the empowering through his Spirit give you another opportunity to live according to these worthy standards this week? How can you be more aware of your tendency to sin? How can you prepare to combat the selfish motivation of your heart? How can you ask for grace in your next moment of need? Be specific and look back on the area(s) where you previously failed, and prepare for another opportunity where, by grace, you can live up to that aspirational worthy standard.\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Do you know what it means to be perfect? Do you know that mommy and daddy are not perfect – not even close! The Bible has a standard, a set of rules, that God wrote for protection and so that we could have a good life, but we break those rules and fall short of the standard all the time. Here are a few of those rules:\n\nDon’t say mean things\n\nDon’t do mean things\n\nBe generous, kind, and share\n\nHave you done all of these things perfectly? When did you make a mistake? (Share times when you have sinned in these areas) Did you know that Jesus did all of these perfectly? He never once broke God’s rules. He was always kind and never said or did bad things. And because he was perfect for us, that means God still loves and accepts us when we make mistakes, and it means that when we get another chance, we can do the right thing with Jesus’ help. How can you ask Jesus for help the next time you have a decision to make?\n\nFor Older Children: Do you ever feel shame about the way that you live and the choices that you make? (Or, the way that you aren’t living that you know you should be, and the choices that you aren’t making?) What are some of the areas where you know you are failing or falling short? (Share specific examples of how you have sinned and fallen short recently) What do you tell yourself in these moments? How can the perfect life of Jesus comfort you in your failure? How can the perfect power of Jesus help you think, desire, act, and speak better in these areas where you fall short?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

I would title this Psalm, “General and Special Revelation” - I’ll explain what that means.\n\nGod finds joy in revealing himself to us, and not just to religious believing people, but to everyone. There are two ways that he reveals himself. He wants us to know him, to be in communion with him, and have our life shaped by him. So let me read Psalm 19:\n\nThe heavens declare the glory of God,\n\nand the sky above proclaims his handiwork.\n\nDay to day pours out speech,\n\nand night to night reveals knowledge.\n\nThere is no speech, nor are there words,\n\nwhose voice is not heard.\n\nTheir voice goes out through all the earth,\n\nand their words to the end of the world.\n\nIn them he has set a tent for the sun,\n\nwhich comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,\n\nand, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.\n\nIts rising is from the end of the heavens,\n\nand its circuit to the end of them,\n\nand there is nothing hidden from its heat.\n\nWhat the Psalm is saying is that this general revelation of God’s presence, and his glory, his faithfulness and love, is there in creation every day. Creation reveals the presence and glory of God. I like to say it this way, “You can’t get up in the morning without bumping into God.” All the glorious things in creation have been intentionally designed by God to reveal the glory of the One who created them. And so, that sunset, the lumbering gait of an elephant, the inexhaustible wings of a hummingbird, the power of a storm, the beautiful fragrance of a flower, the unbelievably beautiful coat of a tiger - all of those things were meant to remind us that there is One who sits on the throne of the universe who created and controls all that is.\n\nBut there’s another form of revelation. The Psalm continues this way:\n\nThe law of the LORD is perfect,\n\nreviving the soul;\n\nthe testimony of the LORD is sure,\n\nmaking wise the simple;\n\nthe precepts of the LORD are right,\n\nrejoicing the heart;\n\nthe commandment of the LORD is pure,\n\nenlightening the eyes;\n\nthe fear of the LORD is clean,\n\nenduring forever;\n\nthe rules of the LORD are true,\n\nand righteous altogether.\n\nMore to be desired are they than gold,\n\neven much fine gold;\n\nsweeter also than honey\n\nand drippings of the honeycomb.\n\nMoreover, by them is your servant warned;\n\nin keeping them there is great reward.\n\nNot only in general revelation of creation, but God makes himself known and his will known by the special revelation of his law or his Word. Again, the law of God, the Word of God, is self- revealing. It’s so that we would know him and know his will for us so that we would live in this constant state of God-consciousness.\n\nNow, there are two things that these two revelations together do for us. First of all, it leaves all of us without excuse. There’s no one who can say that they haven’t been hit by God’s revelation because if you get up in the morning, you have had an encounter with God. And because God’s Word is available, it’s impossible for us to say we don’t know his will for us.\n\nBut God is not just removing our excuses; he is loving us because life is only ever found in relationship to him. God reveals himself to us so that we would know him, and in knowing him, we would know life. God makes himself known because he wants us to thrive, because he loves us, and he designed us to live in a lifelong communion of love and worship and surrender to him.\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Consider some of the ways in which you “bumped into God” yesterday in the form of general revelation (that is, in the same ways that a non-believing person would also experience God). How are you currently experiencing the common grace of God - the “sun” that rises on the evil and on the good, and the “rain” that he sends on the just and on the unjust (Matthew 5:45)? Do you take these for granted or even live with an attitude of entitlement? What are some of your favorite pleasures of the created world that God has gifted us? Do you worship every time you experience these gifts, or have they become somewhat of (or entirely) an idol that controls your life and shapes your reactions?\n\n2. Now compare those created pleasures that God has gifted to us and enjoys revealing himself through to the second half of the Psalm. Can you honestly relate with the Psalmist in verse 10, that the law of the Lord is more desirable than gold and sweeter than honey? How can you grow in your love for the Lord, more than his gifts? Perhaps a way to start is to reflect on how the Lord’s special revelation to you has, in the past:\n\nRevived your soul during a dry season\n\nMatured you from simple to wise\n\nGiven you reason to rejoice during suffering\n\nOpened your eyes to the truth\n\nRemember – and worship! – the times when the Lord revealed himself to you in these areas.\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Did you know that you “see” God every day, even though he is invisible? God created the world and everything in it as a reminder for us to think of him. What are some things you see every day in the world that you really like? What are some of your favorite colors, animals, foods, or things to do outside? Did you know that every time you enjoy that, you should remember God and thank him? He made all of these things because he loves you and wants what is best for you. That’s also why God gave us rules. Do you like rules? Do rules sometimes feel like that get in the way of fun? Did you know that rules are actually meant to keep us safe and to allow us to have the most fun, within the boundaries of God’s rules? Think of a rule that you might not like but that actually is good for you.\n\nFor Older Children: Where do you visibly see instances of an invisible God’s glory every day in creation? What are your favorite elements of the created world that you get to experience as a free gift from God? Do you consider these gifts and give thanks regularly, or do you just expect to receive them? Do you desire a relationship with this invisible God more than you desire all the good things that he provides? Consider all of the gifts and blessings from Psalm 19 that come with a relationship with God: reviving your soul, making you wise, giving you reason to rejoice, opening your eyes, and last forever. Pick one of these blessings and talk about how it can change your life today, if you pursue relationship with this glorious God.\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

I would title Psalm 22, “Forsaken.” There are times when all of us go through the dark, wintry night of the soul. There are moments when you do feel like you have been forsaken by God. There are times when God seems distant, uninvolved, silent. It’s like your cries go nowhere, your prayers go nowhere, and in these moments, all you can do is groan, “Is he ever going to answer?” The psalmist says, “I feel like I’m falling apart.”\n\nPsalm 22 is a validation of that struggle. God doesn’t always seem near; you don’t always understand what he’s doing. Sometimes life just doesn’t make any sense. But there’s more to this Psalm.\n\nThere’s this moment where even though God is faithful and God is near, he doesn’t seem to be faithful, and he doesn’t seem to be near. These words are quoted in the New Testament, and they are quoted in the most dramatic moment in human history–they’re quoted by Jesus. Jesus, on the cross, cries out, “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?” The hardest moment of Jesus on the cross was not the physical suffering. The most terrible moment on the cross is when the Father turned his back on the Son and Jesus Christ cries out, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?”\n\nNow here’s what you need to understand. Jesus did that as your and my substitute. Jesus, on the cross, took every single piece of our rejection - now listen to what I’m going to say - so that we will never again see the back of God’s head.\n\nYou see, in those moments when it seems like God is distant, he’s not actually distant. In those moments where I feel forsaken, I haven’t actually been forsaken, because Jesus was willing to be forsaken so that I would never be forsaken.\n\nLike I’ve said many times of other Psalms, this Psalm is full of hope even though it’s dark because it’s pointing us to this moment where Jesus was willing to be separate from the Father so that, as we come to him by faith, we would never ever again be separate from God.\n\nGod doesn’t forsake his own. He isn’t unfaithful. He doesn’t regret that he’s made you his child. He doesn’t turn away from you in disgust. He loves you with an everlasting love, and there’s nothing that can separate you from that love. Jesus guaranteed that on the cross when he cried, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” He took what we will never have to experience.\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. When has God felt distant from you in the past, or does God feel distant from you presently? What were you, or what are you, going through that was/is difficult, unwanted or unexpected? How did/would you want God to alleviate your suffering or trouble? What did/do your cries and groaning sound like? Did you, or are you, sinning in your suffering and troubling your trouble with unwise, immature, and selfish responses?\n\n2. How has God previously revealed himself to be near to you, hearing your cries, and answering them – in his perfect timing, and in his perfect grace? Consider the cross as your first and foremost example, but be hyper specific. How does Jesus crying out “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” provide you with practical comfort and hope, right here, right now? Then, consider another time when God was near to you, specifically, in darkness, proving that he has never and will never forsaken you. How can these memories help you walk faithfully through suffering?\n\n3. Who do you know who is enduring a dark time of suffering or trouble? Do they feel forsaken? What is their relationship to God in this moment? Have you asked? How can you support and encourage them with practical acts of service and love? How can you spiritually support them and remind them that they are not forsaken?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Do you ever feel alone? How does it make you feel when you are alone? Are you sad, afraid, or angry? What do you want to do when you feel alone? Did you know that if you are a child of God, you are never alone? God is always near you, he always hears you, and he always listens to you. What can you say to God next time you feel alone? Did you know Jesus felt alone from God? How do you think that made Jesus feel? Do you know why Jesus had to be alone from God? Let’s thank Jesus for being alone so that we would never to be alone again.\n\nFor Older Children: Do you ever feel alone, isolated, or excluded? Where do you feel this? At home, at school, in a group of friends, on a team? How does it make you feel when you feel separated and rejected? Do you ever talk to God in these moments? Do you think he listens, answers, or even cares? What evidence is there in the Bible that he does? Who do you know who looks alone or rejected? How can you comfort, encourage, and include them?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

I did this once at a retreat. I said, “What does it mean to believe?” And someone said, “Well, it means to trust.” And I said, “Well, what does it mean to trust?” And they said, “Well, it means to have faith.” And I said, “Well, what does it mean to have faith?” And someone smiled and said, “Well, it means to believe.” We had just done a circle.\n\nWhat does it mean to believe in God? It’s an interesting thing that every once awhile, there will be a poll taken in the United States about the percentage of people who believe in God, and it’s usually this huge percentage. And I always think, if all these people who say they believe in God would show up on Sunday in our churches, the buildings wouldn’t be big enough to contain them!\n\nThere’s a lot of confusion out there about what it actually means to believe in God. And Psalm 24 really speaks into that confusion\n\nThe earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,\n\nthe world and those who dwell therein,\n\nfor he has founded it upon the seas\n\nand established it upon the rivers.\n\nThere’s your definition of what it means to believe in God.\n\nFirst of all, it means that I really do believe that he is the Creator of everything that is. “The earth is the Lord’s” - that’s a pretty flat-footed statement. “And all of its fullness.” And, by the way, everything that lives on the earth. God founded it, God established it.\n\nNow, what’s the implications of that? If you say, “Okay, I believe that God made everything,” there are two inescapable implications of that.\n\nFirst, and it’s here in this passage, God owns everything. I don’t own my mentality, I don’t own my psychology, I don’t own my emotionality, I don’t own my personality, I don’t own my relationships, I don’t own all the things that I think that I own. It all belongs to the Lord. And so, if you believe in God, you don’t live with an ownership mentality, as if your life and your things belong to you, and you can use them however you want. No, you have to live with a stewardship mentality, this belongs to God, and how does God intend for me to use what he’s made? Everything belongs to God. Human ownership is a delusion.\n\nThe second thing that comes out of that is, if God is Creator, then he has a purpose for everything he’s made. I’m a painter by avocation, and I have a studio, and when I go into my studio to paint, I just don’t start throwing paint on a canvas and hoping it will turn into something. I design the painting to accomplish a purpose. So, everything that God has made, he’s had a purpose for that thing.\n\nAnd so, to believe in God means I constantly ask the question: What is God’s purpose for this? What is God’s purpose for my life? What is God’s purpose for my ability to think? What is God’s purpose for my emotions? What is God’s purpose for my money? What is God’s purpose for my physical body? What is God’s purpose for my sexuality? What is God’s purpose for my relationships? What is God’s purpose? What is God’s purpose? What is God’s purpose?\n\nI think that a lot of the people who say they believe in God don’t actually believe in God. What they believe in is the concept of God, but they don’t believe in God. Because Psalm 24 says, if you believe in God, it starts with believing that he made this world, that it belongs to him, and that he has a purpose for everything he made, and you live your life inside of his ownership, inside of his purpose. I would ask you today, if I watched the video of your life, would I say: This person believes in God?\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. If survey data shows that so many people claim to believe in God, why aren’t the majority of those people showing up on Sunday mornings at churches? What are they doing with their time instead? What does that show they truly believe? What do you do on Sunday mornings? What does that show you believe?\n\n2. In what areas of your life is it easier to believe that God owns everything? What evidence have you given recently - thoughts, words, or actions - that proves you truly believe Psalm 24:1-2? In what areas of your life is it more difficult for you to believe that God owns every part of you? Why?\n\n3. In what areas of your life have you failed to ask the question, “What is God’s purpose for this?” How can you be more practically intentional about putting that question on the forefront of your mind as you walk through your days, weeks, months, and years? What might it look like to be a steward of God’s world this week? Be specific.\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: Do you believe in God? How can I know you believe in God? If someone said that they believed in God, but never acted like it, would you think that what they’re saying is actually true? How can we know that someone really believes what they say if they say they believe in God? How do our actions help us understand our hearts? How can our words be made stronger by our actions? How can we ask God to help us right now as we think about where our words and our actions don’t match up?\n\nFor Older Children: If I told you I believed in God, but my actions, words, and attitudes reflected the opposite of that, what would you think about me? Why is it such a big deal for our words and actions to match up? What does it mean to steward something? Why is stewardship not the same thing as ownership? If you made something at school and someone else came along and wrecked it, why would you be upset? If God made you and owns you, who ultimately calls the shots in your life: you or him? What do you think God’s purpose is for your life? How can we both be more intentional about seeking God’s purpose for our lives?\n\nYou have permission to print, repost, share, distribute, and translate this resource as long as you credit Paul Tripp as the teacher, do not charge for this resource, and do not alter the content in any way.

Scholars say that either Psalm 27 was written when David was fleeing from the murderous jealousy of Saul; he had been nothing but a faithful servant to Saul, but Saul was jealous and out to take his life. It was a situation of horrible personal injustice. Or other people say that Psalm 27 was written when David was fleeing from his son, Absalom, who had conspired to take his throne. In a monarchy, the way you take the king’s throne is by killing the king. And so, it’s a horrible situation of family betrayal.\n\nBut in this Psalm of trouble, as the words begin of this Psalm, they don’t begin with trouble; they actually begin with theology. And because of that, I want to title Psalm 27, “How to Do Theology.” Listen to these words:\n\nThe Lord is my light and my salvation;\n\nwhom shall I fear?\n\nThe Lord is the stronghold of my life;\n\nof whom shall I be afraid?\n\nWhen evildoers assail me\n\nto eat up my flesh,\n\nmy adversaries and foes,\n\nit is they who stumble and fall.\n\nThough an army encamp against me,\n\nmy heart shall not fear;\n\nthough war arise against me,\n\nyet I will be confident.\n\nOne thing have I asked of the Lord,\n\nthat will I seek after:\n\nthat I may dwell in the house of the Lord\n\nall the days of my life,\n\nto gaze upon the beauty of the Lord\n\nand to inquire in his temple.\n\nIn this hard moment of life, David doesn’t begin by complaining; he begins by reminding himself of what is true. It’s important to say that it’s never more important to preach yourself the theology of the Word of God, than in those moments when life doesn’t make sense. Let me say that again: it’s never more important to preach to yourself the theology of the Word of God, than in those moments when life doesn’t seem to make any sense.\n\nBut notice with me the kind of theology that David preaches to himself. This is the way theology should be handled; this is not some formal recitation of abstract truths; it’s not a theoretical and impersonal outline; t’s not esoteric, biblical logic for the elite.\n\nThe theology of David lives where David lives. Let me read this passage this way: “The Lord is light and salvation...The Lord is stronghold...of whom shall I be afraid?”\n\nNow, I’ve just given you bad theology because I’ve left out a word. David says, “The Lord is my light…The Lord is my salvation…The Lord is my stronghold.” Now, here’s what theology should do for you: theology, properly handled, should not just define who God is (listen carefully), but should redefine who I am as a child of God. The statements David makes, “The Lord is my light and my salvation and my stronghold,” are not just God defining statements–they are statements of David’s identity as a child of God. That’s why David says, “The one thing I want to do, is I want to go into the temple and gaze upon the beauty of the Lord.” David understands there’s One who sits on a throne of the universe who is way more beautiful than any ugly thing you will face in your life. And you will only properly understand the ugly things in your life when you look at them through the awesome glory of the beauty of your Redeemer.\n\nTheology is meant to be personal; it’s not ever meant to be just something you do with your brain, but something that redefines who you are as a child of God and therefore redefines the way that you live your life. David’s not unafraid because he has power. He’s unafraid because he knows his identity as a child of God. “The Lord is my light, my salvation, my stronghold.” That’s theology properly handled!\n\nQuestions for Personal Reflection or Group Discussion\n\n1. Consider a time when life didn’t make sense. Maybe it doesn’t make sense today! Is, or was, When life doesn’t make sense, is your first response to complain or to remind yourself of what is true?\n\n2. Why is it so important to understand that theology isn’t necessarily some formal recitation of abstract truth? Why is theology personal and not impersonal?\n\n3. How is theology defining your understanding of God? How is theology redefining who you are as a child of God? How is theology changing you in your marriage? In your parenting? In your ministry? In your job? In your friendships? In your thought patterns? In your words? In your actions?\n\n4. Why is your identity not primarily about you but about God? How does your view of God affect your view of yourself and your life’s circumstances? Why is a proper view of God more important than all the problems in your life? How can the beauty of God change the way you think about and respond to your ugly circumstances?\n\nConversation Prompts to Use with Children\n\nFor Younger Children: How do you feel when you don’t understand what’s going on around you? How do you normally act when something happens and you’re confused? Why do you think it’s easy to get angry or sad or frustrated when you don’t understand something? Why do you think it’s easy to trust somebody you love (like your mom or dad or grandparent) even though you may be confused by them?"
