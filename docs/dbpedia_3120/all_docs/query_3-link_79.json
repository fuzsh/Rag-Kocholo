        "text": "The vanguard of Major-General George G. Meade’s Federal Army of the Potomac (with General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant in overall command) was at the James River in southeastern Virginia by the morning of June 14. This was part of Grant’s massive gamble to move 100,000 men across the James before General Robert E. Lee, commanding the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, could find out.\n\nLee was still unaware that Grant’s main thrust would be toward the James. His Third Corps under Lieutenant-General A.P. Hill had spent most of the 13th skirmishing with Major-General Gouverneur Warren’s Fifth Corps and Brigadier-General James H. Wilson’s Federal cavalry, which blocked the Confederates from seeing the main march. Lee was about to order Hill to attack on the morning of the 14th when he learned that the Federals were gone once more. Warren had withdrawn during the night, screened by Wilson’s troopers.\n\nLee’s army was too small to launch a full-scale assault on the Federals, and Lee’s cavalry was too weak to conduct a reconnaissance in force. It was not until late morning that Lee realized what Grant may be attempting, and he notified President Jefferson Davis at 12:10 p.m.:\n\n“… I think the enemy must be preparing to move south of James River. Our scouts and pickets yesterday stated that Genl Grant’s whole army was in motion for the fords of the Chickahominy from Long Bridge down… It may be Genl Grant’s intention to place the army within the fortifications around Harrison’s landing, which I believe still stand, and where by the aid of his gunboats, he could offer a strong defense. I do not think it would be advantageous to attack him in that position…”\n\nThree hours later, Lee reported, “Genl Grant has moved his army to the James River in the vicinity of Westover. A portion of it I am told moved to Wilcox’s Landing, a short distance below… I apprehend that he may be sending troops up the James River with the view of getting possession of Petersburg before we can reinforce it. We ought therefore to be extremely watchful and guarded…”\n\nMeanwhile, Grant observed Federal engineers laying down a causeway across the James River. Spanning 2,200 feet, this was the longest and most flexible bridge ever built in the war. It involved linking 101 pontoon boats and anchoring them against the strong current over a river that was nearly 100 feet deep in the center. The bridge included a removable section to enable water traffic to pass.\n\nSatisfied with the work, Grant boarded a steamer to meet with Major-General Benjamin F. Butler, whose Army of the James was below the James, between Richmond and Petersburg. Grant reported to Chief of Staff Henry W. Halleck at 1 p.m.:\n\n“Our forces will commence crossing the James today. The enemy shows no signs yet of having brought troops to the south side of Richmond. I will have Petersburg secured, if possible, before they get there in much force. Our movement from Cold Harbor to the James River has been made with great celerity and so far without loss or accident.”\n\nGeneral Meade spent the day coordinating the Federal crossings at Wilcox Landing and the pontoon bridge. Lieutenant-Colonel Theodore Lyman, staff officer to Meade, documented Meade’s plan for the next day: “All the 2d Corps is to cross and advance tomorrow on Petersburg. The 18th Corps passed up the river in boats, this afternoon, and is to advance on Petersburg tomorrow from Point of Rocks, opposite Butler’s left on the Appomattox.”\n\nThe men of Major-General Winfield Scott Hancock’s Second Corps were ferried across the James all day, and engineers completed the pontoon bridge around midnight. This remarkable project involved 450 engineers working from both banks, and it took just seven hours to complete.\n\nMajor-General Ambrose E. Burnside’s Ninth Corps crossed during the night, and the rest of the army crossed using either the bridge or ferryboats the next day. The 60,000 men using the bridge had orders to keep the waves calm by not marching in step. The cavalry, the 35-mile wagon train, and about 3,500 heads of cattle also crossed on the bridge. President Abraham Lincoln responded to Grant’s message to Halleck: “Have just read your dispatch of 1 p.m. yesterday. I begin to see it. You will succeed. God bless you all. A. Lincoln.”\n\nThe big gamble worked. Grant was now in the rear of Lee’s Confederate army. What lay ahead for the Army of the Potomac was just a token force of Confederates led by General P.G.T. Beauregard and the vulnerable key railroad city of Petersburg. Grant directed Hancock to lead the march in that direction. Grant wrote his wife:\n\n“Since Sunday, we have been engaged in one of the most perilous movements ever executed by a large army, that of withdrawing from the front of an enemy and moving past his flank crossing two rivers over which the enemy has bridges and rail-roads whilst we have bridges to improvise. So far it has been eminently successful and I hope will prove so to the end.”\n\nMeanwhile, Beauregard observed Major-General William F. “Baldy” Smith’s Eighteenth Corps heading up the James toward Butler’s army. Beauregard sent a frantic message to Lee stating that if he did not send reinforcements to Petersburg immediately, only God Almighty could save the city. Lee replied, “I hope God Almighty will.”\n\nBibliography"
