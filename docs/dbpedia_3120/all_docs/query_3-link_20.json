        "text": "Seeing the light in Emilia's eyes, the general said in a deep voice, \"Master Emilia, the contradiction now lies in whether our God Army is attacking or defending.\n\nIf you attack, in terms of the current strength of the Divine Army, it would be irresponsible;\n\nBut if you shrink your defense, it will fall into the hands of the world. \"\n\nEmilia nodded: \"That's it.\"\n\nThe general said, \"My lord, that's not as good as this.\n\nThe main force of our **** army is still defense, and then select some daring warriors in the army to form a single unit to fight in a guerrilla manner, so that we can give the world an explanation, that is, the **** army is always dealing with demons. Army battle! \"\n\nEmilia was silent for a while and said, \"That means sending cavalry and angel troops to attack, right?\"\n\nThe general shook his head and said, \"Of course not. My lord, cavalry and angel troops are the top military forces of the gods. How can these resources be wasted on such things?\n\nWhat I mean is, recruit the death squad directly, but first pick out the elite cavalry, and look for them from ordinary cavalry and apprentice cavalry.\n\nMany crusaders now have the qualifications to become paladins. Similarly, many ordinary soldiers have more courage because of the heroic confrontation with the demons.\n\nTherefore, we must have no shortage of fighters who dare to attack bravely. As long as they are recruited to form a few quick assault troops, they can get the most benefits with the least force! \"\n\nEmilia asked: \"How to say?\"\n\nThe general said: \"The rapid assault troops we sent can block the mouths of the world's people and prevent them from saying that the gods will only be unable to shrink, and sit and watch the demons ruin the world; secondly, they can also make the demons unable to guess our intentions. , Thinking that we want to find a chance to attack them, so that the demon army will be at a loss, unless they eliminate all the assault troops, otherwise the **** army will not be able to attack the main force of the gods or attack other villages unscrupulously!\"\n\nEmilia nodded when she heard the words, and thought it was a more cost-effective operation.\n\nAs the first commander of the Divine Army, she was actually under great pressure.\n\nShe knows **** too well, and she also knows that the army of gods can't beat the army of demons no matter how hard it is at this time. And Emilia, as the commander-in-chief of the gods on this continent, would of course be responsible for the results of the **** war on this continent.\n\nAfter all, Emilia also didn't want the **** army to leave the superior area as said, and go out to face the demon army. It was a way of seeking death.\n\nTherefore, the proposals and ideas of these human generals really fit Emilia's original intentions, so she only agreed to the matter after considering it for a while.\n\nOf course, now the demon army is besieging the city, even if a quick assault force is formed, it can't get out.\n\nHowever, this plan is finalized, and when this wave of battle with the **** army is over, the guerrilla plan will be implemented immediately.\n\nAt this time, Mike happened to be coming in to tell the demon army how to use weapons, and he also heard what was discussed in the military account just now.\n\nSo Mike fell in love.\n\nAlthough participating in this kind of rapid assault force is very dangerous, for a natural soldier like Mike, that is the most desired thing!\n\nEarly the next morning, Mike came to his direct commander to inquire about this \"emergency assault force\".\n\nThe commander was very surprised and asked, \"Mike, you have made several battles and you are still one of the new Templar candidates. It takes only a few days to become a Paladin. Then you will be the glorious Church Corps. A member of, why do you want to inquire about this nine-dead mission now?\"\n\nMike laughed and said: \"Commander, I am eager to fight, and it is a fierce and exciting battle! Although becoming a Paladin is a very honorable thing for my family, but in the current situation, I need a Paladin. It is estimated that the battle to go out will be carried out a long time later.\n\nIf this period of time is short, but the war with **** has just begun. The formation of the gods is too short and insufficient training makes it impossible to face the demon army. The only few elite armies of the major kingdoms are due to long Time to participate in the battle and exhausted...\n\nTherefore, the decision to defend the city is correct, and it is also very understandable.\n\nBut I can't always defend passively, and I am eager to fight. My family heritage is not afraid of hardships and life and death, so I want to join this assault force to take the initiative to fight the demons! \"\n\nThe commander sighed and asked, \"Mike, I know your courage and abilities, but if you take part in such a dangerous mission like this, what should you do if you accidentally die? Don't you consider your parents?\"\n\nMike looked firm: \"Commander, there is no shortage of males in my family~www.mtlnovel.com~ Besides, I have two younger brothers. I want to use my practical actions to teach them by example and tell them that the honor of the family is not what it is. Relying on, but something we need to work hard to maintain!\"\n\n\"Well, I know your determination... Mike, this task is very dangerous. To put it bluntly, it is a death squad operation. I hope you can come back alive!\"\n\nMike saluted and said, \"I know, Lord Commander!\"\n\nIn the next few days, the demon army carried out three more siege operations, but they all returned to no avail.\n\nAfter several battles, the demon army has gradually become familiar with the attack and response methods of the devil. Although the number of casualties is still large, the morale has been significantly improved. Although the intensity of the demon armyâ€™s siege is high, the soldiers of the demon army are finally Can withstand the pressure so that the wall is not lost.\n\nOn the fourth day, a general keenly noticed that the demon army's siege strength had decreased and the number of high-level demons had also changed, so he guessed that the main force of the demons might have left.\n\nAmong the magicians who are good at summoning magic, they summoned bird and psychic beasts that can psychic with magicians for a short time, and went to the demon army to conduct investigation.\n\nThis kind of psychic beast is a magical summoning object, not a real animal. It was first invented to be controlled by training magic power. Later, after continuous development and improvement, it became one of the magicians' external investigation methods.\n\nThe advantage of this kind of psychic magic is that the magic psychic beast can become the spiritual carrier of the magician, which is equivalent to the magician himself observing the surrounding things.\n\nThis is much better than the scouts of the ordinary army, especially the falcons tamed, because falcons are birds after all and cannot communicate with humans. They can only get a vague information through training, so they cannot be compared."
