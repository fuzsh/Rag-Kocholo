        "text": "I got another email. Another letter. Another Facebook message. I heard it from another beautiful family who waited in line to get their books signed. I hear it all the time.\n\n“We are a military family. We love your stories because…”\n\nI’m from a military family. My dad (right) is a combat veteran, as was my grandfather (below). My mom (right) waited at home, pregnant with my oldest brother, while my dad was at war on the other side of the world. I grew up on stories of honorable service and among those who honorably served. I don’t always agree with United States policy (I doubt any of us do), but I have always had tremendous respect for, and profound gratitude toward, each and every man and woman who signs up to serve us in the military.\n\nMaybe that shows in my stories. I didn’t write these adventures for that reason, but I’m delighted to hear from military families repeatedly that they feel respected when they read. But more than respect, what I hear again and again (from so many wives of men who serve) is that the stories help their kids understand what their dad does.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard that. It always fills me with a gratitude and a wonderful humility. (It’s a feeling of being small, but having done something that mattered.)\n\nThis has been a gift to me. Because it means that I, in some small way, have been able to serve those who serve. I have had the privilege of serving their families, often while they are away and in harm’s way.\n\nI know I just said I felt humble, but I also feel proud to see these stories find their way into the hearts and homes of the brave warriors whose vocation is to protect my family’s lives and freedom.\n\nThis is why I dedicated The Last Archer, with gratitude, to all veterans and their families.\n\nI write about heroes and heroines. These men and women (and their families) live it. God bless all who serve.\n\nAlmighty Father, we commit to thy loving care all those servicemen and servicewomen upon whose faithfulness the welfare of our Armed Forces depends. In the fulfillment of their duties give them patience, loyalty, and courage; and grant that those who are sustained by their toil may remember them with gratitude; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”\n\n~An Anglican prayer from the Armed Forces Prayer Book, 1951~\n\n(L-R: My [Great]Uncle James, my Papaw, and [Great] Uncle Merrill)"
