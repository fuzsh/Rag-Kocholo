        "text": "By bbadmin\n\nAt the 2016 National Day of Prayer for Defence event in Canberra, Psalm 91 was read and referred to as the soldier’s psalm. I was interested in this and looked up the reference. Indeed Psalm 91 is quite commonly known as the soldier’s psalm as it is said many soldiers in WWI recited this psalm daily.\n\nIndeed I found a story circulating that tells of a Brigade commander in WWI who gave a little card with Psalm 91 on it to his men who were in the Brigade of the same number – 91st Brigade. They agreed to recite this daily. The story goes that after they started praying this prayer they were involved in three of the bloodiest battles in WWI yet suffered no casualties in combat despite other brigades suffering as much as 90%.\n\nIt is an interesting story yet there is dispute as to whether it is true. Whether it is true or not, this stories existence shows a bit of the mystique that has grown up around this psalm. I found some other interesting ways this psalm has been used – for instance it has been printed on bandanas to give to people going on operations. It has also been put onto military dog tags. I’m sure there’s much more. There seems to be a real fascination with this particular psalm as a prayer of protection.\n\nRegardless of such interest – as part of God’s word Psalm 91 does have much to say to us and it can indeed be a great encouragement to us.\n\nThe psalm is of a constant theme throughout about taking refuge in God and his protecting you when you do so. We are going to look at it in two halves. Firstly, let’s take a look at verses 1-8.\n\n1 Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High\n\nwill rest in the shadow of the Almighty.\n\n2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress,\n\nmy God, in whom I trust.”\n\n3 Surely he will save you\n\nfrom the fowler’s snare\n\nand from the deadly pestilence.\n\n4 He will cover you with his feathers,\n\nand under his wings you will find refuge;\n\nhis faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.\n\n5 You will not fear the terror of night,\n\nnor the arrow that flies by day,\n\n6 nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,\n\nnor the plague that destroys at midday.\n\n7 A thousand may fall at your side,\n\nten thousand at your right hand,\n\nbut it will not come near you.\n\n8 You will only observe with your eyes\n\nand see the punishment of the wicked.\n\nPsalm 91:1-8 (NIV)\n\nThis psalm is a truly bold declaration of trust in God. The writer of the psalm says that if you take refuge in God he will keep you safe – no exceptions. God will keep us safe from – traps, disease, terrors of the night, war and death. Such is the confidence of this psalm that it goes to the extreme of saying that a thousand or even ten thousand may fall beside you yet you will remain untouched if you refuge in God. That is bold trust.\n\nSee also the ways God is referred to – He is the Most High, the Almighty. It is he who saves. He is even described with the image of having wings to shelter and protect. His faithfulness is a shield. He is the punisher of the wicked. Such a God is seen as completely able to save any that take refuge in him. Nothing is beyond God’s power to help.\n\nThat is, God can keep you safe in the biggest problems of yours and can keep me safe in the biggest problems of mine. It’s easy to make such a declaration when things are good. Faith and hope declare it at the darkest times. Do we have this kind of bold trust and believe that nothing is beyond God?\n\nLet’s continue on with the rest of the psalm.\n\n9 If you say, “The Lord is my refuge,”\n\nand you make the Most High your dwelling,\n\n10 no harm will overtake you,\n\nno disaster will come near your tent.\n\n11 For he will command his angels concerning you\n\nto guard you in all your ways;\n\n12 they will lift you up in their hands,\n\nso that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\n\n13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra;\n\nyou will trample the great lion and the serpent.\n\n14 “Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him;\n\nI will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.\n\n15 He will call on me, and I will answer him;\n\nI will be with him in trouble,\n\nI will deliver him and honour him.\n\n16 With long life I will satisfy him\n\nand show him my salvation.”\n\nPsalm 91:9-16 (NIV)\n\nThis second half continues on the same theme – take refuge in God – he will keep you safe. Verse 9 parallels verses 1 and 2. Both call for us to make God our dwelling and in both the psalmist declares that God is their refuge. They are speaking from their own personal experience of faith in this God. He is reliable.\n\nHere we see protection from harm and disaster even to the point of angels supernaturally protecting us and dangerous animals being unable to harm us. It then changes voice from the author’s voice to God’s declaration that those who love him will come under his rescue and protection; that he will answer them when they call; be with them in trouble; honour them; give long life and show his salvation to.\n\nThis seems to pretty comprehensibly say, that for those who take refuge in God, there is nothing from which he cannot save you, nor is there anything God won’t save you from. What a declaration!\n\nA key idea in this psalm is the idea of dwelling in and under God’s protection and taking refuge in him. This raises the question of, ‘where is your refuge?’ There are so many things we can take refuge in. We can take refuge in our financial security, our family and friends, our apparent talent and success, or we can take refuge in a fantasy dream that we aspire to. Now don’t get me wrong, being financially stable, having a great family and social life, using our God given talents and having dreams and aspirations are not bad things, but they should never eclipse us taking refuge in God. If any of those things got taken away would you still have the same constant refuge? If your refuge is God then any of these things can go or change and you can still know that you are safe and secure.\n\nConsider the Apostle Paul who in Philippians 3:7-11 (NIV) said he counted all things as a loss or even as garbage compared to the ‘surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus’ our Lord. If all other things fall away and you still have God you still have everything you need.\n\nIf we were to simply stop our consideration at this point, one could come up with the summary that we should all take refuge in God and he will look after us completely. This is actually true, however it might not be in the way we expect or perhaps want. There’s more to unpack about this.\n\nFor instance listen to these words from the book of Job.\n\nJob 5:19-25 (NIV)\n\n19 From six calamities he will rescue you;\n\nin seven no harm will touch you.\n\n20 In famine he will deliver you from death,\n\nand in battle from the stroke of the sword.\n\n21 You will be protected from the lash of the tongue,\n\nand need not fear when destruction comes.\n\n22 You will laugh at destruction and famine,\n\nand need not fear the wild animals.\n\n23 For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field,\n\nand the wild animals will be at peace with you.\n\n24 You will know that your tent is secure;\n\nyou will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.\n\n25 You will know that your children will be many,\n\nand your descendants like the grass of the earth.\n\nThis sounds quite similar to Psalm 91. But here it is in the mouth of Eliphaz one of Job’s so called comforters who tries to apply truth about God without a full knowledge of the situation. Job was suffering greatly despite being a righteous man and his friends simply spout their theology at him instead of coming alongside him and loving him. Like this we too should be careful that we don’t apply the truth of Psalm 91 blindly.\n\nThere is also another danger found in a famous passage which quotes verses 11-12.\n\nMatthew 4:5-7 (NIV)\n\n5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 6 “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:\n\n“‘He will command his angels concerning you,\n\nand they will lift you up in their hands,\n\nso that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”\n\n7 Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”\n\nHere we see the devil using this psalm in his attempt to corrupt Jesus. The temptation was to take God’s promised protection and put it to the test. This would be a wilful test and not true trust. Jesus sees through the devil’s trap and rebukes him with more scripture properly used. This is why it is important that we don’t interpret Psalm 91 the way the devil tried to get Jesus to. We too are not to test God. Let’s not think that by declaring these words in Psalm 91, God must protect us.\n\nThere is a similar danger in the use of this psalm where people might turn faith into superstition. Parts of this psalm have been worn on amulets as a form of magical protection as though the words themselves have power. In the use of this psalm in military contexts it is important that when used it points to the God who rescues and not to the psalm as a source of some kind of power. The idea that by repeating it over and over you will somehow be safe is nothing more than superstition. But looking to the God who keeps us safe and even using suitable words from this psalm is good and fine.\n\nBut this isn’t everything the psalm raises for us. It seems to promise full protection from so much. But what about –\n\nTruly faithful believers who suffer some of the most devastating tragedies.\n\nChristians persecuted and killed by Islamic State.\n\nChristians who have lived and died under so many cruel regimes over the long stretches of history.\n\nEven in the Bible, people like Job, the prophets and the apostles suffered immensely.\n\nIndeed time and time again we see that God rescues people from certain things but still they face much suffering. How can Psalm 91 fit with this reality? Is it merely encouraging words which don’t deep down reflect reality?\n\nI think it is important that we look to the one and only person who could 100 percent have claimed these promises. All the rest of us have sinned and fall short of God’s glory and though we truly might take refuge in God, none have ever done so constantly and completely as Jesus did – he is the one who truly was without sin and took refuge in his heavenly Father all the time. If anyone could claim the full protection of angels, it was Jesus. Yet remember how he responded to Satan’s temptation. He refused to put God his Father to the test. The one man who could claim these promises trusted that the Father’s will was the best and right way – a way that involved much suffering and hardship. Look at these famous words from Isaiah 53 that prophesied this.\n\nIsaiah 53:3-5,10-12 (NIV)\n\n3 He was despised and rejected by mankind,\n\na man of suffering, and familiar with pain.Like one from whom people hide their faces\n\nhe was despised, and we held him in low esteem.\n\n4 Surely he took up our pain\n\nand bore our suffering,\n\nyet we considered him punished by God,\n\nstricken by him, and afflicted.\n\n5 But he was pierced for our transgressions,\n\nhe was crushed for our iniquities;\n\nthe punishment that brought us peace was on him,\n\nand by his wounds we are healed.\n\n…\n\n10 Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer,\n\nand though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin,\n\nhe will see his offspring and prolong his days,\n\nand the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.\n\n11 After he has suffered,\n\nhe will see the light of life and be satisfied;\n\nby his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many,\n\nand he will bear their iniquities.\n\n12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,\n\nand he will divide the spoils with the strong,\n\nbecause he poured out his life unto death,\n\nand was numbered with the transgressors.\n\nFor he bore the sin of many,\n\nand made intercession for the transgressors.\n\nJesus chose this hard path because he followed the will of the Father. There was a greater purpose in that path. This road led him to suffer and die in the place of sinners like you and me so that we might have forgiveness and life. Without this suffering of Jesus we would still be in the dire situation of having to deal with our own sin. We can be very glad Jesus didn’t take the easy way out.\n\nAnd did you see right there, with the foretelling of his suffering were descriptions of his seeing his offspring, of prolonged days, of seeing the light of life, having a portion among the great – all pointing to his resurrection and eternal rule? So too Psalm 91:16 (NIV) says With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.” Jesus’ resurrection helps us make sense of this psalm. Jesus who fulfils the Old Testament hopes, lived with his Father as his refuge and through an unexpected way via suffering, he fulfils this psalm’s hope that God will keep safe all who take refuge in him.\n\nIn our case also it must be said that in an ultimate sense God does indeed protect all those who take refuge in him. Even those who are martyred for the faith are safe in Christ and find as 2 Corinthians 4:17 (NIV) put it – their ‘light and momentary troubles’ have achieved for them ‘an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.’ This is our great hope.\n\nYet from our earthly perspective our here and now troubles of life can often cloud out this reality and take on a bigger part of our vision than they ought.\n\nBut notice that even within Psalm 91 in verse 15 it is noted that God will be with us ‘in’ trouble. People of faith are not immune from suffering, in fact often faith brings suffering, but the great news is that God will be with us if we trust in him no matter the trouble we face. And the good news continues that we are eternally safe in God’s arms.\n\nThe soldier’s psalm – Psalm 91 can indeed provide a great encouragement to soldiers, but equally to farmers, and teachers and mechanics and doctors and well – you get the idea. Yet it’s not because of some mysterious power in the words themselves, but it’s the way it points us to the one who truly can save you from all the perils of life and death. It encourages us to make God our refuge and boldly trust his protection.\n\nMichael Nott MCF Administrator 2016"
