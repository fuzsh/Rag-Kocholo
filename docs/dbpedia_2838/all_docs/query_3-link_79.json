        "text": "You don’t need to be told how important your social media visuals are. In fact, a survey found that 63.2% of businesses rely heavily on images and videos as part of their marketing strategy.\n\nThere are so many platforms and so many rules.\n\nGetting your visuals to look good on everything from Facebook to Pinterest is difficult without a guide. So we decided to make one.\n\nWe’ve looked at the various sizes and dimensions you need to know to make your social accounts look great and do what they’re supposed to.\n\nAll of the sizes in the titles are recommended ones. Often, you can use larger sizes but stick to the aspect ratios to ensure images and videos display correctly.\n\nBelow, you'll find dimensions for the following platforms:\n\nFacebook\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\n\nInstagram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nYouTube\n\nPinterest\n\nTikTok\n\nSnapchat\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nFacebook profile picture size: 196 px x 196 px\n\nMost likely, the most-viewed picture you’ll post on the platform – your Page’s profile picture – will act as your avatar across the site.\n\nIt’s often the first thing people will see when they come across you and will appear alongside your posts, your comments, and pretty much all of your Facebook activity.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe picture will display at 176 x 176 pixels on computers and 196 x 196 pixels on smartphones\n\nFor best quality, your uploaded photo should be at least 320 x 320 pixels\n\nIt needs a 1:1 aspect ratio\n\nThe picture will be cropped to a circle\n\nFacebook cover image size: 851 px x 315 px\n\nIntroduced in 2011, Facebook cover photos give you a huge chunk of space at the top of your page to stick a photo or a video.\n\nThis is a great way to add more character to your page without sacrificing your pretty profile picture.\n\nGuidelines\n\nFor best results, the picture must be at least 400 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall\n\nThe aspect ratio is 16:9\n\nRemember that your profile picture partially covers the left-hand side of your cover photo\n\nYou can upload a single photo or multiple photos that will be displayed as a slideshow\n\nGet all the details for cover images here\n\nFacebook shared link image size: 1200 px x 630 px\n\nThis refers to the image Facebook uses when it generates a box from a shared link. You also get the content’s title and description along with the image.\n\nGetting the image size right is integral to making your content look good whenever someone shares it on Facebook. Get it wrong, and the image can be cropped poorly or stretched out.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe link image is automatically pulled from the destination web page\n\nConsider how the image will fit with your content’s title and description\n\nThe image must be smaller than 8 MB\n\nIf you have issues sharing an image link, you can fix it with the Sharing Debugger\n\nFacebook post image size: 1080 px x 1350 px\n\nThat’s the best recommendation for making an image look good on your timeline and on your fans’ Newsfeeds.\n\nGuidelines\n\nMultiple placements are available for your image posts on and off your Timeline.

Particularly so if you’re a brand.\n\nMost commonly, companies will use their logos, but some also make seasonal edits to spruce them up and grab a bit of attention now and then.\n\nGuidelines\n\nRemember that the profile picture will be circular\n\nRecommended image size: 400 by 400 pixels\n\nMinimum image size: 200 by 200 pixels\n\nThe aspect ratio is 1:1\n\nMaximum file size: 2 MB\n\nX in-stream photos image size: 1600 px x 900 px\n\nAs previously mentioned, sharing images increases engagement and gets more people to see your content. Getting the right image size will help you maximize results.\n\nX will crop and resize based on the image you use.

A 320 px x 320 px image will ensure it looks good across all devices.\n\nGuidelines\n\nKeep the aspect ratio to 1:1\n\nThe profile picture will be cropped to a circle\n\nInstagram photo sizes:\n\n1080 px x 1080 px (square)\n\n1080 px x 566 px (landscape)\n\n1080 px x 1350 px (portrait)\n\nThis refers to the photo seen in the Instagram feed or when tapped on from elsewhere (such as someone’s profile page).\n\nGuidelines\n\n1080 px is your limit – anything over, and you’ll have to crop your image\n\nAlways remember how it looks on mobile is more important than on desktop\n\nInstagram thumbnail image size: 161 px x 161 px (1:1)\n\nThis is how your picture will appear on someone’s profile page or in a hashtag search. Something that catches the eye can be important.\n\nGetting this right is very handy if you’re showcasing products, while even more so if you want to turn your entire profile page into a single picture.\n\nGuidelines\n\nIf your image is a 1:1 square, you can go straight away\n\nFor rectangle or vertical photos, Instagram will crop from the center\n\nInstagram Stories and Reels size: 1080 px x 1920 px\n\nInstagram Stories and Reels are the most popular content forms on Instagram, and uploading them in the correct size format is important to catch the eye of the viewer.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe ideal size for Instagram Stories and Reels is 1080 px x 1920 px\n\nThe aspect ratio is 9:16\n\nThe video might get cropped to fit the ratio if you don't stick to the ratio\n\nThe recommended size for the Reel cover photo is 420 px x 654 px\n\nOther Instagram sizes\n\nRecommended Instagram video aspect ratio: 1:1 ratio (square), 1.91:1 (horizontal), 4:5 (vertical)\n\nCarousel posts and ads: 1080 px x 1080 px (square), 1080 px x 566 px (landscape), and 1080 px x 1350 px (portrait) are also supported and can be a video or static image\n\nInstagram ads size: 1080 px x 566 px (landscape), 1080 px x 1080 px (square), 1080 px x 1920 px (Stories)\n\nLinkedIn company logo image size: 400 px x 400 px\n\nYour company logo image will lead your brand’s way on the platform. It’s generally just filled out with your logo.\n\nThis is probably the best approach for a platform like LinkedIn, but if you feel like trying something different, go ahead.\n\nGuidelines\n\nImages smaller than 400 px × 400 px work but risk being cropped and pixelated\n\nThe image will be cropped into a circle\n\nThe image must be a JPEG or PNG file and under 3 MB\n\nLinkedIn Page’s cover image size: 1128 px x 191 px\n\nHere, we have a massive space for an image on your LinkedIn Page.

Spend some time thinking about the best choice for you.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe recommended image size is 800 px x 800 px, any smaller than that, you risk a low-quality image\n\nIf you are uploading a photo, make sure it's centered\n\nThe profile picture will be cropped into a circle\n\nDisplays as 98 x 98 pixels\n\nImage types: JPG, GIF, BMP, or PNG\n\nYouTube channel cover image size: 2560 px x 1440 px\n\nAlso referred to as ‘channel art,’ this will sit at the top of your YouTube channel.

Take a look at some of the most subscribed-to YouTubers to get some inspiration.\n\nYouTube Shorts size: 1920 px x 1080 px\n\nYouTube Shorts are a great way to post snackable content.
