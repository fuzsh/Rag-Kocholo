        "text": "The Ideal YouTube Thumbnail Size with Best Practices and Examples\n\nDo you feel your YouTube videos aren’t performing as they should? The competition on YouTube is crazy. But that doesn’t mean you can’t taste success on this platform. You’ve put in so much effort to offer your target audience the best content from your side. But your videos are not getting views as people are scrolling past your videos. They may not lack valuable content. But to understand the value, first, you need people to click through your videos.\n\nUsing an eye-catching thumbnail is a non-negotiable aspect of making people interested in watching your videos. You need to know the appropriate thumbnail size for YouTube to get started.\n\nIn this blog post, I’ll discuss the ideal YouTube Thumbnail size, share YouTube Thumbnail best practices and examples for your inspiration, and share attention-grabbing YouTube Thumbnail Templates from our DocHipo library to smoothen your design process.\n\nWhy Should You Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails?\n\nYou might already know that a YouTube Thumbnail can make or break your videos. A well-designed thumbnail can get you the number of views your hard work deserves. But a poorly designed one will make your videos remain unseen.\n\nYouTube always generates three thumbnails from your video. 90% of best-performing YouTube videos use custom thumbnails. Hence, creating and uploading a custom thumbnail is the best way to stand out.\n\nCustom YouTube Thumbnails allow you to develop your brand aesthetic and thus improve your brand recognition.\n\nFor example, observe the custom thumbnails of DocHipo’s YouTube Channel with a pastel color scheme, still images, and concise and large text on them.\n\nWhat is the YouTube Thumbnail Size?\n\nGoogle recommends the ideal YouTube Thumbnail size to be 1280 pixels by 720 pixels. The minimum width of a thumbnail should be 640 pixels. The YouTube thumbnail dimension maintains an aspect ratio of 16:9.\n\nYouTube Thumbnail images should be under 2 MB. The acceptable YouTube Thumbnail image formats are JPG, GIF, and PNG.\n\nYouTube Thumbnail Best Practices with Examples\n\nNow that you know the best YouTube Thumbnail size go through the best practices for creating compelling YouTube thumbnails.\n\n1. Your Custom Thumbnail Must Represent Your Video Accurately\n\nSuppose you’re searching for a movie on YouTube; you see the title on the thumbnail and click on it. Now you realize the content is entirely different.\n\nHow would you feel? Annoyed, right?\n\nYou don’t want to create such an impression on your viewers as they will question your authenticity. So, never use images or titles unrelated to your video content. Otherwise, you’ll harm your YouTube channel due to poor audience retention.\n\nCreate custom thumbnails to show your target audience a glimpse of what they can expect from your video.\n\nFor example, look at the YouTube Thumbnail Template where a kid is giving last-time exam revisions. It can be used to share tips on the same.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nSimilarly, the image and the illustrations used in the template below convey the monsoon season and can be used in that context.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\n2. Use Intriguing Pictures\n\nGrab the attention of your viewers using a compelling image that makes them curious and excited to see more of it.\n\nFor example, look at the thumbnails of BackPacker Steve that will awaken the traveler within you.\n\nSimilarly, the beautiful image in the YouTube Thumbnail Template will set the mood for experiencing such a holiday.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nSimilarly, animal lovers or anyone who wants a fun time can not resist clicking on the video by seeing the cute panda in the thumbnail.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nOur DocHipo library offers you premium-quality stock images for your custom YouTube thumbnails.\n\nCheck out How To Use Stock Images In Your Design.\n\nYou can enhance images with DocHipo even if you upload photos from your device.\n\nWatch our video demonstration on enhancing pictures with DocHipo.\n\n3. Add a Shortened Version of Your Video Title in the Thumbnail\n\nThe video thumbnail will catch YouTube users’ attention whether they read the title or not. So leverage this opportunity to include a shortened version of your video’s title in the thumbnail.\n\nIn the YouTube thumbnail example below for our video on how to create an animated GIF card, we shorten the title from:\n\n“How to Create an Animated GIF Card that Wins Hearts” to “Animated GIF Card”\n\nTake the examples of the beauty and kids’ YouTube Thumbnail Templates below.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\n4. Ensure the YouTube Thumbnail Text is Easily Readable\n\nSuppose you’re adding an eye-catching title to the YouTube Thumbnail, but nobody can read it because of its small size. Then what’s the use of it?\n\nSo whatever text you add, make it easy to read for your potential viewers.\n\nFor example, Cultfit has made its thumbnail text large, bold, and eye-catching to read.\n\nSimilarly, check out our DocHipo YouTube Thumbnail Templates with large fonts to make the text visible.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\n5. Use Contrasting Colors\n\nWhatever colors you choose for your YouTube Thumbnail image, ensure they draw the viewers to the videos. Go for colors having high contrast between the background and the text.\n\nFor example, look at the vibrant and charming color combinations of Hubspot Marketing’s YouTube Thumbnails.\n\nLook at DocHipo’s pre-designed YouTube Thumbnail Templates, designed with this best practice.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\n6. Show the Face in Your Custom Thumbnail Image\n\nInclude your face in the thumbnail image to make eye contact with the viewers. It’ll create a face-connect and build a stronger and deeper connection with them. An eye is a medium to express a variety of emotions. So, depending on the context of your video, reflect the feelings of joy, compassion, fear, anger, shock, frustration, etc., and communicate to your viewers.\n\nThe expressive thumbnail image feels more personable and raises the viewers’ curiosity to explore the video in-depth.\n\nFor example, observe the thumbnail of CA Rachana Phadke Ranade, looking directly into the viewer’s eyes. In addition to creating high-quality thumbnails, it’s also important to consider advertising your videos through YouTube Ads to increase your views and engagement\n\nYou can customize the YouTube Thumbnail Templates by replacing the images with that of your own.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nRefer to our demonstration on removing background from a picture within minutes.\n\n7. Maintain Consistency in Your Thumbnail Designs\n\nBe consistent in your YouTube Thumbnail design regarding layout, color scheme, font style, size, etc. Whenever you upload a new video, refresh your thumbnail by changing the image, title, or graphics if needed. This way, viewers will easily recognize your brand while scrolling through YouTube videos. If they’re fond of your brand and its content, they’ll click on your video, increasing the views.\n\nLook at how Neil Patel does a brilliant job by remaining consistent with the color scheme, font style, and size exclusive to his personal brand.\n\n8. Utilize Whitespace and Negative Space\n\nIf your thumbnail looks busy and cluttered, it’ll repel your potential viewers. Whitespace or negative space refers to the blank space around or in between the subjects of an image. You might have heard that “less is more.” So, take the opportunity to show your creativity to make your thumbnail design look clean and more attractive.\n\nFor example, look at Yoga With Adriana’s YouTube Thumbnails.\n\nLikewise, you can implement this by leveraging the following YouTube Thumbnail templates.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\n9. Include Your Brand Logo or Business Name\n\nAdd your business logo to your custom YouTube Thumbnail design to strengthen your brand presence. Also, place it in the same place in the thumbnail each time.\n\nFor example, Vogue always incorporates its logo in the bottom left-hand corner.\n\nSimilarly, observe the logo placement in the following DocHipo YouTube Thumbnail Templates.\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nGet This Template and More\n\nHow to Make a Thumbnail for Youtube with DocHipo?\n\nCreating custom YouTube Thumbnails from scratch to maintain consistency on the platform is tiresome work.
