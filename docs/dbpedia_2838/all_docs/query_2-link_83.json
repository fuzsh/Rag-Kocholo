        "text": "The new Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice came into effect on July 1, 2017. All registered early childhood educators (RECEs) were mailed a copy. The 2017 edition replaces the original version, published in 2011.\n\nThe new Code and Standards reflects many significant changes the profession has undergone since 2011. It places greater emphasis on leadership, relationships, well-being, learning environments, current pedagogical approaches and the value of communication and collaboration. It also provides more clarity on use of the protected title, the duty to report and dual relationships, and addresses the use of technology.\n\nThe Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice sets out the professional knowledge, skills, values and expectations applicable to all registered early childhood educators (RECEs) regardless of role and the setting in which they may practise. It also communicates to RECEs and the public the scope and nature of the profession. As regulated professionals, RECEs are expected to act with integrity and adhere to the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice at all times within their workplace and the community.\n\nEach of the six Standards of Practice has three elements:\n\nPrinciple – serves as an important summary of each standard and offers key highlights of the knowledge and practice sections from each standard.\n\nKnowledge – identifies the knowledge related to each standard that RECEs must have in order to practise the profession\n\nPractice – the skills, actions and behaviours related to each standard that RECEs must demonstrate in order to practise the profession\n\nThe four ethics and six professional standards are interconnected, and taken together, they support RECEs in using their professional judgment and making ethical decisions in their daily practice."
