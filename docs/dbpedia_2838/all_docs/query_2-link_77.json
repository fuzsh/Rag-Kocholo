        "text": "YouTube channel graphics display differently on many devices, including desktop, Smart TVs, phones and tablets.\n\nFor optimal results on all devices YouTube recommends uploading a single 2560 x 1440 px image that has been optimized to fit the below template:\n\nNote: All of the pixel dimensions have more than doubled from what you would measure on normal monitors. This is to accommodate high quality retina displays. On non-retina displays the image will be scaled to less than half the size with the same aspect ratios.\n\nHow Channel Artwork is Displayed on the Desktop\n\nThe slice below would be your desktop banner. Its total dimensions are 2560 X 423 px.\n\nNew channels will have a flexible width on desktop, meaning that the site will scale to reveal more content on larger browser windows. There is a minimum size at which point the site would no longer adapt and a scroll bar would appear in the browser window. At the minimum width the channel art is 1546 X 423 px (this is the “Safe area” given that text & logos will not be cut off). At the maximum width, the channel art is 2560 X 423 px. This means that the “SAFE AREA” (channel art at minimum width) will always be visible and the areas to the right and left (shown with green arrows) might be visible depending on the viewer’s browser size.\n\nTotal Size: 2560 X 423 px\n\nSafe Area (Always visible): 1546 X 423 px Centered on the image\n\nFlexible Area (may be visible): 507 px to the left and 507 px to the right of the safe area.\n\nExample of channel at Minimum width:\n\nExample of channel at Maximum width:\n\nHow Channel Artwork is Displayed on TV\n\nThe whole image will be used. Aspect ratio is 16:9 i.e. 2560 x 1440 px\n\nHow Channel Artwork is Displayed on Mobile\n\nOn mobile we will be using the safe area scaled down to the width of the mobile screen (which varies by device).\n\nHow Channel Artwork is Displayed on Tablets\n\nOn tablets we will be using a slightly wider slice. The aspect ratio of this slice is 1855 by 423 pixels.\n\nYouTube Channel Icon\n\nYour YouTube Channel icon displays at 90 x 90 pixels. For best results upload an 800 x 800 pixel image. The maximum file size is 1MB. Non-square images will be cropped. If you want to create any separation between your channel icon and your channel artwork, you will need to include a border within your channel icon.\n\nVideo Thumbnails\n\nVideo Thumbnails show up in various places both on YouTube directly and on other sites. Here are a few tips to ensure an attractive video thumbnail:\n\nClear, in-focus, high-resolution (640 x 360 pixels minimum, 16:9 aspect ratio)\n\nBright, high-contrast\n\nClose-ups of faces\n\nVisually compelling imagery\n\nWell-framed, good composition\n\nForeground stands out from background\n\nLooks great at both small and large sizes\n\nAccurately represents the content\n\nGeneral Guidelines"
