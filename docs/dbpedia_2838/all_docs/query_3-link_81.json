I would still like to be able to manage the thumbnail size (I'm trying to keep the number of thumbnails created to a minimum to save server space). Can I do so via functions.php or by editing the file in question with my child theme?\n\nNot sure why the image size options have been removed from the WP customiser? That would be the quickest way to resolve this wouldn't it??\n\nIt should be achievable by modifying the files, but we do not provide help with such customization, and you should contact your web developer.\n\nImage sizes are predefined to look best for specific product styles and to prevent possible problems regarding this.\n\nBest regards"
