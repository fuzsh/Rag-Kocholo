        "text": "https://youtu.be/2N9am-UEcpA Welcome to a new episode of Liquid Margins, the video podcast by Hypothesis that dives deep into the world of social annotation and its impact on education. This episode, titled \"Boosting Grades, Retention, and Engagement with Social Annotation,\" will feature a compelling discussion with Professors Francie Quaas-Berryman and Kristin Polizzotto from Cerritos College and CUNY Kingsborough Community College. Key Takeaways: Addressing Reading and Learning Challenges: Learn more about the challenges faced by educators in creating engaging and meaningful learning experiences. Our esteemed faculty guests will share their experiences and how they overcame it. Social Annotation as a Strategy for Success: Delve into the strategies employed by our guests to incorporate Hypothesis into their teaching. Discover how social annotation moved the needle on traditional reading and discussion formats, leading to significant improvements in student engagement and comprehension. Direct Impact on Student Outcomes: Discover the tangible outcomes of implementing social annotation, including dramatic improvements in student grades, retention rates, and overall class participation. Cultivating Community and Engagement: Explore the role of social annotation in building a vibrant learning community within the classroom and innovative ways our faculty panelists are implementing it. This episode of Liquid Margins is a must-watch for educators, instructional designers, and education technology enthusiasts looking to harness the power of social annotation to boost student outcomes. Join us as we uncover the strategies, challenges, and triumphs of integrating social annotation into the classroom, straight from the educators who've experienced it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eyrnhYe3N4I Dive into the forefront of educational innovation with our latest Liquid Margins episode, “AI and the Future of Learning - Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities”. Scheduled for Thursday, February 15, at 1pm ET, this episode is set to provide an in-depth exploration of the transformative role and evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the educational landscape. Joined by faculty from SUNY New Paltz, The University of Oklahoma, and College of Western Idaho, in this episode we will explore the advancements, challenges, and significant transformations AI has introduced to education. We'll also predict the future of AI in education in 2024, with a focus on: The Evolution of AI in Education: Examining the changes and developments in the educational landscape due to AI since our last discussion. Innovations and Impacts: Highlighting key AI advancements and their transformative effects on teaching and learning. Challenges and Solutions: Discussing the obstacles encountered in integrating AI into educational systems and the solutions forged. The Role of Social Annotation in AI: Explore how social annotation can be used to mitigate the challenges of AI in the classroom and enrich learning experiences. Looking Ahead: Predicting the future of AI in education, exploring expectations and possibilities for educators, students, and administrators. Regardless of your experience level with social annotation, this episode is designed to offer valuable insights on AI in your classroom and provide strategies for AI and social annotation for 2024. Expect to gain practical tips and immediately applicable strategies for your courses.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4d9PEt1jUG8Join us for an exploration into the groundbreaking research from Nicholas Denton, senior lecturer of pharmacy education and innovation at Ohio State University. During this episode of Liquid Margins, we'll traverse the challenges Professor Denton faced with his students, especially when confronted with intricate research-oriented texts, and their imperative need for research literacy. We’ll dive deep into the transformative influence social annotation had that not only shattered barriers of complex jargon but also created an environment where undergraduate students achieved an impressive 2x increase in graduate-level comprehension.Discover the near-perfect student engagement levels, the psychological safety social annotation extended to underrepresented groups, and its role in fostering professional identity, particularly evidenced by the significant improvements in student self-efficacy.\n\nDo you want to transform the way you engage students and stimulate active learning? Join us for \"Liquid Margins 43: Mastering the Craft and Unleashing the Power of Instructional Annotations\" on August 1st at 12 PM ET, an exploration into how educators themselves annotate the margins of course texts to bring their readings alive for students and inspire student engagement. Get ready to dive deep into pedagogical strategies. From instructors who create annotations as signposts or discussion prompts on a reading to those who focus on responding to student questions and comments to further the conversation, you’ll learn best practices for instructional annotation from active Hypothesis educators. Join us as we uncover how these small notes in the margin can lead to major breakthroughs in learning.\n\nSocial annotation has seen widespread adoption in reading-intensive humanities courses. But reading is important in STEM education too, and social annotation can be leveraged to address the unique pedagogical challenges and opportunities in STEM disciplines. Tune into our next exciting installment of Liquid Margins, titled Liquid Margins 42: Annotating the Future, Reimagining STEM Education on June 28th at 12 PM ET. We will journey through the landscape of social annotation with a special focus on STEM fields, from computer science to biology to mathematics. Hear directly from STEM educators who have successfully integrated social annotation into their teaching. Whether you're a STEM educator looking for new ways to engage your students, or you're just curious about the intersection of technology and education, this episode will provide you with valuable insights. Let's learn together and reimagine the future of STEM learning.\n\nThis fall, once again, we are afloat in a sea of uncertainty. Will we be face-to-face? Hybrid? Hyflex? Or just high anxiety? No matter where we find ourselves in autumn, one thing’s for certain: We can anchor class community in reading using social annotation. Join us as we share the screen with educators who have long been using social annotation to make reading active, visible, and social."
