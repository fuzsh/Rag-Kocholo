        "text": "YouTube thumbnails are best when they’re 1280×720 pixels, with a minimum width of 640 pixels (on a 16:9 ratio).\n\nThe file size should be under 2MB, and it’s good to use formats like JPG, GIF, BMP, or PNG for the best quality.\n\nMake sure your thumbnail stands out and gives a clear idea of what your video is about.\n\nRequirements for YouTube Thumbnails\n\nThese are all a must — you should stick to them whenever you’re designing new thumbnails.\n\nAdditionally, make sure you respect these:\n\nYouTube’s Community Guidelines\n\nThumbnails policy\n\n1. Size\n\nIdeal size: 1280 x 720 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)\n\nMinimum width: 640 pixels (to ensure good quality when scaled down)\n\nMaximum file size: 2MB\n\n2. File Type\n\nJPG (.jpg)\n\nPNG (.png)\n\nGIF (.gif)\n\nRealistically, JPG is the best format, followed by PNG. Nobody really goes for GIFs when it comes to thumbnails.\n\n3. Why these specifications?\n\nThe 1280 x 720 size is large enough for high-quality previews even on larger screens. YouTube will scale it down for smaller displays.\n\nA minimum of 640 pixels wide ensures the thumbnail won’t look blurry on any device.\n\nThe file size limit is to keep thumbnails loading quickly.\n\n4. Bonus Tips\n\nUse clear, eye-catching images that represent your video content.\n\nInclude text overlays to highlight keywords and benefits.\n\nUse contrasting colors and bright elements to grab attention.\n\nKeep it simple – avoid cluttering the thumbnail with too much information.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create YouTube thumbnails that will help your videos stand out and get more clicks.\n\nYouTube Thumbnail Size (in cm)\n\nThe perfect size for YouTube thumbnails in centimeters is: W = 33,87 cm x H = 19,05 cm.\n\nThank you for reading this,\n\nThumbnail Test\n\nFAQ: YouTube Thumbnail Size\n\n1. Can a YouTube thumbnail be 1920×1080?\n\nYes, a YouTube thumbnail can be 1920×1080 pixels. This size fits the 16:9 aspect ratio YouTube prefers and ensures your thumbnail looks sharp on various devices.\n\nHowever: The minimum size YouTube recommends is 1280×720 pixels. Just make sure the file size doesn’t exceed 2MB.\n\n2. What is the best YouTube thumbnail size?\n\nThe best YouTube thumbnail size is 1280×720 pixels, with a minimum width of 640 pixels. This size fits the 16:9 aspect ratio YouTube uses for its player.\n\nUsing this size ensures your thumbnails look good on different devices, from smartphones to large screens.\n\n3. What does “16:9” mean in a YouTube thumbnail?\n\n16:9 refers to the aspect ratio — which is the width of an image or screen in relation to its height.\n\nFor a 16:9 aspect ratio, for every 16 units of width, there are 9 units of height.\n\nThis ratio is standard for YouTube thumbnails and videos, providing a widescreen look that fits most modern screens and devices well.\n\n4. Is JPG or PNG better for thumbnails?\n\nFor most YouTube thumbnails, JPG works well, balancing quality and load speed. Use PNG if you need high detail or transparency.\n\nPerks of each format:\n\nJPG: Great for smaller files, which speeds up loading times. Ideal for images with lots of colors and gradients. However, it uses lossy compression, which can reduce quality.\n\nPNG: Offers higher quality with lossless compression, so it’s sharper and clearer, especially for images with text or icons. But, the file size can be larger, which might affect loading times."
