Located in Northern Manitoba, our institution seeks to bring out the potential of our students and our local community, which consists of a young and growing population that is more than 70% indigenous. UCN is positioned to contribute significantly to the social, cultural, and economic development in our region and the entire Manitoba province.\n\nExplore Our Course Offerings\n\nUCN offers accredited on-campus and online classes for our degree, certificate, and diploma programs.

UCN recognizes that truth must precede reconciliation. Therefore, UCN commits to seeking and sharing the truth of Indigenous people. This truth includes the legacy of Indian Residential Schools, the Sixties’ Scoops, the appropriation of land, the failure to respect treaties and the continuation of colonization. The journey toward reconciliation begins with truths and the work of reconciliation is the responsibility of all UCN faculties, departments, and areas.\n\nLand Acknowledgment\n\nUCN acknowledges that we are on the traditional territories and homelands of many Indigenous peoples, in particular the Cree, Dene, Red River Métis, and Oji-Cree; Indigenous peoples have continuously maintained homelands in northern Manitoba since time immemorial. The First Nations in the area that UCN serves entered into treaty relationships with the Crown (within our region these include signatories to treaties 4, 5 -- and the treaty 5 adhesion, and treaty 6 – located within the treaty 5 adhesion). The territory has also become home to other Indigenous peoples. We uphold the treaties and collaborate with all Indigenous peoples to share truth, reconciliation, and learning.\n\nPrimary Care Paramedic\n\nThe Primary Care Paramedic program at UCN prepares you for a rewarding career in paramedicine. This two-year diploma program emphasizes the new regulatory standards, including anatomy and physiology. It enhances mental health awareness, ensuring time for personal growth, and a deeper understanding of the skills and academic knowledge needed to succeed as a paramedic.\n\nApply now for Fall 2024.\n\nLakota Blackbird was expected to get her hands dirty on day one.\n\n“Actually, it was my first day and they had me tear apart a computer, like my very first day, without reading anything,” she said. “I was like, should I be doing this?”\n\nNRMT Loves Hardcore Camping!\n\nThe Natural Resources Management Technician Program students get to experience winter and fall camp. The camps take place in semi-remote wilderness settings where students are immersed in the life of fieldwork and camp living. Take a look.\n\nDegrees, Certificates, Diplomas\n\nThe University College of the North is the northern Manitoba's place of learning. UCN offers accredited on-campus and online degrees, certificates and diplomas.\n\nUCN's Response to the pandemic\n\nThe health and safety of the University College of the North campus community are top priorities.\n\nUCN continues to closely monitor the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) through information released by reliable, trusted sources such as the Government of Canada and Government of Manitoba.
