        "text": "Every video in your Vimeo OTT catalog has a thumbnail image that is displayed to give your customers a preview of the content of the video. This default image is formatted in the 16:9 aspect ratio and is automatically generated every time you upload a video.\n\nYou may also, optionally, upload alternative images to your content to provide a variety of image types. Below is a table of the image sizes that can be added to each of your videos. Once you have provided these images, you can then configure your Categories to display those images instead of only using the 16:9 standard thumbnail.\n\nImage Type\n\nAspect Ratio\n\nRecommended Size*\n\nPrimary Thumbnail\n\n16:9\n\n3840 x 2160\n\nVertical Keyart\n\n2:3\n\n4000 x 6000\n\nSquare Keyart\n\n1:1\n\n6000 x 6000\n\nFeatured Carousel Wide\n\n16:6\n\n3840 x 1440\n\nFeatured Carousel Mobile\n\n16:4\n\n3000 x 2625\n\n*These sizes are recommended but not required. JPG and non-transparent PNG formats are supported as filetypes.\n\nThese alternative images are entirely optional and not required to run your OTT Service.\n\nIf you provide the Featured Carousel images, the Title, Description, and Calls to Action that are shown on your site's browse page by default will be hidden, giving you full control over the canvas area and messaging that is displayed. Be mindful of this when configuring your Featured Category.\n\nReplace primary thumbnail image\n\nWhen you upload a video, OTT will automatically generate a 16:9 thumbnail for the content. This will also automatically generate Vertical and Square images based on that thumbnail.\n\nIf you wish to replace your Primary Thumbnail, navigate to Content, select the video, extra, or collection you want to edit, then scroll down to find the Primary Thumbnail. Hover your cursor over the image and click the More Options (•••) icon in the top right of the image and choose Replace.\n\nSelect a new file and your Primary Thumbnail and alternative images will automatically update with new imagery.\n\nIf you wish, you can then customize even further by providing different image files for the Vertical and Square key art images. On the Edit page under General > Thumbnail, scroll down a little further to find the alternative thumbnails.\n\nTo replace an image, hover your cursor over the image, click the More Options (•••) icon in the top right corner of the preview, and choose Replace.\n\nOnce your custom images have been uploaded, you can select the More Options (•••) icon in the top right of the image and select Crop to open up our cropping tool. This will allow you to maintain the aspect ratio of the image but select a different portion of it to display to customers on your site.\n\nDrag the blue selection area to the zone you want to crop to and drag the corners of the blue outline to change the size of the crop area. When you’re satisfied, click Done and be sure to save your video's settings."
