This means that the width should be 1.9 X the height to avoid cropping issues.\n\nYour image shouldn't be larger than 8MB.\n\nImage size should be 1200 X 630 pixels (px).\n\nThe minimum size is 200 x 200 px, however, we recommend keeping it to 600 x 315 px.\n\nIf your image is smaller than 600 x 315 pixels, it will appear as a small image in the link preview.\n\nImportant:\n\nIf you recently updated your og:image, we recommend entering your site URL in Facebook debugger so that your site information is up to date.\n\nIf you are using a different social network:\n\nTwitter Card Validator\n\nPinterest Debugger\n\nLinkedIn Post Inspector\n\nNote:\n\nIf you share blog posts or URLs on Whatsapp, the image preview will only be displayed if the image is under 300 KB."
