        "text": "Displaying theme thumbnail images\n\nA complete Stencil theme includes screenshots to display the theme on cards that appear in two locations within a non active MSF BigCommerce control panel:\n\nStorefront › Themes: Each individual card displays a composite which is an image that contains combination of screenshots of the theme's multiple variations.\n\nStorefront › Themes Marketplace: Each card displays one variation of your theme. The three variations of Cornerstone (Light, Warm, and Bold) are displayed across three separate cards.\n\nGeneral image requirements\n\nAll screenshots described below must meet the following specifications in order for the stencil bundle command to be able to process them:\n\nMust be saved to a supported image file type: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, or .gif.\n\nMust be stored in your meta/ (opens in a new tab) subdirectory.\n\nMust be in portrait aspect ratio.\n\nTheme-wide composite image\n\nThe theme-wide composite image represents your theme in a non-active MSF BigCommerce control panel's Storefront › Themes, which shows merchants their currently available themes, including any custom uploaded themes.\n\nThis file will normally be a mosaic of screenshots from multiple variations within your theme. It must meet the following requirements, beyond the general specifications above:\n\nResolution of 600 x 760 pixels (horizontal x vertical).\n\nFile size smaller than 2 MB.\n\nArbitrary filename prefix, referenced in your config.json (opens in a new tab) file as the meta object's composed_image key value.\n\nHere is an example of a compliant file type and location:\n\nmeta/composed.png\n\nHere is how you would reference this file within config.json (opens in a new tab).\n\nVariations: desktop and mobile screenshots\n\nEach variation within your theme must be represented by two additional screenshots if you want that variation to appear in a non-active MSF control panel's Storefront › Theme Marketplace, which shows merchants the themes that are available for download.\n\nDesktop screenshot\n\nThe first screenshot, showing your theme on a desktop viewport, must meet the following requirements beyond the general specifications above:\n\nResolution of 2048 x 2600 pixels.\n\nFile size smaller than 5 MB\n\nArbitrary filename prefix, referenced in your config.json (opens in a new tab) file as the variations object's desktop_screenshot key value.\n\nMobile screenshot\n\nThe second screenshot, showing your theme on a mobile viewport, must meet the following requirements beyond the general specifications above:\n\nResolution of 304 x 540 pixels.\n\nFile size smaller than 1 MB.\n\nArbitrary filename prefix, referenced in your config.json (opens in a new tab) file as the variations object's mobile_screenshot key value.\n\nBelow is an example showing two files of compliant types and location.\n\nmeta/desktop_bright.png\n\nmeta/mobile_bright.png\n\nHere is how you would reference these files within config.json (opens in a new tab), for a variation named Bright:\n\nResources\n\nRelated articles"
