        "text": "abozaid Ibrahim\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n3 min read\n\n·\n\nNov 4, 2023\n\n--\n\nImage Size\n\nHow do we reduce image size?\n\nThe choice of method depends on your specific use case and the trade-off between image quality and file size. In many cases, a combination of these techniques may be used to optimize images for a website or application. Image compression is particularly valuable for balancing file size reduction with acceptable image quality.\n\nImage Compression:\n\nLossy Compression: This method reduces the image size by permanently removing some of the image data. It achieves high compression ratios but at the cost of some loss in image quality.\n\nLossless Compression: This method reduces image size without any loss in quality. It works by finding and encoding patterns in the image data, resulting in a smaller file size.\n\n2. Resizing:\n\nResizing an image to smaller dimensions is a straightforward way to reduce its size. This method doesn't alter the image quality but may change the visual details.\n\n3. Cropping:\n\nCropping involves cutting out parts of an image. It's useful for reducing size when you want to focus on a specific area. Like resizing, cropping doesn't necessarily affect image quality.\n\n4. Image Format Optimization:\n\nUsing more efficient image formats like WebP or AVIF can provide smaller file sizes compared to traditional formats like JPEG or PNG. These formats may employ advanced compression techniques.\n\n5. Image Optimization Tools:\n\nVarious tools and libraries can automatically optimize images by applying both lossless and lossy compression techniques to reduce file size while preserving quality.\n\n6. Lazy Loading:\n\nLazy loading delays the loading of off-screen images until they are needed, which can reduce initial page load times.\n\n7. Responsive Images:\n\nProviding different image sizes for different devices and screen resolutions ensures that you're not serving larger images than necessary.\n\n8. Vector Graphics:\n\nFor certain types of images, using vector graphics like SVG can result in very small file sizes as they are resolution-independent.\n\n9. CSS Sprites:\n\nCombining multiple small images into a single image (sprite) and using CSS to display specific parts can reduce the number of HTTP requests and, in turn, reduce page load times.\n\nResolution/Dimensions\n\nSome examples from apps you are using daily to help you define your app image dimensions.\n\nagain size could be very different depending on the resizing technique you are using so WhatsApp thumbnail could be a few kb and could be 100 kb.\n\nExamples\n\nFacebook profile photo: 170 x 170 pixels\n\nFacebook post image size: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nInstagram post size: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nInstagram profile picture size: 110 x 110 pixels\n\nThe thumbnails that preview your uploads on your profile appear as 161 x 161 pixels.\n\nInstagram Story size: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nInstagram Reels size: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nInstagram Reels are a full-screen video 1080 x 1920 pixels, or a 9:16 aspect ratio.\n\nPinterest profile image size: 165 x 165 pixels\n\nTwitter profile photo size: 400 x 400 pixels\n\nTwitter header photo size: 1500 x 500 pixels\n\nTwitter Card (or shared link) image size: 1200 x 628 pixels\n\nTwitter post photo size: 1600 x 900 pixels\n\nYouTube profile image size: 800 x 800 pixels\n\nYouTube video thumbnail image size: 1280 x 720 pixels\n\nLinkedIn company profile photo size: 300 x 300 pixels\n\nLinkedIn company banner photo size: 1128 x 191 pixels\n\nLinkedIn post image size: 1200 x 1200 pixels\n\nLinkedIn profile picture size: 400 x 400 pixels\n\nAspect ratios\n\nIn general, don’t go for wide and low aspect ratios.
