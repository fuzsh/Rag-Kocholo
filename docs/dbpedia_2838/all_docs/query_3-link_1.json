You can pick from the available thumbnail sizes.\n\nIn this article, you’ll see the difference between all the available Thumbnail sizes.\n\nMedium Sized Thumbnails\n\nLarge Sized Thumbnails\n\nAutomatic Thumbnail Size\n\nMedium Sized Thumbnails\n\nChoosing a medium thumbnail size will make your website load faster.\n\nHowever, the image size will be smaller, which, in some cases, will reduce the image quality, so that is something to keep in mind when choosing this option.\n\nAs for the actual thumbnail size, a medium thumbnail will have a maximum width and height of 300 pixels.\n\nLarge Sized Thumbnails\n\nUnlike the medium size, choosing a large one will not interfere with the quality of your images. However, the website may run slower.\n\nA large thumbnail size’s maximum width and height values are 1024 pixels.\n\nAutomatic Thumbnail Size\n\nThe third option you can choose here is an automatic thumbnail size. As the name implies, this option will automatically select the best recommended size for the thumbnail.\n\nMoreover, if you use an image optimization plugin (Optimole, for example) and choose this option for the thumbnail size, the image will be automatically set to “Large.”\n\nThis was a quick explanation of the different kinds of Thumbnail sizes you can pick from."
