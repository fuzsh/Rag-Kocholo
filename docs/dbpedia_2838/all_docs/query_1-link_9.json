Such a democracy is essential in building a more just future for all our children. And to build that future, we need inclusive education to develop understanding of these foundational principles.\n\nInclusive education promotes learning spaces that are affirming and safe for all young people, considers representation of diverse identities in curricula and policies, and is intentional in creating equitable opportunities for all children to learn and thrive.\n\nThis week, we offer a short resource, “Tips for Advocating for Inclusive Education,” that provides recommendations for parents, caregivers and other family and community members to help you to advocate for inclusive education in your communities. And we highlight articles to further conversation and encourage advocacy."
