        "text": "YouTube is the most popular video streaming platform, boasting 122 million active daily users.\n\nWith 1 billion hours of content being watched worldwide every day, your content needs to stand out if you want people to watch it.\n\nOne important strategy to maximize the eyeballs on your videos is to create attention-grabbing thumbnails in the right size for YouTube.\n\nWondering what the ideal YouTube thumbnail size is? In this guide, we’ll cover precisely that, plus we’ll share some tips for creating engaging thumbnails, free tools you can use to make them, and best practices you should follow to get the most out of your thumbnails.\n\nReady to find out more? Let’s go!\n\nThe Best YouTube Thumbnail Size\n\nThe best YouTube thumbnail size is 1280 x 720 pixels\n\nThe ideal aspect ratio for YouTube thumbnail images is 16:9\n\nThe minimum size is 640 pixels wide\n\nThumbnail images should be under 2MB\n\nImage formats are JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nWhat Are YouTube Thumbnails Used For?\n\nYouTube thumbnail images are the small graphics used to represent YouTube videos. They’re meant to attract attention and get people to watch your videos.\n\nCheck out some examples of YouTube thumbnail images from Wishpond’s YouTube channel below:\n\nYouTube thumbnails are basically like a book cover. They’re a visual representation of the video’s content created to pique interest and curiosity.\n\nWhy Are YouTube Thumbnails Important?\n\nAlthough they say you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, most people do just that!\n\nThe same applies to YouTube thumbnail images. This means your thumbnail image can be the difference between your video getting tons of views or tanking completely.\n\nLuckily, YouTube allows you to upload custom thumbnails.\n\nBy default, YouTube pulls three still frames from your video that you can use as your thumbnail image.\n\nWhile that’s the easier approach, the best way is to use a custom thumbnail image.\n\nCheck out these two images from a recent Wishpond video on Peloton. Which do you think is more eye-catching?\n\nOr:\n\nA custom thumbnail will help your video stand out from the rest and significantly affect your audience growth.\n\nCustom thumbnail images are also a fantastic way for you to develop the look and feel of your brand.\n\nThe great thing about a custom video thumbnail is that it’s a pretty quick process to create one.\n\nAnd considering you’ve already invested so much time into researching, planning, organizing, filming, and editing your video, the little extra time it takes to create custom thumbnails shouldn’t bother you.\n\nYou’ve come this far. You might as well go all the way and give your video the best chance of success!\n\nWhat is the YouTube Thumbnail Size?\n\nNow that you know how important it is to create custom thumbnails, you might wonder what the YouTube thumbnail size is?\n\nAccording to Google, the recommended YouTube thumbnail size is 1280 x 720 pixels, with a minimum width of 640 pixels and a 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\nYou can use the image below as a template for your YouTube thumbnail dimensions.\n\nGoogle explains the reason your YouTube thumbnail image needs to be so large: “Your custom thumbnail image should be as large as possible, as the image will also be used as the preview image in the embedded player.”\n\nIt’s called a thumbnail because it often appears as a small image in places such as users’ feeds or related content:\n\nBut your YouTube thumbnail image also needs to be large enough not to look pixilated when its shown in the full video player:\n\nThe accepted image formats for YouTube thumbnails are JPG, GIF, BMP, or PNG.\n\nFinally, make sure your custom thumbnail stays within the maximum file size of 2MB.\n\nHow to Add a Custom YouTube Thumbnail to Your Video\n\nNow that you’ve made a custom thumbnail, how do you go about uploading it to YouTube?\n\nFirst, click the “Create” button to upload your YouTube video.\n\nNext, head to your YouTube Studio dashboard’s “Content” section.\n\nClick on the pencil icon on the YouTube video you just uploaded to edit its settings.\n\nIn the “Thumbnail” section, you’ll see three autogenerated thumbnails taken from your video.\n\nClick on the “Upload Thumbnail” link in the box next to the generated thumbnails and select your own thumbnail to upload.\n\nTips For Creating Engaging YouTube Thumbnails\n\nAs mentioned above, creating YouTube thumbnails is important to help your video stand out, but sometimes it can be tough to create a thumbnail image for every YouTube video you upload.\n\nTo help, here are some tips for creating engaging YouTube thumbnails.\n\n1. Use A Still From Your Video\n\nThis is a thumbnail image at its most basic.\n\nOn the odd chance that YouTube automatically chose the best still image from your video for you to use as your thumbnail image, you can just select it, and you’re done.\n\nIf you’re not so lucky, you can use video editing software to export a still image from your video.\n\nFinally, if you’re changing thumbnails on your old YouTube videos and don’t have access to the originals anymore, you have two options.\n\nThe first is to download the video via YouTube studio and export a still image using video editing software.\n\nThe second option is to watch the video in fullscreen, pause on the frame you’d like to use, and take a screenshot.\n\nYou can either use just the plain image or add some simple text, such as a shortened version of the video’s title.\n\n2. Make A Custom Image\n\nA popular option among brands is to create a graphic that visually represents what’s in the video. Usually, these also include a short text explaining the content and the brand’s logo.\n\nCheck out the example below of the YouTube thumbnail we created for our video that teaches you three lessons from Peloton’s dramatic rise and fall.\n\n3. Mix Graphics With A Still\n\nTo create eye-catching YouTube video thumbnails, try combining graphic elements with a still image taken from the video.\n\nThis type of thumbnail image is perfect for videos with people, such as tutorials, vlogs, or educational videos.\n\n4. Write Attention-Grabbing Titles\n\nYour video title is one of the most important aspects of your YouTube video.\n\nIncluding it in your YouTube thumbnail is vital. The goal is to inform potential viewers about what to expect from your video while trying to grab their attention.\n\nFor example, our YouTube video about Peloton could’ve been called “Everything you need to know about Peloton” or “3 Lessons from Peloton’s Rise and Fall | Peloton Explained”.\n\nDo you have a preference? Odds are you would’ve clicked the second one since it’s more attention-grabbing.\n\n5. No Misleading Images & Titles\n\nIf you’re trying to drive traffic to your YouTube videos, odds are you that you’re doing everything you can to get the most out of your thumbnail images and titles.\n\nWhile there is nothing wrong with that, you need to make sure that you don’t go overboard and create misleading thumbnail images and titles.\n\nThis means the text of your thumbnail should speak to the content of your video and not promise something that it can’t deliver.\n\nYou should also keep your target audience in mind when you create a YouTube thumbnail, as you don’t want to use images that would turn them away.\n\nFinally, don’t use other people’s images without permission since reverse image search tools make it easy for image owners to track this and cause trouble for your YouTube channel.\n\n6. Test Various Thumbnails\n\nIf you’ve come up with a new YouTube thumbnail design, be sure to test if it’ll resonate with your audience.\n\nTo do so, choose a well-performing video and change its thumbnail to your new design. If the click-through rate of the video increase, you’ll know that your audience is responding to the design.\n\nThe great thing about testing is that you can keep doing it over and over as long as the videos you use give you enough data to work with. If a video only gets a handful of clicks in a month, it’s not a good data source and can’t prove anything about your tests.\n\nThere are a plethora of fantastic tools out there to help you create attention-grabbing YouTube thumbnails.\n\nHere we look at 3 free ones that are amazing!\n\nPhotopea\n\nPhotopea is a browser-based Photoshop clone that offers most of the features available in Adobe’s flagship photo editing software.\n\nIt’s great for power users looking to control all the technical details of their thumbnail design.\n\nIt features a limited selection of templates you can use for inspiration and allows you to easily import any type of media you’d like to include in your thumbnail.\n\nAll of these features and it doesn’t even cost a cent! Now that’s a price you can’t beat.\n\nCanva\n\nCanva is one of the most popular online graphic design tools.\n\nOne great feature is that it includes a whole host of templates created specifically for YouTube thumbnails. You also have a great selection of fonts, stock images, illustrations, and icons to choose from.,\n\nWhile the basic version is free and gives you access to 1GB of storage, for $12.95 per month, you get access to additional features such as stock images, templates, and graphic elements.\n\nFigma\n\nFigma is another fantastic graphic design tool that lets you do everything from prototyping to finished designs.\n\nWhile it lacks templates for YouTube thumbnails, it is a fully-featured design package giving you all the flexibility you need to create great thumbnails.\n\nIts Starter package is free, giving you unlimited personal files, but for unlimited Figma files and other professional features, you’ll need to pay $12 per month.\n\nYouTube Thumbnail Best Practices\n\nNow that the technical details are out of the way let’s look at some things you can do to grab potential viewers’ attention and get them to watch your video.\n\nKeep these YouTube thumbnail best practices in mind:\n\n1. Don’t Mislead Viewers\n\nNo one likes clickbait, so don’t mislead your viewers by including things in your YouTube thumbnail that aren’t covered in your video.\n\nNot only does this annoy people you’re hoping to turn into engaged subscribers, but it’ll also damage your YouTube channel.\n\nThis is because of “Audience Retention.” What’s that, you ask?\n\nIt’s a metric used to measure the quality of your views and is based on how long people watch your videos, not how many views they got.\n\nYouTube’s algorithm boosts channels with high retention, so it’s a very important metric!\n\nIf you mislead viewers with your YouTube thumbnails, they will click away as soon as the video starts, and they realize you’ve tried to dupe them.\n\nThis will have a huge negative impact on your audience retention score, and your YouTube channel will suffer as a result.\n\n2. Add A Short Version Of Your Title\n\nThe odds are high that most people will look at your YouTube thumbnail before reading the title.\n\nThat’s why it’s a good idea to include your title in the thumbnail.\n\nBut to avoid your YouTube thumbnail from looking to crowded, if the title is too long, consider condensing it for readability’s sake.\n\nIn the example thumbnail of our Peloton video below, we shorten the title from:\n\n“3 Lessons From Peloton’s Rise and Fall | Peloton Explained”\n\nTo\n\n“3 Lessons From Peloton”\n\nTake note that the shortened title highlights the key point of the video, the three lessons you can learn from Peloton.\n\n3. Make Thumbnail Text Easy To Read\n\nUsing text to highlight the most important point of your video is a great way to get clicks, but only if people can read it!\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that many people browse YouTube on mobile devices, so text that looks small in your desktop browser will look tiny in the YouTube app.\n\nIf you’re trying to keep your text small, so it doesn’t cover the thumbnail image, consider not including text at all and letting the visual convey the message.\n\n4. Create Eye-Catching Thumbnails With Contrasting Colors\n\nIf you want your YouTube thumbnail to capture the attention of viewers and increase the chance of them clicking, consider using vibrant, contrasting colors.\n\nContrasting colors are also a great way for you to help your text stand out in your thumbnail, making it easier to read.\n\nTry out different contrasting colors to see which ones work best for your YouTube channel’s aesthetic.\n\nDon’t be scared to turn up the saturation of your colors to make your thumbnails really draw users’ attention to them.\n\n5. Don’t Ignore Negative Space or Whitespace\n\nA lot of YouTube channels create YouTube thumbnails that are way too packed with text and graphics.\n\nWhile you want to let potential viewers know what to expect from your video, you don’t have to cram your thumbnail full of info to do so.\n\nA powerful strategy to make eye-catching designs is to create space around the subjects of your thumbnails. This is known as whitespace or negative space.\n\nJames Hoffmann uses this strategy for his YouTube video thumbnails to give them a sleek feel and make both the visual and the text pop out at you.\n\n6. Include Your Logo\n\nIncluding your logo or company name in your YouTube thumbnail is a great way to improve your brand’s online presence.\n\nBe sure to place it in the same location so that your brand can have a consistent look online.\n\nCNBC puts its logo in the top-left corner of each YouTube thumbnail image.\n\n7. Stay Consistent\n\nIf you want to develop a solid online presence for your brand, you need to stay consistent.\n\nThis means no matter what YouTube thumbnail design you end up choosing, it’s important to stay consistent. A consistent look makes it easy for people to recognize your videos in their feeds.\n\nTest out various custom YouTube thumbnails until you find a design that works for you, then stick with it.\n\n8. Use Color To Differentiate Content Types\n\nIdeally, your YouTube content strategy will include multiple types of content in order to keep viewers interested.\n\nGenerally, most channels will be able to group their content into a few different categories.\n\nIdentify what recurring content types your channel has, then select a dominant color for each of the content types and use that in your YouTube thumbnail templates to make it easy for people to distinguish between your content types.\n\nThis will help viewers easily find the type of content they’re after, increasing your views.\n\nThe Complete Guide to YouTube Shorts\n\n18 Powerful Ways to Grow Your YouTube Channel\n\n12 Youtube Analytics Every YouTuber Should Know\n\nHow to Make Money On YouTube: Every Strategy You Can Use to Cash In\n\n8 Best Practices & 3 Ideas for YouTube Contests\n\nWrapping Up\n\nIt should now be clear how important a good YouTube thumbnail is if you want to increase the views and engagement on your videos.\n\nWhen trying to make the ideal YouTube thumbnail, don’t forget:\n\nThe perfect YouTube thumbnail size is 1280 pixels by 720 pixels.\n\nDon’t mislead people with your YouTube thumbnail.\n\nInclude a short version of your title in your YouTube thumbnail image.\n\nEnsure your text is readable even on mobile devices.\n\nUse contrasting colors to create an attention-grabbing thumbnail.\n\nMake your thumbnail look professional with negative space.\n\nInclude your logo in a consistent location in your thumbnail.\n\nTest thumbnail designs to find the best for your channel.\n\nStay consistent with your thumbnail design.\n\nDifferentiate your content types with color.\n\nHopefully, these tips will help you create eye-catching thumbnails that will increase views on your videos.
