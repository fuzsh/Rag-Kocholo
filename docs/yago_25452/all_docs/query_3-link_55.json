Founded in 2010, MobileFuse leverages a number of data feeds to understand not only who someone is, but also what is going on in the world around them. By combining this environmental data with personalized creative, MobileFuse is able to reach a receptive audience for a brand’s marketing content. Most recently, MobileFuse added Digital Out of Home, so marketers can now access all the “on the go” screens through our solutions.\n\nKen has more than twenty-five years of experience in the ad-tech scene, which enables him to provide unique perspectives on what brands, agencies and ad-tech platforms are thinking about. He is a credible authority on all things digital advertising and has provided expert commentary to some of the top publications in the advertising and marketing industry. His comments have been featured in Wired, VentureBeat, AdExchanger and more, covering a wide range of mobile topics, including iOS ad-blocking, privacy, and beacon technology, to name a few.\n\nKen’s expertise hasn’t been solely contained to his time with MobileFuse. Prior to MobileFuse, he co-founded ToneFuse, one of the world’s largest marketing platforms for mobile content subscriptions, which he later sold to Bandsintown. He also founded PrimaryAds, a leading performance, affiliate marketing company that was sold to Inuvo Inc. in 2007.\n\nOutside of the office, Ken has served as a guest lecturer at Cornell’s Johnson School of Management, focusing on Entrepreneurship, and has spoken at many conferences.
