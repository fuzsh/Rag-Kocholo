        "text": "Article content\n\nTragedy followed Marie Prevost from her Sarnia hometown to Hollywood where she found, and lost, fame as a moving picture star.\n\nShe was born Mary Dunn in Sarnia in the late 1890s, shortly before her father, railway conductor Arthur Dunn, died in 1897 in an accident in the St. Clair River tunnel.\n\nHe was one of three railway workers who suffocated in the coal gas-filled tunnel before they could be rescued from a stranded freight train that came loose from its locomotive.\n\n\"Dunn was a highly popular young man about town,\" and leading player on the Sarnia Hockey Club, the Sarnia Daily Observer reported the next day.\n\nHis widow is said to have remarried Frank Prevost who moved the family to Denver, where Marie's sister Marjorie was born.\n\nEventually, the family settled in Los Angeles where Marie caught the eye of Quebec-born Mack Sennett, the director and producer behind early silent films by Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle and the Keystone Cops.\n\nPrevost appeared in her first film not long after Sarnia celebrated officially becoming a city, and she went on to become one of Sennett's most popular \"bathing beauties,\" a group of attractive young women who appeared in bathing suits in short silent films.\n\nPrevost soon moved on to other studios, including Universal and MGM, becoming a popular leading lady through the early 1920s in films that included The Marriage Circle, Three Women and Kiss Me Again.\n\nIn a magazine story Prevost is credited as writing about herself at the beginning of that decade, she described herself as a tomboy growing up, and mentioned the town where she was born.\n\n\"Folks who live there say it's a city, but New Yorkers wouldn't,\" it says.\n\nPrevost's star began to fade later in the 1920s, although she continued to appear in films, including Getting Gertie's Garter, Seven Sinners, Man Bait, Night Bride, Almost a Lady and The Girl in the Pullman.\n\nAfter the talkies arrived, Prevost moved to supporting roles, including the 1930s film Paid, with Joan Crawford, and the 1932 Jean Harlow film, Three Wise Girls.\n\nBut, Prevost was struggling. She had started drinking after her mother died in 1926 in a car accident while she was on her way to visit her starlet daughter in Palm Springs.\n\nThe actress had also divorced, twice.\n\nAn Associated Press story from 1929 about her divorce from Kenneth Harlan said, \"Miss Prevost accused her former husband of throwing wild parties and making fun of her career as a bathing beauty.\"\n\nThe 1930s were a difficult time for Prevost. She was no longer a star, she didn't have a contract with a studio and any money she had made was gone.\n\nBy January 1937, she was living in a small apartment in Hollywood where neighbours said bill collectors were often heard knocking on her door.\n\nWhen she hadn't been seen for a couple of days, the super sent a houseboy to her apartment with a passkey.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported he found her body. It's believed she had been dead for two days.\n\nSeveral empty whiskey bottles were in the sink, and teeth marks on her body indicated her pet dachshund, Maxie, had tugged on her in an attempt to wake her up.\n\nPolice also found an IOU on Prevost's dressing table made out to Crawford.\n\nThe Internet Movie Data Base lists 120 film credits for Prevost between 1915 and 1936.\n\nShe received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, but was largely forgotten, except for a song about her tragic death by British singer-songwriter Nick Lowe that appeared on his 1978 solo album, Jesus of Cool."
