        "text": "Mark was born on October 20, 1947 in Minneapolis Minnesota, to Kenneth and Carmel (Spano) Harlan the fourth of five children. He attended St. Charles Borromeo Catholic elementary school followed by high school at St. John’s Seminary in Collegeville, MN. He went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota and then an MA and PhD in anthropology from the University of Arizona.\n\nMark is survived by his wife, Deni, his mother, Carmel Harlan, sisters Mary Zubrzycki, Ann Conser, and Beth Harlan as well as 32 nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his father, Kenneth Harlan, and sister, Cathy Lane.\n\nHe was a devoted husband, loyal friend, dedicated son and brother, and a respected and published scholar whose brilliant perspectives, warm soul, and quest for adventure and insight were apparent until the end. He was strong and supportive, dedicated and independent, insightful and provocative, and analytical and introspective.\n\nMark had a diverse and prolific career path in both the academic and private sectors, where he was able to apply his considerable analytical, mathematical, programming, and language skills to constructive use. He taught Anthropology at the University of New Mexico, worked as associate director at the Office of Contract Archaeology, and then, for 20 years, at the Public Service Company of New Mexico as an archaeologist, planner, and international business developer. During this time, he met the love of his life and future wife, Deni Seymour. After leaving PNM Mark became the general manager at his wife’s company, Lone Mountain Archaeological Services. The couple took an early retirement which gave Mark more time for videography, travel, and archaeological research, and to take up music. He always enjoyed cooking for friends and family and was generous in his hospitality. He leaves behind many friends who will dearly miss his humor, insights, occasional jabs, and never-ending ability to enjoy life. He died with dignity, just as he had done so in life as he struggled with dignity, bravery, and fortitude through two years of illness.\n\nSome of his many publications may be found at: https://independent.academia.edu/Harlan.\n\nFellowship Fund\n\nMark was unable to complete his life’s work before his untimely death brought on after a two-year fight against cancer. Consequently, a fellowship is being established in his name. The fellowship will be announced in various venues when details are finalized, and will also be publicized at the following webpage so that donations in his name can be made: http://www.seymourharlan.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page43.html\n\nTwo Memorials Will Occur:\n\nMinneapolis\n\nJune 24, 11:00 am visitation for half hour before Mass, internment about 2:00 pm.\n\nSt Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, 2739 Stinson Blvd, St Anthony, MN 55418; Father Troy Przybilla\n\nAlbuquerque\n\nJuly 9, 11 am to 3 pm, bring recollections to share. For time and location email: denijseymour@aol.com."
