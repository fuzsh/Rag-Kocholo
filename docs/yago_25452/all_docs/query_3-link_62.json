After graduating high school, he started attending Eastern Kentucky University. It was there in 1972 that he joined the Kentucky State Police. On August 31, 1973 he graduated as Valedictorian of KSP Graduating Class 47 and began a 34 year and 11 month career as Unit 491, having retired August 2006.\n\nAlthough Ken was well know as a Trooper for Post 10 Harlan, he was equally known for his love of music, especially Bluegrass. He was proud to be a founding member of the Harlan Co. Ramblers and played in many other bands over the years. Being a jack of all trades and master of none, his woodworking skills have won several awards for the Fiddles he had built. His community service was always something he enjoyed, he served as Past President of Harlan Rotary Club and in his retirement years he became one of the founding members of the Black Mountain Offroad Adventure Area, that still continues to this day. Ken was an advocate for Harlan County and over the years he had a passion for showing off the mountains of Harlan County, He always remarked that, \"We ourselves have no idea of the beauty and potential we have right here in these mountains\".\n\nKen was a true Republican. He never missed a chance to talk politics and you always knew where he stood on issues. He had another passion as well, for the UK Wildcats. It didn‘t matter what was going on or when it was, Ken made sure he found a TV with the game on.\n\nBesides his parents he was preceded in death by several siblings.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 27 years, Drenda Crider; his daughter, Carissa Armbruster and David; son Josh (Amanda) Adams; grandchildren, Paityn Wynn, Landon Armbruster, and Allison Elise Adams; 1 brother, Tom (Jan) Crider; 1 sister, Sue Hickman; he leaves a host of nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends to mourn his passing.\n\nVisitation will be 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm Monday (Aug. 14) at Anderson-Laws & Jones Funeral Home.\n\nA Celebration of Ken's Life will follow at 2:00 pm in the Chapel of Anderson - Laws & Jones Funeral Home where stories of Ken‘s life will be told by his dear friends and the music he so cherished will be played. A closing prayer will be by Ken's cousin, Rev. Larry Johnson.\n\nTo recognize Ken's years of service, the Kentucky State Police Honor Guard will stand guard over their fallen brother during visitation with a flag presentation following the funeral service.\n\nBurial will follow at Resthaven Cemetery at Keith, KY (Where he now becomes a registered Democrat)\n\nBill Dean, KSP Commissioner Phillip \"PJ\" Burnett, Jr, Keith Saylor, Jack Miniard, Rob McGeorge, Trevor Pryor, Steve Tolliver, Francisco Roman, and Ray Doepel have the Honor of serving as Pallbearers.\n\nPlease feel free to leave a condolence or memory at www.aljfh.com\n\nKen was a man who didn‘t hold grudges, that being said, his dear friend John Jones, being a Tennessee fan is handling the arrangements for a true Big Blue fan.
