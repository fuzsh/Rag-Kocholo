        "text": "Kenneth D. “Kenny” Halcomb, 85, longtime Mooresville resident and business owner passed away peacefully at home on December 15, 2023. Kenny was born one of nine children on November 3, 1938, in Harlan, Kentucky, to the late Dewey and Ethel (Deckard) Halcomb.\n\nKenny attended high school in Kentucky before moving to Indiana to become a butcher at the age of sixteen. Early on, he worked at various butcher shops before opening Mooresville Meat Packing, which eventually became Kenny’s Fine Meats. A butcher for over 68 years, Kenny was a true craftsman in his trade. Strongly devoted to his work and his beloved customers, he continued to work until his recent terminal illness diagnosis. Kenny’s generosity was one of his strong character traits that made him a very likable and honorable man. He fed many who could not afford to feed themselves through the years.\n\nHe was an avid golfer, making many friends through a sport he genuinely loved. He was also passionate about any game of chance. Kenny enjoyed playing all kinds of card games, playing the lottery, and loved to scratch off those winning numbers. He was always particular about his appearance and dressed nicely. Kenny was also strongly devoted to his family and always enjoyed telling about his grandchildren’s latest sporting accomplishments. Kenny Halcomb left the world a much better place and will be fondly remembered by his loving family and many friends.\n\nSurvivors include his loving wife, Donna (Arens) Halcomb, to whom he was united in marriage June 19, 1999; children, LaDonna (Harvey) McCann, Kenny Halcomb, Jr., Marquette Comer, Annette (Mike) Smithey, and Amber (Scott) Gilcrest; stepchildren, Cindy Tucker, Brian (Heather) Dewbrew, and Tonya Sheets; 21 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren.\n\nKenny’s Life Celebration® Visitation and Memorial Service will be held at Carlisle – Branson Funeral Service & Crematory, 39 East High Street, Mooresville. Visitation will be Friday, December 22, 2023, 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., followed by the memorial service at 2 p.m. Please consider making a memorial contribution to the family to help offset funeral expenses.
