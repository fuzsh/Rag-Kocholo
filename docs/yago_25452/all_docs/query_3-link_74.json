        "text": "Nick Harlan was hired at the University of Central Arkansas as the associate head coach and pitching coach in August 2013, and was then named head coach in May 2021 after the retirement of Allen Gum.\n\nHarlan joined the Bears after nine seasons as the head coach at York College in York, Nebraska. One year under Harlan’s leadership, UCA pitchers put together a great effort and notched a 3.58 ERA while helping the Bears earn a spot in the Southland Tournament Championship Game.\n\nDuring his time at UCA’s pitching coach, the Bears had six pitchers taken in the Major League Baseball Draft, including most recently, left hander Noah Cameron in 2021 by the Kansas City Royals. The others were Jeffery Enloe in 2013, Ty Tice in 2017, Tyler Gray in 2017 and 2018, Cody Davenport in 2019 and Gavin Stone in 2020.\n\nHarlan believes baseball is a great platform to teach disciplines that will build character and encourage young men to live with purpose. He believes that creating a culture of selflessness and accountability for consistent effort and competitiveness from his pitching staff will lead to success on the field and in life. “If we focus on the process of being the best men, teammates, and pitchers every day, we will make a greater impact on the people around us and give our team a chance for success.” Harlan said.\n\nHarlan was hired in 2004 as the head coach at York College. During Harlan’s tenure (325-170 record) the Panthers won 5 conference championships, and earned 5 regional berths. During that time the Panthers were ranked as high as 8th in the country and in the top 25 for four consecutive years. In 2013, the Panthers earned a #1 seed in the Jolliet, Ill regional, winning the regional and advancing to the NAIA World Series. York won a school-record 45 games in 2010.\n\nHarlan was a two time MCAC Coach of the Year and in 2013 was named the York College Young Alumnus of the Year. In 2013 the NAIA awarded York College baseball with the Hank Burbridge Champions of Character award. The award is given to one team in the nation who exemplifies the 5 core values of the NAIA: Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Sportsmanship, and Servant Leadership.\n\nIn 2003 Harlan was given the opportunity to go back to his alma mater as an assistant coach for one year under head coach Jerry Laird. Harlan began his coaching career in 2002 as an assistant coach under head coach Jedd Soto at Feather River Community College in Quincy, CA where he helped lead the Golden Eagles to their first California Final Four appearance and were awarded the California Pepsi Team Scholar Award for a cumulative team grade point average of 3.4. During this time he also served as an Associate Scout for the Philadelphia Phillies under Scott Ramsey.\n\nHarlan was born in Oroville, California where he graduated from Oroville High School. He earned his Bachelor’s Degree from York College.\n\nHarlan married the former Lindsay Spivey, a UCA alum, on July 26, 2014 in Little Rock, AR. Nick and Lindsay share a home with their daughter Hazel Grace, son Walker Spivey and their dog Jesse."
