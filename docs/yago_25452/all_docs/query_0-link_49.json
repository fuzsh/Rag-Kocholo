        "meta_description": "British Real Photograph postcard, no. 84. Sent by mail in 1929.\n\t\n\t<b>Marie Prevost</b> (1898-1937) was an American silent screen actress.\n\t\n\tBorn in Ontario, Canada, as Mary Bickford Dunn, Prevost was still a child when the family moved to the US. First, the Dunn family settled in Denver, Colorado, then in Los Angeles. Mary was hired as a secretary but in the meantime, she sought work in the cinema. Mack Sennett, also of Canadian origin, entrusted her with the role of an exotic &quot;French girl&quot; and inserted her into his Bathing Beauties, with the stage name of Marie Prevost. In 1919, Marie was secretly married to Sonny Gerke, a young man from high society, but the marriage failed after only six months because Gerke did not have the courage to tell his mother that he had married an actress. Fearful of the bad publicity resulting from a divorce, Marie remained married until 1923, always keeping everyone unaware of her marriage. One of Prevost's first successful films was Love, Honor, and Behave (Richard Jones, Erle Kenton, 1920), alongside another Sennett protégé, George O'Hara. A series of small roles followed in which she played the part of the young, innocent sexy girl. In 1921, Marie signed a contract with Universal after getting the attention of Irving Thalberg. Thalberg decided to make her a star and organized a great advertising hype for her. He announced that Marie would star in two films, The Moonlight Follies (King Baggot, 1921) and Kissed (King Baggot, 1922), and sent her to Coney Island. There the actress publicly burned her bathing suit, signifying the end of her &quot;bathing&quot; days.\n\t\n\tAt Universal, Marie Prevost only got light comedy roles. When the contract expired, Jack Warner had her signed for Warner Bros, recognizing $ 1,500 a week. Alongside actor Kenneth Harlan as Tony, Marie played Gloria in The Beautiful and the Damned (Sidney Franklin, 1922), based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's bestseller on two idle spendthrifts who do not know how to cope with money running out. To publicize the film, the production company announced that the actors would get married during filming on the set. The advertising launch worked and the studios were flooded with letters and gifts for the spouses. But when in the Los Angeles Mirror the story of Prevost's earlier secret marriage appeared: &quot;Marie Prevost will become bigamist if she marries Harlan&quot;, Warner immediately took charge of the annulment of that marriage, so Harlan and Marie could marry. Despite the bad publicity, The Beautiful and Damned was successful. By consequence, Ernst Lubitsch wanted Marie as a co-host for his film The Marriage Circle (1924), with Adolphe Menjou, Florence Vidor, and Monte Blue. Lubitsch said that Prevost was one of the few actresses in Hollywood who knew how to underplay comedy to achieve the maximum effect. At Warner's in the mid-1920s, Prevost would star in comedies and dramas with Harrison Ford [the silent actor], Monte Blue, Matt Moore, Douglas Fairbanks jr., and Harlan.  \n\t\n\tIn 1926, Warner decided not to prolong the contracts of Harlan and Marie Prevost. The Canadian actress also lost her mother - who, in a car with actress Vera Steadman and producer Al Christie - was killed in an accident in Florida. Devastated by her mother's death and losing her work, Marie's marriage deteriorated, she began to drink and soon slipped into alcoholism. In 1927, she separated from her second husband, and despite a reconciliation in between, she divorced him altogether in 1929. To overcome the crisis, Prevost threw herself completely at work. After seeing her in The Beautiful and Damned, in 1928 Howard Hughes wanted her to star in The Racket. The two had a brief relationship but Hughes soon left her and Marie fell into a deepening depression. The Racket would be her last feature film.  She began to gain weight and could no longer control either food or alcohol. In 1934 her financial situation became dramatic. To find work again, he faced drastic diets that further weakened her. In 1937, Marie Prevost died of a heart attack due to malnutrition and acute alcoholism. Her body was found only two days later, due to the continuous and insistent barking of her dachshund dog. A bellhop came into the house and found her lying face down on the bed, legs marked by the teeth of her dog, which had tried to wake her by biting her. The funeral at the Memorial Cemetery in Hollywood was paid by Joan Crawford: in addition to Crawford, Clark Gable, Wallace Beery and Barbara Stanwyck participated. Her poor case prompted the Hollywood community to create in the early 1940s the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital to provide medical care for employees of the television and motion picture industry.\n\t\n\tSources: Wikipedia (Italian and English) and IMDb.  \n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
