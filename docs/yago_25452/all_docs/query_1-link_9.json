        "text": "American actor (1895–1967)\n\nKenneth Daniel Harlan (July 26, 1895 – March 6, 1967)[1] was a popular American actor during the silent film era, playing mostly romantic leads or adventurer roles. His career extended into the sound film era, but during that span he rarely commanded leading-man roles, and became mostly a supporting or character actor.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHarlan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of George W. Harlan and actress Rita W. Harlan (born Sarah Wolff).[2][3][4] He was a graduate of Saint Francis High School in Brooklyn, New York City, and Fordham University in the Bronx.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAt age seven, Harlan began acting on stage and working in vaudeville. He spent much of 1916 touring with a company of dancers that headlined future Ziegfeld performer Evan-Burrows Fontaine.[6] His career spanned 25 years and included 200 features and serials, Harlan first entered the motion picture world in 1916 as the leading man under D.W. Griffith. Harlan later played with Constance Talmadge, Lois Weber, Mary Pickford, Katherine MacDonald, Anna May Wong, and others. Harlan was skilled at drama and comedy, and made several westerns. Harlan had the leading role in two film serials, Finger Prints (1931) and Danger Island (1931).[1]\n\nHe made a smooth transition to talkies, even singing in a few films, but his film roles remained minor throughout his later career. Harlan worked until the 1940s and retired in 1963.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nHarlan was married nine times, including a marriage to silent screen star Marie Prevost.[7] His seventh wife was actress-singer Helene Stanton, whom he married in 1949 and divorced four years later.[8]\n\nHarlan, who was a nephew of actor and comedian Otis Harlan, died of an acute aneurysm in 1967 in Sacramento, California.[9] He was 71.\n\nComplete filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nShort films\n\nFoiled Again (1932, Short) - The Hero\n\nMovie Maniacs (1936, Short) - Leading Man\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
