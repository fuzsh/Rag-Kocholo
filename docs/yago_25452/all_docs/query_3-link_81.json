He was born on February 23, 1931 in McMillin, Wash., the son of Edward G. and Nora Bell (Wilkinson) Harris. His family moved from McMillin to Brinnon, Wash, about 1 940 where they purchased the Dickerson property in Dose Meadows which later became Dosewallips State Park.

He was a member of the Quilcene Historical Society, charter member of the Quilcene Lions Club, and a volunteer for the Quilcene Fire Dept. He touched lives everywhere he went with his helpful spirit, quick wit, and his tall tales.\n\nHe is survived by his three children: Melvin H. Harris of Olympia, Cheryl A. Piliaris of Olympia, and Pamela J. Mack of Quilcene. Kenny had seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n\nKenny was preceded in death by his parents; wife Darlene; two brothers Edward P. and Daryl; nephew Donald W. Harris and niece Donna M. Harris.\n\nA Celebration of Life service will be held at noon, Saturday, May 7, 201 6 at the Masonic Lodge, 170 Herbert St., Quilcene, Wash., with a potluck to follow."
