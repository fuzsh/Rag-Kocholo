        "text": "Marie Prevost was a silent movie actress, having been discovered by Mack Sennett, founder of Keystone Studios in the 1910s. She began her career as an uncredited extra in 1915 and was featured in several short films before moving onto full-length features. She signed a contract with Warner Brothers in 1922 and it was there she experienced her greatest popularity. She was a favorite actress of Ernst Lubitsch, and starred in three of his films: The Marriage Circle, Three Women, and Kiss Me Again.\n\nUnfortunately, her career took a turn for the worst in the late 1920s. She was let go from Warner Brothers in 1926, her mother died the same year, and her marriage to Kenneth Harlan ended a year later. She suffered from severe depression and self-medicated with alcohol. Marie kept on acting, but was relegated to smaller, insignificant parts. In addition to her other troubles, she also suffered from an eating disorder, and the weight she gained made it harder and harder for her to secure roles. Without intervention, her problems spiraled out of control and she died of acute alcoholism on 21 January 1937 with only $300 to her name. After her death, the movie community came together to found what eventually became known as the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital."
