They were active in Harlan Family activities prior to the 1987 Celebration 300.\n\nWhile living in Virginia, they made several trips to New Castle to meet with other family members in planning the Delaware family reunion and were responsible for the first reprinting of Alpheus Harlanï¿½s genealogy book as well as the program for the 1987 reunion. As a result of that gathering, Tom was selected to serve as President of the Family for the next 10 years. In addition to publishing The Harlan Record until 1999, Tom and Marylee went on two Harlan family tours to England and were the registrars at Celebration 310 in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. The couple has been involved with the Harlan Family web site and will continue this service.\n\nBoth Tom and Marylee are native Northwesterners from the state of Washingtonï¿½Tom is from Vancouver and Marylee is from Spokane. Tom had a 30-year-career as Public Affairs Officer for the U.S. Forest Service and held positions on the Siuslaw National Forest in Corvallis, OR; and in regional offices in Portland, San Francisco and Missoula. He ended his career in the National Office in Washington, D.C. Maryleeï¿½s career was a personnel specialist for various federal agencies in the same locations where Tom worked.\n\nAfter retiring in 1989, they settled on Harstine Island, WA, in lower Puget Sound where they live surrounded by acres of clams. They live in a waterfront development and have a view of Mt. Rainier, Case Inlet, lots of wildlife including deer, raccoons, birds, foxes and squirrels. They have both been active in community affairs and currently, Marylee is president of the homeownersï¿½ association which includes 530 properties and facilities including a marina, club house, tennis courts, swimming pool, 3 miles of beach and picnic facilities, private roads and water treatment.\n\nTomï¿½s major activity in retirement has been learning to play the bagpipes which includes weekly practices, a lot of parades, weddings, funerals and other events. His Scottish heritage has become equally important as his English/Irish Harlan roots. He has his own kilt and can claim connections to Wallace and Henderson clans.\n\nThe couple enjoys their three grandsons who are able to spend time with their grandparents in the summer, and they enjoy their motor home and sailboat activities.\n\nThe Harlan Family regretfullyï¿½but with gratitudeï¿½accepts the resignation of Tom and Marylee Harlan as editors and publishers of The Harlan Record and thanks them for twelve years of service to the Harlan Family!\n\nHARLAN FAMILY IN AMERICA OFFICERS\n\nOFFICERS President: Robert R.

It omits dates used for Celebration 300 and\n\nCelebration 310 (except the family arrival date of 1687) which make it a\n\ngeneral and ongoing logo. And it adds the words ï¿½A Family of Friends...ï¿½\n\nwhich has triple meaning: our Society of Friends (Quaker) origins, the sense\n\nof comradeship among Harlans both here and abroad and, of course, Becky\n\nGaskill's beautiful and winsome family song of that name.\n\nOur secretary, ï¿½artist-in-residenceï¿½ and editor pro tem, Ruth Harlan\n\nLamb, provided the final designï¿½as she did with the 1997 reunion version.\n\nï¿½DH\n\nHarlan's Stitchery by Sue\n\nCheck out the new items with the \"Family of Friends\" logo\n\nItems are listed on the store page.

But Iï¿½m still not quite sure how it happened. I was sort of standing around, not paying much attention and what do you know, the Board said, ï¿½Youï¿½re it.ï¿½\n\nMy feet arenï¿½t particularly dainty, for sure. But Iï¿½m having anxiety attacks concerning my ability to fill the shoes of my two predecessors. Dan, of course, was the father of our reborn Family Association. There simply would not have been a Harlan Family organization again if he had not been inspired to create the idea back in the early 1980s and push through Celebration 300 in 1987.\n\nTom then became our president for the better part of a decade. He and Marylee, as editors of our Record, were extraordinarily important in maintaining the growing vitality of what Iï¿½m sure is now one of Americaï¿½s leading family heritage societies.\n\nWeï¿½re really fortunate, we Harlans. When I tell others about The Harlan Family in America, our great national reunions, our regional get-togethers, our web site and so on, their reaction is almost always, ï¿½I sure wish our family had something like that.ï¿½\n\nThe Harlan ï¿½statement of purposeï¿½ on this page has been put together by our Board. I wonder how many families have set out such a philosophy as we have. That really says it all, doesnï¿½t it? And although I know the shoes Iï¿½ve inherited are much too roomy, I sure will do my best to help our Board carry out our Family objectives.\n\nFraternally, Robert R. Harlan\n\nTHE MISSION of THE HARLAN FAMILY IN AMERICA, 1998\n\nOur family heritage organization exists for two comprehensive reasons. One is philosophical. The other is operational.\n\nI. PHILOSOPHY\n\nThroughout human history, the single most powerful force for our welfare, protection and happiness has been, simply, the Family.\n\nThe influence of the human family has been unfortunately illustrated by the cascading social and human behavior problems of our 20th Century. Sadly, these problems are directly proportional to the massive increase in the number of dysfunctional American families.\n\nTherefore an important purpose of the Harlan Family in America is to project and communicate, by our example, the importance and benefits of the human family to the human experience. Our goal is to define the character, values, heritage and traditions of the generations of families in America bearing the names of Harlan, Harland, Harlin and Harlen.\n\nWe will accomplish this by continuing to develop the bonds of our own extended Harlan Family throughout America and wherever Harlans may be living in other countries. In so doing, we will demonstrate the pride, the sense of belonging, and the security that flows from being, simply, a member of the family that cares about its own.\n\nII. SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES\n\nAs our family heritage organization continues to mature, our specific ï¿½operationalï¿½ objectives will of course be subject to change. At this time in our development, the following are the essential areas on which we will focus:\n\nï¿½ Continue to identify new Harlan Family members, descendants of George, Michael and Thomas, and those Harlans whose surnames have changed with marriage. Our task is to let them know of our Harlan Family Organization that is available to them, and to encourage them to join;\n\nï¿½ Continue to build strength and interest among our members by frequently communicating information about the Family, its current activities and plans, its history and heritage with all available means: local, national and regional reunions; newsletters and other direct mail; web site, etc., and encourage communication among individual family members;\n\nï¿½ Continue to develop genealogical resources and knowledge to identify our history and heritage both in America and in Britain, and to discover and preserveï¿½via historians and genealogistsï¿½ history, documents, memorabilia and records;\n\nï¿½ Identify and preserve Harlan historical sites which have influenced our Family, in our country and abroad, such as the Harlanï¿½Lincoln Home, the Delaware Landing Site, the Brandywine Area, and Harlan sites in England and Ireland, and promote family gatherings and travel to these sites;\n\nï¿½ Maintain a strong and efficient organization with an adequate and sound financial base and a repository for Family information, and have regular meetings and communication among Board Members and all other Harlans involved;\n\nï¿½ Create and foster all other activities that will enable members of the Harlan Family to be good, responsible and productive citizens of this land.\n\nAfter a protest by 250 citizens against the selling of Whitehall Farmï¿½once owned by Aaron Harlan (#2256)ï¿½to developers, the following story was submitted by the author. Later it was reported that the developers were not successful in their bid to purchase.\n\nA Brief Moment in History by Cynthia Ressler\n\ndescended from George #180 and Sarah #674\n\nAt the end of a narrow dirt lane, once lined with majestic walnut trees, stands a grand old lady who is an historic moment. The cool, dank soil cradling her foundation also cradled the footsteps of Indian moccasins. The soil surrounding her foundation was land of the disputed Louisiana Territory, claimed by the monarchs of Europe at one time or another. Today this grand dame remains serene in the midst of 940 acres, half the size of her former self.\n\nThe town of Yellow Springs (OH) sprang up when people seeking cures for poor health went there to bathe in the area mineral waters. In 1808, a patriarch of Cincinnati obtained a large parcel of land by land grant just north of Yellow Springs and sent his ailing son there to recuperate from dissipations. There the son fell in love with and married his nurse, a Yellow Springs girl. At the time of his death, the son willed the land to his wife. The will was contested by his family in Cincinnati, and the case was fought in court for nine years by a Quaker lawyer named Aaron Harlan (#2256).\n\nAaron, a native of Warren County, Ohio, was born in 1802, the year before Ohio became a state. Friend Harlan was practicing law in the small town of Xenia just down the road from Yellow Springs. His first wife had died, and he married Amanda Sroufe Baum, the widow of the young man from Cincinnati, in 1840. Taking his three motherless children, Aaron moved to Yellow Springs to make his home with the new Mrs. Harlan on her land. Five children were born to their marriage while living on Whitehall Farm.\n\nTwo years later Aaron, now 40, began construction of the white pillared, brick house that he designed. It contained twelve\n\n20 x 20 ft. rooms, and his efforts were majestic. So grand were his plans that he had to sell a large portion of the original 1,800-acre farm for working capital to build the house. Over the years barns, stables, kennels, tenant houses and a bath house were clustered around Whitehall.\n\nInside, one wall in the drawing room contains two fireplaces of white marble. Flemish tapestry covers another wall. A gracefully curved walnut staircase spirals to the second floor. Aaron installed stained glass windows on the upper curve of the staircase. The walls were two feet thick and were constructed of brick kilned on the Whitehall land. A gray marble fireplace dominates one end of the dining room, opposite a door to the east side formal garden. In a small sitting room at the west side of the house, book shelves extend from floor to ceiling on one wall. The wood used in the building came from groves on the farm.\n\nCattle raising was at one time the principal interest of the farm. Jersey cattle and white-faced Herefords roamed the fields. Baptan Pearl, the sire from which 80% of the shorthorn herd bulls in the United States today trace their pedigree, grazed on the land of Whitehall, making the farm renowned in stock circles.\n\nThe great house took a leading part in political happenings of the territory, which were indeed political happenings of the entire nation. Legend says that Whitehall is the scene of the birth of the present Republican party. Friend Aaron Harlan was a believer that Thomas Jefferson influenced the writing and passage of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 which abolished slavery from the territories lying north of the Ohio River. As a Quaker, he considered himself a representative of the principles of the Northwest Ordinance.\n\nAaron was a member of the House of Representatives of Ohio in the Thirty-first and the Forty-fourth General Assemblies, and he was a member of the House of Representatives in Congress from 1852 to 1859. Selling the farm in 1864, he and his family moved to California where he died four years later, and his wife Amanda followed him in death just a brief month later.\n\nWhitehall is a farm that stands tall in the glory of its past.\n\nDo You Descend from GEORGE #45?\n\nEd and Darlene Norman have been gathering data on the Descendants of George Harlan, #45, p. 40, of Alpheus Harlan's History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family since the 1987 Harlan reunion. At the 1997 reunion they committed to continuing their project. They generated separate chapters for the descendants of each of the siblings of George and Ann Hurst Harlan's family into an interim spiral bound book that was on display in Mt. Pleasant and at the 1998 Harlan Homecoming in West Virginia.\n\nThrough the Normansï¿½ efforts and the contributions of several descendants, they have recorded 2,581 persons and 890 marriages. All descendants of this #45 George Harlan are encouraged to contribute their data for inclusion in updating this line of the family!

Harlan of Freeport, IL, who died November 26, 1998, and his younger brother, Charles H. Harlan of Plymouth, MN, who died May 8, 1999, after a long illness. Their Harlan ancestors are George, James, John, John, Aaron, Jacob, Elzephus and Robert.\n\nRobert (b. 12-27-17) and his wife, Lois, attended Celebrations 300 and 310 and had ï¿½the experience of that special never-to-be-forgotten trip to England and Northern Ireland in 1994, visiting places where Harlan ancestors had once walked. Best of all was the Harlan companionship they found at these gatherings,ï¿½ Lois wrote.\n\nBob served 30 years in the U.S. Foreign Service at diplomatic and consulate posts abroad and in the State Department at home. During his 19 years of retirement he served 12 of them on the board of the local college and was active in many community endeavors through raising money and planning projects. In 1992 he received a Public Service Citation from the University of Chicago Alumni Association, and in his last years he spent hours each week volunteering in the public schools, listening to second graders read. Bob received his bachelorï¿½s and doctor of jurisprudence degrees from the University of Chicago.\n\nCharles (b. 9-22-22) received bachelorï¿½s and masterï¿½s degrees from Western Reserve and for a time, he pursued a career in biological research. He later changed to business and worked for Minneapolis Honeywell until his retirement in 1986. He was an organist and composer.\n\nThe two brothers left children, grandchildren andï¿½in the case of Bobï¿½great-grandchildren to carry on the Harlan tradition.\n\nwww.harlanfamily.org\n\nOctober marks the start of the third year for the Harlan Family's Web Site. During the past two years we have enjoyed over 12,000 hits (visitations) and by early next year, we should be receiving 30 hits every day. At that rate, we anticipate over 10,000 for the year 2,000.\n\nYour Harlan Family Site offers an excellent means for you to obtain fast communications with other members of the family through the ï¿½Message Centerï¿½ and ï¿½E-mail and Web Site Addressesï¿½. Valuable information is also available about the familyï¿½s overall history and the organization. You can also search for personal family information.\n\nUse the site to its fullest extent and make sure that others in your family are aware that itï¿½s available.

HARLAN\n\nFORMED FIRST UTILITY COMPANIES IN NORTHWEST\n\nKenneth George Harlan, son of Elwood Harlan #8506, was born in 1891 in Leadville, Colorado. He became an electrical engineer and formed a consulting business called Carey & Harlan which focused on the mining trade. His wife was Ruth Ledgerwood, a graduate of Cheney Normal College (near Spokane) who was teaching in Kettle Falls, Washington, when they met. Kennethï¿½s job took the couple to towns in Washington and Idaho where their sons, Kenneth George, Jr. and Robert Lee were born.\n\nKenneth was incredibly busy originating electrical systems in many rural cities at the time electricity was coming into wide use. He formed public utility districts including one in Portland. In 1927 Kenneth was appointed by President Hoover to organize what later became the Bonneville Power Administration. He and Ruth were invited to attend a Hoover White House reception and later they dined with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt in Hyde Park in the early 1930s. FDR appointed Kenneth as consulting engineer for the Grand Coulee Dam among other duties of appraising private power companies and giving testimony to the legislature on hydroelectric power rate analyses, about which he was an expert.\n\nKenneth once ran on the Republican ticket for Senator from Oregon but was defeated. He later became very involved in Democratic politics but eventually became disillusioned. He died of cancer in his forties.\n\nSons Kenneth, Jr. and Robert attended Hill Military School and Beale Military School and graduated from both Lakeside School in Seattle and the University of Washington. Kenneth, Jr. became an electrical engineer for Lockheed in Los Angeles, and Robert became an attorney, later starting his own lumber company, Pacific Wood Products which became Harlan Pacific.\n\nKenneth, Jr. died in the late 1970s, but Robert is still working and frequently travels. Recently he has been to Spain, Portugal and Morocco. He has homes in Rancho Mirage, Bellevue, WA, and a vacation place on Puget Sound. Robert and one of his six children, Kirk, attended the 1987 Harlan Reunion in Delaware, and he takes great pride in his Harlan ancestry.\n\nGENEALOGY SEARCH HAS SURPRISE\n\nLast year Phillip Reynolds, husband of Sara Jo Reynolds, heard from an unknown third cousin, Jeffrey Palmer. While viewing his familyï¿½s web site, Sara Jo realized that her husbandï¿½s cousin and she were related on his motherï¿½s line and that they were half-7th cousins, three times removed on their Hollingsworth side (some of whom married Harlans). It seems that Jeff\n\ndescends from Valentine Hollingsworth, Sr. and first wife, Ann Ree. Sara Jo descends from Valentine and his second wife, Ann Calvert.\n\nSara Jo, whose mother was a Harlan, is continually discovering new relatives through genealogy searches. She makes good use of the vertical files found in most libraries. These files contain family news articles, stories, charts, pension papers, and whatever people submit. She recommends leaving family information in areas where the family lived. In vertical files she often\n\nstores her ancestor chart, generation chart and a page of her family with her name and address. She has been contacted and has discovered new relatives as well as interesting stories of ancestors.\n\nITï¿½S CONTRIBUTION TIME AGAIN\n\nUnlike most other organizations, it is a proud tradition of our Harlan Family Association that no dues are required to be a member. All descendants of George, Michael and Thomas are urged to join. There is no barrier to membership for Harlans who might find dues a burden.\n\nThis means the costs of maintaining our Association must be met largely by contributions from interested Harlans (plus modest profits from sales of our Family History Green Volumes).\n\nNaturally, despite careful financial management, there are inescapable costsï¿½printing and mailing our ï¿½newspaperï¿½, The Harlan Record, and reprinting the Harlan history books.\n\nOne such demand is the next great Harlan Family national reunion, tentatively planned for 2002. As we found with the 1997 Reunion, up-front costs are substantial. Although committee members paid their own expenses to attend the several meetings (travel, rooms, meals), there were large advance extra expenses including printing and mailing, advance deposits, etc.\n\nNow weï¿½re beginning the 2002 preparations (yes, it does take that long!!). Our Association needs your contributions to build our sound financial base. So please give some serious thought to your next donations to the Association. Send in the form with as generous a contribution as you can. Those of us who do so feel weï¿½ve been repaid many times over for supporting a\n\ntruly fine purposeï¿½building and maintaining one of Americaï¿½s leading family heritage societies.
