Here’s how manure in the garden may actually destroy your soil and plants for a long time.\n\nThis page may contain affiliate links. Please read my disclosure for more info.\n\nThe following article was written by David the Good of The Survival Gardener.\n\nDavid and I first connected after he wrote an honest and thorough review of my book, ‘The Suburban Micro-Farm’, for Mother Earth News. David is an expert at home-scale food production and I was thrilled that he enjoyed it.\n\nThe truth is, herbicide-laced manure is a widespread problem that can completely destroy a garden, and David was one of the first to sound the alarm.\n\nI’m grateful he’s sharing this information with us so that we may prevent this devastating and costly misfortune from occurring in our own gardens. — Amy\n\nIn this article:\n\nWhat is the problem with manure in the garden?\n\nWhat happened when David added manure to his garden\n\nIdentifying the persistent herbicide that contaminates manure and gardens for years\n\nWhy herbicide-laced manure in the garden is a serious problem\n\n4 ways to keep your garden safe from persistent herbicides\n\nHow to ensure you get herbicide-free manure, hay, straw, compost, and soil\n\n5 FAQs about herbicide-laced manure\n\nThis Manure Will Destroy Your Garden!\n\nManure is rich in nitrogen, organic matter and a variety of minerals, adding nutrition and tilth to the soil and ensuring rich harvests of green and happy vegetables. It’s generally considered to be one of the best amendments you can add to your garden.\n\nAt least it used to be.\n\nNow adding manure to your garden is playing Russian roulette with your plants. There’s a very good chance that it will completely destroy your beds and cause your plants to grow into twisted parodies of their proper growth pattern before dying ugly and unproductive deaths.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nA Load of Manure is a Gardener’s Paradise…Naturally\n\nSome time back I did a very normal thing for an organic gardener: I bought a trailer of manure from a local dairy farm and had it dropped in my front yard.\n\nI then proceeded to spread it across multiple beds, add it around the trees in my front yard food forest, and turn it into the ground along the front fence line where I was planting dozens of newly purchased thornless blackberries.\n\nRead more about creating food forests.\n\nA few weeks later, I planted my gardens – and everything started going very, very wrong. My transplanted tomatoes and eggplants started to twist up. They were still green, but their leaves were thick and curled and the amount of new growth was much smaller than it should have been.\n\nSomething was very wrong.\n\nMy thought upon seeing the weird growth in my tomatoes and eggplants was that I was dealing with a virus. They were both Solanaceae family – maybe it was some weird and horrible disease I’d never seen before?\n\nThen some of the edges of the blackberry leaves started twisting and turning brown. A virus wouldn’t jump families – blackberries are Rosaceae! I had to look elsewhere.\n\nI noticed the blackberry leaves were deep green, despite their strange growth. Perhaps there was too much nitrogen in the manure?\n\nThe manure had been composted for over six months, according to the farmer. And it certainly didn’t look or smell fresh. It was earthy and crumbly, well-aged stuff. It looked just like something you’d want to add to your garden.\n\nThen the mulberry tree started looking weird. And the pecan trees and the olive exhibited the same symptoms.\n\nWould you like to grow more food with less effort? Check out my mini guide, The Permaculture Inspired Vegetable Garden.\n\nThat Herbicide is Poison\n\nFrom my reading, it wasn’t too much nitrogen. The symptoms were too strange. And it wasn’t a virus.\n\nThe only thing in common between all these sick plants was one big load of manure.\n\nI called the local master gardeners and shared the symptoms and they had nothing helpful to suggest, so I started searching on my own, looking up phrases like “twisting leaves manure,” until I came across an article about a community garden disaster on the left coast.\n\nThey had purchased a load of manure compost, then lost many of their plants because of a recently released herbicide designed for hay growers and cattle farmers.\n\nAminopyralid.\n\nI had met my nemesis.\n\nI called the farmer who had sold me the manure and asked him if he’d sprayed anything on his hay fields. He told me he had tried a new product recommended by the University of Florida for the elimination of spiny pigweed, an obnoxious recurring weed in his pastures. “It worked really well,” he told me.\n\nI shared that all my plants were dying and asked if he could find out what he’d sprayed. I was pretty sure I knew already, but when he sent me a picture of the label, I knew for sure.\n\nIt was Grazon, an aminopyralid-based toxin from Dow AgroSciences.\n\nAminopyralid isn’t the only persistent herbicide, however. Clopyralid, picloram, aminoclopyrachlor, and hexazinone are other persistent herbicides that often contaminate manures, straw, hay, compost, and gardens. These herbicides are sold under many brand names, so it’s important to look at the label of a product to determine if it includes one of these chemicals.\n\nToxic Manure in the Garden is No Joke\n\nThe farmer was quite upset by my report. He had sprayed his pasture the previous summer. That was about nine months before I called him, and he was told Grazon was safe for animals to consume.\n\nArmed with my new research, I shared that the toxin could continue killing plants for years, even after being eaten by animals, then excreted, then composted for months.\n\nHe refunded the $60 I’d spent for the manure and apologized, telling me he wouldn’t spray again and that he had a lot of people that bought his manure.\n\nI didn’t blame him for the mistake and I didn’t ask for his help replacing the thousand dollars or so of destroyed produce and perennials. We all make mistakes and he seemed like a decent guy.\n\nI reserved my blame instead for the University of Florida, Dow AgroSciences and the government that lets these poisons into our gardens.\n\nBy the time I knew what was going on, I had lost the first half of the growing season. Most of my garden beds were loaded with this manure – and my poor blackberries were twisted and dying, along with multiple fruit trees.\n\nPerson after person has written me to share tales of wrecked gardens. Some people lost beds because of contaminated hay they used in their compost. Others lost beds due to manure. Still others purchased compost or garden soil and had it kill their plants.\n\nAminopyralids and other persistent herbicides are all over the place now and it’s a minefield for gardeners.\n\nNew gardeners are really in a bad place now, as they often don’t know what to expect from their plants. When Aminopyralid symptoms strike, they just assume they made a mistake, not that their beds were poisoned.\n\nHere’s how to keep your gardens safe.\n\n1. Don’t purchase compost.\n\nMany facilities still don’t have proper safeguards in place to keep their product uncontaminated.\n\nAs a matter of fact, herbicides can contaminate commercially made soils that are approved for Organic agriculture! Learn 5 essential questions to ask a producer before buying compost soil for your garden.\n\n2. Don’t use manure from grazing animals.\n\nThat neighbor offering you well-rotted horse manure? A decade ago I would have said, “Great!” Now I would say, “Absolutely not!”.\n\nDespite it being a “free” garden amendment, horse manure tends to be the most concentrated source of contamination.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nImagine that a horse pasture is sprayed with Aminopyralids to rid it of broadleaf weeds. The hay eaten by the horses is also sprayed, as well as the straw used for bedding.\n\nThat’s three sources of contamination. What’s more, the herbicide becomes concentrated in the manure. So it’s easy to see how horse manure is one of the worst offenders.\n\nBut don’t be tempted to think that because you only have one source of herbicide, say, contaminated grass clippings from a neighbor or conventional straw for mulch, that your compost soil is safer. It’s hard to predict herbicide concentration.\n\nThough your neighbor might not spray his fields, he likely buys hay – and a lot of hayfields are now sprayed. It happens again and again and again. I have heard reports that even store-bought bagged manure is killing gardens.\n\nJust say no to manure in the garden from grazing animals.\n\nUnfortunately, manure from non-grazing animals such as chickens or rabbits is not much safer, simply because persistent herbicides are now prevalent in straw and hay—which are often used as bedding—as well as in animal feed. Remember that persistent herbicides can persist through the animals’ digestive systems to be present (and more concentrated) in their manure.\n\nAlfalfa hay and pellets were, at one time, considered safe alternatives to regular hay, as it was not typically sprayed with persistent herbicides. However, that appears to not be the case any longer.\n\n3. Avoid hay and straw in your compost or as mulch.\n\nA friend lost a chunk of her food forest plants after picking up a load of well-rotted hay and spreading it around. Members of the grass family may be sprayed with Aminopyralid-containing pesticides. Avoid.\n\nIf you make your own compost, read more about keeping persistent herbicides out of your compost bin, even if you garden organically and don’t spray.\n\n4. Make your own compost.\n\nLearn to compost everything. Fall leaves, shredded paper, fish guts, eggshells, lasagna – whatever. The more organic material you can add to your compost pile and eventually to your gardens, the less you need to buy to amend your gardens.\n\nMake a worm bin for composting food scraps.\n\nI compost all kitchen scraps, including meat. Gather lots of leaves or grass clippings from your (unsprayed!) yard and throw them over stuff that might stink. You can also cover your bin to keep out vermin. Nature will do the rest. It’s just a matter of time, not perfection.\n\nThis isn’t an easy time to be a gardener. The world is toxic and there are plenty of pitfalls, including the use of manure as an amendment.\n\nI’m not exaggerating when I say this is a widespread problem. It’s no longer a good idea to add manure to your garden. If you do, you’re running a big risk and can destroy your plants because someone sprayed toxins on a field somewhere far from your garden.\n\nIt’s not easy to find good alternatives, but it needs to be done. Watch your back and start making your own compost. It may save you some serious heartache.\n\nGet David’s tips for:\n\ntesting for Grazon\n\nfixing Grazon contamination\n\nA Note from Amy\n\nIt’s important to support your local farmers who commit to doing honest and good work. If you have a farmer who has been supplying you with material such as manure, hay, straw, or compost, then I encourage you to start a conversation about herbicide contamination.\n\nLearn how to source herbicide-free compost, then ask questions and learn more about their process. If they have control over all of the materials in the supply chain and emphatically say they do not spray, then they deserve to have your business.\n\nIf the farmer outsources any of those materials (hay, straw, or animal feed?), it’s more difficult to know for sure. Ask for the contact info of their supplier. Ask more hard questions. Go with your gut. Don’t assume that all farmers are dishonest, because that is certainly not the case, but obviously you want to be cautious.\n\nFarmers are busy. When their extension office tells them a widely used (herbicide) product is safe, they may go with it, having no idea of its wrath.\n\n5 FAQs About Herbicide-Laced Manure\n\n#1: What are the symptoms of herbicide contamination?\n\nSymptoms can include everything from twisted and curled leaves to stunted growth to unexplained death in plants.\n\n#2: How does herbicide contamination occur in manure?\n\nHerbicides like aminopyralid are sprayed on pastures or hay fields. Animals eat the treated plants, and the herbicide passes through their digestive systems into their manure.\n\n#3: Can composting eliminate the herbicide from contaminated manure?\n\nNo, these herbicides can persist for years, even after being composted for months.\n\n#4: Is it safe to use manure from non-grazing animals?\n\nNo, because persistent herbicides are now prevalent in straw and hay—which are often used as bedding—as well as in animal feed.\n\n#5: What can I use instead of manure?\n\nLearn to make your own compost using materials like fall leaves, shredded paper, kitchen scraps, and yard waste from unsprayed areas.\n\nHave you suffered problems due to herbicide-laced manure in the garden? What changes will you make to your gardening routine to avoid it?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDavid The Good is the author of multiple gardening books including Grow or Die: The Good Guide to Survival Gardening, Compost Everything: The Good Guide to Extreme Composting, and Create Your Own Florida Food Forest: Florida Gardening Nature’s Way.\n\nDavid has been featured in Mother Earth News, Backwoods Home, Heirloom Gardener Magazine, The Grow Network and other outlets.
