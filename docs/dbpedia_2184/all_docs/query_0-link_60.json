        "text": "Have you ever wanted a giant list of clichés to avoid (or use) in your writing?\n\nWell, you're in the right place! We've gathered the internet's most comprehensive list of clichés all in one place for your writing pleasure.\n\nBut before we get to the list, let's take a moment to review what a cliché is and whether or not you should use one in your work.\n\nWhat Is a Cliché?\n\nA cliché is a tired, stale phrase or idiom that, because of overuse, has lost its impact. What was once a fresh way of looking at something has become a weak prop for writing that feels unimaginative and dull. Clichés are what you write when you don’t have the energy or inspiration to think of a new way to express an idea.\n\nGeorge Orwell in his Rules of Writing said:\n\nBe creative and come up with something fresh. A new analogy or metaphor will make much more of an impression on your readers than a dusty old cliché.\n\nExamples of Clichés in Everyday Language\n\nSometimes clichés are so inherent in our vernacular though that they appear in our content without thought. How many times have you relied on any of the following phrases, whether in conversations or in your writing:\n\nread between the lines\n\nplay your cards right\n\nit’s an uphill battle\n\nbetter safe than sorry\n\nyou can’t judge a book by its cover\n\nbring to the table\n\nlow-hanging fruit\n\nthe grass is always greener on the other side\n\nignorance is bliss\n\nThese are a few of the tried and true (there’s another one) clichés that wiggle into our work, but add nothing to our conversations. Time and again (cliché), we resort to a cliché instead of stretching to find our own unique voice.\n\nThat said, writers often use clichés in their first drafts and that’s fine. Taking the time to think of a better metaphor can interrupt writing flow. When you switch to editing mode, go back to those clichés and brainstorm for inventive new ideas. A good writer may create and reject over a dozen images before finding the right one, so don’t worry if it takes you a while.\n\nHow to Find the Clichés that Have Crept into Your Writing\n\nSo how can you tell when you’re using a cliché? One method is to slowly read your work out loud and try to develop mental pictures of your content. Are your points specific and clear, or do some ideas appear vague? If so, you might have used a cliché.\n\nAnother technique is to analyze each sentence to see if what you wrote is likely to have appeared in anyone else’s work. Since no one has the same experiences as you, your work should express your unique voice and your individual thoughts. And sometimes we resort to clichés when we haven’t researched our subjects thoroughly enough to be original.\n\nWe think the best way to detect clichés in your writing and avoid “cliché creep” is by using ProWritingAid’s (free) Cliché Check. The report will analyze your content and find those phrases that you might not have even realized were clichés. By running each piece of work through the ProWritingAid platform, you’ll learn to recognize clichés as you write them so that you can go back and replace them with something unique.\n\nLooking for more info about cliches?
