        "text": "Enjoyable but not her best\n\nThis was a good read. I enjoyed the story. A great conclusion. I did have issues with the characters. I don't care for the character that ALWAYS gets the better of everyone at least until he has his downfall. This, like \"man wrongly accused\" is often over used.\n\nIf you can get beyond the fact that everyone is a legal idiot (seriously? do people not pay attention to the laws and how they work? really?) there are actually some fun characters in the book. The characters aren't drawn consistently, but they do work together for the most part.\n\nThe story kept my interest and I would recommend it with reservation.\n\nCONVOLUTED AND DISAPPOINTING\n\nMINETTE WALTERS' NOVEL FOX EVIL UNLIKE MANY OF HER OTHER SUSPENSE STORIES JUST TRIES TOO HARD. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING CONTAINED WHO DUN IT. INSTEAD CHARARACTERS PRESENT AND PAST KEEP CROPPING UP. SOME WITH POTENTIAL, BUT OTHERS WHO JUST DIDN'T THRILL ME--I JUST WASN'T INTERESTED IN THEM.\n\nSIMON PREBBLE DOES A GOOD JOB NARRATING ALL THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS, BUT EVEN HE SEEMS TO LOSE THE THREAD OF WHO IS WHO, VOCALLY.\n\nWALTERS IS USUALLY TIGHTLY PLOTTED. SO I WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN THIS STORY. THE SUBPLOTS OF FOX HUNTING WITH NARRATIVE ABOUT CRUELTY TO ANIMALS WAS ALSO SOMETHING I DISLIKED, SO PEOPLE SENSITIVE TO ABUSE ELEMENTS SHOULD BE FOREWARNED.\n\nI HAVE READ MANY OF MS. WALTERS' MYSTERIES AND THIS ONE DOESN'T MAKE THE GRADE."
