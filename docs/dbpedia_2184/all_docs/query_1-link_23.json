        "text": "I Just Want To Make Everyone Smile\n\nAnd If I Become An Evil Villain To Accomplish That\n\nIs That Bad?\n\nQueen\n\nQueen, full name Serial Number Q5U4EX7YY2E9N, is a Darkner who rules Cyber World. She is the main antagonist and final boss of Chapter 2 in Deltarune.\n\nAt the end of Chapter 2, she uses her GIGA Queen mecha to fight the party, with this mecha serving as the Chapter 2 final boss on a normal route.\n\nProfile\n\nAppearance\n\nQueen is a tall and slim black, azure, and white Darkner. She wears a sleeveless black top with an azure masonic collar that has slightly spiked shoulders and a large white medici-styled collar, white pants/leggings (occasionally with either side half of the pants being shaded azure), black high-heeled calf-length boots, elbow-length azure gloves, a beauty spot at the right of her eyes, azure lipstick, and an azure cap with black marks on each side that sweeps significantly behind her head. Her eyes are a dark screen with a heart-like shape with eyelashes , occasionally showing red text according to her emotions. Her overall design bears a resemblance to Lancer and King, despite her being a computer rather than a playing card like they are.\n\nGIGA Queen has white skin like Queen, along with a black heart-shaped screen as eyes, while having a jordy-blue star-like cap, and matching lipstick. She wears azure shoulder pads, a sleeveless jordy-blue leotard with a thin black belt around it that has a azure diamond-shaped crystal-like object in the middle of her, shorter azure gloves, and azure high-heeled pumps. When doing her acid attack, GIGA Queen's star cap and leotard turn to the same green color as her acid.\n\nPersonality\n\nQueen is a benevolent, if somewhat airheaded, person. While she is the main antagonist, it is mostly out of lack of insight rather than malice. She seems reluctant about controlling people she likes, and would rather they willingly go along with her plans to make them happy. She is also prone to giving people pet names and describing them using fun adjectives. She genuinely believes she is doing the right thing by opening Dark Fountains, and after she learns the truth of The Roaring from Ralsei, she recognizes that she was misguided and immediately stops her plan.\n\nBeing a computer, she has a unique speech pattern evident by her capitalizing first letters of every word in her dialogue, which can either denote a robotic monotone or her over-enunciating every word as if it were its own sentence. She also neglects the use of punctuation marks or puts them in rather weird places, for computer-y effects like imitating a text template (e.g. You Have Been: [text]). She also uses Internet acronyms when talking, such as LMAO. She often laughs in a distinguished manner.\n\nDespite her questionable actions and her naive personality, Queen does seem to care for the party, including Berdly. It is shown that, despite finding the latter annoying, she tries to warn him about his arm being damaged before he takes his plug out of his face. She also tries to appeal to them by giving them rooms with things based off their history search. In the end of a normal route, she gives Noelle the option to ignore her desire to create a new fountain and lets her choose herself.\n\nMain Story\n\nHistory\n\nNot much is known about Queen or her past, except for the fact that she and her kingdom seem to take power from Lightners going on their devices and using the internet. She makes references to a past relationship with King, however, it's unknown how intimate they were. Seam also mentions knowing her long ago. Queen is not flesh and blood, as she states multiple times that she is a computer, and there is no indication that she knew Lancer prior to meeting him in Ralsei's Castle Town.\n\nAt some point in the past, Queen overtook Spamton as the Cyber World's most popular figure, with advertisements of his becoming overlaid with her own ads.\n\nAfter losing access to the Internet, she became somewhat insane, brainwashing her Plugboy subjects and doing other considerably heinous things. At some point, Queen was able to obtain a video of a Dark Fountain being formed.\n\nChapter 1\n\nNot much is known about Queen during Chapter 1, however, it is mentioned that 'SOON, THE \"QUEEN\" RETURNS' by Jevil.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAfter the Knight creates a Dark Fountain in the Library's computer room, Queen takes control of the Cyber World. When Berdly and Noelle enter the Cyber World, Queen abducts Noelle and reluctantly accepts Berdly as a minion. She wants to make Noelle her \"willing peon\" and roboticize her face. Queen tries to get Noelle to fight the Lightners, but Noelle only talks to Susie, so she brings in Berdly to fight them.\n\nAfter defeating Berdly, Kris meets Noelle who has escaped from Queen, and who Queen is looking for. Queen decides to form a truce with Kris until she finds Noelle. Later on, it becomes increasingly evident that Queen genuinely cares for Noelle. Queen tells Kris that she only wants to entertain people, and asks if being evil to reach this goal is such a bad thing.\n\nEventually, the Lightners, including Noelle and Berdly, reach the Queen's Mansion, where the Queen declares the end of her truce and imprisons everyone but Ralsei, who briefly becomes a butler due to her running out of cages. Berdly joins forces with Kris and the others to take down Queen and save Noelle. However, Queen captures Berdly again and uses a wire to control him. After a battle with Queen and the controlled Berdly, Queen once again escapes and delivers a monologue about the Knight and wanting to use the power of the Lightners to expand the Cyber World with more Dark Fountains. Susie strikes her down, but Queen retreats to her giant robot.\n\nAfter a giant robot fight, Noelle tells Queen that she will never be happy if Queen is controlling her. Ralsei also tells everyone including Queen that opening more Dark Fountains will bring the Roaring, an event that will destroy all Darkners and bring chaos to the world. Queen realizes the error of her ways and ends hostilities with the Lightners. She then goes to Castle Town with the rest of the recruited Darkners.\n\nA cutscene in Castle Town reveals she has some history with King, and she quickly becomes friends with Lancer. She also states that she is taking in Lancer as her new son in a cutscene with King.\n\nIn Battle\n\nAttacks\n\nQueen\n\nStomp: One of Queen's boots drops down from the top of the Bullet Board on the left, middle, or right sections of it. The order of the stomped sections is random, though the three sections are always stomped in a row. A blinking \"!\" box appears before the boot comes down, similar to one of Asgore's attacks from Undertale. Eleven stomps happen before the attack ends, though the eleventh boot doesn't reach the bottom of the Bullet Board.\n\nExploding Heads: Vectorized heads of Queen resembling the ones seen in the Deltarune start-up animation form up around the Bullet Board and laugh before exploding into smaller, spinning white heads of her. The placement and speed at which they form are random. Later on in the fight, the heads appear quicker as well.\n\nQueen Laser: Screens similar to those in the Cyber World appear outside the Bullet Board, containing green cursors aimed at the SOUL. They shoot a quick beam from whatever direction the cursor was aimed. A faint red line can also be seen to signify the path, similar to one of King's attacks in Chapter 1.\n\nLater in the fight, Queen combines Stomp and Queen Laser, and eventually all three attacks.\n\nBerdly Tornado: Berdly descends from above and unleashes waves of six tornadoes, three to the left of the Bullet Board and three to the right, each pair of which crosses each other in the middle of the Board on different times. Berdly fires four waves in the beginning of the fight. Later on in the battle, he will begin firing five waves, which are closer together. The spot in which the tornadoes cross may also be slightly off-center.\n\nNew Social Media: Various heads in boxes scroll alongside the Bullet Board, spouting generic topics and keywords that scroll either left or right, almost as if they're texting to each other. After this attack is executed for the first time, an added blue icon containing Queen's head comes in after a bit and spouts out the red word \"DRAMA\", causing drama among the crowd, as the icons freeze and start cursing everywhere, with red grawlixes flying across all directions, and Queen's icon is just laughing at the madness. Any boxes with the head of an Everyman do not attack.\n\nPlug: Two plugs electrify the Bullet Board's border and alternate spitting out sparks in different directions, while the board itself moves left and right. This resembles the King's spike wall attack combined with the Werewire's spark attack. Later in the fight, the board starts rotating and only one plug is present, but it spits out more sparks.\n\nWine: When she fills up her firewall, it is preceded by an attack involving a chalice-shaped Bullet Board, where white drops of liquid rain down and fill up the board with a white liquid. After the first use, the chalice begins to tilt as well.\n\nUltimate Attack: A download bar reading \"DOWNLOADING: ULTIMATE ATTACK\" appears above her, but stops at 60%. It then fails and a bunch of different pop-ups appears to cover up most of the board as her vector heads start popping up.\n\nQueen attacks in the following order before either her HP or Berdly's MERCY reaches 50%:\n\nBerdly Tornado I\n\nStomp\n\nExploding Heads I\n\nQueen Laser\n\nNew Social Media I\n\nPlug I\n\nStomp + Queen Laser\n\nAfterwards, Queen randomly chooses between the previous attacks, except for Plug. After putting up her shield for the second time, Queen performs the first order again, and afterwards switches to the following order:\n\nNew Social Media II\n\nBerdly Tornado II\n\nExploding Heads II\n\nPlug II\n\nStomp + Queen Laser + Exploding Heads\n\nAfterwards, Queen randomly chooses between these five attacks for the remainder of the battle. Additionally, she will use Wine when Berdly's MERCY is above 25% or Queen's HP falls below 75%, when Berdly's MERCY is above 50% or Queen's HP falls below 50%, and when Berdly's MERCY is above 75% or Queen's HP falls below 25%, and her Ultimate Attack the turn after her shield is destroyed for the third time. When using either Wine or Ultimate Attack, Queen pauses the sequence, then continues from where she left off in it after using these attacks.\n\nGIGA Queen\n\nGIGA Queen crouches and flashes with a ping! sound, before attacking in the center with a kick. Similar to Undertale's Asgore fight, the number of times that she flashes determines the number of times that she attacks.\n\nGIGA Queen throws baseballs that glow red when the Thrash Machine can hit them. Successfully hitting this attack causes a baseball to fall on GIGA Queen, dealing damage.\n\nGIGA Queen summons yellow wheels that roll from both sides.\n\nGIGA Queen turns green in order to fire a light cone from her acid glass to the left or to the right. She then throws the acid glass in that direction, which in turn spawns a short acid cloud.\n\nMany copies of Queen fly towards the screen, leaving a gap to dodge them.\n\nGIGA Queen releases missiles out of her chest that fall down.\n\nGIGA Queen exhales a line of fire that moves back and forth. The line has gaps which the SOUL can pass through from one side to the other.\n\nThis attack and the previous one both use Kris's SOUL for dodging, rather than the Thrash Machine itself.\n\nFinal attack: Copies of GIGA Queen fly from the top before she throws a comically large slow-moving baseball, which must be punched to end the battle.\n\nStrategy\n\nQueen\n\nDuring her first encounter, Queen uses Berdly hypnotized by a Werewire cable to attack the party for her. The battle ends when Berdly is fully loosened from the cable or Queen's (chair's) health is depleted. If aiming to defeat Queen through ACTing, it should be noted that the following actions increase Berdly's mercy when Queen is Defenseless:\n\nEach party member can Loosen the cable by 5% (or GroupLoosen for 15% at once). If two members are down, the remaining one can Loosen the cable by 8%.\n\nSimilarly, with Werewire, Susie can Throw Kris to hit as many targets as possible: starting with 2, they increase as the battle progresses, up to 6, and each target gives an amount mercy depending on the phase (rounded up). In phase 1 it gives 12.5 mercy (rounded up), in phase 2 it gives 8.333333333333334, in phase 3 it gives 6.75, and in phase 4 it gives 5% (this can be combined with Ralsei's Loosen, for a potential 30% Mercy increase in a single turn for most situations).[1]\n\nIf the party pushes the battle by violence at first, then starts to loosen Berdly after the third shield is broken, it is possible that 6 targets show up on a wire at once, thus 30% mercy can be given just by throwing in a single turn.\n\nAdditionally, both Red Buster and Dual Heal will be available during the fight.\n\nOn three occasions (specifically, when Berdly's MERCY is above 25% or Queen's HP falls below 75%; when Berdly's MERCY is above 50% or Queen's HP falls below 50%; and when Berdly's MERCY is above 75% or Queen's HP falls below 25%), Queen uses Wine, then puts up a shield powered by her chalice of battery acid, protecting her from attacks and preventing the party from loosening Berdly's wire. The party must then deplete the shield's power, after which the battle continues as normal. Each of the shields has a certain amount of HP, with the first one having 400 HP and the second and third ones having 500 HP. Aside from directly attacking them, the shields' HP can be depleted via ACTing. Specifically, each single Toast will deplete one-sixth of the first shield's HP, and one-eight of the other shields' HP. However, if the ACTing party member is the only non-downed one, 2.5 times as much HP will be depleted. A Group Toast will deplete as much HP as the three party members Toasting separately. Also, the first, second, and third shields are made out of seven, ten, or twelve rectangular sections, respectively, which will become a darker green as the shield's HP is depleted, allowing the player to see roughly how much HP the shield has left.\n\nGIGA Queen\n\nDepending on what head is selected while building the Thrash Machine in Chapter 1, it gets a unique ability, each doing something different.\n\nIf the Laser Head is selected, Thrash Machine gets LaserMode, greatly increasing attack speed for the turn (from 3 hits to 4 hit each aperture time).\n\nIf the Sword Head is selected, Thrash Machine gets SwordMode, increasing damage with every hit until the next miss (basically 1.3 times, and each hit increases 0.05 times; if it is above 1.6, 0.02 instead).\n\nIf the Flame Head is selected, Thrash Machine gets FireMode, greatly increasing damage to 1.5 times.\n\nIf the Duck Head is selected, Thrash Machine gets DuckMode, which decreases 30 damage of act attack, but heals about 35 HP, and heals 2 HP per punch against GIGA Queen.\n\nIf the machine was never made (e.g. by starting with Chapter 2 instead of Chapter 1) a random head is selected.\n\nFor avoiding GIGA Queen's attacks:\n\nWhen GIGA Queen flashes with a ping! dodge to the left, right, or by ducking; corresponding to the number of pings.\n\nAs GIGA Queen fires baseballs at the Thrash Machine, the Thrash Machine should hit them back. There are usually only three to hit, and it also leaves her open for extra attacks afterward.\n\nGIGA Queen's acid throw can be avoided by paying attention to which direction the cone of light is facing and then dodging into the opposite direction. Ducking also works and is considerably easier as there is no need to worry about the direction of the attack.\n\nFor the copies of GIGA Queen, there is a gap to the left or right where the attack can be dodged. When the gap isn't there, there is a GIGA Queen in the center doing a taunting pose, which must be ducked under (pressing down).\n\nGIGA Queen's final attack re-uses the same strategies for the clones attack and the baseball. Hitting the large baseball at the end of the attack ends the fight with a cutscene.\n\nFollowing Ralsei's advice, attacks should be dodged and then as many hits as possible should be attempted.\n\nUsing an Attack to deal more damage makes the fight shorter.\n\nDue to how the missiles target the SOUL via loose homing, it's best to stand still for a bit so they mostly go for a single area, similar to the Party Dojo's explanation of grazing.\n\nThe Thrash Machine's attack power is based on Kris's Attack stat. Its defense is independent, however. Therefore it is a good idea to equip Kris with items that increase their attack power, such as the Mecha Saber, the Iron Shackle, the Jevilstail, or Frayed Bowties.\n\nQuotes\n\nPre-Battle\n\nQueen\n\n[Susie] There she is!\n\n[Susie] Queen!!!!

However, given her quip that she arbitrarily came to the decision to take care of him whilst talking to King, it is unknown whether the two are biologically related. They can be seen hanging out on lawn chairs right outside the rooms that Ralsei made for his friends. Lancer refers to Queen as \"girldad\" to which Ralsei asks if he means \"a mom.\" Queen and Lancer both share a laugh, calling Ralsei \"Peachboy.\" Strangely, Lancer refers to Queen as a \"wild Mom\" after being released from Kris's pocket in Queen's Mansion, making their exact relationship inconsistent.\n\nKris\n\nKris is possibly the only party member Queen takes a genuine liking to when they first meet. When they're on their own for the first time, Queen brings up Kris not having opinions and screaming at all and is unable to comprehend why others are not more like them. She also makes a truce with Kris so that they can find their respective allies while entrusting Kris to not tell Berdly where she's hiding whenever he appears alone. Twice in the game, Queen prompts Kris to grab a banana in the path for the potassium.\n\nRalsei\n\nQueen doesn't acknowledge Ralsei until after she captures Kris, Susie, and Berdly. Since she doesn't know how to capture Ralsei, she decides to make him a butler for her mansion, which Ralsei agrees to. She also seems to be prone to forgetting Ralsei's presence as she forgot about Ralsei while capturing the others and could not even remember if there was a third party member when attempting to bribe the party during the final fight.\n\nNoelle\n\nQueen's main goal is to find Noelle so that she can use her will to aid her in world dominance. Naturally terrified by this, Noelle tries to hide from her most of the time. However, when Queen doesn't know Noelle is around, she expresses genuine concern for her well-being since she could be lost alone in the city. Even after capturing Noelle and being defeated, she still doesn't force her and gives her the choice to make a better world, not wanting to see Noelle sad.\n\nBerdly\n\nBerdly becomes Queen's minion without her consent, wanting to create a world for himself and Noelle. Queen barely puts up with him, mistaking his name to be \"Burghley\" (or forgetting altogether) and frequently ditching him because she finds him annoying. In the battle with Queen and the mind-controlled Berdly, she reveals that she only intended to use the face plug on him.\n\nJevil\n\nIf Jevil is fought instead of pacified in Chapter 1, he mentions the \"Queen\" will return. It is likely he is referring to Queen herself, and that he has met the Queen in person, as Tasque Manager appears to have a personal dislike of Jevil.\n\nGallery\n\nTrivia\n\nIf Berdly was defeated via violence in earlier fights, it becomes impossible to loosen him without injury in Queen's fight, regardless of how the party chooses to defeat Queen.\n\nIt is possible to deplete the HP of Queen's chair while completely loosening Berdly in a single turn. However, if the fight ends up in this way, his arm still gets hurt, regardless how Berdly was defeated in earlier fights.\n\nQueen shares a number of similarities with Princess Shroob from the Mario and Luigi series. Both characters are shown carrying a chalice (may or may not be filled with green liquid), have red eyes with black sclera, and are a part of a royal lineage. Their boss battles in particular are often compared because of their use of floating thrones and defense shields.\n\nDespite wearing pants, there are some sprites such as her run sprite that gives her outfit a leotard-like appearance. There are also some odd sprites that portray the markings on the sides of her head as dark blue rather than black.\n\nThe sound effect and iris-out transition used after the scene where Queen captures Kris, Susie, and Berdly is a reference to the level-clear animation from Super Mario World.\n\nQueen's distinctive laugh can be heard upon starting Chapter 2. A wireframe version of Queen also appears on the splash screen before the Chapter 2 file is selected.\n\nQueen's \"serial number\" contains all of the letters needed to spell her name, in the right order.\n\nThe GIGA Queen battle theme \"Knock You Down!!\" is very similar to and appears to be based upon the SNES Mighty Morphin Power Rangers End Boss theme.\n\nGIGA Queen's entire fight, as well as the arcade game at the beginning of Chapter 2, is a direct reference to Punch-Out!!, a fighting game series that originated as an arcade game and was later released on NES, SNES, and Wii.\n\nGIGA Queen's fight background may be a reference to Touhou 17's final stage background, which both feature a scrolling, flashing hallway filled with screens/windows, all the while inside a highly technological city.\n\nGIGA Queen's max HP is 4500, but the team should deplete 4800 HP, since at the third round GIGA Queen has 1800 HP.\n\nIf the Thrash Machine does not get hit at all during the first 2 rounds of the GIGA Queen fight, she is further powered up in the third round, to the point her movements leave blue shadows behind. However, the Thrash Machine is also able to inflict higher damage to her in this case.\n\nThis can only happen on the first attempt at fighting GIGA Queen. If the Thrash Machine is defeated and try again is chosen on the game over screen, GIGA Queen does not power up, even if the Thrash Machine avoids taking any damage in the first 2 rounds. If the save file is reloaded, it becomes possible again.\n\nIf the Thrash Machine loses to GIGA Queen, she repeatedly ducks, referencing the action popular in multiplayer games called \"teabagging\" or \"t-bagging.\"[2]\n\nQueen's Light World equivalent appears to be a high-end laptop. This may explain her comments about \"only playing mobile games\" and her love of battery acid.\n\nHer similar appearance to King and Lancer despite being unrelated to playing cards may be a reference to the Solitaire application that is typically pre-installed on a Microsoft device. An unused attack assigned to her also references Microsoft Solitaire.[3]\n\nHowever, GIGA Queen may represent the Queen of Diamonds, indicated by a diamond-shaped crystal on the chest of GIGA Queen.\n\nShe may also represent the Queen of Hearts, as her dark screen eyes seem to form the shape of a heart, similar to King and Lancer's eyes being covered by the shape of a spade.\n\nIn the Japanese version of Deltarune, the texting acronym \"LMAO\" is replaced with \"WWW\" and \"草 (kusa / grass)\", because they're texting slangs Japanese use to represent laughing. Also, all of her dialogue is surrounded by HTML comments (<!-- -->).\n\nDuring the GIGA Queen fight, if the party attacks the (small) baseballs she throws but refuses to attack GIGA Queen, Queen, and the narration still comments as if no buttons were pressed.\n\nThere is a bug in the first fight with Queen. If using \"Rude Buster\" or \"Red Buster\" to attack acid shield, the number of the damage will not appear. It may be because of the lack of some sentence in the program, not the overflow of the damage.\n\nQueen is one of four characters in Deltarune so far with voice acting, the other three being Spamton, Tasque Manager, and Jevil.\n\nWhen she first appears to the party, the track Ohhhhohohoho! is played, consisting of Queen laughing.\n\nQueen's \"New Social Media\" attack will randomly pick four of the following words every time it's used:\n\n\"LOL\" \"TOP10\" \"FAMILY\" \"GUY\" \"FUNNY\" \"MOMENTS\" \"GIRL\" \"DOLL\" \"BOY\" \"QUEEN\" \"TALE\" \"JOKE\" \"FASHION\" \"MIX\" \"SOUND\" \"VIDEO\" \"TOP20\" \"LAUGH\" \"AND\" \"CRY\" \"LIKE\" \"RATE\"\n\nThe words \"FAMILY\", \"GUY\", \"FUNNY\", and \"MOMENTS\" are a reference to the meme \"Family Guy Funny Moments\", down to the order in which they appear in the game code.[4]\n\nIn the Summer 2023 UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE newsletter, it is revealed that Toby Fox did the voices of Queen and Tasque Manager."
