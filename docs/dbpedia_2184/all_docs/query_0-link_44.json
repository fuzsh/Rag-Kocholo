        "text": "A federal appeals court ruled Friday that Iowa’s law banning books with sexual content from school libraries can take effect.\n\nThe law also prohibits instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity before seventh grade. Those provisions were challenged in two lawsuits and were blocked by a court from late December until now.\n\nA three-judge panel from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the temporary injunction and said the lawsuits can continue in U.S. district court.\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird called the ruling a victory.\n\n“Parents will no longer have to fear what their kids have access to in schools when they are not around.”\n\nJoshua Brown, president of the Iowa State Education Association, which was one of the groups challenging the law, said he is disappointed in the decision. Brown said banning books is a burden for educators and students, who “are deprived of reading from great authors with valuable stories.”\n\nThis upcoming school year is the third one where Des Moines Public Schools will offer free breakfast and lunch to all of its 30,000 students, regardless of their family income.\n\nThe program is funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Community Eligibility Provision for school districts that serve predominantly low-income families.\n\nDMPS Director of Food and Nutrition Services Amanda Miller said offering all students free meals takes away the stigma faced by low-income students.\n\n“We used to have to worry about parents putting money in their account, and then what do you do if they if there's a negative balance? And so that is all gone,” Miller said. “We're allowing people to come in and to have a safe space to eat meals.”\n\nMiller said the district hopes to continue this program indefinitely.\n\nThe crowd at the “Big Boar” competition roared as this year’s winner weighed in and Swine Barn Superintendent Ernie Barnes announced the result. “1,420 pounds,” Barnes said, and his congratulations that followed were drowned out by the cheers, whoops and applause of those watching.\n\nThe winner is 120 pounds heavier than the previous record set by a boar from Indianola.\n\n“I won in ’19 and then in ’21 as well, and we were close to the record, but I really had my goal set for the record,” Bryan Britt of Monticello said. “Back home, I’m known as ‘the big boar guy.’”\n\nBritt, who is Irish, called the boar Finnegan for good luck.\n\n“I’m a pork producer and I’ve been raising pigs all my life. I’ve raised this guy since birth. For me to break that record, it’s really nice. I couldn’t believe that he was that much heavier.”\n\nWhile some of the bulked-up boars in these types of competitions eat things like donuts and drink milk in addition to about 20 pounds of feed a day, Britt said Finnegan is a “finicky eater.” Britt is keeping the ingredients in Finnegan’s standard ratios a bit of a trade secret.\n\n“I picked him out at birth, thinking he had a big skeleton. You’ve got to feed them right to get them to this size. It just doesn’t happen overnight.”\n\nFinnegan is three years old and has a taste for what’s sometimes called the “Irish champagne.”\n\n“I’ve given him a Guinness and he seems to like that,” Britt said, with a laugh, adding that he likes a pint of his own on occasion.\n\nThere were six other contestants in this year’s “Big Boar” competition at the State Fair. Britt’s boar weighed nearly 400 pounds more than his closest competitor.\n\nFinnegan will spend the next ten days in the Swine Barn at the Iowa State Fair, then due to biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of disease, Finnegan won’t return to Britt’s operation. He will spend the rest of his days on another farm nearby.\n\nWhen middle and high school students return to Gehlen Catholic School in Le Mars in a few weeks, they will be facing a new “no cell phone” policy.\n\nPrincipal Bryan Paulson said they’ve tried restricting cell phone use in the past, but it just wasn’t working.\n\n“Each classroom in grades seven through 12 had a cell phone holder, and the kids were to turn their cell phones in to the holders with the teachers, and then they would get the cell phones back at the end of class. Some students were just leaving them in their pockets. They were trying to just leave them in their bags. Cell phones were a big distraction in the hallways in between classes.”\n\nThe policy going into effect this fall will force all students to surrender their devices upon entering the building.\n\n“When the students get here in the morning, they will come to our center meeting area, and we actually have cell phone lockers. If you talk to the kids, they call them ‘jails,’ but there’s an actual case. Each kid will be assigned a slot to put their cell phone and their devices into, and then they’ll go off to class for the day, and we’ll lock those up.”\n\nUnder the plan, phones will be passed back out to students in the final five or so minutes of the day. Paulson said cell phone use by students was having a negative impact on their behavior and attitudes toward learning, and some weren’t engaged in the classroom.\n\n“Students were rushing through their tests just so they could get on their phone. We had a couple of teachers tell us if they saw one student go on their phone, other students would start to wonder what they were doing on their phone, if they were Snapping, if they were missing something on TikTok. So, we kind of saw their anxiety rise.”\n\nThere will be exceptions to the policy for students who need their phones during the day to contact a parent or to go to a doctor’s appointment. Paulson said Gehlen Catholic parents are urged to discuss the matter and the new policy with their children.\n\nMany Iowa homeowners are seeing their insurance premiums rise, and some companies are refusing to insure some properties altogether.\n\nSonya Sellmeyer, a consumer advocacy officer in the Iowa Insurance Division, said there have been a series of rate increases since the derecho that hit Iowa in August of 2020.\n\n“It just seems like ever since then, we’ve just continued to get hit by storms. It costs a lot of money to repair that damage, for many different reasons — inflation, material costs have gone up, the reinsurance that the companies themselves have has gone up for them.”\n\nReinsurance is essentially insurance for insurance companies.\n\nSellmeyer said Iowans facing a significant hike in homeowners’ insurance could consider a higher deductible if it’s an amount they can afford. Sellmeyer encouraged Iowans to have a discussion with their licensed insurance agent to ensure their policy would cover the cost of replacing their home and its contents.\n\n“You don’t want to be paying something — especially as it becomes more expensive — that’s not going to give you what you really need to replace your home in case something would happen. And understand your riders that you have, too, on your policy or that you may need. Sump pump and sewer riders are very important.”\n\nFlooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the U.S. There has been a federal flood insurance program since the 1960s for properties in a flood plain and a federal rule change in 2019 encouraged private companies to sell flood insurance policies.\n\nSellmeyer said you can buy private flood insurance in Iowa even if your property is not in a flood plain.\n\n“I spent a weekend in Spencer, shortly after the flooding happened, with those survivors there and I strongly suggest all Iowans need to sit down with their insurance agent and see if this is something that they need.”\n\nAccording to the National Association of Realtors, home insurance premiums in the U.S. are expected to rise about 6% on average nationwide by the end of the year.\n\nThe attorneys general from Iowa, Nebraska and nine other states are asking the Environmental Protection Agency to make it clear there’s a national standard for labeling Roundup and other weed killers that contain glyphosate.\n\nDuring a news conference this morning in Omaha, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said a new EPA rule is needed because California has proposed cancer warnings on Roundup and other products that contain the world’s most commonly used herbicide.\n\n“If we don’t stop it now…the glyphosate situation — that is just the tip of the iceberg,” Bird said. “There will be other things that states like California try to do to tell our farmers how to farm and that future will make it very hard for farmers to be able to grow their crops, which is what it’s all about. Food does not come from a grocery store. It comes from a farm.”\n\nThe EPA has said glyphosate is not likely to cause cancer in humans and in November, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Monsanto — the maker of Roundup — and said California did not have authority to require a cancer warning on Roundup’s label. Bird said it’s time for the EPA “to set things straight.”\n\n“Farmers have a lot to deal with…sometimes low crop prices, high input prices, natural disasters,” Bird said. “They shouldn’t have to worry about the types of things that are happening in other states on the coasts to figure out how they’re going to make their family farm work.”\n\nKevin Ross, a farmer from Underwood and former president of the National Corn Growers Association, said there is no real substitute for glyphosate.\n\n“It’s been one of the most tested chemicals ever on the marketplace, and it’s known to be safe and very effective,” Ross said, “so EPA — set the regulations, do your job in DC and let us farmers do our job on the ground here in the U.S.”\n\nMonsanto’s attorneys have argued that a warning label on Roundup violates the company’s First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech that it disagrees with. This spring, the Iowa Senate passed a bill to block lawsuits against farm chemical companies based on how the products are labeled, but it stalled in the House. Similar bills were introduced in other states. Monsanto, now owned by Bayer, has settled about 100,000 lawsuits, and the company estimates there are more than 50,000 pending.\n\nA Colorado-based company will soon begin testing in Carroll County as it searches for hydrogen trapped underground. Scientists say natural hydrogen could be a source of clean energy.\n\nChris Justice, a representative of Twin Rivers Exploration, says a truck that’s a little smaller than a garbage truck is used for what they call “vibro-seismic” testing.\n\n“It has a plate, maybe three feet in diameter. It gently lowers this plate to the ground and then it will shake and send kind of a vibration through the ground,” he says. “We place sensors along the road that will pick up the signals of how these vibrations bounce off of different geologic formations, which will allow us to map out underground formations.”\n\nTwin Rivers Exploration recently completed land surveys in Webster County, and the company has mapped out a five-mile-square grid to survey, with the small Carroll County town of Lidderdale at its center. Scientists say when iron-rich rocks come into contact with water deep underground, hydrogen is generated, and the hydrogen can get trapped under a dome.\n\n“The hydrogen should come out of the ground on its own. Hydrogen, being a gas, it should flow out freely,” Justice says. “What you’d be looking at is about a five foot tall wellhead that sits on about a five acre pad.”\n\nThere’s only one well in the world currently collecting natural hydrogen from underground and it’s in Mali, a country on the west side of the African continent. Drilling for hydrogen is underway in Europe, South America and in Nebraska and Kansas. Justice says there would be a fairly large boost to the local economy if his company finds underground hydrogen in Carroll County.\n\n“Depending on the quantity, we would probably use it for ammonia to help make fertilizer. Hydrogen is a major component of ammonia that is right now created through very expensive means, so it would help the fertilizer industry quite a bit,” Justice says. “If we found it in greater quantities there could be applications in electricity and, in enormous quantities, even transportation.”\n\nJustice says the company’s trucks should arrive in Carroll County around Aug. 19 and crews should complete their work in the area by the end of the month. The trucks will move at a one-mile-per-hour pace and the company will have people redirecting traffic, if necessary.\n\nThe Des Moines City Council is scheduled to meet later this month, when they’ll likely cast a third and final vote on amended ordinances that affect unhoused people. The new laws would ban sleeping in public spaces and cut the amount of time given to remove belongings from city property.\n\nMark Stringer, executive director of the Iowa Chapter of the ACLU, opposes the proposed laws.\n\n“To push forward this ordinance, which basically penalizes unhoused people for having to sleep and having to find a place to live…that’s just inhumane. The solution’s not to pass more draconian laws that harass and fine people with no resources, but to focus on better access to shelters and programs that can help these people so they don’t remain homeless.”\n\nStringer called these laws inhumane for focusing on getting homeless people out of sight.\n\n“The through-line seemed to be the homeless don’t make Des Moines look good. And that’s not the basis of policy like this, not when we’re talking about real humans. We’re not talking about imaginary people. We’re talking about people with lives, and they just can’t be discarded like this.”\n\nSupporters of the ordinances say they’ll compel unhoused people to seek services. During last Monday's Council meeting Mayor Connie Boesen said Des Moines shelters have been getting people from as far away as Waterloo and Osceola, and said other communities need to do more to address their unhoused populations.\n\nAs students prepare to start classes in about two weeks, a nonprofit in a rural Iowa county has already passed out 160 school bags with supplies to students. Community Resources In Service to People, or CRISP, is a nonprofit in Madison County that serves families experiencing homelessness through emergency grants and resource matching.\n\nDirector Kathleen Rush says a lack of affordable housing and emergency shelters in the area makes it harder to find long-term housing.\n\n“Sometimes families will have other friends and family they can stay with temporarily. We have helped people find housing in hotels or motels. We have made referrals to Des Moines shelters. We’ve helped pay for tents and campers.”\n\nRush says poverty looks different for each family and there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nShe says most families find CRISP through local school districts or word of mouth.\n\n“There is sometimes some hesitation. So, people have to be ready to receive help and sometimes it’ll start small, like a coat and that will lead into other programming as it becomes available.”\n\nOther programming includes a winter clothing drive and Christmas gifts drive. Rush says CRISP keeps in touch with families through newsletters and check-ins. CRISP services are open to any Madison County family with children under 18 years old.\n\nThe state of Iowa hasn’t issued permits yet for school employees to carry guns on school property under a new law. It’s also still not clear if public schools will be able to arm staff without risking the loss of insurance.\n\nRepublican lawmakers passed the new law this year, allowing school staff to get a professional permit to carry a firearm on school property, which school boards would have to approve.\n\nSchools were already allowed to arm staff, but two districts that chose to do so ended up reversing their policies after their insurance carrier said their coverage wouldn’t be renewed. The new law was meant to address the insurance issues.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Public Safety says that’s because the administrative rules for implementing the law won’t be in effect for about two more months. They’re open for public comment through Aug. 13.\n\nAs for insurance coverage, the company that covers the majority of school districts still isn’t saying publicly if it’ll cover schools that arm staff.\n\nA spokesperson for EMC Insurance says, “We are analyzing the new law and its implications as we continue to evaluate options in this evolving marketplace.”\n\nRead more from Katarina Sostaric.\n\nIt’s been a big year for bad weather in Iowa and State Climatologist Justin Glisan says there’s a new record in a undesirable category — most tornadoes in a single year.\n\n“We’re about 127 tornadoes across the state, and that beats the record that was set back in 2004 with 121 tornadoes, and our season’s not over yet,” Glisan says. “So it’s been a very active severe weather season, with hail, high winds, we’ve had a derecho, but then all these tornadoes as well.”\n\nTornadoes can strike during any month of the year, even during the wintertime. In 2021, Iowa had a record 63 tornadoes in a single day — in December. That was during the state’s second derecho in as many years, and that December outbreak set another record for most EF-2 tornadoes in one day — at 21.\n\nAs for the month ahead, Glisan says August promises to be something of a rollercoaster as far as temperatures.\n\n“Look at those short term outlooks that get us six to ten days out, so in the middle of the month, and they are showing a cooler signal, at least initially,” Glisan says, “Then you look at eight- to 14-day highlights, we’re getting into the third week of August, that’s where we see a slightly elevated signal for warmer temperatures coming back in.”\n\nRainfall should be about average for August, though Glisan notes July rainfall was nothing close to average.\n\n“Particularly in eastern Iowa, we saw rainfall totals 150 - 200% of normal, so you’re thinking two to three inches above,” Glisan says. “Overall across the state, about five and a half inches, preliminarily, and that’s about 1.3 inches above average.”\n\nJuly goes into the books as the 6th wettest July on record for Iowa.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley is sharing his initial impressions of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Vice President Kamala Harris’ pick for a running mate.\n\n“Well, I don’t have any opinion of him,” Grassley said Tuesday morning, “and I realize now that I’ve learned that he served ten years in U.S. House, but I don’t remember any interaction with him.”\n\nWalz served in the House from 2007 to 2019 and was a member of the House Agriculture Committee. Grassley said it’s unusual that he didn’t work with Walz on anything agriculture or ethanol-related in all of those years, especially since they’re from neighboring states. Grassley, a Republican, said he’s done some research on Walz.\n\n“He has changed from being a moderate congressman to being a very liberal, progressive-agenda governor in Minnesota,” Grassley said, “particularly since the Legislature in Minnesota has switched to both houses being Democrat.”\n\nGrassley says voters will have a very clear choice in November between the Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz tickets.\n\n“There’s a whole long list of very liberal pieces of legislation that he’s advocated and has signed,” Grassley said of Walz, “and so that turnaround from somebody that’s moderate to somebody really progressive would kind of surprise me, that he’d have that change of mind.”\n\nWalz was born and raised in Nebraska, served 24 years in the Army National Guard, and worked as a high school social studies teacher before turning to politics. He’s been Minnesota’s governor since 2019.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart released a written statement after the Harris campaign announced Walz would be the vice presidential nominee. Hart said Walz “is a great candidate who understands Midwest principles, how hard Iowans work and the value of a dollar.”\n\nIowans for Tax Relief President Chris Hagenow is optimistic Iowa lawmakers will be open to making changes next year in a tax break for big corporations. It’s called the research activities tax credit and it’s refundable, which means the state is required to cut the corporation a check for any amount above what the company owes in taxes.\n\nHagenow said the latest data from the State of Iowa shows John Deere received over $19 million in tax credits for research activities last year.\n\nJohn Deere was the state’s largest recipient of Iowa’s research activities tax credit in 2023. Hagenow said Iowans may find that worrisome, given recent layoffs at Deere facilities in Iowa, as well as the company’s plan to build a plant in Mexico.\n\n“We generally support a flatter, fairer tax code for everyone without carve-outs for anyone. With regard to John Deere, then, being the biggest recipient of those credits, it really makes it much more difficult to take.”\n\nIn tax year 2023, about 350 corporations filed for the state research activities tax credit, with claims totaling $77 million. Hagenow, a former Republican lawmaker, said he hears from small business owners who cannot qualify for this kind of a “lucrative subsidy.”\n\n“I think Iowans instinctively know a lot of these incentives are there and they’re not always fairly applied.”\n\nThe 1984 Iowa Legislature created the research activities credit. Businesses may receive a credit worth up to 6.5% of the company’s annual budget for research. Backers of the credit said it keeps companies in Iowa that are doing high-value research with highly paid staff.\n\nAccording to a state report, the salaries paid to employees who do research accounted for 56.5% of the total amount of the tax credits awarded last year.\n\nThe third edition of the Refocus Film Festival takes place Oct. 17-20 in downtown Iowa City. On Tuesday, the festival announced its opening night film selection, which will play at the Englert Theatre on Oct. 17.\n\nThe festival, which is rooted in celebrating the art of adaptation, will open with Nightbitch, a comedy horror film starring Amy Adams. It is based on the 2021 novel by Iowa City author Rachel Yoder, who is an assistant professor of cinematic arts at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe story was written for the screen and directed by Marielle Heller, who previously directed the Oscar-nominated films A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nAhead of their programming reveal party Tuesday night, the festival’s executive director, Andrew Sherburne, said they are thrilled to present Yoder’s novel adaptation to the Iowa City community.\n\n“One of this festival’s guiding principles is celebrating Iowa’s incredible contributions to the world\n\nof storytelling. There’s no better way to honor Iowa City’s artistic talent than by showcasing the cinematic adaptation of Rachel’s electric novel Nightbitch. We’re so excited to see this on the big screen.”\n\nPreviously, the festival announced guitarist Marc Ribot’s appearance at a live score event for the 1924 silent Soviet film Aelita: Queen of Mars.\n\nRefocus Film Festival will announce the remaining films and events for the 2024 program at a later date. Passes to attend the festival are available for purchase online.\n\nThe 49 Iowans who are delegates to the Democratic National Convention voted electronically for Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s presidential nominee.\n\nC.J. Petersen is one of those delegates and the designated “whip” to round up votes in the group. Peterson spoke during an online gathering of Iowa Democrats.\n\n“We were all elected as Biden delegates, but we knew that we had to make a decision. And the moment we unanimously voted to unite behind Vice President Harris felt historic to me, because not only were we doing something we were not obligated to do — we could vote for anyone that we wanted to — but it was unprecedented in modern history.”\n\nPetersen made his comments during an online gathering of Iowa Democrats on Monday.\n\n“Giving up power willingly after a lifetime of service is a stunning act of selflessness and patriotism and I want to say ‘Thank you’ one more time to Joe Biden for passing the torch.”\n\nThe 2024 DNC takes place in Chicago Aug. 19-22. There, Harris and her newly-selected running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will officially accept the presidential nomination.\n\nThe state auditor said his office has identified another significant instance of embezzlement in a small Iowa town.\n\nA new report from Auditor Rob Sand alleges former Delhi City Clerk Lori Tucker misused $80,000 in taxpayer funds. The vast majority was in the form of excess wages, unused vacation and payments to a health insurance savings account.\n\n“This is another example of why it's important for governmental entities to have policies in place and procedures in place that allow for and encourage proper oversight of your tax dollars.”\n\nSand said the Iowa Legislature has an opportunity to potentially deter future misuses of taxpayer money.\n\n“If we want to see less embezzlement of tax dollars across the state of Iowa, we are years past-due for the Legislature to make it a mandatory prison sentence, period. I’ve been asking them to do that since I was first elected in 2018 and they still haven’t done it.”\n\nTucker is currently the city clerk of nearby Ryan, and Sand confirmed that Ryan was also under investigation. Sand said his office’s report has been forwarded to the county attorney and Attorney General’s office for potential criminal charges.\n\nSeveral Midwestern states are working to restore oxbows. These u-shaped remnants of meandering rivers and streams provide critical habitat for dozens of bird and fish species. They also store floodwater.\n\nA recent study shows oxbows can remove around 60% of nitrate in water flowing from farm fields to streams and rivers.\n\nKaren Wilke, associate director of fresh water for The Nature Conservancy of Iowa, said it’s natural for oxbows to fill in with sediment over time. But this process has sped up since European settlement.\n\n“Nature wants to get back to nature, right? So, we kind of just help it along its way, and it does its own thing.”\n\nAfter removing sediment and seeding the perimeter to prevent weeds and erosion, Wilke said the water, aquatic plants and wildlife tend to come back on their own.\n\nExperts say not every oxbow needs to be restored, but there’s plenty of work to be done. An average prairie stream can have more than 400 oxbows.\n\nRead more from Harvest Public Media’s Rachel Cramer.\n\nA 77-year-old University of Iowa physics professor was killed, and four others were injured, in a four-vehicle crash in eastern Iowa early Sunday evening.\n\nThe accident happened on Highway 1, near Solon. According to the Iowa State Patrol’s accident report, the driver of a Jeep Cherokee failed to stop at a stop sign, crashed through a camper and hit an SUV on the driver’s side.\n\nUsha Mallik, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Iowa, was driving that third vehicle and died at the scene. A fourth vehicle was hit by debris from the camper.\n\nThe driver of the first vehicle was flown to University of Iowa Hospitals. A one-year-old child, a woman from Cedar Rapids and a man from Paris, France, were taken by ambulance to the same hospital in Iowa City.\n\nThe professor who died in the accident has been involved in research at CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. In 2020, Mallik received a University of Iowa award for being a mentor to students and faculty, as well as her service to the global “high energy physics” community.\n\nFor more than a month now, some Iowa airports have not been reporting their temperature readings and dew points because their systems are disabled.\n\nIt’s information that’s very helpful to pilots, and they’re having to go without — for now — as are weather forecasters and anyone else who might like to access those hourly measurements.\n\nIowa DOT Aviation Director Tim McClung explained what’s going on.\n\n“When we have a temperature sensor that goes down on our aviation weather systems across the state, we’re no longer allowed to just notify pilots that, ‘Hey, the temperature readings are out of tolerance right now.’ We’re now being required to disable that temperature sensor.”\n\nDue to the new federal regulations, the sensors at nine Iowa airports are down, including those at Carroll, Denison, Creston, Clarion and Webster City. McClung said the Iowa DOT is addressing the situation.\n\n“We’re doing our very best to try to circle around and get a larger inventory of sensors and get our technicians out there to get those replaced. This will be a rolling situation for likely the next several months until it cools down.”\n\nMcClung said there is no danger to aircraft from the disabled sensors.\n\nThe DOT said Iowa has 104 public-owned airports, including eight commercial service airports providing airline service and 96 general aviation airports. An additional four privately-owned airports are open for public use.\n\nA group of Waterloo community members are gathering signatures to put a $165 million bond question on the ballot to consolidate the west and east Waterloo high schools. The new location would expand the Waterloo Central Middle School. Middle schoolers would move to the current west and east high school buildings.\n\nThe school board will have to hold an election or dismiss the plan if the required signatures of about 2,400 are gathered by Aug.12.\n\nShelly Smith is leading the effort on the petition and is opposed to the plan.\n\nThe school board approved using SAVE state funds, so Waterloo residents won’t see a tax increase, but even so, Smith says the price of the project is too high.\n\n“We’ve been using that allocation to make repairs and maintenance repairs to our existing buildings, so while it is not costing us more—it is taking away resources that we already got planned and budgeted.”\n\nBoard members supporting the plan says updates are needed and high schoolers will have easier access to the Career Center that’s located at Central Middle School.\n\nIowa Democrats gathered under a giant inflatable IUD in Cedar Rapids to raise interest in affirming a right to contraception.\n\nAn IUD, or intrauterine device, is a t-shaped birth control device. In light of Iowa’s recent 6-week abortion ban,state Sen. Liz Bennett said codifying protections for contraception is necessary.\n\n“What we’ve seen here in Iowa is part of a national playbook of policies. And we have seen all across the nation that when elected officials say they believe in policies that quote-unquote protect life from the moment of conception, believe them.”\n\nCongress did take up a bill that would have granted a federal right to access contraception. In 2022, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst blocked the bill, saying it went to far. She has continued to oppose the legislation. She proposed counter-legislation that would incentivize manufacturers of oral birth control to file for over-the-counter approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said expanding access to sexual contraception was a priority on her legislative agenda. But it was among the few priorities that did not find support in the legislature.\n\nMonday’s press conference was put together by Americans for Contraception, a group that lobbies for wider access to birth control like IUDs and Plan B.\n\nThis fall’s presidential election was the focus of Republican gatherings in Iowa this weekend.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who hosted a campaign fundraiser in Cedar Rapids Saturday afternoon, is running for a third term in the U.S. House, but she did not focus on her Democratic opponent Sarah Corkery. Instead, Hinson told the crowd they cannot sit this presidential election out.\n\n“I think President Trump has a really great vision for the future of our country,” Hinson said. “It’s a vision that a minivan-driving mom like me — we should all be supporting this.”\n\nHinson said Vice President Kamala Harris “may be a new face” at the top of the ticket, but her policies will be the same as President Joe Biden’s.“Kamala Harris has been in lockstep with him for the last three and a half years. They’ve been trying to turn our country into a liberal wasteland with their policies,” Hinson said. “…They’re not fooling any of us. We all know what’s at stake here.”\n\nBoth of Iowa’s U.S. senators spoke at Hinson’s event. Sen. Joni Ernst told the crowd Harris was an “ineffective” member of the U.S. Senate.\n\n“Don’t let her remake herself,” Ernst said. “She is what she is and she will be a detriment to our great United States of America.”\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley told the crowd Obama campaign veterans are working for Harris.\n\n“We can’t afford two more terms of a Harris administration to be the 4th and 5th terms of the Obama administration,” Grassley said.\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird hosted an event in Adel Saturday night to raise money for her 2026 reelection campaign. During her speech at the end of the evening, Bird emphasized Trump’s need to appear in so-called battleground states where the race is close.\n\n“Here in Iowa, we will take care of turning out Iowa for President Trump and putting that in the win column, won’t we?” Bird asked a cheering crowd.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, from Ohio, was the keynote speaker at campaign fundraisers for Hinson and Rep. Randy Feenstra and Rep. Zach Nunn this weekend. Jordan, a former wrestling coach who’s co-founder the U.S. House Freedom Caucus, cautioned against overconfidence.\n\n“One of the first things they teach you when you’re a kid starting to learn to wrestle is they say: ‘Wrestle to the whistle. Don’t stop early. You keep going until you hear the whistle,'” Jordan said in Cedar Rapids Saturday afternoon. “That’s the attitude we have to have.”\n\nThe Iowa Lottery is hosting a game show on the opening day of the Iowa State Fair. Mary Neubauer, a lottery spokesperson, says the game show is a different way for people to win.\n\nOf some 67,000 people who didn’t win a prize on a state fair scratch ticket, 20 will compete on the game show.\n\n“Anybody who is on that stage will win at least $10,000, and the finalist has a chance to win up to $5 million – which my goodness, to find a time when the lottery has given away a prize of that size, you have to go back to the very earliest days of the Iowa Lottery,” Neubauer says.\n\nShe says they will also have prizes for people watching the game show.\n\n“Specifically for the people who are in the audience that day, so we’re going to have prizes for audience members,” she says.\n\nThe live game show is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. on the Grand Concourse of the Iowa State Fairgrounds on opening day, Aug 8. The contestants will gradually be eliminated through a series of games until just one remains.The last time the lottery held a live game show was in 2012, on the final day of the Iowa State Fair, and the top prize was $1 million.\n\nThe 20 people chosen to be in this year’s game show are: Craig Bergman, Cedar Rapids; Jolene Murray, Cedar Rapids; Michelle Cerwinske, Nashua; Mary Olin, Des Moines; Margo Fox, Johnston; Dawn Petersen, Colfax; Kristine Frye, Des Moines; Timothy Roberts, Ottumwa; Nicole Gulick, Des Moines; Scott Stewart, Waterloo; Ryan Habeger, Algona; Steven Stout, Indianola; Gerald Johnson, Iowa City; Christine Tatman, Orange City; Gerald Kennicker, Dubuque; Rodney Tucker, Des Moines; Tamara McMahon, Council Bluffs; Jeff Weiland, Dubuque; Steven Moore, Urbandale; David Wesley, Des Moines.(Dar Danielson, Radio Iowa)\n\nCedar Rapids is seeing growth in charter school projects in the area, including one launching later this fall with more on the way.\n\nForty-two students have already enrolled with Empowering Excellence Charter School, according to the school’s president, Sarah Swayze. The program began as a contracted service in the Cedar Rapids Community School District to help underperforming high school students finish their degrees. With some initial help from the state, the school is now going independent from the district.\n\nUnder Iowa’s charter school regulations, state dollars will flow to Swayze’s school for every student who enrolls. She said it’s an option that didn’t previously exist in the Cedar Rapids area.\n\n“We are, in essence, taking dollars from Cedar Rapids schools. But my philosophy is, if the kid’s not attending school, period, then nobody gets the dollars.”\n\nBy the end of August, Swayze aims to attract 30 more students for a total of 72.\n\nIowa Coalition for Public Charter Schools Executive Director Mike Huguelet said Empowering Excellence won’t be the last charter school to open in the area. He said a project called Cedar Rapids Prep is expected to come online next year and aims to educate 700 students.\n\nJuly turned out to be one of the rainiest months in recent decades for parts of Iowa. That includes the Des Moines area, where nearly 9 inches of rain fell last month. The normal amount of rainfall for the city in July is around 4 inches.\n\nBrad Small, lead meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Des Moines, says storms that went through last week added 3.5 inches to the total in one day.\n\n“So, we were up to 8.99 inches for the month of July in Des Moines. That made it the sixth wettest rainfall on record for July in Des Moines. So, that was pretty notable — especially with a good chunk of that falling just in one day early in the morning.”\n\nOther parts of central and southeastern Iowa also doubled their usual rain totals for the month, including Bloomfield, which recorded 10 inches for July.\n\nIt looks likely that Congress will not pass a new Farm Bill this year.\n\nThe legislative calendar is running out of days for Congress to debate a new Farm Bill, especially amid tough negotiations on food assistance and farm support programs.\n\nMost are expecting Congress to extend the 2018 Farm Bill for a second time in the lame duck session after the November elections.\n\nHowever, to Tony Hotchkiss, who leads the Agricultural and Rural Bankers Committee for the American Bankers Association, an extension isn’t the best option for farmers and ranchers — especially as they stare down a tough economy.\n\n“We need a Farm Bill that we can count on for the next five years and not something that we're doing year-to-year, because the agricultural industry is much too dynamic for a year-to-year kind of scenario.”\n\nHotchkiss said farmers need more support than what the 2018 Farm Bill can provide against today’s high input costs and low crop prices.\n\nRead more from Harvest Public Media’s Elizabeth Rembert.\n\nWhen 25-year-old Seth Bailey was near the end of his life after battling a rare cancer, he told his parents he was afraid of being forgotten. The Courage Ride is now in its 20th year of honoring his memory and raising funds for sarcoma cancer research.\n\nSarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that makes up 1% of cancer diagnoses.\n\n“When they're diagnosed with sarcoma, many times, it's the first time they've ever even heard of the word,” said Dr. Ben Miller, a board medical adviser for Courage Ride.\n\nMoney raised from the biking fundraiser goes to the UI Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. The Courage Ride has raised more than $1 million in the last two decades. The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics also host a symposium on sarcoma the day before the ride.\n\nThis year’s ride starts on the morning of Aug. 10, with cyclists pushing off from Big Grove Brewery in Iowa City and riding southwest through Johnson and Iowa counties.\n\nThe Courage Ride provides several maps, with lengths of routes ranging from 18 miles to 105 miles, so the ride is accessible for all levels of fitness. Participants can register ahead of the event online.\n\n“It keeps growing and it's all out of love for each other,” said Leora Houghton, director of the Courage Ride. “The doctors and researchers are so heartfelt. And they come and talk to the folks, the families of folks have either passed away or have been treated. And it's just, it is a huge community all based on love and respect.”\n\nRead more from Natalie Dunlap.\n\nThe leader of the union that represents state prison employees says higher pay for new prison workers is a good start, but the state should offer incentives to keep veteran prison staff from leaving.\n\n“As the union, we’re all for getting people paid what they should be, but there are employees that have worked here for ten years, 15 years, 20 years that should be getting paid more than what they are getting paid right now also,” says Todd Copley, president of AFSCME Council 61.\n\nCopley says the union’s position is that the starting pay for new workers should be the new base wage or salary for employees who work in similar positions.\n\n“You have employees that have worked at these penitentiaries for four years that are now making a shade over what a new employee has got,” Copley said.\n\nHis other concern is the signing bonuses for new employees in the Department of Corrections. Copley isn’t calling for ending those bonuses, but he said there should be a requirement that the employee stay on the job for some period of time.\n\n“There is no ‘you have to work here for five years,'” Copley said. “…There’s no stipulation to that whatsoever, so theoretically the state is stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime. It makes no sense.”\n\nCopley said retention bonuses should be considered for correctional officers with years of experience, so they don’t leave for a better paying job or choose to retire early. Copley worked in Polk County government for nearly 32 years. He was elected president of AFSCME Council 61 in July of 2023.\n\nThe Iowa DNR is inviting people to follow bird migration in real time this fall through the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. Motus is a global network of automated radio telemetry receivers and tagging projects used to track small migratory wildlife.\n\nDNR Avian Ecologist Anna Buckardt Thomas runs Motus in Iowa. She says the system tracks different species of birds, some as small as ten grams, that travel through the state on migrations stretching as far as South America.\n\n“Definitely a lot of the species we see are long-distance migrants. And because they’re so small and because they travel so far, it’s really hard to understand what they do during those long movements. So the Motus system is really helping us kind of tap into and unveil some of their secrets.”\n\nShe says when tagged birds are picked up by Motus receivers, it allows scientists to follow the migratory patterns of different species.\n\n“From those detections we’ve been able to understand, you know, certain locations seem to be getting more detections than others. We’re seeing that birds from as far away as Vancouver and British Columbia come through Iowa during fall migration period and again during spring.”\n\nThe Motus system in Iowa was built in 2021 through a grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and has grown from 19 to 25 tracking stations.\n\nThe DNR hopes to expand the Motus system to better track migrating wildlife and understand how they’re using certain corridors like the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.\n\nThe goal is to create an east-west “fence” of stations through the center of the state, and have stations running along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, maximizing the ability to detect north-south migrating wildlife and their use of the habitat corridors.\n\nLearn more and follow migrations at motus.org.\n\nMidwest farmers like Jeremiah Gebhardt are increasingly using drones to lower production costs and for their convenience. In an Iowa State University survey completed last year, 21% of farmers who responded reported using drones, and 32% said they plan on using drones in the future.\n\nDoug Houser, a digital agriculture extension specialist from Iowa State University, said farmers adopt technology that they know will ultimately help their business. More and more, he said, farmers are taking an interest in the aerial technology.Drones can allow farmers to be more precise with chemical application, preventing chemical loss and saving money, Houser said. They can also allow farmers to get into the fields when conditions wouldn’t work for a regular sprayer.\n\nDrones can also protect farmers from potential chemical exposure when spraying in the field, according to Kevin Knorr. The owner and CEO of Volitant Drone Technology Solutions in Dunbar, Nebraska, said farmers operating ground sprayers drive right through sprayed areas. This makes exposure more likely.\n\nDrones do have their shortcomings though, including short battery life and restrictions on the chemicals that they’re allowed to spray.\n\nRead more from Harvest Public Media’s Makayla Voris\n\nSince emigrating from Brazil to Nebraska in 2015, Sandro Lopes and his family have been searching for a place to build community and grow food. His business, NaTerra Regenerative Farms, is not just a food source; it is a legacy he nurtures by integrating Nebraskan and Indigenous agricultural practices.“\n\nFarming is part of my life. It takes personality,” Lopes said. “Each farm is different because the farmer has their own background. I want to follow my own path, growing food and taking care of people.”\n\nAccording to the National Center for Farmworker Health, of the approximately 2.9 million agricultural workers in the U.S., 78% are Latino and 70% were born in another country. Guarantees of work in American agriculture draw Latino non-citizens to the country under temporary work visas through initiatives like the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Worker program, which allows agricultural business owners to hire immigrants because of domestic labor shortages.\n\nNevertheless, Latino representation among farm producers — people who are involved in making decisions for a farm operation — is not as common. Lopes is one of about 83,000 Latino farm producers in the U.S. and one of approximately 700 Latino farm producers in Nebraska according to the USDA’s Agricultural Census. The number of Latino farm producers nationwide, as well as within the Midwest, has continued to grow over the past decades.\n\nBut, as Lopes found, when it comes to starting a farm or food business, many Latino immigrant farmers experience difficulty qualifying and applying for financial assistance.\n\nRead the full story from Isa Luzarraga with the Midwest Newsroom.\n\nIowa’s health department announced the boundaries of seven new behavioral health districts Thursday. It’s one of the first steps to implement a new law meant to improve access to mental health and addiction treatment.\n\nA law signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds this year requires merging Iowa’s 13 Mental Health and Disability Service regions with its 19 Integrated Provider Networks for substance use treatment.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Health and Human Services held four feedback sessions this summer to develop the boundaries of the seven new behavioral health districts.\n\nRyan Crane, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness in Iowa, said local governments may have different opinions on the map, but he believes bringing mental health and substance use services together is so important.\n\n“We just have to wait and see. But I think, overall, NAMI Iowa is hopeful and realizes that this was an important first step on the way.”\n\nNext, the state will hire nonprofits to oversee each district. The new behavioral health system is supposed to be up and running by July 1, 2025.\n\nRead more.\n\nThe University of Iowa Stanley Museum of Art has become the first North American institution to return artwork from its collection directly to the royal family of Benin in Nigeria.\n\nThe two pieces that were returned are part of a group of thousands of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes. They were stolen from the Benin Kingdom during a British invasion in 1897.\n\nPeju Layiwola, the Mellon curatorial fellow at the Stanley Museum of Art, attended a ceremony at the royal palace in Benin City to return the art to the oba, or king, of Benin.\n\n“The palace still exists. The lineage and the kings are still there. And so going to the palace of the Oba of Benin, to the very place that was sacked — that was plundered — is absolutely the right thing to do,” Layiwola said.\n\nStanley Museum Curator of African Art, Cory Gundlach, also attended the ceremony.\n\n“It's very exciting for the Stanley Museum of Art to be a leader in this particular context, and to develop a direct relationship with the royal family and the oba in particular,” Gundlach said.\n\nLayiwola made her comments Thursday on IPR’s Talk of Iowa.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nIowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said he’s concerned about what state law says about how cropland and pastures are to be restored after a hazardous liquid pipeline is built.\n\n“Nobody likes eminent domain. Nobody. But Iowa law allows for it, and Iowa law allows for it when it’s justified,” Naig said during a recent appearance on Iowa Press on Iowa PBS. “How is it determined whether it’s justified? Utilities board. Should we look at that law? I think we can. Eminent domain use should be rare. Eminent domain should be used when significant voluntary agreements are in place.”\n\nAccording to Naig, the Legislature’s priority should be establishing “guardrails” and defining terms.\n\n“I would be careful of going in and saying specifically, ‘This kind of project should or should not be allowed.’”\n\nNaig has read through the Iowa Utilities Commission decision granting a construction permit to Summit Carbon Solutions. But any eminent domain changes would be for projects proposed in the future, not the Summit pipeline. Naig said there could be “an upside” for the ethanol industry and corn growers if the pipeline is built.\n\n“Whether you like it or not, there could be an expansion signal even sent to the ethanol industry as we look at now using ethanol to make sustainable aviation fuel. If you’re going to make sustainable aviation fuel, you’ve got to lower the carbon intensity of ethanol. There are many ways to do that, but we should be looking at all the options there. So, is there potential value in this? Yes.”\n\nNaig expects lawsuits will be filed to challenge the state-issued construction permit for the pipeline, and he said there may be other things lawmakers can learn through that process.\n\nWhen school starts in less than a month, students in ten Iowa districts will go to school just four days a week.\n\nIowa Senate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, said it’s happening because of a recent change in Iowa law. It lets schools choose to calculate the required amount of classroom instruction each school year by the total number of days or 1,080 hours.\n\n“I have started the process of looking at the results,” she said during a recent appearance on Iowa Press on Iowa PBS. “We always want to know how this is impacting student achievement, how this is impacting families who utilize public schools.”\n\nOver 1,600 districts in 24 states have opted for a four-day week, and most offer child care on the other weekday. Sinclair, who is the former chair of the Senate Education Committee, said research shows parents depend upon schools for child care.\n\n“Unless the data prove us otherwise in student achievement or in a family’s ability to maintain meaningful work, I’m happy letting those local school districts make those decisions.”\n\nThere has been some pushback in other states on a four-day school week. A bill introduced in Louisiana sought to ban four-day school weeks and legislators in Missouri and Texas have considered limiting which districts can switch to four days a week.\n\nThe following Iowa school districts will have four-day weeks: Cardinal Community, East Union, Highland, Martensdale-St. Mary’s, Mormon Trail, Moulton-Udell, Murray, North Iowa, Saydel and Waco.\n\nThe Iowa Lottery now has the numbers for the final month of the fiscal year, and sales hit a record of nearly $489.9 million.\n\nLottery spokesperson Mary Neubauer said they also set a record for payouts to players of nearly $313 million.\n\n“Iowa Lottery players claimed 14 prizes of at least $500,000 during fiscal year 2024, including three prizes of $2 million.”\n\nThe lottery sales for the fiscal year that ended June 30 were 1.7% above last year. Proceeds to the state were more than $100 million.\n\n“That ended up being the Lottery’s second-best number ever in that category. So, the lottery raised almost $107 million this year for state causes.”\n\nNeubauer said the proceeds to the state fell short of a record, as scratch-off tickets were the top seller, and they have a smaller margin than other games.\n\nPowerball jackpots were a big factor in the record sales, according to Neubauer.\n\n“That game saw its jackpot top the $1 billion mark three different times in the year. That, combined with the addition of the new double-play option in that game, drove Powerball sales up almost 18% over the last year.”\n\nTwo Hy-Vee stores in Cedar Rapids led the top ten list for sales, with each topping the $1 million mark.\n\n“They’ve been at the top of the lottery’s list for a few years now. They just take great pride in their lottery sales. They know they’re at the top of the game and they want to stay there.”\n\nAnother Hy-Vee in Council Bluffs was third on the list and the Albia Road BP station in Ottumwa was fourth in sales.\n\nOn an afternoon where more than a third of the state is under a heat advisory or an excessive heat warning, participants at the Woodbury County Fair try to stay cool.\n\nKylee McDermott of Sergeant Bluff, 14, tended to her ducks at the event, which started Wednesday in Moville.\n\n“The most important thing is water. They need fresh water and make sure it’s cold,” McDermott said.\n\nTemperatures reached into the 90s with a heat index in the triple digits Wednesday afternoon.\n\nNicole Badgerow, an office administrator for the fair, said the weather is usually never fair this time of year.\n\n“Obviously, being one of the last county fairs, we kind of stick through it. And we do everything we can, and we have fans on all of the livestocks, and we go from there,” Badgerow said.\n\nEven with the higher heat, McDermott said she enjoys bringing not only her ducks, but chickens, rabbits and even pigeons to the fair.\n\n“I love it, it’s a lot of fun,” McDermott said.\n\nIowa deaths from drug overdoses and alcohol-induced causes both fell about 1% from 2021 to 2022. However, the suicide rate in Iowa increased 6%, according to a new report from Trust for America’s Health.\n\nBrandon Reavis, a senior government relations manager with the nonprofit, said suicide, alcohol and drug-related deaths remain at near historic peaks overall.\n\n“Although the report shows a slight improvement due to the dedication of our public health officials and other officials, it shows that we still have a significant amount of work left to reverse these trends.”\n\nReavis said cocaine overdoses increased by 36% in Iowa, indicating a growing level of fentanyl in supplies. The highly potent opioid can easily be fatal when laced with other drugs.\n\n“In Iowa, we see that the state legislature has not legally authorized the use of fentanyl testing strips, for example, which could help users detect the presence of fentanyl in their drug supplies and save lives.”\n\nReavis said the community distribution of the opioid-reversal drug Naloxone could also help lower drug overdose rates.\n\nThe Iowa Utilities Commission heard public comment Tuesday on draft changes to Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Rules. The process is part of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ Executive Order Number 10, which requires all state agencies to review administrative code.\n\nMany of the comments came from people who oppose Summit Carbon Solutions’ CO2 pipeline project, which the IUC approved in June.\n\nJess Mazour is the conservation coordinator with the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club.\n\n“I think the Iowa Utilities Commission should use this opportunity [to] listen to the experts who are the people who have gone through this process for the last three years. We have first-hand experience of where the process has worked and has not worked.”\n\nMazour, along with multiple landowners and the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, asked the IUC to expand its definition of an “affected person.”\n\nThis would allow more people, like farm tenants and neighbors, to participate in hearings before the commission decides whether to issue a pipeline permit.\n\nAfter the IUC considers written and oral comments, a draft of the rules with any updates will be posted online. The IUC will then host two public hearings before moving into the rule adoption stage.\n\nAn advocate for Ukrainian immigrants said there have been new challenges in trying to bring refugees to Iowa.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, Martha Hulshof of Ireton has helped about 150 Ukrainians get out of the country through her sister, who is a missionary in western Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, the process took a couple of months. Now, some are still waiting more than six months to find out if and when they can come to Sioux County in northwest Iowa.\n\nHulshof said she isn’t being told why there’s been a delay, but it is putting lives at risk.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking what is going on over there. It's war. And people forget, since we don't see on the news anymore, what war’s really like with all the death and torture.”\n\nHulshof said flooding in northwest Iowa has compounded the issue.\n\n“The situation here is hard, and it's just that much harder to find houses and vehicles when people here have lost so much, too.”\n\nHulshof said she is looking for northwest Iowans to open their homes to Ukrainian refugees.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Iowa could see multiple rounds of storms through Wednesday.\n\nPeter Rogers is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls. He said straight-line winds with speeds up to 70 mph caused significant tree damage in Sioux City Monday night.\n\n“The environment really hasn't changed a whole lot from last night. So, there's the potential for additional severe thunderstorms and the primary threats with those thunderstorms, especially as they move into Iowa, would be those strong damaging winds. Could still see some hail and perhaps an isolated tornado or two. But the primary threat and the primary concern right now are those winds.”\n\nRight after the storm hit, about 7,000 MidAmerican Energy customers in Sioux City lost power. More than 650 are still without power as of Tuesday afternoon. There were still some outages in Des Moines, Fort Dodge and Storm Lake.\n\nIowa is also facing an excessive heat warning for counties in the southwest part of the state. The heat index on Wednesday is expected to top 100° for most of the state.\n\nUnion Pacific crews are cleaning up the site of a train derailment in Carroll County.\n\nA Union Pacific spokesperson said about 36 cars derailed Monday night, about two miles east of Glidden. No injuries were reported and an investigation into the incident is underway.\n\nRural Glidden resident Connie Bock said she and her husband have lived about a quarter-mile from the tracks for more than 40 years. They are used to hearing all different kinds of train noise, but this was something else entirely.\n\n“We were just watching the Olympics and usually we’ve got a lot of semis and water trailers going by for spring. They make a lot of noise, but this noise kept going and getting louder and then we could feel it in the house. I decided to go out and look and I came running in and I said, ‘Should I call the police? The train has derailed.'”\n\nBock said the noise of the derailment lasted over a minute.\n\nThe derailed cars were not carrying any hazardous materials, but that was not immediately apparent to the Bocks, so they were concerned.\n\nThe focus now for Union Pacific is to get the main line operational as quickly as possible. It is not clear how long that may take, but they typically have blocked lines up and running within a few days.\n\nA Des Moines police officer is in serious but stable condition in a local hospital as he recovers from a gunshot wound that appears to have come from a fellow officer.\n\nThe shooting happened as Des Moines police tried to arrest a man wanted for violating a no contact order.\n\nIn a short car chase with police, the suspect lost control and ran from his vehicle. Des Moines Police Department spokesperson Sergeant Paul Parizek said body camera footage shows the man turned and pointed a handgun at two officers who were chasing him on foot.\n\nParizek said both officers opened fire. The 45-year-old suspect was shot and killed.\n\nOne officer also hit his colleague in the back of his right shoulder. The bullet hit a gap in his body armor.\n\nParizek said the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating the incident as an officer-involved shooting.\n\nTwo people were injured in a building explosion and fire in the Iowa City area Monday night.\n\nThe North Liberty Fire Department received a call around 11 p.m. with a report of an explosion with injuries in a commercial building on the city’s west side.\n\nFirefighters arrived to find the sprinkler system activated and multiple overhead doors hanging off the building. One wall was bowed out and the roof had lifted from the building.\n\nFirst responders found one victim with burns. According to a release from the city, that person was treated at the scene and transported to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. A firefighter was also transported to UIHC and later discharged.\n\nFire departments from Coralville and Solon helped extinguish the fire. The state fire marshal is assisting with the investigation into the cause of the explosion.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said the portable classrooms being set up for students in Rock Valley will have a different use once repairs to the community’s flood-damaged schools are completed.\n\n“The entire schools, both public and private, were wiped out — the K-12. So, we found a temporary classroom that we believe, when we’re done, we’ll be able to set up and use them for child care facilities in some of our rural areas, too. So, we found a dual purpose.”\n\nWhile the vast majority of direct government assistance for Iowa flood victims is coming from the federal government, Reynolds said an agreement among states is filling a few gaps. It’s called the Emergency Management Assistance Compact.\n\n“We’ve had electricians come in from some of the states just to help.”\n\nAt least 5,000 homes in Iowa have been damaged by tornadoes and flooding this spring and summer. State officials say 2,000 homes have been completely destroyed.\n\nA new site in the basement of a Cedar Rapids school is serving breakfast and lunch to children and adults alike. The project results from Linn County, the City of Cedar Rapids and Teamsters Local 238 allocating money after Hy-Vee pulled out of their Wellington Heights neighborhood.\n\nEric Gutschmidt, president of the neighborhood association, said he was proud of local leaders for putting the funding to work during an emergency.\n\n“Some folks would mistake this as being a free market issue. And I don't think that it is. I do think that the government and the people — we the people — have a responsibility for ourselves, for each other and for our neighbors. And I think that’s what this is really about.”\n\nThe meal site will run until Aug. 16, a week before school starts. City leaders are actively looking into how to replace the now-closed grocery store.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nResearchers at Iowa State University estimate the U.S. pork industry lost more than $1 billion per year between 2016 and 2020 due to a viral disease. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) can be deadly for pigs. It can also reduce a sow’s ability to give birth to healthy piglets.\n\nDerald Holtkamp, a professor in veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine at ISU, led the analysis.\n\nHoltkamp said it’s hard to stay ahead of the PRRS virus because it mutates quickly, making it difficult to develop vaccines.\n\n“Several times we thought we had the PRRS virus kind of sorted out. We thought we had solutions to control it, and within a few years, we are made to look stupid again. It just has this ability to continually evolve.”\n\nResearchers say the economic impact in 2020 was 80% higher than it was a decade ago, mostly due to higher rates of pig herds getting infected and poorer productivity in infected herds.\n\nHoltkamp said heightened biosecurity is the best way to prevent the spread of disease and minimize losses. That includes taking extra precautions, like sanitizing livestock trailers.\n\nTruckers and farmers in Iowa could see changes in the price and availability of biodiesel next year. At issue are tax credits scheduled to be phased out under the federal Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nIowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks is co-sponsoring a bill to extend one of those credits, which goes to producers and retailers that blend biodiesel with regular diesel.\n\nDelia Meier, senior vice president of Iowa-80 Truck Stop in Walcott, where they blend biodiesel with regular diesel, said the credit is needed because biodiesel is more expensive and corrosive than regular diesel.\n\n“Without that credit, there’s no reason for us to do biodiesel, you know, to blend it […] It’s not like people are dying to get biodiesel. They buy it because it’s cheaper.”\n\nMeier said Iowa-80 recently replaced most of their blending equipment at a cost of $600,000.\n\nUnder a new Clean Fuel Production Credit scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, 2025, biodiesel blenders would likely receive far less than the $1 per gallon they currently get.\n\nMeier said this would make biodiesel more expensive than regular diesel, and truckers wouldn’t buy it. Iowa also has a $0.05 per gallon Biodiesel Production and Blending tax credit.\n\n“All of the major truck stops that are selling a lot of diesel are blending in Iowa. And so, I think Iowans should be very happy. I think the biodiesel industry should be very happy. Farmers should be happy. There’s not a better model than what is happening in Iowa for biodiesel.”\n\nChristina Bohannan, a Democratic candidate for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District seat, is pinning Iowa’s strict new abortion law on Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks.\n\nThe law bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, when many are not aware they are pregnant. Bohannan said she believes most Iowans do not realize that their access to abortions changed Monday morning.\n\n“Every woman is different and every pregnancy is different. You cannot legislate every pregnancy and every situation. But Rep. Miller-Meeks either doesn’t get that or she just doesn’t care.”\n\nMiller-Meeks has celebrated the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision to overturn a federal right to an abortion two years ago, but she was already in the U.S. Congress when the Iowa Legislature passed the new abortion restriction. Her campaign did not respond to calls for comment.\n\nBohannan said, if elected, she would work in Congress to put Roe v. Wade-era abortion protections into federal law, returning abortion access to states like Iowa.\n\nWide areas of Iowa saw heavy showers overnight and early Monday morning, with more than 4 inches of rain falling in some areas. But the big weather story this week is likely the heat.\n\nMeteorologist Brooke Hagenhoff at the National Weather Service said some steamy, sticky days are ahead.\n\n“This afternoon [Monday], southern Iowa is going to see heat indices exceeding 100 to 105 degrees. By Tuesday and Wednesday, we’re expecting that to move into central and parts of northern Iowa, with widespread heat indices over 100. Southern Iowa could see 110, maybe pushing even higher on both Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons.”\n\nHeat advisories and watches are being posted for wide sections of the state, but Hagenhoff said the heat should ease within a few days.\n\n“We’re looking at temperatures maybe starting to cool a bit Thursday and Friday after some thunderstorms push through. On Wednesday, that will kind of push those temperatures back down. Still warm, but maybe more of the normal late July/early August warmth that we’re used to seeing, with upper 80s and low 90s likely across a large portion of the area.”\n\nMore than 20 southern Iowa counties are under a heat advisory lasting until 8 p.m. Monday night. Harrison and Shelby counties are under an extreme heat watch from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday evening.\n\nA large eastern Iowa facility that makes ketchup and other condiments failed for more than two years to monitor contaminants in the more than 1 million gallons of untreated wastewater it discharged into a creek each day, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n\nKraft Heinz Foods Company recently agreed to pay an $8,000 fine for the violations at its Muscatine location. It uses municipal water to cool its equipment and discharges it along with stormwater into Mad Creek, which flows for less than a mile to the Mississippi River.\n\nThe DNR documented more than 20 violations of pollution limits for the wastewater from 2017 to 2020 and issued a violation notice to the company in November 2020. There was often too much chlorine in the water, and it otherwise had the potential to excessively limit the amount of oxygen in the creek water. The facility also had failed to test for contaminants as frequently as required.\n\nThe department is not aware of any obvious environmental effects from those violations, such as fish kills, said Caroline Harmening, an environmental specialist for the DNR who investigated the situation.\n\nDespite the department’s notice to remedy the violations, less than two months later the facility apparently ceased all monitoring of the wastewater, DNR records show. The department discovered the lack of monitoring during a routine inspection in February 2024.\n\nThe company was able to provide some testing data starting from August 2023 but none prior to that going back to January 2021.\n\n“Prior to August 2023, the data is inconclusive due to personnel changeover in the plant and technological difficulties with the controller on the flow meter,” Kraft Heinz said in a letter to the DNR in March 2024.\n\nThe company further said it “believes the measures it has taken in its stormwater system have adequately addressed the alleged violations.”\n\nHarmening said she is not aware of any further wastewater violations at the facility since that letter. It’s unclear whether there were violations in the preceding years.\n\n“Since we don’t have any data, we don’t know if they did or by how much they might have exceeded different limits,” Harmening said.\n\nThe U.S. Surgeon General is urging Congress to pass legislation requiring warning labels on social media. The idea is gaining traction among some mental health professionals in Iowa who treat teenagers.\n\nJeff Reiland, a child and family therapist with Gundersen Health System, said a host of studies confirm that too much social media can poison a child’s well-being.\n\n“The problem has been getting worse, and there’s a growing body of knowledge that really helps confirm more and more of our concerns that when kids are exposed to too much social media, they experience symptoms of depression and anxiety.”\n\nHe said there have long been concerns among parents, school leaders and mental health professionals about the impact social media is having on America’s youth.\n\n“Teenagers average about five hours of social media time every day, and we know it is a big part, or a contributing factor, to problems kids are having with anxiety and depression. When kids have more than three hours of social media time, they are twice as likely to experience depression.”\n\nRieland said putting a warning label on social media won’t magically fix the problem, but it may be a good first step.\n\n“Past efforts at creating warning labels on things like tobacco products and alcohol can raise public awareness. It can help people to recognize, ‘Oh, this is a serious thing.’ It’s so big that we need to warn you that this is a concern, that this could cause problems for your child if used in excess.”\n\nA potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris was in Iowa over the weekend. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called on Iowa Democrats to tap into the energy behind the Harris campaign.\n\nBeshear was reelected to a second term in a state where Republicans hold supermajorities in the General Assembly. Iowa Democrats face a similar challenge: Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office.\n\nAt the Liberty and Justice Celebration in Des Moines, Beshear told Iowa Democrats they can make up ground by putting effort into issues that directly impact voters’ lives.\n\n“I mean, when people wake up in the morning, they're not thinking about their political party. They're not thinking about the polls. They're thinking about their job and whether they make enough to support their family. They're thinking about the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents or their kids.”\n\nBeshear said he’s “honored” to be under consideration as Harris’ running mate. He called her tough, smart and kind, and said he is not surprised the party has quickly embraced her as their likely presidential nominee.\n\nThe Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club has submitted a petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asking to remove a state agency’s authority to enforce the Clean Water Act.\n\nThe Sierra Club claims that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources has failed to enforce the federal law for years.\n\nThe petition says that over 450 cattle feeding and industrial operations throughout the state are dumping waste into Iowa waterways despite expired permits.\n\nWally Taylor, the legal chair for Iowa’s Sierra Club chapter, says the DNR has also failed to prioritize protecting the state’s highest-quality rivers and streams. He says while DNR funding has gone down over the years, he believes failure to enforce the Clean Water Act has been deliberate.\n\n“Over the years it’s been a lack of will, and in the past few years, I think a definite intent not to enforce the Clean Water Act.”\n\nWaste permits must be renewed once every five years.\n\nAbout a dozen Iowa firefighters are helping battle wildfires in other states — across the Rocky Mountains, on the West Coast and in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRyan Harr, supervisor of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ Fire Program, says the department has dispatched Iowans to help extinguish dangerous flareups in California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Wyoming — and one crew just returned from fighting wildfires in South Dakota.\n\nIowa is also dispatching EMTs and logistical planners to points west. Most of their assignments are for two weeks and Harr says it can be both grueling and rewarding.\n\n“They’re long, hot days. They do train for it. There is a rigorous national standard of physical fitness that folks have to meet to be deployed on a national assignment.”\n\nWhile Iowa has gotten a reprieve from several years of drought with heavy rain in recent months, Harr says the western U.S. has seen just the opposite. After a year or two of generally wet conditions, he says much of the region is drying out rapidly this summer.\n\nHarr says the DNR will continue to support its federal partners by providing firefighters and support staff throughout the summer and early fall.\n\nEvery year, Harr says the DNR certifies about ten of its own staff and another 35 Iowans from partner agencies, volunteer fire departments and other organizations to be available for national fire incident assignments.\n\nThe Ankeny-based Casey’s convenience store chain has announced the acquisition of 198 stores, including 148 in Texas and 50 in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi.\n\nCasey’s is purchasing the CEFCO convenience stores for $1.145 billion.\n\n“This acquisition will quickly expand Casey’s presence in Texas, a very attractive market for Casey’s. In addition, we’ll be able to expand our footprint further into the South as well,” Casey’s CEO Darin Rebelez said on a conference call for investors.\n\nCasey’s had already owned 22 stores in Texas and will have 2,900 stores overall once the acquisition is complete.\n\nFikes Wholesale owns the stores and Rebelez says they will fit well with their operation.\n\n”Acquisitions this size and strategic fit do not come along very often. And we seize the opportunity to add these large, high quality stores to our network. The fit between Fikes and Casey’s is outstanding.”\n\nHe says the Texas stores are mostly in smaller towns in the Dallas to San Antonio to Houston triangle. The Florida stores are mainly in the panhandle area.\n\nCEFCO is known for its chicken, and Rebelez says they plan to remodel the kitchens to bring in Casey’s pizza.\n\n“CEFCO has done a really nice job of building their own food business and they have kitchens and a lot of their stores, so that should make the integration process go a little smoother for us. But still we see that as our biggest synergy. Fuel it’d be the next largest synergy that we have.”\n\nCEFCO also has a fuel terminal that is included in the agreement.\n\nRebelez says the plan is to put the Casey’s name on the stores. The acquisition should be completed by the end of the year.\n\nPlanned Parenthood clinics say they are preparing for Iowa’s new abortion law to go into effect on Monday.\n\nThe law will ban abortion as early as six weeks of pregnancy, when cardiac activity is detected, which is before many people know they’re pregnant. It has exceptions for rape, incest, life threatening conditions and fetal abnormalities that are fatal.\n\nSarah Traxler, the chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood North Central States, says the new law not only affects Iowans, but those seeking abortion care in some surrounding states.\n\n“This is going to have pretty resounding impacts on the region itself, especially the Midwest in the South. So I imagine we will be seeing people from Missouri in Omaha and Minnesota.”\n\nAlex Sharp, who oversees the Planned Parenthood clinic in Ames, says the clinic has been scheduling extra abortion appointments this week and calling people with appointments who won’t make the new law’s cutoff to come in earlier.\n\n“I would say 30% of the people I talked to on the phone told me that they can't get off work this week… I'm already scheduled for work this week. And I can't find day care.”\n\nPlanned Parenthood says it’s expanding abortion care in clinics in Minnesota and Nebraska and will have patient navigators to help Iowans who are past the state’s new cutoff get appointments in other states.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Title IX rules prohibit discrimination in education based on sexual orientation and gender identity, not just based on sex.\n\nIowa joined a lawsuit challenging the rules and a judge has temporarily blocked them from taking effect on Aug. 1.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds says she’s proud to be part of the lawsuit challenging the rules, and that she’s doing it to protect women’s rights. If the rules take effect, Iowa could lose federal education funding because of its law requiring people to use school bathrooms that match their sex assigned at birth.\n\nDamian Thompson with Iowa Safe Schools says the injunction isn’t final, as Title IX challenges are likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“While it may seem like a disappointing decision, and it certainly is, we are thankful here in the state to at least right now have plenty of other protections available for LGBTQ students.”\n\nThe Title IX changes were not expected to affect Iowa’s ban on transgender women and girls competing in female sports.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nRep. Ashley Hinson has introduced legislation designed to help law enforcement at all levels better handle Chinese trade violations.\n\nThe bipartisan bill would reportedly take an all-encompassing approach to dealing with the Chinese Communist Party’s intellectual theft and trade-related violations.\n\nThe bill includes setting up a specialized task force within the Department of Justice and better equipping local law enforcement to respond to violations.\n\nAbout $20 million would be set aside for the DOJ to start the process.\n\nDuring her weekly media call Thursday, the Republican congressperson said the first round of funding could just be a first step in determining the extent of the problem.\n\n“It may be something that we’ll have to revisit in a year, $20 million may not be enough to target this. We may just need to get a gauge on how many of these cases they’re able to go after.”\n\nGroups supporting the legislation include the U.S. Steel Workers, National Council of Textile Organizations and the American Shrimp Processing Association.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst is among a bipartisan group of lawmakers urging the federal government to take immediate action to finalize rules for a tax credit for biofuels producers.\n\nThe credit, known as 45Z, will take the place of other credits that expire at the end of September. To get the new credit, farmers and biofuel producers have to implement practices that reduce the carbon score of their products.\n\nMonte Shaw, head of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said the industry is seeking a “safe harbor” provision that would give them more time to implement those practices and incorporate others.\n\nIf the rules aren’t finalized soon, Shaw said biodiesel production could shut down by the end of the year.\n\n“We really need the safe harbor going into place by September so that people can be sourcing feedstock, shipping it to the plants, preparing it, doing what we call pre-treatment so it’s ready to go. And we would be seamless into January.”\n\nLawmakers also want the U.S. Department of the Treasury to limit eligibility for the tax credit to domestic biofuel producers.\n\nDisability Rights Iowa has worked on issues like ensuring access to public accommodations and voting. More recently, DRI has filed lawsuits to improve children’s mental health care and to stop the use of certain punishments at the Boys State Training School in Eldora.\n\nCatherine Johnson, executive director of Disability Rights Iowa, says job accommodations, access to medical care and a lack of long term support for people to live in their communities continue to be major issues.\n\n“There is no one specific issue that I think faces Iowans with disabilities. It’s many of the same issues we have been addressing for years in and years out.”\n\nShe says within the next 40 years, she wants the nonprofit to have strong relationships in each of the state’s 99 counties.\n\n“We take it very seriously that we are here for all Iowans with disabilities, which is essentially almost 400,000 Iowans identify as having a disability. We want to be known to every single Iowan with a disability so that they know we are the place that they can come to for help and support.”\n\nThe group is celebrating its legacy with the 40-34 Equal Access Festival this Saturday in Des Moines, that’ll also recognize the 34th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Johnson made her comments this Wednesday on IPR’s Talk of Iowa.Listen to the podcast.\n\nA new report shows nonprofit organizations across the region are facing severe workforce shortages, and potential solutions revolve around boosting salaries and benefits.\n\nAnne Hindery is CEO of the Omaha-based Nonprofit Association of the Midlands which surveyed the leaders of nearly 700 nonprofits in Iowa and Nebraska.\n\nHindery says it’s always been a challenge finding and keeping qualified people, and it’s only gotten worse since the pandemic.\n\n“We’re still seeing shortages in things like behavioral health therapists, childcare workers, accountants that understand nonprofit accounting — those are still some of the challenges that we’re seeing. So I think the Salary and Benefits Report really helps educate nonprofits on what they need to do to attract and retain talent.”\n\nThe report finds the average yearly turnover rate among nonprofits in the two states is 29%, while most open positions are filled in less than two months.\n\nThe report finds most nonprofits match market compensation and almost all of them post salaries in job listings. Hindery says it also found that almost all nonprofits granted salary increases of 3% or higher last year and plan to do so again this year. In addition, it shows 42% of surveyed nonprofits offer bonuses.\n\n“I firmly believe that if we’re going to attract smart people to the nonprofit sector, we better pay them enough to pay off their student loans, give them benefits and flexibility. That is, as a membership organization for nonprofits, we try to help our members do just that.”\n\nShe confesses that some charitable organizations face the stigma that working for them means you’ll pull down a very meager salary.\n\n“That is an urban legend, that nonprofits mean no money. It just means our profits go back into the organization and into our people to better serve our clients, as opposed to going to shareholders like it does in private corporations. It’s a meaningful mission, and so you can go to work every day and whether you’re in direct service or not, you are making a difference in your community, and I think that’s very attractive to people.”\n\nThe board of a northwest Iowa community college has accepted a settlement with ten students from Brazil who accused the school of human trafficking.\n\nWestern Iowa Tech Community College in Sioux City will pay $2.3 million to settle a lawsuit involving ten students from Brazil.\n\nCollege President Terry Murrell talked to reporters after a special board meeting Wednesday afternoon and took full responsibility for the program's problems.\n\n“We got too deep into something we were not overly familiar with, and we didn’t do a good job. And not doing a good job certainly had implications to those students. And, to those students, I would say, ‘We wish you luck and hope you are able to pursue your education and career goals.”’\n\nMurrell thought the program would have success like others at the school when it was launched in 2019.\n\n“The J-1 Program is complex, it’s complicated, and I don’t think we appreciated that when we stepped in, and all of that is my fault.”\n\nIn April, the college’s board of directors approved paying $3 million to students from Chile who filed a lawsuit in 2020. The students said they were promised a free two-year program with internships but were instead forced into working manual labor jobs to pay off tuition. Murrell disputed that claim, saying the students were free to leave at any time and were paid for every hour they worked, plus free tuition and other amenities.\n\nA new proposed rule from the Biden administration is aimed at helping protect millions of workers from extreme heat. It’s expected to reach 36 million employees across the U.S., including agricultural workers.\n\nHeat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S. and the proposed rule is meant to reduce heat injuries, illnesses and deaths in the workplace. The rule would have employers make a heat illness and injury prevention plan including requirements for drinking water, rest breaks and control of indoor heat.\n\nScott Blubaugh, president of American Farmers and Ranchers and the Oklahoma Farmers Union, says the rule is good common sense and includes practices he uses on his farm anyway.\n\n“You know, the devil's in the details, of course, but I didn't see anything that would give me any worry about the rule.”\n\nBut the president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau says the organization doesn’t like a one-size-fits-all approach and that many operators are already taking measures.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation says it’s still analyzing the proposed rule and engaging with members to form the organization’s comment to the proposal.\n\nRead the full story from Harvest Public Media's Anna Pope.\n\nHigh water from the Rock River heavily damaged the Lyon County Fairgrounds in Rock Rapids. As a result, the fair’s livestock show was moved about 25 miles away to the Osceola Fairgrounds in Sibley.\n\nLori Rens, the secretary of the Lyon County Fair Board, was grateful the space could accommodate the event.\n\n“They ran their fair last week, so many of their fair board members and livestock superintendents are staying a second week to help us out. Words can’t express how appreciative we are that they opened their home to us.”\n\nOrganizers and participants are learning how to navigate a new space after flooding nearly destroyed the Lyon County Fairgrounds in Rock Rapids.\n\n“County and state fairs aren’t about winning, they’re all about learning,” says 16-year-old Dylan Mulder of George, who shows his chickens during the Lyon County Fair.\n\nThe livestock show wraps up Thursday in Sibley. The Lyon County Fair plans to hold a street dance fundraiser back in Rock Rapids on Friday night to help repair the fairgrounds and racetrack for next year's fair.\n\nOne month after devastating flooding struck the northwest Iowa community of Rock Valley, the mayor said some residents will have to make a tough decision: whether they will stay or go.\n\nRock Valley Mayor Kevin Van Otterloo said cleanup has been going well after water poured out of the Rock River on June 22, submerging the ground level of homes and imploding foundations on the north side of town.\n\nThe challenge now is housing, as there was already a critical need before flooding hit the town of 4,000 people.\n\nVan Otterloo said FEMA is still assessing the damage to determine what financial help will be available for residents impacted the most.\n\n“The major concern is, do I put money back in this house, or are you going to buy me out? We can’t answer that question yet. We keep telling them, ‘It’s your house. Even if there’s a buyout offered, you don’t have to take it. You can still stay there, it’s your property.’”\n\nVan Otterloo said that soon, temporary housing, campers and mobile homes will be set up for an estimated 150 households that can no longer live in their homes due to substantial or unrepairable damage.\n\nThousands of RAGBRAI riders stopped in Greenfield on Tuesday just two months after a tornado devastated the town.\n\nCyclists rode past homes destroyed by the May 21 tornado that killed four people and injured dozens. It looked like any other RAGBRAI meeting town — full of people in bike shorts lining up at food tents and resting in the shade.\n\nGreenfield resident Mackenzie Meisenheimer said right after the tornado it wasn’t clear if the town would still be able to host RAGBRAI. But she said Greenfield got a lot of support, and volunteers worked hard to make it happen.\n\n“It’s a good thing we had RAGBRAI though because it gave us a reason to clean up. It gave us a reason to get ourselves together a little bit and something to look forward to. Having people here, looking at what’s left of our awesome town, I mean, we have so much left that’s still here and beautiful.”\n\nRAGBRAI rider Dana Kramer of Urbandale said the bike route took her past part of town that was in the tornado’s path. She said it looked pretty good and that Greenfield did a lot of clean up in two months.\n\n“I thought I would see a little bit more of the devastation from the storm, but they’ve gotten pretty much everything torn down. And they’ve started the rebuilding processes. Some houses are still boarded up, but I think it shows the strength of the city in wanting to get things back to normal and continue to host RAGBRAI.”\n\nShe was heading into the main square, which wasn’t hit by the tornado. Kramer and others said they are happy to spend money there to help Greenfield’s economy.\n\nRead more.\n\nA survey by the Iowa Brewers Guild finds Iowa breweries generated a total economic impact of $1.25 billion from operations, trade and tourism in 2022 — a big increase from the $245 million impact in 2020.\n\nBrewers Guild Executive Director Noreen Otto said the industry has breweries operating in 82 Iowa communities and continues to grow and mature. She pointed to breweries evolving into multipurpose and multigenerational entertainment venues.\n\n“They’re welcoming for so many different occasions. I joke I’ve been to a book club at a brewery, I’ve been to a baby shower at a brewery, I’ve been to a PTA meeting at a brewery. And so they’re really becoming these important community gathering spaces.”\n\nShe said there have been changes in laws and regulations that have helped the industry grow, especially after the economic strain of pandemic.\n\n“This last session we expanded the ability of a brewery to pour at a festival, which gives a little more of local flavor to these events around the state of Iowa that you see, especially all summer long. And I think continuing to change the environment to be more supportive of craft brewing and allow more flexibility for the small business owners will help us to remain stable going forward.”\n\nThe state has approximately 150 breweries with a workforce of around 7,200 employees for direct operations, and total employment throughout the supply chain of 14,448 jobs.\n\nOtto said there is still room for more growth.\n\n“The economic impact study projected continued growth, almost another 9% increase in jobs are expected and a projection of continued growth about 17% in total economic output. I think we’re gonna see that as we legislatively allow access to more markets for breweries as they continue to mature and continue to grow their product lines.”\n\nOne of the recent areas of growth has been partnerships with colleges and universities that includes supporting funding of name image and likeness collectives.\n\nThe Iowa Brewers Guild is a nonprofit trade association of professional brewers of beer and cider in Iowa.\n\nIowans are being warned to use extreme caution when taking weight loss drugs they bought online because they either can’t afford or can’t find FDA-approved medications like Ozempic.\n\nMarisa Pruitt, a registered dietician with the Gundersen Health System, said there is a lot of buzz about these so-called “miracle weight loss drugs,” and taking them without a doctor’s close guidance may be very risky.\n\n“There are definitely shortages. The demand for these drugs has outpaced the quantity and supply, so it’s very difficult to get Ozempic or Wegovy for weight loss. They’re the same medicine, but it’s very difficult to get that medicine right now.”\n\nWhen there are shortages, Pruitt said what’s known as “compounded” drugs will frequently appear on the market, and it’s often unclear exactly what is in them. She said cheaper doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a better buy.\n\n“The brand of this drug is probably around $1,000 a month — so that can be very limiting for many people — versus the compounded medicines are being sold for a fraction of that. So very appealing in that sense.”\n\nSome of the medications that are being purchased online may in fact work, but Pruitt said any money you might be saving is at the sacrifice of important supervision, which could put your health in jeopardy.\n\nShe said patients should undergo a thorough medical evaluation before any weight loss drugs are prescribed.\n\nIowa Democrats are backing Vice President Kamala Harris following President Joe Biden’s decision to not seek a second term.\n\nOn Monday, 40 delegates met virtually to decide what would happen next. Biden’s big announcement meant Iowa’s delegates were committed but without a candidate.\n\nIn the closed-door meeting, party chair Rita Hart asked the room if Iowa’s delegates were unanimous about pledging support for Harris. And the room was all-in.\n\nDavenport’s Adam Peters is a delegate who was involved in whipping votes for Joe Biden before the president dropped out over the weekend. He said the room was enthusiastic.\n\n“Like I said, we’re Iowans. We’ve all supported so many different campaigns in the last four years before we all unified behind Joe Biden. We’ve all seen her [Harris] up close. We know how candid, how vibrant, how smart and intelligent she is.”\n\nBefore becoming vice president, Harris ran in the 2020 Iowa caucuses but dropped out before caucus day.\n\nEven with many delegates pledging their support, Harris still has to secure the party nomination by delegate vote. That date has not been announced.\n\nAn ISU Extension economist says the price of farmland is expected to fall this year in Iowa. Prices averaged a record $11,835 an acre in 2023, according to ISU Extension’s annual farmland value survey.\n\nRabail Chandio, who leads the survey at ISU Extension, said there are two factors that will drive land values down: one is high interest rates, and the other is commodity prices.\n\n“We expect crop prices to be slightly lower. We expect yields to be very high, but our demand is not there to accommodate all that great production that we’re expecting for this crop year.”\n\nCreighton economist Ernie Goss predicted Iowa farmland prices would drop by around 3.8% in 2024. Chandio did not commit to a specific number because of uncertainties with the weather. She said the Federal Reserve could still drop interest rates this year, but it will probably come too late to affect land prices before 2025.\n\nFarm field drainage failure leads to creek contamination, dead fish\n\nUnderground drainage tiling apparently failed and formed a sinkhole in a corn field in northwest Iowa that allowed manure to flow into a creek, where it killed small fish for miles, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe manure came from Roorda Dairy west of Paullina, which has about 4,200 dairy cattle, DNR records show. The dairy was irrigating a field with manure and didn’t notice the damaged tile line because of standing corn, said Tom Roos, a senior environmental specialist for the department.\n\n“With all these rain events, a tile line must have burst,” he said.\n\nPaullina is in O’Brien County in far northwest Iowa, parts of which have suffered from severe flooding in recent weeks. The pressure from influxes of water into tile drains can cause weak areas to rupture, after which soil can flow into the tiling and create a sinkhole.\n\nOn July 17 someone noticed dead fish in nearby Mud Creek and reported it to state law enforcement. A DNR investigation found that the manure had been flowing into the creek through the drainage tiling and killed fish along about nine miles of the stream, until it met another creek.\n\nIt’s unclear how many gallons of manure might have spilled into the creek and how many fish it killed, Roos said. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe dairy promptly plugged a culvert to prevent more manure from reaching the creek, Roos said. He did not know how long the spill had occurred.\n\nRoorda Dairy paid a $5,000 fine to the DNR in 2022 for starting construction on a manure digester without state approval. Digesters use bacteria to consume the manure and emit flammable gases such as methane that can be used to heat or power farm operations.\n\nConstruction will resume soon on the new bridge over the Mississippi River at Lansing. Work was suspended in early June due to high water levels and eventually flooding.\n\nPete Hjelmstad, a field service coordinator for the Iowa DOT, said cleanup needs to be done before work on the bridge can restart.\n\n“The problem is their construction yard — the area that they use for staging equipment — on the south side, as well as the construction area for the piers and abutments on the Wisconsin side of the river. They’re going to have to get in there and clean it up because it’s going to be full of debris and everything.”\n\nHigh water levels also delayed construction on the new Iowa Highway 3 bridge over the Cedar River in Waverly. Originally targeted to start July 8, Hjelmstad said that project is now slated to begin Aug. 1.\n\nThe Des Moines City Council heard public comments Monday morning for and against proposed city ordinances affecting the city’s unhoused population. One new law would ban sleeping in public spaces.\n\nAfter the special meeting, Mayor Connie Boesen discussed the other measure, which would limit how long homeless camps can stand.\n\n“Well, we voted on the first reading of our new ordinances on how we are going to shorten the time frame on homele"
