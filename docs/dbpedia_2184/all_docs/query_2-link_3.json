        "text": "Even the best classic-rock lyrics don't necessarily bear stand-alone scrutiny. Rock critic Robert Chrisgau memorably noted that Bob Dylan's \"My Back Pages\" was \"a bad poem. But it is a good song, supported by a memorable refrain.\"\n\nUnfortunately, even Bob Dylan has a bad day. He's not alone in that, as some of the genre's biggest names find a home on our list of Classic Rock's 20 Worst Lyrics. Some are bad poetry, while others spark head-scratching confusion. Still others are just plain wrong.\n\nOf course, bad lines are sometimes deliberately included, as with Alice Cooper in \"School's Out\": \"We got no principles; we ain't got no innocence. We can't even think of a word that rhymes.\" We've left those aside in favor of far more dubious entries in a countdown of Classic Rock's 20 Worst Lyrics:\n\nNo. 20: Van Halen, \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"\n\nFrom: Women and Children First (1980)\n\nThe lyric: \"Ya take a moople-ah, wookie pah-a moopie,\" maybe?\n\nDavid Lee Roth was apparently supposed to sing something that resembled \"I've seen a lot of people take a ride on a moonbeam,\" but he forgot the line. Not sure why they left it in.\n\nNo. 19. Poison, \"Unskinny Bop\"\n\nFrom: Flesh & Blood (1990)\n\nThe lyric: \"Unskinny bop bop bop bop, she just loves to play – unskinny bop, nothin' more to say.\"\n\nBut is there really nothing more to say?\n\nNo. 18. Pink Floyd, \"Bike\"\n\nFrom: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)\n\nThe lyric: \"I know a mouse and he hasn't got a house. I don't know why I call him Gerald.\"\n\nBelieve it or not, Syd Barrett soon became an acid casualty.\n\nNo. 17. Deep Purple, \"Highway Star\"\n\nFrom: Machine Head (1972)\n\nThe lyric: \"She's got everything – like a moving mouth, body control and everything.\"\n\nWorst Tinder bio ever.\n\nNo. 16. Sammy Hagar, \"Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy\"\n\nFrom: Three Lock Box (1982)\n\nThe lyric: \"Hot, sweet cherries on the vine.\"\n\nDriving us crazy: Cherries (pretty famously) grow on trees.\n\nNo. 15. Rush, \"I Think I'm Going Bald\"\n\nFrom: Caress of Steel (1975)\n\nThe lyric: \"I looked in the mirror today, my eyes just didn't seem so bright – I've lost a few more hairs, I think I'm going bald.\"\n\nNext up, their equally compelling song about flossing.\n\nNo. 14. U2, \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\"\n\nFrom: The Unforgettable Fire (1984)\n\nThe lyric: \"Early morning, April 4 – shot rings out in the Memphis sky.\"\n\nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s awful murder took place just after 6 p.m.\n\nNo. 13. The Doors, \"Riders on the Storm\"\n\nFrom: L.A. Woman (1971)\n\nThe lyric: \"There's a killer on the road, his brain is squirming like a toad.\"\n\nThe creator of the Rhyming Dictionary is somewhere openly weeping.\n\nNo. 12. Yes, \"Your Move\"\n\nFrom: The Yes Album (1971)\n\nThe lyric: \"Don't surround yourself with yourself.\"\n\nWait, what?\n\nNo. 11. Bruce Springsteen, \"The Wrestler\"\n\nFrom: Working on a Dream (2009)\n\nThe lyric: \"Have you ever seen a one-legged dog makin' his way down the street?\"\n\nActually, no.\n\nNo. 10. The Who, \"Pinball Wizard\"\n\nFrom: Tommy (1969)\n\nThe lyric: \"[He] plays by sense of smell.\"\n\nAnyone who's ever been to a musty arcade knows that this would be a particularly dreadful superpower.\n\nNo. 9. Starship, \"We Built This City\"\n\nFrom: Knee Deep in the Hoopla (1985)\n\nThe lyric: \"Who counts the money, underneath the bar – who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars?\"\n\nIf only.\n\nNo. 8. Billy Joel, \"We Didn't Start the Fire\"\n\nFrom: Storm Front (1989)\n\nThe lyric: \"Rock and Roller, cola wars, I can't take it anymore.\"\n\nAs this song unfolds, the Nazis commit genocide, John F. Kennedy is murdered, and nuclear annihilation looms. Yet somehow the cola wars send him over the edge?\n\nNo. 7. The Police, \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\"\n\nFrom: Zenyatta Mondatta (1980)\n\nThe lyric: \"And when their eloquence escapes me – their logic ties me up and rapes me.\"\n\nSting has this weird thing where he sneaks really awful things into songs that everybody thinks are sweet.\n\nNo. 6. America, \"A Horse With No Name\"\n\nFrom: America (1971)\n\nThe lyric: \"In the desert you can remember your name, for there ain’t no-one for to give you no pain.\"\n\nChoosing wasn't easy with a song that also notes that \"the heat was hot.\"\n\nNo. 5. Foreigner, \"Dirty White Boy\"\n\nFrom: Head Games (1979)\n\nThe lyric: \"I'm a loner, but I'm never alone.\"\n\nThen how do you know?\n\nNo. 4. ZZ Top, \"Sleeping Bag\"\n\nFrom: Afterburner (1985)\n\nThe lyric: \"Let's go out to Egypt 'cause it's in the plan ... we'll whip out our mattress 'cause there ain't no beds.\"\n\nThen you won't need the sleeping bag.\n\nNo. 3. Yes, \"Roundabout\"\n\nFrom: Fragile (1971)\n\nThe lyric: \"Mountains come out of the sky – and they stand there.\"\n\nWait, what?\n\nNo. 2. Journey, \"Don't Stop Believin'\"\n\nFrom: Escape (1981)\n\nThe lyric: \"Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit.\"\n\nTo be fair, \"Canadian hamlet of Windsor\" really doesn't work.\n\nNo. 1. Van Halen, \"Why Can't This Be Love?\"\n\nFrom: 5150 (1986)\n\nThe lyric: \"Only time will tell if we stand the test of time.\"\n\nThis might have been better written ... with more time."
