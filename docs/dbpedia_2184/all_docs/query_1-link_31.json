        "text": "How to search for a product that was reported\n\nManufacturers of children's products submit chemical disclosure reports to the Health Department. The reports apply to children's products that are offered for sale in Vermont. Read the glossary of terms used\n\nThe brand name and product model data reported to us by manufacturers are available in the five downloadable Excel files below. You can search the data within the file by manufacturer, brand name or product model. The data are sorted alphabetically by manufacturer.\n\nBrand names are listed only when they were provided to us from the manufacturer. Product models may be words or numbers. The numbers are typically the Universal Product Code (UPC) for the product. Since some of the brand name and product model information is incomplete or not descriptive enough to identify the product, the data will be updated with additional information provided by manufacturers. These files will be updated periodically.\n\nYou can choose to download all the files and browse the data, or you can search by manufacturer or brand in the table below. Some products are reported with a product description instead of a brand. These descriptions are not searchable in the table but are searchable in the data files.\n\nOnce you open the Excel file, follow these steps to complete your search:\n\nMake sure your macro settings are enabled in Excel to conduct the search. If a pop-up notification comes up, accept it to enable macros.\n\nSelect the radio button to choose to search by manufacturer, brand name or product model.\n\nEnter the search term into the yellow search box, click on the orange cell below, then click the “search” button.\n\nDownload all Excel files\n\nManufacturers A - K\n\nManufacturers L - NI\n\nManufacturers NO - VF\n\nManufacturers VF\n\nManufacturers VF - Z\n\nSearch by manufacturer or brand\n\nManufacturerBrand3M CompanyPost-ItAbercrombie & FitchAbercrombieABG AccessoriesAlpha Group Co.,LtdAlpha Group Co.,LtdAllstar Product GroupSnuggie Tails, Tangle PetsAmerican GreetingsAmerican Marketing Enterprise Inc.American Marketing Enterprise Inc.Animal AdventureSoft Landing, Kroger/Fred MeyerApothecary Products, LLCAqua Lung AmericaUS DiversArtsana, USA LLCChiccoBandai IncorporatedBig Hero 6, Dragon Ball Super, Finding Dory, Hatch N Heroes, MechX-4, Miraculous LadyBug, Pacman, Power Rangers, Power Rangers Legacy, Power Rangers-Dino Super Charge, Power Rangers-MMPR, Power Rangers-Movie, Power Rangers-Ninja Steel, Power Rangers-Super Ninja Steel, Tamagotchi, Wreck it Ralph, Zak StormBarnes & Noble, Inc.Barnes & Noble, Nickelodeon, Sandy Creek, WobblioBasic Fun, Inc.MASH'EMS, MEGA MASH'EMS , ZOOBALLOOS Blip Hong KongBlip ToysBlue Orange GamesBlue Orange GamesBoley International (HK) Ltd.Boley, Goofy Foot, Kid Connection, Playday, Spark Create ImagineBonkers ToysBonkers ToysBrandswami LlcZOOCCHINIBritax Child Safety, Inc.BOBBuild-A-Bear WorkshopCCA and B LLCThe Elf on the Shelf, The Elf on the Shelf: Claus Couture CollectionCharlie Banana (Usa) LlcCharlie BananaCheeky ChompersCheeky ChompersClaire's IncClaire'sClic TimeClic Time, BulbBotzCMA Global, Co., LTD.Star Wars, TMNTColumbia Sportswear CompanyColumbia, Columbia Sportswear, Mountain Hardware, SorelConair CorporationCooperman Fife & Drum CoCooperman HistoryLivesCost Plus World MarketCost Plus World Market, World MarketCrayola LLCD.M.

The presence of a chemical in a children’s product does not necessarily mean that the product is harmful to human health or that there is any violation of existing safety standards or laws. The reporting triggers are not health-based values.\n\nAct 188 (2014)\n\nThere are currently 89 chemicals on the State’s list of Chemicals of High Concern to Children. Act 188 (Vermont Statute Title 18, Chapter 38A) relating to the regulation of toxic substances (2014) creates a requirement that manufacturers who use chemicals designated by the State of Vermont as Chemicals of High Concern to Children must disclose information about these chemicals to the Health Department.\n\nA \"chemical of high concern to children\" means a chemical listed under Act 188, or a chemical designated by the Health Department as a chemical of high concern by rule under §1776.\n\nChemical of High Concern in Children's Products Rule\n\nThe Chemical of High Concern in Children's Products Rule provides the information required from the manufacturer about chemicals of high concern that are in a children’s product made by the manufacturer. If the chemical is intentionally added to a children’s product, manufacturers are required to report to the State if the chemical is in the product at a level above the Practical Quantitation Limit (PQL) — the lowest amount of a chemical that can be measured in a product with confidence. If a chemical is not intentionally added to a children’s product, the manufacturer is required to report to the State when it is at concentrations of 100 parts per million or greater.\n\nChemicals of High Concern in Children's Products Workshop Minutes - April 3, 2023\n\nChemicals of High Concern in Children's Products Workshop Minutes - September 5, 2019\n\nChemicals of High Concern in Children's Products Workshop Minutes - September 5, 2019\n\nChemicals of High Concern in Children’s Products Workshop Minutes - January 22, 2018"
