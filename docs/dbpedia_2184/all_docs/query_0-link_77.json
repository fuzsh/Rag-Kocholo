        "text": "We picked up our Kenai last month, and while we will enjoy and put our camper to good use I must say I've been pretty disappointed with Scout / Adventure.\n\nFirst though, I love the concept of the minimal truck camper. We chose a Scout camper largely because of what it DIDN'T include. I've spent a lot of time working on boats, and know how much maintenance things like running water and septic systems take in the long run. Scout is one of the only players in the truck camper space really focusing on simplicity, and on that they do deliver.\n\nBUT there's a fine line between minimalism and cutting corners. While I haven't found anything that can't be worked around, it's been enough to leave a sour taste in our mouths. That coupled with dismissive responses from Scout has me wanting to let you know about our experience.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the mattress for the rooftop tent is completely missing upholstery. The main bed mattress and all the cushions downstairs have covers, while the mattress for the rooftop tent is literally just a cut out of raw foam. It even has sharpie marks on it from the templating! (https://postimg.cc/Pvb83xHw). While there aren't many pictures of the interior of the tent on their website... now I know why... there are multiple pictures that appear to show an upholstered mattress (https://postimg.cc/gallery/6n7BY99). We have family with the RoofNest on their SUV and can confirm the retail tent does have a mattress cover... as you would expect. If you've never done custom upholstery this may seem like nitpicking, but upholstery is skilled work and is expensive / time consuming (pick one). Ryan from Scout pointed out that they would have to account for the access hatch which would be more complicated than a regular cover. So the solution is just to leave it out altogether and disguise the fact on your website?\n\nAnother thing came up recently while I was looking into getting the battery charged using the truck alternator while driving. This is a pretty standard feature in the RV world, as the 7 pin connector used for DOT lights also delivers 12v power from the engine. I asked about it when picking up from the dealer, who said yes, most do this but Scout does not. Instead they give you a small (~100w) cigarette lighter adapter and you can take the Yeti into the truck and charge it. This gets old quickly, so I started tracing the wiring looking for a way to connect the adapter to the 7 pin connection that is already coming into the camper. To my surprise I find that there actually IS wiring from the 7 pin, all the way to the Yeti, which ends in a loose (disconnected) proprietary plug with Goal Zero branding. BUT, there is nowhere to plug it in on the Yeti. It turns out that the battery would charge from the 7 pin, but it requires a $400 module from Goal Zero. It's like they did all the work to implement a fairly standard feature, then realized how much the Goal Zero component cost and thought \"why should we spend the money? we'll just make the buyer figure out what we've done and buy it himself\".\n\nIf you've already put a deposit down on your Scout, I don't want to discourage you too much. If minimalism and simplicity were the biggest selling points, as they were for us, then none of this will be a deal breaker. It isn't for us, it's just disappointing relative to how the campers are represented online. We probably would not have paid up for the rooftop tent though.\n\nIf you're just looking, my strong advise is not to go off what you see online. Find a way to see one in person, preferably with the options you want. Pay attention to the details, how things will actually work in practice, and decide if the rough edges are worth it.\n\nI wish Scout would spend as much time polishing the practical details of their campers as they seem to be spending polishing their website and photography.\n\nWhile these things were mildly annoying, they are entirely non-issues personally for us (and we spent like 11 weekends in our Scout in a row when we got it...with 4 of us). My wife fixed the mattress cover quick. She cut out the cut-out in the cover we bought and then used fabric spray-on glue to attach the top to the cutout foam. My wife is also adept at complaining about stuff, she's not complained about this aside from the first time.\n\nThe charge controller thing was a supply chain issue when they spec'd these. Goal Zero didn't have a functioning charge controller for it yet. Then their EC8 cable went under a recall. You don't want to charge using your 7-pin anyways, which is why people run a custom line in the other camper styles...you'd get a measly 90w out of the small gauge stuff in your 7-pin. That's less than your cigarette port would do. Its just stock truck wiring isn't meant for this. Its a common thing for any slide-in with a sweet battery. You'll have to do the wiring on your truck yourself or get a upfitter/dealer to do it. Use 6awg wiring and you'll be good and instead of 90w you'll pull like 500w-600w. Always been that way if you wanted real charge rate.\n\nIf the charge module came stock, I guess I might be interested but they would just charge for me for it from Scout. Not everyone needs it and I'd rather not pay for it unless I found I needed it. Plus not everyone wants to use GoalZero's controller. Its a 10 minute install to DIY if you do. If you want it, buy it. No big deal. Nice that they wired it in for it tho. I think a Victron will run you around 300$-350$ for similar 750w support.\n\nNote that the GoalZero 1500X is pretty damn sweet dude. My sisters 200k$ sprinter van just came with two lead-acid batteries. Sure they'll work better at freezing temps, but they don't last long and you only get like 60% efficiency out of those. The GoalZero gives you 90% efficiency and a 120ah iirc. Its not like they went cheap there like the other camper manuf's do. Its legit in my opinion.\n\nThe only thing that bothers me to today is my drain port is a bit small and Its not flush with the bottom of the drain pan. I have to ensure my campers on a bit of an angle for it to drain well. That is annoying me, tho since my camper sticks out 6\" or so past my tailgate, I think I'll just drill a hole in the floor and put one of my drift boat plugs into it. Should do the trick.\n\nNevertheless, don't let the 5% that's not perfect distract you from the 95% that is pretty sweet. Compared to everything else we looked into (for 4 people) this is WAAAY better.\n\nWhile people say its a minimalist camper, I greatly disagree. Ours is significantly more capable that most. I can go out for a week or 2 and: use the toilet the whole time, shower as much as I want after MTB rides for 4 of us (stream/lake access), stay cool with efficient fans, grab water from the creek, sleep 4 damn people (or stinking buddy up top), charge battery on the fly (solar or cig charger), pack all fishing and MTB gear for 4 of us and its under 2k lbs. Features be damned, I'm all about capability and it has that in spades. Its a sweet setup.\n\nWe have a Kenai as well and have basically the same feelings as @jackca (low-medium build quality) and @svinyard (there's nothing else out there like it). I was also put off by the bare foam in the RTT and found a lot of issues with plywood voids, bubbles/bumps in the composite walls, etc. Ours feels a lot like a prototype camper rather than a mature design. I also think covid related supply shortages hit them while they were struggle to keep up with promised delivery timelines.\n\nSome more details here: https://expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/scout-olympic-vs-kenai.218045/post-2896480\n\nWe were also pretty underwhelmed by the cold weather capabilities which was actually our original motivation for getting the Kenai. The Dickinson heater looks awesome but just barely keeps up when the temp gets below 20F. All the doors and hatches are quite flimsy and drafty. The big external hatches on the passenger side and rear pass through hatch provide great storage but also tons of heat loss since they're not insulated.\n\nMore details on winter ski trips with the Kenai here: https://expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/scout-olympic-vs-kenai.218045/post-2912342\n\nThat all being said, I still get excited about the Kenai. We like the minimalist philosophy about it after fighting failing RV systems for years. It's surprisingly roomy inside and is a great option for families with the RTT. Agreed that the Yeti 1500X is great and I actually don't mind not being connected to the truck as we've been able to get by strictly on solar power.\n\nIt's probably best compared against a DIY option starting with one of the Total Composite boxes. I think I could have spent 6 months building one of those and ended up with a similar total cost, similar (or worse) build quality, and one less season of camping with the kids. It's not an Arctic Fox/Northern Lite with fancy cabinetry and it's not at the quality level or price tag of an Earthcruiser/OEV camper. If you think if it as a good starting point for further modification/customization I think it's still a compelling option."
