        "text": "February 7, 2017\n\nMinette Walters writes excellent books, all free standing , all full of interesting characters and all with great storylines. Fox Evil is no exception.\n\nSet in the English country side this book takes us into the lives of both the gentry in their big houses and the 'travellers' in their buses with no fixed place of abode. There are murders and thefts, some animals and children suffer cruelty and a couple of people take leave of their senses. Throughout the whole there are a few voices of sanity in the three main characters, James, Mark and Nancy.\n\nThis one of those books which turns it own pages. Once I had started it there was no stopping until I got to the end. Great stuff!!!\n\nRead\n\nApril 15, 2010\n\nDo you ever get a real feeling of utter satisfaction when you finish a book? You find yourself savoring the book, not wanting it to end and planning the reading of the last page in a special place, like an outdoor swing or a favorite chair. Well this book I am about to recommend gave me such an experience. It was a great mystery set in rural England in the 2000s with the proverbial twists and turns that held my ADD in check for long stretches of time. I may be late to the game, this may be a book that most of you have read, or at least you may have read other books by this author. At any rate,I loved it and hope you get same reader high that I got. The book: Fox Evil by Minnette Walters.\n\nApril 20, 2022\n\nA page turner with lots of twists and turns in rural Dorset. Nancy the no nonsense illegitimate great grand daughter, Mark the to good to be true solicitor and the cantankerous elderly Colonel. Walters weaves a great tale with murder, a psychopath, ill treated children and meddling busy bodies.\n\nThe Colonel is subject to a campaign of terror of abusive phone calls, the murder of his wife, Vera the senile housekeeper and travelers invading a copse near his manor.\n\nI did think as the reader the sudden introduction of Julian as the coconspirator was unexpected. Although the clues were there with his mistress, extravagant lifestyle and limited means. Fox evil was a nasty character and his tools of choice a razor and hammer gruesome.\n\nOverall a good read.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 19, 2010\n\nI enjoyed this book. Walter sprinkles an ample amount of clues and red herrings to keep you constantly guessing who and what is going on. The only gripe I have is near the conclusion when it seems the real culprit comes out of nowhere and relies on some facts that we, as the reader, never saw. Part of me feels as if that's cheating!\n\nHowever, after reading the ending, it does make sense and is reasonably satisfying. Please note, there are some descriptions of animal cruelty.\n\nDecember 12, 2017\n\nTedio e sbadigli nel Dorset\n\nNutrivo scarse aspettative su questo romanzetto e purtroppo non sono stato smentito: è un libro privo di personalità, presentato dall’edizione italiana con un titolo e una copertina che sembrano alludere a un giallo classico, che poi si rivela una specie di sconclusionato thriller con personaggi di rara antipatia (buoni e cattivi…) e uno pseudointreccio prolisso e tentennante per buona parte del suo svolgimento fino al finale pasticciato che sto già cominciando a dimenticare… Avrei dovuto fidarmi del precedente altrettanto scadente di “La scultrice” per evitare un nuovo incontro con questa scrittrice.\n\nIn definitiva, l’unico vero mistero rimane il motivo che mi ha indotto, non so quanti anni orsono, ad acquistarlo!\n\nOctober 17, 2017\n\n3,5*\n\nΑρκετά καλή γραφή, ωραία υπόθεση, ικανοποιητική η επίλυση της και αρκετά στοιχειοθετημένη. Κλείνει όλες τις παραμέτρους που έχει ανοίξει στο βιβλίο και μαθαίνεις την κατάληξη του κάθε ήρωα που έχει χρησιμοποιήσει. Δεν το λες φυσικά αστυνομικό μυθιστόρημα αλλά είναι ένα ωραίο βιβλίο μυστηρίου. Νομίζω ότι θα ξαναδιαβάσω βιβλίο της Walters κάποια στιγμή στο μέλλον.\n\nNovember 11, 2010\n\n\"Fox Evil was well-named. He used women and children until he lost interest in them, then he killed them. He was the worst kind of predator. He killed for pleasure.\"\n\nMinette Walters has the uncanny ability to write her characters and plots into a wide range of social situations. She believes in writing stand-alone novels. She never returns or makes any reference to, any of her previous fictional worlds. This is unusual for the crime/mystery writer but probably owes much to the fact that she was previously published in the generic romance genre.\n\nI have read every novel written by Minette Walters. The Ice House was published in 1992. It won the John Creasey Award for Best First Novel. Since then she has written The Sculptress ,Scold's Bridle, The Dark Room, The Echo, The Breaker, Shape of Snakes and Acid Row. She has received the Edgar Award and The Gold Dagger Award from the British Crime Writers Association.\n\nI loved The Ice House and The Sculptress most of all. I enjoyed the others. I looked forward to Fox Evil, but like, Acid Row her previous novel, it failed to captivate me. I’m not sure why but I suspect it has something to do with her trying too hard, going on to ever more complex plots, when maybe she should linger a little longer on well created characters and situations.\n\nThis time she travels to Shenstead in Dorset. It is not a village as much as a collection of tensions that come to the surface in Fox Evil. The foxhunting community feels threatened by outsiders. Ailsa Lockyer-Fox is found dead in her garden. Her husband, a brute, is the suspect. He is cleared at the inquest but suspicion remains and his London lawyer, Mark Ankerton, attempts to unravel the secrets harboured in the past. We discover children cut out of wills, an illegitimate grandchild once put up for adoption and a campaign of whispers. Walters, as always, weaves a careful plot.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nOctober 29, 2010\n\n• FOX EVIL by Minette Walters, Macmillan\n\n415 pps. 32 chaps. 135,000 words.\n\nWritten from multi-viewpoint (Some God’s Eye view) using narrative with some reports from TV, papers and internet and some letters. Centres on the relationship between an adopted woman and her real grandfather with her relationship with the grandfather’s lawyer as the love interest. The many characters are individuals and are well drawn, credible but interesting. The crimes are, of course, murders, including the killing of the woman’s grandmother and the killer’s part time wife and child. The killer is a psychopath with the manipulative charm of such a breed and he is also a ruthless killer – the body count reaches thirty by the end of the book. A cruel man, totally without morals, he preys mostly on women and the weak. Blackmail, false accusations, theft, and animal cruelty are set against a background of rural life including hunting and farming. The heroine is brave, intelligent, resourceful and kind. The lawyer is gentle, thoughtful, a little naïve in some areas, but knowledgeable where it counts. Other characters include a senile and vindictive housekeeper, a shiftless gardener, an evil philanderer and fraud, two malicious gossips and a couple of self-serving blonde lovers. A good tale, well told and gripping enough to keep my attention. I enjoyed reading this and found the ending wholly satisfying. Recommended.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 24, 2020\n\nI love Minette Walters, so a 3 star review for me is disappointing. Her average books are still usually better judging just by her talent at writing such evocative, seductive prose; she’s really exceptionally good for the British/tramping about in the picturesque woods/moors, etc. wearing the oh-so British required Wellington’s GENRE. (Yes, I took a long way about in that particular sentence!) But, unfortunately, so does the plot and pacing of Fox Evil. It takes a truly dedicated reader to plunge through doggedly trying to get all the characters and the perhaps? relations to each other, so, I was disappointed at the ending. It seemed we took the long way ‘round to get to the picnic site, and then the picnic was no picnic.\n\nRecommend reading one of her earlier titles if your new to this author.\n\nApril 29, 2009\n\nI have read several books by Minette Walters and have enjoyed them all. My usual preference in mysteries are for cozies, but I find Walters' books engrossing and this one was no different. I like the way many of her characters exhibit keen intelligence. Many are always thinking. She gets into the heads of most of the main characters. She was great in this book at making the incidents believable. And as always there is a twist at the end that is rather unexpected. She leaves tantalizing clues and keeps you guessing about who is telling the truth and who is lying. Finally, I appreciate that the police in this book are presented as competent and intelligent. So often in mysteries, they are represented a bumbling and stupid.\n\nJanuary 1, 2011\n\nAbsolutely great! After the first 100 pages i had to abandon most of the work I was supposed to be doing and keep reading till the end.\n\nIt's incredible how the author manages to go into the depth of what people were thinking. It made me see a couple of things differently. The only thing I didn't love was the last chapter. It was good, but in comparison with the great chapters it could have been better.\n\nAugust 7, 2011\n\nMinette Walters is compared to Ruth Rendell all the time. Yes, they're both female, British, mystery writers, but that only means so much. Walters is so, so, so, much better than Rendell - and I like Rendell. Walters' books are just smarter and tighter in every way, her facility with language is worlds beyond Rendell's, her plotting more surprising, but never outlandish.\n\nJuly 25, 2014\n\nI loved this book, though I really didn't expect to. A random find in a book sale, but the best $3.50 I've spent in a long time. The characters walked straight off the pages and onto the stage, they were so real. The story swept along, with each subplot as interesting as the next. There were no dull patches, just thundering to a gripping finish.\n\nOctober 10, 2007\n\nI usually love Minette Walters, but I couldn't get into it after the first 50 pages so I dropped it. Maybe it gets more interesting later.\n\nApril 26, 2019\n\nΆνετο και χαλαρό ανάγνωσμα,χωρίς αυτό το \"κάτι\" που θα δικαιολογούσε τον χαρακτηρισμό του οπισθόφυλλου \"συναρπαστικό ψυχολογικό θρίλερ\".Ένας αναγνώστης-λάτρης των μυστηρίων θα καταλάβει πού οδεύει η υπόθεση εκεί γύρω στα μισά του βιβλίου,οπότε το υπόλοιπο διαβάζεται διεκπεραιωτικά,με μικρές διακυμάνσεις αγωνίας.Δεν είναι κακό,δεν είναι καταπληκτικό.Θα έβαζα 4⭐ απλά για τους αρκετά καλοδουλεμένους χαρακτήρες και την ωραία συντροφιά που μου κράτησε,όμως θα πάρει ένα 3⭐ (κι αυτό δύσκολα,γιατί η εισαγωγική σκηνή με το βασανισμό και το θάνατο του ζώου,ήταν παντελώς αχρείαστη.Η αναλυτική περιγραφή της κακοποίησης έγινε απλά για τον εντυπωσιασμό του αναγνώστη,μιας και η πορεία της ιστορίας εξελίχθηκε πιο πολύ σε οικογενειακό δράμα.)\n\nFebruary 11, 2017\n\nΑντί για ένα \"καθαρόαιμο\" αστυνομικό, διαβάσαμε στη Λέσχη μας αυτό. Ένα ψυχολογικό θρίλερ κατά βάση με πολλή ένταση και ανατροπές. Ενδιαφέρον παρουσίασε και η εξέλιξη της ιστορίας. Περιττές ισως οι τελευταίες 10 σελίδες που μπορούν να χαρακτηριστούν και γλυκανάλατες. Σε γενικές γραμμές ένα ευχάριστο ανάγνωσμα για όσους τους αρέσει η αστυνομική λογοτεχνία.\n\nOctober 9, 2019\n\nIt's not the best of thrillers but it does make you think about the repercussions of gossip. In fact, gossip and slandering deteriorated one of the characters so emotionally that it affected him physically. It also drew importance to the negativity of purposely isolating yourself from people. Colonel Luckyer-Fox is mourning the death of his wife. With the coroner passing her death off as natural causes, it's his neighbours that set the malicious rumour-mongering of him murdering her and of having an incestuous relationship with his own daughter. He assumes that it's his son, using a distorted voice, out of the 3 callers and therefore does not react to it. Instead, he asks his lawyer to find his granddaughter who was given up for adoption to hide the result of a teenage pregnancy by their own daughter. Hence, the rumour of the colonel giving up the child to remove the stigma of him fathering the child. Nancy, the granddaughter, is reluctant to begin a relationship with her biological family but is intrigued by her grandfather's character - she is also in the army just like him and shares many characteristics with him. On top of all this, travellers arrive and settle on unclaimed land which is a nuisance for the \"rich\" folk of Dorset. The rest of the novel is Mark and Nancy trying to piece things together as to why Ailsa Luckyer-Fox died and why the neighbours are so adamant in blaming the colonel for her death. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a short mystery with not too much of suspense.\n\nMarch 25, 2018\n\nThe story starts quite horrifically and builds a worryingly unpleasant setting for what follows. It's difficult to explain why I found what follows disappointing without giving away too many details of the plot. I guess I'd have to say that the details I would be giving away seemed sufficiently formulaic and the resolution of the whodunnit element enough of a cop-out that I only just made it to the end. I never quite believed in, or cared about, the characters beyond their role in carrying the plot along. I found some elements of the back-story more interesting than the main narrative itself and was sorry that they were only glimpsed. Hmmm. Pretty flat review that reflects my reading experience.\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nI read this quite a while ago, and hung onto it because I like Minette Walters enough to retain all her books for eventually rereading. In many ways, this is vintage Walters - a whiff of pure evil permeats the whole thing as a comlex, twisted plots does a slow burn to a relatively surprise climax. On the other hand, there are few likeable characters, and the unlikeable ones are largely unlikeable in the same way. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, except that we spend a great deal of time with the latter, and I sometimes wanted to yell 'enough, already, I get it.' So, not my favourite of her books, but interesting on the reread.\n\nSeptember 21, 2022\n\nGreat page-turner with convoluted twist at the end.\n\nOctober 5, 2020\n\nIt's been a long time since I have been so absorbed by a book.\n\nAt the heart of the story, or rather the driving force, is \"Fox Evil\". This is a man who is traveling with a band of travelers, who descend upon a village in Dorset at night and quietly set up their campers in a circle on vacant land. Fox knows the land to be in disputed ownership, and he sells his band on the idea of \"adverse possession\" - hang on long enough and the land is theirs.\n\nWith Fox is his small ten-year-old son, Wolfie, who is deeply afraid of Fox and who does not know what happened to his mother and younger brother. Wolfie gets by on his wits, scrabbling for bits and trying to keep together when his father can't be bothered to care for him.\n\nWe learn that Fox seems to know a lot about this village. More than a casual aquaintance would suggest. He also speaks with a \"posh\" accent, suggesting a possible former connection with someone in the village. Particularly Colonel James Lockyer-Fox, who lives alone in his large old house, mourning the death of his wife.\n\nLockyer-Fox is especially interested in finding his illegitimate granddaughter, who was adopted out at birth 28 years before, and he sends his solicitor out to find her. But she has a good home and is not interested in knowing anything about her birth family.\n\nFox Evil intrudes on everyone's lives, from the village gossips to the Colonel's, and may be a factor in the death of Lockyer-Fox's wife. Who is he really, and what is he after?\n\nThe characters are well-developed and interesting. I became fond of several, which especially led me on. There are aspects to the story that i wondered about - such as the tendency of some of the police to pronounce their opinions rather too freely, in places where one would normally be more circumspect. I also had questions in my mind about the lives of the two grown children of the Lockyer-Foxes. How did they grow up to become the way they did? But while I may have thought some of these things doubtful, they did not stop me from fully enjoying the story all the way to the end (the ending went on rather long, I thought).\n\nJuly 28, 2018\n\nThis book left me unsatisfied and disappointed. Although, the story started very promising: a family mystery in a small village and a couple of uncanny, suspicious characters, it could not leave up to its potential.\n\nThe description of the main characters was detailed. However, the individual was given to less space and reappeared too infrequent in the book, so the reader get no opportunity to become familiar to them. The author jumps from one scene to the other with a variation of the characters. So, we are in fact well-informed, but it's hard to make a smooth story out of it.\n\nThe ending seemed too far-fetched and the solution did not has anything to do with the initial family mystery at all. In fact, the ending was summed up in a newspapr article and a letter from an attorney, rather than from the story itself. I was always paging up and re-read because I thought I missed something, but I did not...\n\nJuly 21, 2020\n\nThe second Minette Walters book I've read, I enjoyed it and will certainly read more. I like her characters, they have depth and are believable, even the minor characters don't slip into stereotypes. The story is very strong and builds nicely. Both books (I think the other one was called The Dark Room) include newspaper clippings of crime reports which adds a touch of realism I quite like, not seen that technique before. I was an avid reader of Agatha Christie when I was a boy, and this is in the same vein. There's a central mystery which I didn't guess although the clues are there. It was a tad contrived in the end, but not enough to put me off. There was also an almost Dickensian element which I did see coming fairly early on. The pace is measured, not slow exactly, but relentless and I found myself looking forward to reading it each day. If I could I'd give it 3.5 stars but 4 is a half too much. I'll definitely read more by this author.\n\nDecember 8, 2017\n\nMinette Walters knows how to write a good story and how to keep one reading. The characters in this book are not all that likeable, apart from Nancy, Mark, James and perhaps Bella, but the reader keeps being interested in the relations, goings-on and outcome of all this. Having said that, the book isn’t really all that gripping or thrilling. It kind of drifts to a sort of climax that wasn’t really exiting or tense. The who-did-it part was not very interesting and the why was written a little too aloof and stand-offish, as though miss Walters couldn’t find the right way to tie everything up in prose.\n\nAll in all: not her best book, but it kept me entertained for a few days.\n\nJanuary 16, 2021\n\nBack in the 90s I read three Minette Walters - The Ice House, The Sculptress and The Scold's Bridle. I really enjoyed them at the time and thought I'd try a newer one of hers.\n\nThe story in Fox Evil follows a similar pattern (murder mystery), but wasn't as engaging as her earlier work. I didn't connect with any of the characters, wasn't rooting for them and the reveal was a disappointment. Not because I'd guessed it, but because the culprit was a very minor character who Walters hadn't given enough clues about.\n\nI still enjoyed her writing but felt this one was a shadow of her previous novels.\n\nMay 25, 2021\n\nI am repeatedly impressed by this author. Her ability to start each book from scratch is amazing. She does a fine job of character development and provides enough background to help the reader understand much about how they got there. This involves the wealthy, people who are “travelers”, and some in the middle. People with military experience get pulled into the mix. The police actually have a more minor role in the story. As the title implies, foxes are a theme that runs throughout. Highly recommend!"
