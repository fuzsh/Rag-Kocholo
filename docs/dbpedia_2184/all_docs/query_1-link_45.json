        "text": "Karl Blossfeldt’s Urformen der Kunst\n\nIn 1928, at the grand old age of 63, just four years before his death, Karl Blossfeldt produced his first photography book, the internationally best-selling *Urformen der Kunst* (later translated into English as *Art Forms in Plants*). The book’s 120 plates display Blossfeldt’s remarkable photographs of plants – varieties from Equisetum hyemale (Winter Horsetail) to Tellima grandiflora (Fringe cups) — all captured in extraordinary detail, as if under the microscope, frozen into new forms almost beyond recognition. Using a relatively simple handmade camera, Blossfeldt achieved startling results — the plants becoming graphic, geometric. Blossfeldt’s work was quiet and unassuming, but it quickly aligned with the avant-gardes of Weimar Germany: from “New Vision” to “New Objectivity”. It provided a counterpart in the natural world to what others had attempted to achieve in the excess of the modern city: from the work of August Sander to László Moholy-Nagy. The critic Walter Benjamin was one of the first to review Blossfeldt’s book, claiming his fellow German had discovered the “optical unconscious”: that which was invisible to the naked eye, revealed retrospectively or technically through the apparatus of the camera.

The hand-lettered text, done by the author’s brother, tells the story of an elderly couple who live comfortably, but realize that they are very lonely. The wife wants a cat to love, so her husband sets off in search of a beautiful one to bring home to her. After travelling far away from home, he finds a hillside covered in “cats here, cats there, Cats and kittens everywhere. Hundreds of cats, thousands of cats, Millions and billions and trillions of cats...” This rhythmic phrase is repeated several other times throughout the story. Wanda Gag pioneered the double-page spread in this book. Writer and reviewer Anita Silvey explained, “She used both pages to move the story forward, putting them together with art that sweeps across the entire page spread: her favorite illustration fell in the center of the book - with the old man carrying cats against the rolling hills.” Millions of Cats is on the New York Public Library’s list of 100 Great Children’s Books.

Du Bois’s Dark Princess\n\nIn Dark Princess (1928), Du Bois, a prominent African American scholar and civil rights activist, delves into themes of race, identity, and international politics. The novel follows the journey of a young African prince, Matthew Towns, as he becomes involved in a political conspiracy to uplift the Black race worldwide. Du Bois explores internationalism and international racial solidarity, as well as corruption and violent radicalism within African-American culture. The book’s subtitle, A Romance, points to the narrative’s double valence. As Michèle Mendelssohn argues, “it is the story of a love affair, as well as the story of an ideological romance that challenges one of the United States’ most cherished ideas about itself, the notion that it is a land of progress and possibility for all. The love lost between the hero and the U. S. is the spur for the novel’s political reorientation.” Not well received when first published, the novel was criticized for its expression of eroticism as well as for what some critics thought was a failed attempt at social realism. Late in life, Du Bois described this as his favorite work.

It opened on 31 August 1928 at Berlin’s Theater am Schiffbauerdamm. The influential play is a satirical take on society, crime, and morality. Set in the grim underbelly of London, the narrative follows the antihero Macheath, known as Mack the Knife, and his exploits as a criminal. and i the process explores the corrupting influence of capitalism, the blurred lines between good and evil, and the nature of justice. With influences from jazz and German dance music, songs from The Threepenny Opera have been widely covered and become standards, most notably “Die Moritat von Mackie Messer” (“The Ballad of Mack the Knife”) and “Seeräuberjenny” (“Pirate Jenny”).

H. Lawrence, which was first published privately in 1928, in Italy, and in 1929, in France. An unexpurgated edition was not published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960, when it was the subject of a watershed obscenity trial against the publisher Penguin Books, which won the case and quickly sold three million copies. The book was also banned for obscenity in the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan. The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical (and emotional) relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its explicit descriptions of sex and its use of then-unprintable profane words.

Through a blend of autobiography and fiction, Breton delves into the realm of the subconscious, where reality and dreams intermingle. The narrative unfolds as a series of chance meetings, discussions, and musings on the nature of love and identity. In many ways Nadja captures the essence of the surrealist movement, emphasizing the irrational and the unexpected.

Produced in black and white by Walt Disney Studios, the cartoon is considered the debut of both Mickey and Minnie Mouse, although both characters appeared in a test screening of Plane Crazy several months earlier. Steamboat Willie is especially notable for being one of the first cartoons with synchronized sound, as well as one of the first cartoons to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack, which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons. Music for Steamboat Willie was arranged by Wilfred Jackson and Bert Lewis, and it included the songs “Steamboat Bill”, a composition popularized by baritone Arthur Collins during the 1910s, and “Turkey in the Straw”, a composition popularized within minstrelsy during the 19th century. The film has received wide critical acclaim, not only for introducing one of the world’s most popular cartoon characters but also for its technical innovation. In 1994, members of the animation field voted *Steamboat Willie* 13th in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, which listed the greatest cartoons of all time. However, the film has been the center of a variety of controversies, notably regarding the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act passed in the United States. It was close to entering the public domain in the U.S. several times: each time, copyright protection was extended. It could have entered the public domain in four different years: first in 1955, renewed to 1986, then to 2003 by the Copyright Act of 1976, and then to 2023 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (also known pejoratively as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act”) of 1998. It has been claimed that these extensions were a response by Congress to extensive lobbying by The Walt Disney Company.

Wells’s The Open Conspiracy\n\nThe Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution was published in 1928 by H. G. Wells. Many of its ideas are anticipated in Wells’s 1926 novel The World of William Clissold. The book is, in Wells’s words, a “scheme to thrust forward and establish a human control over the destinies of life and liberate it from its present dangers, uncertainties and miseries.” It proposes that largely as the result of scientific progress, a common vision of a world “politically, socially and economically unified” is emerging among educated and influential people, and that this can be the basis of “a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity” that can result in the establishment of a “world commonwealth”. This is to be achieved by “drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world community out of their selection.” This will ultimately “be a world religion.” (Wikipedia)\n\nAlready public domain in countries with a “life plus 70 years” and “life plus 50 years” copyright.\n\nRadclyffe Hall’s The Well of Loneliness\n\nThe Well of Loneliness (1928) is a lesbian novel by British author Radclyffe Hall. It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose “sexual inversion” (homosexuality) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn, whom she meets while serving as an ambulance driver in World War I, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as typically suffered by “inverts”, with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays “inversion” as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: “Give us also the right to our existence”. Shortly after the book’s publication, it became the target of a campaign by James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express. Douglas wrote that “I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel.” A British court judged it obscene because it defended “unnatural practices between women” and it would not be published again in England for another two decades. In the United States, the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court. Publicity over the legal battles increased the visibility of lesbians in British and American culture, and for decades it was the best-known lesbian novel in English, and often the first source of information about lesbianism that young people could find.

This classic anti-war novel is a poignant and powerful depiction of the horrors of World War I. Narrated by the soldier Paul Bäumer, the story describes the German soldiers’ extreme physical and mental trauma during the war as well as the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the war. Remarque’s writing is marked by its stark realism and emotional depth, conveying the futility and senselessness of war. The book and its sequel, The Road Back (1930), were among the books banned and burned in Nazi Germany. It sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print. Three film adaptations of the book have been made, each of which was lauded. The 1930 American adaptation, directed by Lewis Milestone, won two Academy Awards. The 1979 British-American adaptation, a television film by Delbert Mann, won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. The 2022 German adaptation, directed by Edward Berger, won four Academy Awards.

Prior to its publication, Sassoon’s reputation rested entirely on his poetry, mostly written during and about World War I. Only ten years after the war ended, after some experience of journalism, did he feel ready to branch out into prose. So uncertain was he of the wisdom of this move that he elected to publish Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man anonymously. It is a depiction of his early years presented in the form of an autobiographical novel, with false names being given to the central characters, including Sassoon himself, who appears as “George Sherston”. Sassoon was motivated to write the work by a war incident, when a fox was loose in the trenches and one of his friends shot and killed it, though it also draws heavily on his pre-war life, with riding and hunting being among the favourite pastimes of the author. Much of the material for the novel came from Sassoon’s own diaries and he said he was inspired by the work of Marcel Proust: “A few pages of Proust have made me wonder whether insignificant episodes aren’t the most significant”.

Based, in part, on Waugh’s schooldays at Lancing College, undergraduate years at Hertford College, Oxford, and his experience as a teacher at Arnold House in north Wales, the book is a social satire that employs the author’s characteristic black humour in lampooning various features of British society in the 1920s. While the title is a contraction of Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, it also alludes to the German philosopher Oswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West (1918–1922), which first appeared in an English translation in 1926 and which argued, among other things, that the rise of nations and cultures is inevitably followed by their eclipse. Waugh read both Gibbons and Spengler while writing the book. Indeed, Waugh’s satire is unambiguously hostile to much that was in vogue in the late 1920s, and “themes of cultural confusion, moral disorientation and social bedlam...both drive the novel forward and fuel its humour.” Waugh himself stated in his ‘Author’s Note’ to the first edition: ‘Please bear in mind throughout that IT IS MEANT TO BE FUNNY.’ (Wikipedia)\n\nAlready public domain in countries with a “life plus 50 years” copyright.\n\nRead on Project Gutenberg\n\nThe Passion of Joan of Arc directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer\n\nLa Passion de Jeanne d’Arc is a 1928 French silent historical film based on the actual record of the trial of Joan of Arc. The film was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and stars Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan. It is widely regarded as a landmark of cinema, especially for its production, Dreyer’s direction, and Falconetti’s performance, which is often listed as one of the finest in cinema history. Dreyer spent over a year researching Joan of Arc and the transcripts of her trial before writing the script. The performance and devotion to the role of the stage actress Falconetti, in her only major film role, have become legendary among film scholars. The film — shot on one huge concrete set modeled on medieval architecture in order to realistically portray the Rouen prison — is known for its cinematography and use of close-ups. Dreyer did not allow the actors to wear make-up and used lighting designs that made the actors look more grotesque. Despite the objections and cutting of the film by clerical and government authorities, it was a major critical success when first released and has consistently been considered one of the greatest films ever made. It has been praised and referenced by many film directors and musicians. In 1958, the film was voted number 4 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo.

Arguably one of Woolf’s most popular novels, it was inspired by the tumultuous family history of the aristocratic poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, Woolf’s lover and close friend. The book describes the adventures of a poet who changes sex from man to woman and lives for centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history. Considered a feminist classic, the book has been written about extensively by scholars of women’s writing and gender and transgender studies.

The book details the sexual life of teenagers in Samoan society in the early 20th century, and theorizes that culture has a leading influence on psychosexual development. The book launched Mead as a pioneering researcher and as the most famous anthropologist in the world. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy on questions pertaining to society, culture, and science. It is a key text in the nature versus nurture debate, as well as in discussions on issues relating to family, adolescence, gender, social norms, and attitudes. Mead’s field work for “Coming of Age” has been scrutinized, and major discrepancies were found between her published statements and her field data. Samoans themselves tend to be critical of what Mead wrote of their culture, especially her claim that adolescent promiscuity was socially acceptable in Samoa in the 1920s. (Wikipedia)\n\nA. A. Milne’s The House at Pooh Corner\n\nThe House at Pooh Corner is a 1928 children’s book by A. A. Milne and illustrated by E. H. Shepard. This book is the second novel, and final one by Milne, to feature Winnie-the-Pooh and his world. The book is also notable for introducing the character, Tigger, a bouncy and energetic tiger. The collection of tales include Eeyore’s birthday celebration, Pooh’s attempt to catch a Heffalump, and an “expotition” to the North Pole. Amidst the lighthearted moments, the book takes a poignant turn in the final chapter as Christopher Robin and Pooh share a heartfelt conversation about the inevitability of growing up.

Set in 19th-century Sweden, the novel portrays the societal norms and constraints that restrict women’s choices. Many lives are interwoven in the book: Karl-Arthur, the preacher with his self-defeating ideals of self-denial and sacrifice, the practical valley girl Anna Svärd, who holds on to her own to the very end and does not want to share with anyone in heaven or on earth, Charlotte Schagerström who lives happily with her husband but still cannot forget Karl-Arthur, the obnoxious Thea Sundler, the “baron of jokes” Göran Löwensköld, a cavalier figure, and the entire Löwensköld family in Karlstad and at Hedeby Farm. The story also weaves in many episodes alongside the plot, fairy tales and folk tales, in Lagerlöf’s characteristic narrative style. It is the last book in the so-called Ring trilogy, published together in English in 1931 as The Ring of the Löwenskölds.

It is a celebratory dramatization of the 1917 October Revolution, one of two films commissioned by the Soviet government to honour the tenth anniversary of the event. Eisenstein used the film to further develop his theories of film structure, using a concept he described as “intellectual montage”, the editing together of shots of apparently unconnected objects in order to create and encourage intellectual comparisons between them. One of the film’s most celebrated examples of this technique is a baroque image of Jesus that is compared, through a series of shots, to Hindu deities, the Buddha, Aztec gods, and finally a primitive idol in order to suggest the sameness of all religions; the idol is then compared with military regalia to suggest the linking of patriotism and religious fervour by the state. In another sequence Alexander Kerensky, head of the pre-Bolshevik revolutionary Provisional Government, is compared to a preening mechanical peacock. Eisenstein’s montage experiments met with official disapproval; the authorities complained that *October* was unintelligible to the masses, and Eisenstein was attacked—for neither the first time nor the last—for excessive “formalism”. He was also required to re-edit the work to expurgate references to Leon Trotsky, who had recently been purged by Joseph Stalin.

Considering the many styles that Picabia painted in, observers have described his career as “shape-shifting” or “kaleidoscopic”. After experimenting with Impressionism and Pointillism, Picabia became associated with Cubism. His highly abstract planar compositions were colourful and rich in contrasts. He was one of the early major figures of the Dada movement in the United States and in France before denouncing it in 1921. He was later briefly associated with Surrealism, but would soon turn his back on the art establishment. Some of his significant works include I See Again in Memory My Dear Udnie and Dances at the Spring.

He also wrote stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child’s Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog. He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his death at the age of 39 in New York City. Although Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century, noted for his original, rhythmic, and ingenious use of words and imagery.

Born in Toulouse, he studied law but later turned to the study of art at the École des Beaux-Arts. He moved to London early in the 20th century and in 1905 received his first commission to illustrate the novels of the Brontë Sisters. During World War I, Dulac produced relief books, but after the war, the deluxe children’s book market shrank, and he turned to magazine illustrations among other ventures, including designing banknotes and postage stamps, most notably those that heralded the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign. His unique artistic style, characterized by intricate details, imaginative landscapes, and a focus on the fantastical, made him one of the most prominent figures in the world of illustration in the 20th century. Some of his notable works include illustrations for The Arabian Nights and The Little Mermaid.

Despite his relatively brief career – he died at age 29 from heart failure after many years of alcohol and drug abuse – he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in country music. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones, among others. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame in 1999, and gained a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2010 he was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for his “craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.” (Wikipedia)\n\nWorks by Hank Williams on Internet Archive\n\nPablo Picasso\n\nPablo Picasso (1881–1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War. Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art. (Wikipedia)\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien (1892–1973) was an English writer and philologist, renowned as the author of high fantasy works, including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. After Tolkien’s death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father’s extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of his books led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused him to be popularly identified as the “father” of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy. (Wikipedia)"
