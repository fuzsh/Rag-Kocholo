It is unclear what the book’s new publication date will be.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment from the Daily Beast.\n\nIn Dawn’s Early Light, Roberts takes on a number of conservative bogeymen—and even adds in a few of his own, according to an advance copy obtained by liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America.\n\nProject 2025 Head’s New Book Rails Against IVF, Abortion and... Dog Parks?\n\nThe topics criticized include in vitro fertilization (IVF), abortion, contraceptives, childless adults, and even dog parks.\n\nThe original release was slated to feature a foreword written by Ohio senator and Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, but it is unclear if he will remain involved in the project moving forward.\n\nThe Trump campaign has tried to distance themselves from Project 2025 in recent weeks. Campaign manager Chris LaCivita even succeeded in a pressure campaign to get the conservative think tank to fire Paul Dans, the former policy director of Project 2025, The Daily Beast first reported last month.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.
