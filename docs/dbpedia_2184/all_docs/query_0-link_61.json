        "text": "Get off your soapbox.\n\nThe message from celebrity doctors and hygiene freaks is clear: It’s cool to be clean.\n\nSocial media has been awash with discourse on bathing culture.\n\nTake the “everything shower” trend in which self-care seekers share their three-hour shower routine.\n\nOr the docs of TikTok that expose the most sullied parts of our bodies.\n\nDespite this newfound love of lather, experts say there’s no need to scrub so much time out of your schedule.\n\n“There is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to washing skin and hair,” Seattle dermatologist Joyce Park told The New York Times in a new report.\n\nIn 2021, researchers at Harvard Health found that 66% of Americans shower every day — more than necessary for some.\n\n“The ideal frequency depends on your skin and hair type, how much you sweat and how dirty you get,” said Park.\n\nIn particular, those who have drier skin or suffer from conditions such as eczema would benefit from taking shorter, less frequent showers as soap and water can weaken the skin’s defenses.\n\n“[I] don’t recommend a prolonged bath or daily showers,” Dr. Julie Russak, a private practice dermatologist in Manhattan, previously told The Post. Hot showers and soaps “really removes and destroys the skin’s microbiome,” which plays a role in protecting the skin and is “also extremely important in overall health of the body.”\n\nThe derms agree that those who otherwise feel the need to shower daily — after work or a workout — should focus “only in the areas that have higher concentrations of sweat accumulation,” Russak said.\n\nThe products you use could also be to blame for skin issues.\n\nDr. Justine Hextall, a consulting dermatologist for cult skincare brand La Roche Posay, warned that a tight, dry complexion could be a sign of a damaged skin barrier, harsh cleanser or using too-hot water.\n\n“If your skin feels dry after washing your face it usually means the cleanser is too harsh, stripping the skin barrier [the outermost layer of the skin] and ultimately leading to moisture loss,” she recently told Metro, explaining that the “squeaky clean” feeling post-cleanse could mean a change in skin pH and, thus, a damaged skin barrier.\n\nStubborn acne, wrinkles, rough patches, dry or scaly skin, itchiness and tenderness or stinging when applying products, are all signs of a damaged skin barrier, according to Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAll of that goes for your sensitive genital area, as well, which requires no more than gentle, fragrance-free cleanser — or “just use water,” as La Jolla, Calif. dermatologist Azadeh Shirazi told the Times.\n\nRachael Gallo, esthetician and Chief Operating Officer of Silver Mirror Facial Bar, previously told The Post that both your moisturizer and cleanser should change with the seasons.\n\n“During the hotter months, change to a gel- or foam-based cleanser to help with the excessive heat and dead skin,” she advised. “In the colder months, switch to a cream cleanser and add one with a milk base for extra hydration.”\n\nGentle cleansers can remove the dirt and debris that accumulates on the surface of the skin without stripping the barrier, experts recommend.\n\nUsing hyaluronic or lactic acid can keep your skin glowing even in frigid weather, while niacinamide can reduce redness, Gallo said. Additionally, SPF, vitamins and moisturizers are a must as the temperatures drop."
