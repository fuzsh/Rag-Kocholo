        "text": "Delta Sleep - The thing that humanity clings to is hope. In the darkness, light will prevail. In uncertain times, prosperity will ultimately endure: without it, there is simply nothing. On âBlue Gardenâ, Delta Sleepâs 4th studio album, out 27th September on Sofa Boy Records & Wax Bodega (US), the band find themselves digging beneath the overwhelming darkness of the world to find just a glimmer of light â tying in similar themes across their expansive back catalogue to become what is perhaps their heaviest record to date.\n\nâBlue Gardenâ was recorded at the tail end of 2023 at Daft Studios in Belgium with Mark Roberts (Black Peaks, Toska, The Physics House Band) after a year of huge tours across America, Asia and Australia. Where previous albums came together quickly, with all four members entering the studio armed with songs demoed, tracked and recorded live, this time the band started with a completely blank page.\n\nThey opted to approach new material collectively within the space of two and a half weeks, jumping at the opportunity to play with new instrumentation at their fingertips to introduce electronic samples and synths. Given the time to really hyper focus on the production resulted in the scope to draw inspiration from the realm of fantasy and the real world that has permeated its way into the band's sound both sonically and visually.\n\nBut itâs âBlue Gardenâsâ lyrical themes which truly razes it into darkness. Underscored by the horrors unfolding in Palestine, it serves as a form of catharsis to a pure sense of helplessness. âSo slowly, I can focus on my needs, to feel good in my body / Because in the end itâs all we got / As we watch the world burn, canât you see that weâre burningâ sings Devin YÃ¼ceil on âSlow Burnâ, posing the question of how you come to terms about dealing with traumatic moments outside of your own personal sphere that you feel powerless and despair.\n\nâIt feels like thereâs a grey cloud over everything thatâs always in the back of your mind. Thereâs this thing happening thatâs not right and itâs clouding any sense of joy or happiness and yet we still have to carry on with our normal lives,â says YÃ¼ceil . âItâs about not knowing what to do and not knowing how to talk about it.â\n\nThroughout, Delta Sleep weave their way through moments of dark and light, interlaced with a sweeping ambience and complex tempos that are inspired by punk, indie and electronic influences yet reminiscent of the math-rock home they belong to. In true Delta Sleep fashion itâs structures and textures are moulded to their sound â on âFigure In The Darkâ itâs the crashing drums juxtaposed with warm harmonies that make it an emotionally purging listen, while the R&B infused rhythms in âThe Distanceâ helps to push this record past the boundaries of anything they have done before. On âSunchaserâ the mood is brought to a heightened crescendo as gorgeous guitar melodies garner a sense of melancholic longing before making way for a chorus that dazzles to life like a beacon of hope.\n\nPaired with the stunning album artwork by Daniele Castellano, who used ideas of shadow in 80s fantasy films and art like The Neverending Story and Peter Pan as a catalyst to capture how world events are casting a shadow of depression, terror and helplessness over us all; and the companion video to album opener âDawnâ, which is a beautiful video highlighting the plight of the Palestinian people while showcasing their history and humanity, puts âBlue Gardenâ into real life perspective.\n\nâShadows are interesting. As a filmmaker youâre always balancing the interplay between light and dark, and particularly, the absence of light can give a lot of depth and contrast to an image. I wanted to explore that in a lyrical sense. Itâs an abstract concept but we were trying to transpose those visual themes onto real life and to look at how they might be relatable within the world of politics,â says YÃ¼ceil.\n\nItâs this perfect storm of creating imagery in their sound that has garnered Delta Sleep a cult following. Take for instance their live album 'Soft Soundsâ which features intimate unplugged performances taken from their back catalogue, alongside a video series that was filmed over the course of four years around the world: in Paris, Tokyo, Turkey, Brooklyn, Dallas, Texas and Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2018, second full length album âGhost Cityâ saw them approach their intelligent songwriting with guitar driven melodies over jazz influenced grooves surrounding the concept of living in a dystopian future where the world is ruled by vast tech companies. 2021âs âSpring Islandâ proved to be an exorcising endeavour wrapped in sonic excellence. It touched on themes of global warming and the effects humans are having on the planet, blending their bleak lyrical content to sit on top of a bed of dizzying, uplifting and complex rhythms.\n\nThe result has been a career thatâs on the rise. Having already charted a #1 record on the Bandcamp Rock Chart and gaining millions of listeners across the globe, the band are set to step out on the road in the US in May and October, followed by a massive co-headline run with peers And So I Watch You From Afar in the UK this winter, as well as appearances at Distrorsioni Festival (Italy) and ArcTanGent.\n\nLike âlistening to a soundtrack to some blissful utopian dreamâ as praised by Gold Flake Paint, âBlue Gardenâ might be their most brooding collection of songs to date, but in all the gloom Delta Sleep signal a sense that joy will return and hope is lying in wait.\n\nâTry to breathe, thereâs no harm in waiting patiently / See you when the sun in shiningâ\n\nMAD CADDIES & AUTHORITY ZEROÂ\n\nwith Special Guest BELVEDERE\n\nMad CaddiesÂ -Â\n\nThe Mad Caddies are a ska punk band from Solvang, California, United States. The band formed in 1995 and has released seven full-length albums, one live album, and two EPs. To date, Mad Caddies have sold over 500,000 albums worldwide.\n\nThe Mad Caddies sound has influences from broad ranging genres including ska (especially ska 3rd wave), punk rock, hardcore punk, reggae, dixieland jazz, Latin music, polka, even cowpunk (\"Crew Cut Chuck\") and sea shanties (\"Weird Beard\").\n\nThe Mad Caddies have released 6 studio albums, 2 EPs and a live album. They've also toured extensively throughout their career including tours across the USA, Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South America. Their most recent full-length release, Punk Rocksteady, was released on June 15th 2018 and was produced by Fat Mike. In 2020 the Caddies released a 5 song EP titled \"House on Fire\" on Fat Wreck Chords.\n\nAuthority ZeroÂ -Â\n\nâAuthority Zero has never been called ânegative.â Even during a pandemic, they kept their collective chin up, put their heads down and wrote what could be called their career album. Released in June 2021, Authority Zeroâs album âOllie Ollie Oxen Freeâ takes a line from hide and seek to encourage fans to leave the COVID-19 depression behind and celebrate life.\n\nDuring the pandemic, singer Jason DeVore saw families torn apart by political views and COVID-19. Now that the divide has somewhat subsided, itâs time to come out and be yourself again. âThe phrasing in the title track stems from the idea of âcome out, come out, wherever you are,ââ says DeVore, who co-writes with bassist Michael Spero. âIt encourages a focus on the positive side of 2020, while still maintaining awareness of the hardships and detriment of it all. People have been trapped within themselves, depressed inside of their houses and otherwise. Weâve been separated both politically and mentally between the left and right, which is very apparent. Itâs a focus of come out, feel free and feel a sense of confidence to live with an unheavy heart and mind again.â\n\nThe title track rattles those cages with DeVoreâs encouraging lyrics, the frenetic blur of Christopher Dalleyâs urgent drumming and Speroâs bass, coupled with guitar licks true to the playing style of returning guitarist Brandon Landelius. With its updated sound, âOllie Ollie Oxen Freeâ fits in with Authority Zeroâs catalog, DeVore says. âItâs more of the times of 2020,â he says. âWe really tried to focus more on the positive side of things that came from the pandemic, rather than the negative that came out of it. âWe inflect lyrics and music in an uplifting manner. We wanted to shine a light at the end of the tunnel.â\n\nBelvedereÂ -Â\n\nFrom the bandâs inception in 1995, Belvedere has continued to push themselves on the road and in the studio. Well over 1000 shows were played in over 25 countries thanks to the help of countless promoters, fans, and friends. Though the band split in 2005, it was clear that these friends would not forget them. In 2011, bridges were mended and reunion shows were announced. Over the next three years Steve, Jason, Scott, and Graham did everything they could to play in as many countries as real life allowed. By the end of 2014, the band decided that it was time to try writing again.\n\nThere were two rules when Belvedere decided to write and record their first album in over 12 years. Have a good time, and donât sound like a bunch of old men..â¦mission accomplished. âThe Revenge Of The Fifthâ picks up where their last release âFast Forward Eats The Tapeâ left off. Twelve tracks of melodic punk â fast and furious. Though fans of the band will feel a sense of nostalgia for the speed and riffage, theyâll also notice a progression in the song writing. Perhaps even a âjuxtapositionâ of maturity from 4 immature punkers. The balancing act between raising families and holding steady jobs, and touring the world for 20 years can be heard in many of the lyrics. âGeneration Debtâ is an apology letter to our children for the world weâve left to them, while âCarpe per diemâ is a summary of basement show tours that spanned the bandâs first six years. An expression of hope is found in âRevenge of the fifthâ which hinges on the idea that weâre all ultimately responsible for taking care of the human race and the planet; and to stop looking to a higher power for forgiveness or answers.\n\nThe addition of Casey Lewis on drums has given the band a new excitement and passion. Fans will be happy to hear the band hasnât slowed down or toned down the shredding. 2016 looks to be a great year as Belvedere will be hitting South America, Europe, Canada and a few other places. Watch out for May 5th, 2016 when Belvedereâs fifth album, âThe Revenge Of The Fifthâ hits the real and digital world.\n\nNILE & SIX FEET UNDER\n\nwith PSYCROPTIC and EMBRYONIC AUTOPSY\n\nSix Feet Under - From the opening moments of âKnow-Nothing Ingrate,â which kicks off Killing for Revenge, itâs immediately clear that Six Feet Under focused their energies into something thatâs as brutal, lyrically visceral and musically dazzling as one would hope for from the ground-breaking Tampa-bred death metal lineup on their 14th studio album.\n\nKilling for Revenge, a gnarly beast of a record thatâs not for the faint-hearted, dishes up nightmare-inducing imagery courtesy of frontman Chris Barnes via the vocalistâs trademark guttural vocals. Both the album title and darkly detailed red-hued album cover by artist Vince Locke are perfect containers for the brutality within. âI chose the title Killing for Revenge after we completed writing and noticed that all the lyrics and storylines had a common theme of revenge. Revenge by human or revenge by natureâor both in the song âBestial Savagery,â which describes the destructive paths of man-made storms,â Barnes says. âThe album title describes the flow of the stories within the lyrics perfectly.âÂ Â\n\nKilling for Revenge marks the second album that Barnes and guitarist Jack Owen (ex-Cannibal Corpse) have created together since reuniting for 2020âs Nightmares of the Decomposed, an album one critic praised an âoften slow-ish and doomy yet crushing death metalâ which offered an âuncompromising show of strength.â Owen also produced Killing for Revenge, with Barnes as production assistant. âWe worked well together in Cannibal Corpse,â Barnes says. âHe was probably my favorite person back then in that band. I loved him to death as a friend and a musician, so I'm really comfortable giving him the reins because I just have such great respect for him as an artist.â\n\nItâs clearly a partnership that works, given the brilliance of Cannibal Corpseâs early work under Barnes and the fact that the Owen-Barnes rekindled symbiotic relationship has breathed new life, or perhaps new death, into Six Feet Under. âI asked Jack to map out what parts of the songs he wanted lyrics for, and he just started writing lyrics instead and gave me a demo vocal track for pretty much all the songs,â Barnes says. âI thought it was great. That's how the music and lyrics wanted to appear this time, so I just let it come through that way and worked with him in a collaborative way. Like we did back in the old days, like on the song âShredded Humansâ.â\n\nSix Feet Under was initially formed as a side project for Barnes during his final years with the band that he co-founded, Cannibal Corpse. It became the frontmanâs sole focus in 1995, coinciding with the release of their debut, Haunted. Only Barnes remains from the original SFU band, but the quality has remained remarkably consistent. The current lineup of Barnes, guitarists Owen and Ray Suhy, bassist Jeff Hughell, and drummer Marco Pitruzzella make for a devastating unit.\n\nWhile Barnes is the sole remaining member, Six Feet Under is about more than he and Owen. The singer is thrilled with the current lineup, and what each member brings to the table. âJeff and Marco have been with me for about 10 years,â Barnes says. âI'm really fortunate that I have probably the best musicians in metal. If you look at it, we have the same amount of original members as Cannibal Corpse. Jeff is a killer bass player. Marcoâs probably the best drummer out there. Jack's the greatest songwriter I've ever been involved with over the 30-plus years I've been doing music professionally. And Ray is just a phenomenal guitarist who can play everything from jazz to death metal. The lineup now is untouchable.â\n\nThe chemistry between the five men is palpable; listening to Killing for Revenge, one could be forgiven for assuming that they hid themselves away somewhere for a couple of months and hammered it out in blessed, creative seclusion. Not the case.âWe all recorded it on our own, in different parts of the country since we're all spread out,â says Barnes. âI think the most important thing is to put everybody in a comfortable space so that they get a great performance. That's what you want to capture. It's really hard nowadays to afford everyone being in the studio recording like we used to back in the â90s. It can be done just as effectively this way.â\n\nThe songs on Killing for Revengeâhighlighted by the singles âKnow-Nothing Ingrate,âÂ âAscensionâ and âWhen the Moon Goes Down in Bloodââdive headfirst into subjects that are as gleefully vile, graphic and downright grotesque as you might dream of from a Barnes/Owen project. After all, the two men were vital cogs in the Cannibal Corpse band that released such delightfully offensive death metal classics as Butchered at Birth and Tomb of the Mutilated. Highlights of this latest Six Feet Under opus include âCompulsive,â which tells the tale of a disturbed individual in a padded cell, eating himself alive: âDisplay of carnage for the poor soul who finds you; To discover sick survival that binds you; Heaving lungs the only thing intact; Scattered expelled organs your final act.â\n\nâJack wrote 90 percent of the lyrics on this album, and that was one that he came up with the storyline to,â says Barnes. âHow you want to interpret it is up to you. You can find deeper meaning or metaphors or symbolisms. But I would say a good interpretation is someone suffering who is devouring himself. You could look deeper as it being about addiction.â\n\nThe album opener, âKnow-Nothing Ingrate,â launches Killing for Revenge as the LPâs first single.Â\n\nâI kind of went back and forth on what song should be the first one to throw out into the world,â says Barnes. âJack liked the idea of âKnow-Nothing Ingrateâ as the first single as well.â\n\nâKnow-Nothing Ingrateâ was written early in the album process. âWe wanted to keep the aggression of a prior Six Feet Under song like âAmputator,â explains Owen. âI wrote music in the style of early Dark Angel or Kreator, who always had cool driving drum beats. I had all the riffs in my head as I wrote the drums in a couple hours. Lyrically, It's basically about online trolls who voice their uneducated and unnecessarily spiteful review of any artist's output. You're entitled to your opinion, and I'm entitled to mine.â\n\nSix Feet Under also recorded a cover of Nazareth's \"Hair of the Dog,\" which appears on all formats of Killing for Revenge with the exception of vinyl. ââHair of the Dogâ has such a heavy groove to it and the vocal is so killer and memorable that it seemed like a perfect fit for us, and something fun to add to the album as a bonus track,â explains Barnes. âPlus thereâs cowbell!â Clearly, 2024 is shaping up to be a massive year for Six Feet Under, and Barnes hopes to take full advantage.âI'd like to get a tour put together,â he says. âI would love to get back out on the road. It's been too long. Three of those years were due to the pandemic. I love being on the road. I love being in a tour bus and being in front of people on stage. I have missed it so much. It's what I was meant to do.â"
