        "text": "A\n\nAard\n\nA telekinetic thrust that can be used to stun, repel or disarm an opponent.\n\nActive Jasper\n\nA precious stone that can provide warmth, energy, balance and the courage to right wrongs.\n\nAedirn\n\nOne of the Four Kingdoms, lying between Temeria and the Mahakam Mountains to the west and the Blue and Fiery Mountains to the east. It is where Yennefer first served as a mage.\n\nAedirnian Weapons\n\nThe sword, scabbard and belt; polearm; and dagger and sheath are common weapons for combatants from the kingdom of Aedirn.\n\nHow The Witcher Brought the Aeschna Monster to LifeHint: It involved using pool noodles.\n\nAeschna\n\nA muscular amphibian with rough skin, a viciously spiked tail and corrosive, acidic green saliva that makes it good at killing.\n\nAevenien\n\nIthlinne’s widowed mother, proprietor of the Drunken Goat tavern in Inis Dubh.\n\nAlchemy\n\nAlchemy is closely related to magic and also involves elixirs and potions, but an alchemist would say that their field of study is more scientific. Usually mages as well, alchemists devote their life to the study of metals, the transmutation of matter and the secrets to eternal life. Perhaps the most important and controversial form of alchemy is mutagenic alchemy.\n\nAlvitir\n\nThe newly crowned King of Xin'trea after the death of Mad King Darach, Alvitir’s reign was short. He tried to end the 1000-year war between elves by brokering a peace treaty, but with tragic consequences.\n\nAnica\n\nA student at Aretuza Academy, who attended at the same time as Yennefer, but didn’t show the same magical promise. She was turned into an eel by Tissaia, along with Doralis and Lark. If you didn’t have what it took to support Chaos, you were sacrificed to support the ones who did.\n\nAretuza Academy\n\nA magical academy for women situated on Thanedd Island, with architecture reminiscent of the elves who built it. Notable students include Yennefer, whose time there under the mentorship of Tissaia de Vries formed her future.\n\nArtorius\n\nAn old mage of the Nilfgaardian vassal state of Toussaint, Artorius Vigo is a traditionalist member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and the nepotistic uncle of Fringilla. Artorius was once the chair of the Chapter, where he gained influence by preaching conservative ideas, though he lost his power by refusing to adapt with the times. He found it hard to choose sides as conflict captured the Continent, but his passivity was what led to the burning of Cintra — paving the way for Tissaia and Vilgefortz to gain influence in the aftermath.\n\nAvallac’h\n\nA lower ranked mage amongst the Xin’trean palace mages, young Avallac’h was content with his position, but destiny had other plans. After inadvertently saving the Empress from an assassination attempt, Merwyn entrusted Avallac'h with the task of retrieving Syndril’s book of monoliths from Balor, with the intention of trapping the Chief Sage in another world. Avallac'h found the book, but it was obvious to Balor that the young mage was behind the theft. Balor lashed out at this young upstart. Avallac'h fought back but barely survived their encounter. Unwittingly he had now forced Eredin to act, choosing Merwyn’s side, and leading to the imprisonment of Balor. Avallac’h was now at the core of Merwyn and Eredin’s plan to conquer other worlds. His study of Syndril’s Book Of Monoliths led him to discover its other power, the magical equation for time travel. Avallac’h’s influence on the Continent was just getting started.\n\nAxii\n\nA hypnosis sign that can be used on all creatures to manipulate their thoughts, whether to get them to do what you want, play mind games or even just calm a skittish horse.\n\nB\n\nBa’lian & Dermain\n\nA roughed up pair of elven refugees who were forced to sacrifice flesh and family in exchange for freedom. The brave duo escaped violent roundups in the North and sought refuge where they could find it. Their journey to the Sandpiper led them through a Gors Velen aqueduct where they ran into Yennefer, Cahir and a hungry zeugl. Even though Ba’lian didn’t want to go down without a fight, he fled when the deaf Dermain was dragged into the deep.\n\nBalor\n\nChief Sage and adviser to the king with an insatiable thirst for power, Balor staged a coup against Xin'trea’s Mad King and established the new Golden Empire.\n\nBalor didn’t like to talk of his past. But it was common knowledge at court that Balor was low-born, discovered by a mage after he mysteriously survived the burning of a feudal village. It was clear he was special; the mage took him to Xin’trea to school him further.\n\nA prodigy with magic, Balor soon caught the eye of “Mad King” Darach. His unconventional ways with magic made him a favorite of the unhinged King, much to the chagrin of the inner chamber of mage advisers.\n\nBalor adored order and despised the chaos and chance that is often found in elven mages’ earthen and celestial magic. Although he was wary at first, Balor found the theories of a shunned young Darwenish druid, Syndril Cullwyn, fascinating. They offered something in magic he had not seen before: logic — mathematical corridors and shapes applied to the wild earth/celestial magic. And so Balor took Syndril as his own apprentice and encouraged his experiments. When Darach’s son Alvitir tried to end the 1000-year conflict between elves, Balor seized the opportunity to stage a coup. Using Syndril’s magical equations to adapt the ancient dwarven monoliths he had raised, Balor was able to cross into another world, where he encountered the lure of chaos magic and used the gift of a terrifying beast from a mysterious lifeforce there to return to his own world and wipe out the Xin'trean, Darwenian and Pryshian royal families and clans sworn to protect them. Knowing his lowborn status in this classist society, he installed Merwyn as Empress of the new Golden Empire, as a puppet the people would accept. But, Balor was the real power behind the throne.\n\nMerwyn tried to wrest power from Balor by siding with Eredin, the Golden Empire High Commander, but ultimately failed. Hungry for greater power, Balor sacrificed Fenrik, his only true friend, to a powerful force from another world. In doing so he became the first elf to harness both natural and chaos magic. As a means of revenge he trapped Eredin and his followers in another realm, but was ultimately defeated and killed when his own chaos magic was amplified by Zacaré and Syndril using the monolith and turned against him.\n\nZacaré and Syndril were able to defeat Balor and destroy the master monolith but unwittingly triggering the Conjunction of the Spheres, forever altering the Continent and bringing humans and beasts to the planet.\n\nBan Ard\n\nA prestigious magical academy for boys, located in the Kaedwen city of Ban Ard.\n\nBarrel\n\nA deeply complicated dwarven game that used decorated playing cards.\n\nBasilisk\n\nA foul-breathed member of the draconid family commonly found in or near the Zerrikanian desert. Basilisks are dragons’ little siblings, though you might not see the resemblances instantly, because a basilisk’s body is a hodgepodge of different animal shapes and species. They have scaled bodies, sharp fangs, webbed wings and V-shaped legs — distinctive snake and bird features. Much like birds, basilisks can have different feather colors. In battle, a basilisk’s snakelike tail is not to be underestimated. A good tail whacking can send even the strongest witchers flying through brick walls. And whack you they will. They generally don’t need a reason to attack humans. They have toxic breath, a venomous bite and wings they use to attack prey — even though they can’t fly very far. Even their stare can be fatal, which is why using a mirror to show basilisks their own reflection is a good way to kill them. Though it might be wiser to use a silver weapon and aim for the head.\n\nBasilisk, Mutated\n\nThe basilisk’s mutated sibling, created through old magic. Equally dangerous, but even more ghastly, thanks to deformed talons, curved tusks and weathered wings. This basilisk is one of a kind, appearing only in the mountain pass near the elven academy. But it shares its deadliness with the original basilisk.\n\nBattle of Sodden Hill, The\n\nAfter the Slaughter of Cintra, Nilfgaard continued to march north, pillaging and burning every village in their tracks. None of the other kingdoms, nor the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, were willing to risk their lives to stop the Nilfgaardian army. Instead, a defiant group of mages, including Tissaia, Yennefer and Vilgefortz, faced Nilfgaard, unsure if their attempt would be futile. Fourteen mages, with Yennefer believed to be among them, died at the battle, but Nilfgaard was defeated — in the battle, at least, if not the war.\n\nBestiary\n\nThe beasts of the Continent are legion, and each has its own distinctive power, motivation and vulnerability. While most humans would like to rid “their” land of these nuisances, Geralt, for one, realizes that not all beasts deserve to die, and not all humans deserve to live. Whether all the creatures in the Witcher universe, both malevolent and benevolent, should be seen as monsters is open to interpretation.\n\nLearn More About the Beasts of the Continent in The Witcher\n\nBinding Spell\n\n“Heiv eip, gröm eip!” “Bring together, bind together!”\n\nBioluminescent Moss\n\nGlowing moss used by elves and dryads to illuminate dark places. Safer and cleaner than a naked flame.\n\nBlood Tracing\n\nAn age-old and relatively simple practice that allows the tracer to determine a person’s geographic location.\n\nBod An Domhain\n\nBrought to the continent by the explorer, Solryth and also known as Staff of the World, this powerful ceremonial staff was held by the Chief Sage, the highest magic office in the Xin’trean kingdom. It was Balor’s most treasured possession — a representation of all he was and all he’d gained — but he nevertheless sacrificed for a taste of the chaotic power from another world. The staff, however, was not enough: ultimately, he had to pay a far greater price to wield Chaos.\n\nThe inscription read:\n\n“I am the echo of stars past, and those yet to shine.”\n\nBone Caves\n\nIn the caves below the Tower of the Gull is an enormous collection of elven skulls and bones; the walls of the cave and its immense pillars are literally lined with them. Like many places on the Continent, Aretuza was built on the foundations of an ancient elven civilization like we see in The Witcher: Blood Origin.\n\nBorch Three Jackdaws\n\nBorch was a strange man who refused to carry a weapon. While he could be called a pacifist, his two Zerrikanian bodyguards — Téa and Véa — were definitely not. As the last of the gold dragons, Borch was very careful when traveling, rarely revealing his natural form. He was always disguised as a jovial man, no matter how skilled he was in the art of polymorphism. Borch had lived a very long time, gathering heaps of life experience. He tended to share his nuggets of wisdom with Geralt, whether the witcher asked for them or not. As much as Geralt hates a lecture, he recognizes the truth when he hears it. Without Borch, Geralt might never have returned to Cintra to seek out Ciri.\n\nBotany\n\nBotany is a core part of the magical experience, every magic student learns about nature’s medicine cabinet and all practicing mages pull from it. Witchers also have substantial knowledge of botany as they are, to a large extent, responsible for the creation of their elixirs. Each has its particular (poisonous) traits and purposes, so knowing where to find the right ingredients and how to apply them properly is paramount.\n\nBrían\n\nBorn into the merchant class, with a taste for the finer things in life, Brían worked his way to a position of comfort and influence. He was a secret lover of Eredin, the High Commander of the Golden Empire army, as relationships between warrior and Merchant classes were forbidden. Empress Merwyn used their relationship — and, more specifically, the secret information Brían was privy to - as a way of blackmailing Eredin into her service.\n\nBrokilon\n\nAn ancient forest queendom inhabited by dryads; it’s the only remaining nonhuman state in the northern kingdoms. Magical waters run through Brokilon Forest, they have the power to heal and erase memories of pain and suffering endured. Newcomers must drink the waters — if they have ill intent, they’ll die; if they are pure of heart, they’ll survive. As war begins to consume the Continent, Brokilon becomes a safe space for the persecuted to find refuge.\n\nBrother Death\n\nCallan, better known as Brother Death, was a damaged former soldier. He fled from war and found himself lost in Zacaré’s mists. Brother Death was able to find peace with Zacaré, and the two outsiders to society became lovers. Although tired of war and bloodshed, Brother Death joined Éile and Fjall when he discovered they were taking on the hated Golden Empire, their soldiers having wiped out a village of innocents he cared for. He lost an eye while trying to restrain the bestial version of Fjall, but survived.\n\nBrotherhood, The\n\nThe Brotherhood of Sorcerers, established in 839, is the oldest and most influential organization of mages on the Continent. Its inaugural members were the ones who drafted the Laws of Magic — the rules and guiding principles that dictate how Chaos should be used responsibly. Fire magic, demonology, necromancy, to name a few, were forbidden by law, and the Brotherhood saw to it that their members abided. Those who didn’t could face serious repercussions, like incarceration, banishment or dimeritium chains.\n\nBrugge\n\nNear Brokilon Forest and just north of the Yaruga River lies Brugge, one of Cintra’s vassal states.\n\nBruxa\n\nBruxas are creatures with range, both vocally and visually. They’re capable of beautiful deceptions and beastlike brutality. In human form, the bruxa is often an attractive young woman — a look that undoubtedly helps her when charming victims. Her huge eyes and pale skin may appear harmless, but this stone-cold parasite is far from that — she’s a vampire-like predator who thirsts for human blood. She’s small in stature but grand in grotesqueness.\n\nIn her natural form, the bruxa is extremely nimble. She can crawl and climb like a spider, maneuvering tight spaces to become almost invisible. Her frame may be small, but when she flaps out her webbed wings, dislocates her jaw to bare her needled teeth and flies at you, she’s quite a horror to behold.\n\nThe bruxa is often in a secluded location, but she tries never to be too far from a host. She can only shape-shift into a beautiful woman, but her powers don’t stop there. She can communicate without being heard and move without being seen, and her huge wings make her dangerous in battle. When her jaw is disengaged, she can create a blast strong enough to seriously injure humans.\n\nHow can she be defeated? A silver weapon is key, and a beheading works best. You’ll know the job is done when a bruxa spontaneously catches fire.\n\nC\n\nCahir\n\nCahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach is a Nilfgaardian soldier who reports directly to the Emperor. He was the mastermind behind the attack on Cintra, and his prime directive was to capture Ciri. But he failed to disclose this to his magical counterpart, Fringilla, as both of them were competing for power and the Emperor’s approval.\n\nAfter the Battle of Sodden Hill, Cahir was captured by the mages. They brought him back to Aretuza, where he was questioned, tortured and eventually sentenced to die. Yennefer, who was supposed to execute his sentence, ended up sparing his life. By way of Redanian sewer and Sandpiper transport, Cahir finally made his way back to Cintra, where he continued to plot and scheme his way into Emhyr’s good graces.\n\nCahir’s Sword and Scabbard\n\nCahir’s single-edged sword serves one purpose: hacking and slashing. Notice that the guard bends in opposite directions and the pommel has a sort of jewel shape, simple yet sophisticated. The wavy edge of the blade is both tactical and economical. This cut-out design uses less steel, making the blade lighter to handle and cheaper to produce. It’s a standard-issue falchion sword with purely decorative curves. One weapon serves all Nilfgaardian soldiers, Cahir is no exception.\n\nCaingorn\n\nThe northernmost part of the Continent, this kingdom at the foot of a treacherous mountain range is bordered by Barefield, Malleore and Creyden, and is a hotspot for eager dragon hunters.\n\nChaos\n\nChaos is the most potent force on the Continent — and the most difficult one to control. Elves were the first to experiment with it, but they weren’t the only magical beings in the history of the Continent. There were other magical races — such as dryads — magical creatures and, eventually, magical humans. Magical humans are rare, though, and they usually go through years of training at either Aretuza or Ban Ard to master a level close to that of elven mages. If magical power remains unchecked, especially in a Source, it can become dangerous. But, with proper training, it’s possible to master skills such as healing, teleportation, destruction, illusion and shape-shifting. It’s also possible to create certain magical items, such as amulets — witcher medallions are a prime example.\n\n“Magic is organizing Chaos. And while oceans of mystery remain, we’ve deduced that this requires two things: balance and control. Without them, Chaos will kill you.” —Tissaia\n\nWhat Is Chaos Magic?\n\nChapter, The\n\nThe Brotherhood was primarily a northern affair. It was controlled by a group of 12 mages called the Chapter, magical delegates from different realms, institutions and layers of society. The Chapter met regularly to discuss matters of state, the placement of young mages and whether or not to intervene in human affairs.\n\nIt was always the Chapter’s goal to remain neutral, but, of course, even mages were susceptible to bias and prejudice — they were, after all, human too.\n\nChernobog\n\nA beast from another dimension, black like the crevice it came from and brutal beyond compare. Unlike other beasts and magical monsters, the Chernobog didn’t arrive during the Conjunction of the Spheres. It entered our world much later, mysteriously through a crack in the destroyed monolith near Cintra, proof that other spheres are still out there.\n\nEverything about the Chernobog screams intimidation: Its sheer size. Its black exoskeleton. Its piercing yellow eyes. Its enormous claws, which are attached to long, muscular arms capable of grabbing a grown horse. And as having a hide that can barely be pierced isn’t challenging enough, the Chernobog also has the airspace advantage. With two giant webbed wings, it can swap solid ground for open air in a flash, attacking enemies ferociously from above.\n\nThe only way to kill this screeching, clawing, flying beast is to take a dagger or another sharp weapon to the weak spot in its exoskeleton.\n\nCidaris\n\nLocated along the western shores of the Continent, the country owes its prosperity to its maritime trade and shipping industry.\n\nCintra\n\nA powerful country known for its strong military force and its virtuous monarchy, Cintra is the realm that separates the northern realms from the Nilfgaardian Empire. Originally an elven city named Xin’trea, Cintra was once the only nation standing between Nilfgaard and the rest of the northern realms — until, that is, it was sacked and captured by Nilfgaard, leading to the death of its queen, Calanthe, and the escape of Princess Ciri.\n\nCiri, or Princess Cirilla\n\n“The Lion Cub” of Cintra, Princess Cirilla goes by Ciri. She’s an orphaned Child of Elder Blood, a Source, the sole heir to the Cintran throne and the first woman trained in the skills of a witcher.\n\nSmart, strong and willful, with incredible magical powers that she had yet to discover, Ciri had what could be considered a charmed life as a girl, despite losing both her parents in a storm at sea when she was just an infant. She was the pride and joy of her grandmother, Queen Calanthe, and her strong will and self-sufficiency were as much a part of her DNA as her big green eyes. But everything changed when Cintra was seized by Nilfgaardian forces, and Ciri was forced to flee the only home she’d ever known and live like a fugitive, running from those who meant to use her for their own power-hungry purposes or — worse — kill her.\n\nDespite her hardships, Ciri remained determined to build a new life for herself. In fact, when Destiny brought her and Geralt together, she seized the opportunity to train as a witcher like her newfound father figure. At Kaer Morhen, Ciri was introduced to a different way of life, one of swords, spells and endless studying.\n\nAs the prophesied Child of Elder Blood, and the sole heir to Cintra, Ciri was arguably the most important person on the Continent. Humans wanted her title, witchers wanted her blood, elves wanted her Chaos — but all stakes were upped when we discovered her own father actually mysteriously survived the shipwreck, and had risen to the role of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard – and he too was after her. She was the key to the destruction of the old world and the birth of the new, the descendant of Lara Dorren and the living epitome of Falka: fierce, remarkable women who were swallowed up by men afraid of their power — women whom Ciri was destined to avenge.\n\nAfter her harrowing encounter at Kaer Morhen with Voleth Meir, Ciri goes into hiding with Geralt and Yennefer while agents from across the Northern Kingdoms and Nilfgaard try to track her down. The rogue mage Rience comes close, using a Jackapace to track Ciri’s blood while she’s distracted by the Belleteyn festival. Afterwards, Ciri’s treasured family is divided: Geralt sets out to track Rience down before he can strike again, while Yennefer takes Ciri to Aretuza to refine her control of Chaos.\n\nThis proves to be a mistake. Aretuza is attacked and Ciri is almost captured by Emperor Emhyr’s forces. In a desperate move, Ciri escapes through the unstable portal in Tor Lara, finding herself stranded in the Korath desert. After a grueling period of hunger, despair and wild visions of her powerful female ancestors, Ciri is eventually led to safety by a mysterious unicorn she christens ‘Little Horse’ – whose life she saves, though it leads to her renouncing her magical powers once and for all’ Alone, hunted, and still under threat, Ciri finds sanctuary with a band of young outlaws known as The Rats, joining their ranks under the pseudonym Falka.\n\nCiri’s Quarters\n\nThe room from Yennefer’s perfect-little-family vision and Ciri’s residence in Kaer Morhen. It’s the first room that she truly got to call home since fleeing Cintra. She didn’t have much to work with — a cot, some mold and an inscription from a homesick boy — but added her own decorative touch: the skin of her first kill. A rat.\n\nCiri’s Steel Short Sword\n\nA blunt short sword inspired by Romanesque design. Light enough for tireless training, but heavy enough to prepare her for the real deal.\n\nCiri’s Wooden Training Sword\n\nStandard issue witcher training sword. Blunted but still capable of inflicting pain. Similar in weight balance and design to the wooden variant.\n\nClans of Blood Origin\n\nThe clans — Dog, Raven and Serpent — have existed as royal bodyguards since the dawn of time, even before the 1,000 Year War started. They are loyal to no one apart from the monarchs they protect. The clans of the three kingdoms have developed their own styles of combat, armor and strategy over the millennia.\n\nAlthough they protect monarchs who are technically at war with each other, the clans hold a grudging respect for each other. They have clashed directly on occasions when kings and queens decide to leave the safety of their thrones to take to the battlefield. But the clan’s objective in battle is solely to keep the king and queen alive. They don’t work in concert with, or answer to the military. Clans don’t care for the outcome of the battle itself. Military tactics on the field, territory gained or lost are just distractions from their sole purpose: Protect the monarch at all costs. Three of the clans are associated with different geographical kingdoms. In Xin’trea in the West, there is Dog Clan; in Pryshia in the North, is Raven Clan; and in Darwen in the South, there’s the Serpent Clan.\n\nWhat Are the Clans?\n\nCodringher and Fenn\n\nPartners in (solving) crime, this multi-hyphenate duo deals in knowledge and knows where to find it. Codringher and Fenn were in the business of information: gathering, knowing, revealing and even burying it, for the right price. While Codringher acted as the face of the business, Fenn stayed buried in her research. Neither of them had ever been presented with a mystery as all-encompassing as the one Istredd brought to their attention. Together, Istredd, Codringher and Fenn dug up what Calanthe so desperately tried to hide: the truth of Ciri’s lineage and its linkage to the Lara gene.\n\nCoen\n\nA young and not-yet bitter witcher who helped train Ciri, Coen is easily recognized by his mismatched eyes. One of the youngest witchers at the keep, but a core part of the Kaer Morhen family, Coen is a skilled sword fighter, though not one to boast about it. Lambert is one of his closest friends. They often pull pranks and tell crude jokes, but unlike Lambert, Coen always knows when enough is enough. He formed a special bond with Ciri when she was living at Kaer Morhen.\n\nCommon Speech\n\nAll humans speak Common Speech (some better than others), but you’ll be able to tell a Kaedwenian from a Skelligen and a Cintran from a Kovirian based on their local dialects and unique colloquialisms.\n\nThe Conclave\n\nConjunction of the Spheres, The\n\nBeyond heralding the arrival of new beings and monsters to the Continent, the Conjunction allowed Chaos to take root across all of the races. Following this event, the newly arrived humans could become mages and witchers, and they sought to assert dominance over the Elder Races that had always inhabited the land.\n\nContinent, The\n\nThis is where the universe of The Witcher is situated: where elves, humans, witchers, gnomes and monsters battle to survive and thrive — and where good and evil aren’t easily identified. The regions of the Continent include Aedirn, Brokilon, Brugge, Caingorn, Cidaris, Cintra, Creyden, Dol Blathanna, Kaedwen, Korath, Lyria and Rivia, Redania, Riverdell, Skellige, Temeria and the Nilfgaardian Empire, which covers the southern half of the Continent.\n\nCorpse-nettle\n\nCommon herb used in Syndril and Zacaré’s elixir.\n\nCorpse Oil\n\nPoison which, when applied to blades, resulted in a slow, agonizing death. Only magical intervention could prevent its effects.\n\nCouncil Room\n\nSituated at Aretuza Academy, this is a small room where big decisions are made. This is where the 12 Chapter members meet to discuss — and decide — the future of the Continent.\n\nCoup, The Golden Empire\n\nIn the time before the Conjunction of the Spheres, during the 1,000 Year War, the majority of the lowborn elves were becoming restless, and the monarchies could feel it. There were rumors of peace between kingdoms, but the military and the mage classes were not keen on relinquishing their power in a world where every elf knew their place and birth role in society and acted accordingly.\n\nChief Sage Balor used Alvitir’s peace treaty to rally these disgruntled mages and generals from the kingdoms to wipe out all the royal families, establishing Xin'trean princess Merwyn as the empress of a new, unified Golden Empire.\n\nCreyden\n\nA small northern kingdom of little importance near the Caingorn Mountains, this vassal state fell under the rule of Kovir and Povis, was home to Princess Renfri and was where Stregobor came to “treat” Fredefalk’s daughter for the Curse of the Black Sun, a story that resonates with Geralt early on in his career as a Witcher.\n\nCurse of the Black Sun, The\n\nA seemingly ordinary solar eclipse that was interpreted as a dark omen by some. Stregobor thought that the eclipse was a sign of demon goddess Lilit’s return. He believed that women born during this eclipse were the foretold “60 women wearing gold crowns who would fill the river valleys with blood” and should thus be eradicated. To do so, he conducted horrible experiments, including confinement, starvation, mutations and operations. Renfri is the only one who survived Stregobor’s torture.\n\nD\n\nDaedwode\n\nOld mining town in former Pryshia with a well-established dwarven bank. Éile, Fjall and Scían attempted to rob the bank, but were cornered by Golden Empire forces. They escaped, but not before Scían was wounded by a blade poisoned with corpse oil.\n\nDara\n\nAn orphaned elven boy who crosses paths with Ciri near a Cintran refugee camp and eventually finds himself in Francesca’s circle of trustees. Dara lost his family in Filvandrel’s Uprising, a rebellion that was squashed by Queen Calanthe. Orphaned and expelled from his homeland, Dara was forced to roam the Continent. He ended up in a Cintran refugee camp and stumbled upon Ciri, not knowing who she was. Both in search of safety and security, they decided to look for it together.\n\nAfter helping Ciri survive an altercation with a doppler, Dara decided to keep himself safe and part ways with Ciri in the forest. Not much later, he found himself in Redania, caught up in soaring anti-elven sentiments. Soldiers eventually rounded him up with countless other elves and locked them away in prison camps. On the condition that Dara secretly reported to Dijkstra, he was released and sent to reunite with the free elves in Cintra — a deal that would come to cost Dara more than he bargained for.\n\nDeglan\n\nDeglan was raised on the harsh and unforgiving Skellige Islands. A rough childhood and an even more grueling witcher training made him the hardened warrior-leader that he was. Wearing his characteristic wyvern cloak, he’d roam the Continent looking for coin and potentially some new recruits, Vesemir being one of his proudest enlistments.\n\nLike those before him, Deglan was undoubtedly a devout leader. He would’ve done anything for his boys. He also understood that witchers need monsters. So when the latter were on the brink of extinction, he opted for an unorthodox approach: creating hybrids through mutation. He’d hoped that these hybrids would create jobs for his boys, but that plan backfired miserably. His zeal for the continuation of The Path meant its inevitable end. Kaer Morhen was brought to rubble, Deglan died defending it, and the knowledge needed to create new witchers was lost. Vesemir was tasked with rebuilding the fortress and keeping the tradition alive — which ultimately led to his fortuitous introduction to Ciri.\n\nDemonology\n\nOne of the three types of Forbidden Magic, this was the practice of summoning creatures from other spheres, across time and space. Strictly speaking, Ciri unintentionally (and unknowingly) dabbled in demonology. Her outbursts activated the monoliths and let creatures like the Myriapod and the Chernobog enter the Continent.\n\nDestiny\n\nThe Law of Surprise is closely linked to the concept of Destiny. Most humans believe Destiny is a binding force. One that can bring people together, keep them apart, make them rich, or inflict great pain. Others (read: Geralt) have a more down-to-earth view: They see Destiny as a construct, merely meant to help people make sense of things that otherwise don’t. Mousesack challenged Geralt on that belief, explaining to him that you can try to ignore Destiny, but you’ll never be able to outrun it. As Nenneke says to Geralt, “The difference between Destiny and fate is choice.”\n\nDevil’s Nettle\n\nA feathery plant with small pale flowers. It’s said to stop bleeding and promote healing. It’s extra potent in combination with Golden Oriole and knitbone.\n\nDijkstra\n\nDijkstra’s relationship with Philippa Eilhart — itself a game of power and dominance — eventually leads to the mysterious assassination of King Vizimir of Redania. His younger brother, Radovid, is placed on the throne instead – which starts a rift between Dijkstra and Philippa.\n\nDimeritium\n\nDimeritium is a particularly nasty metal for mages — it drains their powers and its effects don’t wear off instantly. A magical human exposed to dimeritium can feel depleted for some time. As such dimeritium isn’t particularly useful as a weapon — no more than a regular metal — but all the more effective when forged into handcuffs or prison cells, like the one in which Rience was kept.\n\nDjinn\n\nAn elusive air demon trapped in our sphere and coveted throughout for its ability to grant wishes. Djinns are incredibly powerful creatures, both wanted for their wishes and feared for their fickle nature. As they are air demons, there isn’t much of an outward appearance to describe — a djinn simply looks like a gust of wind or black dust that has a will of its own. Should you ever go looking for one, don’t do it without the proper amphora at hand. Once captured, djinns are proverbially bound to their master — forced to fulfill three wishes before being free once more.\n\nFound in ruins, graveyards, deserts or amphoras, djinns are known for granting wishes (three in total, each one leaving a bloody mark on your flesh as it’s granted, so be careful what you wish for); wreaking havoc, using the power of the wind; attacking, or “marking” victims; and even, if rarely, taking possession of your body. Djinns don’t need to be killed to be vanquished — simply utter the third and final wish and watch them disappear.\n\nDog Clan\n\nBodyguards to the monarchs of Xin'trea, Dog clan, as with all clans, were versed in every weapon known to Elfkind. But they specialized in the Battle Axe - a brutal double-headed axe, commonly slung across their backs. Their combat style was brutal; raw power and bludgeoning force. Although the kingdom of Xin'trea was a patriarchal monarchy, there have been female Dog Clan Chieftains.\n\nDol Blathanna\n\nThe words Dol Blathanna are Elder Speech for “The Valley of the Flowers,” and this kingdom was the last elven stronghold. It was a sacred elven kingdom, said to be the only place where feainnewedd naturally grows. Elves were forced to leave during the Great Cleansing, and it is where Geralt and Jaskier were captured while on a job hunting a “devil.” Dol Blathanna eventually becomes a symbol for “home” — any place where elves can live peacefully and rule themselves again.\n\nDol Dusza\n\nTranslating roughly to “Valley of the Soul,” Dol Dusza is a practice that allows a skilled mage to enter the deepest layer of consciousness and uncover things that might be hidden there. Genetic memories, generational imprints that tell the story of who you really are and where you really come from. Triss used it on Ciri to figure out where her powers came from.\n\nDoppler\n\nWhat is there to say about a creature that can take on any human form? A doppler is a unique being with a magnificent gift for metamorphosis and an unquenchable thirst for beauty. Its appearance could resemble literally anyone’s. In its “default” form, the doppler looks like a blueish goblin — or a person suffering from severe frostbite perhaps. Its skin looks rough, veiny and damaged; its eyes are bloodshot. But it’s unlikely that you’ll encounter a doppler in this form, as they’re generally said to be a kind and loving creature as long as you treat them equally well.\n\nThe doppler possesses an almost kneadable figure that allows it to change into shapes similar to its own. When it takes on another form, a doppler doesn’t just copy that shape, they copy that being’s memories, voice and behaviorisms too.\n\nThey like to live near or among humans, and can pick any shape to adopt; they also “collect” parts, building a perfect specimen to inhabit. Should you need to defeat a doppler, silver does the trick, causing an allergic reaction of sorts that scorches its skin.\n\nDoralis\n\nA student at Aretuza Academy who attended at the same time as Yennefer but didn’t show the same magical promise. She was turned into an eel by Tissaia, along with Anica and Lark. If you didn’t have what it took to support Chaos, you were sacrificed to support the ones who did.\n\nDruids\n\nLike mages and witchers, druids are a type of magical human and are known for being scholars of the forest. Though less versed in the arts of magic than mages, druids are still capable of healing and other more rudimentary forms of magic; they have an extensive knowledge of all living things.\n\nDrunken Goat Tavern\n\nA popular lowborn tavern in Inis Dubh, owned by Aevenien. Notable for being the childhood home of Ithlinne.\n\nDryads\n\nDryads are an all-female race of forest creatures; a self-sufficient tribe of warriors who live in total unison with nature. They tend to be very hostile toward humans — especially those who disregard the rules of the forest — though some human women are allowed to stay for protection, like Milva. How, or when, dryads exactly came to be on the Continent is unclear. Some say that they are enchanted human women — which would place them in post-Conjunction — while others claim that dryads descend from trees, meaning they could be even older than elves.\n\nAs a result of countless confrontations with humans, dryads retreated from many of their forest homes and created a single settlement in Brokilon forest. As much as they resemble humans physically, they are not like them. Dryads speak Elder Speech and have a sixth sense for magic. They also believe in things beyond human comprehension, like Shan-Kayan, an all-knowing ancient tree located deep in the heart of Brokilon Forest. Those who drink from her waters (the waters of Brokilon) will reveal “their true selves.” Prove yourself to be pure of heart, and the dryads will allow you to stay. Reveal ill intentions, and the waters will be lethal.\n\nAs is to be expected of a tribe of forest nymphs that lives away from “modern” society, dryads don’t rely on steel and metal for weapon-making, but on the materials that Brokilon Forest provides them with. This fact is clearly reflected in their mostly wooden weapons.\n\nDuny\n\nThe nickname for Urcheon of Erlenwald, aka Emperor Emhyr var Emreis; Pavetta’s husband and Ciri’s father. A knight of no renown who was presumed dead but turned out to be the Emperor of Nilfgaard all along. (See also: Urcheon of Erlenwald; Emperor Emhyr var Emreis)\n\nDwarven-Elven Wars\n\nBefore the elves came to power, dwarves controlled most of the lands that became known as Pryshia, Darwen, and Xin'trea. The dwarves were ultimately defeated and driven east into the mountain protectorate of Nolde, but their influence could still be felt: dwarven script adorned the walls of the Xin'trean royal palace, their control of Dwarven steel, and the raising of their sacred monoliths buried throughout the Continent by Balor, eager to repurpose them as gateways to other worlds.\n\nDwarves\n\nDwarves walked on the Continent long before all kinds of monsters did — and they might just be here long after, courtesy of the dwarves’ skill with the sword. Aside from excellent soldiers, dwarves have also produced enviable artisans and successful businesspeople.\n\nWhen it comes to humans, dwarves hold less of a grudge than elves — dwarves and humans even work together in the mines of Temeria. That being said, a dwarf will always choose another Elder Race over humans. Shared enemies make for unlikely friends. As to where one would be most likely to find a dwarf: If the Trail doesn’t yield any results, try the dwarves’ motherland, the vassal state of Mahakam. They also own and run one of the larger banks in Gors Velen.\n\nDwarves are generally a good-humored but quick-tempered lot. Their weapons are a tad bit over the top — just like dwarves — with exaggerated elements and comical details that by no means diminish the weapon’s destructive abilities. Dwarves may be short in stature, but they’re sturdy and muscular, which allows them to wield large, heavy weapons. As one of the other Elder Races, they too have a long-standing history with the Continent. Their enclave in Mahakam happens to be a city rich in metal and mineral deposits, which help them excel in craftsmanship.\n\nE\n\nÉile\n\nAn elite warrior with the voice of a goddess, Éile abandoned her position in the Raven Clan protecting the Pryshian royal family in favor of a life spent as a nomadic musician, hoping to make more changes with words and melodies than by fist or blade.\n\nTo her Chieftain mother, Cethlenn of the Knives, Éile was her greatest disappointment. As a young child, she showed potential not seen in generations of Raven Clan births and was destined to be one of the greatest warriors ever known. Her mother groomed her to take over as chieftain of the clan, over her other six siblings, finding her the most exceptional tutors in the kingdom to hone her talents. One of the tutors she was fostered with, Scían, a mysterious sword master of deadly renown, also played the keyharp. Once Éile rested her hand on the instrument and heard the strings vibrate and sing, she was lost to it forever. This was what she was looking for all her young life. This made sense to her. It was the world in seven notes. By the end of her training she was lost to its magic.\n\nOn return to her clan, Éile was lost. She felt trapped. She had always accepted her fate - being born into the Raven clan, it was an honor people would die for. But the sense that she could make more of a change in the world with songs than with violence was growing bigger. Her mother was devastated when Éile told her that she wanted to be remembered for her music rather than her feats as a warrior. Despite her mother's protestations, Éile could not betray her truth, the burning need to atone for all the death she had brought into the world, by bringing song to the world. Her Chieftain mother banished her daughter from the clan.\n\nÉile became a nomad traveling the harsh lands, slipping across borders into other kingdoms, playing for whoever would listen and living hand to mouth, avoiding the large cities. Choosing instead to bring her song to those who most needed it. This nomadic life shaped her: she became known as The Lark, a bard whose ballads gave hope to lowborn elves.\n\nThat life was shattered when she learned that the rest of her tribe was murdered in a coup orchestrated by Xin'trean sage supreme Balor and Princess Merwyn. Éile’s thirst for vengeance, and guilt for having abandoned her clan at their time of need, led her to make a blade pledge with Fjall, a rival warrior from the Dog Clan. Together, they set about destroying Merwyn’s newly-formed Golden Empire and the monstrous beast that allowed them to maintain control.\n\nOver time, Éile and Fjall’s relationship changed from one of open hostility to respect and, eventually, a love forged in the crucible of war. While preparing for the final battle against Merwyn and Balor, Éile intended to undergo a dangerous magical experiment that would enhance her abilities and give her a chance of slaying Balor’s beast. Fjall, however, realising this would likely kill the warrior he loved, secretly took her place. Éile helped lead an army of sellswords into Xin'trea, where she reclaimed her place as The Lark: a figurehead to the lowborn, who inspired them to action during the final attack on Merwyn’s forces. Their attack was successful, but not without loss. The experiment left Fjall lost to the rising beast inside, and Éile was forced to end his suffering. Neither knew it at the time, but Éile was pregnant with Fjall’s child at the time of his death.\n\nIntroducing Éile of The Witcher: Blood OriginStar Sophia Brown gives us an inside look at her character.\n\nÉile’s keyharp\n\nA musical instrument used by Éile to entertain and inspire the masses. It also doubled as a hiding place for her throwing knives.\n\nÉile’s Silver-Hilted Blades\n\nÉile’s weapon of choice. She was forced to use these to kill Fjall after he fully degenerated into a beast following the final battle in Xin'trea.\n\nEist Tuirseach\n\nA Skelligen jarl, or chief, who became King of Skellige by popular vote and King of Cintra by marriage to Calanthe. Eist is a typical Skelligen, ruggedly handsome, hairy and chatty. So chatty that he even persuaded Calanthe to marry him after countless proposals. Even though Calanthe saw her second husband mostly as an opportunity to strengthen Cintra’s bonds with Skellige, the marriage was a strong and loving one.\n\nEist was a warm step-grandfather to Ciri, loving her like his own flesh and blood, and a dear friend to fellow Skelligen, Mousesack. When Nilfgaard came to conquer Cintra, he rode out to battle beside his queen. But he never saw much action; Eist was instantly killed by an enemy arrow during the fight at Marnadal Valley.\n\nEithné\n\nThe fearless leader of the dryads and protector of Brokilon Forest, Eithné is also known as the Silver-Eyed. Eithné is best described as a “Brokilonian earth mother meets regal bandit queen.” Her unbreakable bond with nature means that she’s respectful to all forest creatures, but not all living creatures — humans have wronged her and her people one too many times.\n\nEven though she’s quick to judge, her judgment is rarely wrong. When meeting Ciri for the first time, she immediately sensed the girl’s magical power. The waters of Brokilon quickly confirmed her hunch and Ciri was allowed to stay — a unique display of dryad hospitality.\n\nElder Blood\n\nThe term Elder Blood, or Hen Ichaer, refers to Lara Dorren’s bloodline, her descendents being children of Elder blood. It was thought that Lara Dorren had ruined everything by “contaminating” her bloodline, but the opposite is true. Ten generations down the family tree, Elder Blood is present in Ciri — a fact that became abundantly clear when her bloodshed caused feainnewedd to sprout. Feainnewedd, which means “Child of the Sun,” is a plant that only grows where Elder Blood is spilled. Those with Elder Blood are sought after because Ithlinne famously prophesied that a child of Elder Blood will save the elves when the world ends.\n\nThe importance of Elder Blood isn’t lost on other races and people either. Witchers, for instance, would like to get their hands on it, too. Elder Blood is one of the key ingredients needed to create witcher mutagens, but Kaer Morhen’s supply and knowledge of how to use it was lost during the sacking.\n\nElder Speech\n\nMost of the mages’ practices were appropriated from elves. Elves built Aretuza, elves taught humans how to control magic. The only way to do so is by using ancient incantations in Elder Speech, also known as Hen Linge.\n\nElixirs\n\nExceptional sword work isn’t always enough against a magical creature. To enhance their chances at winning, witchers take elixirs that have temporary physical effects. There are elixirs for enhanced night vision, extreme smell, superhuman hearing, you name it. Depending on the creature, witchers will create a cocktail of several elixirs that should help in that particular fight. Some of these elixirs can be quite toxic — even to witchers — so they have to be careful when calculating their dosages.\n\nEllyon\n\nAn ancient Elven dialect that was thought to be dead. This language is linked to darker times and therefore not commonly used.\n\nElven Golden Age, The\n\nThe Elven Golden Era, a rich and complex pre-colonized elvish world that was filled with art, music, earth magic, architecture, deep math, high culture, and science. The elves of Blood Origin were post-agrarian and enlightened, with functioning cities, trade, higher education, and a vast history and belief system. They were more well-established as a society than the elves we have met in The Witcher. And because that society was thriving, the young and fertile elves were able to continue their reign by reproducing – a phenomenon that is lost over the following 1200 years.\n\nElves\n\nElves are one of the Elder Races and the first magical creatures on the Continent to control Chaos. Having mastered the art of magic, they were prepared to share their gift with the humans who arrived during the Conjunction — a decision the elves would come to regret. Humans may have been new on the Continent, but they were quick to rule it. Once the humans no longer needed the elves’ teachings, they turned against them. Elves refused to be forced out of their homes and cheated out of their land, but their resistance was futile against the humans’ brute force.\n\n“When the humans arrived, we believed they were like us. Creatures of noble restraint and wisdom. We welcomed them as peers, instead of seeing what they really were… when we fought back, they called it proof. So we met their depravity with self-control. We took the high road — and it led to a mass grave we dug ourselves.” —Francesca Findabair\n\nDuring what we call the Great Cleansing, nearly all young elven warriors were wiped out, killed in cold blood. The remaining elves were forced to live as second-rate citizens, licking their wounds in silence and longing for a chance at retaliation. The gruesome acts of the Great Cleansing irrevocably changed the Continent, explaining the deeply rooted tensions between elves and humans.\n\nIn spite of everything, the elves prefer to stand tall rather than cover their pointed ears and cower in caves. They still firmly believe in a “bright elven future” and will do anything if it ensures the survival of their species — a nigh impossible task given that the fertile segment of their civilization has been eradicated. There hasn’t been a successful elven birth in years, and as their numbers continue to decline, the stakes just keep getting higher.\n\nThe elves believe in a prophecy spoken by Ithlinne Aegli aep Avenien, a prophetess, which says that humans will perish in an ice age while elves will prevail, returning to their former glory through the offspring of Elder Blood.\n\nElven culture emphasizes balance — between all living things, between Order and Chaos — and honoring their elders. Elves will never forget where they come from, nor will they neglect their heritage. Transformational figures in elven history are adored and honored throughout the community. Perhaps the elves’ extremely long lifespans have something to do with their legends and stories persisting throughout history. Legends don’t die when those who lived them are still telling the tales hundreds of years later.\n\nEmperor Emhyr var Emreis\n\nThe ruler of the Nilfgaardian Empire, Emperor Emhyr’s thirst for power was felt through every inch of land the Nilfgaardian army took over and every move his puppets made in his play for world domination. But who was the Emperor? Unbeknownst to many, he was once known as Lord Urcheon, the cursed hedgehog man who’d come to Cintra to claim Princess Pavetta by Law of Surprise. Urcheon, or Duny, had saved Cintra’s King Roegner from death years ago and later fell in love with his daughter. Only after Duny nearly died and Pavetta had revealed her pregnancy did Calanthe agree to the union. Sadly, the pair’s wedded bliss was short-lived because a raging storm at sea was thought to have taken both of their lives some years later.\n\nAs Cintra mourned the loss of Pavetta and Duny fell off everyone’s radar, Emhyr made his moves, returning to Nilfgaard to reclaim his throne, shoring up his armies and invading the northern kingdoms, all in a plot to reunite with his daughter, Ciri.\n\nAfter the failure of his campaign in the Northern Kingdoms, Emhyr employed his disgraced agent, Cahir, to track down Ciri — more out of a desire to consolidate his power than any kind of fatherly love. He also manipulated the elves into fighting for his cause, despite secretly being responsible for the death of the first elven child born in centuries.\n\nThanks to Vilgefortz, Emhyr is finally reunited with his daughter, Ciri – except the audience knows that it’s actually an imposter named Teryn.\n\nEredin\n\nRaised in a military family. Eredin’s mother died in childbirth and his father, a military man, lost his mind with age. He lost a sister and two brothers in the 1,000-Year War. Smaller and less physically strong than other recruits in the academy, Eredin played to his strengths, subterfuge and dirty tricks, to rise to the top of his class. He was the youngest elf ever to achieve the rank of captain after the battle of Stell’s fjord, where he took command of Xin'trean forces retreating in a panic after its two generals were killed by bowmen. Eredin rallied the troops and launched a counter-attack that routed the Darwenish forces and saved a critical Xin'trean border fort from capture.\n\nWhen the Alvitir was murdered in the coup, Eredin was promoted to High Commander of the Golden Empire for his instrumental role in getting key generals from all kingdoms to join Balor’s ambitious plan.\n\nEredin was stoic, cold and ruthless, but he had secrets. He was in love with a lowborn merchant named Brían. Eredin hid his lover from the court, not because a same sex relationship meant anything of note in Xin'trea or the other Kingdoms, but because of their different classes by birth.\n\nMerwyn leveraged this information to turn Eredin against Balor and regain control of the army. Balor, however, made Eredin pay for his betrayal, trapping him and his company in an arid world on the other side of a portal. Imprisoned for eternity, with neither hope nor humanity, Eredin took his first steps to becoming one of wraiths who would later be known throughout the Continent as the fabled Wild Hunt.\n\nEskel\n\nA typically boorish witcher who trained with Geralt as a young child, Eskel was proud, self-assured, and easily offended. Eskel was the life of the party, as long as the party revolved around him, that is. In Eskel’s hands, a run-of-the-mill monster fight could be spun into a tale of epic proportions. Finally, his hubris got the better of him: an arduous fight with a leshy left Eskel infected. Unaware of the infection, his symptoms worsened until, finally, he was fully consumed by the monster’s slithering vines. A now leshy-like Eksel turned against his friends, which forced the witchers to kill him.\n\nEverard\n\nPart of a group of witchers, along with Gawain and Merek, who wintered at Kaer Morhen and were found dead in their quarters shortly after Voleth Meir took possession of Ciri. Their chests were stabbed and throats were slit while they slept.\n\nExplosive Spell\n\n“Anain a veishme, aneinye a vol.” “Ignite to life, burn to death.”\n\nF\n\nFalka’s Tale\n\n“A power-hungry mutt of a girl, who cried death to all kinds when Vridank spurned her elven mother. Bent on revenge, she slaughtered nobility, priests, even civilians, with her bare hands. She preyed on foolish followers, incited a rebellion to burn cities to the ground, sent rivers of innocent blood down the streets of Redania and Temeria to reclaim power.” —Stregobor\n\nIn Stregobor’s hands, this story is a piece of anti-elven propaganda — a cautionary tale that reminds humans no one is ever what they seem, especially elves. Others say that Falka was just a girl abandoned by her family who came to reclaim what was rightfully hers. That she happened to be one-quarter elven only matters to those who already believe elves to be evil. The tale of Falka returns to haunt — or inspire — many characters in the future.\n\nFeainnewedd\n\nAccording to legend, feainnewedd — which means “Child of the Sun” — only grows in Dol Blathanna or where Elder Blood has been spilled. These purplish flowers are intrinsically linked to ancient elves, so much so that they still render some of their potent magic, including portaling. Feainnewedd was one of the main ingredients in the witcher mutagen, but is nearly impossible to get one’s hands on.\n\nFenrik\n\nBalor’s cunning, nonverbal accomplice, Fenrik paid a cruel price for her loyalty. Fenrik was Balor’s closest confidant; he’d plucked her from the same mage institution that raised him, and their relationship was one of father and daughter. In order to harness the power of chaos, Balor had to sacrifice the thing he loved most in the world, Fenrik. Fenrik died at Balor’s hand, granting him incredible, rejuvenating magic abilities.\n\nFilavandrel aén Fidháil\n\nAn old friend to Vesemir, also known as Filavandrel of the Silver Towers, Filavandrel managed to rally some of the remaining elves to stage an uprising following years of suppression and elven genocide. This elven rebellion cost many human lives, but was soon dealt with by Calanthe. The face-off forced Filavandrel and his crew to retreat into the caves near Posada — the place where he met (or abducted) Geralt and Jaskier.\n\nOver time, the elves’ situation deteriorated and they lost hope in their former king from the Blue Mountains. Looking for a new leader, they gathered behind Francesca, the elven mage with whom Filavandrel would eventually father the first elven baby born in ages. Though knocked back by his people’s loss of faith, Filavandrel remained strong. He was an elf who loved — and longed — to lead. This tough but just sovereign has the weapon skills of a warrior.\n\nFire Magic\n\nOne of the three types of Forbidden Magic, fire magic is extremely dangerous, highly addictive and therefore forbidden by law. But that doesn’t stop mages from using it. Yennefer used it to scorch Nilfgaard at a cost to her magic, but rogue mages like Rience use it without remorse.\n\n“People think Chaos comes from nothing, but that’s wrong. To draw it, you need a source. Fire is a forbidden source because it usually consumes those who draw from it. Unless you’re very talented. Then the body can withstand it.” — Rience\n\nFjall\n\nA brash and impulsive warrior who was banished from the Dog Clan, Fjall was the son of Osfar, and next in line to become chieftain of the Dog Clan until he was caught sleeping with Princess Merwyn, the same Xin'trean heir he swore to protect.\n\nFjall had long carried guilt for surviving his older brother who died in battle saving him from a marauder’s sword. Since then, Fjall, despite being a dog clan warrior without equal, drowned his sorrows in whatever vice he could get his hands on and self-sabotaged his place as chieftain — a place he believed he was “stealing” from his dead brother. The only one who really understood his pain was his sister, Ryl. As children, Fjall and Ryl grew up with Prince Alvitir and Princess Merwyn. Exiled and disgraced, Fjall tried his hand at becoming a sellsword, but couldn't quite get into killing for coin. He preferred to spend his waking hours drowning his guilt and rage in brothels and taverns.\n\nFjall later discovered his entire clan was murdered in a coup orchestrated by Merwyn. Fjall joined forces with his Raven Clan rival, Éile, and the two planned to return to Xin'trea and enact bloody vengeance on those responsible.\n\nIn order to defeat Balor’s beast, Éile agreed to undergo a dangerous procedure that would meld her body with that of the beast. But Fjall took her place instead, saving the life of the elfyn he had fallen for.\n\nAfter undergoing the experiment, Fjall began to lose the sense of who he was, prone to bestial rages which could only be soothed by Éile’s singing. After his transformation, Fjall was able to defeat the beast, but lost himself to the beast inside him in the process. In the end, Éile had to kill Fjall, fulfilling part of Ithlinne’s prophecy — just not in the way she expected.\n\nFjall’s axe\n\nA well-balanced battle-axe taken from Fjall’s would-be assassin in Inis Dubh. A fearsome weapon that could be thrown overhead when needed.\n\nFjall’s Dog Clan Dagger\n\nFjall’s backup weapon. He gave it to Merwyn when they were attacked in the lowborn streets. Merwyn used it to kill Fjall’s sister, Ryl, during the coup. Éile stabbed Merwyn with the same blade during the fall of the Golden Empire, giving her two options: leave the blade in place and live to face defeat and despair; or remove it and bleed to death. Merwyn eventually chose the latter.\n\nFjall’s Silver Dog Clan Pendant\n\nA memento of Fjall’s time in the Dog Clan before his exile. Éile stole it from him while they were imprisoned together in Inis Dubh, leading him to seek her out after his release. After Fjall’s death, Éile wore the pendant in memory of their love — something previously unthinkable for a former member of the Raven Clan.\n\nGet to Know Fjall of The Witcher: Blood OriginStar Laurence O’Fuarain gives us an introduction to his character Fjall Stoneheart.\n\nFola\n\nAlong with Glacella and Murta, Fola was one of three young apprentices at Aretuza who encountered Yennefer upon her return to Academy for the emergency gathering of the Brotherhood. Though severely scarred and unlikely to disobey, Fola was a quick learner and highly competitive. Yennefer saw a lot of herself in Fola.\n\nForbidden Magic\n\nThere are many types of magic that are forbidden by law, including fire magic, demonology and necromancy.\n\nFourteen Fallen, The\n\nDuring the war with Nilfgaard, the Chapter was heavily divided. They stood idly by while tensions rose, thinking that having “one of theirs” — Fringilla — in Nilfgaard’s court would increase their influence and help temper their tensions. What they hadn’t anticipated was that Fringilla would succumb to Emperor Emhyr’s charms and fully embrace the Nilfgaardian doctrine. Feeling their control weaken, the Brotherhood called for a conclave, at which it was decided that no action was to be taken by mages.\n\nDisagreeing with the Brotherhood’s verdict but too late to save Cintra, Tissaia and Vilgefortz recruited a group of vigilante mages to help them stop Nilfgaard at Sodden Hill. A brutal battle followed, amounting to considerable losses on both sides: 4,000 Temerians, 5,000 Kaedwenians, 20,000 Nilfgaardians, and 14 mages. While 14 seems insignificant compared to thousands, it was the Brotherhood’s biggest loss — and most public display of disobedience — to date. In honor of the Fourteen Fallen, and as a reminder of how the north bonded together, a memorial was erected at Aretuza.\n\nFrancesca Findabair\n\nA powerful elven mage who leads what’s left of the free elves, Francesca is spiteful toward humans, but willing to consort with the enemy if it will help her restore her elven glory.\n\nAfter the elves lost hope in Filavandrel, they turned to Francesca, who they believed to have been blessed with a dream vision of Ithlinne. As much as Francesca hates humans for how they’ve treated her and her ancestors, she loves her kin more and will do anything to protect them. It was Francesca who kidnapped Yennefer and Fringilla, who mistakenly freed Voleth Meir from her tomb, and who briefly entered an alliance with Nilfgaard — all to secure a home, or Dol Blathanna, for her precious elves.\n\nThe alliance with Nilfgaard was bound to break eventually, but the death of Francesca’s newborn baby — at the hands of Emperor Emhyr — sped up the process considerably. Even though they suspected Redania instead of Nilfgaard, the enraged elves left the protection of the Nilfgaardian Empire to seek revenge, eventually becoming the rebel Scoia'tael. Now more aligned than ever, Francesca and Filavandrel were only out for one thing: justice for the murder of their child.\n\nFringilla Vigo\n\nA zealous sorcerer with a powerful drive to prove herself, Fringilla is willing to do anything and cross anyone to impress Emperor Emhyr. Fringilla was one of the best students in her class at Aretuza. When the time came for mages in training to be assigned to a court, Fringilla was bound for Aedirn. But due to Yennefer’s interference, things panned out differently. Against her uncle’s wishes, Fringilla was assigned to Nilfgaard. She reluctantly accepted and decided to make the best of a bad situation. She quickly made a name for herself down south as fierce, resourceful and unforgiving — qualities that the Emperor appreciated and no doubt helped nurture.\n\nFringilla, who was once accused of only being able to “do as she’s told,” started charting her own course. Without the Brotherhood looking over her shoulder, she grew more powerful and confident. As her first major show of force, she sank an entire Skelligen fleet — the one that was supposed to come to Cintra’s rescue. Later, she led the Nilfgaardian troops to war and after Sodden Hill, forged a remarkable alliance with Francesca. Everything Fringilla did was to please the White Flame, a man whose approval was easy to win but nearly impossible to regain.\n\nG\n\nGage\n\nAn elf defined by his broad build and boorish behavior, Gage is motivated by contrasting emotions: an undying anger toward humans and a deep love for his sister, Francesca. He’d do anything to protect her and fight anyone if it could secure a better future for elves at the cost of that of humans.\n\nGallatin\n\nA bold, abrasive elf who is blindly devoted to the revolution. Gallatin is a born fighter who led an army of guerrilla Scoia’tael fighting on behalf of Nilfgaard. Unafraid to speak his truth and loyal to his people, Gallatin puts himself on a collision course with his ruler, Francesca.\n\nGawain\n\nPart of a group of witchers, along with Everard and Merek, who wintered at Kaer Morhen and were found dead in their quarters shortly after Voleth Meir took possession of Ciri. Their chests were stabbed and throats were slit while they slept.\n\nGaylth\n\nBustling northern port city with onion-domed rooftops and decorative buildings. Éile and Fjall found themselves here after escaping Inis Dubh and surviving a storm at sea.\n\nGeneral Hake\n\nA Nilfgaardian army general with an inclination toward violence and an aversion for insubordination, General Hake was, like most humans, not a big fan of elves. But he hated worthless soldiers who waste his time even more. (The Nilfgaardian army’s latest recruits were both.) The general often found himself at odds with Fringilla and Cahir, who constantly seemed to ignore Hake’s opinion and rank. As a result, the general grew more and more frustrated with them for trying to do his job, becoming more and more recalcitrant, until he met his death at the hands of Fringilla.\n\nGeralt of Rivia\n\nA witcher who’s seen it all and has the cynicism to prove it, Geralt is bound to Yennefer by desire and to Ciri by destiny. Arguably the most famous witcher on the Continent, Geralt is called the White Wolf or, less favorably, the Butcher of Blaviken. Given up by his mother to the men at Kaer Morhen — a deed for which he resented her at first — Geralt flourished at the School of the Wolf. He was so successful at his training that he was chosen for additional mutations, giving him his signature white hair and greater strength, speed, endurance and resilience than his peers. Combined with his heightened senses, near immunity to diseases and potions, and extreme resistance to pain, Geralt was practically unbeatable.\n\nGeralt’s cynicism hid an affection for his loved ones that seemed at odds with his stoic demeanor. He’d protect them at all costs, but would rather avoid violence and remain neutral in all matters. As he got swept up in Ciri’s life (by the Law of Surprise), he was forced to choose a side in politics and question everything he thought to be true. Driven by destiny, he moved heaven and earth to help Ciri follow a path that was set out by prophecy.\n\nAfter decades on the road, Geralt has made many “friends” and probably even more enemies. Important influences in his life include Jaskier, a bard and his best friend; Vesemir, the father figure who trained and mentored him; Triss, the sorceress who saved his ass more than once; and, of course, Yennefer, Geralt’s true love. Even though “it’s complicated” with Yen, she’s the most important person in his life, next to Ciri.\n\nAs Ciri’s true nature becomes more widely known across the Continent, Geralt’s role as her protector and father figure is increasingly crucial. He reluctantly enlists Yennefer to help teach Ciri to control her Chaos. It’s a partnership which, over time, helps ease the distrust between the two. He even allows Yennefer to take Ciri to Aretuza to continue her magical training.\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of his unconventional family, Geralt planned to draw out the rogue mage Rience. Their rivalry came to a head during the Aretuza coup, where Rience arrived with force of rogue sorcerors and Scoia'tael. Geralt beheaded Rience, but fell in combat against his real master: Vilgefortz. Triss was able to portal the injured Geralt to the safety of Brokilon, where he would recuperate under the watchful eye of the hunter, Milva. Eventually, Geralt turned his back on the witcher life, and set out to find his adoptive daughter, Ciri, who was once again lost after the chaos of Aretuza.\n\nGeralt’s Hidden Dagger\n\nA nifty 9-inch knife that can easily be tucked away in boots, sleeves or pockets but can still hold its own against a full-size sword. This dagger is made from a single piece of steel, making it both sturdy and striking. Its modern grip was created by looping a leather lace through the blade. The two notches right above the grip are cutler catchers that stop any blade from sliding down the dagger and digging into Geralt’s knuckles.\n\nGeralt’s Kaer Morhen Armor\n\nWinters at Kaer Morhen are for rest, repair and upgrades. Similarly studded as its predecessor, this armor is a fine combination of leather and metal with the added bonus of a more rigid breastplate and scaled shoulder pads.\n\nGeralt’s Leather Armor\n\nA dark leather armor, strategically studded with metal for maximum protection and minimal weight. This torso model is no match for trained swordsmen, but is a great first line of defense in other battles.\n\nGeralt’s Meteorite Sword\n\nA double-edged sword with a 27.5-inch meteorite blade, which is stronger and more durable than steel, and sporting a narrow double-handed grip meant for non-monster fights. This blade has two striking details: the elven inscription along the fuller and Renfri’s broach on the hilt. Geralt added the broach to reinforce his belief that he shouldn’t get involved in the political affairs of men. Other than reminding Geralt of his beliefs, the broach serves as a cutler catcher, making it easier to deflect blows or overpower an enemy.\n\nGeralt’s Silver Sword\n\nA weapon that is lethal against magical creatures but worthless against regular enemies. It has a silver blade and an ivory grip; silver swords are much more precious than steel swords, more malleable and thus easily damaged. To make sure that Geralt gets as much use out of this weapon as he can, he keeps it in a sword carrier on his mare, Roach. That way, it won’t be exposed to the elements but can always be grabbed when a monster is near.\n\nGhost Tribe\n\nNomadic sword masters who owed no loyalty to any royal family. When they refused to fight for the Xin'trean ruler, Mad King Darach, he had their water supply poisoned, wiping them out. Darach also took the Ghost Tribe’s sacred blade, Soulreaver, as a war trophy and sign of Xin'trean supremacy. Scían was the sole Ghost Tribe survivor.\n\nGhouls\n\nGhouls, or ghuls, are a type of undead being that has a distinctive skeleton-like silhouette, piercing yellow eyes and a fang-filled mouth; with a long, snake-like tongue. They’re known to hunt for dead bodies and attack in groups, leaving little to no chance of escape. They hiss and snarl, not so much as a way to attack, but as a scare tactic or battle cry. Defeating a ghoul is easiest if you hit it in the head or neck; either twist the neck or use a silver sword to keep a safe distance and slash away. Should they bite, they’ll probably leave you to rot for a while, as they prefer the taste of aged flesh over fresh meat. A ghoul’s bite means certain death, unless you’re Geralt of Rivia.\n\nGiltine\n\nA manicured mage known for his masterful transformations of countless Aretuza students, Giltine considered himself “nature’s final artist,” the creator of living pieces of art. The special Aretuza students chosen to “ascend” met with Giltine near the end of their time at the Academy. As an expert on various cultures and customs, he was well equipped to create custom looks for every mage, no matter their destination. With a special mixture of herbs, he would put a student under — Yennefer regrettably forwent that step — and perform surgical procedures to remove their uterus in exchange for great magical power. Once altered, there was no going back; Giltine’s transformations were everlasting.\n\nGiltine’s Spell\n\n“Ein te nepurte, the pur irig.” “From your unborn, you are reborn.”\n\nGlacella\n\nAlong with Fola and Murta, Glacella was one of three young apprentices at Aretuza who encountered Yennefer upon her return to the Academy for the emergency gathering of the Brotherhood. Glacella was beautiful but spoiled: She’d bought her way into Aretuza. She may not have had the knack of magic, but she already had the confidence of a skilled mage.\n\nGodflesh Mushroom\n\nAn extremely potent fungus that, when consumed, will lead to feelings of euphoria and overconfidence. The psychedelic side effects make it quite popular.\n\nGold Dragon (Villentretenmerth)\n\nA mythical serpentine creature, the gold dragon is not to be mistaken for a white, black, red, green or rock dragon. Dragons are extremely rare and awe-inspiring creatures; built like a castle and armored like one, they are nigh indestructible — if you play your cards right, you’ll never have to try.\n\nThough the gold dragon is said to be benevolent, it has all the features of a ferocious creature: huge taloned wings, razor-sharp teeth, and big, pointy claws. Their fiery breath is hotter than hell and can scorch buildings or bodies in the blink of an eye. They fly upon wings huge enough to cast a shadow over an entire village; they could also blow over that village with a single flap. They’re hunted in part because they’re known to collect and protect treasure; while dragon hunters might be able to share some tips for taking down more common dragons, nobody — witcher or otherwise — has managed to kill a gold one yet.\n\nWhether there is more than one gold dragon out there remains to be seen; nonetheless, Villentretenmerth is unique. Reflective golden scales form an alluring and impenetrable shield along its backside, protecting it from dragon hunters. Though dragons are known to reside in mountains, gold dragons are skilled in polymorphism, so they shape-shift to hide anywhere as anything or anyone — keeping a low profile like Borch Three Jackdaws.\n\nBorch and the Dragons\n\nOn his travels, Geralt meets a man by the name of Borch Three Jackdaws — a jovial fella who is always accompanied by two Zerrikanian warriors, Téa and Véa. After a brief introduction, the colorful trio decided to join Geralt on an impromptu dragon hunt. Funnily enough, Borch himself would never carry weapons. Instead, he relied on his two Zerrikanian bodyguards to fight his battles.\n\nAs the hunt progressed, hunters fell and tensions rose. When the group finally found a sleeping green dragon, it all came to a boiling point, forcing Borch to blow his cover. Rid of his guide, and to everyone’s amazement, Borch revealed that he was in fact the mythical gold dragon. He had responded to the green dragon’s cry for help and, apparently, arrived just on time to protect her egg. What exactly transpired in the dragon’s lair is lost to history, but a gold dragon hasn’t been sighted since.\n\nGolden Empire, The\n\nA unified elven state, formed in the aftermath of Balor and Merwyn’s coup. After the Xin'trean, Darwenian and Pryshian royal families were murdered by Balor’s beast, the Golden Empire was formed (excluding the Dwarvish republic of Nolde) with Xin'trea as its capital and with Empress Merwyn as the figurehead — a demonstrative position designed to keep the masses happy. The Golden Empire troops quickly became unpopular, however, thanks to their brutal methods, use of slave labour to raise buried dwarven monoliths, and the worsening famine throughout the empire.\n\nGolden Oriole\n\nA bird or parts of a bird that neutralize the effects of poisons in the bloodstream — immensely beneficial when fighting basilisks. One of the main ingredients in the wound-binding potion.\n\nGors Velen\n\nA port city located in Temeria just above Brokilon Forest, Gors Velen and its bustling marketplace is the main connector to Thanedd Island.\n\nGreat Cleansing, The\n\nAfter the conjunction, Elven elders taught humans how to control chaos, and having learned everything they needed, humans began taking elven land. During what is called the Great Cleansing, nearly all young elven warriors were killed in cold blood in a failed rebellion against the humans. The remaining elves were forced to live as second-class citizens, licking their wounds in silence and longing for a chance at retaliation. The gruesome acts of the Great Cleansing irrevocably changed the Continent, which explains the deeply rooted tensions between elves and humans.\n\nGreen Dragon\n\nA close relative of the gold dragon, a green dragon is often the collector or protector of treasure. Similar to other dragons, the green edition has a scaled body, taloned wings, large claws and fiery breath. It’s said that their teeth are white as snow, sharp as razors and roughly the size of rocks — big enough to fill a dwarf’s hand.\n\nThough they’re not as rare as their golden-scaled siblings, the chances of an encounter with a green dragon are also rather slim. The treasure they’re known to rest (and nest) upon is also the reason why dragon hunts are such a lucrative business and why the species might soon go extinct. Even if a lair holds no treasure, the dragon can be bounty enough. Someone might sell a dragon’s skin, teeth, talons or even organs for ample amounts of gold and silver.\n\nH\n\nHalflings\n\nContrary to what their name suggests, halflings are not half-human. They have human proportions and are often “employed” by them, but are in no way related. Like dwarves, halflings are short in stature, but don’t mistake one for the other; they won’t appreciate it. Nor do they appreciate being (ab)used as unpaid servants by rich Northern families.\n\nThroughout history, halflings have shied away from the spotlight — stepping into it probably wouldn’t have done them much good anyway — preferring to live peaceful and quiet lives. Unlike dwarves, halflings don’t have any land or kingdom that’s traditionally theirs. In fact, in more recent times, halflings have been known to travel to Nilfgaardian territory. Away from human scrutiny, they enjoy the Emperor’s security.\n\nHawthorne\n\nA tree from the rose family that yields dark red fruit. Witchers use it for its healing properties.\n\nHealing Spell\n\nThere are different forms of healing magic. Some require spells, others potions, hand gestures or a combination of everything. Druids are usually skilled healers because of their extensive knowledge of all living things. Triss was also known to have a knack for it. Three common healing spells are: “Abeil kew net’a’t esen gweth. Gasheir kwe’s grönshil.” “Close what should not be open. Release what is bound.” And: “Ynilysh kwe’s perthe. Thenkreil kwe’s kov.” “Join what is broken. Replace what is lost.” And: “Ein ulka, zeil eip. Yn murm, gadeith kerve.” “From the ashes, rise. In the darkness, burn true.”\n\nHeimlon Song\n\nAn ancient song that mourns the dead, and is also said to guide lost elves home. Yet another example of how important music is within the elven community.\n\nHeliotrope\n\nA defensive sign. Much like Quen, Heliotrope helps deflect attacks and can soften impact. Use it as a temporary defense against physical attacks, spells, charms and other forms of combat magic or as a buffer when crashing into walls or falling to the ground.\n\nHirikka\n\nEven rarer than dragons, with deceivingly harmless looks but a deadly appetite, hirikkas have distinctively thin, sinewy bodies covered in patchy fur. You can recognize their long, doglike ears, short head shape, and light brown skin. That neutral skin color helps them blend in with their environment — typically northern forests — but those yellowish eyes still stand out.\n\nWhen they squat down, hirikkas might not look all that terrifying, but once they rise from behind the bushes, bare their sharp teeth and come coursing straight at you, that assessment will surely change. If you’re (un)lucky enough to see one, you’d do best to leave it be. Hirikkas were hunted nearly to extinction but usually bear no ill will toward humans; they’re just looking for quiet places to eat their fill.\n\nHumans\n\nHumans were the invaders of the Continent. Trapped in this world after the Conjunction of the Spheres, they wasted no time in overtaking it. In a short time, humans had colonized the Continent and established themselves as its rulers — much to the Elder Races’ regret. Humans looked down on the other evolved races, believing solely in their own inherent superiority. But that superiority was threatened — both by the long-prophesied Child of Elder Blood and the impending war with the southern empire of Nilfgaard. As tensions between kingdoms and races rose, humans had to be careful not to let conflict consume them.\n\nI\n\nIgni\n\nA pyrokinetic sign with multiple purposes. Used to repel attacks with a burst of fire, warm things up or set them ablaze completely. Vesemir famously used Igni to set fire to his sword — extremely useful against leshies.\n\nIllyana\n\nVesemir’s childhood sweetheart. Illyana was a low-born, self-made member of Kaedwen’s court who pleaded the witchers’ case on several occasions as Lady Zerbst. When she was still just Illyana, she grew up in the same household as Vesemir, both children of servants. After Vesemir left to train with Deglan, she was sold to the Zerbst family. Their son fell in love with Illyana and married her, making her a duchess. After the Duke died, Illyana took his place at court and turned their home into an orphanage.\n\nIt would be more than half a century until Illyana saw Vesemir again. Both tried to ease the rising tensions between Kaedwen’s nobility and Kaer Morhen. In the end, neither Illyana nor Vesemir were able to protect one another from what they feared — Vesemir’s home was destroyed and Illyana was lethally wounded in the process. As the dust was settling, they shared one last bittersweet moment and Illyana died in Vesemir’s arms.\n\nInis Dubh\n\nA grim, unforgiving harbor town in the far north. An island where those running from Elven society and its laws found themselves. Éile met Ithlinne here while performing at the Drunken Goat. Later, Éile found herself imprisoned with Fjall in the Inis Dubh jail, and fought together to survive Golden Empire assassins sent to kill them both.\n\nInquisition Room\n\nIn Aretuza, the Inquisition room is found in the Academy’s dungeon, where it is used to interrogate and torture suspects — Cahir can confirm. The chair itself doesn’t necessarily have any magical features, but it keeps the prisoner locked in place. The right mage — with a steady hand — can read a person’s mind, even relive their memories.\n\nIstredd\n\nAn inquisitive-by-nature mage who studied under Stregobor at Ban Ard, Istredd claims history as his muse. Aside from magic, Istredd was fascinated by archaeology. He studied anything from the remains on Thanedd Island to the monoliths in Nazair and Cintra. During his studies at Ban Ard, Istredd was captivated by Yennefer, whom he met in the caves of Tor Lara. A romantic relationship soon blossomed between the two magic students, one that was pure and true. She trusted and admired him. He adored and challenged her.\n\nDespite his efforts to keep “Yenna” in his life, the star-crossed lovers progressed in different directions. But Istredd’s love never really faded, he merely buried it beneath heaps of work. He became somewhat of an expert on monoliths, and, as a scholar, was allowed to work on Nilfgaardian territory, which is where he met Geralt. Both looking for answers, they investigated the monolith outside Cintra together. Geralt knew enough — the monoliths were a portal for monsters — but Istredd’s thirst for information wasn’t quenched yet. Not until he learned about Ciri’s link to Lara Dorren.\n\nIthlinne\n\nA girl with the gift of prophecy, whose words will guide generations to come, Ithlinne grew up in a tavern in Inis Dubh with her mother, Aevenien. She was prone to sickness, fits, and visions, which made people around her scared and suspicious. All of her visions came true in some form, including, tragically, the loss at sea of her own father. Ithlinne foretold that Éile’s child would begin a lineage that would have great consequence for the world to come. Just who the child is linked to remains to be seen, though. The answer isn’t as simple as it would seem.\n\nIthlinne’s Prophecy\n\nIthlinne Aegli aep Avenien is the elves’ most sacred prophet and these are her (in)famous words:\n\n“Verily I say unto you, the era of the sword and the axe is night, the era of the wolf’s blizzard. The Time of the White Chill and the White Light is nigh, the Time of Madness and the Time of Contempt: Tedd Deireaádh, the Time of Eind. The world will die amidst frost and be reborn with the new sun. It will be reborn of the Elder Blood, of Hen Ichaer, of the seed that has been sown. A seed which will not sprout but will burst into flame. Ess’tuath esse! Thus it shall be! Watch for the signs! What signs these shall be, I say unto you: first the earth will flow with the blood of Aen Seidhe, the Blood of Elves…”\n\nThe elves deeply believe that Ithlinne’s prophecy, or Aen Ithlinnespeath, will ring true. If it does, humans will come to perish in an ice age, while elves will prevail, returning to their former glory through the offspring of Elder Blood. This is why the elves are so keen to procreate, and why they are so disheartened by their lack of success.\n\nJ\n\nJackapace\n\nA snarling creature that tracks and kills with deadly efficiency, the Jackapace’s flared proboscis gives it an unusually acute sense of smell that allows it to track prey from great distance.\n\nJarre\n\nA young apprentice historian studying at the Temple of Melitele and Ciri’s slightly awkward study buddy. His thirst for historical knowledge led him to Melitele’s Temple where he devoured every item in the library. Upon Ciri’s arrival, Jarre was asked to show her around and help her get acquainted with the Orbuculum. Not long after, an unsuspecting Jarre fell victim to Rience, barely surviving the whole ordeal.\n\nJaskier\n\nJaskier is a successful bard and self-proclaimed romancer who entertains kings, queens and common people with his songs and poetry. The charming Jaskier (whose full name is actually Julian Alfred Pankratz) is everybody’s friend — or so he’d like to think. He dresses in the finest clothes and uses his boyish looks and born talent to impress anyone who will listen. As a bard, Jaskier always goes where stories can be found and songs can be written. He believes in the power of words, and that stories can change the course of history — which is why he wrote his most famous song to date, “Toss A Coin To Your Witcher.”\n\nA traveling troubadour and a wandering witcher were bound to cross paths at some point. Their early time together resulted in some of the bard’s most popular work. Even though Jaskier had a nose for adventure, he didn’t always have the stomach for it. He joined Geralt on several monster hunts, nearly losing his life to a vicious djinn at one point, but left the life of adventure behind after a dispute with the White Wolf. A few years later, Jaskier popped up again. Under the alias “The Sandpiper,” a mysterious angel of refuge, Jaskier was helping fugitive elves out of Redania to safety — perhaps his most altruistic act to date — and soon reunited with Geralt in his quest to protect Ciri. He remains one of Geralt’s most trusted friends and frequent travel companions.\n\nK\n\nKaedwen\n\nThis is the largest northern kingdom, home to the witcher fortress of Kaer Morhen and the sorcerers’ school in Ban Ard. The witchers have lived there since the first witcher was created and remained even after their keep was burnt to the ground. Weather conditions in Kaedwen can be harsh — as are its inhabitants — so their weapons can withstand a lot. The scabbards and sheaths are covered in thick layers of fur so that frost and rust don’t stand a chance. As for the designs, those are simple yet sturdy. Well-built, solid swords that will hold up in combat, but demand a bit of muscle power to wield.\n\nKaer Morhen\n\nThe training grounds for witchers located in the kingdom of Kaedwen was once a mighty keep, but now its ruins remind witchers of a proud past. The name Kaer Morhen literally means “Keep of the Sea,” but there’s no sea in the vicinity now. Built into the peaks of the Blue Mountains, Kaer Morhen is only accessible to those with knowledge of the treacherous trail that leads up to it. For centuries, it has been the home of the witchers from the School of the Wolf. These witchers-in-training could experience the closest thing to real-life monster combat on three huge wooden training contraptions. There’s the Pendulum, a series of swinging logs, with piercing metal spikes; the Windmill, an array of rotating wooden posts with jutting arms, ready to strike; and the Comb, a wooden bar hanging above a compactor of sorts, perfect for crushing small children. Even though Geralt didn’t like the thought of Ciri training on it without his presence, she was brave and didn’t let it conquer her.\n\nKaer Morhen’s armoury holds relics of a bygone age, each with its own epic origin story, like Klef’s crystal dagger, Deglan’s armor, or Vesemir’s Lab Axe that saved the witchers from the leshy. The armory’s collection of fully functional weapons and witcher memorabilia preserves the history of those witchers who have come and gone from its strong walls over the years after some rest and replenishing their elixirs and armor. Keen eyes will notice that the armory also holds some familiar weapons from a different part of Geralt’s universe…\n\nStep Inside Kaer Morhen from The Witcher\n\nKet\n\nKet was Merwyn’s handmaiden, and trusted confidante.\n\nKikimora\n\nAn insectoid water creature with eight sinewy legs commonly found in swamps; hostile when hungry. Far from an insect in size, the kikimora stands tall on several multi-jointed legs. Their limbs bear some resemblance to a human’s, but the lion’s share of the kikimora’s bony physique consists of many different animal parts. They’re quite the sight to behold: mangled faces, mouths filled with crooked teeth. Their eyes are opaque and hollow, their blood thick and much darker than that of humans.\n\nStarving kikimoras can kick up quite the fuss, gobbling up unsuspecting children or even grown men should they come charging at her. Otherwise, they largely operate under the radar of humans or witchers, only attacking out of hunger. They dwell in marshes, swamps and lakes, and their screeches sound like a dying woman’s scream, serving no purpose but to scare their foes. To slay the monster, a silver weapon to the head or heart will do the trick.\n\nKiller Trail\n\nA natural, rocky path encircling Kaer Morhen. Young witchers had used the treacherous trail to train, so Geralt taught Ciri the path for her own witchering education. It was on the Killer Trail that Vesemir first spotted the feainnewedd that sprouted from Ciri’s blood.\n\nKing Dagread\n\nThe king of Kaedwen, Dagread was a lazy monarch who was more concerned with wearing the right makeup and wigs than ruling his kingdom. Before Henselt ascended to the throne, the vain Dagread was in charge — Vesemir will surely remember him from his younger days. Dagread was a king who never had much interest in governance. Instead, he trusted a group of advisors — eagerly led by Tetra — to keep him informed about pressing matters. All that Dagread had to do was decide on the next course of action before washing his hands of it.\n\nKing Demavend\n\nThe king of Aedirn, Demavend succeeded his father Virfuril — the king of Aedirn during Yennefer’s tenure at court — to the throne. Demavend is a chip off the old block. Like his father, Demavend was very suspicious of mages — mages born in Aedirn being the only exception. As the ruler of Aedirn, he was expected to join the royal councils. But Demavend was never all that interested in global politics. His concern was being superior to the neighboring kingdom of Kaedwen.\n\nKing Foltest\n\nThe king of Temeria, Foltest is a man of questionable morals and considerable political influence. He used to be one of the most disliked royals in the north. His kingdom, one of the largest in the Continent, was tormented by a striga — the direct result of an incestuous relationship between Foltest and his twin sister, Adda. When Foltest finally decided to deal with the situation, he gained some of Temeria’s trust back.\n\nTogether with Triss, Foltest’s mage, Geralt managed to free Foltest’s cursed child. With life behind castle doors somewhat settled, Foltest started to get more involved in global politics. Against expectations, he marched his armies to Sodden Hill, where he swayed the battle in the Brotherhood’s favor. After realizing the role he had to play in the fight against Nilfgaard, he started cooperating (or conspiring) with the other northern royals to gain more power.\n\nKing Henselt\n\nThe king of Kaedwen, Henselt was smitten with his mage, Sabrina, but even more enamored by the awe-inspiring war machine that was his army. As the ruler of one of the larger kingdoms, Henselt’s opinion was respected among royals. But when he did join royal councils, he wouldn’t voice his opinion all that much (he left that to Foltest and Meve). Henselt cared more about his kingdom than the prosperity of the Continent, going to great lengths to protect what was his. At one point, Yarpen and his crew worked as Henselt’s convoy security, until it was attacked by Scoia’tael.\n\nKing Roegner\n\nThe first husband to Queen Calanthe of Cintra and father to Pavetta, Roegner’s life was saved by Urcheon of Erienwald, also known as Duny, and granted him the Law of Surprise, which led to Duny’s eventual marriage to Pavetta.\n\nKing Virfuril\n\nThe king of Aedirn. Virfuril was kind to his own people and even kinder to the beautiful mages from the motherland. He was known for two things: his hatred of elves, and his handsome looks. When the time came for Aretuza’s young mages to be appointed to a court, Virfuril’s was in high demand. Despite the Brotherhood’s effort to keep Yennefer — who’s a quarter elf — out of Aedirn, Virfuril fell for her. Upon hearing that she hailed from Vengerberg, there was no changing his mind. Some years after Yennefer’s tenure at Aedirn’s court, Virfuril died and Prince Demavend ascended to the throne.\n\nKing Vizimir\n\nThe ruler of Redania. Vizimir is known for relentlessly rounding up elves and trusting none other than his head of intelligence, Sigismund Dijkstra. Vizimir is everything you’d expect a king to be: wealthy, powerful and always wanting more. Redania was already one of the largest and wealthiest kingdoms on the Continent, but Vizimir was still set on adding Ciri to his family and Cintra to his realm. If Vizimir were to force a union between the two of them, he would be the single most influential king on the Continent.\n\nAs with most powerful royals, there’s nothing Vizimir fears more than losing his power. Redania’s king isn’t exceptionally clever or cunning, but the people in his inner circle are. With the help of Dijkstra,his advisor Philippa Eilhart, and his brother Prince Radovid, Vizimir often manages to outsmart the competition, winning at a rigged game. What he might not realize, though, is that he’s the one being played.\n\nKitsu\n\nA shape-shifting elven mage with fox-like hair and destructive fury. An elf-mahr hybrid who hides deep inside the ruins of an old elven academy.\n\nBefore she was corrupted by witchers, Kitsu was a regular elven girl, young and talented. She was taken from under Filavandrel’s watchful eye and forced to undergo mutations that didn’t agree with her — in fact, they’re what made her into an elf-mahr hybrid. Deglan’s plan for profit (create monsters to kill monsters) had backfired and Kitsu was living proof.\n\nTo hide the evidence, the witchers tried to get rid of her but only managed to estrange and anger her more. Kitsu fled into the mountains and found refuge in an old elven academy — there she stayed until Vesemir and Tetra followed her magical trail. Deceived by Tetra, Kitsu finally unleashed her fury on the witchers, thereby contributing to the destruction of Kaer Morhen.\n\nKlef\n\nOne of the first witchers. Klef was part of the group that tried to entomb Voleth Meir, and died in the process. When Voleth Meir was first wreaking havoc on the Continent, Klef joined the task force meant to take her down. They succeeded (sort of), but not before she managed to take Klef down. His damaged armor and the crystal-hilted dagger that she used to kill him are all that’s left — a humble tribute hidden in the Kaer Morhen armoury.\n\nKnitbone\n\nA healing herb with hairy leaves. Strong enough to patch up wounded witchers and especially useful when healing broken bones.\n\nKnucklebones\n\nA makeshift dexterity game played by Cintran street rats (and one disguised princess). The pieces are made out of sheep bones and the gameplay is as follows: using one hand, players toss the large knucklebone. While the bone’s mid-air, they grab the smaller pieces from the ground. The trick is to grab the right number of knucklebones and catch the big bone before it touches the soil, using just one hand.\n\nKorath\n\nA hostile desert wilderness. Those who go seldom return. It is the largest piece of (mostly) unexplored land, covering more ground than Cintra, Redania, Temeria, Brokilon and Nilfgaard combined. It’s the natural habitat of many nasty creatures, and famous for the expression: “Damn it to Korath!”\n\nKorath Desert\n\nA vast, inhospitable wasteland to the southeast of the Northern Kingdoms. Ciri accidentally transported herself to Korath while escaping Thanedd, using the unstable portal at Tor Lara. Isolated and starving, Ciri suffered from hallucinations and malnutrition until she was led to safety by the unicorn she dubbed Little Horse.\n\nKrallach\n\nAlso known as a roach hound, a krallach is an artificially engineered arthropod with canine characteristics, long antennae and spear-like front legs. Krallachs are the result of extensive alchemic experiments and genetic engineering. They look somewhat like a cockroach on spiders’ legs — which unfortunately come up to your waist.\n\nThese genetically enhanced creatures are also formidable killers with exceptional hunting and tracking capabilities, hence the moniker roach hound. As invertebrates, they do not have a backbone; instead, their bodies rely on a scaled membrane for stability. Other defining features are its antennae and legs, two of which are made of razor-sharp metal.\n\nKrallachs are created and kept in captivity by the mages who made them. They’re prized for their speed and agility; using all six of its legs, a krallach can reach speeds that no human can outrun. Once locked on its target, a krallach will follow a scent and track a target until it’s caught or killed. With its two antennae and tons of other little feelers, a krallach can detect the tiniest movement, which is good since its eyesight isn’t the best — yet it rarely misses a target with its lethal front legs. Want to kill it? Decapitation is most effective, either by sword or magic.\n\nL\n\nLab, The\n\nLocated in the bowels of Kaer Morhen, the Lab is where Reidrich practiced mutagenic alchemy. Many young orphan boys were given the grassy green mutagen here — though only three in ten survived. Inside the Lab, behind a medieval vault door, is a secret room that Reidrich called the Bestiary. This room, an old catacomb, was indeed used to study beasts, but also to hybridize them — Kitsu was also created here.\n\nLambert\n\nA mountain of a man with a teaspoon’s worth of tact, Lambert is a witcher with strong tales, but little diplomacy. Lambert"
