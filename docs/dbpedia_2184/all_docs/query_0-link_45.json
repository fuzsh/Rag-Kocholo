        "text": "Venigni Works Walkthrough\n\nStarting from the Scrapped Watchman's Stargazer, exit through the open doorway at the back of the arena. This takes you into a hallway where you will immediately find the Venigni's Guide Note.\n\nVenigni's Guide\n\nGo down the path to your right and follow it to the end to reach the gate into the Workshop Union Entrance.\n\nTurn to your right, and you will immediately see the \"Miracle Cure\" collectible lying on the ground.\n\nMiracle Cure\n\nDirectly ahead is a basic enemy and a Throwing Cell. Drop down the ledge next to this dead end to encounter another basic puppet, then turn around and go back up to the entrance doorway.\n\nTo the right of the doorway, a raised platform that leads you to some rooftops. Look out for the puppet enemy hanging from the ledge as you drop down.\n\nStraight ahead you will see a wooden bridge that connects two rooftops. This will collapse as you try to cross, so make sure you run and jump using L3 to reach the other side. Defeat the puppet on the opposite roof and grab the Vivid Ergo Fragment in the corner.\n\nBelow is one of those larger worker puppets, and a few basic enemies as well. Drop off the back side of the roof and into the thin alleyway below. Here you will encounter another basic puppet, and you can find a Attribute Resistance Ampoule at the alley's dead end.\n\nGo down the other end of the alleyway and you will pop out next to a wagon, ladder, and Special Resistance Ampoule.\n\nGet the large puppet's attention, then run up the ramp that leads back to the Workshop Entrance to lead him away from the other enemies. Just like the ones we encountered before, this guy has a haymaker, a jumping slam, and a quick two punch combo. This one also has a wheel on its back, which it can use as a weapon to slam on top of you. Stand back and wait for him to do one of his punch attacks, then heavy attack him when he whiffs.\n\nOnce he is defeated you can head back down to the bottom level of the area and finish looting. As you make your way down look for the small path on the left which leads you to a ledge with two trees and a Fable Catalyst.\n\nWhen you reach the stairs, kill the puppet hanging from the ledge to the left then drop down to the ground below. Straight ahead is Gemini's Emergency Protection. To the right are two puppets waiting to ambush you, but since we went around we can easily get the drop.\n\nFrom here there is a bridge that leads into the factory, but we are instead going to take the path on the right which leads to a ringing telephone. Answer the phone meet the King of Riddles. After a quick chat he will pose you a question. Choose the answer \"Human\" to win the prize, a Trinity Key, which we will be using later.\n\nBehind the phone are some boxes with an item underneath, a Radiant Ergo Fragment.\n\nGo back to the bridge and walk across. You will be ambushed by five basic puppet enemies as you cross, so try and defeat them one by one, or run away to split them up.\n\nThe main door into the factory is locked, so go up the stairs to the right, grabbing the Legion Magazine off the ground as you go past. At the top of the stairs you can drop into the factory. Use the ladders to descend, activate the Stargazer at the bottom, then grab the Chain sitting on the ground behind.\n\nVenigni Works\n\nThere are a few paths forward from here, for now we are going to ignore the way to the left of the Stargazer and go up the stairs to the right.\n\nOn the first platform, find the Dim Ergo Fragment, then go into the second floor of the building to the left. In the corner of the room are some boxes, with a hole in the floor behind.\n\nDrop down and you will be in a locked room with a Safe and two puppet enemies. I recommend just running over and unlocking the door instantly.\n\nThese puppets are a new enemy type. They are incredibly slow moving, but they have a huge amount of health and do not stagger easily. If you have the Fulminis Legion Arm equipped it does pretty good damage, otherwise just stand back and wait for them to miss a swing before countering with a heavy attack.\n\nOpen the safe in the back of the room to find the Salamander Dagger Blade and Handle.\n\nGo back up the stairs and through the doorway on the back side of the platform. Follow it all the way around where you will encounter a few puppets on a walkway running alongside a large building. Look out for the wooden planks on the ground, they will break and drop you into the room below if you walk over them.\n\nAvoid the planks and make your way into the building via the door at the end of the walkway (there is a Hidden Moonstone by the door). From here you can cross the pipes that run between the platforms on the upper level to get to a Sawtoothed Wheel.\n\nBelow you is a treasure chest, as well as a bunch of those tanky puppet enemies. Drop down and carefully draw them out, dealing with them one by one (pretty easy to split them up due to their low speed).\n\nOnce the coast is clear you can pop open the chest to get the Belford Shock Cartridge.\n\nTurn around and make your way across the factory, grabbing the Factory Manager's Report Document from the alcove on the right as you pass.\n\nFactory Manager's Report\n\nAs you round the corner you will see another item ahead, a Vivid Ergo Fragment.\n\nThis path leads to a large open room. As you approach a metal box drops from above. Drop down to where the box landed and a giant robot wielding two shields will burst out. It is basically impossible do damage this guy from the front due to his shields, and he will ram you and slam you with them anytime you hang around in front of him. Instead, just run tight circles around him and wait for him to whiff an attack, then hit him in the back.\n\nHe is pretty tanky so you will have to do this for awhile to win, but eventually you should get a stagger which will speed things up. Defeating him gets you a Legion Caliber, which is used to upgrade Legion Arms.\n\nGo up the stairs in the back of this room to proceed. As you ascend your lamp will glow, letting you know a butterfly is nearby. It will appear as you go up the second set of stairs. Chase it down and kill to get a Motivity Crank, which can be used to alter a Weapon Handle's stat growth. At the end of this walkway you will also find a Thermite.\n\nThis path leads to a platform in another large room. Go down the ladder to reach a new Stargazer. There is also an item, Electric Blitz Abrasive, to the left of the Stargazer.\n\nGo through the large red pipe near the Stargazer to find a small swamp. Walking in the mud will slowly infect you with Corruption, and cause you to walk slowly.\n\nThere are a few basic enemies hiding in the muck, and two items near the water: a Radiant Ergo Fragment and a Fable Catalyst.\n\nOnce the area is clear follow the muck through the valley where you will encounter another of those large worker puppets. Get his attention and draw him backwards towards an area with more stable ground so you can fight him normally, without the Corruption.\n\nDefeat him and the other basic enemies hiding in the muck then proceed. You will find a Vivid Ergo Fragment near some boxes on the right.\n\nKeep moving forward and you will reach the dead end of the swamp. To the left you will find a Venigni's Urgent Repair Tool, and on the right a Hidden Moonstone.\n\nThere is also another Red Butterfly, though you will have to deal with some puppets attacking you while you chase it down. Defeat it to get another Hidden Moonstone.\n\nReturn to the Stargazer. This time we are going to go up the stairs to the right of the Stargazer. This leads to a long hallway full of those slow puppets. There are also large fireballs that roll down the hallway at set intervals, dealing massive damage to anything they hit. You can avoid these by ducking into the alcoves on the sides of the hall.\n\nStraight ahead is a puppet sitting on an item, a Dim Ergo Chunk. Go left while avoiding the fireballs and you can find a Dim Ergo Fragment at the dead end of the hall.\n\nNext go up the hall, toward where the fireballs are coming from. About halfway up you will see a locked door with a Gemini's Emergency Protection next to it. Unlock the door, then keep going up the path.\n\nAs you get close to the end a puppet will break through the wall on the right and try to attack you. Deal with it, then proceed a little further to reach the spot where the fireballs are coming from. Here you will find a chest with the Fire Axe Blade and Handle inside.\n\nGo back and go through the smashed hole in the wall. Go through the hall, where you will find a Vivid Ergo Fragment. This will pop you out on a walkway overlooking a swampy area with a giant enemy. Ignore that for now and go up the stairs to the right.\n\nPass through the warehouse, ignoring the room to your right for now, and make your way to the opposite side where you will see a lever. Use the lever to lower a section of pipe, which creates a shortcut back to the first Stargazer in this area.\n\nCross the pipe and you will find a large worker puppet and a few of the slow puppets on the other side. Defeat them and grab the Radiant Ergo Fragment off the ground. Use the old Stargazer if you want, otherwise make your way back to the warehouse room we ignored earlier.\n\nInside are two rooms and a handful of those slow puppets. Immediately to the right is a Special Purification Ampoule, and up the stairs you will find the Doctor's Confession Note.\n\nDoctor's Confession\n\nGo through the door under the stairs up onto the platform on the other side and you will find the \"Have you seen this eccentric?!\" Newspaper.\n\nHave You seen this Eccentric?!\n\nNear where you found the Special Purification Ampoule you will see a ladder sticking out of the ground. Climb down to find a small room where there is a human muttering to himself about killing puppets. As soon as he sees you he decides you will be his next victim and attacks.\n\nThis enemy is wielding a saber weapon, has quick multi hit combos, and loves to dash around the room. However he is a humanoid, meaning we can just strafe around him carefully and backstab him repeatedly. Because of his quick movements it can be hard to catch him with the backstab, but even a back attack is not bad as long as you don't get caught up in one of his combos.\n\nDefeating him gets you a nice little boost of ergo, the Stalker's Promise Gesture, the Survivor's Mask, and the Survivor's Hunting Apparel.\n\nSurvivor’s Hunting Apparel\n\nSurvivor’s Mask\n\nExit through the green door on the back side of the room and you will find yourself in a series of hallways. To the immediate right is the shortcut we opened earlier, so go left instead. Make your way to the end of the hall which leads outside. Here you will see a switch that drops a ladder down into the mucky area we mentioned earlier. We are gonna ignore that for now, grab the Dim Ergo Fragment off the ground, then go back to the hall.\n\nGo back into the hallway and make your way down the intersecting hallway across from the green door. Grab the Hidden Moonstone at the end, then go left which will lead you directly back to the second Stargazer.\n\nGo back to the hallway with the rolling fireballs, back through the smashed wall, and back out to the walkway overlooking the mucky area. This time we are going to go left where we will encounter some friendlier NPCs, the Red Fox and Black Cat.\n\nYou can talk to both of them, but the conversation doesn't really lead anywhere. You have the option to buy the Ripped Venigni's Krat Landmark Guide III from Black Cat for 500 Ergo, which we might as well do.\n\nRipped Venigni's Krat Landmark Guide III\n\nAcross from them is a small alley with a Star Fragment in it. To the left of them is yet another series of hallways. Go straight ahead to the very end of the hall which opens up to another split path, left and right.\n\nStart by going right where you will encounter a few basic enemies. Defeat them then grab the Vivid Ergo Fragment off the ground behind them. Continue through the path to the right, which leads to another long hallway. Pass by the strange looking door and make your way to the end of the hall where you will find a Attribute Resistance Ampoule and a shortcut leading back to the factory floor from before.\n\nReturn to the strange door from before which you can open using the Trinity Key.\n\nInside are some strange messages, but also a safe with a Quartz and the Blue Blood's Tailcoat inside.\n\nBlue Blood’s Tailcoat\n\nReturn to the split path from before and go into the large red pipe. Deal with the legless puppet enemies that swarm after you as you make your way through the pipe. Cross the wooden bridge then take the path to the left to exit.\n\nOnce outside the pipe go left again, down the path leading below the pipes. Here you will encounter some more enemies, and find a Saw Blade.\n\nGo back up the path and all the way to the end of the hall where you will see a shortcut door. As you approach a giant robot with a shovel will burst through some debris and chase after you. You will want to quickly open the shortcut door, then turn and face him.\n\nThis guy is a little annoying to deal with in such small quarters, so your best bet will be to constantly back away from him and wait for him to whiff one of his shovel swings. His running swing is the easiest to punish since he staggers afterwards, but you can also get a hit in after some of his short range horizontal swings and even his Fury attack as long as you aren't in front of him when he swings down.\n\nHe will occasionally go into what seems to be a stagger type animation, which leads to him spewing fire on the ground around him which inflicts Overheat. Keep dodging in and out to avoid his attacks, striking in betwen, and eventually you will bring him down and get the Swordsmanship Master's Amulet.\n\nGo to the true end of the hallway (which was hidden behind the debris) and you will find a lever and an Attribute Amplification Ampoule. Activate it to drain the muck out of that middle area with the massive puppet enemy we saw before.\n\nRun back to the red pipe shortcut that took us back to the first Stargazer of the area. Nearby is a ladder that leads down to the previously mucky area. Climb down and take on the giant enemy, the Puppet of the Future. Good news is this guy is actually very easy to kill.\n\nYou will want to stand right under him, between his feet, Unload attacks onto his heels until he lifts them into the air to stomp you, then run away. When he tries to swing and hit you with his arms, run back to his feet and attack him. Do this repeatedly and you will probably even get a stagger, which lets you stack on even more damage.\n\nDefeating him gets you a Quartz, and lets you loot the chest in the back of this area which contains the Booster Glaive Blade and Handle. You can also loot all the minor items in this area: Radiant Ergo Fragment, Hidden Moonstone, and Dim Ergo Fragment.\n\nDrop down to the ground level towards the back side of the room. Here you will encounter a bunch of fireball throwing puppets. You will want to deal with these guys as well before we confront the shovel puppet.\n\nWe have a bit more space to use here, but you can employ the same strategy here as you did against the previous shovel puppet to defeat him and get the Workshop Union Standard Radiation Converter.\n\nTime to go through the exit in the back of the chemical room which leads us directly to the boss door. Activate the Specter summon if you want, equip as much fire resistance as you can, and get ready to face...\n\nKing's Flame, Fuoco Boss Guide\n\nFuoco is yet another big, slow robot so get ready for more of the same strategies we employed against the Parade Master and Scrapped Watchman. Fuoco’s primary attacks are forward slams and side-to-side sweeps with his club arm, which can be single attacks or linked into combos. We want to stay close to him at all times to try and bait these attacks out, but not so close that we can’t get away when he winds up something more dangerous.\n\nFist raised in the air is a slam, dodge to the side and punish with a heavy attack. Fist behind or on the ground is a sweep or uppercut, dodge towards him and punish with a heavy attack. Keep an eye on his posture at all times. If he stands up and pulls his club arm back to his side he is taking a break from attacking. Any other movement with his arm is signaling another attack coming, so be sure to be ready to dodge. Most of his combos do not exceed two attacks, so be ready to punish with another heavy attack during the break.\n\nOne unique attack to keep an eye out for is his triple sweep, which he will signal by setting his fist on the ground and taking a long pause, before unleashing three sweep attacks in a row while moving toward you. For this attack you simply want to run away, until the third sweep. As he begins the third sweep you want to run in so you are within attacking range just as it ends, allowing you to get a heavy attack or quick combo.\n\nFinally, we have his Fury attack which he signals by turning red and spinning his fist. This is actually an ideal attack for us to get, as you can simply run to the side and he will dash forward, completely missing you. If you get the timing right you can even run after him as he passes you by, then get a few attacks in as he regains his composure.\n\nOnce you beat him down to about half health Fuoco will open the furnace between its legs and let a bunch of fire pour out onto the ground. This is a good moment to hit him with some free attacks, but if you are near him when this happens you will instantly go into Overheat and start taking damage (you can get rid of Overheat by rolling around).\n\nIn phase two of the battle Fuoco will begin using ranged attacks, including shooting oil balls around the battlefield and targeting you with fireball attacks. If you happen to be standing on an oil spill when you are hit with a fireball it is big damage, so the best strategy is to simply stay close to Fuoco so he will continue to do melee attacks instead.\n\nYou do need to keep an eye out for two new attacks: his midrange flamethrower attack (just get behind him to avoid this one, you can even unleash some free attacks while he’s busy shooting), and his overhead slam Fury attack which cannot be dodged, so run to the side or perfect guard it instead.\n\nStay within range, dodge his heavily telegraphed melee attacks, and lay into him with as many heavy attacks as you can and eventually you should be able to trigger a stagger and secure an easy victory over this pile of junk.\n\nDefeating Fuoco earns you 7081 Ergo, the High-powered Flame Amplifier (used to craft the Flamberge Legion Arm), King’s Flame Ergo, and the Flame Grindstone (a new Grindstone modifier that lets you enchant your weapon temporarily)."
