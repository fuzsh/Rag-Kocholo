        "text": "No one likes getting bug bites, no matter how big or small they are. There’s nothing worse than when mysterious (and usually very itchy) blemishes suddenly pop up on your skin.\n\nMost of the time they're just part of the deal when you're exploring or enjoying time outdoors. But in some cases, you could end up with painful symptoms that linger for days, so it’s worth doing some detective work to figure out the culprit and the best ways to treat any wounds or irritation.\n\nTo start, think about where you live and any recent activity that may have exposed you to certain types of creepy crawlers, especially if you've traveled to other regions of the world, had animal contact, or ventured into areas of dense vegetation (like a forest or a field), says Peggy Hunter, MD, a dermatologist with Palm Beach Dermatology.\n\nThere are simple bites, stings (where the bug that bit you actually has venom), and then there are infestations where a bug is actually living in your skin, says Meyer Horn, MD, a dermatologist and assistant professor of clinical dermatology at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University. “Bites look pretty much the same, so it depends on the distribution of where they are on the body, or how many bites you have,” he adds.\n\nAnd while definitely unpleasant, a minor and uncomplicated bite usually heals within a few days to weeks and is nothing to lose sleep over, says Dr. Hunter. However, if you experience fever, chills, muscle cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, neck stiffness, lip swelling, or wheezing, you should contact your doctor ASAP since these are signs of an allergic reaction.\n\nMeet the experts: Meyer Horn, MD, is an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University. Peggy Hunter, MD, is a dermatologist with Palm Beach Dermatology. Nancy Troyano, PhD, is a board-certified entomologist with Rentokil North America. Geeta Yadav, MD, is a dermatologist and the founder of FACET Dermatology.\n\nEven for mild cases, it helps to know what exactly bit you so you can have peace of mind and be on the lookout next time. Look through these 15 identifying insect bites pictures to find out which pesky critter left its mark.\n\n1. Bed Bug Bites\n\nBed bug bites on woman’s back.\n\nWhile the thought of bed bug bites may skeeve you out, they’re more annoying to deal with than an actual threat to your health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Bed bug bites are primarily just super itchy and can keep you up at night. The bigger issue is that they can spread really fast and lead to an infestation, and it can be an inconvenient and expensive process to get rid of one. (Also, the idea of little bugs feeding on your blood while you sleep isn’t exactly a comforting thought.)\n\nPeople can have a range of reactions to bed bug bites, says Nancy Troyano, PhD, a board-certified entomologist with Rentokil North America. Some people have no reaction at all, while others will notice an itchy, red, welt-like mark that looks similar to a mosquito bite. “Bites may appear in a linear fashion if there are multiple bugs feeding, and bites can occur anywhere, but they are often found in areas where skin is readily exposed,” Troyano notes. They may appear pink or deep purple on darker skin tones and red on light skin.\n\nContrary to popular belief, attracting bed bugs has nothing to do with bad hygiene or a dirty apartment. These pesky insects get around by hitchhiking onto your belongings, so prevention can be tough, says Angela Tucker, PhD, the manager of technical services for Terminix. “Knowing this, the best prevention is being watchful during your travels and regular home cleaning,” she says.\n\nYou can also keep an eye out for the critters, which are about the size, shape, and color of an apple seed when fully grown. Another sign that bed bugs may be around your space is their byproduct, meaning you might see reddish-brown blood spots on sheets or mattresses, Tucker says.\n\nIf you do happen to get bed bug bites, spot-treat them with a hydrocortisone cream to try to soothe the itch, says David Cutler, MD, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Then, call for help to clean out your place. “It’s important to see where the bed bugs came from,” Dr. Cutler says. “Then, call in a professional exterminator so you don’t get any more bed bug bites.”\n\n2. Bee Stings\n\nYou’ll usually know it when you get stung by a bee because it hurts like hell. “At first, you may not even see anything on the skin,\" Troyano says. \"However, within a few minutes, there may be localized swelling and redness around the sting site.” The area might also feel warm, and you may see a small white mark near the center of the swelling (that’s where the stinger went into your skin). On darker skin tones, you may see a swollen red bump with a dark red or black mark in the center.\n\nIf you know you have an allergy to bee stings, seek medical care immediately. Bees lose their stinger after stinging, Troyano says, and you should try to remove it if it’s still stuck in you.\n\nThen, apply ice to reduce swelling, says David Gatz, MD, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the assistant medical director of the adult emergency department. You also may want to take an antihistamine like Benadryl, he adds.\n\nThe only real way to totally avoid getting stung is to not interact with bees...obviously. (But that's not necessarily feasible if you ever want to enjoy the outdoors!) So, when you're outside, don't swat at these insects—just let them be.\n\n3. Wasp Stings\n\nA wasp or hornet sting causing swelling on a woman’s arm.\n\nLike bee stings, wasp stings hurt. You’ll feel an intense burning or sharp pain, accompanied by swelling and redness around the bite. The bite will also look similar to a bee sting.\n\nThoroughly clean the area with soap and water, then apply ice or a cold compress to reduce swelling and pain, says Dr. Gatz. You can also take an antihistamine to minimize pain or itchiness.\n\n“In general, if you leave bees and wasps alone, they will leave you alone,” says Tucker. But if you want to be especially cautious, she also recommends skipping flowery perfumes or fragrances and covering any food and drink around you.\n\n4. Yellow Jacket Sting\n\nYellow jacket stings are similar to bee and wasp stings. They cause extreme pain, redness, and swelling around the site, per Johns Hopkins Medicine. But yellow jackets don’t leave the stinger behind. Itching and warmth around the bite are common, and you may feel fatigued.\n\nMost yellow jackets make their nests underground, so they are commonly found near trees, hollow logs, and woodpiles. They can also burrow in attics, between walls, or even inside trash bins. These flying insects are frequently mistaken for honey bees, but they're hairless and about a half inch in length, per Texas A&M Agrilife Research.\n\nAvoid swatting the bug and cover any nearby food or drink. If you are in the woods, be mindful of where you’re walking so you don’t step on a nest.\n\n5. Scabies\n\nScabies is a parasite infestation caused by microscopic mites, according to the CDC. When you have scabies, the female burrows into your epidermis to lay her eggs.\n\nScabies usually shows up as a rash with small, raised pustules or blisters, and is “intensely itchy,” Troyano says. They are often clustered together and look like inflamed pink or dark red pimples.\n\nIf you’ve never had scabies before, you might not see the rash for several weeks after you’ve been exposed. But, if you’ve had scabies before, you might see a rash within one to four days of being exposed, she says.\n\nScabies is transmitted through “prolonged direct skin contact” and is “highly contagious,” Tucker says. You need to see a doctor to get properly diagnosed and treated, but it’s generally treated with a permethrin anti-parasitic cream, Dr. Gatz says.\n\n6. Mosquito Bites\n\nOkay, yes, mosquito bites are usually NBD. They’re itchy and annoying, but nothing major. You probably already know what a mosquito bite looks like, but (just in case), they’re usually red, create a bump on your skin, and can itch, per Troyano. On darker skin tones, bites can appear dark red or brown and may appear slightly raised. For some people, a bug bite may appear filled with fluid, with a small water blister in the center.\n\nThat said, mosquitos can carry viruses like Zika and West Nile, which can cause fever-like symptoms, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, the CDC says. So, if you’ve been bitten by a mosquito and start to feel off afterward and have symptoms like these, call your doctor ASAP.\n\nIn order to let mosquito bites heal, don't scratch—that raises the risk that the bite will become infected, Dr. Cutler says. A hydrocortisone cream should help alleviate some of the itchiness, he adds.\n\nWhile you can only do so much to prevent mosquito bites, Tucker recommends removing standing water around your home or yard (mosquitoes can lay their eggs in these areas). And if you’re planning to spend a lot of time outside, using a good mosquito repellent is key, she says.\n\n7. Spider Bites\n\nA spider bite on a woman’s leg.\n\nSpider bites are actually pretty rare, Troyano says, but they do happen. They can look like typical bug bites, so it can be hard to tell right away if you were bitten by a spider unless you see it scuttling away.\n\nIf you do notice a bite and spot the little guy, Dr. Cutler recommends washing the area with soap and water and leaving it alone. “Toxins from [certain spiders] can destroy the skin,” he says—so it never hurts to wash the spot with soap and water to cleanse the skin (even if you're not 100 percent sure it's a spider bite). For those with deeper skin tones, the redness can be more subtle and the bite may appear brownish. Sometimes, spiders also leave behind two puncture holes right next to each other.\n\nIf the wound area seems to be growing, is unusually red, hot to the touch, or ulcerated, or you have a fever and/or joint pain, call your doctor ASAP, Troyano says.\n\nCleaning out cobwebs inside and outside of your house can reduce your chances of spider run-ins. Also, wear long sleeves, pants, gloves, and a hat to protect your skin when you’re working outside or in areas where things are stored and not used often, and try to keep your grass and bushes maintained, Tucker says.\n\n8. Tick Bites\n\nA tick bite with a distinctive bulls-eye shaped rash on a man’s arm.\n\nIt's not always obvious when a tick bites you, because it won't *always* leave a mark (more on that in a minute). But sometimes the tick will still be attached when you discover a bite, so the first thing you’ll want to do is remove it. Troyano recommends taking the following steps to do this:\n\nUse tweezers and grab the tick close to the skin.\n\nSteadily pull upward, but avoid twisting the insect.\n\nDon't crush the tick once removed.\n\nSubmerge the tick in rubbing alcohol and save it. Put it in a clear, sealable plastic bag in case you need to see a doctor or veterinarian. Or, take a clear photo, then flush it.\n\nOnce the tick is removed, wash the area with soap and water, Dr. Gatz says.\n\nMost likely, you won’t be able to feel when a tick bites you. The bite is usually painless, but can appear as a tiny red dot. If you notice a bullseye-shaped rash appear on your body, a pink rash on your wrists, arms, and ankles, or an ulcerated area around a bite, call your doctor, Troyano says. These symptoms may be signs that a tick did bite you, and you've been infected with a tick-borne illness like Lyme disease. On darker skin tones, the small bite may appear brown or purple. If you experience a fever, chills, aches, and muscle fatigue, those are also cues you need to make a visit to your doctor.\n\nBut remember, not every tick carries a tick-borne illness, so even if one bit you at some point, that doesn't guarantee you contracted something more serious.\n\nHow can you protect yourself from tick bites? Tucker recommends showering quickly when you come in from being outside (you might be able to wash off ticks before they have a chance to bite you). It’s also a smart idea to wear long pants and sleeves when you go into tick-infested areas, like the woods, and to wear bug repellent that contains DEET. Also ask a family member or friend to help you do a body scan for ticks after being out in the woods.\n\n9. Fire Ant Bites\n\nFire ant bites are common in the summer, and chances are, if you are stung, you will probably have more than one bite. A single fire ant can sting multiple times (ugh!), and if you are stung, you’ll know as soon as it happens. “Fire ants cause immediate pain and a red spot,” says Dr. Hunter. “[They are] typically a collection of swollen red blisters which eventually evolve into tender, itchy, pus-filled bumps.” And unfortunately, those painful blisters can last several days to weeks.\n\nIf you suspect you were bitten by fire ants, immediately wash the skin with soap and water. Then, Dr. Hunter suggests applying a cool compress, calamine lotion, hydrocortisone cream, or an OTC methanol-based, anti-itch solution to help soothe the bite. Home remedies like baking soda and water paste, white vinegar-soaked cotton balls (cooled in the refrigerator), and toothpaste can also calm the area down.\n\nIn extreme cases, an antihistamine provided by a medical provider may be necessary. If you are allergic to bees, and suspect you have been stung by fire ants, you should see a doctor immediately. “If there is a pre-existing bee or wasp allergy, there is a potential for cross-reactivity with the venom from fire ant bites,” says Dr. Hunter. Since bees and fire ants are both classified in the Hymenoptera order, people with a history of anaphylaxis to stings should carry an EpiPen, regardless of the species that bit them, she explains.\n\nTo avoid a run-in with fire ants, don’t walk barefoot outside. Wear socks and closed-toe shoes if you are in grassy, sunny, open areas. Spraying insect repellent on shoes and clothing can also help prevent fire ant stings, says Dr. Hunter. “Be aware of your surroundings,” she says. “Fire ant attacks take merely seconds, but the consequences last days to weeks.”\n\n10. Flea Bites\n\nFleas are tiny insects that survive on animal or human blood and reproduce quickly. While they are commonly associated with pets, you can still get flea bites if you live in a pet-less home. Fleas can come from your yard or a neighbor too.\n\nFemale fleas lay eggs after feeding on blood, per the Cleveland Clinic. Typically, fleas bite below the knee, but if you are a pet owner (and sleep with your pet), your entire body may be at risk. “Flea bites look like a miniature version of mosquito bites,” Dr. Horn says. The red or dark brown bumps are often clustered with three bites in a row within an area spanning several centimeters.\n\nThe main signs are intense itchiness and tenderness around the bite. But do not scratch! “Some of the most severe cases are not from the bites themselves, but secondary to all the scratching people have done, and they get an infection requiring antibiotics,” says Dr. Horn. That said, some fleas do carry disease or bites can cause an allergic reaction. In these cases, you may experience more severe symptoms like fever, body aches, and rashes.\n\nDr. Horn suggests taking an over-the-counter oral antihistamine such as Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec, or Benadryl. You can also use a cortisone lotion or cream, as well as an OTC anti-itch remedy containing camphor and menthol, he says. For added relief, put the creams in the refrigerator and use them cold to cool and soothe the bites.\n\nInsect repellent that has DEET is especially effective for warding off fleas, says Dr. Horn. “DEET is really necessary if you want good protection,” he says. Just avoid spraying it directly on your face or near your mouth. And if you suspect a friend or neighbor has a flea issue, call your landlord or an exterminator to help determine the best course of action.\n\n11. Chigger Bites\n\nChiggers are mites that typically come from birds or other animals. When you leave your windows open, they can enter through screens if a bird is perched on the window sill.\n\nThe bites from these critters are very similar to flea bites, and it's almost impossible to distinguish between the two, says Dr. Horn. “It’s more about history of exposure, but chigger bites are going to be more common,” he notes. Bites usually look like red or dark brown welts, appear in groups, cause intense itchiness, and are typically found on the lower body.\n\nThey tend to get better in a few days. To help calm the itchiness, antihistamines like Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec, or Benadryl, cortisone lotion, and over-the-counter anti-itch creams can help, says Dr. Horn. The temporary relief you get from scratching may also bring a bacterial infection or cause the area of discomfort to spread. So keep your fingers away from the bite!\n\nTo minimize your risk of chigger bites, check for bird nests before opening your windows. During outdoor activities and camping, always wear DEET insect repellent, says Dr. Horn. “I usually tell people that are camping to wear insect repellent on their clothes, and pat it onto their hands, neck, cheeks, and hairline.” Noted!\n\n12. Greenhead Fly Bites\n\nAlso known as salt marsh horseflies, these critters look like standard flies, but are much bigger with a shiny green head. Their bites are painful and the area remains tender and itchy afterwards, says Geeta Yadav, MD, a dermatologist and the founder of FACET Dermatology. “The fly uses small hooks around its mouth to grab onto you as it bites, and it releases its saliva into you like a mosquito, which will cause irritation,” she notes. “The bite often rises up into a welt, with a cut rather than a puncture hole as the fly's mouth has somewhat serrated edges.”\n\nMost bites can be treated with hydrocortisone or calamine lotion. You can find greenhead flies anywhere, but they're particularly common in the summer in warm, wet environments, Dr. Yadav says. They cannot bite through fabric, so wearing long sleeves and pants is your best defense against them.\n\n“They also prefer dark clothing, so wear apparel that's lighter in color, and they are most active from 10 a.m. to dusk, so if you're sitting outside during these hours, take the above precautions or consider relaxing in screened-in areas,” says Dr. Yadav.\n\n13. Lice Bites\n\nLice are most commonly caught by children because they spread through group settings like sleepovers, summer camp, sports, and school. “Head lice are almost exclusively spread through contact with the hair of someone with lice, though very rarely they can be spread through personal belongings,” says Dr. Yadav.\n\nThat's why their bites are usually found on the head, and they look like small inflamed bumps, which can appear pink or red on fair skin and purple on deeper complexions. “They tend to be very itchy, as the lice release their saliva into your skin when they bite, causing a reaction,” explains Dr. Yadav.\n\nThese tiny insects are hard to see. You're more likely to see nits, or eggs, which secure themselves to the hair shaft. If you come into contact with lice, work quickly, and keep your child out of school, inspect their scalp immediately and begin treatment.\n\nTreatment usually consists of lice medicine known as pediculicide, which kills the bugs, and you should wash and dry all clothing, bedding, and other items that the person with lice wore or used in the two days before treatment, according to the CDC.\n\n14. Kissing Bug Bites\n\nKissing bugs get their name from the fact that they tend to bite around the mouth, says Dr. Yadav. The bites don't usually hurt, but can look like hives, or in some cases, cause severe swelling. Some kissing bugs can carry the parasite that causes Chagas disease, which, left untreated, can lead to serious heart or digestive problems.\n\nThe bugs are a little under an inch long and brownish black in color, with small red spots along the sides of their bodies, says Dr. Yadav. They're active at night, so to avoid them, seal up any gaps in your house, especially along windows or doors, and keep your pets indoors at night, as they may pick them up if they are sleeping outdoors.\n\nThey’re often found in warm areas like the Southern states in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America. They tend to live under a mattress, in pillows, or in other bedroom furniture, says Dr. Yadav.\n\nYou can use calamine lotion or anti-itch cream to stop the itching and apply an ice pack to minimize the swelling. If symptoms get worse or the bite becomes infected, visit your doctor immediately."
