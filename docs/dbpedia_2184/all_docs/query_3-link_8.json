        "text": "Updated 14/12/2020\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nDefinition of Metalanguage\n\nExamples of Metalanguage in VCE English\n\nConclusion\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAlthough it appears on criteria sheets, many students never really understand the termÂ metalanguage. Strangely, it is something that is rarely addressed in classrooms. While the word may be foreign to you, rest assured that metalanguage is not an entirely new concept you have to learn. How come? Because you have been unknowingly using metalanguage since the very beginning of high school.\n\nIt's a word that is more and more frequently thrown around as you get more advanced in high school. And, it's something that becomes tremendously important in your final year of high school, because the more you include metalanguage discussion in your essays, the more intricate your discussion becomes and the more unique it also becomes.\n\nSo, let's find out exactly what metalanguage is.\n\n2. Definition of Metalanguage\n\nMetalanguage isÂ language that describes language.\n\nSo, instead of maybe using the word, \"He was sad\", we might say something like, \"He felt sorrowful\". The choice in words changes the meaning that is interpreted by the reader, just slightly, but there is still a difference. So, when it comes to studying texts or reading articles, and trying to analyze what the author is trying to do, we look at metalanguage as a way to help give us insight into the ideas that they're trying to portray.\n\nThe simplest way to explain this is to focus on part 3 of the English exam â Language Analysis. In Language Analysis, we look at the authorâs writing and label particular phrases with persuasive techniques such as: symbolism, imagery or personification. Through our description of the way an author writes (via the words âsymbolismâ, âimageryâ or âpersonificationâ), we have effectively used language that describes language.\n\nNow, if we look at the bigger picture, our analysis of an authorâs language can be applied to Text Response, and even Reading and Comparing. To learn more about why metalanguage is important in Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response. Otherwise, for those interested in Comparative, head over to our Ultimate Guide to VCE Comparative.\n\n3. Examples of Metalanguage in VCE English\n\nNovel\n\nTone\n\nNarrator\n\nGrammar and punctuation\n\nCharacterisation\n\nForeshadowing\n\nFor example\n\nAchilles isÂ characterised as a foetus, for his position is âchin down, shoulders hunchedâ as though he isÂ inside a womb.Â (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve*, Mankiewicz foreshadows Eve's sinful and regretful actions, as a sorrowful expression is emphasized as she accepts her award\n\nAs you can see, the word 'foreshadows' pushes us in a new direction. Rather than just saying what has already happened or telling your teacher or examiner something that they already know, it forces you to actually analyze what's in front of you and to offer your own unique interpretation of why this metalanguage or why this technique has been used.\n\n*If you happen to be studying this text, check out our All About Eve Character Profiles.\n\nFilm\n\nMise-en-scene\n\nCamera angles\n\nMusic\n\nLighting\n\nFor example\n\nWhen Terry leaves Friendlyâs bar, the thick fog symbolises his clouded moral judgement as he decides whether he should remain âD and Dâ, or become a âratâ. (On the Waterfront, Elia Kazan)\n\nPlay\n\nStage direction\n\nSoliloquy\n\nMonologue\n\nProp\n\nMotifs\n\nFor example\n\nThe miniature set Zac creates is designed with a white backdrop, symbolising his desire to wipe away reality since he âcanât stand real things'. (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nIn Medea, the motif of animals emphasizes the inhuman and bestial nature of Medea, highlighting how she defies natural norms.\n\nThis student has actually given us an analysis of why animal motifs are used. And that is to highlight how Medea defies natural norms, because of her inhuman and bestial nature.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs indicated earlier, you should be familiar with many, if not all the terms mentioned above. Take note that some metalanguage terms are specific to a writing form, such as camera angle for films. If you need help learning new terms, we have you covered - be sure to check out our metalanguage word banks for books and our metalanguage wordbank for films.\n\nAs you discuss themes or characters, you should try and weave metalanguage throughout your body paragraphs. The purpose of this criteria is to demonstrate your ability to understand how the author uses language to communicate his or her meaning. The key is to remember that the authorâs words or phrases are always chosen with a particular intention â it is your job to investigate why the author has written a text in a particular way.\n\n[Modified Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys, welcome back to Lisa's Study Guides. Today, I'm really excited to talk to you about metalanguage. Have you guys ever heard of metalanguage before? It's a word that is more and more frequently thrown around as you get more advanced in high school. And, it's something that becomes tremendously important in your final year of high school, because the more you include metalanguage discussion in your essays, the more intricate your discussion becomes and the more unique it also becomes. So, let's find out exactly what is metalanguage.\n\nSimply put, metalanguage just means language that analyses language. When authors write anything, we make certain decisions when it comes to writing. So, instead of maybe using the word, \"He was sad\", we might say something like, \"He felt sorrowful\". The choice in words changes the meaning that is interpreted by the reader, just slightly, but there is still a difference. So, when it comes to studying texts or reading articles and trying to analyse what the author is trying to do, we look at metalanguage as a way to help give us insight into the ideas that they're trying to portray.\n\nMetalanguage comes in really handy, especially if you're somebody who struggles with retelling the story - I have a video on how to avoid retelling the story, which you can watch. Metalanguage essentially takes you to the next level. It prevents you from just saying what happened, and forces you into actually looking at how the ideas and themes are developed by the author through the words that they choose to use. So, let's have a look at a couple of examples to give you a better idea. I'm going to show you two examples. One uses metalanguage and one doesn't, and you'll see how a massive difference in how the student understands the text is really clear.\n\nNumber one, foreshadowing.\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve, Mankiewicz emphasizes Eve's sorrowful expression as she accepts her award.\n\nVersus\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve, Mankiewicz foreshadows Eve's sinful and regretful actions, as a sorrowful expression is emphasized as she accepts her award.\n\nAs you can see, as soon as we put in the word foreshadows, it pushes us in a new direction. Rather than just saying what has already happened or telling your teacher or examiner something that they already know, it forces you to actually analyse what's in front of you and to offer your own unique interpretation of why this metalanguage or why this technique has been used. So, in this case, it's foreshadowing.\n\nâ\n\nLet's have a look at another one, motif.\n\nIn Medea, Euripides commonly refers to animals when describing Medea's actions and temperament.\n\nVersus\n\nIn Medea, the motif of animals emphasizes the inhuman and bestial nature of Medea, highlighting how she defies natural norms.\n\nSee how, in the first example, it was really just telling you what we might already know through just reading the book, but when it comes to the second example, this student has actually given us an analysis of why animal motifs are used. And that is to highlight how Medea defies natural norms, because of her inhuman and bestial nature.\n\nSo, those are some examples of metalanguage. There are so many more different types of metalanguage out there...\n\nAll the Light We Cannot See is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nBreaking Down an All the Light We Cannot See Essay Prompt\n\nWe've explored themes and symbols and provided a summary of the text over on our All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down an All the Light We Cannot See essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nTaking a look at this prompt, the first thing to note is that it is theme-based. Specifically asking about the line that separates civilised and uncivilised behaviour within the novel, this prompt focuses directly on the theme of human behaviours and how you ultimately interpret the fine line (i.e. seamless, difficult, changing, manipulative) between such ideas. Fundamentally, you have to discuss how this theoretical line drawn between the contrasting behaviours is explored within the novel in various ways throughout Doerrâs examination of humanity.Â\n\nThe question tag of Discuss is the most flexible type of prompt/topic you will receive, providing you with a broad and open-ended route to pretty much discuss any ideas that you believe fit within the promptâs theme of uncivilised and civilised behaviour. Although this may seem hard to know where to start, this is where Step 2: Brainstorm, comes into play. You can read through LSGâs Question Tags You Need To Know section (in How To Write A Killer Text Response) to further familiarise yourself with various ways to tackle different prompt tags.\n\nIf youâre not sure what it is meant by âtheme-based prompt,â take a look atThe 5 Types of Essay Prompts.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nA fundamental aspect of writing a solid Text Response essay is being able to use a diverse range of synonyms for the keywords outlined in the prompt. Our keywords are in bold. When you are brainstorming, if any words pop into your head, definitely list them so you can use them later. You may want to have a highlighter handy when unpacking prompts so you can do just this!!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nHow people have grown up determines the civil and uncivilised behaviours shown by individuals of different backgrounds and childhoods\n\n- Bastian is symbolised as the eagle that circles the youth camp, which is an uncivilised/unwanted form of hawk-like behaviour. This compares to Fredrick's love of birds as a young boy which makes him a softer character.\n\n- Bernd had âno friendsâ as a child - showing his isolated past - which could be described as the reason he leaves his father and goes off to join the Hilter Youth âjust like the other boys.â (find this analysis in the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ)\n\nThere is a fine line that Doerr draws between the stereotypes of women and their ability to remain civilised despite being suppressed by uncivil livelihoods and experiences.\n\n- Jutta is characterised as a strong and independent woman instead of the traditional âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ. Society expects most women to stand on that side of human behaviour and representation however she defies this.\n\nThe strength of women to cross/overcome the line of uncivilised behaviour is significant within the sexual abuse and misconduct driven by soldiers. Can remain true to oneself despite the horrific behaviours a woman faces.\n\n- The role of women on the homefront (i.e. Fredrickâs Mother) highlights the stark contrast between men fighting and thinking about the âmen they killedâ and mothers who put on a âfake smile to appear braveâ (the line between barbaric behaviours of many soldiers and caring/loving behaviours of those on the homefront) - women and their sacrifices is an important topic here\n\nIt is oneâs ability to adapt to change that draws the line between civil and uncivilised behaviours.\n\n- Marie Laureâs ability to look past being a âblind girlâ, and move on from this hardship. She adapts to the âchanging timesâ around her despite others who are suppressed in such an environment (e.g. Etienne and his âdreadâ).\n\nThe game of flying couch is a symbol of escaping the uncivilised world around them (metaphorical line of the human imagination).\n\n- Werner is predominantly overwhelmed by the world around him, which reflects his inability to no longer ask questions as he did as a young boy. Instead, he succumbs to the uncivilised world of death and destruction as he is unable to change.Â\n\nSymbolic use of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in epilogue - symbolises his loss of perspective and wonder of the world,\n\nUltimately it is this line that makes the human existence so unique\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nAfter having brainstormed all the ideas that came to mind, Iâll be approaching the essay prompt with the following contention.Â\n\nIn a world where society is grounded by behaviours both civil and uncivil, there is a clear distinction between humanity's response and representation of these behaviours.\n\nComing up with a clear contention allows you to put together a cohesive and strong essay that answers all aspects of the prompt question.Â\n\nNow, onto developing our topic sentences for each paragraph!\n\nP1: Embedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative*, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life.\n\n*A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling technique Doerr uses to portray events out of chronological order.Â\n\nP2: Encompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them.\n\nP3: In essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nThe art of recognising the ephemera of the human existence is painted by Anthony Doerrâs All the Light We Cannot See as a fine line between behaviours of civilisation and extreme brutality (1). In the inordinate scheme of history, Doerr fosters the dichotomy between those who remain socially aware and others who are marred by desolation as a reflection on one's past. Further subverting the traditional depiction of women in a âwar storyâ, the strength of women is established as a key turning point for individuals to escape barbaric behaviours and cross the line to civilisation. Fundamentally, however, it is the overall response to change that crafts human behaviours that Doerr underpins within society (2).\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(1) it is important to include synonym variation in your opening sentence to ensure that it does not look like you have just copied the prompt and placed it on your page. This idea should be carried out throughout your essay - vary your words and try not to repeat anything, this will ensure you are clear and concise!\n\n(2) In order to improve the flow of your writing, the final topic sentence of your introduction can be a concluding statement on why/how the topic is OVERALL expressed within the novel. When you formulate your contention, it is not enough just to state it, you must also provide reasoning as to why you are writing from this point of view or how you came to this conclusion. For example, my final topic sentence here is a concluding sentence about how I believe a fine line between uncivilised and civil behaviour has an influence throughout the entire novel and Doerrâs intention, oneâs response to change. As you read on, youâll also see that this sentence relates to my final paragraph, thus linking together ideas throughout my essay.\n\nEmbedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life. The initial illustration of the âsmokestacks humeâ and the âblack and dangerousâ imagery (3) of the war paints a clear picture of the destruction and trauma that individuals have lived amongst, thus why people were âdesperate to leaveâ. Empathising with an âold woman who cuddles her toddlerâ on the streets, Doerr laments how young individuals who end up âsurg[ing] towards one cause,â which this toddler may similarly grow up to do in the Hitler Youth, directly reflects the âintense maliceâ of their childhood. This idea that oneâs past affects the future behaviours of a generation is further captured within the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ (4), which outlines how Berndâs upbringing with âno friendsâ promotes him to âjust leaveâ, in order to experience something new, despite knowing this something new would bring unjust decisions into his life. Becoming âjust like the other boysâ, Doerr suggests that the line between civil and uncivil behaviours is so thin (5) that a mere need to escape oneâs past is enough to create feelings of negativity and at worst death. Encapsulating the darkness that prevails over such individuals, the symbolism of Bastianâs âsharp eyesâ (6) poetically describes the eagle that circles the youth camp where Doerr seeks to paint a metaphorical cruel depiction of Bastian as a harmful hawk. Underpinning the fine line between human behaviour, Fredrickâs âlove of birdsâ is âso beautiful[ly]â representative of his respectful nature and approach to life while Bastianâs immersion in âthe self interest of the worldâ ultimately explains how his fallacious behaviour towards others is embodied by his environment within the war. Overall, the behaviours displayed by humanity are a reflection of past experiences and how they shape the individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) Imagery is a key aspect of All the Light We Cannot See and goes hand in hand with the vast symbolism Doerr uses within his novel. When including imagery, it is great to include a few related quotes; however, you must then ensure you analyse and delve into how this technique (imagery) demonstrates the idea you are writing about. In this case, the imagery of the chimneys and foggy/dirty air illustrates the desolate environment individuals lived in during the war.\n\n(4) This chapter is something not many students analyse or touch on so if youâre looking to add some spice to your writing I would definitely take a look and see what you can extract from some of those more unique and nuanced chapters!\n\n(5) Referencing the âfine lineâ continually throughout your essay ensures that you are staying on track and not talking about topics away from the prompt.Â\n\n(6) Symbolism is very important in All the Light We Cannot See. The use of the quote âsharp eyesâ, really shows that you have considered not only how Doerr simply explores the behaviour of each character but also the physical interpretations of how individuals may demonstrate a certain persona within the novel. This focus on character description on top of dialogue adds extra layers to your writing.Â\n\nEncompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them. Instead of characterising Jutta as a âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ, whom the soldier will âfight and die forâ, Doerr proffers the unconventional humanisation of women on the home front to pay tribute to the power of staying true to oneself (7). Despite facing the barbaric reality of âsex crazed torturersâ, Doerr illuminates Juttaâs capacity to âlook them in the eyeâ rather than shy away from them as a meditation on her own morals of (8) âwhat is rightâ. The tragic nature (9) of such abuse is specifically chronicled by Doerr to concatenate (10) the continual brave behaviours Jutta portrays even when succumbing to the line that attempts to draw women away from strength and independence. Further referencing her desire to âlock away memoriesâ of the past in her life after the war, the novel posits the importance of women during a period of inordinate history as a powerful force that remained civil even in times of âabsolute blacknessâ. From the perspective of Fredrickâs mother, Doerr seeks to display how her âfake smile to appear braveâ outlines how many mothers and women had to remain strong for their children, such as Fredrick with brain damage, even though they were so close to falling into a world of sorrow and isolation. A clear segregation between soldiers who thought about âthe men they killedâ and women who were made to âfeel complicit in an unspeakable crimeâ (11) they did not commit overall affirms the sacrifices women made during the war and without such sacrifices and strength the thin line between behavioural acts would be broken.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(7) Here I have included an analysis of Doerrâs message - what he is trying to say or show within his novel. Ultimately an author has a message they seek to share with the world. Providing your own interpretation of certain messages the author may be attempting to send to his readers adds real depth to your writing, showing that you are not only considering the novel itself but the purpose of the author and how this novel came to explore the fundamental ideas of the essay prompt.\n\n(8) This quote directly relates to the keyword: civilised behaviour. Finding quotes that are also specific to your prompt is crucial to producing an essay that flows and has meaning.Â\n\n(9) The use of adjectives within the essay paints the picture of whether an act is civil or uncivil which is ultimately what we are attempting to discuss from the prompt. Here the phrase âtragic natureâ, underpins the essence of unjust behaviours shown by the soldiers.\n\n(10) Concatenate - link/connect ideas together\n\n(11) Comparing aspects within the novel is a great way to show your understanding and how the same theme or idea can be shown in many different ways.Â\n\nIn essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world. Established by Marie Laureâs characterisation as a âblind girlâ who can âproject anything onto the black screen of her imaginationâ, Doerr illuminates her ability to adapt to the âchanging timesâ around her. She is seen to be âcarried away by reveriesâ rather than a plethora of voices who âforgo all comfortsâ and âeat and breathe nationâ. Through the chapter and make-believe game âflying couchâ (12), Marieâs nature to âsurrender firearmsâ with Etienne in their imagination is a symbolic adoption to escape the world around them, hence the uncivilised society they are learning to live in. Doerrâs congruent imagery of Etienneâs changing voice of âdreadâ to âvelvetyâ as he becomes intertwined within âMarieâs braveryâ underpins the ability for individuals to seamlessly cross the line from a lack of cultured behaviour to a world of hope and prosperity. Contrasting this, however, Werner, an individual who was initially curious about âhow the world worksâ, is so âoverwhelmed by how quickly things are changing around [him]â that his âinterest in peaceâ is stripped away and no longer exists due to his inability to change with a changing world. Doerr, therefore, laments the transmogrification of his character as a reflection of his uncivil thoughts and ideals as a soldier, ultimately resulting in his loss of ability to ask questions. This idea places emphasis on Volkheimer receiving Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in the epilogue (13) where the translation of the bookâs title âFragenâ - to âaskâ in English - is symbolic of the moment Werner decided to âwork, join, confess, dieâ he immediately lost the open mind and curiosity he once had. Ultimately, the dichotomy between these two lives and their opposing character transformations resembles the line between remaining calm or acting out of haste when subject to change.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(12) Analysing not only the game but the whole meaning behind chapters and why Doerr has given them certain names is an interesting avenue to take. Here âflying couchâ not only underpins the imagination of Marie Laure but also symbolises freedom and bravery within just the name itself.\n\n(13) The analysis and evidence used from the epilogue is a crucial part of this paragraph and is significant to Doerrâs novel. Unpacking All the Light We Cannot See, there is a lot of evidence and juicy ideas you can draw from the beginning and end of the novel. Here I have almost analysed the meaning of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ to the bone; however, this adds a lot of depth to your writing as Iâm sure your ultimate goal is to make your essays as unique as possible?!\n\nAs a project of humanism, Doerr seeks to portray a fine segregation in people's behaviours as the microcosm (14) of what makes the human existence so unique. Following the journeys of individuals who even âsee a century turnââ the novel displays how oneâs past has an immense influence on how their future values, actions and behaviours grow and develop. Further subverting the stereotypical representation of women living in a war, Doerr establishes an acknowledgment of their roles and strength in the face of cruel situations. Ostensibly, it is the human capacity to adapt to change that marks the difference between what is just and unjust in a society that weighs both on a very unstable scale.Â\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(14)Â Microcosm - a community, place or situation regarded as encapsulating in miniature the characteristics of something much larger.\n\n---\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our All the Light We Cannot See Prompts blog post.

Good luck!\n\nAuthorial intent is without a doubt one of the most important parts of any analytical essay in VCE English because talking about it is what offers the deepest level of analysis and shows the examiners that you have thought deeply about the text at hand. If you can discuss authorial intent effectively, youâll be able to show that you have a solid understanding of what you are talking about and that youâre not working exclusively with surface-level ideas.\n\nWhat Is Authorial Intent?\n\nWhen we talk about authorial intent, what is really being referenced is the authorâs reason for writing their piece in the way that they have and what messages they are trying to convey. Essentially, itâs what your teacher wants you to think about when they ask you things like âwhy is the door red?â. More generally speaking, why has the author made a point of telling us as readers the weather at that time? Why has that character been given that particular line of dialogue? Why have they brought in that specific tone for this part of the text? These are all the kinds of questions that you should be asking yourself when youâre reading through material that you have to analyse.\n\nYou might also hear authorial intent talked about as the writerâs âviews and valuesâ. If youâre unsure what views and values actually mean, you can kind of think of it as though the âviewsâ are how the author sees something and the âvaluesâ are how the author thinks about something. Essentially, their opinions and perspectives are their views, whereas their morals and principles are their values. These two elements will often be central to the overall intention behind writing their text.Â Â\n\nWhy Is Authorial Intent Important?\n\nAuthorial intent plays a major role in your interpretation of the text; if you canât figure out what the intent is, you will often miss out on key points and messages throughout the text. If you are lucky, the author will make it really clear to you as a reader what their intent is; however, this often is not the case. That being said, whether their intent is stated or implied doesnât matter - there will always be something there for you to talk about.\n\nHow To âFindâ Authorial Intent in the Text: Key Identifiers To Look Out For\n\nIf you come across a text that makes it a little bit more difficult to discern what the author is actually trying to say, a good place to start is to look at the context behind the piece of writing.Â\n\nThe time period the novel/movie/play is set in is often a good indicator of what the author is saying. The author will often be using their text as a means by which they can comment on or critique one or more elements of that society, or perhaps as a metaphor for events that are occurring at the time the text is/was written. Alternatively, they may be portraying their view about the events that actually occurred during that time. For example, if you have a text that is set in the Georgian era, it is likely that the authorâs message has something to do with colonialism or imperialist mindsets (zeitgeists) because this was a very dominant theme in that society.Â\n\nSome other reasons you might consider an author having could include:Â\n\nto highlight the importance of something\n\nto criticise a behaviour or mindset\n\nto ridicule certain actions\n\nto warn against something\n\nto discourage people from doing something\n\nto convey certain political messages or controversial opinions\n\nRealistically there is a broad range of things that the author could be saying, it's your job to pinpoint what that really is.Â\n\nOnce youâve determined what it is the author is generally talking about, you then need to start thinking about the way that this has been represented. This is where you start to bring in the characters, the events, the dialogue, the inner monologues. Basically, you start looking for the elements that the author has added, not necessarily for a story-telling purpose but, more so, to convey their views and values through the text. This isnât always going to jump right out at you so there may be a bit of deeper thinking involved.Â\n\nAnother good place to start is to try to identify the central themes of a text. This might be something like âJudgementâ, âRedemptionâ, âGuiltâ, etc. The author wouldn't have made these themes so relevant if they didn't have anything to say about them. Once again, this is where you look at the quotes, the setting, the characters and other features (as mentioned before) just with a more theme-focused approach.Â\n\nUseful Vocabulary & Sentence ExamplesÂ\n\nWhen you come to actually putting together a paragraph, it is really important that you donât forget to include authorial intent at some stage (at least once per paragraph). If you work with a TEEL structure (watch from 05:10) as the baseline, these kinds of comments about the authorâs intent would usually be located within the âexplanationâ section. A good way to double-check that youâve incorporated authorial intent is to go back through your paragraph and make sure that the authorâs name is in there somewhere. If youâve talked about authorial intent you likely will have said something like:\n\nââIn doing so, (Author) condones the (whatever it is they condone).â\n\nSentence Templates\n\nBelow are some sample sentence structures that you might think about using throughout your essays. Obviously, the particular vocabulary will vary depending on what your text is and which message you are talking about, but these are good as a guide.\n\nâ\n\nThrough (example from text) AUTHOR (offers, provides, asserts) a (condemnation, evaluationâ¦) of (idea, theme, concept, actionâ¦)\n\nE.g. Through emphasising the internal struggle faced by Rooke during the floggings, Grenville offers a condemnation of the Empireâs heinous approach to loyalty, as the threat of âwirling at the end of the ropeâ essentially forces individuals to value duty over conscience. (The Lieutenant)\n\nâ\n\nIn doing so, AUTHOR (establishes, condemns, revealsâ¦)\n\nE.g.

Most importantly, I hope that you can at least start recognising the way that the authorâs voice comes through in the particular texts that you are studying, and that you can start looking at including some of those observations and ideas when you're writing your responses.\n\nAuthorial Intent is an aspect that's going to be relevant to Text Response & Comparative for the most part, but it's also handy to understand for Language Analysis!\n\nThe Erratics is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSetting is a literary element that refers to the context of where a story takes place, usually alluding to the time and location. Your expectations of a story that takes place in Victorian England would differ greatly from a story set in late 2000s Australia, showing us that the historical, social and geographical aspects of the setting shape the meaning of the text.\n\nIn the memoir The Erratics, the setting plays a vital role in Vicki Laveau-Harvie's storytelling. From the beginning of the novel, Laveau-Harvie uses both the title and prologue to foreground the importance of the Okotoks Erratic (a geographical phenomenon in Alberta, Canada) to establish the role that place and belonging have played in her life. Further reinforcing the importance of the setting, the memoirâs narrative follows Laveau-Harvieâs experience flying back to Alberta, Canada (her hometown), after having moved to and started a new life in Australia.Â\n\nWhy Focus on Setting When Writing a Text Response?\n\nThe setting can be useful evidence to have in your repertoire as it helps you show that you not only have an understanding of the ideas of the text but also how those ideas are constructed. When looking at the criteria you will be marked against in the end-of-year exam you will see that to score a 7 and above in Section A you need to consider the âconstructionâ of the text (read more here). Construction refers to your ability to discuss the parts that make up a text through the use of metalanguage as evidence to support your views. The setting is just one of the ways you can address construction in The Erratics, but, as a text so focused on physical environments, itâs a good type of metalanguage to start with.\n\nCanada\n\nFamous for producing Justin Bieber and maple syrup, Canada has a similar history to Australia. Canada has an Indigenous population who inhabited the land for thousands of years before British and French expeditions came and colonised the land. In the 1700s, due to various conflicts, France ceded most of its North American colonies while the United Kingdom stayed. Over time the country gained greater autonomy and, like Australia, it is now a constitutional monarchy with a prime minister but recognises the British royal family as its sovereign. Further mirroring Australia, Canada also has a colonial past that it is still reckoning with as recent headlines about the human remains of hundreds of Indigenous people at a residential school reminds us.Â\n\nVicki is specifically from Alberta, and the majority of the novel is about her experiences returning there after having moved to Australia (at the start of the memoir she had been estranged from her parents for 18 years). Known for its natural beauty and its nature reserves, Alberta is a part of Western Canada. Alberta is one of only two landlocked provinces in Canada which is interesting considering that Vicki leaves it for a country famous for its beaches and coastal cities.Â\n\nWhen annotating the text, highlight the descriptions of the setting. Youâll notice that whenÂ Laveau-Harvie describes Alberta or Canada as a whole she presents the country as being dangerous and hostile. An example of this is the blunt statement that the âcold will kill you. Nothing personalâ. However, Laveau-Harvie does find some solace in the landscape, observing the beauty of the âopalescentâ peaks and the comfort in predictable seasons.Â\n\nVickiâs Parentâs Home\n\nThe first description Laveau-Harvie gives us of her family home is to call it âParadise, [with] twenty acres with a ranch house on a rise, nothing between you and the sky and the distant mountains.â The idyllic image foregrounds the natural landscape but is then immediately juxtaposed with the description of the home as a âtime-capsule house sealed against the outside world for a decadeâ. This description heightens Vickiâs mother and fatherâs isolation from the outside world and alludes to the hostility of the home that is reaffirmed with the doors that âopen to no oneâ. The family home becomes an extended metaphor for Vickiâs parents themselves, with the description of it as a âno-go zoneâ, hinting at the sistersâ estrangement from their parents who have shut them out.Â\n\nMoreover, the land the house sits on does not produce any crops despite it being such a large expanse of land, heightening the homeâs disconnect from the natural world. This detachment from the natural world is furthered by her labelling her parents as âtransplants from the cityâ and contrasting them to locals who âstill make preserves in the summerâ. Vickiâs mother in particular is at odds with nature due to materialism, such as her wardrobes being full of fur coats.\n\nThe Erratics + Napi\n\nIn the prologue we are introduced to the Okotoks Erratic as being situated in âa landscape of uncommon beautyâ with the Erratic itself being something that âdominates the landscape, roped off and isolated, the danger it presents to anyone trespassing palpableâ. The memoir then immediately shifts to Vickiâs experience in the hospital trying to convince the staff that she is her motherâs daughter, drawing a parallel between the dominating and dangerous landscape to the dominating and dangerous mother. In the memoir, the Erratic is an extended metaphor for the mother with both the land and the mother being described as âunsafeâ, âdominat[ing]â and a âdangerâ. Moreover, the structural choice of opening the novel with the Erratic makes its presence felt throughout the novel even though it is not mentioned again until the end of the text.Â\n\nIn contrast to the prologue, the epilogue has a feeling of peace and reconciliation as the mother and what she has represented to her family is reconciled with the landscape. This is particularly pertinent as the geographical and spiritual origins of the rock revealed in the epilogue is a story of stability after a rupture. This alludes to the ability of Vickiâs family to heal after the trauma inflicted on them by the mother. The epilogue could also be understood as a reminder of humanity's insignificance in the face of nature and larger forces, as represented by Napi.\n\nWhile Laveau-Harvie does not directly address Canada's colonial past in her memoir outside of the inclusion of Napi, the colonial presence is felt throughout the memoir through the setting of both Australia and Canada. These settings allude to how living on stolen land means that while individuals - particularly middle-class, white individuals - may not always recognise and address the colonial history of the land they live on, the fact that land was never ceded is still felt.Â\n\nAustralia\n\nAs discussed before, Canada and Australia are similar as they are both former British colonies that are now constitutional monarchies, so why would Vicki want to move to a place that is similar to where she already lived and experienced trauma?Â\n\nThere are a few potential answers, the first being the geographical distance. There are over 1300kms between Sydney and Alberta and, considering the trauma Vicki and her sister have experienced, it stands to reason that she would want to put distance between her childhood home and her adult life. This leads to the second reason, travelling to âFar flung placesâ as a method to deal with trauma. While in Canada, Vicki reminisces about the âboozed-up Brits on Bondiâ that embodies her life in Australia. The evocative, alliterative image creates a stark contrast between warm and carefree Australia and cold and emotionally taxing Canada, reinforcing how travelling provides individuals with a means to survive their traumatic childhoods and create new lives for themselves.Â\n\nWhen writing about setting you do not need to be an expert in geography. As this blog post has shown, to understand Laveau-Harvieâs use of setting in The Erratics you only need to know about two countries, so next time you write a text response, consider using your understanding of setting to show your teacher or examiners that youâve thought about the textâs construction.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into this text, Zac breaks down key themes and quotes in The Erratics over on this blog.\n\nThis blog was updated on 21/10/2020.\n\nContents\n\n1.

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nLewis is faced with a seemingly impossible task â to bring order to the chaotic world of the asylum â yet in the process of doing so, he develops hugely as a person. Although, itâs important not to take Lewisâ development at face value. His growth is used to highlight many of Nowraâs values on issues surrounding love, fidelity, madness and reality, just to name a few. Itâs also important to look at the development (or lack of development) of other characters and think about why Nowra might have included them in the play. Luckily for you, CosÃ¬ is quite a short play and doesnât have a huge cast of characters. However, this means that itâs even more important to get a great understanding of each character â theyâre all there for a reason!Â\n\nTo fully understand this text, youâll need to move beyond analysing characters and dialogue and consider Nowraâs main messages. CosÃ¬ is essentially a social commentary, packed full of criticisms of conventional perspectives and values. Also, CosÃ¬ is full of symbols and imagery, which can help you score highly on your essays if you integrate them into your work. Lastly, it's vital to remember that CosÃ¬ is a play, not a book, and on top of that, it is a play within a play. This means that setting, structure and stage directions are all crucial, and make for a high-scoring essay.\n\nSetting\n\nMelbourne Mental Institution, Australia during the 1970s.\n\nAll of the action takes place inside a burnt-out, derelict theatre. This serves to create an atmosphere of confinement for the audience, encouraging them to reflect on the stifling experience of the patients.\n\nCosÃ¬ is divided into two acts and nine scenes. The play is dominated by Lewisâ development. Act 1 highlights his uncertainty and distance from the world of the asylum. Whereas by Act 2, we see Lewis become more invested in the patients and the asylum, as his relationships with the other characters grow. Lewisâ development is symbolised through the changing imagery throughout the play, specifically fire and water.\n\nCosÃ¬ also is a piece of metatheatre, which Nowra achieves through structuring it as a âplay within a playâ. Metatheatre means that the play draws attention to its distance from reality. This makes sense in relation to CosÃ¬, as Nowra is continually encouraging his audience to accept their own reality instead of falling into escapism. Including CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte in CosÃ¬ also serves to highlight the difference in popular opinion between Mozartâs era and the 1970s, while emphasising the continuity of love. This contrast also helps Lewis to come to terms with his valuation of love over war, which is at odds with the common opinions of his society.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe line between reality and illusion is explored through the characters who are labelled as âinsaneâ as well as those considered ânormal.â Nowra demonstrates that reality is unique for each person, and often people may slip into illusions in order to avoid the truth. It is suggested that although they may not have been completely ânormalâ, those considered to be âinsaneâ still possess great insight that ânormalâ people may overlook. Additionally, CosÃ¬ reminds the reader of the absurdities of a mental asylum shunned by society, which would only have added to patientsâ instabilities, especially as families dealt with the matter secretly. Furthermore, the issue of love and fidelity that was valued so highly in Mozartâs era, is proven to still be relevant in our modern times. Ultimately, CosÃ¬ is a play that criticises traditional structures and views of society â whether they be asylums, university education or harsh stigma. Nowra encourages his audience to accept both the complexity of people and of life, which begins with accepting your own reality.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nLewis\n\nThe protagonist of CosÃ¬, Lewis is a new university graduate who has agreed to direct a play cast with patients from a mental institution because he needs money. At first, Lewis shares the same values as his friends Nick and Lucy -Â that love is ânot so importantâ in the days of politics and war. During the time he spends with the patients, however, Lewis experiences a turning point in his understanding and perception of people. By the end of the play, Lewis learns to value love and friendship over war and politics, even stating that âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean as muchâ. In emphasising the development of Lewisâ values away from the social norm, Nowra highlights the confining nature of society and the danger of its limited focus, which fails to recognise the value of love and companionship.Â\n\nAdditionally, Nowra blurs the lines between insanity and sanity by portraying Lewis as a bridge between the ârealâ world and that of the asylum. At the beginning of the play, Lewis states that his grandmother was in an asylum. However, despite knowing that âshe had gone madâ, he reflects that âshe was still [his] grandmother.â This, alongside his passion for Julie, enables Lewis to see the patients as people, not their illnesses. Therefore, he subconsciously allows himself to be influenced by them, just as he influences them. This contradicts the traditional views surrounding the unproductivity of the mentally ill and instead highlights their value and worth. Therefore, Nowra warns against dismissing individuals who are mentally ill, instead highlighting their capacity to garner change and therefore be productive and valuable members of society.\n\nMoreover, not only is Lewis involved in directing CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, but he also finds himself playing the part of Fernando. This again further reinforces his role as a bridge between society and the asylum (and his connection to its patients), and he ends up embodying the role. Like Fernando, Lewis is unfaithful to his partner. While still in a relationship with his girlfriend Lucy, Lewis becomes intimate with a patient, Julie. Nowra uses his unfaithfulness as evidence of the indiscriminate nature of infidelity â it is not restricted only to women.\n\nFinally, CosÃ¬ explores how Lewis deals with a hardship that he essentially created for himself â he signed up to direct the play. This links to Nowraâs view of the senselessness of war, which he views as a problem that mankind has created for themselves.\n\nLucy\n\nGirlfriend and roommate of Lewis, Lucy cannot understand why Lewis is directing a play about love when thousands are dying in the war. She has an affair with Nick, who shares similar beliefs â that politics and the Vietnam War protest are more important than anything else. The flippant nature with which she regards her affair with Nick as purely sexual is also reflective of her lack of value towards love. Thus, Nowra portrays Lucy as a personification of the societal norms of the 1970s â she is political, into free love and challenges traditional notions of femininity.\n\nFurthermore, it is ironic that Lucy and Lewis have similar names. At the start of the play, Lewis allows himself to be influenced by Lucyâs values rather than his own, but by the end, Lewisâ true views prove to be very different from hers.Â\n\nLucy also acts as a catalyst for Lewisâ change and development. She pushes him to âmake a choiceâ between the world of insanity and fidelity that represents truth for Lewis, or the world of sanity, free love and politics that Lewis comes to view as restrictive and stifling.\n\nNick\n\nAn experienced student director, roommate and friend of Lewis who is heavily involved in the moratorium (a protest against the Vietnam War). He promises to help Lewis direct CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, however he quickly breaks this vow in order to spend time furthering his political career with Lucy. Lewis later discovers that Lucy and Nick are having an affair. Unlike Lewis, however, Nick views his relationship with Lucy as âonly sexâ, therefore suggesting his superficiality and lack of compassion.Â\n\nThis superficiality is further shown through his obsession with the moratorium and his disinterest in Lewisâ CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte. He criticises Lewis for prioritising theatre over politics, stating that âonly mad people in this day and age would do a work about love and infidelity.â This suggests that what drives Nick is a desire to be seen doing the ânormalâ and ârightâ things, rather than an intrinsic belief that what he is doing is good. He views life as a series of transactions and values activities based on the immediate benefit that they bring him. For example, he admitted to helping Lewis with his direction only âso [Lewis would] help [him] on the moratorium committeeâ.Â\n\nOverall, Nick lives up to his label of being an âegotistical pigâ who âlikes the sound of his own voiceâ. He is used by Nowra as a benchmark with which Lewisâ development is compared (i.e. we can see how much Lewis has developed by comparing him to Nick). For example, at the start of the play Lewis shares similar superficial values to Nick, admitting to only take the directing job for a bit of money; however, by the end of CosÃ¬, he holds vastly different views than Nick.\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nThemes\n\nFidelity & Infidelity\n\nAccording to Mozartâs CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, fidelity is depicted as an ideal that is never achieved. Since âwomen are like thatâ â the interpretation of âCosÃ¬ fan tutteâ, Mozart supported the belief that men should simply accept that women will inevitably be disloyal in relationships. Nowra echoes this view of women through Lewis and Lucyâs relationship. While Lucy is âsleepingâ with Lewis, she is also triflingly âhaving sexâ with Nick. When Lewis discovers Lucyâs betrayal, she waves aside his shock, defending herself, âit is not as if weâre married.â The revelation thus does prove Mozart right, that âwomanâs constancy is like the Arabian Phoenix. Everyone swears it exists, but no one has seen it.â\n\nAlthough the women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are shown to be unfaithful, so are the men. While the men in CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte do not actively participate in adultery, they do fabricate their departure to the war and also disguise themselves as âAlbanians.â Their deception is also a betrayal to their wives. Meanwhile, Don Alfonso manipulates everyone. As seen in CosÃ¬, Lewis is unfaithful to Lucy as he kisses Julie during rehearsals. Julie later reveals that she has a girlfriend who she would prefer to be with, confirming that both men and women are unfaithful in relationships, despite whatever values they may claim to have.\n\nNowra considers many perspectives of love and fidelity, without offering a definitive opinion. Instead, he explores the progression (or stagnation) of charactersâ opinions on love and contrasts them to those of other characters, in the hope of highlighting its complexity. Nick and Lucy both view love as an indulgence that is incompatible with politics and secondary to lifeâs basic needs. Whereas Lewis claims, âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean that muchâ. These differences between Nick and Lucyâs view on love and Lewisâ, are major contributors to the deterioration of their relationships. Therefore, Nowra shows that communication and truthfulness are needed for healthy, and reciprocal, relationships.\n\nOverall, while CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte presents love and fidelity as wavering, Nowra provides a more practical view of love. Nowra suggests that love is complex and cannot be fully understood or tamed, instead portraying it as akin to madness. As love is universal, this view ties in nicely with his non-judgmental perspective on madness and insanity.\n\nSanity & Insanity\n\nThe line between sanity and insanity is explored through the juxtaposition of the patients and society. In the 1970s, those who behaved abnormally were declared to be âinsaneâ and placed in mental institutions that were shunned by society. As scientific developments have now informed us, these environments often failed to assist their patients. The use of electric shock therapy, for example, frequently led to severe, long-term negative effects upon patients.\n\nWhile the patients were viewed as âmadmenâ by outsiders, Lewis soon discovers that they are, in many ways, ordinary people. Although each patient has a mental flaw, all possess interesting opinions and beliefs on different matters. Additionally, Nowra encourages his readers to view insanity as more complex than a diagnosis or something that can be fixed with a âcoat of paintâ. Instead, he suggests that insanity is imposed on people through the judgment of others.\n\nNowra also attempts to blur the lines between sanity and insanity to emphasize the indiscriminate nature of madness. This is seen through Lewisâ character, who consistently bridges the gap between madness and normalcy. For example, despite his âsaneâ status, he is mistaken for a patient by Justin, joins Roy in imitating electric shock therapy, replaces Doug in the play, and stands with the patients against Justin.\n\nOverall, Nowra portrays insanity as a matter of perspective, rather than an objective diagnosis. He refuses to define madness, instead depicting it as somewhere on the spectrum of human behaviour. In doing so, he critisises traditional perspectives of sanity and insanity and instead encourages his audiences to consider the complexity of madness.Â\n\nReality & Illusion\n\nThe question of what is real or an illusion is weaved through the patientsâ state of mentality. As shown through Ruth who struggles to pretend like she is having real coffee on stage, it is difficult for some to distinguish reality from illusion, even if it is clear to everyone else. For others, they may willingly refuse the truth and succumb to an illusion. Lewis deluded himself into believing that Lucy was faithful, when all signs (such as Nick residing in the same home and Nick and Lucy spending time together) indicated that Lucy was, in fact, blatantly disloyal. Much like Lewisâ protective delusion, Roy uses illusions of a happy childhood to shield him from facing his reality. This builds upon his tendencies to blame others for his behaviour â he is inherently unable to face the truth of his âinsanityâ and so manipulates his reality to make it more bearable.Â\n\nThroughout CosÃ¬, Nowra also explores the relativity of reality. For the patients of the asylum, pretending to give electric shock therapy to others âseems realerâ than âkissing and stuffâ, whereas the opposite would be true in âordinaryâ society. However, CosÃ¬ also suggests that imagination has the capacity to empower. Through participating in the play, which is an illusory form of reality, the patients are able to explore their views on love and commitment.\n\nUltimately, the behaviour of characters such as Roy and Ruth encourages us to consider the reliability (or unreliability) of our own perceptions. Alongside this, Nowra stresses the importance of being able to accept your own reality, as he shows that characters who fail to do so, also fail to experience personal growth (e.g. Roy, Julie).\n\nSymbolism\n\nBurnt-Out Theatre\n\nThe setting of a burnt-out theatre depicts the miserable environment in which the patients of mental institutions are forced to live. As they are ostracised by the community, a lack of care and support is shown through the rejected and deteriorating theatre. The patientsâ considerable enthusiasm highlights their unfortunate circumstances, since even a chance to spend their time in an old building performing a play causes much excitement.\n\nAlthough we see the theatre being touched up with new lights and a âcoat of paintâ, it still remains derelict and run-down. Nowra uses this to symbolise the futility of surface-level treatments (such as medication and isolation) of mental illnesses, and how we should instead focus on seeing the person behind the illness.\n\nHowever, Nowra also uses the theatre as a symbol of hope. Despite its desolation, it is in the theatre that Lewis feels safe to grow and develop. Additionally, Julie and Lewisâ kiss takes place on the theatreâs stage. The kiss itself represents Lewis becoming more comfortable with himself and his increasingly counter-cultural views.\n\nArabian Phoenix\n\nThe women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are compared with the Arabian Phoenix. The mythical creature is a representation of women, beautiful and enchanting, capturing men such as the god Apollo with its voice. This reflects the power of women to attract men. Nevertheless, its rarity, as often commented on in CosÃ¬ , is linked with the seemingly infrequent loyalty demonstrated by women.\n\nThe frequent reference to the Arabian Phoenix throughout CosÃ¬ continually reinforces the playâs misogynistic undertone. Its rarity is likened to the absence of womenâs fidelity, yet never male fidelity. Similarly, Nowra invites his audience to condemn Lucyâs unfaithfulness towards Lewis, yet we are not encouraged to feel the same way about Lewisâ unfaithfulness to Lucy. Â\n\nLight and Dark\n\nThe lights in Act 1, Scene 1 highlight Lewisâ entrance into a new world, where he befriends patients who will ultimately help him to learn and develop. At first Lewis, much like Lucy and Nick, possesses a âpitch blackâ perspective of the world. This is a representation of their modern beliefs that circulate around politics and war. When the lights are turned on, Roy is present, demonstrating that the patients of the mental institutions are the source for Lewisâ changing perspective throughout the play. Nowra also uses the lights to represent the hope for change that Lewis brings to the patients, and vice versa.\n\nLight is also used to directly juxtapose the chaos and desperation that darkness brings. Before Lewis entered the theatre, it was dark and derelict, symbolising the abandonment and hopelessness of the asylumâs patients. This desperation is viewed in another light during Julie and Lewisâ kiss (which takes place in the dark). In this instance, their desire for each other and the chaos that ensues is liberating for Lewis, as it enables him to come to terms with what he truly values.\n\nHowever, Julie notes that the wards are ânever really darkâ as âthereâs always a light on in the corridor.â In this sense, darkness symbolises autonomy and freedom, whereas light represents the constant monitoring and scrutinising that the patients are subjected to.\n\nEssay Topics\n\n1. CosÃ¬ contends that some things are more important than politics.\n\n2. In CosÃ¬, the âinsaneâ characters are quite normal.\n\n3. The line between reality and illusion is often blurred.\n\n4. Ironically, it is through the âmadmenâ that Lewis learns what is truly important.\n\n5. Nick and Lucyâs âmodernâ value of free love is depicted to be a backwards belief.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nCharacter-Based Prompt: It is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nSimply spot a characterâs name and there you have it, itâs a character-based prompt. However, itâs important to recognise that your essay does not need to revolve around only the character(s) in the prompt but should also incorporate discussion of other major and minor characters as well.Â\n\nIn this topic, it is important to incorporate other characters, such as the patients, into your essay, because they are crucial to Lewisâ development. To ensure that you stay on topic, it is best to include a paragraph (or paragraphs) that explore characters other than Lewis and their development. Also try and focus on different areas/types of development (i.e. not just Lewisâ changing values).Â\n\nHighlight Key Words:\n\nIt is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well.Â\n\nFind Synonyms:\n\nDevelops: learns, grows, changes, flourishes, progresses, maturesÂ\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nCosÃ¬ explores the development/growth of multiple characters, including Lewis.Â\n\nLewis is the central catalyst that enables other characterâs development to be seen (such as Ruthâs and Zacâs)Â\n\nHowever, we also see characters who fail to develop. This is either because they fail to accept their own reality (Roy) or they fail to accept the errors in their thinking (Lucy, Nick)Â\n\nNowra also uses Lewis as the benchmark against which the development of other characters is measured. For example, Nickâs lack of development is highlighted through comparing his stagnation/unchanging ways to Lewisâ growth.Â\n\nLewisâ development is facilitated by the patients. Nowra uses this to suggest the productivity of the mentally ill and challenge traditional stereotypes that label them as incapable.Â\n\nThrough Lewisâ development, Nowra highlights the falsity in societal stereotypes of the mentally ill (i.e. Lewisâs views change from being discriminatory and stereotypical to more compassionate, and well founded.)Â\n\nImagery and symbolism are used to represent development and growth (fire and water) as well as Lewisâ catalytic nature (light and dark).Â\n\nStep 3: Create a PlanÂ\n\nContention: Nowra encourages his audience to reconsider their perspective on the mentally ill by highlighting their capacity to not only change themselves, but enact change in others.\n\nTopic Sentence 1: Through his exploration of Lewisâ changing ideals during CosÃ¬, Nowra attempts to highlight the value of companionship and productivity of the mentally ill, which act to increase Lewisâ confidence when faced with adversity.\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing ideas on love and fidelity, Lewisâ changing levels of subservience to Lucy and NickÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Not so important.\"\n\n\"Without love, the world wouldnât mean as much.\"\n\n\"They are coming to take me away, ha, ha.\"\n\n\"Not sing that.\"\n\n\"I said, donât sing that song.\"\n\nLinking Sentence(s): In contrasting Lewisâ meekness to his boldness, Nowra alludes to the personal benefits that personal growth can have. Additionally, he ultimately encourages his audience to view Lewisâ learning as evidence against the common notion of the unproductivity of the mentally ill, as we see Lewisâ development flourish during his time at the asylum.\n\nTopic Sentence 2: Moreover, throughout CosÃ¬ we see Lewis develop a greater understanding of the complexity of madness due to his partnership with the patients.Â\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing perspective of the patients, Lewisâ involvement with the patients beyond his role as director, fire and water imageryÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Uncertain.\"\n\n\"Will go bezerk without their medication.\"\n\n\"Unable to believe he has found himself caught up in [directing].\"\n\n\"Water drip[ping] though the hole in the roof.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, through highlighting the development of Lewisâ views towards insanity, Nowra positions his audience to reflect on the complexity of madness and thus warns of the danger of stereotypes.\n\nTopic Sentence 3: Furthermore, as an outsider, Lewis assists the patients in their development, acting as their connection to the real world and ultimately providing a space for them to grow and flourish.Â\n\nExamples: Juxtaposition of light and dark, Ruthâs development.Â\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Chink of light.\"\n\n\"Burnt out theatre.\"\n\n\"Real coffee.\"\n\n\"Real cappuccino machine.\"\n\n\"Wasnât [her], it was the character.\"\n\n\"Time and motion expert.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, Nowra explores the learning and growth of characters in CosÃ¬ to not only highlight the necessity of a humanistic approach to treating mental illness, but also to illustrate the nature of mental health as a continuum, on which no one person needs to be stationary forever.â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our CosÃ¬ Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

The first half of the novel is dedicated to an almost anthropological depiction of Igbo village life and culture through following the life of the protagonist Okonkwo. Okonkwo is the greatest wrestler and warrior alive in the nine villages and beyond. He has dedicated his life to achieving status and proving his strength to avoid becoming like his father Unoka â a lazy, improvident, but gentle man. Weakness is Okonkwoâs greatest fear. After men in another village kill a woman from Umuofia, a boy named Ikemefuna is given to Umuofia as compensation and lives in Okonkwoâs compound until the Gods decide his fate. Ikemefuna quickly becomes part of Okonkwoâs family; he is like a brother to Okonkwoâs son Nwoye and is secretly loved by Okonkwo as well. Over the next three years, the novel follows Okonkwoâs family through harvest seasons, religious festivals, cultural rituals, and domestic disputes. Okonkwo is shown to be more aggressive than other Igbo men and is continually criticized and rebuked by the village for his violence and temper. When the Oracle of the Hills and Caves decides that Ikemefuna must be killed, Okonkwo is warned by a respected elder to have no hand in the boyâs death because Ikemefuna calls him âfatherâ. However, afraid of being thought weak, when Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo in hope of protection, Okonkwo delivers the fatal blow. Ikemefunaâs brutal death deeply distresses Nwoye who becomes afraid of his father.Â\n\nAt the end of Part One, Okonkwo accidentally kills a clansman at a funeral after his faulty gun explodes and is exiled to his motherland, Mbanta. During his exile, British missionaries arrive in Mbanta and establish a church. Nwoye, disillusioned with his own culture and Gods after Ikemefunaâs death, is attracted to Christianity and is an early convert. This is a heartbreaking disappointment to Okonkwo. When Okonkwo and his family return from exile after seven years they find that the missionaries and colonial governors have established Umuofia as the center of their new colonial government. Clashes of culture and morality occur, and as the British make the Igbo more dependent on them through introducing trade and formal education, the Igbo way of life is continually undermined. When a Christian convert unmasks an egwugwu during a tribal ritual, a sin amounting to the death of an ancestral spirit, the egwugwu burn down the village church. The men who destroyed the church are arrested and humiliated by the District Commissioner, and Okonkwo beheads a court messenger at a village council in rebellion. When none of his clansmen rise with him against the British, Okonkwo realizes his culture and way of life is lost and commits suicide in despair. Suicide is a crime against the Earth Goddess, Ani, so Okonkwo is left to rot above ground in the Evil Forest, like his father Unoka â a shameful fate he spent his life desperate to avoid. The final paragraph, written from the perspective of the District Commissioner, reduces Okonkwoâs life to a single sentence about his death in his planned book The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of The Lower Niger. Achebe has filled an entire novel with evidence of the complexity and sophistication of Okonkwoâs individual and social life and the District Commissionerâs casual dismissal and belittling of him causes us to flinch with horror and dismay. This is a metaphor for the reduction of Igbo culture in the eyes of its colonizers.Â\n\nThe title gives away the plot of the novel and anticipates the collapse of Okonkwo and his society. Things Fall Apart is about the connection between the tragic downfall of Okonkwo, who fate and temperamental weakness combine to destroy, and the destruction of his culture and society as the Igbo way of life is assailed by forces they do not understand and are unprepared to face.Â\n\nThemes\n\nA Full and Fair Representation of Ibo Traditional Life\n\nThe first part of the novel presents the traditional world of the Ibo with specificity and vibrancy. The imbedded descriptions of the patterns of interaction, daily routines and seasonal rituals of Ibo life creates an overwhelming impression of community and shared culture. We see the established system of values which regulates collective life and how closely related this is to natural cycles and environments. The Iboâs moral values are contained in sayings and stories, rituals and festivals. Achebe depicts a comprehensive and sustaining social, spiritual, economic, agricultural, and legal order. (Chapters to consider: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 19)\n\nWhile Ibo society is marked by the internal coherence of its organization and the poetry of its rituals, this coherence is partially formed by the repression of the individual and the inflexibility of social norms. Achebe shows the violence, dehumanization, and discrimination vulnerable groups experience in Umuofia due to the rigid adherence to tradition and superstition. This includes the customary abandonment of newborn twins, the sacrificial murder of Ikemefuna in the name of justice, and the discriminatory caste structure that denies inclusion to the osu (Chapters 7, 18).\n\nObierikaâs questioning of the stern logic of some customs suggests that many laws are enacted from a sense of duty and inevitability rather than from a firm conviction in their justice or efficacy (Chapter 13). The cultural demand for conformity places a huge moral and psychological burden on individuals who must reckon with the sometimes heartless will of the gods. This internal tension is epitomized in the character of Okonkwo, discussed below.Â Â\n\nClash of Cultures\n\nWhen the Ibo are confronted with rival institutions a mirror is held up to their society. Fall Apart honestly considers and reflects on Ibo practices, customs, values, and beliefs. The novel is a frank articulation of the nature of the African past and its relevance to the present and future. Achebe wants to illuminate Ibo culture to dispense with lingering colonial prejudices, but he is not sentimental or nostalgic for the past. Instead he is shifting through it to identify the valuable aspects of Ibo culture to bring into the future and help define Nigeriaâs post-independence identity.\n\nAchebe recognises that the colonial encounter which led, swiftly and seemingly inevitably, to the disintegration of Ibo culture revealed its profound weaknesses. Achebe suggests that with the arrival and contrast against another culture, a cultural reckoning was inevitable for the Ibo. However, cultural reckoning and revaluation is not the same thing as destruction and erasure. The British colonialists were a hostile force seeking cultural domination. By pointing out some of the weaknesses of the Ibo tradition, Achebe in no way excuses or justifies colonial domination or diminishes the pain and tragedy of the cultural erasure that occurred.\n\nColonial Domination\n\nThe anti-colonial position and purpose of the novel is powerfully clear. Achebe depicts the process of colonial initial establishment and the resultant cultural suspension of Ibo society. The British colonizers believed in their inherent cultural superiority and arrived in Umuofia with the intention to âbring civilizationâ (p.151) to Africa. They wanted to achieve full control by supplanting Ibo religion and culture with their own.\n\nThe British arrived quietly and non-confrontationally with their religion and the clans allow them to stay, misinterpreting their silence as peaceability. An Ibo proverb warns that there is danger in silence and nothing to fear from someone who reveals their motivations (Chapter 15). Obierika recognizes how the white manâs strategy disguised their intentions and gave them the freedom to grow and fortify. He explains the political consequences for the clan, now divided by the new religion, they can no longer act as one (Chapter 20). Without strength in unity, the Ibo are vulnerable to further encroachment of British control in their other institutions.\n\nAs only a small number of Ibo initially converted to Christianity, the church was only able to establish itself firmly in the villages because of the Iboâs religious tolerance (Chapter 2, 22). Mr Brown learns about Ibo religion and his willful blindness to its complexity shows how the colonizers justified their colonial rule and imposition through labelling their subjects âprimitiveâ. Mr Brown understands that Christianity held no appeal for people well integrated in Ibo society, concluding that âa frontal attack on it would not succeedâ (p.132) and thus introduces education as a new method of cultural displacement and erasure. Additionally, trade also increased the Iboâs dependence on the introduced economy (Chapter 21).\n\nFrom the very first introduction of the colonizers we understand that violence and fear were tools of oppression and dominance, forcing the Ibo to submit and keeping them unresisting (Chapter 15, 20, 23). Not only do the British impose foreign rule on the Ibo and judge them by standards they do not recognize, the District Commissionerâs personal brand of âjusticeâ is corrupt and hypocritical. When the elders are arbitrarily and falsely imprisoned, he tells them that what they have done âmust not happen in the dominion of our queenâ (p.141), combining personal corruption with a state apparatus of paternalism, hegemony, and occupation (Chapter 20, 23).\n\nDogmatic zealot, Reverend Smith, encourages fanaticism in his converts, motivating them to insult and humiliate the clan (Chapter 22). Under Reverend Smithâs wrathful guidance, the colonial agenda becomes transparently aggressive. The grief and pathos of the Iboâs situation and collective trauma is displayed evocatively in the final episodes as Achebe depicts this painful moment of acute crisis (Chapter 22, 23, 24, 25).\n\nFate\n\nA recurring thematic question in Things Fall Apart is to what degree the collapse of the Ibo and the downfall of Okonkwo are due to their own internal weaknesses or the whims of a pernicious fate.Â\n\nThe Ibo understand fate to be in a dynamic and somewhat ambiguous relationship with personal agency. This is evident in their proverb âwhen a man says yes his chi says yes alsoâ (p.20) which acknowledges and privileges the role of an individualâs choices in shaping their destiny (Chapter 4). The saying âas a man danced so the drums were beaten for himâ (p.135) also relates this idea â fate is a response to oneâs behaviour. Okonkwo is warned that killing Ikemefuna, his surrogate son, is the âkind of action for which the goddess wipes out whole familiesâ (p.49).This demonstrates the clanâs belief that the goddessâs (or fateâs) punishments are not arbitrary but the result of individual action (Chapter 8).\n\nAlthough there is an element of chance in Okonkwoâs gun accidentally exploding and killing someone, his exile carries the suggestion of just comeuppance in its echo of the guns failure to shoot when purposely aimed at Ekwefi (Chapter 5, 13). Likewise, although the arrival of the Christians was unexpected and chanced, Nwoyeâs rejection of his father is traceable directly to Okonkwoâs choice to kill Ikemefuna (Chapter 7). The desertion of people injured by Ibo traditions is a blow to the clan that feels equally earned (Chapters 16, 17, 18).Â Â\n\nAfter his exile, Okonkwo believes his chi has turned against him (Chapter 14). He renunciates the wisdom of his elders by denying the active role he had in directing the course of events. His refusal to reflect on the connection between his actions and punishment reflect his fatal flaws: hubris and willful lack of self-knowledge. By refusing to self-analyze and self-correct, Okonkwo loses the opportunity of redemption. Comparably, the Ibo, despite believing in a relationship between action and fate, do not reflect on the cause of their kinsmenâs desertion to Christianity. Achebe provides numerous examples of the clanâs dogma and brutal traditions denying people such as Ikemefuna or twins control over their lives (Chapter 2, 7). It was the shortcomings of the Ibo social and religious order that made members susceptible to the attraction of a competing value system with a more articulated concept of individuality. The Iboâs cultural lack of self-apprehension meant they could not adjust their traditions to save themselves.\n\nHowever, just as Achebe shows how individuals in the clan are at the mercy of rigid overarching authority, he shows how the fateful forces of history constrain human agency. The Britishâs hostile intention to erase and supplant the Ibo way of life is a punishment greater than the Ibo deserve and a force stronger than they can rise to. In his description of the grief and trauma of colonial imposition, Achebe demonstrates his compassion and sorrow for the Ibo as they faced the sweeping and unforgiving forces of change in their moment of historical crisis.Â\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. \"Things Fall Apart demonstrates how the values and customs of a society help us to deal with the familiar but not with change.\" Discuss.\n\n2. \"Traditional ideas of honour dominate Okonkwo's life and finally they destroy him.\" Discuss.\n\n3. \"Nwoye knew that it was right to be masculine and to be violent, but somehow he still preferred the stories his mother used to tell.\" How does Achebe explore masculinity in Things Fall Apart?\n\nâ\n\nNow it's your turn!

Discuss.\n\nWhenever you are breaking a prompt down. Ask yourself...\n\nWhat are the key words/ ideas that you need to address?\n\nWhich theme is the prompt referring to?\n\nDo you agree with prompt? Or do you disagree with it?\n\nThe keywords of this prompt would be women, suffer,, victimised and men. The prompt requires us to address the role of women in the text and the ways in which they suffer in a society that is pervaded by patriarchal values. It also asks us, âWho is to blame?â Are men solely responsible for the maltreatment or are there other causes to their suffering? The word âmostâ in this prompt is actually there to give us a bit of room for discussion. Yes, women do suffer, but do they suffer the most? Or do men suffer as well?\n\nNow that weâve thought about the prompt, we can move on to the second step of the THINK part of the THINK and EXECUTE technique.

One way to do this is to work out whether the paragraph agrees or disagrees with the prompt at hand. We could follow this structureâ¦\n\nâ\n\nYes, the prompt is true because X\n\nYes, another reason it is true is X\n\nWhile it is true, it is limited by X\n\nBy elucidating the ways in which women are seen as inferior to their male counterparts, the writer establishes his critique on a society that victimises and oppresses women.\n\nFrom the outset of the book, Okonkwo is characterised as a violent man who ârules his household with a heavy handâ, placing his wives in perpetual fear. The frequent beating and violence fortifies the portrayal of him as a man who is governed by his hatred of âgentility and idlenessâ, further showing the terror that his wives are forced to be living in.\n\n\"Do what you are told woman. When did you become one of the ndichie (meaning elders) of Umuofia?\"\n\nHe also sees his wifeâs mere act of questioning as disrespect, as evidenced through the ways in which he implies that she is overstepping her role.\n\nâThere were many women, but they looked on from the fringe like outsiders\"\n\nThis simile also shows how women are often marginalised and treated as outcasts, underlining the overarching yearning for social justice throughout the text. This pitiful image of women looking âon from the fringeâ also helps Achebe relay his criticism of gender double standards and the unfairness that Igbo women are forced to live with.\n\nAchebeâs sympathy for womenâs suffering and condemnation of menâs mistreatment towards are also evident through his depiction of a society that normalises misogyny.\n\nâHis mother and sisters worked hard enough, but they grew womenâs cropsâ¦ Yam, the king of crops, was a manâs cropsâ\n\nThe personification of the crops, in particular, the menâs crops, the âyamâ, being the âking of cropsâ establishes this gender hierarchy in yet another way. More specifically, the position of men in the social hierarchy is highlighted and the negative connotation attached to the âwomenâs cropsâ undermine their hard work, rendering it in significant.\n\nWhile women are the main victims of Igbo gendered prejudice, Achebe does not disregard the undue burden that societal expectations impose on men.\n\nâHe was afraid of being thought weak.â\n\nAchebe explores the burdens of unrealistic expectations that are placed on both men and women. This quote exemplifies societal expectations on men to be strong, powerful and fearless leaders who never show emotions. Achebeâs sympathies regarding these expectations show us that this is an important critique in Things Fall Apart that we can analyse.\n\nIf you find this helpful, then you might want to check out our Things Fall Apart: A Killer Text Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays (written by a 50 study scorer!) with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

Summary\n\nYear of Wonders is set in the small English village of Eyam in 1665, as the town struggles through a deadly outbreak of the bubonic plague. While the characters and events are fictional, author Geraldine Brooks based the novel on the true story of Eyam, whose inhabitants, at the urging of their vicar, courageously decided to quarantine themselves to restrict the spread of the contagion and protect other rural townships.Â\n\nThe experience of the plague provides Brooks fertile ground to develop characters that illustrate the extremes of human nature; displaying the dignity or depravity, self-sacrifice or self-interest that people are capable of when faced with terror, pain and the unknown. She explores the consequences of a catastrophe on an isolated, insular and deeply religious community and we see characters exhibit tireless dedication and heroism, or succumb to depression, exploitation and sometimes murderous depravity.Â\n\nThe novel illustrates that adversity can bring out the best and worst of people and that faith can be challenged and eroded. The novel explores how crises affect human behaviour, beliefs and values and reveal the real character of a community under pressure. Our job while studying this text is to consider how all the different responses to an external crisis contribute to an analysis of human nature.Â\n\n2. Historical Context\n\nYear of Wonders belongs to the genre of historical fiction (meaning it is fictional but based on historical events) and aims to capture and present the historical context accurately. The context of Year of Wonders is important to understand as it informs a lot of the division and instability in Eyam during the isolation and crisis of the plague (we explain in more detail why context is so important in Context and Authorial Intent in VCE English).Â\n\nIn 1658, only 7 years before the novel opens, Puritan statesmen Oliver Cromwell (who defeated King Charles I in the English Civil War and ruled as Lord Protector of the British Isles from 1653) died and Charles II, heir to the throne, returned from exile to rule England as King. Charles II replaced Cromwellâs rigid puritanism with the more relaxed Anglicanism and his reign began the dynamic period known as the Restoration. During the civil war and Cromwellâs rule, all the past certainties â the monarchy and the Church â had been repeatedly challenged and overturned. This all happened during the lifetime of the Eyam villagers presented in the novel and the recent religious upheaval in Britain was beginning to influence the conservative and puritan congregation of Eyam as the old puritan rector was replaced with Anglican vicar Michael Mompellion. The tension between the puritans and Anglicans is evident early in the novel and is exacerbated by the arrival of the plague, causing further internal fission.Â Â\n\nThe 17th century also marked the beginning of modern medicine and the Age of Enlightenment. During the Enlightenment, people began to privilege reason and sensory evidence from the material world over biblical orthodoxy as the primary sources of knowledge. The Enlightenment advanced ideals such as progress, liberty, tolerance, egalitarianism and the scientific method. These values are reflected in the liberal characters of Anna, Elinor, Mem and Anys Gowdie, and to an extent, Michael Mompellion. However, we also see the limited reaches of the Enlightenment in characters who succumb to superstition or self-flagellation when the plague arrives. This was a time when religious faith was frequently challenged and redefined.Â\n\n3. Character Analysis\n\nAnna Frith\n\nThe novel is narrated in the first person by protagonist Anna Frith. Anna, a young widow, mother and housemaid, becomes the townâs nurse and midwife during the plague alongside her employer and friend Elinor Mompellion. Anna is a compelling protagonist and narrator because she is part of the ordinary, working-class life of the village, but also has access to the gentry in her work for the Mompellions, meaning readers can see how the plague affected all social groups.Â\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Anna is in many ways very conventional. Aside from her intelligence and desire to learn, evidenced by her interest and quick proficiency in learning to read, Anna married young, is a dedicated mother, had an incomplete education and never thought to question the townâs orthodox religious beliefs. However, it is revealed early that she has progressive views on class and morality and as the novel progresses, the extraordinary circumstances of the plague evoke in her heroism and courage. Brooks notes, Anna 'shrugs off the social and religious mores that would keep a weaker woman in her place'. During the plague, Anna becomes the villageâs voice of reason and an indispensable figure due to her expanding medical knowledge, tenacity, resourcefulness and tireless generosity.Â\n\nMichael Mompellion\n\nMichael Mompellion is Eyamâs Anglican preacher, having been appointed three years earlier after Charles II returned to England and replaced Puritan clergies. Generally, Mompellion is altruistic and open-minded: softening strict class divisions, combatting superstition and embracing a scientific approach to the plague. When the plague arrives, the local gentry (the Bradfords) flee and due to his charisma and position in the Church, he becomes the townâs unofficial leader. Mompellion persuades the townspeople to go into self-imposed quarantine to prevent the spread of the plague. His personal charisma, powerful rhetoric and indefatigable dedication to his work mean he can motivate and inspire his parishioners.Â Â\n\nMompellionâs unwavering commitment to his beliefs makes him a good leader, but we also see that his single-minded religious zeal can lead to harsh irrationality and hypocrisy. While progressive on issues such as class divisions, Mompellion is conservative â bordering on fanatic â when it comes to female sexuality. When his beloved wife Elinor dies, it is revealed that Mompellion denied her sexual intimacy for their entire marriage to punish her for the premarital affair and abortion she had as a teenager. Mompellion realises upon Elinorâs death that he extended forgiveness and understanding to all but his wife and, recognising his own hypocrisy and cruelty, he suffers a breakdown and loses much of his religious faith. Through Annaâs eyes, we see Mompellion shift from a character of moral infallibility, to a flawed and inconsistent man of a more ambiguous character.Â\n\nElinor Mompellion\n\nElinor is Mompellionâs wife and Annaâs employer and teacher. By the end of the novel, Anna and Elinor are confidantes and friends and their friendship arguably forms one of the strongest emotional cores of the novel, sustaining both women through enormous strain and hardship. Elinor teaches Anna to read and seems not to notice or care about their different social strata, treating everyone equally. Elinor came from a very wealthy family and initially had little practical knowledge of the hardships and necessities of life. During the plague, she confronts pain, suffering and true sacrifice. Because of her beauty, fragility and generosity, the whole town â and especially Anna â view her as a paragon of virtue and the embodiment of innocence. However, Elinor reveals that as a teenager she had a premarital relationship that resulted in an illegitimate pregnancy which she ended through abortion. Elinor considers herself to be permanently marked by sin and is plagued by the guilt of her adolescent mistakes, but her commitment to atone through service and working to help others is admirable.Â\n\nAnys and Mem Gowdie\n\nAnys and her aunt Mem are the townâs healers and midwives. Both women live on the margins of society, as their knowledge of herbal medicines and power to heal certain ailments causes fear and suspicion. Additionally, Anys further alienates the villagers by having conspicuous affairs with married village men. Anna admires Anysâ herbal knowledge and healing skill and her autonomy and unashamed sexuality, which were rare for women at the time. When the plague breaks out, Anys and Mem are murdered by a mob of hysterical townspeople, who believe they are witches responsible for the plague. This episode shows the power and acute danger of superstition and hysteria.Â\n\nJosiah and Aphra Bont\n\nJosiah 'Joss' Bont is Annaâs estranged father and Aphra is Annaâs stepmother. Brooks depicts them as unsympathetic and unforgivable, if understandable, villains as they both seek to profit off the heavy misfortune of others. Joss abused Anna greatly throughout her childhood, and while she manages to forgive him due to the suffering of his own youth, when he cruelly exploits villagers in his position as gravedigger, Anna finds his actions irredeemable. As gravedigger, Joss charged exorbitant fees from desperate people to bury their dead, regularly stole from the beleaguered families and attempted to bury a wealthy plague sufferer alive to loot his home.Â\n\nAphra is similarly amoral and greedy. Although her love for her children is shown to be strong, she capitalises on the fear and superstition of her neighbours by selling fake charms while pretending to be Anys Gowdieâs ghost. After the death of her husband and children, Aphra becomes completely deranged, dismembering and refusing to bury the rotting corpses of her children and eventually murdering Elinor. Aphraâs fate and actions show how prolonged catastrophe and suffering can totally erode an individualâs sanity.Â\n\nThe Bradford Family\n\nThe Bradford family are arrogant and pretentious. When the plague arrived in Eyam they also proved themselves self-serving and opportunistic, exploiting their wealth and status as part of the gentry to flee Eyam instead of enduring the quarantine with the rest of the village. They provide a foil to the Mompellions, who are of similar status and are newcomers to Eyam with fewer historical ties and thus expectations of loyalty. The two upper-class families provide directly opposite responses to the crisis, with Brooks clearly condemning the cowardice and selfishness exhibited by the Bradfords.Â\n\n4. Themes\n\nSocial Convention and Human Nature in a Crisis\n\nPerhaps the most significant theme or exploration of the novel is what happens to an individualâs character and community norms in a crisis. Year of Wonders depicts a small and isolated community that experiences intense adversity from the plague and, because of their self-imposed quarantine, are additionally isolated from the stabilising forces of broader society. These factors cause the people of Eyam to increasingly abandon their social conventions and descend into chaos and Brooks raises the question of whether people can live harmoniously without a strong social code. She suggests that societal cohesion is the result of social pressure rather than innate to our nature. The social norms and protocols of Eyam collapse under the pressure of the plague, allo"
