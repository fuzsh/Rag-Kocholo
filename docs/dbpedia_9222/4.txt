What is the USNSTPA?

An association of the current and former members of the men’s United States National Soccer Team (USMNT).

When was the USNSTPA founded?

The Association was founded in 1996, taking a more public role with the launching of USSoccerPlayers.com shortly before the 2002 World Cup.

Is the USNSTPA a labor union?

Yes. The USNSTPA is the labor union for the members of the men’s National Team, the USMNT.

How does that work?

Under United States labor laws, the United States Soccer Federation (“USSF”) has recognized the USNSTPA as the organization that represents all members of the United States Men’s National Team. In that capacity, the USNSTPA engages in collective bargaining negotiations with the USSF about the compensation and working conditions of the members of the National Team. The players elect five players to serve as Player Representatives, to oversee the workings of the Players Association. The current Player Representatives are: Tyler Adams, Reggie Cannon, Cristian Roldan, Matt Turner, Walker Zimmerman, Yunus Musah (young player rep).

Are all US National Team players members?

The Association represents all players appearing for the men’s National Team, and those players are covered under the collective bargaining agreement and the uniform player agreement negotiated by the Players Association. All current National Team players are members of the USNSTPA and any individual who has appeared for the US National Team at any time in the past is welcome to become a member.

How are things like travel conditions and grievances handled?

Both of those items and other working conditions are negotiated through collective bargaining.

The USWNSTPA – a completely separate organization.

Who represents the Major League Soccer Players?

The Major League Soccer Players Association (MLSPA) based in Bethesda, MD.
