        "text": "Since 2019, HSS has been the Official Hospital of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). HSS ensures that both current and former NBA players have access to the world leader in musculoskeletal health. One of the NBPAâs founding partners in conjunction with the opening of its headquarters in Manhattan, HSS works diligently as a liaison with the unionâs Chief Medical Officer and provides medical oversight of the NBPAâs initiatives with retired players, current athletes and rising stars.\n\nHSS proudly supports the NBPAâs Off the Court program, which helps players transition after their professional basketball careers. HSS physicians supply educational materials and support to empower players in their physical health in retirement.\n\nHSS also provides medical oversight for The Throne, the NBPAâs single-elimination, bracket-style basketball tournament for high school players, as well as for The Basketball Tournament (TBT), the its 64-team, $1 million, winner-take-all event.\n\nHSS clinicians are also on-site at select NBPA youth clinics and events to conduct research and share educational opportunities targeted at reducing the risk of injury."
