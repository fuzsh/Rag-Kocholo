Our current focus is on funding efforts that provide evidence-based solutions to address priority issues around: the digital divide, education equity, youth justice, the school-to-prison pipeline, police accountability and transparency, mass incarceration, and generational poverty.\n\nWhile we do not accept unsolicited applications or requests for funding, Players Coalition is open to learning more about programs and organizations that may fit within our areas of focus. Upon careful review of our objectives and priorities, we welcome a letter of inquiry via our website Contact page. Note: requests will only receive a reply if Players Coalition is able to currently consider the opportunity."
