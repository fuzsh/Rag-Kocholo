The aim is to protect & promote their welfare in addition to growing the game in the US. The best \"Unions\" around the world are supported by vibrant & engaged player associations. Fundamentally, player associations are for & consist of current athletes. But the impact they can achieve offers something greater - helping our sport be the best it can be. The partnership between USA Rugby & the Players is one based on good faith & shared purpose. The USRPA will seek to abide by it''s motto of \"Grow the Player, Grow the Game.\" As an incorporated 501(c)(5) organization with tax exemption, the objective of the USRPA is to be a self-funded & model non-profit business. This is necessary in order to provide value to the USRPA membership, our athletes. The revenue generated will support USRPA functions such as employees & fundraising campaigns, as well as building support to fulfill the association's primary responsibility - providing service & value to the Players. As an organization by and for the Players, the Board of Player Representatives will have the ultimate decision making power on how the organization will be structured, led and governed. Two athletes from each team will be elected to form the USRPA Board of Player Representatives. The Board of Player Reps will be responsible for much of the decision making of the USRPA. The Board of Player Reps, along with the Chairperson, will confirm the Leadership & Management Team. The Leadership Team will work with, report to and in concert with the Board of Players, The Leadership team will be empowered with the responsibilities of operating & growing the organization.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://usarugbyplayers.org\n\nExternal link for United States Rugby Players Association\n\nIndustry\n\nSpectator Sports\n\nCompany size\n\n1 employee\n\nHeadquarters\n\nEvanston, IL\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n2016"
