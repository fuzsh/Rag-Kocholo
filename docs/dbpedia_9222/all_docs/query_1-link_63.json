        "text": "US-based commercial rights agency OneTeam Partners has launched an international business with one of its founders, the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA).\n\nConfirmed:\n\nOneTeam International will look to expand existing verticals globally and open up new opportunities for athletes\n\nBusiness will work with player associations of all sizes across women’s and men’s sports to ‘protect and maximise the value of athlete name, image and likeness (NIL) rights.’\n\nVenture will also develop sponsorship, partnership, data rights and content opportunities\n\nJonas Baer-Hoffmann (pictured) will head up OneTeam International\n\nContext:\n\nOneTeam was founded in 2019 as a joint venture between the MLBPA, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) and RedBird Capital Partners, with the latter selling its stake in 2022.\n\nIt currently represents the commercial interests of more than 20,000 athletes across various sports, including those from the National Women’s Soccer League Players Association (NWSLPA), the NFLPA and MLBPA.\n\nBaer-Hoffmann, who will be based in Germany, most recently worked as the general secretary of Fifpro, the global soccer players’ union, which represents over 65,000 professionals in more than 70 countries. He has also previously served as first vice-president of the World Players Association, which advocated on behalf of 85,000 athletes.\n\nComment:\n\n“We are excited to open this next chapter for OneTeam, marking a huge milestone to deliver on our mission to empower athletes not just here in the United States but around the world,” said Sean Sansiveri, OneTeam Partners chief executive.\n\n“Our founding partners have always intended to support and impact our sister and brother Player unions worldwide. There is tremendous upside for our future partners and their athletes on this path, not only in traditional business but through bespoke strategies we will launch in both women’s and men’s sports.\n\n“We are thrilled to have Jonas on board. His extensive experience will be instrumental in providing athletes worldwide with new opportunities to generate revenue and access previously untapped opportunities.”\n\nComing next:\n\nSansiveri told Bloomberg last year that the agency is aiming for a long-term valuation of US$10 billion. It was valued at US$1.9 billion in 2022 when RedBird sold its stake in the company."
