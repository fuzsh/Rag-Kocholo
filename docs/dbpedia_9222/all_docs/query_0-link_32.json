        "text": "Partnership with President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition is among new commitments under the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a new partnership with major sports leagues and players associations to boost physical activity and increase nutrition programming across the country.\n\nFourteen sports leagues and players associations have signed agreements with the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition to expand access to physical activity, integrate messaging and education around nutrition, and promote healthy lifestyles to the millions of people who engage in their programs every year.\n\nIn 2022, President Biden hosted the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, the first in more than 50 years. The President also announced a National Strategy to meet an ambitious goal to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030 – all while closing disparities among the communities that are impacted most.\n\nTowards that goal, last year the Biden-Harris Administration launched the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities as a nationwide call-to-action to stakeholders across all of society to make bold commitments. The historic partnership announced today is one of the new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge. Additional new commitments will be announced later this month.\n\nThe President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, & Nutrition is a federal advisory committee that aims to promote healthy, accessible eating and physical activity for all Americans, regardless of background or ability. In 2022, President Biden appointed chef José Andrés and basketball player Elena Delle Donne to serve as Co-Chairs of the President’s Council followed by a full slate of Council Members in 2023.\n\nThe following sports leagues and players associations are announcing new commitments today:\n\nNational Football League (NFL): The NFL will build on PLAY60, the NFL’s national youth health and wellness platform, empowering millions of youth to get physically active for at least 60 minutes a day, and integrate the importance of nutrition into its messaging for these programs.\n\nNational Hockey League (NHL): The NHL is committed to expanding access and opportunity for children and families to experience hockey in all forms through financial investments in communities, national advocacy, and strategic programming including NHL/NHLPA Learn to Play, NHL STREET, and the Hockey is for Everyone Coalition.\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB): MLB will bolster its PLAY BALL initiative, a global effort to encourage young people and communities to engage in baseball and softball, with nutrition education and messaging for children. MLB initiated this effort during its World Series PLAY BALL event in October 2023, with PLAY BALL coaches speaking to the participating kids about healthy eating and good nutrition. MLB will continue to share this message in partnership with the President’s Council during future PLAY BALL events.\n\nNational Basketball Association (NBA) & Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA): The NBA and WNBA will continue developing programming and events that promote physical activity to all young people and taking action to combat food insecurity – building upon activities at the All-Star Game in Indianapolis this month.\n\nMajor League Soccer (MLS): MLS is committed to supporting nutrition security and helping to build healthy communities. In 2024, the League will provide over 2.5 million meals to local communities through MLS stadium food recovery programs and tentpole League events.\n\nPGA Tour: The PGA Tour will promote the physical and nutrition benefits of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans with charitable beneficiaries in its host communities who share a commitment to health and wellness.\n\nNational Women’s Soccer League (NWSL): The NWSL will leverage its 15 teams with players from across the globe to promote healthy eating, physical activity, nutrition messaging through their community events.\n\nMajor League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA): The MLBPA in partnership with its charitable arm, the Players Trust will build on its work with players in coaching and mentoring the next generation on the importance of developing lifelong healthy habits and behaviors that contribute to their positive physical, social, emotional, and mental wellbeing.\n\nNational Women’s Soccer League Players Association (NWSLPA): NWSLPA will work with players and other teams to raise awareness among young people about the importance of healthy eating and physical activity.\n\nNational Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA): NHLPA will add nutrition education and messaging to community initiatives and amplify federal resources such as Move Your Way. The NHLPA’s Goals & Dreams program, which helps children play the sport of hockey by donating equipment to community-based programs, will conduct several events this year with various community partners.\n\nMajor League Soccer Players Association (MLSPA): MLSPA will build on existing community programming to spotlight nutrition as a facet of performing well on the field and continue to elevate the importance of healthy eating.\n\nUnited Soccer League Players Association (USLPA): USLPA will partner with the President’s Council to continue promoting nutrition through its initiatives and programming.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden."
