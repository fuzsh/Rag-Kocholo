        "text": "SEE ALSO: Charter School and Supermarket Ink Deals at Arden Group’s 4650 Broadway\n\nWith ceilings reaching up to 24 feet on parts of the fifth floor, the players association is installing a basketball court in what was formerly a sound stage for RCA Coporation.\n\n“We are delighted the National Basketball Players Association has chosen The Durst Organization’s 1133 Avenue of the Americas as its new national headquarters,” said Jody Durst, the president of the Durst Organization, in prepared remarks. “We are particularly pleased that the NBPA was able to transform the old RCA sound stage into a regulation-sized basketball court. We look forward to a lasting partnership with this exciting new tenant.”\n\nThe asking rent was in the mid-$70s per square foot, according to The New York Post, which first reported news of the lease.\n\nDurst in June renewed Bank of America‘s 115,000-square-foot lease at the 1.1-million-square-foot building for another 10 years. The landlord is also marketing roughly 300,000 square feet on lower floors of the building, which have been renovated following the Internal Revenue Service’s departure last year.\n\nTom Bow and Rocco Romeo of Durst represented the landlord in-house, while Arthur Mirante II and Martin Cottingham of Avison Young represented the NBA player’s union. An Avison Young spokesman did not immediately return Commercial Observer’s requests for comment."
