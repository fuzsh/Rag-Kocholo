At the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) Performance Summit, CLF's Deborah Embaie, MPA led a conversation with Jonathan Swerdlin, cofounder & CEO of Function Health, and Julia Klim, VP at Equinox, about how they are making this technology more accessible for everyday athletes and how it can help improve performance and longevity. Thanks National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) and Leaders in Sport for having us participate in this important conversation about the future of health!\n\nThe challenge of managing player workload is a common issue across sport. Just a day after #FIFPRO Europe and European Leagues announced their formal complaint to the European Commission against FIFA regarding the international match calendar, panels at the NBPA Performance Summit highlighted the critical role of player unions in safeguarding athletes. #FIFPRO’s Alexander Bielefeld represented the footballers’ perspective on the panel “Workload issues across sports: What are we doing to protect players?” alongside Wajid Mir from the Professional Tennis Players Association and Bostjan Nachbar from the EuroLeague Players Association (ELPA) (basketball). Moderated by Stephania Bell from ESPN, the group explored the unique challenges of their respective sports, while also identifying common ground and shared solutions. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), which protects and supports the rights of the 450 best basketball players in the world, hosted the two-day event in Spain, exploring the latest developments in sports performance and technology. The event was hosted by the NBPA's Matteo Zuretti and Dan O'Brien. Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dFFY6JGz"
