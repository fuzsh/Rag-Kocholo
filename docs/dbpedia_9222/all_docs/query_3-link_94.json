The stated goal of the FNPPA is to provide professional Fortnite players with a unified front in conversations surrounding the game, including conversations with developer Epic Games.\n\nThe 16 founding members of the association include representatives from NRG Esports, 100 Thieves, FaZe Clan, Team SoloMid, Team Liquid, Counter Logic Gaming, and Lazarus Esports. Also joining as founding members are Sentinels’ Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf, the recent winner of the Fortnite World Cup Solo competition, and David “Aqua” Wang, half of the team that won the Duo competition playing for Cooler Esports.\n\nThe FNPPA will be extending membership invitations to more players in the coming weeks.\n\nThe formation of the FNPPA follows the establishment of the Counter-Strike Professional Players’ Association in June of last year. The CSPPA is focused primarily on providing legal assistance to professional players and guiding them through contract negotiations. The CSPPA has approximately 90 members.\n\nProfessional League of Legends players are eligible for membership in the North American League Championship Series Players’ Association. The NALCS Players’ Association is not an independent body, however— it is operated by League developer and publisher Riot Games."
