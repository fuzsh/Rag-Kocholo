Zoomph’s social media data and valuation tools will support the organizations in generating new off-court commercial opportunities for professional women’s and men’s tennis players worldwide.\n\nWith Zoomph, Winners Alliance will track and monitor social media data for hundreds of WTA and ATP players.
