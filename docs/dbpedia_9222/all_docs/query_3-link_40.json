        "text": "Maybe they’re saving up for the much-rumored impending lockout in 2017. The National Basketball Players Association is selling its Harlem headquarters building at 310 Lenox Avenue, between West 125th and 126th streets.\n\nThe NBA’s official players’ union will vacate 11,000 square feet at the 25,000-square-foot building, which is under contract to be sold to an unnamed investor and also is home to the Red Rooster Restaurant.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nInstead, the NBPA is set for a move to spacious new digs at the Durst Organization’s 1133 Sixth Avenue in Midtown, where it will take 47,000 square feet in a 21-plus-year lease, according to the New York Post. Asking rent was in the mid-$70s per square foot.\n\nThe NBPA’s new offices include a double-height fifth floor – for the 7-footers in the building – that will house a training facility including a basketball court. Executive offices will occupy part of 1133 Sixth Avenue’s sixth floor."
