        "text": "The eligibility requirements, circumstances under which benefits may be terminated, and the nature of the benefits will be set forth in summaries that will be distributed by the WNBA to each player signed to a Contract and to the Players Association.\n\nThe Players Association waives any right to participate in the design, implementation, and administration of the plans and programs, including the selection from time to time of new insurance carriers and the investment options to be available under the Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan.\n\nNeither the WNBA nor any Team shall be liable for any salary, bonus, or other monetary claims that result, directly or indirectly, from a player being suspended pursuant to the terms of Section 3 above, and the Players Association agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the WNBA and all Teams for any such claims which may be made against the WNBA and/or any Team.\n\nIf there is no resolution of the matter within seven (7) days, the Team will, upon the written request of the Players Association, suspend the player without pay, wherever legal.\n\nThe Team will forward the check-off monies to the Players Association within fourteen (14) days of each check-off, and if the Team fails to do so, interest at 5% per annum, payable to the Players Association, shall begin to accrue on such check-off monies upon the conclusion of such 14-day period.\n\nSuch suspension will continue until the Players Association has notified the Team in writing that the suspended player has satisfied her obligation as set forth in Section 1 of this Article.\n\nThe allocation of such sum among the programs, and the type and content of, and participants in, such programs, shall be determined each year in consultation with the Players Association.\n\nFollowing its receipt of such notice, the WNBA shall provide the same notice to the Players Association as soon as practicable.\n\nThe Players Association warrants that it is duly empowered to enter into this Agreement for and on behalf of such persons.\n\nThe WNBA and the Players Association agree that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such persons and the WNBA and/or WNBA Teams may, on an individual basis, bargain with respect to and agree upon the provisions of Player Contracts and Marketing and Promotional Agreements, but only as and to the extent permitted by this Agreement."
