After the 2018 NFC Divisional game versus the Minnesota Vikings, when Morstead returned to the field in the final seconds following what appeared to be a walk-off Saints loss, Vikings fans donated more the $140,000 to his foundation. Morstead, in turn, decided to donate all the contributions to the Children's Hospital in Minnesota.\n\nMichael Thomas | Vice President\n\nThe Stanford graduate is one of the NFLPA’s most active players both on and off the field. After playing one season with San Francisco as an undrafted free agent in 2012, Thomas spent the next five seasons as a free safety and special teams standout for the Miami Dolphins. In March 2018, Thomas signed a contract with the New York Giants and was named to his first Pro Bowl that same season.
