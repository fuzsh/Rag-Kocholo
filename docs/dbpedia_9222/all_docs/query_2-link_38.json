When do i get tye cap room from releasing him? Or do i pay it until the end of the season, your help would be great\n\nThanks\n\nPro\n\nOVR: 11\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2010\n\nRe: Releasing Players in Association Mode\n\nJust like in real life, the contract still will count towards your total salary cap if you just release a player and no other team picks him up. If the contract is multiple years, you have to continue to pay him until he signs with another team or his contract his up. I recommend just trading the player or players you are thinking about releasing for a second-round pick. It's what I do when I'm trying to get rid of a player. Hope this helps."
