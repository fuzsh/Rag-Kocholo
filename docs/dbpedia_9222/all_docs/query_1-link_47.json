        "text": "The 8-week program will consist of 40 hours of virtual learning and skills development per week and will begin on April 22, which coincides with the 89th annual NFL Draft, and conclude on June 14. The Microsoft Leap NFL Legends Cohort will participate in immersive training covering a range of topics and a real-life skilling segment working on high-value projects. This learning experience will provide a unique opportunity for NFL Legends to leverage their transferable skills, such as analytical ability, leadership, communication, problem-solving, and teamwork, to transition to a career in technology as technical program managers.\n\n\"I am thrilled to announce Atrium’s continued support of the NFL Player Care Foundation through the Microsoft Leap NFL Legends Cohort. For the past four years, we have been working closely with the NFL PCF to provide extensive career consulting and coaching services to NFL Legends,” said Joanna Chavers, Executive Director of Talent Strategy at Atrium. “This initiative represents a significant milestone in our commitment to promoting the growth and development of NFL Legends. It has been an incredible journey so far, and we are so grateful to work with such amazing Legends as they harness their transferrable skills from professional football and translate them into their next endeavor.”\n\n\"Microsoft Leap accelerates job-readiness for careers in technology,” shared David Campbell, Director, Microsoft Leap. “With 98% of Microsoft Leap graduates employed in tech careers today, we look forward to the impact this first cohort of NFL Legends will make, and are committed to helping them take their careers to new heights through our technical program manager training,”\n\nInterested Legends may apply online in the NFL PCF Career Portal or at the 6th Annual Super Bowl Career Fair in Las Vegas on February 9.\n\nFor more information about the NFL Player Care Foundation, please visit http://nflplayercare.com/\n\nAbout NFL Player Care Foundation (PCF)\n\nThe NFL Player Care Foundation (PCF) is an independent organization dedicated to helping retired players improve their quality of life.
