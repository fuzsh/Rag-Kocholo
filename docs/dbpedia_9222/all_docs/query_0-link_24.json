        "text": "On baseball\n\n​\n\nI grew up in New York, out on Long Island, so I've always been a Mets fan. My earliest baseball memory was when I was 8-9 years old when the “Miracle Mets” won the World Series in 1969. Every year my father would take me to Shea Stadium to catch a game on my birthday in June. The seats weren't anything special, but it was still a great time. I was a big Tom Seaver fan, so I've been watching baseball ever since then. Even through the rough years and then when they rose up again with Doc Gooden, Darryl Strawberry and all those guys, I've always been a baseball fan. I lived literally across the street from Fenway Park when I was at Boston University and back then it was easier to get tickets so I used to go to a lot of games.\n\nOn his hobbies\n\nIn my spare time, I love playing guitar. I've been playing since I was 8 years old and I still play in bands. I'm also a big reader, mostly history.\n\n​\n\nOn his sports labor background\n\n​\n\nI started at Weil, Gotshal & Manges right out of law school. My first sports case, was in 1985 as a summer associate. It was actually for the Major League Baseball Players Association, involving T.V. rights with the Baltimore Orioles and was called Rogers vs. Kuhn. I started full time in 1986 as a litigator and then eventually made my way to becoming a trial lawyer. While there I was doing a lot of large, financial, corporate cases, plus intellectual property, and things of that type, but the sports cases were always my favorite. (Sports lawyer) Jim Quinn—who was a part of my firm and had been doing sports related cases since the 1970s—recruited me to get involved in a big case we were doing for the basketball players called Bridgeman v. NBA. From there I became quite involved with basketball and the NBPA, doing arbitrations and negotiations, among other things. Shortly after that we were retained by the NFLPA and I worked with them for years, then the NHLPA as well. I'd have to say the most rewarding litigation victory in which I was involved was when we won the trial in Minnesota for the football players in the early 90's, striking down the NFL's free agency restrictions under the antitrust laws. That was McNeil v. NFL. But over the years I was able to do a considerable amount of arbitration and collective bargaining for the NFLPA, NBPA and the NHLPA.\n\n​\n\nOn the allure of the MLBPA\n\n​\n\nThe MLBPA has always been considered a sort of gold standard for sports unions, if not all unions, in the United States, and to have the opportunity not only to return to New York, but to work with a great team led by Tony Clark is exciting. I look forward to getting up to speed on the dynamics of the industry along with getting to know and work with the Players Association team, the Players and their agents. I'm looking forward to helping find ways to make things better than they already are for the players.\n\n​\n\nOn how we would describe himself professionally\n\n​"
