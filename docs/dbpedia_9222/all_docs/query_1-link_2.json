        "text": "Why do players need a union and what does it actually do?\n\nWhat is the NFLPA?\n\nThe National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) is the union for professional football players in the National Football League.\n\nWhy do professional football players need a union?\n\nThe union allows players to stand together to protect their health, rights, and families.\n\nThe union was formed in 1956. Players used their combined strength to force owners to provide basics like clean uniforms and safer equipment.\n\nOur job is to represent players’ interests during negotiations for the next CBA and to make sure players are well informed and prepared for them.\n\nIn 2011, we negotiated a landmark Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) after an 18-week lockout by the owners.\n\nIn March 2020, we negotiated the current CBA, which runs through the 2030 season.\n\nThe current CBA brought new gains to our members, including an increased share in revenue, expanded roster sizes, a sizable bump in minimum salaries, health & safety advances, rookie contract bonuses, and more.\n\nWhat does the union do?\n\nThe NFLPA:\n\nRepresents all players in matters concerning wages, hours and working conditions and protects their rights as professional football players\n\nMakes sure that the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) are met\n\nNegotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits\n\nProvides other member services and activities\n\nProvides assistance to charitable and community organizations\n\nEnhances and defends the image of players and their profession on and off the field\n\nHow does the union work?\n\nThe NFLPA works from the bottom-up. All power and authority to do anything in the NFLPA comes from the Board of Reps who are elected by the player members.\n\nPlayer Members on each NFL team elect both a Player Representative and three Co-Alternate Player Representatives to serve on the Board of Player Representatives (The Board of Player Reps).\n\nThe Board of Player Reps meets at least once a year and makes all of the important decisions for the organization.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nExplore Our History of Wins to learn how we’ve been fighting for player rights since 1956.\n\nBrowse Player Marketing Solutions to find out how we’re protecting group licensing rights and generating income for every NFL player through our marketing and licensing arm Players, Inc."
