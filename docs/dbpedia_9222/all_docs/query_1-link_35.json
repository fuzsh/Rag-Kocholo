The USNSTPA is the labor union for the members of the men’s National Team, the USMNT.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nUnder United States labor laws, the United States Soccer Federation (“USSF”) has recognized the USNSTPA as the organization that represents all members of the United States Men’s National Team. In that capacity, the USNSTPA engages in collective bargaining negotiations with the USSF about the compensation and working conditions of the members of the National Team. The players elect five players to serve as Player Representatives, to oversee the workings of the Players Association. The current Player Representatives are: Tyler Adams, Reggie Cannon, Cristian Roldan, Matt Turner, Walker Zimmerman, Yunus Musah (young player rep).\n\nAre all US National Team players members?\n\nThe Association represents all players appearing for the men’s National Team, and those players are covered under the collective bargaining agreement and the uniform player agreement negotiated by the Players Association. All current National Team players are members of the USNSTPA and any individual who has appeared for the US National Team at any time in the past is welcome to become a member.\n\nHow are things like travel conditions and grievances handled?\n\nBoth of those items and other working conditions are negotiated through collective bargaining.\n\nWho represents the women players?\n\nThe USWNSTPA – a completely separate organization.\n\nWho represents the Major League Soccer Players?\n\nThe Major League Soccer Players Association (MLSPA) based in Bethesda, MD.\n\nWhere is the USNSTPA based?\n\nWashington D.C.\n\nOur mailing address is:\n\nUS National Soccer Team Players Association\n\nAttn: Mark Levinstein, Williams & Connolly LLP\n\n680 Maine Ave SW\n\nWashington D.C., 20024\n\nWhen does the current Collective Bargaining Agreement between the USNSTPA and the USSF expire?\n\nDec. 31st, 2028.\n\nWhat is the relationship between USSoccerPlayers.com and the USNSTPA?\n\nUSSoccerPlayers.com is a website that has been created and maintained by the US National Team players to provide soccer-specific news as well as information and entertainment for the United States soccer community, including in-depth resource information for soccer players, parents, coaches, and fans, and information about the US National Soccer Team, US National Soccer Team players, and charitable and other activities of the USNSTPA.\n\nWill the USNSTPA support my project/program/group?\n\nPlease use editor@usnstpa.com to send us your proposal.\n\nContact Information\n\nBy email: editor@usnstpa.com\n\nOur mailing address is:\n\nUS National Soccer Team Players Association\n\nAttn: Mark Levinstein, Williams & Connolly LLP\n\n680 Maine Ave SW\n\nWashington, DC 20024\n\n© US National Soccer Team Players Association 1996-2024.
