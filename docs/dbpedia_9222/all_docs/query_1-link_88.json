        "text": "What Does the MLBPA Do?\n\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association provides many different services, including, but not limited to:\n\nNegotiating the terms of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between Major League Baseball and players;\n\nAssisting players with grievances and salary arbitration;\n\nEnsuring and providing security and safety for Major League players;\n\nMonitoring and negotiating retirement and insurance benefits;\n\nCertifying, regulating, and educating player agents; and\n\nServing as the group licensing agent for its players.\n\nWhat Is Group Licensing?\n\nIf a company uses the likeness of the names of more than two Major League baseball players for a commercial use, then it must sign a licensing agreement with the MLBPA. This license grants the company the use of the player’s names or likenesses but not to any MLB team logos or marks.\n\nEach of the players will receive a pro-rata share of licensing revenue regardless of the player’s status or popularity. Their share is determined by how many dates the player served in Major League Baseball.\n\nHow Much Are Union Dues?\n\nUnion dues for the Major League Baseball Players Association are $40 per day during the season. The season is a total of 183 days.\n\nWhat Is a Labor Union?\n\nA labor union is a group of workers that come together to negotiate on an equal basis with their management. Employers are likely more inclined to listen to issues of employees who are members of labor organizations because of their collective voice.\n\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association is an example of a labor union. The MLBPA union represents baseball players who are employed by Major League Baseball teams.\n\nAlthough every player has the right to discuss contract details with their clubs, the MLBPA bargains with MLB to create collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). CBAs include many issues, such as:\n\nThe minimum wage the player can be paid;\n\nThe schedule for the season;\n\nThe terms of free agency.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) is the law that provides protections to labor unions. It protects the rights of players or workers to have union representation.\n\nIt also prohibits employers from interfering with the decision of an employee to join a union.\n\nWhat Is a Sports Lawyer?\n\nA sports lawyer is a qualified legal professional who represents many parties, including:\n\nAthletes;\n\nIndustry boards;\n\nTeams;\n\nLeagues;\n\nOther sports organizations.\n\nA sports lawyer may also be referred to as a sports law attorney. These professionals handle various issues that may fall under a variety of practice areas. Sports lawyers commonly work at:\n\nUniversities and educational institutions;\n\nAssociations of amateur athletes;\n\nAssociations of professional athletes;\n\nSolo legal practices;\n\nLarge law companies or entertainment law firms;\n\nOffices that are virtual or shared.\n\nSports attorneys work in a variety of professions and handle many different issues. They work to preserve the legal rights and interests of individuals.\n\nIf an individual is a professional athlete, sports agent, team owner, or is otherwise involved in the sports industry, an individual may require the services of a sports lawyer at some point. Common situations in which an individual may need a sports attorney include, but are not limited to:\n\nContract negotiations: If an individual is a professional athlete or a sports agent, they may need a sports lawyer to help an individual negotiate and review contracts with teams, sponsors, or other parties;\n\nA sports lawyer can help an individual understand the terms of their contract, protect their interests, and ensure that they are getting a fair deal;\n\nDispute resolution: If an individual is involved in a dispute related to sports, such as a breach of contract, a licensing issue, or an intellectual property dispute, they may need a sports lawyer to represent an individual during:\n\nnegotiations;\n\nmediation;\n\nlitigation;\n\nRegulatory compliance: If an individual is a team owner, a league executive, or involved in any other aspect of sports management, they may need a sports lawyer to help them navigate the complex regulations that govern the sports industry;\n\nA sports lawyer can help an individual understand the rules and regulations that apply to their situation and ensure that they are in compliance with those rules; and\n\nPersonal injury: If an individual has suffered a personal injury as a result of participating in a sporting event, they may need a sports lawyer to help them recover damages from the responsible party;\n\nA sports lawyer can help an individual file a claim, negotiate a settlement, or take their case to court.\n\nHaving a sports lawyer will help an individual ensure they do not make any legal errors. Their lawyer can help them manage their career, team, or organization.\n\nIn the U.S., attorneys are required to do numerous things to practice sports law, including:\n\nComplete three years of law school;\n\nPass a bar exam;\n\nPass a moral character and background check;\n\nPass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE);\n\nObtain continuing legal education credits (MCLE) each year; and\n\nMaintain malpractice insurance.\n\nSports lawyers handle the legal aspects of sports, which may include:\n\nContracts;\n\nIntellectual property;\n\nNegotiations;\n\nLitigation;\n\nOther issues.\n\nAttorneys must adhere to high ethical and professional standards. Breaking these obligations or rules may result in their disbarment or other penalties.\n\nWhat Is a Sports Agent?\n\nSports agents, in contrast, represent an athlete’s career. A sports agent is not required to have a formal degree.\n\nThey are, however, required to:\n\nBe registered with the college or state where they want to represent and recruit professional athletes;\n\nBe registered with the players association in team sports, specifically the MLBPA, NBPA, NHLPA, MLSPA, and NFLPA.\n\nEvery player association has its own set of rules that apply to sports agents. There are some organizations, such as the NFLPA, that require agents to have a master’s degree, while others require agents to pass a collective bargaining agreement exam.\n\nTypically, sports agents are required to pay a fee and apply for certification with an association and annual dues. There may also be other standards.\n\nIf a potential agent has any questions, they can visit the union website of the sport in which the potential agent wants to specialize. In order to negotiate contracts, any individual, including an attorney, is required to register with the players association and become a certified agent.\n\nDo I Need a Lawyer?\n\nIf you have any issues, questions, or concerns related to Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players Association, it is important to consult with an entertainment lawyer. ​​If you have a dispute with the MLB or MLBPA, your lawyer can help.\n\nIt is always best to consult with a lawyer before signing any type of contract or agreement. If you are a player, your lawyer can represent you during any negotiations and help ensure that your rights are protected.\n\nIf you are a team owner or other party who makes contracts with players, it is essential to have a lawyer review any contract a player is going to sign to ensure your rights are protected, and the contract is valid. If a player or team has any disputes that arise out of a contract, their lawyer can help resolve those issues either through negotiations or in court."
