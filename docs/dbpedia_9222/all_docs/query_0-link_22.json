        "text": "One of our core jobs as a union is to improve the overall working conditions for our players, which includes the daily experience of players at the team facilities away from the lights and cameras.\n\n1,706 of our players provided information to share with one another about their current club, to not only help them make important career decisions, but also help raise standards across the league.\n\nOur goals were to highlight positive clubs, identify areas that could use improvement, and highlight best practices and standards. To learn more about the background of this initiative, read a note from President JC Tretter here.\n\nTo see each team's individual report card, click their team name. Scroll right to see all 11 categories reviewed.\n\nIn 2023, the NFLPA worked with Statler Nagle and research experts at Artemis Strategy Group to further enhance the survey process and provide third-party perspective.\n\nThe survey was administered from August 26 to November 16, 2023. Artemis Strategy Group conducted the census survey online and provided access to every player on a 2023 NFL roster at the time of the survey. A total of 1,706 players completed the survey this year.\n\nAnswers were collected anonymously, and players evaluated their current workplace based on their club experience. The survey included both closed-ended and optional open-ended questions. Grades are calculated based on player responses to a series of survey rating questions in 11 categories. Each category grade is based primarily on scores from scaled rating questions. Grades also reflect additional details about workplace conditions, such as the quality of club offerings. Teams are ranked within each category and overall on the basis of their scores. Each team’s overall score is based on a weighted combination of grades for each of the 11 categories.\n\nThe overview section for each club’s “report card” and commentary accompanying each category ranking reflects player respondents’ opinions about the state of each club’s workplace. We note that the information collected from this survey reflects only the opinions of the 2023 players on each club roster who completed the survey."
