The NHLPA regulates the conduct of player agents under its Regulations Governing Agent Certification. The Agent Regulations set out the various terms under which agent duties must be performed, and include standards of conduct with which agents must comply. The NHLPA has the power to suspend, restrict, or terminate the certification of any agent for violation of these Agent Regulations.\n\nThe Agent Regulations also set out the procedure by which certification may be granted. Prospective agents must submit an application form and related materials detailing their education, background, their current business and personal relationships, as well as previous business dealings. The applications are then thoroughly reviewed by NHLPA staff, which may make further inquiries or conduct investigations before any decision regarding an applicant's certification has been rendered.\n\nA request to receive application materials must be made in writing, either by email, fax, or regular mail to:\n\nPlease include contact information your request for application materials, including your full name, home address, telephone number and email address."
