        "text": "The National Basketball Players Association will sell its Harlem headquarters building and move into 47,234 square feet in the Durst Organization’s 1133 Ave. of the Americas.\n\nArthur Mirante and Martin Cottingham of Avison Young represented the NBPA in the 21-plus year lease, which had an asking rent in the mid-$70s per foot. The Durst Organization was represented in-house by Tom Bow and Rocco Romeo.\n\n“We are bringing all the superstars to midtown and they will love it up here,” said Mirante, the tri-state president of Avison Young. “We will have a world-class training facility in a former RCA recording studio.”\n\nThe training facility on the double-height fifth floor will include a basketball court, while the executive offices will occupy part of the sixth floor.\n\n“Now they will have a home and the excitement of being in New York and be able to work out in privacy in Midtown Manhattan,” Mirante said.\n\nThe NBA store is nearby on Fifth Avenue, while the players will also be able to easily attend or play their own games at Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\nThe association is moving out of 11,000 square feet at 310 Lenox Ave., which is in contract to be sold to an investor. The 25,000 square-foot building is also the home of the Red Rooster Restaurant."
