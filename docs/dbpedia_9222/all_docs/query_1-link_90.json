        "text": "Run by our Coordinator Network, our Clinics focus on the fundamentals athletes need for success on the field. Each is designed by one of our sport specific Player Faculties, all of whom played professionally. We maintain a strict 8 to 1 player-to-coach ratio. Everyone receives the attention and help they need.\n\nWe believe in the power of feedback and growth. Our post-event reporting provides each athlete with individualized feedback, personally tailored corrective exercises, and an opportunity to review what was taught.\n\nWe’ve redefined player assessments through our ID Series. Developed by our Player Faculty and orchestrated by our Coordinator Network, the Series is designed to establish comprehensive player baselines. We go beyond the conventional “Five Tool” evaluation, adding position specific fundamental tests that provide deeper insights into a player’s potential for success on the field.\n\nAfter each ID event, our athletes receive a detailed post-event report that identifies strengths and areas for improvement that can be utilized as part of their development journey. We also offer specialized clinics addressing the core fundamentals tested during ID events. This ensures that athletes have a clear roadmap for evaluating their game.\n\nPlayers Way National Office events are the pinnacle of our programming and build upon the foundation established during our Clinics and ID Series. Held each fall, these exclusive events offer a unique opportunity for athletes looking to take their skills to the next level.\n\nInvitation only, our National Office events are multi-day in length and feature current and former professional players actively engaged in on-field coaching and instruction. These are not just another clinic or showcase; they’re immersive, high-caliber developmental experiences meticulously crafted by our Player Faculty.\n\nI’m Tony Clark, the Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. I’m a former baseball player and currently represent all current MLB and MiLB players. We’ve been where you are. We know the hard work, practice, training, and experience it takes to reach the top.

That’s why we founded Players Way – to provide you with access to current and former professional players who want to share their knowledge and experience. We want to help you maximize your abilities. Join us.\n\nMegan Wiggins will enter her 14th year of professional softball in 2024.

We know the hard work, commitment to detail, teamwork, preparation, and training that it takes to be the best you can be — both on and off the field!
