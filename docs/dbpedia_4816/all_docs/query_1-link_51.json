        "text": "When iPhone dev house, Tapulous, first launched in June, WWDC '08 was just around the corner, and there was nothing but potential for Mike Lee and the talented developers he recruited. The company is now known for popular iPhone apps like Tap Tap Revolution, Friend Book, and my favorite mobile Twitter client, Twinkle. Things are changing pretty quickly for Tapulous, however, and not exactly for the better. According to a blog post by Lee, \"irreconcilable differences\" within the company has led the board to request his resignation only a couple of months after things got started.\n\nI found Lee to ask a few more questions about what happened. \"The Engineering and Design team had concerns about the direction the company was heading,\" he told Ars. \"As the founder and leader of that team, it was my job to press those concerns. That put me at loggerheads to the other partners, and the board sided with them.\"\n\nTranslation: Those in charge of Tapulous' financial success wanted to make money at the expense of quality, and the developers/designers didn't.\n\nOf course, this outcome isn't a particularly shocking one, as it's (sadly) pretty typical of the venture capital-based Silicon Valley culture. However, the reason we care (and the reason some of you might care, too) is because what happens from here on out may affect the availability and quality of the apps that we have come to know and love. What exactly will happen with the team now that Lee is gone? \"They will probably end up following me,\" he said. \"I'm not doing anything to encourage that, and have made sure each and every one of them is aware that I want them to stay at Tapulous and will not be recruiting them. If they didn't end up staying at Tapulous, then I'm sure Apple would like to talk to them.\"\n\nThe future for Lee (and the gang?) is apparently bright, though. He told us that he hopes to eventually launch a new company (returning back to plan A, so to speak) around his United Lemur organization that would act as a \"fully-funded indie dev house, in the style of Omni.\" The (hopefully) for-profit venture would start by making quality software with the ultimate goal of helping to rebuild the rainforest in Madagascar. I told him that the project sounded pretty ambitious if he could even pull it off. \"I know, right? The crazy thing is... I think I can.\"\n\nGood luck, guys. We'll be waiting with bated breath to see what happens. In the meantime, don't take away my Twinkle!"
