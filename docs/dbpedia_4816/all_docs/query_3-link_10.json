        "text": "\"Do we have a separate QA function at Tapulous? The answer is no. A lot of that is basically because we're a scrappy little startup, and so we are very careful about how we spend our money, and we have limits on headcount. So at the moment we don't have the ability to take on a full time QA person.\n\nSome of that though is also of my Apple pedigree. Although there are dedicated QA people at Apple (and they're fantastic), the burden of initial quality assurance in any given product is definitely very heavily placed on the individual engineer at Apple. I don't believe that's a complete substitute for having a professional Quality Assurance engineer - I would love to have one - but I do think you can do a lot as an engineer to test your own code, test your own products, and just build that into the vibe and the religion of your company.\n\nSo that's what we're doing right now. And when we get ready to ship a product like Tap Tap Revenge 2 - one of our big ones - the entire company spends probably a whole day testing the app. We all get together and we bang on it as a team. It's great fun. We find the lion's share of problems, but we don't find them all.\"\n\n- Jessica Kahn, Director Of Engineering, Tapulous Inc."
