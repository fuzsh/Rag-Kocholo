        "text": "All of the excitement that Marc Andreessen’s insightful article in the Wall Street Journal generated has inspired us to share some data on the software industry:\n\n-- Data suggests that software is in fact “eating the world.” In 2001, 62% of VC investments were in software companies, but that has grown to 72% today. This gain has been mostly at the expense of \"Communication and Networking\" deals, whose share of VC-funded companies has shrunk 9%.\n\n-- You can begin to understand the decline in investment in the telecommunications space by looking at the public markets. For example, if an individual had invested in the S&P North American Technology-Software Index Fund (IGV) on 9/30/08 and sold on 6/30/11, the investment would have grown 4x what it would have grown in an investment in the S&P International Telecommunications Sector ETF (IYZ). For a more dramatic example, consider the following: An investment in Riverbed Technology (RVBD), a developer of software to accelerate application performance and data transmission speeds on WANs, would have generated a 6x return, versus an investment in Clearwire (CLWR), a provider of portable high-speed wireless broadband services, which would have generated a 0.3x return.\n\n-- Within software investing, the most noteworthy change in the allocation of investments is the rising share of recreational software. The space has grown from 2% of investments in 2001 to 9% in 2011 (10% in 2010), as investors try to emulate the success of companies such as Ngmoco and Tapulous. Communications software investing, on the other hand, has dropped 6%.\n\n-- Below is a list of the largest software exits since 2005. Some of the firms that are well-represented include Accel (Qlik, Riverbed), Apax (RealPage, IntraLinks), Battery Ventures (RealPage, ITA), Bessemer Venture Partners (Postini, Cornerstone), Index Ventures (Skype, MySQL), Insight Venture Partners (SolarWinds, Divx), Meritech Capital Partners (Cornerstone OnDemand, Riverbed), and Spectrum Equity (RiskMetrics, ITA Software).\n\n-- Index Venture’s Danny Rimer is the only VC responsible for two of the largest software exits, Skype and MySQL."
