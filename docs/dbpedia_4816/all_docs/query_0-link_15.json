The new roster of independent artists' songs is a complement to Tap Tap's library featuring hundreds of songs from leading artists like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Linkin Park, Ke$ha, Bruno Mars and LMFAO.\n\nCommenting on MuseIQ's catalog, Gwen Bethel Riley, Head of Business Affairs Music at Disney Mobile/Tapulous Inc. said \"MuseIQ's curated catalog of indie artists, \"Recordshop\", features a diverse selection of killer international artists and genres that appeal broadly to our Tour mode of worldwide gameplay. The 'searchability' of the catalog is also really, really easy to work with\".\n\nTap Tap Tour enjoyed immediate success at launch this summer going to #1 on the appstore in over 30 countries worldwide illustrating that both the gaming and the app industry are opening up new avenues for indie artists to dramatically expand their audience reach and grow their sales from new revenue streams. \"This is a great vindication for MuseIQ in how we curate and make easily available the most relevant new independent music and it's a real boost to the artists represented in our library\", said Augustus Skinner, co-founder and CEO of MuseIQ.\n\nOne of the songs licensed by MuseIQ to benefit from being featured in Tap Tap Revenge 4, that surged to #1 in the App store with 25,000 downloads within the first hour of its release, was Kat De Luna's \"Drop It Low\". Over a one week period of appearing in the game De Luna's tune jumped into the Billboard Dance Charts Top 20. \"It's exciting to see our licensing efforts make such a tangible impact on our artists' sales\", remarked MuseIQ's co-founder and COO, Ronan Coleman.\n\nAbout Tapulous Inc.\n\nTapulous, Inc. is an American software and video game developer and publisher based in Palo Alto, California.
