        "text": "Peer over the shoulder of that person fiddling with an iPhone. Chances are they're doing something other than making a phone call. They may be playing a game like Tetris or trading stocks through TD Ameritrade (AMTD). They may even be conducting serious business, with a mobile version of Salesforce.com's customer-management software. The possibilities grow by the day: Since Apple (AAPL) began letting outsiders offer software for the iPhone six months ago, more than 10,000 apps have been created.\n\nThis is more than just fun and games for Apple. The company has grabbed an early lead in turning the mobile phone into a high-powered computing device capable of running all kinds of applications. The average iPhone owner has downloaded at least 15 applications in the past six months. The average person carrying a phone from Nokia (NOK), Motorola (MOT), or others hasn't downloaded a single one, says Nielsen Mobile analyst Nic Covey. \"It's remarkable what Apple has accomplished in so short a time,\" he says."
