Artist Jorge Colombo recently drew widespread attention for creating the image for 's June 1 cover on an iPhone using Brushes, a $3.99 mobile application.\n\nBrushes was designed by Steve Sprang, a 32-year-old programmer who lives in Mountain View, Calif. Brushes simulates the experience of painting on the iPhone screen. Users select from a set of brushes and paint colors using their fingers directly on the screen. It is an application that he wanted to use himself: \"I like computer graphics and I like creative tools, so Brushes was definitely an app that I wanted to use myself,\" Sprang wrote in an e-mail. \"I expected it to appeal to others as well. I think a painting app is a natural fit for the iPhone.\""
