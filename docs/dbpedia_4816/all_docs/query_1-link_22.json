        "text": "\"Tap Tap Revenge 2\" is a Guitar Hero/Dance Dance Revolution-like game that big-name musicians have latched on to: The app comes with songs by Death Cab for Cutie, Stroke 9, and The Crystal Method; you can also download 150 more songs for free.\n\nThe first \"Tap Tap Revenge\" was the top game downloaded in 2008, according to Apple (AAPL). And it now has more than 6 million unique users, according to Decrem -- up from 3 million in early December. The game's popularity has helped Tapulous sell custom, musician-branded apps, including a Weezer Christmas app last year.\n\nTapulous broke even for the month of December, and Decrem hopes that by the middle of the year, they'll be cash flow positive every month. With about 10 employees, that means they need about $100,000 in advertising and premium app revenue per month to get there. Tapulous raised about $1 million around the holidays, which means they've raised a little less than $3 million from angel investors so far."
