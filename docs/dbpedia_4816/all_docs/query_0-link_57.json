        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAs Apple's iPhone continued its popularity this year, and the iPad launched in April, many iOS app developers had an amazing year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese include some great games, some neat social tools, some big money-makers, some cool hardware add-ons, and some who pushed the limits on what Apple's portable gadgets could do.\n\nAnd we're equally surprised by the cool stuff coming out of big companies and small startups alike.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram's cool social photography app quickly attracted 1 million users\n\nInstagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger have basically built what Apple should copy for its built-in camera app.\n\nInstagram lets you take pictures, add cool filters to your photos, and share them with a bunch of places, including Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, and Tumblr. And it includes a very simple, built-in social network, which lets you share photos with friends, \"like\" them, and comment on them.\n\nIt's beautiful software, and it's no wonder that it has become so popular so quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNgmoco and Tapulous showed that the iPhone gaming market is super valuable, by each getting acquired for millions of dollars\n\nNgmoco and Tapulous have each made some of the hottest iPhone games, each was an early driver of social gaming for the iPhone, and each has been driving revenue via in-app purchases and virtual goods.\n\nIn July, Disney acquired Tapulous, and its CEO Bart Decrem is now running three mobile app studios for Disney.\n\nIn October, Japanese gaming giant DeNA acquired Ngmoco for a reported ~$400 million. (That's CEO Neil Young on the left.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Incident\" is the first (and coolest) game we've seen that you can play on an iPad that's plugged into a TV, using an iPhone as the controller\n\nBeyond being a very neat (and very addictive) 8-bit-looking casual game, \"The Incident\" shows that Apple's iOS gaming platform has a bright future in the living room.\n\nIt's made by Matt Comi of Big Bucket Software and Neven Mrgan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlipboard made the coolest news reading app of the year for the iPad\n\nLed by founders Mike McCue and Evan Doll, Flipboard made the first news reading app for the iPad that feels like it was designed for an iPad.\n\nYou effortlessly flip through news stories and photos, either curated by your friends -- via your Twitter or Facebook feeds -- or by Flipboard itself.\n\nIs it going to save the media business? No, probably not. But it's definitely a sign of what's to come -- from both small startups and media giants alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarco Arment's \"Instapaper\" continues to be one of the best, most polished apps for iOS\n\nThis year, Marco Arment did the coolest thing any app-maker could do: He quit his day job at Tumblr to focus on Instapaper full-time.\n\nInstapaper has long been one of our favorite apps and websites; it lets you read articles later that you don't have time to read right now.\n\nArment is a perfectionist and it shows in his work, with smart and user-friendly touches that other app makers wouldn't even dream of. In the past, this included the first (and best) example we had seen of tilt-based scrolling, which scrolled pages up and down based on the angle you were holding your iPhone.\n\nMore recently, he made a feature that lets you automatically scroll back down a page if you accidentally scroll to the top by inadvertently tapping on the iPhone's time/status bar. And he introduced a very smart feature that uses your location and sunrise/sunset tables to automatically toggle between \"day\" and \"night\" mode in his app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmule made neat music apps for the iPad that even musicians could appreciate\n\nThere are zillions of musical apps for the iPhone and iPad, but none are as whimsical and engaging as Smule's, which include built-in social features.\n\nThe brains behind Smule include Dr. Ge Wang, who is an Assistant Professor at Stanford University and is the founding director of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra and of the Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra, and Jeff Smith, who's pursuing a PhD in Computer Music at Stanford and is an email security genius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoren Brichter continued his excellent work on iOS Twitter apps, now as part of Twitter Inc.\n\nLoren Brichter's Tweetie 2 was the best Twitter app for the iPhone, and Twitter was smart to acquire it (and him) earlier this year. (Earlier, Brichter famously invented the \"pull to refresh\" feature that many iPhone apps have since ripped off.)\n\nThis year's most interesting iOS work from Twitter is its iPad app, which uses a novel but attractive user interface (that, for some, takes some getting used to).\n\nEpic Software brought the Unreal 3 engine over to iOS and is powering amazing games like \"Infinity Blade\"\n\nThese are the sort of amazing graphics that make you forget you're playing on a phone or iPad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMajor League Baseball's \"At Bat\" was the top-grossing iPhone app this year, meaning they took home more non-ad revenue than any other app\n\nIt sure helps to have an exclusive license for high-end content like MLB Advanced Media does!\n\nThe company also continued its streak of pushing the envelope on iOS apps with the new At Bat for iPad, which became our preferred way of watching Chicago Cubs games this season. (At least until the Cubs were out of it... in June.)\n\nMLBAM's tech leadership includes CEO Bob Bowman, CTO Joe Choti, and SVP Joe Inzerillo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \"Angry Birds\" team made the new Pac-Man\n\niPhone game \"Angry Birds\" became HUGE this year -- it sat atop the bestselling apps list for much of the year, becoming, as John Gruber called it, the sort-of new Pac-Man for the iPhone. We see people playing it EVERYWHERE, and people even dressed up as Angry Birds for Halloween.\n\nThe Finnish company behind it, Rovio, is led by Mikael Hed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarbucks is the first big restaurant chain that lets you pay in-store with your iPhone app\n\nIt's going to be a while before mobile payments are figured out and universally accepted, but Starbucks is forging ahead.\n\nThis year, it expanded its program that lets you use the Starbucks Card app to pay for your in-store purchases. The app generates a barcode, which the Starbucks cashier can scan as a payment method.\n\nThe main problem is that it takes longer to type in your password to load the app than it takes to whip out your Starbucks card from your wallet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase Bank lets you deposit checks on your iPhone, just by taking photos of them\n\nWe weren't expecting this kind of innovation from a giant bank like Chase.\n\nBut as Chase customers, we're blown away by the convenience of being able to deposit a check from anywhere, just by shooting photos of the front and back of checks on our iPhone, and uploading them via the Chase app.\n\nThe only problem is that it's sometimes a little too sensitive -- it doesn't seem to like darker checks, or photos taken in lower light conditions. Still, nice to save a trip to the ATM whenever possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScrabble for the iPad is a very cool digital board game\n\nThe party mode feature of EA's Scrabble for the iPad is the coolest part. This lets you use iPhones and iPod touches as each player's letter tile racks.\n\nPlayers can \"flick\" the tiles from their phones onto the main iPad screen (all using wireless connections) and place them where they want them on the Scrabble board.\n\nAs Engadget wrote, \"Scrabble for the iPad: stir in some iPhones and it's the best $1,000 you ever spent on a board game.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShopkick rolled out a shopping app with real-money rewards, with HUGE partners including Best Buy, American Eagle, and Target\n\nFoursquare obviously had a big year in 2010, but this year's coolest new geo/social/deals entrant was Shopkick, which uses a little radio beacon in stores to make sure that you're actually in the store before you can collect deals or earn points toward real-world rewards.\n\nUnder CEO Cyriac Roeding, CTO Aaron Emigh, and CPO Jeff Sellinger, Shopkick launched with huge partners including Best Buy, American Eagle, and Macy's, and signed up Target and Crate and Barrel later in the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSquare lets you use your iPhone or iPad as a credit card reader\n\nRun a taco truck or a flea market stand, or just want to sell someone a couch on Craigslist and take credit cards? Or just want to expedite how quickly your broke friends can pay you back?\n\nSquare, led by cofounders Jack Dorsey (the guy who invented Twitter) and Jim McKelvey, launched its cute little credit card reader jack for the iPhone and iPad this year.\n\nIt's a really ambitious idea, and may never catch on with enough people to become a viable business, but it's sure neat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad DJ Rana Sobhany has been traveling the globe playing sets\n\nWhen the iPad came out this past spring, Rana Sobhany quickly figured out it could be used as DJ equipment.\n\nSince then, she's been traveling around the world, playing events at venues as wide-ranging as Webster Hall in New York City to the House of Blues in LA to an Apple Store.\n\nIn the meantime, she's also had time to write a book about marketing and selling iPhone apps, Mobilize, based on her early experience in the iPhone app industry at Medialets, an iPhone analytics and ad tech firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn just a few months, the team behind the Glif invented an iPhone tripod gadget, got it funded, and made it\n\nThe Glif does two things: It props up your iPhone 4 so you can watch video in a more relaxed position, and it hooks your iPhone 4 up to a tripod for still- or video camera shooting.\n\nThe Glif team, Tom Gerhardt and Dan Provost, came up with the idea, raised almost $140,000 to build it (using the website Kickstarter), and shipped the first orders in time for the holidays. Very cool!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Word Lens\" translates words in the real world, in real-time\n\nThis is the first \"augmented reality\" app that isn't stupid.\n\n\"Word Lens,\" which just launched in December, lets you hold your iPhone camera up to the real world, and it will recognize words and translate them in real-time.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's very cool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE BLEACHERS: Here's who did NOT do the coolest stuff for the iPhone or iPad this year\n\n- Facebook, which was an early leader on the iPhone, didn't do anything that interesting for the iPhone this year. It added some new features like Places, and it's still a must-have app, but there was no innovation. And there's still no Facebook iPad app, which has created a cottage industry of wannabes.\n\n- Big media companies, which have invested a bunch of money in the iPhone and iPad, but mostly make mediocre apps that all look and work the same. They're fine, but nothing special.\n\n- Microsoft, the biggest software company in the world, hasn't done anything interesting for the iPhone or iPad yet. We don't exactly blame them -- they're still betting the most on Windows, Windows Phone 7, and the Xbox -- but right now, they're missing out on a fast-growing platform. Where's Office 2011 for the iPad, when Apple's iWork Office clone represented the 3 top-grossing iPad apps this year?\n\n- Google finally got its Google Voice and Latitude apps approved for the iPhone, but it seems to be doing its best work for Android. Understandable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily. Read preview\n\nThanks for signing up!
