        "text": "Have you ever heard the following? \"I have put in 60+ hours this week\" \"I wear many hats so I have to put in long hours and even work weekends to keep up\" \"I am afraid to take a vacation because the amount of work I will come back to means I will buried for weeks or months after. Its not worth it.\" Too often we encounter teams that are over worked because of lack of a defined process. Not only a defined process, but a defined process that is efficient and scalable. Too often the solution in these situations is to hire more and throw as many bodies at the problem as possible while putting as many Band-Aids in place with the false belief that this will support a growing company. Instead what this does is lead to the above statements and your workers being driven into the ground with fires to put out. We at RevOps initiative are firm believers that even in an environment with disconnected tool sets and lack of automation, teams can still be efficient and effective with a defined process. Ideal tech stack that integrate and automate every day tasks, as well as reduce the number of clicks will come as the company grows. It is important to have a defined process from the beginning so that your teams know what to do and when. With the help of RevOp Initiative we can help put structure around your processes, recommend tool sets, and ultimately help dig your teams out of the pile of work they are under. So, instead of the above statements, your workers can say, \"With the help of RevOps Initiative, I can finally take a vacation with my family.\" üòé #revops #revopsconulting #revopsasaservice #revenueoperations #revopsinitiative #ROI\n\nI'm 6 weeks into my role at Care.com. 6 weeks ago, I knew nothing. Today, I know a lot more. But only because of the people willing to share their ‚Äúinsider info‚Äù with me. Are you sharing your insider info with those newbies at your work? I hope so; they need it. I certainly have. The most rewarding part of these past six weeks has been diving into the business, gaining a clearer understanding of the bigger picture, and uncovering what was previously hidden from me. While most people, including myself, are more familiar with the consumer side of the Care.com business, where we connect caregivers with those in need of child, senior, and pet care, there's so much more that we provide. Especially on the B2B side, where we offer all sorts of employee benefit platforms to many of the country's largest employers. This is where I‚Äôm focused. It's been both exhausting and exhilarating to discover the nuances of how everything works together, figuring out what's working well and what's not. Understanding our real value, why we exist, how we're impacting the lives of millions of people, and how we can seize numerous opportunities ahead. What's been incredibly helpful are the folks who've shared their knowledge with me. They've explained the \"why,\" provided context, and talked about decisions made years ago that affect us today. They spent an extra 5 minutes after a meeting, sent me links to reports and Jira boards that I had no idea existed, explained the crazy acronyms, and gently corrected me when I was getting something wrong. That‚Äôs power. Knowledge is power. Don‚Äôt forget what you have. Share it. It‚Äôs an incredible gift. Especially for those around you that are just getting started. #Knowledge #Power #Sharing #Learning #productmanagement ___ Hi, üëã I'm Brian Peterson. I write and speak about personal and professional growth, leadership, and all things product management. Follow me and click the üîî to get notified of future posts. I recently founded \"Getting Product Right\" because product management is easy to get wrong and hard to get right. After nearly two decades and devoting over 30,000 hours of my time to getting people, process, and product right, I'm now on a mission to help others.\n\nUsing a simple story to explain M&E Story: SuperHero For Project Once upon a time, in a magical land called Evaluation Kingdom, there lived a special person named Mr. Monitor and Ms. Evaluate, also known as M and E for short. They were like detectives, but instead of solving mysteries, they helped people understand if their projects were working well. One sunny day, a curious 9-year-old named Tunde asked them, \"What do you do as M and E officers?\" Mr. Monitor smiled and said, \"Well, Tunde, our job is like being a superhero for projects. When someone creates something cool, like a new school program or a health campaign, they want to know if it's helping people. That's where we come in!\" Ms. Evaluate added, \"We have special tools to collect information, like asking questions, looking at numbers, and talking to people. It's like putting together puzzle pieces to see the big picture.\" Tunde's eyes sparkled with interest. \"So, you help make sure things are going well and fix them if they're not?\" \"Exactly!\" Mr. Monitor nodded. \"If something isn't working as planned, we figure out why and help make it better. It's like being a problem solver and a helper at the same time.\" Ms. Evaluate chimed in, \"And we also celebrate when things are going great! We cheer for everyone who's doing a fantastic job.\" Tunde clapped his hands. \"Wow, you're like magical helpers for projects! I want to be an M and E officer when I grow up.\" Both Mr. Monitor and Ms. Evaluate smiled warmly. \"That's wonderful, Tunde! Remember, being an M and E officer means caring about making things better for everyone. You'd make a fantastic one someday!\" And from that day on, Tunde dreamed of becoming a superhero M and E officer, making the world a better place, one project at a time. #M&E #NGO #PublicHealth #LinkedIn #Jobs #Remote #Hybrid"
