        "text": "A number of new games and applications have shown their faces this week on the iOSâ€™ top grossing apps list. That said, a handful of older titles also emerged due to recent updates and specials. In fact, the long running Tap Zoo even rose to #1 again because of just such a thing. All in all, however, it was games that dominated both charts this time around for both iPhone and iPad."
