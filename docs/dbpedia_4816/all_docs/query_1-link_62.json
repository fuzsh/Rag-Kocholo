        "text": "“There were a lot of happy game developers among the 200 or so people who attended Thursday’s iGames Summit, which was devoted to iPhone games,” Dean Takahashi reports for VentureBeat.\n\n“This week, Apple announced its iPhone 3.0 update coming this summer would have a number of game-friendly features: a virtual goods platform, Bluetooth multiplayer, and peer-to-peer connectivity. The game developers [at iGames] such as Tapulous, ngmoco, Booyah, Demiforce, Zynga and Social Gaming Network were all excited about the progress Apple has made in making a game-friendly platform,” Takahashi reports.\n\n“With more than 30 million iPhone and iPod Touch users to target, the developers see more potential to make lasting businesses. By accident or design, Apple has created a vibrant game ecosystem that keeps on getting stronger,” Takahashi reports.\n\nMacDailyNews Take: It wasn’t by accident, Dean.\n\nTakahashi continues, “Keith Lee, chief executive of Booyah, predicted that the iPhone and iPod Touch installed base would reach more than 100 million by the end of 2010. That’s far faster than the nearly six years it took for the Nintendo DS to reach more the same number.”"
