        "text": "It looks like Tapulous founder Bart Decrem is ready for his next act, as the gaming exec appears to have raised some money for a new venture called “Hobby.”\n\nIn the mobile gaming world, you can’t do much better than Decrem. He was the founder of Tapulous, the company behind the ultra-addictive Tap Tap Revenge series which got acquired by Disney back in 2010.\n\nSince the acquisition, he had led that company’s gaming studio as SVP and GM, as it released its own series of hits, including those in the Where’s My Water series, as well as some Temple Run titles.\n\nAll in all, he’s had 25 #1 hits on the Apple App Store since it opened up in 2008.\n\nPrior to Tapulous, Decrem was also one of the founders of early social browser Flock, which eventually sold to Zynga (long after he left).\n\nDecrem announced that he was leaving Disney in January, after about four years with the company. On his LinkedIn page, Decrem says he’s currently an “in between entrepreneur” and taking time off to think about what he wants to do next… But apparently he didn’t take too much time off. According to an SEC filing, Decrem has raised $920,000 for what appears to be his next venture.\n\nAlong with Decrem, Scale VP managing director Rob Theis is listed as a director in the company. That shouldn’t be too surprising, as Theis was one of Tapulous’ investors. Before founding Tapulous, Decrem had also served as an EIR at DCM, Theis’ former firm.\n\nAlso listed is Anthony McCusker, who seems to be a pretty well-regarded tech attorney as part of Goodwin Procter LLP.\n\nFrankly we don’t know anything more about Hobby, except for what’s in that filing. (Good luck Googling the word Hobby!) But I’ve reached out to Decrem and Theis to see if they’re willing to share more. Will let you know if I hear back!"
