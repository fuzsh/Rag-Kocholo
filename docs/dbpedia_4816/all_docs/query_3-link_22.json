        "text": "In addition to launching its tablet Wednesday, Apple will likely introduce a new programming solution for iPhone developers to easily tablet-enable their apps.\n\nDevelopers polled by Wired said they expected additions to Apple's software-development kit that would help make iPhone apps work at any resolution, for full-screen support on the rumored device.\n\nBut how will that work? The tablet will likely support all iPhone apps out of the box in their current 480-by-320 resolution. These apps will probably be able to run in the background, perhaps in separate windows. It's unlikely they're going to automatically maximize to fill up the tablet's screen, which is rumored to be 10 inches diagonally, developers polled by Wired.com agreed, because that would result in a blurry, pixelated mess -- not Apple's style.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that Apple will offer a quick workaround for developers to rescale their apps for full-screen tablet support.\n\nFor people who buy the tablet, that means we'll see a slightly bifurcated world of apps. We'll be able to access all iPhone apps in small windows, and some of those apps will be resizable to fit the tablet's larger screen.\n\n\"It's easy to imagine how Apple might offer tools to make it easy for me to not have to make all my graphics from scratch,\" said Bart Decrem, CEO of Tapulous, developer of the popular iPhone rhythm game Tap Tap Revenge. \"That's one of the things I'd be on the lookout for.\"\n\n\"We've made a big investment,\" he continued. \"People have made huge investments in their games. I'd expect Apple to accelerate the process of having lots and lots of apps that feel native and migrate from a fixed-resolution world to resolution independent.\"\n\nDecrem said he could not comment on whether Tapulous would be appearing as a presenter at Apple's Jan. 27 event in San Francisco, where the Cupertino, California, company is rumored to be launching a tablet. Tapulous appeared in the recent September iPod event to present a new game, Riddim Ribbon.\n\nMultiple independent reports agree on the physical description of Apple's tablet: a blown-up iPhone or iPod Touch with a 10-inch screen. But the software experience has remained a mystery. Offering a glimmer of insight, The New York Times just a day before Apple's product event has published a bold report claiming the tablet would support all 100,000 iPhone and iPod Touch apps currently in the App Store.\n\n\"It will run all the applications of the iPhone and iPod touch, have a persistent wireless connection over 3G cellphone networks and Wi-Fi, and will be built with a 10-inch color display, allowing newspapers, magazines and book publishers to deliver their products with an eye to the design that had grabbed readers in print,\" NY Times wrote.\n\nCorroborating NY Times' report, McGraw-Hill CEO Terry McGraw said in a live TV interview that McGraw was developing e-book content for the Apple tablet. He explained that the tablet's OS was based on the iPhone OS, meaning McGraw's e-book iPhone apps will be easily portable to the tablet.\n\nOther iPhone developers polled by Wired agreed that Decrem's theory was solid. They said the SDK needed to be updated with new tools streamlining migration to the upcoming tablet. Jeff Meininger, iPhone developer of Snaptic, said Decrem's proposed solution regarding resolution-independence would work.\n\n\"It would be the simplest and most effective way to be able to support all iPhone apps,\" Meininger said. \"It's absolutely technically feasible.\"\n\nDavid Castelnuovo, developer of the immensely popular iPhone game Pocket God, said it was likely Apple would offer some new sizability code in the iPhone SDK with the tablet in mind. But he said it wouldn't be a blanket solution for all 100,000 apps in the App Store.\n\nPocket God, for example, is game that involves torturing pygmies on an island, and it would have to be redesigned for a tablet with a bigger island and more pygmies, Castelnuovo said. So, some quick and easy sizability code will likely accelerate full-screen tablet support for form-based apps such as Facebook. For games or apps with more complex interfaces, it could take more thoughtful tweaking.\n\n\"Ideally we wouldn't want to just scale [Pocket God],\" Castelnuovo said. \"We'd want to make the world bigger.\"\n\nJust how big a portion of the App Store will support full-screen tablet resolution will be up to the developers. Appcelerator, a company that helps developers build cross-platform mobile apps, polled 554 developers on their interest in coding for the tablet. 51 percent of respondents said it would be \"very important\" for them to port iPhone apps for the tablet \"in a simple, easy fashion without too much cost or delay.\" Thirty percent responded \"Somewhat important\" and 19 percent responded \"Not important.\"\n\nIt remains a question whether Apple will launch an entire section in its App Store for tablet apps. Decrem said he doubts that, because all iPhone apps will work with the tablet. He said it's realistic that developers will state in their apps' descriptions whether they feature full tablet support.\n\nWe'll find out soon.
