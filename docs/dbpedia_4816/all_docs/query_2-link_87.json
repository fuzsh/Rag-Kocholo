        "text": "Los Angeles, CA — March 28, 2012 — The 6th annual Digital Kids Conference is pleased to present Bart Decrem, SVP and General Manager of Disney Mobile, as its day-two keynote speaker. Decrem, who leads the business unit behind the wildly successful Where’s My Water? mobile gaming phenomenon, takes the floor of the Expo Hall at the Pasadena Convention Center in Los Angeles at 9:30 a.m., April 26 to discuss Growing Up Mobile — Developing a Global Franchise for the Mobile Generation.\n\nDecrem will address how content producers are changing their ways to reach a generation growing up with mobile and tablet devices as their screens of choice. He will also delve into how entertainment companies like Disney are changing their character development and consumer experiences to serve their next generation of guests. Digital Kids is the largest gathering of professionals engaged in building online and mobile products and services for kids. The show features 70+ speakers in 5 conference tracks including: Safety, Content, Operations, Business and Market Research.\n\nSpeakers include industry leaders such as Disney, Wizard101/KingsIsle, Rovio/Angry Birds, Spin Master, National Football League, Cartoon Network, Ubisoft, Cookie Jar, Sony Online, KIDZBOP, Mind Candy, Peanuts, Google, Yahoo! Kids, The NPD Group, Federal Trade Commission, California Attorney General and many more.\n\nDecrem rounds out two days of compelling keynotes. The Digital Kids Conference day-one keynote features Todd Coleman and Josef Hall, co-creators of KingsIsle Entertainment’s popular online game Wizard101, discussing how they moved from hardcore gaming in the world of massively multiplayer online games (MMOG) and achieved runaway critical and commercial success with the #1 AAA family-friendly online social game in North America.\n\nA seasoned Silicon Valley entrepreneur and product visionary, Bart founded Tapulous in 2008. The company quickly became a leading app developer, with more than one billion games played among all Tapulous apps to-date. In July, 2010, Tapulous became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, becoming part of Disney Interactive Media Group.\n\nBefore founding Tapulous, Bart headed marketing and business affairs for the Firefox 1.0 launch. He was also a co-founder of desktop Linux startup Eazel and the founding chief executive officer of Flock, the social web browser company.\n\nBart has been an Entrepreneur In Residence at Doll Capital Management and worked on a number of community projects. He was born and raised in Belgium, holds a JD from Stanford Law School.\n\nOnline registration for Digital Kids ends April 20th. Digital Kids offers both a 1 Day Pass (good for either day you choose) and a 2 Day, All Access Pass."
