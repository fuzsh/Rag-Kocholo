        "text": "Presentation: TweetLearning From Games\n\nThe automotive industry has long held that \"racing improves the breed\" â€” that the knowledge, technology, and techniques that enhance our boring, everyday lives are best developed under extreme and often adversarial conditions, at the edge of human ability.\n\nSoftware too has its frontier heroes, pushing themselves and their products so far beyond what came before, we all move forward in their wake. In no sector is their concentration higher than the multi-billion euro electronic games industry.\n\nFrom the simplest \"Game & Watch\" to the latest consoles, from the ubiquity of the App Store, to the richness of fully immersive virtual societies, games let us explore the infinite, imagine the impossible, and come one step closer to understanding humans.\n\nPresentation: TweetKEYNOTE: The App Universe After the Big Bang\n\nThere was a time when mobile computing and productized apps were magic fairy dust that sprinkled money all over a project. Those were good times. The big bang, the heady expansion, the flash of chaos as the past gave way to the future. But now that the future is the present, and the gold rush is over, where do we go from here?\n\nWhat kind of ideas are worth pursuing? Are app-based startups a thing anymore? What kind of business plans make sense? Is there room for indie apps? How about indie games? Can we still make a living doing this? Can we still live the dream and be our own boss? Can we still be artists?\n\nMike Lee has been there along the way, and will share his war stories and market analysis from having witnessed history being made. You won't want to miss it!"
