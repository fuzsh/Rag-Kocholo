        "text": "Tapulous CEO Bart Decrem thinks Apple will attract more users with the new iPhone 3G S, providing a larger audience for games like his firm's Tap Tap Revenge.\n\n\"It's a great new device that will offer a fantastic experience for users, and allows us to do even more with our game,\" he says.\n\n\"It's also a fantastic end-user offering that, with its new capabilities, will bring more users onto the platform and increases the gap with Apple's competitors.\"\n\nWhat does the fact that there will now be two tiers of iPhone mean for Tapulous and Tap Tap Revenge, though? Decrem admits that his engineering team hasn't had time to digest the full implications yet, but has some thoughts.\n\n\"It is possible that we will offer a slightly different experience for users on the more powerful class of devices,\" he says. \"For example, we may offer slightly simpler themes for users coming in with slower devices.\"\n\nDecrem says this is nothing new for Tapulous to get to grips with, though. \"To be fair, we already do some of that today,\" he says.\n\n\"Tap Tap Revenge themes come with built-in throttling where, if framerates drop, we strip away certain visual effects to ensure optimum performance. We may do that in a more systematic manner as the 3G S comes online.\""
