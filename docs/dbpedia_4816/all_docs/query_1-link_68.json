        "text": "Background\n\nIn 1988, Disney ended the partnership with Sierra On-Line and entered the video games market on its own with the establishment of Walt Disney Computer Software, which would be renamed Disney Interactive in 1995.\n\n1st Logo (September 7, 1988-1990)\n\nDOS version\n\nCommodore 64 version\n\nApple II version\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a pixel art recreation of Sleeping Beauty Castle from Disneyland is seen, with fireworks being set off around the castle (which animate by disappearing and reappearing in an unsettling fashion). After a short while, all the fireworks appear onscreen and \"DiSNEY\" in its corporate font appears overlapping the castle.\n\nVariants: While the base logo concept is the same, all 3 platforms it appeared on had wildly different appearances and even animation orders.\n\nDOS: The art is higher quality than the other versions, but the entire logo is colored in a mix of black, white, cyan, and pink. The fireworks also appear in 2 groups, 3 on the left and 2 on the right, and the \"DiSNEY\" text appears after the music stops.\n\nCommodore 64: The details are blocky and simplified greatly, but the color palette is of a higher count. 4 fireworks, 2 on each side of the screen, blink in a random fashion, and the \"DiSNEY\" text appears just before the music ends.\n\nApple II: Similar to the Commodore 64 version, but the color palette is highly saturated, a 5th firework burst is added to the left (similar to the DOS version), the \"DiSNEY\" text is now in orange, and the images wipe in. On Matterhorn Screamer!, the animation also starts after the music finishes, resulting in just having the castle being shown for 12 seconds.\n\nTechnique: Sprite-based animation.\n\nAudio: An 8-bit rendition of the song \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" from Song of the South, which depends on the platform. On at least the Apple II port of The Chase on Tom Sawyer's Island, it is silent.\n\nAvailability: It was only seen on Matterhorn Screamer! and The Chase on Tom Sawyer's Island.\n\n2nd Logo (1990-1995)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, the \"faux-3D\" text is seen in the following arrangement:\n\nDiSNEY\n\nS O F T W A R E\n\n\"DiSNEY\" is in its corporate script font, and a underline with a 4-pointed star is seen between the text.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, \"PRESENTS\" is shown below the logo.\n\nSeveral games tend to lack the star on the underline. This tend to appear on their PC titles, which also used to feature developer credits.\n\nTwo animated variants of this logo exist:\n\nThe first variant has sparkles running through the logo at the beginning.\n\nThe second variant has Tinker Bell from the 1953 movie Peter Pan fly in from the left and waves her hand to form the Disney Software logo. She exits out of the screen, leaving a trail of pixie dust to dissolve. There is also an elephant trumpeting when the Disney Software logo appears.\n\nA third version has the logo zoom in. This only appeared on the DOS version of The Rocketeer.\n\nOn Game Boy games, this logo is in black and white.\n\nOn Beauty and the Beast, the logo is black on a white background.\n\nOn Aladdin for Game Boy and Genesis and The Lion King for SNES and Genesis, the Virgin Interactive logo is seen below the Disney Software logo, with \"A\" and \"CO-PRODUCTION\" above and below respectively, and \"AND\" sandwiched in the middle between the Disney Software logo and the Virgin Interactive logo, forming the message \"A Disney SOFTWARE and Virgin INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT Co-Production\". (For example, the custom variant that was seen on Aladdin for Game Boy and Genesis features the Genie flying from left to right past the Disney Software and Virgin Interactive logos; sometimes it has copyright info below.)\n\nOn The Jungle Book for Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System, the logo reads just \"WALT DiSNEY\". The logo shines, then freezes.\n\nOn early prints of Disney's Activity Center: Aladdin, the logo is rendered in a higher quality and is placed on a purple smoky background.\n\nTechnique: Sprite-based animation.\n\nAudio: The opening of the game's theme or silent.\n\nAvailability: Seen on a majority of their games during the time frame.\n\nSome games, like their series of Mickey Mouse educational titles, omit this logo.\n\nThe first animated version can be seen on Aladdin for DOS and Amiga.\n\nThe second animated version is only seen on The Jungle Book for the SNES."
