Tapulous, developer of popular apps for the iPhone including Tap Tap Revenge, has been acquired by Disney to integrate into its Interactive Media Group.

Through this merger agreement, Tapulous is now wholly owned by the Walt Disney Company but co-founders and creators of the addictive Tap Tap games series Bart Decrem and Andrew Lacy will be coming on board, too.

“As part of Disney Interactive Media Group (DIMG), we’ll develop more games more quickly and with the resources of the world’s leading entertainment company,” said Bart Decrem, CEO of Tapulous.

“We will continue to develop apps that live at the intersection of music and gaming, but we’ll also push into new and exciting areas of mobile social entertainment. We’re literally bursting with ideas for new apps.

While Tapulous is better known for the Tap Tap series of music timing skills games, which essentially act as Guitar Hero for touchscreen phones, it also created one of the first Twitter apps for the iPhone in the form of Twinkle, which had already gained a large following before Tweetie and Tweetdeck came on the scene.

The Tap Tap series includes ones with official songs from ‘popular’ bands like Nickelback and Coldplay, but also has games that features pop hits from Lady Gaga, Mos Def and the like.

DIMG president Steve Wadsworth said mobile gaming is seeing “unprecedented growth” and felt it was the right time for Disney to strengthen its position in the mobile business.

“In a short time, Bart and Andrew have built Tapulous into a successful and accomplished mobile games developer that’s emerged as one of the most successful companies in the industry,” he added.
