        "text": "David Henry Wilson was a physician and politician. He lived at 1966 Haro Street from 1911 to 1926.\n\nEarly Life\n\nDavid Henry Wilson was born on October 2, 1855, in Huntley, near Ottawa, Ontario. His parents were Thomas Wilson. and Sarah McDaniel.\n\nDavid went to school in Huntley, and he later attended Pakenham High School.\n\nHe received his M.D. degree from Trinity Medical College in Toronto, Ontario in 1878. After practicing for a short time as a physician in Ontario, in 1879 he moved to Nelson, Manitoba.\n\nFrom 1881 to 1888, he was a member of the Manitoba legislature, including a brief period when David Howard Harrison was the premier of Manitoba. (David Howard Harrison lived at 1818 Barclay Street from 1902 to 1904).\n\nMarriage to Annie Armstrong\n\nOn January 6, 1887, David married Annie Elizabeth Armstrong. She was born in Ontario on January 1, 1863. Her parents were Robert Armstrong and Jane Harris.\n\nAbout 1888, the Wilsons moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, for a period of a few months.\n\nTo Vancouver\n\nIn the spring of 1889, the Wilsons moved to Vancouver, where David established a medical practice. [Some sources say David arrived in Vancouver in 1894, but he was already in the Vancouver directory by 1890.]\n\nThe family lived at the following addresses in Vancouver.\n\n1890 Robson Street, near Thurlow Street [1042 Robson Street] 1891 to 1902 1042 Robson Street 1904 to 1905 811 Thurlow Street 1906 to 1907 1076 Robson Street 1911 to 1926 1966 Haro Street\n\nIn 1889, David became the first president of the Vancouver Medical Association. In 1894, he became the president of the Vancouver Liberal-Conservative Association.\n\nIn September 1902, David was in his horse-drawn buggy on the wharf in Vancouver. The Charmer, a steam-driven vessel that regularly sailed from Vancouver to Victoria, sounded its whistle to signal that it was ready to depart.\n\nThe sound of the whistle startled David’s horse, which jumped and tried to tear itself loose from the buggy. One of the buggy’s wheels broke, throwing David out of the buggy onto the wharf. He held onto the reins for a short time until he had to let go. His injuries were minor, and he recovered.\n\nBusiness and Society Life\n\nDavid was involved in several financial businesses. He was a director of the Dominion Trust Company. He was the vice-president of B.C. Permanent Loan Company and the Pacific Coast Fire Insurance Company. He was president of the Royal Plate Glass Insurance Company.\n\nHe was a member of the Vancouver Club.\n\nHouse at 1966 Haro Street\n\nIn 1910, David hired the architectural firm and Maclure and Fox to design his new home at the corner of Haro Street and Chilco Street. According to some sources, the house was to cost $31,000, which was a vast sum of money at that time. In June 1911, the Wilson family moved into the new house. (A newspaper notice said that the house was at the corner of Comox Street and Chilco Street, rather than at the corner of Haro and Chilco.)\n\nSome additions and changes in and near the property were still happening after 1911. In 1912, David bought the house next door and moved it, so that he would have more clear land around his own house.\n\nLater Life\n\nDavid continued in business until the mid-1920s.\n\nHe died in Vancouver on December 10, 1926. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nAnnie died in Vancouver on June 20, 1929. She was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nDavid and Annie had the following children.\n\nSarah Kathleen Wilson\n\nSarah Kathleen Wilson was born on March 17, 1889, in St. Paul, Minnesota. On June 4, 1913, in London, England, she married Colin Wolseley Graham, who was a physician. He was born on November 28, 1882, in Montreal, Quebec. His parents were Robert Graham and Grace Newlands.\n\nAfter the marriage, Colin and Sarah went to Vienna, where Colin was to study for a year before returning to Vancouver.\n\nColin and Sarah lived in Vancouver from the period of the First World War through to the mid-1940s. They were at 1934 Haro Street from 1914 to 1916.\n\nColin died in Vancouver on June 8, 1946.\n\nSarah died in Vancouver on October 23, 1978.\n\nColin and Sarah had two children: Joan Graham (who married Mr. Kenning) and Colin D. Graham, who was a physician.\n\nIsobel Marion Wilson\n\nIsobel Marion Wilson was born in Vancouver on August 14, 1891.\n\nShe went to school for at least two years in Germany.\n\nOn September 27, 1916, in Vancouver, she married Reginald Hibbert Tupper. He was born in Ottawa, Ontario, on October 25, 1893. His father was Charles Hibbert Tupper (1855-1927), who lived at 2050 Barclay Street from 1899 to 1924. Reginald’s mother was Janet Macdonald (1858-1935). Reginald had attended naval colleges, and he had been wounded in the Second Battle of Ypres during the First World War.\n\nReginald later became a well-known lawyer in Vancouver, and he served on the boards of several corporations.\n\nFor a time, there were rumors that Reginald would enter federal politics, possibly in Nova Scotia. He later did become a candidate in North Vancouver in the 1940 federal election, but he was unsuccessful.\n\nHe was a bencher of the Law Society of British Columbia from 1939 to 1962, and the treasurer of the law society in 1950 and 1951. In the mid-1950s, he was the head of a provincial inquiry into police corruption in Vancouver.\n\nIsobel died in Vancouver on April 10, 1969. She was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby, British Columbia.\n\nReginald died in Vancouver on October 14, 1972. He was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby.\n\nReginald and Isobel had two sons: Charles Gordon Hibbert (“Gordon”) Tupper (1918- 1991) and David Wilson Hibbert Tupper (1921-1999).\n\nAnne Alexandrina Wilson\n\nAnne Alexandrina (“Alix”) Wilson was born on May 24, 1897, in Vancouver.\n\nOn June 4, 1919, in Vancouver, she married Blythe DuPuy Rogers. Blythe was born on May 22, 1893, in Vancouver. His parents were Benjamin Tingley Rogers (1865-1918 and Mary Isabella Angus (1869-1965). Benjamin Tingley Rogers was the president of the B.C. Sugar Refining Company.\n\nBlythe had attended the Royal Military College of Canada. He had served as a lieutenant for the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War, although a severe accident caused him to resign. He became the president and general manager of the B.C. Sugar Refining Company in 1918 after his father died. He belonged to the Vancouver Club and the Vancouver Yacht Club.\n\nBlythe died in Vancouver on May 6, 1920.\n\nBlythe and Alix had one child, Mary Elizabeth Angus, who was born on April 9, 1920, in Vancouver. She married Hugh Henderson.\n\nAlix later married Massy Goolden, who was a lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy. He was born on October 1, 1887, in London, England. His father was Edwin R. Goolden.\n\nIn the 1940s, Massy and Alix were living on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. They had a home at Elk Lake, about 10 miles north of Victoria. In 1945, a man kidnapped Alix and her daughters in their house, but they received only minor physical injuries.\n\nIn the 1960s, Massy and Alix became supporters of the Victoria Conservatory of Music. Alix became a member of the Order of Canada in 1977 “In recognition of her role as patroness of numerous community and cultural organizations, particularly the Victoria Conservatory of Music which, in a little more than a decade, has achieved a status, second to none in western Canada.”\n\nMassy died in Saanich, British Columbia, on July 8, 1971.\n\nAlix died in Victoria on August 23, 1988.\n\nThe Alix Goolden Performance Hall in Victoria is named after Alix.\n\nMassy and Alix had a daughter named Gillian Massy Goolden.\n\nRobert Wilson (brother of David Henry Wilson)\n\nOne of David Henry Wilson’s brothers was Robert Wilson (1852-1893), who was a physician.\n\nLike his brother David, Robert Wilson was in an accident with a horse-drawn buggy; unlike David, Robert was seriously injured, and his injuries contributed to his death in 1893.\n\nRobert was married to Mary Isabella Wallace, and they had two children.\n\nTheir son, Robert Wilson, was the father of Wallace Algernon Wilson, a physician who married Ethel Bryant (later known as the novelist Ethel Wilson: see Ethel Wilson; BC Booklook; https://bcbooklook.com/2016/02/02/117-ethel-wilson/).\n\nAnother child of Robert Wilson and Mary Isabella Wallace was Leonora Amelia (“Amy”) Wilson (1889-1982), who married Edward Ernest Buckerfield (1891-1971).\n\nSources\n\nDavid Henry Wilson\n\nDavid Henry Wilson, Canadian Parliamentary Companion, Ottawa, J.

Dr. David Henry Wilson was born in Huntley, not far from Ottawa, Oct. 2, 1855. His early education was received in the public school of his native place. At the age of 16 he entered Pakenham High School. When 18 years of age he was matriculated into Trinity and Toronto Universities and in 1878 graduated, taking the fellowship degree of Trinity Medical College and was medallist of that year. He then practiced his profession for a short time near Ottawa until the rush to Manitoba in 1879, when he went to that province and located at Nelson, subsequently acquiring a large and lucrative practice in Southern Manitoba. He was the first qualified physician south of the Assiniboine and west of the Red River. He was appointed coroner for the province and was the first treasurer of the Dufferin Agricultural Association. On the resignation of the sitting member for North Dufferin he was first returned to the Legislature in August, 1881, and was re-elected at the general election of 1883. In 1882 he got the Conservative nomination for Selkirk in the Commons but declined. He was sworn in a member of the Executive Council and appointed Provincial Secretary April 30, 1884, and on this occasion was elected by acclamation. In September, 1886, he was appointed Minister of Public Works, and was again re-elected by acclamation for the same constituency at the general election of 1886, which office he continued to fill until the change of government in 1888, when he resigned. Shortly afterwards he removed to St. Paul, where he resided for a brief time. In May, 1889, he came to Vancouver, where he has since practiced. Dr. Wilson is a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario and Manitoba, and is a valuable acquisition to the profession of our city.

Before the echoes of the whistle had time to die away there was a crash, then the rapid thud of horse’s hoofs and a trail of dust up the hill leading to the station, as a frightened animal dashed uptown with a buggy, minus one wheel, attached to him.\n\nThe runaway horse belonged to Dr. D.H. Wilson, who was stated in the buggy on the wharf. When the Charmer blew her whistle the horse, which was a restive one, gave a jump. Then things commenced to happen. One of the front wheels broke and the doctor was thrown out on the wharf. He hung on to the reins however and was dragged a short distance before he was forced to let go. Fortunately when he was thrown out, Dr. Wilson did not receive any serious injuries, but he suffered some painful bruises and scratches by being dragged along the planks.\n\nMeanwhile the horse dashed up the hill in record time with the disabled buggy in tow. Reaching the top of the hill, the frightened animal turned up Granville street, but was very neatly caught near Hastings street by Mr. J.A. Johnston, the auctioneer, who was riding a bicycle at the time. He dropped his wheel and made a spring at the horse’s head and hung on despite the fact that the animal finally fell and rolled partly over on him. The horse was badly cut about the hind legs and services of a veterinary surgeon were required to sew up some of the wounds.”\n\nDominion Trust Company Limited, Henderson’s Directory of Vancouver, 1909, page 16: board of directors included D.H.

David Henry Wilson, M.D.\n\nHon. David Henry Wilson, physician, surgeon and legislator, has been an active factor and pioneer in the development of western Canada since 1879. Born in Carleton county, Ontario, October 2, 1855, he graduated from Trinity and Toronto universities in 1878. In the same year he qualified as a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.\n\nAfter practicing his profession for a short time in eastern Canada he removed to Manitoba, a province of confederation recently carved out of the “Great Lone Land.” Entering that province before Winnipeg was in railway communication with the outer world, he located at Nelson, at which time, 1879, he was the only legally qualified practitioner south of Winnipeg and between Red river and the Rocky mountains.\n\nIn 1882 he was elected to the legislature, representing the North Riding of Dufferin county, which constituency he continued to represent while in public life.\n\nIn 1884 he entered the government of Manitoba as provincial secretary and in 1886 was appointed minister of public works, which office he filled till the defeat of the Norquay administration. Retiring from public life at this time, Dr. Wilson resumed the practise of his profession in Vancouver, his present home, in the spring of 1889. A liberal private practice has always been accorded him and he was honored by the profession as the first president of the Vancouver Medical Association. He continued in the active practice of medicine for fifteen years in Vancouver and then retired, enjoying now a well-earned rest. Various business interests and investments, however, have at different times claimed his attention and profited by his energy and sound judgment. He is the president of the Pacific Coast Fire Insurance Company, vice president of the British Columbia Permanent Loan & Savings Company and president of the Royal Plate Glass Insurance Company.\n\nHe took a large part in organizing and laying the foundation of these companies, which today are the oldest and of the very soundest financial institutions of their character in western Canada.\n\nIn politics Dr. Wilson is a conservative, though not in public life since 1887, and he was the first president of the Vancouver and Provincial Conservative Associations of British Columbia. He sat for North Dufferin Manitoba in the local parliament from 1881 until 1888 and while a member of the legislature, amongst other measures, introduced and secured the passage of the bill incorporating the Manitoba Medical College. His service as provincial secretary covered the years from 1884 until 1886, and as minister of public works in Manitoba from 1886 until 1888.\n\nIn January, 1887, Dr. Wilson was married to Miss Annie Armstrong, the daughter of Robert Armstrong of Kinburn, Ontario. They have three daughters. Theirs is one of the beautiful homes of Vancouver, the surroundings being most artistic and indicative of culture and refinement. Dr. Wilson is a member of the Vancouver Club. Few men have more intimate and accurate knowledge of the history of the west, for since pioneer times he has been identified w1th the provinces of Manitoba and British Columbia.

The fact that he was seriously sick was generally known but it was thought that he would pull through. Such was not to be and death ensued at 6:30 on the evening of the Queen’s birthday. Dr. Wilson was born near Ottawa, 41 years ago. He received his preliminary education, following the common school course, at Victoria University, Cobourg, and afterwards graduated from the Toronto School of medicine. For 12 years he practiced his profession at Morden, Man., and during all that time, in fact ever since they graduated, he and his brother, Dr. D.H. Wilson, late Minister of Crown Lands for the Province of Manitoba, have been partners. About a year and a half ago the deceased had the misfortune to have his team run away with him, and at that time he sustained severe injuries, from which it was months before he recovered. After he recovered it was thought that a change of climate would be beneficial, so that the brothers so long united in spirit decided to make a closer business connection, and Bob, as the family affectionately called him, came out to the coast to join with Dave in looking after a practice that had grown far beyond the strength of one man. The change had the desired effect, and until a few days ago Dr. Robert Wilson improved, until he was as hale and hearty a man as could be met on the streets. So pleased was he that he decided to make for himself a permanent home. He therefore purchased a lot and had work started on a residence on the corner of Thurlow and Robson streets. The disease with which he was stricken was inflammation of the bowels and he would have recovered from had it not been followed by a complicatory affection of the parts that had been injured in the accident which has been referred to. Although Dr. Robert Wilson has been for only nine months a citizen of Vancouver, he had many friends, because to know him was to esteem as such. He was kind to the poor, thoughtful in his treatment and genial as an acquaintance. He leaves a wife to whom he was married seven years ago, a boy five years old and a girl three years old to mourn the loss of an affectionate husband and father. The funeral will take place from his brother’s residence, corner of Thurlow and Robson streets, on Friday at 2 p.m., proceeding first to Homer street church, where a service will be held, and thence to the cemetery. The Odd-fellows, of which he was a member, have issued an official call to the members to attend the funeral. As a man he was honest, as a friend he was true, as a father and husband he was kind and no one who knew him ever heard him say an uncharitable word.”\n\n“Death of Dr. Wilson,” Vancouver Daily News-Advertiser, May 26, 1893,page 3:\n\n“After a brief illness, lasting scarcely a week, Mr. Robert Wilson passed away on Wednesday evening about 7 o’clock. The news brought forth expressions of sympathy on all sides, as although Dr. Wilson had only lived here for about nine months, he had made numerous friends, and was one of the most popular physicians in the City. The deceased gentleman was taken ill towards the end of last week with inflammation of the bowels, and it was thought he would pull through, as he improved slightly, but his disease was followed by a complicatory affection resulting from injuries he received eighteen months ago, when thrown from his buggy in Morden, and this caused his death.\n\nDr. Wilson was born near Ottawa in 1852, and received his education at the public school there, and at the Victoria University, Cobourg, after which he graduated at the Toronto School of Medicine. He practiced his profession at Morden, Man., for over twelve years, and came to the Coast about nine months. He leaves a wife and two children, a boy aged five and a girl three years old, for whom much sympathy is felt.\n\nThe funeral will take place this afternoon at 2 o’clock from his brother’s residence at the corner of Robson and Thurlow streets to the Homer Street Methodist Church. The deceased was a member of the I.O.O.F., and that body will attend the funeral.”\n\nRobert Wilson, death notice, Vancouver Daily News-Advertiser, May 26, 1893, page 8; Vancouver Daily World, May 25, 1893, page 4: “Died: Wilson—At his brother’s residence, 1042 Robson street, Vancouver, on the 24th instant, Dr. Robert Wilson, aged 41 years.”\n\n“Dr. Robert Wilson’s Funeral,” Vancouver Daily World, May 26, 1893, page 4.
