        "text": "In one of the early posts to this site (May 2014), I remarked on what now seems to be a companion photo of the one above*. The City Archives (the source of both images) do not identify the central male, adult, figure in the earlier-posted photo. But they do identify him in this image as none other than Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper of the famous Nova Scotia Tuppers. If you are wondering what CHT was doing in Vancouver (inspecting Girl Guides – one of whom was less-than-respectful of Sir Charles ), I’d encourage you to read this excellent, brief biography by P. B. Waite. Waite’s conclusion summarizing the life of Sir Charles is worth reprinting here:\n\nSir Charles Hibbert Tupper had the Tupper courage, the Tupper eloquence, and the family concern for the glory of Tupperdom. He was energetic, talented, quick to seize a point, and almost as quick to take offence. He can be said to have been incorruptible, provided it be understood that with Tupper patronage was politics, not a form of corruption. That was the way political business was done in Canada, then and for a long time to come. Tupper contracted pneumonia in March 1927 and died on the 30th at his home in Vancouver. He was interred in Ocean View Burial Park, Burnaby. Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Vol XV (1921-30). Charles Hibbert Tupper.\n\nHe died at the age of 71.\n\nNotes"
