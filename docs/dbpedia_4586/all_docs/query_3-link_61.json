        "text": "(as at 23rd August 2024)\n\nThe listing below is an abridged version of the manuscript Official Roll of the Baronetage (“the Official Roll”) maintained by the Lord Chancellor in accordance with the Royal Warrant of the 8th February 1910 and a Transfer of Functions Order of 2001.\n\nThis abridged version has been extracted directly from the manuscript folios of the Official Roll and is maintained by the Standing Council of the Baronetage with the authority of the Lord Chancellor.\n\nAs such the entries shown may be taken as being the definitive extract of the Official Roll, which may be relied upon for the purposes of the 1910 Royal Warrant, to determine if an individual should be officially accorded the title and precedence of a baronet.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this abridged version of the Official Roll, there may be errors, or omissions, yet to be identified. In the first instance, any errors or omissions observed should be represented to the Secretary of the Standing Council of the Baronetage (contact details on this website).\n\n2. In order to safeguard the status of holders of Baronetcies, and to prevent the assumption of the title of Baronet by persons who have no right thereto, the Royal Warrant of King Edward VII, dated 8th February 1910, directed that no person whose name is not entered on the Official Roll of Baronets shall be received as a Baronet, or shall be addressed or mentioned by that title in any civil or military Commission, Letters Patent or other official document.\n\nThus, only those named below are entitled to be addressed officially as Baronets.\n\n3. Where the holder of a Baronetcy has died, but where up to 31st December 2023 no person has proved their succession, the Baronetcy is shown as either “Dormant” (Baronet died in 2018 or earlier) or “Vacant” (Baronet died in 2019 or later). All entries made after the publication of the 2023 Roll are shown in red.\n\n4. ‘(Sir)’ indicates that the holder of the Baronetcy has proved his succession, but does not so far as we are aware use the title."
