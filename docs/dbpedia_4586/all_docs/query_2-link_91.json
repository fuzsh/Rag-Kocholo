        "text": "The developer whose workers jackhammered holes in a historic stone wall in Oak Bay says he is committed to building his family home on the site, even in the face of neighbourhood outrage.\n\n“Some people have expressed discomfort with our opening up the driveways,” said Mike Miller, owner of Abstract Developments Inc. “We feel that is a minority, not the majority.”\n\n“We have had quite a lot of support from some neighbours that have reached out to us,” Miller said.\n\nLast week, Abstract workers surprised residents and municipal officials when they showed up at a Miller-owned property to widen driveway openings in a 122-year-old rock wall fronting the lot, which spans 1.7 acres between Prospect Place and York Place.\n\nA small crowd gathered, police were called and municipal officials hurriedly applied a stop-work order. Abstract countered that the order was invalid and the jackhammering continued.\n\nThree hours later, Oak Bay imposed a 60-day temporary protection order, which Abstract agreed to obey. By then, the jackhammering was done, taking out 13 per cent of the wall’s Prospect Place and York Place frontages.\n\nLater, Abstract said it removed portons of the wall because it feared that an expected move by Oak Bay council to enact a new heritage bylaw would restrict its ability to get the building completed. That bylaw has not been enacted.\n\nThe wall once bordered the home of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, a member of Parliament, cabinet minister and son of Father of Confederation Sir Charles Tupper. It is listed on Oak Bay’s heritage registry, but is not legally protected.\n\nThe lot and its wall have been controversial since Miller purchased the property in June 2016. Back then, it was vacant and overgrown, with one disused building, that has since been relocated.\n\nMiller said he wanted to build a home for his family, and create four lots on the property as possible home sites for his children. But neighbours opposed the plan.\n\nPlans subsequently shifted to an eight-home subdivision that would preserve the wall. But though it had community input, that plan won support only among those living on the Prospect Place side, not on York Place. Also, the plan did not accommodate a home for the Miller family.\n\nAfter that, Miller indicated he was bringing back the original plan for a single-family home, for which he has already received municipal approval.\n\nBut the latest move to jackhammer openings in the wall in the face of stop-work order, valid or not, has angered nearby residents and the municipality.\n\nAngus Matthews, one of the three neighbours who helped come up with the eight-home subdivision plan, said he regards the jackhammer action as “petulant” and “impulsive,” and a blatant “abuse of public trust.”\n\n“It was just ‘stick it in your eye, Oak Bay, and stick in your eye, neighbours,’ ” said Matthews.\n\nMiller said he regrets that some people in Oak Bay are feeling betrayed or hurt.\n\nBut he insisted much of the anger directed at him or Abstract is misplaced. “We have kind of been branded as somebody who doesn’t care about heritage and that’s not at all the case,” he said. “If we didn’t value those walls, we would have knocked them down three years ago.”\n\nMiller said he understands that Oak Bay is a community that is passionate about heritage.\n\n“We share a lot of those same views even if we don’t share all the same views.”"
