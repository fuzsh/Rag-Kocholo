        "text": "This week I’ll be doing a style worn by Gabriella Wilde! Wilde played Jade Butterfield in the 2014 Valentine’s Day release Endless Love. I remember their being a ton of hype about this release. The trailer was super intense and cinematic. I saw it on Valentine’s Day… I REALLY wanted to see it. I, personally, loved it. The acting was okay, the actual story is cute, it’s not realistic, but it’s still a decent movie. Well unfortunately, for all of us who loved it, it was slaughtered by critics. On rottentomates it didn’t do well at all. People commented about the acting mostly, saying it was mediocre or sub-par.\n\nThe movie’s storyline followed a young privileged girl and a normal boy the summer after their high school graduation. The boy, David Elliot, has always had a thing for Jade Butterfield and during the summer the two fall head over heels for each other rushing into a romantic love affair. With Jade’s father attempting to keep the two apart and clearly taking the previous loss of one of his son’s out in all sorts of ways he quickly becomes the antagonist of the film. The two lovers fight to be together, so much that Jade turns down an internship in order to spend a few more weeks home with David and David applies to college. All he wants is a happy life but Jade’s father claims that isn’t even in reality. Jade’s father goes to great lengths to end their relationship despite the people cheering for them. The movie is so teen oriented but has a great storyline that everyone can appreciate. Yes, the acting is okay, but it’s just such a cute movie. The scenes are what you daydream about in that Monday night lecture when you’re teacher is talking about who knows what. It’s the ultimate summer love, but does it last? Watch it and find out:)\n\nI would like to mention in spite of all the bad feedback, Gabriella Wilde is very pretty. I believe she’s modeled a ton and is often in scary movies but still, she’s a different kind of pretty. She’s not a generic looking person and I like that about her. I decided to do the style above because I like how it’s different than what most celebrities would wear. She has a younger and fresher look naturally and I think it’s different and her hairstyle reflects that. The look could be formal or everyday. Depending on what you’re wearing and what makeup you decide, it could be worn in any situation. Let’s get this simple look started!\n\nWhat You’ll Need:\n\nflat iron\n\n1 1.4 inch curling iron\n\nhair brush\n\nFirst start with air-dried or blow-dried hair, either one works. This person’s hair is fairly straight to begin with when it’s air-dried so people like this can skip the first few steps. For the people, like me, who don’t have hair that dries like this start right from the beginning.\n\nFirst start by straightening the hair. Section size and what not doesn’t matter much here as long as the top half or top 2/3 of the hair is straight you’ve done a good job. You’re going to want to leave the ends of the hair as they are so they hold the curl better. Repeat this all over the head.\n\nNext you’re going to part the hair down the middle all the way to the nape of the neck. Then grab bigger sections for this look so the curls are looser, like waves, and smooth together with each other better.\n\nThen take the piece and wrap it around the barrel without using the clip. So take the piece and wrap it so it’s away from the face. The pictures below will help. Hold it for about 15 seconds, not too long or they will be too curly.\n\nThey should be more like waves, as shown below. Repeat this throughout the whole head. Be sure to reverse the curls on the other half of the head so your curls don’t look to uniform. This look is meant to look a bit messy.\n\nWhen you’re done with the whole head. You can hit it with hairspray if you’d like and run your fingers through the waves to make the hair look smooth and together. When you’ve done that… YOU’RE DONE! YAY!"
