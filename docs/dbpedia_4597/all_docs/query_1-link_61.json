        "text": "UWTSD alumna wins prestigious Arts and Business Cymru Creative Internship The University is a member of Arts & Business Cymru and each year Arts students all over Wales have the opportunity to apply for a creative internship. Only two are awarded each year, and one of our Swansea College of Art alumna, Gabriella Wilde, has been successful in securing the position this year. The internship is a paid ten-month placement within the Development department of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. Gabriella will be trained by some of the best fundraisers in Wales and will receive mentoring from a senior arts fundraiser and business adviser, in order to aide her development. Caroline Thraves, Academic Director (Art & Media), Wales Institute of Science and Art UWTSD said: “We are delighted that BA and MA Illustration graduate Gabriella Wilde has been selected for this prestigious Arts & Business Cymru Creative Internship. Our Illustration programmes at Swansea College of Art are widely recognized for creating some of the strongest creative talents and Gabriella has demonstrated this through her success. We are confident that this opportunity will help to springboard her creative career.” Steven Kenward Operations Manager at Arts & Business Cymru said: “A&B Cymru is delighted to support Gabriella in her internship. We are confident that her passion, creativity, and drive will help her to become a skilled arts fundraiser. In addition to the expert support provided by the College, we are particularly pleased that one of our key business members, Jamie Falarczyk, Corporate Affairs Manager at Wales & West Utilities, has agreed to mentor Gabriella. This will ensure she gains valuable insight into the private sector and the vital role that corporates play partnering the arts in Wales.” Gabriella was delighted to have won the internship and said: “It was amazing to find out that I had been chosen by Arts and Business Cymru for one of their two internships! As part of the Internship, I am working in the Development team with a focus on Trusts and Foundations, although I am also gaining experience across Individual Giving, Corporate, and Events. The College is full of inspiration, and it’s really exciting to be supporting its emerging talent! Arts and Business Cymru were very accommodating and supportive throughout the interview process, and I am looking forward to working with them over the next ten months.” Gabriella's work can be seen here: https://lnkd.in/e3ur8PyG Applications are currently being invited from students who have completed courses at UWTSD and wish to participate in the 2022-23 scheme.
