        "text": "Gabriella Wilde stands out as an actress who defies expectations. While she comes from a privileged background, she remains humble and does not feel the need to flaunt her blue-blooded heritage.\n\nIndeed, she even chose to adopt a more common name and stray away from the long and formal one she was given at birth. Despite her aristocratic roots, Gabriella Wilde has shown that genuine talent and hard work can open doors in the acting world.\n\nSo, who is Gabriella Wilde?\n\nGabriella Wilde biography\n\nGabriella Wilde is a British actress and model. She was born Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe in 1989 in Hampshire, England.\n\nIn an interview with Hunger TV, she shared her desire to change her name, considering it excessively long and formal. However, her unique name is a reflection of her royal heritage. Wilde comes from the notable Gough-Calthorpe family, known for their ancestral lands in Bermingham, England.\n\nOriginally from Basingstoke, Hampshire, she attended Heathfield St Mary’s School in Berkshire and later St Swithun’s School in Winchester. After completing her education, Wilde pursued her passion for the arts by studying fine art at the City and Guilds of London Art School.\n\nALSO READ: Tom Bateman: Fast-rising actor who’s becoming a heartthrob in the movie world\n\nWilde found herself drawn to the world of acting. She embarked on a career that would showcase her talent and captivate audiences worldwide.\n\nGabriella Wilde career\n\nWilde’s journey into the entertainment industry began at a young age when she was discovered by supermodel Naomi Campbell at 14 years old.\n\nThis fortunate encounter led her to join Premier Model Management, where she kick-started her career as a model. Companies such as Vogue, Burberry, L.K. Bennett, Abercrombie & Fitch and Topshop recognised her talent and featured her in their campaigns. She graced the pages of prestigious magazines like InStyle, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, and Nylon.\n\nIn 2007, Wilde found herself in the spotlight as she was named the second-most-eligible girl in Britain. However, she rejected the excessive media attention and the “IT girl” label that often accompanies such recognition. Instead, she remained focused on her career and continued to hone her craft.\n\nIn December 2009, Wilde decided to explore a new avenue by venturing into acting. She made her acting debut in the adventure comedy film, St Trinian’s 2: The Legend of Fritton’s Gold\n\nHer next significant acting gig came in May 2010 when she appeared in an episode of the popular BBC television series, Doctor Who. In the episode titled: The Vampires of Venice, she portrayed one of the eponymous vampires.\n\nLater that year, Wilde secured her first major film role in the adventure film, The Three Musketeers. Starring alongside renowned actors Orlando Bloom and Logan Lerman, Wilde played the role of “Constance Bonacieux”, the queen’s lady-in-waiting. In 2012, she was cast in the ABC Sci-Fi television pilot, Dark Horse, a series centred around a science student chosen to battle the forces of evil. The pilot, however, did not get picked up for a full season.\n\nWilde continued to explore various acting opportunities. She starred in the short film, II Maestro, and also featured in another project titled: Squatters. Additionally, she landed a role in the 2013 remake of Carrie, which also featured Chloë Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore.\n\nIn 2014, the model-cum-actress was cast in the second film adaptation of Scott Spencer’s novel, Endless Love. The following year, she joined the cast of the BBC drama series, Poldark, and portrayed the character “Caroline Penvenen” from 2015 to 2019.\n\nIn 2015, she became the face of Estée Lauder, joining the prestigious brand as their brand ambassador.\n\nGabriella Wilde movies\n\nWilde has been featured in several movies.

She comes from a family with a notable lineage. She is a descendant of the aristocratic Gough-Calthorpe family.\n\nHer father, John Austen Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, has a background in business and previously held the position of chairman at the Watermark Group. He is the grandson of Baronet Fitzroy Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe.\n\nOn the other hand, her mother, Vanessa Mary Theresa (née Hubbard), was previously married to socialite Sir Dai Llewellyn, fourth Baronet. Vanessa herself has a history in the modelling industry and has been photographed by renowned photographers like David Bailey and John Swannell.\n\nThrough her maternal grandfather, Wilde can trace her ancestry back to Montagu Bertie, the sixth Earl of Abingdon, and General Hon. Thomas Gage. Her maternal grandmother’s parents were peers Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, the third Baron Howard of Glossop, and Mona Fitzalan-Howard, 11th Baroness Beaumont. This rich lineage connects her to a long-standing history of notable figures.\n\nIn terms of siblings, Wilde has a younger sister named Octavia. Additionally, she has five half-siblings: Olivia and Arabella from her mother’s first marriage, and Georgiana, Isabella, and Jacobi from her father’s first marriage to Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon. It is worth noting that Isabella and Olivia are also involved in the world of acting, continuing the family’s connection to the entertainment industry.\n\nFurthermore, Wilde shares a unique bond with her “unofficial stepsisters”: Pandora Cooper-Key and Cressida Bonas, who are Lady Mary-Gaye’s other daughters.\n\nWilde’s family background showcases a blend of aristocracy, business and artistic pursuits. With her lineage spanning generations and encompassing individuals from various fields, it is clear that she comes from a diverse and accomplished family.\n\nGabriella Wilde age\n\nWilde was born on April 8, 1989. She is currently 34 years old.\n\nGabriella Wilde now\n\nThese days, Gabriella Wilde is happily married to musician Alan Pownal. The couple resides in Somerset, where they have built a life together with their three sons: Sasha Blue, Shiloh Silva, and Skye. Choosing to raise their children in the countryside, Wilde and Alan provide them with a childhood reminiscent of her own, filled with outdoor adventures and the simple joys of nature.\n\nThe actress has spoken about her desire to give her children a similar upbringing to her own, cherishing the memories of her youth spent running around with her younger sister and five half-siblings.\n\nHowever, life is not always smooth sailing, and even celebrities face challenges. Recently, Wilde faced a worrisome incident when her youngest son fell ill with a mysterious sickness and required medical attention. Skye was rushed to the Royal United Hospital Bath, an NHS-run facility in Somerset, where he received treatment from healthcare professionals. Thankfully, the young boy was saved and is back on his feet.\n\nIn an Instagram post that has since been deleted, Wilde shared a heartfelt photo of her son lying in a hospital bed, wrapped up in sheets.\n\nShe captioned the photo, saying: “Earlier this week my darling Skye was being cared for by the incredible team of doctors and nurses @ruhbath hospital. I am so deeply grateful to all of those angels who looked after him and I with such grace and care. Thank you thank you thank you for everything you do and all the sacrifices you make to take care of and heal others.\n\n“I am so grateful to live in a country with national health care. It is something we must NEVER take for granted. Skye is now well and home playing with his brothers.”"
