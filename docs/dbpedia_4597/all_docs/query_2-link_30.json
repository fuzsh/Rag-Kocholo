        "text": "With Cold Feet returning to screens this week, the old faces are back — but so are some (seriously talented) new ones. Meet Devon-born Ella Hunt, the ITV comedy’s 18-year-old star. Playing the flirtatious daughter of long-running characters Karen (Spooks’ Hermione Norris) and David (Robert Bathurst), it’s the big break she’s been waiting for ever since an agent spotted her, dressed in a fat suit, in a school production of The Mikado. ‘I didn’t go to drama school but I’ve worked since I was 11,’ (her first professional role was in a commercial for Netflix). Off screen, she loves hanging out in Covent Garden and listening to jazz with friends. Next, she appears in ITV’s 1960s crime drama, Endeavour. The role saw her don miniskirts and platforms but in real life she’s lowermaintenance. ‘I’d love to say that I had lots of Burberry and Vivienne Westwood, but my wardrobe’s mostly Topshop.\n\nPrepare for the new Joanna Vanderham. Born in Scone in Scotland and now an east Londoner, Vanderham built her name in period pieces The Paradise (2012) and The Go-Between (2015), and on stage as Desdemona in the RSC’s Othello in 2015 and Lady Anne in Richard III this year. Now she’s out of the corsets and delivering the tension in BBC One’s mystery One Of Us, as emotionally conflicted medic Claire. ‘Moving from period [drama] was scary — but I love The Fall and Luther, so when I read this script it was just a “yes”.’ Her career highlight to date? Working with Vanessa Redgrave, her Go-Between co-star, is definitely up there. ‘She doesn’t suffer fools. At our first rehearsal I wasn’t prepared in terms of character background — and she let me know it.’ By the end of filming, though, they’d become firm friends. ‘She’s incredibly naughty.’\n\nIt’s not easy being the new girl on the Cornish cliffs, but Gabriella Wilde has already proven herself as a force to be reckoned with in the second series of Poldark, playing spirited heiress Caroline. With her own links to high society — she is related to the aristocratic Gough-Calthorpe family through her businessman father John — the 27-year-old brings the perfect blend of sugar and spite to the part. ‘Caroline’s a feminist of her time: the way she is with men is very modern; you don’t know you’ve been insulted until she’s walked away.’ Having impressed on the big screen in Carrie (playing popular high-schooler Sue Snell) and lovestruck teen Jade in Endless Love, the ITV blockbuster is set to turn her into a household name. Forbidden love is on the cards for Caroline but viewers have also fallen for her on-screen sidekick, Horace the pug. ‘He’s a seasoned pro,’ laughs Wilde. Talk about a dream double act.\n\nAlex Lawther has already conquered the stage with roles in David Hare’s public school-set hit South Downs, which debuted in 2011 at the Chichester Festival Theatre, and as the disruptive youth Jamie in 2014’s The Glass Supper at The Hampstead Theatre. Now the 21-year-old is making the silver screen his own. Having played a young Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, you’ll soon see him in Freak Show, directed by Trudie Styler. The film sees Lawther take the role of pioneering teenage boy Billy Bloom, who chooses to run for the title of Homecoming Queen at an American high school, with the help of his mother, played by Bette Midler. ‘She is the funniest person in the room. There are some really dark moments in the film but when they would say “cut” she could get everyone laughing.’ At home in south London, he’s a Sally Hawkins super-fan who’s just wrapped on Old Boys, a big-screen reworking of the French classic play Cyrano de Bergerac, with Lawther playing an awkward teenager helping a friend seduce a crush.\n\nAs a child, Malachi Kirby was so shy his mother enrolled him in classes at the Battersea Arts Centre. They paid off. After appearing alongside Star Wars’ John Boyega in the 2012 gang drama My Murder, the 26-year-old landed the integral role of Gambian slave Kunta Kinte in the History Channel’s blockbuster remake of 1977’s Roots. Filmed on location in South Africa and Louisiana, Kirby’s role saw him battle extreme heat, rain and mosquitoes alongside Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Laurence Fishburne. This autumn, he returns to our screens in Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror. ‘I love the show so much that I hesitated to be a part of it because I didn’t want to miss watching it as a viewer,’ he laughs. Next he’ll be seen on the big screen as Roland in Fallen, a Twilight-esque supernatural romance that sees a high-school girl fall in love with an angel.\n\nWhat’s a budding actress in a country with a minimal film industry to do? Move to London. Letitia Wright, 22, was born in Guyana and made the journey to Tottenham with her mother, a teacher, when she was a child. ‘I watched BBC News just to hear the British accent. It just seeped into my brain.’ The star of forthcoming film Urban Hymns, out next month and based around the 2011 London riots, she’s just finished filming on Ready Player One, Steven Spielberg’s latest sci-fi adventure alongside Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance. ‘When Spielberg calls, you don’t say no. He came up to me, and I was like, “What? Why are you talking to me!?” But he’s a normal person. Just a master at what he does.’ You’ll find Wright in the next series of Channel 4’s sci-fi hit Humans — ‘I can’t tell you anything!’ — but before then, keep an eye out for her on the South Bank where she might be spotted on her cruiser skateboard.\n\nGrowing up in Docklands, Ella Purnell took classes at Sylvia Young Theatre School but got her real education through imitation, playing the young versions of Keira Knightley, Angelina Jolie and Margot Robbie in Never Let Me Go, Maleficent and Tarzan. ‘Saying to Keira or Margot, “Teach me how to be you”, was like my drama school,’ she jokes. But the 19-year-old was a rare adult on the set of Tim Burton’s new film Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children, in which she plays Emma Bloom, a girl with supernatural powers, alongside Eva Green, Asa Butterfield and dozens of energetic children. ‘Me, Asa and Eva would be lagging, but the kids would come in like a breath of fresh air.’ Next, see her in the bigscreen biopic Churchill. And after that, the West End Stage — she hopes. She’d love to be in Cats.\n\nGrowing up in Swansea, Alexander Vlahos was bitten by the showbiz bug after a set tour of soap opera Pobol y Cwm. Trained at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and now settled in Stoke Newington, Vlahos, 28, mixes TV with theatre. He gave a master class in brooding glances in this year’s decadent romp Versailles and was Malcolm to Kenneth Branagh’s Macbeth in New York in 2014. But there’s still one role he longs to play. ‘I’m always going to throw my name out there for Doctor Who.’ With a second series of Versailles in the pipeline he’s also got a wedding to plan with his fiancée, model Kajsa Mohammar. ‘People ask why I don’t just get married at Versailles. But I don’t think I can just show up.’\n\nNorwich boy turned Streatham convert Sam Clemmett beat hundreds to bag the leading role of Albus Severus Potter, son of Harry Potter and his wife Ginny, in the Palace Theatre’s sold out blockbuster Harry Potter and The Cursed Child. The show features time travel, family drama and dazzling onstage tricks to bring JK Rowling’s magical realm to life — but it all started with an impression for the 22-year-old. ‘When I was eight I loved getting up and clowning around, so I was asked to play Simon Cowell in a school play. I remember being given these high-waisted trousers and hoisting them up. I guess that’s where the bug came from: Simon Cowell.’ From there, it was on to the National Youth Theatre and a part in Lord of The Flies at the Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre back in 2011 followed by a role in the RSC’s Peter and Wendy last year as Wendy’s late brother Tom. Clemmett dreams of working with Cillian Murphy (‘I love Peaky Blinders’) or Mark Rylance (‘just one scene would be a dream come true’). But with hopes for a Broadway transfer of Cursed Child in mind, who knows when the boy wizard will have the time.\n\nIt might have been called Jesus Christ Superstar, but for this summer’s sold-out run at the Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre, it was Tyrone Huntley’s electrifying Judas that stole the show. His soaring vocals proved perfect for the role in Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s beloved biblical work. ‘They were so young when they wrote it, but it’s absolutely genius. The fact that we’re still discovering new layers to it, 45 years later, is amazing.’ Next the Dulwich-based 26-year-old, who went straight from Wood Green’s Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts to roles in Sister Act the musical in 2011 and The Book of Mormon in 2013, will be making his mother proud with a part in Dreamgirls, at the Savoy Theatre in November. ‘“And I Am Telling You” was my mum’s favourite song growing up. It’s always been in my life. And I was blown away by Jennifer Hudson in the film.’\n\nMorfydd Clark crossed the Welsh border two years ago to begin an impressive career on the stage in Violence and Son at the Royal Court, but she’s managed to find a slice of home at the flat she shares with friends in Elephant and Castle. ‘It feels Cardiffy somehow. Just the busy-ness of it.’ Having played the perfect Cécile in Les Liaisons Dangereuses alongside Dominic West (‘hilarious’) at the Donmar Warehouse earlier this year, in October she’ll play Cordelia to Glenda Jackson’s King Lear at The Old Vic. ‘I knew her work as a politician, and I knew she’d been an actress. You can tell from her speeches: she demanded attention. My grandfather loves her.’"
