        "text": "With shooting set to get underway sharpish for Kimberly Peirce's new Carrie, the cast is starting to fill out around Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore. The news just in is that Gabriella Wilde has officially signed on as Sue Snell, while Judy Greer also seems likely to co-star as Miss Collins.\n\nSue is the role played by Amy Irving in the Brian De Palma film: a rare ally for Carrie - though hardly a best mate - at the horrible Bates High School. Wilde is a relative newcomer, although she's no stranger to horror, having appeared in Paul WS Anderson's Three Musketeers last year. She was also in St Trinian's 2, and in the 2010 Doctor Who episode The Vampires of Venice.\n\nMiss Collins is another sympathetic character, the gym teacher concerned about Carrie's welfare (although she actually makes Carrie's life worse by phoning the crazy Mrs White with some gory details). A great fit for the role, and more evidence of how promising this film is looking, Greer is a talented character actress, most recently seen being really impressive in The Descendents and Jeff Who Lives At Home.\n\nNext to be cast, then, should be Carrie's nemesis Chris Hargensen, the Nancy Allen character from last time (or last time that counts). Early word that Pan's Labyrinth's Ivana Baquero had the role turned out not to be true; she doesn't. Expect reports of who will be playing the \"sexy bad girl\" shortly."
