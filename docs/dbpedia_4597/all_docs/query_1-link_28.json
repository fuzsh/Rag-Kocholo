        "text": "Ultimately derived from the Hebrew name Gavri’el — which then became the more-familiar Gabriel — this name, Gabriel's feminine form, means \"God gives strength\". The French version, Gabrielle, reigned supreme during the 1990s, reaching the top 100 most popular baby names. But its Italian version, Gabriella, has surpassed Gabrielle's popularity during the 2000s.\n\nGabriella didn't enter the top 1000 most popular girl names until 1974, and even then it hovered near the bottom at #995. But between 1984 and 1985 it jumped an astonishing 218 spots to #736 ... and continued to rise for decades, topping out at #33 before seeing a gentle decline. But as of last count, it's still in the top 90!\n\nOne of the best things about Gabriella is its versatility. It can be used in its full form for occasions when a more formal name fits the bill — but its nicknames, such as Gabby (or Gabi), Ella, Brie, and Briella, lend various casual vibes.\n\nNotable Gabriellas include Princess Gabriella of Monaco; gymnast Gabriella \"Gabby\" Douglas; actress Gabriella Wilde.\n\nGabriella in quotes:\n\n\"Gabriella, you are a force to be reckoned with. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\" - Ms. Jenn, from the TV show 'Glee'\n\n\"Gabriella, you are the strongest person I know. You never give up, even when things are tough.\" - Ms. Darbus, from the movie 'High School Musical'"
