        "text": "Buried among the film credits on Gabriella Wilde’s IMDB Web page is an item that seems appropriate more for Burke’s Peerage than for a film-trade site: “Paternal granddaughter of the 2nd Baronet Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe and a descendant of Charles II, King of England, Ireland and Scotland, in turn twice great-great-great grandson of Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII, and of Joan the Mad, sister of Catherine of Aragon,” it reads, just below the 24-year-old actress and model’s birth name, Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. Wilde is the daughter of the British businessman John Austen Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, and her luminous blonde-ingénue looks have helped her land a string of high-profile roles that are reprises of parts played by some of the most accomplished stars of the past. Her breakout was as Constance in the 2011 remake of The Three Musketeers, the role played by June Allyson in the 1948, Gene Kelly version. In last year’s remake of Carrie, she re-created the part of Sue Snell, Carrie’s tormentor—Amy Irving in the 1976, Brian De Palma version. This month, in a new rendering of Franco Zeffirelli’s 1981 Endless Love, she walks in the footsteps of Brooke Shields as Jade Butterfield, playing opposite Alex Pettyfer. Wilde, who was discovered at 14 by Naomi Campbell, says that the explicit sex sequences in Endless Love don’t push the envelope quite the way they did in Zeffirelli’s version. “This film is tamer,” she says. “Still, it is an intimidating thing. The fact that the director is a woman”—Shana Feste, who previously directed Country Strong—“helped calm me down for the big moments.” Wilde, who is expecting a baby with her fiancé, Alan Pownall, of the band Pale, says she wants to get away from playing American teenage roles. “My only experience with American things is through movies,” she says. “I had to pick up the nuances from the other actors, so after two studio films I’d like to graduate from high-school parts, and maybe even try an independent film.”\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Mad Dash to Make 2024 Debates Happen\n\nThe emergence of the Kamala Harris–Tim Walz ticket, and Donald Trump’s flip-flopping on a planned ABC debate, have sent the networks and campaigns back to the drawing board. As one TV exec puts it, “The fall schedule is a blank piece of paper now.”\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry’s Calls to King Charles “Go Unanswered”\n\nThe monarch is reportedly no longer speaking to his younger son over Harry’s ongoing battle to secure enhanced security when he visits the UK.\n\nAward Season\n\nNatasha Lyonne, Elizabeth Olsen, and Carrie Coon Hold Nothing Back in the Wrenching His Three Daughters\n\nThe three stars exclusively share the trailer for their widely acclaimed Netflix drama, and go deep on their vulnerable powerhouse performances: “I let go so completely.”\n\nMovies\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Writing a Memoir Because She’s “Mad as Hell”\n\nIn a statement to People, Minnelli expressed disappointment with other representations of her life and revealed that she’s releasing a memoir set to hit stands in spring of 2026: “It’s my own damn story.”\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nRoyals\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla to Visit Australia in First Royal Tour Since Cancer Diagnosis\n\nIt will be Charles’s first visit to the Commonwealth realm since he ascended the throne.\n\nNews\n\nThe 1992 Republican Convention Jump-Started the Culture Wars—and the GOP’s Prime-Time Extremism\n\nIn an excerpt of his book The Naughty Nineties, David Friend recounts the partisan political battle America has been fighting for three decades, beginning with Pat Buchanan and George H.W. Bush in Houston.\n\nRoyals\n\nHow Kate Middleton Became the Future of the Monarchy\n\nAfter best-laid plans gave way to her difficult cancer diagnosis, the Princess of Wales has reemerged to a whole new public admiration.\n\nMovies\n\nAmy Adams Hears the Call of the Wild in Nightbitch\n\n“When people ask me what the movie is about, I’m like, ‘It’s about motherhood and rage,’” says director Marielle Heller in this exclusive first look. “And you either get that or you don’t.”\n\nTelevision\n\nWho Won the House of the Dragon Season 2 Finale?\n\nRival factions prepare for war as Alicent and Rhaenyra attempt once again to broker peace. But that compromise comes at a high price for one of the queens."
