        "text": "After the HCU I've been experimenting with other sources of traffic for my website. Many marketers have been creating Reddit forums and sharing articles on here, but there's another traffic source you might not know about yet, Flipboard. You can create your own magazines on Flipboard and share your own articles as well as other publishers' articles there. Several of the large financial publishers that lost a lot of traffic during the HCU have also been sharing their articles on Flipboard and they have branded magazines on there as well. But I still think I can compete with them because their backlinks and domain authority don't help them on that site. Brands still count, but some financial publishers with high domain authority have weak brands. It's also much more important to have high-quality, unique pictures on Flipboard and I have unique photos while most of the competing sites have stock photos. While the platform is aimed at readers, you still need good photos to get readers' attention on there. Here's a link to my Flipboard profile: https://lnkd.in/gjimnJ6R\n\nUSC was hard. Especially as a first-generation student from South Central LA. During my undergrad, I burnt out so much. As a first-generation college student, I found myself often scatter-brained and lost on what it means to advance forward in my school and personal career. Over time, I started to learn how to maintain my work-life balance and graduate from USC's Iovine and Young Academy where I studied Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. Here are some pieces of advice that I have for rising first-gen students that I wish I knew. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Consistency goes a long way Creating consistency wherever you are helps with being present and serves as a good checkin time. For me, I had a nightly journaling, I would make myself breakfast everyday and practice music on the weekends. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Don't knock it unless you try Growing up, I can't tell you how many times I never would see myself doing music, partially because I never thought of myself as musically creative. When I got to USC, I joined the USC Trojan Marching Band and decided to pickup the tenor saxophone with NO prior music experience. Looking back on it, the marching band was one of the most unique and amazing experiences I've ever had. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Learn to be a host What I mean by being a host is don't be afraid to bring people together. Whether it is for a game night, a social gathering or an activity, by being a host I started to learn more about myself as a person and build strong community. I didn't know how to do everything from the first time, I joined existing organizations like Trojan Knights and Spark SC where I learned and then practiced doing it myself. Feel that your work-life balance needs help? I am currently building the Gen-1 platform with Asarel Castellanos and Elmer Vasquez to help with managing your calendar so you can confidently succeed in your undergrad.

Background from TI: After careful consideration, the Board of Directors decided that, beginning with the 2024-2025 speech contest cycle, there will no longer be exceptions granted to the Speech Contest Rulebook to allow for online or hybrid contests. This means that all contests past the club level must be conducted fully in person and adhere to the Speech Contest Rulebook, 2. Eligibility, C.11, which currently states: Each contestant must be physically present to compete beyond the club level. Participation by audio, video, or other remote technology is not permitted beyond the club level. (Exceptions: participants in the International Speech Contest Region Quarterfinals and Video Speech Contest.) This will offer a more consistent experience for contestants, while supporting judges in clear, accurate, and unbiased judging. Additionally, District resources that may have been focused on hybrid contests can be allocated to building clubs and supporting club success. To provide members with the option to practice competitive speaking in an online setting, a new contest type will be added. The Online Speech Contest will be a contest type similar to Evaluation, Humorous, Table Topics, and Tall Tales that can be selected by Districts. This contest type will be conducted fully online, will follow the rules of the International Speech Contest (insofar as practical), and will not proceed past the District level.
