        "text": "Remember \"Order Of The Seven\"? Well, if you don't, it was the Disney Snow White re-imagining that was developing for years until two other movies came along — \"Mirror, Mirror\" and \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" — and took the wind out of its sail. Unsurprisingly, the studio ended up scrapping the project that had Saoirse Ronan set to lead, but now it looks like she'll get another shot at a Disney reboot.\n\nThe actress is in the running alongside Alicia Vikander and Gabriella Wilde for the title role in Mark Romanek's \"Cinderella.\" The project recently landed Cate Blanchett to play the evil stepmother, and now one of these three may take on the role opposite her. Variety says that Blanchett had also been linked to \"Order Of The Seven,\" so this would be an odd \"re-teaming\" of sorts if Ronan were to get the role (not to mention they were foes in \"Hanna\" as well). And indeed, of all the candidates, she's the most experienced and best known, and certainly after \"The Host\" next spring, her stock will be on the rise even further. But scheduling with many of her upcoming projects, including Wes Anderson's \"Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"Mary Queen Of Scots\" could be an issue.\n\nVikander is absolutely great in \"Anna Karenina,\" she's also in the Danish Oscar foreign language contender \"A Royal Affair\" and has the big budget \"The Seventh Son\" with Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore coming next fall. Meanwhile, Wilde has a bit of a lower profile, featuring in \"The Three Musketeers\" and in next spring's \"Carrie.\" So who has the best shot? Well, it's anyone's guess. Maybe the studio will roll the dice on an unknown like they did for Mia Wasikowska for \"Alice In Wonderland,\" or get someone more seasoned to play against Blanchett. But clearly, they're exploring all their options.\n\nNo word yet on when this might roll — it doesn't have a release date yet — but it seems the studio is eager to put the pieces together. What are your thoughts? Do these girls fit the glass slipper or do you want to see someone else try it on for size?"
