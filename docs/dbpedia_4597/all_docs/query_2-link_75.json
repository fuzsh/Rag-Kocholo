        "text": "Brenton Thwaites confirmed\n\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/pirates-caribbean-5-brenton-thwaites-4985554\n\n'Australian actor Brenton Thwaites has confirmed he will star in the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales.\n\nThe Giver star, 25, says he isn't sure about the exact plot details, but it was previously confirmed that Johnny Depp will reprise his role as charismatic swashbuckler Captain Jack Sparrow. Original Pirates star Orlando Bloom is also rumoured to return.\n\n\"I think that is going to be happening. I don’t know much about the story, they’re quite tight about that stuff,\" Thwaites exclusively told Mirror TV. \"I’m heading back to Australia to begin [pre-production] in a month.\"\n\nThe fifth Pirates film, which follows on from 2011's On Stranger Tides, will be directed by Kon-Tiki filmmakers Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg.'\n\nI just want to say that I'm really happy this thread exists. The Pirate films are some of my favorite cinema experiences. I have a lot memories about going to see them. A great adventure where you can have fun on the ride. The music is amazing, it always gets you in a good mood. These films always leave me feeling happy. There are films for different occasions, and Pirates is one of those that reminds you of the great adventure of cinema that only exists in fantasy.\n\nBesides from Spectre, Pirates 5 is one of my most anticipated upcoming films. I have been waiting since the last one. Following up on every news. I'm really looking forward to seeing it being filmed. When they delayed it the first two times I got sad. But, I knew they wanted to take time to get it right. I hope the did. Because if the delay it again I'll literary go the studio and tell them to give me the script right now so, I'll make it.\n\nLet's hope for some fresh news on the cast soon.\n\nInteresting quote from Brenton Thwaites. Read at your own risk, since it may include spoilers for his character.\n\nhttp://screenrant.com/pirates-caribbean-5-casting-brenton-thwaites-kaya-scodelario/\n\nI'm happy with what he said. Bringing things back to its roots.\n\nI'm very wary of this quote as in an early article I read when Thwaites announced the confirmation it didn't use this as a quote but as a statement made by the article writer. I'm not sure what to believe.\n\nPart of me thinks I'm putting this quote to the back of my mind cause I really don't want them to return to the story from the Dead Man's Chest/ At World's End unless it's more of a backstory than a plot device.\n\nAlso, I really don't want Orlando Bloom in this film. Like one of the guys in this video says: \"The cursed dad scenario has been done!\"\n\nI'm all for connections and subplots from previous films. I just hope they don't contradict what has happened or become the major story. I want to see Jack Sparrow on a new adventure. Explore places with different mythologies. OST made me think that it was the right direction with introducing the fountain, mermaids and so forth. Keep exploring the worlds.\n\nFor me it's fine to have Orlando back in a supporting role. Let's not have the whole \"Elizabeth!\" thingy with the romance again, since that part should be over. They are both established now, so if anyone of them is back, take them to the next level.\n\nAs a question to all, looking at all the rumours that have come out about Pirates of the Caribbean 5, what ones do we think are actually true since production could have changed so much over the amount of time they've on it:\n\n- Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (Is it definitely going to be called that? No-one's really announced anything about the title.)\n\n- Javier Bardem/ Christoph Waltz - We all know Waltz won't be appearing but I thought I'd stick him in here anyway cause he was rumoured, but we all now know he'll be in Spectre. But is Bardem really going to be in the film?\n\n- Kaya Scodelario - This seems like the most true rumour cause it seems like more of an actual \"we are definitely considering her\" than just word of mouth and what people think they've heard.\n\n- No monsters, just pirates. - In an interview with Collider, producer Jerry Bruckheimer was asked if there will be \"demonic monsters\" in the fifth film. Here was his response: \"No, no. I think we're back to more of a straight pirates movie this time.\" Has that stuck since we learnt this. Also if they're talking about no monsters then the whole witches idea must have been scrapped.\n\n- Captain Brand - Is the villain gonna be Captain Brand, Captain Brand, a ghost that wants the Trident so he can get his revenge on Jack. Brand believes Jack turned his brother Eric into a pirate, which led to his death.\n\nWhat do you think is true? Do you think some things are maybe similar but changed? Would like to see changes made to these rumours if they are true or not?"
