        "text": "She’s rich, he’s not. They’ve known each other for four years, yet they’ve never met. She wants a party and he’s invited. Her red dress excites him and the way she dances, like something out of her ballet recital, makes him crazy. He’s wanted to kiss her since tenth grade. Women Who Wow Wednesday celebrates Jade Butterfield, the free spirited beauty from the movie Endless Love.\n\nThroughout high school, she lived an invisible life. She didn’t have many friends. Her brother was the only person who cared what happened to her. When David (Alex Pettyfer) comes along, she has all she can do to resist the urge to be with him. How can a girl resist David’s interpretation of love?\n\n“I think love comes first. At the end of the day, what’s more important than that? You know, I’ve seen it firsthand. I know what it’s like when it’s there, and know what it’s like when it’s not. That’s what I wanna find. True love. The kind that you fight for, that you always put first. That makes you wanna be good and do better. And not just with any girl. But ‘the’ girl. And when I find that, that’s all I need.”\n\nThey have two weeks together. Summer.\n\nJade (Gabriella Wilde) doesn’t have to put a mask on with David. She can enjoy shows, theater and dance with him. No one has ever come into her life before to make her feel so free. She’s always had someone control her life, whether it was her father or someone else. Real freedom comes to Jade being in love with David.\n\nThe realization sets in of how sheltered Jade was growing up. Her new motto becomes, “Let’s be young and dumb.” She has an awakening that sparks something in her to bring her to life.\n\nHer father, though, believes David is not right for his daughter. He can’t accept the fact that Jade’s in love with him. He will do anything to keep her and David apart, including digging into his past for anything that he can use against his daughter’s boyfriend.\n\nUltimately, Jade’s father doesn’t believe David’s good enough for his daughter.\n\nFrom there, things get complicated.\n\nLove is worth fighting for. It is. Jade can’t move on without David, even if she has another guy pining for her affection. No matter what anyone says, she will always be his. No one can control what she feels, how she thinks. No one. How does she feel?\n\n“My first love was everything all at once. The kind you never fall back from. Never try to. Never want to. A love so big, so strong, it never dies, never fades, never loses its electricity. The kind of love you fight for.”\n\nIf anything’s certain about Jade, she’s her own person and lives a full life without anyone telling her what to do.\n\nRANGER MARTIN AND THE ALIEN INVASION, on sale October 21."
