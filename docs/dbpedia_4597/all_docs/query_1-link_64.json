        "text": "With Dwight being away, Ross and Demelza take Caroline in, they look after her and it is really nice for her, to have friends.\n\n— Gabriella Wilde\n\n\"There is a lot of loss for Caroline this series, she loses her uncle and she begins to believe she has also lost her husband, Dwight Enys (Luke Norris) too when he goes missing in France. So whilst she is struggling with the grief of her loss, she is fearful that it may soon be two fold.\n\n\"Through that she really develops her relationship with Ross (Aidan Turner) and Demelza (Eleanor Tomlinson) and cements herself within society in Cornwall becoming very much a part of that world. With the sadness Caroline endures throughout the series we see her grow up a lot.\"\n\nGabriella has enjoyed developing Caroline’s relationships with different characters this series and specifically, her friendship with Demelza.\n\n\"With Dwight being away, Ross and Demelza take Caroline in, they look after her and it is really nice for her, to have friends.\n\n\"In the last series she didn’t really have interactions with female characters, she didn’t have any female friends or a mother or sisters and she was living in this male environment, which, I think, was why she was so sharp. However, in this series Caroline’s relationship with Demelza really develops and the kinship they share, although they are so different, is really lovely and has been a joy to play out.\"\n\nWhilst her friendship with Demelza strengthens, Caroline’s relationship with Dwight is tested more than ever.\n\n\"Their relationship is a huge rollercoaster this series. At the start it was all very young much love whereas now it is more about their marriage and having to face very tough obstacles.\n\n\"When Dwight finally returns home, he may return physically but he struggles to come home mentally. Caroline is dealing with Dwight’s severe post traumatic stress disorder and she is feeling very rejected by him. That is something she has never really experienced before, let alone from the man she loves and has just married. She is in Cornwall and has just lost her uncle and so it is quite frightening for her at this moment and she loses some of her naivety through that. It is a very turbulent journey this series for her and for their relationship.\"\n\nWhilst her character was going through a tumultuous period, Gabriella had to shake off Caroline’s emotions rather swiftly.\n\n\"As I had my baby boy on set with me I had to be able to drop my character’s emotions hour by hour rather than carrying Caroline with me.\n\n\"It is always hard and weird doing the big dramatic scenes and then running to feed my son, having to constantly switch in and out of it but you just learn as it goes along.\n\n\"It was a bizarre first six months of his life but it was amazing to be able to be a working mother and have my son with me, it was a luxury that I was very lucky to have.\"\n\nGabriella reveals what it is about Caroline that makes her such an enjoyable character to return to.\n\n\"Caroline isn’t your standard female character, especially for a period drama as she is punchy and bright and very quick witted. Caroline doesn’t fit the mould of her initial character breakdown; a rich heiress in the 18th Century, as like Demelza, she is incredibly strong but in a very different way.\n\n\"Poldark has very strong female characters that are written in a very clever way. Caroline doesn’t have to be so tough all of the time, she is bright and frustrated by her position but at the same time she also enjoys it which is quite real and refreshing. She doesn’t have to be this hardened woman to be a strong woman, she is still young and naïve and joyful in lots of ways but will also not be told what to do.\"\n\nGabriella reveals what she believes to be the secret to Poldark’s success.\n\n\"Poldark’s popularity comes initially from the stories, the brilliant writing as there is something about Poldark that is quite current. Whilst it is a period drama the themes that run through it are relevant. You get that Sunday night escapism but it also touches a sensitivity in people at the moment.\"\n\nCharacter descriptions\n\nRoss Poldark (Aidan Turner)\n\nRoss attempts to deny his nature and isolate himself from the affairs of others but, with the stakes now higher than ever, he must find a compromise between what he wants and the needs of those who depend on him.\n\nDemelza Poldark (Eleanor Tomlinson)\n\nDemelza decides she will no longer be passive in her own life but, in learning to be her own master, she must determine what she truly wants for herself and how far she’s prepared to go for it…\n\nGeorge Warleggan (Jack Farthing)\n\nNo longer content to lord over Truro through finance alone, George finds new worlds and opportunities opening to him, but the obstacles he faces turn his journey of ambition into one of discovery on several fronts.\n\nElizabeth Warleggan (Heida Reed)\n\nContrary to her expectations, Elizabeth finds herself once again navigating a world of uncertainties and guarding a grave secret. She comes to learn, however, that she wields far more power than she’d previously realised…\n\nDwight Enys (Luke Norris)\n\nA man of integrity and compassion, Dwight finds himself pushed to his limits by the war with France, battling not only the French but his own demons and the doubts they rouse; both abroad and at home.\n\nCaroline Penvenen (Gabriella Wilde)\n\nRich, beautiful and clever, Caroline navigates society’s tiers masterfully but finds the complexities of married life, and love, can be altogether more challenging.\n\nTholly Tregirls (Sean Gilder)\n\nTholly was a friend of Ross father’s before he fled Cornwall and the law many years ago. His womanising and recklessness haven’t been forgotten, and his ability to stir the adventurer in Ross could spell trouble for all…\n\nMorwenna Chynoweth (Ellise Chappell)\n\nMorwenna is Elizabeth’s cousin, and finds herself in George’s employment to support her sisters and widowed mother. Morwenna soon discovers, however, that there are things more important in life than one’s sense of duty or place…\n\nSam Carne (Tom York)\n\nSam arrives in his sister Demelza’s world determined to follow in his father’s footsteps, spreading the Methodist word. But how can Sam profess to save strangers when his own brother courts temptation?\n\nDrake Carne (Harry Richardson)\n\nA good natured free-spirit, Drake has many of the qualities of his sister Demelza. He seeks his own place in the world and finds himself unwilling to settle for the limits life seeks to impose; especially concerning his romantic destiny…\n\nHugh Armitage (Josh Whitehouse)\n\nAs the nephew of Lord Falmouth, Hugh has grown up in the shadow of expectation – a fact he is keenly aware of. But Hugh is also a romantic and wilful. He would do as he chooses with his future, and being true to one’s heart rarely comes without a cost…\n\nOsborne Whitworth (Christian Brassington)\n\nOsborne is from an esteemed family and a reverend. Driven by lustful desires, the widower seeks a new wife and George sees there is a social advantage in helping him…\n\nEmma Tregirls (Ciara Charteris)\n\nLusty and headstrong, Emma isn’t a follower of anyone. When the Carne brothers arrive with God in tow, Emma is therefore the first to poke fun at Sam’s piousness - but people have a strange way of getting under your skin and, as they say, opposites often attract…\n\nLord Falmouth (James Wilby)\n\nA man of ancestral power, his will has dictated the people and politics of Truro for generations but Falmouth finds a revolution in thought occurring, one that threatens to upend the status quo…\n\nSir Francis Basset (John Hopkins)\n\nSir Francis is one of the wealthiest men in the county but where Basset chooses to ally himself will have significant consequences for the people of Truro…\n\nTom Harry (Turlough Convey)\n\nTom Harry is George’s right hand man and delights in carrying out his master’s dirty work. With George’s rising power, Tom Harry finds his own increased – and he’s only too happy to wield it.\n\nAunt Agatha (Caroline Blakiston)\n\nResilient and wily as ever, Agatha resists the Warleggan occupation of Trenwith with all the fervour she can muster, sparing what energy she has left to look out for the Poldarks both at home and at Nampara.\n\nPrudie Paynter (Beatie Edney)\n\nPrudie is Nampara’s loyal servant and an increasingly central part of the Poldark unit. For all her bluster, Prudie is as loyal as they come and not averse to voicing her opinion - whether it’s asked for or not!\n\nRay Penvenen (John Nettles)\n\nCaroline's kindly, sweet-toothed Uncle Ray has raised her since she was orphaned. Ray is one of the county's wealthiest and most powerful gentlemen.\n\nCary Warleggan (Pip Torrens)\n\nGeorge’s uncle, Cary is shrewd and determined to win the respect of the ruling classes. However, his uncouth manner and lack of humanity works against him.\n\nCaptain Henshawe (John Hollingworth)\n\nAn old friend of Ross, Henshawe was Mine Captain of Wheal Leisure when Ross’ father was alive. He is well-respected in his field.\n\nHarris Pascoe (Richard Hope)\n\nRoss’ banker and long standing friend, Pascoe is a shrewd businessman. He frequently counsels Ross to be more cautious in his business dealings, and frequently fails.\n\nReverend Dr Halse (Robin Ellis)\n\nHalse is a powerful Magistrate who has little sympathy for the poor. However, whereas he once held Ross in contempt, he begins to see the value in Ross, and we sense Halse is not as blinkered as we’d reason to believe."
