        "text": "Reviewed by Melanie Cutting\n\nHow many successful novelists named “Ann” can you think of? Ann Patchett, Anne Rice (my husband’s favorite), Ann Tyler? Well, here is another one to put on your list of must-read “Ann” authors.\n\nAmerican author Ann Napolitano’s most recent novel, Hello Beautiful, at 389 pages, was selected as the 100th Oprah’s Book Club pick in 2023. It was also named one of the ten best books of the year by the Chicago Public Library, and one of the best books of the year by The New York Times, Amazon, NPR, The Washington Post, Time, Vogue, Glamour, Harper’s Bazaar, The New York Post and others. Hello Beautiful was also long-listed for the 2024 Dublin Literary Award.\n\nAnn Napolitano was the Associate Editor of One Story literary magazine from 2014-2020. She received an MFA from New York University; she has taught fiction writing for Brooklyn College’s MFA program, New York University’s School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and for Gotham Writers’ Workshop. In November 2019, Ann was long-listed for the Simpson/Joyce Carol Oates Literary Prize.\n\nWith such a casual, conversational title, it is not immediately apparent just what to expect from this book. Hint: think of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel, Little Women, and then update it to the period beginning in the 1970s. Yes, there are four sisters who are about as close as sisters can be, just like Alcott’s March girls; and yes, each one is remarkably different from the others; and yes, there is one male protagonist, William, who bears a strong resemblance to Alcott’s character, Laurie; and yes, the novel follows the lives of the girls from early childhood to middle age. And definitely yes, the Padavano sisters, Julia, Sylvie, Emeline and Cecilia, will capture your heart just as the March girls did when they first appeared in print back in 1868.\n\nAs Napolitano says on her website, “The March sisters, from the first page of Alcott’s novel to the last, show us that we are not enough, and not whole, when we are on our own. We need each other.” And in many ways, that is the principal theme of Hello Beautiful: the interconnectedness of human beings, and how each of the major characters “completes” her siblings. The reader has a front row seat, watching their passage from childhood to womanhood, and is not spared the inevitable sadness that accompanies growth.\n\nAlthough Napolitano herself did not grow up in a large, close-knit family, she was always attracted by the concept, and went out of her way to cultivate relationships within neighbouring families that were, apparently, more than happy to bring her into their fold. When we meet the fictional Padavanos, they are living in Pilsen, a working-class neighborhood of Chicago. Rose, Mrs. Padavano, is high on the Catholic religious spectrum, while Charlie, Mr. Padavano, quotes poetry to the girls and has some difficulty bringing home enough money to live on.\n\nSo what actually happens in the course of the story? Of course I can’t tell you everything, but let’s just say that the author focuses initially on Julia, the oldest sister, and the one least afraid to tackle the big events in life with admirable forthrightness. Both she and William are university students, and he is preoccupied by basketball. (Which, btw, plays a large role in the story, since William is a basketball historian.) From there, we are introduced to younger sister Sylvie, who is a librarian, and the twin girls Cecilia and Emeline, who are several years younger.\n\nJulia, though, is the dominant figure. “From the time she was old enough to speak, she’d bossed her sisters around, pointing out their problems and providing solutions. Sometimes her sisters found this irritating, but they would also admit that having a ‘master troubleshooter’ in their midst was a benefit.”\n\nWhen Julia decides that William is perfect husband material, she takes all the necessary steps to achieve their union, while ignoring the warning signs of trouble in William’s childhood that will eventually undo all of her carefully crafted plans. Further along in the story, their daughter, Alice, arrives, and her story will also play a major part in the saga of the Padavanos. A misunderstanding arises regarding Sylvie’s behaviour toward William shortly after Alice is born, and William’s psychological strife begins to take its toll. The rupture within the family becomes overwhelming.\n\nThe appeal of this novel, for me, was the excellent writing, and the author’s wonderful grasp of, and depiction of, emotions within families that determine the course of their lives.\n\nDid I learn anything new from the story? Not really, [unless you count basketball terminology], and usually, gaining new information is one of my main criteria for enjoying and recommending a book. However, I was fascinated by the course of familial events, and felt the need to keep reading, if only just to see how it would all turn out. Clearly, a “page turner” is how I would describe this novel. Although I don’t come from a large family, the experience of having even one sister is enough to pique my interest in this author’s skilled exposition of the warmth that pervades close family relationships.\n\nIf you would like to read this title, please contact the Library.\n\nNEWS FROM THE LENNOXVILLE LIBRARY\n\nUpcoming Activities\n\nFriday August 9th, 5 to 7pm: LEGO Mindstorm Robotics Workshop (ages 8 to 15).

Emma’s literary career blossomed after a brief foray into the acting world and her first published work, a collection of short stories later compiled into a novel titled Sister Crazy, is my choice for this week’s Good Reads review. Sister Crazy was published in 2001 and follows the life of Jemima Weiss and her rather excentric family. Jem, as she’s known in her family, takes readers deep into her childhood with numerous adventures with her brother Jude, schooling with her sister Harriet, science rants with her brother Ben and her own mystical musings about her parents. Interspersed throughout the book, Richler shifts the narrative’s timeframe as readers are thrust into the present-day existence of Jem which exposes her less-than-ideal living situation and life choices. Jem is a middle child with four siblings, her father a Jewish sportswriter and mother a Christian homemaker. Jem’s childhood with her siblings is nowhere near perfect, but Jem’s fond memories certainly depict it as idyllic. In her debut novel, Richler is obviously indebted to her actual childhood as an offspring of Mordecai Richler, as setting and family structure are taken directly from her own life.\n\nJem and Jude aren’t twins but they sure could be, given that they are nearly inseparable. One key reminiscence of Jem’s is her and Jude’s elaborate game of Action Man. Now Action Man is a toy brand much akin to GI Joe and Barbie. Jem puts all kinds of effort into saving box toppers to mail in and get a free Action Man. Unfortunately for Jem, she receives the worst Action Man of all time, Talking Man. He is cheap, lacking in detail, poor in drawstring speeches, and just a straight bore for her and Jude’s elaborate army games. Jem and Jude set out to create a complex war game which Richler describes in precise World War II military jargon, all with unique mission code names, locations, weapons and other military strategies. Quite impressive rhetoric for two adolescents barely surpassing the age of ten. All their toys are involved in the battle, from their best Action Men figures to the little green army men that hurt really bad when you step on them. Strangely enough, the main character in their game is the lowliest Action Man, the unimpressive Talking Man. His role, as Jem puts it, is one of noble sacrifice. Left to the reader’s imagination, it is not difficult to imagine the fate of the unfortunate Talking Man.\n\nRichler succinctly uses literary stream-of-consciousness writing in her illustration of Jem’s childhood memories. Jem is slightly older than her sister Harriet, who is rather elflike in demeanour as she aimlessly and rather whimsically dances all over their house (and through the entire novel). Harriet is easily distracted and cannot handle the simplest of household tasks like sweeping or fetching the TV remote for her father. As they grow up and are sent to school, Jem takes it upon herself to look after Harriet. At a school run by nuns, Jem knows that Harriet will struggle with the strictness of the nuns’ teaching, and especially sitting still in her seat. Jem makes do in school but her inquiring scientific mind is often stifled by her overbearing instructors.\n\nScience is everything for Jem’s brother Ben, whose interest easily captivates Jem’s imagination. He tells her all about the books he is reading and all the outlandish theories that have percolated in his own mind. Jem tries her hardest to understand the complexities of Albert Einstein, gravitational physics, a theory about the Holy Grail, and so much more, but she ends up only understanding enough to create her own wild theories about time and reality. She unfortunately misses out on the sciences’ incredible nuance. It is at this juncture that Richler gives readers a few glimpses into Jem’s present life, where she is living in a rundown apartment and facing a fierce drug and alcohol addiction. She fondly recalls her sister Harriet (who is apparently looking after her), Jude, now an actual military correspondent, and all of Ben’s scientific theories that could possibly take her to a different time, one where she is not blacking out on the floor of her apartment.\n\nEmma Richler’s debut novel Sister Crazy is one that kept me thoroughly entertained for its 200 pages. She captures the essence of a child’s imaginative mind brilliantly. Her rapid fire, stream-of-consciousness depiction of a happy childhood and distraught adult life ground the novel in authenticity and relatability. If you’re looking for a novel that is wildly entertaining and funny while also being quite serious and almost philosophicl, then Sister Crazy will certainly satisfy your craving.\n\nThis title is apparently not available at local libraries, but contacting Lennoxville Library should helap you locate a copy.\n\nNEWS FROM THE LENNOXVILLE LIBRARY\n\nJob Offer\n\nThe Library is hiring a Youth Services Assistant:\n\nDo you love working with children?

As I mentioned then, in the late 1800s there was a substantial amount of cross fertilization between artistic and literary movements in the west and their counterparts in Japan. In this review I highlight another very famous crossover writer, Jun’ichirō Tanizaki, in particular his collection of “essential” stories featuring “The Qilin”, “Killing O-Tsuya”, and “The Siren’s Lament”.\n\nTanizaki and Hirai were almost precise contemporaries, born in the early years of the Meiji period—1880s-90s—and living until 1965. Both managed only sporadic “literary” education, yet went on to be important figures in the literature of modern Japan. Both authors, intrigued by literary currents in the West, integrated foreign threads, but while Hirai adopted detective fiction genres, Tanizaki’s work from the early 1900s bears the unmistakable imprint of European fin-de siècle decadence, the so-called moral decay that afflicted Europe at that time.\n\nIn “The Qilin”, for example, we see an epic confrontation between Confucius and Nanzi, the consort of His Serene Highness the Duke Ling, ruler of Wei. The story unfolds thus: Confucius has embarked on a trip to foreign realms to spread his teachings, specifically grace, wise government, the primacy of virtue over material gain, of benevolence over tyranny. Nanzi, the main consort of His Serene Highness, likes things just as they are, a state in which all the riches of the earth—all imaginable extreme and exotic pleasures—are put at the disposal of the royal couple while the populace languishes in misery and poverty. Duke Ling is initially intrigued by the words of Confucius and, in fact, awakens to the true nature of his deluded enthrallment to his consort and her associated earthly pleasures. Nanzi, never one to duck a challenge, sets out to seduce Confucius and maintain her power over the Duke.\n\nIt is remarkable how the genres defined by Oscar Wilde’s short fiction and his novel A Picture of Dorian Gray seem to be resurrected and adapted seamlessly to the Japanese culture. Wilde’s main source of dramatic tension was the divergence between expected social mores—typically English, Judeo-Christian values—and the push towards intense individualism and the pursuit of sensations. In “The Qilin” this finds renewed meaning in the conflict between the beneficent enlightenment of Confucius and the selfish, grasping egotism of the Duke’s consort.\n\nIt is also curious to note how the same forces that led to decadence in Europe—material prosperity, a growing affluent and educated middle class, industrialism and modernity—play out in turn-of-the-century Japan.\n\nThe second story, “Killing O-Tsuya” relates the tale of a pawn-broker’s apprentice, Shinsuke, and his illicit affair with the pawnbroker’s virginal daughter O-Tsuya. In this case the main conflict emerges between the obligations of fixed social roles and the overpowering passion that draws the two lovers together. But this conflict is rendered far more complicated by the underworld that the characters are drawn into in their flight from the pawnbroker. A local businessman, Seiji, offers support to the lovers, but it turns out that his interest is actually mercenary; he hopes to make money by marketing O-Tsuya’s favours in the geisha trade. O-Tsuya, originally sweet and demure, with more than a seemly enthusiasm embraces the life of a geisha and all that that entails. Shinsuke is inadvertently yet inevitably drawn into a life of increasingly violent criminality. This story, one is told, adopts the typical plot lines from “Edo-era kabuki or bunraku puppet theatre” which deals with star-crossed lovers, yet the narrative arc is completely in tune with western literary and operatic themes. [Spoiler alert! The title of the story is not irrelevant!]\n\nThe third story, “The Siren’s Lament”, returns to a more fairy-tale genre. It deals with an ancient Chinese prince who inherits a vast fortune from his parents, along with unparalleled looks, intelligence and abilities. He embarks on a Siddhartha/Dorian Gray-like pursuit of excess, to the extent that, “by the age of twenty-two or thereabouts he had tried every extreme that this world could offer by way of extravagance and debauchery”. He subsequently falls into an indifferent stupor, jaded by the inevitable disappointment of materialistic hedonism. One day a Dutch merchant comes to town with a large aquarium containing a mermaid. In the mermaid the Prince sees a remedy to his indifference. He gives the Dutch merchant an enormous portion of his fortune in gold, gems, ivory and what-not, and then proceeds to get better acquainted with the creature. Pages upon pages in the narrative are devoted to a minute description of her hair, her eyes, her skin. He comes to look upon her as the apogee of all that is desirable in western culture, and in her the culmination of all desire. As the reader might surmise, this cannot end well!\n\nIn a crucial scene, when the Prince gives the mermaid some wine, Tanizaki casually reveals his indebtedness to decadent writers: “Then, with a lurid smile, like that of Beardsley’s Salome in The Dancer’s Reward, she insistently demanded another cup, purring all the while.”\n\nIt is interesting that Tanizaki, although he refused to be defined according to popular Japanese literary categories, became a literary giant in Japan. The fact that these transplanted themes resonated so well with his audience attests to the universality of the decadent experience.\n\nIf you would like to read this title, contact the Library.\n\nNEWS FROM THE LENNOXVILLE LIBRARY\n\nActivities for kids\n\nCreative Movement Workshop for Parents and kids (ages 8-15)\n\nFriday, August 2nd, 6:30-7:30 pm\n\nSquare Queen\n\nAn activity for parents and children aged 8 to 15 with Sursaut Dance Company.\n\nRocket Building Workshop- build and launch a mini rocket\n\nTuesday, August 6th, 1-4pm\n\nAt the library.

No sign up required.\n\nReviewed by Shanna Bernier\n\nThis week’s review was inspired by two deeply different thoughts, brought together by a perfect picture book bridge. First, my youngest child continues to be afraid of the dark, and this nighttime aversion is really stressful. Second, this Saturday, July 20th, is the 55th anniversary of the first moon landing. The bridge between the two thoughts? A book written by Canada’s favourite David Bowie-covering astronaut, Chris Hadfield.\n\nThe Darkest Dark is Canadian Chris Hadfield’s 2016 picture book, featuring beautiful illustrations by the Fan brothers. The Darkest Dark tells the autobiographical story that took place in Hadfield’s childhood. As a child, Chris loved rockets and planets and space. He had an active imagination and loved to make believe he was a brave space explorer, encountering unknown parts of the universe. This was all well and good during the day, but once the sun set, Chris was very afraid, afraid of the dark.\n\nThe story unfolds in the summer of 1969 at their family cottage. Chris has a brilliant and active imagination, but this gets him into trouble at night when he wants to fall asleep. His parents are kind and empathetic, but also frustrated because they are all losing sleep!\n\nChris is motivated to have a good night’s sleep because something very, very important is coming up, which all the families on the island will gather together to watch on the single TV in their cottage community. Chris struggles, but manages to fall asleep the fateful night before, and is overcome by the magic of what he sees the following July evening. As he watches the groundbreaking moon landing on TV, he realizes that space is the darkest dark there is–and the dark can be beautiful and exciting. He does an experiment the next night: he turns off his lights and the room still has shadows and creepy corners, but he has changed. He has seen first-hand how much bigger the universe is than his little room, and he wants to explore it.\n\n“For the first time, Chris could see the power and mystery and the velvety black beauty of the dark.”\n\nOur youngest child is a deeply creative and sensitive soul. She has a remarkable capacity to imagine and invent worlds in her mind, but like many children, she hasn’t yet mastered the art of keeping the monsters and bad guys out of her dreams. We have worked hard, with many creative strategies to help make the darkness less scary, and for sleep to be a welcome rest. I like Hadfield’s book because it speaks to me as a parent of a creative and sensitive child, that the solution has to come from them. Little Chris needed to encounter the universe, and be inspired by its vastness in order to lose his fear of the shadows in his bedroom. Our kiddo will find her own way, which for the moment includes a lovely lavender room spray, and the nightly ritual of boldly declaring several self-assuring mantras, followed by downright yelling that BAD DREAMS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!\n\nThe dream of travelling to space and being an astronaut doesn’t often come true, but for Chris Hadfield it did! He has become one of the most accomplished astronauts in the world. Among his many notable accomplishments, he was Chief of International Space Station Operations from 2006-2008; during his tenure he gained worldwide acclaim for his breathtaking photographs and educational videos about life in space. Hadfield not only had his dreams of space adventures come true, but has worked tirelessly to inspire another generation of youth to become interested in the science of space.\n\nHow perfect that, on this 55th anniversary of the first moon landing, which Hadfield recalls as pivotal in his inspiration to become an astronaut, we too can celebrate the moon and space during the weekly summer activities at the Espace Biblio in Lennoxville’s Square Queen. Every Saturday there are free, facilitated activities for kids and youth from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. As a special treat, 12-year-old local artist Olivia will hold a watercolor workshop for this special day!\n\nPS: As it turns out, I (Shanna) reviewed this lovely book an earlier time, in 2017 which can be read on the Good Reads Archives, https://bibliolennlibrary.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/. I found it fun to compare and contrast my reviews, especially now that I have 7 more years of parenting under my belt.

For me, one of these “comfort” areas is 20th– century British literature. Now, this a big area with lots of variety, and there is no single idea that ties this period completely together. It is true that this era saw two world wars, so the 20th-century literary milieu cannot avoid being touched in one way or another by the most brutal conflicts in recorded history. However, a notable aspect in much of 20th-century British literature is existentialism. A general malaise in the human psyche is observed in many writers from this period, and one of these is Katherine Mansfield. Mansfield was a New Zealander by birth but emigrated to England in early adulthood for schooling. She would also spend much time in other western European countries, including Germany, Belgium and France, where her literary talents became apparent. Her first short stories began to circulate in 1908 and her second collection, Bliss and Other Stories, was published in 1920 and is this week’s subject for review.\n\nI was first introduced to Mansfield in my undergraduate studies when I read her short story “The Garden Party,” which follows the modernist literary mode of being written without a defined structure and frequently shifting in narrative. Topically, the fourteen stories that make up Bliss and Other Stories are undramatic. They follow the lives of family members amid ordinary life, travellers, lovers, dreamers, and thinkers. No story’s plot is thoroughly defined. Instead, readers are dropped into a world with moving bodies all around, thoughts and conversations coming from all directions. Sometimes names of characters are given, and at other times this information slips the narrator’s mind. Take for example, the first story in the collection, “Prelude”. This is the lengthiest in the collection at around fifty pages and offers the closest example to a traditional plot structure. It follows the lives of the Burnell family as they begin the process of moving house in New Zealand. The action is seen through the eyes of the family’s young children, Lottie and Kezia. They are nervous and excited and always looking for new ways to go on adventures in their new house. Meanwhile, Mrs. Burnell has more adult concerns about the move, and Mr. Burnell seeks solitude from the hustle and bustle of city life. Throughout Mansfield is very adept at revealing the inner lives of the characters—their hopes, their disappointments, their illusions.\n\nThere are other stories in the collection that focus on existential angst and human psychology, particularly “The Wind Blows” and (unironically) “Psychology”. “The Wind Blows” is an odd story that centres on a female protagonist who is in the midst of some sort of psychological episode. Flurries of emotions seemingly come from nowhere and, I must admit, cause quite the confusion as readers try to keep track of what is happening in the story. She speaks to a few people, rambles considerably, has a music lesson, and ends up outside where the sound of the wind speaks to her. She wonders if poets have written poems to the wind. The disjointed thoughts of this woman lead the reader to believe that she is searching for something, or for someone, but she is ultimately left behind. She is left with the sound of tumbling water, the howling wind. “Psychology” has two unnamed characters, one male and one female. They are friends and spend much time together, talking for hours on end about academic, political, and more trivial topics. Silence between them is rare. In this story Mansfield comments on the human desire to speak, to fill the void with sound, and on the psychological concept of silence.\n\nWhen Bliss and Other Stories was published Mansfield was entering her most prolific period in her literary career but was also suffering from ailing health. Her brother had died in World War I, she had suffered from depression, experienced failed relationships, and in 1917 was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. After years of failed treatment attempts, Mansfield died in 1923. Her impact on English literature cannot be overstated. Her subtle treatment of the human psyche and her lyrical style are some of the best examples in the English canon, and her influence on her friends and contemporaries—D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf—is quite apparent. This was an immediate reaction of mine as I got more into the collection; I saw Woolf’s style through Mansfield’s and vice versa. Notably, I was more interested in Mansfield’s style of writing than in the content. I highly recommend Bliss and Other Stories to readers looking for a new challenge and for those seeking to experience some classic 20th-century British modernist literature.\n\nIf you wish to read Bliss or other Mansfield titles, please contact the Library.\n\nReviewed by Stephen Sheeran\n\nThe first chapter of Crazy Rich Asians sets the tone for the entire novel: Three Leong sisters (Singapore Chinese) have just arrived with their children (all somewhat wet and bedraggled) from Heathrow airport to claim their deluxe suite reservation (the Lancaster suite, no less) in the ultra-swanky Calthorpe Hotel in London. Their precocious children are doing what precocious children do, and the family group attracts the attention of general manager Reginald Ormsby (Reginewd Ohmsby if you prifeh!). He decides that a bunch of scruffy-looking Chinese are not going to cut it in the dining room alongside such notables as the Marchioness of Uckfield. He is suddenly “unable” to find their reservation and unceremoniously escorts them out of the hotel, suggesting that they seek accommodation in CHINATOWN.\n\nA few minutes later the same family returns, escorted by the owner of the hotel, Lord Rupert Calthorpe-Cavendish-Gore, who announces that the hotel has just been sold to the Leong family. In a very satisfying dramatic moment, Ormsby is escorted from the premises.\n\nKevin Kwan is no doubt flavour of the month in the world of up and coming novelists. Crazy Rich Asians (2013) kicked off a trilogy, each one selling in the millions in the U.S. It has been translated into 130 languages, and a smash-hit film version (with an all-Asian cast!) was released in 2018. Kwan was born in Singapore and his family emigrated to the U.S. when he was eleven. Crazy Rich Asians arose out of his childhood recollections and his interactions with his home country over the decades as it evolved into an economic powerhouse.\n\nThe story is unabashedly romantic comedy. Nick Young (one of the kids in the opening chapter), now grown up, is a history professor at NYU. He is going out with a another (mainland) Chinese ex-pat Rachel Chu, who teaches economics, also at NYU. He casually suggests that they go on a vacation to Singapore. A friend of his is getting married and they can combine the wedding with travels around Southeast Asia…and sure, meet some of Nick’s rather extended family.\n\nThe problem is that Rachel has no inkling about Nick’s affluent background. In fact, as the scion of three extremely wealthy Singaporean families he is one of the most eligible bachelors in Southeast Asia. Within minutes of their decision to make the trip, news reaches Nick’s mother and aunts that he is bringing his girlfriend home to meet the family, and this information sends shock waves throughout Singapore’s affluent social circles. Cue a long lineup of aggressively territorial grand-parents and parents, jealous girlfriends, interfering and conspiratorial uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters and cousins.\n\nPicture Jane Austen and Tom Wolfe jointly hosting Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, with strong doses of Big Brother, Beverley Hills Housewives and Survivor filling a scene or two. [NB. The writer of this review is relying on anecdotal evidence…. He will not readily admit to having watched any of these programs….] Any matches contemplated by the Singaporean families have an eye to increasing or consolidating wealth. Every Singaporean child is measured from birth by the unique criterion of how they will potentially contribute to family fortunes. Strangers are always “investigated” through means direct and indirect to assess family background, hence their place in the pecking order of the fabulously rich.\n\nKwang acknowledges that mainland Chinese, especially those fortunate individuals who have successfully negotiated the transition from communism to free-market capitalism, are similar; however, his main focus is on “overseas Chinese”, those generations who have spread throughout Southeast Asia and amassed extraordinary wealth, establishing virtual dynasties of affluence.\n\nCuriously—and necessarily—Kwang adopts a practice typical in Russian novels: he provides an elaborate family tree at the start, along with the family locales (Leongs: Singapore; Youngs: Thailand, Switzerland; Chengs: Hong Kong; Shangs: Singapore, Buckinghamshire). Readers will likely want to bookmark the page….\n\nNick and Rachel are thrown into a maelstrom of competing interests. Nick’s family(ies) maintain a façade of politeness yet actively conspire to drive the lovers apart. Nick’s old flames are jetted in to try to make Rachel jealous. Rachel’s mainland Chinese background is thoroughly investigated, and sordid events from her mother’s past are brought to light. A constant stream of catty comments are designed to make her feel inadequate.\n\nThis plot line is an efficient vehicle for delving into the excesses of riches in extreme. Family members bicker over whose private jet will be the most suitable for an occasion. Women jet off for shopping weekends. Bespoke couturiers in exclusive Paris salons faun over pampered bejewelled matriarchs. Island resorts are purchased and redesigned at a whim. European country estates are kept fully staffed against occasional visits.\n\nThis parade of opulence almost works against Kwan. At times the narrative is rendered a bit stilted as fashionista and home-décor jargon is insinuated into the casual conversations. (Characters don’t close anything as banal as a door; they close “BOISERIE” doors.) And readers had better brush up on “cloche hats”, “white drape-front silk georgette dresses with navy blue trim” and “state-of-the-art Ayurvedic yoga studios with inlaid pebble walls and heated pine floors”.\n\nIn fact there is almost a Shakespearean flavour to the overall arc of the plot in that all that glisters ain’t necessarily gold. While, stylistically, Kwan’s work is effective, the most compelling aspect of Crazy Rich Asians is the satirical take on a society which is comparatively unknown to Western readers.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians, along with other Kwan titles, is available at the Lennoxville Library.\n\nReviewed by Shanna Bernier\n\nI was an anxious child. I worried a lot that about bad things happening to me. I worried about breaking rules and getting in trouble. It took me a long time to understand that anxiety, and other challenges of mental health, are not moral failings, or things to be ashamed of. It took me a long time to figure out the best way to get along with my brain, and to feel mentally healthy. Because our neurological make-up is highly genetic, it isn’t surprising to me that I have two children who also have struggled with some anxiety and worries. We are doing our best to raise emotionally intelligent young people, but even with a toolbox filled with strategies, and access to mental health care and support, difficult feelings still exist.\n\nIt is a dangerous and false notion that we should stive to be happy all the time. Many young people feel that they are failing because they experience sadness, or anxiety or rage. One of the dangers that young people face in the falsely shiny world of social media, influenced by multi-billion-dollar wellness and beauty industries, is the notion that , with the right lifestyle, you can just be perpetually happy. Humans are meant to experience lots of different feelings; however, sadness is different from depression. Nerves and anxiety over a specific situation are different from a panic disorder. Folks who are prone to anxiety and depression will never magically cure their moods with meditation or vitamins. There are many, many ways in which we can improve our mental health and they often involve a combination of strategies, such as therapy, medication, exercise and mindfulness.\n\nLiving With Viola by Rosena Fung is a beautiful debut graphic novel for middle-grade readers about living with anxiety. Protagonist Livy is starting grade 6 in a new school. She is first-generation Canadian with Chinese immigrant parents. She is shy, nervous and very self-conscious. Livy loves drawing, pink unicorns, stuffed animals and books about magical girl warriors. She can sometimes overcome moments of panic with her own strategies of seeking comfort and safety from her stuffed caticorn, or by drawing pictures. When Livy is feeling anxious, her unwanted and intrusive thoughts manifest into a mean and bullying companion, named “Viola” who drowns out all other information with her judgement and cruelty. The images on each page show her thoughts swirling around her like spectres and storms, sometimes physically overwhelming her. She is called out for being too quiet, for not paying attention and for day-dreaming.\n\nIn addition to her anxious thoughts, Livy feels the pressure and stress to live up to her family’s expectations. Like many children of immigrants who have come to Canada to have better opportunities for their families, she is reminded often of the sacrifices her family has made for her. Livy’s extended family shames her parents for not having good jobs. Her parents dismiss her love of art as an impractical career goal, when she could instead aim for medical school. Because mental health is also stigmatized by her family, she doesn’t share any of her suffering with her parents for a long time.\n\nLivy doesn’t easily make friends at her new school. She feels too Chinese, or too different than some of her peers (with her “smelly” Chinese lunches). Fearing the classism and racism that immigrant families face, Livy hides parts of herself, and lies about her parents’ jobs. After her few friendships begin to unravel and she fails a quiz, her teacher and parents notice that Livy is not doing well. Despite her fears, everyone does their best to try and help her. Once Livy opens up about her feelings to her parents, they find her a supportive doctor, and make changes to help her feel better.\n\nI really appreciate how the book follows her journey to seeking help, which can be for some the most difficult step. The author shares some of the strategies and techniques Livy’s doctor recommends to manage her anxiety. Living with Viola presents a realistic approach to managing mental illness, where the goal is never to be rid of all bad feelings once and for all, but to learn to manage spiraling thoughts with tools. Rosena Fung draws on her own early experiences with anxiety and the pressures of growing up as the child of Chinese immigrant parents to craft a deeply personal story. In her afterword, she reminds readers how important it is to ask for help if you need it, and that we are never alone in our struggles. I read this book after it was recommended to me by my discerning eight-year-old daughter. She was very moved by the story, and shared great empathy for Livy’s struggles. Both Meredith and I agree, this is a good read!\n\nReviewed by Melanie Cutting\n\n“James McBride is the bestselling author of The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store, the 2023 Book of the Year Winner. McBride is also the author of: Deacon King Kong, The Good Lord Bird, The Color of Water, Song Yet Sung, Miracle at St. Anna, Five-Carat Soul, and Kill ‘Em and Leave. The recipient of a National Humanities Medal and an accomplished musician, McBride is also a distinguished writer in residence at New York University” (Barnes and Noble). He currently resides in Lambertville, N.J., just across the Delaware River from bucolic New Hope, Pennsylvania, and only about an hour and a quarter from Pottstown, Pennsylvania, the less-than-bucolic setting for The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.\n\nThis story is an uplifting tale of kindness, community and resourcefulness. Although the novel opens in 1972 with the discovery of a skeleton in a Pottstown well, the bulk of the action is set in the 1920s and 30s. The mysterious skeleton is accompanied by a mezuzah, a small scroll inscribed with a text from Deuteronomy and the name Shaddai, which is typically posted on Jewish homes. A smaller version is often worn inside a gold locket as a necklace, as in this case. Also accompanying the skeleton: a redcoat-style vintage jacket. This mystery is pivotal to the plot, but we don’t get the answer to the puzzle until the final pages of the epilogue.\n\nThe Heaven and Earth Grocery Store follows a group of Jewish immigrants and African Americans who live together harmoniously on Chicken Hill in the early part of the 20th century in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. The principal characters are Moshe Ludlow, a Romanian Jew, and Chona, his beautiful Jewish-American wife. She is an avid reader, a brave young woman who has no fear of speaking out against injustice, despite being handicapped from a bout of polio earlier in life. Chona is close friends with many of the Black residents of Chicken Hill, in particular her former schoolmate and neighbour Bernice. Moshe runs the fitfully successful All-American Dance Hall Theater, while Chona looks after the Heaven and Earth grocery store, always offering credit to those in need.\n\nAfter 12 years of marriage, Chona develops a mysterious illness. She refuses to be treated by the execrable Doc Roberts, who marches with the Ku Klux Klan. Instead, she helps Moshe’s Black handyman Nate Timblin and his wife, Addie, protect a 12-year-old orphan named Dodo who lost his hearing (and his mother) in an explosion caused by a kitchen stove. After Dodo is incarcerated in Pennhurst, an abusive mental institution, the community unites in a bid to free him.\n\nJames McBride, as well as being an accomplished musician and award-winning writer, has deep roots in this time period and milieu—his father was African American, his mother a Jewish immigrant from Poland, who converted to Christianity and raised 10 children. With this deeply moving and often surprising book, McBride pays homage to his Jewish grandmother whom he never met. This woman did not have a particularly happy life, but one of McBride’s goals is to ensure she will be remembered as loved, like the character Chona, on whom she is based.\n\nThe cast of characters is large, but not so large that the reader loses track of who’s who. In addition to Moshe and Chona, there is Moshe’s cousin Isaac, also in the music hall business; Nate, a powerful and compassionate Black man who, along with his wife Addie, plays a large part in the lives and ultimate destiny of Moshe and Chona, among others; Dodo, the orphaned and deaf black teen who is the pivotal figure in the second part of the book; Paper, the beautiful, loquacious and clever young Negro laundress who is instrumental in putting together their daring and dangerous rescue effort under extraordinarily difficult circumstances; Monkey Pants, a young man with crippling cerebral palsy who has been misplaced in the odious Pennhurst mental hospital; Doc Roberts, a Ku Klux Klan supporter who is responsible for none of the good that befalls the Black populace and plenty of the bad; Malachi, the handsome and talented young Hasidic Jewish baker who befriends Moshe and helps to heal Chona when she becomes deathly ill; and finally, jook joint owner Fatty and his pal Big Soap.\n\nIn addition to constructing and elaborating the plot of this engrossing novel, McBride embeds much of the text with observations on the lives, history and philosophy of the area’s Jewish and Black population. Pennsylvania is depicted as home to Quakers, Mormons and Presbyterians. He provides especially vivid insights into the Jews, who emigrated and settled in the area, “who cared that life was lonely, that jobs were thankless drudgery, that the romance of the proud American state was myth, that the rules of life were laid carefully in neat books and laws written by stern Europeans who stalked the town and state like the grim reaper, with their righteous churches spouting that Jews murdered their precious Jesus Christ?…[The Jews’] job was to tread lightly in the land of milk and honey and be thankful that they were free to walk the land without getting their duffs kicked—or worse. Life in America was hard, but it was free, and if you worked hard, you might gain some opportunity, maybe even open a shop or business of some kind.” He is equally eloquent when describing the living conditions of the Black folks in the area. Cruelty and compassion are both integral to their lives.\n\nThe Heaven and Earth Grocery Store is available at both the Lennoxville Library and the Haskell Free Library in Stanstead.

You readers sure don’t need to know what I do in my spare time! However, this just might be relevant: I found myself driving through Lennoxville around 11:30 a few Saturday nights ago, and I was struck by the utter quiet. Most places seemed closed, except for McDonalds… and two people could be seen outside the Golden Lion Pub, smoking almost guiltily, gazing idly at their smartphones. Apart from that the streets were deserted—no one to be seen. I was struck by the contrast with typical Saturday night scenes 50 years ago, with the jostle, buzz and frenzy throughout Lennoxville as drunken crowds peregrinated amongst at least eight drinking establishments, the air filled with laughter, curses, insults, along with cigarette smoke, the odd waft of illicit marijuana, and exhaust fumes from muscle cars which screamed up and down the main drag.\n\nOh the yells, the screams, the chaos, the mayhem!\n\nIn smoke-filled barrooms to the backdrop of deafening rock music were CONVERSATIONS, WILD STORIES, tales of getting sh*t-faced and driving down highways at 120 miles an hour, NEWS ABOUT who was making who, who got ripped off by whom, what place got raided, what Baby Honda got up to at last year’s Barton fair and the like.\n\nIn short, a more hyped-up bunch of narcissistic hedonists could not be imagined. And who, you may wonder, was responsible for all this????\n\nJack Kerouac.\n\nI recently decided to fill a rather large gap in my literary formation by reading On the Road. It didn’t disappoint!\n\nAt first glance, there doesn’t seem to be much to recommend it. It relates a series of madcap trips across America undertaken by Sal Paradise, prompted and driven by his friendship/obsession with Dean Moriarty. For a generation that has become anaesthetized by electronic screens and duff-sitting, the idea of setting off on apparently pointless cross-country trips doesn’t have much appeal. But Sal’s adventures seem to epitomize the post-WW II American zeitgeist. The war was over, the privations of that and the great depression were fading into the background. The social dynamics had changed, fixed roles and expectations seemed to have fallen away, and there was nothing for it but to explore the boundless possibilities of America.\n\nOn the Road is what we call in the serious business of literary pretentiousness, a picaresque bildungsroman à clef. As they criss-cross the country, Paradise and Moriarty encounter a bizarre cross-section of the national fabric—hoboes, drug-addicts, migrant workers, visionaries, jazz musicians, hookers, and mean cops. At the heart of the story—the journey of two young men in search of something, some essence, some spirit that underlies it all. Most of the characters are representations of real people, mainly those associated with the “beat” society that surrounded Kerouac. Apart from Sal Paradise as Kerouac and Dean Moriarty as Neal Cassady, Old Bull Lee is William S. Burroughs, Carlo Marx is Allan Ginsberg, Damion is Lucien Carr…. A veritable rogues’ gallery of iconoclastic writers and individuals who believed in a new approach to fiction, one that involved naked self-expression, the raising of consciousness through drugs and extreme experience, and the rejection of conventional mores.\n\nAnd On the Road, like almost all of Kerouac’s novels, is unremittingly and inevitably about Kerouac, but it is about Kerouac doing the world. In that way, the novel paves the way for gonzo writers such as Hunter S. Thomson and, in a more profound vein, Robert Pirsig in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\n\nSpoiler alert: To politically correct adventurers, Hic sunt huge Dragones, with bells on!\n\nSEX!\n\nParadise and Moriarty show a penchant for marriage (they are, after all, good Catholic boys) yet are constantly on the make. With considerable gusto they promise to find each other “some girls”. Very few scenes pass by without some sexual gettin’s on. In real life Kerouac and Cassady showed no hang-ups about bisexual impulses; homo- and heterosexual encounters were common in their circle of beat acquaintances. So from random wild parties to happenstance hook-ups, from wife-sharing to Mexican bordellos with underaged prostitutes, raw unfettered appetite defines the actions of Paradise and Moriarty.\n\nDRUGS!!\n\nIn spite of a chronic shortage of funds, Paradise and Moriarty always manage to rustle up some booze or marijuana or amphetamines, the better to party and live on the edge.\n\nJAZZ!!!\n\nThe events take place in the late forties, right at the height of bebop jazz and there is a certain jazziness to the entire work. Everybody’s diggin’ it, lookin’ for kicks, hangin’ at someone’s pad, blowin’ it, smokin’ tea, and generally gettin’ it on. Kerouac claimed that the actual writing of On the Road was jazz inflected. He taped together sheets of paper into a 120-foot roll so he could type without having to stop to feed his typewriter. He said that he wanted to write the way jazz musicians improvised, through stream-of-consciousness extemporizations. Moreover, several key scenes take place in jazz clubs, where the virtuosic outpourings of bop musicians tease our cats into a transcendent state of awareness.\n\nIt is hard to overestimate the influence of Cassady/Moriarty on Kerouac/Paradise. Cassady was a cast-off juvenile delinquent in Denver, and he came to New York and struck up a relationship with Kerouac and his beat circle. Extremely intelligent and charismatic, Cassady became Kerouac’s muse and exemplar. In Cassady’s feverish approach to life and his breathless way of expression he gave Kerouac his voice.\n\nNot surprisingly, Neal Cassady went on to join in Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters, who were at the vanguard of hippie psychedelia in the 1960s…and, along with Kerouac, largely responsible for the anarchy in Lennoxville at the time.\n\nIf you would like to read On the Road, contact the Library.\n\nNEWS FROM THE LENNOXVILLE LIBRARY\n\nSpecial Activities in June\n\nAuthor Event (in French): Nicole Lussier presents “Terre de nos aïeules” June 6th, 5pm.\n\nLibrary Book Sale.

Yellow, orange, red: each colour represented a level of competence and a step towards being a strong swimmer. I was one of those kids who is afraid to put my head under water, so I got a bit stuck in the first colour, yellow, and needed to repeat it at least twice. Somehow, I figured out the missing link in my own bathtub and I was finally able to graduate beyond blowing bubbles in the shallow end. I’ll never win any races, but I can hold my own in the deep end and I am grateful that I learned to swim with I was a kid.\n\nSwimming is a life-saving skill. My mom has never been a strong swimmer, so she wanted her children to be confident and safe in pools and lakes. She made a brave and selfless parental choice, to encourage me and my sister to be able to swim, even if the idea of deep water scared her. Her example influenced my parenting, and my kids are enthusiastic swimmers who have already surpassed the previous two generations in terms of athletic competence in the pool.\n\nI was not surprised when both of my children were drawn to the gorgeous swimming-pool-turquoise cover of Swim Team by Johnnie Christmas. This middle grade graphic novel chronicles the lives of Bree and her dad Ralph, as they move across the country and start a new chapter in Florida. Bree is a great student, who loves math and puzzles, and isn’t a fan of sports. Bree is an anxious kid, who doesn’t easily make friends or navigate the anxiety and stress she feels in situations where she has no control. Her unwanted and intrusive thoughts are displayed on the page in darker, ominous script that sometimes nearly covers the image. Registering for classes leads to disappointment when the only elective left for her to take is Swim 101. After feigning sickness, skipping class and getting in trouble with the hall monitor, Bree is forced to admit that she is terrified of the pool, and that she doesn’t know how to swim. After falling into the apartment building’s pool and nearly drowning, Bree asks for help. Her father signs her up for private lessons, but her shame and embarrassment continue when students from the rival private school mock her for not being able to swim.\n\nBree and her dad have formed a friendship with their neighbour Etta, who was a champion swimmer in her youth. Etta agrees to help Bree, and together, one step at a time, they begin swimming. During their time spent together, Etta shares how generations of Black Americans have been denied access to swimming because of segregated communities, private pools denying Black people entry, and Black neighbourhoods having poorly funded smaller parks. Despite her lessons, Bree isn’t doing well in her Swim 101 class after missing so many classes. To earn extra credit, she reluctantly tries out for her school’s swim team, and is surprised to learn that she is good enough to compete! Suddenly Bree is neck deep in team dynamics, competitive private schools, friendships and early morning practice. As in all inspirational sports stories, these characters are working towards an important state level swim meet, and the fate of their little public school’s pool rests on their success.\n\nThis novel provides a context and historical lens for one of the most pervasive stereotypes in North American Black culture – that Black folks aren’t good at swimming.\n\nThe author, in an interview with CBC books, said:\n\n“When I was five years old, I almost drowned in a pool. And that stayed with me and it informed my relationship with the water since then. It wasn’t until I was an adult that I started taking swim classes…I wanted to have something for those readers to see themselves reflected and to possibly see that if they do have access to a pool, there’s a road for them.”\n\nSwim Team is a compelling story of the scrappy underdogs working hard to overcome adversity, and learn important life lessons along the way. These are beloved clichés in sports narratives for a reason, because they pull at our heartstrings. Figuring out how to work as a team is hard work, and the children in the book get a great example from their coach, and from Etta, who reunites with her own former swim-sisters to overcome the challenges they faced fifty years earlier.\n\nSo, jump right in, take that plunge. Enjoy a perfect read for the start of summer. Get your beach umbrella and your lounger ready then dive into this delightful book about swimming, building community, overcoming adversity and facing your fears."
