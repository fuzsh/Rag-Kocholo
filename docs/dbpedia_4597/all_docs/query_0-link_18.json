        "text": "POLDARK star Gabriella Wilde‚Äôs son was rushed to hospital this week with a mystery illness.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who is best known for playing Caroline Penvenen in the hit show, revealed Skye, 3, is now on the mend and back at home as she thanked the NHS.\n\nSharing a picture of her son in the hospital bed, she wrote: ‚ÄúEarlier this week my darling Skye was being cared for by the incredible team of doctors and nurses @ruhbath hospital.\n\n‚ÄúI am so deeply grateful to all of those angels who looked after him and I with such grace and care. Thank you thank you thank you for everything you do and all the sacrifices you make to take care of and heal others.\n\n‚ÄúI am so grateful to live in a country with national health care . It is something we must NEVER take for granted.‚Äù\n\nThe actress added: ‚ÄúSkye is now well and home playing with his brothers üíóüôè‚ú®‚Äù\n\nGabriella, whose full name is Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, has been marred to singer songwriter Alan Pownall since 2014.\n\nAs well as Skye, they are parents to Sasha, eight and Shiloh, six.\n\nShe was pregnant with second son Shiloh during filming of the second series, admitting: ‚ÄúIt was lovely to show people I could get the job done. But yeah it was tiring.‚Äù\n\nOnce her baby was born, she revealed how her costumes were adapted to enable her to breastfeed.\n\nShe told Country and Town House magazine: ‚ÄúThe only time I have is when I brought my baby on set. He was four months old when we started filming the third series of Poldark. Brilliantly, the entire filming schedule was laid around his feeding time.\n\n‚ÄúMy costumes were especially designed so that I could feed him. He was sick on me nearly every day which gave the costume designers a bit of a heart attack since you can‚Äôt really wash these elaborate costumes.‚Äù"
