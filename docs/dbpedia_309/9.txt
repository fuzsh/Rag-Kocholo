Raul Ruiz argues against the sort of dogmatic religion who is the religion of conflicts in filmmaking. He explores the idea of making film without any kind of conflicts. And making structures taken from poetry and from othe narrative structures who doesn't need conflicts. Raul gives more importance to elements that are supposed to be secondary, eliminating the narrative pyramid. Pushing and researching the dogmatic way of telling stories through cinema without being really experimental.

Raul Ruiz was trying to Inventing new ways of making films. He experimented with different kind of techniques and ideas to see what happends.

Three Crowns of the Sailor, is the second movie Ive seen from Raul and is definitely the best of the two in my personally opinion, thus it has a better lined up structured story.
