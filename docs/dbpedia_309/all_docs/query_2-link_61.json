        "text": "Scene 1\n\nSynopsis:\n\nOrsino, at Olivia’s estate, sends the Fool to bring Olivia to him. Antonio is brought in by officers and he tells the incredulous Orsino about Cesario’s treacherous behavior. At Olivia’s entrance, Orsino expresses his anger that Cesario has become Olivia’s darling. Cesario’s expressions of love for Orsino lead Olivia to send for the “holy father,” who confirms Olivia’s claim that she is formally betrothed to Cesario. Sir Andrew and Sir Toby enter with bloody heads, which they blame on Cesario. Sebastian’s entry at this moment untangles a series of knots: Sebastian addresses Olivia with love, greets Antonio warmly, and recognizes Cesario as the image of himself. When Cesario admits to being Sebastian’s sister Viola, Orsino asks Viola to become his wife. On the day that Sebastian marries Olivia, Viola will marry Orsino.\n\nEnter ⌜Feste, the Fool⌝ and Fabian.\n\nFABIAN 2204 Now, as thou lov’st me, let me see his letter.\n\nFOOL 2205 Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.\n\nFABIAN 2206 Anything.\n\nFOOL 2207 Do not desire to see this letter.\n\nFABIAN 2208 5This is to give a dog and in recompense desire\n\n2209 my dog again.\n\nEnter ⌜Orsino,⌝ Viola, Curio, and Lords.\n\nORSINO\n\n2210 Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?\n\nFOOL 2211 Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.\n\nORSINO\n\n2212 I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?\n\nFOOL 2213 10Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse\n\n2214 for my friends.\n\nORSINO\n\n2215 Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.\n\nFOOL 2216 No, sir, the worse.\n\nORSINO 2217 How can that be?\n\nFOOL 2218 15Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me.\n\n2219 Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by\n\n2220 my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and\n\n2221 by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to\n\n2222 be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two\n\np. 163\n\n2223 20 affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and\n\n2224 the better for my foes.\n\nORSINO 2225 Why, this is excellent.\n\nFOOL 2226 By my troth, sir, no—though it please you to be\n\n2227 one of my friends.\n\nORSINO, ⌜giving a coin⌝\n\n2228 25 Thou shalt not be the worse for me; there’s gold.\n\nFOOL 2229 But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would\n\n2230 you could make it another.\n\nORSINO 2231 O, you give me ill counsel.\n\nFOOL 2232 Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,\n\n2233 30 and let your flesh and blood obey it.\n\nORSINO 2234 Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a\n\n2235 double-dealer: there’s another.⌜He gives a coin.⌝\n\nFOOL 2236 Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old\n\n2237 saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a\n\n2238 35 good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet,\n\n2239 sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.\n\nORSINO 2240 You can fool no more money out of me at this\n\n2241 throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to\n\n2242 speak with her, and bring her along with you, it\n\n2243 40 may awake my bounty further.\n\nFOOL 2244 Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come\n\n2245 again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think\n\n2246 that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.\n\n2247 But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap. I\n\n2248 45 will awake it anon.He exits.\n\nEnter Antonio and Officers.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2249 Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.\n\nORSINO\n\n2250 That face of his I do remember well.\n\n2251 Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeared\n\n2252 As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.\n\n2253 50 A baubling vessel was he captain of,\n\np. 165\n\n2254 For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,\n\n2255 With which such scatheful grapple did he make\n\n2256 With the most noble bottom of our fleet\n\n2257 That very envy and the tongue of loss\n\n2258 55 Cried fame and honor on him.—What’s the matter?\n\nFIRST OFFICER\n\n2259 Orsino, this is that Antonio\n\n2260 That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,\n\n2261 And this is he that did the Tiger board\n\n2262 When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.\n\n2263 60 Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,\n\n2264 In private brabble did we apprehend him.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2265 He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,\n\n2266 But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.\n\n2267 I know not what ’twas but distraction.\n\nORSINO\n\n2268 65 Notable pirate, thou saltwater thief,\n\n2269 What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies\n\n2270 Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,\n\n2271 Hast made thine enemies?\n\nANTONIO 2272 Orsino, noble sir,\n\n2273 70 Be pleased that I shake off these names you give\n\n2274 me.\n\n2275 Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,\n\n2276 Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,\n\n2277 Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither.\n\n2278 75 That most ingrateful boy there by your side\n\n2279 From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth\n\n2280 Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was.\n\n2281 His life I gave him and did thereto add\n\n2282 My love, without retention or restraint,\n\n2283 80 All his in dedication. For his sake\n\n2284 Did I expose myself, pure for his love,\n\n2285 Into the danger of this adverse town;\n\n2286 Drew to defend him when he was beset;\n\np. 167\n\n2287 Where, being apprehended, his false cunning\n\n2288 85 (Not meaning to partake with me in danger)\n\n2289 Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance\n\n2290 And grew a twenty years’ removèd thing\n\n2291 While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,\n\n2292 Which I had recommended to his use\n\n2293 90 Not half an hour before.\n\nVIOLA 2294 How can this be?\n\nORSINO, ⌜to Antonio⌝ 2295 When came he to this town?\n\nANTONIO\n\n2296 Today, my lord; and for three months before,\n\n2297 No int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy,\n\n2298 95 Both day and night did we keep company.\n\nEnter Olivia and Attendants.\n\nORSINO\n\n2299 Here comes the Countess. Now heaven walks on\n\n2300 Earth!—\n\n2301 But for thee, fellow: fellow, thy words are madness.\n\n2302 Three months this youth hath tended upon me—\n\n2303 100 But more of that anon. ⌜To an Officer.⌝ Take him\n\n2304 aside.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2305 What would my lord, but that he may not have,\n\n2306 Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?—\n\n2307 Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.\n\nVIOLA 2308 105Madam?\n\nORSINO 2309 Gracious Olivia—\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2310 What do you say, Cesario?—Good my lord—\n\nVIOLA\n\n2311 My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2312 If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,\n\n2313 110 It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear\n\n2314 As howling after music.\n\np. 169\n\nORSINO\n\n2315 Still so cruel?\n\nOLIVIA 2316 Still so constant, lord.\n\nORSINO\n\n2317 What, to perverseness? You, uncivil lady,\n\n2318 115 To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\n\n2319 My soul the faithful’st off’rings have breathed out\n\n2320 That e’er devotion tendered—what shall I do?\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2321 Even what it please my lord that shall become him.\n\nORSINO\n\n2322 Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,\n\n2323 120 Like to th’ Egyptian thief at point of death,\n\n2324 Kill what I love?—a savage jealousy\n\n2325 That sometime savors nobly. But hear me this:\n\n2326 Since you to nonregardance cast my faith,\n\n2327 And that I partly know the instrument\n\n2328 125 That screws me from my true place in your favor,\n\n2329 Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.\n\n2330 But this your minion, whom I know you love,\n\n2331 And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\n\n2332 Him will I tear out of that cruel eye\n\n2333 130 Where he sits crownèd in his master’s spite.—\n\n2334 Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in\n\n2335 mischief.\n\n2336 I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love\n\n2337 To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2338 135 And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,\n\n2339 To do you rest a thousand deaths would die.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2340 Where goes Cesario?\n\nVIOLA 2341 After him I love\n\n2342 More than I love these eyes, more than my life,\n\n2343 140 More by all mores than e’er I shall love wife.\n\n2344 If I do feign, you witnesses above,\n\n2345 Punish my life for tainting of my love.\n\np. 171\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2346 Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled!\n\nVIOLA\n\n2347 Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2348 145 Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?—\n\n2349 Call forth the holy father.⌜An Attendant exits.⌝\n\nORSINO, ⌜to Viola⌝ 2350 Come, away!\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2351 Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay.\n\nORSINO\n\n2352 Husband?\n\nOLIVIA 2353 150 Ay, husband. Can he that deny?\n\nORSINO\n\n2354 Her husband, sirrah?\n\nVIOLA 2355 No, my lord, not I.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2356 Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear\n\n2357 That makes thee strangle thy propriety.\n\n2358 155 Fear not, Cesario. Take thy fortunes up.\n\n2359 Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art\n\n2360 As great as that thou fear’st.\n\nEnter Priest.\n\n2361 O, welcome, father.\n\n2362 Father, I charge thee by thy reverence\n\n2363 160 Here to unfold (though lately we intended\n\n2364 To keep in darkness what occasion now\n\n2365 Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know\n\n2366 Hath newly passed between this youth and me.\n\nPRIEST\n\n2367 A contract of eternal bond of love,\n\n2368 165 Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,\n\n2369 Attested by the holy close of lips,\n\n2370 Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,\n\n2371 And all the ceremony of this compact\n\np. 173\n\n2372 Sealed in my function, by my testimony;\n\n2373 170 Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my\n\n2374 grave\n\n2375 I have traveled but two hours.\n\nORSINO, ⌜to Viola⌝\n\n2376 O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be\n\n2377 When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?\n\n2378 175 Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow\n\n2379 That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?\n\n2380 Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet\n\n2381 Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2382 My lord, I do protest—\n\nOLIVIA 2383 180 O, do not swear.\n\n2384 Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.\n\nEnter Sir Andrew.\n\nANDREW 2385 For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one\n\n2386 presently to Sir Toby.\n\nOLIVIA 2387 What’s the matter?\n\nANDREW 2388 185Has broke my head across, and has given Sir\n\n2389 Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God,\n\n2390 your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at\n\n2391 home.\n\nOLIVIA 2392 Who has done this, Sir Andrew?\n\nANDREW 2393 190The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took\n\n2394 him for a coward, but he’s the very devil\n\n2395 incardinate.\n\nORSINO 2396 My gentleman Cesario?\n\nANDREW 2397 ’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my\n\n2398 195 head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to\n\n2399 do ’t by Sir Toby.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2400 Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.\n\n2401 You drew your sword upon me without cause,\n\n2402 But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.\n\np. 175\n\nANDREW 2403 200If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt\n\n2404 me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.\n\nEnter Toby and ⌜Feste, the Fool.⌝\n\n2405 Here comes Sir Toby halting. You shall hear\n\n2406 more. But if he had not been in drink, he would\n\n2407 have tickled you othergates than he did.\n\nORSINO 2408 205How now, gentleman? How is ’t with you?\n\nTOBY 2409 That’s all one. Has hurt me, and there’s th’ end\n\n2410 on ’t. ⌜To Fool.⌝ Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?\n\nFOOL 2411 O, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes\n\n2412 were set at eight i’ th’ morning.\n\nTOBY 2413 210Then he’s a rogue and a passy-measures pavin. I\n\n2414 hate a drunken rogue.\n\nOLIVIA 2415 Away with him! Who hath made this havoc\n\n2416 with them?\n\nANDREW 2417 I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be\n\n2418 215 dressed together.\n\nTOBY 2419 Will you help?—an ass-head, and a coxcomb,\n\n2420 and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull?\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2421 Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.\n\n⌜Toby, Andrew, Fool, and Fabian exit.⌝\n\nEnter Sebastian.\n\nSEBASTIAN\n\n2422 I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman,\n\n2423 220 But, had it been the brother of my blood,\n\n2424 I must have done no less with wit and safety.\n\n2425 You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that\n\n2426 I do perceive it hath offended you.\n\n2427 Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows\n\n2428 225 We made each other but so late ago.\n\nORSINO\n\n2429 One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!\n\n2430 A natural perspective, that is and is not!\n\np. 177\n\nSEBASTIAN\n\n2431 Antonio, O, my dear Antonio!\n\n2432 How have the hours racked and tortured me\n\n2433 230 Since I have lost thee!\n\nANTONIO\n\n2434 Sebastian are you?\n\nSEBASTIAN 2435 Fear’st thou that, Antonio?\n\nANTONIO\n\n2436 How have you made division of yourself?\n\n2437 An apple cleft in two is not more twin\n\n2438 235 Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?\n\nOLIVIA 2439 Most wonderful!\n\nSEBASTIAN, ⌜looking at Viola⌝\n\n2440 Do I stand there? I never had a brother,\n\n2441 Nor can there be that deity in my nature\n\n2442 Of here and everywhere. I had a sister\n\n2443 240 Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.\n\n2444 Of charity, what kin are you to me?\n\n2445 What countryman? What name? What parentage?\n\nVIOLA\n\n2446 Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father.\n\n2447 Such a Sebastian was my brother too.\n\n2448 245 So went he suited to his watery tomb.\n\n2449 If spirits can assume both form and suit,\n\n2450 You come to fright us.\n\nSEBASTIAN 2451 A spirit I am indeed,\n\n2452 But am in that dimension grossly clad\n\n2453 250 Which from the womb I did participate.\n\n2454 Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,\n\n2455 I should my tears let fall upon your cheek\n\n2456 And say “Thrice welcome, drownèd Viola.”\n\nVIOLA\n\n2457 My father had a mole upon his brow.\n\nSEBASTIAN 2458 255And so had mine.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2459 And died that day when Viola from her birth\n\n2460 Had numbered thirteen years.\n\np. 179\n\nSEBASTIAN\n\n2461 O, that record is lively in my soul!\n\n2462 He finishèd indeed his mortal act\n\n2463 260 That day that made my sister thirteen years.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2464 If nothing lets to make us happy both\n\n2465 But this my masculine usurped attire,\n\n2466 Do not embrace me till each circumstance\n\n2467 Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump\n\n2468 265 That I am Viola; which to confirm,\n\n2469 I’ll bring you to a captain in this town,\n\n2470 Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help\n\n2471 I was preserved to serve this noble count.\n\n2472 All the occurrence of my fortune since\n\n2473 270 Hath been between this lady and this lord.\n\nSEBASTIAN, ⌜to Olivia⌝\n\n2474 So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.\n\n2475 But nature to her bias drew in that.\n\n2476 You would have been contracted to a maid.\n\n2477 Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived:\n\n2478 275 You are betrothed both to a maid and man.\n\nORSINO, ⌜to Olivia⌝\n\n2479 Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.\n\n2480 If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\n\n2481 I shall have share in this most happy wrack.—\n\n2482 Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times\n\n2483 280 Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2484 And all those sayings will I overswear,\n\n2485 And all those swearings keep as true in soul\n\n2486 As doth that orbèd continent the fire\n\n2487 That severs day from night.\n\nORSINO 2488 285 Give me thy hand,\n\n2489 And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.\n\nVIOLA\n\n2490 The Captain that did bring me first on shore\n\np. 181\n\n2491 Hath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action,\n\n2492 Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit,\n\n2493 290 A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2494 He shall enlarge him.\n\nEnter ⌜Feste, the Fool⌝ with a letter, and Fabian.\n\n2495 Fetch Malvolio hither.\n\n2496 And yet, alas, now I remember me,\n\n2497 They say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract.\n\n2498 295 A most extracting frenzy of mine own\n\n2499 From my remembrance clearly banished his.\n\n2500 ⌜To the Fool.⌝ How does he, sirrah?\n\nFOOL 2501 Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the stave’s\n\n2502 end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here\n\n2503 300 writ a letter to you. I should have given ’t you today\n\n2504 morning. But as a madman’s epistles are no gospels,\n\n2505 so it skills not much when they are delivered.\n\nOLIVIA 2506 Open ’t and read it.\n\nFOOL 2507 Look then to be well edified, when the Fool\n\n2508 305 delivers the madman. ⌜He reads.⌝ By the Lord,\n\n2509 madam—\n\nOLIVIA 2510 How now, art thou mad?\n\nFOOL 2511 No, madam, I do but read madness.

But to read his right wits is to\n\n2516 read thus. Therefore, perpend, my princess, and\n\n2517 give ear.\n\nOLIVIA, ⌜giving letter to Fabian⌝ 2518 315Read it you, sirrah.\n\nFABIAN (reads) 2519 By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and\n\n2520 the world shall know it. Though you have put me into\n\n2521 darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over\n\n2522 me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your\n\n2523 320 Ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to\n\np. 183\n\n2524 the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but\n\n2525 to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of\n\n2526 me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of\n\n2527 and speak out of my injury.\n\n2528 325 The madly used Malvolio.\n\nOLIVIA 2529 Did he write this?\n\nFOOL 2530 Ay, madam.\n\nORSINO\n\n2531 This savors not much of distraction.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2532 See him delivered, Fabian. Bring him hither.\n\n⌜Fabian exits.⌝\n\n2533 330⌜To Orsino.⌝ My lord, so please you, these things\n\n2534 further thought on,\n\n2535 To think me as well a sister as a wife,\n\n2536 One day shall crown th’ alliance on ’t, so please\n\n2537 you,\n\n2538 335 Here at my house, and at my proper cost.\n\nORSINO\n\n2539 Madam, I am most apt t’ embrace your offer.\n\n2540 ⌜To Viola.⌝ Your master quits you; and for your\n\n2541 service done him,\n\n2542 So much against the mettle of your sex,\n\n2543 340 So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\n\n2544 And since you called me “master” for so long,\n\n2545 Here is my hand. You shall from this time be\n\n2546 Your master’s mistress.\n\nOLIVIA, ⌜to Viola⌝ 2547 A sister! You are she.\n\nEnter Malvolio ⌜and Fabian.⌝\n\nORSINO\n\n2548 345 Is this the madman?\n\nOLIVIA 2549 Ay, my lord, this same.—\n\n2550 How now, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO 2551 Madam, you have done me\n\n2552 wrong,\n\n2553 350 Notorious wrong.\n\np. 185\n\nOLIVIA 2554 Have I, Malvolio? No.\n\nMALVOLIO, ⌜handing her a paper⌝\n\n2555 Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.\n\n2556 You must not now deny it is your hand.\n\n2557 Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,\n\n2558 355 Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention.\n\n2559 You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,\n\n2560 And tell me, in the modesty of honor,\n\n2561 Why you have given me such clear lights of favor?\n\n2562 Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,\n\n2563 360 To put on yellow stockings, and to frown\n\n2564 Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?\n\n2565 And, acting this in an obedient hope,\n\n2566 Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,\n\n2567 Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,\n\n2568 365 And made the most notorious geck and gull\n\n2569 That e’er invention played on? Tell me why.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2570 Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,\n\n2571 Though I confess much like the character.\n\n2572 But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.\n\n2573 370 And now I do bethink me, it was she\n\n2574 First told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,\n\n2575 And in such forms which here were presupposed\n\n2576 Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.\n\n2577 This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee.\n\n2578 375 But when we know the grounds and authors of it,\n\n2579 Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge\n\n2580 Of thine own cause.\n\nFABIAN 2581 Good madam, hear me speak,\n\n2582 And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come\n\n2583 380 Taint the condition of this present hour,\n\n2584 Which I have wondered at. In hope it shall not,\n\n2585 Most freely I confess, myself and Toby\n\n2586 Set this device against Malvolio here,\n\n2587 Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts\n\n2588 385 We had conceived against him. Maria writ\n\np. 187\n\n2589 The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance,\n\n2590 In recompense whereof he hath married her.\n\n2591 How with a sportful malice it was followed\n\n2592 May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,\n\n2593 390 If that the injuries be justly weighed\n\n2594 That have on both sides passed.\n\nOLIVIA, ⌜to Malvolio⌝\n\n2595 Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!\n\nFOOL 2596 Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness,\n\n2597 and some have greatness thrown upon them.”\n\n2598 395 I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir,\n\n2599 but that’s all one. “By the Lord, Fool, I am not\n\n2600 mad”—but, do you remember “Madam, why laugh\n\n2601 you at such a barren rascal; an you smile not, he’s\n\n2602 gagged”? And thus the whirligig of time brings in\n\n2603 400 his revenges.\n\nMALVOLIO\n\n2604 I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you!⌜He exits.⌝\n\nOLIVIA\n\n2605 He hath been most notoriously abused.\n\nORSINO\n\n2606 Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.⌜Some exit.⌝\n\n2607 He hath not told us of the Captain yet.\n\n2608 405 When that is known, and golden time convents,\n\n2609 A solemn combination shall be made\n\n2610 Of our dear souls.—Meantime, sweet sister,\n\n2611 We will not part from hence.—Cesario, come,\n\n2612 For so you shall be while you are a man.\n\n2613 410 But when in other habits you are seen,\n\n2614 Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.\n\n⌜All but the Fool⌝ exit.\n\nFOOL sings\n\n2615 When that I was and a little tiny boy,\n\n2616 With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\n2617 A foolish thing was but a toy,\n\n2618 415 For the rain it raineth every day.\n\np. 189\n\n2619 But when I came to man’s estate,\n\n2620 With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\n2621 ’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,\n\n2622 For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n2623 420 But when I came, alas, to wive,\n\n2624 With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\n2625 By swaggering could I never thrive,\n\n2626 For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n2627 But when I came unto my beds,\n\n2628 425 With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\n2629 With tosspots still had drunken heads,\n\n2630 For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n2631 A great while ago the world begun,\n\n2632 ⌜With⌝ hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\n2633 430 But that’s all one, our play is done,\n\n2634 And we’ll strive to please you every day.\n\n⌜He exits.⌝"
