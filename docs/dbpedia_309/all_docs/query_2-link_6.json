I've honestly never seen anything like this. I guess all I can say is it feels like Resnais, Buñuel and Jodorowsky were just playing with things they didn't really understand - or simply dipping their toe into the lake. Raoul Ruiz, the director of this film, doesn't just jump into the lake, he fucking reigns beneath it like some prehistoric water demon.\n\nNot…\n\nThree Crowns of the Sailor is a film that exists in drunken memories, perhaps in dreams, having been passed on from one sailor to another, elaborated into legend; stories of treasure and debts, and others of treason and death, these are tales that go on being told long after the teller has died.\n\nRaúl Ruiz spins these tales with the slippery logic of nightmares: a woman with only one orifice (her mouth, if you must know); sailors who defecate by sweating worms; doppelgängers and preternatural children; ghost ships that sink and resurface…\n\nThe tales swirl around each other, with their mood held constant by the gently waltzing score. They summon the ghosts of the dead. Their stories are immortal while…\n\nThis is the kind of film that showcases how masterful Raúl Ruiz was. This film is flawless in terms of visual storytelling. Beautiful shots all over, with colours that reminded me of silent films when they were completely tintetd in red or blue. If his other films showed how much he likes deep-focus shot (but is it really deep-focus? Does someone know the name of these kind of shots?), in this one he is telling us that he finds them to be the best cinema has to offer. He even manages to put us in a first-person point of view in a very natural but also bizarre way.\n\nIt is a disorienting tale, courtesy of a drunk (or not so…"
