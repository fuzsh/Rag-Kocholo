        "text": "January 1st, 2023\n\nSubtronic Lionfish Anilao, Philippines On this blackwater dive, Mike Bartick used multiple strobe flashes triggered from an initial strobe flash\n\nText by Stephen Frink; captions by Mike Bartick\n\nWHEN MIKE BARTICK GOES TO HIS 40-YEAR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION in a couple of years, he’ll have to explain how a Southern California kid ended up living mainly in the Philippines and becoming one of the world’s most innovative marine life photographers. His trajectory will be one of a kind for the class of ’85 — barely relatable, yet endlessly fascinating.\n\nThe story will be about his dad, a Navy sailor in World War II who moved from Detroit, Michigan, to Westminster, California, to be closer to the ocean. Trips in the family car to Huntington Beach as a kid instilled in Mike a calling to the sea. These were different, perhaps less dangerous times, but when he was only 8 years old he’d hop on the bus to Huntington, where he would body surf and swim. As he got a little older, his bike was his passport to beach adventure, and he would snorkel around Laguna Beach and boogie board at the iconic surf break known as the Wedge.\n\nHe constantly searched the water for the coral reefs he saw in National Geographic, not knowing there was a difference between tropical and temperate habitats. When his family went to Hawai‘i for a summer vacation, he had his epiphany. Warm, clear waters were different — not necessarily better, as he loved his California backyard, but a world unlike what he knew. He tried to tell the tale with his Minolta Weathermatic 110 film camera to predictably miserable results.\n\nCousteau’s documentaries and Sea Hunt were before his time, but books and magazines depicting the underwater world captured his attention. For no apparent reason that his parents could ever deduce, he often walked around the house making the sound of exhaust bubbles. Mike contends that “whatever it is, it’s always been there.”\n\nMe on a Boat Anilao, Philippines. My buddy Tobias Friedrich snapped a photo of me while we were having fun and talking about the previous dive. I’m holding my simple macro kit: 105mm lens, strobes, diopter, and float arms. TOBIAS FRIEDRICH\n\nWhatever “it” was evolved slowly. For 20 years Mike had a career as a chef. It was so stressful that his friends told him he needed to do something to take the edge off, and one of their suggestions was to go to Catalina and try diving. Once underwater, an aura of peace enveloped him. He started going to Shaw’s Cove in Laguna Beach every day after work. When he found his first nudibranch, he thought he had discovered a new species. While that was not the case, he describes the experience as his “gateway drug.”\n\nSeeking like-minded enthusiasts, he joined a dive club and wanted to share underwater photos. The $10,000 Nikon RS he coveted was beyond his grasp, but a 3-megapixel Sony digital was attainable, so he got his first digital camera. It didn’t have any strobes, but he didn’t know what they were for anyway. One of his early shots was of a bat ray swimming through the kelp. He showed it to his friends on the boat, one of whom passed it on to California Diving News. They ran it, so by 2004 he was a published underwater photographer.\n\nIn those early years, around 2005, Mike shot a lot of macro images. Captioning them meant improving his writing skills and researching more about his subjects. He started understanding that the best behavioral shots were from people who understood their subjects’ habits and habitats. To be a better photographer, he learned to be a better naturalist.\n\nTorpedo Ray Catalina, California\n\nA confident electric torpedo ray hovers in the light current above a pinnacle at Farnsworth Banks. These torpedo rays and the purple hydrocorals make this remote dive spot popular. MIKE BARTICK\n\nI know you primarily for your work from the Coral Triangle, particularly in the Philippines. How did your transition there from Southern California happen?\n\nBy 2006 I was already obsessed with photography, and I was making money as a chef, so I could afford to travel to new and exotic dive destinations to practice my craft. I went to Indonesia, and Lembeh was my first love. It was heaven for a critter enthusiast, and the thought consumed me that one day I could live somewhere like that and shoot every day.\n\nDid you find a market for the photos you were shooting back then?\n\nI had a good relationship with California Diving News, so I asked them if I could write a travel feature. Their editor told me, “We love your photography, but if you want to be a writer, you have to practice every day.” The writing was never as easy as photography, but I wrote every day and recognized that being able to package words and photos was important.\n\nLiving nine months of the year in Anilao, Philippines, and being a partner and operations supervisor at Crystal Blue Resort seems a long way from recreational diving in Lembeh.\n\nI raved so much about how good Lembeh was that one of my friends told me to try Anilao for a change of pace. It was 2007, and there weren’t a lot of international divers going there yet, but it was remarkably accessible. The ease of travel was promising. Then I went diving and was blown away. The wide-angle and macro opportunities were off the charts!\n\nMy catering business in California was going well, but the more it grew, the more I was stressed and wanted to be underwater. Diving and photography were cathartic, and I kept coming back to Anilao in my mind. What if I could build a comfortable resort with a dedicated camera room, great food, and world-class guides, like the resorts I’d enjoyed in Lembeh? I wanted to create that kind of operation in the Philippines but needed the right ingredients to come together.\n\nIn 2010 it all fell into place. The Philippines Department of Tourism sent me on a junket to dive around the country, during which I met my girlfriend. The emotional and professional ties were growing, then I stumbled upon Crystal Blue, an already-charming leisure resort with a modest dive concession. Anilao was a diamond in the rough, but I saw the potential.\n\nLemon Gobies Anilao, Philippines\n\nI enjoy combining different gadgets to create fun images. Like a secret ingredient in any recipe, the unique addition should accentuate but not overpower the main element. MIKE BARTICK"
