        "text": "Want to add more pizzazz to your upcoming party? Here’s how: pick a theme!\n\nAnd yes, themes work just as great for grown-up parties as they do for kids’ parties! Whether you’re planning a birthday celebration, a baby shower or literally any other type of party, having a theme is an easy way to make it fun and unique.\n\nTo give you some inspiration, we’ve compiled a list of 170 trending party themes for adults that you need to try in 2024!\n\nOur ideas are organised into categories, so you can jump right to the one you’re most interested in. So without further ado, let’s dive right in!\n\n🕰️ Decade Themes\n\nA classic among themes: pick your favourite decade/time period and let your party be a time machine that takes you and your guests on a nostalgic adventure.\n\n1. Roaring 20s Party\n\nWomen in shimmery cocktail dresses, feathery boas and velvet gloves. Men wearing three-piece suits and fedoras. This is the Prohbition era, so you’ll have to keep your party a secret!\n\n2. 1930s Party\n\nGet your guests to dress up in their best flapper dresses and suits, hang up some Art Deco posters, and play some jazz classics (think Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong) to set the right mood.\n\n3. 1940s Party\n\nThere’s plenty of inspiration from this era! Pin-up girls, war-themed imagery, Glenn Miller, and Casablanca… Pick and choose! Must include: sodas in glass bottles and cocktails such as Cuba Libre, Sidecars or daiquiris.\n\n4. Vintage 50s Theme\n\nThe 1950s are the era of rock and roll, swing, poodle skirts and bowling shirts. So, make a 50s-inspired playlist and invite your guests to a sock-hop!\n\n5. Retro 60s Party\n\nIf you’re planning a 60s-inspired soiree, revolution and freedom is the perfect theme. And don’t forget about music! Let the sounds of The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones fill your dance floor as you celebrate life.\n\n6. 70s Party\n\nThe 70s were still about freedom and self-expression. Go for bright colours (such as yellow, orange and blue), and use balloons and disco balls to transform your party space.\n\n7. 80s Party\n\nThe 80s were a magical time. Think of it: mullets and leg warmers, Atari and Pac-Man, Madonna, and Michael Jackson.\n\n8. 90s Party\n\nThe 90s were an exceptional time for music, movies, and TV. It was the decade of grunge rock, and boy bands, but it also gave us some of the best cartoons on television. Nothing beats the 90s for a fun and nostalgic celebration!\n\n9. 2000s Party\n\nSome believed we’d be travelling to space by 2000. Or that the world would end. None of this happened, but we did see the rise of technology and social media. The pop culture of the time was full of bright colours, big hair, and loud music – and everything about that is perfect for a great party.\n\n🎬 Movie Themes\n\nYou’ll find tons of inspiration on the big screen. Why not pick your favourite movie as a theme? Here are some of the most popular ideas:\n\n10. Harry Potter\n\nGive your guests a lesson in magic with a party they’ll never forget! Serve some butterbeer and pumpkin pasties, host a potions-making class and have your guests play a game of Quidditch with brooms and tennis balls – the options are plentiful!\n\n11. Star Wars\n\nWhether you’re throwing a birthday party or just having a Star Wars-themed gathering, there are plenty of ways to bring the Force to your celebration. Have a dance-off between Jedi Knights versus Sith Lords. Sip on Jedi Juice and Padawan Punch. Don’t forget the cookies.\n\n12. Mamma Mia\n\nBlue & white colour scheme, Greek food and some ABBA in the background – here’s your recipe for an amazing Mamma Mia-themed party.\n\n13. Bollywood\n\nThe perfect theme if you’re looking for something colourful and vibrant. Dress up as your favourite Bollywood star or character and dance the night away!\n\n14. Lord of the Rings\n\nSend out invitations with the names of your guests written in Elvish. Decorate with plenty of green and brown, as well as some silver and gold accents. For food, get creative and include dishes such as hobbit stew, elven bread, or orc meatballs.\n\n15. Breakfast at Tiffany’s\n\nMaybe you can’t have breakfast at Tiffany’s, but you can emulate the vibe. Think luxury and elegance. Keep the decor simple with a few Tiffany blue items to make a statement. Time to dress in chic clothes and sip on some mimosas!\n\n16. The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nA mix of purple, orange and black and white stripes, plus some fake bats, pumpkins and skulls. Now that’s a party Jack Skellington would be proud of! This theme will work especially well for parties that fall around Halloween or Christmas.\n\n17. Oscars Night\n\nOscars Night is a great theme for a party. You can watch the awards together and then celebrate by having a party. The Oscars are always full of great fashion, so use this as inspiration for your own outfits. You can also make a themed menu that includes dishes with names like ‘Best Actor’ or ‘Best Actress’.\n\n18. Marvel\n\nThe Marvel universe is full of iconic characters. Whether you want to go all out with an Avengers-themed party or keep things simple with something like Spiderman, there are plenty of options available. You can also let your guests pick their favourite characters and try to impersonate them for the party.\n\n19. Batman\n\nIt’s a bird, it’s a plane…it’s Batman!

Anyone who enjoys a touch of the weird and absurd will love this theme.\n\n21. James Bond\n\nNo list of movie-inspired themes could be complete without the iconic secret agent! There’s so much you can do with the James Bond theme: you can host a Casino Royale night or, if you’re having a ladies’ night, go with a Bond Girls party! And, of course, you must serve Vesper Martinis, shaken not stirred.\n\n22. Grease\n\nGrease is such an iconic film that people who grew up in the 70s and 80s still know all of the words to the songs. Decorate with lots of colours like reds, yellows and oranges, so it looks like it came straight out of the movie set. Play music from the movie throughout the night so people can dance and sing along.\n\n📺 TV Show Themes\n\nSmall-screen hits offer plenty of inspiration, too! Check our suggestions or just go with your favourite TV show.\n\n23. Friends\n\nDecorate with yellow and purple balloons, streamers and posters with quotes from the show like ‘Pivot!’, ‘We were on a break!’ or ‘He’s her lobster’. Include plenty of 90s pop culture references. For food, you can make a list of things that each character would have in their fridge and ask the guests to bring them along.\n\n24. Euphoria\n\nFind a party space with neon colours, LED lights and, ideally, some black lights to top it off. Tell everyone to wear black light reactive and sparkly clothes. Don’t forget to go all out with makeup – the more glitter, the better!\n\n25. Stranger Things\n\nChristmas lights are used throughout the series to represent the portals between worlds, so they should be an essential part of your Stranger Things-themed party! Play ‘Should I Stay or Should I Go?’ by the Clash on repeat while people are arriving (spoiler alert: they should stay).\n\n26. The Office\n\nThe Office theme is easy to pull off and can be customised in any way you want. And it’s perfect for office parties, duh!

Bridgerton\n\nReady to travel back to Regency England? Host an elegant afternoon tea party or throw a distinguished ball. Don’t forget to dress the part! For this one night, you’re all lords and ladies. To complete the party, put the Bridgerton soundtrack in the background, and you’re all set!\n\n28. The Big Bang Theory\n\nChoose decorations that represent the show’s characters: Howard’s love of outer space, Leonard’s intelligence and Sheldon’s love of comic books are all things you can incorporate into your decorating scheme.\n\n29. How I Met Your Mother\n\nMake invitations with pictures of each character on them along with their catchphrases like ‘Suit up!’ or ‘Zip it!’. At the party, you can have each guest tell their favourite date story as their ‘How I Met Your Mother’ story.\n\n30. Westworld\n\nWhat would it be like to act out your darkest fantasies with robots on the frontier of a dangerous, Wild West-style world?

Hang up a few animal masks, cowboy hats and toy guns to make your guests feel like they’re on the set of the show.\n\n31.

You can also set up a buffet table in Winterfell style, with long candles and plenty of food for your guests to enjoy.\n\n32. Wednesday\n\nAt some point, we all got sick of that particular dance routine that flooded TikTok. Nevertheless, Wednesday – or the Addams family in general – is a cool party inspiration. Decorate with black balloons, streamers and paper cut-outs of bats and spider webs and have your guests dress in black and white only. To complete the theme, serve foods like black spaghetti with red sauce or eyeball cake pops.\n\n33. The Walking Dead\n\nA great idea for your party is to have a ‘You’re Dead’ theme, where everyone dresses up as their favourite zombie who died in the show and then come back for revenge. Try to give your venue a post-apocalyptic look. You can use fake blood and props such as severed heads and brains on sticks.\n\n34. Star Trek\n\nCreate an ‘away mission’ by setting up snacks in different areas around your home or venue so that people have to explore to find them all! Try making ‘alien’ food like green gelatin salad or blue Jell-O shots. Alternatively, invite your guests to a game of laser tag!\n\n35. Orange Is the New Black\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when thinking about an OITNB party theme is the colour orange itself. So why not start by picking up some orange decorations and items like plates, cups and napkins? Of course, everyone has to wear orange to the party! If you’re feeling extra, you could buy or rent a prison jumpsuit costume. To top it off, set up a photo booth where you can take your mug shots and pose with handcuffs and prison bars.\n\n36. Riverdale\n\nA great theme for fans of the show and anyone who loves drama, suspense and intrigue. You could have a Riverdale High-themed party or go for a murder mystery party.

Sherlock\n\nFor a Sherlock-themed dinner party, serve up some delicious British food such as fish and chips or traditional English meat pies with gravy. You could also serve tea and cakes after dinner! If you’d rather go for a cocktail party, try to create a signature cocktail based on one of the characters in the show.\n\n39. Breaking Bad\n\nPlay a chemist and experiment with blue substances 😉 Have some blue rock candy on hand that looks like crystal meth and make some cocktails with blue curacao. You could even make blue jello shots! Serve Cheetos as a snack, Heisenburgers as the main meal, and then some cupcakes with blue icing for dessert.\n\n40. Suits\n\nWell, you already know what your dress code is going to be. Pretend that everyone at your party is a successful lawyer who can talk their way out of any situation. Get your guests to wear matching ties or, quite the contrary, have a crazy tie competition (DIY ideas are most welcome!).\n\n41. You\n\nHave you already seen the fourth season of You? Joe Goldberg’s new London friends were hardly likeable, but they sure knew how to have an extravagant party. There’s plenty of inspiration there. Unless you’d rather go for the creepy psychopath vibe – we won’t judge!\n\n42. Doctor Who\n\nEver wished you could travel in time and save the world again and again from alien creatures? Then a Doctor Who-themed party is for you! You can base your theme around a specific episode, or just use the show as a general inspiration. Play some Time Lord rock and get this party started!\n\n43. Peaky Blinders\n\nA Peaky Blinders party is a great excuse to get everyone dressed up. Even those of your guests who are not big fans of the show can have fun completing outfits that reflect 1900s England. When it comes to the party space, go for the speakeasy vibe.\n\n44. The Crown\n\nThis theme is great not just for fans of the British Royal Family. After all, who wouldn’t want to feel like royalty at their party?

Club Night\n\nWhat’s more fun than going out to a club and partying with your friends all night long? To make the most out of the experience, remember to book a nightclub in advance. If you can’t decide on one place, you could always plan a club crawl!\n\n54. Latino Night\n\nHire a DJ who will play all sorts of music from salsa, merengue and bachata to electronica and reggaeton.

Grammys\n\nThe prestigious awards show can make a great theme for your next party!

Ball Gowns & Black Tie\n\nBlack tie and ball gowns are the perfect combination of elegance, glamour and sophistication.

You could combine it with a cosy movie night, with hot chocolate and caramel-flavoured popcorn.\n\n68. Unicorn Theme\n\nUnicorns are real and you can’t convince us otherwise. Use balloons in different colours such as hot pink, purple, blue, yellow and lavender. Tinsel garlands, glitter and rainbow confetti are also great ideas! For snacks, go with unicorn-shaped cookies, unicorn cake pops or unicorn cupcakes.\n\n69. Pirate Theme\n\nWhether it’s dressing up as Captain Hook or simply walking around with an eye patch, pirates add excitement to any party!

Barbie Theme\n\nI’m a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world / Life in plastic, it’s fantastic. One thing’s for sure: there has to be a lot of pink. Think pink balloons, streamers, banners, etc. And how about a pink and white candy buffet table filled with lollipops, suckers, gumballs, bubblegum and other treats? You could also get pink glasses for drinks.\n\n71. Cowboy/Cowgirl Party\n\nYou’re never too old to play dress-up, so have fun assembling your cowboy or cowgirl attire!

You can decorate your house or party venue with items such as horseshoes and lassos, as well as some black-and-white western-style prints.\n\n72. Princess Party\n\nFor this theme, turn your party space into a castle by hanging up flags and banners with gold trimmings.

Dinosaur Party\n\nThink a dinosaur-themed party is good for kids only? Well, Ross Geller would strongly disagree! For this theme, transport your guests to Jurassic Park. Get dinosaur-shaped helium balloons or letter balloons that spell out ‘RAWR’. Hand out dinosaur party hats and engage your guests in Jurassic Park trivia!\n\n74. Space-Themed Party\n\nFor an out-of-this-world party, decorate your venue with planets, stars and moons, or try to turn it into a spaceship! Use blue, purple, black and silver as your colour scheme.

All-White Party\n\nThis one is a fantastic choice for winter parties but will work equally well in other seasons. The idea is quite simple: just ask your guests to wear white! To complete the theme, you can also decorate with white items such as balloons, flowers, streamers or anything else you can think of.\n\n85. All-Black Party\n\nI’ll stop wearing black when they make a darker colour. The perfect theme for all the rebels out there, as well as everyone who – like Wednesday Addams – is allergic to colour. If you want to go all out, you could also serve black foods like black burgers and hot dogs, black pasta or dark chocolate cake for dessert.\n\n86. Rose Gold\n\nThe luxurious, warm-toned gold will be perfect for engagement parties, bridal showers, weddings and other special occasions.

Garden Party\n\nSpring is an amazing time for garden parties!

For the menu, go with seafood (or its vegan-friendly alternatives).\n\n101. Beach Party\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you go to an actual beach or simply pick up some beach-themed decor items, a beach party is the easiest way to achieve the ultimate summer vibe. If you’re outdoors, engage your guests in some fun activities, such as beach ball, or just relax in the shade and sip on your cocktails.\n\n102.

BBQ\n\nBBQ is one of the most popular themes for a summer party! If you are hosting it outdoors we recommend planning your menu ahead of time and asking everyone in attendance to bring their favourite side dish or dessert. That way you don’t have to worry about preparing everything yourself.\n\n110. Picnic\n\nThis is a classic idea for any summer party – after all, the warm months are the perfect time to have a picnic. Pack a blanket and a basket full of delicious treats, and find a shaded outdoor area for a lovely time with friends.\n\n111.

Orange\n\nOrange is one of the colours associated with fall, so why not work it into your theme?

Glitter\n\nIn winter, when days are typically shorter and darker, we’re obsessed with everything that can brighten our moods! Repeat after us: No amount of glitter is too much! We give you full permission to go overboard – make sure glitter is EVERYWHERE! Table decorations, hair, clothes, makeup – nothing is off limits!\n\n126.

Stripes\n\nRed and white stripes bring to mind candy canes and make the perfect theme for this year’s winter party! Of course, you don’t have to stick with red and white – feel free to pick other colours. You can have your guests wear striped clothes, set the table with a striped tablecloth, and hang up some striped bunting flags. If you don’t want to go with candy canes, you could bake a zebra cake!\n\n129. Silver & Gold\n\nSilver and gold are such festive colours, don’t you agree? They’re glamorous, timeless, and versatile. They will add a touch of elegance to any party. You don’t have to go over the top; a few silver and gold accents will be enough. Hang up sparkly balloons in clusters around the room or along the tables. Streamers are another great way to add some shimmer to your party without spending too much money.\n\n130. Fairy Lights\n\nWinter festivities are synonymous with lights. Lights everywhere. Everything has to be bright and colourful! You can keep it subtle or go crazy – think Griswold-style. Make your party so blinding that your guests will have to wear sunglasses (just kidding… or are we?).\n\n131. New Year’s Eve\n\nA New Year’s Eve party is a great opportunity to express your gratitude for the year that’s passed and look into the future with hope.

Rio de Janeiro-Inspired Carnival\n\nA Carnival-themed party is a great way to bring excitement and energy to any celebration! Hang up plenty of streamers, balloons and glittery things.

Party Circus\n\nDecorate with bright colours and ask everyone to dress in circus-inspired clothes.

You could even have a ringmaster announce each guest as they arrive at the door.\n\n137. Fun Fair Theme\n\nThrow a party with games, rides, and all the fun of a fair. Use bright colours and have ‘tickets’ to win prizes. Set up a photo booth where guests can take photos with funny props (you don’t even have to buy anything – feel free to DIY them!). For food, you can’t go wrong with pizza or hot dogs!\n\n138. Christmas in July\n\nIf you’re suffering through another heatwave and pining after those snowy days of winter, here’s an idea to help you cool off: have a Christmas in July!

TikTok Theme Party\n\nTikTok is a goldmine for party ideas, so get on the app and see if anything inspires you! Or throw a party centred around TikTok! Use pink, aqua and black as your colour scheme. During the party, make videos recreating different TikTok trends. Find out who of your guests can perform the perfect dance routine!\n\n140. Under the Sea\n\nAny lovers of marine life here? Host an under-the-sea party! Blue colours and marine-themed decor, such as dolphin-shaped balloons, paper fish and seashells could be a simple interpretation of this theme. But why not go all out and book a jaw-dropping venue?!\n\n141. Moulin Rouge\n\nThis theme is classy and elegant, but also fun and flirty. The dress code should be formal attire such as tuxedos and ball gowns. Of course, there is no Moulin Rouge without music and dancing! Take some inspiration from 2001’s movie Moulin Rouge! and use its soundtrack as your playlist for the night.\n\n142. Enchanted Forest\n\nSpend a magical night in the enchanted forest! You could turn this into a party inspired by Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream. Transport your guests into the forests of Fairy Land, using lots of items from nature such as pine cones, leaves and acorns. Fresh flowers are also a must! For that magical ambiance, hang up paper lanterns and add twinkle lights at night for extra sparkle!\n\n143. Denim & Diamonds\n\nThe denim and diamonds theme is the perfect choice for a ladies night out. It will work great for events such as birthday parties, bridal showers or hens/bachelorette parties. All you need is some jeans and some (fake) diamonds – the more bling, the better!\n\n144. Mafia/Gangster Theme\n\nThe main idea behind this theme is a group of people dressed up as gangsters and mobsters, so have your guests dress up in suits and tuxedos and channel their inner Sopranos. If you’re wondering about the perfect venue, you could throw the party in an old-fashioned speakeasy or hire an authentic Italian restaurant with those signature red-chequered tablecloths.\n\n145. Spy-Themed Party\n\nSummon your guests to a top-secret meeting at a secret venue! If you’d like to incorporate some fun activities, make a fake training camp where the guests can go through a few tests and learn how to be a spy. You could have different stations set up with different challenges that they must complete in order to pass out of training.\n\n146. Drag Queen\n\nFor this theme, you’ll want to go all out with your costumes and makeup. You can dress like your favourite drag queen or take inspiration from some of the most famous queens from RuPaul’s Drag Race. Don’t know where to start? YouTube is filled with makeup tutorials that you can try to recreate for the party.\n\n147. Galaxy Theme\n\nUse black, purple and blue as your colour scheme. Add glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling or a black backdrop, or hang balloons filled with confetti that look like stars. You could also go all out and buy a galaxy projector. Looking for something that will absolutely dazzle your guests? Make these cupcakes with swirls of galaxy frosting and star sprinkles. Yum!\n\n148. Dress-Up/Costume Party\n\nThe best parties are the ones that really reflect your personality. This theme can be anything you want, so let your imagination run wild! Have your guests pick their own costumes, then try to guess who everyone is dressed as. You can even hold a little competition with fun prizes for the best costumes.\n\n149. Movie Night\n\nA simple theme that you can easily execute at home, with popcorn, cosy blankets and a marathon of your favourite movies. But what if you could have a cinema all to yourself? Well, you can! Book a private screening room and take your movie night to the next level.\n\n150. Surprise Party\n\nA classic idea that can be a lot of fun if executed well! Just make sure your guest of honour is fond of surprises, and prepare a plan on how to keep them in the dark about the party! For more tips and ideas, check out our blog article about surprise parties.\n\n151. Back to School\n\nDo you ever find yourself feeling nostalgic about your teenage years? Why not relive some of those memories? For this theme, dress as you would have back in high school! This could also be a Back to Prom party, where you recreate a high school prom night. Let’s travel down the memory lane and cringe at the fashion choices you made as a teenager.\n\n152. Old People Party\n\nFor this one, let’s look into the future. Try to picture an older version of you. How will you dress? What will be your quirks? How will you be spending your retirement? Now bring your inner grandma or grandpa to life and invite them to the party! Play some bingo, compliment your guests on their beautiful grey hair, and party like it’s your last day – to the fullest!\n\n153. Medieval Party\n\nKings and queens, princes and princesses, knights in shining armours. There’s courtly love, intrigues, and adventurous quests. If you enjoyed tales of Sir Lancelot and Guinevere or the Knights of the Round Table, this theme is for you. Turn your party space into a castle with props such as royal banners, knight gear and candelabras. Serve drinks in ornamental goblets, and have fun dressing up!\n\n154. Country Western Party\n\nDecorate your venue with cowboy hats, horseshoes, and other western-themed decorations like cowhide rugs or wagon wheels and transport your guests to the Wild West! Set up a bar where guests can enjoy drinks such as whiskey sours or whiskey gingers. You could also serve shots of moonshine along with other hard liquor drinks like tequila or vodka.\n\n155. Kitsch/Tacky\n\nThe kitschiest, tackiest party ideas are a fun way to liven up any gathering. They’re all about having fun with cheesy decorations and over-the-top outfits. It’s the perfect theme if you want to have some laughs and make your guests feel comfortable.\n\n156. TV Game Show\n\nDecorate the party room so that it looks like a television studio. You could even get giant cardboard cutouts of famous television game show hosts such as Richard Dawson or Bob Barker. Prizes are an important part of any game show, so make sure to prepare something for the winner(s)!\n\n⚽ Sports Themes\n\nSports-themed parties are an awesome option for all sports geeks, but also anyone who wants to incorporate a fun activity into their party. Here are some of our favourite ideas!\n\n157. Favourite Team Colours\n\nThis one’s pretty straightforward – if you have a favourite sports theme, you can use their colours as your theme. Get balloons, banners and streamers that match the colour scheme. And don’t forget to wear your team colours to the party!\n\n158. Dress Up as Your Favourite Sports Person\n\nAgain, this theme is rather self-explanatory. Let everyone choose who they want to be for the evening, be it a famous footballer, basketball player or figure skater. At the party, try to guess who’s impersonating whom. You can also have a best costume contest (remember to prepare a prize beforehand!).\n\n159. Ping Pong\n\nHow about a friendly game of table tennis? (Or not so friendly if you’re competitive like Monica and Mike from Friends). Book a table and test your skills! Warning: it may get heated. Alternatively, you can switch ping pong for beer pong.\n\n160. Golf\n\nIt’s up to you how literally you want to treat each theme. If you’re throwing a party for an avid golfer, you may want to incorporate some golf-themed decorations and foods shaped like golf balls and clubs. You could also book an actual golf course or, alternatively, hire a mini golf venue to have a fun-filled day with your guests!\n\n161. Billiards\n\nBilliards is a great idea for a fun and relaxed evening with friends or colleagues. You can compete against one another or play in teams to make it a team building exercise. It doesn’t matter if you’re good at the actual game, all that counts is simply having fun!\n\n162. Darts\n\nThis is an all-time party classic. You shouldn’t have a problem finding a bar in your location that features a dart board. If you’re feeling extra, you could even buy one and have a darts tournament at home. We do recommend heading to a bar though, for the ambiance – and the drinks, of course!\n\n163. Axe Throwing\n\nAxe throwing is an activity that’s been gaining popularity recently. Why is it a good theme for your party? It’s an excellent way to blow off some steam and makes for an unforgettable experience for all party attendees! Axe throwing venues have their own coaches who will show you the right throwing techniques and make sure everyone is having fun in a safe way.\n\n164. Arcade Games\n\nWant to bring a retro vibe to your upcoming party? Surprise your guests with a night of classic arcade games! Tip: if you’re a large group, make sure you book a venue ahead of time, so you can actually enjoy the games without having to wait in line.\n\n🍷 Food/Drink-Based Themes\n\nEveryone knows that food and drinks are one of the core elements of almost every social gathering. Why not make them the focal point of your party and base your theme around them?\n\n165. Wine Tasting\n\nA wine tasting is a fun and elegant way to celebrate any special occasion. It’s also a treat to those who want to learn about the process of making wine and find out how to tell the difference between all the flavours. So, find a local winery and book a delicious experience for you and your guests.\n\n166. Craft Beer\n\nSomething for those who are not much into wine, but prefer a good ol’ pint. You could take your guests for a tour at a local brewery, where you will learn all about making beer and taste some brews. If there are no breweries nearby, simply book a bar where you can taste different types of craft beer.\n\n167. Mexican Theme Party\n\nHow about a traditional fiesta party? It’s a great way to liven up your next event, indulge in delicious cuisine and celebrate Mexican culture. Decorate your space with colourful papel picado, flag banners and string lights. Snack on tacos and nachos, sip on margaritas and have fun breaking a piñata!\n\n168. Candy Land\n\nNow, something for everyone with a sweet tooth. For the ultimate effect, incorporate candy-themed decorations like cupcake-shaped pillows, lollipop balloons or ice cream-patterned napkins. Go for bright, pastel colours. If you want something simple, book a cute cafe and enjoy some fresh pies or throw a house party and ask each guest to bring their favourite dessert. We’re salivating at the mere thought!\n\n169. Doughnut Theme\n\nPlump dough, sweet filling and a shiny glaze – what’s not to love? So why not base your theme around this delicious treat? For starters, you must serve doughnuts (or ‘donuts’ if you’re in the US) with different fillings and icing. To create the perfect vibe, use pastel-coloured decorations and doughnut-shaped balloons. Hint: this theme is amazing if you want to throw a ‘donut grow up’ birthday party!\n\n170. Bake-Off/Cook-Off\n\nBake-offs and cook-offs are a fun way to get your guests involved in the party, try out new recipes and exercise their creativity! If you want to make it even more fun, add a competition element! Set up a panel of judges who will score all of the entries. Use any criteria you want, such as taste or presentation, and award prizes for best overall and best in each category (e.g. best cupcake, best main dish, etc.).\n\nI’ve Picked My Theme, Now What?\n\nYou’ve found an idea on our list that is just perfect for the party that you’re planning. Awesome! That’s half the success. Now decide how you want to execute this idea.\n\nDecorations\n\nWith popular themes, you’ll have no trouble finding cheap supplies online that will help you effortlessly transform your party space. You could also go the DIY route and make all the decorations from scratch. It doesn’t have to be anything extra elaborate. It’s all about the details! Sometimes picking up a few items in matching colours and an attention-grabbing centrepiece is all it takes.\n\nDress Code\n\nDoes your theme require a specific dress code? Do you expect your guests to turn up wearing costumes, should everyone dress formally, or are your guests allowed to choose whatever clothes they please? Don’t forget to include this information in your invitations!\n\nFood & Drinks\n\nWhen it comes to planning the menu, the Internet is bursting with easy-to-prepare themed recipes that will no doubt wow your guests. However, if you don’t want to have to prepare everything yourself, a good idea is to host a potluck party, where everyone brings a dish to share. You could also book a professional venue with catering.\n\nWhere Do I Get the Supplies?\n\nThere is no need to spend a fortune on supplies and decorations! Depending on the theme of your choice, you can try your luck in local thrift stores – you never know what kind of wonders you’ll find there!\n\nIf you’re looking for budget-friendly options, ask around and see if you can borrow some items from friends or family.
