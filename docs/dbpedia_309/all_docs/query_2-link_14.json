        "text": "Jackets were blue woolen broadcloth commonly called \"round\" jackets because the largest measurement was \"round\" the body. Buttons were flat white or yellow metal.\n\nA vest, also known as a waistcoat, was made of blue or red wool on all sides. It was single-breasted with a standing collar and side pockets.\n\nTrousers were made of either white linen duck or blue wool. They sat high on the waist, which required suspenders to hold them up. They fit the leg closely and were cut for ease of movement. The trousers seen here are \"slops.\"\n\nSlops: Simple checked cotton shirts and white cotton or linen trousers were sold aboard the ship by the purser and known as slops. These were considered the daily working uniform that were meant to protect clothing sailors brought with them or to replace clothing damaged or destroyed through hard use.\n\nAlso called neck cloths, handkerchiefs were worn wrapped around the high shirt collar or loosely around the neck. They were often made of black silk, but sometimes of colored or patterned fabric.\n\nGeneral and landing party dress:\n\nThe collar, also known as a tar flap, was a holdover from an earlier era when men had long hair that was tied back with tar or grease. The collar protected the uniform from dirt and grime.\n\nNeckerchiefs made of silk were worn as head coverings or used to muffle the sound of guns.\n\nA rope lanyard was worn around the neck or waist to carry a boatswain's whistle or a jackknife (folding blade with clipped point to impede use in fights). The lanyard kept the items from dropping to the deck when sailors worked aloft (areas above the deck).\n\nGeneral dress:\n\nA short wool jacket had small gold-colored buttons; many veteran petty officers' buttons had Navy insignia, per 1841 regulations. These were similar in appearance to the War of 1812 jacket.\n\nA wool blue pullover shirt called a jumper was worn underneath and tucked into trousers.\n\nTrousers were blue wool and adorned with buttons. They were wide-legged or bell-bottomed so they could be pulled up when cleaning or doing work on the deck.\n\nLanding party dress:\n\nThis was similar to general dress, except men were outfitted with a belt, cutlass, pistol and cartridge box with ammunition. Depending on the weather, they could take their jackets off and just wear the jumper.\n\nSummer dress: (not pictured)\n\nIn the heat, a white jumper made of a cooler canvas/linen material was substituted; often, the sleeves and collar were made of denim in varying shades of blue. Also, a white cover went over the blue top of the general dress cap.\n\nThe collar and neckerchief were a holdover tradition from the Civil War. At sea, the undress uniform was often worn. It was similar to the dress jumper but omitted the neckerchief and the white trim on the collar and cuffs.\n\nCoats and shirts: Short wool jackets were replaced with Navy blue wool winter peacoats that had handwarmer pockets and flapped pockets (not pictured). The jumpers had a slightly longer cut and baggier sleeves than during the Civil War. They had a tie at the hem that was to be tightened and bloused instead of tucked in.\n\nThe wool trousers were similar to the Civil War style. They were worn tightly at the hips and had a 13-button closure flap. There was lacing at the rear for adjustments. The wide-legged bell-bottom cut was so sailors could roll them up if needed.\n\nLand-based soldiers wore the uniform of the Army when they went ashore:\n\nService coat: Made of olive drab wool and cotton liner, this single-breasted coat had a short standing collar that hooked and displayed two discs: one saying \"U.S.\" and later the regimental number; the other contained the branch emblem and, generally, company letter. Each coat had four flapped pockets and five buttons.\n\nLand-based sailors were issued pullover flannel shirts in olive drab that had a collar, two pockets, three buttons on the placket and sleeve reinforcement over the elbows. (Not pictured)\n\nInstead of trousers, men were issued olive drab wool service breeches, which flared out at the thigh, tapered to the knee and were tight-fitting to the calf where they ended with a lace-up closure. They were the style of the time.\n\nLong wool cloth strips called puttees were wrapped tightly around the top of the boot to just below the knee. They supported the calf while marching and prevented mud and debris from getting into a sailor's shoe.\n\nCotton camouflage covers were prevalent. It was reversible: frog skin camouflage in green colors on one side and brown colors on the other.\n\nIn 1942, the Army-issued World War I-style \"Brodie\" helmet was replaced by the M1 combat helmet. This steel-shell upgrade had a liner made of pressed, lacquered fiberboard and provided greater ballistic protection. It was given texture to make it less reflective and came with a two-piece webbed chinstrap. Like the WWI helmet, these helmets were meant to deflect shell fragments and were not bulletproof.\n\nEarly in the Pacific theater, corpsmen had a large white dot (pictured) on their helmet signifying their medic status; however, that dot eventually became a target for the enemy, so the white dot was removed.\n\nWWII Medics and White Dot Helmets\n\nThe M1941 jacket was made of herringbone twill, or HBT, which was cool and lightweight. The jacket had one upper left chest pocket and two lower pockets on the jacket's skirt. Cotton undershirts were sometimes worn underneath the coats.\n\nM1941 trousers were also HBT in a straight-leg design, similar in cut to civilian dungarees (blue jeans).\n\nLeggings made of canvas were issued for all sailors, but they were only used by men on shore duty. They kept debris out of shoes and protected the legs. Sailors on leave were not required to wear them off the ship. If you were wearing leggings, you were considered under arms.\n\nLike the later years of WWII, dungarees were worn onboard during combat and regular duty, complete with chambray button-down shirts and denim front-fly bell-bottom trousers. (Not pictured)\n\nCorpsmen continued to wear garb similar to the Marine Corps' uniforms made of herringbone twill, a lightweight fabric similar to denim. Canvas leggings were still issued. Other land-based sailors also adopted the uniform of the service they were assisting. (Not pictured)\n\nWinter Gear: All sailors were issued the N1 deck jacket for shipboard use in cold weather. The outside was cotton Bedford cord. The inside had an alpaca liner. Each was treated to be water-resistant; a cloth-like wax bar was issued to maintain that resistance.\n\nN1 winter trousers were made of the same material as the N1 winter helmet, except the lining was alpaca. They also had the same design for windbreaking and repelling water.\n\nUndergarments: To combat the frigid temperatures, cotton-wool blend undershirts, wool boot socks worn over regular socks and cotton-blend long underwear, called drawers, were issued to land-based sailors.\n\nMittens/gloves and scarf were made of wool.\n\nRiverboat patrolmen, elite land-based units and corpsmen wore the Army's standard olive drab cotton jungle utility uniform. Jacket and trousers were made of a tightly woven, lightweight cotton twill material and, in later years, cotton ripstop. Sailors often wore the uniform with shortened sleeves and theater-made insignia.\n\nBlousing straps were elastic material fastened with Velcro or a hook to hold trouser legs to the boot.\n\nAround 1968, the ERDL camouflage pattern began to replace the jungle utility uniform. Made of cotton ripstop, this leaf-like pattern had shades of green, black, brown and tan in four variations. It was developed in 1948 by the Army’s Engineer Research and Development Lab — hence the \"ERDL\" name. (Not pictured)\n\nTiger Stripes: While not standard issue, this uniform has become an icon of the Vietnam War. Often made in-theater out of cotton, it was used by a variety of elite American units and Vietnamese allies. (Not pictured)\n\nThe Iconic Tiger Stripes of Vietnam\n\nIn the early to mid-2000s, sailors wore the coveralls described for the Gulf War for shipboard duties. (Not pictured)\n\nNavy Working Uniform, or NWU, Type I: Introduced in 2007, blue digital camouflage was developed to standardize all uniforms between units, replacing dungarees and other working uniforms at sea and ashore. Made of a 50/50 nylon-cotton blend, it was easy to mend and could hide stains and heavy wear. The blouse collar lays flat, and there are two outside patch pockets. Pants have an elasticized waist with belt loops, two top pockets, two thigh cargo pockets, two back hip pockets with flaps, a front zip-fly closure and a button for the waistband. Knees and seat are reinforced. However, issues with it not being fire-retardant led to it being replaced by coveralls for shipboard use.\n\nVelcro or hook blousing straps were issued to help keep the pant leg tight to the boot.\n\nLand-based sailors continued to wear the same helmets as Marines. The PASGT helmet was ballistic fiberglass protection made of layers of tough, puncture-resistant Kevlar and a synthetic ballistic fiber bonded with a synthetic polymer resin to create a helmet capable of stopping most bullets. The technology included a two-point suspension chin strap system. A lightweight armored helmet eventually replaced the PASGT, making the helmet lighter and increasing its ballistic capability. An added multi-point suspension and chin strap system better stabilized the new helmet on the head.\n\nCovers: While shipboard sailors wearing coveralls continued to wear the ball cap, sailors wearing the Gulf War-style woodland camo or DBDU wore the eight-point cover. It was shaped with eight evenly spaced darts, ventilation eyelets, a lined outside band, sweatband and a flexible quilted hinge-type visor. The ACE logo (the Anchor, USS Constitution and Eagle) is embroidered above the visor. (Not pictured)\n\nEarly 2000s camouflage: While the 1990s-style woodland camouflage uniform (CUU) was still used by many land-based sailors (not pictured), the desert camouflage uniform (DCU) became standard for SEAL teams and other land-operating teams fighting in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The DCU replaced the \"chocolate chip\" DBDU worn in Desert Storm and used only three colors instead of six, as leaders learned this was more effective camouflage in the open-air deserts of the Middle East. The DCU was made of a 50/50 cotton-nylon blend ripstop fabric, and trousers were cargo style.\n\nTies/blousing straps: Sailors in CUUs or DCUs had ties at the bottom of each pant leg to keep them tight to the boot; however, they were also issued Velcro or hook blousing straps to help with this."
