        "text": "Sailing\n\nThere is nothing more pleasant than to be sailing in the Pacific trade winds off Oahu’s famous Diamond Head coastline. This great sailing venue is immediately accessible from the Waikiki Yacht Club, in its pristine setting in the Ala Wai Harbor.\n\nTo promote sailing, the Waikiki Yacht Club offers youth and adult sailing instruction. For information refer to the Youth Sailing Program and the Adult Sailing Program.\n\nIf you're interested in sailboat or yacht racing, you'll definitely want to check out the Regatta Section of our website. The Waikiki Yacht Club promotes yacht racing of all types, from dinghies to keeboats, with one or more hulls. Our waters are ideal for racing, with protected inshore courses, challenging coastal conditions and of course our world-famous tradewinds. Also take the opportunity to look at the Hawaii Yacht Racing Association.\n\nSafety on the water is of paramount importance, and the Waikiki Yacht Club ocassionally hosts the Honolulu Sail and Power Squadron’s boating courses, offered to all levels of boaters. Vessel safety checks, sponsored by the Honolulu Sail and Power Squadron and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, are also offered at the club. For information, link to Boating Courses and to Vessel Safety Checks.\n\nRace Committee\n\nWYC's races are run by our all-volunteer Race Committee. They're the folks who you see on the little bobbing boat anchored at the right end of the start line, valiantly keeping time with the official sandglass, raising signal flags in the correct sequence and sounding the horn to alert sailors to the countdown time, all while holding on with two hands. After the races, they may be found huddled over laptop computers, entering finishing times in to the algorithm that determines the day's winner and who's buying drinks all around.\n\nIf you’re interested in helping out with race committee contact [email protected]\n\nRegatta Chairman: John Climaldi\n\nPrincipal Race Officer: John Climaldi\n\nPhotographer: Contact Carolyn Majewski [email protected]\n\nVolunteers:\n\nSean Doyle\n\nGary Evoniuk\n\nHideki Hayashi\n\nMichael Roth\n\nMichael Rothwell\n\nIan Rothwell\n\nJim Maynard\n\nSteve Thomas\n\nMegan McDonald\n\nAndrew Mead\n\nPhilip Katzman\n\nBe sure to say mahalo to them when you see them around our club. They are the ones who set the course, the start and finish lines, and who keep the time to deliver great racing.\n\nRemember, for the whole duration of the race, they're also on the ‘Ilima (which translates either to the official flower of Oahu, or \"little yellow boat, rolling in the waves\") the club's former Pilot Boat, which now serves as Race Committee boat.\n\nWYC Regattas\n\nThe Waikiki Yacht Club promotes yacht racing of all types, from dinghies to keeboats, and with one or more hulls. Our waters are ideal for racing, with protected inshore courses, challenging coastal conditions and of course our world-famous tradewinds. Races are held under the auspices of US Sailing and ISAF with rules amended for local conditions as applicable.\n\nhttps://www.sailing.org/inside-world-sailing/rules-regulations/\n\nADULT SAILING LESSONS ON WYC CAL 20s\n\nWe are very fortunate to have Gary Evoniuk at the helm. He is a former RC-Sail and now serving on the Board as a Director. Gary is also in charge of the Club's Cal-20 Adult Sailing Program. With this great program, maybe it’s time for you to join the fun on the water!\n\nSign up for training on one of the Cub’s Cal 20's. Gary is happy to work with you to provide a custom program or a single lesson to get your feet wet. The cost is reasonable so reach out to Gary as he can join interested parties to bring the cost down further. [email protected]\n\nFollowing completion of the course and/or certification for those who already have sufficient sailing expertise, you can charter a Cal 20 for either a half-day or full-day.\n\nThe Club’s basic sailing program is about 12 hours. It consists of four three-hour lessons on the water off Waikiki and Diamond Head. Topics covered in these classes include: seamanship, terminology, knot-tying, rules of the road, navigation, and boat maintenance.\n\nFriday Night \"Beer Can\" Races"
