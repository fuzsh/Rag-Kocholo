        "text": "We don’t know if Prince Philip would refer to Anne as his favorite in real life, but they do appear to be very close. Anne is their only daughter and appears to share a no-nonsense personality and a love for hunting and horseback riding with Philip. As we saw in the first episode of Season 4, Philip is depicted as being extremely proud of Anne’s equestrian achievements, including her participation in the Olympics.\n\nPhilip seems to think that the Queen’s favorite child is incredibly obvious, saying that “everyone knows” who it is, but he won’t tell her who he thinks it is. This scene is notably set next to their giant collection of framed photographs of their family, which has appeared throughout the series and somewhat shocks me every time, as they seem to have several shelves that are just full to the brim of them.\n\nOn The Crown podcast, show creator Peter Morgan says this episode was highly inspired by one royal watcher’s theory that Charles (1948) and Anne (1950), the Queen’s eldest two children, have a different relationship to their mother than the younger two children, Andrew (1959) and Edward (1963), as they were born years apart and at very different stages in her life. This theory makes a lot of sense, as the queen had both Charles and Anne before she ascended to the throne unexpectedly in 1952. That 9-15 year gap between the eldest two and the youngest two is definitely significant. It’s said she really was much more present during Andrew and Edward’s childhoods than her older two. Andrew was thought to be her favorite for quite a long time (that uh, may not be the case any more, as Andrew has been pretty much booted from the royal family due to his association with Jeffrey Epstein and you know, sex trafficking and sexual abuse). It’s said today that she tends to be closest to Edward, her youngest, and his wife Sophie (who is often chosen to ride in the car with Queen Elizabeth to church while other family members walk).\n\nThe advisors then bring up the Falklands situation to Margaret Thatcher and note that the governor of the Falklands has asked for an ice breaking vessel to come to the island of South Georgia to evict the Argentine scrap metal workers. Margaret, who is looking increasingly gaunt and hollow eyed, doesn’t even look as her advisors as they bring this up, and her husband ends up quietly shooing them away. They conclude that they’ll bring it the foreign secretary.\n\nMargaret’s apparent paralysis due to the disappearance of her favorite child is in sharp contrast to the way she interacts with her daughter Carol, who looks at her with concern and unease, as if she doesn’t know how to interact with her. Margaret doesn’t even acknowledge that Carol is in the room as she knocks back another glass of whiskey.\n\nThe theme of caring vs. not caring flips here, as it becomes obvious throughout the episode that the normally tough and seemingly uncaring Margaret Thatcher is very close to her son and is an absolute wreck while he’s missing. This is pretty historically accurate, as numerous people close to the PM at the time have said that this is the only time they saw her basically unable to function as a leader, completely consumed with worry over her son (source: The Crown Podcast). In contrast, the Queen, who is traditionally seen as the softer, more caring person in the Thatcher/Queen relationship, has a far more distant relationship with her children, to the extent that her asking to see each of them privately causes them alarm.\n\nEdward says about the secretaries, with no trace of shame, “There’s a nasty, officious imperiousness and sense of entitlement to these people,” and then later in the scene talks about how Cambridge will be glad to have him regardless of his grades, and how the family deserves special treatment for all that they do for the country.\n\nOne of Edward’s first questions to his mother is whether he’s still getting his civil list money. The Queen raises her eyebrows at this but mildly says, “yes, all 20 thousand pounds of it.” Edward claims it mostly goes to secretarial expenses, but the queen counters that only 800 pounds of it goes to secretaries (indicating that she is far more savvy about her children’s finances than perhaps they realize). Edward waves off her concerns about the cost by saying the money is all put away in a trust, but doesn’t really answer.\n\nAlthough the civil list was abolished in 2011, before then, it referred to the annual grant that covered the expenses of the Sovereign and the upkeep of the royal households (referring to the various departments serving the royal family). The civil list money did not cover transport and security for the Royal Family or property maintenance costs, which were covered by separate departments.\n\nI’ve had a bit of trouble finding the details of civil list money for the royals in the 1980s, or any information on at what age members of the royal family would first be given a secretary, but I’ll keep looking and update this as I find out more.\n\nEdward says he had a bet with his protection officer that the lunch would be poached salmon. Apparently the queen really does love salmon, and you can even find two of her former chef’s salmon recipes here. This offhand comment also indicates Edward’s close relationship with his protection officers; apparently he was so close to one of them that he’d call him up to tell him about good grades he got at school (Source: The Crown Podcast). Edward then talks about his experiences as guardian/head boy (a position he really had) and his experiences being bullied. We don’t know for sure if Edward was bullied, but Charles definitely had a lot of trouble at school. Edward seems clearly uncomfortable talking about it with his mother, in the show.\n\n“Don’t Worry! I’ve met all the Cambridge admissions people, they’re going to make it happen. They’re no fools. It’s good for them too. A member of the royal family at Jesus college? just wait to see how the applications rocket.” When the Queen says this isn’t a very attractive attitude, Edward responds that it’s true, and it would be true with the marines, the City, or any other area of life he might fancy. “People will always want me. and what do you expect me to do about that? Say no? There has to be some upside to being who we are. And some return for what we do for the country.”\n\nThese few lines have so many real life Edward references in them.\n\nEdward DID go to Jesus college at Cambridge, and his acceptance into the program was quite controversial due to his poor grades. I’ll be honest, I don’t entirely understand the British educational exam grading setup, but I do know that O-Levels are required exams usually taken at age 16 and are supposed to indicate readiness for more advanced “A-Level” classes. Edward received 9 O-levels and 3 A-levels. Apparently you also get grades for the A-Levels; generally, Cambridge would only accept students with straight As on their A-Levels, but Edward got a C and two Ds.\n\nThe Marines had paid 12,000 pounds of Edward’s Cambridge tuition in return for his serving for 5 years, but Edward dropped out of the service only a few months into his training course (his father was apparently VERY ANGRY about that).\n\nI’m not entirely sure what “The City” means here, but i believe it usually refers to the city of london? I couldn’t find exactly what this refers to in Edward’s biography.\n\nThis is the most in depth look we get at Edward for the entire season, so I’ll quickly cover a few more highlights from his life in the 80s. After dropping out of the marines, he COMMISSIONED A MUSICAL from Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice for his mother’s 60th birthday. He then ended up getting a job at Lloyd Weber’s theatre company and worked as a production assistant for a few musicals. in 1987, he put together a television programme called “The Grand Knockout Tournament” in which four teams of celebrities and personalities sponsored by him, Princess Anne, and the Duke and Duchess of York (Andrew and Sarah Ferguson) competed for charity. They actually managed to get big names such as John Cleese, John Travolta, Meat Loaf, and Jane Seymour. The programme raised over a million pounds for its charities, but was roundly criticized by the press and thought of as pretty ridiculous and humiliating for those who participated in it. Apparently in one activity, players dressed up as giant vegetables and threw fake hams at each other? I desperately need to find and watch this.\n\nThe Queen coos over Anne’s horses and talks to them affectionately, as well as specifically addressing the stablehand by name. Olivia Colman has said in interviews that she doesn’t really like horses, but you would never ever guess by looking at her in these little scenes. Such a good actress.\n\nThe Queen starts out in a green skirt suit and changes into more comfortable green and tan riding gear, including a hairscarf. Anne also wears a hairscarf, but wears blue and white and a black hat over her scarf in an almost uniform look. It hearkens back to her equestrianism, which sadly, isn’t going so well at this point. It’s only slightly alluded to in this conversation, but Anne had a number of embarrassing falls from her horse in 1982 (when this episode is set) that were widely covered in the press, which helps explain her dark mood toward them right now. Their different styles and colors set them apart. In addition, the queen is sort of blending into the green background as they talk, while Anne is clearly standing out from it all, illustrating her discontent with her life.\n\nThe Queen coos about her daughter’s life being exactly what she wants, out in the country, with privacy, children, horses, and mud, but Anne instantly shoots this idyllic view down, saying acerbically that it isn’t the Eden the Queen makes it out to be. She specifically says that there isn’t privacy, noting bitterly that the press has got it in for her. The Queen rebukes her slightly for referring to the press as “bastards,” and Anne shoots back, “I told them to naff off once. and can you blame me? They’re so mean to me all the time.” This refers back to the incidents in which Anne fell off her horse and yelled at the press for photographing it. This article from Express has some of the journalists saying that Anne actually said worse things, but the press toned it down for print.\n\nAnne states that she’s doing work in third world countries for real charities and real causes but that her work is being ignored in favor of Princess Diana, who gets attention for just wearing a new frock. In real life, Anne was president of Save the Children from 1970 to 2017 and during the 70s and 80s, travelled all over the world in support of the organization, including Kenya, Australia, and Gambia. Anne consistently tops the annual lists of “busiest royals” even today and appears at hundreds of official appearances and engagements throughout the year.\n\nDiana herself said in interviews that early on in her position as Princess of Wales, no one expected her to do anything but show up and look pretty. Diana’s huge popularity from the start of her engagement to Charles was really unprecedented and took everyone by surprise. Although there’s no evidence supporting any serious fallouts or problems between Anne and Diana, it makes sense that Anne might have been annoyed by the disparate press attention they were getting.\n\nThe Queen brings up rumors she’d heard of Anne having an affair with a bodyguard named Sergeant Cross. In real life, Sergeant Peter Cross worked as a member of the Royal Protection Squad for Anne for about a year starting in 1979. He later claimed that he’d had an affair with Anne and sold his story to the tabloids. Although this doesn’t come up again throughout season 4, Anne would later have an affair with an equerry to the Queen named Commander Timothy Laurence. A few of Laurence’s love letters to Anne were stolen in 1989 and given to The Sun, which published them. Anne would separate from her husband Mark Philips in 1989 and the two divorced in April 1992. Eight months later, she would marry Laurence. They’re still married today.\n\nAnne has a deeply moving speech about how unhappy she is, how she used to enjoy being “the difficult one,” but now just feels reckless and angry and upset all the time. It’s hard for me to analyze this much, as we know that her marriage wasn’t terribly happy, but we don’t know much more about that. But it is really beautifully done, and demonstrates why this character is so adored by fans.\n\nThe Queen suggests that Anne wait out both her unhappiness with her marriage and her unhappiness with her life in general. Anne asks angrily, “Is that it? Is doing nothing your solution to everything?\" This points back to the previous scene with Thatcher’s anger over doing nothing in the Falklands. Anne rides away from her mother, clearly still upset.\n\nNote: Male-preference primogeniture still applied to the succession to the English throne in the 1980s, so Andrew and Edward both came before Anne in the succession, although she was older. In October 2011, the rules of succession were altered so that absolute primogeniture for royals born after the date of the agreement. So although Andrew and Edward both still come before Anne in the line of succession (although all of them are far down the line now, due to Charles’s children and grandchildren), Prince William’s daughter Charlotte, born after the change in rules, is higher up in the succession than her younger brother Louis.\n\nQueen Elizabeth has her lunch with Andrew at a small, intimate table, which contrasts sharply with the large table and formal set up in which she met Edward and likely indicates the closeness of their relationship. The Queen is back in her family pearls and in a white shirt with a blue floral print, matching her son’s blue jacket, light blue shirt, and blue, red, and white tie (the tie colors may refer to his role in the military).\n\nAndrew asks about what title he may receive in the future when he marries, which leads into a conversation about his current love interest, “the young, racy American actress” Koo Stark. Andrew says he isn’t seriously thinking about marrying her, but in real life, it seemed that their relationship was his most serious except for that with his eventual wife. Andrew then devilishly explains the plot of the “blue” film Stark appeared in to his mother, seemingly amused at her discomfort over the description of the sexual imagery and her question of whether the film was even legal. Although his description does sound a bit like pornography, it’s apparently considered more avante garde.\n\nAndrew and the Queen briefly mention that the film was shot at Wilton House, owned by the Herberts; this is due to the fact that the director of the film was literally a Herbert.\n\nAlthough all the facts in this conversation are actually true to life, I have to think that their inclusion in this story specifically point to Prince Andrew’s modern reputation as a pedophile. Although show creator Peter Morgan has talked numerous times about how he wants to portray these people as they were known in the 1980s, and not as we know they’ll end up, I have to think he’d make an exception for Andrew, as completely overlooking his current reputation and portraying him as a good guy could backfire publicly. I honestly…really don’t want to get into all the details of Andrew’s association with Jeffrey Epstein and the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations against him, because it’s a horrible situation that other people have researched and covered in far more depth than I possibly could, but you can read all about them over here at Town and Country. The Wikipedia article on Prince Andrew also has a very well sourced section about it all. The whole furor forced him to permanently resign from all his public roles, and honestly, he may someday get arrested for it.\n\nThe Queen ends up saying that she’d like to make Andrew “Duke of York” upon his marriage, as it’s a title traditionally given to the second eldest and has military associations. Andrew seems taken back and delighted by this idea, asking “as in the grand old duke of…,” which refers to an English children’s nursery rhyme.\n\nOh, the grand old Duke of York,\n\nHe had ten thousand men;\n\nHe marched them up to the top of the hill,\n\nAnd he marched them down again.\n\nWhen they were up, they were up,\n\nAnd when they were down, they were down,\n\nAnd when they were only halfway up,\n\nThey were neither up nor down.\n\nWhy wasn’t Anne made Duchess of York upon her marriage? I’m not sure, but since Anne decided to raise her children without royal titles (although the Queen offered), she may have just refused. Or it may just be a patriarchal thing. I’ll research this more and update this if I learn something new.\n\nAndrew, with a calculating look in his eye, also notes that the previous two Dukes of York both ended up becoming monarch. This refers to George V, who became Prince of Wales and then king after his older brother died, and George VI (Elizabeth’s father), who became king after his older brother abdicated. The Queen points out that in his case, not only would Charles have to die, but Andrew would also have to murder any of Charles’s children for him to ascend to the throne. Andrew then says, “The Duke of York has history in that department too. Richard III.” The queen, through a forced smile, laughs and says that Andrew is clever.\n\nIn reality, Richard III was never Duke of York, but was actually the Duke of Gloucester. His father was Duke of York and then the title next went to his elder brother’s son Richard. The young Richard, Duke of York, was one of “The Princes in the Tower” whose disappearance was pinned on Richard. As this show is incredibly well researched, I’m sure this inaccuracy was left in intentionally, to refer to both Andrew’s and the Queen’s relative lack of historical awareness.\n\nThe segment ends with Andrew asking his mother to ensure that if the conflict in the Falklands proceeds, Andrew is able to serve on the frontlines and isn’t barred from service just because of his role as prince. The Queen heartily agrees. In real life, the British cabinet, nervous about the Queen’s son possibly being killed in action, did ask that Andrew be moved to a desk job for the duration for the conflict. However, the Queen refused, and insisted that Andrew be allowed to remain with his ship, the HMS Invincible. During the war, Prince Andrew served as a helicopter co-pilot and flew on numerous missions.\n\nContent Warning: Eating disorders, attempted suicide. [italicized]\n\nIn real life, Diana had terrible “morning sickness” (hyperemesis gravidarum) and episodes of bulimia throughout her pregnancy with William. She also was dealing with horrible pressure from the press and depression. The depiction of her in The Crown is actually a bit tame here, as in real life, she actually threw herself down the stairs during her pregnancy.\n\nContent Warning end.\n\nIn The Crown, Elizabeth says that she was lucky and that pregnancy didn’t seem to affect her. In real life, Elizabeth had some struggles with morning sickness, but nothing even close to the extent of Diana’s hyperemesis.\n\nI talked a little bit in the previous episode’s post about how happy Charles-and-Diana seem to be represented by the color blue, while unhappy Diana is shown in yellow. In the scene where Charles is whisper-shouting at Diana through the door, he’s wearing a blue sweater and is surrounded by yellow walls (Remember: it’s Diana who decorated Highgrove). Diana herself is in a white nightgown with a blue floral robe, but clearly ignoring Charles so - she’s still trying at their relationship, but severely disillusioned.\n\nThe Queen is again in her “family” pearls and green. She’s somewhat connected to her eldest son (who changes into a grey double breasted suit with blue shirt and tie), but there’s a big distance still between them. Charles is STILL known for wearing double breasted suits, by the way.\n\nCharles shows his mother around the gardens at Highgrove rather pompously, expounding about his many gardens (which Camilla and Diana spoke about in the previous episode) and his plans for the whole place. He states that he wants the house, the land, and the gardens to express who he really is, and what he really is all about (notably never mentioning his wife or his soon to be born child). The Queen gently pokes fun at him, pointing out that his plans seemed perhaps a bit self-involved (“so the big idea is you”). Later, after he expounds on wanting an organic, natural garden, without any straight manicured lines, she playfully notes that the pool has straight lines and that the tennis court didn’t seem particularly organic.\n\nCharles even says that he wants Highgrove to be his own Shangri La or Xanadu. Shangri-La is a fictional location described in James Hilton’s 1933 novel “Lost Horizon,” and is commonly used to describe an earthly paradise now. Xanadu was a secondary name for Shangdu, the summer capital of the Yuan dynasty of China, which was described in ecstatic terminology in a 1368 poem by Toghon Temur Khan and the 1797 poem “Kubla Kahn” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (which is what Charles begins to recite). These literary references to various paradises pairs nicely with Anne’s earlier description of her own life as “not the Eden you think it is.”\n\nCharles then starts to recite poetry, which seems to dismay his mother; she finds an excuse to talk about his wisteria soon afterward and stop him. This is the second time this has happened this season (Margaret Thatcher also recited poetry by Charles McKay to the Queen in S4E2) and also reflects back to Lord Mountbatten’s recitation of Rudyard Kipling’s “Mandalay” in S3e5.\n\nCharles also complains about Diana being intellectually incurious, and not caring about his tutorials in Shakespeare and poetry. This further illustrates their very very different personalities and interests. He also specifically refers to writer Laurens van der Post visiting. In real life, Charles brought several books by Van der Post along on their honeymoon, hoping that they could both read and discuss the books together. This was not exactly Diana’s idea of fun.\n\nThe Queen rebukes Charles for his self-absorption, his close friendship with Camilla, and the way he’s treating Diana. When he says he talks to Camilla more when he needs cheering up, the Queen distinctly raises her voice at him, sharply saying “When you need cheering up? You’ve just bought your dream house, your Xanadu, that you and an army of sycophants are turning into the living embodiment of your soul. And your young, beautiful wife, struggling with pregnancy, has locked herself in a room upstairs and is refusing to come out. You know how I hate interfering. It’s not for me to tell a grown man what to do. But in your position I might be inclined to worry less about my own happiness and pay a little more attention to the well-being of the mother of my future child.”\n\nCharles /almost/ seems to listen to his mother’s advice there, and looks up the staircase toward Diana’s bedroom while thinking, fiddling with his signet ring (remember, he gave Diana a signet ring of her own right before they married). However, he ends up turning away and going off on his own.\n\nThe Queen concludes that instead of Mark Thatcher, \"it's our children that are lost, each in their own deserts.\" Philip dismisses this at first, saying roughly that Anne isn’t lost. The Queen mildly says that Anne’s marriage is lost, pointedly not revealing the other issues in Anne’s life that have been making her deeply unhappy. He then claims that Edward isn’t lost, but the Queen disagrees, describing him as “entirely lost, and bullied, and vengeful.” Philip agrees that Charles is lost, but says he always has been. She concludes with Andrew (who Philip quietly points out is her favorite), noting “I was shocked,” and then saying with foreboding, “If he doesn’t change…”, leaving the idea hanging in the air.\n\nSources do seem to think that Andrew is the Queen’s favorite child in real life.\n\nThe actual scene with Andrew is so subtle that I initially was left wondering why the Queen was left so worried about Andrew. I think she’s referring to his delight in freaking her out with the details of his girlfriend’s sexy film, his casual disregard to whether the film itself was legal or not, and his plain avarice and desire to be king, as evinced by his jokes about going Richard III on Charles. It’s all very under the radar and foreshadowy and I don’t think the story line would end with her so concerned about Andrew in 1982 if real life 2020 Andrew weren’t a screwup and possible criminal.\n\nShe asks Philip what their children’s unhappiness says about them as parents, noting that her mother had excused it by saying she shouldn’t blame herself, as she’s already mother to the nation. Philip agrees, and after hearing out her story about her regrets as a mother, firmly says that she is a perfectly good mother and their children, as adults, must now sort themselves out.\n\nIn this scene, the Queen is already ready for bed, wearing a nightgown and wearing no makeup, all pretense and pomp swept away as she talks about her regrets as a mother, saying she didn’t know how to be maternal toward Charles when he was a child and so let his nanny bathe him, while she watched. This story is based off of some of Charles’s own stories of his childhood. The underlying theme continues the show’s portrayal of the Queen as not really knowing how to handle emotion, previously discussed in detail in S3E3 Aberfan. Have to say, I really disagree with this line of thought. The queen may have been a bit more distant from her children then she would have liked as a mother, due to her responsibilities as monarch and the traditional child-rearing practices of both the royal family and British upper class society, but there’s never been any sign that she doesn’t know how to express emotion. There are pictures of her looking absolutely distraught at Aberfan, and she’s cried in public on numerous occasions.\n\nThe whole story overall does really underline the difficulties each royal child was facing in the early 80s, and highlights what Queen Elizabeth really gave up in order to be a good sovereign."
