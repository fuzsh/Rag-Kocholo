        "text": "Whenever anyone asks me what I call âthe DeLorean questionââwhat era in time would I want to travel back to?âI always say the 1960s. The music, the fashionâ¦I mean, what could be better? These five stylish films are a case in point.\n\nIn A Woman Is a Woman, aka Une femme est une femme (1961), Anna Karina plays an exotic dancer torn between her boyfriend and his best friend. SCANDALO! She was not only THE heroine of French New Wave cinema, but also one of the eraâs most elegant style icons. And though she plays an exotic dancer in this movie, there is nary a see-through stripper heel in sight. Donât get me wrong, we all know I love a stripper heel, but if modern-day stripteases consisted of clothing like this, Iâd drop what Iâm doing and get to DANCINâ.\n\nAnyway, I especially love her wardrobe in Une femme because of the primary-themed color palette. Her characterâs standout outfit, a blue-and-white fur-trimmed dress, would be a fun one to make. On your next thrifting adventure, look for a sapphire-blue dress and sew on some white faux-fur trim from the craft store. Put your hair up in a bun, clip in a bow and paint your eyes with a nice blue shadow like Make Up Foreverâs Flash Color Pot in Pale Blue and their black Aqua Liner. (You better not be sick of a â60s cat eye OR ELSEâ¦)\n\nDaisies aka SedmikrÃ¡sky (1966) is definitely one of the weirdest yet COOLEST movies I have ever seen. Two girls, both named Marie (OOH YEAH), decide that since the world around them is going to shit, they will start âbeing badâ along with it. The movie was initially banned in Czechoslovakia for its depiction of food wastage (FOOD-FIGHT ALERT!) and has many feminist leanings and political undertones. The two Maries get into their own brand of mischievous slapstick and are incredibly stylish throughout! Polka-dot shift dresses, checkered bikinis, butterfly specimens, and the inevitable flower crown are all very Daisies-esque. I know some of you are like, âUGH flower crowns agaiiiiiin????â YES, sorry but itâs a signature look in the film and anyway, ITâS ACTUALLY FLOWER-CROWN SEASON! Thereâs a new twist though, because Iâm really into this one thatâs attached to a fake braid! If any of you decide to crash somebodyâs epic feast and swing from a chandelier, donât forget to invite your girl Rie-Rie! I will put on my anarchist party shoes!\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) is a beautiful French musical about two twins (played by real-life sisters Catherine Deneuve and FranÃ§oise DorlÃ©ac) born under the sign of Gemini. One of them teaches ballet while the other is a music composer, and both girls long to leave the doldrums of Rochefort for Paris. Catherine Deneuve, who is another iconic French New Wave actress, plays the ballerina. Turn your Girly Meter up to a TEN with rose-hued pleats and matching berets, then squeeze your hooves into a pair of ballerina-style flats. Paint your nails in one of the perfectly subtle shades from OPIâs New York City Ballet collection. Now work on your pliÃ©s, mes poupÃ©es!\n\nShag (1989) is about four friends who go to Myrtle Beach for a last hurrah before they part for college and a wedding. The girls spend their time at the beach meeting bad boys, having parties, and dancing âthe Shag.â The girlsâ personalities couldnât be more different, but they share a cute sense of style. The nautical look is at its best when youâre spending your summer by the shore. Actually, I have worn nautical in the desert so donât believe my lies. This dress from Romwe or a Topshop playsuit are my ideal choices for sailor-style wear. Grab some matching sea-themed accessories and flip your hair up like Phoebe Catesâs, and youâll be ready to shag!\n\nThe young ladypals in Now and Then (1995) deal with heavy real-life topics like divorce and death, but balance them with cemetery sÃ©ances, bra-stuffing, and riding their bikes while singing along to âKnock Three Times,â so itâs no surprise that the movie was known as the feminine version of Stand By Me. The assortment of prints the girls wear throughout the film are so fantastic someone needs to dedicate an artsy Tumblr to them like that Cosby-sweater one right away!"
