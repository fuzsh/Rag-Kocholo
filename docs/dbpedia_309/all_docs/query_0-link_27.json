The initial colour sequences are personal and intense, shot in London and Beirut and set to a great score. The disinterred film runs a little less than an hour and is presented in an orangey sepia (von Trier surely saw this film before shooting The Element of Crime). It's a creepy allegory in which five medical students are reunited after several years, are shut into a railway carriage filled with plaster of paris (one of their number gets semi-mummified, with a burning candle fixed to his chest) and progress through a series of mutual recriminations halfway between psychodrama and political trial. Contrastingly tinted flashbacks reveal the student incident (embodied in a spectacular, ridiculous image I won't spoil for you) that sent one of them spiralling off the gravy train of a medical career.\n\nThe action is deeply absurdist, but angry and urgent (even twice-removed in time), and Skolimowski extracts some breathtaking images from his extremely severe setting. The railway carriage is lit with candles, and in one magical shot the camera pulls way back from the scrabbling, rat-like protagonists in a corner of the wagon, across an implied space more like a warehouse than a train carriage, to reveal not just the handful of candles previously established, but hundreds of them - flickering yellow points of light in an orange industrial expanse, with the human beings that had been the focus of the film up till then reduced to pitiful figures in the corner of the shot. And then, Skolimowski slowly dims the lights, leaving just the constellation of flickering candle flames in the darkness. A simple enough shot, but it has an unexpected cosmic gravitas that makes your hair stand on end.\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#258 Post by domino harvey » Wed Dec 17, 2008 3:42 pm\n\nOkay, so I have in my possession all four tapes of Near Death in eighties-tastic black clamshells.

You'll need the extra days to recover.\n\nSeriously, don't break it up if you can avoid doing so. It sort of divides up into clear sections, but they work off one another in significant ways, and there's a through-line with the staff that's complex and rewarding.\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#260 Post by life_boy » Sat Dec 20, 2008 10:54 am\n\nI have two recommendations:\n\nWater and Power (Pat O'Neill, 1989)\n\nThis was one of those revelatory films for me, despite watching it on ubuweb on my computer obviously ported from a VHS, the film still had me mouth agape and in tears through a large swath of its running time. The playful and sometimes terrifying images, layered upon each other, vying for control and changing each other as the lighting shifts or the camera pans. The soundtrack: dense and meticulous, building the metaphysical fabric of a city in constant motion, nature in a state of flux. The technical proficiency on display here is something worth noting, as the entire combination of time-lapse camera movement, animated elements, and multiple simultaneous super-impositions merged seamlessly. If you can give up an hour to watch a non-narrative film on your computer, I give this one my recommendation.\n\n[To view online via ubuweb]\n\nIn Heaven There Is No Beer? (Les Blank, 1984)\n\nI’m sure, for the pragmatic, Burden of Dreams is the Blank documentary to get behind this decade because of its connection to Herzog and accessibility. But for me, I can’t help but be drawn back again and again to this wonderful celebration of life, music and beer. Polka music and polka dancing never seemed so perfect. It is more representative of Les Blank as a documentarian and I completely love it. This is one of those films I use as a nightlight.\n\nAlthough there is no standard DVD release (or availability for rental via Netflix, etc.) R0, NTSC DVD-R’s are available for purchase direct through Blank’s Flower Films website.\n\nA few others worth mentioning that are likely to place high on my final list:\n\nSherman's March (Ross McElwee, 1986) [First Run Features DVD]\n\nThe Dante Quartet (Stan Brakhage, 1987) [CC DVD]\n\nSomething Wild (Jonathan Demme, 1986) [MGM DVD...now OOP?]\n\nThe Ties That Bind (Su Friedrich, 1985) [Microcinema DVD]\n\nSay Amen, Somebody (George T. Nierenberg, 1982) [Rykodisc DVD]\n\nGod's Country (Louis Malle, 1986) [Eclipse DVD]\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#261 Post by zedz » Sat Dec 20, 2008 11:00 pm\n\nHousekeeping:\n\nThe new 80s List deadline is January 15, so you've still got a few weeks to go. I might not be around much until a few days before that, so don't worry if your PM seems to go into a void!\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#262 Post by domino harvey » Sun Dec 21, 2008 2:12 am\n\nSome thumbnail responses to recent 80s viewings:\n\nAtlantic City A slight film brightened by Lancaster but not much else. Really, the more I think about it, the sillier the whole thing seems. How this was the Malle film the Oscars chose to embrace so enthusiastically is a little perplexing\n\nthe Aviator's Wife I don't know how Rohmer does it so consistently, but he captures young life so perceptively that even in this one film, he presents a thesis course to the entire current generation of misguided mumblecore filmmakers on how to sound natural without being awkward and how to replicate reality without sacrificing quality. I guess Ray Carney doesn't do subtitles (or subtleties)\n\nBody Heat Outside of Chinatown and Veronica Mars, I'm not much for neo-noir, but this was a passable riff on Double Indemnity saved by Ted Danson of all people. However, I was one step ahead of every twist the whole way, which isn't a good sign for a film this proud of its machinations. Without spoiling too much, this picture definitely reveals how crucial the fatalistic endings of Classical Hollywood noirs were to their overall success\n\nFrances An essential, elemental performance by Jessica Lange achieved in a film that doesn't deserve it. Farmer's story is an incredibly compelling one, but the film skips over most of her Hollywood traumas and focuses on her later mental illness injustices mixed with mostly fictional ephemera. The Shepherd character is a total waste, included just to periodically pop in and make things nice for Farmer every thirty minutes, but her plight would have been felt by the audience so much more without him. Not a terrible film by any definition (and it will be charting due to her strength), but Lange is so underline amazing that I wish I could recommend the film, not just her performance. Time to add more of her films to the queue\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains I admired how restrained and lowkey this satire was. It would have been easy to overstretch this material beyond the film's reach, but Adler never goes too far and the picture mostly refrains from on-the-nose jabs. The music throughout it top-notch and the ending is perfect. Plus it was nice to see Diane Lane actually capable of acting for once during this project\n\nStreets of Fire Holy Christ. This is pretty much what my childhood told me most eighties films looked like. Some catchy songs are about all to recommend in this astonishingly unpleasant \"rock n roll action film\" (Pretty sure that genre was born and died here) that features perhaps the most abrasive and unlikable characters ever to populate a film. It's pretty hard to name a low point in a film filled with them, but Diane Lane cozying up to a playing-it-straight Rick Moranis probably comes in second behind an inexplicable scene where the \"hero\" knocks Lane unconscious by pummeling her in the face for no reason. Gee, I can't imagine why this didn't start a franchise\n\nI have several bartered number ones in my possession, so be patient while I get around to living up to my end of the bargain\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#263 Post by swo17 » Sun Dec 21, 2008 2:34 am\n\ndomino harvey wrote:Lange is so underline amazing that I wish I could recommend the film, not just her performance.

Or was this sequence supposed to serve as a ironic commentary on how easily the punk ethos can be co-opted by the mainstream? I'm not sure I can give Lou Adler the benefit of the doubt.\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#266 Post by GringoTex » Tue Dec 30, 2008 8:01 am\n\nThree Crowns of the Sailor - Mindblowing. The supreme plasticity of the images is pure latino; the alienation of family, place, and language (the result of exile) is pure anti-latino. This was my first Ruiz and I'm now scrambling to find all the others. This one's going near the top of my 80s list.\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#267 Post by Lemmy Caution » Tue Dec 30, 2008 9:45 am\n\n3 Crowns is an exciting ride. Will make my list easily.\n\nWish I had seen earlier that people were looking for Yang's The Terroriser. It, along with a few other Yang's, was around in Shanghai this Summer. Not sure how good the quality was. I'm not much interested in Yang, so I only picked up A Brighter Summer Day which was a fairly rough \"copy of a decent laserdisc\" as it frankly stated on back. I'll see if The Terroriser is still available, but I doubt it. But there should be copies floating around the swap sites, I'd think, since the Dvd was here for months. Although now I can't recall whether it had English subs or not.\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#268 Post by Gregory » Tue Dec 30, 2008 4:31 pm\n\nGringoTex wrote:The supreme plasticity of the images is pure latino\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#269 Post by GringoTex » Tue Dec 30, 2008 8:24 pm\n\nGregory wrote:\n\nGringoTex wrote:The supreme plasticity of the images is pure latino\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nLatino art is traditionally concerned with representation rather than reality. That's representation of symbols, classes, history, etc., rather than individuals, individual identity, and especially perspective. So Ruiz is never concerned about perspective in Three Crowns. He foregrounds and backgrounds objects without worrying where he's cutting to (the opposite is Ozu, where you can measure objects in his shots/reverse shots with a laser).\n\nThe danger with this representational mode of filmmaking is that the audience fails to identify with the protagonist. I had no such trouble. I cried for the protagonist. Ruiz has his cake and eats it, too.\n\nRe: 1980s List Discussion and Suggestions (Lists Project)\n\nQuote\n\n#270 Post by Gregory » Tue Dec 30, 2008 9:23 pm\n\nIt seems really reductive (which \"tradition\"?) and dependent upon using a number of terms in very specific senses with all kinds of assumptions about how they're related to one another categorically. But this isn't really the thread to discuss it, I guess."
