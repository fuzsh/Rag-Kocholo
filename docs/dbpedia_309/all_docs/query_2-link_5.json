        "text": "A (TOP OF PAGE) (Sailboard Diagram) (Sailboat Diagram) (Warship Diagram)\n\nAback - the condition of a ship's sails when the wind bears against their front surfaces. They are laid aback, when this is purposely effected to deaden her way by rounding in the weather-braces; and taken aback, when brought to by an unexpected change of wind, or by inattention in the helmsman.--All aback forward, the notice given from the forecastle, when the head-sails are pressed aback by a sudden change in the wind.\n\nAbaft - a relative position toward the stern of a vessel from another object; as, \"abaft the forward hatch\".\n\nAbeam - at right angles to, or beside the boat\n\nAble Bodied Seaman - a member of the deck crew who is able to perform all the duties of an experienced seamen; certified by examination; must have three years sea service. Also called Able Seamen and A.B.\n\nAboard - on or in the boat\n\nAbout Ship! - the command given to order the crew to tack a vessel\n\nAbove Board - on or above the deck, in plain view, not hiding anything\n\nAbove Deck - on deck, not over it - that would be \"Aloft\"\n\nAbove-water Hull - the part of the hull that is out of the water; between the waterline and the deck\n\nAbsolute Bearing - the bearing of an object in relation to North; either True North or Magnetic North. See also: Relative Bearing, Magnetic Bearing, True Bearing, and Bearing\n\nAbreast -side by side, even with, or by the side. This can refer to two or more vessels or other objects\n\nAbyss - that volume of ocean that is profoundly deep or lying below about 300 fathoms from surface.\n\nAcockbill or A-Cock-Bill 1. Hanging at the cathead, ready to let go, as an anchor. 2. Said of a square-rigger's yard; topped up; having one yardarm higher than the other.\n\nAcoustic Navigation - the use of a sonic depth finder to gauge water depth and bottom features for information to determine a ship's location.\n\nAdmeasure - a formal measurement of a vessel for the purpose of documentation\n\nAdmiral - an officer of the highest rank and command in the fleet, and who is distinguished by a flag displayed at his main-top-mast-head\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet - the officer who superintends the naval forces of a nation, and who is authorized to determine in all maritime decisions\n\nAdmiralty Law - the law of the seas, a term for maritime law derived from the British Admiralty department that governs naval affairs\n\nAdmiralty Pattern Anchor or Admiralty Anchor - an older (1840's), but very good anchor design that features long arms with a long iron stock set perpendicular to the arms and at the top end of the shank. No longer used for large ships but continues in use for small boats and for moorings. Although it has great holding power in a penetrable bottom it is extremely awkward and the long stock is vulnerable to mechanical damage. When in position the upstanding arm may foul a chain or pierce the hull of a vessel. Also called Fisherman's Anchor. See the illustration at Anchor\n\nAdrift - not moored or anchored, driven without control by the wind, currents, and seas\n\nAfloat - floating on the surface of the water; not aground\n\nAfore - 1. Near the bow 2. further forward. Opposite of abaft\n\nClick On Image To Enlarge in New Window\n\nAft or After - toward the stern or behind it. See illustration at right.\n\nAfter Bow Spring Line - a mooring line fixed to the bow of the boat and leading aft where it is attached to the dock. This prevents the boat from moving forward in its berth. Its opposite, the forward quarter spring line, is used to keep the boat from moving aft in its berth\n\nAfterdeck - all parts of the upper deck of a ship that lies abaft amidships\n\nAfter Leading - a line that goes from its point of attachment toward the stern\n\nAfter-Sails - all sail which are extended on the mizen-mast, and on the stays between the mizen and main-mast. They are opposed to the head-sails, which include all spread on the fore-mast and bowsprit\n\nAgainst the Sun - Anti-clockwise circular motion. Left-hand lay ropes are coiled against the sun\n\nAgonic Line - an imaginary line on the earth's surface where there is no magnetic declination in relation to True North and South. The agonic line is a line of longitude on which a compass will show true north, since where magnetic declination is zero, magnetic north coincides with geographic north.\n\nAge of Sail - the period in which international trade and naval warfare were dominated by sailing ships.\n\nAgger - two consecutive high and low tides that show little range\n\nAground - when the hull or keel is touching, resting or lodged on the bottom of the body of water you have been sailing on\n\nAhead - forward, in front of the vessel\n\nAhead Reach - the distance traveled by a ship underway at full speed with engines reversed until she comes to a full stop\n\nAhoy - a seaman's call to attract attention; like \"Hello\"\n\nAid to Navigation - a marker or device external to your craft, designed to assist in determination of position of the craft, or of a safe course, or to warn of dangers. View a downloadable and printable US Coast Guard brochure about aids to navigation.\n\nAirs - a measurement of wind speed. Here is a table showing Airs and their relation to jib usage on a knockabout or sloop.\n\nSTANDARD JIB SELECTION FOR VARIOUS WIND CONDITIONS ON A KNOCKABOUT OR SLOOP\n\nLight Airs 0 -10 Knots 110% - 150% Genoa (Optional) Moderate Airs 10 - 20 Knots 90% - 110% Working Jib Heavy Airs 20 Knots or more 60%- 90% Storm Jib\n\nAIS - Automatic Identification System\n\nAka - the beams connecting the main hull and the smaller amas on a trimaran, or the windward ama on a Proa or similar vessel\n\nAldis Lamp - See Signal Lamp\n\nAlee - downwind; opposite of \"Windward\"\n\nAlgae - aquatic plants which thrive near the surface and frequently attach to rocks, pilings, and the bottoms of boats\n\nAlidade - a telescope or other device mounted over a compass, compass repeater or compass rose, for measuring direction; a telescopic azimuth circle\n\nAll Hands - entire ship's company, both officers and enlisted personnel, on duty or not\n\nAll Night In - having no night watches\n\nAloft - above the deck; not on deck\n\nAlong-Side - side by side, or joined to a vessel, wharf, etc. and lying parallel to the vessel\n\nAltair - a first magnitude (very bright) star, often used in celestial navigation\n\nAltitude - the angle between the horizon and a celestial body. In practice, the celestial navigator will consult tables to estimate the azimuth and altitude of each star line he will attempt, and preset the sextant as an aid to identification of the star or planet. Then he will measure the exact altitude of the body and use that figure to calculate a line on the chart.\n\nAma - the outrigger(s) on a trimaran, Proa, or similar sailing vessel\n\nAmerican Bureau of Shipping (ABS) - a U.S.- based private classification, or standards setting organization for merchant ships and other marine systems.\n\nAmerica's Cup - The America's Cup race, dating from 1851, is the oldest trophy in sailing and is considered yacht racing's Holy Grail. The race was originally called the Hundred Guineas Cup, presented by the British Royal Yacht Club, and raced around the Isle of Wight. The winning vessel that year was the \"America\", and the name of the race was changed to \"America's Cup\". Because of the enormous costs involved, the race is held approximately every three years.\n\nAmidships - the middle of the boat; either along the longitudinal centerline, or halfway from bow to stern, but not necessarily both. See General Shipboard Directions illustration.\n\nAmplitude - a measurement of the arc between true East or West and the plane of a selected star or planet at a precise moment in time\n\nAnalog - a readout of an instrument which is displayed with a dial and pointer rather than numerically\n\nAnchor - an object designed to grip the bed (lake bed, seabed, riverbed) or ground, under a body of water, to hold the boat in a selected area\n\nFormerly the largest and strongest anchor was the sheet anchor (hence, best hope anchor or last refuge anchor), called also waist anchor. Now the bower and the sheet anchor are usually alike. Then came the best bower and the small bower (so called from being carried on the bow of the vessel). The stream anchor is about one fourth the weight of the bower anchor. Kedges or kedge anchors are light anchors used in warping and kedging.\n\nParts of an anchor: All anchors don't have all parts.\n\nAll Anchors Don't Have All Parts Anchor Nomenclature Old Fisherman's Anchor Stockless Navy-Type Anchor Danforth-Style Anchor\n\nRing (Shackle) - Device used to attach the anchor chain to the shank of the anchor. The ring is secured to the top of the shank with a riveted pin.\n\nShank - The long center part of the anchor running between the ring and the crown.\n\nCrown - The lower section of the anchor to which the shank is secured. The shank is fitted to the crown with (on some anchors) a pivot or ball-and-socket joint that allows a movement from 30o to 45o either way.\n\nStock - a crossmember, spar, or rod, that rolls the anchor into an attitude that enables the flukes to dig into the sea bed. Most newer anchors are stockless.\n\nArms - The parts that extend from each side of the crown.\n\nThroat - The inner part of an arm where it joins the shank.\n\nFluke or Palm - The broad shield part of the anchor that extends upward from the arms.\n\nBlade - That part of the arm extending outward below the fluke.\n\nBill or Pea - Tip of the palm or fluke.\n\nCup - on a Mushroom Anchor, the round ground-holding portion corresponding to the fluke of other designs\n\nAnchor's Acockbill - when the anchor is suspended perpendicularly from the cathead, ready to be let go.\n\nAnchor Angel - a weight or small anchor suspended from the anchor rode to help keep the pull on the anchor as horizontal as possible to prevent dragging in foul weather. Also called a kellet or sentinel.\n\nAnchor's Apeak - when the anchor cable is drawn in so tight as to bring the ship directly over it.\n\nAnchor's Atrip - when the anchor is lifted out of the ground. Same as \"Anchor's Aweigh\".\n\nAnchor's Awash - when the anchor is hove up to the surface of the water.\n\nAnchor's Aweigh - said of an anchor, during the weighing (raising) of the anchor, when just clear of the bottom\n\nAnchor Ball - a round black shape hoisted in the forepart of a vessel to show that it is at anchor\n\nAnchor Bell - a warning bell mounted on the foredeck and rung while at anchor in foggy conditions\n\nAnchor Bend - a very secure knot used to tie rode to anchor\n\nAnchor Buoy - a small buoy secured by a light line to an anchor to indicate position of the anchor on bottom. The anchor buoy is said to be watching if it is floating on the surface. An anchor buoy can be a valuable asset in relocating an anchor that has been lost while weighing anchor or if the anchor has been slipped in an emergency.\n\nAnchor Chain - chain attached to the anchor. The chain acts partially as a weight to keep the anchor lying next to the ground so that it can hold better.\n\nAnchor Chocks - deck fittings for storing the anchor\n\nAnchor Detail - a group of men who handle ground tackle when the ship is anchoring or getting underway\n\nAnchor Ice - ice of any kind that is aground in the sea\n\nAnchor Light - a white light displayed by a boat or ship at anchor. Two such lights are displayed by a ship over 150 feet (46 m) in length, Also called a riding light.\n\nAnchor Pocket - a recess in the bow for storing an anchor; also called a billboard\n\nAnchor Watch - making sure the anchor is holding and that the boat is not drifting. Important during rough weather and at night. Most marine GPS units have an Anchor Watch alarm capability.\n\nAnemometer - an instrument for measuring the speed of the wind\n\nAneroid Barometer - an instrument that determines atmospheric pressure by the effect of such pressure on a thin-metal cylinder from which the air has been partly exhausted\n\nAngle of Attack - the angle between the chord of a sail and the relative wind or between the chord of a hydrofoil such as a keel or rudder and a vector line representing the true path through the water, taking the amount of sideslip or leeway into account. The term applies to a sail only when the relative wind is forward of the beam.\n\nAngle of Sail - the angle between the vessel's compass course and the true wind\n\nAntarctic Convergence - an irregular line of demarcation in the southern ocean, mostly between 45Â° and 60Â° south, along which northward moving Antarctic waters meet sub-Antarctic waters and sink below them with little or no mixing. An abrupt change in sea temperature takes place, and with it a change in sea and bird life. Because of the amount of land mass near the pole in the northern hemisphere, there is no corresponding convergence there.\n\nAntarctica - the earth's fifth largest continent; located at the South Pole. Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia, and about 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages at least 1 mile (1.6 km) in thickness. Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. Antarctica is considered a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 inches) along the coast and far less inland, yet it has huge amounts of ice due to the millions of years of accumulation. Many nations, including Australia, South Africa, the United States of America, Argentina, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.S.R. have claims on the continent and all (48) have entered into a treaty declaring that the continent is an international preserve for scientific research.\n\nAnti-Cyclone - a fair weather, slow moving, weather system based on high barometric pressure\n\nAnti-Fouling - a type of paint or other coating for the under-water hulls of vessels that is resistant to barnacles, moss, seaweed, Teredo worms, marine grass and various other plant and animal life that would want to adhere to a vessel's hull and slow or damage the hull. There are four basic types: ablative, sloughing, modified epoxy, and vinyl. Most usually contain copper biocide or some other repellant. Copper itself is under increasing pressure and is already banned in some areas because it can harm other marine life, too. The technology of the poisons used has progressed from organoarsenicals and organomercurials in the 1960's to relatively harmless organic materials today which target fouling organisms without harming other marine creatures. Recent developments include \"foul release\" technologies in which non-stick coatings based on silicones or fluoropolymers are able to shed fouling at speeds above about 10 knots.\n\nAntitrades - the prevailing westerly winds of the middle latitudes. The winds to the north of the trade winds which blow in the opposite direction. Since the early square rigged ships could not sail to weather, they had to cross to the New World on the trades or tradewinds, and return by a more Northerly route in the antitrades. See illustration at Prevailing Winds of the World\n\nAnti-trip Chine - a flared out aft section of the side and bottom of a boat. The purpose is to prevent the hard chine of the boat catching a wake or small wave on a sharp turn.\n\nApeak or Apeek - 1. more or less vertical. (You may hold your oars apeak, raise your gaff apeak or be apeak your anchor. 2. (of a dropped anchor) as nearly vertical as possible without being free of the bottom. 3. (of an anchored vessel) having the anchor cable as nearly vertical as possible without freeing the anchor. Sometimes it is necessary to do this in order to let wave action break the anchor loose.\n\nAport - on or toward the port side of a ship; as in: Ã¬Come ten degrees aport.Ã®\n\nApparent Horizon - the plane where the earth or water and sky seem to meet\n\nApparent Time - the time of day indicated by the hour angle of the sun; i.e. apparent noon locally would be the moment when the sun is at its zenith. A properly mounted sundial indicates apparent time. The concept is employed when making navigation calculations. A sun sight at noon and a simple calculation can produce a very accurate line of longitude\n\nApparent Wind - the direction and velocity of the wind relative to the speed and direction of the boat which is derived from the True Wind and Wind of Motion. This is the wind you feel on your face when on a moving sailboat.\n\nApron - a timber fitted abaft the stem to re-enforce the stem and give a sufficient surface on which to land the forward ends of the planks\n\nArc of Visibility - the portion of the horizon over which a lighted aid to navigation is visible from seaward\n\nArctic Ocean - the northern polar ocean north of Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland, etc.\n\nArgos - a satellite-based system which collects, processes and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile transmitters and receivers worldwide. Argos is unique in its ability to geographically locate the source of the data anywhere on the Earth utilizing the Doppler effect.\n\nArgos was established in 1978 and since that time, it has provided data to environmental research and protection communities that, in many cases, was otherwise unobtainable. The system is fully proven and highly reliable. Many remote automatic weather stations report via Argos. Argos is a key component of many global research programs including: TOGA, TOPP, WOCE, Argo, and others. Since the late 1980's Argos transmitters have routinely been deployed on a large number of marine mammals and sea turtles and continues to serve as the most important tool for tracking long distance movements of both coastal and oceanic species. By uploading of data from pressure transducers attached to wild animals of the oceans, it has been possible to obtain a wealth of knowledge about their diving and foraging behavior.\n\nArgos was developed under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES, the French space agency), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, USA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, USA).\n\nThe system utilizes both ground and satellite-based resources to accomplish its mission. These include: instruments carried aboard the NOAA polar orbiting environmental satellites (POES) and the EUMETSAT MetOp satellites, receiving stations around the world, and major processing facilities in France and the United States. This fully integrated system works to conveniently locate and deliver data from the most remote platforms to the user's desktop, often in near real-time.\n\nArgosy - an extremely large ship or fleet of ships, especially merchant ships. (archaic)\n\nArm - 1. a branching waterway from a harbor or bay 2. The crosspiece of an anchor from the crown to flukes\n\nArmada - a fleet of warships\n\nArming - tallow or other sticky substance placed in the recess at the lower end of a sounding lead for obtaining a sample of the bottom\n\nAsh Can - World War II slang for a depth charge\n\nAshore - On shore or beach; as in, \"Send someone ashore to find fresh water.\"\n\nAspect Ratio - the relationship between the height of a sail and its breadth. i.e. A sail with a height of 30' and a breadth of 20' has an aspect ratio of 3:2. A tall and narrow sail is said to have a high aspect ratio.\n\nAstarboard - in or toward the direction of the right side of the ship when facing forward, as in: \"Pass the marker, then turn hard astarboard.\"\n\nAstern - behind the vessel\n\nAstrolabe - a primitive portable instrument used to measure celestial angles. A predecessor to the sextant.\n\nAstronavigation - Celestial navigation. Determining your position by sightings of celestial bodies.\n\nAstronomical Almanac - a catalogue of tables showing the location of various celestial bodies at specific moments in time throughout the year; consulted by the navigator in preparation for taking sights of celestial bodies. Such tables were known as \"The Ephemeris\" since the 18th C. until 1981 when it was jointly published by the US and Britain. Also called the Nautical Almanac.\n\nAstronomical Twilight - See Twilight\n\nAtmospherics - interference in reception of radio communications caused by natural phenomena such as lightning or sunspots; as in: \"Atmospherics are so bad I can't understand his transmission.\"\n\nAtoll - a roughly circular island created by and of coral, most common in the South Pacific, surrounding a lagoon\n\nAthwart or Athwartships - at right angles to the fore-and-aft or centerline of a ship. See General Shipboard Directions illustration.\n\nAtmospherics - interference in reception of radio communications caused by natural phenomena such as lightning or sunspots; as in: \"Atmospherics are so bad I can't understand his transmission.\"\n\nAtoll - a roughly circular island created by and of coral, most common in the South Pacific, surrounding a lagoon\n\nAurora - a luminous phenomena caused by electrical discharge in the upper atmosphere\n\nAurora Australis - an aurora in the southern hemisphere\n\nAurora Borealis - an aurora in the northern hemisphere\n\nAutomatic Identification System or AIS - an automated tracking system for identifying and locating vessels by electronically exchanging data with other nearby ships and AIS Base stations. AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport. Information provided by AIS equipment, such as unique identification, position, course, speed, bearing and distance of nearby vessels in a radar-like display format. AIS integrates a standardized VHF transceiver with a positioning system such as a LORAN-C or GPS receiver, with other electronic navigation sensors, such as a gyrocompass or rate of turn indicator\n\nAuto Pilot - an electrical automated steering mechanism used to steer a preset course based on the apparent wind. These are expensive and very susceptible to breakdown, but most handy when there is not enough wind to operate a windvane. Compare to Windvane on this page\n\nAuxiliary - 1. an engine used when there is no wind or for assistance in approaching a dock, etc. 2. a tender carried on deck\n\nAvast! - given as a command to stop, cease, and desist the action currently being carried out (archaic term used in movies)\n\nAwash - setting so low in the water that the water is constantly washing across the top surface\n\nAweigh - the position of the anchor just as it clears the bottom when raising it\n\nAwl - a pointed wooden or steel tool used to poke holes in leather and for unlaying the ply of a rope for splicing Compare to Marlinespike and Fid\n\nAzimuth - the horizontal direction of a celestial point from a terrestrial point\n\nAzimuth Circle - a circular sighting device that fits around the ship's compass for taking bearings of terrestrial or celestial bodies\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W Y Z\n\nB (TOP OF PAGE) (Sailboard Diagram) (Sailboat Diagram) (Warship Diagram)\n\nBack - 1. to alter the position of (a sail) so that the wind will strike the forward face 2. an alteration in the direction of the wind toward the bow of a vessel that makes the wind strike the forward face of the sails 3. to brace (yards) in backing a sail 4. a counterclockwise alteration in the direction of the wind. Opposite of \"Veer\" 5. to reinforce the holding power of (an anchor) by means of a smaller anchor attached to the main anchor and dropped farther away (to back the anchor) 6. the front surface of a propeller (as opposed to the \"face\")\n\nBackbone - heavy timbers that form the main fore-and-aft structure of a wooden ship, to which the keel and all the frames are fastened, comprised of its stem, keel, and stern members\n\nBacking Block - a sturdy piece of wood secured inboard behind a planking joint to provide extra strength\n\nBack Splice - an end section of rope that has been unlayed, reversed, and woven back into itself in order to keep it from unraveling and add weight to the end. See Knot\n\nBackstaff - a navigation instrument used to measure the apparent height of a landmark whose actual height is known, such as the top of a lighthouse. From this information, the ship's distance from that landmark can be calculated. A Davis quadrant. Also has some similarities to the sextant, but cannot be used to take accurate observations of the nighttime stars.\n\nBackstay - a wire or line that runs from the top of the mast to the stern to support the mast and control mast tension, rake, and bend. Compare to Forestay, Jibstay, and Headstay\n\nBackstay Bridle - a line, near the bottom of the stay that holds the mast stationary from aft, that splits the stay in two and runs to near the corners of the transom in order to allow clearance for movement of the tiller.\n\nBack-winded - to have the wind change to the what has been the leeward side of the sail. If you're on a sailboard, you won't be for long.\n\nBad Tack - the direction of sail that pushes the lee side of the sail against the mast or sprit, thus deforming the sail and reducing its airflow significantly on lateen, lug, sprit sails, and others that have a yard that crosses forward beside the mast. On some lug rigged sails, the yard can be switched to the other side, but other rigs cannot.\n\nBaggywrinkle - a soft, smooth, plastic covering for cables that prevents sails from chafing as they slide against the cables\n\nBail - 1. to remove water from the boat 2. a semi-circular metal fitting on the under side of the boom to which the sheet block is attached. The boom bail reduces twist on the boom by allowing the sheet block to change angles as the boom moves from side to centerline to the opposite side of the vessel.\n\nBalanced Helm - a combination of sails and rudder and mast positioning that leaves the helm with no tendency to turn either to weather or lee. Compare to Lee Helm and Weather Helm\n\nBalanced Rudder - a rudder that has a small portion of the blade forward of the axis, so that it will turn with less effort\n\nBaldheaded Schooner - a schooner without topsails\n\nBallantine - to flake the foresail halyards in a large coil, then three overlapping smaller coils within, then repeating. The system is used by schoonermen to keep the halyards ready to run free in the event the sail must be doused quickly.\n\nBallast - stone, iron, gravel, or such like materials, deposited in a ship's hold, when she has either no cargo, or too little to bring her sufficiently low in the water. It is used to counter-balance the effort of the wind upon the masts, and give the ship a proper stability, that she may be enabled to carry sail without danger of capsizing. Inside ballast is within the hull or keel, either cast into it or stowed. Outside ballast is attached to the outside of the hull or keel.\n\nBallast Keel - a heavy keel, usually cast of lead or iron, that lowers the hulls center of gravity and thus increases resistance to heeling. Lead is more desirable because it is denser and thus takes up less space for its weight and won't corrode; but it makes a vessel more expensive.\n\nBank - a large area of elevated sea floor that may pose a problem floating across it\n\nBar - 1. a large mass of sand or earth, formed by the surge of the sea and deposition of silt from a river.

View a downloadable and printable US Coast Guard brochure about buoys and other aids to navigation.\n\nBeak or Beakhead - a protruding part of the foremost section of a sailing ship. It was fitted on sailing vessels of various time periods for different reasons. Early on, a beak or beakhead was often used as a ram in order to punch holes in an enemy ship at or near the waterline. From the 16th to the 18th century they served as a working platform by sailors working the sails of the bowsprit, the forward-pointing mast that carries the spritsails. The beakhead would be one of the most ornate sections of a ship, particularly in the extravagant Baroque-style ships of the 17th century. The sides were often decorated with carved statues and located directly underneath was the figurehead, usually in the form of animals, shields or mythological creatures. The beakhead also housed the crew's toilets (head), which would drop refuse straight into the sea without sullying the ship's hull unnecessarily.\n\nBeam - 1. the width of a boat at its widest 2. transverse supports running from side to side to support the decks and hold the gunwales at their proper distance from each other 3. a direction; at, near, or off a side of the vessel. See General Shipboard Directions illustration.\n\nBeam Ends - the sides of a ship. \"On her beam ends\" may mean the vessel is literally on her side with her beams almost vertical and possibly about to capsize; more often, the phrase means the vessel is listing 45 degrees or more. A vessel may be laid on her beam ends ashore for cleaning when a cradle is not available\n\nBeam Reach - a point of sail where the craft is sailing at a right angle to the wind.

This configuration, introduced to Europe about 1920, allows the use of a tall mast, enabling sails to be set higher where wind speed is greater. Most modern sloops now use this rig instead of a gaff rigged mainsail. Another name for Marconi Rig\n\nBernoulli Effect - the function of fluid dynamics that tends to draw together two ships that are moving side by side 2. the function that tends to accelerate fluid through a pipe submerged in a moving stream 2. the function of wind accelerating through a restricted opening, such as between overlapping sails.

Mounted between the centerline of the boat and the sides, they are almost always asymmetric foils mounted at an angle to maximize lateral lift while minimizing drag and are most often found on racing scows. When sailing, the windward bilgeboard is retracted into the hull of the boat, so that it creates no drag. The leeward foil provides the lift to counter the lateral force of the sail, and converts it into forward motion. The bilgeboards are angled so that as the boat heels, or leans under the force of the wind, the leeward bilgeboard becomes more vertical, and provides the most possible force in the desired direction.\n\nBilge keels minimize the draft of the vessel compared to a single fin keel thus enabling it to negotiate shallower water. Bilge keels on sailing yachts extend below the lowest point of the hull extending slightly outwards. Such an arrangement also enables the vessel to stand upright on firm sand or mud at dry moorings without the need for detachable legs, and is simpler than retractable fin keels while giving the hull greater protection. Bilge keels are not as effective as central fin keels in preventing leeway (sideways slippage) caused by crosswinds but are preferred by many small craft owners due to their other advantages.\n\nBilge Keel - a non-moving stabilizer consisting of a pair (one on each side) of small keels or fins extending out at approximately 45° from a vessel's hull at the turn of the bilge in order to lessen or slow the rolling of the vessel. Bilge keels do not have any components inside the hull that would adversely affect cargo or storage space, but do increase the drag of the vessel slightly.\n\nBilge Pump - a hydraulic pump installed at the lowest inboard part of the hull to remove accumulated water\n\nBilge Water - all water leaked into the vessel or otherwise accumulated at the lowest interior part of the hull\n\nBilged On Her Anchor - a vessel that has run upon her own anchor; a good way to damage your hull\n\nBillboard - a permanent stowage mount for the anchor\n\nBill of Health - a document provided to a ship's master by port health authorities indicating the state of health of the ship's company and of the port from which the ship is sailing, as well as other ports to which the ship intends to sail. The procedure is a result of international agreements, with the intent to keep infectious diseases from spreading to otherwise healthy areas from the crew of visiting ships.\n\nBill of Lading - an itemized list of all the cargo on board, issued by a shipping company as a receipt and as a customs document.\n\nBillethead - 1. a bitt mounted at the stem of a whaleboat for securing the harpoon line (pennant). 2. an ornamental, curved stem piece, below the bowsprit and above the cutwater, that usually ends in a scroll or fiddlehead\n\nBimini or Bimini Top - a weather-resistant fabric stretched over a frame, fastened above the cockpit of a sailboat or flybridge of a power yacht which serves as a rain or sun shade. A similar type of shelter on a boat, but with added forward and side protection, is called a Dodger.\n\nBinding Knot - a knot that may be used to keep an object or multiple loose objects together, using a string or a rope that passes at least once around them. There are various binding knots, divided into two types: Friction knots are held in place by the friction between the windings of line.

May also be called a Burton\n\nTurning Blocks - horizontally or vertically mounted blocks used to redirect lines on or to the deck (as from the mast to the cockpit).\n\nBlock & Tackle - See Block & Tackle below\n\nBlock and Tackle - an arrangement of two or more pulleys (blocks), and lines and hooks (tackle), used to reduce the amount of force needed to move heavy loads. One block is attached to the load, and line or chains connect this block to a fixed block. Each block may have multiple wheels (sheaves) for the line to pass over numerous times. Pulling on the Fall or Hauling Part of the line or chain slowly draws the load-bearing block toward the fixed block with high mechanical advantage (MA).\n\nA Block & Tackle may be:\n\n\"Rigged to Advantage\" - the pull on the line is in the same direction as that in which the load is to be moved and where the hauling part is coming from the MOVING block; in other words, pulling UP on the hauling line LIFTS the weight. The hauling part is pulled from the moving block. This gives a greater mechanical advantage than rigging to disadvantage.\n\nTo Disadvantage: As Line is Hauled DOWN, Weight Goes UP Blocks and Tackle ALL BLOCKS RIGGED TO DISADVANTAGE\n\n\"Rigged to Disadvantage\" - the pull on the rope is in the opposite direction to that in which the load is to be moved and where the hauling part is coming from the FIXED block; in other words, pulling DOWN on the hauling part LIFTS the weight. The hauling part is pulled from the fixed block. This gives less mechanical advantage than rigging to advantage.\n\nWhile rigging to advantage is obviously the most efficient use of equipment and resources, there are several reasons why rigging to disadvantage may be more desirable. The decision of which to use depends on pragmatic considerations for the total ergonomics of working with a particular situation. Lifting from a fixed point overhead is an obvious example of such a situation.\n\nThere are many different configurations by which a simple set of block and tackle can be arranged, but basically, the Total (NOT PER BLOCK) number of sheaves in the system determines the type:\n\nOne sheave - Whip, if reeved to disadvantage - (MA=1); Runner, if reeved to advantage - (MA=2)\n\nTwo sheaves - Gun Tackle, if reeved to disadvantage - (MA=2); if reeved to advantage - (MA=3)\n\nThree sheaves - Single Luff Tackle or Jigger, if reeved to disadvantage - (MA=3); Luff Tackle, if reeved to advantage - (MA=4)\n\nFour sheaves - Twofold Purchase, if reeved to disadvantage - (MA=4); Luff Tackle, if reeved to advantage - (MA=5)\n\nFive sheaves - Gyn Tackle (pronounced \"gin\"), if reeved to disadvantage - (MA=5); Double Luff Tackle, if reeved to advantage - (MA=6)\n\nSix sheaves - Threefold Purchase - if reeved to disadvantage - (MA=6); if reeved to advantage - (MA=7)\n\nMechanical Advantage (MA) of a Block and Tackle\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a block and tackle is equal to the number of parts (falls) in the line, that either attach to or run through the MOVING block, counting both upward and downward moving lines. For example, take a block and tackle with 2 sheaves on both the moving block and the fixed block. If one compares the blocks, one will see one block will have 4 lines running through its sheaves. The other will have 4 lines running through its sheaves (including the part of the line being pulled or hauled), with a 5th line attached to a secure point on the block. If the hauling part is coming out of the fixed block, the block and tackle will have a mechanical advantage of 4. If the tackle is reversed, so that the hauling part is coming from the moving block, the mechanical advantage is now 5.\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a block and tackle is relevant, because it dictates how much easier it is to haul or lift your load. A tackle with a mechanical advantage of 4 (a double tackle) will be able to lift 100 lbs with only 25 lbs of tension on the hauling part of the line. In the diagram on the right the mechanical advantage of the tackles shown is as follows:\n\nThe formula used to find the effort required to raise a given weight is:\n\nS * P = W + (nW)/10\n\nWhere:\n\nS is the power in the hauling part.\n\nP is the power gained by the purchase (this is the same as the number of parts at the moving block).\n\nn is the number of sheaves in the purchase.\n\nW is the weight lifted.\n\n10 is the denominator of the fraction for friction. An arbitrary 10%.\n\nMechanical advantage correlates directly with linear movement ratio. The linear movement of the line of a tackle refers to the relative linear movement of the hauling line to the hauled load. A line with a mechanical advantage of 4 has a velocity ratio of 4:1. In other words, to raise a load at 1 meter, 4 meters of line must be pulled from the hauling part of the rope.\n\nBlow Out - 1. to tear a sail from carrying too much wind; \"I'm afraid we might blow out a sail.\" 2) To slacken and dissipate, referring to a storm; as in: \"After several days the storm will blow itself out.\"\n\nBlower - an explosion proof fan used to exhaust explosive gasses overboard before activating engines or electrical equipment\n\nBluejacket - an enlisted man in the navy\n\nBlue Water - deep water offshore, beyond the continental shelf\n\nBlue Water Sailing - open ocean sailing, as opposed to being in a lake or sound\n\nBoard - to go onto a vessel\n\nBoard Boat - a small boat, usually cat rigged.

The player opens and closes the hand over the hole to change the pitch. Other parts of the boatswain's call are the keel, a flat piece of metal beneath the gun that holds the call together, and the shackle, a keyring that connects a long silver or brass chain that sits around the collar, when in ceremonial uniform. The historical use of the boatswain's call was a way to pass commands to the crew when the voice could not be heard over the sounds of the sea. Because of its high pitch, it could be heard over the activities of the crew and bad weather.\n\nBoatswain's Chair or Bos'n's Chair (Pronounced \"Bosun\") - a board seat on which a man working aloft is swung\n\nBoatwright - a builder of small vessels. A shipwright builds ships.\n\nBobstay - a stay attached to the bottom of the bowsprit and to the bow to hold the bowsprit down and counteract the force of the forestay. Many times there are two. On a vessel with a Dolphin Striker, this is called a Martingale. This needs to be very strong and not stretchable, so it is usually made of wire rope or heavy chain since it counteracts most of the upward and rearward pull of the foremast through the forestay.\n\nBody Plan - in a lines plan of a vessel, the sectional view of the hull as seen from the bow and stern\n\nBollard - a substantial vertical pillar to which lines may be made fast. Generally on the quayside rather than aboard ship.\n\nBolster - chafing gear made like a cushion, used where needed to protect rigging from wear\n\nBolt Rope - a rope sewn into the luff of a sail for use in attaching to the standing rigging\n\nBonaventure Mizzen Mast - in larger galleons, a fourth mast with, usually, a lateen-rigged mizzen\n\nBonnet - a strip of canvas laced onto the bottom of a loose footed jib in order to increase the sail area in fair weather. The bonnet is removed when wind velocity increases again.\n\nBooby Hatch - a small hatch through the deck of a ship with a raised frame and a sliding cover. This hatch is especially useful when the decks are awash, since the high sides keep the water from pouring in, and the small size of the opening limits the amount of water than can splash in\n\nBoom - the horizontal spar to which the foot of a fore & aft sail is attached\n\nBoom Bra - a padded protective cover for the boom head that keeps the boom head from denting a sailboard as the mast pivots forward during a fall.\n\nBoom Brake\n\nBoom Brake - a device designed to control the swing of the boom on a sailboat. The boom brake acts as a preventer when sailing downwind, and can also be used to jibe the mainsail in a slow controlled movement.\n\nUncontrolled jibes can be violent and often damage elements of the rig, and can knock crew overboard or inflict serious and sometimes fatal injuries to crew in the path of the boom or the mainsheet and associated hardware. The boom break helps avoid this.\n\nBoom Clamp - a lever on the boom head of a wishbone boom that tightens around and attaches the boom to the mast of a sailboard. Early models of sailboard booms didn't have a clamp. They had to be lashed to the boom. The boom clamp is a major improvement that has undergone many modifications and some current models are still much better than others.\n\nBoom Crotch or Crutch - a removable support to set the boom on when it is not in use to keep it from swinging\n\nBoom Head - the fore end piece on a wishbone boom that connects the two sides of the boom\n\nBoom Iron - a set of iron brackets near the outboard ends of a yard through which the studding sail boom is mounted to support studding sails out beyond the yard arm.\n\nBoom Jack - a boom vang\n\nBoomkin - a short horizontal spar extending from the stern of a vessel to which a sheet block is attached for a long, overhanging boom; or for vessels without running backstays, the backstay may be attached\n\nBoom Traveler - an arrangement of a wide metal bracket or horse often mounted athwartships on the cabin top or deck under the boom to which the sheet block is secured allowing it to move to the lee side at each tack.\n\nBoom Vang - a line attached to the bottom of the boom and the mast, a short distance from the mast, that adjusts downward tension on the boom. Also called a Boom Jack\n\nBoot - a wrapping or sheathing around the mast at the partners in order to keep water from going below. Also called a \"coat\"\n\nBoot Top - 1. a painted line on a vessel's hull that marks the designed load waterline (LWL). A vessel loaded such that its boot top is below water level is in extreme danger of either sinking or, if the overload is on or above decks, capsizing and turtling due to its new high center of gravity. Also, if a hull is given a new coat of paint, it extremely important that its boot top be repainted at the proper height on the hull. 2. the area between the water lines of a ship when fully loaded and when unloaded. The portion of the hull above the boot top is the \"topsides\" and the portion below is the \"bottom.\"\n\nBore - an incoming tide that advances as a sharply defined wave in certain rivers and inlets that have a long way to run over a gradually sloping bottom\n\nBos'n - See Boatswain\n\nBosun - See Boatswain\n\nBottlescrew - See Turnbuckle\n\nBottom - 1. that part of a vessel that is underwater 2. ground, the terrestrial surface submerged under the ocean, lake, river, etc.\n\nBottom Paint - specialized paint containing ingredients like copper and lead that are toxic to marine crustaceans and algea, applied to the bottom of boats to inhibit growth of marine life that can substantially reduce the speed and range of the vessel.\n\nBottom Sample - a portion of the material forming the bottom, brought up for inspection\n\nBouse - see \"Bowse\"\n\nBow - the front of the boat or sailboard See General Shipboard Directions illustration.\n\nBow and Quarter Line - a group of ships arranged such that each ship follows on the quarter of the ship ahead. With this type of convoy arrangement, each ship is clear of the wake of the ship ahead making it easier to keep up.\n\nBower - an anchor carried at the bow of a vessel\n\nBow Grace - pieces of scrap rigged around the bow at the waterline to protect the hull from ice damage\n\nBow Line - a painter or line to the bow\n\nBowline - 1. a simple hitch used to tie a fixed loop at the end of a line, identical in structure to the sheet bend, except it is tied in one line instead of tying two together. It is simple, strong, virtually slip proof, and easy to untie if not under strain. If under strain, it can be VERY difficult to untie. The Bowline is one of the eight most useful knots a sailor needs to know. 2. a rope fastened near the middle of the leech, or perpendicular edge of the square sails, by three or four subordinate parts, called bridles. It is only used when the wind is so unfavorable that the sails must be all braced sideways, or close-hauled to the wind: in this situation the bowlines are employed to keep the weather, or windward, edges of the principal sails tight forward and steady, without which they would be always shivering, and rendered incapable of service. 3. On a Bowline - beating into the wind\n\nBow Thruster - an auxiliary motor and propeller mounted athwartships at the bow, and employed to maneuver the ship sideways\n\nBowse - 1. to pull or hoist with a block and tackle 2. to secure something by wrapping with small stuff\n\nBowsprit - a near-horizontal spar extending from the bow of the boat, used as an anchor for the foremost mast by the forestay and offering additional space on which sails can be rigged\n\nBowsprit Shrouds - opposing cables or chains fitted horizontally from the end of the bowsprit to chainplates on the bow's sides to support the bowsprit from side to side.\n\nBox-Hauling - a method of veering or jibing a square rigged ship, without progressing to leeward appreciably. It is performed by heading bow to windward until most speed is lost, but steerage way is still barely maintained. The bow is then turned back downwind to the side it came from, aftermost sails are brailed up to spill the wind and to keep them from counteracting the turning force of the foresails, and the ship allowed to pivot quickly downwind without advancing. They are, however, extended as soon as the ship, in veering, brings the wind on the opposite quarter, as their effort then contributes to assist her motion or turning. Box-hauling is generally performed when the ship is too near the shore to have room for veering in the usual way. (Falconer- 1779)\n\nBoxing - an operation in sailing somewhat similar to box-hauling, but is a tack rather than wearing about or veering. It is performed by turning head to wind and backing the headsails, then, as sternway is made, reversing the helm to turn the bow down wind on the opposite side. Aftermost sails may be brailed up to keep them from counteracting the turning force of the foresails, and the ship allowed to pivot quickly downwind, then the brails released and the yards braced about again when the the wind hits the opposite quarter of the vessel to assist in turning. (Smith - 1629)\n\nBox the Compass - To state all 32 points of the compass, starting at north, proceeding clockwise. Sometimes applied to a wind that is constantly shifting.\n\nBrace - 1. a rope near the end of each yard by which a yard is swung about to alter its angle to the wind. 2. to swing or turn the yards of a ship by means of the braces. Yards are \"Braced Aback\" to bring the wind onto the forward side of the sail and to take way off the ship. They are \"Braced About\" to bring the ship onto the opposite tack and \"Braced Abox\" to bring the headyards flat aback to stop the ship. They are \"Braced In\" to bring the yards athwartships when running and they are \"Braced Sharp\" or \"Braced Up\" to make the yards as close as possible to fore-and-aft when sailing close-hauled.\n\nBrackish - half salt water and half fresh water, as where a river dumps into the seas\n\nBraided Line or Rope - a modern configuration of line that is braided instead of twisted. It may be single or double braided, one braid over another braided core. Easy to handle because it does not tend to tangle as much as twisted line\n\nBrails - 1. small ropes used to haul in or up the leeches, bottoms, and, sometimes, luff and corners of sails, for furling. These brails belong only to the two courses and the mizzen sail of a square rigged sailing vessel. The command is, \"Hale up the brails\", or, \"Brail up the sails.\" 2. a general name given to all the ropes which are employed to haul up, or collect to their yards, the bottoms, lower corners, and skirts of the other great sails, for the more ready furling them whenever it shall be necessary. The operation of thus drawing them together, is called brailing them up, or hauling them up in the brails. 3. ropes led from the leech on both sides of a fore-and-aft, loose-footed sail and secured to the mast at deck level, to gather the sail close to the mast, spilling wind and thereby slowing the ship. The command is \"Brail the sails,\" or \"Brail Up the sails.\"\n\nSome spritsails have a vertical batten set in a pocket about two to three feet aft of the luff, a series of brails run horizontally from points on the batten pocket through rings on the luff and splice into a line running down the mast. To shorten sail, the skipper eases the snotter and pulls on this reefing line, bringing the batten forward to the mast and thereby reducing sail area in one easy operation by as much as a third. He then secures the reefing line and the snotter.\n\nBrake - a device on the windlass on larger vessels to control or slow the descent of the anchor\n\nBrass - 1. an alloy of copper and zinc commonly used for fittings, accessories and decorative pieces on a vessel 2. senior officers\n\nBreach - 1. a hole or opening broken in the hull through which water will enter 2. to break an opening in the hull 3. the action of a whale when it leaps clear of the water 4. a leap of a whale clear of the water\n\nBreadth - an admeasurement term for the width or beam of a ship at its widest point across the deck\n\nBreak - 1. to dismantle and scrap a ship 2. for the crest of a wave to fall down the face of the wave 3. the joint or step between two deck levels\n\nBreakers - waves cresting and spilling over as they reach shallow water; surf\n\nBreak Out - to bring a piece of equipment out of storage and put it to use\n\nBreakwater - a man-made extension of the shoreline made to take the brunt of wave action and erosion and protect the waters on its lee side; a jetty\n\nBreaking Yard - a shipyard where ships are taken apart for scrap\n\nBream - to clean the bottom of a vessel using torches and scrapers\n\nBreast Hook - the joint in the heavy timbers of a wooden vessel that firmly connects the keel and the bow timbers\n\nBreast Line - a docking line going at approximately a right angle from the boat to the dock, usually at the bow and stern\n\nBreech - the opening in a block through which the line is rove See at Block on this page\n\nBreeches Buoy - a canvas seat shaped like breeches (pants) suspended under a life buoy which is swung from a tight hawser by a snatch block and used for hauling a man from one ship to another, or from a shipwreck to the shore.\n\nBridge - a structure above the weather deck of some modern ships, extending the full width of the vessel, which houses a command center, itself called by association, the bridge\n\nBridle - 1. a line attached at both ends in order to distribute the strain between the two points 2. a wire mounted transversely on deck of a small sailboat to which the main sheet block is secured allowing it to slide to the lee side at each tack.

A moveable ramp used for boarding/disembarking from and loading/unloading a vessel\n\nBrume - light fog or mist\n\nBrummel Hooks - a type of patented hook, used in pairs to quickly attach two lines or a line to a sail. These hooks are figure 8 shaped with a narrow beveled opening in the side of one of the loops of the eight so that when the openings of two hooks are held at right angles to each other, they will slide together or apart, but once joined and the angle changed, they hold like two links of chain. A very good, quick attachment device, however, caution should be considered in using brummel hooks in places like the clew attachment of a jib, where in tacking, the clew of the sail is thrown violently and erratically as it flaps, which might cause the openings to align properly and disengage.\n\nBuccaneer - a pirate and privateer of the Spanish coast of the Americas and Caribbean Sea\n\nBulb Keel - a fin keel with a large, heavy aerodynamically shaped weight at the very bottom to increase the vessel's lateral stability\n\nBulbous Bow - a large, rounded, forward protrusion below the waterline at the bow of many large displacement hulled, modern vessels.

Yacht clubs and their members may fly their club's burgee while underway and at anchor, day or night, but not while racing. Modern sailing vessels fly the burgee from a lanyard under the starboard spreader on the mast, while older sailing vessels fly the burgee from the main masthead. Power boats fly the burgee off a short staff on the bow.\n\nBurton - a light tackle having double or single blocks, used to hoist or tighten rigging.

Compare to \"Clam Cleat\"\n\nCamber - the convex curvature of a sail or deck.\n\nCamber Induced Sail - a sailboard sail that has internal or external camber inducers to help properly shape the sail\n\nCamber Inducer - a mechanical device, usually inside the mast sleeve of some sailboard sails that the fore (luff) end of a batten fits into and either wraps around or partially wraps around the mast, keeping the fore end of the batten centered on the mast, thus enabling tension on the batten to create a forced, semi-rigid, camber (curvature) in the sail.\n\nCan - a type of navigation buoy, the above-water portion of which is in the shape of a cylinder. View a downloadable and printable US Coast Guard brochure about buoys and other aids to navigation.\n\nCanal - an artificial waterway that has been dug, dredged or constructed to carry vessels\n\nCanister Shot - a type of anti personnel cannon load in which lead balls or other loose metallic items were enclosed in a tin, wooden, or iron shell. On firing the shell would disintegrate releasing the smaller metal objects. Canister shot pretty well replaced Grapeshot in the early 19th century. The canister gave improved range, better dispersal and allowed higher velocity powder loads. See also Grapeshot, Cannon Balls, and Chain Shot.\n\nCannon Balls - Solid, round projectiles fired from a cannon in order to sink, dismast, and do other structural damage to one's enemy's ship, along with killing him, if possible. Cannon balls were fired at great distance, but as vessels grew nearer, Chain Shot was substituted in order to dismast and destroy rigging on the enemy's vessel, then Canister Shot, or Grapeshot were substituted at close range...and if you wished to set the enemy on fire, either heat cannon balls in a furnace to red hot or use Carcasses\n\nCant - a cut made in the body of a whale behind the neck and used for hauling the body on board\n\nCanting Ballast Twin Foil (CBTFÃ) - technology that differs from a canting keel system in that the boat has twin rudders-one forward of the canting keel strut and one aft of the keel strut. The \"rudders\" perform the function of both the keel and rudder on a normal fixed keel boat relieving the canting keel strut of having to produce mostly lateral resistance.\n\nCanting Keel - a form of sailing ballast, suspended from a rigid canting strut beneath the boat, which can be swung to windward of a boat under sail, in order to counteract the heeling force of the sail. The canting keel must be able to pivot to either port or starboard, depending on the current tack. The purpose of the canting keel is to allow the boat to develop righting moment when level, by swinging the keel to windward independent of the boat's angle of heel. With the canting keel handling the ballast functions, lateral resistance and steering can be managed separately with a foil (or pair of foils fore and aft). This allows for much quicker maneuverability than traditional keelboats, with about half the weight usually required for ballast.\n\nCant Purchase - a long block and tackle arrangement mounted at the head of the mainmast and leading to a whale alongside and used for hauling the carcass aboard. The weight of the whale on the tackle would cause the ship to lean (cant)\n\nCant Timbers - heavy frames at the bow and stern that are not perpendicular to the keel, but rather radiate at an angle to support the curving topsides of the hull\n\nCanvas - 1. a tightly woven fabric, originally made of hemp, linen, then cotton, used for sails and awnings. New sails are usually made of Dacron and Nylon or composites. 2. all encompassing term for a set of sails\n\nCape - a promontory or headland protruding into a body of water\n\nCapping - the fore-and-aft finishing piece on top of the clamp and sheer strake, at the frame heads, in an open boat\n\nCapsize - 1. to turn a boat over. 2. for a knot to fall apart or come undone 3. to turn a knot inside out\n\nCapstan - 1. a vertical drum, revolving on a spindle, used for reeling in heavy line or chain. 2. During the \"Age of Sail\", a large round hub, on a vertical axis, that sat on an upper deck and drove the windlass on a lower deck via a shaft in order to raise the anchor. Removable levers, known as Bars, were inserted into the capstan for men to push on as they walked around the capstan to raise the anchor. Some larger ships had two capstans on separate decks driving the windlass on yet another deck, in order to allow more men room to push. The anchor chain or line came up from the side of the ship, through the hawse-hole, around the windlass, then into the hold or anchor chain locker. On some ships rather than the anchor rode or chain being wrapped around the capstan, a messenger, which is a continuous loop attached near the front of the ship, then to the capstan, and nippers, short, detachable lines to connect the messenger and rode, were used. Over time, several forms existed. See Capstan at Wikipedia for more information.\n\nCapstan Chantey (pronounced \"shan'-tee\") - a rhythmic sea song with a short repetitive answering chorus, sung by the crew as they trod around the capstan pushing on the bars to raise the anchor or other heavy object. The rhythm helped them to act in unison, and gave them heart for the hard work.\n\nCaptain - 1. the person on board a vessel and who is in charge of the vessel and legally responsible for it and its occupants 2. a naval officer having a rank equivalent to a full colonel\n\nCaptain of the Fleet - a temporary adjutant-general who is in charge of discipline aboard the ships of a fleet\n\nCaptain's Mast - a disciplinary hearing aboard a naval vessel at which the captain hears testimony about offenses committed on the ship and administers appropriate punishment\n\nCar - a sliding fitting that attaches to a track allowing for the adjustment of blocks or other devices attached to the car\n\nCaravel - see Types of Sailboats\n\nCarbon Fiber - a modern, light weight, strong, composite made of carbon fibers and epoxy used in masts and other sailing components\n\nCarcass - hollow iron cannon balls filled with resin, turpentine, tallow, salt peter, sulphur, and antimony, producing a fire that was, in a wooden ship, almost impossible to extinguish. They were rarely used because without extreme caution, they were more danger to the user than the enemy. Compare to Grapeshot, Cannon Balls, Chain Shot, and Canister Shot\n\nCardinal Points - the four primary directions on a compass: North, East, South, and West\n\nCareening - to cause the ship to tilt on its side, usually to clean or repair the hull below the water line.

See Types of Sailboats\n\nCarronade - a short smoothbore, cast iron cannon, developed for the Royal Navy by the Carron Company, Scotland, UK used from the 1770s to the 1860s. The carronade was designed as a short-range naval weapon with a low muzzle velocity. The lower muzzle velocity of a carronade's round shot was intended to create many more of the deadly wooden splinters when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel, leading to its nickname, the smasher. A carronade was much shorter and a third to a quarter of the weight of an equivalent long gun: a 32 pounder carronade, for example, weighed less than a ton, but a 32 pounder long gun weighed over 3 tons. Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun calibers (12, 18, 24, 32 and 42 pounders, but 6 pdr and 68 pdr versions are known), but they were not counted in a ship of the line's rated number of guns. The classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can therefore mislead, since they would often be carrying more pieces of ordnance than they were described as carrying.\n\nCarry Away - to break loose or tear off; said of gear that has exceeded its strength capabilities, as \"The storm jib was just carried away.\"\n\nCarved or Carving Jibe (Gybe) - any of several high speed planing jibes initiated by taking the rear foot out of the strap and placing it near the leeward rail of a sailboard, shifting weight to that rail in order to make the board turn in that direction, flipping the sail as you pass through straight downwind, then exiting the jibe, still at planing speed. Go To \"Jibe\"\n\nCarvel Built - a method of constructing a wooden boat's hull by fixing planks to a frame so that the planks butt up against each other, edge to edge, gaining support from the frame and forming a smooth hull. Such planking requires caulking between the joints over and above that needed by the Clinker Built or Lapstrake technology, but gives a stronger hull capable of taking a variety of full-rigged sail plans, albeit one of greater weight. See illustration at Clinker Built\n\nCast Away - forced from a ship by disaster\n\nCastaway - a crew member or passenger of a vessel that survives its sinking and is left adrift or stranded\n\nCasting Line - a heaving line\n\nCast Off - to release lines holding boat to shore or mooring, to release sheets\n\nCat - 1.

They are used to draw the anchors up to the top of the side without injuring the bow.\n\nCat O'Nine Tails - short, knotted, nine-tailed whip kept by the bosun's mate to flog sailors (and soldiers in the Army). When not in use, the cat was kept in a baize bag, hence the term \"letting the cat out of the bag\". \"Not enough room to swing a cat\" also derives from this. The \"cat\" is believed to date back to ancient Egypt where the domestic cat was sacred and, even then, was said to have nine lives. The Egyptians believed that when beaten with cat hide, the victim gained virtue from the whip.\n\nCaulk - to fill gaps with waterproof compound or materials to make watertight\n\nCavitation - 1. a condition where bubbles or vacuum form around a propeller allowing it to spin without resistance and making it lose its ability to drive a vessel forward. 2. a condition where air bubbles form along the windward (low pressure) side of a sailboard fin making it lose its ability to offer lateral resistance and propel the board forward\n\nCay (Pronounced \"Kee\") - one of a chain of small low lying tropical islands composed of coral or sand. Same as \"Key\".\n\nCeiling - the inside lining of the hull.

The centerboard typically will self retract by swinging backward and upward while making headway if it hits bottom in shallow water and its angle and depth can be adjusted to lessen drag, increase stability, or increase the ability to sail upwind. The deeper it is adjusted, the more drag it creates, the more stability it creates, and the more easily the craft will sail upwind\n\nCenterline - 1. a vertical line running from bow to stern through the middle of a craft. 2. In a lines plan of a vessel, a vertical line that represents the plane that divides the vessel in half, and from which half-breadths are measured.\n\nCenter of Effort - an invisible point on a sail where the combination of all the aerodynamic forces converge. The point where the sail \"seems\" to pull from. It is above the boom of a sailboard at the deepest point in the curvature of the sail. This point will move with changes in the wind velocity, downhaul tension, batten tension, and outhaul tension.\n\nCenter of Lateral Resistance - a point on the bottom of a watercraft where the combination of all the hydrodynamic forces converge. It is in the center keel or of the centerboard when the centerboard is down and near the fin or skeg on a sailboard if a centerboard is not down\n\nCertificate - an official government paper, such as a seaman's, boat's, or master's license, allowing the operation of a commercial vessel\n\nChafe - damage to a line caused by rubbing against another object\n\nChafing Gear - Cloth, tape, baggywrinkle or other material attached to lines or other rigging to avoid abrasion\n\nChain Locker - storage space for the anchor chain and rode\n\nChain Pipe - an aperture through which a chain, rode, or cable passes from the chain-well to the deck above.\n\nChain Well - storage space for the anchor chain and rode\n\nChainplate - metal plate with an eye, bolted to the deck or side of a gunwale, to which standing rigging is attached\n\nChain Shot - Cannon balls linked together with a chain and fired in order to do structural damage to the enemy's rigging and masts.

The sides of a block or gun-carriage.\n\nChess Tree - a piece of wood fastened with iron bolts on each top-side of the ship. Used for boarding the main-tack to, or hauling home the clews of the main-sail or course, for which purpose there is a hole in the upper part, or deadeyes or blocks attached, through which the tack passes, that extends the clew of the sail to windward. Where chain has been substituted for rope, iron plates with thimble-eyes are used for chess-trees.\n\nChicken Jibe (Gybe) - turning a fore-and-aft rigged vessel upwind and tacking through more than 180 degrees to avoid having to jibe on a downwind course. While much slower, this technique avoids the dangers of passing the boom across the boat under load. This is the opposite of a square rigged vessel \"Wearing Ship\". Go To \"Jibe\"\n\nChilled Shot - cannon balls made of very rapidly cooled cast-iron, i.e. cast in iron moulds, and thus found to acquire a hardness which renders them of nearly equal efficiency with steel shot for penetrating iron plates, yet produced at about one-quarter the price. They invariably break up on passing through the plates, and their fragments are very destructive on crowded decks; though in the attack of iron war vessels, where the demolishment of guns, carriages, machinery, turrets, etc., is required, steel shot is superior. Compare to Grapeshot, Cannon Balls, Chain Shot, and Canister Shot\n\nChine - 1. A relatively sharp angle in a hull, as compared to the rounded bottoms of most traditional boat hulls. 2. A line formed where the side panels of a boat meet the bottom panels. Soft chine is when the two sides join at a shallow angle, and hard chine is when they join at a steep angle. Chine is not seen on round bottom vessels.\n\nChine Log - an internal, longitudinal timber that runs from stem to stern at the chine of a vessel\n\nChip Log - a simple, old, speed measuring device consisting of a wooden board, in the shape of a quarter circle, attached to a line (the log-line). The log-line has a number of knots tied in it at uniform, measured, spacings. The log-line is wound on a reel to allow it to be paid out easily in use. The Chip is thrown overboard at the stern of the vessel and as the line pays out, it is timed, thus the speed of the vessel can be calculated. The log-line is attached to the board with a bridle of three lines connected to the vertex and to the two ends of the quadrant's arc. In order to ensure that the log submerges and is oriented correctly, the bottom of the log is weighted with lead. This provides for more resistance in the water and a more accurate and repeatable reading of speed. The bridle is attached in such a way that a strong tug on the log-line results in one or two of the bridle's lines releasing, allowing the log to be retrieved with relative ease. See Chip Log at Wikipedia. Compare to Dutchman's Log and Taffrail Log\n\nChock - a guide or fairlead for an anchor, mooring or docking line, attached to the deck See illustration at Deck Fittings on this page\n\nChock-a-Block - rigging blocks that are so tight against one another that they cannot be further tightened Sometimes called Two-Blocked\n\nChop - a series of small waves that tend to make your ride rough or \"choppy.\"\n\nChord - an imaginary line drawn between the luff and the leech of a sail and parallel to the water's surface. Used for describing sail shape.\n\nChronometer - a ship's clock. Before GPS units were used, these needed to be extremely accurate on long voyages in order to determine a ship's longitude\n\nChute - another name for Spinnaker Derived from \"parachute\" because of their similar appearance.\n\nCivil Twilight - See Twilight\n\nClam Cleat - a tensioning device for a line that has opposing, stationary teeth in a \"V\" or \"Wedge\" configuration to grip the line pulled through them and hold the tension on the line. Also called by the ambiguous name, \"Line Stopper\". Compare to \"Cam Cleat\"\n\nClamp - a main longitudinal strengthening member under the deck in decked-over boats that acts as the bearer of beams and joints, and at the gunwale in open boats\n\nClasses - organized groups for racing boats that are either of identical specifications and measurements, or have variable measurements and fit a formula, designed to compensate for boat performance, and thus, put a premium on skill and tactics\n\nClaw Off - to beat to windward away from a lee shore\n\nCleat - a horned, stationary fitting used to secure a line See illustration at Deck Fittings on this page\n\nClenched Nail - a nail whose tip has been bent back into the wood to lock it in place; most often used in lapstrake planking\n\nClevis Pin - a cylindrical pin that secures one fitting to another\n\nClew - the lower aft corner of a sail, where the leech meets the foot, and where the outhaul or sheet is tied and is adjusted. On a square rigged sail, the lower corners of the sail. Square sails have sheets attached to their clews like triangular sails, but the sheets are used to pull the sail down to the yard below rather than to adjust the angle it makes with the wind. Sails hang from a yard on a square rigger and the yard is swung about to alter its angle to the wind with its braces.\n\nClew First - sailing with the sail of a sailboard reversed; clew ahead of the mast\n\nClewgarnets - tackles attached to the clewlines of square sails, on the yards above, used to truss up or clew up the sails (i.e. to pull the clews up onto the upper yard or the mast in preparation for furling the sail).\n\nClew Lines - lines attached to the clews of square sails and to the yards above, used to truss up or clew up the sails (i.e. to pull the clews up onto the upper yard or the mast, using the clewgarnets, in preparation for furling the sail).\n\nClinker Built or Lapstrake\n\nCompared to Carvel Built Hulls\n\nClinker Built - a method of constructing hulls of boats and ships by fixing wooden planks and, in the early nineteenth century, iron plates to each other so that the planks overlap along their edges. The overlapping joint is called a land. In any but a very small boat, the individual planks will also be joined end to end; the whole length of one of these composite planks is a strake. Same as \"Lapstrake\" Compare to Carvel Built.\n\nClipper - a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century that had multiple masts and a square rig. They were generally narrow for their length, could carry limited bulk freight, small by later 19th century standards, and had a large total sail area. While traditional merchant ships were accustomed to average speeds of under 5 knots (9 km/h; 6 mph),clippers aimed at 9 knots (17 km/h; 10 mph) or better. Some could reach 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph). The fastest recorded speed for any sailing vessel during this time was a clipper, Sovereign of the Seas, traveling at 22 knots (41 km/h; 25 mph) in 1854. Clippers were built for seasonal trades such as tea, where an early cargo was more valuable, or for passenger routes. The small, fast ships were ideally suited to low-volume, high-profit goods, such as spices, tea, people, and mail. Given their speed and maneuverability, clippers frequently mounted cannon or carronade and were often employed in piracy, privateering, smuggling, or interdiction service.\n\nClipper Bow - the sharp bow of a vessel whose stem creates a concave curve and projects outboard\n\nClose Aboard - not on, but near a vessel\n\nClose Hauled - a point of sail where the boat is sailing as close to the wind as effectively possible without luffing the sails or becoming in irons. Maximize window at Points of Sail Illustration to see more detail.(Opens in new window)\n\nClose Reach - a point of sail where the boat is sailing towards the wind but is not close hauled or in irons. Maximize window at Points of Sail Illustration to see more detail.(Opens in new window)\n\nClose-Winded - a vessel that is capable of sailing very well upwind\n\nClosing the Gap - sailing a sailboard in high winds with the mast raked back so the foot of the sail almost touches the deck of the board.\n\nClove Hitch - a simple hitch used to tie a line to a post. Effective in its purpose, but spills easily. It should be finished with at least one half hitch over the standing end of the line, if not two. The Clove Hitch is one of the eight most useful knots a sailor needs to know.\n\nClub - 1. a boom for a jib on a vessel so rigged. 2. a spar laced to the foot of a jib, or sometimes to the after edge of a quadrilateral, fore-and-aft rigged sail like that on a log canoe.\n\nClub Footed Jib - a jib with boom or \"club\" on the foot of the sail\n\nClub Hauling - a maneuver in which a ship drops one of its anchors at high speed in order to turn abruptly. This was sometimes used as a means to quickly get a good firing angle on a pursuing vessel.\n\nCoaming - the raised edge around a hatch, cockpit or skylight that helps keep water on deck from running below\n\nCoastal Current - an ocean current flowing roughly parallel to a coast, outside the surf zone\n\nCoastal Refraction - a small change in the direction of travel of radio waves as they cross a shoreline obliquely\n\nCoaster - a vessel that stays near land rather than venture out to sea\n\nCockbill - a yard having one yardarm cocked higher than the other\n\nCockpit - the area, below deck level, that is somewhat more protected than the open deck, from which the tiller or wheel is handled\n\nCoffee Grinder - a geared, pedesta"
