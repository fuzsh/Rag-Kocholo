They have contributed in many ways to the growth, diversity and development of the country.\n\nIn conjunction with both the United Nations’ initiatives for the International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024), and Black History Month, this portrait aims to highlight the diversity of the Black population in terms of their ethnic and cultural origins, places of birth and languages.\n\nStart of text box\n\nPopulation of interest\n\nThere are many different ways to define and measure the population of interest: a vastly diverse community of people in terms of history, ethnic and cultural origins, place of birth, religion and languages.\n\nFor this portrait, the population refers to persons who self-identified as \"Black\" in the population group question in the Census of Population. Since the 1996 Census, “Black” is one of the population groups listed on the census questionnaire. Respondents can choose to mark one or more population group, or to specify another group. With the exception of respondents who identified as belonging to both Black and White groups, multiple responses are excluded from this analysis.\n\nSource: Statistics Canada, 2016 Census of Population 2A-L questionnaire.\n\nDescription for questionnaire\n\nThe image shows question 19 on population groups from the 2016 Census of Population 2A-L questionnaire. Respondents were asked 'Is this person:' and were instructed to mark one or more of the 11 mark-in categories, or to specify another group in the write-in space, if applicable. The list of mark-in categories are the following:\n\nWhite\n\nSouth Asian (e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.)\n\nChinese\n\nBlack\n\nFilipino\n\nLatin American\n\nArab\n\nSoutheast Asian (e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai, etc.)\n\nWest Asian (e.g., Iranian, Afghan, etc.)\n\nKorean\n\nJapanese\n\nOther - specify\n\nEnd of text box\n\nIn 2016, close to 1.2 million people in Canada reported being Black\n\nData table for Chart 1\n\nData table for chart 1\n\nTable summary\n\nThis table displays the results of Data table for chart 1 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016, calculated using number and percent units of measure (appearing as column headers). 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016 number Canada 28,528,125 29,639,030 31,241,030 32,852,320 34,460,060 Black population 573,860 662,215 783,800 945,665 1,198,545 percent Percentage of Canada's population 2.0 2.2 2.5 2.9 3.5\n\nIn 20 years, the Black population has doubled in size, going from 573,860 persons in 1996 to 1,198,540 persons in 2016.\n\nAmong the Black population, 12% have reported being both “White” and “Black” in the 2016 Census.\n\nThe Black population now accounts for 3.5% of Canada’s total population and 15.6% of the population defined as a visible minority.\n\nAccording to the population projections from Statistics CanadaNote 1, the Black population would continue to increase and could represent between 5.0% and 5.6% of Canada’s population by 2036.\n\nBoth international net migration (difference between immigration and emigration) and natural increase (difference between births and deaths) have contributed to the growth of the Black population in Canada.\n\nThe Black population is a young population…\n\nData table for Chart 2\n\nData table for chart 2\n\nTable summary\n\nThis table displays the results of Data table for chart 2. The information is grouped by Age group (appearing as row headers), Black population , Total population , Male and Female , calculated using percent units of measure (appearing as column headers).

The median age for the Black population was 29.6 years, while it was 40.7 years for the total population.\n\nChildren under 15 years old represented 26.6% of the Black population, while they represented 16.9% of the total population. At the other end of the age spectrum, 7.3% of the Black population were aged 65 years and over, compared to 15.9% of the total population.\n\nSimilar to the total population, there are slightly more Black women than Black men. In 2016, 51.6% of the Black population was comprised of women. This was similar to the proportion in the total Canadian population, where 50.8% of the population was comprised of women.\n\n…with a history in Canada\n\nCanada is the top place of birth of the Black population. In 2016, more than four in 10 Black people were born in Canada.\n\nData table for Chart 3\n\nData table for chart 3\n\nTable summary\n\nThis table displays the results of Data table for chart 3 Black population and Total population, calculated using percent units of measure (appearing as column headers).

The discriminatory policy based on race or national origins was removed and the first point-based system focusing on criteria such as occupational skills, education and knowledge of official languages was introduced to select economic immigrants.\n\nAmong those who still lived in Canada in 2016, the majority of the Black immigrants who landed in the 1980s and 1990s were sponsored by their family already living in the country.\n\nWomen outnumbered men among those who were admitted in these two decennials. Most of them came from Jamaica and Haiti.\n\nBy contrast, the largest share (40.3%) of Black newcomers (2011 to 2016) were admitted under the economic program. About three in 10 Black newcomers were refugees.\n\nTop countries of birth of economic newcomers were: Nigeria, Haiti, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire and Jamaica.\n\nTop countries of birth of new refugees were: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Haiti, Somalia and Ethiopia.\n\nAbout 44,285 Black people were non-permanent residents in Canada in 2016. They were living temporarily in Canada on a work or study permit or as refugee claimants (asylum seekers).\n\nThe source regions of immigration have changed over time\n\nData table for Chart 7\n\nData table for chart 7\n\nTable summary\n\nThis table displays the results of Data table for chart 7 Before 1981, 1981 to 1990, 1991 to 2000, 2001 to 2010 and 2011 to 2016, calculated using percent units of measure (appearing as column headers).

The top countries of birth for Black immigrants admitted between 2011 and 2016 were Haiti, Nigeria, Jamaica, Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nMore than 170 different places of birth for the Black immigrants in Canada\n\nData table for Map\n\nMap: \"Place of birth of Black immigrants, Canada 2016\" shows a world map where countries of birth are shaded based on total number of Canada's Black immigrants. The categories include: less than 100 immigrants, between 100 and less than 1,000 immigrants, between 1,000 and less than 10,000 immigrants, between 10,000 and less than 25,000 immigrants and 25,000 immigrants and more.\n\nGeographic regions are mentioned and the number and percentage of Black immigrants who were born in each are noted. An arrow from each region points towards Canada. The size of each arrow denotes the size of the population originating from the corresponding region.\n\nGoing from the left side of the world map to the right:\n\n1. Elsewhere in the Americas - 29,370 Black immigrants, or 4.7%\n\n2. Caribbean and Bermuda - 285,090 Black immigrants, or 45.7%\n\n3. Africa - 285,130 Black immigrants, or 45.8%\n\n4.

Various factors can explain why people report more than one origin, such as mixed marriages between people from different ethnic or cultural backgrounds or knowledge of family history.\n\nAfrican and Caribbean origins are the most common ethnic origins reported by the first and second Black generations in Canada. Jamaican, AfricanNote 3, and Haitian are the three most common origins reported by the foreign-born Black population (first generation in Canada), while Jamaican, Canadian and Haitian were reported by the second generation (born in Canada, with at least one parent born abroad).\n\nThe third generation or more have a longer history in the country. They have reported less often Caribbean and African origins. It includes: Canadian, Jamaican, AfricanNote 3, English, Irish, Scottish, French and First Nations (North American) origins.\n\nThe mother tongues reported among the first generation Black population are much more diverse than the mother tongues among the third generation or more\n\nData table for Figure 2\n\nData table for Figure 2\n\nTable summary\n\nThis table displays the results of Data table for Figure 2 Percent (appearing as column headers).

Overall, more than 100 languages were reported as a mother tongue by the Black population in the country.\n\nA higher percent of people within the Black population (28.0%) speak French at home compared to the total population (23.3%)\n\nThe Black population is more likely to speak a language other than English or French at home (28.0% - when all categories are taken into consideration) than the total population (21.8%). In many cases, the Black population speaks English or French primarily at home, in addition to other languages on a regular basis.\n\nBoth the Black population and the total population show similar percentages for those who speak English at home – around 74%.\n\nThe vast majority of the Black population live in large urban areas\n\nIn 2016, 94.3% of Black people lived in Canada’s census metropolitan areas (CMAs), compared with 71.2% of the country’s total population.\n\nToronto, Montréal, Ottawa-Gatineau, Edmonton and Calgary were each home to at least 50,000 people who reported being Black in 2016.\n\nToronto has the largest Black population in the country, with 442,015 people or 36.9% of Canada’s Black population. The size of this population has increased in 15 years, but it now represents a smaller share of Canada’s Black population than in 2001 (46.9%).\n\nCMAs of Ottawa-Gatineau (Quebec part), Lethbridge and Moncton had the fastest growing Black population in the country between 1996 and 2016.\n\nBlack people represented 7.5% of Toronto’s total population, the highest proportion among census metropolitan areas. Montréal and Ottawa-Gatineau had the second and third highest proportions.\n\nData table for Chart 9\n\nData table for chart 9\n\nTable summary\n\nThis table displays the results of Data table for chart 9 Black population in census metropolitan areas, calculated using percent units of measure (appearing as column headers).

It provides a demographic overview of the Black population, as well as key statistics related to their ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity and a few geographical highlights. However, this portrait is not meant to be exhaustive.\n\nAlthough it highlights the great diversity within the Black population, it does not present any result related to the several challenges and issues faced by many members of Black communities in Canada.\n\nChallenges and issues such as those related to labour market integration, income inequalities, differential access to resources, health conditions, discrimination, school dropout, etc., may impact differently various groups within the Black population. Moreover, although the Black population generally has similar characteristics compared to the overall population, they often present different socio-economic outcomes. For example, the unemployment rate for the Black population is higher than for Canada’s total population.\n\nDisaggregated 2016 Census data tables with selected demographic, cultural, labour market and income characteristics are available on Statistics Canada’s Census program website which can provide insights on similarities and differences within the Black population as well as between the Black population and other populations in Canada.\n\nNew analytical products will be released later which will describe in more detail the characteristics of Canada’s Black population, as well as their socio-economic outcomes.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis portrait was prepared by Hélène Maheux and Deniz Do, analysts of the Social and Aboriginal Statistics Division.
