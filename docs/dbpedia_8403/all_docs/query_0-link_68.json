        "text": "Belarusians are an ethnic group belonging to the East Slavic group and are the native population of Belarus, a country located in Eastern Europe. It borders Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. Some historians consider the inhabitants of the Belarusian Polesie region as a separate ethnic group. The culture and traditions of Belarusians share common features with the customs of Russians, Poles, and Ukrainians.\n\nBelarusians make up more than 80% of the population of Belarus. Due to its historical past, Belarus is home to many other ethnic groups, some of which have been living there for several generations:\n\nRussians (7.5%) have long been residing in the territory of Belarus. A significant influx was registered after World War II.\n\nPoles (3.1%) have been living in the western part of the country for centuries.\n\nUkrainians (1.7%) - the largest influx was registered in the 18th-19th centuries.\n\nJews (0.1%): The first Jews settled in Belarus in the 15th century. Since the early 1980s, due to emigration to Israel and other countries, the Jewish population in Belarus has decreased to less than 30,000 people.\n\nBelarus is also home to Tatars, Roma, Lithuanians, and Latvians. [1]\n\nThe origins of the Belarusian people have different interpretations among historians. According to one view, Belarusians emerged through the mixing of various Eastern Slavic tribes, including the Volhynians, Radimichs, Krivichs, and others. Another perspective suggests that the Belarusian identity formed through the assimilation of a Baltic sub-ethnic group with the Slavs. Additionally, some scholars explore the possibility of a Finno-Ugric influence on the Belarusian ancestral roots.\n\nDuring the medieval period, the territory of present-day Belarus was inhabited by different principalities, among which the notable ones were Polotsk, which separated from the Kievan Rus, Turov-Pinsk situated in the Polesie region, and Hrodna with its capital in Grodno.\n\nIn the 13th century, these principalities embraced Christianity, and the development of writing systems based on the Church Slavonic language took place. This period coincided with the formation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which encompassed modern-day Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, parts of Russia, Poland, , Estonia, and Latvia. Subsequently, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth emerged as a federation through an agreement between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. However, by the late 18th century, this federation was divided among the Kingdom of Prussia, the Austrian Empire, and the Russian Empire. The Belarusian territories became part of the Russian state, and Belarusians were classified as a sub-ethnic group within the Russian people.\n\nIn 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution, the Belarusian Socialist Soviet Republic was established as part of the Soviet Union. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus gained independence and became a sovereign nation.\n\nBelarusian is one of the Slavic languages belonging to the East Slavic group. It traces its roots back to the Old East Slavic language. There are two main dialects of Belarusian: the Northeastern dialect (including the Polotsk and Vitebsk-Mogilev speech groups) and the Southwestern dialect (covering the Grodno-Baranovichi and Slutsk-Mozyr speech groups), which differ in pronunciation.\n\nBelarusian is one of the official languages of the Republic of Belarus. It is also spoken in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Kazakhstan, Canada, the United States, and Argentina. The total number of Belarusian speakers is estimated to be around 4.3 million people (as of 2000), with 3.683 million people (37% of the population) in Belarus itself (according to the 1999 census). Out of the population in Belarus, 7.403 million people (74%) consider Belarusian as their native language. In Russia, approximately 174,000 people speak Belarusian (as of the 2010 census), while in Poland, the number is around 200,000 people (according to estimates from 2002).[2]\n\nArt\n\nMonumental painting has thrived in Belarus throughout the centuries. Polotsk, a cultural and artistic center, has preserved unique monuments of ancient Belarusian church architecture and art, including the 12th-century frescoes in the Spaso-Preobrazhenskaya Church. Belarusian painting experienced new developments in the secular and icon-painting schools, while weaving manufactories produced renowned tapestries. In the late 18th to 19th centuries, Belarusian painting embraced Romanticism, Classicism, and Realism. Notable artists include Marc Chagall, Kazimir Malevich, and Yudel Pen. Belarusian art also excels in decorative and applied art, with a Guinness World Record-breaking tapestry.[3]\n\nLiterature\n\nBelarusian literature has a rich and diverse history that reflects the cultural and linguistic identity of the Belarusian people. It encompasses various genres, including poetry, prose, drama, and folklore. The origins of Belarusian literature can be traced back to the 16th century when the first printed books in the Belarusian language emerged.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Belarusian national awakening led to a flourishing literary movement. Prominent writers such as Yakub Kolas and Yanka Kupala played a pivotal role in shaping Belarusian literature and raising awareness of national identity. Their works explored themes of love for the homeland, rural life, and social justice.\n\nIn the Soviet era, Belarusian literature experienced a period of censorship and ideological control. However, writers like Vasil Byka≈≠ and Ivan Melezh remained committed to preserving the Belarusian language and culture through their works, often addressing historical and contemporary social issues.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarusian literature entered a new phase of creativity and exploration. Writers such as Svetlana Alexievich gained international recognition, receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2015 for her powerful works of non-fiction, which give voice to ordinary people and historical events.\n\nMusic\n\nBelarusian music is characterized by its rich folk traditions and a blend of influences from neighboring countries. Traditional Belarusian music is known for its distinct vocal harmonies and use of traditional instruments such as the duda (bagpipe), zhaleika (reed pipe), and the Belarusian lyre.\n\nIn the 20th century, Belarusian classical music emerged with notable composers like Yefrem Podgayets and Stanislau Moniuszko, who incorporated folk elements into their compositions. The National Academic Bolshoi Opera and Ballet Theatre in Minsk is renowned for its performances of both Belarusian and international operas and ballets.\n\nContemporary Belarusian music encompasses various genres, including pop, rock, folk, and electronic music. Artists such as Lyapis Trubetskoy, N.R.M., and Navi have gained popularity both within Belarus and internationally.\n\nCostume\n\nBelarusian national costume is a vibrant reflection of the country's rich cultural heritage. It consists of intricate garments adorned with elaborate embroidery and decorative motifs. Traditional attire for women includes embroidered blouses, long skirts, and headscarves, while men wear embroidered shirts, trousers, and hats. The use of vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and handcrafted accessories adds a distinctive charm to Belarusian traditional costumes. These garments are worn on special occasions and cultural events, symbolizing the pride and identity of the Belarusian people.\n\nCuisine\n\nBelarusian cuisine is a delicious reflection of the country's agricultural traditions and hearty flavors. It features a variety of dishes that highlight local produce and culinary techniques. Potatoes are a staple ingredient in Belarusian cuisine and are used in various forms, including draniki (potato pancakes) and babka (potato-based bread). Another popular dish is machanka, a thick sauce made with meat and served over draniki or bread.\n\nMeat dishes play a significant role in Belarusian cuisine, with classics like kalduny (meat-stuffed dumplings) and macherel (stuffed pork) being favorites. Smoked meats, such as salo (cured pork fat) and kielbasa (sausages), are also prominent. Dairy products, especially sour cream and cottage cheese, are widely used in dishes like syrniki (cottage cheese pancakes) and blinchiki (crepes).\n\nBelarusian cuisine is known for its hearty soups, including the popular borscht and solyanka. Mushrooms, berries, and forest fruits are abundant in Belarus and are incorporated into various dishes, such as mushroom soup and berry-filled desserts."
