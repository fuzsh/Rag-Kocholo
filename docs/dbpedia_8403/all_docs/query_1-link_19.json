        "text": "On February 24, 2022, in the early hours of the 104th anniversary of Estonia’s independence, Russia launched a full-scale war in Ukraine. This drastically and irreversibly changed the course of developments in the region and more broadly. While Estonia faced no immediate security threat, the war triggered major social, economic, and political challenges. Despite these complex threats, Estonia maintained its status as a solid democratic nation as it approached the 2023 election year.\n\nEstonia reacted swiftly and strongly to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It was among the first countries to provide military equipment in December 2021, when Russian forces were gathering on the Ukrainian border, and donated military aid to Ukraine equivalent to one third of its own military budget in 2022, surpassing other nations of the European Union (EU) in relative terms. By November 2022, Estonia’s humanitarian aid to Ukraine had reached €23.1 million, with €4.1 million coming from the public sector. Humanitarian organizations and volunteers played a crucial role, helping raise millions of euros to aid Ukrainians and their armed forces in the conflict areas as well as war refugees in Estonia, thereby demonstrating the remarkable capability, efficiency, and strength of Estonia’s civil society.\n\nMoreover, the country emerged as a staunch advocate for Ukraine in the West, pushing for more military assistance to Ukraine and stringent sanctions against Russia. Estonia was the first country to officially recognize Russia’s actions in Ukraine as genocide, designate the Russian Federation as a terrorist regime, and urge other countries to follow suit. The Riigikogu, Estonia’s unicameral parliament, was the first in NATO to call for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a total trade embargo against Russia and Belarus, and the closure of all ports and airports to Russian ships and planes. Despite dissensus within the EU, Estonia—together with Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland—closed its borders to Russian tourists with Schengen visas for security but also moral and political reasons. Estonia’s major universities restricted admission of Russian and Belarusian students. Overall, the country emerged as a leading voice on security matters, garnering increased attention and influence with Western allies. The efforts of Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and Estonia’s diplomatic corps had a significant influence on the Western response to Russia’s military actions.\n\nDespite not facing an immediate military threat, Estonia encountered several challenges at home. The war in Ukraine significantly reduced Russian forces near the Estonian border, but simulated Russian missile attacks against Estonia served as political provocations. Additionally, Kremlin-led cyberattacks on state institutions and private companies occurred on a nearly weekly, if not daily, basis. Some of these resulted in short-term service interruptions, yet Estonia had already developed strong cyber defenses since falling victim to a 22-day spate of cyberattacks in 2007. The changed security situation in the region prompted the government to invest significantly in defense capabilities, with defense expenditures projected to reach 2.85 percent of GDP in 2023 and exceed the 3-percent mark for the first time in 2024, surpassing NATO’s membership requirement of 2 percent. Energy shortages resulting from the invasion of Ukraine highlighted the importance of pursuing energy independence and expanding renewable energy resources more widely. To address this, Estonia made large-scale investments in national and energy security, which contributed to a state budget deficit to be covered by the issue of international bonds. Staggering energy costs and inflation rates—among the highest in Europe —slowed consumption and dragged the country’s economy into recession. While Estonians generally support tightening belts for the sake of freedom, striking a balance between security and maintaining living standards remained the government’s most pressing challenge.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine revived Estonia’s long-standing ethnic divisions, which are increasingly seen as both cultural and security concerns. With 23.67 percent of the population being ethnic Russians and 6.1 percent being Russian citizens, Estonia has one of the largest Russian diasporas in the world. When the war broke out, the number of Estonian passport applications more than doubled among Russian citizens residing in Estonia. However, divisions exist not only between but also within ethnic groups. Within the first year of the invasion, a quarter of Russian speakers considered Russia’s aggression in Ukraine justified, and more than a third oppose accepting war refugees from Ukraine. The government introduced various initiatives to address integration shortcomings, including transitioning the remaining Russian-language kindergartens and schools to Estonian-language education starting in 2024. Extensive subsidies are provided to support this plan, including financial incentives for teachers to relocate to the eastern region of Ida-Viru. At the same time, the government’s decision to take Russian TV channels off the air in Estonia and the removal of divisive Soviet-era war memorials, such as the tank monument in Narva, have caused frustration among local Russian speakers. The removal of the Narva tank monument was due to changes in Estonia’s criminal law, which now prohibits the public exhibition of symbols glorifying the Russian military or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Estonia has made efforts to provide Russian-language media content, but the war adds an entirely new context to these attempts. This has led many to rely on social media platforms as their main source of information. Tensions among Estonia’s ethnic minorities are also exacerbated by their lower socioeconomic status, making them vulnerable to cost-of-living and energy crises.\n\nIn terms of democratic development, the year brought few changes. Estonia maintained its democratic national governance, but the rise of populist political forces with illiberal views is a shared trend in the region. The year 2022 marked a brief pause in Estonia’s electoral politics, with local municipal council elections and presidential elections held in 2021, and parliamentary elections scheduled for March 5, 2023. The main competition leading up to the 2023 general elections is between the Reform Party and EKRE, with one of them likely to form the next governing coalition. The fragile security situation has bolstered Reform’s position, while EKRE has benefitted from the country’s economic challenges. The liberal Eesti 200 party also gained momentum and was expected to enter the parliament for the first time in 2023. Center, Social Democrats, and Isamaa are also expected to acquire seats, while Parempoolsed (the Right), a recent split-off from Isamaa, and the Greens are unlikely to gain representation.\n\nElections in Estonia are free and fair, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raised concerns regarding minority voting rights. Non-EU citizens residing in Estonia may vote in local government council elections, although their turnout is typically modest. However, the possibility remains for citizens from an aggressor state to influence local-level democracy and even the election of the president in the event that parliamentary voting fails and passes to a local electoral college, which raises security concerns. Disagreement within the governing coalition regarding the revocation of voting rights for third-country citizens put the initiative on hold, but it is likely to be revisited before the next local elections in 2025. Estonian-language proficiency requirements for candidates is also likely to come up in the next local elections, given that local council sessions in the country’s eastern regions are regularly and systematically conducted in Russian.\n\nPolitical corruption remains a challenge at the local level in Estonia. Despite past efforts to prevent and fight corruption, the political culture is slow to change. In 2022, several cases of bribery, mostly related to service contracts and procurements, were exposed involving numerous local politicians. Meanwhile, court hearings began in an influence-peddling case that led to the downfall of the Center Party–led national government in 2021. Additionally, first decisions were made in the high-profile money-laundering case in the banking industry that shook the Estonian and Scandinavian financial sectors several years ago and severely damaged their reputation."
