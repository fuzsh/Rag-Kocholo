        "meta_description": "Several recent studies detected fine-scale genetic structure in human populations. Hence, groups conventionally treated as single populations harbour significant variation in terms of allele frequencies and patterns of haplotype sharing. It has been shown that these findings should be considered when performing studies of genetic associations and natural selection, especially when dealing with polygenic phenotypes. However, there is little understanding of the practical effects of such genetic structure on demography reconstructions and selection scans when focusing on recent population history. Here we tested the impact of population structure on such inferences using high-coverage (~30×) genome sequences of 2305 Estonians. We show that different regions of Estonia differ in both effective population size dynamics and signatures of natural selection. By analyzing identity-by-descent segments we also reveal that some Estonian regions exhibit evidence of a bottleneck 10–15 generations ago reflecting sequential episodes of wars, plague and famine, although this signal is virtually undetected when treating Estonia as a single population. Besides that, we provide a framework for relating effective population size estimated from genetic data to actual census size and validate it on the Estonian population. This approach may be widely used both to cross-check estimates based on historical sources as well as to get insight into times and/or regions with no other information available. Our results suggest that the history of human populations within the last few millennia can be highly region specific and cannot be properly studied without taking local genetic structure into account.",

        "text": "All the analyses performed so far speak for South-East Estonia showing relatively strong genetic differentiation from the rest of the country and having a partially independent demographic history. So we went on to look into signals of recent action of natural selection with a specific focus on whether treating South-East Estonia independently can reveal any additional insights. In order to do so we applied SDS [20] to the entire dataset of 2305 samples as well as to two genetically defined subsets, South-East Estonia (SE, consisting of 1029 samples belonging to clusters eSE_1–eSE_5 in Fig. 4a) and the remaining 1276 samples from the rest of the country (nonSE) (“Methods”, Supplementary text 5.1).\n\nFirst, we inspected the genome-wide distribution of SDS p values in the three datasets (Fig. 5) for any evidence of recent selection acting at individual loci. Unlike other studies that used SDS [20, 24] we do not observe any hits with p values below 5 × 10–8. We attribute this lack of genome-wide hits to a shorter time window within which we can detect selection in our dataset as indicated by lower average number of singletons, lower recent Ne and higher correlation between our SDS results and the difference in derived allele frequency (DAF) between Estonian and the UK dataset compared to the study by Field et al. (see Supplementary text 5.3). This property of our dataset reduces our power to detect selection but it also allows us to get a sense of remarkably recent selective processes. Despite not detecting any genome-wide significant hits we observe 33 SNPs in 10 genomic loci with a p values below 1 × 10−5 (Table S5.1). Out of these loci the ones on chromosomes 4 and 9 are the most promising targets of recent population-specific selection as besides low SDS p values they are characterized by DAF out of the range between the Finnish and the British datasets (Table S5.1) and evidence of being associated with expression levels of nearby genes (Table S5.2).\n\nWhen we compare results for SE and nonSE we see weak correlation between standardized SDS (sSDS) values in the two subsets (Fig. S5.3e) with most of the SNPs having sSDS scores close to 0 which is the neutral expectation. However, there are 61 SNPs in 34 genomic regions with p values below 1 × 10−5 in 1 of the 2 subsets but not in the other (Table S5.1). Though many of those SNPs may be false positives there are five genomic regions that might represent genuine hits specific to one of the Estonian regions as the corresponding SNPs are characterized not only by low p values but also by FST between SE and nonSE above 0.011 which is the 99.9 percentile of the genome-wide FST distribution (Table S5.1). One of these regions lies within an intron of in the GRM1 gene and includes SNPs rs75386033 and rs79907158 which have a p value below 1 × 10−8 in SE (see Supplementary text 5.4). While those SNPs are not eQTLs themselves they lie in a region which is enriched in SNPs associated with expression levels of the EPM2A gene (Fig. S5.4, Supplementary text 5.4). This gene is associated with Lafora disease which is a form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy [25,26,27]. Another SNP from this list, rs7114857, lies within the GRM5 gene which has been shown previously to be a potential target of natural selection for the pigmentation phenotype [28]. See Supplementary text 5.4 for details.\n\nNext, we looked for possible signals of polygenic selection both in the entire dataset as well as in SE and nonSE by (1) focusing on SNPs and testing if any GWAS category was enriched in SNPs with high absolute sSDS scores and if there was any correlation between the absolute sSDS and absolute GWAS betas (see Supplementary text 5.2 for details); (2) focusing on genes we used EnrichR [29, 30] to see if any functional annotation category was enriched in genes that harbour SNPs with absolute sSDS scores [31] above 2.5 and Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) [31] PHRED scores above 10. Using the first approach and correcting for linkage between SNPs resulted in a number of categories being enriched in high absolute sSDS scores and/or showing correlation between sSDS values and betas (Supplementary text 5.3 and 5.4). Such categories largely overlap between the entire dataset and the nonSE subset and are related to lung or autoimmune diseases. However, all those results lost statistical significance at FDR equal to 0.05 when removing SNPs falling into the HLA locus (Tables S5.4, S5.5 and S5.6). While the results in the nonSE subset mostly replicate those obtained on the entire dataset the SE subset does not show most of the signals detected in the entire dataset but shows a correlation between sSDS and betas for the “Bone mineral density category” category which has an FDR corrected p value of 0.0505 even after removing linked SNPs and those in the HLA locus thus indicating a suggestive instance of polygenic selection specific to South-East Estonia. On the other hand, gene enrichment results show broadly the same results in all the datasets.\n\nTo conclude, here we show evidence of potential very recent and geographically localized selection providing an important case for our understanding of ongoing natural selection in humans.\n\nData reporting\n\nNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\n\nWhole genome sequencing data\n\nWe used whole genome sequences of 2535 Estonian Biobank participants reported in Kals et al. [10]. Detailed information about the dataset and the way the samples were sequenced and filtered can be found in the corresponding publication while a brief description is provided in the Supplementary text 1.1. In addition to sample filtering applied by Kals et al. [10], we removed seven samples with missing call over 3% as well as relatives up to third degree. This resulted in a dataset consisting of 2305 individuals that was used for all downstream analyses. For all manipulations with vcf files bcftools-1.8 [32] was used unless specified otherwise while PLINK-1.9 [33] and KING-2.1.6 [34] was used to estimate relatedness.\n\nFor analyses that require phased and/or imputed data (CP, SDS) phasing and imputation was done using Eagle v2.3 [35] on the dataset consisting of 2420 samples to benefit from the presence of related individuals and subsequently relevant samples were extracted.\n\nAll Estonian Biobank participants have signed a broad informed consent which allows research in the fields of genetic epidemiology, disease risk factors and population history. All work at Estonian Biobank is conducted according to the Estonian Human Gene Research Act. The original study generating the WGS data [10] was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu (application number 234/T-12).\n\nThe “Rural above 50 years old” (R50+) panel\n\nAs information on parents’ and grandparents’ birthplace is mostly unavailable for the samples used here, we subset the 2305 dataset for individuals born in rural areas and sampled at the age of 50 or older as we expect this cohort to be the least affected by recent migration. This resulted in a dataset of 474 individuals which we further pruned for PCA outliers (see below) and samples with more than 10,000 singletons (Supplementary text 1.1–1.3). We ended up with a panel of 468 individuals, which we call “R50+”.\n\nNon-Estonian samples\n\nTo place the Estonian population genetic variation in Eurasian context we compiled two datasets, one for PCA and one for CP/FS/GT, containing the R50+ Estonian samples each and samples from various populations predominantly representing West Eurasia. The datasets are described in Tables S1.2 and S3.1. These datasets include both sequenced and genotyped samples so only overlapping positions (around 450K SNPs in both cases) are used in corresponding analyses.\n\nPrincipal component analysis\n\nWe ran PCA for the entire Estonian dataset in two settings: with only the 2305 Estonians and combining the 2305 Estonians with 521 non-Estonian samples from 18 European populations (Table S1.2). In both cases smartPCA from EIGENSOFT-7.2.0 [36] was used. See Supplementary text 1.2 for details.\n\nCHROMOPAINTER/fineSTRUCTURE/GLOBETROTTER\n\nTo study genetic similarities between Estonians and other European populations we used the CP/FS pipeline [18]. Initial chromosome painting parameters were estimated using 30% of the phased dataset of 1068 Estonian and non-Estonian samples (Table S3.1). FS was run for 15 million MCMC iterations in two parallel runs to assess convergence. The tree-building step was performed using the approach from Leslie et al. [1] and the run with the highest observed posterior likelihood was used to cluster the samples into genetic groups. Inferred FS groups were further manually inspected and clustered into the higher-order FS populations (Supplementary text 3.1). These FS groups were used as surrogate populations to infer admixture with GT and estimate ancestry profile with NNLS.\n\nNext, GT [18] was used to detect signals and dates of admixture for the Estonian groups defined using the approach described above. GT inference was performed using a “regional” approach [18, 37].\n\nFinally, we used NNLS [1] to assign relative ancestral proportions to each individual in the R50+ panel using the non-Estonian surrogate groups identified by FS as sources. NNLS values for CP/FS Estonian groups were extracted from GT output while for individual samples these were calculated with an in-house R script. Obtained results were then summarized across Estonian parishes as well as across IBD/FS clusters.\n\nDetecting segments identical-by-descent (IBD segments)\n\nTo detect IBD segments in the Estonian dataset we applied IBDseq version r1206 [13] with default settings to the non-phased non-imputed dataset consisting of 2305 Estonians. As IBDseq software reports only physical coordinates of a segment’s start and end we interpolated segments’ genetic length in cM using GRCh37 recombination map using R [38]. When working with the R50+ panel corresponding IBD segments were retrieved from the general output obtained on the 2305 dataset. Homozygosity-by-descent segments were also inferred with IBDseq.\n\nIBD segments between Estonians and non-Estonian individuals were detected by applying refined IBD version 12Jul18.a0b [39] with default parameters except for length = 1.0 to the same dataset that was used for CP/FS/GT, as in this case the dataset is highly structured. This was followed by applying the merge-ibd utility version 12Jul18.a0b to merge together segments separated by at most 1 cM long gaps and no more than two positions with genotypes discordant with IBD.\n\nBoth for IBDseq and refined IBD/ibd-merge results segments shorter than 2 cM were discarded, as longer segments are detected with higher reliability.\n\nMAPS\n\nIn order to evaluate the extent of gene flow across the whole country together with local population densities, we estimated migration surfaces using MAPS [16], which harnesses a matrix summarizing the total number of IBD segments shared in a given population. In doing so, we used the IBD segments shared among pairs of individuals inferred with IBDseq as described in the previous section. Subsequently we have classified the shared genetic fragments as “short” (between 2 and 6 cM) and “long” (more than 6 cM), and performed two independent MAPS runs for each length class to assess convergence. Estonian territory was modelled as having a total of 200 demes. Each run had 5 million iterations thinned every 10,000 and preceded by a burn-in of 2 million discarded cycles. The obtained migration surfaces were subsequently plotted using the plotmaps R package [16]. We repeated the whole procedure after removing samples belonging to clusters from Fig. 2 with mean sharing above 60 cM to assess their effect on MAPS results.\n\nIBD-based fineSTRUCTURE (IBD/FS)\n\nWe used total genetic length of IBD segments longer than 2 cM as a measure of genetic similarity between pairs of individuals as described in Supplementary text 1.2 and 2.2. When running FS for both R50+ and the entire dataset the first 2,000,000 MCMC iterations were removed as burn-in and subsequently MCMC was run for additional 2,000,000 MCMC iterations sampling every 10,000th run. When building the tree we used the approach described in Leslie et al. [1].\n\nWe applied this approach to the R50+ dataset (468 samples) and the entire dataset (2305 samples). In both cases FS was run twice to assess convergence (Supplementary text 2.3, Tables S2.1 and S2.2). Dataset to reduce the number of clusters revealed by the FS algorithm we have hierarchically joined together clusters with short terminal branches by cutting the tree at such a level so as to avoid having clusters consisting of less than 5 samples in the case of the R50+ and 50 in the case of the entire dataset.\n\nFst calculations\n\nFst between Estonian clusters was calculated using smartpca from the EIGENSOFT package v7.2.0 [36] after LD-pruning (r2 > 0.4, windows of 1000 SNPs) and removing sites with MAF < 0.05 and missing rate > 0.1. Per-site Weir and Cockerham [40] Fst estimator between SE and nonSE subsets was calculated using vcfttools [41] after filtering sites for LD, MAF and missing rate the same way as described above.\n\nGeographic data visualization\n\nGeographic coordinates of the corresponding birth town/parish were assigned to each sample with birthplace information available (2168 out of 2305 samples). For MAPS these coordinates were used directly. When plotting IBD/FS and NNLS results for the R50+ panel, coordinates of the samples were changed manually to avoid overplotting. When plotting samples from the entire dataset jittering were used for the same purpose. Shp objects used to plot maps of Estonia with parish and county borders were retrieved from the Estonian Land Board website (administrative and settlement units, 2018.11.01, https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Spatial-Data/Administrative-and-Settlement-Division-p312.html). Geographic data were visualized in R [38] with the aid of the following packages: sp [42, 43], sf [44], rgdal [45], rgeos [46] and ggplot2 [47].\n\nIBDNe\n\nIn order to reconstruct recent Ne dynamics we used IBDNe version 07May18.6a4 [15] with default settings. IBD segments used as input for IBDNe were detected with IBDseq [13].\n\nTo get independent evidence of regional differences in Ne dynamics we applied IBDNe to samples from the People of the British Isles [1] dataset grouped by the region of origin of individuals’ grandparents. The following regions were used: Scotland, Wales and North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West England. For the list of counties comprising these regions see Table S4.1.\n\nGenetic simulations\n\nTo simulate genetic data under various demographic scenarios to test the behaviour of IBDNe we used mspms which is an ms-compatible version of msprime [48]. Commands used for simulation are provided in the Supplementary text section 4.1.\n\nEstimating actual census size based on Ne\n\nSeveral lines of evidence, based both on theoretical reasoning [49] and empirical comparisons [15] suggest that in industrial human societies census size (Nc) is roughly threefold the Ne assuming a panmictic and isolated population. To obtain a more universal conversion method we adapted the approach from [22] which incorporates inbreeding coefficient (Fis), relative fraction of males (m) and excess in variance of reproductive success compared to the Poisson distribution (DV):\n\n$$N_{b(t)} = \\frac{{(1 + {\\mathrm{Fis}})}}{4} \\times (\\frac{1}{{(1 - m) \\times m}} + {\\mathrm{DV}}) \\times N_{e(t)}.$$\n\n(1)\n\nIn order to apply this formula to human populations we explored the possible range of the corresponding parameters to obtain the minimal and maximal values of the conversion coefficient: 0.75 (with m = 0.5 and DV = −1) and 3.53 (with m = 0.1 or 0.9 and DV = 3), respectively (see Supplementary text section 4.4). To provide a single point estimate of Nc we rewrite formula (1) as:\n\n$$N_{b(t)} = 1.63 \\times N_{e(t)},$$\n\n(2)\n\nusing a geometric mean between 0.75 and 3.5 and thus making our estimate slightly more than twofold away from the provided range boundaries. Note, that although there are indications that in some human populations DV can be higher than 3 [50], such cases can be considered to be at the very extreme of human reproductive behaviour spectrum as even hypothetical “super-male” populations would have a sex-average DV of 1.8 given m equals to 0.5 [51].\n\nThe value estimated using (2) corresponds to the number of individuals in reproductive age. It can be converted into total census size (Nc) of a human population at a given time point by dividing it by the estimated fraction of breeding individuals, which we here assume to be roughly 0.33 (Supplementary text section 4.4). Incorporating this idea into (2) results in equation (3):\n\n$$N_{c(t)} = 4.89 \\times N_{e(t)},$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhich we used to obtain the curve in Fig. 4D. Sources of historical estimates of Estonian population size used in that figure are provided in Fig. S4.10.\n\nSingleton density score (SDS) selection scan\n\nSDS [20] analysis was applied to three datasets separately, namely, the entire dataset and it was two subsets, Estonia SE and Estonia nonSE. The latter two were defined based on the IBD/FS results (Fig. 4a): SE (individuals with South-East Estonian ancestry belonging to clusters eSE_1–eSE_5) and nonSE (individuals coming from the other parts of the country and belonging to other clusters). Data processing as well as the way SDS was run follow the guidelines of the authors of the original study [20] and are described in Supplementary text section 5.1.\n\nPredicted functional effect of the test SNPs was assessed using CADD tool [31]. In addition, two alternative enrichment tests were performed to see whether candidate SNPs are enriched in a certain category of genes [29, 30] or in certain GWAS catalogue categories (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/home; [52]). Candidate SNPs were also checked for known e-QTL effects using the eQTLGen Consortium [53] (http://www.eqtlgen.org/) database. Details of SNP annotation and enrichment analyses are specified in Supplementary text section 5.2."
