        "text": "Situated between Eastern and Western Europe on the map, Estonia is also a border zone, or more accurately a crossing point, in terms of culture. In the traditions of these parts, one can find elements originating from the East as well as the West, but the Estonians mostly consider themselves a Northern people and conceptually bound to Scandinavia. Marginal and border cultures are where one can find the most interesting phenomena and combinations. In this regard, Estonia is a country of dozens of possibilities.\n\nInteresting facts about Estonian culture:\n\nEstonian language belongs to the Finno-Ugric language family, which also includes Finnish and Hungarian.\n\nErnest Hemingway has written that in every port in the world, at least one Estonian can be found. (This speaks volumes about the nation's enterprising spirit.)\n\nDespite its small population there are about one hundred different nationalities and ethnic groups represented in Estonia.\n\nEstonian Song Festivals have been held every five years for the past 130 years. The joint choir of the General Song Festival has the biggest number of singers in the world.\n\nEstonians have one of the biggest collections of folk songs in the world, with written records of 133,000 folk songs.\n\nTallinn 2011 – for a year the Estonian capital city held the title of European Capital of Culture.\n\nThe first daily newspaper was published in Tallinn as early as in 1675 (in England – 1702).\n\nEstonia is egalitarian – 51% of engineers and scientists are women (European Union average being 29%).\n\nThe Estonian sense of humour is dark and very self-ironic reminiscent of English and Finnish humour. You can clearly see that in Estonian absurd-prone animations.\n\nThere were many literate people in Estonia already in the 1850s – approximately 80% of the population. This figure exceeded almost all of the grand European civilised nations, the only equal ones being French and German.\n\nCalendar of cultural events"
