The sun is out, and the temps are turning up.\n\nWe have tips and resources you need to:\n\nPrevent sunburn.\n\nStay hydrated.\n\nAvoid heat-related illness.\n\nManage medication in hot weather.\n\nProtect yourself from ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\nStay cool during the hot weather! Read our tips below and find more resources online.\n\nSun safe\n\nProtecting your skin from the sun’s rays is not just about avoiding a painful sunburn—it’s important for skin health.\n\nApply broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Reapply every 2 hours, or more often if sweating or swimming.\n\nApply extra during peak sun hours when the sun’s rays are strongest.\n\nLimit direct exposure to the sun, especially during peak UV hours.\n\nCover up with clothing, hats, and sunglasses.\n\nChoose clothing with ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) ratings of 30 or higher. UPF ratings show how much UV radiation a fabric blocks.\n\nWatch your skin for changes, including new moles or spots, and consult a dermatologist if you notice anything suspicious.\n\nBeat the heat\n\nWhen temperatures rise, your body may have a hard time cooling down.\n\nLook for symptoms of heat exhaustion—heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness and heat stroke —high body temperature, confusion, nausea.\n\nTake breaks in cooler areas during the hottest parts of the day.\n\nHeatwave hydration\n\nDehydration can sneak up on you quickly, leading to health complications.\n\nDrink plenty of water throughout the day, even if you don’t feel thirsty.\n\nReload electrolytes lost through sweating with sports drinks or coconut water.\n\nLimit alcohol and caffeine.\n\nHow heat affects your prescription medications\n\nIt’s important to consider how heat can impact not only our bodies but also the medications you rely on, including those for mental health. Heat can affect their stability and effectiveness.\n\nStore medications in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.\n\nYour healthcare provider can offer guidance on storage and usage during hot weather.\n\nBe ready for the heat\n\nSpending time outdoors during hot weather can be enjoyable, but it’s important to take precautions to protect yourself from the sun and heat-related risks.\n\nStay informed about the forecast, temperature, and UV index.\n\nSchedule outdoor activities during cooler times.\n\nListen to your body and take breaks.\n\nHeatwave power outage\n\nPower outages during a heatwave can pose serious health risks, especially when air conditioning and other cooling systems are unavailable. If your power goes out:\n\nMove to a cooler location, if possible.\n\nUse damp cloths or towels to help lower your body temperature.\n\nAvoid activities to reduce body heat.\n\nDuring the hottest part of the day, keep windows and doors closed.\n\nStay informed about the outage.\n\nKeep food safe.\n\nHot weather safety for older folks\n\nOlder adults are more vulnerable to heat-related illnesses.\n\nSpend time in cooler spaces.\n\nChoose loose-fitting, light-colored clothing.\n\nSchedule outdoor activities during cooler times.\n\nResources"
