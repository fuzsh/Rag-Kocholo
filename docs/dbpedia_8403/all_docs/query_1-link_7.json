        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nAfter centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries - it regained its freedom in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with the West. It joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004, formally joined the OECD in late 2010, and adopted the euro as its official currency on 1 January 2011.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nEastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland, between Latvia and Russia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n59 00 N, 26 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nEurope\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 45,228 sq km\n\nland: 42,388 sq km\n\nwater: 2,840 sq km\n\nnote: includes 1,520 islands in the Baltic Sea\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 132\n\nArea - comparative\n\nabout twice the size of New Jersey\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 657 km\n\nborder countries (2): Latvia 333 km;

Estonia's successive governments have pursued a free market, pro-business economic agenda, and sound fiscal policies that have resulted in balanced budgets and the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU.\n\nÂ\n\nThe economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, Germany, and Russia. The economyâs 4.9% GDP growth in 2017 was the fastest in the past six years, leaving the Estonian economy in its best position since the financial crisis 10 years ago. For the first time in many years, labor productivity increased faster than labor costs in 2017. Inflation also rose in 2017 to 3.5% alongside increased global prices for food and energy, which make up a large share of Estoniaâs consumption.\n\nÂ\n\nEstonia is challenged by a shortage of labor, both skilled and unskilled, although the government has amended its immigration law to allow easier hiring of highly qualified foreign workers, and wage growth that outpaces productivity gains. The government is also pursuing efforts to boost productivity growth with a focus on innovations that emphasize technology start-ups and e-commerce.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$47.44 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$48.87 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$46.54 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 112\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n5% (2019 est.)\n\n4.36% (2018 est.)\n\n5.51% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 48\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$35,600 (2020 est.)\n\n$36,800 (2019 est.)\n\n$35,200 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 54\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$31.461 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n2.2% (2019 est.)\n\n3.4% (2018 est.)\n\n3.4% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 118\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: AA- (2018)\n\nMoody's rating: A1 (2002)\n\nStandard & Poors rating: AA- (2011)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
