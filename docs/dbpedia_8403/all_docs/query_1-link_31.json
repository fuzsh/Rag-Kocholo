        "text": "The Setus are an ethnic group, small in numbers, in the southeastern part of the Republic of Estonia and the Russian territories bordering on Estonia (Petseri raion of the Pskov oblast). The Setus can be seen as ethnographic raw material that both Estonian and Russian nationalists have attempted to claim. Generally, the Setus has been viewed as an ethnographic subgroup of Estonians and their language as part of the South Estonian dialect. Unlike the Estonians, who are predominantly Lutheran by tradition, the Setus are Orthodox. The specific characteristics of the Setus have emerged as a result of the combined influence of religious and linguistic peculiarities and a historic fate that is different from the Estonian. Because of the fact that they were considered Estonians when the censuses took place, the exact number of the Setus is unknown; however, I estimate the number of the Setus living in Setumaa and in Estonian towns to be about 5,000–6,000.\n\n2. The central terms used in this paper have to be defined. For “ethnic group” I proceeded from Fredrik Barth's classic definition: “The term ethnic group is generally understood in anthropological literature to designate a population which: 1. is largely biologically self-perpetuating; 2. shares fundamental cultural values, realized in overt unity in cultural forms; 3. makes up a field of communication and interaction; 4. has a membership which identifies itself, and is identified by others, as constituting a category distinguishable from other categories of the same order.” Barth, “Introduction,” in Barth, ed., Ethnic Croups and Boundaries. The Social Organization of Culture Difference (Boston: Little, Brown, 1969), pp. 10–11. The concept “nation” is used according to the following definition: “A modern nation may be defined as a territorially-based community of human beings sharing a distinct variant of modern culture, bound together by a strong sentiment of unity and solidarity, marked by a clear historically-rooted consciousness of national identity, and possessing, or striving to possess, a genuine political self-government.” Konstantin Symmons-Symonolewicz, “The Concept of Nationhood: Toward a Theoretical Clarification,” Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism, Vol. 12, No. 2, 1985, p. 221. The main feature differentiating nation and ethnic group is that, unlike an ethnic group, a nation is in close relation to modern society, has a national written language and is characterized by a political dimension (striving for a nation state or at least for political autonomy). I employ the term “ethnic identity” to represent the feeling of solidarity or oneness with one's ethnic group, defining oneself as a member of a certain ethnic group. Ethnic identity forms as a result of both self-identification and ascription. Self-identification is in complex mutual relation with identification by others. See Georg Elwert, “Nationalismus und Ethnizität: Über die Bildung von Wir-Gruppen,” Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie, Vol. 41, No. 3, 1989, pp. 440–463. It seems that ascription has played a primary role in the development of the Setu ethnic identity.Google Scholar\n\n8. The term “Setu” occurs in literature for the first time in 1860 (in “Neuhausen und die Pleskauschen Esten,” Das Inland, No. 34, 1860, pp. 625–630). The etymology of this ethnonym is not clear. The most reliable hypothesis has been that of Estonian linguist Julius Mägiste. In his opinion, the ethnonym goes back to the fact that the Setu equivalent to the Estonian word see (it, this) is settu. Similar pejorative regional nicknames that are based on small differences in speech are known from South Estonia too, but have disappeared from use. See Julius Mägiste, “Setude nimetusest,” Tulimuld, No. 5, 1957, p. 248. 9. See for example Jakob Hurt, op. cit., p. v.Google Scholar\n\n10. Orvar Löfgren, “The Nationalization of the Culture,” Eihnologia Europaea, Vol. 19, 1989, pp. 10–11; Rein Taagepera, The Finno-Ugric Republics and the Russian State (London: Hurst, 1999), pp. 111–112. 11. See Juri Trusman, “Poluvertsy Pskovo-Pechorskogo kraia,” p. 48; Viktor Reier, “Mälestused Setumaalt,” Eesti Kirjandus, No. 5, 1922, p. 174. The pre-nationalism era offers many examples of ethnic identity being dominated by religious identity, and loyalty to the state connected with this. For example, Lutheran Finns considered themselves Swedes and Orthodox Karelians considered themselves Russians. See Taagepera, op. cit., p. 100. Catholicism was regarded as Polish and Orthodoxy as the Russian faith in Belarus. Accordingly, many Catholic Belarussians considered themselves Polish and the Orthodox considered themselves Russians. See Narody Evropeiskoi chasti SSSR, Vol. 1 (Moscow: Izdatel'stvo “Nauka,” 1964), p. 781. 12.

Latgale, too, had been separated from the rest of Latvia for centuries before it was united with the newly founded Latvian Republic after First World War. The Latgals were Catholic, unlike the Latvians, who were predominantly Lutheran. Infrastructure and social life in Latgale were underdeveloped compared with the rest of Latvia. The educational level of the local people remained below the Latvian average. But there are also differences between Latgale and Petseri regions. The area of Latgale is much bigger and the population of Latgals (350,000) greatly surpasses that of the Setus. There is also a difference in faith—Catholicism favored popular education more than Orthodoxy did, and literacy among the Latgals reached 47–51% at the end of Tsarist rule. Thanks to these circumstances there were enough educated Latgals who could stand up for Latgal interests. Thus, the Latgals, unlike the Setus, had an educated elite, and the Latgal dialect had a much stronger position in Latgale than the Setu dialect had in the Petseri region. The Latgal dialect was recognized as an official language in Latgale in 1921, and Latgal literature was published. The Catholic church was politically active, and politicians from Latgale took part in Latvian political life. Unlike Petseri county, Latgale had a distinct, though not dominating, separatist movement led by Francis Kemps, based on local religious, linguistic and cultural peculiarities. See S. Kuznetsov, “Latgale, ‘tretia zvezda,‘ ” in I. Sheiman and S. Kuznetsov, Nezavisimaia Latvia 1918–1940 (Riga: SI, 1996), pp. 170–187.Google Scholar\n\n28. The problems of mixed marriages have been studied by St Petersburg ethnographers (K. P. Ivanov, S. A. Khrushchev, A. G. Novozhilov) in the 1990s. Studying the materials of the registry office of the Petseri raion, they found that during 1945–1996 633 Setu marriages and 537 Setu–non-Setu (mostly Russian) marriages were registred in the raion (including the town of Petseri). Since the 1960s the Setus married mostly with Russians. The last child in the Petseri raion whose parents are both Setus was born in 1988. See M. L. Zasetskaya, A. G. Novozhilov, J. V. Gromova and S. A. Khrushchev, op. cit., p. 287.Google Scholar\n\n66. The project for the epic was written by a setuphile of Estonian origin, Paulopriit Voolaine. He sent it in 1927 to the famous Setu folk singer Anna Vabarna, who sang the epic according to Voolaine's plan. Vabarna herself was illiterate; therefore her son wrote down the text. Voolaine, who considered the Setus a separate Finno-Ugric people, probably thought that if the Finns have their Kalevala and Estonians have Kalevipoeg, the Setus too must have their own epic. The epic was printed much later in Kuopio, Finland, and is called a national epic on the title page. See Paul Hagu, “Saateks,” in Paul Hagu and Seppo Suhonen, eds, Setu rahvuseepos Peko. Laulnud Anne Vabarna (Kuopio: Snellmann-Instituutti, 1995), pp. 18, 22, 36.Google Scholar"
