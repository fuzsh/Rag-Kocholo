        "text": "Today's Estonia is a place where significant language mixing takes place. The language of the native Estonians and the Russians who went or were sent to the country during the World Wars have a huge effect on each other. This linguistic effect is rather dynamic and really interesting for investigation. In the 1940s, masses of people with Russian as their mother tongue emigrated or had to emigrate to Estonia, then a part of the Soviet Union. Today, almost one third of the country's population speaks Russian as their native tongue, and in the capital Tallinn, the ratio is almost 50-50. As a result of this, both Estonian and Russian are undergoing a rather noticeable linguistic change. This applies especially to the Russian language spoken in Estonia. The linguistic change is aided by external factors: even though there is a significant Russian population, the billboards and banners across the country are almost only in Estonian, just as the labels in the shops, and the so-called secondary texts also have a big impact—texts that were originally written in Estonian and then translated into Russian, and their language might still bear some characteristics typical to the Estonian grammar. The youngest generations are also heavily influenced by the Estonian schooling and getting immersed in the Estonian culture. The local Russian language is already richer with many loanwords from Estonian, usually applied to food, bureaucracy, offices and education. Apart from loanwords, there are other signs of linguistic interference, like the usage of calques and mixed structures. Interference aids convergence, where the speakers of a language start to use, while still using their own native words, the underlying grammatical-semantic structure of the dominant language. When native speakers of a language construct their sentence upon the grammatical patterns of another language, but their utterances seem monolingual, it is called morphosyntactic convergence. The code-switching is also very usual, which may happen because of a lexical hiatus, but oftentimes as a tool to achieve a pragmatic goal. The Russian native speakers of Russia say they notice a difference in the pronunciation of the Estonian Russians. This paper aims to show how the contact linguistics mechanisms work in today's Estonia, and bases its evidence on real-life investigations of spoken language and questionnaires. This essay aims to show the results of my research carried out during my stay in 2014 in Estonia, Tallinn.\n\nThe paper analyzes the language policy and its implementation in the North Caucasus in the modern period. The experience of the work of the state authorities and educational institutions in the language sphere is studied. It is noted that in Russia the problem of preserving the languages of the peoples of the country, including the peoples of the North Caucasus, became urgent after the native (national) languages were excluded from the federal educational standard. After some discontent, amendments were adopted to the articles of the law ‘On education in the Russian Federation’. Students in Russian schools were provided the opportunity to study Russian as a native language along with the possibility of receiving education in their native languages from among the languages of the peoples of the Russian Federation. The subjects of the Russian Federation have sufficiently developed laws and regulations that ensure the preservation and development of the languages of the peoples of the ...\n\nThis article presents some preliminary results from field-work (observatory participation, in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions) conducted mainly in Tallinn both with Estonians and Russophones, i.e. it represents work in progress, as this data is currently under review. However, before going into the presentation and analysis of these results, I will set up the framework that will let us have a more specific idea about how to read the results, and also, I will give a description of the methodological tools I used to obtain the available data. Finally, at the end of the article, I shall close with the most relevant conclusions we can arrive at, while at the same time giving some suggestions for further inquiry\n\nWe investigated language transmission in Russian-speaking families in multilingual settings in Cyprus, Estonia and Sweden. What they have in common is their Russian-language background and the minority status of their native language. In Cyprus and Sweden, participants mainly come from immigrant and mixed-marriage communities, while in Estonia they live in a bilingual society, where Estonian is a prestigious language and Russian has low status. To investigate the complex contexts of the informants' language choices, the language ecology theory was chosen as a theoretical framework. Particular attention was paid to similarities and differences in the three country groups under investigation. Written questionnaires and oral sociolinguistic interviews were used for data collection among Russian-speaking informants in the three countries. We asked whether Russian as the first language was transmitted to the second generation and why. The attitudes towards bilingualism and Russian language transmission (including the change of these attitudes over time) – depending on the parents' success in bringing up children bilingually – seemed to matter. Parental language choice is one of the main factors contributing to successful transmission. A lot depends on whether there was a desire for integration with the dominant language community, for staying isolated and only preserving the home language, or for having a balanced bilingual/multilingual approach and positive attitude towards both majority and minority languages. The socioeconomic status, level of education and mother's employment status played crucial roles in language transmission and attitudes. The linguistic repertoire of the father (minority, majority, or mixed) also had an effect."
