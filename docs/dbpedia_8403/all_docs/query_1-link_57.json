        "text": "INTRODUCTION.\n\nWith the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991[1] Soviet nationality ceased to exist. Since then, most former Soviet Republics have adopted their own nationality laws. However, many issues regarding the citizenship of former Soviet nationals must still be resolved. This paper shall provide an overview of nationality laws recently adopted in the independent Republics. It is intended to serve as a guideline for determining the nationality of persons originating from this subregion. In its first part the paper will address the problem of succession of nationality in general international law and identify the obligations of states deriving thereof.\n\nThe second part will survey the conditions and requirements for acquisition and loss of nationality for each of the former Soviet Union Republic. The purpose of this exercise is to determine whether such laws are in conformity with international human rights standard and whether they create situations which lead to statelessness.\n\nIn the present paper the terms nationality and citizenship are used as synonyms to define a political status[2] In the Soviet Union, however, citizenship and nationality were two different legal concepts. While the former reflected a political status, the Soviet doctrine used the term nationality in the ethnic sense to define the whole of the members appertaining to the same ethnic nation. The Soviet concept of nationality emerged in 1932 together with the introduction of the internal passports which included, among other data, the nationality of the holder (for example Russian, Tatar, Armenian etc).\n\nPART I: NATIONALITY AND STATE SUCCESSION.\n\n1. Nationality as a matter of reserved domain.\n\nIn 1923 in the Nationality Decrees in Tunis and Morocco the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) stated that\n\n\"in the present state of international law, questions of nationality are [...] in principle within [the] reserved domain\" of each state[3]As a matter of sovereignty, every state is free to determine its criteria of granting nationality as well as to establish the conditions of naturalization. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) confirmed in the Nottebohm Case that \"international law leaves it to each State to lay down the rules governing the grant of its own nationality\"[4] The same rule can be found in Art. 1 of the 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws.[5] 5Although a state is free in determining the rules for the acquisition of its nationality, it cannot claim that these rules be recognized by other states, unless they reflect a genuine connection between the individual and the state. This principle of genuine link has been expressed by the ICJ with regard to diplomatic protection as follows:\"...On the other hand, a state cannot claim that the rules it has thus laid down are entitled to recognition by another state unless it has acted in conformity with this general aim of making the legal bond of nationality accord with the individual's genuine connection with the state which assumes the defence of its citizens by means of protection as against other states.\"\n\nand:\n\n\"According to the practice of states, to arbitral and judicial decisions and to the opinions of writers, nationality is a legal bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties.\"[6]\n\nFirst recognized in the field of diplomatic protection, the principle of genuine link has been extended to other aspects of nationality. The provisions of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness are based on various criteria of factual connection of the individual with a state.[7] Art. 91 of the U. N. Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 requires the existence of a genuine link for the nationality of ships[8] It can be concluded that the principle of genuine link is becoming a general principle in nationality matters.\n\nFurther restrictions on state discretion in matters of nationality have been arguably based on the general principles of good faith and abuse of rights[9]\n\nFinally, some implication for the freedom of states may derive from international human rights law[10] Art. 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948, hereinafter UDHR) which, in its main parts, is generally accepted as an authoritative interpretation of the UN Charter, and consequently as part of international customary law, provides that:\n\n\"Everyone has the right to nationality. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality, nor denied the right to change his nationality.\"\n\nAlthough this provision sets out a general right to nationality[11], it does not specify which state, if any, has the relating obligation to grant nationality.\n\nHowever, in some circumstances, it is possible to identify such states. This is the case for children of unknown parents found on the territory of a state and children of stateless people born in the country of habitual residence of their parents. Given their right to a nationality based on Art. 15 UDHR and, for state parties, on Art. 24 para. 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights[12], and considered the fact that they have only a genuine link with one state, it could be deduced that the latter has an obligation to grant him/her its nationality. Such conclusion is also supported by the spirit of Art. 7 para. 2 of the Convention on the Right of the Child of 1989.[13]\n\nNevertheless, such restrictions only marginally affect the traditional freedom of states in nationality matters. Most issues regarding nationality are still under domestic jurisdiction.\n\n2. Obligations related to state succession.\n\nChanges of sovereignty over a territory generally affect the nationality of its inhabitants. Previous nationality ceases to exist in all cases in which the predecessor state dissolves. This has been the case after the collapse of the USSR.More problematic is the acquisition of the nationality of the successor state, since, like all matters of reserved domain, it depends from a positive act by the successor state. International law, however, cannot disregard the fact that habitual residents on the transferred territory are effectively attached to it. The population generally follows the territory. As stated by Brownlie, to accept this substantial connection with the territory \"is not to revert to forms of feudalism but to recognize a human and political reality, which underlies modern territorial settlements\"[14]\n\nSuccessor states have to respect this attachment. They may not acquire a territory and disregard completely the population living thereon. With regard to nationality, successor states would be in breach of international law if they treated the population as stateless[15] They have an obligation deriving from customary international law to grant their nationality to all habitual residents on the acquired territory, with the exclusion of nationals of third states. Such obligation is based on consistent state practice and on the existence of an opinio juris.\n\nSeveral authors go even further and suggest that the nationality of the successor state is automatically acquired by the inhabitants of such territories on the day of transfer of sovereignty.[16] They speak of \"collective naturalization\" to stress the fact that nationality is directly acquired by virtue of international law, without the need of a positive legislative act by the successor state. The same view has been expressed in the Harvard Draft on nationality drawn up in 1929, which was an attempt to codify pre-existing norms in matters of nationality.[17] For the case of partial succession, the existence of such a rule has also been set forth by a report of the Secretariat of the United Nations.[18]\n\nThe obligation to grant nationality to the inhabitants of the acquired territories excluding nationals of third states, which derives from general international law, is well reflected by state practice.[19] The normal effect of acquisition of territory by the United Kingdom and by the United States is that the nationals of the State whose territory is annexed, if resident thereon, become respectively British or U. S. nationals.[20] Soviet practice has been similar. Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian nationals, as well as persons resident in Bessarabia on 28 June 1940 were considered as Soviet nationals.[21]\n\nReference can also be made to various bilateral treaties which contained express provisions in this sense.[22] In 18th and 19th centuries conventions regarding the transfer of territorial sovereignty, people who had their domicile on the ceded territories were presumed to acquire the nationality of the successor state by virtue of law, unless otherwise provided for.[23]\n\nPeace treaties after World War I deserve particular attention, in as much as they contain an overall solution for the problem of nationality of former citizens of the dissolved Austro-Hungarian Empire. Interestingly, most questions related to the problem of succession of nationality and particularly the determination of the initial body of citizens, were expressly dealt with in the peace treaties. The initial body of citizens has been defined according to the existence of an effective link between individual and territory, which was expressed by the principle of domicile[24] or by the conception of indigénat[25] in case of Austria and Hungary. According to Art. 70 of the Treaty of St. Germain and to Art. 61 of the Treaty of Trianon, Austria and Hungary acknowledged that every person possessing rights of citizenship (indigénat) on former Austro-Hungarian territories would lose its old nationality and ipso facto acquire that of the state to which the territories were transferred.[26]\n\nIn order to form ethnically homogeneous states and to preserve the rights of minorities, a right of option was, however, granted to former Austro-Hungarian nationals that differed \"in race and language from the majority of the population\"[27] of the newly created state. Within a period of one year these individuals could opt for the nationality of the state of ethnic origin[28], provided they transferred their place of residence to that state within one year.[29]\n\nMoreover, the treaties of St. Germain (Art. 65) and of Trianon (Art. 57) contained an important provision aimed at reducing statelessness. All persons born in Austrian (Hungarian) territory who were not born nationals of another state ipso facto became citizens of Austria (Hungary).\n\nStates that issued from decolonization have mainly employed the criterion of residence on their territories in order to determine the original body of citizens. The nationality laws of Mali, Mauritania and Niger required only habitual residence on the day of entry into force of the respective nationality laws. More frequently, a pre-condition for the acquisition of nationality has been continuous residence on the ceded territories for some time before the day of entry into force of the nationality law. The required period varied from six months in the case of Indonesia to 10 years in the case of Libya.[30]\n\nIt can be concluded that successor states and in particular new states recognized their obligation to grant nationality to the population of the territory they have acquired with the exclusion of nationals of third countries. States have generally acted in conformity with it, thus allowing the formation of a rule of customary law.\n\nDomicile or (prolonged) habitual residence have been the criteria employed to define which part of the population had a right to the nationality of the new state. Looking at the historical evolution it seems that habitual residence, usually lasting for some time, has replaced domicile. Prolonged habitual residence should be preferred to domicile also in the light of the principle of genuine link.\n\n3. The definition of the initial body of citizens.\n\nAfter its formation, new states need to determine their initial body of citizens. Only then may they establish the principles, rules, and procedures regulating the acquisition of nationality.[31] For the definition of the initial citizenry Brubaker[32] distinguishes three different situations and, related to it, three different models. The most common case is the creation of a new state. The definition of the initial body of citizens is based on territorial terms even if a ius sanguinis approach will be adopted for the subsequent recruitment of citizens. Generally, the determination of the original citizenry is very inclusive. Usually, all habitual residents on the territory of the new state, excluding nationals of other states, obtain the new nationality.[33]\n\nThe second model is the restored-state model. It refers to states that knew independence before, lost it through foreign occupation and reacquire it. Technically, they are not new states. Statehood had been de facto suspended for the time of occupation. With regard to nationality, the citizen status is restored for citizens of the previous independent state and their descendants.[34] All other residents are to be considered as aliens. They may acquire citizenship through naturalization.\n\nBrubaker[35] finally refers to a compromise model that combines the previous two. In several cases the restored state may be very different from its \"ascendant\". Former nationals and their descendants may not be sufficient to form the initial body of citizens. They will form its core but other groups or individuals will have to be incorporated.\n\nThe distinction between new states and restored states is relevant because it has a considerable impact on the rules governing the determination of the initial citizenry. The obligation of successor states to grant their nationality to the inhabitants of the acquired territories outlined in chapter 3 applies only to the situation of state succession. Restored states regained independence after a period of occupation and are not to be considered as successors to the occupying power.\n\n4. Conclusions.\n\nIn case of state succession there is an exception to the traditional rule according to which states are free to determine the criteria of granting nationality. Customary international law requires from successor states to grant their nationality to all habitual residents of the acquired territory with the exclusion of nationals of third states. In addition, it has been argued that according to the principle of genuine link a state should grant its nationality to children of unknown parents found on its territory and to children of stateless people habitually resident on its territory, who are born thereon. The following part of this paper will examine whether the nationality laws adopted in the former Soviet Union Republics are in line with these conclusions.\n\nPART II: A SURVEY OF NATIONALITY LAWS IN FORMER USSR REPUBLICS.\n\nAfter the coup in August 1991 Belarus, Estonia, Georgia Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine passed new nationality laws. Four other former republics, namely Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Tadjikistan had already adopted new legislation on nationality shortly before that date[36]. These laws reflect different models. Most successor states were not previously independent states, but they are new states. Even if several of the former Soviet Republics previously existed as sovereign states in the chaotic periods of the Bolshevik revolution and civil war, only three, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, were able to consolidate their independence for a longer time.[37]All others, which include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine, enjoyed only brief interludes of independence before they were absorbed into the Soviet Union[38]This historical difference is of fundamental importance for the comprehension of the present Baltic nationality policy in defining their initial citizenry. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania define themselves not as successors to the USSR but to the inter-war republics[39]These countries view the time after 1940 until the reacquisition of independence as foreign occupation. Their statehood did not terminate in 1940 but subsisted de jure for the whole time of Soviet rule. Indeed several arguments militate in favor of this position. In the light of the Briand-Kellog pact and of the Stimson doctrine[40]40, it can be argued that annexation by force was contrary to international law already before the adoption of Art. 2, para. 4 of the United Nations Charter. Soviet occupation occurred in contrast to the principle of self-determination, which prevented any form of acquisitive prescription based on effectiveness. Finally, the fact that a considerable number of states, did not recognize the Soviet annexation cannot but corroborate the de jure existence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania throughout the five decades of Soviet rule[41]\n\nIn brief, in their nationality laws, Estonia has opted and Latvia is opting for the restored-state model. Lithuania and Moldova have followed a mixed system and have determined their initial body of citizens partly with reference to the situation prior to the Soviet annexation and partly to residence in the newly independent country. Other former USSR Republics have drafted their nationality laws adopting the new-state model and determined their initial citizenry on the basis of permanent or prolonged residence, or simply, residence on their territory on the day of entry into force of the nationality law. Azerbaijan, finally, chose quite an unusual way and based its initial citizenry on the situation previously existing in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan before it attained independence.\n\n1. Armenia.\n\nOn 23 August 1990 the Supreme Soviet of Armenia adopted a declaration of sovereignty. In a referendum held on 21 September 1991, 99.3 % voted in favor of an independent Armenia. Two days later the Supreme Council proclaimed Armenian independence[42]The population of Armenia is rather homogeneous. More then 93.3 % are ethnic Armenians, the rest being Kurds (1.7 %), Russians (1.5 %), Ukrainians and others.[43]\n\nArmenia is expected to adopt its nationality law by the end of 1993. A draft law, drawn up in Spring 1993 has been forwarded through UNHCR Liaison Office in Yerevan in July 1993.\n\n1.1. The definition of the initial body of citizens (according to the draft law).\n\nThe draft follows the new state model. The initial citizenry of Armenia is formed by all former Soviet nationals permanently residing on the territory of Armenia on the day of entry into force of the nationality law. However, the draft provides for the possibility to relinquish Armenian nationality within one month from the day of its entry into force by a simple declaration. Former Soviet nationals born in Armenia and residing outside the territory of the Republic who do not possess any nationality may be recognized as Armenian citizens. Therefore an application has to be submitted to the Armenian authorities. The draft does not define the competent authorities nor does it determine the procedure to follow. Similarly, stateless persons, permanently residing in Armenia may apply for recognition of Armenian nationality within one year from the day of entry into force of the law.\n\n1.2. Acquisition of nationality (according to the draft law).\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nArmenian nationality is acquired by birth according to the principle of jus sanguinis. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parents, children of an Armenian national and a foreigner acquire automatically Armenian nationality if born in Armenia or if they would otherwise remain stateless. Armenian nationality is also automatically acquired by birth if one parent is an Armenian national and the other stateless or unknown.\n\nChildren of stateless persons born in Armenia ipso facto acquire nationality by birth. There is no provision with regard to children of unknown parents found on the territory of Armenia.\n\n(2) Naturalization:\n\nPre-conditions for naturalization are 18 years of age, four years of permanent residence in Armenia prior to the submission of the application for naturalization, proficiency in Armenian language and knowledge of the Armenian Constitution.\n\nThe residence requirement is not necessary (a) for spouses of Armenian nationals as well as for persons who have a child or at least one parent who is an Armenian national and (b) for persons who have at least one parent who previously had Armenian nationality or was born in Armenia, provided they apply for naturalization within three years from becoming 18 years of age.\n\nApplications for naturalization can be rejected if the applicant (1) is engaged in anti-constitutional activities, (2) is a member of illegal organizations and (3) has been convicted and punished with imprisonment for a crime under Armenian laws.\n\n(3) Restoration:\n\nPersons who have lost Armenian nationality may restore it upon application. Restoration is effected by Presidential decree.\n\n1.3. Loss of Armenian nationality (according to the draft law).\n\nUpon application, Armenian nationality may be renounced, provided certain pre-conditions are fulfilled. Possession of another nationality is not required. Further, Armenian nationality is lost (1) by a naturalized Armenian residing abroad who, without justification, has not registered with the Armenian authorities for a period of seven years, (2) by persons who fraudulently acquired Armenian nationality, and (3) by persons who have acquired the nationality of a state with which Armenia does not have an agreement on dual nationality.\n\n1.4. Conclusions.\n\nThe rather inclusive definition of the initial citizenry contained in the draft is quite efficient in reducing statelessness within the Republic of Armenia. The right to relinquish Armenian nationality within one month, however, is source of concern, since it creates a situation where statelessness may occur.Ethnic Armenians residing outside Armenia and who do not possess any nationality, are eligible for recognition as Armenian nationals only if they are born in Armenia and if the file an application within one year from the entry into force of the nationality law. While such a provision allows those ethnic Armenians who have a close link to this country to return and be recognized as Armenian citizens on the basis of a simplified procedure, it effectively deters other ethnic Armenians, who were not born in the territory of Armenia to move massively to their homelands.\n\nStates are free to set up the criteria for naturalization. While language requirements are rather common, states usually limit themselves to require a basic knowledge of the national language(s) or a knowledge which is \"sufficient for communication\". In comparison, the \"proficiency\" in Armenian language required by the draft is rather strict.\n\n2. Azerbaijan.\n\nOn 23 September 1989 the former Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan issued a declaration of sovereignty, according to which republican laws have primacy over union laws[44]On 30 August 1991 Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence[45]On 26 June 1990, Azerbaijan passed a nationality law which entered into force on 1 January 1991[46]At 1 January 1991 the total estimated population of Azerbaijan was 7,137,000. Azerbaijanis form the largest group with 82.7 %, followed by Russians (5.6 %) and Armenians (5.6 %, mainly in Nagornyi Karabakh).\n\n2.1. The definition of the initial body of citizens.\n\nAzerbaijan's nationality law was passed during Soviet rule. Traditionally, Soviet law acknowledged two-layers of citizenship[47]Soviet citizens were at the same time citizens of one of the union republics. Art. 21 of the 1936 Constitution of the URSS and Art. 1 of the 1938 Soviet citizenship law as well as Art. 1 of the new Soviet citizenship law adopted in 1978 incorporate the idea that in the USSR there was a single union citizenship and that each citizen of a Union Republic was also citizen of the USSR[48]Although necessary for ideological reasons, Republican citizenship had little practical relevance[49]This explains why the Union Republics did not issue any laws or decrees establishing the criteria for acquisition and loss of their nationality[50]Scholars have concluded that in the absence of laws, it could be inferred from Soviet practice that permanent (or habitual) residence seemed to be the decisive criteria for acquiring the nationality of a Union Republic[51]However, since no formal provisions in this sense existed, other criteria are not excluded.The Azeri nationality law of 1990 does not break with the past. It is a continuation of the traditional two-layers pattern. Azeri nationals were, according to Art. 2, at the same time Soviet nationals.\n\nSince Azeri nationality existed already before the declaration of sovereignty in 1989, no need was felt to redefine the initial body of citizens, once achieved independence. Previous Azeri nationality was reconfirmed. Art. 4 reassures that all persons who had the citizenship of Azerbaijan SSR on the day of entry into force of the nationality law, have ipso facto the nationality of sovereign Azerbaijan. No issues of state succession seem to complicate the picture. The fictitious continuity of Soviet and sovereign Azerbaijan, in nationality matters, prevented the emergence of disputes and controversial views that usually occur in case of state succession.\n\nIn the absence of legal provisions regarding former Azerbaijan SSR nationality, it is difficult to determine who was and who was not an Azeri subject. Local agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs or, for residents abroad, the diplomatic representations of Azerbaijan, will decide on the issue. Decisions have to be taken on the basis of USSR legislation, the laws of (former) Azerbaijan SSR and international treaties ratified by the USSR and Azerbaijan SSR existing at the critical date (Art. 37). This leaves to the authorities a large margin of discretion, particularly with regard to those people who had a genuine link with another former Soviet Republic as well. For instance, in examining the cases of Armenians born in Armenia but living in Azerbaijan, the Azeri authorities may refer to the fact that such individuals were former citizens of the Armenian SSR and thus that they are not entitled to the nationality of Azerbaijan.\n\n2.2. Acquisition of nationality.\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nLike other former Soviet republics Azerbaijan adhered to the principle of ius sanguinis. According to Art. 12 a child whose both parents had the nationality of Azerbaijan \"shall have the citizenship of Azerbaijan regardless of whether the child was born on the territory of Azerbaijan SSR or not\". In case of parents of different nationality the child automatically acquires Azeri citizenship if (a) the child was born on Azeri territory or (b) was born outside the country but, at least one parent had permanent residence in Azerbaijan at the time of birth. Should this latter condition not be fulfilled, the child may acquire Azeri nationality on the basis of a written declaration of the parents (Art. 13).\n\nThe law introduces further ius soli corrections to the principle of ius sanguinis. Children of stateless persons permanently resident in Azerbaijan (Art. 14) and children of unknown parents born or found on the territory of Azerbaijan acquire Azeri nationality ipso facto. Both provisions contribute to reduce statelessness.\n\nFinally, children may acquire Azeri nationality through adoption. According to Art. 26 a non-Azeri child who has been adopted by citizens of Azerbaijan becomes automatically an Azeri citizen. If one of the adopting parents is an Azeri citizen and the other not, the child may acquire the Azeri nationality upon consent of the adopting parents. However, if the adoptive child is stateless, it acquires the nationality of Azerbaijan ipso facto[52]\n\n(2) Naturalization:\n\nThe Azeri nationality law does not lay down detailed conditions for naturalization. It limits itself to require from interested individuals to file an application (Art. 30, para. 1.a) and to pronounce an oath (Art. 46). An additional requirement has to be inferred from Art. 9 which prohibits dual nationality, except when allowed by a decision of the President of Azerbaijan. No residence requirements are mentioned. Reference is only made to circumstances that imply a rejection of the application. Art. 16, para. 2 states that an application shall be rejected if the applicant\n\n– calls for anti-constitutional changes of the state or social system of Azerbaijan;\n\n– calls for violation of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan;\n\n– is engaged in activities that are detrimental to state security, public order, health or moral character of the population;\n\n– propagates hatred, national or racial superiority;\n\n– is engaged in terrorist activities.\n\nMuch depends on the way these conditions for rejection are interpreted and applied, since they are formulated in general and vague terms. Particularly points three and four leave a large discretion to national officials dealing with applications for nationality. The reference to \"health and moral character\" on the one side and to \"propaganda of hatred and national superiority\" on the other, may easily lead to abuses.\n\nIt is unknown if decrees of application of the 1990 nationality law exist. Indeed, basing naturalization solely on the latter leads to quite unusual conclusions. Since no residence requirements are requested, formally the doors of Azeri nationality are as open for non-resident aliens, as they are for permanent residents. Requirements of genuine link[53]could, of course, be referred to by other subjects of international law that do not intend to recognize a nationality conferred in case of abuses.\n\n(3) Restoration of nationality:\n\nArts. 17 and 30 provide for an additional form of acquisition of nationality. Individuals who formerly had the citizenship of Azerbaijan may apply to have their Azeri nationality restored. However, the law does not provide for a special procedure and it is not clear if the conditions of rejection provided for the case of naturalization are applicable to restoration of Azeri citizenship. Since they are included in Art. 16, it can be inferred that they are only applicable to naturalization.\n\n2.3. Loss of nationality.\n\nRenunciation of Azeri nationality is allowed upon application. While it can be refused whenever this is contrary to the interests of Azerbaijan (Art. 19), acquisition of another nationality is not a pre-condition. A citizen is deprived of Azeri nationality (a) if he enters military service and if she/he enrolls in the public administration of a foreign state, without permission of Azerbaijan (b) if she/he is permanently residing abroad and, without reasons, fails to register at the consular representations for a period of five years, (c) in case she/he fraudulently acquired Azeri nationality (Art. 20). Azeri nationality is lost on the day of registration of one of these facts by the competent authorities.\n\nMoreover, according to Art. 21 persons \"who have committed actions that caused a significant damage to the state interests or state security of Azerbaijan\" may be punished with the deprivation of nationality.\n\nDeprivation of nationality as sanction is in contrast with Art. 1 of the Azeri nationality law which recognizes the right to nationality. It may also be viewed as a violation to Art. 15 of the UDHR. Similarly, point (b) is very strict. Five years are not sufficient to delete the existence of a genuine link. Concerned individuals will in most cases not be in a position to acquire another nationality and therefore this provision could easily lead to statelessness.\n\n2.4. Procedure for application.\n\nSection VI of the nationality law lays down the procedure for naturalization and restoration as well as renunciation of citizenship of Azerbaijan. Applications are addressed to the President of Azerbaijan[54]through local agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs or through diplomatic agencies, if the applicant resides abroad. Together with the official's conclusions, the applications are forwarded to the President of Azerbaijan. Additional conclusions on the case are required from the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Committee for State Security and even from the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan. The latter shall refer to the feasibility of admission to or restoration of Azeri nationality for each individual case (Art. 40). A Commission on Citizenship Matters set up under the Presidency of Azerbaijan examines the individual applications and submits its recommendations to the President. The President adopts his decision in form of a decree (Art. 42). In case of rejection or deprivation of nationality the motives of the decision are to be communicated to the applicant. The sole remedy the applicant can invoke is to ask the President to re-examine the case (Art. 48). Re-applications are not considered before the expiration of a one year period, unless new important information emerge (Art. 42 para. 3). Art. 43 indicates that the time for consideration of applications on nationality matters should not exceed six months. However, considered the complexity of the procedure this does not appear to be very realistic.\n\n2.5. Conclusions.\n\nThe nationality law of Azerbaijan is a mixed creation. It reflects, on the one hand, Western human rights ideology and acknowledges, in the light of Art. 15 UDHR, that in Azerbaijan \"every individual shall have the right to citizenship\" (Art. 1). On the other hand, it still contains elements of Soviet heritage, like the deprivation of nationality as a sanction (Art. 21).The new Azeri nationality law did not create a new citizenry, but confirmed the one previously existing in the Azerbaijan SSR. However, the law does not provide sufficient mechanisms to determine such previous citizenry. Azeri authorities have therefore considerable discretionary powers in determining who is part of the initial citizenry and who is not. Indeed, very much depends on the way the provisions of the nationality law are applied. Currently, a restrictive approach seems to prevail, which tend to exclude ethnic non-Azeri people that came to Azerbaijan from other former Soviet republics, regardless of the time they have been living in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is thus in breach of its obligation deriving from state succession, that imposes upon states the duty to confer their nationality to all habitual residents on its territory at the moment of acquisition of sovereignty.\n\nIf excluded from the original body of citizens, these groups of individuals need to apply for naturalization, regardless of the time they have been living in Azerbaijan. In several cases they will remain stateless for the time of the procedure, as well as if their applications are rejected.\n\nGiven the considerable lacunas of this law it is not excluded that the Azeri authorities will replace it with a new act in the near future.\n\n3. Belarus\n\nOn 27 July 1990 the Belorussian Supreme Soviet adopted a declaration of sovereignty and on 25 August 1991 the same body proclaimed the independence of Belarus and conferred constitutional status to the declaration of sovereignty adopted the year before[55]At the 1989 census 79.4 % of the population were ethnic Belorussians. The most important minority groups are Russians (11.9 %) and Poles (4.2 %)[56]On 18 October 1991, Belarus issued its nationality law, which entered into force on 1 December 1991[57]\n\n3.1. Definition of the initial body of citizens.\n\nBelarus adopted a pure new-state model. Pursuant to Art. 2, para. 1 of the Belorussian nationality law all individuals who had permanent residence in the territory of Belarus on the day of entry into force of the law are considered nationals of the Republic of Belarus[58]The inclusive territorial approach is very efficient in solving the problem of nationality for individuals permanently resident in Belarus. Belorussian nationality is only denied to people temporarily residing in the Republic.[59]\n\nThe initial Belorussian citizenry does not include ethnic Belorussians permanently resident in other countries. In principle, they may acquire nationality only upon the filing of an application according to Arts. 17 and 21 of the nationality law, which imply that the applicant has to go through an examination procedure.\n\n3.2. Acquisition of nationality.\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nJus sanguinis is applied in Belarus. According to Art. 9, children whose both parents are Belorussian nationals automatically acquire Belorussian nationality by birth. If only one of the parents is a Belorussian national, the child may automatically acquire the nationality of the Republic of Belarus, if born on Belorussian territory or, otherwise, if at the time of birth one of the parents had permanent residence in Belarus (Art. 10). If neither of the two conditions are present, the child may acquire Belorussian nationality, on the basis of a common written declaration submitted by the parents (Art. 10 para. 2).\n\nIn addition, Belorussian nationality is acquired by children of a Belorussian parent and a stateless or unknown person (Art. 10 last paragraph).\n\nThe principle of jus soli is applied to children of stateless persons (Art. 11) and of unknown parents (Art. 12). Nationality is acquired ipso facto.\n\nPursuant to Art. 26, para. 1, nationality is automatically acquired by foreign or stateless children adopted by Belorussian nationals.\n\n(2) Naturalization:\n\nAccording to Art. 13, four pre-conditions are required for the acquisition of Belorussian nationality. Applicants have to\n\n– accept the duty to respect the Belorussian Constitution and the laws;\n\n– know the state language[60]60;\n\n– be permanently resident in Belarus for the last seven years prior to the submission of the application;\n\n– have a legal source of income in Belorussia.\n\nIt may be inferred from Art. 34, para. 2 that the law does not require the applicant to renounce his or her previous nationality. A different interpretation can however not be excluded[61]\n\nThose conditions are applied also to foreign nationals that enter into marriage with a Belorussian national (Art. 14, para. 2).\n\nThe requirements for naturalization are in conformity with international standards. It may however be argued if it is reasonable to require knowledge of Belorussian language, since it appears that only a slim minority of the population use it regularly[62]\n\n(3) Restoration:[63]\n\nThe conditions for naturalization have to be met by all individuals with the following exception. The seven-years residence requirement is not required from persons and their offspring who had been permanent residents of Belarus but left or were forced to leave the country prior to the day of the entry into force of the nationality law (Art. 17, para. 1) and from ethnic Belorussians or from persons \"who identify themselves as Belorussians\"[64] including their children born outside of Belarus (Art. 17 para. 2).\n\nFor these categories of people, Art. 17 implies a right to Belorussian nationality[65] This right is not subject to prescription and nationality may be restored on initiative of the interested person at any moment. However, to restore nationality, Art. 17 requires that all conditions set forth by Art. 13, excluding permanent residence have to be met. This includes, among others, the submission of an application to the authorities competent for naturalization. Since no simplified procedure is provided for, the application has to follow the ordinary procedure for granting nationality.\n\nThe Belorussian law adopts a very strict approach towards ethnic Belorussians who, on the day of entry into force of the law, had their permanent residence in other former Soviet Republics. For instance, according to this provision, ethnic Belorussians, working in Estonia, cannot acquire the nationality of Belarus by a simple declaration, but only through the quite complicate procedure of Art. 17.\n\n(4) Reintegration:\n\nPursuant to Art. 21, a person who previously had Belorussian nationality, and who has lost it prior to the day of coming into force of the nationality law, may be reintegrated into it[66]Reintegration may occur either on the basis of an individual application or by the competent authority if the interested person manifests his/her consent to it.\n\nApplications have to follow the ordinary procedure for acquisition of nationality. The law does not further describe in which way an individual may be reintegrated into Belorussian nationality in case no application is submitted. However, for the reintegration of prior nationals, Art. 36 requires the adoption of a decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Therefore, it can be inferred that reintegration without previous application will rarely occur.\n\nFurther difficulties arise in ascertaining previous Belorussian nationality (i. e. nationality of the Belorussian SSR), since no nationality law has ever been adopted by the Belorussian SSR. The Belorussian nationality law of 18 October 1991 does not indicate any criteria to follow. In the absence of any provision, both Soviet law and Republican law will have to be considered. Determination of nationality will in any case not be easy.[67]\n\n3.3. Loss of Belorussian nationality.\n\nArt. 19 provides for renunciation of Belorussian nationality. An application has to be submitted and the ordinary procedure for granting nationality is applied. Acquisition of another nationality is not a pre-condition for the application. Pursuant to Art. 20, Belorussian nationality is withdrawn to individuals who acquire the nationality of another state, enrol in military forces or in the government of a foreign country without previous consent of Belarus or who acquired Belorussian nationality on the basis of false witnesses or documents. The nationality is lost from the day this facts are registered by the competent agencies of the Ministry of Interior or of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n3.4. Procedure for application.\n\nApplications for naturalization, reintegration and renunciation are submitted to agencies of the Ministry of Interior (or, for persons residing abroad, to diplomatic agencies of Belarus) and addressed to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus (Art. 34). The application and the attached documents are examined by the Nationality Commission established under the Presidium, which may collect further information on the applicant (Art. 35). On the basis of a recommendation by the Commission, the Presidium issues a decree conferring Belorussian nationality (Art. 36, para. 1). In case of rejection the Presidium adopts a resolution (Art. 36, para. 2). The decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court of Belarus (Art. 42). Nationality is acquired on the day of adoption of the decree. Pursuant to Art. 37, applications have to be examined by the competent authorities within one year. If the delay is not respected, as well as in other cases of unlawful actions committed by the competent authorities, the applicant may appeal to a court of law (Art. 43).\n\nIn case of rejection, subsequent applications can be submitted only after one year from the day of the first decision (Art. 38).\n\n3.5. Conclusions.\n\nThe territorial inclusive approach provides a satisfactory solution for permanent residents and is efficient in reducing statelessness on Belorussian territory. Excluded from the initial body of Belorussian citizens are only temporary residents, like, for instance, officials of the former Soviet Armed Forces stationed in Belarus.\n\nMore complicate is the situation for those Belorussians who have transferred their permanent residence outside the country before the day of entry into force of the nationality law. These people retain a (rather weak) right to Belorussian nationality, since they may acquire Belorussian nationality only on the basis of an application, except in those rare cases where a former Belorussian national is reintegrated into Belorussian nationality ex officio. The procedure to follow is rather complex and requires some time. However, there is no deadline for applications.\n\nIndividuals of Belorussian origin resident in other former Soviet Republics that do not acquire the nationality of another state, will be forced to remain stateless until their Belorussian nationality is not restored or reintegrated.\n\n4. Estonia[68]\n\nOn 16 November 1988 the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic adopted a declaration on the sovereignty of the Estonian SSR, according to which Estonian laws have primacy over Union laws[69]. On 30 March 1990 the same body issued a resolution proclaiming the restoration of pre-war Estonian statehood and the beginning of a transition period towards independence[69]Finally, during the August coup, on 20 August 1991, the Supreme Council of Estonia declared national independence[70]At the 1989 census ethnic Estonians formed 61.5 % of a total population of 1,565,662 people. The largest minority groups were Russians (30.3 %), Ukrainians (3.1 %) and Belorussians (1.8 %)[71]The introduction of an autonomous Estonian nationality has been discussed since 1988[72]However, the issue remained controversial. National radicals opposed to the adoption of a law that would grant Estonian nationality to all permanent residents. Their views were finally accepted by the Supreme Council on 26 February 1992, when it issued a decree which reintroduced the 1938 Estonian law on nationality in the version that existed on 16 June 1940, the day the Red Army entered Estonia[73]The resolution adopted an almost pure restored-state model.\n\n4.1. The definition of the initial body of citizens.\n\nEstonian citizenry is not defined on territorial terms. The key factor is previous Estonian nationality. With the 1992 resolution Estonian nationality was formally restored to inter-war nationals and their direct descendants (Res., para. 2), regardless of their present place of residence[74]No additional condition needs to be fulfilled. Former Estonians resident in other countries are not required to renounce their second nationality. According to traditional Estonian principles, the provision did not include direct descendants of Estonian mothers, except natural children.\n\nThe automatic acquisition of Estonian nationality has been extended to foreign women married to an Estonian national and children legitimized, adopted, or recognized by Estonian nationals, prior to 26 February 1992 (Resolution, para. 2).\n\nMoreover, the qualification period of two plus one year as well as the language test necessary for naturalization[75] had been waived for some 30,000 non-Estonians who registered with the Congress of Estonia prior to the elections for the Congress of Estonia in February 1990[76] It seems that they became Estonian nationals with the entry into force of the law[77]\n\nAll other people, regardless of the time they have been living in Estonia, who wish to acquire Estonian nationality must go through the ordinary naturalization process. The treaty concluded between Estonia and the URSS on 12 Jan. 1991, which has been interpreted by the Russian minority as granting almost automatic nationality to all non-Estonians legally residing in the country does not introduce any exception to it.[78]\n\nA substantial part of the Russian and other immigrants in Estonia had not been granted automatic nationality. Consequently, if they do not apply for the nationality of their country of origin or for Estonian naturalization, they will remain stateless.\n\nEstonia does not consider itself a successor state of the USSR. It argues not to be a new state, but the continuation of the inter-war republic[79] According to Estonian, pre-1940 statehood did not cease to exist with the Bolshevik annexation. It survived de jure throughout the whole period of Soviet rule and recrystallized with the regain of independence.\n\nThis argument seems sufficiently convincing. Not being a successor state to the USSR, Estonia has no obligation to grant its nationality to all habitual residents living on its territory. This does not exclude, however, that it may, for humanitarian or other reasons, grant Estonian nationality to members of the population that are not part of the restored citizenry, and that in some extreme cases such an action could be viewed as a moral obligation. But legally speaking no such obligation exists.\n\n4.2. Acquisition of nationality.\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nAccording to Art. 3 of the restored 1938 nationality law, Estonian nationality is acquired by children of Estonian fathers and by natural children of Estonian mothers. This restrictive interpretation of the principle of jus sanguinis has been modified on 23 March 1993, when the Estonian parliament extended the automatic acquisition of nationality by birth to the maternal line[80] With this amendment persons born to at least one parent who was an Estonian citizen at the time of birth automatically acquire Estonian nationality. Thus, the acquisition of Estonian citizenship has been brought in line with European standards.\n\nJus soli corrections are provided for children of stateless persons and for abandoned children found on Estonian territory[81]Nationality is acquired ipso facto.\n\nAdoption, recognition and legitimization of children by Estonian nationals are additional means of automatic acquisition of Estonian nationality.\n\n(2) Naturalization:\n\nNon-Estonians that wish to obtain Estonian nationality may, in principle, do it only through the procedure of naturalization. Thus, it is of primary importance to identify which are the pre-conditions required.\n\nApplicants for naturalization[82] must\n\n– be 18 years of age (or have obtained the consent of the parents or guardians);\n\n– have been residing in Estonia for two years before the submission and for one year after the submission of the application;\n\n– pass an examination in Estonian language[83]84;\n\n– have a legal source of income[84]and\n\n– swear allegiance to the Estonian state.\n\nAn additional pre-condition is contained in Art. 1, para. 2 of the 1938 law, which prohibits dual nationality[85]\n\nFor new immigrants, residence requirements are not very strict, if compared to other nationality laws. Applications may be submitted already after two years of permanent residence in Estonia and nationality acquired after the expiration of an additional one-year trial period during which the applicants are tested on their knowledge of Estonian language.\n\nFor people already resident in Estonia for a long time, however, the law is quite strict. Previous residence, regardless of its duration is not sufficient. They have to go through a reduced qualification period. At para. 5 the Resolution fixed the starting point of the two years on 30 March 1990, the day the parliament declared the transitional period towards the restoration of independence. This implied that nobody could be naturalized prior to 30 March 1993.\n\nApplications for naturalization will be rejected if they are submitted by persons who perform military service in another country, by former staff employees of the Soviet KGB and secret service, by individuals convicted of serious criminal offenses against persons or who have a criminal record of repeated convictions for felonies and individuals without a legal source of income[86]\n\nThe residence and language requirements may be waived for Estonian nationals[87]88, for stateless people that have been permanently residing in the country for at least ten years and for persons who have rendered particularly valuable services to Estonia (1938 law, Art. 7).\n\nThe latter provision has been reconfirmed in 1992[88](Resolution para. 8). Nominations for nationality are carried out at the place of work. According to a report by RFE/RL, on 4 May 1992 nineteen individuals obtained Estonian nationality through this simplified procedure[89]\n\nSimplified forms of naturalization existing for foreign women married to an Estonian national have been dropped[90]\n\n4.3. Loss of Estonian nationality.\n\nEstonian nationals may be released from Estonian nationality upon their own application or excluded from it by the Government of the Republic (1938 law, Art. 18). Paragraph 14 of the 1992 Resolution declared Art. 23 of the 1938 law, which listed the cases of withdrawal of Estonian nationality as non-applicable.\n\n4.4. Procedure of application.\n\nSome provisions relating to the procedure for application for naturalization are set forth in the 1938 law. Applications are addressed to the Government through the Ministry of Interior (Art. 9).Nationality is granted by the Government of the Republic of Estonia.\n\nThe Estonian nationality law does not provide for a maximum time limit for the examination of applications.\n\n4.5. Conclusions.\n\nEstonian nationality legislation reflects a restored-state model. The Estonian citizenry was formed by former nationals of the inter-war republic and their descendants. As seen above, this is not in breach of international law. Ethnic Estonians, who were not citizens of the inter-war republic, may acquire the Estonian nationality by a simplified form of naturalization, for which the residence and language requirements may be waived.\n\nNon-ethnic Estonians living in the country did not obtain Estonian nationality, unless (1) they (or one of their parents) were nationals of the inter-war Republic, (2) had an Estonian husband or (3) had registered for nationality prior to the elections for the Congress of Estonia in February 1990. It has been estimated that around 100,000 ethnic Russians automatically became Estonian nationals in this way[91]\n\nThe remaining non-ethnic Estonian population could apply for naturalization starting from 30 March 1992 and obtain Estonian citizenship from 30 March 1993, provided they pass the language test. According to available information, however, relatively few applications for Estonian or Russian nationality were submitted by such people[92] As a result, on 30 March 1993, some 400,000 to 500,000 residents were stateless[93] It is however believed that with its entry into force the rather strict aliens law adopted by the Estonian parliament on 21 June 1993[94]95, will force those people to apply for Estonian nationality or to repatriate.\n\n5. Georgia.\n\nIn November 1989 the Georgian Supreme Soviet declared the supremacy of Georgian laws over all-Union laws[95]Georgia declared its sovereignty on 9 March 1990[96]On 31 March 1991 a referendum on the restoration of previous Georgian independence[97] was carried out and 93 % of the population voted for independence[98]Some days later, on 9 April 1991, the Georgian Supreme Soviet passed a decree formally restoring independence[99]In June 1991 Georgia published a draft law on nationality, which required strict conditions for naturalization. Adopted under Gamsakhurdia[100]101, it was subsequently replaced by a new nationality law on 25 March 1993, which entered into force on the same day[101]Contrary to the nationality law of 1991, the current law has been drawn up following the new-state model. It does not allow dual citizenship (Art. 1).\n\n5.1. The initial body of citizens.\n\nPursuant to Art. 3 (a) of the new nationality law, all persons who have been permanently resident in Georgia for a period of at least five years and who were residing in Georgia on the day of entry into force of the nationality law, and who receive within a period of four months the papers confirming their nationality are considered as Georgian citizens.Such persons may, however, refuse citizenship in writing within three months. Possession of another nationality is not required in order to opt out.\n\nThe five years residence need not to be continuous, nor immediately prior to the day of entry into force of the law. Several periods of permanent residence may be added up in order to achieve the five years required by the law.\n\nFrom the letter of the provision it appears that persons who fulfill the residence requirements but who did not receive the above-mentioned certification within the required delay, are not considered as Georgian citizens. This clause introduces in the determination of the initial citizenry a discretionary element which may be exploited by the Georgian authorities in order to prevent certain persons from acquiring Georgian nationality by simply not issuing him the necessary documents. The fact that in presence of \"valid reasons\" Art. 45 allows to extend the four months period does not substantially change this situation.\n\nAlthough Georgia opted for a rather inclusive definition of its citizenry, the nationality law left an open door that may be exploited in order to exclude people or groups of people arbitrarily.\n\nAs a final remark, it may be noted that ethnic Georgians who are not permanently living in Georgia are not granted a privileged status. They may not acquire Georgian nationality by a simplified procedure.\n\n5.2. Acquisition of nationality.\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nGeorgia adheres to the principle of jus sanguinis. Pursuant to Art. 11, Georgian nationality is automatically acquired by children of two Georgian nationals, regardless of the place of birth. If only one parent has Georgian citizenship, the child acquires Georgian nationality if born on Georgian territory or, otherwise, if one of the parents has permanent residence in Georgia (Art. 12). In other cases the nationality of the child is decided on the basis of a common declaration by the parents.\n\nJus soli is applied to children of stateless persons permanently resident in Georgia (Art. 13), to children of a Georgian national and a stateless person (Art. 12,c) as well as to children found on the territory of Georgia (Art. 15). These categories of people automatically acquire Georgian nationality if born in Georgia. The latter are considered as Georgian nationals until information on the contrary emerge.\n\nGeorgian nationality is furthermore automatically acquired by foreign or stateless children adopted by a Georgian national (Art. 20). Interestingly, a Georgian national adopted by foreign or stateless parents preserves his nationality (Art. 21).\n\n(2) Naturalization:\n\nThe conditions for naturalization are set forth in Art. 26 of the law. In order to naturalize as Georgian citizen a person must have attained full legal age and submit an application to the Ministry of Justice. In addition the following pre-conditions must be fulfilled:\n\n– permanent residence on the territory of Georgia for the last ten years;\n\n– knowledge of Georgian or Abkhazian language, corresponding to the established minimal level;\n\n– knowledge of the Georgian history and constitution, corresponding to the established minimal level;\n\n– have a job or own immovable property in the Republic of Georgia.\n\nPersons who have been sentenced for crimes that are punished with more than three years of imprisonment are excluded from the procedure of naturalization, unless the sentence has been cancelled (Art. 26, para. 2)\n\nAlthough being rather strict, the pre-conditions for naturalization are in line with international standards.\n\n(3) Marriage:\n\nA simplified naturalization procedure has been established for persons married to a Georgian national who have been living with their spouse on the territory of Georgia for three years prior to the submission of the application for Georgian nationality. Pursuant to Art. 28 such persons may acquire Georgian nationality provided they fulfill the language conditions and the knowledge of Georgian history and constitution as required for naturalization and that they have not committed a crime falling under the exclusion clause at Art. 26, para. 2[102]\n\n(4) Reintegration:\n\nReintegration into Georgian nationality is provided for persons illegally deprived of their nationality and for persons who lost Georgian nationality as a result of changes of nationality by their parents. The latter may acquire Georgian nationality provided they are permanently resident in Georgia and fulfill the language, history and constitution knowledge required by Art. 26 and are not excluded for having committed a crime under Art. 26, para. 2[103]\n\n5.3. Loss of Georgian citizenship.\n\nIn order to renounce Georgian citizenship it is necessary to file an application. Possession of another nationality is not a pre-condition. Applications for renunciation are examined according to the general procedure for nationality matters and decisions taken by Presidential decree or directive. Moreover, Georgian nationality is lost by citizens (1) who enter any occupation as official in another state, (2) who have been leaving in another country and without valid reasons have not registered at the Georgian consulate in a period of two years, (3) who acquired Georgian citizenship on the basis of forged documents and (4) who have acquired another nationality.\n\nClaims for the loss of Georgian citizenship may be submitted to the Ministry of Justice by a court, the office of public persecution, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as, the responsible diplomatic representation, for citizens residing abroad (Art. 35). Decisions on the loss of Georgian citizenship are taken by the President of Georgia after the preliminary examination by the Ministry of Justice.\n\n5.4. Procedure.\n\nWhile the nationality law sets forth the basic provisions, a detailed examination procedure will be set up by Presidential decree. Applications for naturalization, reintegration and renunciation of Georgian nationality are submitted to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Georgia (Art. 34). The latter collects the necessary documents for the examination of the case and drafts preliminary conclusions (Art. 36). The final decision is taken by the President of Georgia in form of a decree, if it is a positive decision and in form of a directive when the application is rejected (Art. 37). A negative decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Georgia (Art. 42).\n\nExaminations of applications shall not exceed the time limit of one year (Art. 38).\n\n5.5. Conclusions.\n\nThe original body of citizens has been determined on the basis of prolonged permanent residence (five years) in the country, regardless of ethnic origin. It thus excludes recent immigrants as well as temporary residents like officials of the former Soviet Forced stationed in the country. On the contrary, people born and who lived in Georgia for at least five years, but left for another republic of the Soviet Union, are eligible for Georgian nationality, provided they returned to Georgia prior to 25 March 1993. This includes a number of ethnic Georgians that repatriated after the declaration of independence in 1991.\n\nProblems may, however, derive from the clause introduced in Art. 3 which require the receipt of a certification of nationality in order to make the automatic acquisition operative. Such a provision may be used by the authorities responsible for the application of the law as a means to exclude arbitrarily certain people from Georgian citizenship, which would be in breach of the rule on succession of nationality set out in the first part of this study and would at the same time increase the number of stateless people in the country.\n\nSimilarly, the right to opt out included in Art. 3 may lead to statelessness, since acquisition of another nationality is not required as a pre-condition.\n\nThe Georgian nationality law, finally, does not contain a simplified procedure facilitating the acquisition of nationality for ethnic Georgians residing abroad on the day of entry into force of the nationality law and who wish to repatriate to the newly created Republic of Georgia. If these persons want to acquire Georgian nationality they have to fulfill all conditions for naturalization, including ten years of residence. Meanwhile, if they do not have another nationality, as it may be the case for Georgians living in some former Soviet republics, they will remain stateless.\n\n6. Kazakhstan\n\nOn 25 October 1990 Kazakhstan adopted a declaration of economic sovereignty and asserted its control over the natural resources of the Republic. However, it took until 16 December 1991 until a declaration of independence was finally adopted[104]105In the 1989 census Kazakhs formed the largest ethnic group (39.7 %), followed by Russians (37.8 %), Germans (5.8 %) and Ukrainians (5.4 %)[105]Few days after the declaration of independence, on 20 December 1991, Kazakhstan adopted a nationality law.[106]No information on the law has been available, except that it allows ethnic Kazakhs who currently reside outside Kazakhstan to return[107]\n\n7. Kyrgyzstan.\n\nKyrgyzstan declared its sovereignty on 15 December 1990 and issued its declaration of independence on 31 August 1991[108]Ethnic Kyrghyz form 52.4 % of the population. The major minority groups are Russians (21.5 %), Uzbeks (12.9 %), Ukrainians (2.4 %) and Germans (1.6 %)[109]. According to an article published in the Russian newspaper Nezavisimaia Gazeta on 3 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan passed a nationality law before the declaration of independence, which is said to be very similar to the one adopted in Azerbaijan[110]\n\nIn Spring 1993 the Kyrghyz authorities have drawn up a new draft citizenship law, which is deemed to replace the one adopted before August 1991[111]\n\n7.1. Definition of the initial body of citizens.\n\nNo information is available on the way Kyrgyzstan has determined its initial citizenry in the first nationality law. The 1993 draft is of no further help, since it recognizes as citizens all persons who had Kyrghyz citizenship on the day of its entry into force.\n\n7.2. Acquisition of nationality.\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nAccording to the principle of jus sanguinis children of two Kyrghyz nationals ipso facto acquire Kyrghyz nationality at birth. Reportedly, the 1991 law conferred Kyrghyz nationality at birth also to children of a Kyrghyz citizen and an unknown or stateless person (Art. 15)[112]\n\nExcept for children of a Kyrghyz citizen and a stateless person, such provisions are reconfirmed in the 1993 draft law. The draft also grants ipso facto nationality at birth to children of stateless persons permanently resident in the country and to children of unknown parents found on the territory of Kyrgyzstan.\n\n(2) Naturalization:\n\nReportedly, the 1991 law did not require any pre-condition for the submission of an application for naturalization[113]\n\nOn the contrary, the 1993 draft requires renunciation of previous citizenship, permanent residence in Kyrgyzstan during the last five years and a lawful source of income. The residence requirement may be waived for certain categories of people, including ethnic Kyrghyz, persons who rendered special services to Kyrgyzstan and persons restoring Kyrghyz nationality.\n\nThe draft law denies Kyrghyz citizenship to persons (1) convicted for grave crimes, (2) who promote ethnic clashes and propagate war, (3) who engage in activities in contrast with the interests of the Kyrghyz Republic and (4) who are involved in terrorist acts.\n\n(3) Restoration:\n\nAccording to the 1993 draft, upon application former Kyrghyz citizens may restore citizenship of Kyrgyzstan. Restoration is effected by the President of the Kyrghyz Republic.\n\n7.3. Loss of citizenship.\n\nLittle is known about the relevant provisions of the 1991 law. Reportedly, Kyrghyz nationality is lost if a Kyrghyz subject has been residing abroad without registering with the Kyrghyz authorities for a period of more than five years[114]\n\nThe new draft law provides for the right to renounce citizenship of Kyrgyzstan upon application. Further, Kyrghyz citizenship is lost if a citizen takes up an occupation as official in another state without Kyrgyzstan's authorization and if a person permanently residing abroad has not been registered with the consular office for a period of one year.\n\n7.4. Conclusion.\n\nThe 1991 nationality law has been adopted under Soviet rule and does not reflect subsequent political changes. At Art. 1, for instance, it provides that citizens of Kyrgyzstan are at the same time citizens of the USSR. It seems to contain several lacunas, particularly with regard to naturalization. While the 1993 draft would fill this legal gap on naturalization, it also sets up strict provisions deemed to prevent the acquisition of nationality and facilitates the loss of nationality by citizens residing abroad.\n\n8. Latvia[116]\n\nOn 4 May 1990 the Latvian Supreme Council adopted a resolution which declared the Soviet annexation as unlawful and the beginning of a transitional period towards full independence[115]One year later, in a referendum held on 3 March 1991, 73.7 % of the population expressed themselves in favor of an independent Latvia[116]. Finally, on 21 August 1991, the Supreme Council proclaimed independence.[117]Among the Baltic Republics Latvia has the greatest number of immigrants. Ethnic Latvians form approx. 52 % of the Latvian population. The most important minorities are 905,000 Russians (42 % of the population), 119,700 Belorussians (4.5 %) and 92,100 Poles (3.5 %).[118]\n\n8.1. Legal developments in nationality matters.\n\nWith the move towards independence, the question of Latvian nationality gained considerable importance. A first draft law on nationality was drawn up and published for discussion in July 1989[119]As it had been the case in Estonia, national radicals gained strength and obstructed the adoption of a nationality law.\n\nNevertheless, two months after the August coup, on 15 October 1991, the Supreme Council adopted a resolution \"On the Restoration of the Rights of Citizens of the Republic of Latvia and Main Conditions for Naturalization\"[120] setting forth the principles that a nationality law should follow. The resolution restored inter-war Latvian nationality and re-introduced the pre-war Latvian nationality law. A very strict approach was adopted for all individuals that did not have their nationality restored. They could acquire Latvian nationality through ordinary naturalization. This required, among other conditions, at least 16 years of permanent residence, renunciation of previous nationality and knowledge of Latvian language.[121] In addition, the resolution listed a series of individuals that could not acquire Latvian nationality. It included, among others, persons who performed anti-constitutional activities against Latvia's independence and its democratic system, individuals who served in former Soviet military forces or state security, persons sent to Latvia after 17 June 1940 as Soviet Communist Party or Komsomol personnel, drug addicts, chronic alcoholics and people without a legal source of income.[122]\n\nThe nationalist movement criticized the resolution and argued that it was passed by a body which was not representative of the existing Latvian citizenry[123] In their eyes, only a newly elected Supreme Council would be competent to regulate matters of nationality. As a result, the resolution has not been implemented and no nationality law has been passed as of June 1993. The issue has been taken up by the new Parliament elected on 5/6 June and the adoption of a nationality law is expected before the end of the year.\n\n8.2. The initial body of citizens.\n\nAt present, the initial body of citizens is formed by pre-war Latvian nationals and their descendants. Latvian nationality, suspended for about five decades re-emerged by operation of law on the moment of restoration of Latvian statehood.\n\nThe current draft law on nationality follows the October 1991 resolution and adopts a restored-state approach. The initial body of citizens is formed by inter-war Latvian nationals and their descendants. The basic requirements for naturalization are 16 or, alternatively, 10 years of permanent residence[124]126, knowledge of Latvian language[125] and of the basic principles of the Latvian Constitution and renunciation of previous nationality. In addition, following the model of the 1991 resolution, the draft excludes persons \"closely linked to the former Soviet army, police and security service\"[126]\n\nOn 11 December 1991 Latvia has adopted a law on registration of residents which served as a basis for determining the status of the present population in order to establish the group of people who were allowed to vote in the political elections of 5/6 June 1993. As a result of the registration, former citizens of inter-war Latvia and their descendants were given a Latvian passport[127] and had the right to vote the new Parliament[128] By the end of January 1993 some 88 % of Latvia's permanent residents had registered; some 75 % of them are Latvian citizens[129] For other permanent residents registration will serve as a basis for naturalization, once a Latvian nationality law is adopted.\n\nFormer Latvian residents, who were forced to leave the country and their descendants may also be registered as Latvian citizens if they transfer their permanent residence to Latvia. The same right of registration as Latvian nationals has been granted to children of unknown parents permanently residing in Latvia[130]\n\n8.3. Conclusions.\n\nLatvia did not issue a nationality law. However, with the restoration of the Latvia state, pre-war Latvian nationality legislation re-emerged, by operation of law. In practice, the old Latvian law is used to determine the nationality of newly born children. For the rest, the nationality regime is expected to be set up by the new law currently in preparation.\n\nThe issue is of considerable importance, since several political and civil rights are linked with the status of Latvian citizen. For instance, Art. 9 of the constitutional law of 10 December 1991 on rights and obligations of a citizen and a person, limits ownership of land and other natural resources to Latvian citizens.\n\nLike Estonia and Lithuania, Latvia is not a new state. With the resolution on 4 May 1990 the Latvian Supreme Council restored inter-war statehood. Latvia is not a successor state of the Soviet Union and thus not bound to confer its nationality to all permanent residents. A UN fact finding mission to Latvia on 27-30 October 1992 reached the same conclusions stating that \"Latvia is not in breach of international law by the way it determines the criteria for granting its citizenship\"[131]\n\nHowever, for Latvia, some obligations derive from treaty-law. On 14 April 1992 Latvia acceded to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness of 1961[132] According to Art. 1 of the Convention Latvia \"shall grant its nationality to a person born in its territory who would otherwise be stateless\". Nationality shall be granted at birth, by operation of law, or upon an application which may not be rejected. Thus, children of stateless persons, including Russians and other immigrants who did not acquire any nationality, have a right to be granted Latvian nationality. The obligation to confer nationality includes people born on the territory of Latvia before the day of accession, provided they fulfill the age and residence requirement that a state may set up[133] On the basis of this provision a considerable part of permanent residents, and in particular the younger generation, has a right to become Latvian nationals[134]\n\n9. Lithuania[134]\n\nSome months before the proclamation of independence on 11 March 1990, Lithuania issued its first nationality law. The law adopted on 3 November 1989 was the first nationality law adopted in former Soviet Republics[135]Because of its relatively homogeneous population, the nationality issue was easily resolved in Lithuania[136]\n\nThe 1989 law adopted a very liberal approach. All permanent residents were given an opportunity to acquire Lithuanian nationality valid for two years. Persons who were citizens of the Republic of Lithuania, their children and grandchildren, as well as persons who were permanent residents, on the current territory of the Lithuanian SSR, prior to 15 July 1940 and their children and grandchildren, who now are or who have been permanent residents of the Lithuanian SSR are ipso facto considered as Lithuanian citizens (Art. 1 at point 1)[137]This group of persons is integrated by all persons who have a permanent place of residence in the Lithuanian SSR, provided they or at least one of their parents or grandparents were born on its territory, and that they are not citizens of another state (Art. 1 at point 2).\n\nAll other permanent residents of Lithuania on the day of entry into force of the 1989 law, who have a legal source of income were granted a right of option. According to it they could choose to become Lithuanian nationals within a period of two years following the entry into force of the law (Art. 1 at point 3). In such a case Lithuanian nationality was acquired by signing a declaration of respect of the Lithuanian Constitution and laws[138]\n\nArt. 1 (3) allowed the naturalization of a great number of non-Lithuanians living in the country. Reportedly, by the end of the two-years period in November 1991, a large majority of non-ethnic Lithuanians had opted for Lithuanian nationality[139]\n\nOn 5 December 1991, Lithuania issued a new nationality law, which entered into force on 11 December 1991[140] and is currently applied.\n\n9.1. The definition of the initial body of citizens.\n\nAt a first glance, the 1991 nationality law attributes to Lithuanian origin more importance than the 1989 law. Pursuant to Art. 1, para. 1 of this law, all persons that were citizens of the inter-war Republic of Lithuania and their children and grandchildren are considered as citizens of Lithuania.\n\nThe initial body of citizens includes further all persons who had permanent residence on the territories of Lithuania in the period from 9 January 1919 to 15 June 1940, as well as their children and grandchildren, provided they were permanent residents of Lithuania on 11 December 1991 and that they do not have another nationality (Art. 1, para. 2)[141]\n\nFinally, at Art. 1, para. 3, the 1991 law recognized as Lithuanian nationals those people who acquired Lithuanian citizenship under the 1989 nationality law. Thanks to this provision a great number of members of the national minorities, who had opted for Lithuanian nationality according to the 1989 law, could preserve their Lithuanian nationality.\n\nLike Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania argues not to be a new state, but the continuation of the inter-war Republic. The 1989 Lithuanian law adopted a mixed solution. It reconfirmed inter-war nationality, but integrated it with the mechanism of the right of option, granting a two-years right to acquire Lithuanian nationality to all permanent residents. All permanent residents had the opportunity to become Lithuanian nationals. Two years seems to be a sufficiently long period for allowing people to express their preferences and choices.\n\n9.2. Acquisition of nationality.\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nAccording to Art. 8 of the 1991 law a child, both of whose parents are Lithuanian nationals automatically acquires Lithuanian nationality, regardless of the place of birth (Art. 8, jus sanguinis principle). If only one of the parents is a citizen of Lithuania the child acquires automatically Lithuanian nationality, if born on the territory of Lithuania or, if not, when, at the moment of birth, at least one of the parents had permanent residence in Lithuania (Art. 9, para. 1). Otherwise, the child may acquire Lithuanian nationality on the basis of a common declaration by the parents. If one of the parents is Lithuanian and the other is unknown or stateless, the child acquires Lithuanian nationality ipso facto (Art. 9 para. 3).\n\nAutomatic acquisition according to the principle of jus soli principle occurs in case of children of stateless people and of unknown parents found on Lithuanian territory (Arts. 10 and 11).\n\nThe law does not provide for the case of adoption[142]\n\n(2) Acquisition of nationality under Art. 17 and restoration of nationality:\n\nSimplified procedures of acquisition of nationality are provided for former Lithuanian nationals or other persons of Lithuanian origin, residing outside the territory of Lithuania and who were not included in the original body of Lithuanian citizens.\n\na) According to Art. 17 citizens of the inter-war Lithuanian state and other persons of Lithuanian origin retain a right to Lithuanian nationality. They also enjoy immigration privileges, since they may enter the country and reside on its territory without the need of a visa and of other conditions required by the law on immigration.\n\nThe law distinguishes two categories of people who retain a right to Lithuanian nationality.\n\nPre-war Lithuanian citizens residing abroad and having a nationality, other than the Lithuanian, may re-acquire Lithuanian citizenship automatically, if they renounce the other nationality[143]\n\nChildren of pre-war Lithuanian nationals who were born in Lithuania or in refugee camps and are residing in another state (Art. 17, para. 1 at point 2) as well as other persons of Lithuanian origin who are residing in foreign states (Art. 17, para. 1 at point 3) may acquire Lithuanian nationality in a simplified way. Renunciation of current nationality, transfer of permanent residence to Lithuania and the taking of the oath of the Republic of Lithuania are pre-conditions (Art. 18, para. 2).\n\nIn these cases Lithuanian nationality is acquired on the basis of a formal application to local agencies of the Ministry of Interior or to diplomatic agencies in case of applicants residing abroad. When all the conditions of Art. 17 are fulfilled the applicant has a right to Lithuanian nationality[144] Decisions are adopted by the Ministry of Interior (Art. 31, para. 3).\n\nb) Inter-war Lithuanian citizens who left Lithuania in the period from 15 June 1940 to 11 March 1990 and are still residing in another state, as well as their children, provided they have not acquired the nationality of another state by birth, may have their Lithuanian nationality restored. Restoration of Lithuanian nationality is a privileged means of acquisition of nationality for people who fled during Soviet occupation.\n\nRestoration of nationality may be automatic in case a Lithuanian passport has been issued to the applicant. Otherwise, a written declaration stating that the applicant is a Lithuanian national, supplied with the relating evidence, has to be directly submitted to the Ministry of Interior, which will proceed to restore Lithuanian nationality. Art. 28, para. 13 states that once the requirements set forth in Art. 18, para. 3, are met, the applicant shall receive a Lithuanian passport. It can be inferred from it that the application may not be rejected, unless the conditions of Art. 18, para. 3 are not fulfilled.\n\nMoreover, Art. 18, para. 3 can be seen as an exception to the general rule that forbids dual nationality. Since it does not require the applicants to renounce the other nationality the principle lex specialis derogat lex generalis should be applied.\n\n(3) Naturalization:\n\nAliens that cannot or did not acquire Lithuanian nationality through other means may apply for naturalization, provided they meet the required conditions. Pursuant to Art. 12 applicants are required to\n\n– pass an examination in Lithuanian language[145]148;\n\n– be permanently resident in Lithuania for the last ten years;\n\n– have a permanent place of employment or a constant legal source of income in Lithuania;\n\n– pass an examination in the basic provisions of the constitution of the Republic of Lithuania;\n\n– to be stateless or to renounce former nationality[146]\n\nThe last paragraph of Art. 12 provides that persons meeting these conditions shall be granted Lithuanian nationality \"taking into consideration the interests of the Republic of Lithuania\". This reference implies more discretionary powers in examining and also in rejecting applications for naturalization.\n\nAlthough quite strict, the provisions for Lithuanian naturalization are in conformity with international standards.\n\nA person that has contracted marriage with a national of Lithuania and has resided in Lithuania and maintained the marital status during the last three years may apply for Lithuanian nationality without the need to fulfill all the conditions set forth in Art. 12. More particularly, no proof of legal source of income is required and the time of residence is reduced to three years.\n\nArt. 13 lists a number of reasons that preclude the granting of nationality. Persons who have committed crimes against humanity, persons who took part in criminal activities against the Republic of Lithuania, persons who have been sentenced to imprisonment for a crime under Lithuanian law, persons who are chronic alcoholics or drug addicts and persons who carry \"extremely infectious diseases\" may not be granted Lithuanian nationality.\n\n9.3. Loss of nationality.\n\nRenunciation of Lithuanian nationality is possible only upon application. However, possession of another nationality is not required. Lithuanian nationality shall, moreover, be lost if a person acquires citizenship of another state and for other reasons provided for by international agreements (Art. 19). Moreover, pursuant to Art. 21, a person loses Lithuanian nationality (1) if she or he has been living abroad for an uninterrupted period of more then three years without a valid Lithuania passport and (2) if she or he has joined military service in another state or has been employed as a state official without the permission of the Lithuanian authorities. Lithuanian nationality is lost by a directive of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have the power to submit motions to establish that a person has lost Lithuanian citizenship (Art. 28 para 7).\n\nFinally, Art. 23 lists the cases in which the granting of Lithuanian nationality may be declared invalid. These include (1) individuals who fraudulently acquired Lithuanian nationality, (2) who have been convicted for a crime against humanity or a crime against the Republic of Lithuania, (3) who, in the period after 15 June 1940, have organized or carried out deportations or exterminations of Lithuanian residents and suppressed the resistance movement or (4) who, after 11 March 1990, took part in activities against the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Lithuania. Since some of the clauses have been formulated in a rather vague form, if broadly interpreted, this provisions may lead to abusive deprivation of nationality.\n\nLithuanian nationality may be returned to individuals that have been deprived of it, unless nationality was lost because of acquisition of the nationality of another state. Therefore an application has to be filed. The requirements of naturalization (except the language examination and the examination on the Lithuanian constitution) need to be met. Nationality is re-acquired by a directive from the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania.\n\n9.4. Procedure for application.\n\nApplications for naturalization, renunciation and returning of nationality are addressed to the Presidium of the Supreme Council (Art. 28, para. 8). Applications for acquisition of nationality under Art. 17 are to be filed with local agencies of the Ministry of Interior, or respectively, with the diplomatic agencies of Lithuania (Art. 28, parr. 9 and 10). Applications for restoration are filed directly with the Ministry of Interior (Art. 28, para. 11).Applications regarding citizenship issues are examined by the Citizenship Committee under the Presidium of the Supreme Council, which can collect further information from other state agencies and which may also invite the applicant to a hearing (Art. 29, para. 2).\n\nWith regard to applications for naturalization, renunciation and returning of nationality, the Citizenship Committee recommends to the Presidium to take a positive decision. Should the Committee refuse to recommend the applicant, the latter must be notify in writing on the reasons for the rejection (Art. 29, para. 4). The Presidium of the Supreme Council takes the final decision. In case of positive decisions it issues a directive which is published in the \"Official Reports of the Supreme Council and Government of the Republic of Lithuania\" (Art. 33). Otherwise, if the application is rejected it adopts an appropriate resolution (Art. 31, para. 2). Renewed applications shall not be considered prior to one year after the first decision (Art. 34).\n\nDecisions on applications for nationality under Art. 17 and on restoration of nationality are taken by the Minister of Internal Affairs (Art. 31, para. 3).\n\nThe acquisition of nationality becomes effective only after the person has taken the oath of the Republic of Lithuania (Art. 31, para. 4).\n\nThe law does not provide for a time limit within which nationality applications need to be examined.\n\nA special procedure is provided for foreign nationals who have been of merit to the Republic of Lithuania. They can file an application directly with the Presidium of the Supreme Council, which will be submitted to the Committee of Deputies of the Supreme Council for consideration (Arts 16 and 28, para. 4).\n\n9.5. Conclusions.\n\nIn 1989 Lithuania opted for a quite inclusive approach and gave to all permanent residents the opportunity to acquire Lithuanian nationality. Most ethnic non-Lithuanians made used of this opportunity and opted for Lithuanian nationality. Although the 1991 law introduced a stricter approach, those who had opted for Lithuanian nationality according to the provisions of the 1989 law were recognized as Lithuanian nationals also by the 1991 law. Thus, only those who did not opt for Lithuanian nationality in the two-years time period from the entry into force of the 1989 law, were not included in the Lithuanian citizenry. The Lithuanian nationality law is, moreover, very inclusive for people of Lithuanian origin living outside the country. Problems of statelessness may, however, arise from the provisions on the loss of nationality, inasmuch as individuals who have been living abroad for an uninterrupted period of more than three years without a valid passport may lose the Lithuanian nationality.\n\n10. Moldova\n\nOn 23 June 1990 the Moldovan Supreme Soviet passed a declaration of sovereignty which asserted the supremacy of Moldova's Constitution and laws throughout the Republic. In addition, the annexation of Bessarabia by the USSR in 1940 was declared as illegal[147]Moldova proclaimed its independence on 27 August 1991[148]\n\nAccording to the 1989 census only 64.5 % of the population are Moldovans (ethnic Rumanians), 13.8 % are Ukrainians, 13 % Russians, 3.5 % Gagauz. In January 1991, the total population has been estimated 4,367,000[149]On 5 June 1991 sovereign Moldova issued its nationality law[150]153, which entered into force on the day of its publication[151] On 4 August 1992 the Moldovan Parliament passed a decree which implemented regulatory provisions for the application of the law.\n\n10.1. The definition of the initial body of citizens.\n\nMoldova did not define its original body of citizens in pure territorial terms. The criteria followed are mixed, and to a great extend, based on origin. Pursuant to Art. 2 of the Moldovan nationality law of 1991, nationality is acquired ipso facto on the day of entry into force of the law by:\n\na) all persons that resided on the present territory of the Republic of Moldova before June 1940 (Art. 2, para. 1);\n\nb) all descendants of those persons, provided they were residing on the territory of the Republic of Moldova on the day the nationality law entered into force (Art. 2, para. 1);\n\nc) all persons born and resident on the Republic of Moldova; if born elsewhere, they acquire nationality if, at least, one parent was born on the territory of present Moldova (Art. 2, para. 2). The 1991 law considers as Moldovan nationals also those individuals who had permanent residence on the territory of Moldova as well as a legal means of existence before 23 June 1990, the day of the declaration of sovereignty. However, acquisition does not operate ipso facto. The Parliamentary resolution adopted at the same date[152]requires those individuals to submit a declaration to local agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, within one year from the adoption of the nationality law (5 June 1991)[153]They will be considered citizens of Moldova from the day they submit the declaration. Thus, the individuals concerned have only a one-year period of choice, in spite of the express provision at Art. 2, para. 3 of the nationality law, which recognizes them automatically as Moldovan citizens.\n\nA new state has an obligation under international law to grant its nationality to all permanent residents on its territory. This obligation has not been fully respected by Moldova. It may be presumed that, for various reasons, a part of the concerned population has not been able to submit a declaration before the established deadline.[154]In certain cases, those people may have obtained the nationality of another former Soviet republic. However, it is likely that a large number did not so and that they remained stateless.\n\n10.2. Acquisition of nationality.\n\n(1) Birth:\n\nThe basic principle is ius sanguinis (Art. 10). Children of a Moldovan mother or father obtain Moldovan nationality at the moment of birth. Ius soli is applied only for children of unknown parents (Art. 10, para. 5). According to Moldovan law children of stateless persons do not automatically acquire nationality if born on Moldovan territory. At present, such children will have to wait until they reach the age of 18 years and then go through the ordinary naturalization procedure.\n\nAt Art. 11 the Moldovan nationality law regulates the acquisition of nationality through adoption. In such case nationality is acquired ipso facto at the moment of the adoption if both parents are Moldovan subjects (or the one is Moldovan and the other stateless) and if the child has not reached the age of 18 years. Should only one of the adoptive parents be of Moldovan nationality and the other a foreign citizen, the child acquires Moldovan nationality by the parent's mutual agreement[155]158, or, in absence of it, by decision of the court.\n\n(2) Naturalization (Art. 15):\n\nForeign citizens or stateless persons may apply for naturalization, provided that they\n\n– are 18 years of age; -have been permanently residing on the territory of the Republic of Moldova for a period of at least 10 years; the time is reduced to three years in case of individuals married to a Moldovan subject;[156]\n\n– have a legal source of income in the Republic;\n\n– have a sufficient knowledge of the state language;\n\n– are familiar with the Moldovan Constitution;\n\n– show proof of their devotion to the Moldovan state and people;\n\n– renounce their former nationality and\n\n– take an oath of allegiance.\n\nAlthough the requirements are laid down in quite a detailed way, the pre-condition regarding 'devotion' to the Moldovan state is formulated in rather vague and ambiguous terms. Since it is based on the subjective appreciation of the decision maker it may lead to abuses. However, such vague notions can be found in other nationality laws[157]and are thus not in contrast with international practice.\n\nMoldovan citizenship can be denied to people who (1) are or were convicted to prison sentences; (2) took part in repressions; (3) committed international crimes or crimes against humanity; (4) stir national or racial hatred and propagates fascism, chauvinism or stalinism; (5) perform an activity which undermines the security of the state, or public order, health and morality of the population; (6) call for anti-constitutional changes of the Republic of Moldova; (7) are involved in terrorist activities; (8) are citizens of another state (Art. 20).\n\nArt. 20 is also applicable to restoration and reintegration, in brief to any conferment of nationality which is not automatic or based purely on a declaration.\n\nIt is worth noting that, the reference to \"national and racial hatred\" is rather vague and could be applied to minority groups as a whole instead of examining the position of each individual. While these provisions are in principle not contrary to international human rights standards, their interpretation and application by national officials may well lead to breaches of norms of international law, such as the principle of non-discrimination.\n\n(3) Restoration of Moldovan nationality:\n\nLike other nationality laws of former USSR Republics, the Moldovan nationality law provides for simplified procedures of acquisition of nationality for individuals who were directly or indirectly forced to leave the Moldovan territory after the Soviet annexation in 1940.\n\na) Pursuant to Art. 14, para. 1, all persons who quitted the territory of Moldova or were expelled from it, after 1940, have a right to Moldovan nationality. This right is also conferred to their children and grandchildren. To reobtain Moldovan nationality, Art. 24 requires the submission of an official application. Art. 25 fixes the deadline of one year from the adoption of the nationality law (5 June 1991). No special procedure is provided for. It appears that the ordinary procedure for acquisition of nationality has to be followed[158]\n\nNeither the nationality law nor the decree on its application refer to additional pre-conditions that need to be fulfilled by the applicant. However, it can be deduced from Arts. 6 and 15 (at points 6 and 20) of the nationality law and of Art. 6 of the application decree that, in general, the applicant would have to renounce his other nationality, since dual nationality is not admitted, except for special cases provided for by international treaties to which Moldova is party. On the contrary, resettlement into the territory of sovereign Moldova is not required. The provision allows Moldovans residing and working in Moscow or Kiev to apply for the restoration of Moldovan nationality without necessarily moving to Moldova. Since Art. 14 refers to a right to nationality, Moldovan officials should not have large discretionary powers in examining applications for restoration. If the above-statd conditions are fulfilled the application should be rejected only in relation to the categories of individuals listed in Art. 20 (grounds for denial of Moldovan citzenship, see supra under naturalization).\n\nb) According to Art. 14, para. 2, other descendants of Moldova may acquire Moldova's nationality on the condition that they transfer their permanent residence into Moldovan territory. This paragraph embraces children and grandchildren of emigrants and individuals who left Moldova prior to 1940 and their descendants. Since para. 2 has to be read and interpreted together with para. 1, settlement into Moldova has to be viewed as an additional pre-condition to be added to those required for the application of para. 1.\n\nAlthough the provisions of Art. 14 are primarily intended to give a sort of right of option to former Moldovans that escaped or were expelled from the Soviet Union, no distinction is made between individuals residing outside the former USSR and people living in one of the former Soviet republics.\n\nSimilarly, Art. 14 applies to former Moldovan USSR officials, stationed abroad, unless they can claim to have Moldovan ascendant prior to 1940 or that they were permanently residing in Moldova's territory on 23 June 1991[159]\n\n(4) Reintegration into Moldovan nationality:\n\nArt. 17 envisages the case of individuals that possessed Moldovan nationality, but lost it subsequently. They can reacquire Moldovan nationality through"
