Known primarily as a maker of dance-oriented films, Ardolino helped create the influential television documentary series "Dance in America" in 1975.

Ardolino won an Academy Award for the 1983 documentary "He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'." He also won an Emmy for "Choreography by Balanchine IV" and a Directors Guild of America award for "The Spellbound Child."

His first feature film, 1987's "Dirty Dancing," was a huge box-office success and made Ardolino a force in Hollywood. The film, which starred Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, was about a young girl and a street-smart dance instructor who meet at a hotel in the Catskills.

Ardolino went on to make "Chances Are" in 1988, "Three Men and a Little Lady" in 1990 and "Sister Act" in 1992.

Born in New York City, he founded Compton-Ardolino Films with Gardner Compton in 1967.
