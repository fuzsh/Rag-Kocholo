Directed by Emile Ardolino, 1 hr. 40 min., PG, comedy/family/music\n\nWhen a nightclub singer is forced to take refuge from the mob in a convent, she ends up turning the convent choir into a soulful chorus complete with a Motown repertoire. The sudden celebrity of the choir jeopardizes her identity.\n\nSister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993). Directed by Bill Duke, 1 hr. 47 min., PG, comedy/family/music\n\nShowgirl Deloris Van Cartier returns as Sister Mary Clarence to teach music to a group of Catholic students whose run-down school is slated for closure.\n\nWhere do I park? Can I bring my dog? How about picnics? What happens if it rains? For answers to these questions and others, see the 2024 Outdoor Film Policies and FAQ.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThese films include open captioning.
