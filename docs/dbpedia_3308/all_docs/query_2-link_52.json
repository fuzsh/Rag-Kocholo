He began his career as an actor in off-Broadway productions, and then moved to the production side of the business. In 1967, he founded Compton-Ardolino Films with Gardner Compton. In the 1970s and 1980s, Ardolino worked for PBS. His profiles of dancers and choreographers for their Dance in America and Live from Lincoln Center series earned him 17 Emmy Award nominations and three Emmy wins. Ardolino won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for the 1983 movie He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin’. He found commercial success with the Oscar-winning 1987 hit Dirty Dancing and made several mainstream films, including Sister Act (1992) and the TV production of Gypsy (1993) starring Bette Midler.\n\nSee our upcoming films\n\nMAJOR SUPPORT\n\nOhio Arts Council\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nThe Columbus Foundation\n\nCampus Partners\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts"
