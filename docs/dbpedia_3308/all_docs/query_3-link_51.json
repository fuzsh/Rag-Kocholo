        "text": "UPDATE, with video: Whoopi Goldberg has made no secret in recent years of people she’d like to cast in her long-in-the-works Sister Act 3 project, from original Sister costars Jenifer Lewis and Kathy Najimy to Jimmy Fallon, Charlamagne Tha God, Lizzo, Keke Palmer, and Nicki Minaj, and today she added another old friend to the list: Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nRalph, who appeared in 1993’s Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, seemed delighted if perhaps too overwhelmed with emotion to give an official answer when, during an appearance on today’s The View, Goldberg invited the Abbott Elementary star to take part in both a planned View reunion of Sister Act vets and the hoped-for second sequel to the original 1992 comedy.\n\n“You know, we’re in the process of putting together 3,” Goldberg said toward the end of Ralph’s visit. “Will you come be part of it, whatever it is?”\n\nRalph was moved to tears by the offer, which came just after Goldberg invited her to take part in a planned Sister Act reunion on The View.\n\n“We’re going to try to get as many cast members on to share memories from the movie,” Goldberg said. “Would you do us the honor of coming back? And as soon as we know when it is, we’ll do that.”\n\nLast October, Goldberg visited St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City and met Pope Francis, teasing the trip as groundwork for Sister Act 3. “Maybe, since you’re seeing everything, you’re figuring out what I’m doing here,” Goldberg said in an Instagram video, “but picture Sister Act and all the nuns standing here, waiting for the Pope to come out. Maybe that’s going to happen in the new movie. You don’t know. You never know, but we are in Rome, and I am in Vatican City. What could I be doing? Why could I be here? We’ll find out.”\n\nIn 2022, Tyler Perry, lined up as a producer on 3, visited The View, saying of the possible Disney+ project, “I love the idea of us making this happen but you know, the Hollywood system moves a little slower than I’d like to. So we’ve got a good script. We’re off to a great start. We’re just trying to get everybody moving in the right direction so we can get it going.”\n\nThe View airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET on ABC."
