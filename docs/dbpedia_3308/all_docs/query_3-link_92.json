        "text": "Sister Mary Clarence was back in the habit for a 30th anniversary celebration of “Sister Act 2.”\n\nWhoopi Goldberg seamlessly shifted back into her starring role in the movie for a reunion performance on “The View” Wednesday (see video below).\n\nGoldberg, in full costume, joined members of the cast for renditions of “Oh Happy Day” and “Joyful, Joyful,” both memorable songs from the film.\n\nNew Jersey’s Ryan Toby, who made his film debut in the movie as high school student Westley Glen “Ahmal” James, delivered a rousing solo in “Oh Happy Day.”\n\nToby, a singer-songwriter and producer who hails from Willingboro, would go on to success in the early 2000s with his hip-hop and R&B group City High (”What Would You Do?” and “Caramel”).\n\n“This was the first thing I ever auditioned for,” he said of the film during the reunion on “The View.”\n\nGoldberg, a “View” host and EGOT winner, lives in Llewellyn Park, West Orange. She played Deloris Van Cartier, a lounge singer who goes into hiding as a nun as part of the witness protection program in the first “Sister Act,” directed by Emile Ardolino and released in 1992.\n\nThe sequel, “Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit,” directed by Bill Duke, was released in December 1993.\n\n“I cannot believe it’s been 30 years since this heaven-sent bunch made lightning strike twice in the sequel I was blessed to be part of,” Goldberg said on the show Wednesday. She was visibly emotional after the performance of “Joyful, Joyful.”\n\nThe movie starred a young Lauryn Hill in a breakout role as Rita Louise Watson, a musically gifted high school student and Emmy winner Sheryl Lee Ralph (”Abbott Elementary”) as Rita’s mother, Florence Watson.\n\nHill was not a part of the reunion performance, but Ralph participated in a joint cast interview on “The View.”\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt also appears as the teen Margaret in “Sister Act 2,” and made a remote video appearance in the reunion show alongside several other actors.\n\nBoth Kathy Najimy, who participated in “The View” reunion, and Oscar winner Maggie Smith returned for the sequel from the first “Sister Act” as Sister Mary Patrick and Reverend Mother, respectively.\n\nSo did Wendy Makkena (who joined Najimy, Ralph and Goldberg for the reunion), who played sister Mary Robert, and Mary Wickes, who played Sister Mary Lazarus (she died in 1995).\n\nGoldberg’s own daughter, Alex Martin, was a part of the cast of the “Sister Act” sequel and joined them for the reunion.\n\nGrammy, Emmy and Tony-winning composer Marc Shaiman, who grew up in Scotch Plains and was the music supervisor on “Sister Act 2,” also appeared on “The View.”\n\nGoldberg has said she will return as Deloris Van Cartier for a “Sister Act 3″ in development at Disney+.\n\nDisney confirmed the project in 2020, with Tyler Perry and Goldberg attached as producers.\n\nGoldberg can currently be seen in the movie “Ezra,” set and filmed in New Jersey.\n\nStories by Amy Kuperinsky\n\nWatch Tom Cruise jump-start Olympics handoff to Los Angeles, ‘Mission: Impossible’ style\n\nBreaking legend Crazy Legs says viral Olympics dancer Raygun should’ve never competed\n\nCeline Dion slams Trump, Vance for using her music and likeness. ‘THAT song?’\n\nThank you for reading.
