        "text": "Dirty Dancing is a 1987 musical and romance film set in 1963, in which a teenage girl crosses over into womanhood both physically and emotionally, through a relationship with a dance instructor during a family summer vacation.\n\nDirected by Emile Ardolino. Written by Eleanor Bergstein.\n\nHave The Time Of Your Life!taglines\n\nJohnny Castle\n\n[edit]\n\nLook, spaghetti arms. This is my dance space. This is your dance space. I don't go into yours, you don't go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.\n\nNobody puts Baby in a corner.\n\nNote: ranked #98 in the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 movie quotations in American cinema.\n\nSorry about the disruption, folks, but I always do the last dance of the season. This year somebody told me not to. So I'm gonna do my kind of dancin' with a great partner, who's not only a terrific dancer. Somebody who's taught me that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. Somebody who's taught me about the kind of person I wanna be. Miss Frances Houseman.\n\nFrances \"Baby\" Houseman\n\n[edit]\n\n[voiceover] That was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me \"Baby\", and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellermans.\n\n[when she sneaks into the employees-only party] I carried a watermelon. [realizes what she just said] I carried a watermelon?\n\nOh, yes, as a matter of fact it is. We're supposed to do the show in two days, you won't show me the lifts, I'm not sure of the turns, I'm doing all this to save your ass, what I really want to do is drop you on it!\n\n[to her father] I told you I was telling the truth, Daddy. I'm sorry I lied to you, but you lied too. You told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break. But you meant everyone who was like you. You told me you wanted me to change the world, to make it better. But you meant by becoming a lawyer or a Doctor and marrying someone from Harvard. I'm not proud of myself, but I'm in this family too. You can't keep giving me the silent treatment. There are a lot of things about me that aren't what you thought. But if you love me, you have to love all the things about me, and I love you. I'm sorry I let you down; I'm so sorry, Daddy. But you let me down too.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nNeil Kellerman: I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.\n\nBaby Houseman: Maybe my parents are looking for me.\n\nNeil Kellerman: Baby, don't worry. If they think you're with me, they'll be the happiest parents at Kellerman's. I have to say it. I'm known as the catch of the county.\n\nBaby Houseman: I'm sure you are.\n\nNeil Kellerman: Only last week, I took a girl away from Jamie, the lifeguard. And he said to her, right in front of me, \"What does he have that I don't have?\" And she said, \"Two hotels\".\n\nBaby Houseman: Johnny, I came here because my father-\n\nJohnny Castle: No, I mean the way he saved her. I mean, I.... I could never do anything like that. That was somethin'. The reason people treat me like I'm nothin' is cause I'm nothin'.\n\nBaby Houseman: That's not true! You- You're everything!\n\nJohnny Castle: You don't understand the way it is, I mean for somebody like me. Last month, I'm eating Jujubes to keep alive, and this month, women are stuffing diamonds in my pocket, I'm balancing on shit as quick as that, [clicks his fingers] I could be down there again.\n\nBaby Houseman: No, it's not the way it is! It doesn't have to be that way.\n\nJohnny Castle: I've never known anyone like you before. You think you can make the world better. Somebody's lost, you find them. Somebody's bleeding-\n\nBaby Houseman: Yeah, I go get my daddy. That was really brave, like you said.\n\nJohnny Castle: That took a lot of guts to go to him! You are not scared of anything.\n\nBaby Houseman: Me? I'm scared of everything! I'm scared of what I saw. I'm scared of what I did, of who I am. And most of all, I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life.... the way I feel when I'm with you!\n\nBaby Houseman: Have you had many women?\n\nJohnny Castle: What? [laughs]\n\nBaby Houseman: Have you had many women?\n\nJohnny Castle: Come on, Baby.\n\nBaby Houseman: Come on. I want to know.\n\nJohnny Castle: No, no. [jumps out of bed and Baby smiles at him] Look, you've gotta understand what it's like, Baby: you come from the streets and suddenly you're up here, and these women are throwing themselves at ya, and they smell so good, and they really take care of themselves, [getting dressed] I mean, I never knew women could be like that, you know? And they're so rich, they're so goddamn rich, you think they must know about everything. And they're slipping their room keys in my hands, two and three times day, different women. So here I think I'm scoring big, and for a while you think, hey, they wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care about me, right?\n\nBaby Houseman: That's all right, I understand. You were just using them, that's all. [looks depressed]\n\nJohnny Castle: No, no, that's not it. That's the thing, see, Baby, it wasn't like that, they were using me.\n\n[Baby kisses Johnny and they fall back on to their bed]\n\nJohnny Castle: What's your real name, Baby?\n\nBaby Houseman: Frances. For the first woman in the cabinet. [laughs]\n\nJohnny Castle: Frances. That's a real grown up name.\n\nJohnny Castle: [talking about Neil] That little wimp. He wouldn't know a new idea if it hit him in the Pachenga. He wanted some new ideas? I could've *told* him some new ideas!\n\nBaby Houseman: Well, why did you let him talk to you that way?\n\nJohnny Castle: What do you mean, and fight the bossman?\n\nBaby Houseman: Yeah, tell him your ideas! He's a person like everyone else. I'm sure he'll think they're great.\n\nJohnny Castle: Look, I know these people, Baby. They're all rich and they're mean. They won't listen to me.\n\nBaby Houseman: Well, then why not fight harder? Make them listen?\n\nJohnny Castle: Because, I need this goddamn job lined up for next summer! [chuckles scornfully] My dad calls me today, he says - with good news - you know, he says, \"Uncle Paul can finally get you in the union.\"\n\nBaby Houseman: Oh, what-what union?\n\nJohnny Castle: The House Painters and Plasterers, local number 179, at your service.\n\n[Baby's father, sister, and Robbie come out of the house next to the trail; Baby pulls Johnny down so they won't see them together]\n\nLisa Houseman: I've been thinking a lot about the Domino Theory. Now, when Vietnam falls, is China next?\n\n[the trio passes]\n\nBaby Houseman: I don't think they saw us.\n\nJohnny Castle: [getting up] Fight harder, huh? I don't see you fighting so hard, Baby. I don't see you running up to daddy telling him I'm your guy.\n\nBaby Houseman: I will. With my father, it's complicated. I will tell him, I...\n\nJohnny Castle: I don't believe you, Baby! I don't think that you ever had any intention of telling him. Ever. [stalks off]\n\nJake Houseman: [about Penny's illegal abortion] Was that what my money paid for?\n\nBaby Houseman: I'm sorry. I never meant to lie to you.\n\nJake Houseman: You're not the person I thought you were. I'm not sure who you are. But I don't want you to have anything to do with those people again.\n\nBaby Houseman: But, Daddy, can I just explain?\n\nJake Houseman: Nothing! You're to have nothing to do with any of them ever again! I won't tell your mother about this, right now I'm going to bed. And take that stuff off your face before your mother sees you!\n\nJake Houseman: Don't you tell me what to see! I see someone in front of me who got his partner in trouble and sent her off to some butcher, while he moved on to an innocent young girl like my daughter!\n\n[silence]\n\nJohnny Castle: [angry] Yeah, I guess that's what you would see.\n\nBaby Houseman: [finding out the Schumacher's were guilty of stealing the wallets] So then - so then it's all right! I knew it would work out. I knew they'd have to apologize...\n\nJohnny Castle: [shrugs her off] I'm out, Baby.\n\nBaby Houseman: They fired you anyway because of me!\n\nJohnny Castle: And if I leave quietly, I'll get my summer bonus.\n\nBaby Houseman: So I did it for nothing. I hurt my family, you lost your job anyway! I did it for nothing!\n\nJohnny Castle: No, not for nothing, Baby! Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before!\n\nBaby Houseman: You were right, Johnny. You can't win no matter what you do!\n\nJohnny Castle: You listen to me; I don't want to hear that from you, you can!\n\nBaby Houseman: I used to think so.\n\nJake Houseman: [Jake gives Robbie a letter of recommendation for medical school] Good luck in medical school, son.\n\nRobbie Gould: I wanted to thank you for your help with the Penny situation. I guess we've all gotten into messes.\n\nJake Houseman: What?\n\nRobbie Gould: I thought Baby told you. Look, I'm not sure. Penny said so, but you know with girls like that. They're liable to pin it... on any guy around.\n\n[Jake snatches the letter back from Robbie]\n\nJake Houseman: I know you weren't the one who got Penny in trouble.\n\nJohnny Castle: Yeah.\n\nJake Houseman: When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong. [to Baby] You looked wonderful out there.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nHave The Time Of Your Life\n\nFirst dance. First love.
