        "text": "This convent is a hit! Whoopi Goldberg plays a nightclub singer in her signature role who witnesses a murder and has to hide from the gangsters in a convent. There she teaches the nun's choir how to swing and drives the criminals to forgiveness. Sister Act, heavenly fun full of exuberant gags, delicious situation comedy and music that makes the church shake! \"Dirty Dancing\" director Emile Ardolino and an outstanding Whoopi Goldberg guarantee a comedy full of life, heart-warming humor and excitement. A turbulent movie where the fun just keeps getting bigger."
