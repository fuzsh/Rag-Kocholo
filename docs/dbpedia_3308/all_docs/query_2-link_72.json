        "text": "Dirty Dancing, Back to the Future and E. T. have been crowned as the greatest films of the 80s. The 1987 classic Dirty Dancing, featuring Patrick Swayze, bagged 12 awards post its release, including an Academy Award for best music.\n\nA survey of 2,000 adults revealed that 43% reckon that the era of big hair and legwarmers was the golden age of filmmaking. Top Gun, Die Hard and The Terminator also made it into the top 10 list. Meanwhile, one in 10 (9%) rate Raiders of the Lost Ark among the best flicks from that decade.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise were voted as the most iconic 80s stars. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Ridley Scott were named as the most influential directors of the decade.\n\nA spokesperson for Lottoland.co.uk, which commissioned the research to celebrate its range of retro games, said: \"80s movies have some serious nostalgia power. Many of the films on the list are popular with younger people who weren't even around in the decade, and we're even seeing the clothes and music coming back around now which I never thought I'd witness again.\"\n\n\"It goes to show how truly iconic the 80s were, and I'm sure it's one of the reasons our vintage games are becoming so popular, they take you back to a time of big hair and even bigger movies.\"\n\nThe study discovered that a third (33%) of respondents believe E. T. should be remade, while 22% would welcome a modern version of The Goonies. The 2022 remake of Top Gun (Maverick) was deemed almost as good as the original by 16% of those surveyed. However, only 3% thought the 2011 release of Footloose matched up to the 1984 classic.\n\nPerhaps this is why 35% have encouraged their children to watch films from the 80s. A significant 66% are passionate about preserving films from this era for future generations, with six in 10 stating 'they don't make films like they used to'. Over half (52%) even wish they could turn back time and relive the 80s, according to OnePoll's statistics.\n\nA spokesperson for Lottoland commented: \"It's great to see how many people want to keep their favourite classics alive and even encourage their own kids to watch them. And for those one in five people who wanted a Goonies remake, our own Goonies-themed game might be right up your alley.\"\n\nTOP 40 BEST FILMS FROM THE 80S.\n\n1. \"Dirty Dancing\" (1987) - Directed by Emile Ardolino.\n\n2. \"Back to the Future\" (1985) - Directed by Robert Zemeckis.\n\n3. \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982) - Directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\n4. \"Top Gun\" (1986) - Directed by Tony Scott.\n\n5. \"Die Hard\" (1988) - Directed by John McTiernan.\n\n6. \"The Terminator\" (1984) - Directed by James Cameron.\n\n7. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) - Directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\n8. \" Star Wars : Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) - Directed by Irvin Kershner.\n\n9. \"Ghostbusters\" (1984) - Directed by Ivan Reitman.\n\n10. \"Aliens\" (1986) - Directed by James Cameron.\n\n11. \"The Goonies\" (1985) - Directed by Richard Donner.\n\n12. \"The Shining\" (1980) - Directed by Stanley Kubrick.\n\n13. \"Rain Man\" (1988) - Directed by Barry Levinson.\n\n14. \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989) - Directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\n15. \"Airplane! \" (1980) - Directed by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker.\n\n16. \"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" (1983) Directed by George Lucas.\n\n17. \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980) - Directed by John Landis.\n\n18. \"Blade Runner\" (1982) - Directed by Ridley Scott.\n\n19. \"Fatal Attraction\" (1987) - Directed by Adrian Lyne.\n\n20. \"Gremlins\" (1984) - Directed by Joe Dante.\n\n21. \"The Karate Kid\" (1984) - Directed by John G.
