        "text": "Based on the smash hit film, Sister Act is a heavenly musical comedy that proves nothing can stand in the way of sisterhood! Disco diva Deloris dreams of fame and fortune, but is she prepared for the way she receives it? Songs inspired by Motown, soul and disco, including “Take Me to Heaven,” “Fabulous, Baby!,” and “Raise Your Voice,” this score is sure to raise your spirits. The grand finale to the Muny season promises to be divine!\n\nRatings and age restrictions are not issued for The Muny’s professionally-licensed productions, but we understand that sensitivities vary from person to person. For this reason, The Muny offers the following script content categories that may have a bearing on patron comfort.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe words damn and hell are used.\n\nSexual Innuendo\n\nA few lines of dialogue and several song lyrics contain mild, comical references to sex.\n\nDrugs and Alcohol\n\nSeveral song lyrics or lines of dialogue mention drugs or alcohol. A character smokes a cigarette onstage.\n\nViolence\n\nDeloris witnesses a murder at the beginning of the first act, which is the catalyzing event for the rest of the show. In Deloris’ quest to escape the murderer and his gang of thugs, this motley crew sings a song about finding and killing her, holds others at gunpoint and exchanges more gunfire. The suspense doesn’t end until the second act finale.\n\nMature Content\n\nSeveral lines of dialogue contain mature content, such as references to hookers, drag queens and addicts."
