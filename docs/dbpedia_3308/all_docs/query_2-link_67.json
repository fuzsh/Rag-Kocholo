        "text": "Jennifer Grey\n\nJennifer Grey is most known for her role playing Baby in the 1987 movie Dirty Dancing, which led to a Golden Globe nomination. She transitioned from Hollywood to television after her film career dried up. She attributed this a lot to her having undergone rhinoplasty which lead to a drastic change in her appearance and “came out anonymous. It was like being in a witness protection program or being invisible.\" Nonetheless, she has still had success in the dancing show Dancing with the Stars, which she won in 2010. She most recently star in the medical TV drama, Grey’s Anatomy, as Carol Dickinson.\n\nCynthia Rhodes\n\nCynthia Rhodes is most known for her role playing Penny, Johnny’s dance partner who becomes pregnant, in the 1987 movie Dirty Dancing. She does not have much of a filmography history but has starred as a dancer in numerous music videos, such as “The Woman in You\" by the Bee Gees, and \"Don't Mean Nothing\" by Richard Marx, whom she went on to marry.\n\nPatrick Swayze\n\nPatrick Swayze is most well-known for his role as Johnny Castle in the 1987 movie, Dirty Dancing, which lead him to have a rich film history in the 90’s. He starred in the 1990 film, Ghost, as Sam Wheat, alongside notable actors Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. He has also starred across Keanu Reeves in the 1991 action movie Point Break. His career dwindled from Hollywood into television in the early 2000s. He unfortunately died in 2009 after a long battle with health problems."
