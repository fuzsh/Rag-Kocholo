I love the tension between her and Maggie Smith’s character, these two need more screen time together! It’s just a good movie, funny in places although not laugh out loud, really, and with some good songs. Although, My Guy being changed to My God is stuck in my head something chronic now.

No drugs!... No way!\n\nDeloris Van Cartier is a sassy lounge singer forced to hide out from the mob in the last place they'd expect to look - a quiet religious convent. There, her irreverent behaviour attracts a flock of faithful followers - and before long, she turns the nuns' tone-deaf choir into a soulful chorus of swingin', singing sisters. After earning great reviews, sudden celebrity jeopardises her hidden identity.\n\nLive blog\n\nTime Comment 4:05 This is the weirdest medley of songs ever. 8:10 Purple mink is a choice. 13:23 I can’t climb a ladder at the best of times, let alone in high heeled boots. 17:34 Dame Maggie! 18:44 “These are holy people, they like everybody.” Hmmm. 28:16 It is weird that they call their rooms a cell. 33:01 “We miss her so… dead or alive.” 41:43 Nun walks into a bar… 51:59 “We call that an A with an attitude.” 58:26 The pigeons on the window are annoying me. 1:04:09 Haha, being on TV when you’re supposed to be keeping a low profile. 1:15:28 “That’s what Diana Ross said!” 1:27:18 “Try to blend in,” she says to the nuns in a casino. 1:32:32 Bless YOU.\n\nThoughts\n\nThis is another movie that I’ve seen before a long time ago, but I really couldn’t remember anything about it.
