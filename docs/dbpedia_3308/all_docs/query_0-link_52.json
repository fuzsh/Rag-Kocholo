        "text": "Part of Music City Mondays\n\nDeloris Van Cartier is a Reno lounge singer who accidentally witnesses a brutal murder carried out by her gangster boyfriend Vince. Under instruction from a detective who’s trying to bring down Vince’s criminal operation, Deloris is placed in protective custody at a San Francisco convent. Masquerading as a nun renamed Sister Mary Clarence, Deloris shakes up the established order of the sisters’ lives, particularly enlivening their choral efforts. Although running constantly afoul of the Mother Superior, the new, jazzed-up musical act becomes a huge hit in the community, even drawing the attention of the Pope, while also alerting Vince to Deloris’ whereabouts."
