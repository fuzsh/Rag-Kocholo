        "text": "Whoopi Goldberg is picking up her Sister Act habit once more. Thirty years after the original 1992 film and its sequel Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, released the following year, plans for Sister Act 3 are in motion. The project was first announced back in 2020 as a Disney+ release with Tyler Perry producing and Goldberg reprising her role of lounge singer turned singing nun Deloris Van Trier.\n\nSince then, Goldberg has provided occasional updates on the film via her day job at The View. In September, Perry shared a status update during a guest appearance. “I love the idea of us making this happen, but you know the Hollywood system moves a little slower than I’d like to,” he said. Goldberg said that it had “taken 20 years” to get a sequel off the ground, adding, “They were sort of lukewarm for the longest time [about making the movie], they said nobody wanted to see it and then Tyler went in and said, ‘I want to see it.’ Next thing I knew, we were on. That’s the power of TP.”\n\nIn October, she credited the success of Hocus Pocus 2, another ‘90s classic that got a long-awaited Disney+ follow-up, with making Sister Act 3 happen. While speaking to guest and franchise co-star Kathy Najimy, Goldberg confirmed that the movie “is happening” and that they’d be “getting a script at the end of the month.” She added, “They finally said, ‘We might as well put those nuns back out there and see if they have any juice.”\n\nWho is in Sister Act 3?\n\nTim Federle (High School Musical: The Musical: The Series) has been tapped to direct the film with a script from Madhuri Shekar (The Nevers), as reported by Deadline in 2021. What’s still unknown is just which sisters will be cast alongside Goldberg. During a recent View appearance, Jenifer Lewis said she was “so ready” to rejoin the franchise, and Keke Palmer publicly asked for a role in the film while on the show in November 2021. Goldberg affirmed her desire for Palmer to join the convent in an episode of Hell of A Week with Charlamagne Tha God. She then named Lizzo and Nicki Minaj as other potential musically-gifted nuns she'd love to see in the movie.\n\nMore recently, Goldberg lobbied for Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon to make a cameo while appearing on his show. “The script came in yesterday,” she told the host. “I really like it but it has a whole lot of adults to go through. So, if they don’t get in its way, it could actually be pretty good.” Goldberg then asked Fallon if he’d drop by for “a day” to film a scene or two. “Yes! Are you kidding me? To be in Sister Act 3?” he replied. “Of course, I would do that, I would do anything for you.”\n\nLess assured is that Dame Maggie Smith, who played the steely Mother Superior in the first two movies, will reprise her role for a third film. But that won’t stop Goldberg from attempting to make it happen. During a guest appearance on the British talk show Loose Women, Goldberg made her case to the fellow Oscar winner for getting back in the habit. “One of the things that I want to make sure I do while I’m here is I want to let Maggie Smith know that I’m holding the part of Mother Superior for you,” she said to the camera. “Because I just can’t do it with anybody but you.”\n\nGoldberg then promised that if Smith wasn’t able to relocate for filming, the production would go to her. “So if you need me to come over here and shoot it and do whatever we have to do, we will do whatever you want us to do,” she continued. “Because we don’t want to do it without you, Maggie.”\n\nWhen is Sister Act 3 coming out?\n\nWhile the official release date and title remain sacred, an IMDB page for the movie labels it Sister Act 3: Kicking the Habit and features a fanmade poster with Goldberg, Palmer, and—oddly enough—Bette Midler (who was originally envisioned for the role of Deloris) listed as the stars. Palmer subsequently tweeted the poster, writing, “God bless y’all for this manifestation over my life. @WaltDisneyCo, this is what they asked for I’m just here to relay.”\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nStyle\n\nIf J.D. Vance’s Spotify Account Is Real, Well, It’s On-Brand\n\nHis political views put him outside of the Millennial mainstream, but the 39-year-old VP nominee might have music tastes that place him firmly in the early 2010s.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump Was Totally Not Being Serious When He Suggested He’s Going to Appoint Himself President for Life: Republicans\n\nThis is a guy who loves democracy, after all.\n\nMovies\n\nIs a Britney Spears Biopic Officially in the Works?\n\nWicked producer and director duo Marc Platt and Jon M. Chu are reportedly attached to helm the film for Universal.\n\nPolitics\n\nCan Kamala Harris Make Joe Biden’s Campaign Her Own?\n\nThe vice president has inherited her boss’s sprawling 1,300-person campaign apparatus. Some insiders are worried that Harris needs stronger allies. “She basically has Biden’s team right now,” one says. “She needs some people in that room who are her people.”\n\nPolitics\n\nWhy Silicon Valley Elites Have Trump Fever All Over Again\n\nYears after breaking with the former president, billionaires like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen are now crawling back to protect what they value most: their bottom lines."
