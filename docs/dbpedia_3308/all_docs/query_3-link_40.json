        "text": "Part-Time Review: Sister Act (1992)\n\nOverall Grade: B+\n\nSister Act was a surprise comedy hit in 1992 and one of my favorite VHS films as a young kid; I watching and re-watched those musical numbers over and over. It's an extremely easy to watch comedy featuring memorable musical numbers and a career best performance from Whoopi Goldberg. For anyone growing up at the time of this review in 2023 it might be hard to think about Whoopi helming a comedy musical since she has become more of a political figure on The View in her later years. In 1992 however, Whoopi was at the height of her Hollywood powers coming off a thriving stand-up comedy routine and an Oscar winning performance in Ghost two years earlier. I think Sister Act represents the peak of her film career, headlining a real comedy blockbuster, with an iconic comedic performance.\n\nIn Sister Act, Whoopi plays a Reno singer named Deloris doing montages of R&B and Motown songs. Life’s not going well as her singing act gets little notice from the Casino patrons and her gangster boyfriend Vince (Harvey Keitel) won’t leave his wife. To make things worse, Deloris accidentally witnesses said boyfriend execute someone and she is forced to run to the cops. The cops, wanting to make a slam-dunk case against a big gangster, convince Deloris to hide out in the last place Vince would look for her, a San Francisco convent as a nun. The convent is run by the Mother Superior, which is my first experience with the great actress Maggie Smith and her ability to play a cold and stiff character that’s still able to garner great empathy and show intelligence and warmth. This resulting change in life for Deloris, ahem Sister Mary Clarence now, provides lots of opportunities for some fish out of water comedy bits. Whoopi really shines here, bringing her privileged lounge singer attitude to prayer, dinner, convent work, and fellowship with the other sisters. Two other nuns get shining supporting turns here, Kathy Najimy as Sister Mary Patrick and Wendy Makkena as Sister Mary Roberts (who I had a big crush on as a kid). The two nuns welcome Mary Clarence with understanding and patience. Their curiosity and empathy for her differences eventually work to soothe Mary Clarence’s difficulty with her temporary nun life.\n\nIf this was just a fish out of water comedy with Goldberg adjusting to convent life then it would still be a good comedy. However, the film takes its characters and premise seriously, giving the convent and its inhabitants time to feel like a real place and filled with real human beings. Additionally, about halfway through the film, there’s a nice little genre twist as Mother Superior tasks Mary Clarence with singing in the church’s horrible choir. It’s not long before Mary Clarence takes charge of the choir and shapes them up into a better singing group, adding a bit of her Reno/Motown glamour to their repertoire in the meantime. When the newly reformed choir performs “Hail Holy Queen” for the first time in a church service it's just magic. It also happens to be one of my favorite musical numbers of all-time.\n\nThe performance begins by singing through the song just as a traditional choir would and the impressed priest and sisters in the pews give their nodding approval of the sudden change in quality. Then Whoopi, who is up on stage conducting the group, motions for a the girls to kick into the upbeat and poppy second rendition of the song. The women's choir begin to clap, sway, and sing with such happiness that it becomes infectious to the viewer. The camera zooms around the church stage and choir while each of our main side characters get their own little moments in the song to match their natures: older Sister Mary Lazarus who Whoopi took the reins from gets her own little fun run in the song, Sister Mary Patrick gets a bubbly and joyful beat, and in my favorite little bit, Sister Mary Robert gets to let her small and shy frame showcase her power vocals to her own surprise. As they hit the final run, Whoopi, who has begun unlocking the true potential of all these women, is conducting with such verve, attitude, and physical gyration that it’s hard not to watch without a giant smile on your face. The rocking music makes its way into the streets and begins to bring in people to the empty pews.\n\nThe entire musical number showcases the heart of the film so well – Deloris’ musical talents being used to help raise up others and bring in people who otherwise wouldn’t darken the door of a church. The “Reno” style music brings Deloris into conflict with Mother Superior of course, but thankfully this isn’t played as hard as it could since the movie really isn’t deep enough to genuinely handle a theological discussion of what’s appropriate for worship music. Thankfully and wisely, the argument becomes more a vehicle for the theme of the sisters getting out of the convent walls and connecting with the people they are meant to minister to. It's a legitimate concern though that the story largely ignores the content of the religious music and its intent. It's a less of a problem for this film since they have painted all of the sisters as earnest and rightly motivated in their vows, but it becomes a serious issue in the sequel with students who aren't so committed to a Christian life; but I digress.\n\nThe last act of the film is meant to climax with a rocking choir performance, led by Mary Clarence, in front of the visiting Pope. Unfortunately, Deloris is discovered by her gangster boyfriend, kidnapped, and brought back to Reno to be killed before she testifies. The rest of the nuns, despite learning of Mary Clarence's subterfuge, band together and head to Reno to rescue Deloris. The police follow close behind and after a fun little chase sequence through Reno casinos, premised on the entire idea that a group of nuns in casinos is funny and they are kinda right, ends with Maggie Smith's Mother Superior giving a heartfelt plea that Deloris has changed and become a loving nun. Once rescued by the police, Deloris heads back to the convent with the rest of the nuns for the final musical performance of \"I Will Follow Him\" (meaning God in this rendition) in front of the Pope.\n\nIt's a bit difficult to point to any one sequence in the film as a standout comedy moment; this isn't a film of gut busting set pieces or one-liners (though there are memorable funny lines). The best way I can describe the joy of Sister Act is that it's optimism and positivity makes it so easy to watch and re-watch. It would be easy to strawman the Catholic setting, or take constant shots at the nuns, but that's not the kind of film it is. It's an accessible story based on a funny premise, filled up with diverse/ likeable characters, an earnest theme, surprisingly great musical numbers, and a star comedic performance from Whoopi Goldberg. These kind of likeable comedies are pretty rare and should be celebrated and remembered. Give it a view if you've never seen it before.\n\nOverall Grade: B+\n\nBest Action Scenes of All-Time: Jackie Chan - All the Rest\n\n*Last Updated 8/27/2023 Click Here for the Top Ten Essential Jackie Chan Action Sequences Click Here for a Guide to All of Jackie Chan's Films Click Here for the Top Ten Essential Jackie Chan Films (Coming Soon) If you have found yourself at this page, then that must mean you more than a passing interest in Jackie Chan or in action cinema.

Unlike John McClane, I was never partial to Roy Rogers over John Wayne or Clint Eastwood - mostly because I didn't really care about any of them. My Dad enjoyed Eastwood films, but they never made that much sense to me. By the time I was a kid, the American Western was on the decline. If you wanted to see \"great action\" when I was growing up, you turned to James Bond , Indiana Jones , Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme , or if you were lucky enough to be in the know - Hong Kong cinema ! It hasn't been until I began researching for this particular list in my action scene series that I've come to a greater appreciation of this genre. Still, for an action junkie like me, the Western genre isn't the first (or the second or third) genre I think about when it come\n\nWWII Film Guide: Naval Warfare\n\n*Last Updated: 1/1/2024 *This post is part of a film guide on World War II.

I knew him well the lad was me and now I cannot find him. Away, away, away he went, in deep and salty water.\" The theme seems to stir up something in the listener and touch that strange and mystical connection humans have had with the sea for thousands of years. It reminds me a bit of the mysteriously affective opening shot of the dark and deep ocean in Titanic . Our naval vessels may traverse the giant sea, but seem to do so only by leave of the ocean; a permission that can be rescinded at any given moment. The sea makes us feel small. The sea reminds humans that we are not in control. Our ships are little floating islands of civilization in a va"
