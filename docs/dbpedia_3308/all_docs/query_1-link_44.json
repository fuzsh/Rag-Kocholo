        "text": "Dancing is an inseparable part of life, thus it is often shown in movies with themes relating to different things. The movie Dirty Dancing clearly illustrates people’s need and want to dance. It was produced by Linda Gottlieb and directed by Emile Ardolino. The movie came out in year 1987 and became an immediate hit at the box office. Patrick Swayze played the major role which was one of the reasons for the great success of the movie. The movie came out in color and was watched at home in a family setting.\n\nThe plot revolves around a girl who is becoming more mature and falls in love with her dance instructor. As he is older than her, she learns a lot from him about life. She gets valuable life experience and develops her skills as a dancer. Even though the style of dancing can be thought of as provocative or “dirty”, nonetheless, it absorbs the audiences and does not stop to surprise the viewers. The story unexpectedly develops, as there is emotional intensity between the two people who were not allowed to be together. The talent show leads to the two characters becoming even closer, and uniting in the most emotional way.\n\nThe action is taking place in several settings, at home, the dance studio, outside and in a club. The depiction is rather realistic, as the viewer can feel the atmosphere of each place. The setting is able to transfer over the mood of the story and adds to the emotional bond between the characters. It looks very enchanting and can raise the mood and make it light or depress it and have a negative influence on the psyche of a person. A dance only exists while it is made which makes it a particularly special experience. Every part of a person seems to be doing its separate dance but altogether, it creates a unit where the center is the emotion and connection to a higher force.\n\nThe movie was very enjoyable because dancing was shown to be a form of theatre that comes to life through an emotional performance. It was a show between the certain music style, illusory dancing and acting. The gestures and the emotion on the character’s face were authentic and heartfelt. This means that a person becomes connected with the movie in the closest way. The representation of the spirit was emotional and personal. Also, the movie was great because for each particular type of activity there was a specific dance. Even though a single person can perform a dance and hypnotize the audience, when a couple is performing, it is much different. Even when dancers turn away from each other, they are able to perform the exact same movements.\n\nOverall, the movie was a great representation of dance and human relationships. The dancers have kept their characters real and at the same time, mysterious. It became an important part of the culture, as the future generations continue to respect the film and its themes. The climax was satisfying while the viewers’ interest in the movie was present throughout the movie. The film could have been made better by having more dance scenes which reflected emotion and people’s life. I would recommend the movie to others, as it is a pleasant illustration of dance and human relationships."
