        "text": "Goldberg has been pretty open about her longtime efforts to make this sequel a reality. She told Entertainment Tonight, \"I've been trying to do this for six years. I was told no one was interested in this. It takes a minute for people to realize they should take their foot out of their mouth.\"\n\n\"It's coming. We gotta shoot it, but it's happening,\" she added. \"You're never fully happy with a script because one of the things you find is you wanna have the space to make an adjustment if you need to. Sometimes what looks right on paper doesn't come out of your mouth the right way. You have to move it around a little bit, but I'm very hopeful people will be happy.\"\n\nDuring her virtual appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2020, she said, “For a long time, they kept saying no one wanted to see it. And then quite recently, it turns out, that that may not be true. People may want to see it. So we're working diligently to try to figure out how to get the gang together and come back.\"\n\nShe added, \"It's a really fun movie. It's fun and it's feel-good, you know, nobody's mad. It's just like, listen, bad singing, great singing, okay singing and then nuns. What's better than that?\"\n\nIt sounds like the third installment will share the same, feel-good tone of the first two films. Perry told The Hollywood Reporter in October 2021, “Whoopi’s really excited. I think that this is just what the country needs. We need that feel-good moment in the movies where you go, ‘Oh, my God, I left there singing.’ That’s my hope.”\n\nSo far, Disney has confirmed that Goldberg will return as the leading lady. And while chatting with Variety in 2021, Goldberg teased that a few familiar faces from the first two films might return. She said, “Marc Shaiman [the franchise’s composer] is just waiting. The nuns are all waiting. Maybe there’s gonna be some of the kids [from Sister Act 2]. Who can say?”\n\nAlso, Goldberg appeared on Charlamagne Tha God’s show, Hell of a Week, and discussed her personal picks for the ensemble cast. She said, “Ask Keke Palmer to come in. You know, I want everybody to come in. I want Lizzo to come in, I want everybody. I want the girl with the chest, what's her name? Nicki [Minaj], I want Nicki to come!”\n\nShe continued, “I want everybody, I want as many people who wanna have some fun 'cause I really, desperately need to have some fun.”\n\nDeadline reported in September 2021 that Tim Federle will direct the upcoming film. It was also announced that Tom Leonardis would serve as producer and Madhuri Shekar would write the script.\n\nFederle is best known for his work on the Disney+ series, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, which he created and produced. Meanwhile, Shekar has penned the script for projects like Evil Eye, 3 Body Problem and The Nevers.\n\nKeeping my fingers crossed for more Sister Act 3 updates!\n\nWant all the latest entertainment news sent right to your inbox?
