        "text": "1987\n\nCity Locations\n\nPembroke (USA), Asheville (USA), Lake Lure (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nHotel, Chalet\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBungalow, Cabin, Hotel Style\n\nAbout Dirty Dancing\n\nIn 1987, the classic romantic dance movie \"Dirty Dancing\" made its theatrical debut. Captivating audiences across the globe, it was the result of Eleanor Bergstein's screenplay and Linda Gottliebâs production combined with Emile Ardolino's masterful direction. In this timeless romance, Frances \"Baby\" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) embarks on a romantic journey with her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) during their stay at an enchanting holiday retreat. Together they immerse themselves in the vibrant atmosphere full of joy and wonders that can only be experienced alongside someone special. Drawing inspiration from her own childhood, screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein crafted the timeless classic \"Dirty Dancing.\" Initially, she wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film \"It's My Turn,\" but later developed a story that eventually became \"Dirty Dancing.\" Despite completing the script in 1985, changes in management at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer caused delays during the movieâs development process. Eventually, Vestron Pictures took over production, with Emile Ardolino as director and Linda Gottlieb as producer. John Morris's music provided the soundtrack while Kenny Ortega choreographed some of the most memorable dance moments seen on screen. After premiering at the Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 1987, \"Dirty Dancing\" was released in the United States on August 21 of the same year. The film was a commercial success and became the first movie to sell more than a million home video copies. Critics applauded Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayzâs performances, as well as the soundtrack generated by Jimmy Lenner, which spawned two multi-platinum albums along with several singles. Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes's iconic single, \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life,\" was nothing short of a phenomenon. Its unparalleled success earned it several awards, including an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award under the Best Original Song category. \"Dirty Dancing\" became so popular that it spawned a 2004 prequel titled \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,\" as well as a stage adaptation that had sellout performances in Australia, Europe, and North America. In addition, a made-for-TV remake was released in 2017. A sequel is currently scheduled for release in 2024, with Jennifer Grey set to reprise her role.\n\nDirty Dancing Locations\n\nTo film \"Dirty Dancing,\" principal photography took place in Lake Lure in North Carolina and Mountain Lake, Virginia. From iconic scenes like Baby carrying the watermelon and practicing her moves on the signature stairs to interior dancing sequences in Johnny's cabin, Camp Occoneechee at Lake Lure served as a fantastic filming location for âDirty Dancing.â Production for \"Dirty Dancing\" commenced on September 5, 1986, and wrapped up after just 43 days. The Lake Lure Inn's ballroom provided a backdrop for the climactic lift scene. For other scenes, such as the Houseman family cabins, Kellerman's Hotel, beach games, and Penny crying in the kitchen, Mountain Lake served as a filming location. Here is a breakdown of where some of the other iconic âDirty Dancingâ scenes were filmed.\n\nDuring the summer of 1963, Frances \"Baby\" Houseman (played by Jennifer Grey), a 17-year-old, goes on vacation with her parents, Dr. Jake (Jerry Orbach) and Marjorie Houseman (Kelly Bishop), as well as her elder sister Lisa (Jane Brucker). Their destination is Kellerman's, an upscale resort located in the Borscht Belt region and owned by Jake's sarcastic best friend Robbie Gould (Max Cantor). The fictional Kellerman's Mountain House was inspired by Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel, which operated near the town of Liberty from the â20s until its closure in 1986. It was one of the largest resorts in the Borscht Belt region and mainly served Jewish clients from New York City while being a kosher establishment. Despite hosting notable guests over several decades, the establishment eventually closed its doors and most of the buildings on site were demolished by 2018. However, a few structures remained standing in dilapidated condition until they were razed by a fire in 2022. A documentary about the Grossinger's Resort is currently in production, with Executive Producers Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures Television and Robert Friedman of Bungalow Entertainment, aiming for an early 2024 release. One of the easiest ways to get to 211 Mail Rd in Barryville, NY, where the once-famous hotel stood, is by car. It's also possible to take public transportation, and bus 89 runs from Liberty, NY stops near 211 Mail Rd.\n\nWhile exploring the resort one night, Baby secretly witnesses Max instructing Ivy League student waiters to woo the guests' daughters regardless of their physical appearance. Furthermore, Robbie belittles the working-class entertainment staff, including Johnny Castle who is one of the dance instructors. Nestled in Pembroke, off I-460 west of Roanoke, Virginia lies the Mountain Lake Lodge which served as one of the main âDirty Dancingâ film sets. It is a one-of-a-kind retreat that offers guests an unforgettable escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. One of the most iconic features of Mountain Lake Lodge is, without a doubt, the lake itself. This crystal-clear body of water has been a popular destination for generations of visitors who come to swim, fish, or simply relax by its shores. Whether you're seeking adventure or simply looking for a peaceful retreat in one of Virginia's most beautiful settings, Mountain Lake Lodge is sure to leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. From the East Coast, travelers can hop on a plane from many major cities and be in Pembroke in no time. Once they have landed, they can take a short taxi ride to the Lodge which is just five miles away. Alternatively, visitors who are up for a scenic route can rent a car at one of the local rental companies or use ridesharing services located conveniently close to the airport.\n\nBaby discovers that Johnny's dance partner Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant with Robbie's child. Robbie, a womanizer and Yale School of Medicine student, is now pursuing Lisa. When he refuses to provide any help to Penny, Baby decides to take matters into her own hands. She borrows money from her father, without disclosing the reason and pays for Penny's abortion. At the scenic foothills of western North Carolina, the Bald Mountain Golf Course is a stunning 18-hole course that offers golfers of all skill levels an unforgettable experience. Designed by legendary golf architect George Cobb, the course is known for its challenging layout and breathtaking mountain views. The course also features narrow fairways, strategically placed bunkers, and fast greens that will put even the most seasoned golfer to the test. But it's not just the course itself that draws visitors to Bald Mountain, it's also the natural beauty that surrounds it. As players make their way through each hole, they are treated to panoramic views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and lush forests that stretch as far as the eye can see. 162 Mountains Blvd, in Lake Lure, NC is accessible from nearby Durham, Fayetteville, or any location along the I-95 corridor in NC. Make your way onto I-40 West and eventually take exit 27 towards Chimney Rock State Park. Then simply turn right at Light 63 onto Mountains Blvd to arrive at 162 Mountains Blvd.\n\nFollowing her dance class, Baby returns to her family's bungalow. While on the stairs that lead to the guest bungalows, she starts dancing. The same stairs also serve as the setting for another scene where Baby is seen carrying a watermelon to the workers' party. Firefly Cove is a picturesque community located on the shores of Lake Lure, North Carolina. Known for its natural beauty and serene atmosphere, Firefly Cove is the perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life. One of the most striking features of Firefly Cove is its namesake: the fireflies that light up the night sky during summer months. As dusk falls, these magical insects dance and twirl above the lake, creating a breathtaking spectacle that is truly one-of-a-kind. To navigate your way to Firefly Cove from the Charlotte Douglas International Airport, head southwest on I-85. Follow that to US-321 N and stay on it for about an hour-and-a-half until you reach US-64 W/US 74 Alt W. Turn onto that highway and continue driving for around two hours before you take Exit 167 toward Chimney Rock/Lake Lure. From there, follow NC-9 back north for 10 minutes and you will have arrived at the stunning Firefly Cove!\n\nDuring the final song, Johnny arrives and interrupts by bringing Baby up on stage. He publicly acknowledges that she has had a positive impact on him, and they perform the dance that they had been practicing all summer. The performance concludes with an impressive lift. Dr. Houseman admits his misjudgment of Johnny and reconciles with Baby. The entire staff and guests then join in on the dancing to \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\". The scene was shot at the Grove Park Inn's breathtaking outdoor terrace. Found in the picturesque Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, the Grove Park Inn is a historic and luxurious resort that has been welcoming guests for over a century. Constructed in 1913, the inn's stunning architecture and breathtaking views have made it a beloved destination for generations of visitors. The main building features massive granite boulders and a red-tiled roof that blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings. To reach 290 Macon Ave in Asheville, North Carolina, the quickest route would be to take I-26 and exit at Montford Ave. Head south until the road becomes Macon Ave, and take the first right into the parking lot of the address. If you'd rather not deal with I-26's traffic, try taking Biltmore Ave toward downtown. Once you're close to the Grove Park Inn on your left, turn onto Charlotte Street and make another left onto Macon Ave. The address will be on your left side just after passing Hilliard Avenue.\n\nBilly (Neal Jones) invites Baby to a secret party for resort staff, where she first meets Johnny. The staff cabins at the closed and abandoned Chimney Rock Camp For Boys in Lake Lure served as the filming location for the party scene. It is here that Baby first witnesses the provocative hip-swinging and pelvic thrusting that signify a new era of sexual liberation. Founded in 1963, the camp has been providing campers with opportunities to explore nature, build friendships and develop lifelong skills for over five decades. The camp's location on Lake Lure provides the perfect setting for a wide range of activities including swimming, canoeing, kayaking, fishing, and waterskiing. The most convenient way to get to the camp is by car. Take Interstate 40 to the exit of Highway 64 West before following the signs until you reach your destination. If you are taking public transportation, the Greyhound bus stops nearby, or take a short cab ride from one of the local train stations.\n\nAn adventure awaits any huge fan who embarks on a âDirty Dancingâ filming locations tour. As remarkable as it is to set your eyes on where the magic happened, some behind-the-scenes revelations prove equally fascinating. The crew had to contend with unfavorable weather conditions, including outside temperatures that reached a scorching 105 Â°F (41 Â°C). Inside the set, with all the camera and lighting equipment required for filming, temperatures could soar as high as 120 Â°F (49 Â°C). During one day of shooting, choreographer Kenny Ortega reported that ten people fainted within 25 minutes. Actress Paula Trueman was among them; she collapsed and had to be rushed to the local emergency room due to dehydration. Meanwhile, Patrick Swayze's insistence on performing his own stunts during the \"balancing\" scene led him to fall off the log several times, causing severe knee injury that required fluid drainage at a hospital. Due to schedule delays, filming for \"Dirty Dancing\" extended into the autumn season, forcing set decorators to spray-paint the leaves green to maintain consistency. As temperatures dropped, the famous swimming scene was shot in October when the lake recorded temperatures close to 40 Â°F (4 Â°C). Although her character appeared to enjoy it, actress Grey later revealed that she found the water \"horrifically\" cold and might not have plunged in if not for being \"young and hungry.\""
