        "text": "Nuns like to have fun too. Just ask Sister Mary Clarence.\n\nSister Act hit theaters in 1992. After witnessing a horrible crime, Deloris is in danger. The only way she can stay safe is if she hides in a convent as a nun. Little does Deloris know how much she will learn about herself in hiding as Sister Mary Clarence.\n\nNo matter what I always find myself watching the Sister Act whenever it is on TV. It is hilarious. One of my favorite parts about this movie is the message. You can never judge someone or a style of life until trying it out yourself. Sister Act is an entertaining film that includes one of the best musical numbers.\n\nWhoopie Goldberg is the highlight of Sister Act. Everything from her reactions, comedic timing, and strong character development of Deloris is terrific. Clearly, hiding as a nun was not on Deloris’ career plan. She learns more than what she was expecting to. Goldberg exhibits numerous talents. Most importantly Deloris presents the ability to change.\n\nSister Act would not be what it is without its strong ensemble of women who performed as nuns. Notables include Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, and the late Mary Wickes. Each character learns a valuable lesson about themselves. I have always enjoyed watching Sister Mary Robert become a more confident person who learns to take charge.\n\nGet ready Harry Potter fans. Professor McGonagall, I mean Maggie Smith, makes an exceptional appearance as Mother Superior. Her reactions whenever something goes wrong are the best. At first, not open to Deloris and her contrasting nature, she learns to give her a chance.\n\nOther credits to include are Harvey Keitel, Bill Nunne, Robert Miranda, Richard Portnow, the late Joseph Maher, and a talented ensemble of singing nuns. Although they are only background parts, the group of curious girls who come into the church have a very important role. You can never judge someone based on appearance.\n\nMy most favorite scene of all is when the choir sings a very upbeat and entertaining rendition of ‘Hail Holy Queen’. The number is so catchy that I enjoy singing or dancing along to it. If I am ever in a musical version of Sister Act I want to be a part of this song.\n\nSister Act bestows the value of music. Music brings people together. For most of my life, I have been involved in choirs. Being in a choir is a blessing. It’s a chance to sing together with people, make friendships, and create music.\n\nThe story of Sister Act embodies notable themes. Growth, change, and friendship are major themes in Sister Act. The late Emile Ardolino did a superb job of embodying the film with these themes. Because of his direction audiences can relate to certain aspects of character growth. It doesn’t matter how old you are. Anybody can learn and change.\n\nYou never know who you may befriend. Giving friendship a chance is essential. The scene where the nuns sit down to eat ice cream and share stories is reminiscent of memories with my friends. Deloris learns how she has more in common with them than she thought.\n\nReligion also plays a vital role too. No matter what we believe in, religion is always a part of our lives to anybody in the world. That’s an aspect of this film that is not talked about enough.\n\nSister Act will make you crack up and smile. It is forever a classic comedy. I recommend that you watch it if you have not yet seen it. It is an incredible experience to remember."
