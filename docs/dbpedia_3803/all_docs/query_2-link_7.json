        "text": "Description\n\nCottage to Let\n\nLeslie Banks stars alongside Alastair Sim, John Mills and a very young George Cole in this thrilling wartime espionage drama from award-winning director Anthony Asquith. Adapted from Geoffrey Kerr’s smash West End play (which also starred Banks, Sim and Cole), Cottage to Let is presented here as a brand-new High Definition restoration from original film elements in its original theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nWorking in secret for the Air Ministry at his remote country house laboratory, John Barrington is key to the ongoing war effort against the Nazis. Barrington’s household, however, has been infiltrated by enemy agents who plan to take him back to Berlin as prisoner.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURE: Image gallery\n\n£15 with free UK Postage!"
