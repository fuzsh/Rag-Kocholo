His eccentric wife takes in child evacuees from London to be accommodated in a nearby cottage they own. But since Charles Dimble has been let the cottage by a realty agency, Mrs. Barrington decides they can only take one evacuee, a cocky teenager named Ronald . Meanwhile, an injured pilot parachutes into a nearby loch. He is rescued and brought to the house. As a result, the cottage becomes part-hospital, with the Barringtons' daughter, Helen, acting as nurse. The pilot identifies himself as Flight Lieutenant Perry, based at a nearby airfield. When he is given a telephone to call headquarters, however, he makes the call alone, with the phone wire disconnected.\n\nAt the War Office, there is discussion of Barrington, with concern that someone is spying on his top secret work. They suspect his assistant Alan Trently, who was educated in Germany and still corresponds with people in Switzerland. The War Office decides to investigate. Later, at the Barrington estate, Ronald breaks a house rule by wandering into the laboratory. He overcomes Barrington's initial hostility with his practical know-how and the two become friends. In the meantime, Trently becomes jealous when Helen starts spending time with Perry. However, Helen resists Perry's advances and eventually lets Trently know that she prefers him. One evening, German agents kidnap Barrington from is lab. However, the resourceful Ronald stows away in the car's boot. Both he and the captive Barrington are deposited at an isolated, off-road water mill.\n\nAfter Ronald sneaks into the mill, he spies Perry arriving in a second car. Ronald is shocked when Flight Lieutenant Perry is revealed to be a German intelligence agent, plotting to fly Barrington to Berlin by seaplane. It turns out, however, that Dimble is actually a British counter-intelligence officer sent by the War Office. He infiltrates Perry's spy ring and learns where Barrington is being held. All but one of the spies are captured and Ronald and Barrington are freed. Perry initially escapes but is eventually tracked down and killed in a shoot-out with Dimble.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLeslie Banks as John Barrington\n\nAlastair Sim as Charles Dimble\n\nJohn Mills as Flight Lieutenant Perry\n\nJeanne de Casalis as Mrs. Barrington\n\nCarla Lehmann as Helen Barrington\n\nGeorge Cole as Ronald\n\nMichael Wilding as Alan Trently\n\nFrank Cellier as Ernest Forest\n\nMuriel Aked as Miss Fernery\n\nWally Patch as Evans\n\nMuriel George as Mrs. Trimm\n\nHay Petrie as Dr. Truscott\n\nCatherine Lacey as Mrs. Stokes\n\nAnnie Esmond as Lady wrapping parcels for the bazaar (uncredited)\n\nPeter Gawthorne as Senior RAF officer (uncredited)\n\nArthur Hambling as Scotland Yard Inspector (uncredited)\n\nRoddy Hughes as German agent (uncredited)\n\nBrefni O'Rorke as Scottish Police Inspector (uncredited)\n\nCharles Rolfe as German agent (uncredited)\n\nBen Williams as Scottish fisherman (uncredited)\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nRyall, Tom.
