        "text": "Veteran actor George Cole, best known for his role as Arthur Daley in the long-running TV hit Minder, has died aged 90.\n\nCole – who according to reports had been battling an undisclosed illness – passed away at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on Wednesday.\n\nHis death was later confirmed by his agent Derek Webster, who said in a statement: ‘It is with deep regret that I have to announce the sad death of one of our most loved and respected actors.\n\n‘George Cole passed away yesterday at the Royal Berkshire Hospital after a short illness. His wife Penny and his son Toby were with him at his bedside.’\n\nThe actor – who was born in Tooting, South London, in 1925 and adopted when he was 10 days old – began his acting career when he was just 14 after joining the cast of a touring musical.\n\nHe went on to make his film debut in 1941’s Cottage To Let alongside actor Alastair Sim – who went on to become his mentor – and took on several more roles before his career was interrupted by a spell in the RAF in 1944.\n\nCole found fame in the 1950s starring as Flash Harry in the popular St Trinian’s series of movies – while he also appeared in the likes of Scrooge (1951), Our Girl Friday (1953) and the 1963 adaptation of Cleopatra starring Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nHowever it was his role as Minder’s wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley for which he is most likely to be remembered.\n\nThe series, which also starred Dennis Waterman, was a ratings smash which ran on ITV for ten series between 1979 and 1994.\n\nActor Gary Webster replaced Waterman in the final two series of the show – which was also revived in 2009 with Shane Richie starring as Arthur Daley’s nephew Archie.\n\nThe show also turned Cole in to an unlikely pop star, hitting the charts in 1983 with the novelty Christmas hit What Are We Gonna Get For ‘Er Indoors – a reference to Daley’s onscreen wife who never actually appeared in the show:\n\nMore recently Cole was seen in the 1996 horror film Mary Reilly as well as appearing in Midsommer Murders in 2008.\n\nHis last project, the crime horror movie Road Rage, has yet to be released – with its director telling Mail Online that the actor urged him to hurry up and finish the movie before his death.\n\n‘The last time I spoke to George was to let him know the movie had been delayed and he said “please get a move on, I would like to make another movie before I die”,’ he told the site.\n\n‘I am absolutely mortified.’"
