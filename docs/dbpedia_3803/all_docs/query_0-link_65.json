        "text": "Minder star George Cole has died at the age of 90 surrounded by his family in Royal Berkshire Hosptial.\n\nThe actor, who became a household name playing cockney wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley, lived in Stoke Row in South Oxfordshire.\n\nHis agent Derek Webster announced today “It is with deep regret that I have to announce the sad death of one our most loved and respected actors,” he said.\n\nMinder\n\nMr Cole played opposite Dennis Waterman in the hit ITV show Minder for more than 10 years.\n\nThe Arthur Daley character became synonymous with small-time dodgy businessmen as the TV show attracted an audience of 17 million.\n\nHe was also well-known for his role as Flash Harry in the original St Trinian’s films in the 50s and 60s.\n\nHe worked in the films with his mentor, actor Alistair Sim.\n\nAdoption\n\nMr Cole was given up for adoption as a baby aged just 10 days. He left school at 14 to be a butcher’s boy and had an ambition to join the Merchant Navy, but landed a part in a touring musical and chose acting as a career.\n\nHe was cast in the film Cottage to Let (1941) at the age of 15 when he starred opposite Alastair Sim.\n\nMr Sim took a liking to the boy, and agreed with his family to take him into his home along with his adoptive mother.\n\nMr Sim then helped the young Cole to lose his Cockney accent. He stayed with the Sim family until he was 27.\n\nAs well as the St Trinian’s films, he also starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Cleopatra, and gothic horror The Vampire Lovers.\n\nWhen the Minder series ended, Mr Cole still worked regularly, aged 70-plus, with guest roles in Midsummer Murders, Heartbeat and New Tricks.\n\nHe was made an OBE in 1992 and married his second wife, Penny, in 1967."
