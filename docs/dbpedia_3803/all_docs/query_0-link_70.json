        "text": "The American release title for the film was Bombsight Stolen.\n\nThe story of a Nazi kidnap plot set in the wilds of Scotland is pretty much par for the course for the films of that era, but what sets this film apart is the truly extraordinary cast. John Mills is chillingly good playing the affable and quaintly British Flt. Lieut. who turns out to be someone you wouldn't dream he could be (I'll save the surprise for the movie!), and Michael Wilding settles admirably in his supporting role behind Leslie Banks and the incomparable Alastair Sim. And if you think that cast is good then brace yourself for a 15-year making his screen debut who blows them all away.\n\nGeorge Cole.\n\nA protege of Sim's, Cole stars as the cockney evacuee who becomes a hero. How he came to the part was luck personified. Accompanying a pal to an audition, he finished up getting the part instead of his pal. That was for the play of Cottage to Let, which led to his appearance in the film."
