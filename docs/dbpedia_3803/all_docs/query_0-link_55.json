        "text": "George Cole joked that he would like a bottle of whisky on his deathbed while Minder co-star Dennis Waterman reminisced that his late friend was 'happiest at home'.\n\nIn his final hours, on-screen bodyguard Dennis was there again to look after and laugh with Arthur Daley actor George, who has died at the age of 90.\n\nThe much-loved star passed away on Wednesday following a short illness.\n\nAnd playing for laughs like his on-screen character, George was still joking at the end of his life about getting another drink.\n\nDennis, who played Arthur’s long-suffering bodyguard Terry McCann in the long-running hit ITV series, described his former co-star as ‘one of the nicest blokes in the world’ and said he had visited the star and his wife Penny at their Oxfordshire home earlier this week.\n\nHe said: “I had the privilege of spending Tuesday afternoon with him and Penny and, although very frail, his wit was as evident as ever.\n\n“It was a bit of a shock he was looking so very frail. Penny asked if he would like a drink. He said: ‘I’d like a bottle of whisky, but I know you won't give me that!’”\n\n“I’m so grateful to have been a friend of this wonderful man. We worked together for many years and my boast is that we laughed all day, every day.\n\n“He was an amazing man, a wonderful actor and besotted with his family. Farewell old friend.”\n\nSpeaking about his friend away from the cameras, he added: “George always took it in his stride, he didn’t got to all the social events, he liked to go home.\n\n\"He loved horse racing, that was his big hobby, crosswords and his family. He was quite difficult to get out of his house, that was where he was happiest.\n\n“I am so sad to hear of George’s death. His family must be devastated, and I am absolutely certain that anybody who ever knew him, will feel the same.”\n\nFellow stars of stage and screen paid tribute to the actor today, describing him as “immaculate” and “unforgettable”.\n\nSir Roger Moore said: “How sad to hear George Cole has gone to that great cutting room in the sky. A lovely actor. A gentleman.”\n\nActress Hannah Waterman said: “Just heard George Cole has died. Devastated. Such a huge part of my childhood, I loved him. My thoughts are with Penny and the kids.”\n\n‘Allo ‘Allo star Vicki Michelle said: “So sad George Cole has left us. A great character actor & lovely man. Fab memories of working with him on Minder.”\n\nToday it emerged the star, who has more than 100 screen credits to his name in a career spanning more than seven decades, had only recently been cast in a film called Road Rage which had been due to shoot later this year.\n\nThe film’s director Spencer Hawken revealed today that the actor had told him to “get a move on” as he was desperate to complete one final film.\n\n“The last time I spoke to George was to let him know the movie had been delayed and he said ‘please get a move on, I would like to make another movie before I die’,” he recalled.\n\n“I am absolutely mortified.”\n\nThe star had been at the Royal Berkshire Hospital surrounded by family when he died, according to his agent Derek Webster.\n\nGeorge Edward Cole was born in 1925 in Tooting, South London, but was adopted when he was just 10 days old after being abandoned by his mother.\n\nHe only discovered the truth about his family at the age of thirteen when he found his adoption papers on top of his parents wardrobe.\n\nHe later claimed he never bothered to track down his biological parents saying: “I was happy with what I had. Why go looking for something else?”\n\nHe described his upbringing as “the poorest you could get”, leaving school at 14 in order to help support his family.\n\nHaving been offered an apprenticeship with a local butcher, his acting career begun in 1939 when he stumbled upon an advert looking for a young actor to star in a West End show.\n\nDespite no formal acting training, he landed a role in the touring production on White Horse Inn after reciting a poem written by Julius Caesar at the audition.\n\nSix months later he met Scottish star Alastair Sim while starring in the film Cottage to Let and was taken in by the actor and his wife Naomi at their Oxfordshire home.\n\nThe couple helped rid George of his Cockney accent, which they feared would hamper his career.\n\nHe stayed with the couple until he was in his 20s and attributed his early success to his mentor, with the pair going on to appear in 11 films together, including St Trinian’s - a series based on a fictional girls’ school in which he played wheeler-dealer Flash Harry.\n\nGeorge appeared in the 1943 film The Demi-Paradise opposite Laurence Olivier and in Olivier’s film version of Henry V the following year before his acting career was briefly halted by National Service.\n\nHe joined the RAF spending three years running an officers’ mess bar in occupied Germany.\n\nDespite film roles drying up in the 1960s and 70s, George continued to be prolific on stage.\n\nHowever, it was in 1979 that he was to finally became a household name when he landed the role of dodgy used-car salesman Arthur Daley.\n\nWaterman had initially wanted the part to go to Denholm Elliott, fearing that George was “too posh” to play the character.\n\nThe hit show went on to run for 15 years, with over 100 episode across 10 series. The programme regularly drew audiences of 17million and was shown in 70 countries, with Cole creating one of the best-loved character’s in TV history.\n\nWith his cockney twang, brown camel-hair coat and trilby hat, he helped popularise catchphrases such as “a nice little earner” and “’Er indoors”.\n\nThe latter was even adopted into the Oxford Dictionary of modern slang, meaning “one’s wife or girlfriend, a domineering woman”.\n\nMinder was revived in 2009, with actor Shane Richie playing Archie, Arthur Daley’s nephew, but it was axed the following year after a lukewarm reception for the first series.\n\nHowever, despite the enduring appeal of the original show, Cole admitted he wasn’t fond of Arthur Daley, saying: “He was a dreadful character. I don’t understand how he became so popular.\n\n“It used to be worrying when I got letters from young kids saying Arthur Daley was just like their dad. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.\n\n“He behaved terribly to people who got in the way of him making a quick quid - and the audience still loved him.”\n\nHe added: “He was actually written as a loveable rogue but personally I’m not so sure about the ‘loveable’ part. In my opinion he was a rather unlikeable person.”\n\nThe star, who was made an OBE in 1992, had four children from his two marriages.\n\nHe wed Eileen Moore in 1954 and the couple had a daughter, Harriet, and son Crispin before the pair split after 11 years of marriage when she left him for a hairdresser.\n\nHe met his second wife Penny in 1967 when they were both auditioning for a play at the Savoy Theatre.\n\nThey went on to have a daughter Tara and son Toby and lived at their home in Oxfordshire, which Cole had built next door to Alastair Sim.\n\nThe star turned his back on a career in Hollywood, saying he once tried to live there but swiftly returned to England, describing the town as “a cross between Blackpool and Southend. On a bad day”.\n\nHe lived in the small village of Stoke Row in Oxfordshire, just five miles outside of Henley-on-Thames, and aside from being a regular at the local pub, he and wife Penny - who he married in 1964 - largely kept themselves to themselves.\n\nThe couple’s tranquillity was disturbed during a planning row in the tiny village where they lived, over a large wood storage warehouse that had been built next door.\n\nGeorge became “deeply depressed” as a result of the metal barn - which stored large wooden logs prior to being transported to a nearby sawmill - being put up by neighbour James Morris.\n\nA council ruling meant the structure did not need planning permission - a decision the Coles challenged on the grounds it caused a high level of noise, which needed controlling.\n\nMrs Cole said last year: “It looks like an escapee from an industrial estate. I think the problem is the planning department didn’t perhaps imagine it would be quite so intrusive and out of place.\n\n“It doesn’t nestle in the side of the hill and he has built the plateau it stands on so it is visible from every angle.\n\n“This is the last thing we need. It has made us both unwell.\n\n“George has fallen and knocked himself and he is on hefty medication for other health problems. This is shaking what he values.\n\n“He has always been very quiet and needs peace and quiet. Otherwise he wouldn’t have lived here for 70 years.”"
