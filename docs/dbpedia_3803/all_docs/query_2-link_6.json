        "text": "British wartime mystery thriller full of Nazi agents and Allied spies.\n\nTop boffin John Barrington (Leslie Banks) works on new weapons in a remote Scottish cottage which is also being used as a military hospital. An injured pilot (John Mills) arrives at the same time as a bunch of evacuees, including Ronald (George Cole), who fancies himself as a schoolboy Sherlock Holmes. Then a shady, inquisitive man who has booked to stay of the cottage, Dimble (Alastair Sim), turns up as well.\n\nPlenty of fun and a little wartime propaganda to be had, and director Anthony Asquith provides plenty of tension and suspense as we try to work out who are the goodies and who are the baddies.\n\nJeanne De…\n\nI did not know that Alistair Sim adopted George Cole as a protégé (Minder for my age group).

The cast is terrific-John Mills as a womanising Spitfire pilot, Leslie Banks as the gifted inventor with Nazi spies on his tail, Michael Wilding as his endearing assistant ​and a suitably creepy Alastair Sim as a suspicious lodger.
