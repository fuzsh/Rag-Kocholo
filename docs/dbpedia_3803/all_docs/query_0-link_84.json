        "text": "Falstaff was a boastful coward but they loved him in Shakespeare's day. Del Boy Trotter is deluded and dishonest and keeps ruining his brother's life but we still can't get enough of him.\n\nArthur Daley was cut very much from the same sort of cloth (in his case a camel hair coat). In 10 series of Minder he was a deceitful conman who always did up poor Terry McCann (played by Dennis Waterman) like a kipper. A master manipulator and mangler of English phraseology Arfur (to give his name its correct phonetic spelling) was a mix of Fagin and Mrs Malaprop and TV viewers - more than 16 million of them every week - adored him.\n\nThe only person who still can't understand why, it seems, is the man who played him for 15 years. Actor George Cole's dislike of the character for which he will be for ever remembered is intense.\n\n\"He was actually written as a loveable rogue but personally I'm not so sure about the 'loveable' part. In my opinion he was a rather unlikeable person. In fact, not to mince words, I think he was a dreadful character. He behaved terribly to people who got in the way of his making a quick quid and still the audience loved him. It used to be worrying sometimes when I got letters from young children saying that Arthur Daley was just like their dad. I wouldn't wish that on any of them.\"\n\nHe hated it when fans assumed that he was just like Arthur. \"I used to get terribly upset when people took an episode so seriously that they thought I genuinely did have a lock-up full of garden gnomes and wanted to know if they could buy one. It was extremely worrying.\"\n\nBefore Minder came along at the end of the Seventies Cole had been a successful and versatile actor for nearly 40 years. He had played in Shakespeare and Chekhov and in blockbusters such as Cleopatra. Born in 1925 in Tooting, South London, and brought up in Morden in the outer reaches of South-west London, he had long discarded his Cockney accent through elocution lessons. Yet it was his ability to retrieve it that won him the part and a place in comedy history.\n\nArthur Daley was certainly untrustworthy but he didn't trust many people either. George Cole also learned the hard way that you can't always rely on even your nearest and dearest. His mother left him in a nursing home as a newborn. His first wife, actress Eileen Moore left him after 11 years to run off with a hairdresser. Cole won custody of their two children, Crispin and Harriet, only for them to leave him when they were teenagers to go and live with their mother. Even during his long and happy second marriage to actress Penny Morrell he has always preferred the security of his own company to socialising.\n\nA psychoanalyst would no doubt diagnose \"abandonment issues\" - not that Cole has much truck with that sort of thing. He long ago adopted a tactic of glossing over the unpleasant bits of his life.\n\nHe was destined for the orphanage until another George Cole and his wife Florence adopted him when he was 10 days old. George senior had been gassed in the Great War, which left him a semi-invalid with epilepsy, so Florence cleaned offices to support the family in a twoup two-down council house with a copper water heater. After paying the rent they had Â£2 a week to live on. Times were undoubtedly hard but Cole says he never remembers feeling poor.\n\n\"My background probably was one of poverty although I didn't know it at the time. How the hell they [his parents] managed I don't know. But I don't remember ever being unhappy or hungry although I do remember I didn't have many toys.\"\n\nIt was while searching for Christmas gifts on to of his parents' wardrobe that he discovered his adoption papers. He was 13 and it was the first he knew of it. Florence wouldn't tell him anything about his birth parents and begged him to keep his adoption secret. He admits to feeling \"terribly shocked\" but then blithely dismisses it. \"It was irrelevant to me. I'd had very good parents and a very good childhood and after it was explained to me I just accepted it.\"\n\nA few years later he tried to trace his birth parents. \"Then I thought, 'What the hell am I doing this for? They don't want to find me so I don't want to find them.' I'm grateful to both of them for having me but that's it.\"\n\nA clever lad Cole won a scholarship but was unable to take it up because his parents couldn't afford the uniform. Instead he left school at 14 and had a job lined up delivering for a butcher when he spotted a newspaper advert for boy actors. The next day he auditioned and was taken on. Before getting on the train to Liverpool with the rest of the cast he had just enough time to buy a cardboard suitcase and a spare shirt and to send his parents a telegram saying: \"Gone on stage. Will write soon.\" He sent them five shillings a week from his wages but never lived at home again, though he insists they were pleased for him.\n\nHIS father died just before the outbreak of the Second World War and in 1941 Cole was cast as a Cockney evacuee in the film Cottage To Let. The star was Alastair Sim and he took 15-year-old George under his wing. He taught him to iron out his accent and with bombs falling on London brought him to live in Oxfordshire with him and his wife Naomi. Florence also came to stay but she found it too quiet and she missed her friends.\n\nFor Cole, however, the Sims became yet another set of parents. Alastair was his mentor and champion. It was thanks to him that Cole was cast as the young Ebenezer in the 1951 film Scrooge (Sim played older Scrooge) and played Flash Harry the spiv in the St Trinian's films. Cole was so devoted to Sim that he built a house next door to his. He still lives there.\n\nIn 1954 Cole married Eileen Moore and when she left him he was devastated.\n\nIn 1967 he met Penny Morrell when she auditioned for a part in a play he was in at the Savoy Theatre. It was love at first sight and they have been together ever since. Penny gave up work to look after her stepchildren and then had two - Tara and Toby - herself.\n\nBut it was not all happy families. Harriet went to live with her mother when she was 15, followed soon after by Crispin. Harriet claimed her father had forced her to choose between her parents. Father and son were eventually reconciled but Cole has apparently had no contact with Harriet, now 54, for 40 years.\n\nIronically he was initially thought too posh to play Arthur Daley until someone remembered him as Flash Harry. Once again he owed the part to his natural voice.\n\nArthur started out as very much a secondary character in Minder but Cole and his chemistry with co-star Dennis Waterman helped to turn him into an icon.\n\nNow 88 Cole underwent heart surgery in 2002 and during a recent dispute with a neighbour Penny claimed that he was frail.\n\nHowever Cole himself insists he feels 40. As Arfur would say, the world is still his lobster."
