ACTOR George Cole has died.

The star of film and television passed away at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on Wednesday.

Cole, who turned 90 in April, lived with his wife Penny near Stoke Row.

In a career that spanned 70 years, Cole played Flash Harry in the early St Trinian?s films but he is best remembered as Arthur Daley in Minder.

He played the crooked car dealer in 107 episodes over 11 series from 1979 to 1994 and spawned catchphrases such as ??er indoors? and ?nice little earner?.

Cole was born in Tooting, London, in 1925 but was given up for adoption, something he found out as a teenager.

He loved performing at school and when he left at 14 in 1939 he saw a newspaper advert for auditions as a young boy in a musical. He attended and got the part that started his acting career.

Cole made his acting debut in the 1941 film Cottage To Let and later acted opposite Laurence Olivier in The Demi-Paradise in 1943 and Olivier?s film version on Henry V in 1944.

His career was interrupted by service in the Royal Air Force from 1944 to 1947.

Cole then took the lead role in radio comedy A Life of Bliss which ran from 1953 to 1969, playing a bumbling bachelor. It lasted for six series.

In the Fifties he appeared as the young title character in Scrooge. He also appeared in Too Many Cooks in 1959.

In 1973, he starred in the film Take Me High alongside Cliff Richard and Deborah Watling.

His widow, a former actress, runs Vintage Turnaround, a shop on the Newtown Industrial Estate in Henley.
