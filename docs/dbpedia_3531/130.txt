A Catalog of all Cast from the Films

The venerable Charlie Chan film series lasted for close to two decades, beginning in 1931 with Charlie Chan Carries On, ultimately reaching its conclusion in 1949 with The Sky Dragon. Through the years, numerous actors and actresses provided the threads that wove the rich tapestry upon which the exploits of the world-renowned detective were chronicled. Some persons only appeared briefly in uncredited bit parts, while others were to return on a number of occasions in a variety of roles.

Included are, as mentioned, actors, and even other famous – and infamous – personalities who appeared in Charlie Chan’s adventures through archive footage, as well as a couple of animal actors!
