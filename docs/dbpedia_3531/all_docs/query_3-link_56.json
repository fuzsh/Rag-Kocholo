        "text": "Show Them No Mercy is a real quality crime film! And since this was anti-gangster, the Hays Office allows nasty violence! I'm used to seeing this kind of stuff from Warner Bros, but here 20th Century Fox has a go at the genre and creates a action packed film with plenty of suspense! I'm surprised this one is not better known!\n\nThis was the time when FBI was working closely with Hollywood to make sure the good guys were the heroes, so in return this film seems to have a lot of benefits of G-Men methods with tricks being revealed on how to catch kidnappers and ransom guys. Plus J. Edgar got a little shout out!\n\nRochelle Hudson & Edward Norris…\n\nA routine kidnapping thriller that's probably more significant in the real-life history of American law and order than in that of American crime movies. In that it's basically an infomercial for the newly empowered FBI, complete with a worshipful reference to the great J. Edgar Hoover, as well as a fictionalized account of recent crimes, in this case the Lindbergh kidnapping, ala DIRTY HARRY. The actual story content, which has a fancy-free young couple and their newborn baby imprisoned in a cabin by four thugs guarding a recently acquired ransom, begins promisingly-studio journeyman director George Marshall had a real knack for fusing light and dark material and tones, as in the classic DESTRY RIDES AGAIN and sleepers MURDER, HE SAYS…\n\nA young couple, Rochelle Hudson and Edward Norris, with their baby and dog, seek shelter from a rainstorm in an apparently deserted farmhouse. However, the house is being used as a hideout by a gang of merciless kidnappers, Cesar Romero, Bruce Cabot, Ed Brophy , and Warren Hymer. The kidnappers are not welcoming to Hudson and Norris and lock them and their baby in a room while they debate what to do with them. The situation is terrifying for the couple and becomes more so when the kidnappers learn that their ransom money is marked.\n\nThis tense and exciting film never lets up and concludes with a scene that simultaneously manages to shock and relieve the viewer. The FBI was…\n\nA gripping kidnapping caper staring Caesar Romero as Toby the gangs leader...Bruce Cabot as the cold and ruthless Pitch...Edward Brophy and Warren Hymer as Buzz and Gimp...just collected their $200G ransom money...head back to their farmhouse hideout and unsuspectingly walk in a couple Rochelle Hudson & Edward Norris with an infant child and dog...Pitch is heartless and is itching to bump them off...the movie intensifies when the gang learns the money is marked...I was surprised to see an explicit gun shooting scene with none other Rochelle Hudson behind a “Tommy” sub machine gun...and I was even shocked that this got pass the censors."
