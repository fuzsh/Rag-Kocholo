        "text": "Perry Mason. Raymond Burr, right? That super popular TV series from 1957-1966 about the stern defense attorney who always nabbed the real criminal by the end of the show, right? No, not him. There was another Perry Mason character adaption decades prior- as Warren William took on the role on the big screen originally, in four films from 1934-1936.\n\nThe Perry Mason role is a fictional character of a bright and determined defense attorney based on a series of novels and short stories by Erle Stanley Gardner (1889-1970). He knew a thing or two about courtroom drama from his years practicing law in California. Gardner was an interesting character himself. He grew up in the rough and tumble world of the Gold Rush days in the Klondike and other mining towns. At the age of 21, with no formal education, he passed the California bar exam. He also spoke fluent Chinese and took on many Chinese clients in the early years. For supplemental income, Gardner started writing in the 1920’s with mysteries, adventure tales and westerns for pulp fiction magazines (such as the “Black Mask”) under pseudonyms. He had a bankable penchant for writing so he continued at a prolific and successful pace. In 1933, the Perry Mason character was born (the name was inspired by the publisher, Perry Mason & Co., of his childhood favorite magazine, Youth’s Companion) with two stories, “The Case of the Velvet Claws” and “The Case of the Sulky Girl.”\n\nWith tremendous success of this character via pulp fiction novels, the first Perry Mason film released with Alan Crosland’s THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG (1934) starring Warren William as Perry Mason. Also starring:\n\nMary Astor… as Bessie Foley\n\nAllen Jenkins… as Sgt. Holcomb\n\nGrant Mitchell… as District Attorney Claude Drumm\n\nHelen Trenholme… as Della Street, Mason’s loyal secretary\n\nHelen Lowell… as Elizabeth Walker\n\nDorothy Tree… as Lucy Benton\n\nGordon Westcott… as Arthur Cartwright\n\nIn THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG (1934), our mystery begins with (yup, you guessed it) a howling dog, a neighbor’s window and a rather unnerved man plus his wild story that the barking dog is an omen of a death. He pleads for Mason to write his will, making the lady next door his beneficiary. Perry Mason takes the case as he’s intrigued by all the odd facets of this encounter. In short time, both the mysterious man and his beneficiary are missing- now Perry Mason must unravel the clues including a humdinger of a identification mix-up.\n\nThis is the first time we see Perry Mason on screen which is a real treat for several reasons.. for one, the novels do not go into great detail to describe the Mason character in physical form so we get to experience him without any prejudice. For another, we also see a new side of actor Warren William. This straight-laced, all-business character is rather unlike his Lone Wolf or Philo Vance characters. And it goes without saying, watching Warren William in a flick is always a real treat!\n\nWhile the first film sticks fairly closely to the novels, the next three take a departure. Second in this series of William as Mason films is Michael Curtiz’ THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE (1935). But mystery is still the name of the game as a woman (Rhoda Montaine) comes to Mason for help as she reveals that after remarrying, she discovers her first husband is still alive. Perry Mason goes to resolve the matter with the first husband (Gregory Moxley) only to find his dead body.\n\nBy now, THE THIN MAN (1934) had launched to great success and it’s influence was apparent. Instead of the completely straight and serious Perry Mason translation as in the first film, this one injected a more comedic and lighter tone that was also reflected in the supporting cast roles. Now Warren William was transitioning with a confidence that would continue into his next films.\n\nSupporting Cast:\n\nWarren William…as Perry Mason\n\nMargaret Lindsay… as Rhoda Montaine\n\nDonald Woods… as Carl Montaine\n\nClaire Dodd… as Della Street, still Mason’s secretary\n\nAllen Jenkins… as Spudsy Drake, Mason’s whacky sidekick (note the big difference from the last film)\n\nPhillip Reed… as Dr. Claude Millbeck\n\nBarton MacLane… as Chief Detective Joe Lucas\n\nWini Shaw… as Doris Pender\n\nWarren Hymer… as Oscar Pender\n\nOlin Howland… as Coroner Wilbur Strong\n\nCharles Richman… as C. Phillip Montaine\n\n*Errol Flynn… as Gregory Moxley\n\n*This film is notable as Errol Flynn’s first American film appearance. He’s seen twice: once as a non-speaking part of a corpse and then again as a more animated role as a flashback to this character.\n\nAs the third film in this series, William reprises the Perry Mason role in Archie Mayo’s THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS (1935). In this who-dunnit mystery meets screwball comedy, Mason takes the case when a ‘lucky legs’ beauty contest goes awry then the scam artist who organized it skips town with the prize money and he later shows up with a knife in his chest. The antics and one-liners abound in this one. And to witness the ‘Thin Man’ influence, simply note Perry Mason’s appearance on the floor due to a alcohol bender and the influence is unmistakable. Yet it’s undeniably a departure from the straight-laced Mason from the Gardner’s novels.\n\nSupporting cast:\n\nGenevieve Tobin… as Della Street, Mason’s secretary yet again with a new actress\n\nPatricia Ellis… as Margie\n\nLyle Talbot… as Dr. Doray\n\nAllen Jenkins… as Spudsy Drake, and his goofiest version yet\n\nBarton Maclane… as Bisonette\n\nPeggy Shannon… as Thelma Bell\n\nPorter Hall… as Col. Bradbury\n\nAnita Kerry… as Eva Lamont\n\nCraig Rynolds… as Frank Patton\n\nHenry O’Neill… as District Attorney Manchester\n\nCharles C. Wilson… as Police Officer Ricker\n\nJoseph Crehan… as Detective Johnson\n\nOlin Howland… as Dr. Crocker\n\nWarren William’s final cinematic take on the Perry Mason character is William Clemens’ THE CASE OF THE VELVET CLAWS (1936). This one is unique because we see Perry Mason marry his long-time secretary, Della. But in true Perry Mason form, even their honeymoon is not complete with a mystery and a dead body to mix it up. Mason finds himself taking the case at gunpoint. And after the dead body shows up, it’s he himself who is entangled as a suspect. While this storyline is weaker, the snappy one-liners are fun and Warren William always delivers a charming performance.\n\nSupporting cast:\n\nClaire Dodd… returning as Della Street, Mason’s secretary and now “the Mrs.”\n\nWini Shaw… as Eva Belter\n\nBill Elliott… as Carl Griffin\n\nJoe King… as George C. Belter\n\nAddison Richards… as Frank Locke\n\nEddie Acuff… as Spudsy Drake (note the change-up)\n\nOlin Howland… as Wilbur Strong\n\nIt’s interesting to watch the evolution of this Perry Mason characterization in the four films under Warren Williams’ masterful craft. No doubt it is often more of a manifestation of its times than a strict reflection of Gardner’s writings. Guaranteed, this is a Perry Mason unlike the Raymond Burr of more recent history. But if you’re a fan of Warren William as I am (if you’re not familiar with his talent- by all means, check him out!) and if you’re unfamiliar with his Perry Mason roles, any of these films in this series is worth a viewing."
