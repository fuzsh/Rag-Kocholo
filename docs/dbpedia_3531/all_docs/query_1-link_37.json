Note that the very first Charlie Chan movie was \"House Without a Key\" in 1925, with George Kuwa as Chan. In 1927, \"The Chinese Parrot\" (directed by Paul Leni) starred Sojin Kamiyama as Chan. In 1929 came the third movie, \"Behind That Curtain\", starring E.L. Park as Charlie Chan. 1931 brought this movie, \"Charlie Chan Carries On\", starring Warner Oland in the very first of many movies with him as the Asian detective, and he was later replaced by Sidney Toler and then Roland Winters (there would ultimately be 47 Charlie Chan movies!). Of course, Charlie Chan is one of the most memorable literary creations ever, from author Earl Derr Biggers, but because politically correct-minded people have viewed the character as outdated, the movies are rarely shown, which is a shame! Also, note that this is a \"lost\" film which means that no surviving copies are thought to exist.\n\nNOTE: Click on linked names to see a biography.\n\nImportant Added Info: Note that we have only auctioned six lobby cards from this movie (five scenes and a title card), and four of those showed Oland, and one of those four has now been reconsigned to us! Also note that we have a scan of both the front and the back of this lobby card, which should greatly help you see what defects it has.\n\nCondition: very good to fine. There is a tiny pinhole in the right of the bottom green border and one in the upper left blank border. Otherwise, the card is in really excellent condition. Note that this lobby card is completely unrestored and there is not a single piece of tape on either the front or back!\n\nLearn More about condition grades\n\nPostal Mailing Address:\n\nBruce Hershenson, P.O.
