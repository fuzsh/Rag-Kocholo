        "text": "Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen is a 1981 mystery comedy directed by Clive Donner starring Peter Ustinov, Lee Grant, Richard Hatch, Angie Dickinson, Roddy McDowall, and Brian Keith. It was the first American Charlie Chan film since 1949's Sky Dragon, although the character appeared in several television shows and foreign productions. Chan, once again, was played by a Caucasian, Peter Ustinov, who was also playing Belgian detective Hercule Poirot at the time as well.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen:\n\nFirst Generation Colt Detective Special\n\nThe murderer places a nickel-plated First Generation Colt Detective Special in Bernard Lupowitz's (Michael Fairman) to stage a suicide in a flashback. The killer is revealed to be the Dragon Queen (Angie Dickinson) but her face is never shown. (This is not a spoiler, it's merely backstory.)\n\nThird Generation Colt Detective Special\n\nThe Police Chief (Brian Keith) carries a Third Generation Colt Detective Special as his service weapon.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 60\n\nThe Dragon Queen (Angie Dickinson) is later armed with a Smith & Wesson Model 60. The Police Chief later picks it up.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 36\n\nThe Police Chief's assistant Masten (Paul Ryan) is armed with a Smith & Wesson Model 36.\n\nBauer .25 Automatic"
