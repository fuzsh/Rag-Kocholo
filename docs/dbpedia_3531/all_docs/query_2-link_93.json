Faint and far away, beyond St. James's Park, he had just heard Big Ben on the Houses of Parliament strike the hour of ten. It was the night of February 6, 1930. One must keep in mind the clock and the calendar where chief inspectors are concerned, although in this case the items are relatively unimportant. They will never appear as evidence in court.\n\nThough naturally of a serene and even temperament, Inspector Duff was at the moment in a rather restless mood. Only that morning a long and tedious case had come to an end as he sat in court and watched the judge, in his ominous black cap, sentence an insignificant, sullen-looking little man to the scaffold. Well, that was that, Duff had thought. A cowardly murderer, with no conscience, no human feeling whatever. And what a merry chase he had led Scotland Yard before his final capture. But perseverance had won—that, and a bit of the Duff luck. Getting hold of a letter the murderer had written to the woman in Battersea Park Road, seeing at once the double meaning of a harmless little phrase, seizing upon it and holding on until he had the picture complete. That had done it. All over now. What next?\n\nDuff moved on, his ulster wrapped close about him. Water dripped from the brim of his old felt hat. For the past three hours he had been sitting in the Marble Arch Pavilion, a cinema theater, hoping to be taken out of himself. The story had been photographed in the South Seas—palm-fringed shores, blazing skies, eternal sunshine. As he watched it Duff had thought of a fellow detective, encountered some years before in San Francisco. A modest chap who followed the profession of man-hunting against such a background. Studied clues where the tradewinds whispered in flowering trees and the month was always June. The inspector had smiled gently at the recollection.\n\nWith no definite destination in mind, Duff wandered along down Piccadilly. It was a thoroughfare of memories for him, and now they crowded about him. Up to a short time ago he had been divisional detective-inspector at the Vine Street station, and so in charge of the C.I.D. in this fashionable quarter. The West End had been his hunting preserve. There, looming in dignified splendor through the rain, was the exclusive club where, with a few quiet words, he had taken an absconding banker. A darkened shop front recalled that early morning when he had bent over the French woman, murdered among her Paris gowns. The white facade of the Berkeley brought memories of a cruel blackmailer seized, dazed and helpless, as he stepped from his bath. A few feet up Half Moon Street, before the tube station, Duff had whispered a word into a swarthy man's ear, and seen his face go white. The debonair killer wanted so badly by the New York police had been at breakfast in his comfortable quarters at the Albany when Duff laid a hand on his shoulder. In Prince's restaurant, across the way, the inspector had dined every night for two weeks, keeping a careful eye upon a man who thought that evening clothes concealed successfully the sordid secret in his heart. And here in Piccadilly Circus, to which he had now come, he had fought, one memorable midnight, a duel to the death with the diamond robbers of Hatton Gard.\n\nThe rain increased, lashing against him with a new fury. He stepped into a doorway and stared at the scene before him. London's quiet and restrained version of a Great White Way. The yellow lights of innumerable electric signs blurred uncertainly in the downpour; little pools of water lay shining in the street. Feeling the need of companionship, Duff skirted the circle and disappeared down a darker thoroughfare. A bare two hundred yards from the lights and the traffic he came upon a grim building with iron bars at the ground floor windows and a faintly burning lamp before it. In another moment he was mounting the familiar steps of Vine Street Police Station.\n\nDivisional Inspector Hayley, Duff's successor at this important post, was alone in his room. A spare, weary-looking man, his face brightened at sight of an old friend.\n\n\"Come in, Duff, my boy,\" he said. \"I was feeling the need of a chat.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Duff answered. He removed the dripping hat, the soggy ulster, and sat down. Through the open door into the next room he noted a group of detectives, each armed with a half-penny paper. \"Rather quiet evening, I take it?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank heaven,\" Hayley replied. \"We're raiding a night club a bit later—but that sort of thing, as you know, is our chief diversion nowadays. By the way, I see that congratulations are again in order.\"\n\n\"Congratulations?\" Duff raised his heavy eyebrows.\n\n\"Yes—that Borough case, you know. Special commendation for Inspector Duff from the judge—splendid work—intelligent reasoning—all that sort of thing.\"\n\nDuff shrugged. \"Yes, of course—thanks, old man.\" He took out his pipe and began to fill it. \"But that's in the past—it will be forgotten to-morrow.\" He was silent for a moment, then he added: \"Odd sort of trade, ours, what?\"\n\nHayley gave him a searching look. \"The reaction,\" he nodded. \"Always feel it myself after a hard case. What you need is work, my boy. A new puzzle. No period for reflection between. Now, if you had this post—\"\n\n\"I've had it,\" Duff reminded him.\n\n\"So you have—that's true. But before we dismiss the past from our minds—and it's a good plan, I agree with you—mayn't I add my own humble word of praise? Your work on this case should stand as an example—\"\n\nDuff interrupted him. \"I had luck,\" he said. \"Don't forget that. As our old chief, Sir Frederic Bruce, always put it—hard work, intelligence and luck, and of these three, luck is the greatest by far.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes—poor Sir Frederic,\" Hayley answered.\n\n\"Been thinking about Sir Frederic to-night,\" Duff continued. \"Thinking about him, and the Chinese detective who ran down his murderer.\"\n\nHayley nodded. \"The chap from Hawaii. Sergeant Chan—was that the name?\"\n\n\"Charlie Chan—yes. But he's an inspector now, in Honolulu.\"\n\n\"You hear from him then?\"\n\n\"At long intervals, yes.\" Duff lighted his pipe. \"Busy as I am, I've kept up a correspondence. Can't get Charlie out of my mind, somehow. I wrote him a couple of months ago, asking for news of himself.\"\n\n\"And he answered?\"\n\n\"Yes—the reply came only this morning.\" Duff took a letter from his pocket. \"There are, it appears, no news,\" he added, smiling.\n\nHayley leaned back in his chair. \"None the less, let's hear the letter,\" he suggested.\n\nDuff drew two sheets of paper from the envelope and spread them out. For a moment he stared at those lines typed in another police station on the far side of the world. Then, a faint smile still lingering about his lips, he began to read in a voice strangely gentle for a Scotland Yard inspector:\n\n\"Revered and Honorable Friend:\n\n\"Kindly epistle from you finished long journey with due time elapsed, and brought happy memories of past floating into this despicable mind. What is wealth? Write down list of friends and you have answer. Plenty rich is way I feel when I know you still have space in honorably busy brain for thoughts of most unworthy C. Chan.\n\n\"Turning picture over to inspect other side, I do not forget you. Never. Pardon crude remark which I am now about to inscribe, but such suggestion on your part is getting plenty absurd. Words of praise you once heaped upon me linger on in memory, surrounded always by little glow of unseemly pride.\n\n\"Coming now to request conveyed in letter regarding the news with me, there are, most sorry to report, none whatever. Water falls from the eaves into the same old holes, which is accurate description of life as I encounter it. Homicides do not abound in Honolulu. The calm man is the happy man, and I offer no hot complaint. Oriental knows that there is a time to fish, and a time to dry the nets.\n\n\"But maybe sometimes I get a little anxious because there is so much drying of the nets. Why is that? Can it be that Oriental character is slipping from me owing to fact I live so many years among restless Americans? No matter. I keep the affair hidden. I pursue not very important duties with uncommunicative face. But it can happen that I sit some nights on lanai looking out across sleepy town and suffer strange wish telephone would jangle with important message. Nothing doing, to quote my children, who learn nice English as she is taught in local schools.\n\n\"I rejoice that gods have different fate waiting for you. Often I think of you in great city where it is your lot to dwell. Your fine talents are not allowed to lie like stagnant water. Many times the telephone jangles, and you go out on quest. I know in heart that success will always walk smiling at your side. I felt same when I enjoyed great privilege of your society. Chinese, you know, are very psychic people.\n\n\"How kind of you to burden great mind with inquiry for my children. Summing up quickly, they number now eleven. I am often reminded of wise man who said: To govern a kingdom is easy; to govern a family is difficult. But I struggle onward. My eldest daughter Rose is college student on mainland. When I meet for first time the true cost of American education, I get idea much better to draw line under present list of offspring and total up for ever.\n\n\"Once more my warmest thanks for plenty amiable letter. Maybe some day we meet again, though appalling miles of land and water between us make thought sound dreamy. Accept anyhow this fresh offering of my kind regards. May you have safe walk down every path where duty leads you. Same being wish of\n\n\"Yours, with deep respect,\n\n\"Charlie Chan.\"\n\nDuff finished reading and slowly folded the missive. Looking up, he saw Hayley staring at him, incredulous.\n\n\"Charming,\" said the divisional inspector. \"But—er—a bit naive. You don't mean to tell me that the man who wrote that letter ran down the murderer of Sir Frederic Bruce!\"\n\n\"Don't be deceived by Charlie's syntax,\" Duff laughed. \"He's a bit deeper than he sounds. Patience, intelligence, hard work—Scotland Yard has no monopoly on these. Inspector Chan happens to be an ornament to our profession, Hayley. Pity he's buried in a place like Honolulu.\" The palm-fringed shore he had seen at the cinema flitted before his eyes. \"Though perhaps, at that, the calm man is the happy man.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Hayley answered. \"But we'll never have a chance to test it, you and I. You're not going, are you?\" For Duff had risen.\n\n\"Yes—I'll be getting on to my diggings,\" the chief inspector replied. \"I was rather down when I came in, but I feel better now.\"\n\n\"Not married yet, eh?\" Hayley inquired.\n\n\"Married no end,\" Duff told him. \"Haven't time for anything else. Married to Scotland Yard.\"\n\nHayley shook his head. \"That's not enough. But it's no affair of mine.\" He helped Duff on with his coat. \"Here's hoping you won't be long between cases. Not good for you. When the telephone on your desk—what was it Chan said?—when it jangles with an important message—then, my boy, you'll be keen again.\"\n\n\"Water,\" Duff shrugged, \"dropping from the eaves into the same old holes.\"\n\n\"But you love to hear it drop. You know you do.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded the chief inspector. \"You're quite right. As a matter of fact, I'm not happy unless I do. Good-by, and luck at the night club.\"\n\nAt eight o'clock on the following morning, Inspector Duff walked briskly into his room at Scotland Yard. He was his old cheery self; his cheeks were glowing, a heritage of the days on that Yorkshire farm whence he had come to join the Metropolitan Police. Opening his desk, he ran through a small morning mail. Then he took up his copy of the Telegraph, lighted a good cigar, and began a leisurely perusal of the news.\n\nAt eight-fifteen his telephone jangled suddenly. Duff stopped reading and stared at it. It rang again, sharply, insistently, like a call for help. Duff laid down his paper and picked up the instrument.\n\n\"Morning, old chap.\" It was Hayley's voice. \"Just had a bit of news from my sergeant. Sometime during the night a man was murdered at Broome's Hotel.\"\n\n\"At Broome's,\" Duff repeated. \"You don't mean at Broome's?\"\n\n\"Sounds like an incredible setting for murder, I know,\" Hayley replied. \"But none the less, it's happened. Murdered in his sleep—an American tourist from Detroit, or some queer place like that. I thought of you at once—naturally, after our chat last evening. Then, too, this is your old division. No doubt you know your way about in the rarefied atmosphere of Broome's. I've spoken to the superintendent. You'll get your orders in a moment. Hop into a car with a squad and join me at the hotel at your earliest.\"\n\nHayley rang off. As he did so, Duff's superior came hastily into the room.\n\n\"An American murdered in Half Moon Street,\" he announced. \"At Broome's Hotel, I believe. Mr. Hayley has asked for help and suggested you. A good idea. You'll go at once, Mr. Duff—\"\n\nDuff was already in the doorway, wearing hat and coat. \"On my way, sir.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he heard the superintendent say as he dashed down the stairs.\n\nIn another moment he was climbing into a little green car at the curb. Out of nowhere appeared a fingerprint expert and a photographer. Silently they joined the party. The green car traveled down the brief length of Derby Street and turned to the right on Whitehall.\n\nThe rain of the night before had ceased, but the morning was thick with fog. They crept along through an uncertain world, their ears assailed by the constant honking of motor horns, the shrill cries of police whistles. To right and left the street lamps were burning, pale, ineffectual blobs of yellow against a gloomy gray. Somewhere back of the curtain, London went about its business as usual.\n\nThe scene was in striking contrast with that the inspector had witnessed at the cinema the night before. No blazing sunlight here, no white breakers, no gently nodding palms. But Duff was not thinking of the South Seas. All that was swept from his mind. He sat hunched up in the little car, his eyes trying vainly to pierce the mist that covered the road ahead—the road that was to lead him far. He had completely forgotten everything else—including his old friend, Charlie Chan.\n\nNor was Charlie at that moment thinking of Duff. On the other side of the world this February day had not yet dawned—it was, in fact, the night of the day before. The plump inspector of the Honolulu police was sitting on his lanai, serenely indifferent to fate. From that perch on Punchbowl Hill he gazed across the twinkling lights of the town at the curving shore line of Waikiki, gleaming white beneath the tropic moon. He was a calm man, and this was one of the calmest moments of his life.\n\nHe had not heard the jangle of the telephone on Inspector Duff's desk at Scotland Yard. No sudden vision of the start of that little green car had flashed before him. Nor did he see, as in a dream, a certain high-ceilinged room in Broome's famous London hotel, and on the bed the for ever motionless figure of an old man, strangled by means of a luggage strap bound tightly about his throat.\n\nPerhaps the Chinese are not so very psychic after all.\n\nII. — FOG AT BROOME'S HOTEL\n\nTo speak of Broome's Hotel in connection with the word murder is more or less sacrilege, but unfortunately it must be done. This quaint old hostelry has been standing in Half Moon Street for more than a hundred years, and it is strong in tradition, though weak in central heating and running water. Samuel Broome, it is rumored, started with a single house of the residential type. As the enterprise prospered, more were added, until to-day twelve such houses have been welded into a unit, and Broome's not only has a wide frontage on Half Moon Street, but stretches all the way to Clarges Street in the rear, where there is a second entrance.\n\nThe various residences have been joined in haphazard fashion, and a guest who walks the corridors of the upper floors finds himself in a sort of mystic maze. Here he mounts three steps, there he descends two more, he turns the most eccentric corners, doors and archways bob up before him where he least expects them. It is a bit hard on the servants who carry coals for the open fires, and hot water in old-fashioned cans for the guests who have not been able to secure one of the rare bathrooms, installed as a half-hearted afterthought.\n\nBut do not think that because it lacks in modern comforts, a suite at Broome's is easily secured. To be admitted to this hotel is an accolade, and in the London season an impossible feat for an outsider. Then it is filled to overflowing with good old country families, famous statesmen and writers, a sprinkling of nobility. Once it accommodated an exiled king, but his social connections were admirable. Out of the season, Broome's has of late years let down the bars. Even Americans have been admitted. And now, this foggy February morning, one of them had got himself murdered above-stairs. It was all very distressing.\n\nDuff came through the Half Moon Street entrance into the dim, hushed interior. He felt as though he had stepped inside a cathedral. Taking off his hat, he stood as one awaiting the first notes of an organ. The pink-coated servants, however, who were flitting noiselessly about, rather upset this illusion. No one would ever mistake them for choir-boys. Almost without exception they seemed to date back to the days when Samuel Broome had only one house to his name. Old men who had grown gray at Broome's, thin old men, fat old men, most of them wearing spectacles. Men with the aura of the past about them.\n\nA servant with the bearing of a prime minister rose from his chair behind the porter's desk and moved ponderously toward the inspector.\n\n\"Good morning, Peter,\" Duff said. \"What's all this?\"\n\nPeter shook a gloomy head. \"A most disturbing accident, sir. A gentleman from America—the third story, room number 28, at the rear. Quite defunct, they tell me.\" He lowered his quavering voice. \"It all comes of letting in these outsiders,\" he added.\n\n\"No doubt.\" Duff smiled. \"I'm sorry, Peter.\"\n\n\"We're all sorry, sir. We all feel it quite keenly. Henry!\" He summoned a youngster of seventy who was feeling it keenly on a near-by bench. \"Henry will take you wherever you wish to go, Inspector. If I may say so, it is most reassuring to have the inevitable investigation in such hands as yours.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Duff answered. \"Has Inspector Hayley arrived?\"\n\n\"He is above, sir, in the—in the room in question.\"\n\nDuff turned to Henry. \"Please take these men up to room 28,\" he said, indicating the photographer and the finger-print man who had entered with him. \"I should like a talk first with Mr. Kent, Peter. Don't trouble—he's in his office, I presume?\"\n\n\"I believe he is, sir. You know the way.\"\n\nKent, the managing director of Broome's, was resplendent in morning coat, gray waistcoat and tie. A small pink rose adorned his left lapel. For all that, he appeared to be far from happy. Beside his desk sat a scholarly-looking, bearded man, wrapped in gloomy silence.\n\n\"Come in, Mr. Duff, come in,\" the manager said, rising at once. \"This is a bit of luck, our first this morning. To have you assigned here—that's more than I hoped for. It's a horrible mess, Inspector, a horrible mess. If you will keep it all as quiet as possible, I shall be eternally—\"\n\n\"I know,\" Duff cut in. \"But unfortunately murder and publicity go hand in hand. I should like to learn who the murdered man was, when he got here, who was with him, and any other facts you can give me.\"\n\n\"The chap's name was Hugh Morris Drake,\" answered Kent, \"and he was registered from Detroit—a city in the States, I understand. He arrived on last Monday, the third, coming up from Southampton on a boat train after crossing from New York. With him were his daughter, a Mrs. Potter, also of Detroit, and his granddaughter. Her name—it escapes me for the moment.\" He turned to the bearded man. \"The young lady's name, Doctor Lofton?\"\n\n\"Pamela,\" said the other, in a cold, hard voice.\n\n\"Ah, yes—Miss Pamela Potter. Oh, by the way, Doctor Lofton—may I present Inspector Duff, of Scotland Yard?\" The two men bowed. Kent turned to Duff. \"The doctor can tell you much more about the dead man than I can. About all the party, in fact. You see, he's the conductor.\"\n\n\"The conductor?\" repeated Duff, puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, of course. The conductor of the tour,\" Kent added.\n\n\"What tour? You mean this dead man was traveling in a party, with a courier?\" Duff looked at the doctor.\n\n\"I should hardly call myself a courier,\" Lofton replied. \"Though in a way, of course I am. Evidently, Inspector, you have not heard of Lofton's Round the World Tours, which I have been conducting for some fifteen years, in association with the Nomad Travel Company.\"\n\n\"The information had escaped me,\" Duff answered dryly. \"So Mr. Hugh Morris Drake had embarked on a world cruise, under your direction—\"\n\n\"If you will permit me,\" interrupted Lofton, \"it is not precisely a world cruise. That term is used only in connection with a large party traveling the entire distance aboard a single ship. My arrangements are quite different—various trains and many different ships—and comparatively a very small group.\"\n\n\"What do you call a small group?\" Duff inquired.\n\n\"This year there are only seventeen in the party,\" Lofton told him. \"That is—there were last night. Today, of course, there are but sixteen.\"\n\nDuff's stout heart sank. \"Plenty,\" he commented. \"Now, Doctor Lofton—by the way, are you a medical doctor?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I am a doctor of philosophy. I hold a large number of degrees—\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Has there been any trouble on this tour before last night? Any incident that might lead you to suspect an enmity, a feud—\"\n\n\"Absurd!\" Lofton broke in. He got up and began to pace the floor. \"There has been nothing, nothing. We had a very rough crossing from New York, and the members of the party have really seen very little of one another. They were all practically strangers when they arrived at this hotel last Monday. We have made a few excursions together since, but they are still—Look here, Inspector!\" His calmness had vanished, and his face was flushed and excited beneath the beard. \"This is a horrible position for me. My life work, which I have built up by fifteen years of effort—my reputation, my standing—everything is likely to be smashed by this. In heaven's name, don't begin with the idea that some member of the party killed Hugh Drake. It's possible. Some sneak thief—some hotel servant—\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" cried the manager hotly. \"Look at my servants. They've been with us for years. No employee of this hotel is involved in any way. I'd stake my life on it.\"\n\n\"Then some one from outside,\" Lofton said. His tone was pleading. \"I tell you it couldn't have been any one in my group. My standards are high—the best people, always.\" He laid his hand on Duff's arm. \"Pardon my excitement, Inspector. I know you'll be fair. But this is a serious situation for me.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Duff nodded. \"I'll do all I can for you. But I must question the members of your party as soon as possible. Do you think you could get them together for me in one of the parlors of the hotel?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Lofton replied. \"Some of them may be out at the moment, but I'm certain they'll all be in by ten o'clock. You see, we are taking the ten-forty-five from Victoria, to connect with the Dover-Calais boat.\"\n\n\"You were taking the ten-forty-five from Victoria,\" Duff corrected him.\n\n\"Ah, yes, of course we were leaving at that hour, I should have said. And now—what now, Inspector?\"\n\n\"That's rather difficult to say,\" Duff answered. \"We shall see. I'll go upstairs, Mr. Kent, if I may.\"\n\nHe did not wait for an answer, but went quickly out. A lift operator who was wont to boast of his great-grandchildren took him up to the third floor. In the doorway of room 28, he encountered Hayley.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Duff,\" the man from Vine Street said. \"Come in.\"\n\nDuff entered a large bedroom in which the odor of flashlight powder was strong. The room was furnished in such fashion that, had Queen Victoria entered with him, she would have taken off her bonnet and sat down in the nearest rocking-chair. She would have felt at home. The bed stood in an alcove at the rear, far from the windows. On it lay the body of a man well along in years—the late sixties, Duff guessed. It did not need the luggage strap, still bound about the thin throat of the dead man, to tell Duff that he had died by strangulation, and the detective's keen eyes saw also that the body presented every evidence of a frantic and fruitless struggle. He stood for a moment looking down at his newest puzzle. Outside, the fog was lifting, and from the pavement below came the notes of Silver Threads among the Gold, played by one of the innumerable street orchestras that haunt this section of London.\n\n\"Divisional surgeon been here?\" Duff inquired.\n\n\"Yes—he's made his report and gone,\" Hayley replied. \"He tells me the chap's been dead about four hours.\"\n\nDuff stepped forward and removed, with his handkerchief, the luggage strap, which he handed to the fingerprint man. Then he began a careful examination of all that was mortal of Mr. Hugh Morris Drake, of Detroit. He lifted the left arm, and bent back the clenched fingers of the hand. As he prepared to do the same with the right, an exclamation of interest escaped him. From between the lean stiff fingers something glittered—a link from a slender, platinum watch chain. Duff released the object the right hand was clutching, and it fell to the bed. Three links of the chain, and on the end, a small key.\n\nHayley came close, and together they studied the find as it lay on Duff's handkerchief. On one side of the key was the number \"3260\" and on the other, the words: \"Dietrich Safe and Lock Company, Canton, Ohio.\" Duff glanced at the blank face on the pillow.\n\n\"Good old boy,\" he remarked softly. \"He tried to help us. Tore off the end of his assailant's watch-chain—and kept it, by gad.\"\n\n\"That's something,\" Hayley commented.\n\nDuff nodded. \"Perhaps. But it begins to look too much American for my taste, old chap. I'm a London detective, myself.\"\n\nHe knelt beside the bed for a closer examination of the floor. Some one entered the room, but Duff was for the moment too engrossed to look up. When he finally did so, what he saw caused him to leap to his feet, giving the knees of his trousers a hasty brush in passing. A slender and attractive American girl was standing there, looking at him with eyes which, he was not too busy to note, were something rather special in that line.\n\n\"Ah—er—good morning,\" the detective said.\n\n\"Good morning,\" the girl answered gravely. \"I'm Pamela Potter, and Mr. Drake—was my grandfather. I presume you're from Scotland Yard. Of course you'll want to talk to one of the family.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Duff agreed. Very composed and sure of herself, this girl was, but there were traces of tears about those violet eyes. \"Your mother, I believe, is also with this touring party?\"\n\n\"Mother is prostrated,\" the girl explained. \"She may come round later. But just at present I am the only one who can face this thing. What can I tell you?\"\n\n\"Can you think of any reason for this unhappy affair?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"None whatever. It's quite unbelievable, really. The kindest man in the world—not an enemy. It's preposterous, you know.\"\n\nUp from Clarges Street came the loud strains of There's a Long, Long Trail A-Winding. Duff turned to one of his men. \"Shut that window,\" he ordered sharply. \"Your grandfather was prominent in the life of Detroit?\" he added, to the girl. He spoke the name uncertainly, accenting the first syllable.\n\n\"Oh, yes—for many years. He was one of the first to go into the automobile business. He retired from the presidency of his company five years ago, but he kept a place on the board of directors. For the past few years he has been interested in charitable work—gave away hundreds of thousands. Everybody honored and respected him. Those who knew him loved him.\"\n\n\"He was, I take it, a very wealthy man?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"And who—\" Duff paused. \"Pardon me, but it's a routine question. Who will inherit his money?\"\n\nThe girl stared at Duff. \"Why, I hadn't thought of that at all. But whatever isn't left to charity will, I suppose, go to my mother.\"\n\n\"And in time—to you?\"\n\n\"To me and my brother. I fancy so. What of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I imagine. When did you last see your grandfather? Alive, I mean.\"\n\n\"Just after dinner, last evening. Mother and I were going to the theater, but he didn't care to go. He was tired, he said, and besides he couldn't, poor dear, enjoy a play.\"\n\nDuff nodded. \"I understand. Your grandfather was deaf.\"\n\nThe girl started. \"How did you know—oh—\" Her eyes followed those of the inspector to a table where an earphone, with a battery attached, was lying. Suddenly she burst into tears, but instantly regained her self-control. \"Yes—that was his,\" she added, and reached out her hand.\n\n\"Do not touch it, please,\" Duff said quickly.\n\n\"Oh, I see. Of course not. He wore that constantly, but it didn't help a lot. Last night he told us to go along, that he intended to retire early, as he expected to-day would be tiring—we were all starting for Paris, you know. We warned him not to oversleep—our rooms are on the floor below. He said he wouldn't, that he had arranged with a waiter to wake him every morning just before eight. We were down in the lobby expecting him to join us for breakfast at eight-thirty, when the manager told us—what had happened.\"\n\n\"Your mother was quite overcome?\"\n\n\"Why not—such horrible news? She fainted, and I finally got her back to her room.\"\n\n\"You did not faint?\"\n\nThe girl looked at Duff with some contempt. \"I don't belong to a fainting generation. I was naturally terribly shocked.\"\n\n\"Naturally. May I step out of character to say that I'm frightfully sorry?\"\n\n\"Thank you. What else can I tell you?\"\n\n\"Nothing now. I hope very much that you can arrange for me to see your mother a moment before I go. I must, you understand. But we will give her another hour or so. In the meantime, I am meeting the other members of your travel party in a parlor below. I won't ask you to come—\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" cried the girl. \"Of course I'll come. I'm no weakling, and besides, I want a good look at the members of this party. We haven't had time to get acquainted—the trip across was rather trying. Yes, I'll be there. This thing is too meaningless, too cruel. I shan't rest until I know what is behind it. Anything I can do, Mr.—\"\n\n\"Inspector Duff,\" he answered. \"I'm glad you feel that way. We'll hunt the answer together, Miss Potter.\"\n\n\"And we'll find it,\" she added. \"We've got to.\" For the first time she glanced at the bed. \"He was so—so kind to me,\" she said brokenly, and went quickly out.\n\nDuff stood looking after her. \"Rather a thoroughbred, isn't she?\" he commented to Hayley. \"Amazing how many American girls are. Well, let's see. What have we? A bit of chain and a key. Good as far as it goes.\"\n\nHayley looked rather sheepish. \"Duff, I have been an ass,\" he said. \"There was something else. The surgeon picked it up from the bed—it was lying beside the body. Just carelessly thrown there, evidently.\"\n\n\"What?\" Duff asked tersely.\n\n\"This.\" Hayley handed over a small, worn-looking bag of wash leather, fastened at the top with a slip cord. It was heavy with some mysterious contents. Duff stepped to a bureau, unloosed the cord, and poured the contents out on the bureau top. For a time he stared, a puzzled frown on his face.\n\n\"What—what should you say, Hayley?\"\n\n\"Pebbles,\" Hayley remarked. \"Little stones of various shapes and sizes. Some of them smooth—might have been picked up from a beach.\" He flattened out the pile with his hand. \"Worthless little pebbles, and nothing else.\"\n\n\"A bit senseless, don't you think?\" murmured Duff. He turned to one of his men. \"I say—just count these, and put them back in the bag.\" As the officer set about his task, Duff sat down in an old-fashioned chair, and looked slowly about the room. \"The case has its points,\" he remarked.\n\n\"It has indeed,\" Hayley answered.\n\n\"A harmless old man, making a pleasure trip around the world with his daughter and granddaughter, is strangled in a London hotel. A very deaf, gentle old soul, noted for his kindnesses and his benefactions. He rouses from sleep, struggles, gets hold of part of his assailant's watch-chain. But his strength fails, the strap draws tighter, and the murderer, with one final gesture, throws on to the bed a silly bag of stones. What do you make of it, Hayley?\"\n\n\"I'm rather puzzled, I must say.\"\n\n\"So am I. But I've noted one or two things. You have too, no doubt?\"\n\n\"I was never in your class, Duff.\"\n\n\"Rot. Don't be modest, old chap. You haven't used your eyes, that's all. If a man stood beside a bed, engaged in a mortal struggle with another man, his shoes would disturb the nap of the carpet to some extent. Especially if it were an old thick carpet such as this. There is no indication of any such roughing of the carpet, Hayley.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"None whatever. And—take a look at the bed, if you please.\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" The eyes of the Vine Street man widened. \"I see what you mean. It's been slept in, of course, but—\"\n\n\"Precisely. At the foot and at one side, the covers are still tucked into place. The whole impression is one of neatness and order. Was there a struggle to the death on that bed, Hayley?\"\n\n\"I think not, Duff.\"\n\n\"I'm sure there was not.\" Duff gazed thoughtfully about him. \"Yes—this was Drake's room. His property is all about. His ear-phone is on the table. His clothes are on that chair. But something tells me that Hugh Morris Drake was murdered elsewhere.\"\n\nIII. — THE MAN WITH A WEAK HEART\n\nAfter this surprising statement, Duff was silent for a moment, staring into space. Kent, the hotel manager, appeared in the doorway, his round face still harassed and worried.\n\n\"I thought perhaps I might be of some help here,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Duff replied. \"I should like to interview the person who first came upon this crime.\"\n\n\"I rather thought you might,\" the manager answered. \"The body was found by Martin, the floor waiter. I have brought him along.\" He went to the door and beckoned.\n\nA servant with a rather blank face, much younger than most of his fellows, entered the room. He was obviously nervous.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Duff, taking out his notebook. \"I am Inspector Duff, of Scotland Yard.\" The young man's manner became even more distressed. \"I want you to tell me everything that happened here this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I—I had an arrangement with Mr. Drake,\" Martin began. \"I was to rouse him every morning, there being no telephones in the rooms. He preferred to breakfast below, but he was fearful of oversleeping. A bit of a job it was, sir, to make him hear, him being so deaf. Twice I had to go to the housekeeper for a key, and enter the room.\n\n\"This morning, at a quarter before eight, I knocked at his door. I knocked many times, but nothing happened. Finally I went for the housekeeper's key, but I was told it had disappeared yesterday.\"\n\n\"The housekeeper's key was lost?\"\n\n\"It was, sir. There was another master key below-stairs, and I went for that. I had no thought of anything wrong—I had failed to make him hear me on those other mornings. I unlocked the door of this room and came in. One window was closed, the curtain was down all the way. The other was open and the curtain was up, too. The light entered from there. Everything seemed to be in order—I saw the ear-telephone on the table, Mr. Drake's clothes on a chair. Then I approached the bed, sir—and it was a case of notifying the management immediately. That—that is all I can tell you, Inspector.\"\n\nDuff turned to Kent. \"What is this about the housekeeper's key?\"\n\n\"Rather odd about that,\" the manager said. \"This is an old-fashioned house, as you know, and our maids are not provided with keys to the rooms. If a guest locks his door on going out, the maids are unable to do the room until they have obtained the master key from the housekeeper. Yesterday the lady in room 27, next door, a Mrs. Irene Spicer, also a member of Doctor Lofton's party, went out and locked her door, though she had been requested not to do so by the servants.\n\n\"The maid was forced to secure the housekeeper's key in order to enter. She left it in the lock and proceeded about her work. Later, when she sought the key, it had disappeared. It is still missing.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" smiled Duff. \"It was in use, no doubt, about four o'clock this morning.\" He looked at Hayley. \"Deliberately planned.\" Hayley nodded. \"Any other recent incidents around the hotel,\" he continued to Kent, \"about which we should know?\"\n\nThe manager considered. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Our night-watchman reports two rather queer events that took place during the night. He is no longer a young man and I told him to lie down in a vacant room and get a little rest. I have sent for him, however, and he will see you presently. I prefer that you hear of these things from him.\"\n\nLofton appeared in the doorway. \"Ah, Inspector Duff,\" he remarked. \"I find a few of our party are still out, but I am rounding up everybody possible. They will all be here, as I told you, by ten o'clock. There are a number on this floor, and—\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Duff broke in. \"I am particularly interested in the occupants of the rooms on either side of this one. In 27, Mr. Kent tells me, there is a Mrs. Spicer. Will you kindly see if she is in, Doctor Lofton, and if so, bring her here?\"\n\nLofton went out, and Duff stepped to the bed, where he covered over the face of the dead man. As he returned from the alcove, Lofton reentered, accompanied by a smartly dressed woman of about thirty. She had no doubt been beautiful, but her tired eyes and the somewhat hard lines about her mouth suggested a rather gay past.\n\n\"This is Mrs. Spicer,\" Lofton announced. \"Inspector Duff, of Scotland Yard.\"\n\nThe woman stared at Duff with sudden interest. \"Why should you wish to speak with me?\" she asked.\n\n\"You know what has happened here this morning, I take it?\"\n\n\"I know nothing. I had breakfast in my room, and I have not until this moment been outside it. Of course, I have heard a great deal of talking in here—\"\n\n\"The gentleman who occupied this room was murdered in the night,\" said Duff, tersely, studying her face as he spoke. The face paled.\n\n\"Murdered?\" she cried. She swayed slightly. Hayley was quick with a chair. \"Thank you,\" she nodded mechanically. \"You mean poor old Mr. Drake? Such a charming man. Why—that's—that's terrible.\"\n\n\"It seems rather unfortunate,\" Duff admitted. \"There is only a thin door between your room and this. It was locked at all times, of course?\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"On both sides?\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \"I know nothing of this side. It was always locked on mine.\" Duff's little stratagem had failed.\n\n\"Did you hear any noise in the night? A struggle—a cry, perhaps?\"\n\n\"I heard nothing.\"\n\n\"That's rather odd.\"\n\n\"Why should it be? I am a sound sleeper.\"\n\n\"Then you were probably asleep at the hour the murder took place?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"You're rather clever, aren't you, Inspector? I have, of course, no idea when the murder took place.\"\n\n\"Ah, no—how could you? At about four this morning, we believe. You heard no one talking in this room within—say—the last twenty-four hours?\"\n\n\"Let me think. I went to the theater last night—\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"No—with Mr. Stuart Vivian, who is also in our party. When I returned about twelve everything was very quiet here. But I did hear talking in this room—last evening, while I was dressing for dinner. Quite loud talking.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"It seemed, as a matter of fact, to be almost—a quarrel.\"\n\n\"How many people were involved?\"\n\n\"Only two. Two men. Mr. Drake and—\" She stopped.\n\n\"You recognized the other voice?\"\n\n\"I did. He has a distinctive voice. Doctor Lofton, I mean.\"\n\nDuff turned suddenly to the conductor of the party. \"You had a quarrel with the dead man in this room last evening before dinner?\" he asked sternly. Distress was evident on the doctor's face.\n\n\"Not precisely—I wouldn't call it that,\" he protested. \"I had dropped in to acquaint him with to-day's arrangements, and he began at once to criticize the personnel of the party. He said some of our members were not of the sort he had expected.\"\n\n\"No wonder he said that,\" put in Mrs. Spicer.\n\n\"Naturally, my reputation is dear to me,\" Lofton went on. \"I am not accustomed to that kind of criticism. It is true that this year, owing to bad business conditions at home, I have been forced to accept two or three people who would not ordinarily be taken. But whatever their station in life, they are quite all right, I'm certain. I resented Mr. Drake's remarks, and no doubt the conversation became a bit heated. But it was hardly the type of misunderstanding that would lead to anything\"—he nodded toward the bed—\"like this.\"\n\nDuff turned to the woman. \"You heard none of that conversation?\"\n\n\"I couldn't make out what was said, no. Of course I didn't particularly try. I only know they seemed quite intense and excited.\"\n\n\"Where is your home, Mrs. Spicer?\" Duff inquired.\n\n\"In San Francisco. My husband is a broker there. He was too busy to accompany me on this tour.\"\n\n\"Is this your first trip abroad?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, indeed. I have been over many times. In fact, I've been around the world twice before.\"\n\n\"Really? Great travelers, you Americans. I am asking the members of Doctor Lofton's party to gather in a parlor on the ground floor at once. Will you be good enough to go down there?\"\n\n\"Of course. I'll go immediately.\" She went out.\n\nThe finger-print man came over and handed the luggage strap to Duff. \"Nothing on it, Mr. Duff,\" he remarked. \"Wiped clean and handled with gloves after that, I fancy.\"\n\nDuff held up the strap. \"Doctor Lofton, have you ever noted this strap on the luggage of any of your—er—guests? It appears to be—\" He stopped, surprised at the look on the conductor's face.\n\n\"This is odd,\" Lofton said. \"I have a strap identically like that on one of my old bags. I purchased it just before we sailed from New York.\"\n\n\"Will you go get it, please,\" the inspector suggested.\n\n\"Gladly,\" agreed the doctor, and departed.\n\nThe hotel manager stepped forward. \"I'll go see if the watchman is ready,\" he said.\n\nAs he left the room, Duff looked at Hayley. \"Our conductor seems to be getting into rather deep water,\" he remarked.\n\n\"He was wearing a wrist-watch,\" Hayley said.\n\n\"So I noticed. Has he always worn it—or was there a watch on the end of a platinum chain? Nonsense. The man has everything to lose by this. It may wreck his business. That's a pretty good alibi.\"\n\n\"Unless he is contemplating a change of business,\" Hayley suggested.\n\n\"Yes. In that case, his natural distress over all this would be an excellent cloak. However, why should he mention that he owns a similar strap—\"\n\nLofton returned. He appeared to be slightly upset. \"I'm sorry, Inspector,\" he remarked. \"My strap is gone.\"\n\n\"Really? Then perhaps this one is yours.\" The detective handed it over.\n\nThe doctor examined it. \"I'm inclined to think it is,\" he said.\n\n\"When did you last see it?\"\n\n\"On Monday night, when I unpacked. I put the bag into a dark closet, and haven't touched it since.\" He looked appealingly at Duff. \"Some one is trying to cast suspicion on me.\"\n\n\"No doubt about that. Who has been in your room?\"\n\n\"Everybody. They come in and out, asking questions about the tour. Not that I think any member of my party is involved. The whole of London has had access to my room the past five days. The maids, you will recall, asked us not to lock our doors on going out.\"\n\nDuff nodded. \"Don't distress yourself, Doctor Lofton. I don't believe you would be such a fool as to strangle a man with a strap so readily identified. We'll drop the matter. Now tell me—do you know who has that room there?\" He indicated the connecting door on the other side. \"Room 29, I fancy.\"\n\n\"That is occupied by Mr. Walter Honywood, a very fine gentleman, a millionaire from New York. One of our party.\"\n\n\"If he is in, will you please ask him to step here, and then return to the task of gathering up your people below?\"\n\nAfter the doctor had gone, Duff rose and tried the door leading from Drake's room into number 29. It was locked from the side where he stood.\n\n\"Great pity about the strap,\" Hayley commented softly. \"It lets Doctor Lofton out, I fancy.\"\n\n\"It probably does,\" Duff agreed. \"Unless the man's remarkably subtle—it's my strap—naturally I wouldn't use it—it was stolen from my closet—no, men aren't as subtle as that. But it's rather unfortunate, for I don't feel like making a confidant of the conductor now. And we shall need a confidant in that party before we are finished—\"\n\nA tall handsome man in his late thirties was standing in the doorway leading to the hall. \"I am Walter Honywood of New York,\" he said. \"I'm frightfully distressed about all this. I have, you know, room 29.\"\n\n\"Come in, Mr. Honywood,\" Duff remarked. \"You know what has happened, I perceive.\"\n\n\"Yes. I heard about it at breakfast.\"\n\n\"Please sit down.\" The New Yorker did so. His face was a bit florid for his age, and his hair graying. He had the look of a man who had lived hard in his short life. Duff was reminded of Mrs. Spicer—the deep lines about the mouth, the weary sophisticated light in the eyes.\n\n\"You knew nothing about the matter until you were told at breakfast?\" the detective inquired.\n\n\"Not a thing.\"\n\n\"That's odd, isn't it?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" An expression of alarm flashed across Honywood's face.\n\n\"I mean—in the next room, you know. You heard no cry, no struggle?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I'm a sound sleeper.\"\n\n\"You were sleeping, then, when this murder took place?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Then you know when it took place?\"\n\n\"Well—well, no, of course not. I was merely assuming that I must have been asleep—otherwise I should no doubt have heard—\"\n\nDuff smiled. \"Ah, yes I see. Tell me—the door between your room and this was always locked?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"On both sides?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nDuff lifted his eyebrows. \"How do you know it was locked on this side?\"\n\n\"Why—why, the other morning I heard the floor waiter trying to rouse the old gentleman. I unlocked the door on my side, thinking we could reach him that way. But his side was locked.\"\n\nHonywood's man-of-the-world air had deserted him. He was perspiring, and his face had turned a sickly gray. Duff watched him with deep interest.\n\n\"I seem to have heard your name somewhere.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. I'm a theatrical producer in New York, and I've done a little of that sort of thing in London. No doubt you have heard also of my wife—Miss Sybil Conway, the actress. She has appeared on your side.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Is she with you?\"\n\n\"She is not. We had a slight disagreement about two months ago, and she left me and came over to San Remo, on the Italian Riviera. She is there now. Our tour touches there, and I am hoping to see her, smooth over our difficulties, and persuade her to go the rest of the way around the world with me.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Duff nodded. The New Yorker had taken out a cigarette, and was holding a lighter to it. His hand trembled violently. Looking up, he saw the detective staring at him.\n\n\"This affair has been a great shock to me,\" he explained. \"I got to know Mr. Drake on the boat, and I liked him. Then too, I am not in the best of health. That is why I came on this tour. After my wife left me, I had a nervous breakdown, and my doctor suggested travel.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Duff. \"But it's rather odd, isn't it, Mr. Honywood, that a man who has just had a nervous breakdown should be such—a sound sleeper?\"\n\nHonywood appeared startled. \"I—I have never had any trouble that way,\" he replied.\n\n\"You're very fortunate,\" Duff told him. \"I am meeting all the members of your party on the ground floor.\" He explained this again, and sent the New Yorker below to await him. When the man was out of hearing Duff turned to Hayley.\n\n\"What do you make of that, old chap?\" he inquired.\n\n\"In a frightful funk, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"I don't believe I ever saw a man in a worse,\" Duff agreed. \"He knows a lot more than he's telling, and he's a badly rattled lad. But confound it, that's not evidence. Slowly, old man—we must go slowly—but we mustn't forget Mr. Honywood. He knew when the murder took place, he knew that the door was locked on both sides. And he has been suffering from a nervous breakdown—we'll have to admit he looks it—yet he sleeps as soundly as a child. Yes, we must keep Mr. Honywood in mind.\"\n\nKent came in again, this time accompanied by an old servant who was built along the general lines of Mr. Pickwick.\n\n\"This is Eben, our night-watchman,\" the manager explained. \"You'll want to hear his story, Inspector?\"\n\n\"At once,\" Duff answered. \"What have you to tell, Eben?\"\n\n\"It's this way, sir,\" the old man began. \"I make my rounds of the house every hour, on the hour, punching the clocks. When I came on to this floor last night, on my two o'clock round, I saw a gentleman standing before one of the doors.\"\n\n\"Which door?\"\n\n\"I'm a bit confused about it, sir, but I think it was number 27.\"\n\n\"Twenty-seven. That's the Spicer woman's room. Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, when he heard me, he turned quickly and came toward where I was standing, at the head of the stairs. 'Good evening,' he said. 'I'm afraid I'm on the wrong floor. My room is below.' He had the air of a gentleman, a guest, so I let him pass. I fancy I should have questioned him, sir, but here at Broome's we have never had any queer doings—up to now—so I didn't think of it.\"\n\n\"You saw his face?\"\n\n\"Quite clearly, sir. The light was burning in the corridor. I saw him, and I can identify him if he is still about.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Duff rose. \"We'll have you look over the members of Doctor Lofton's party immediately.\"\n\n\"One moment, sir. I had another little adventure.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did? What was that?\"\n\n\"On my four o'clock round, when I reached this floor, the light was no longer burning. Everything was black darkness. 'Burnt out,' I thought, and I reached for my electric torch. Suddenly, as I put my hand to my pocket, I was conscious of some one standing at my side. Just felt him there, sir, breathing hard in the quiet night. I got the torch out and flashed it on. I saw the person was wearing gray clothes, sir—and then the torch was knocked from my hand. We struggled there, at the top of the stairs—but I'm not so young as I once was. I did get hold of the pocket of his coat—the right-hand pocket—trying to capture him and he trying to break away. I heard the cloth tear a bit. Then he struck me and I fell. I was out for a second, and when I knew where I was again, he had gone.\"\n\n\"But you are certain that he wore a gray suit? And that you tore the right-hand pocket of his coat?\"\n\n\"I'd swear to those two points, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you get any idea at this time that you were dealing with the same man you had encountered on your two o'clock round?\"\n\n\"I couldn't be sure of that, sir. The second one seemed a bit heavier. But that might have been my imagination, as it were.\"\n\n\"What did you do next?\"\n\n\"I went down-stairs and told the night porter. Together we searched the entire house as thoroughly as we could without disturbing any of the guests. We found no one. We debated about the police—but this is a very respectable and famous hotel, sir, and it seemed best—\"\n\n\"Quite right, too,\" the manager put in.\n\n\"It seemed best to keep out of the daily press, if possible. So we did nothing more then, but of course I reported both incidents to Mr. Kent when he arrived this morning.\"\n\n\"You've been with Broome's a long time, Eben?\" Duff inquired.\n\n\"Forty-eight years, sir. I came here as a boy of fourteen.\"\n\n\"A splendid record,\" the inspector said. \"Will you please go now and wait in Mr. Kent's office. I shall want you later on.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, sir,\" the watchman replied, and went out.\n\nDuff turned to Hayley. \"I'm going down to meet that round the world crowd,\" he remarked. \"If you don't mind a suggestion, old chap, you might get a few of your men in from the station and, while I'm holding these people below-stairs, have a look at their rooms. Mr. Kent will no doubt be happy to act as your guide.\"\n\n\"I should hardly put it that way,\" said Kent gloomily. \"However, if it must be done—\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it must. A torn bit of watch-chain—a gray coat with the pocket ripped—it's hardly likely you'll succeed, Hayley. But of course we dare not overlook anything.\" He turned to the finger-print expert and the photographer, who were still on the scene. \"You lads finished yet?\"\n\n\"Just about, sir,\" the finger-print man answered.\n\n\"Wait for me here, both of you, and clear up all odds and ends,\" Duff directed. He went with Hayley and Kent into the hall. There he stood, looking about him. \"Just four rooms on this corridor,\" he remarked. \"Rooms 27, 28 and 29, occupied by Mrs. Spicer, poor Drake and Honywood. Can you tell me who has room 30—the only one remaining? The one next to Honywood?\"\n\n\"That is occupied by a Mr. Patrick Tait,\" Kent replied. \"Another member of the Lofton party. A man of about sixty, very distinguished-looking—for an American. I believe he has been a well-known criminal lawyer in the States. Unfortunately he suffers from a weak heart, and so he is accompanied by a traveling companion—a young man in the early twenties. But you'll see Mr. Tait below, no doubt—and his companion too.\"\n\nDuff went alone to the first floor. Doctor Lofton was pacing anxiously up and down before a door. Beyond, Duff caught a glimpse of a little group of people waiting amid faded red-plush splendor.\n\n\"Ah, Inspector,\" the doctor greeted him. \"I haven't been able to round up the entire party as yet. Five or six are still missing, but as it's nearly ten, they should be in soon. Here is one of them now.\"\n\nA portly, dignified man came down the corridor from the Clarges Street entrance. His great shock of snow-white hair made him appear quite distinguished—for an American.\n\n\"Mr. Tait,\" said Lofton, \"meet Inspector Duff, of Scotland Yard.\"\n\nThe old man held out his hand. \"How do you do, sir?\" He had a deep booming voice. \"What is this I hear? A murder? Incredible. Quite incredible. Who—may I ask—who is dead?\"\n\n\"Just step inside, Mr. Tait,\" Duff answered. \"You'll know the details in a moment. A rather distressing affair—\"\n\n\"It is, indeed.\" Tait turned and with a firm step crossed the threshold of the parlor. For a moment he stood, looking about the group inside. Then he gave a strangled little cry, and pitched forward on to the floor.\n\nDuff was the first to reach him. He turned the old man over, and with deep concern noted his face. It was as blank as that of the dead man in room 28.\n\nIV. — DUFF OVERLOOKS A CLUE\n\nThe next instant a young man was at Duff's side, a good-looking American with frank gray eyes, now somewhat startled. Removing a small, pearl-like object from a bottle, he crushed it in his handkerchief, and held the latter beneath the nose of Mr. Patrick Tait.\n\n\"Amyl nitrite,\" he explained, glancing up at the inspector. \"It will bring him around in a moment, I imagine. It's what he told me to do if he had one of these attacks.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. You are Mr. Tait's traveling companion?\"\n\n\"I am. My name's Mark Kennaway. Mr. Tait is subject to this sort of thing, and that is why he employed me to come with him.\" Presently the man on the floor stirred and opened his eyes. He was breathing heavily and his face was whiter than his shock of snowy hair.\n\nDuff had noted a door on the opposite side of the room and crossing to it, he discovered that it led to a smaller parlor, among the furnishings of which was a broad and comfortable couch. \"Best get him in here, Mr. Kennaway,\" he remarked. \"He's still too shaky to go up-stairs.\" Without another word, he picked the old man up in his arms and carried him to the couch. \"You stay here with him,\" Duff suggested. \"I'll talk to you both a little later.\" Returning to the larger room, he closed the door behind him.\n\nFor a moment he stood looking about the main lounge of Broome's Hotel. Plenty of red plush and walnut had been the scheme of the original decorator, and it had remained undisturbed through the years. There was a bookcase with a few dusty volumes, a pile of provincial papers on a table, on the walls a number of sporting prints, their once white mats yellowed by time.\n\nThe group of very modern people who sat now in this musty room were regarding Inspector Duff with serious and, it seemed to him, rather anxious eyes. Outside the sun had at last broken through the fog, and a strong light entered through the many-paned windows, illuminating these faces that were to be the chief study of the detective for a long time to come.\n\nHe turned to Lofton. \"Some of your party are still missing?\"\n\n\"Yes—five. Not counting the two in the next room—and of course, Mrs. Potter.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" shrugged Duff. \"We may as well get started.\" He drew a small table into the middle of the floor, and sitting down beside it, took out his notebook. \"I presume every one here knows what has happened. I refer to the murder of Mr. Drake in room 28 last night.\" No one spoke, and Duff continued. \"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Inspector Duff, of Scotland Yard. I may say, first of all, that this entire group, and all the other members of your party, must remain together here at Broome's Hotel until released by the authorities at the Yard.\"\n\nA little man, with gold-rimmed eyeglasses, leaped to his feet. \"Look here, sir,\" he cried in a high shrill voice, \"I propose to leave the party immediately. I am not accustomed to being mixed up with murder. In Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where I come from—\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Duff coldly. \"Thank you. I scarcely knew where to begin. We will start with you.\" He took out a fountain pen. \"Your name, please?\"\n\n\"My name is Norman Fenwick.\" He pronounced it Fennick.\n\n\"Spell the last name, if you will.\"\n\n\"F-e-n-w-i-c-k. It's an English name, you know.\"\n\n\"Are you English?\"\n\n\"English descent, yes. My ancestors came to Massachusetts in 1650. During the Revolution they were all loyal to the mother country.\"\n\n\"That,\" smiled Duff grimly, \"was some time ago. It will hardly enter into the present case.\" He stared with some distaste at the little man who was so obviously eager to curry favor with the British. \"Are you traveling alone?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not. My sister is with me.\" He indicated a colorless, gray-haired woman. \"Miss Laura Fenwick.\"\n\nDuff wrote again. \"Now tell me, do either of you know anything about last night's affair?\"\n\nMr. Fenwick bristled. \"Just what do you mean by that, sir?\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" the inspector protested. \"I've a bit of a job here and no time to waste. Did you hear anything, see anything, or even sense anything that might have some bearing on the case?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir, and I can answer for my sister.\"\n\n\"Have you been out of the hotel this morning? Yes? Where?\"\n\n\"We went for a stroll through the West End. A last look at London. We are both quite fond of the city. That's only natural, since we are of British origin—\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Pardon me, I must get on—\"\n\n\"But one moment, Inspector. We desire to leave this party at once. At once, sir. I will not associate—\"\n\n\"I have told you what you must do. That matter is settled.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. I shall interview our ambassador. He's an old friend of my uncle's—\"\n\n\"Interview him by all means,\" snapped Duff. \"Who is next? Miss Pamela, we have had our chat. And Mrs. Spicer—I have seen you before. That gentleman next to you—\"\n\nThe man answered for himself. \"I am Stuart Vivian, of Del Monte, California.\" He was bronzed, lean, and would have been handsome had it not been for a deep scar across the right side of his forehead. \"I must say that I'm quite in sympathy with Mr. Fenwick. Why should we be put under restraint in this affair? Myself, I was a complete stranger to the murdered man—I'd never even spoken to him. I don't know any of these others, either.\"\n\n\"With one exception,\" Duff reminded him.\n\n\"Ah—er—yes. With one exception.\"\n\n\"You took Mrs. Spicer to the theater last evening?\"\n\n\"I did. I knew her before we came on this tour.\"\n\n\"You planned the tour together?\"\n\n\"A ridiculous question,\" the woman flared.\n\n\"Aren't you rather overstepping the bounds?\" cried Vivian angrily. \"It was quite a coincidence. I hadn't seen Mrs. Spicer for a year, and imagine my surprise to come on to New York and find her a member of the same party. Naturally there was no reason why we shouldn't go on.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" answered Duff amiably. \"You know nothing about Mr. Drake's murder?\"\n\n\"How could I?\"\n\n\"Have you been out of the hotel this morning?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I took a stroll—wanted to buy some shirts at the Burlington Arcade.\"\n\n\"Make any other purchases?\"\n\n\"I did not.\"\n\n\"What is your business, Mr. Vivian?\"\n\n\"I have none. Play a bit of polo now and then.\"\n\n\"Got that scar on the polo field, no doubt?\"\n\n\"I did. Had a nasty spill a few years back.\"\n\nDuff looked about the circle. \"Mr. Honywood, just one more question for you.\"\n\nHonywood's hand trembled as he removed the cigarette from his mouth. \"Yes, Inspector?\"\n\n\"Have you been out of the hotel this morning?\"\n\n\"No, I—I haven't. After breakfast I came in here and looked over some old copies of the New York Tribune.\"\n\n\"Thank you. That gentleman next to you?\" Duff's gaze was on a middle-aged man with a long hawk-like nose and strikingly small eyes. Though he was dressed well enough and seemed completely at ease, there was that about him which suggested he was somewhat out of place in this gathering.\n\n\"Captain Ronald Keane,\" he said.\n\n\"A military man?\" Duff inquired.\n\n\"Why—er—yes—\"\n\n\"I should say he is a military man,\" Pamela Potter put in. She glanced at Duff. \"Captain Keane told me he was once in the British army, and had seen service in India and South Africa.\"\n\nDuff turned to the captain. \"Is that true?\"\n\n\"Well—\" Keane hesitated. \"No, not precisely. I may have been—romancing a bit. You see—on board a ship—a pretty girl—\"\n\n\"I understand,\" nodded the detective. \"In such a situation one tries to impress, regardless of the truth. It has been done before. Were you ever in any army, Captain Keane?\"\n\nAgain Keane hesitated. But the Scotland Yard man was in too close touch with records to make further lying on this point advisable. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I—er—the title is really honorary. It means—er—little or nothing.\"\n\n\"What is your business?\"\n\n\"I haven't any at present. I've been—an engineer.\"\n\n\"How did you happen to come on this tour?\"\n\n\"Why—for pleasure, of course.\"\n\n\"I trust you are not disappointed. What do you know about last night's affair?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing.\"\n\n\"I presume that you, too, have been out for a stroll this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. I cashed a check at the American Express Office.\"\n\n\"You were supposed to carry only Nomad checks,\" put in Doctor Lofton, his business sense coming to the fore.\n\n\"I had a few of the others,\" Keane replied. \"Is there any law against that?\"\n\n\"The matter was mentioned in our agreement—\" began Lofton, but Duff cut him off.\n\n\"There remains only the gentleman in the corner,\" said the detective. He nodded toward a tall man in a tweed suit. This member of the party had a heavy walking-stick, and one leg was stiff in front of him. \"What is your name, sir?\" Duff added.\n\n\"John Ross,\" the other replied. \"I'm a lumber man from Tacoma, Washington. Been looking forward to this trip for years, but I never dreamed it would be anything like this. My life's an open book, Inspector. Give the word, and I'll read aloud any page you select.\"\n\n\"Scotch, I believe?\" Duff suggested.\n\n\"Does the burr still linger?\" Ross smiled. \"It shouldn't—Lord knows I've been in America long enough. I see you're looking at my foot, and since we're all explaining our scars and our weaknesses, I'll tell you that when I was down in the redwoods some months ago, I was foolish enough to let a tree fall on my right leg. Broke a lot of bones, and they haven't knitted as they should.\"\n\n\"That's a pity. Know anything about this murder?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Inspector. Sorry I can't help you. Nice old fellow, this Drake. I got pretty well acquainted with him on the ship—he and I both had rather good stomachs. I liked him a lot.\"\n\n\"I imagine that you, too—\"\n\nRoss nodded. \"Yes—I went for a walk this morning. Fog and all. Interesting little town you've got here, Inspector. Ought to be out on the Pacific Coast.\"\n\n\"Wish we could bring the coast here,\" Duff replied. \"Climate especially.\"\n\nRoss sat up with interest. \"You've been there, Inspector?\"\n\n\"Briefly—a few years ago.\"\n\n\"What did you think of us?\" the lumber man demanded.\n\nDuff laughed, and shook his head. \"Ask me some other time,\" he said. \"I've more pressing matters to occupy me now.\" He stood up. \"You will all wait here just for a moment,\" he added, and went out.\n\nFenwick went over to Doctor Lofton. \"See here—you've got to give us our money back on this tour,\" he began, glaring through his thick glasses.\n\n\"Why so?\" inquired Lofton suavely.\n\n\"Do you suppose we're going on after this?\"\n\n\"The tour is going on,\" Lofton told him. \"Whether you go or not rests with you. I have been making this trip for many years, and death is not altogether an unknown occurrence among the members of my parties. That it happens to be a murder in this case in no way alters my plans. We shall be delayed for a time in London but that is, of course, an act of God. Read your contract with me, Mr. Fenwick. Not responsible for acts of God. I shall get the party around the world in due course, and if you choose to drop out, there will be no rebate.\"\n\n\"An outrage,\" Fenwick cried. He turned to the others. \"We'll get together. We'll take it up with the Embassy.\" But no one seemed to be in a mood to match his.\n\nDuff returned, and with him came Eben, the night-watchman.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the inspector began, \"I have asked this man to look you over and see if he can identify a certain person who, at two o'clock last night, was a trifle confused as to the whereabouts of his room. A person who, in point of fact, was wandering about the floor on which the murder took place.\"\n\nHe turned to Eben, who was grimly studying the faces of the men in that old-fashioned parlor. The servant stared at Lofton, then at Honywood, at Ross, the lumber man, and at Vivian, the polo player. He gave the weak face of Fenwick but a fleeting glance.\n\n\"That's him,\" said Eben firmly, pointing at Captain Ronald Keane.\n\nKeane sat up. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean it's you I met on my two o'clock round. You told me you'd got on to that floor by mistake, thinking it was your own.\"\n\n\"Is this true?\" Duff asked sternly.\n\n\"Why—\" Keane looked anxiously about him. \"Why, yes—I was up there. You see, I couldn't sleep, and I wanted a book to read.\"\n\n\"That's pretty old—that wanted-a-book-to-read stuff,\" the detective reminded him.\n\n\"I fancy it is,\" returned Keane with a sudden show of spirit. \"But it happens occasionally—among literate people I mean. I knew Tait had a lot of books—that young fellow reads to him until late at night. I found it out on the boat. I knew, too, that he was on the third floor, though I wasn't sure of the room. I just thought I'd go up there and listen outside the doors, and if I heard any one reading, I'd go in and borrow something. Well, I didn't hear a thing, so I decided it was too late. When I met this watchman here, I was on my way back to the floor below.\"\n\n\"Why the statement about being confused as to the location of your room?\" Duff wanted to know.\n\n\"Well, I couldn't very well take up the subject of my literary needs with a servant. He wouldn't have been interested. I just said the first thing that came into my head.\"\n\n\"Rather a habit with you, I judge,\" Duff remarked. He stood for a moment staring at Keane. A mean face, a face that he somehow didn't care for at all, and yet he had to admit that this explanation sounded plausible enough. But he resolved to keep an eye on this man. A sly wary sort, and the truth was not in him.\n\n\"Very good,\" the detective said. \"Thank you, Eben. You may go now.\" He thought of Hayley, still searching above. \"You will all remain here until I release you,\" he added, and ignoring a chorus of protest, walked briskly over and stepped into the smaller parlor.\n\nAs he closed the connecting door behind him, he saw Patrick Tait sitting erect on the couch, a glass of spirits in his hand. Kennaway was hovering solicitously about.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Tait,\" Duff remarked. \"I am happy to see you are better.\"\n\nThe old man nodded his head. \"Nothing,\" he said. \"Nothing at all.\" The booming voice was a feeble murmur now. \"I am subject to these spells—that is why I have this boy with me. He will take good care of me, I'm sure. A little too much excitement, perhaps. Murder, you know—I hardly bargained for that.\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" the inspector agreed, and sat down. \"If you're quite well enough now, sir—\"\n\n\"Just a moment.\" Tait held up his hand. \"You will pardon my curiosity, I'm sure. But I still don't know who was killed, Mr. Duff.\"\n\nThe detective gave him a searching look. \"You're sure you are strong enough—\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Tait answered. \"It means nothing to me, one way or the other. To whom did this appalling thing happen?\"\n\n\"It happened to Mr. Hugh Morris Drake, of Detroit,\" said Duff.\n\nTait bowed his head, and was silent for a moment. \"I knew him, very slightly, for many years,\" he remarked at last. \"A man of unsullied past, Inspector, and with the most humanitarian impulses. Why should any one want to remove him? You are faced by an interesting problem.\"\n\n\"And a difficult one,\" Duff added. \"I should like to discuss it with you for a moment. You occupy, I believe, room 30, which is near the spot where the unfortunate affair occurred. At what time did you retire for the night?\"\n\nTait looked at the boy. \"About twelve, wasn't it, Mark?\"\n\nKennaway nodded. \"Or a few minutes after, perhaps. You see, Inspector, I go to Mr. Tait's room every evening and read him to sleep. Last night I began to read at ten, and at a few minutes past twelve he was sleeping soundly. So I slipped out, and went to my own room on the second floor.\"\n\n\"What do you read, mostly?\" asked Duff, interested.\n\n\"Mystery stories,\" Kennaway smiled.\n\n\"To a man with a bad heart? I should think the excitement—\"\n\n\"Bah,\" put in Tait. \"There's little enough excitement in the things. I have been a criminal lawyer for many years back home, and as far as the word murder goes—\" He stopped suddenly.\n\n\"You were about to say,\" suggested Duff gently, \"that murder is not, where you are concerned, an exciting topic.\"\n\n\"What if I was?\" demanded Tait, rather warmly.\n\n\"I was only wondering,\" continued Duff, \"why this particular murder brought on such a serious spell this morning?\"\n\n\"Oh, well—meeting it in one's own life is quite different from reading about it in books. Or even from talking about it in a courtroom.\"\n\n\"Quite, quite,\" agreed Duff. He was silent, drumming with his fingers on the arm of his chair. Suddenly he turned, and with the speed and precision of a machine-gun began to fire questions at the lawyer.\n\n\"You heard nothing on that third floor last night?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"No outcry? No call for help?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I tell you.\"\n\n\"No scream from an old man brutally attacked?\"\n\n\"I have told you, sir—\"\n\n\"I am asking you, Mr. Tait. I meet you in the hallway, and you appear to be strong and well. You have heard rumors of a murder, but you do not know who was killed. You walk with a firm step to the doorway of the parlor. You glance around the faces inside, and in another moment you are on the floor, in what seems a mortal attack.\"\n\n\"They come like that—\"\n\n\"Do they? Or did you see some one in that room—\"\n\n\"No! No!\"\n\n\"Some face, perhaps—\"\n\n\"I tell you, no!\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were blazing, the hand that held the glass trembled. Kennaway came forward.\n\n\"Inspector, I beg your pardon,\" he said quietly. \"You are going too far. This man is ill—\"\n\n\"I know,\" admitted Duff softly. \"I'm sorry. I was wrong, and I apologize. I forgot, you see—I have my job to do, and I forgot.\" He arose. \"None the less, Mr. Tait,\" he added, \"I think that some surprising situation dawned upon you as you stood in that doorway this morning, and I intend to find out what it was.\"\n\n\"It is your privilege to think anything you please, sir,\" replied the old man, and as Duff went out he carried a picture of the great criminal lawyer, gray of face and breathing heavily, sitting on a Victorian sofa and defying Scotland Yard.\n\nHayley was waiting in the lobby. \"Been through the rooms of every man in the party,\" he reported. \"No fragment of watch-chain. No gray coat with a torn pocket. Nothing.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Duff replied. \"Practically every mother's son of 'em has been out of the hotel this morning, and naturally any evidence like that went with them.\"\n\n\"I really must get back to my duties at Vine Street,\" Hayley went on. \"You'll drop in after you've finished, old man?\"\n\nDuff nodded. \"Go along. What was it that street orchestra was playing? There's a Long, Long Trail A-Winding. It's true, Hayley. Damned true.\"\n\n\"I'm very much afraid it is,\" the other answered. \"See you at the station.\"\n\nAs Duff turned, his worried frown disappeared. Pamela Potter was beckoning to him from the parlor doorway. He went over to her at once.\n\n\"I was wondering, Inspector,\" she said, \"if you want to see mother now, I believe I can arrange it.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he answered. \"I'll go up with you in a moment.\" He stepped inside the parlor, and with one final warning against leaving Broome's Hotel for the present, he dismissed the assembled crowd. \"I shall want to see the five remaining members of your party,\" he said to Lofton.\n\n\"Of course. The moment they come in, I'll let you know,\" Lofton agreed. He went on down the lobby, with Fenwick still arguing at his heels.\n\nAt the door of the suite occupied by Pamela Potter and her mother, Duff waited while the girl went inside. After several moments, during which he heard the sounds of a discussion going on beyond the door, the young woman returned and admitted him.\n\nThe shades were all drawn in the sitting-room where he now found himself. Gradually accustoming his eyes to the gloom, he perceived, on a chaise lounge in the darkest corner, the figure of a woman. He stepped nearer.\n\n\"This is Inspector Duff, Mother,\" said Pamela Potter.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered the woman faintly.\n\n\"Mrs. Potter,\" remarked the detective, feeling rather ill at ease, \"I am extremely sorry to trouble you. But it can not be avoided.\"\n\n\"I fancy not,\" she replied. \"Won't you be seated? You won't mind the curtains being down, I hope. I'm afraid I'm not looking my best after this terrible shock.\"\n\n\"I have already talked with your daughter,\" continued Duff, moving a chair as close to the couch as he dared, \"so I shan't be here more than a moment. If there is anything you can tell me about this affair, I assure you that it is very important you should do so. Your knowledge of the past is, of course, a trifle more extensive than that of Miss Pamela. Had your father any enemy?\"\n\n\"Poor father,\" the woman said. \"Pamela, the smelling salts.\" The girl produced a green bottle. \"He was a saint, Mr.—er—what did you say his name was, my dear?\"\n\n\"Mr. Duff, Mother.\"\n\n\"My father was a saint on earth if ever there was one. Not an enemy in the world. Really, I never heard of anything so senseless in all my life.\"\n\n\"But there must be sense in it somewhere, Mrs. Potter. It is for us to find out. Something in your father's past—\" Duff paused, and took from his pocket a wash leather bag. \"I wonder if we might have that curtain up just a little way?\" he added to the girl.\n\n\"Certainly,\" she said, and raised it.\n\n\"I'm sure I look a fright,\" protested the woman.\n\nDuff held out the bag. \"See, Madam—we found this on the bed beside your father.\"\n\n\"What in the world is it?\"\n\n\"A simple little bag, Mrs. Potter, of wash leather—chamois, I believe you call it.\" He poured some of the contents into the palm of his hand. \"It was filled with a hundred or more pebbles, or small stones. Do they mean anything to you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. What do they mean to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing, unfortunately. But—think, please, Mrs. Potter. Your father was never, for example, engaged in mining?\"\n\n\"If he was, I never heard of it.\"\n\n\"These pebbles could have no connection with automobiles?\"\n\n\"How could they? Pamela—this—pillow—\"\n\n\"I'll fix it, Mother.\"\n\nDuff sighed, and returned the bag to his pocket. \"You did not mingle, on the boat, with the other members of the travel party?\"\n\n\"I never left my cabin,\" the woman said. \"Pamela here was constantly wandering about. Talking with all sorts of people, when she should have been with me.\"\n\nThe detective took out the fragment of watch-chain, with the key attached. He handed it to the girl. \"You did not, I suppose, happen to notice that chain on any one with whom you talked?\"\n\nShe examined it, and shook her head. \"No. Who looks at a man's watch-chain?\"\n\n\"The key means nothing to you?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Please show it to your mother. Have you ever seen that chain or key before, Madam?\"\n\nThe woman shrugged. \"No, I haven't. The world is full of keys. You'll never get anywhere that way.\"\n\nDuff restored this clue to his pocket and stood up. \"That is all, I fancy,\" he remarked.\n\n\"The whole affair is utterly senseless, I tell you,\" the woman said complainingly. \"There is no meaning to it. I hope you get to the bottom of it, but I don't believe you ever will.\"\n\n\"I shall try, at any rate,\" Duff assured her. And he went out, conscious of having met a vain and very shallow woman. The girl followed him into the hall.\n\n\"I thought it would be better for you to see mother,\" she said. \"So you might understand that I happen to be spokesman for the family, sort of in charge, if you care to put it that way. Poor mother has never been strong.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Duff answered. \"I shall try not to trouble her again. It's you and I together, Miss Pamela.\"\n\n\"For grandfather's sake,\" she nodded gravely.\n\nDuff returned to room 28. His two assistants were waiting, their paraphernalia packed.\n\n\"All finished, Mr. Duff,\" the finger-print man told him. \"And very little, I fear, sir. This, however, is rather odd.\" He handed to the inspector the ear-phone of the dead man.\n\nDuff took it. \"What about this?\"\n\n\"Not a print on it,\" the other said. \"Not even that of the man on the bed. Wiped clean.\"\n\nDuff stared at the instrument. \"Wiped clean, eh? I wonder now. If the old gentleman and his ear-phone were in some other part of the hotel—if he was killed there, and then moved back here—and the ear-phone was carried back to—\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir,\" the assistant remarked.\n\nDuff smiled: \"I was only thinking aloud. Come on, boys. We must be getting along.\" He returned the ear-phone to the table.\n\nThough he did not suspect it at the moment, he had just held in his hand the key to his mystery. It had been Hugh Morris Drake's deafness that led to his murder in Broome's Hotel.\n\nV. — LUNCHEON AT THE MONICO\n\nWhen they reached the ground floor, Duff directed his two assistants to return to the Yard at once with their findings, and then send the chauffeur back with the green car to await his own departure from Broome's. He began a round of the corridors, and came presently upon Doctor Lofton, who still had an upset and worried air.\n\n\"The other five members of the party are here,\" the doctor announced. \"I've got them waiting in that same parlor. I hope you can see them now, as they are rather restless.\"\n\n\"At once,\" answered Duff amiably, and together with Lofton, entered the familiar room.\n\n\"You people know what has happened,\" the conductor said. \"This is Inspector Duff, of Scotland Yard. He wants to talk with you. Inspector, Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Benbow, Mr. and Mrs. Max Minchin and Mrs. Latimer Luce.\"\n\nThe inspector stood regarding this oddly assorted group. Funny lot, these Americans, he was thinking: all types, all races, all classes of society, traveling together in apparent peace and amity. Well, that was the melting-pot for you. He was reaching for his notebook when the man named Elmer Benbow rushed up and pumped enthusiastically at his hand.\n\n\"Pleased to meet you, Inspector,\" he cried. \"Say, this will be something to tell when we get back to Akron. Mixed up in a murder—Scotland Yard and all that—just like I've been reading about in your English mystery novels. I read a lot of 'em. My wife tells me they won't improve my mind, but when I get home from the factory every night, I'm just about done up, and I don't want any of the heavy stuff—\"\n\n\"Really?\" broke in Duff. \"Now, just a moment, Mr. Benbow.\" Benbow waited, his flow of talk momentarily checked. He was a plump, genial soul; the naive, unsophisticated sort the British so love to think of as a typical American. In his hand he carried a motion-picture camera. \"What was the name of that place you expect to return to one day?\" Duff asked.\n\n\"Akron. You've heard of Akron, haven't you? Akron, Ohio.\"\n\n\"I have now,\" Duff smiled. \"On a pleasure trip, I presume?\"\n\n\"Sure. Been talking about it for years. Business wasn't so good this winter, and my partner he says to me: 'Elmer, why don't you dig down into the old sock and take that trip around the world you've been boring me with for the past five years? That is,' he says, 'if there's anything in the sock after this Wall Street crash.' Well, there was plenty, for I'm no speculator. Good safe investment—that's my motto. I wasn't afraid to spend the money, because I knew that business was fundamentally sound and would turn the corner in time. I look for a return to normalcy—Harding came from Ohio, too—about the time we get back to Akron. You take the rediscount rate—\"\n\nDuff glanced at his watch. \"I got you here, Mr. Benbow, to ask if you could throw any light on that unfortunate affair in room 28?\"\n\n\"Unfortunate is right,\" Benbow replied. \"You said it. As nice an old gentleman as you'd want to meet. One of the big men of the country, rich as all get out, and somebody goes and murders him. I tell you, it's a slap at American institutions—\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it?\"\n\n\"I didn't do it, if that's what you mean. We make too many tires in Akron to go round killing off our best customers, the automobile men. No, sir, this is all a big mystery to Nettie and me. You've met the wife?\"\n\nThe detective bowed in the direction of Mrs. Benbow, a handsome, well-dressed woman who, not being needed at the factory, had evidently had more time for the refinements of life than had her husband.\n\n\"A great pleasure,\" he said. \"I take it that you have been out this morning for a walk about London?\"\n\nMr. Benbow held up the camera. \"Wanted to get a few more shots on the good old film,\" he explained. \"But say—the fog was terrible. I don't know how some of these pictures will turn out. It's my hobby, you might say. When I get back from this tour I expect to have enough movies to make a fool of contract bridge at our house for months to come. And that will be O.K. with me.\"\n\n\"So you spent the morning taking pictures?\"\n\n\"I sure did. The sun came out a while ago, and then I really went to it. Nettie, she says to me: 'Elmer, we'll be late for that train,' so I finally tore myself away. I was out of film by that time, anyhow.\"\n\nDuff sat studying his notes. \"This Akron,\" he remarked. \"Is it near a town called\"—he flipped the pages of his notebook—\"is it near Canton, Ohio?\"\n\n\"Just a few miles between 'em,\" Benbow answered. \"McKinley came from Canton, you know. Mother of presidents—that's what we call Ohio.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" murmured Duff. He turned to Mrs. Latimer Luce, a keen-eyed old woman of indefinite age and cultivated bearing. \"Mrs. Luce, have you anything to tell me about this murder?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Inspector,\" she replied, \"but I can tell you nothing.\" Her voice was low and pleasing. \"I've been traveling most of my life, but this is a new experience.\"\n\n\"Where is your home?\"\n\n\"Well—Pasadena, California—if I have one. I keep a house there, but I'm never in it. I'm always on the go. At my age, it gives one something to think about. New scenes, new faces. I'm so shocked over this Drake affair. A charming man.\"\n\n\"You've been out of the hotel this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes—I breakfasted with an old friend in Curzon Street. An English woman I knew when I lived in Shanghai, some twenty years ago.\"\n\nDuff's eyes were on Mr. Max Minchin, and they lighted with interest. Mr. Minchin was a dark stocky man with close-cropped hair and a protruding lower lip. He had shown no such enthusiasm as had Mr. Benbow at meeting a man from Scotland Yard. In fact, his manner was sullen, almost hostile.\n\n\"Where is your home, Mr. Minchin?\" Duff inquired.\n\n\"What's that got to do with the case?\" Minchin inquired. With one hairy hand he fingered a big diamond in his tie.\n\n\"Oh, tell him, Maxy,\" said his wife, who overflowed a red plush chair. \"It ain't nothing to be ashamed of, I guess.\" She looked at Duff. \"We're from Chicago,\" she explained.\n\n\"Well, Chicago, it is,\" her husband remarked harshly. \"And what of it, hey?\"\n\n\"Have you any information about this murder?\"\n\n\"I ain't no dick,\" said Maxy. \"Do I look it? Dig up your own info. Me—I got nothing to say. My lawyers—well, they ain't here. I ain't talking. See what I mean?\"\n\nDuff glanced at Doctor Lofton. Some queer characters had certainly crept into Lofton's Round the World Tour this year. The doctor looked the other way, obviously embarrassed.\n\nMrs. Minchin also appeared rather uncomfortable. \"Come on, Maxy,\" she protested. \"There's no use nursing a grouch. Nobody's accusing you.\"\n\n\"Patrol your own beat,\" he said. \"I'll handle this.\"\n\n\"What have you been doing this morning?\" Duff inquired.\n\n\"Buying,\" answered Minchin tersely.\n\n\"Look at that sparkler.\" Sadie held out a fat hand. \"I seen it in a window, and I says to Maxy—if you want me to remember London, that's what I remember it by. And he come across, Maxy did. A free spender—ask the boys in Chicago—\"\n\nDuff sighed, and stood up. \"I won't detain you any longer,\" he remarked to the little group. He explained again that no one must leave Broome's Hotel, and the five went out. Lofton turned to him.\n\n\"What's to be the outcome of this, Mr. Duff?\" he wanted to know. \"My tour is on schedule, of course, and a delay is going to tangle things frightfully. Boats, you understand. Boats all along the line, Naples, Port Said, Calcutta, Singapore. Have you any information that will entitle you to hold any of my party here? If so, hold them, and let the rest of us go on.\"\n\nA puzzled frown was on Duff's usually serene face. \"I'll be honest with you,\" he said. \"I've never encountered a situation like this before. For the moment, I'm not quite certain about my future course of action. I must consult my superiors at the Yard. There'll be a coroner's inquest in the morning, which will no doubt be adjourned for a few weeks.\"\n\n\"A few weeks!\" cried Lofton, in dismay.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'll work as fast as I can, but I may tell you that until I've solved this thing, I'll be very reluctant to see your tour resume.\"\n\nLofton shrugged. \"We shall see about that,\" he remarked.\n\n\"No doubt,\" Duff answered, and they parted.\n\nMark Kennaway was waiting in the hallway. \"May I see you a moment, Inspector?\" he said. They sat down on a nearby bench.\n\n\"You have information?\" the detective inquired rather wearily.\n\n\"Of a sort—yes. It probably means nothing. But when I left Mr. Tait last night and went down to the second floor, I saw a man lurking about in the shadows opposite the lift.\"\n\n\"What man?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't expect any big surprise, Inspector. It was no one but our old friend, Captain Keane.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Hoping to borrow a book, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Might have been. The night lift man is a great reader. I've caught him at it. But his library is not extensive.\"\n\nDuff studied the young man's face. He rather liked Kennaway. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"how long have you known Mr. Tait?\"\n\n\"Only since we started on this tour. You see, I'd just left Harvard Law School last June, and there didn't seem to be any great public clamor for my services. A friend told me about this job. I wanted to travel, and it seemed like a good chance to pick up pointers on the law—from a man like Tait.\"\n\n\"Picking any up?\"\n\n\"No. He doesn't talk much. He demands a lot of attention, and if he's going to have many more attacks like that this morning, I may wish I was back in Boston.\"\n\n\"That was your first experience with one of Mr. Tait's attacks?\"\n\n\"Yes—he's seemed perfectly all right up to now.\"\n\nDuff leaned back on the hard bench, and began to fill his pipe. \"How about giving me a few of your impressions about this crowd?\" he suggested.\n\n\"Well, I'm not sure that I'm a particularly bright-eyed boy,\" Kennaway smiled. \"I got to know a few of them on the boat. Variety seems to be the keynote of the expedition.\"\n\n\"Take Keane, for example.\"\n\n\"A four-flusher—and a snooper, too. I can't figure out where he got the cash for this. It's an expensive tour, you know.\"\n\n\"Was the dead man—Drake—in evidence on the boat?\"\n\n\"Very much so. A harmless old gentleman. Sociably inclined, too, which made it a little hard for the rest of us. His deafness, you understand. However, I used to be a cheer leader at college, so I didn't mind.\"\n\n\"What do you think of Lofton?\"\n\n\"He's a rather remote sort of person, an educated man—he knows his stuff. You should have heard his little talk on the Tower of London. He's worried and distrait most of the time. No wonder. With this outfit on his hands.\"\n\n\"And Honywood?\" Duff lighted his pipe.\n\n\"Never saw him on the boat, until the last morning. I don't believe he ever left his cabin.\"\n\n\"He told me he got to know Mr. Drake quite well during the crossing.\"\n\n\"He was kidding you. I stood between them when we were drawing up to the pier at Southampton, and introduced them. I'm certain they'd never spoken to each other before.\"\n\n\"That's interesting,\" said Duff thoughtfully. \"Did you take a good look at Honywood this morning?\"\n\n\"I did,\" nodded Kennaway. \"Like a man who'd seen a ghost, wasn't he? I was struck by it. Not well, I thought. But Lofton tells me these tours of his are very popular with the sick and the aged. I'm expecting to have a merry time of it.\"\n\n\"Miss Potter's a very charming girl,\" Duff suggested.\n\n\"So she is—and this is where she gets off. That would happen to me. It's the famous Kennaway luck.\"\n\n\"How about this fellow Minchin?\"\n\nThe young man's face lighted. \"Ah—the life of the party. Oozes money at every pore. He gave three champagne suppers on the way over. Nobody came but the Benbows, Keane and myself—and old Mrs. Luce. She's a good sport—never misses anything, she tells me. That is, we all went to the first soiree. After that, it was just Keane, and some terrible passengers Maxy picked up in the smoking-room.\"\n\n\"Party was too gay, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, not that. But after a good look at Maxy—well, even champagne can't atone for some hosts.\"\n\nDuff laughed. \"Thanks for the tip about Keane,\" he said, rising.\n\n\"Don't imagine it means anything,\" Kennaway answered. \"Personally, I don't like to tell tales. But poor old Drake was so nice to everybody. Well—see you later, I imagine.\"\n\n\"You can't help yourself,\" Duff told him.\n\nAfter a few words with the managing director of the hotel, the detective went out to the street. The little green car was waiting. As he was about to step into it, a cheery voice sounded behind him.\n\n\"Say, listen, Inspector. Just turn around and face me, will you?\" Duff turned. Mr. Elmer Benbow was on the sidewalk, smiling broadly, his motion picture camera leveled and ready for action.\n\n\"Atta-boy,\" he cried. \"Now, if you'll just take off the benny—the hat, you know—the light isn't so good—\"\n\nCursing inwardly, Duff did as directed. The man from Akron held the machine before his eyes, and was turning a small crank.\n\n\"Let's have the little old smile—great—just for the folks back in Akron, you understand—now, move about a little—one hand on the door of the car—I guess this won't give them a kick back home—famous Scotland Yard inspector leaving Broome's Hotel in London, England, after investigating mysterious murder in round the world party—now, get into the car—that's the stuff—drive off—thanks!\"\n\n\"Ass!\" muttered Duff to his chauffeur. \"Go around to Vine Street, please.\"\n\nIn a few moments they drew up before the police station that is hidden away in the heart of the West End, on a street so brief and unimportant it is unknown to most Londoners. Duff dismissed the car, and went inside. Hayley was in his room.\n\n\"Finished, old man?\" he inquired.\n\nDuff gave him a weary look. \"I'll never be finished,\" he remarked. \"Not with this case.\" He glanced at his watch. \"It's getting on toward twelve. Will you come have a spot of lunch with me, old chap?\"\n\nHayley was willing, and presently they were seated at a table in the Monico Grill. After they had ordered, Duff sat for some moments staring into space.\n\n\"Cheerio!\" said his friend at last.\n\n\"Cheerio, my hat!\" Duff answered. \"Was there ever a case like this before?\"\n\n\"Why the gloom?\" Hayley wanted to know. \"A simple little matter of murder.\"\n\n\"The crime itself—yes, that's simple enough,\" Duff agreed. \"And under ordinary conditions, no doubt eventually solved. But consider this, if you will.\" He took out his note-book. \"I have here the names of some fifteen or more people, and among them is probably that of the man I want. So far, so good. But these people are traveling. Where? Around the world, if you please. All my neat list of suspects, in one compact party, and unless something unexpected happens at once, that party will be moving along. Paris, Naples, Port Said, Calcutta, Singapore—Lofton just told me all about it. Moving along, farther and farther away from the scene of the crime.\"\n\n\"But you can hold them here.\"\n\n\"Can I? I'm glad you think so. I don't. I can hold the murderer here, the moment I have sufficient evidence of his guilt. But I'll have to get that immediately, or there will be international complications—the American consulate—perhaps the Ambassador himself—a summons for me from the Home Office. On what grounds do you hold these people? Where is your evidence that one of them committed the crime? I tell you, Hayley, there's no precedent for this situation. Such a thing has never happened before. And now that it's decided to happen at last, I'm the lucky lad it has happened to. Before I forget it, I must thank you for that.\"\n\nHayley laughed. \"You were longing for another puzzle, last night,\" he said.\n\nDuff shook his head. \"The calm man is the happy man,\" he murmured, as his roast beef and bottle of stout were put before him.\n\n\"You got nothing from your examination of the party?\" Hayley asked.\n\n\"Not a thing that's definite. Nothing that links any one of them with the crime, even remotely. A few faint suspicions yes. A few odd incidents. But nothing that I could hold anybody on—nothing that would convince the American Embassy—or even my own superintendent.\"\n\n\"There's an unholy lot of writing in that book of yours,\" commented the Vine Street man. \"Why not run over the list you talked with? You might get a flash—who knows?\"\n\nDuff took up the note-book. \"You were with me when I interviewed the first of them. Miss Pamela Potter, a pretty American girl, determined to find out who killed her grandfather. Our friend Doctor Lofton, who had a bit of a row with the old man last evening, and with whose strap the murder was committed. Mrs. Spicer, clever, quick, and not to be trapped by unexpected questions. Mr. Honywood—\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, Honywood,\" put in Hayley. \"From a look at his face, he's my choice.\"\n\n\"That's the stuff to give a jury!\" replied Duff sarcastically. \"He looked guilty. I think he did, myself, but what of it? Does that get me anywhere?\"\n\n\"You talked with the others down-stairs?\"\n\n\"I did. I met the man in room 30—a Mr. Patrick Tait.\" He told of Tait's heart attack at the door of the parlor. Hayley looked grave.\n\n\"What do you make of that?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I suspect he was startled by something—or some one—he saw in that room. But he's a famous criminal lawyer on the other side—probably a past master of the art of cross-examination. Get something out of him that he doesn't want to tell, and you're a wonder. On the other hand, he may have nothing to tell. His attacks, he assured me, come with just that suddenness.\"\n\n\"None the less, like Honywood, he should be kept in mind.\"\n\n\"Yes, he should. And there is one other.\" He explained about Captain Ronald Keane. \"Up to something last night—heaven knows what. A fox in trousers, if I ever met one. Sly—and a self-confessed liar.\"\n\n\"And the others?\"\n\nDuff shook his head. \"Nothing there, so far. A nice young chap who is Tait's companion. A polo player with a scar—a Mr. Vivian. Seems somehow connected with Mrs. Irene Spicer. A lame man named Ross, in the lumber trade on the West Coast. A brother and sister named Fenwick, the former a pompous little nobody who has been frightened to death, and seems determined to leave the tour.\"\n\n\"Oh, he does, does he?\"\n\n\"Yes, but don't be deceived. It means nothing. He hasn't nerve enough to kill a rabbit. There are just four, Hayley—four to be watched. Honywood, Tait, Lofton and Keane.\"\n\n\"Then you didn't see the remaining members of the party?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes I did. But they don't matter. A Mr. and Mrs. Benbow from a town called Akron—he runs a factory and is quite insane ab"
