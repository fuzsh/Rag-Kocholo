        "text": "East Side Kids - February 1940 - Directed by Bob Hill\n\nNone of the original \"Dead End Kids\" appear in this film.\n\nHowever, Dave O'Brien, Hally Chester and Donald Haines, would reprise their roles in the following picture, \"Boys of the City\", so the film falls into The East Side Kids continuity.\n\nFeaturing: Leon Ames as Pat O'Day; Dennis Moore as Milton Franklin 'Mileaway' Harris; Joyce Bryant as Molly Dolan; Hal E. Chester as Fred 'Dutch' Kuhn (as Hally Chester); Harris Berger as Danny Dolan; Frankie Burke as Skinny; Vince Barnett as Whisper; Dave O'Brien as Knuckles Dolan; Ted Adams as Schmidt (as Richard Adams); Maxine Leslie as May; Robert Fiske as Cornwall - aka Robert Morrison; Jack Edwards as Algernon 'Mouse' Wilkes; Jim Farley as Police Captain Moran (as James Farley); Stephen Chase as Joe - Detective (as Alden Chase); Fred Hoose as Mr. Wilkes\n\nThe kids try to find the real culprit when the brother of one of the boys is framed for murder.\n\nPolice officer Pat O'Day, a former child of the tenements, tries to reform a gang of street kids by involving them in a boys's police club. When club member Danny Dolan's brother Knuckles is sentenced to death row for killing a treasury agent, Pat vows to help Danny clear his brother, whom he believes is innocent, but before he can begin his investigation, the police commissioner demotes him to walking a beat. Meanwhile, a counterfeiting ring comprised of Mileaway Harris, a former tenement kid, Morrison, and his girl friend May sets up shop in shopkeeper's Schmidt's, basement. Feeling threatened by Pat, Morrison schemes to discredit the policeman by posing as a businessman who wants to hire Pat's boys to distribute advertising leaflets. Unknown to Pat, Morrison places bogus five dollar bills in the pay envelopes, and when the boys are caught passing fake money, Pat is implicated in the counterfeiting scheme.\n\nTo prove his innocence, Pat takes to the streets, and Danny, still unaware of Morris' involvement in the counterfeiting ring, agrees to deliver a suitcase for him to May. A policeman follows Danny to May's apartment, where they are greeted by Mileaway, who kills the policeman and takes Danny hostage. As they drive across town, Danny learns that it was Mileaway who killed the treasury agent and framed Knuckles. Pat tracks down Mileaway's car, and in the ensuing chase, Mileaway escapes and kills Schmidt. Pat and the kids chase Mileaway to a rooftop, where Dutch, Danny's friend, struggles with Mileaway. When they both fall to the sidewalk, Dutch is killed; but Mileaway lives to confess to the agent's murder, and all ends happily as both Knuckles and Pat are exonerated.\n\nBoys Of The City - July 1940 - Directed by Joseph H.

En route, their car breaks down and they are reluctantly given accommodations in the home of Judge Malcolm Parker. The Judge, under indictment for bribery, has much to fear. His life, as well as that of his niece Louise has been threatened by a gang of racketeers; his companion, Giles, has accused him of embezzling Louise's fortune; and his sinister housekeeper, Agnes, blames him for the death of her mistress, Leonora. The Judge's fears are compounded when he meets Knuckles Dolan, the boys' guardian, whom he had unjustly sentenced to death, only to have his verdict reversed and Knuckles exonerated.\n\nLater that night, when Louise is kidnapped and the Judge found strangled, Giles and Simp, the Judge's bodyguard, accuse Knuckles of the murder, but the boys capture Simp and Giles and determine to find the murderer themselves. Muggs and Danny discover a secret panel in the library wall and enter a passage where they find Louise's unconscious body and glimpse the figure of a fleeing man. Knuckles captures the man, who identifies himself as Jim Harrison of the district attorney's office. Amid the confusion, the real killer takes Louise captive, but the boys track him down and unmask Simp. Harrison then identifies the bodyguard as the triggerman seeking revenge on the Judge. With the crime solved, the boys can finally leave for their summer camp.\n\nThat Gang Of Mine - September 1940 - Directed by Joseph H. Lewis\n\nThis is a VERY loose sequel to \"Boys of the City\"\n\nFeaturing: Bobby Jordan as Danny Dolan; Leo Gorcey as Muggs Maloney; Clarence Muse as Ben; Dave O'Brien as Knuckles Dolan; Joyce Bryant as Louise; Ernest Morrison as Scruno (as Sunshine Sammy); Milton Kibbee as Mr. Wilkes; David Gorcey as Peewee; Donald Haines as Skinny; Richard Terry as Henchman Blackie (as Richard R.

Because the old man is down on his luck, the East Side boys offer to provide a makeshift quarters for Bluenight, and Algy Wilkes persuades his father to put up the entrance fee for the horse. Muggs Malone, an aspiring but untested jockey, rides Bluenight in the race, but loses his nerve on the track, causing Bluenight to trail in the field. Seated in the stands is Morgan, a respected trainer, who recognizes the horse's ability and urges Mr. Wilkes to race the horse with an experienced jockey.\n\nHowever, Muggs insists upon doing the riding, and his pals induce Mr. Wilkes to give him another chance. Complications arise the night before the race when Nick, a crooked bookie, tries to sabotage Bluenight. The boys discover the plot and save the horse, but the next day, Muggs realizes that he cannot guide the horse to victory. With the use of his fists, he convinces jockey Jimmy Sullivan to take his place, and Bluenight finishes the race the winner.\n\nPride Of The Bowery - January 1941 - Directed by Joseph H. Lewis\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Muggs; Bobby Jordan as Danny; Kenneth Howell as Allen; Mary Ainslee as Elaine; Bobby Stone as Willie; Donald Haines as Skinny; David Gorcey as Peewee; Ernest Morrison as Scruno (as Sunshine Sammy Morrison); Kenneth Harlan as Captain; Nick Stuart as Ranger; Lloyd Ingraham as Doctor\n\nMuggs tries to further his boxing career and the gang end up at a CCC camp when the gang dupes him into believing its a free training camp.\n\nWhen Muggs refuses to train for the Golden Gloves match unless he has his own private camp in the country, Danny placates his pal by enlisting members of the Vassey Street Boys' Club in the Conservation Corps. Arriving at the camp, Muggs refuses to accept the authority of Al, the leader of the boys, and treats the facility as if it was his own private property. Later, Muggs has a chance to demonstrate his true nature when he risks his own life to save Al from being crushed by a falling tree. The camp captain praises Muggs for his courage, and as a reward, Muggs requests a boxing match with Al. Norton, a small time boxing promoter, comes to watch the fight, which ends in a draw. Furious at the outcome, Muggs refuses to shake his opponent's hand, an act which earns the emnity of the other boys.\n\nWhen the captain fails to remove the chip from Muggs' shoulder, his daughter, Elaine, tries to reform him through kindness. Meanwhile, Willie, one of the boys, steals one hundred dollars from the camp cash box and confides to Muggs that he needed the money for his poor aunt. To get the money back for Willie, Muggs has Norton arrange a fight, and although he takes a beating in the ring, Muggs earns the one hundred dollars. While returning the money to the cash box, Muggs is caught and accused of theft. He refuses to inform on Willie, though and instead runs away. Danny then forces the truth from Willie, thus proving Muggs' true sportsmanship.\n\nFlying Wild - March 1941 - Directed by William West\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Muggs; Bobby Jordan as Danny; Joan Barclay as Helen; Dave O'Brien as Tom; George Pembroke as Dr. Nagel; Ernest Morrison as Scruno (as Sunshine Sammy Morrison); David Gorcey as Peewee; Donald Haines as Skinny; Eugene Francis as Algy; Bobby Stone as Louie; Herbert Rawlinson as Mr. Reynolds; Dennis Moore as George; Forrest Taylor as Mr. Forbes; Robert F. Hill as Mr. Woodward (as Bob Hill)\n\nThe kids stumble across a sabotage ring while working at an airplane factory.\n\nWhile the Kids all work at the Reynolds Aviation Company, which is run by Algy's father, Muggs, the only one of the kids who refuses to work, spends his time flirting with an ambulance nurse named Helen. Helen, though, is in love with her test pilot boyfriend Tom. One day, when Tom's plane crashes onto the plant airstrip, Reynolds suspects that the crash may have been the work of saboteurs. Later, on the airfield tarmac, Muggs jokingly appoints himself as the new operator of Dr. Richard Nagel's ambulance plane and gives his pals a tour of the aircraft. Their playful games are soon brought to a halt by Nagel, the secret leader of a spy ring, who catches the boys on his plane and angrily orders them off. Mr. Reynolds, certain that spies are working at the plant, asks Danny to act as a decoy so that the spies can be identified, and has him deliver to a downtown office a fake set of plans for a new bomb site. As Reynolds predicted, Nagel's men ambush Danny on his way to the office, but the plan goes awry when the detectives sent to trail Danny lose him. Danny eventually turns up unharmed some time later.\n\nWhen Muggs reports to Reynolds his suspicions that Nagel is behind the espionage ring, Reynolds dismisses the accusation as a product of the boy's imagination. Not convinced by Reynolds that Nagel is innocent, Muggs and Danny begin their own investigation into Nagel, starting with a visit to the doctor on the pretext of a fake ailment. The visit turns up nothing, however, and when Danny and Muggs return to the hanger, a suspicious \"accident\" that was apparently meant to harm them leaves Peewee injured. While Peewee recovers at the hospital, Tom nearly loses his life when he is unable to make contact with the control tower for a landing. The controller is later found bound and gagged in the tower, prompting the kids to resume their investigation in earnest. Helen provides the gang with further clues when she confirms that the ambulance plane was being flown on many unusual trips to Mexico, supposedly to deliver patients. When Helen tells the East Side Kids that a man named Forbes is the next \"patient\" to be transported, they rush to his house, where they find secret plans hidden in his head bandage.\n\nDisguising Danny as the transportee, the kids send Danny and Muggs on the flight to learn who is behind the espionage ring. Danny and Muggs soon find themselves in trouble, however, when Nagel, having found Forbes locked in his closet, tries to warn the pilot of the boys' ruse. Meanwhile, Tom learns of the dangerous mission and goes after the ambulance plane in his own plane. Tom arrives in Mexico in time to save Danny and Muggs, and all the spies are arrested. Back at the plant, Reynolds rewards Muggs for his heroism by giving him a job, but his stint there is short-lived as he is soon distracted by a pretty woman and crashes a plane.\n\nBowery Blitzkrieg - September 1941 - Directed by Wallace Fox\n\nFirst appearance of Huntz Hall\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Muggs; Bobby Jordan as Danny; Huntz Hall as Limpy; Keye Luke as Clancy (as Key Luke); Warren Hull as Tom Brady; Charlotte Henry as Mary Breslin; Bobby Stone as Monk Martin; Donald Haines as Skinny; Ernest Morrison as Scruno (as Sunshine Sammy Morrison); David Gorcey as Peewee; Martha Wentworth as Mrs. Brady; Jack Mulhall as Officer Sherrill; Eddie Foster as Slats Morrison; Dennis Moore as Dorgan; Tony Carson as Dutch\n\nMuggs is threatened by gamblers who want him to throw an important boxing match.\n\nTwo police officers patrolling the streets of the Bowery discuss the lamentable fact that most of the young boys in the neighborhood will turn to crime and end up in jail. One exception, they agree, is Danny Breslin, a young boxer who is studying economics and destined for success. While Danny's future looks bright, the future of his former best friend, Muggs McGinnis, appears to hold little more than troubles with the law and juvenile probation. One day, when Danny learns that Muggs has been speaking poorly of his schoolteacher sister Mary, he marches over to Clancy's Pool Hall, their favorite neighborhood haunt, and punches Muggs. The fight eventually turns into a pool hall riot, which results in Muggs's arrest. Officer Tom Brady, Mary's sweetheart, believes that many of the boys can be reformed, and when he learns that Muggs has been involved in another fight, he tries to enlist Danny's help in determining the reason behind Muggs' propensity to fight.\n\nDanny surprises his mother, sister and Tom when he violently protests Tom's request, saying that he hates \"coppers,\" and vows never to return to the police gym for his boxing practice. While Tom lays plans to reform Muggs by entering him as a fighter in the upcoming Golden Glove Tournament, Danny unwittingly gets involved with notorious thug Monk Martin. Unknown to Danny, Monk has used him to drive his getaway car in a grocery store holdup. After paying Danny for his \"services,\" Monk manages to persuade him to quit school and join his racket. Meanwhile, Muggs, having made great strides at the Whitney reform school, goes to live with Tom and his mother, much to the dismay of Mary, who promptly breaks off her relationship with Tom. Muggs eventually wins the respect of the entire neighborhood and earns the police department's sponsorship of his fight in the Golden Glove Tournament.\n\nSo completely has Muggs given up his delinquent ways that he curses Monk when the racketeer offers him $1,000 to take a fall in the tournament fight. Later, after overhearing Tom's mother blaming his arrival for the break-up of Tom and Mary's relationship, Muggs becomes despondent and decides to move out. Just before the fight, crooked fight promoter Slats Morrison plants the intended bribery money in Muggs's gear and tries to frame him. Danny, meanwhile, is wounded by Tom as he and Monk are caught fleeing from a robbery. Hospitalized and in desperate need of blood, Danny's life hangs in the balance until Muggs volunteers his blood and saves his best friend. Mary has a change of heart and returns to Tom, and Tom announces that Monk made a full confession before dying. Danny's family gathers around a radio and listens with pride as Muggs knocks out his opponent at the tournament. Following the fight, Slats and his boss Dorgan are arrested, and Tom and Mary look forward to their wedding.\n\nSpooks Run Wild - October 1941 - Directed by Phil Rosen\n\nFeaturing: Bela Lugosi as Nardo; Leo Gorcey as Muggs; Bobby Jordan as Danny; Huntz Hall as Glimpy; Ernest Morrison as Scruno (as Sunshine Sammy Morrison); Dave O'Brien as Jeff Dixon (as David O'Brien); Dorothy Short as Linda Mason; David Gorcey as Peewee; Donald Haines as Skinny; Dennis Moore as Dr. Von Grosch; P.J. Kelly as Lem Harvey (as P.J. Kelley); Angelo Rossitto as Luigi; Guy Wilkerson as Constable\n\nThe gang meet a mysterious man played by Bela Lugosi and his dwarf companion in an old haunted mansion.\n\nThe East Side Kids reluctantly board a bus bound for summer camp. The bus stops in the town of Hillside, where Muggs and his pals flirt with a soda fountain waitress. While they are there, a radio broadcast announces that a maniacal \"monster killer\" is in the area. When they arrive at the camp, the counselor, Jeff Dixon, complains to his girl friend, camp nurse Linda Mason, that he will get no work done on his thesis because of the rowdy juvenile delinquents. One night, Nardo, a mysterious caped figure, and his dwarf assistant, Luigi, ask a local gas station attendant for directions to the hilltop Billings house, which has been deserted for years since its owner was murdered. After he leaves, another car arrives and the attendant recognizes the driver from his mystery magazines as Dr. Von Grosch.\n\nThe attendant believes that Nardo is the killer and Von Grosch is hunting him, and he alerts the local constable that Nardo is a suspect. One night, Nardo and Luigi sneak into the local graveyard and are shot at by a grave digger. That same night, Muggs slips out of camp hoping to rendezvous with the soda fountain girl, and is followed by all his pals. The East Side Kids get lost in the woods, and when they wander into the graveyard, Peewee is also shot by the digger. The boys take Peewee to the nearby Billings house, where Nardo tends to his minor injury and gives him a sedative. Nardo lets the boys spend the night, but Peewee disappears while sleepwalking. The rest of the boys are unable to sleep because of Nardo's strangeness and Peewee's disappearance. Linda, meanwhile, also disappears while out searching for the boys, and Jeff goes to the police for help. When the boys confront Nardo, he claims not to know where Peewee is, but insists that the boys remain in the house.\n\nMuggs distrusts Nardo and on his command, the boys attack him and roll him into a carpet. Skinny and Glimpy disappear through a secret passage, and Scruno is spooked when Nardo reappears. At constable Jim's office, the grave digger recalls seeing the boys, and Jim believes they may have fallen into the killer's hands at the Billings estate. The boys, meanwhile, search for Peewee, but are continually being surprised by the appearance of coffins and objects that move themselves, and by the disappearance of their pals through walls and closets. Linda, meanwhile, accepts a ride from Von Grosch, who takes her to the Billings house, ostensibly to help the boys. Muggs and the boys succeed in terrifying Nardo by pretending to be a ghost, and they finally find Peewee back in bed. Just after Linda and Von Grosch arrive at the house, Von Grosch attacks Linda.\n\nThe police burst in and accuse Nardo of being a killer, but Muggs has already learned that Nardo is merely a magician. When they all hear Linda screaming inside a locked room, Muggs climbs onto the roof and enters the room through a window. While he struggles with Von Grosch, who is the real \"monster killer,\" Linda opens the door, and the police arrest Von Grosch. Later, Nardo performs magic tricks for Jeff, Linda and the boys, and when Muggs goes into a cabinet after a disappearing girl, he emerges with Scruno in his arms.\n\nMr. Wise Guy - February 1942 - Directed by William Nigh\n\nFirst appearance of Gabe Dell\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Muggs; Bobby Jordan as Danny; Huntz Hall as Glimpy Stone; Billy Gilbert as Knobby; Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams as Luke Manning (as Guinn Williams); Douglas Fowley as Bill Collins; Joan Barclay as Ann Mitchell; Warren Hymer as Dratler; Ann Doran as Dorothy Melton; Jack Mulhall as Jim Barnes; Gabriel Dell as Charlie Manning; Sidney Miller as Charlie Horse; David Gorcey as Peewee; Bobby Stone as Chalky Jones; Dick Ryan as Jed Miller\n\nThe boys are sent to reform school after they are wrongly convicted of stealing a truck.\n\nIn New York, the East Side Kids are falsely arrested on the wharf because the truck they are playing in was stolen. They are remanded to Wilton Reform School, where Muggs, the wise-cracking leader of the gang, is dubbed \"Mr. Wise Guy\" by the brutal guard Miller. Jim Barnes, the new warden, reassures Danny's older brother Bill, who has bad memories of the school from when he served as a guard there, that his testimony describing the place's cruelty eventually resulted in the dismissal of the former warden and the adoption of gentler rules. Bill is given a tour of the school by Barnes's secretary, Ann Mitchell, and later takes her out to dinner.\n\nThat night, while Bill buys cigarettes in a drugstore, escaped convict Luke Manning robs the place and murders the clerk. Manning takes Bill hostage in his car and forces him to lead the police on a chase. Manning escapes when Bill crashes the car, and Bill is later convicted of robbery and murder and sentenced to execution. In the reform school, the boys have been battling with two toughs, \"Rice Pudding\" Charlie and Chalky Jones, but when Barnes witnesses Miller encouraging a fistfight, he demands Miller's resignation. Chalky tries to get the kids in trouble by informing Barnes of their plans to run away, but in an effort to establish a code of honor, Barnes punishes Chalky for being an informer. When Muggs and his pals see newsreel footage of a man and woman accepting the winnings from a lottery, they recognize the man as Knobby, the driver of the stolen truck.\n\nThey link Knobby to Manning based on information given to them by Charlie, who is Manning's nephew. Armed with information that could prove Bill's innocence, the boys escape from the reform school and go to the apartment of Dorothy Melton, the woman from the newsreel. The kids hold the pair, who had been planning to leave town with the lottery money which actually belongs to Manning, who was afraid of being seen. Manning appears at Dorothy's apartment to demand his money and hits Dorothy for double-crossing him with Knobby. Before the situation can worsen, the police arrive and arrest the criminals. Bill gets a reprieve from the governor, and Ann and the boys see him off as he reports for active military duty.\n\nLet's Get Tough - May 1942 - Directed by Wallace Fox\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Muggs; Bobby Jordan as Danny; Huntz Hall as Glimpy; Gabriel Dell as Fritz Heinbach; Tom Brown as Phil; Florence Rice as Nora Stevens; Robert Armstrong as Pop Stevens; David Gorcey as Peewee; Ernest Morrison as Scruno (as Sunshine Sammy Morrisson); Bobby Stone as Skinny; Sam Bernard as Heinback Sr.; Philip Ahn as Joe Matsui (as Phil Ahn); Jerry Bergen as Music Master\n\nThe boys manage to stop a spy ring who are planning to sabotage U.S. war production.\n\nThe East Side Kids are frustrated that their age keeps them from serving in the army during World War II, so they wage a private war at home. Their first target is a storekeeper whom they believe to be Japanese, and they pelt his store with rotten vegetables. When they enter the store to smash the curios, they discover the owner has been stabbed to death. The Kids are questioned and released by the police. Learning that the owner was actually Chinese, the Kids make a heartfelt apology to his widow. Their curiosity is then aroused when a supposed patron, Joe Matsui, steals a pen from the store's desk. After they steal the pen from Joe, the Kids discover a piece of paper hidden inside it, which reveals Japanese writing when a light is held near it. Muggs, the leader of the East Side Kids, takes the note to the Matsui tea shop and asks Joe's father to interpret it.\n\nWhen the elder Matsui snatches the note, Muggs grabs it back, and Matsui commits suicide. The Kids drag policeman Pop Stevens to the scene, but Joe disguises himself as his own father to allay suspicions about his father's death. Danny, a member of the gang, is surprised by the appearance of his brother Phil in the tea shop. Phil has been dishonorably discharged from the Navy for sabotage, and his covert actions now seem suspicious to the Kids. They steal a bag containing a white substance hidden in the tea shop and take it home. When the bag explodes on the stove, Stevens helps them put out the fire and identifies the substance as magnesium, a valuable wartime resource which he suspects is being illegally supplied by a local storekeeper named Heinbach. Muggs gives the Japanese note to Nora, Phil's girl friend and Stevens' daughter, to be translated, but when she takes it to her old high school friend, Joe, he and Heinbach's son Fritz hold her hostage.\n\nThe Kids now become convinced that a spy ring is operating in their neighborhood and break into the tea shop and infiltrate a clandestine meeting of fifth columnists wearing hoods and gowns. After Phil is revealed as a member, the Kids are discovered and a brawl ensues. Phil, who has actually been working undercover for the U.S. government, rounds up the spies, including Matsui and Heinbach, Sr., with the help of the East Side Kids, the spies are arrested by the police. Phil and Nora marry, but he is forced to report back to the Navy before they can go on their honeymoon.\n\nSmart Alecks - August 1942 - Directed by Wallace Fox\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Muggs; Bobby Jordan as Danny; Huntz Hall as Glimpy; Gabriel Dell as Hank; Stanley Clements as Stash; Bobby Stone as Skinny; Ernest Morrison as Scruno (as Sunshine Sammy); David Gorcey as Peewee; Max 'Slapsie Maxie' Rosenbloom as Butch Brocalli (as Maxie Rosenbloom); Roger Pryor as Joe Reagan; Gale Storm as Ruth; Walter Woolf King as Dr. Ormsby; Herbert Rawlinson as Captain Bronson; Joe Kirk as Mike; Sam Bernard as Dr. Thomas\n\nThe gang wants to buy baseball uniforms. Danny gets a reward for capturing a crook and the crook breaks out of jail for revenge.\n\nHank Salko, a member of the Eastside youth gang in New York, is initiated into the world of adult crime when two gangsters, Mike and Butch Brocalli, hire him to stand watch while they rob a bank. When Hank tries to share some of his ill-gotten money with the East Side Kids, they suspend him from the club, and Hank is then arrested by Joe Reagan, the local policeman. While playing baseball in the street, the Kids accidentally send a ball crashing through the window of the apartment in which Butch and Mike are hiding. Butch emerges and refuses to give the ball back, so Danny runs after him. When Joe recognizes Butch, he chases him and Danny trips the criminal, who is then arrested along with Mike.\n\nDanny is awarded $200 for capturing the criminals and plans to buy baseball uniforms for his friends. They are unaware of his plans, however, and, thinking he is keeping the money to be selfish, steal it from him and ban him from the club. Danny's sister Ruth calls Joe, who is her boyfriend, and he has the Kids arrested for thievery. The arrest deepens the Kids's resentment of Danny, even though Danny insists that they be released. Once free, the Kids buy an old car with the $200. A month later, Hank breaks out of jail with Butch and Mike and warns Mugs and the rest of the group that the gangsters are after Danny for getting them arrested. The gang responds immediately out of deeply rooted loyalty for their friend, but are too late and find him severely beaten in a warehouse, where Butch and Mike have left him.\n\nWhen they learn that only ace brain surgeon Ormsby can save their friend, they go to Ormsby's house and plead for their friend's life, offering their beat-up jalopy as payment. Ormsby is touched by their concern and agrees to forego a conference in order to operate on Danny. The surgery is successful and Ormsby refrains from charging for it, but Danny does not rally to recover.

There they meet Spider, a new club member who was working with Danny at a warehouse when he was arrested.\n\nMuggs and Glimpy then go to the jailhouse to question Danny. Becoming suspicious when Danny tells them that soon after Spider arranged for him to work at the warehouse, he was charged with stealing alcohol earmarked for the Army, Muggs goes to the warehouse to investigate. After observing Fingers Belmont, a troublemaker who had been expelled from their club, hand fifty dollars to Spider, Muggs invites Spider to a \"party\" at the clubhouse that night.

Claiming that he was dishonorably discharged, Muggs then tells Spider that he wants to join the hijackers, and Spider confides that Fingers pays him to unbolt the back door to the warehouse. Fingers overhears Spider's confession and, once Spider is alone, drags him back to the clubhouse and beats him to death.\n\nWhen Spider's body is found there, suspicion falls on Muggs, and Glimpy hurries to warn his friend that the police are looking for him.

As the boys await Muggs's call, Fingers and Muggs row out to a warehouse on the docks and load some stolen crates onto their boat. After delivering the crates to Maxie's storeroom, Muggs starts an argument with Fingers and knocks him unconscious. In the fray, Finger's hat flies off his head and Muggs sees the initials \"WWB\" inscribed on the band.\n\nUpon regaining consciousness, Fingers knocks Muggs down and races to warn Larry about Muggs's double-cross.

Tom falls dead and Gypsy flees in panic. At the time of the murder, Jim Lindsey, the star reporter of the American Express paper, is busily bidding on oriental rugs at an auction and consequently misses the story.

Duncan recalls that Gypsy threatened Wilson's life, and the police lieutenant states that a .38 caliber bullet was used to kill Wilson. The houseboy then reveals that right after the murder, he saw a woman wearing a \"fuzzy coat and funny hat\" hail a yellow cab with a dented fender. After purchasing his rug, Jim hears about the murder and hurries to the Wilson house to investigate. Meanwhile, Muggs, Glimpy and the other newsboys go to the taxi stand and learn from the driver that he delivered a woman wearing a fuzzy coat to the Stephens apartment building, where Gypsy lives.

As Jim exhibits his clue, the police arrive to question Cartwright about the strange woman driving the Express 's car.\n\nUpon seeing the button, the police take Cartwright in for questioning, and Cartwright, furious, fires Jim. Skinny, meanwhile, has followed Diane to the Pussy Cat Café, where she turns Gypsy's stolen securities over to Duncan.

When Skinny's sister finds them outside the clubhouse and relates Skinny's message to Muggs, Muggs tells Jim to deliver Gypsy to police headquarters while he meets Skinny.\n\nGypsy has left the clubhouse, however, and when Jim finds the room deserted, he dispatches the police to the café. Skinny is eavesdropping outside the door to Duncan's office when one of Duncan's henchmen finds him and imprisons him in a room. After Diane leaves the office to perform her act, Gypsy enters, pulls out her gun and demands that Duncan return the securities. Just then, Diane re-enters the room and begins to wrestle with Gypsy.

While Glimpy and Muggs are investigating the area, the attacker spots them and gives chase but is interrupted by the arrival of the police. Muggs and Glimpy then return to their tenement and learn from neighbor Mrs. Darcy, a war refugee from Toscania, that a thief just stole a valuable necklace from her.

Jacobs that the gem is his, learns that Muggs and the gang retrieved it.\n\nAfter the boys are released, Compeau follows them to their clubhouse and demands the necklace at gunpoint. Glimpy takes Compeau by surprise, however, and grabs his gun and the necklace. Compeau escapes the clubhouse, but Skinny and another gang member follow him to the mansion, then report his whereabouts to Muggs. At the same time, Marty, Glimpy's Merchant Marine cousin who is in love with Saundra, unwittingly reveals to the police that he went to Kessel's just before he was found dead to buy an engagement ring, and is arrested on suspicion of murder. Mrs. Darcy then phones Muggs at the tenement and informs him of their new address, but before the gang arrives there, Mallet shows up.\n\nSaundra is alone and, not suspecting her cousin, happily invites him inside. Mallet starts to strangle Saundra, but is interrupted by the arrival of the boys. After Mallet escapes unharmed, Saundra informs the gang that the necklace they took from Compeau is a fake. The boys pledge to retrieve the real necklace and head for the mansion, while at the police station, Saundra and Mrs. Darcy reveal their identities to Capt. Jacobs and get Marty out of jail. After Capt. Jacobs informs Saundra and Mrs. Darcy that the prime minister is in the country, the boys, who are staking out the mansion, see the women being taken inside and assume they have been kidnapped.\n\nMuggs sends Glimpy to notify the police, then he and the others break into the house and take Compeau by surprise. Before they can claim the necklace from him, Mallet shows up, and a fight ensues. The boys soon overpower Mallet and Compeau and expose them as criminals both to the police and the prime minister. Later, Marty proposes to Saundra, and the happy couple contemplate the day when they can return to Toscania as prince and princess.\n\nMr. Muggs Rides Again - July 1945 - Directed by Wallace Fox\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Ethelbert Aloysius 'Muggs' McGinnis; Huntz Hall as Glimpy; William 'Billy' Benedict as Skinny (as Billy Benedict); Johnny Duncan Johnny Duncan as Squeegie Robinson; Buddy Gorman as (as Bud Gorman); Mende Koenig as Sam; Minerva Urecal as Nora 'Ma' Brown; Nancy Brinckman as Elsie Brown; Bernard Thomas as Gaby O'Neill (as Bernerd Thomas); George Meeker as Dollar Davis; John Henry Allen as Scruno (as John H. Allen); Pierre Watkin as Dr. Fletcher; Milton Kibbee as Veterinarian; Frank Jaquet as Steward Farns\n\nThe boys try to help a jockey who is framed after he refuses to throw a race for a gangster.\n\nAfter an electric \"buzzing\" device is found near his winning horse Turnabout, jockey Muggs is questioned by track officials. Despite his protests that Turnabout's owner, gambler Dollar Davis, and his righthand man, Gaby O'Neill, planted the device on Turnabout so that they could bet against him, Muggs is suspended indefinitely from horseracing. Embittered, Muggs is about to quit racing forever when he and his gang of friends, The East Side Kids, learn that Mrs. Nora Brown, whom they call \"Ma,\" is about to lose her stable because of an unpaid feed bill. Pooling their savings, Muggs and the boys give Ma enough money to pay her debt, which had been bought up by the scheming Davis.\n\nMuggs then insists on caring for Sweet Alice, Ma's other horse, who has a lame leg. After sneaking Alice into the gang's clubhouse in New York's East Side, Muggs tricks an orthopedic specialist into examining her. Although Alice eventually recovers, her presence in the clubhouse is discovered by a policeman, who threatens to arrest the entire gang. Before they are hauled off to jail, however, Ma shows up with her niece Elsie. Having won several races with her prize horse Storm Cloud, Ma is now solvent and able to reclaim Alice and to offer the gang jobs. Ma is anxious to enter Storm Cloud in the upcoming handicap race and agrees to enter Alice too, as a way to boost Storm Cloud's enthusiasm.\n\nWhen Elsie, who is becoming romantically involved with Gaby against Muggs's stern advice, announces she is consulting a fortune teller about the race, Muggs and the boys decide to follow her to the local fair. There, gang member Glimpy dons the drunken fortune-teller's disguise and offers to \"tell\" Elsie's fortune. After Glimpy condemns Gaby, a former East Side Kid, as a double-crosser, a confused Elsie runs away crying. Muggs then calls Gaby a \"four-flusher\" to his face, and later, a guilt-ridden Gaby announces to Davis that he is quitting. Davis, however, orders thugs Joe English and Mike Hanlin to kill Gaby and drug Storm Cloud, the only horse he believes is capable of beating Turnabout in the handicap. When the boys find Storm Cloud drugged and unable to race, they immediately assume Gaby is guilty.\n\nMuggs and Elsie drive to the city to confront Gaby, and on the way, Elsie reveals that Ma wants to win the race because she is terminally ill and needs money for medical and funeral expenses. By the time they arrive at Gaby's, he has been shot and is on his way to the hospital. Unable to question Gaby, Muggs returns to Ma, who announces her decision not to run either horse in the race. Later, however, Ma learns that Gaby has recovered enough to talk and is willing to clear Muggs. When Davis hears the news, he sends Hanlin and English to finish the job on Gaby, and the thugs arrive at the hospital at the same time as Muggs and the gang.\n\nThe boys quickly overwhelm the would-be killers and sneak Gaby out of the hospital. As Gaby and the gang race to meet with the racing official, they are pursued by Hanlin and English. The boys out-drive their enemies and burst into the official's office in time for Gaby to clear Muggs. The official then declares Muggs eligible to race in the handicap, and the next day, Muggs rides Alice to victory. Later, newlyweds Gaby and Elsie take off on their honeymoon with a grateful Ma."
