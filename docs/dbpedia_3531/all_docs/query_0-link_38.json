        "text": "Lee Marvin and his soon-\n\nto-be ex-pal.\n\nForty-five years ago, a new word entered the English language. When Lee Marvin decided to give the heave-ho to his live-in girlfriend Michelle Triola, she took him to court in order to win half his earning for the six years they were together.\n\nSince they were never married, Triola wasn't entitled to alimony. And so she asked for the next best thing: \"palimony\". The judge ruled against her, deciding that \"sleeping with an actor\" didn't count as an occupation.\n\nNow we have \"tolyamory\", which is so new that it doesn't pass the spell-check test yet. Nor, for most people, would it pass the smell test. Tolyamory, to put it simply, is putting up with your spouse's extramarital affairs in order to keep up the cool lifestyle you would lose if you filed for divorce.\n\nWeiner tries hard not throw up as Huma\n\nrings up her lawyer.\n\nNow, I used to call tolyamory \"doormat syndrome\", best exemplified by Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, ex-wife of former online sexual predator and full-time Charlie Callas lookalike Anthony Weiner. (Fun fact: Bill Clinton officiated the wedding, which should have set off alarm bells in Abedin's head.) But at least the one-time Mrs. Weiner eventually decided pride trumped political ambition, while the still-Mrs. Clinton... well, there's no need to rehash her life any further.\n\nAs an amateur etymologist, I didn't need a Masters in Linguistics to figure out the \"toly\" in tolyamory derived from \"tolerate\". And as professional cynic regarding human nature, I knew that cheating spouses -- 99% who are husbands -- will breathe a little easier knowing they have an ace up their sleeves when caught with a sidepiece. \"Haven't you heard, honey -- we're in a tolyamorous relationship! The person I'm cheating with understands, why don't you?\"\n\n\"If I can put up with it, so can you!\"\n\nI couldn't source, though, the person who created the word \"tolyamory\", but it makes me wonder -- was it the person doing the cheating in order to justify their behavior? Or was it the person being cheated on in order to justify the joint checking account? Or was it a single person who's just trying to force us old-timers to get with the program and put up with an unfaithful partner?\n\nAs one of those old-timers, all I can do is sit back and watch in both amusement and pity at the way people twist themselves into Rold Golds by using the latest buzzword instead of taking a hike and asking for alimony. It isn't as cute as \"palimony\", but they'd feel better about themselves.\n\n*********************\n\nHe thinks if he says it enough, it's true.\n\nOver the weekend near the Museum of Modern Art, I saw a line of flatbed\n\ntrucks with LED signs reading ONLY KENNEDY CAN BEAT TRUMP. Considering that the only Kennedy known to have a worm in his brain is roughly 40% behind the former president in the polls, I can only assume that the fine print on the sign completes the sentence as IN SHEER NUTTINESS. And even then, that would be up for debate.\n\nUntil this morning. Who among you had RFK JR, DEAD BEAR, and CENTRAL PARK on your bingo card? If so, you have the luck of the Irish, something that the Kennedy family ironically lacks.\n\nIf he becomes president, this\n\nwill be his official portrait.\n\nI don't know how I had forgotten about a dead bear cub found in Central Park in 2014. Maybe the inauguration of our former idiot mayor Bill de Blasio that same year knocked even an event like that out of my head. And if you lived in New York at that time, you'd understand.\n\nIf you or I had encountered a bear carcass along a country road, we would have likely slowed down, maybe take a picture, and continue on our way, secure that we had a brief but semi-interesting story to tell that evening over dinner with friends.\n\nBut since this is RFK, Jr. -- remember, a worm-brain -- he decided to toss it in the trunk with the idea of bringing it home, skinning it, and putting the meat in the freezer. After posing for a gag photo first. Kenndy sense of humor: dead baby cub = sight gag.\n\nHis meandering excuse for eventually dumping it in Central Park gets more bizarre and, frankly unbelievable as it goes along (especially when he claims not have been drinking at the time) but makes perfect sense to his audience of one, Roseanne Barr. You're not surprised they're friends, are you? (If you haven't read his explanation yet, you can find it in Variety.)\n\nThat is some funny stuff there.\n\nAnd just to show you what a halfwit this guy is, he claims to have been surprised that a\n\nbear carcass in Central Park was a \"funny\" idea, and to have been surprised it made the news the way it did. Just like his uncle and father were stunned the way Marilyn Monroe's death hit the front pages, I'm sure.\n\nThe New Yorker article featuring the bear-in-the-park story also mentions that RFK, Jr. -- despite those LED trucks claiming his odds otherwise -- called Donald Trump, angling for a job running the Dept. of Health & Human Services in the latter's second term. Because who else is more qualified for the post than someone who would likely ban vaccines yet sticks his fingers in a dead bear's mouth?\n\nIn case you'd like a souvenir as well.\n\nBut, to his credit, just to show you how much he cares, he would have taken the job despite telling a friend that Trump was a sociopath, barely human, and the worst president ever. With that kind of spine, I guess the worm-brain is fit for politics after all.\n\n************\n\nI had an idea of sitting a few mornings a week at one of the open-air tables in Times Square with a sign reading FREE LIFE ADVICE FROM AN OLD GUY. NO POLITICS, RELIGION OR FAMILY CRAP DISCUSSED.\n\nBecause you don't wanna be like me.\n\nApart from getting me out of the house for the morning, it would give me the rare opportunity to pass along a lifetime of hard-earned wisdom to what I hoped would be receptive younger people who were currently experiencing problems, quandaries, and general issues similar to those I once did. Each of my answers, I was sure, would inevitably begin with, Well, when I was your age, what I SHOULD have done was...\n\nAltruistic? Oh, naturally. Until I remembered a similar idea from three 30-something women who did the same thing at their own sidewalk table in Greenwich Village. Calling themselves, I believe, The Advice Chicks, they, too, gave advice for a paltry sum in the five-dollar range.\n\nAs word of this hydra-headed Dear Abby got around, the Advice Chicks (or whatever they were called) were written up in the Weekend section of the New York Times. By the end of the week, they had signed a one year, five-figure option deal for their story with Robert De Niro's production company.\n\nA similar scenario played out in my head, although the old guy angle would probably be a better fit for the Post or Daily News. A movie deal was less likely, since there can be only two movies a year with older characters in the lead, and Jack Nicholson is retired. But maybe, maybe a publisher would take a chance on a book. Something like Tuesdays with Morrie, if Morrie wrote it himself.\n\nSo far, so greedy. I then stepped back a moment, pondering the fates of other recent, out-of-nowhere pop culture figures. Many fell victim to self-styled internet sleuths whose sole mission is look for perceived personal and moral failures of the new celeb on the block. Googling the target's name, they look for anything on social media that makes him or her look bad by whatever standards people are supposed to live up to today (or tomorrow).\n\nBut I never took the wrong turn at\n\nAlburquerque.\n\nAnybody who doesn't know me can cherry-pick, misquote, or take out of context over a few decades' worth of stuff I've written for various publications and that still exist online. My politics have zig-zagged more than Bugs Bunny tunneling underground. And, if you've read this blog long enough, you know I have few kind things to say about celebrities or politicians of any kind.\n\nThe idea of being \"cancelled\" didn't bother me. But always ready to go the extra mile when it comes to considering the worst outcomes of any situation, I was concerned about two things.\n\nThe first was having a large group of self-righteous youngsters banging drums, blowing whistles, and yelling insults outside my building. Not only would this put a crimp on dinner for my wife and me, more importantly it would tick off everyone else in the co-op. Never piss off your co-op neighbors.\n\nThe second, more serious possibility was my daughter facing an embarrassment far more serious than whatever dads usually do. There was also an excellent chance that she would be put on the spot, not so much by her friends who knew the real me (such as I am), but acquaintances and even strangers.\n\nOnce they learned her last name, the inquisition would begin. Wait -- is that guy in New York your dad? Did you know he was like this? Was he ALWAYS like this? Have you tried to set him straight? What are you going to do about it? You've got to pick a side -- are you with HIM? Or US?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you want to stay on\n\nthis guy's good side.\n\nI didn't want my aspiring urban-planner daughter beginning her post-college life on the wrong side of a 1984-style third degree where she felt obliged to give up dear ol' dad in exchange for cultural acceptance or, worse, a career. But if that's what it took to get a job, I was ready to forego any future Father's Day Facetimes. I've lived my life. Let the girl live hers.\n\nWowee, that's some noble sacrifice there. Or would be if things really played out like this, which it probably wouldn't. There's a very good chance this is primarily just me looking for an excuse to stay in my air-conditioned apartment during this miserable weather -- which, if the emails I receive from City Hall are any indication, is the right thing to do. Let's revisit this idea in the fall, unless global warming really is here to stay.\n\nWe have ways of making you regret\n\nbuying a movie ticket.\n\nPS: If you don't recall watching something called The Advice Chicks, you aren't the only one. Nobody on De Niro's team could come up with an idea to support a 90-minute romcom about three yentas horning in on people's lives.\n\nInstead, De Niro produced and starred in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Bet you didn't see that one, either.\n\n*************\n\nObscurities rule the day here, as, I suppose, they always do. All are worth a watch but for different reasons. Unfortunately, none of them apply to anybody but me.\n\nBE YOURSELF! (1930): So associated is Barbra Streisand to Funny Girl is that\n\nit's almost impossible to remember there really was a Fannie Brice. It doesn't help that she starred in only two movies (her first, made in 1928, is long lost), while took supporting or guest roles in just five others. As with her fellow Broadway star Frank Fay, Brice could never make a successful transition to film. If Be Yourself! is any indication, the problem could be bad scripts.\n\n\"Dopey\" is the only description that could be given to the movie itself. Be Yourself! is the story of entertainer Fannie Field who, with her younger brother Harry, takes over the management -- and drops plenty of dough on -- punch-drunk boxer Jerry Moore, with whom she is inexplicably in love. Fannie's rival, Lillian, drops her boxer boyfriend McCloskey for Jerry as his star rises and head grows fat, which was likely supposed to remind audiences of Brice's ill-fated real-life marriage to layabout criminal Nicky Arnstein. I'm sure she appreciated the writers' thoughtfulness.\n\nWhile Brice's comedic Yiddish accent comes and goes depending on her mood, Harry Green (as her brother) puts his into overdrive; initially amusing, it quickly becomes grating, as does his character -- Fannie paid for his education, and all he has to show for it is winning six cents in damages for a client. But nobody is worse than Robert Armstrong as Jerry, whose allegedly funny delivery is poor beyond belief. And neither he nor G. Pat Collins as McCloskey, are remotely believable as boxers -- or as professional actors. (Armstrong would do better in dramas starting with King Kong.)\n\nThis leaves Fannie Brice to save whatever day is left by singing six songs. What's most interesting is how her looks change with each style -- plain with pop, goofy as comic, and unexpectedly pretty with torch, thanks to a combination of camera angles, make-up, wardrobe, and acting. She's a talent, no question, but Be Yourself! is strictly for movie nerds and Fannie Brice fans -- are than any around for a woman who died in 1951? -- and is best appreciated as 62 minutes of history that give a faded idea of why she was popular everywhere but movie theaters.\n\nBONUS POINTS: Early on, Jerry Moore tells Fannie, \"Gee, you're a funny girl.\" Coincidence?\n\nTHE BLACK CAMEL (1931): Unlike other Charlie Chan movies, the real fun in The Black Camel is everything but the mystery. (If you're interested, actress Shelah Fane is murdered a few years after the murder of her lover, with a self-styled seer named Tarneverro being the likely suspect.)\n\nOK, on to the good stuff. The Black Camel was one of the five original Chan movies thought lost in Fox Film's film storage fire in the mid-'30s, before a print unexpectedly turned up decades later. It was also the only one filmed on location in Hawaii (Chan being an Inspector on the Honolulu Police Department), allowing us to see the then-territory long before it became a relatively common tourist destination. The classy Royal Hawaiian Hotel allowed filming on its property as well; if it's still as beautiful as it was then, you just know the tourists aren't as well dressed.\n\nBut the cast! The cast! Bela Lugosi co-stars as Tarneverro, the same year as Dracula. Dwight Frye, legendary as Dracula's slave Renfield, is a suspicious butler. Robert Young, 40 years before Marcus Welby, MD, is Jimmy Bradshaw, dreaming of becoming a professional slogan writer (a typical '30s movie trope). Mary Gordon, the housekeeper in the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies, who has information that helps Chan break the case wide open. I almost needed a tranquilizer to handle The Black Camel's parade of iconic character actors. (A familiar character here is the starving artist with a British accent and pseudo-philosophical dialogue.)\n\nThe movie also provides a rare scene with Chan's 12 slang-slinging children at the (long) breakfast table. None of the sons were old enough yet to be his incompetent sidekick, leaving that job to Otto Yamaoka as Kashimo, who spends most of the time running around Waikiki on wild nene chases. (If you know that the nene is Hawaii's state bird, it's a funny joke.) Yet for my money, the best moment is when Lugosi first meets Oland. Bela appears to genuinely enjoy their bantering, as if relieved to be rid of the Dracula cape in order to play a \"normal\" character part. While Charlie Chan at the Opera (co-starring Boris Karloff!) is often cited as the best Chan picture, The Black Camel is the most entertaining.\n\nBONUS POINTS: In the strangest moment of any Chan movie, a bunch of real locals and tourists stand around gawking at the filming of The Black Camel on a beach. Good thing cellphones and TikTok hadn't been invented yet.\n\nEL FANTASMA DE CONVENTO (THE PHANTOM OF THE MONASTERY) (1934): Well, that title\n\nis one way to get audiences to think of an earlier horror movie. Still, this Mexican thriller stands on its own, and without a falling chandelier in sight -- even if, by the end, we see one has already fallen.\n\nAfter getting lost on an evening hike, married couple Eduardo and Cristina, along with their friend Alfonso, are led to a centuries-old monastery by a strange monk. Hoping simply for a night's shelter and a little dinner, the trio encounter empty coffins, self-flagellation, the shadow of an invisible bat, and over a dozen of the weirdest old monks south of the border. As Cristina and Alfonso fall in lust, the padre tells them the story of a fellow monk who sought shelter there after desiring his best friend's wife... and summoning Satan in order to get the guy out of the way... only to have Satan kill the wife and eventually the monk, who now won't let himself stay buried. Cristina seems to believe this is a good risk for Alfonso to take, while he gradually comes around to her way of thinking. Ahh, young love!\n\nAs with other Mexican horror movies of the time, The Phantom of the Monastery is heavy on religious imagery atmosphere, eerie sounds, and an occasionally bombastic score which often distracts from the previous three things. But nothing can distract from the amorous looks Cristina gives Alfonso right in front of her husband, who is the only one who realizes that something very strange is happening all around them and wants to scram. (Sometimes what appears to be cowardice is actually intelligence.)\n\nThe scariest moments, other than the dead monk lying in his bed, are the most subtle. Two of them are courtesy of Marta Roel (Cristina), whose lust for Alfonso are signaled with just a brief change of facial expressions -- she's definitely under the control of something (or someone) otherworldly. The other is from Enrique del Campo (Alfonso), whose decision to hire Satan for Eduardo's murder is seen only in his eyes. I couldn't tell if it was a trick of the lighting, del Campo's acting skills, or both, but it's one of the movie's most memorable moments. While its predictable finalegoes a little long, The Phantom of the Monastery proves that Mexico could, in its own way, match, and maybe surpass, the creep factor in Hollywood horror/thrillers, while throwing in a few surprises of its own.\n\nBONUS POINTS: The mummified dead monk letting Alfonso know where to find Satan's instruction book. You have to see it to appreciate it.\n\nHITLER: DEAD OR ALIVE (1943): Imagine Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds with a budget of a two-week car rental, and you've got Hitler: Dead or Alive. Three goofy gangsters -- Steve, Dutch, and Joe -- have been promised one million dollars by a patriotic American if they successfully kidnap Hitler and bring him back the US to face justice. Sound impossible? Not when the trio join the Canadian Army; hijacks a military plane to parachute into enemy territory, where every German speaks perfect English; and the country is filled with citizens willing to help them. Why didn't anybody think of this in real life?\n\nContemporary audiences unfamiliar with movies like Hitler: Dead or Alive would likely be astounded how a silly, low budget piece of claptrap that made no sense entertained ticket-buyers in 1943. Easy! War-weary folks wanted to be distracted by silly, low budget pieces of claptrap that made no sense -- especially at a time when civilization was hanging in the balance. It was just one of many farces like Hal Roach's The Devil with Hitler and Nazty Nuisance turning Shicklgruber into a laughingstock.\n\nThe biggest actor here, figuratively and literally, is Ward Bond as Steve, while familiar comedic wise guy Warren Hymer does his usual \"Gee, boss\" routine as Dutch. Bobby Watson, who portrayed Hitler in the two Roach comedies, repeats the role here, where he's billed as Bob Watson, perhaps reflecting his more serious portrayal. That is, as serious as can be when Ward Bond forcibly shaves off the moustache hiding a scar to make sure this Hitler isn't a body double.\n\nThings get dramatic at the climax when German soldiers, having captured the gangsters, mistakenly kill the clean-shaven Hitler before turning their rifles on four neighborhood children just because. Ward Bond gives an impassioned speech straight to the camera warning us that the Nazis must be stopped. When you consider Bond was one of Hollywood's most passionate right-wing antisemites, it's a brilliant performance. If nothing else, Hitler: Dead or Alive gives an idea of what movie audiences willingly sat through anything to get away from bad news. Which means you might enjoy it today.\n\nBONUS POINTS: As cheap as any movie ever made, The Devil with Hitler was filmed at something called Fine Arts Studios.\n\n*********************\n\nC'mon, guys, stick to the script!\n\nI've probably mentioned it before, but for a while I got into listening to recordings of the JFK assassination radio coverage. Not for pleasure, but to note how the early reports were either wrong, soon forgotten, or confused. For instance, did you know that JFK and Texas Governor John Connally were immediately killed in their car? Now you do!\n\nLast Friday morning, there was a rather frightening news item that came across the wire. Frightening for us because it happened four blocks away. It seemed that two women were murdered -- at 9:00 a.m.! -- on East 88th Street, near Gracie Mansion, the official home of the Mayor of New York -- in this case, Eric Adams, who allegedly lives in a Newark condo, but we'll let that pass.\n\nThe murderers were unidentified, but those famous early reports hinted they were two men who were spotted close by the victims. Ah ha! A drug deal gone wrong? Illegal migrants? Simple thievery? No matter, it was just another example of crime in our quiet neighborhood getting out of control.\n\nUntil, hours later, the facts came in:\n\nA terminally ill retiree shot dead her former daughter-in-law and then herself on a quiet Upper East Side street Friday — the tragic capstone to a bitter custody dispute over her toddler granddaughter.\n\nThe shocking murder-suicide unfolded along East 88th Street, down the block from Gracie Mansion, just before 9 a.m., when ex-Chicago probation officer Kathleen Leigh, 65, twice shot 45-year-old mom of two Marisa Galloway, police said.\n\nGalloway, a special education teacher, had just loaded her 1-year-old daughter into the backseat of a parked white Honda Civic when Leigh blasted her in the head and back before turning the gun on herself, cops said.\n\nOur caring neighbors.\n\nLeigh was shot in order for her son to win custody of his daughter -- not the one year-old, who had a different father, but their four year-old.As one of the cops told the New York Post, \"I've seen a lot of shit, but this is biblical shit.\" Sounds like a George Carlin quote.\n\nSorry for the distance.\n\nThe two men hinted as the killers? Just a couple of guys walking by who\n\npresumably notified the cops.\n\nThe saddest part of this undeniably sad story? It made us Upper East Siders feel safer knowing it didn't involve drugs, migrants, or thievery.\n\nBy the way, I took the above photo on the right four hours after the crime happened, with the block roped off from vehicular and pedestrian traffic. I'd have been there earlier but was elsewhere when the biblical shit went down. Maybe next time I'll be a little more johnny-on-the-spot.\n\n*******************\n\nDon't try so hard.\n\nI've made no secret of my disdain of fellow baby-boomers for their constant complaints about how nothing is as good as it used to be in their day.\n\nAnd, as they believe words like \"Dumbocrat\" and \"Rethuglicans\" are hilariously original, so do they their overuse of proclamations beginning with \"I remember when\", as in \"I remember when you didn't have to show your ID to get on an airplane.\"\n\nThese are the same people who, today, would have objected to seat belts, speed limits, and drivers licenses had they been introduced now. Here are some more \"I remember whens\" going around like a bad cold, with rejoinders guaranteed to shut them up, or, unfortunately, get them to respond with their own nasty comments.\n\nI REMEMBER WHEN...\n\n...climate change was called summer. I'm sorry, did you grow up in Death Valley?\n\n... gays kept to themselves. Because they didn't want to get the shit kicked out of them.\n\n... MTV played music videos. YouTube, my man, YouTube. And you don't have to wait two hours to see the video you tuned in for!\n\n... you weren't required to get vaccines. Not if you If you grew up before Jonas Salk helped save your life, you don't.\n\n... pay phones. You do pay your iPhone bill regularly, yes?\n\n... people got dressed up to go to a restaurant. When was the last time you wore a suit other than for work a funeral? Wait, you don't own a suit, do you?\n\n... we could all laugh at jokes no matter what our color or background. Except for the people who were the butt of the jokes.\n\n... kids went to school to learn, not be indoctrinated. How much algebra, history, and chemistry classes do you remember?\n\n... you could wear suntan lotion instead of being told to wear sunblock. That's why you have skin cancer now.\n\n... they were the Ten Commandments, not Suggestions. Except for the ones you broke.\n\n... Top 40 music had real melodies. I've got 50 bucks that says you listened to Led Zeppelin.\n\n... Pop songs had real lyrics. Wanna whole lotta love, wanna whole lotta love, wanna whole lotta love.\n\n... news anchors gave you the news. And viewers believed in facts.\n\n... you didn't have to pay for drinking water. I must have been out of the house the day government officials installed a pay slot on my faucets.\n\n... we didn't talk in stupid slang like kids do now. Far out! You must've been hip! And groovy! What an outta sight time you lived in! Bummer things have changed. Gotta split now!\n\n************\n\nI will definitely continue doing this.\n\nIn addition to having news items I ignore, my Microsoft homepage features\n\nwhat might be called thought pieces by people whose thoughts you otherwise wouldn't be interested in.\n\nThis morning there was a piece entitled \"I Am Over 60 and I Will Never Do These Things Again.\" Most of them the usual \"Look how good I am\": Never chasing after approval, taking relationships for granted, living in the past.\n\nIn other words, nothing to see here, folks, just the usual pat-on-the-backs that every over-60 has said at one time or another. But it encouraged me to list my own list -- and I daresay they'll resonate with more people than \"I'll never ignore fruits and vegetables.\"\n\nSo now that I'm over 60 (closer to 70, actually), I will never do these 14 things again:\n\n1) Have sex after 9:00 p.m. I'm not saying this is my choice necessarily, just stating a fact.\n\n2) Sleep through the night without having to take a leak every 90 minutes.\n\n3) Remember that I need a new jar of cumin when making a shopping list.\n\n4) Ponder life's deeper meanings. I just accept the world is going to hell.\n\n5) Read a novel just because it's supposed to be a classic. Life's too short to slog through Bleak House, and people who say otherwise are lying. (A college teacher actually did assign my class to read Bleak House. After reading the first 10 pages I put it away and promptly forgot there was going to be a test on it at the end of the term. I have no idea how I bluffed my way through it.)\n\n6) Not to always feel obliged to walk two blocks in order to drop food scraps in the composting bin when the trash cans are in the basement. Garbage is garbage.\n\n7) Ignore #6 when my wife orders me to take food scraps to the composting bin.\n\n8) Not eavesdrop on another person's cellphone call when they're near me in public. You lose your right to privacy once you step outside your front door, bub, and I enjoy feeling superior when you're having a fight with your spouse.\n\n9) Pretend to enjoy classical music at New York's free concerts in Central Park. Just once, could they perform stuff we know?\n\n10) Pretend to understand the dialogue in New York's free Shakespeare in the Park. No way would I pay good money to listen to that gobbledy-gook.\n\n11) Nod in agreement as fellow baby-boomers complain, \"Top 40 sucks these days.\" You're not the target audience, and your parents said the same thing about the music you liked.\n\n12) Admit that Top 40 sucks these days.\n\n13) Use the phrases, \"At the end of the day\", \"FYI\", \"Thinking outside the box\" and the words \"Literally\", \"Amazing\" and \"Surreal\". For God's sake, people, think outside the box!\n\n14) Use my Microsoft homepage as an influence do anything other than switch to Chrome.\n\n**********\n\nThe only thing these four movies have in common is murder. I must get out in the fresh air some more.\n\nPICCADILLY (1929): Likely one of the last great silent movies out of the UK, Piccadilly is probably one of the handsomest as well, a big-budget drama that could pass for a major US studio release (no offense to the British film industry), and a terrific vehicle for German director E.A. DuPont as much as its star Asian-American legend Anna May Wong. From its clever opening credits (resembling bus advertisements) to its ironic closing images, Piccadilly is often startingly entertaining.\n\nFor some sensitive souls, its story might border on -- oh heck, let's say proudly resides in -- Asian-fetishization. Which is the whole point, children. Nightclub owner Valentine Wilmot falls hard for scullery-worker-turned dancer Shosho. This puts him in dutch with Mabel Greenfield, his club's former star and longtime paramour. Shosho, having lived forever in a Limehouse flophouse, is more than willing to take advantage of Wilmot's attentions, even if it means risking the relationship with her Chinese boyfriend Jim. Both Jim and Mabel notice what's going on; sooner or later one of these saps is going to snap.\n\nOne of Piccadilly's more interesting takes is how the principal Chinese characters positively drip with contempt for their white \"betters\". (King Hou Chang, as Jim, puts a whole new spin on the fine art of sneering.) Say what you want about Wong's Shosho, she is 100% in charge of her relationship with Wilmot, even when such a thing was, if not verboten, at least frowned upon. (It's easy to think that top-billed Gilda Gray felt like her character Mabel while watching Wong steal the movie from under her dancing feet.)\n\nAside from Jameson Thomas as Wilmot, a couple of other actors are worth a mention. If you were one of those kids in the 60s who watched Mary Martin's Peter Pan, you'll likely not recognize its Captain Hook, Cyril Ritchard, in his brief role as a dancer. But you absolutely cannot miss 30 year-old Charles Laughton in his even briefer part as the grotesque, demanding guest eating dinner at the club, in what looks like the prototype for the character of Mr. Creosote in Monty Python and the Meaning of Life. Almost a century after its release, the British Film Institute's restored print of Piccadilly (and its classy new score) can easily hold the attention of a willing, receptive audience.\n\nBONUS POINTS: Piccadilly has a five-minute sound prologue featuring Jameson Thomas and an unidentified actor setting up the story, filmed as a sop for audiences who were already turning their back on silents. Technically crude and creaky, it's a harbinger for what movies would become for the next year or two before coming up to speed.\n\nTHE KISS BEFORE THE MIRROR (1933): Vienna: Land of sausages! Snow globes! Murdering your wife for cheating on you! Well, at least that what Walter Bernsdorf thinks. As his lawyer, Paul Held, tries to put together a defense, he discovers that his wife, Maria, is behaving identically to how Walter's wife Lucy did before her demise. If a plea of momentary insanity works in Walter's case, then it should in Paul's, yes?\n\nAlthough a Universal picture, The Kiss Before the Mirror gives off Paramount vibes with its glossy sophistication. All credit goes to its unlikely director James Whale, between his classics Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. Perhaps interested in discombobulating his audience, Whale sets up the movie as a typical romantic comedy of the time, allowing viewers to live vicariously through the adulterous lovers, before Walter unexpectedly shows up to blow his wife's brains out. It's a director's way of saying, Not so cute, is it?\n\nPaul Lukas, as Walter, is a little pathetic -- why do these \"mature\" guys marry younger women who are way too sexy for them? Yet he offers to plead guilty to murder rather than see Paul kill Maria. And what a pleasure that Paul is played by Frank Morgan, who, as with his appearance in Any Number Can Play, easily makes you forget his dithering comedic parts. This guy had far more range than given credit for.\n\nThe Kiss Before the Mirror's nominal star, Nancy Carroll, is Maria (another wife too young for her husband!), whose sweet-on-the-surface behavior flips when Paul rightly suspects her of adultery. But the more interesting casting choice is Walter Pidgeon in his five-minute role of Walter's wife's paramour. Pidgeon's leading man career had momentarily derailed; perhaps Whale took pity on a fellow gay man by giving him what looks like a one-day job. (Pidgeon's primping and pirouetting before his date with Lucy appears to be a deliberate directorial signal to hipper audiences of the day). A forgotten gem, The Kiss Before the Mirror is marred only by what seems to be a studio-imposed happy ending -- which is nicely undercut by a shattered mirror symbolizing Paul and Maria's very imperfect future together. At least that's how I see it.\n\nBONUS POINTS: Michael Mark, best known as the father of the drowned little girl in Frankenstein, is a courtroom spectator. James Whale sure was good to his friends and actors.\n\nWHEN STRANGERS MARRY (1944): At the time of When Strangers Marry's release, Orson Welles declared the modest B-picture better directed (by William Castle) and acted than two recently acclaimed big budget releases, Double Indemnity and Laura. And while Welles's opinion is up for debate, When Strangers Marry is nevertheless several cuts above the average B of the time.\n\nIn presenting the story of a woman's marriage to a man she's known only three days -- and soon suspects of murder -- Castle manages to evoke more unease than the story has already. Sudden noises, harsh neon lights, confusion as to whether she's seen her husband or has hallucinated him -- no scene ends without a moment of foreboding. No supporting character actor looks ordinary when weird will do. In portraying the couple, Kim Hunter and Dean Jagger manage to squeeze every drop of angst the story offers, while soaking up some more and wringing it out again. Her husband, after all, is a killer... isn't he?\n\nKim's ally in this nightmare is Fred Graham, played by a fellow named Bob Mitchum. It would be interesting to know what audiences at the time thought of the tall, sleepy-eyed, drawling actor, seeing that even for a B movie he was way different from others of the day. It's a good bet that co-star Neil Hamilton, a veteran of silents, probably looked upon him as other older actors did Marlon Brando some years later: Who is this guy, where is he from, and why does he talk like that?\n\nWithin a year, when everyone definitely knew who he was, Monogram re-released When Strangers Marry as Betrayed, changing Bob to Robert to reflect his \"new\" billing in his star-making role in The Story of GI Joe, and bumping him from third to first place in the credits. As with Humphrey Bogart \"starring\" in a 16 year-old movie Call it Murder originally titled Midnight, Mitchum probably had a good laugh and toasted the ticket-buyers who were fooled into watching the same movie twice. But you know what? It was worth it. When Strangers Meet may not be Double Indemnity, but it's singularly fascinating, almost entirely thanks to William Castle's unique vision.\n\nBONUS POINTS: The nearly dialogue-free sequence of Mildred and Paul avoiding the police by wandering through Harlem before winding up at a gin joint is brilliant, and possible only in a B movie.\n\nGREEN FOR DANGER (1946): At a small-town hospital in wartime England, Police Inspector Cockrill investigates the mysterious death of patient Joseph Higgins and flat-out murder of Nurse Bates. Sizing up two doctors and three nurses, Cockrill notes that they're the only ones who were connected to the victims. When one of them, Nurse Freddie Linley, almost becomes the third victim, Cockrill decides he can break the case with a scheme that could leave her on death's door a second time.\n\nThe British production Green for Danger is as good an example as any of David Mamet's dictum that any movie can be improved by getting rid of the first 10 minutes. Over half an hour is needed setting up the suspects' personal, psychological and sexual conflicts that would make Fleetwood Mac envious. But when Inspector Cockrill finally takes charge, the story finally works up to a good trot.\n\nAs with all good vintage mysteries, Green for Danger's suspects appear to have a motive, or at least act that way, so that our suspicions of the guilty party shift from moment to moment. A love triangle involving Nurse Freddie and the two doctors? The anesthesiologist's previous accidental patient death becoming known? And why did the mailman insist he heard a nurse's voice somewhere recently -- like maybe on a Nazi shortwave propaganda broadcast -- just before his death?\n\nYet none of this would matter without Alastair Sim's wonderful, hilarious portrayal of the inscrutable Cockrill. The inspector takes delight in needling the suspects with his keen mind, dry wit, and quiet sarcasm. With a slouched manner and cool fedora, Sims makes Cockrill the British Sam Spade, only funny. Had Green for Danger starred almost any other British actor of the '40s, it would be a pleasant if unremarkable 90 minutes. With the brilliant Alastair Sim running the show, it proves how a truly great actor can, depending on your point of view, elevate a project or fool you into thinking you're watching a movie better than it really is.\n\nBONUS POINTS: Despite the credits reading \"Presenting Alastair Sim as Inspector Cockrill\", this was his 35th movie appearance in 11 years. Either Green for Danger was intended as the first in a series with the Cockrill character, or someone at the studio was really unfamiliar with his C.V.\n\n***************"
