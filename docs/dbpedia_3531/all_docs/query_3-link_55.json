        "text": "How a child of 4 touched the hearts of a band of race-track ruffians is told in \"Little Miss Marker,\" the current film at the Paramount. This picture is a delight in many respects, for it has been produced so pleasingly and with such efficient portrayals that only a dyed-in-the-wool cynic could fail to be affected by its sterling humor and pathos. The story, one written by Damon Runyon, is blessed with originality and it has been adapted to the screen in an understanding fashion.Considering that some of the adult characters are known by such names as Sorrowful Jones, Bangles Carson, a torch singer; Big Steve, Regret, Sun Rise, Dizzy Memphis, Buggs, Sore Toe and Bonnie the Gouge, it is surprising that the tale possesses so much tenderness and charm. The closing incidents may seem superfluous and somewhat melodramatic, but even so they are set forth with a measure of suspense.Little Shirley Temple, the lovely tiny lass of \"Stand Up and Cheer,\" is virtually the stellar performer in the present work, and no more engaging child has been beheld on the screen. She appears as Little Miss Marker, so named because she is left with the bookmaker, Sorrowful Jones (Adolphe Menjou), virtually in pawn for her father's $20 bet. Jones is averse to taking the so-called \"markers,\" but Marky, as she eventually becomes known, attracts his attention. The father does not return and it is understood that he ended his unhappy existence with a bullet.Marky, who at the moment is filled with a child's story of King Arthur, looks upon the rough persons she encounters as Knights of the Round Table. She picks her Sir Launcelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Percival, and Bangles Carson is, of course, Lady Guinevere.The gloomy Jones, incidentally no fashion plate, finds himself in the somewhat awkward predicament of having to care for the youngster. While he is preparing a bed for her with chairs, she bounces into the big bed and then insists on Jones reading to her until she falls asleep. He reads from a race-track sheet and the names of the horses and some of the turf colloquialisms rather fascinate the youngster.All these turf touts, from the forbidding specimens to others who can boast of better looks, take an interest in Marky, but several of the child's Knights ridicule Jones, particularly when he, a past master in parsimony, pays out more than $50 for clothes for Marky. The pagan Jones also is asked by Marky about God and soon the bookmaker dictates a little prayer which Marky repeats after him. She makes requests of her own accord, including asking God for new clothes for Sorrowful Jones. And the next day he goes forth and invests in a suit.As time goes on, environment tarnishes Marky and she forgets her knights in shining armor and her appealing simple patter is lost in a flood of argot. This prompts the race-track crooks and Bangles Carson to have a round-table dinner in a private room of a nightclub, with all the guests arrayed in costumes, Marky being dressed as a Princess. Two cheap pugilists arrive at the party in armor. Apparently this show of King Arthur's knights does not convince the juvenile sophisticate, but when her charger in trappings—actually a race horse which had been doped on several occasions—is brought into the room Marky surrenders.The penultimate phase of the narrative is somewhat lurid, but it does not detract from the effectiveness of what has gone before. Tiny Shirley Temple is a joy to behold and her spontaneity and cheer in speaking her lines are nothing short of amazing. Mr. Menjou has given much fine acting to pictures, but he has never done anything better than his characterization of Sorrowful Jones. Dorothy Dell as Bangles Carson also contributes real talent. Lynn Overman, Sam Hardy, Warren Hymer and Frank McGlynn Sr. are among those who make the most of their good opportunities.On the stage is Dave Appllon's \"Continental Revue,\" with Mr. Apollon, Danzi Goodell, Diffin and Draper, Bob Ripa, Nora Williams, Jean, Ruth and Gail, the Eight Debutantes and the Hawaiian Band.\n\nLITTLE MISS MARKER, based on the story by Damon Runyon; music and lyrics by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin; directed by Alexander Hall; a Paramount production.
