        "text": "Favourite Movies: The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)\n\nWhat sort of movie strikes your fancy these days? A period picture with glamourous costumes and well-spoken characters to take you out of the mundane present? A great love story with attractive, all-too-human individuals? A cat and mouse game between clever and evenly matched antagonists? Adventure with the stakes nothing less than life and death? Poetry?\n\nThey seek him here, They seek him there\n\nThose Frenchies seek him everywhere\n\nIs he in heaven? Is he in hell?\n\nThat demned, elusive Pimpernel.\n\nCan you spot the Scarlet Pimpernel?\n\nPerhaps the world's first literary \"super hero\", Sir Percy Blakeney encourages the world to accept his foppish behavior as his true character while masquerading as the Scarlet Pimpernel, the daring mastermind of a league of like-minded adventurers who rescue those doomed to the guillotine during the 16th century French Revolution. Baroness Orczy's play opened in London's West End with little acclaim from the critics, but great success with audiences. She followed up on that success with a novelization and sequels. Dustin Farnum starred in a 1917 version of the story and there have been many film and TV adaptions since that time, a Broadway musical, and the IMDb listing the title as currently \"under production\". The idea of the disguised or misunderstood daredevil or crime fighter appears to be timeless.\n\nThe 1934 version of The Scarlet Pimpernel is from London Pictures at a time when Alexander Korda and his brothers were putting British filmmaking on the world map with such popular fare as The Private Life of Henry VIII, The Ghost Goes West, Things to Come and Rembrandt. The director is film editor Harold Young hired to replace the fired Rowland Brown. I don't like to be one to disparage someone's art, but despite my fondness for The Mummy's Tomb there is nothing else in Mr. Young's filmography that reaches the level of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I am led to think that the Korda attention to the quality and details of their output has more than a little to do with the virtues of this movie.\n\nCount de Tournay's family is rescued.\n\nThe focus of the Pimpernel's latest escapade is the release of the de Tournay family. We learn that the Count de Tournay is more than just a hated Aristo in a conversation with some fellow prisoners.\n\nUnnamed nobleman: \"Thank Heavens for the game of chess. It enables us to forget the more disagreeable realities of life.\"\n\nCount de Tournay: \"I'm not so sure it is a good thing. We've been too detached from reality all our lives. That's what caused the revolution.\"\n\nNobleman: \"Possibly.\"\n\nCount de Tournay: \"Undoubtedly. If we'd only had eyes to see our own follies we shouldn't be here now waiting to be shaved by the national razor.\"\n\nAt a splendid ball the Prince of Wales defends the lack of action on the part of his government to Countess de Tounay: \"Madam, the government does everything in its power to save those who are threatened by death in the prisons of the French Republic. But if a country goes mad, it has the right to commit every horror within its own walls.\"\n\nPercy Blakeney, through misunderstanding and a lack of communication has come to believe his wife responsible for the deaths of an aristocratic family named St. Cyr. It is partly his reason for bedeviling the French with his remarkable escapades and myriad disguises. The other, greater part of Percy's involvement is in his own nature; his audacious cleverness and natural strengths as a leader.\n\nLady Marguerite Blakeney is a former actress who married for love, but now finds her husband's affections turned cold and his character strangely altered. They are a very unhappy couple. The new ambassador to England is M. Chauvelin who must discover the Pimpernel's identify at all costs or he will join the unending line to the guillotine. He blackmails Marguerite with threats to her brother into assisting his search for the Pimpernel. Chauvelin has determined through their knowledge of the french language and entitled boldness that the Pimpernel and his gang must be among the upper class where Marguerite can freely question and observe.\n\nPercy shares his poem to an amused audience.\n\nLeslie Howard plays Sir Percy and he is magnificent. Howard had taken up acting as therapy for \"shell shock\" after WWI and his career covered both sides of the Atlantic on both stage and screen. It is a pleasure to watch him as Sir Percy, dandy of the court and a favourite of the Prince of Wales (George IV) commenting on fashion and other trivialities, making himself an indispensable social butterfly without a serious thought in his head. As the Pimpernel he disguises himself as a garrulous old hag and a french army officer. The Pimpernel is always one step ahead of his enemies and he enjoys the intellectual combat as much as the chase. Madly in love with Marguerite, but mistakenly disillusioned, Percy is also heartsick and wounded.\n\nThe glamorous Lady Blakeney\n\nMerle Oberson is a beautiful Lady Blakeney, and more. She is trapped by both her marriage and by Chauvelin. She is passionate about her emotions and as quick-witted as any of the Pimpernel League, and quick to action when circumstances require bravery. Lady Blakeney does not sit in a corner looking pretty, although she does look very pretty indeed in gowns designed by Oliver Messel, multiple Tony nominee for sets and costumes. Percy and Marguerite are perfectly matched. Will they find their way back to each other?\n\nSir Percy teaches M. Chauvelin a thing or two about cravats.\n\nRaymond Massey is that supreme villain, M. Chauvelin. Chauvelin has power, he knows it and uses it. No one sneers quite as sincerely as Massey and he sneers at the English, at Sir Percy and at Lady Blakeney. He toys with them both and skillfully lays a trap from which there is no escape. To watch Chauvelin's confident arrogance pitted against Percy's slyness is like listening to a fine operatic duet. Two actors supremely good at what they do with a script to match.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel is a story that has enthralled generations and the Korda film production is one of its finest tellings. Leslie Howard would return to this theme in a few years when, sadly, another country went mad. In 1941s Pimpernel Smith, Howard plays Professor Horatio Smith, a mild-mannered archeologist who smuggles victims of Nazi persecution out of Germany with the help of his worshiping students. Perhaps there are some \"Pimpernels\" with 21st century stories to tell.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nTHE MADELEINE CARROLL BLOGATHON: ON THE AVENUE (1937)\n\nThe Madeleine Carroll blogathon is underway, hosted by our friends Dorian of Tales of the Easily Distracted and Ruth of Silver Screenings and running on February 26th and 27th.\n\nMadeleine Carroll began her screen acting career toward the end of the silent era. She transitioned seamlessly to sound and became a beloved star in her native England. Playing the role of Pamela in Alfred Hitchcock 1935 international hit The 39 Steps spread Miss Carroll's fame beyond Britain and, as was to be expected, Hollywood came calling. Paramount Pictures secured her contract and she was quickly starred in The Case Against Mrs. Ames opposite George Brent and The General Died at Dawn with Gary Cooper. Her next few pictures would all be on loan out to the recently formed 20th Century Fox (Lloyds of London), Columbia (It's All Yours) and David O. Selznick (The Prisoner of Zenda).\n\nIt was 20th Century Fox that cast Madeleine in her one and only musical, Irving Berlin's On the Avenue. Her character sings a line in the reprise of a song in the film's finale, but I don't know if that is Miss Carroll's voice or not. If it is her voice, it is charming and if it isn't - well, extra musical talent this movie didn't need. Dick Powell from Warner Bros., Fox up-and-comer Alice Faye and The Ritz Brothers top this show business story.\n\nPowell plays Gary Blake, the writer and star of a new Broadway revue, not dissimilar to Irving Berlin's 1933 hit As Thousands Cheer. A popular skit in the show is a lampoon of the wealthy Caraway family, George Barbier as the Commodore and Madeleine Carroll as Mimi, the richest girl in America. First-nighters the Caraways and Mimi's current beau, the explorer Frederick Sims played by Alan Mowbray are not amused. The Commodore is determined to sue everyone involved in the show. Mimi takes a more direct approach by bulldozing her way backstage and slapping Gary Blake. However, it is she who gets the sting when Blake calls her a \"poor sport\". With a start like that you can well see romance in their future. Bad news for the show's leading lady Mona Merrick played by Alice Faye. She's carrying the torch for Gary and is more than able to fight for what she wants.\n\nThe love story between the songwriter and the upper crust girl somewhat mirrors the love story of Irving Berlin and Ellen Mackay, the Comstock Lode heiress. Disinherited from her father's will, Ellen and Irving shared a 62 year marriage, 3 daughters, 1 son and a little something referred to as \"royalties\". Take that, daddy-dear!\n\nMadeleine Carroll\n\nIn the hands of the wrong actress or director the Mimi character could come off as just another spoiled rich girl raging against the world. Fortunately, Roy Del Ruth's experience and taste combined with comedic chops dating back to days with Sennett and such gems as The Broadway Melody of 1936, Topper Returns and Beauty and the Boss, keep the thin plot light and breezy. Madeleine Carroll's extraordinary beauty immediately wins her audience favour, but it is also the light of intelligence and kindness in her eyes and her gracious way of speaking that keeps us on her side. Madeleine plays the comedy with charming nuance. Mimi can be stubborn and petulant, but she can also be playful and loyal.\n\nCora Witherspoon\n\nThe supporting cast in On the Avenue is a real treat featuring Walter Catlett, Joan Davis, Douglas Fowley, Sig Ruman, Stepin Fetchit and Bess Flowers. Yes, that's right, our Bess plays Mimi's maid and has about a half dozen lines! Playing, seemingly, the only Caraway with a sense of humour is Cora Witherspoon as Aunt Fritz. She's one of those eccentric moneyed women with a mania for fads and Miss Witherspoon (The Bank Dick, Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise) looks like she is having as much fun as I have watching her.\n\nIrving Berlin composed six tunes for On the Avenue and most of them are presented in the context of the Broadway Revue or show within the show. Those numbers were performed on the stage as if we were in the audience of a theatre and filmed in one take.\n\nThe opening number He Ain't Got Rhythm is performed at first by Alice Faye and a bevy of Fox beauties including Marjorie Weaver and Lynn Bari then The Ritz Brothers take over. Al, Harry and Jimmy (Harry is the one in the middle) give it their all with their eccentric and perfectly synchronized dancing in a memorable number.\n\nThe Girl on the Police Gazette features Dick Powell and company in Gay 90s garb pining over the picture of a lovely in tights through a revolving stage set that moves from a barber shop to a trolley car to Coney Island to a flower shop to a backstage rendezvous.\n\nMimi and Gary spend a date that takes them from nightclub to diner and a tour around the park in a Hansom cab. Billy Gilbert runs the diner and E.E. Clive drives the cab. Moonlight and a park bend is a perfect song cue and Berlin's perfect song for the spot is You're Laughing at Me. Ah, love!\n\nLater at the theatre we are treated to the lovelorn Mona singing what will become a Berlin standard, This Year's Kisses, to a disinterested Gary Blake. He is only thinking about how he can soften the popular sketch to please Mimi. Mona knows just what to do with the sketch! The next production number we enjoy on stage is a song that has become as tied to the year-end holiday as Irving's White Christmas. Dick Powell and Alice Faye introduce I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.\n\nA taste of Madeleine as Mimi, plus the exuberant Slumming on Park Avenue.\n\nIrving then spoofs his own hit Puttin' on the Ritz with the lively Slumming on Park Avenue. Alice Faye and some talented Fox dancers give us the number relatively straight and then The Ritz Brothers take over with Harry dressed like Mona/Alice and Al and Jimmy dancing barefoot!\n\nIn its 90 minutes, On the Avenue gives us fabulous music performed by a cast of troupers, that glorious 20th Century Fox black and white sheen courtesy of cinematographer Lucien Andriot, eye-popping costumes from Gwen Wakeling, a who's who of character actors, and romance unencumbered by angst. A treat on every level.\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for March on TCM\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court of Canada over-turned a 22 year ban on physician assisted suicide for patients with grievous and irremediable medical conditions. The unanimous decision gives provincial legislatures a year to enact new laws. According to recent polls, 85% of Canadians agree with the \"dying with dignity\" position and we can expect much emotional debate on the subject in the coming months. The 1948 film An Act of Murder is an early film which tackles the subject of euthanasia and is well worth watching for its ideas and performances.\n\nJudge Calvin Cooke\n\nFredric March stars as Judge Calvin Cooke, at work a stern magistrate whose view is entirely black and white. He holds no room for the grey area of human frailty and emotions in terms of meting our justice. At home Calvin Cooke is a devoted family man, adoring of his wife of 20 years and their daughter. Florence Eldridge plays the patiently loving Catherine Cooke. Geraldine Brooks is Ellie Cooke, a young law student romantically involved with David Douglas played by Edmond O'Brien. Douglas is devoted to his clients and a strong believer in humanizing the courts. Judge Cooke sees the younger man as a firebrand and does not take kindly to his interest in Ellie. Soon, Calvin's mind will have other, more pressing worries.\n\nStanley Ridges plays close family friend Dr. Walter Morrison. Catherine confides in this former beau that she has been suffering from headaches and blurred vision and quietly requests a check-up. Catherine has an inoperable brain tumor and her friend, Walter, instead of revealing the news to her, shares the diagnosis with her husband. He explains the course of the disease and urges Calvin to keep the news from Catherine as there is nothing they can do for except relieve some of her pain. Perhaps, in some cases, this deception would be warranted despite the lie to the patient and the strain on the relatives. Personally, I feel each patient has the right to full disclosure and in Catherine's case, the intended kindness is in reality quite cruel.\n\nCatherine and Calvin\n\nMiss Eldridge is exquisite in the role of Catherine Cooke. Her affection for her family and the subtle ways she cares for them is charming in the early part of the story. Her fear for her health and confused relief after the check-up makes the viewer ache for her plight. Catherine's complete joy when Calvin reverses his plans to take her on a long-awaited second honeymoon is almost girlish. Her realization that her illness is not abating and the knowledge that attends it, raising doubts and fears and panic is heart-rending. Now Catherine is in on the lie and the support so desperately needed is denied her.\n\nCalvin is troubled as well as the extent of Catherine's suffering places in his mind the extreme possibility of ending her pain. Only in the thought of comforting his beloved wife would the judge deliberately move outside of the law by which he has lived. March makes the conflict live and breathe.\n\nI cannot speak to the original story The Mill of the Gods by Ernest Lothar, but it is from this point in the story that the screenplay by Michael Blankfort and Robert Theoren struggles to maintain its original integrity, although still dramatically intriguing and sincerely performed by the leading players. Judge Cooke is arrested for the murder of Catherine and is defended by David Douglas. During the courtroom sequence, the movie becomes more of a puzzle mystery in its attempt to find its way out of a thorny subject. It was brave of Universal at this time nearly 70 years ago to approach such a controversial matter, but bravery and box office concerns don't always go hand-in-hand. Director Michael Gordon does have a masterful way with dramatic material and actors. An Act of Murder is among his most watchable films including Another Part of the Forest (also with March and O'Brien), Cyrano de Bergerac, I Can Get It for You Wholesale and the 60s comedies Pillow Talk and Boys Night Out.\n\nTCM is screening An Act of Murder on Saturday, March 7th at 8:00 a.m.\n\n↧\n\nRussia in Classic Film blogathon: Maria Ouspenskaya\n\nMaria Ouspenskaya\n\nas featured in 1940s Beyond Tomorrow\n\nJuly 29, 1876 - December 3, 1949\n\nThe Russia in Classic Film Blogathon is being hosted by Fritzi of Movies, Silently and sponsored by The House of Mystery on DVD by Flicker Alley. This fascinating topic runs from March 8 - 10th.\n\nInternational movie audiences were introduced to Maria Ouspenskaya in her 60th year. Five feet, one and a half inches of imperious confidence with a broad, homely face wrinkled like the map of All the Russians from whence she came. Born in the ancient city of Tula on the Upa River, a noted fortress in the middle ages and armaments centre since the time of Peter the Great at the time of the Russo-Turkish War. Her childhood saw the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, great famine and the rise and fall of Nicholas II. Pogroms, war with Japan, Revolution and World War 1.\n\nMadam Ouspenskaya shares the common beginning of trained singer with many of our favourite character actresses such as Kathleen Howard, Esther Dale and Esther Howard. She combined her musical training at the Warsaw Conservatory with dramatic training in Moscow and became a touring stage actress. In 1922 the actress defected to America and began her career as an Broadway actress and a renowned acting teacher.\n\nSuccessive generations of performers believe themselves to be the last word on the art of acting, more \"naturalistic\" and accomplished than their predecessors. In this, acting teachers are extremely significant and Madam Ouspenskaya's own teacher was one of the most of influential, Konstantin Stanislavski. Stanislavski began molding his students to his own brand of self-reflection and discipline to achieve highly artistic and naturalistic results at the beginning of the 20th century. When his devoted pupil, Maria, relocated to NYC in 1929 she brought his method to an eager generation of students. Madam Ouspenskaya and actor/director Richard Boleslawski (Les Miserables, Three Godfathers) founded the American Laboratory Theatre. Among their lauded students we find Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg who would go on to develop their own schools. By the mid-20th century Stanislavski's method would morph into \"the\" method which impacts actors and audiences to this day.\n\nOriginally succumbing to the lure of Hollywood to secure funds for the school, Madam Ouspenskaya stayed to become a premier player in pictures. Her sometimes nearly impenetrable accent became an all-purpose tool for whatever foreigner was required for a picture.\n\nBaroness Von Obsersdorf\n\nwith Ruth Chatterton in Dodsworth\n\nHer debut picture Dodsworth secured for Madam Ouspenskaya an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category, the first year of its existence. The award was given to Gale Sondergaard for Anthony Adverse. The other nominees were Beulah Bondi for The Gorgeous Hussy, Alice Brady for My Man Godfrey and Bonita Granville for These Three. As Baroness Von Obersdorf played a protective aristocrat who very neatly removes from her charming, yet foolish son's life the desperate social climber Fran Dodsworth.\n\nGrandmother\n\nLove Affair\n\nMadam Ouspenskaya would again be nominated for Best Supporting Actress for the 1939 release Love Affair starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. As Boyer's french grandmother, she is a charming elderly lady living with her memories of the past and her hopes for the future of her playboy grandson. She is charming. The winner of the award was Hattie McDaniel for Gone With the Wind. The other nominees were Olivia de Havilland for Gone With the Wind, Geraldine Fitzgerald for Wuthering Heights and Edna May Oliver for Drums Along the Mohawk.\n\nMaharani\n\nwith C. Montague Shaw in The Rains Came\n\nSwitching continents for another 1939 release, Madam Ouspenskaya played the Maharani in The Rains Came, based on a Louis Bromfield novel. The Maharani is a tough-as-nails, focused character with an almost godlike understanding of people. She rules with passionate practicality.\n\nMadam Tanya\n\nwith Harry Carey and C. Aubrey Smith in Beyond Tomorrow\n\nIn the charmingly sentimental 1940 release Beyond Tomorrow, Maria Ouspenskaya was cast as (gasp!) a Russian lady. Obviously of noble birth and character, she fulfills the role of housekeeper to the three wealthy bachelors at the centre of the story. Her character is compassionate, probably psychic, and essential to the family-like atmosphere of the living arrangement of the characters.\n\nMaleva\n\nwith Lon Chaney Jr. in The Wolf Man\n\n\"Wolf? Gypsy woman? Murder? What is this?\"\n\n- Ralph Bellamy as Col. Paul Montford, The Wolf Man\n\nIn 1941 Madame Ouspenskaya played the role with which many of us associate her in a most affectionate way. Maleva, the old gypsy woman in The Wolf Man is enduring classic movie image, even for those who don't watch horror movies. Maleva has the wisdom of the ages and the compassion to see through pain. Larry Talbot knows he is a werewolf because Maleva speaks the truth. Dr. Lloyd may try to see the problem as psychological and Sir John may try to bully it away, but Maleva speaks the truth.\n\n\"The way you walked was thorny though no fault of your own, but as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end. Now you will have peace for eternity.\"\n\nMaria Ouspenskaya was a devote follower of astrology and relied upon the famed Astrologer to the Stars, Carroll Righter in basing many of her decisions. Her adherence to the stars could be frustrating to producers and directors, but it would have to be tolerated if they wanted Ouspenskaya in their picture.\n\nLet's have a look at what astrology has to tell us about Madame Ouspenskaya. As a Leo she demanded and commanded attention. Her chart indicated a predominance of Water signs which made her highly emotional and vulnerable. Yet Fire was also dominant and provided much self-confidence and enthusiasm. Always she would move forward toward her goals. A lack of Air influences curtailed her ability to be flexible in her communications. The admirable strength to persevere through trials, yet the introspection that would often keep people at bay. A certain nobility of nature that could be construed as pride. Perhaps a tendency toward over intellectualizing. Basically kind-hearted, she may have found it difficult keeping people close. Magnetic, mysterious and powerful Maria Ouspenskaya.\n\nIn 25 motion picture credits this lauded actress gave us living and intriguing characters. Be they hard-core dancing masters, benevolent and beloved grandmothers, political leaders, political exiles, nobility or outcast, the women created by the art of Stanislavski's most ardent student and disciple will stand the critical test of time.\n\n↧\n\nThe Cinemascope blogathon: Gunman's Walk (1958)\n\nBecky and Rich, the astute duo behind Classic Becky's Brain Food and Wide Screen World are hosting The Cinemascope Blogathon from March 13 to 15. Revel in the variety of movies that entertain to this day.\n\nThe wide-screen process came of age in the 1950s as a competitive draw to what audiences could find on their tiny television screens. It came of age in a period when the so-called adult western was at its height and many westerns benefited with the breathtaking scenic backgrounds of their stories. Such westerns as Broken Lance, River of No Return, The Last Wagon and The Professionals told their stories of perilous landscapes and desperation through the breathtaking marvel of widescreen. A strong influence on the 1950s westerns was film-noir and although director Phil Karlson may be better known for his crime pictures that fall under the noir purview, his half dozen or so westerns also feature tough-minded characters caught in the whirlwind of destiny. 1958s Gunman's Walk may well be Karlson's masterpiece in the genre.\n\nFrank Nugent wrote the screenplay based on a story by Ric Hardman. Nugent was Oscar nominated for The Quiet Man and his previous westerns include The Searchers and Fort Apache, and the Karlson directed feature They Rode West.\n\nVan Heflin (Johnny Eager, Shane, Airport) stars as Lee Hackett, a powerful rancher who raised two sons in his own image, that of the law unto himself. The passage of time is a theme in many westerns of this period and time weighs heavy on Lee Hackett. He strives to be one of the boys by insisting his sons refer to him by his first name. The longtime ranch foreman jokes about Lee's need to keep ahead of the boys when it is getting harder to keep up with them.\n\nBoth of Lee's sons are troubled. Davy, the younger played by James Darren (The Guns of Navarone, Gidget, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) is finding his way in life more in step with times. Davy's attitude toward the Natives from whom Lee wrestled his land is the opposite of his father's casual racism. Davy is attracted to Cecily Chouard, who is part French and part Sioux. Davy refuses to wear a gun. He is more thoughtful than his father and brother appear to be. Cecily or \"Clee\" is a empathetic and strong young woman as played by Kathryn Grant (Anatomy of a Murder, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad) in one of five pictures she made with Phil Karlson. Ms. Grant and James Darren can also be seen to good advantage as a couple in the previous year's Karlson noir, The Brothers Rico.\n\nEd Hackett is played by Tab Hunter (Damn Yankees!, Battle Cry, Track of the Cat) and it is an excellent performance of a narcissist psychopath. Seeking to emulate his father in toughness, the changing times have given Ed little in the way of opportunity to prove himself and to best the older man. Ed is ruthless in his dealings with underlings and toward Natives, yet often tender toward his brother. His need to prove himself through destruction and violence has made Ed a fast draw when that skill is no longer admired.\n\nOut on the range during a round up of wild horses the vastness of the physical background gives us a sense of what Lee Hackett has tamed for his own and the freedom of the characters. Freedom, that in Ed's case, leads to the wanton murder of Cecily's brother witnessed only by two other Sioux working the roundup. Once the company reaches town or civilization the Hackett family is faced with how their actions are viewed in the new reality. The physical constraints of sidewalks and bylaws and society that actually provide freedom to many, cages Ed in and ties him in knots.\n\nThe script plays with many levels of the events, the family dynamics, the changing times, the crime and the romance. Robert F. Simon (TVs Bewitched) represents the law. A contemporary of Lee's, he knows the past, but he also accepts the present. Lee feels entitled to bully the Court, but finds the hated Sioux accorded rights as well. The Hackett pride, and fear for Ed, is ripe for the fleecing by a lying horse trader played by Ray Teal (TVs Bonanza). Constrained by society, Ed Hackett looks for ways to explode. Mickey Shaughnessy (Designing Woman) is a deputy assigned to keep an eye on Ed. The character sees all and understands much. Davy learns to stand apart from the Hackett name. Lee Hackett ignores his own doubts about his parenting and the nature of his sons. Eventually, thoughtlessness and violence lead to a devastating conclusion where compassion may finally have a chance to grow.\n\nGunman's Walk has riveting performances and an interesting story. The Arizona filming location combined with the impressive effects of Cinemascope give to the movie a physical sense of the character's inner turmoil. And George Duning's whistled theme will stay with you for days.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Luck of the Irish Blog O'Thon: George Brent stars in Out of the Blue (1947)\n\nGeorge Brent as Arthur Earthleigh\n\nOliver Jensen: \"Arthur Earthleigh. It isn't even a name, it's a lisp.\"\n\nThose darlin' girls of Silver Scenes are hosting a wee bit of a St. Paddy's Day celebration with The Luck of the Irish Blog O' Thon running from March 15 to 17.\n\nI feel a connection to folks who share the family name of Nolan that extends to the likes of Jeanette and Kathleen and Lloyd and Bob and George. George? Yes, George. The charmingly handsome lad with the winning smile and over 100 movie and television credits under the name of George Brent was actually born George Brendan Nolan in Shannonbridge, Ireland in 1899. Orphaned at age 11, caught up in \"the Troubles\" and an alumni of the Abbey Theatre, George Brent made his mark in Hollywood as leading man to the greatest leading ladies of Hollywood's greatest era, Barbara Stanwyck (5 pictures), Bette Davis (11 pictures), wife Ruth Chatterton (4 pictures), Merle Oberon (2 pictures), Claudette Colbert (2 pictures), Myrna Loy (2 pictures) and one movie with wife Ann Sheridan. Among \"cousin\" George's best pictures are 42nd Street, Baby Face, The Rains Came, 'Til We Meet Again (a lovely remake of One Way Passage), The Spiral Staircase and Tomorrow is Forever.\n\nHow do you prefer your George Brent? In a moving melodrama, a tidy B crime picture, an historical romance, a pre-code shocker, a comedy? I like it when George gets to exercise his comedy chops as in Snowed Under. Of course, he had a lovely, sly way of inserting a bit of wit into all the appropriate roles, but rarely was he given the chance to to be a flat out goof. 1947s Out of the Blue provides George Brent with an opportunity to display all of his Irish humour; the sarcasm, the love of the absurd and the offhand way of treating the outlandish as commonplace.\n\nJulia Dean, George Brent, Elizabeth Patterson, Richard Lane, Carole Landis\n\nThe story by Laura author Vera Caspary concerns a group of Greenwich Village apartment neighbours, bedeviled by the heat and frightened by the news of a serial killer at large. A put-upon husband steps out on his nagging wife and finds himself with a body to hide and the prime suspect in a murder. Prime noir territory, wouldn't you say? This story, however, is played for laughs and the director, Leigh Jason, was noted for such comedy-mystery stories as exemplified by The Mad Miss Manton (Barbara Stanwyck, Henry Fonda), Wise Girl (Miriam Hopkins, Ray Milland) and Dangerous Blondes (Evelyn Keyes, Allyn Joslyn).\n\nGeorge Brent, Carole Landis\n\nNothing that happens in the apartment complex goes unnoticed by a couple of maiden ladies played by Elizabeth Patterson (Intruder in the Dust) and Julia Dean (The Curse of the Cat People). From the vantage point of their terrace they can focus all their attention on the goings on on the terraces of the 10th floor. One is occupied by a Bohemian playboy artist David Gelleo played by Turhan Bey (Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves) and his prize-winning German Shepherd, Rabelais played by Flame. His next door neighbours are Arthur and Mae Earthleigh. The hapless Arthur is completely under the thumb of the domineering Mae. Heartthrob George Brent plays Arthur and glamourous Carole Landis (I Wake Up Screaming) is the unpleasant spouse.\n\nTwo more of Hollywood's glamourous leading ladies are thrown into the mix when debutant Deborah Tyler played by Virginia Mayo (White Heat) proposes to our artist friend that his Rabelais would be a perfect match for her own prize-winning Shepherd. Her proposition gives David other ideas, more human in nature. David is not the only one with romance on his mind. Mae Earthleigh is out of town for the weekend and Arthur is on the loose and ready to howl. At a local tavern he meets professional interior decorator and amateur souse Olive Jensen played by Ann Dvorak (Three on a Match). Arthur flirts with Olive. Arthur is not very good at flirting, but Olive thinks he's cute and happily returns to his abode where disapproving pictures of Mae squelch any starry-eyed notions.\n\nAnn Dvorak, George Brent\n\nThe sorts of mishaps that only happen in screwball comedies start happening to Arthur Earthleigh. He thinks he has gotten rid of Olive, but she is passed out in the guest room. Olive had told Arthur about her bad ticker and her propensity for \"popping off\", but Arthur does not realize the truth of her statement. An unconscious Olive appears to Arthur to be a dead Olive. He places the body on David's terrace, more in fear of Mae than of any official condemnation. Arthur's action compounds an ongoing feud with David over Rabelais. In the midst of his burgeoning romance with Deborah, David uses Olive in a scheme to get even with Arthur. Olive is quite amenable to David's plans, after all, she gave Arthur the best years of her life!\n\nBy now you have the idea that our leading actors are playing characters well removed from their usual fare and carrying it off beautifully. Turhan Bey a sophisticate, Carole Landis a nag and Virginia Mayo the woman with class. Mayo, who played her fair share of molls and dames is absolutely adorable in a scene where her dainty deb pretends to be a crook. George Brent is a riot as a man buffeted by fate. He takes one step forward in ill-conceived shenanigans and always winds up two steps back. Ann Dvorak takes the comedy crown as Olive Jenson. Olive has no impulse control whatsoever and her stream-of-consciousness ramblings are the highlight of a very funny screenplay.\n\nAn early release from Eagle-Lion, this comedy has a lot going for it, but has yet to achieve the acclaim that is attached to some of the studio's film-noir of that era like T-Men or Raw Deal. To my comic ear the screenplay is that good that at one of the major studios with bigger names Out of the Blue might be looked upon as one of screwball comedies last great hurrahs. As it stands now, it is a gem awaiting discovery, especially for the delightful Dvorak and goofy cousin George.\n\n↧\n\nThe Favourite TV Show Episode blogathon: Ironside - One Hour to Kill (1970)\n\nTerence Towles Canote at A Shroud of Thought is hosting The Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon, a brilliant idea whose contributions can be found here from March 27th to the 29th.\n\nThe television series based on Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason character was an outstanding success on CBS from its debut in 1957 to The Case of the Final Fade-Out in May of 1966. Star Raymond Burr was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards for Leading Actor in a Series, and won the trophy in 1959. When an actor is so successful and so identified with such a popular character, it staggers the imagination that lightning could strike with another prominent series or character, but strike it did - and in amazingly quick order.\n\nRaymond Burr played the title character of Ironside in the pilot TV movie which aired in March of 1967. Collier Young (Act of Violence, The Hitch-Hiker) created the series and the teleplay written by Don Mankiewicz (I Want to Live!, Trial ) was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Drama. Raymond Burr was nominated for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama for World Premiere, and Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series. Ironside began its regular series run in September of 1967 and ran for eight seasons.\n\nThe pilot introduced us to San Francisco Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside, a tough-minded cop and media darling who is put in a wheelchair by a sniper. All too used to getting his own way, the \"Chief\" refuses to be put out to pasture, but finagles a position through the Police Commissioner Dennis Randall played by Gene Lyons. The Chief is now a consultant to the SFPD, with housing/offices in an unused floor of the headquarters building and a staff to help him investigate his own shooting.\n\nDet. Sgt. Ed Brown played by Don Galloway is an ex-Serviceman and a protegee of Ironside's. (I see him as the Archie Goodwin to Burr's Nero Wolfe.) Episodes with an emphasis on the character of Ed Brown worth checking out are Nightmare Trip (Season 6), The Wrong Time, the Wrong Place (Season 3) and Five Days in the Death of Sgt. Brown (Season 6 with a crossover the the series The Bold Ones). Second on the Chief's staff is Officer Eve Whitfield played by Barbara Anderson who would win one Primetime Emmy out of three nominations for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Drama. Eve is a young women with a wealthy background whose journey to a policing career is chronicled in the episode Reprise (Season 2). All in a Day's Work is an excellent episode written by Ed McBain which chronicles the aftermath of Eve having to shoot a fleeing suspect.\n\nRounding out the Chief's team is Mark Sanger played by Don Mitchell. Mark is a young black man who has had his troubles with the law and attempted to rob Ironside. Seeing potential, and hating to be proved wrong, Ironside offers Mark a job as his driver/caregiver. Mark sees the position as demeaning, but the Chief has a way of getting to people. Eventually Mark attends law school at night and becomes a police officer. The episode Down Two Roads (Season 6) shows us why Mark makes this career change. An offbeat episode featuring Mark is Beware the Wiles of the Stranger (Season 3). By the time of the 1993 TV Movie The Return of Ironside, Mark is Judge Sanger.\n\nThroughout the series we would be reminded of the challenges faced by the Chief; the annoyances of inaccessible buildings, the reliance on Mark and others. Sometimes comments based on pity or derision, or even empathy. None of this, however, overrode the strength and competency of the character. As viewers tuned in week after week, the wheelchair was accepted and put in its place. The chair was not the man.\n\nOne Hour to Kill (Season 3) was written by Sandy Stern and directed by Richard Benedict. It is a Thursday evening in San Francisco (coincidentally, the very night Ironside aired on NBC). Mark Sanger is rushing to make his law class after making sure he is not needed by the Chief. A measure of his level of independence, the Chief has the night all laid out - a nice whirlpool bath, some of his famous chili and the 49ers game on the TV. Commissioner Randall stops by with the offer of his extra ticket to a highly touted boxing match. For a moment, the Chief is tempted, but prefers a quiet night at home. The extra ticket will go to Randall's chauffeur.\n\nNot exactly the evening as planned.\n\nRaymond Burr as Ironside\n\nUnexpectedly, an alarm clock goes off next to the telephone which rings. The voice on the line informs the Chief that he has one hour to live then disconnects. People, even trained observers, see what they expect to see most of the time. The out of place clock and the threatening phone call alert the Chief to the unexpected who begins to notice other subtle changes to his home. Retrieving a gun from a drawer, he finds it empty. A box of shells is filled with bolts. Anything that could be used as a weapon has been removed including fencing foils which adorned a wall, pool cues and butcher knives. The phone is only operable by the mysterious caller. The building is deserted and anyone who has ever worked late hours in an office building knows there is nothing more unsettling than familiar surroundings devoid of their humanity. A game of cat and mouse follows, but just who is the cat and who is the mouse?\n\nEd wants to ditch the tie. Eve's feet are killing her.\n\nDon Galloway and Barbara Anderson\n\nEd is filling in for Eve's ill date at a concert. They sit in a box, looking like an elegant young couple enjoying an opera. Actually, they are having difficulty following the plot, Eve's feet are killing her and Ed would like nothing better than to dump the tie and get a pizza and join the Chief watching the game. Eve is all for it if they can add rum crunch ice cream to the menu. Before the viewer can sigh a relief of \"rescue!\", they decide to wait until intermission and call ahead before leaving the theatre.\n\nAlerted to danger, the Chief is not the worried rat in a trap that his tormentor hopes. Fashioning booby traps out of what is available to him including electricity and aerosol cans, the Chief also fashions a signal to the outside using a lamp and rotating fan. He continues to be pro-active by attempting to reach the elevator phone, which has also been sabotaged. In more warning calls, the Chief gleans clues as to the perpetrator's identity. Ironside is meant to suffer the fear and agony that someone else has experienced. With time running out, Ironside searches his files for knowledge with which to confront his attacker. Ironside is chair bound, but most definitely not helpless.\n\nA pensive Mark.\n\nDon Mitchell\n\nThe professor leading Mark's class is played by Henry Corden (The Black Castle, TVs The Flintstones) and he is interrupted by an intruder who fires a gun and rushes from the classroom. It is part of the lesson plan. How accurate are eye witnesses? What do they see? What do they imagine they see? How are they influenced by others? As the class continues Mark experiences flashbacks to the scene of the garage as he left for school. Something was off. Something about the phone box. What was it? Abruptly, Mark rushes from the class to get to the Chief.\n\nMeanwhile, Ed has been having no luck getting through to the Chief and contacts the phone company who send a repairman to the site. Eve and Ed ditch the concert hall for the pizzeria and continue attempting to contact Ironside becoming increasingly more uneasy.\n\nRevenge or absolution?\n\nGuest star Robert Lipton as Jimmy Chard\n\nIronside is face to face with the man who threatens his life. Guest star Robert Lipton (Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here, TVs As the World Turns) plays Jimmy Chard, whose younger brother was convicted and executed for a robbery and killing of a police officer. He had been arrested by Chief Ironside. Chard presents himself as an avenging angel, but the Chief cuts through that pretense with the truth that it was Jimmy who planned the crime and backed out leaving his brother to take the fall. It is Jimmy's guilt and various documented mental issues that have led to this attempted murder of the Chief, nothing more.\n\nSomewhere there is a pizza with their names on it.\n\nThe Chief's psychological and physical traps pay off in a scene as tense and exciting as all that has gone before and only after having disabled his tormentor does rescue arrive in the form of his three colleagues. The obligatory light-hearted tag releases the knot in the viewer's stomach as our favourite Thursday night crime fighters adjourn for pizza and rum crunch ice cream. What adventure will find the Chief and the gang next week - a murder mystery, international espionage, something on the lighter side? I can't wait!\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for April on TCM\n\nAll the resources of the great Warner Brothers studio came together to give us a ripping good melodrama in 1940s They Drive by Night. Jerry Wald (The Roaring Twenties) and Richard Macaulay (Born to Kill) based their script on a novel by A.I. Bezzerides (On Dangerous Ground, Thieves' Highway) with a dash from the screenplay for the 1935 Warner's feature Bordertown thrown in for good measure. This look at the movie will discuss a possible spoiler in the well-known, star making turn for a new Warners leading lady.\n\nDirector Raoul Walsh was an incredibly busy and prolific filmmaker, particular in this period of his career. His energetic style meshed perfectly with the studio for which he provided much of their classic product, including The Roaring Twenties, High Sierra, The Strawberry Blonde, They Died With Their Boots On, Gentleman Jim, Objective, Burma!, etc. The moody cinematography on the picture is by 3-time Oscar nominee Arthur Edelson, a frequent Walsh collaborator (The Thief of Bagdad, The Big Trail, The Cock-Eyed World).\n\nThey Drive by Night was the last great role for George Raft. The former dancer splashed into the ranks of a \"name\" with the role of the gangster Rinaldo in 1932s Scarface which led to a brace of similar tough characters. Raft's best work can be seen in Each Dawn I Die, Souls at Sea and They Drive by Night.\n\nHumphrey Bogart, George Raft\n\nRaft plays Joe Fabrini, an ambitious wildcat trucker. Along with his brother Paul played by Humphrey Bogart, they eke out a precarious existence. Paul is beholden to his brother, but longs for a more quiet and stable life with his wife Pearl played by Gale Page. Bad luck seems to dog the Fabrini Brothers. Crooked financiers and bosses are as much in the way of their success as bad weather, faulty equipment and sleep deprivation. John Litel, Frank Faylen and Eddie Acuff are among the actors portraying fellow truckers on the same road that seems to lead nowhere.\n\nGeorge Raft, Ann Sheridan, Humphrey Bogart\n\nRomance enters Joe's life in the form of Ann Sheridan as waitress Cassie Hartley. The hard-boiled quips comes fast and easy from this gal, but she has a heart of pure gold and soon that heart belongs to Joe Fabrini. When it looks like things are finally going their way, an accident results in the loss of Paul's right arm. The loyal Joe gets a job working for a large trucking concern run by old friend Ed Carlsen played by Alan Hale so he can help with Paul's recovery. Carlsen's company is a good fit for Joe. Ed and old friends like Irish McGurn played by Roscoe Karns respect Joe's ability and he is given the responsibility of traffic manager, contributing to the prosperity of the company.\n\nIda Lupino\n\nOnly one thing could mar Joe's position at Carlsen's, and that one thing is a woman. Ed's wife Lana is played by Ida Lupino in her first picture at Warner Brothers. At 22-years-old (!!) and acting since her teen years in England, Lupino was adept and versatile beyond her years and, therefore, hard for Hollywood to pigeonhole. She could be glamorous or dowdy, comic or dramatic and had just had a star making performance in William Wellman's The Light That Failed.\n\nLana was a frustrated and dangerous woman. Married to the older, boisterous Ed for eight years, she had pushed him to make something of himself so she could live a life of wealth. She constantly belittles Ed and his drinking, which he obliviously sees as her humour. Well, perhaps Ed wasn't quite so oblivious to Lana's contempt; perhaps that was why he drank. Lana spends money to excess and looks for romance outside of her marriage. Her fabulous wardrobe which tells us so much about her character courtesy of costumer Milo Anderson (Young Man with a Horn, Gentleman Jim). Lana had set her sights on Joe prior to his coming to work for Ed, but Joe spurned her advances because of his friendship to Ed and because he sensed something was not quite right about the woman. Joe's instincts were firing on all cylinders.\n\nOnce we leave the road, our story turns to the section cobbled from Bordertown and our spoiler section. The obsessive Lana, fed up with Ed and thwarted by Joe, kills her husband by trapping him behind electrically controlled garage doors in a still running automobile. Joe stays on as a partner to continue running the company not realizing that Lana has more in mind for their relationship. When Joe announces his engagement to Cassie, Lana goes to the District Attorney to confess the murder, but claiming she committed the crime at Joe's behest. In a classic courtroom scene, guilt overwhelms Lana who has a complete mental breakdown screaming about the doors making her kill Ed. It must be seen. I think she leaves Bette Davis (Bordertown) in the dust. Warner Brothers was not yet done with Bordertown. Check out TVs Cheyenne, Season 1, Episode 8, The Storm Riders for another version of the dissatisfied wife with an agenda.\n\nOne star, Raft, reaches his peak. Another, Lupino, stakes her claim. Bogart's next picture would be High Sierra and he would be cemented as one of Hollywood's great leading men. Here they are together at the crossroads in They Drive by Night where audiences can enjoy the best of the studio system in a hugely entertaining film.\n\nTCM is screening They Drive by Night on Monday, April 20th at 10:00 pm., part of an evening they are calling \"Hitching a Ride\".\n\n↧\n\nThe Pre-Code blogathon: The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932)\n\nThey had themselves quite a time in Hollywood before the rigid enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code in 1934. Join Karen of Shadows and Satin and Danny of Pre-code.com as they host the 2015 Pre-Code Blogathon.\n\nWhere would pulp/crime fiction of the 20th century be without Chinatown? The enclave of Asian immigrants in port cities filled the niche of the exotic and the inscrutable in the imaginations of the public. Every fictional PI and B movie crime solver had to have at least one adventure in a \"Chinatown\". Among the ordinary citizens trying to get by in a new land you would find, as you would with any group of people, a criminal class. It was this criminal class that was the subject of freelance journalist Sax Rohmer's investigation in 1911. He wasn't interested in any random crook. Rohmer was certain readers would want to know about the top kick, the head man. As any Costa Nostra Don would let you know, an enterprise like crime works better if it is organized. It would take a special power to be the boss in Chinatown. Rohmer did not have luck in obtaining an interview with the purported head of the Chinese underworld of Limehouse, but that didn't matter. Rohmer had his imagination and his imagination conceived of the world's first super-villain. Fu Manchu, the holder of multiple doctorates, a man of incalculable wealth, personal magnetism and power, with a touch of megalomania. Why have all this power if you can't rule the world? The serialized stories and novels featuring the outlandish villain and his pursuer Sir Nayland Smith of British Intelligence brought Rohmer fortune and fame.\n\nHistorians and socialists can expound more fully on Dr. Fu Manchu's place in the perpetuation of racial stereotypes. Observation and experience prove that there are those who take their fiction too seriously. On the other hand, there are just as many people who know how to enjoy the respite and diversion of fiction and lay it aside. We go to Chinatown in search of bargains and restaurants with nary a thought that an over-dressed egomaniac is lurking behind a beaded curtain. It is in that spirit that I look at MGM's Grand Guignol pre-code opus The Mask of Fu Manchu.\n\nMad scientist at work.\n\nKarloff as Fu Manchu\n\nKarloff fan that I am, I had not seen The Mask of Fu Manchu until a few years ago when it was screened by TCM in an early morning time slot. Making the assumption that the film would creak like an old door hinge I planned on setting about with the morning tea and toast, and getting in a bit of a.m. puttering without missing much of the plot. I was wrong! The Mask of Fu Manchu is a template for pacing that should be studied by all makers of thrillers.\n\nThe most problematic aspect of the screenplay is the racial invectives that pass between and about the characters in the play. They are many and heartily delivered; \"yellow beast\", \"fiend\", \"accursed white race\", \"sterile Christian paradise\", etc. They are shocking and harsh things to hear, but the setting is so preposterous and over-the-top that it is impossible to take them seriously. Only in the days prior to rigid \"code\" enforcement would this sort of language and the sexually charged torture sequences and relationships pass the censor.\n\nWe start off at Whitehall where Sir Nayland Smith (Lewis Stone) informs Sir Lionel Barton (Lawrence Grant) that his archeological expedition to the Gobi Desert to retrieve artifacts of Genghis Khan is of major importance to the the British Government. The infamous Dr. Fu Manchu has his eyes on the treasure as a means of securing success for his current plan to rouse the East against the West for world domination. \"Right ho\", or words to that effect, says Sir Lionel.\n\nThe British Museum has lost its charm.\n\nBam! We're in the British Museum where, before he can reach his colleagues, Sir Lionel is waylaid by three thugs and spirited away. The thugs are disguised as mummies and hiding in sarcophagus and they seem a part of the scenery until they come to life. You gotta admit, this Fu Manchu guy has style, but he must share the credit with director Charles Brabin.\n\nWhat have we here?!\n\nDavid Torrence, Charles Starrett, Karen Morley, Jean Hersholt\n\nBam! A week later we are in Nayland Smith's office where Sir Lionel's daughter (Karen Morley) announces her intention to join the expedition dragging her fiance Terry (Charles Starrett) with her. Bam! We view a silhouette of a caravan. Bam! We're at the end of the dig. Bam! Incredible solid gold tomb of Genghis Khan is opened and the long sought mask and scimitar are recovered. A few of the native people get religion and are booted about.\n\nIf ever a fellow enjoyed his work, that fellow is super-villain Fu Manchu.\n\nBoris Karloff\n\nBam! We are at the opulent headquarters of Dr. Fu Manchu who is suavely entertaining his guest, Sir Lionel. Sir Lionel, stubborn cuss that he is, will not be swayed to reveal the location of the tomb - not for money and not even for Fu Manchu's daughter (\"yes, even that\"). Well, there's nothing for it but torture. Sir Lionel is bound beneath a booming bell, denied sleep, food and water. Fu Manchu: \"You can't move. You can't sleep. You will be frantic with thirst. You will be unspeakably foul. But here you will lie, day after day, until you tell.\" This cat knows his business!\n\nBoris Karloff plays a a self-satisfied villain who truly enjoys his vocation. His endearing lisp brings a subtle touch of the farcical to the grandiose pronouncements of Dr. Fu Manchu and Karloff wears the silks and headdresses with uncommon ease.\n\nDr. Von Berg and Nayland Smith formulate a plan.\n\nAre reservations at Grand Hotel included?\n\nJean Hersholt and Lewis Stone\n\nBam! We're in a safe house somewhere close to Fu Manchu's location. The expedition has arrived and his greeted by Sir Nayland. Our middle-aged secret agent is everywhere! However, the spies and minions of Fu Manchu are everywhere as well. The scimitar is locked in a tower room with Dr. McLeod (David Torrance) who is promptly dispatched by Fu Manchu's gang. Bam! The next day a hand (Sir Lionel's hand!) is thrown into the yard. The gruesome sight prompts Terry, at Sheila's urging, to take the scimitar and bargain for her father's release. She figures Nayland can get it back later.\n\nDo you like my hat?\n\nMyrna Loy as Fah Lo See, the daughter of Dr. Fu Manchu\n\nBam! Terry is taken to Dr. Fu Manchu, the scimitar is proven to be a fake replace by the ever-busy Smith, and Terry is left to the tender mercies of Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy). It is a few years before the handsome Starrett will make his mark as a B cowboy star as the Durango Kid, but here he paves the way for the TV cowboys of the 50s (Clint Walker, Robert Horton, etc.) who spent a lot of camera time being beaten with their shirts off. Such scenes do not give me the intense pleasure they seem to inspire in Fah Lo See, but I'm not complaining.\n\nBam! The delivery of a corpse lets our group know that it is time to give up on poor old Sir Lionel. Nayland Smith sets out to retrieve Terry by finagling his way into an opium den, then a tavern of sorts where he follows a man through a secret entrance to the lair of Dr. Fu Manchu and is captured. Terry is drugged to do Fu Manchu's bidding and is released to lure Sheila and the verbose Dr. Van Berg (Jean Hersholt) to the evil genius.\n\nAs we come to the final moments of the movie:\n\n- Nayland Smith is tied to a beam balanced above and timed to release him into an alligator pit.\n\n- Dr. Von Berg is about to be juliened by the world's largest veg-o-matic.\n\n- Terry about to become the drugged sex slave of Fah Lo See.\n\n- Sheila, gowned in virginal white is to be, as declaimed by Fu Manchu himself to his excited followers, \"sacrified to our god\". After all, there hasn't been a god going that won't bless an enterprise that starts off with a good sacrifice.\n\nBam! In short order, our greying Bond escapes the reptiles, frees Terry and in consort they free, just in the nick of time, Dr. Von Berg. One of Dr. Fu Manchu's own creations, some sort of electrical shock gun that would have been useful in The Thing from Another World is used to eradicate the malevolent mastermind and his followers. Bam! The saviors of the white race consign the golden treasures of Genghis Khan to the deep as they sail back to civilization.\n\nFu Manchu, of course, lives on. Like Conan Doyle with Holmes, Rohmer tried to kill off his creation, but the public wouldn't allow it. The character appears to be indestructible in terms of recognition, shelf life and influence. Dozens of movies and TV programs have featured Fu Manchu. He has been intentionally spoofed by TVs Get Smart (Diplomat's Daughter) and Peter Sellers in The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu and, let's face it, Fu Manchu has the aura of a spoof in his organic state.\n\nThe character of Dr. Fu Manchu could be considered the grandfather of such villains as James Bond's Dr. No and Marvel Comics the Mandarin. As recently as 2010, the BBC series Sherlock episode The Blind Banker continued the tradition of a hero dealing with an omniscient Chinese criminal organization and in 2013s Iron Man 3, the Mandarin makes an appearance. Beware! There's no telling where the dastardly villain or his progeny will pop up next.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Great Villain Blogathon: Raymond Burr in \"Pitfall\" (1948)\n\nThe Great Villain Blogathon of 2015 runs from April 13th to 17th. It is hosted by the terrific trio of Kristina of Speakeasy, Karen of Shadows and Satin and Ruth of Silver Screenings. It is a do-not-miss internet event.\n\nWhat motivates our great villains? Greed? The lust for power? Love? Hate? Are they born bullies or were they once the bullied? Did they just get up on the wrong side of the bed? Villains - no matter where or how they are spawned - are all around us in fact and fiction. Sometimes their viciousness is on a global scale and sometimes it is up close and personal. In the case of J.B. MacDonald \"Mac\" as played by Raymond Burr in 1948s Pitfall, his wrongdoing is extremely personal. Mac's single-minded purpose will lead him to cross boundaries, callously invading the physical and emotional homes of his victims.\n\nRaymond Burr as J.B. \"Mac\" MacDonald\n\nAndre de Toth directed the film based on the novel The Pitfall by Jay Dratler. Among de Toth's dark-tinged dramas and westerns are None Shall Escape, Dark Waters, Ramrod, Man in the Saddle, Crime Wave and Day of the Outlaw. Dratler's noir credits include an Oscar nomination for the Laura screenplay, a Poe Award for Call Northside 777 and the screenplays for Impact and The Dark Corner. Pitfall's screenplay is by Karl Kamb (Whispering Smith) with uncredited William Bowers (Support Your Local Sheriff!) and Andre de Toth. Cinematographer Harry J. Wild was behind the look for such crime features as Murder, My Sweet, His Kind of Woman and The Big Steal.\n\nJane Wyatt, Dick Powell\n\nJohnny: \"Whatever happened to those two people who were going to build a boat and sail around the world?\"\n\nSue: \"Well, I had a baby. I never did hear what happened to you.\"\n\nWhen a fellow meets an attractive girl who shows an interest, it is really incumbent upon the fellow to let the girl know that he is married. It is no excuse that he's been having one of those days when life has been wearing him down with its sameness. If you start acting like you are single things are bound to get complicated. The complications will treble when that girl is also the object of another's affection and you are aware of the same.\n\nIn our movie the fellow is Johnny Forbes, an insurance agent with personal and professional obligations. Dick Powell plays Johnny who uses wry humour to barely disguise his bitterness. Sue, Johnny's wife, is played by Jane Wyatt. She is good-natured and pragmatic. She may sometimes feel the stifling effects of house-wifery, but she doesn't let it get her down. Jimmy Hunt plays their son Tommy, a freckled faced kid with the right mix of spunk and adoration for his dad.\n\nLizabeth Scott as Mona Stevens\n\nMona: \"I liked him mostly because he was nice to me. Very few men are. That means a lot.\"\n\nThe girl in the case is one Mona Stevens played by Lizabeth Scott. She's the sort of girl men make assumptions about, and they are way off base. A department store and photographers model, Mona's ex-boyfriend Bill Smiley played by Byron Barr is serving an embezzlement sentence. He foolishly stole money to buy Mona's affection. Johnny must repossess the gifts given to Mona as his company had bonded Smiley.\n\nDick Powell, Raymond Burr\n\nMac: \"I bet you never thought of me as a man who could fall in love.\"\n\nJohnny: \"You'd be surprised how little time I have to think about you at all, Mac.\"\n\nMona was tracked down for the insurance company by a freelance private eye and former cop named J.B. MacDonald. Johnny's secretary Maggie, played by Ann Doran, has a nickname for Mac, it is \"Gruesome\". The bulky Burr in this film looks slightly unkempt when we first meet him and he uses his size as a form of intimidation. Reporting on Mona to Johnny, Mac confesses that one look and he was hooked. Mona's impression of Mac is slightly different. As she tells Johnny, \"That was quite a bull you sent to see me yesterday. I've met some weird ones in my life, but that one nearly scared me to death.\"\n\nJohnny and Mona get acquainted on the open sea in her motorboat (a gift from Smiley) and in a darkened cocktail bar. They don't realize that all the time they are under the watchful eyes of MacDonald. The jealous Mac switches tactics from implied intimidation to brute force. Confronting Johnny outside his home Mac gives him a beating which lays Johnny up for a couple of weeks. By this time Mona discovers Johnny has a family and she breaks things off with no hard feelings. Johnny sheepishly apologizes.\n\nDick Powell\n\nJohnny: \"It's just a warning, Mac. If you're real smart you'll take it seriously. Leave the girl alone. Stay way from her. And if I ever hear that you've threatened to do anything about my family again I'll kill you, Mac. I mean that.\"\n\nFor Mona and Johnny the incident is closed. For Mac things are not that simple. He harasses Mona at work and follows her home at night. She tries to let him down easy then threatens him with the police. Mac, who feels he knows Mona better than she knows herself, plays the ace of threatening to hurt Johnny if she doesn't see things the MacDonald way. There is nowhere else to turn when Mona shares her troubles with Johnny. Johnny, a former boxer in college who had been taken by surprise by Mac earlier, returns the beating and, once again, walks away thinking the problem has been solved.\n\nRaymond Burr\n\nMac: \"I just don't like to see a guy getting a bad deal.\"\n\nNow Mac ups the ante in his battle for Mona and against Johnny. He has tried scare tactics and drubbings, but now it is time for manipulation. Mac visits Smiley in prison and plants seeds of doubt about Mona. He mentions Forbes and needles the nervous Smiley who has been sweating out his time. On the day of his release Mac offers solicitude and friendship to Smiley in the form of copious liquor and a gun, setting the crazed ex-con on the Forbes family. Spoiler ahead.\n\nLizabeth Scott, Raymond Burr\n\nMac: \"You haven't thought about it yet, but when you do you'll realize the only reason I did all this was because I - I really love you.\"\n\nBacked into a corner, Johnny has no choice but to defend his home and a shootout in the dark leaves Smiley dead. Mac later brags to Mona that he is a lucky gambler, but didn't expect such a strong payoff. He claims he expected Smiley and Johnny to frighten each other off, that he didn't expect actual gun play with murder. Mac also didn't expect the frustrated, angry and frightened Mona to shoot him. Villains, no matter how many arrows they have in their quiver, somehow never expect their victims to reach the point where they can't take it any more.\n\nPitfall ends - well, not really. Johnny comes clean about every nasty detail in the whole affair to his wife and the District Attorney and is spared criminal charges since Smiley was an intruder. Sue seriously considers divorce, but decides she is willing to work to salvage their marriage. Will Sue and Johnny be able to make it work? There is resignation in Sue's face along with the determination. Mona's fate is up in the air. If Mac dies, she will be charged with murder. Mac didn't know Mona as well as he thought. All this mayhem because a wrong guy fell for a right gal.\n\n↧\n\nRemake Alley: Goodbye Again (1933) and Honeymoon for Three (1941)\n\nMovie: Goodbye Again\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nSub-genre: screwball, romance, trains\n\nAllan Scott and George Haight's play Goodbye Again had a successful run of 216 performances in the Broadway season of 1931/32 starring Osgood Perkins. Ben Markson (Gold Diggers of 1933, What Price Hollywood?) wrote the screenplay for Warner Brothers film directed by Michael Curtiz. This screwball comedy gem from Curtiz shares its 1933 release date with the thriller classic Mystery of the Wax Museum, the outstanding Philo Vance mystery The Kennel Murder Case, and the feminist comedy-drama Female. I am ever-impressed by Curtiz's versatility and the quality of his work.\n\nJoan Blondell\n\nJoan Blondell is Ann Rogers, the attractive and efficient secretary to a successful author. Her relationship with her boss is more than business and we see just how much more as the story progresses. She's a cookie that is tough on the outside and all goo inside when it comes to the leading man, but she can only be pushed so far! We like Ann and if it is Bixby she wants, then we want him for her.\n\nWarren William\n\nWarren William stars as Kenneth Bixby the author of such best selling titles as A Saint in Scarlet, Ecstacy, The Woman Who Gave and Miriam. He's going to run into trouble with Miriam. The ladies love Kenneth Bixby. For one thing, he looks like Warren William. His lectures are sell-outs and bookstores can't keep copies on the shelves when Bixby shows up for autograph sessions.\n\nGenevieve Tobin\n\nGenevieve Tobin (No Time for Comedy) is the former Julie Clochessy, now Julie Wilson. She and Kenneth were at college together and shared a passion divine. Julie has never recovered from that first love. She feels unfaithful to Kenneth ever since she married Harvey Wilson of Cleveland, and she is convinced she inspired Miriam. Hugh Herbert plays Harvey. He's an understanding sort. Perhaps too understanding. Perhaps he is just tired of constantly being compared, and found lacking, to Kenneth Bixby.\n\nWhen Bixby's tour brings him to Cleveland, it brings Julie once more into his life. At first, he doesn't quite remember the woman (after all, he's Kenneth Bixby), but Julie very easily stirs the old embers and book signings and lectures and radio broadcasts go out the window. The couple spends the night in her country home. Ostensibly, Kenneth was to disabuse Julie of the notion of togetherness. Yeah, right!\n\nAnn is left wondering and worrying. She also has to deal with Arthur Westlake and Elizabeth Clochessy. Arthur, a lawyer, is engaged to Julie's younger sister and they are mightily concerned about Julie's strange and socially unacceptable behavior where it concerns Kenneth Bixby. It does not look proper. What is Ann going to do about it? Further, Ann must handle Harvey Wilson who shows up only wanting to take a look at the paragon that is Kenneth Bixby. It's a mess. Wallace Ford (T-Men) is a hoot as the uptight Arthur, as is Helen Chandler (Dracula) as the weepy Elizabeth.\n\nKenneth regrets his dalliance with Julie, but what's a poor fellow to do? Won't Ann help? Ann will not. She may be broad-minded, tolerant and sophisticated, but she is also hurt. Ann is determined to leave. Julie is determined to stay. Julie's family won't leave until Kenneth makes an honest woman of Julie. What is to be done?\n\nKenneth's plan on working himself out of the Julie trouble and winning Ann back involves staying in bed and acting like a maniac as the Wilson faction pursues a legal and binding solution. He also enlists the drollery of Hobart Cavanaugh (Margie) and his youngster at the mock Hearing. I'll be darned if Kenneth's plan doesn't work. The plan and the movie works for me due to Warren William's commitment to the zaniness. Much is made by commentators in later years of the superb comedy performances of Cary Grant and his fearlessness as a handsome man not being afraid to look silly. Well, that is just the sort of flair Warren William brings to his comedy outings and it is on fine display in Goodbye Again.\n\nPS: Your ears do not deceive you when watching Goodbye Again. That is the charming melody of Harry Warren's I've Got to Sing a Torch Song from Gold Diggers of 1933, wafting appropriately throughout the score.\n\nMovie: Honeymoon for Three\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nSub-genre: screwball, romance, country inns\n\nEight years after Goodbye Again, Warner Brothers returned to the play, this time with a screenplay by Earl Baldwin (Wonder Bar, Brother Orchid) with additional dialogue by Philip and Julius Epstein (Casablanca, Mr. Skeffington). The directing reins were handed to Lloyd Bacon. Mr. Bacon directed many of my personal favourites including It Happens Every Spring, 42nd Street, Marked Woman, Action in the North Atlantic and Home, Sweet Homicide.\n\nOsa Massen\n\nThe main triangle in this outing features Ann Sheridan as Ann, George Brent as Kenneth and Osa Massen as Julie. Danish born Massen was a photographer turned actress whose best remembered films might be A Woman's Face, Deadline at Dawn and You'll Never Get Rich. The multilingual Massen even coached John Wayne for his Swedish accent in the Oscar nominated The Long Voyage Home. The premise of Honeymoon for Three sticks to the play, but it is noted that in 1941 Ann is not sharing a hotel room with her boss and Ann is pressuring Kenneth to answer her marriage proposal.\n\nKenneth and Julie strive to visit her country home, but get lost along the way ending up at an the Tomahawk Inn for dinner. The couple's indiscretion is hardly that, but it will be of no consequence when they meet up with all the Wilson clan plus. Certainly, Julie has no doubt as to the emotional connection she shares with Kenneth.\n\nCharlie Ruggles\n\nCharlie Ruggles was cast as the hubby Harvey. Charlie, as always, proves himself quite adept at the comic aspects of the character. His interplay with Ann Sheridan and George Brent is delightful. However, at 55, Mr. Ruggles was not quite the perfect visual match as the hubby of the 27 year old Osa. It distracted from the idea of the couple.\n\nThe interfering Arthur and Elizabeth are on hand to complicate matters. Elizabeth is now Julie's cousin, not sister, and she is played with verve by Jane Wyman. William T. Orr, later producer of Warner Bros. 50s TV shows, is the annoyingly officious Arthur.\n\nAdditions to this version include an array of young actors, partners of Arthur, attempting to get their foothold in the impending legal brouhaha. Lee Patrick is an adoring fan who names her children after famous authors. Her attempt to get Kenneth Bixby to be godfather to Kenneth Bixby Pettijohn is amusing and impactful. Walter Catlett gets away with some great double takes at the Tomahawk Inn mentioned earlier. Catlett is a waiter constantly befuddled by the appearance of Brent at one table with the attractive Julie and then miraculously showing up at a table filled with husbands, cousins and secretaries.\n\nThe sorting out of all this confusions occurs at Arthur Westlake's office. Personally, I didn't find the finale as enjoyable as the shenanigans put on by Bixby in Goodbye Again. This script benefited from the wit of the Epsteins and the game cast, from support to leads. George Brent and Ann Sheridan had nice chemistry in their only onscreen pairing. They would be married the following year, but the union would only last one year. I love George Brent in comic roles, but would seek out Snowed Under and Out of the Blue before Honeymoon for Three. Warren William owns Kenneth Bixby.\n\nHoneymoon for Three provides the expected chuckles, but Goodbye Again has that true anarchic screwball touch that puts it at a different level.\n\n↧\n\nCMBA Fabulous Films of the 30s blogathon: Destry Rides Again (1939)\n\nThe Classic Movie Blog Association spring blogathon, The Fabulous Films of the 30s is underway. The classic movies lauded are a perfect compliment to this fresh time of year.\n\n\"Jimmy Stewart in a western - who knew?\" was the reaction of my youngest sister when I showed her 1950s Winchester '73 in her young adulthood. It was shocking to realize how deeply I had fallen down on her movie knowledge upbringing. Jimmy Stewart in a western is as natural a thing as is breathing. In the 1950s he made some of the best in the genre with director Anthony Mann. However, it all started years earlier for Stewart with the role of Tom Destry. Released in 1939, that crowded year of Hollywood excellence, there were no Academy Awards for Destry Rides Again. Instead of a gilded trophy, the movie won a place in the hearts of generations of audiences and deserves its true classic status as indicated by its placement on the National Film Registry in 1996.\n\nThe screen play is by Felix Jackson (Bachelor Mother, Three Smart Girls Grow Up), Gertrude Purcell (Stella Dallas, One Night in the Tropics) and Henry Myers (The Black Room, First Love), based on an original story by Felix Jackson suggested by Max Brand's novel Destry Rides Again. Brand's 1930 novel concerns the redemption of a conceited character named Harrison Destry, who seeks vengeance against men who framed him of a crime and finds his humanity. The popular story was filmed in 1932 starring Tom Mix. The character's name was changed to Tom, as was the custom for most of Mix's pictures. Jackson's story makes the character of Tom Destry the son of a famous lawman who follows in his father's footsteps with one notable difference. The father fought lawbreakers with six guns blazing while Tom, Jr. does not believe in guns.\n\nGeorge Marshall\n\n(1891-1975)\n\nDestry Rides Again became a slyly comic western under the directing guidance of a man skilled in both genres. Chicago born George Marshall (1891-1975) hit Hollywood at the age of 25 and for the next 50 years worked as a director/writer/actor in that industry town. In the era of learn as you go, George Marshall wrote and directed his first western short for Bison Pictures in 1916. It was called Across the Rio Grande and starred Harry Carey. For the next 15 years Marshall excelled at the short films which provided much of the entertainment of the silent era - westerns, comedies and action thrillers. He worked with western stars Neal Hart and Tom Mix, with legendary golfer Bobby Jones and with serial star Pearl White's rival, spunky Ruth Roland.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1930s that George made his first feature films including Life Begins at Forty with Will Rogers and You Can't Cheat an Honest Man starring W.C. Fields. Action and comedy, entertainingly dished out to the public, are the hallmarks of George Marshall's pictures. Audiences of the day, and audiences who grew up in the time when studio movie fare was prevalent on local television, have fond feelings toward such westerns as Valley of the Sun with Lucille Ball and When the Daltons Rode with Randolph Scott. Comedies in George Marshall's resume run from the Laurel and Hardy favourites Pack Up Your Troubles, Towed in a Hole and Their First Mistake to The Ghost Breakers and Fancy Pants with Bob Hope and the zany Murder, He Says starring Fred MacMurray. Other career highlights are the perfect little noir The Blue Dahlia starring Alan Ladd and the low-key comedy-westernThe Sheepman with Glenn Ford. Marshall's output, from the silent era to TV sitcoms, bears the hallmark of consistent quality, but among his films only one can be considered a true classic, and that one is Destry Rides Again.\n\nBottleneck's criminal element.\n\nEdmund MacDonald, Brian Donlevy, Warren Hymer\n\nMarlene Dietrich, Allen Jenkins\n\nThe setting of our story is the wide open town of Bottleneck and the tale is cheekily framed. The opening credits run over a tracking shot that starts at the shot up sign of \"Welcome to Bottleneck\" and travels a main street awash with mayhem. The scene is accompanied by Frank Skinner's rousing score filled with the insistent and melodramatic motifs we would most associate with a Saturday afternoon serial. This opening theme is repeated at the climax of the film, and the closing credits are shown over scenes of tranquility and bliss and a newly minted, much tidier \"Welcome to Bottleneck\" sign.\n\nThe dreamy black and white cinematography of Hal Mohr harkens to his Oscar-winning work on A Midsummer Night's Dream. The smoky nighttime scenes and the beautiful, shimmery greys work to give the film a nostalgic quality that takes the viewer completely into the tall tale mood of the film.\n\nPeter Bailey and son in an alternate-alternate reality.\n\nJames Stewart and Samuel S. Hinds\n\nBottleneck is under the thumb of the crooked Kent played by Brian Donlevy (Beau Geste, The Great McGinty). He swindles, cheats and murders his way to the top of the heap. His mob includes the Watson brothers, a couple of gents of the \"deese, dem and doose\" school played by Allen Jenkins (Dead End) and Warren Hymer (Meet John Doe). Samuel S. Hinds (It's a Wonderful Life) is the larcenous mayor/judge who uses his brains and titles to coolly keep the masses in line.\n\nThe face of the gang, and its headquarters at The Last Chance Saloon, is entertainer \"Frenchy\" played by the top-billed Marlene Dietrich. Ms. Dietrich revitalized her career with her portrayal of Frenchy. Her box office appeal had waned as it seems audiences had grown tired of the allure of the fascinating foreigner. With her vibrant and touching Frenchy, Miss Dietrich became a relateable and earthy screen presence. Gorgeously gowned by Vera West in glitter and feathers, and performing songs by Frank Loesser and Friedrich Hollander there is no doubt that Frenchy is the star of the show and the star of Bottleneck. The songs, You've Got That Look, Little Joe, the Wrangler and especially See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have became popular movie tunes indelibly associated with Marlene Dietrich.\n\nHooray for the new sheriff!\n\nCharles Winninger\n\nFrenchy is as hard-boiled as they come and exceptionally skilled at duping the customers. Her assistance proves invaluable in cheating a rancher out of his property. The rancher, Claggett played by Tom Fadden (Moonrise) brings his troubles to the sheriff. Sheriff Keogh played by Joe King (Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum) is summarily dispatched off screen by Kent. The mayor announces that the sheriff has left town suddenly and appoints Washington Dimsdale as the town's number one lawman. \"Wash\" is the town drunk played by Charles Winninger (Show Boat). Wash was at one time a respected deputy to the fabled Tom Destry and although he may now be a joke, he determines to live up to his newly bestowed title. Wash throws away the bottle and sends for Destry's son, who is garnering his own reputation after having cleaned up Tombstone, to bring and law order to Bottleneck.\n\nTom Destry impresses the enemy.\n\nBrian Donlevy, Billy Gilbert, James Stewart\n\nJames Stewart, at 30 years of age, was becoming America's favourite image of itself in 1939 with his roles of the idealistic Jefferson Smith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Tom Destry in Destry Rides Again. Devoting much of his time at Princeton to the University Players and training in repertory, the actor paid his dues and showed his worth in roles of increasing value over the past five years in Hollywood. He proved adept at light comedy (Vivacious Lady) and moving in drama (Of Human Hearts), now it was time to turn to a western, if an offbeat one.\n\nTom Destry arrives in Bottleneck subverting every expectation for a lawman. He does not carry guns. He doesn't believe in them. He establishes himself in the minds of the citizens as an easy-going, yarn spinning, wood carving oddball. Wash is shocked and humiliated. Kent and his gang find the situation hilarious and fortunate. Stewart as Destry plays with the hilarity, presenting himself as a fellow with a self-deprecating sense of humor, totally disarming his foes. Watch Stewart's eyes. He smiles shyly, joining in the joke, and while Kent is lapping it up, you can catch the briefest glimpse of disdain and determination flashing in those eyes. It is a look that will become familiar to audiences in Stewart's 1950s output.\n\n\"All I want is to be a cowboy and to wear my own pants!\"\n\nMischa Auer and Una Merkel steal the picture.\n\nThe first test of Destry's mettle comes in the form of a fight between two of Bottleneck's leading citizens. One of Frenchy's dupes is a Russian named Boris played by Mischa Auer (My Man Godfrey). His surname is unpronounceable, hence Boris is called Callahan by one and all as he is the second husband of boarding house owner Lily Belle Callahan. Boris, in what he knew in his heart of hearts to be an ill-considered bet, has lost his pants to Frenchy.\n\nLet the games begin!\n\nUna Merkel and Marlene Dietrich\n\nMrs. Callahan played by Una Merkel (42nd Street) storms the Last Chance Saloon to retrieve the trousers and get some satisfaction for the humiliation. What she gets is this barb from Frenchy: \"But Mrs. Callahan, you know he would rather be cheated by me than married to you.\" Such nerve must not go unanswered, and in one of the best remembered scenes from the film, an epic battle between the two women ensues. Ms. Dietrich and Ms. Merkel are hundred per centers and gave their all in the unchoreographed brawl with only the proviso of no closed fists to guide them. Tom Destry eventually puts an end to the main event by dumping a pail of water on the combatants. Lily Belle retreats in embarrassment and Frenchy wrecks the joint in an attempt to do an injury to the deputy.\n\nIt takes a heart-to-heart, plus a demonstration that proves Tom hasn't lost his sharpshooting skills, for Tom to get Wash entirely on board with the idea of deputy sans firearms. Most of the town is rather old-fashioned in that idea as well. Their thoughts are voiced by a a loud-mouth cattleman named Jack Tyndall played by Jack Carson (The Strawberry Blonde). He is the rough and tumble, always ready to rumble sort. His sister Janice Tyndall played by Irene Hervey (Three Godfathers) has a dollop of common sense mixed in with her natural spunk. It is clear to all that the pretty miss and the new deputy would make a charming couple.\n\nDo you get the feeling we're intruding?\n\nJames Stewart and Marlene Dietrich\n\nOne of the most affecting scenes in the movie is the one where everything changes for Tom and Frenchy. Tom is questioning Frenchy at her home when he strikes a nerve on the matter of Sheriff Keogh, presumed to have left town of his own accord. Her obvious fear for the truth to be revealed and for Tom's safety brings them close. In a series of close-ups you sense their growing attraction and understanding. When Tom wipes away the heavily made-up Frenchy's lipstick saying \"I'll bet you've got kind of a lovely face under all that paint, huh? Why don't you wipe it off someday and have a good look - and figure out how you can live up to it.\" he seals their fate. As Clara the maid, played by Lillian Yarbo (You Can't Take It With You), remarks, \"That man has got personality!\".\n\nEverybody down to the Last Chance Saloon!\n\nConcluding that Sheriff Keogh was murdered, Tom sets about investigating that possibility with the help of Wash and their new deputy, Boris. It is now a battle of wills and strategy between the sheriff's office and the crooks as to who will rule Bottleneck. Frenchy turns traitor to Kent in order to protect Tom, leaving Wash open to attack. Tom retaliates a brazen nighttime raid on the jail by strapping on his guns. Frenchy exhorts Lily Belle and the decent women of the town to action. The men may think they are in control when they turn main street into a shooting gallery, but they are helpless in the face of a gang of females armed with everything from two by fours to rolling pins. The Last Chance Saloon ends up the location of a rollicking free-for-all and a tragic sacrifice.\n\n\"You know, speaking of marriage, Janice...\"\n\nIrene Hervey and James Stewart\n\nLaw and order has come to Bottleneck in the form of a visionary and amiable young man named Tom Destry, who becomes the favourite son of the town; and actor James Stewart, a favourite son of the movies.\n\nThe story of Destry Rides Again is riveting and told with humour both wry and slapstick. The action and the sentiment that are essential to the film's emotional core develops naturally. The movie captivates audiences with its genuine heart, memorable characters and indelible performances. Truly, one of the fabulous films of the 1930s.\n\nA collection of essays from this blogathon series can be found here, with a click of the lovely lady's glass:\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for May on TCM\n\nOrson Welles' audacious 1958 noir-thriller Touch of Evil is one wild ride. It starts with a justifiably famous tracking shot of a murder and does not let up. Based on the novel Badge of Evil by Bob Wade and Bill Miller under the pseudonym Whit Masterson with an Orson Welles screenplay. Welles was hired by Universal initially to play Police Captain Hank Quinlan, and signed to direct at the suggestion of the already cast Charlton Heston.\n\nOrson Welles, Charlton Heston\n\nThe murder of a wealthy American businessman and his girlfriend to which we are privy is a tricky case to investigate due to jurisdiction. The crime covers both sides of the Mexican-American border. The tough and renowned Captain Quinlan has established his own way of doing the job and is not pleased at having to work with the Mexican authorities as represented by Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston). Vargas is an up and comer whose fame is reaching Quinlan proportions due to his recent work in taking down a notorious crime family.\n\nQuinlan is a mess. An overweight, grotesque ego on legs. Over the years his methods of dealing with criminals have become lax and illegal, although successful. He is not above planting evidence to ease prosecution. Quinlan is an ends justifying means fellow. Vargas calls into question the honesty of the American police officer, starting a no holds barred battle between them.\n\nOrson Welles, Janet Leigh, Akim Tamiroff\n\nQuinlan teams up with the head of the Grandi crime family \"Uncle Joe\" Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), who has his own issues with Vargas. The plan to bring down Vargas includes the virtual kidnapping of Vargas' wife (Janet Leigh) and framing her for murder.\n\nThe cast of characters that populate this time constrained story are as impossibly odd as their creator. Tana the gypsy (Marlene Dietrich) knew Hank in the old days, and she knows him now. Quinlan's long-time partner Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia) idolizes and protects his friend like a mother hen. Calleia's performance is an award-worthy understated heartbreaker. Medium-sized and bit roles by Ray Collins, Mort Mills, John Dierkes, Joseph Cotten, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Mercedes McCambridge keep the audience on their toes, ready for the next unexpected appearance.\n\nThe creepy night manager (Dennis Weaver) of the motel where Suzy Vargas is isolated and attacked should have kept Ms. Leigh away from wayside motels for the rest of her career. Don't get the wrong idea about Suzy. She is more than a mere damsel in distress. Suzy is a woman who knows her own mind and can fight for herself, but what she's up against staggers the imagination.\n\nOrson Welles, Joseph Calleia\n\nThe battle between Quinlan and Vargas takes place in a span of hours, barely more than a day, but it is the feverish stuff of nightmares. The stakes become ever higher and Quinlan's downward spiral ever deeper. In the end, it is love that will be his undoing.\n\nThe bold script and performances are enhanced by two of Hollywood's top craftsmen. Cinematographer Russell Metty, whose two Oscars are for colour pictures, displays his brilliance in black and white in this mostly shot at nighttime film. He makes you feel the heat and it gives you shivers. The film next came under the baton of composer Henry Mancini and his jazzy, rhythmic score is such a complement to Touch of Evil that it is as if he turned what was in Orson's mind into music.\n\nTCM's Friday Night Spotlight in May is devoted to the one and only Orson Welles and Touch of Evil has the prime-time spot on May 8 at 8:00 pm.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nBing's Birthday Movie: East Side of Heaven (1939)\n\nIt's that time of year again. Time to celebrate Bing Crosby's birthday. Whether the reference book designates May 2nd or 3rd in 1903, let's bake that cake, listen to those records and watch those movies.\n\nEast Side of Heaven released in 1939 was another one of Bing's personally produced pictures (following Pennies from Heaven), this time at Universal Studios teamed with actor turned director David Butler. It was a happy pairing and Bing and Butler would go on to make If I Had My Way, Road to Morocco and cameos in two Bob Hope flicks, They Got Me Covered and The Princess and the Pirate.\n\nDenny Martin, the Cruising Troubadour\n\nBing Crosby\n\nBing stars as Denny Martin employed as a singer with a telegraph company. Delivering a greeting to millionaire curmudgeon Cyrus Barrett Sr. played by the perpetually outraged C. Aubrey Smith (Four Feathers), Denny interferes in a family squabble and loses his position. Barrett Sr's daughter-in-law Mona played by Irene Hervey (Destry Rides Again) is an old friend of Denny's and he naturally takes up her side. Cyrus Barrett Jr. played by Robert Kent (Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo) has started drinking and generally misbehaving. Mona plans to leave him in hopes the shock will convince Jr. he needs to straighten up. The father-in-law gets a court order to keep her from taking their child.\n\nDenny and Mary dream about married life.\n\nJoan Blondell and Bing Crosby\n\nDenny fortunately finds another job where he can vocalize. He is the new cruising troubadour for the Sunbeam Taxi Company. He needs the job especially because circumstances have caused Denny and girlfriend Mary to postpone their wedding four times already! Mary is charmingly played by Joan Blondell (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn). Mary is not as tough a character as Blondell's roles in the earlier part of the decade at Warners, but she's got plenty of sass and spunk, and she and Bing make a great team. They are actually more than a pair, they are a trio. Denny's roommate Nicky is played by Mischa Auer (And Then There Were None) and he is allowed to steal the show to the delight of all. And it is not easy to steal a show from a baby. That's right, a baby!\n\nBaby Sandy\n\nSearching for her husband will take all of Mona's time and energy so she leaves the baby with Denny (well, in his cab) while she follows up a lead on Cyrus Jr.'s whereabouts. Here's where the fun really begins with Denny and Nicky as surrogate fathers. Ten-month-old Baby Barrett is played by Baby Sandy, and that little girl is a cutie. She's playing a boy in the movie because the producers didn't bother to check. Never mind, the kid was a natural. Her father had heard about the casting search and, using his connections as a milkman, included her picture with a delivery for music director Charles Previn. Take that Lana Turner and the soda fountain! Over the next three years Baby Sandy made seven more pictures and then, like Garbo, disappeared from the screen.\n\nClaudius De Wolfe, radio personality\n\nJerome Cowan\n\nLest you think the only villain in the piece is the rich grandpapa, we have Jerome Cowan (The Maltese Falcon) as a radio gossip by the delicious name of Claudius De Wolfe. He lives in the hotel where Mary works the switchboard and is always making unwanted plays for the gal. De Wolfe loathes Denny's singing and takes every opportunity to knock him down. He has his own publicity plans that include the presumed missing Baby Barrett.\n\nSongs in the film are by James Monaco and Johnny Burke. Monaco also has a cute cameo at the beginning of the movie. That Sly Old Gentleman from Featherbed Lane is a lullaby for the baby. East Side of Heaven is a love song to Mary. Sing a Song of Sunbeams nabs the cab company job.\n\nMary and Nicky get in on the fun!\n\nJoan Blondell, Mischa Auer\n\nHang Your Heart on a Hickory Limb\n\nHang Your Heart on a Hickory Limb is the biggest production number. It is a lesson in love sung to Cyrus Jr. at the best restaurant in the movies, The Frying Pan Cafe. Cyrus Jr. has paid some musicians to follow him around playing Melancholy Baby. It's just possible he's feeling a little sorry for himself. Bing sings \"Hickory Limb\" to liven the mood and is joined by the owner of the cafe, Mrs. Kelly played by singer Jane Jones, whom Bing knew in speakeasy days of yore. In turn she harmonizes with Rose Valyda and Helen Warner as cooks. The waitresses who join in the chorus are The Music Maids, about to join Bing's Kraft Music Hall radio program. We even get some fancy stepping from Blondell and Auer. It's a dandy!\n\nAll's well that end's well.\n\nBing Crosby, Baby Sandy\n\nHere's Bing with his hated toupee on display. In most scenes he'd rather be wearing a dashing chapeau like his little co-star. East Side of Heaven was a hit in its day and pleasant, escapist fare for current movie fans. You can't go wrong with the terrific cast, swell music and lots of laughs.\n\n↧\n\nSHORTS! blogathon: A Laurel and Hardy Double Bill\n\nYour host for SHORTS! A Tiny Blogathon is the fabulous Fritzi of Movies Silently. The blogathon dates are May 2, 3 and 4. You won't want to miss a thing.\n\nBeloved comic actors Laurel and Hardy became internationally successful and were, according to Stan Laurel, at their best in short films. Working at Roach Studios, the films relied on the talents of the professionals under contract both behind the scene and onscreen. The stock company of actors that would become familiar to audiences included James Finlayson, Edgar Kennedy, Billy Gilbert, Anita Garvin, Arthur Housman, Daphne Pollard, Ben Turpin, Charlie Hall and Mae Busch. While many of these actors were featured repeatedly in the films, they played different characters, with one notable exception. Today we will look at a rare occurrence, a sequel in the world of Laurel and Hardy shorts co-starring Mae Busch and Charlie Hall. Charley Rogers directed both films with Stan Laurel and H.M. Walker credited for writing 1934s Them Thar Hills and Stan Laurel and Frank Tashlin for 1935s Tit for Tat.\n\nPoor Ollie is suffering! He has the worst case of gout that Dr. Billy Gilbert has ever seen. Lucky for Ollie he can rely on the solicitude of his good friend Stan. Stan draws unnecessary baths and offers the most excellent advice that since gout is caused by high living that they should move to the basement. Dr. Gilbert has a more useful prescription, get away to the mountains and drink plenty of that fresh mountain water. Stan knows where they can rent a trailer for next to nothing, maybe less if they pay cash.\n\nVal-deri, Val-dera\n\nThe mountains are lovely this time of year, but unbeknownst to our travelers it can also be a place fraught with danger. Ahead on the trail a pitched battle between revenuers and moonshiners is in full swing with the moonshiners getting the worst of it. Frantically they dump as much of their product as they can down a well before being carted off to the pokey.\n\nOllie: \"It's supposed to taste that way. It's the iron in it. That's why the doctor said to drink plenty of it.\"\n\nIt is this garden spot that Stan and Ollie choose as a place to stop and enjoy nature's bounty. The boys are a perfect picture of domesticity as they set about preparing a supper of beans and coffee. Water for said coffee coming from the recently topped up well. As many of us do when going about our kitchen duties, Ollie hums a tune. In this case the tune is Billy Hill's (The Glory of Love, Wagon Wheels) The Old Spinning Wheel. Stan's unsolicited accompaniment turns the tune into the Pom-Pom Song. It is a delightful and fondly remembered bit.\n\nLost in the wilderness.\n\nWho is this coming down the road? Why, it's Mr. Hall and the Missus. He's carrying a can and she is berating him for not listening to her about keeping their car filled up. It's a long way back to the gas station, but luckily here are some folks in a camper who can help. Even without the mellowing influence of the \"coffee\" Stan and Ollie would be only to pleased to help someone in need. When the parched Mrs. Hall has a sip of water she decides to stay with the boys while hubby returns to the car.\n\nPom-Pom!\n\nWhen Mr. Hall returns with his vehicle his ears are greeted with the braying sounds of a drunken orgy of off-key \"singing\" of The Old Spinning Wheel. He is not impressed! How dare these louts get his wife drunk!\n\n!!??????!!\n\nCharlie punches Ollie in the face and dares Stan to do something about it. Now, Stan's mind tends toward bizarre little bits of business at the best of times. Under the influence of the \"coffee\" his devilish side takes over. Each time Charlie punches Ollie, Stan comes up with another oddball method of retaliation until butter, syrup, scissors, plungers and feathers leave Mr. Hall decimated. The coupe de grace, however, goes to Charlie Hall whose application of gasoline and a match to Ollie's backside causes that worthy gentleman to jump in the well. The film then comes to an explosive ending.\n\nMr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy, the screen creations, were characters fated to assiduously avoid success. Many a time they set forth in the world hoping to achieve some of the ease and satisfaction they observe in others, only to have the world incomprehensibly keep them from even their tiniest aspirations. However, this time as they are about to open their electrical supply shop (delayed by one day due to Stan's nervous breakdown), success is in the air. Perhaps it is in the clean lines of the well-stocked store and the well-defined Art Deco signage. Perhaps the good wishes of the cop on the beat. This time - yes, this time good fortune will smile on the boys.\n\nWe'll Be Back Soon\n\nOllie decides it will be a good idea to get acquainted with their fellow shopkeepers on the street. He and Stan place a \"We'll Be Back Soon\" sign next to the open door of the shop and head next door to Hall`s Groceries. They briefly stop to acknowledge a little fellow who enters their shop. They will see this fellow again. Ollie is the soul of good will and bonhomie, yet the shopkeeper glares at him. Stan suddenly remembers that fellow from the mountains. And, brother, does Charlie remember them! And does he tell them where to go! Ollie is determined to be above it all.\n\nOllie: \"Oh, don't be like that. Let bygones be bygones. Let's help each other. You have a business, and we have a business. We'll send people to your store, and you send people to our store. Wh"
