        "text": "Benjamin Stoloff | Subjects | Structure and Story Telling | Visual Style | Rankings\n\nFilms: To Beat the Band | Two in the Dark | Super-Sleuth | Radio City Revels | The Lady and the Mob | The Mysterious Doctor\n\nClassic Film and Television Home Page | Mathematics and Visual Style\n\nBenjamin Stoloff\n\nBenjamin Stoloff was a Hollywood filmmaker. He directed B movies at RKO in the 1930's. During the 1940's he became a producer. Anthony Mann directed a remake of Stoloff's Two in the Dark for producer Stoloff, at an early stage of Mann's career.\n\nBenjamin Stoloff: Subjects\n\nCommon plot elements in Benjamin Stoloff films:\n\nAmateur detectives (amnesiac hero and woman: Two in the Dark, movie detective tries to solve real crime: Super-Sleuth, society lady vs. the mob, ex-crooks get deputized: The Lady and the Mob, doctor, Bart: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nCharacters tend minor injuries (hero after attack at start: Two in the Dark, good guys after fights: The Lady and the Mob)\n\nOpenings of mystery films set in misty darkness, out of which the hero emerges, as out of nothing (Two in the Dark, The Mysterious Doctor) related (rain outside the night club: Super-Sleuth)\n\nAmnesia (hero: Two in the Dark, Bart: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nChauffeurs (suspect: Two in the Dark, Warren Hymer: The Lady and the Mob)\n\nCharacters write at desks (villain writes threatening letter: Super-Sleuth, doctor keeps small concealed journal: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nCountry inns (Palooka's Country Inn: Palooka, Running Horse pub: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nJails (The Lady and the Mob, The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nMusical instruments (dancer seems to be musician playing instrument: To Beat the Band, valuable violin played by suspect: Two in the Dark)\n\nTiresome, dull comedy relief - the low point of some Stoloff films.\n\nBenjamin Stoloff: Structure and Story Telling\n\nStory Construction:\n\nUse of character actors and comedians as his leads, rather than conventional leading men and stars (Jimmy Durante: Palooka, Hugh Herbert, Helen Broderick: To Beat the Band, Walter Abel: Two in the Dark, Jack Oakie: Super-Sleuth, Jack Oakie, Bob Burns: Radio City Revels, Fay Bainter: The Lady and the Mob)\n\nComedy scenes of actors in dual roles (Jimmy Durante as baby: Palooka, Hugh Herbert as aunt: To Beat the Band)\n\nBenjamin Stoloff: Visual Style\n\nGeometry:\n\nHighly geometric sets, featuring circular forms (fountain, with a circular sidewalk: Two in the Dark, reception area, nightclub circular ceiling: Super-Sleuth, spiral staircase, circular sunken lounge, rugs: Radio City Revels, elliptical drive: The Lady and the Mob)\n\nCircular objects and props (sphere-and-cone puzzle: To Beat the Band, umbrella with circular hole in center: Super-Sleuth, gas mask openings, cylindrical gas mask containers: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nRectangles and rectilinear areas (recessed windows and doorways in apartment form 3D areas, Zig Zag walls in night club: To Beat the Band, shelves with boxes in tailor shop, restaurant with square tables: Two in the Dark, rectangular rugs: Radio City Revels)\n\nVisual Style:\n\nArt Deco sets (To Beat the Band, film studio: Super-Sleuth, Radio City Revels)\n\nOccasional overhead shots, used for staging action (hero drops from window, policeman: Two in the Dark)\n\nSymmetrical balance of groups of characters in spectacles on the left and right side of the screen (perhaps due to the choreographers) (finale with male and female orchestras: To Beat the Band, \"Take a Tip from the Tulip\": Radio City Revels)\n\nLooking through obstacles to sets (witness peering through crack in screen, through umbrella: Super-Sleuth, heroine observing night club through window: The Lady and the Mob, looking through small jail window with curved bars: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nMulti-level sets and groups of people arranged on them (band stands at end: To Beat the Band, pub landing inside, pub porch outdoors: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nNew Clothes - and Mirrors:\n\nCharacters getting dressed up in fancy new clothes (hero shops for suit after murder: Two in the Dark, Oakie and Berle lure Bob Burns into wearing tails: Radio City Revels, heroine gets Warren Hymer chauffeur's uniform, new dress for Lupino: The Lady and the Mob)\n\nPeople see themselves in mirror wearing new clothes (hero in tailor shop: Two in the Dark, Warren Hymer admires himself in new chauffeur's uniform: The Lady and the Mob)s\n\nCostumes:\n\nEvening clothes (To Beat the Band, Super-Sleuth, Radio City Revels)\n\nDressy uniforms (Ward Bond as cop at start: Two in the Dark, Warren Hymer as chauffeur: The Lady and the Mob, Bruce Lester as officer: The Mysterious Doctor)\n\nRankings\n\nHere are ratings for various films directed by Benjamin Stoloff.

Lots of the material in it is cornball or just plain dumb, but it always makes one smile. It is better visually and in its musical numbers than in the comedy elements of the script.\n\nRKO's little B musicals of the mid 1930's are unlike anything else. They have almost nonsensical plots. The stories tend to be comic extravaganzas. They are not primarily romances, and they are not rags to riches backstage stories: the two most common kinds of Hollywood musical plots. The tone of the RKO films is bright, cheery and absurd, with plenty of upbeat comedy. Everyone seems full of energy. The musical numbers themselves are frenetic, and tend to have a comic tone, with silly lyrics and comic dance routines.\n\nCostumes: Walter Plunkett at his best\n\nSome aspects of this film are genuinely good. Walter Plunkett shows his skill with costumes. The tuxedos worn by everybody half way through the picture are terrific; I'd love to have one of these myself. The way they are worn by the whole band gives plenty of zing.\n\nThe white tie and tails worn by the band-leader later is also very stylish and upbeat. Today, when people in film wear white tie and tails, they always look unstylish. But in old movies, everyone looks sensational in them. It is unclear why. The band leader's tails are full of carefully designed curves. His white waistcoat curves into two points at its base, the claws of the coat are curved, with two circular buttons right above them, his white tie is unusually large and rounded, and his stiff collar is unusually large and tall, with a mass of interesting curved surfaces in 3D. All of these visually interesting regions add to the geometric complexity of the scenes in which he is in.\n\nThe band leader (played by Fred Keating, a real life orchestra leader) is often dressed at one level up from his band. If they are in shirt sleeves, he is in a tuxedo. If they are in tuxedos, he is wearing white tie and tails. The film as a whole gets its characters more and more dressed up it progresses; this is a standard approach in 1930's musicals. In other films, it often correlates with and visually signifies a \"rags to riches\" plot; but it has no such significance here. It is just a purely emotional pattern followed by the movie.\n\nThe night club scenes organize the band into two groups. At the right of the stage is an all woman band. They are dressed all alike in silver gowns, with black trim. On the left, are the male members of the band we have seen throughout the picture. They are in black tuxedos, with white shirts forming an accent. The two groups are like mirror images of each other. They reflect polarities: male-female, left-right, black clothes edged in white, silver clothes edged in black. Both groups sing the same song, \"Meet Miss America of 1936\".\n\nStoloff does a beautiful rapid pan from one group to the other. The night club scenes have several pans, sweeping through the complex set and the ornately costumed characters. These pans tend to be fast, and full of visual information.\n\nDancing - part of the performance of Music\n\nThe band members often move rhythmically as they play. Some stomp their feet, others move a violin bow, or pluck a bass. The band leader is always moving his hands in time with the music. Even though the band and its leader are not strictly speaking dancing, these are clearly dance scenes, and seem to be choreographed. They give the film a strong rhythmic propulsion, as everything in a shot moves in accord with the beat of the music. The band leader is often shown in front of his men. They will all be arranged in some complex pattern behind him, while he appears in the foreground of the shot. The whole group seems to operate as a team, visually as well as musically.\n\nEven the non-dance numbers in this film seem choreographed. The various members of the band are often arranged in geometric patterns on screen. So are shots with just two or three performers - they all seem to have some geometric construction. Especially beautiful are the scenes with the dance band at the end. Some of the compositions have a beauty worthy of Mizoguchi. Each band member is positioned so that he is visible as an individual, and also so that he blends into the geometry of the ensemble staging.\n\nWhen the dance soloist does come out, he is dressed just like the musicians in the band, in a matching tuxedo. He first appears as a musician, plucking on a bass. His solo is performed all over a group of musical instruments, that look just like those played by the band. This makes him part of the band team, sending many strong visual signals to indicate his membership in this group. The tap dancer here is Sonny Lamont. He is terrific, but unfortunately only made a handful of films in the later 1930's.\n\nThe Geometric Sets: Art Deco\n\nThe entire film seems to be designed on geometric lines. Most of the sets are Art Deco. Deco emphasizes pure geometric forms: rectangles, circles and their three dimensional equivalents. This means that every set is a feast of geometric forms. Aside from the people and the plants (there are flowers everywhere), everything in the film is a pure geometric object. Even the comic toy with which Hugh Herbert is obsessed is a combination of a sphere and a cone. The view through the apartment window shows a typical Deco skyscraper of New York City, built according to the famed Deco Rule of Threes. The apartment is full of recessed windows and doorways; these recesses form 3D rectilinear solids that add to the geometric splendor of the sets.\n\nZig Zag walls - and shooting angles. The night club set at the end has walls that constantly indent, at pure 90 degree angles. These walls are typically featured in the background of the shots. This gives a pure geometric form to the rear of the composition. The indenting is often repeated, and at a series of irregular intervals. This allows for elaborate compositions to be formed. There is also a horizontal band running at head level along the zig zag walls. This too helps create compositions. Stoloff can:\n\nshoot almost frontally, parallel to the zig zag walls\n\nor introduce long perspective shots, which arrange every aspect of the nightclub, patrons, band stand, wall, along long diagonal lines (very beautiful)\n\nor he can shoot at exactly a 45 degree angle to the wall, so that its zigzag in and out produces a diamond lozenge effect in the composition. These diamond scenes have a breathtaking geometrical purity, that underscores the Deco, Constructivist nature of the sets.\n\nMulti-level sets. Stoloff often stages scenes with different groups of characters at different levels of the set. In the nightclub scene, the patrons at their tables are at one level, the band leader at another, and the various members of the band on three more levels on the band stand. This allows all of the characters to be easily seen, and to be organized into systematic visual zones on screen. It also allows for beautiful compositions, with all the performers on screen to be arrayed into visually pleasing patterns.\n\nTwo in the Dark\n\nThe Opening: Geometric Sets\n\nTwo in the Dark (1936) is a mystery story, dealing with amnesia. It has a beautiful opening, in a foggy park. The fog symbolizes the mental confusion of the hero, who is just coming to and taking stock after his amnesia.\n\nThe sets here are geometrical. There is a round fountain, with a circular sidewalk around it. Radiating from it are spoke like paths. These are bounded by park benches, and sometimes fences through which Stoloff shoots. There are also spherical light globes on lamp posts. Such geometric worlds remind one of the complex interiors of Stoloff's musicals, which are also filled with circles, and with rectilinear regions.\n\nOverhead Shots\n\nThe most unusual shot in the film is the one in which Abel drops out of the rooming house window. The camera shoots straight down, and we see Abel land on the ground below, then stand up. It is visually quite dramatic. It has a different feel from any other shot in the cinema that I can recall.\n\nLater, Stoloff will include another nearly overhead shot of a policeman.\n\nStory progression\n\nSeton I. Miller's script shows expert construction. Every scene brings us a little more knowledge about the hero's background, and the mystery plot. The story is based on a novel by Gelett Burgess, Two O'Clock Courage (1934). Two O'Clock Courage is also the name of the play within the movie. Two O'Clock Courage was also used by Anthony Mann as the title of the movie remake he made in 1945, a film that had Stoloff as producer.\n\nThis film has a serene quality. In Mann's remake, there is a great sense of menace to the hero, and a feeling of suspense. Here, by contrast, the hero never seems in great danger. Instead, one feels he is a major intellect, calmly putting his life back together piece by piece, and solving the mystery. He is a figure representing Reason.\n\nMany of the scenes seem carefully timed. Both in the script and the direction, one feels that just enough time has been allotted for the characters to perform their actions. Partly, this reflects a 1930's film aesthetic, in which a huge plot had to be crammed into 70 minutes, as economically as possible. But it is also a figure of style in this movie. Take the brief scene where Abel goes back to his old friend's room. Events happen thick and fast after he reopens the door. They are timed with razor sharp rapidity.\n\nCharacter Actor as Lead\n\nStoloff tended to make films without conventional stars. Here classy supporting actor Walter Abel is his lead. Abel often played District Attorneys and other refined intellectual types. Here he has a chance to star in a picture. The lack of big stars in Stoloff films is partly a matter of their B-movie status - the filmmakers clearly couldn't afford to hire Clark Gable. Yet many other B movie directors would try to find some young unknown guy who could play a Gable-type leading man. Not Stoloff. He would star supporting actors, either such off trail comedians as Jimmy Durante or Hugh Herbert, or character actors like Abel. This gives his films a different feel from much of Hollywood cinema.\n\nTwo in the Dark is also full of familiar supporting players, mainly comic types. This reaches its high point in an early scene at the victim's mansion, with Alan Hale as a policeman, Wallace Ford as a reporter, Eric Blore as the butler, and Erik Rhodes as a visiting violinist. All of these beloved character comics play non-suspects in the movie. Later, when we shift to the hotel, and start meeting the suspects in the mystery plot, they are played by much less well known actors. The delicacy of the performances is sustained throughout. Everyone acts in a restrained and low key fashion.\n\nCostumes\n\nThe costumes are also subdued. All of the men wear suits throughout the movie: no one is in evening clothes. The heroine wears suits as well. The numerous police in the film are in matching uniforms, that also are suit-like with white dress shirts and ties. There is much less sense of class divisions here than in the remake. The heroine is an actress, moving in the same theatrical world as the hero; both seem equally refined. All of the men in the film are equally well dressed in good but quiet and dignified suits. This also conveys a sense that they are part of the same social class and world.\n\nSuper-Sleuth\n\nSuper-Sleuth (1937) is a crime comedy, with a backstage look at the film industry. Its first half is fun, but it runs out of ideas midway. The film also suffers from stereotyped \"comedy\" with its black servant.\n\nCrime Film Atmosphere\n\nThe scenes outside the night club, with the villain wandering around in the rain, show Stoloff's fondness for scenes involving mist at night. They are atmospheric. They seem to anticipate all the night-and-rain scenes, that will soon run through film noir in the 1940's.\n\nThe villain is shown writing a threatening letter at his desk, at the start. It reminds one of Peter Lorre's mad killer writing to the newspapers in M (Fritz Lang, 1931).\n\nGeometry, Sets and Art Deco\n\nThe film studio is in complete Art Deco mode. Notable is the reception area, which has a circular desk under a circular ceiling fixture. The studio exterior also contains circular logos. The nightclub also includes a circular ceiling, and many round tables.\n\nNot part of a set, but still geometric, is the strange umbrella used by the villain. First we see him filmed through a circular opening in the center of the umbrella. This shot has two concentric circles from the umbrella, and is quite striking.\n\nLooking through Obstacles\n\nNext, we see the night club through the umbrella. It serves as a circular mask. This sort of circular masking effect is common in the films of Raoul Walsh.\n\nLater, we see shots of a witness peering through a crack in a screen.\n\nBackstage in the Film Industry\n\nThe screenwriters show ingenuity, in finding ways to integrate various aspects of the film industry, into the mystery story.\n\nThere is both a scene being shot on a studio set, and one on location. Both display camera movement being created:\n\nWe see a camera receding, on the studio sound stage.\n\nAn outdoor car chase is filmed with a \"Camera car\", as its label says.\n\nThe sound stage includes a sound effects team, who make noises live during filming - just as if this were a radio broadcast. We also see an immediate playback (on a phonograph record) of the sound from a just-completed shot.\n\nCharacter Actor as Lead\n\nJack Oakie, a comedian often seen in support, here gets the starring role. Super-Sleuth also features such gifted supporting actors as Edgar Kennedy as a cop, and Paul Guilfoyle as the director of the film-within-the-film.\n\nPerhaps to make up for this, there are some leading man types in small roles. Ronald R. Rondell makes a strong impression, in his single scene as the Battling Headwaiter. He speaks in both English and his native Italian. He looks sensational in his white tie and tails, once again from the great costume designer Edward Stevenson.\n\nAlan Bruce also looks good in his supporting role as a stand-in. One wonders why this young actor's screen career was so short lived.\n\nRadio City Revels\n\nRadio City Revels (1938) is an uneven musical, parts of it being good and parts awful. Its big problem: endless scenes of unfunny comedy relief. The film manages to reduce such expert comedians as Jack Oakie, Helen Broderick and a young Milton Berle to dullness. Helen Broderick repeats a similar role and characterization as in Stoloff's To Beat the Band. We also see then popular radio comedian Bob Burns doing his Arkansas hillbilly routines, which seem very uninteresting and stereotyped. Milton Berle does do a good job with the scene in which he declares his loyalty to Jack Oakie. This is unexpectedly touching.\n\nMusical Numbers - and a strange, abstract montage\n\nRadio City Revels has some merits. Its musical numbers were actually directed by someone other than Stoloff: in this case, Joseph Santley, and were choreographed by Fred Astaire's long time collaborator, Hermes Pan.\n\nThe film starts off well, with popular tenor Kenny Baker singing \"I'm Taking a Shine to You\", followed by Ann Miller doing a delightful tap dance to this same tune. Unfortunately, this is the last time Ann Miller gets to dance till the finale of the picture, in \"Speak to Your Heart\". Kenny Baker later does a pleasant serenade of Miller at the party with \"Good Night, Angel\", but on the whole, he and Miller are woefully underemployed here. The filmmakers would have been much smarter to make a Miller-Baker musical in the style of the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies. Instead, these two talented performers are relegated to the sidelines throughout the picture. However, even the musical numbers throughout much of this film are pretty ho-hum.\n\nAside from the opening and closing numbers, with their pleasant singing and Ann Miller's dancing, the best part of the picture is a long middle sequence mainly set at Jack Oakie's apartment. First, we see the composition of \"Take a Tip from the Tulip\". This includes a creative montage, showing the song's popularity with the public. This montage emphasizes dissolves and superimpositions. Many of the superimposed images seem to be abstract white patterns representing music. The whole effect is oddly different from the typical Hollywood montage. It represents abstract prettiness rather than gritty imagery.\n\nNext comes a musical performance of \"Take a Tip from the Tulip\". The chorus singing is all in white tie and tails, the first use of this costume in the picture. They enter from the left and right side of the screen, formally marking the entrance of a new element into the film.\n\nA Spectacular Geometric Set\n\nImmediately afterwards comes a long party sequence at Oakie's apartment, which is the dramatic highlight of the non-musical sequences in the movie. All the men are in white tie and tails here, just as in the musical number. This sequence is a triumph, largely due to the highly creative apartment set.\n\nAlfred Hermann's sets are in full Art Deco mode. Jack Oakie's huge Art Deco apartment is especially delightful. Had this set been part of a more consistently entertaining movie, it might now be fondly remembered as some sort of classic. Unfortunately, it is embedded in one of Hollywood's more routine musicals. The chances of many people seeing it or studying it are slim. The cylindrical spiral staircase is especially beautiful. It looks like a piece of geometric sculpture, arising from the middle of the floor. The circular sunken lounge is also geometric. The entire apartment is like a giant sculptural environment in which the characters can wander. The geometric effect is enhanced by the rugs. Some are circular, others rectangular. These white rugs are arranged at intervals on a dark floor, and form geometric regions that integrate with the furniture and windows to produce compositional effects. The alternation of white rugs and black floor echoes the white tie and black tail coats worn by the men. The apartment also has a huge terrace, with a complex balustrade. Beyond it we see the New York City skyline, with skyscrapers and many lights that constantly blink on and off.\n\nCamera movement\n\nThere is a pleasing camera movement, which follows Oakie as he walks around, greeting the spiffy guests at his party. The camera movement has a gentle start and stop quality, as Oakie moves from group to group of guests.\n\nStoloff employs other camera movements in the film, as the characters explore the large set.\n\nCostumes: Edward Stevenson and White Tie and Tails\n\nEdward Stevenson's costumes have merit. Even Bob Burns looks classy and sophisticated in the white tie and tails Stevenson has provided for him. The party at Oakie's apartment, in which all the men are in tails and with the Deco set beautifully lit shows the glamour and escapism that RKO's expert technicians could provide. Each man's dress suit is slightly different, showing plenty of visual variety. Everyone looks as if they thoroughly enjoy wearing these polished looking outfits. Perhaps this quality of enjoyment is one reason people looked so good in the 1930's films. These were also clothes the audience would love to wear. The film makes Oakie and Berle's luring Bob Burns into wearing the dress suit part of the actual plot.\n\nThe Lady and the Mob\n\nThe Lady and the Mob (1939) is a mystery-comedy. It spoofs gangster films, with a city's sweet dowager going after the Mob. The comedy is much better in The Lady and the Mob than in some other Stoloff films.\n\nThe comedy about the heroine and her team's amateur detective work recalls Super-Sleuth, where Jack Oakie also did comic amateur detection.\n\nCharacter Actor as Lead\n\nFay Bainter, a fine actress usually seen in support, plays the elderly heroine. She is quite funny as the maniacal dowager. A note: normally, one might be concerned about her breaking the law and using vigilante tactics going after gangsters. I'm not embracing these illegal, immoral approaches here - but it is funny to see a sweet society lady doing all these outrageous things.\n\nWarren Hymer, also a supporting actor, gets a sizable role. And Ida Lupino, not yet a big star, does her usual good job with what is more a character comedy part than a leading lady.\n\nGeometric Sets\n\nWhen the car demonstrates its special features, it swirls round and around the drive in front of mansion. The drive is curved: maybe an ellipse.\n\nLooking through Obstacles\n\nThe night club scene is staged oddly. We mainly see the heroine looking through a window from outside, peering into the club.\n\nCostumes\n\nStoloff sometimes show characters getting dressed up in new clothes. Warren Hymer is given by the dowager a chauffeur's outfit that is spectacular, with boots and prominent gloves. He even gets a scene where he admires himself in the mirror.\n\nIda Lupino also gets a funny scene, where she gets a slinky black dress to do undercover work in a night club. We see her modeling it for the dowager, as the two crack wise.\n\nThe Mysterious Doctor\n\nThe Mysterious Doctor (1943) is one of many Hollywood mystery films set in the British Isles. Its story recalls a bit the much-filmed play The Gost Train (1923) by Arnold Ridley. Both have settings in remote parts of Britain, where fake supernatural elements are terrorizing the locals, and hiding sinister schemes. Both have much eerie atmosphere.\n\nStoloff and the Mystery Plot\n\nThis little mystery film is in a distinct mode: one Stoloff reserved for his mystery films. Its opening recalls that of Two in the Dark (1936). Both have characters wandering around in the misty darkness. Both protagonists emerge out of nothing, and gradually get involved with mysterious situations.\n\nOnce again, we have amateur detectives.\n\nSPOILERS. And like Two in the Dark, we have a character with amnesia. Unlike Two in the Dark, where the amnesia is a major, initial plot premise, in The Mysterious Doctor Bart's amnesia emerges only gradually during the story.\n\nWe have another eerie scene of a character writing at a desk. Here it is the doctor, making notes on a secret journal he conceals in his pipe.\n\nGeometric Sets and Props\n\nThe gas masks have circular openings. And they are carried in cylindrical containers, worn by a strap.\n\nThe sets have some curved elements. But they lack the full circular architecture sometimes found in Stoloff:\n\nThe pub has an arched portico.\n\nInside the pub, the entrance landing has two rounded pillars.\n\nMulti-Level Sets\n\nInside the pub, there is a stairway landing at the entrance. The landing is at a higher level than the main floor of the pub. This allows Stoloff to stage action on two levels: crowds of people on the main pub floor below, other people addressing them from the landing slightly above.\n\nStoloff creates beautiful compositions out of such groups of people. They recall the similarly gorgeous compositions of people on the multi-level band stands at the finale of To Beat the Band.\n\nStoloff also creates some striking compositions, looking down from the landing to the people standing on the floor below. These are also beautifully composed.\n\nOutside, the pub has a front porch, that is also at a level slightly above the street. Stoloff can also use this for staging on two levels.\n\nSocial Commentary\n\nThere are pointed remarks, about how bad it is for people to make fun of mentally ill Bart. This is an example of the growing concern in this era over the prejudice shown against minority groups.\n\nThe film also shows skepticism about the supernatural: the stupid superstitions about ghosts that inhibit constructive action."
