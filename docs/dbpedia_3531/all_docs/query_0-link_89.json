Al Jolson and May, MacAvoy in \"The Jazz Singer\" The picture has an especial appeal to Jewish for it is the story of a boy who is torn betheatre tween the emotions of loyalty to his family and his people and his profession as an actor-singer. In fact, the story of the play, parallels the life of Al Jolson. The star in real life was the son of an orthodox cantor, and ran away from home to become a jazz singer. It is in the moment of triumph, when his first play is to have its premiere in New York, that word comes that his father, too ill to sing the ancient song of rememberance in the synagogue, begs the errant son to come and do it for him .\n\nThe singer's soul is tossed between the love of the world and the woman who has made him win its plaudits and the old folks at home. The story is intensely appealing, and breathes the spirit of tolerance. Every tear is balanced by a dozen laughs and there are scenes of tremendous dramatic power. But it is the personality of Jolson, compelling, ecstatic, sobbing, yearning, smiling, dancing, kneeling in prayer, pouring out his soul in jazz or in the undying pathos of ancient sets the audience haunting, wild.

It is swift, intriguing, vivid and always entertaining, with a charming romance running through the story. Marguerite Churchill Opening in London with the inexplicable murder of an elderly millionaire, the backgrounds shift on always eastward to France, Italy, Egypt, China and Hawaii, with two additional killings and an attempted fourth one, before Charlie Chan steps in to give his aid in the situation. While Oland holds most of the acting honors, the entire cast is a notable one.
