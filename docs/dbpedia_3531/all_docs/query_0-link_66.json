        "text": "BEST MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLASSIC, RARE, AND SELDOM-SEEN FILMS\n\nBY\n\nDAN L. MILLER\n\nBest Movie Recommendations for Classic, Rare, and Seldom-Seen Films\n\nBest Movie Recommendations for Classic, Rare, and Seldom-Seen Films\n\nOn this page I offer the best movie recommendations for classic, rare, and seldom-seen films from the silent era through the Fifties. I watch movies every day because movies significantly enhance the quality of my life. I enjoy popular movies, award-winning movies, classic movies, and various genres. I find particular pleasure, however, in discovering rare, seldom-seen and classic movies that engage me and leave me with that satisfying feeling of having shared a beautiful artistic moment with those who created the film. Although I view some modern seldom-seen movies, I focus more on rare and seldom-seen movies from the Silent Era, the Pre-Code Era, and the Thirties through the Fifties.\n\nI consider rare movies to be those that are difficult to find or that may be prohibitively expensive. The 1962 French movie Thérèse Desqueyroux, Abel Gance’s Napoleon from 1927, and Disney’s Song of the South are rare because they are, generally, unavailable in the United States in a format that is playable on U.S. DVD players. Seldom-seen movies, on the other hand, are movies that are readily obtainable but are seldom viewed.\n\nMany movie viewers don’t realize the fine quality and artistic importance of rare and seldom-seen movies. One can have an incredibly moving experience discovering and watching movies that people seldom see.\n\nI endeavor in this blog to write short opinions of rare movies, classic movies, silent movies, and seldom-seen movies to point movie viewers to films I know they would appreciate and enjoy and to point out rare and seldom-seen movies that viewers should avoid because of poor quality or boring content. I include in each entry the movie title, year of release, and stars. I devote just a few words to the plot because viewers can easily access detailed synopses and reviews on such sites at IMDB.COM and AMAZON.COM. I provide a few sentences of opinion on the movie and then finish with my recommendation and a link to the movie on IMDB.COM. If I indicate a movie is a must see movie, I am confident anyone watching this movie will find the experience gratifying.\n\nI record most recent posts first and include posts from previous years in archive PDFs.\n\nWhere does one find rare and seldom-seen movies? AMAZON.COM sells most of the seldom-seen movies, and many are very inexpensive if one buys used DVDs. In some cases, seldom-seen movies are not for sale in the United States. In these cases, search the internet to find the movies for sale from foreign vendors. The cost of foreign-purchased movies is, in most cases, not much more expensive than movies purchased in the United States. (Carefully check the regional code for foreign movies, however, because some may not play on U.S. DVD players. In these cases one can use computer software to recode the movie.)\n\nA free source of seldom-seen-movies is the public library. One can request nearly any movie through the local library’s interlibrary loan process. The library can obtain at no charge any movie located in one’s state. For a small fee, the library can obtain any movie cataloged in the United States. One can also find seldom-seen-movies on the American Movie Classics (AMC) and Turner Classic Movies (TCM) cable channels. Their web sites list schedules of movies. Another source for viewing rare and seldom-seen movies is the website archive.org/index.php. One can watch online movies on the site or download movie files of videos in the public domain. There are also links on the IMDB.COM website for viewing movies in the public domain.\n\nI strongly encourage those interested in movies to explore rare and seldom-seen movies because the viewing experience can be rewarding and enjoyable. Take a break from popular movies and discover movie-making geniuses from the past and movies featuring stars who deliver astounding performances.\n\nMOVIE QUOTATIONS\n\nBecause I appreciate movies, I begin my blog with quotations that demonstrate the importance of movies in our culture and the enjoyment one can get from viewing films.\n\n———————————————————————–\n\nThe films made in the first half of the 20th century are in many ways superior to the films being made now. It wasn’t an industry forced by bankers and investors to pander to 18-year-olds. A film now has to fill vast numbers of seats. Studios have to show huge profits to the multinational corporations that own them. Not exactly like the old days of classic Hollywood.\n\n–Mike Disa\n\nThe movie is the imagination of mankind in action.\n\n–Gilbert Seldes\n\nI always liked movies…they were Milk Duds for the soul.\n\n–Joe Queenan\n\nThe moving picture is beautiful; the moving wind in the trees is more beautiful than a painting.\n\n–D. W. Giffith\n\nAll life’s riddles are answered in the movies.\n\n–Steve Martin\n\nThe cinema has no boundaries. It is a ribbon of dreams.\n\n–Orson Welles\n\nThere are more valid facts and details in works of art than there are in history books.\n\n–Charlie Chaplin\n\nHow can a serious, passionate artist not make film? It’s the most important art form ever created.\n\n–Mike Disa\n\nThrough the magic of motion pictures, someone who’s never left Peoria knows the softness of a Paris spring, the color of a Nile sunset, the sorts of vegetation one will find along the upper Amazon and that Big Ben has not yet gone digital.\n\n–Vincent Canby\n\nPictures are for entertainment, messages should be delivered by Western Union.\n\n–Sam Goldwyn\n\nWe live in a box of space and time. Movies are windows in its walls. They allow us to enter other minds—not simply in the sense of identifying with the characters, although that is an important part of it, but by seeing the world as another person sees it.\n\n–Roger Ebert\n\nThe world of reality has its limits; the world of imagination is boundless.\n\n–Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n\nFilm is the only really vital American art form right now. It’s a unifying, worldwide, powerful art form that’s unique in human history.\n\n–Mike Disa\n\nIf I can make them laugh and through that laughter make this world seem just a little brighter, then I am satisfied.\n\n–W. C. Fields\n\nWhen a movie transports me in an emotional way, it inspires my imagination or my intellect. I love to lose myself in the characters or the world the director is creating. It’s rare and wonderful.\n\n–Ron Howard\n\nFilm is a disease. When it infects your bloodstream, it takes over as the number one hormone; it bosses the enzymes; directs the pineal gland; plays Iago to your psyche. As with heroin, the antidote to film is more film.\n\n—Frank Capra\n\nOne can be sad, alone, detached from family and friends, and the movies can fill a void. Film can provide one for a short period of time with an intimate relationship with characters who fully participate in all aspects of life. One becomes absorbed in a film and vicariously experiences life through characters created by gifted artists.\n\n–Dan L. Miller\n\nTelevision and film are our libraries now. Our history books.\n\n—David Strathairn\n\nThe carpeted, gilt-adorned palace interior of the theater, where in the darkness you find two seats, whisper a remark or two, and go lifting, speeding into the great moving magic of the silver screen which pulls all into itself, lulling with the magnetic other-worldliness all who sit in adoration before it. The collection is taken discreetly at the door by the gaunt, gray-haired man in the scarlet uniform with the crust of gold braid, and the worshipers are ushered to their cushioned pews in reverent darkness. No matter if they are late; the service is continuous, and if the beginning of the first mass is missed, one may stay through the beginning of the second to achieve full continuity. In the democratic twilight, the clothes of the patrons are not in evidence. If Mrs. Allan’s hat is out of taste, if Mac the cabdriver snores through the dull first lesson or the news reel, if Mamie and Joe nuzzle each other playfully, fondly in response to the sermon of a screen kiss, there is no one to be censorious, no one who really minds. For this is the altar at which more Americans spend their time and money, daily, nightly than ever before. Here the mystic incense of the traditional popcorn, chewing gum and chocolate, of mixed perfume and whiskey smells is neutralized and cooled by the patented air-conditioning system. And here people can lose their identity in a splurge of altruism before the twentieth century god. His messengers, his missionaries are everywhere. Dark in the room above your heads, one runs the machine; reel after vibrating reel of divine life circles under his directions onto the mammoth screen, playing forth the drama, the life force, the Bible of the masses. Rave notices are circulated in the newspapers. Everybody reads them. Sex and slaughter are substituted for the sin and sulphur of the pulpits, now quite antiquated. Instead of watching a man dictate manners and morals, you watch the very workings of these manners and morals in an artificially constructed society which to you, is real. Which, to all the worshipers, is the most wonderful and temporary reality they could every hope to know.\n\n–Sylvia Plath\n\nI also present a voluminous collection of film quotations on the Best Quotes on Education and Teaching for English Teachers and Students page of my website.

They finally say he needs to “marry for money.” He agrees to marry whomever his mother chooses. Meanwhile, the prince, astride his horse during a ceremony, shamelessly flirts with a naive, young girl standing with her boyfriend. She flirts back. He later vigorously pursues her, and she responds. They both claim to be in love. Then, a wealthy acquaintance of the prince’s father offers him a million rubles for his son to marry his wealthy daughter. Erich Von Stroheim directs and stars in this film, which features, mostly, unlikable characters. Even though the ‘yuck’ factor reigns in this movie, the story itself and the acting of Fay Wray makes this film worth watching. IMDB: The Wedding March\n\nA domineering circus owner’s young ward grows to become a trapeze artist. She and a daring trapeze artist find love amidst the challenges of running the struggling circus. Their romance is tested as they work to save the circus from financial ruin and win over skeptical audiences. This film garners enough interest to warrant a view. IMDB: Under the Big Top\n\nThis film follows a British commando team tasked with a daring mission: infiltrate a German-occupied Greek island and disrupt vital Axis operations. The team faces perilous challenges as they navigate treacherous terrain and enemy forces. Tensions rise as personal dynamics intersect with the urgency of their mission. Fueled by suspense, camaraderie, and courage, the film showcases the sacrifices and heroism of those who dared to challenge overwhelming odds. Recommended for history enthusiasts and fans of classic war dramas, although the age of the film may dim modern viewers’ interest. IMDB: They Who Dare\n\nThe East Side Kids rescue a young girl from her abusive stepfather, get themselves involved with gangsters, and aid their fellow gang member (falsely accused of murder). This comedy provides a moderate level of entertainment. IMDB: ‘Neath Brooklyn Bridge\n\nWealthy steel mill owner, John Dawson, falls on hard times when a disgruntled employee at his mill tries to kill him on the floor of his mill. Losing his legs and confined to wheelchair, he organizes homeless men in a scheme to make them all rich. Heartwarming and inspiring, this film provides an entertaining viewing experience. IMDB: Beggars in Ermine\n\nHard-drinking reporter Steve Banks torments his editor with his irresponsibility and his rival reporter wife, Margaret, with his lifestyle. She threatens divorce unless he puts his life back on track. Police accuse Steve of murder when his editor turns up dead, and Margaret works to uncover the truth behind the murder. Interesting to view Carole Lombard in an early “talkie,” but the film provides only moderate entertainment value. IMDB: Big News\n\nThis Bowery Boys comedy features Slip Mahoney and Sach accidentally becoming detectives when a woman walks into the detective agency office they happen to be visiting. In searching for the woman’s “lost” sister, Slip witnesses a murder and is accused of committing the murder. The boys collectively work to uncover the murderer and the mystery behind the missing sister. This film features typical Bowery Boys humor and hijinks with moderate entertainment value. IMDB: Hard Boiled Mahoney\n\nKing Peterson runs a night club and owns a drama school. He sends the girls working for him out on “dates” with his night club clients. When girls turn up missing, the district attorney investigates. This pedestrian “B” movie offers a mildly interesting plot with mediocre acting and a moderate level of entertainment. IMDB: City of Missing Girls\n\nHarry Young runs a night club as a front for his mob-related crimes. When he lures an out-of-work, naive girl into living in an apartment in his night club complex, he pressures her to become “his” girl, despite the fact that she’s falling in love with another man. When Harry realizes her passion for another man, he targets him for death. George Raft plays an Asian and Anna Mae Wong plays her stereotypical role as a mistress and “scheming” Asian. Despite the subtle racism of the period, this film provides enough entertainment value to warrant a view. IMDB: Limehouse Blues\n\nJerry and Dean get fired and pursue the beautiful artist and her model who live in their apartment building. Dean turns to illustrating comic books with Jerry’s ideas that come to him while dreaming. His ideas, unfortunately, coincide with the government’s secret weapon formulas, and government agents pursue the pair. Dean’s songs and Jerry’s antics highlight this film, and Shirley McClain steals many scenes with her kookiness as the catwoman in pursuit of Jerry. This film entertains with action galore, beautiful women, and the typical Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis humor. Enjoy. IMDB: Artists and Models\n\nCynthia’s parents put their ambitions on hold when Cynthia is born as a sickly child. Her parents strictly protect her, and her doctor uncle ferociously controls her life. As a teen, however, Cynthia insists on breaking out and living like her peers. The acting, the storyline, and Elizabeth Taylor starring as a teen in this marvelous film make it Must-See viewing. IMDB: Cynthia\n\nThe East Side Kids work at an airport—all but Mugs, who hangs around the airport. Sabotage takes place at the airport, and an administrator asks Danny to go undercover to uncover the saboteurs. Mystery, action, suspense, and humor highlight this typical East Side Kids outing resulting in an average level of entertainment. IMDB: Flying Wild\n\nIn this classic film noir an overweight private detective works to solve the murder of an innocent dentist, after an assassin throws the dentist from his hotel window. The detective’s investigation uncovers secrets that lead to a shocking revelation. Julie London’s starring role in this movie and Emmett Kelly’s dramatic role add to its appeal. This film entertains and deserves a view. IMDB: The Fat Man\n\nA detective investigates the deaths of government agents and a series of suspicious plane crashes. Those he investigates set out to kill him. This true “B” movie plods along and can be skipped. (The Doris Day who stars in this film worked in “B” movies from 1939 to 1943, when she retired. The more famous and successful Doris Day debuted in 1948.) IMDB: Federal Fugitives\n\nAssistant district attorney, Cleve Marshall, falls in love with a woman, Thelma Jordon, who walks into the office looking for help with robberies at her aunt’s estate. He’s an alcoholic, married with children, and struggling with his marriage. After becoming more deeply involved in his affair, he’s called on to serve as prosecutor in Thelma Jordan’s trial when she’s accused of murdering her aunt for her money. The suspense, the plot twists, and the spot-on acting make this murder mystery Must-See viewing. IMDB: The File on Thelma Jordan\n\nTeenager Jo lives in squalor with her man-hungry mother. Jo meets and falls in love with a Black sailor and becomes pregnant. Her mother then marries one of her lovers and abandons Jo to fend for herself. This alternately heartbreaking and delightful film addresses controversial issues (at the time) of interracial relationships, teen pregnancy, and homosexuality. Rita Tushingham’s emotional performance in her film debut makes this movie Must-See viewing. IMDB: A Taste of Honey\n\nIn San Francisco during World War II a couple meet in a diner, fall in love and marry within three days. He then deploys, and she returns home to live with her father. When he returns from the war, he meets his toddler son, and the couple realize they are incompatible. In divorce court, the judge orders them to return to San Francisco and repeat each moment of their three days together there when they married. Jean Arthur’s low-key approach to her role makes this film a winner. Engaging from beginning to end, viewers will find this romantic comedy Must-See viewing. IMDB: The Impatient Years\n\nA broadway star works with her cast and crew to play a cruel practical joke on an arrogant newspaper reporter. She eventually gets pulled into his investigations and falls in love with him. Their tumultuous relationship plays out in the midst of major burglary that involves them both. This film maintains interest and provides significant action and humor. Viewers will find the film well worth watching. IMDB: Adventure in Manhattan\n\nPainfully shy Laura, due to a childhood disease, walks with an awkward limp and lives with her domineering mother, adoring her collection of glass animals and listening to old records left when her father abandoned the family. Her mother harasses her brother to bring home a gentleman caller for Laura, but he only yearns to leave the toxic environment at home for a life of his own. This film closely follows Tennessee Williams’ classic play with top-notch acting and deserves a Must-See rating. IMDB: The Glass Menagerie\n\nWhen a man fatally shoots his wife’s lover, defense attorney, James Blane, successfully defends him court. The local sheriff then conspires to frame the attorney accusing him of bribing a juror in the trial. The attorney then goes on trial and faces prison. Credible acting and a suspenseful plot make this film worth watching. IMDB: The Tattered Dress\n\nDuring a dispute between Drummond Hall and his lover, she drunkenly falls (or is pushed) from the beach home’s balcony to her death on the rocks below. Lynn Markham then moves into the home and falls in love with Drummond. She eventually marries Drummond but, because of his suspicious behavior, fears he will kill her. The slow pace, the unrealistic plot and forced relationships make this film only watchable. IMDB: Female on the Beach\n\nCollege student Peggy and her sister move from Ohio to Pasadena with their controlling, irascible father. Peggy secretly married Ohio State University’s quarterback before leaving Ohio, and now the OSU football team travels to Pasadena to play in the Rose Bowl game. Meanwhile, Peggy and her sister compete in the Rose Bowl Queen contest even though married students are ineligible. Even though Coburn’s over-the-top irascibility may irritate viewers, this light-weight romantic comedy features competent acting, an interesting plot, and historic footage of the Rose Bowl parade. The film provides a pleasant viewing experience. IMDB: Peggy\n\nIn the process of divorcing, wealthy ‘Sky’ Fairchild’s new love interest serves in the military and makes plans to be near him overseas. Her influential father tells her she can join her new love overseas and even become a general by joining the military herself. She joins and expects to be treated as her wealthy, privileged self. Officers treat her no differently than any other recruit, and she suffers through basic training. This light-weight comedy is watchable but mediocre at best. IMDB: Never Wave at a Wac\n\nThis wacky comedy follows the love interests and shenanigans of doctors, nurses, and patients in an urban hospital. Comedic chaos reigns is this British film, and if corny British jokes, slapstick and sexual escapades interest you, this film satisfies. IMDB: Carry on Doctor\n\nAs a young girl living in poverty Jassy experiences accurate premonitions, and others consider her a witch. She loses the love of her life to class prejudice and her father to murder. She lives a tumultuous life thereafter, seeking revenge and working to address grievances against her lost love. Suspense, intrigue, drama, strong acting, and engaging plot make this film Must-See viewing. IMDB: Jassy\n\nTeen Nancy earns a small role in a play, but the director tells her she will actually play the lead, but she has to keep it a secret. She travels to Rio to visit her mother and grandfather and while on the ship practices her lines. Her character becomes pregnant, and an older gentleman overhears her learning her lines and assumes Nancy’s actually pregnant. Word spreads and others treat her as if she’s a pregnant teen. Nancy meets her mother in Rio, and sees her mother learning her lines for the role promised to Nancy. Nancy then decides to concentrate on her relationship with her older gentleman, but he seems to be falling in love with—her mother. The music, the acting, the engaging story make this entertaining romantic musical/comedy well worth watching. IMDB: Nancy Goes to Rio\n\nAfter David Trask’s wife confesses to an affair, he abandons his wife and children. During a long rain delay in an airport and then aboard the plane, Trask develops close relationships with three fellow travelers. When the plane crashes and Trask survives, he visits the spouses of his fellow travelers who died, revealing details of their lives that impacts their spouses. The star power; the drama; the emotional, engaging plot make this film Must-See viewing. IMDB: Phone Call from a Stranger\n\nKaren Glover stars in a broadway musical with her womanizing boyfriend. Fed up with him, she accepts an invitation to star in a Rocky Mountain resort, where she also begins a romance with the resort’s owner. Although engaged to another entertainer, her boyfriend shows up at the resort and complicates all relationships. First-class acting, Rocky Mountain scenery, outstanding musical numbers…and Betty Grable make this film worth watching. IMDB: Springtime in the Rockies\n\nDetective Boston Blackie investigates the theft of a valuable diamond from a display overseen by armed guards. With a mix of humor, action, and suspense this film from the Boston Blackie series entertains enough to deserve a view. IMDB: One Mysterious Night\n\nEve Lorraine struggles to find success as an entertainer and performs as a sexy dancer in a club, and after a performance the police arrest her. She discloses her past growing up as an orphan, and a wealthy family investigates her past to determine if she could be the missing daughter of one of their deceased family members. Although a “B” movie with inconsistent acting, the story provides enough interest to warrant a view. IMDB: A Fig Leaf for Eve\n\nClassical music composer, Kenneth Harvey, visits a Greenwich Village club while visiting New York trying to get his concerto published and performed. He becomes involved with the characters at the club and falls in love with the club’s singer. First-class stars, Vivian Blaine’s film debut, an interesting plot, and entertaining musical numbers make this film Must-See viewing. IMDB: Greenwich Village\n\nMARCH-JUNE 2023 POST\n\nThe Saturday Night Kid (1929) Clara Bow, Jean Arthur, James Hall, Edna May Oliver, Jean Harlow\n\nMayme lives in an apartment with her younger sister, and they work at the same department store. Mayme’s boyfriend, Bill, lives in the next apartment. Mayme’s little sister works to undermine her at work and with her boyfriend. Even with poor production values and mediocre acting, Clara Bow puts enough star power into an interesting story to make this film worth watching. (Jean Harlow makes her first credited appearance in this film as a department store sales girl.) IMDB: The Saturday Night Kid\n\nSilent Enemy, The (1958) Laurence Harvey, Dawn Addams, Michael Craig, Gianna Maria Canale\n\nBritish forces train frogmen to combat enemy frogmen who are sinking ships with underwater mini-subs and attaching bombs to the hulls of docked ships. Although this films offers some underwater action, it also features too much hokey business which distracts from the plot. Based on actual events, this war film is watchable. IMDB: The Silent Enemy\n\nMr. Arkadin (Confidential Report) (1955) Orson Welles, Peter van Eyck, Michael Redgrave, Patricia Medina, Akim Tamiroff, Mischa Auer\n\nWealthy and powerful Mr. Arkadin uses extreme measures to oversee his daughter’s activities and fears suitors seeking wealth through marriage. When one suitor makes headway with his daughter, Mr. Arkadin seeks to remove him by hiring him to conduct a world-wide investigation into a woman from his past. The investigator uncovers Mr. Arkadin’s horrible, deadly deeds, however, which Mr. Arkadin strives to shield from his daughter—at all costs. This unusual Orson Welles’ film features Welles in the title role and a murky plot that plods along to a frantic conclusion. Worth watching, but not one of Welles’ best. IMDB: Mr. Arkadin\n\nThe Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959) Steve McQueen, Crahan Denton, David Clarke, Molly McCarthy\n\nBased on actual events, this film follows the plotting and eventual robbery of a St. Louis bank. The girlfriend of one of the participants does everything she can to keep him out of the scheme. This “B” film features poor production values and amateurish acting. Steve McQueen stars in one of his early films, and viewers will find this film interesting mostly because of McQueen. IMDB: The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery\n\nPeck’s Bad Boy (1934) Jackie Cooper, Thomas Meighan, Jackie Searl, Billy Gilbert\n\nBill enjoys an ideal relationship with his single dad until his aunt and her son move in. They both aggressively act to take over the house and Bill’s life. Jackie Cooper shines as an aggrieved young boy in this interesting family drama, and acting and the story make this film worth watching. IMDB: Peck’s Bad Boy\n\nPeck’s Bad Boy with the Circus (1938) Tommy Kelly, Ann Gillis, Edgar Kennedy, George ‘Spanky’ McFarland, Louise Beavers, William Demarest\n\nWith his parents out of town, Billy sneaks into the circus with his friends. He gets to know the girl who stars as the trick horseback rider in the show. When the circus owner’s wife, trying to promote her own act, sabotages the young star’s act, the girl falls and injures herself. Billy steps in to save the day. The film works well with adequate acting and an interesting story. Viewers will find the movie entertaining, humorous and worth watching. IMDB: Peck’s Bad Boy with the Circus\n\nSo’s Your Aunt Emma (1942) Zasu Pitts, Roger Pryor, Warren Hymer\n\nAunt Emma had planned to marry a prize fighter, but he died. Years later when she hears of the fighter’s son fighting, she gets involved to help the young man with his career. Unfortunately, she steps into the middle of criminals’ control of the fight game. Zsa Zsu Pitts usually plays supporting roles, but she shines as the star of this film. This ‘B’ film offers a moderate level of entertainment, but it’s unrealistic plot and hokey bits make it only watchable. IMDB: So’s Your Aunt Emma\n\nThirteenth Guest (1932) Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, J. Farrell MacDonald\n\nThe story takes place in an old mansion with a banquet of thirteen guests, including children and adults. Thirteen years later, someone murders one of the guests in the mansion, and private investigator, Phil Winston, works to solve the murder as well as others as more guests turn up dead. Confusing at times, but this typical murder mystery stars Ginger Rogers, who makes any film interesting. This movie entertains enough to watch. IMDB: Thirteenth Guest\n\nPitfall (1948) Dick Powell, Lizabeth Scott, Jane Wyatt, Raymond Burr\n\nInsurance adjustor, John Forbes, has grown bored with his routine life—job, wife, child. Before he visits the girlfriend of a criminal incarcerated for stealing money to buy her expensive gifts—including a jewels, furs, and a boat, his ex-cop insurance investigator warns him to keep his hands off “his girl.” When Forbes meets with the girlfriend to categorize, value, and recover the items purchased with stolen funds, she calls him out as “more of a machine than a human being.” She triggers his desire to break free from his hum-drum life, he falls in love, and has an affair with her. Even though she fears the stalking behavior of Forbes’ investigator, the investigator goes to extremes to keep “his girl.” This outstanding film noir features a gripping story with first class acting. This film keeps viewers glued to the screen with suspense and plot twists galore. This film is Must-See viewing. IMDB: Pitfall\n\nRed Ball Express (1952) Jeff Chandler, Alex Nicol, Charles Drake, Sidney Portier, Hugh O’Brian\n\nGeneral Patton advances so quickly into enemy territory during WWII that he outruns his supplies. Military strategists create a continual convoy of trucks to deliver supplies in record time over dangerous roads. This film recreates the ‘Red Ball Express” experience around the conflict between the commanding officer and his second-in-command, who accuses him of killing his brother. Although the film includes some combat action, it focuses more on relationships among the soldiers and the dangerous convoy journey itself. The film also features a young Sidney Portier in one of his early roles. This film warrants a view. IMDB: Red Ball Express\n\nRed Salute (1935) Barbara Stanwyck, Robert Young, Hardie Albright\n\nDru Van Allen, wealthy daughter of a general, plans to marry a radical who promotes anti-government policies. Her father tricks her into getting into a plane, locks her in, and sends her to Mexico with her aunt to distance her from her fiancé. In Mexico she meets a soldier in a bar and teams up with him to flee the authorities after breaking numerous laws. He wants to flee to the west coast to leave the country. She wants to head east to her home to marry her fiancé. Chaos ensues. Barbara Stanwyck usually stars in first-rate films. Red Salute stands as one of her lesser films. The continual sarcastic bickering between Stanwyck and Young becomes tiresome, but the film offers enough action and humorous bits to make the film worth watching. Red Salute\n\nNotorious but Nice (1933) Marian Marsh, Betty Compson, Don Dillaway, J. Carrol Naish, Louise Beavers\n\nA young office worker, Jenny Jones, plans to marry her boss’s son, but her boss disapproves of her and hires a private detective to investigate her to find some dirt to present to his son. He then sends his son on a long business trip and fires Jenny. She can’t pay her rent, gets evicted, and falls in with criminal elements. Major complications ensue. This drama with plot twists galore features an engaging story, spot-on acting, and an innocent, naive protagonist who garners maximum sympathy. This engaging and highly entertaining drama is well-worth watching. IMDB: Notorious but Nice\n\nOctober—Ten Days That Shook the World (1927) Boris Livanov, Nikolay Popov, Vasili Nikandrov\n\nThis film recreates in great detail the critical days of the 1917 Russian Revolution—filming in the locations prominent in the major events of the time. This masterpiece by director Sergei Eisenstein makes extraordinary use of close-ups of faces, weapons, and dead bodies, and the action is continuous. It’s fascinating to watch this recreation of a monumental historical period. The film is well worth watching. IMDB: October–Ten Days that Shook the World\n\nPhantom Ship (The Mystery of the Mary Celeste) (1935) Bela Lugosi, Shirley Grey, Arthur Margetson\n\nHistorically a ship was found in the mid-Atlantic in 1872 with no one on board. This film dramatizes what may have happened to everyone on that ship featuring plenty of conflict and action. To complicate matters the captain brought his new bride on the voyage. The film also showcases Bela Legosi’s acting skills in a non-horror role. Decent acting and non-stop action make this film worth watching. IMDB: Phantom Ship\n\nMeet Dr. Christian (1939) Jean Hersholt, Dorothy Lovett, Robert Baldwin\n\nA humble, small-town doctor serves all patients equally, regardless of their ability to pay. He battles the mayor to build a hospital, but the mayor bases all his decisions on the bottom line. This pleasant drama works toward a predictable conclusion while providing a moderate level of entertainment. IMDB: Meet Dr. Christian\n\nMisbehaving Husbands (1940) Harry Langdon, Betty Blythe, Esther Muir, Gig Young\n\nA divorce lawyer preys on rich women and targets the wife of Henry Butler, a department store owner, who a friend of his wife accuses of infidelity when she sees him after work arranging a display dummy on a bed and assumes he’s having an affair. This lightweight comedy provides some laughs, but its illogical plot makes it worth watching only if you have no other entertainment options. IMDB: Misbehaving Husbands\n\nMore Than a Secretary (1936) Jean Arthur, George Brent, Lionel Stander, Dorothea Kent, Reginald Denny\n\nCarol works as a teacher in a secretarial school. When she has to expel Maizie, an incompetent student, she asks her why she’s in school. She responds that she wants to ‘get a man.’ Maizie is so sexy and flirtatious that she gets a job on the way out of the school with a man waiting to interview candidates. Carol feels ‘getting a man’ is a reasonable goal and goes to work as the secretary the publisher who fires every graduate Carol sends him. The well-crafted film with first-rate acting and an engaging story delivers. The film provides a great vehicle for the talents of Jean Arthur. This comedic gem is Must-See viewing. IMDB: More than a Secretary\n\nMurder on the Campus (1933) Shirley Grey, Charles Starrett, J. Farrell MacDonald, Ruth Hall\n\nA popular student works as the bell ringer in the campus bell tower. As the bells ring, students hear a shot fired, but no one exits the one doorway leading from the tower. When police enter the tower, they find no one but the dead student. This moderately interesting who-done-it features plot twists and an inventive means of murder. IMDB: Murder on the Campus\n\nEkstase (1933) Hedy Lamarr, Zvonimir Rogoz, Aribert Mog\n\nA groom carries his young bride over the threshold of their hotel room and then ignores her—no intimacy. At breakfast he sits at the table reading his newspaper. The young bride looks for love elsewhere. This incredible film relies on outstanding cinematography, a simple, but powerful story, and the natural beauty of Hedy Lamar to make this film Must-See Viewing. IMDB: Ekstase\n\nHoop-La (1933) Clara Bow, Preston Foster, Richard Cromwell\n\nA young man, Nifty, who’s been ‘riding the rails’ hops off at a town where his father works for the carnival as a barker for the hoochie coochie dancer, Lou. His father wants more for his son than working in a carnival, but reluctantly gives him a job. His father breaks up with his long-time lover because he doesn’t want his son to know about their relationship. His lover promises to pay the older, experienced Lou $100 to lure the young man into an affair to pull him away from his father. Clara Bow makes any film interesting, and she heats up this soap opera. Although no award-winner, viewers will find Clara Bow’s last film worth watching. IMDB: Hoop-La\n\nHouse of Rothschild, The (1934) George Arliss, Boris Karloff, Loretta Young, Robert Young, C. Aubrey Smith, Reginald Owen, Alan Mowbray\n\nMayer Rothschild works as a money lender in the ghetto and stresses on his five sons that “money is power.” On his deathbed he advises his sons to become leading bankers in five European capitals. They all become successful and played major roles in financing European governments, addressing antisemitism, and targeting funding during Napoleon’s attempted return to power. This film features competent acting, an interesting historical drama, and a subplot of Nathan Rothschild’s daughter falling in love with a Gentile, all of which make this film worth watching. IMDB: House of Rothschild, The\n\nLady Says No, The (1951) Joan Caulfield, David Niven, James Robertson Justice, Frances Bavier\n\nDorinda Hatch writes a bestseller encouraging women to forgo kissing and flirting. Photographer Bill Shelby interviews and photographs her for an article and tricks her into kissing him. She morphs from a man-hater to a man-eater. This fluff piece fails. Although starring talented actors, the writer and director put Niven and, particularly, Caulfield in awkward, cringy scenes. I watched this dud so you wouldn’t have to. IMDB: Lady Says No, The\n\nLaughing at Life (1933) Victor McLaglen, Conchita Montenegro, William ‘Stage’ Boyd, Regis Toomey, Ruth Hall, Tully Marshall\n\nDennis P. McHale travels the world as a soldier of fortune, always in the midst of mayhem and always dodging the law. Although he abandoned his wife and son, he meets his son during a revolution and tries to dissuade him from leading the life he pursued. This film follows an alpha male in his adventures around the world—always running from authorities. Action makes the film mildly interesting. IMDB: Laughing at Life\n\nLife and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, The (1947) Derek Bond, Cedric Hardwicke, Mary Merrall\n\nWhen his father dies, Nicholas Nickleby finds himself at the mercy of his wealthy, uncle who attempts to control all aspects of his life as well as his sister’s life.\n\nThis film follows the plot of Dickens’ novel with all the typical characters—child abusers, wealthy villain, and plucky hero. Young viewers will find this film dated and dull, but mature viewers can enjoy this film with attentive viewing. IMDB: Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, The\n\nLost Moment, The (1947) Robert Cummings, Susan Hayward, Agnes Moorehead\n\nAn American publisher travels to Venice to obtain, by any means possible, the love letters of a renowned, deceased poet who disappeared mysteriously. The publisher intends to make a fortune by publishing them. The letters, however, are in the possession of the poet’s former lover, a reclusive, eccentric woman over one hundred years old. She lives in a large, forbidding mansion with her deranged niece. How to categorize this film—romance, horror, mystery, drama? Whatever the category, the stars, the engaging story, and on-point acting make this film entertaining and Must-See viewing. IMDB: Lost Moment, The\n\nHarmony Lane (1935) Douglass Montgomery, Evelyn Venable, Adrienne Ames, William Frawley, Smiley Burnette\n\nThis Stephen Foster biography dramatizes his life falling in love, marrying, and succeeding and failing as a songwriter. Although Montgomery lacks appeal in his portrayal of Stephen Foster, the story and the supporting actors make this film well worth watching. IMDB: Harmony Lane\n\nHeld for Murder (Her Mad Night) (1932) Conway Tearle, Irene Rich, Mary Carlisle\n\nSocialite, Joan Manners, meets wealthy lawyer, Steven Kennedy, on an ocean voyage, and they fall in love and plan to marry. The lawyer serves as guardian to his teenage “sister.” While her guardian sailed, she developed a relationship with Steven’s best friend, a much older man, who also happened to be in a long-term relationship with Joan. More intrigue ensues regarding the sister’s real mother and the actual murderer in this film. Despite this film’s “B” status, stiff acting, and some hokey situations, the complicated, engaging story and some emotional performances make this film well worth watching. IMDB: Held for Murder\n\nHis Double Life (1933) Roland Young, Lillian Gish, Montagu Love\n\nWorld famous artist, Priam Farrel, lives with a phobia about people and leads such a reclusive life that most people have never seen him.

Unknown to Farrel, his valet had been corresponding with a marriage bureau to match him with a mate. His match shows up in London and meets with Farrel, assuming her developing relationship is with the valet. This intriguing, complicated comedy showcases the talents of Roland Young and, particularly, Lillian Gish. The film entertains, provides smiles rather than laughs, puts the Silent Era’s superstar, Gish, in an emotional, empathetic, speaking role—all of which make this film Must-See viewing. IMDB: His Double Life\n\nGo for Broke! (1951) Van Johnson, Lane Nakano, George Miki, Gianna Maria Canale, Hugh Beaumont\n\nA new lieutenant joins his squad in basic training and leads them into battle in the European theatre. The Anglo lieutenant commands an all Japanese-American squad, even though he holds a strong prejudice against “Japs.” This film focuses more on the relationships of the soldiers and their interactions with their lieutenant than on battle action. The movie entertains enough to make it worth watching. IMDB: Go for Broke!\n\nGreene Murder Case (1929) William Powell, Florence Eldridge, Ullrich Haupt, Jean Arthur, Eugene Pallette\n\nElderly and bedridden Sibella Greene gathers the family together in her mansion to discuss her will. The family members hate each other and someone begins killing other family members. Philo Vance steps in to solve the mystery.

Furnival, surprised Western movie star, Ben Castle, when she showed up to represent him to address gambling debts. As an ardent fan, A. J. falls in love with the gambling, drinking, womanizing star, and makes every effort to keep him out of legal trouble.

IMDB: Groom Wore Spurs\n\nGet Your Man (1927) Clara Bow, Charles ‘Buddy’ Rogers, Josef Swickard\n\nThe father of a young boy, Robert Albin, arranges his marriage to a baby. Seventeen years later the couple make plans for their marriage, and Robert travels to Paris to pick up a necklace for his bride. He repeatedly and coincidentally runs into a young, American girl. They get to know each other, fall in love, and scheme to address his arranged marriage. This film features Clara Bow scheming to get her man. The scheme entails making her man jealous throughout the film, and her antics make this film well worth watching. IMDB: Get Your Man\n\nEscape to Paradise (1939) Bobby Breen, Kent Taylor, Marla Shelton, Joyce Compton, George Meeker\n\nA ditzy blonde relentlessly pursues a wealthy traveler on a cruise ship. When he falls in love with a beautiful woman during a shore excursion, he abandons the cruise to relentlessly pursue her. Viewers can skip this truly forgettable film. IMDB: Escape to Paradise\n\nFar Country (1954) James Stewart, Ruth Roman, Corinne Calvet, Walter Brennan, John McIntire, Harry Morgan, Jack Elam\n\nA corrupt judge in Skagway uses trumped-up charges to sentence Jeff Webster to jail time and confiscate his heard of cattle. When Webster gets out of jail, he steals his cattle back and drives them to sell them in the lawless town of Dawson. The judge and his gang show up in Dawson to confiscate residents’ mining claims and terrorize the populace. The citizens look to Webster to confront the oppressors. The longer one watches this film the more interesting it gets. In addition to the violence and conflict, a romantic triangle lends another dimension to the plot and makes this outstanding Western well worth watching. IMDB: Far Country\n\nThe Flapper (1920) Olive Thomas, Theodore Westman Jr., William P. Carleton, Dorothy Kent, Katherine Johnston\n\nSixteen-year-old Ginger sneaks off to a club with her boyfriend, and her strict father sends her to a boarding school…next to a military school in which her boyfriend enrolls. She repeatedly sneaks out of her boarding school to meet her boyfriend and eventually to meet a much older man who assumes she is older. She behaves in any way that will make her seem older and more ‘experienced.’ Her behavior eventually makes her the goat in a burglary scheme, and she sends letters home that alarm her parents. This cute, romantic comedy reflects sophisticated production values for an early silent film, and Olive Thomas’s antics make this film well worth watching. (Shortly after this film came out Olive Thomas died in a scandalous accident.) IMDB: The Flapper\n\nThey Won’t Forget (1937) Claude Rains, Gloria Dickson, Edward Norris, Otto Kruger, Lana Turner\n\nSomeone murders a beautiful business school student, and a politically-motivated prosecutor and a violent, bigoted community mob targets the student’s teacher. Lana Turner plays a brief, but riveting, memorable role in this drama. This well-crafted crime/courtroom drama entertains and examines social norms that lead to corruption and mob violence. Viewers will find this film well worth watching. IMDB: They Won’t Forget\n\nUncle Joe (1941) Slim Summerville, Zasu Pitts, Gale Storm, Marvin Hartley Orchestra\n\nStrict father, J. K. Day, disapproves of his teenage daughter, Clare, posing for a local artist, so he sends her to the country for a visit with Uncle Joe. On her visit with Uncle Joe, Clare becomes the object of admiration by a group of teenage boys, enlists the help of all to assist her aunt facing financial difficulties, and continues to pose for the artist. The thin plot and several so-so musical numbers make this comedy worth watching, but barely. IMDB: Uncle Joe\n\nFollow Your Heart (1936) Marion Talley, Michael Bartlett, Nigel Bruce\n\nAn eccentric family living on a Kentucky plantation thwarts the daughter’s plans for marriage with their behavior and financial distress. The daughter leads the family out of disaster by planning an operetta. The talents of Metropolitan Opera star, Marion Tally, don’t translate that well to starring in a poorly conceptualized film. Because a majority of this film consists of opera singing, the lead actress playing an unlikable character, and several characters carrying out silly, unfunny antics, modern viewers will find this film unwatchable. IMDB: Follow Your Heart\n\nFresh from Paris (Paris Follies of 1956) (1955) Forrest Tucker, Margaret Whiting, Dick Wesson, Barbara Whiting, Lloyd Corrigan, The Sportsmen Quartet\n\nThe producer of a musical revue faces challenges—the star of his review joined the cast believing he was in love with her when, in fact, he proposed to the scenic designer, and his financial backer turns out to be a delusional psychiatric patient. This film features entertaining musical numbers and Margaret Whiting with her real-life sister as her ambitious understudy. The simple plot serves to highlight the dancing and singing, and fronts a film entertaining enough to watch. IMDB: Fresh from Paris\n\nThe Bohemian Girl (1936) Stan Laurel,Oliver Hardy,Thelma Todd, Darla Hood, Mae Busch, Julie Bishop\n\nA band of gypsies, including Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, camp near the castle of Count Arnheim. The count orders his guards to remove them and flog them if necessary. Stan and Ollie pickpocket the locals, and Ollie’s wife and her lover kidnap the Count’s toddler daughter. When Ollie’s wife leaves with her lover, she leaves the Count’s daughter with Ollie to raise. This unusual film features the standard Laurel and Hardy antics, musical numbers, but also subpar acting and weak production values. It stands as one of the pair’s least-seen films, and Thelma Todd died before the film was released. The highlight of the film, a haunting rendition of “I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls” makes the film worth watching. IMDB: The Bohemian Girl\n\nMr. Celebrity (1941) Robert ‘Buzz’ Henry, James Seay, Doris Day, Francis X. Bushman\n\nA custody battle focuses on the fact that the grandparents seeking custody of a young orphan resent the race track environment in which he is being raised. However, the boy flourishes in the environment under the supervision of well-meaning caregivers. Weak acting and a slim plot make this film one to skip. IMDB: Mr. Celebrity\n\nRoaring Roads (1935) David Sharpe, Gertrude Messinger Mary Kornman, Mickey Daniels\n\nWealthy, privileged young man, Bob Merritt, yearns to break free from the strangle-hold his aunts have on his life, insisting he is too ill to lead a normal life. When he does break free, he falls into the world of auto racing and discovers the thrills and also the dangerous, dark underbelly of the sport. And…he pursues a love interest in the film. Despite stilted acting, this film satisfies with non-stop action, an engaging plot, and awesome vintage race footage of Indy-style race cars from the period…all of which makes for a film well worth watching. IMDB: Roaring Roads\n\nThe Nut (1921) Douglas Fairbanks, Marguerite De La Motte, William Lowery, Barbara La Marr\n\nThis early romantic comedy features Douglas Fairbanks as an eccentric inventor who falls in love with a lady who opens her home to disadvantaged children, hoping their exposure to a better life will enhance theirs. His efforts to woo her with his fantastical inventions face major obstacles. This light-hearted fare entertains with an amusing plot and quality production values. The film merits watching. IMDB: The Nut\n\nSwiss Miss (1938) Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Grete Natzler, Walter Woolf King\n\nLaurel and Hardy fail at selling mouse traps until they meet a shop keeper who buys their business with phony money. They spend their money in a high-class hotel restaurant on an extravagant meal. When they can’t pay, they have to work off their debt in the hotel. At the hotel, Oliver falls in love with a beautiful opera star masquerading as a maid to make her husband jealous. Hilarious scene after scene make this well-crafted comedy one of Laurel and Hardy’s best. The entertainment value of this film make it Must-See viewing. IMDB: Swiss Miss\n\nGreen Eyes (1934) Shirley Grey, Charles Starrett, Claude Gillingwater\n\nDuring a masquerade party at a millionaire’s mansion, a guest discovers in a closet the body of the cantankerous old man. Before the murder, the old man had a heated argument with his young, female ward, and she flees the mansion with her boyfriend right after the murder. Of course, she’s the prime suspect. Despite awkward acting, this whodunnit entertains with continual plot twists and an interesting resolution. The film deserves a view. IMDB: Green Eyes\n\nHigh Gear (1933) James Murray, Joan Marsh, Jackie Searl\n\nEveryone considered outstanding race car driver, Mark ‘High Gear’ Sherrod, to win the big race.

His former driving partner, and best friend, loses his nerve and can’t drive anymore, but vows to take care of Sherrod’s son. The tension throughout the film, the racing sequences, and the romantic subplot make this film worth watching. IMDB: High Gear\n\nKiki (1931) Mary Pickford, Reginald Denny, Joseph Cawthorn, Margaret Livingston, Betty Grable\n\nKiki makes it into the chorus line of a musical review but manages with her antics to disrupt the show and upstage the star, the love interest of the producer. Despite his frustration with Kiki, the producer takes her home after the show for a sexual rendezvous. She refuses his advances but then realizes she loves him and won’t leave the apartment. She makes the producer’s and his lover’s life miserable. After an iconic career as a silent film star, Mary Pickford stars in this talkie as a kookie, over-the-top goofball. This unusual film delivers cringy moments, some cute mugging, a few laughs and a storyline that, if only out of curiosity, makes this film watchable. IMDB: Kiki\n\nThunder in the City (1937) Edward G. Robinson, Nigel Bruce, Constance Collier, Luli Deste, Ralph Richardson\n\nDan Armstrong uses bombastic displays and outlandish stunts to promote his company’s products. His bosses disapprove of his tactics and urge him to use more conservative tactics. He defends his success in selling products and quits rather than change. His bosses urge him to go to England to learn their conservative advertising approaches. He goes to England to attempt saving a failing company and win the hand of a young lady in pursuit of a wealthy husband. This film portrays Robinson not as the usual touch guy, but as a crafty salesman. The pace is slow, but the film provides enough entertainment value to make it watchable. IMDB: Thunder in the City\n\nThe Passionate Plumber (1932) Buster Keaton, Jimmy Durante, Polly Moran\n\nA young woman falls in love with a shameless womanizer and uses a hapless plumber as a fake lover to make her actual love interest jealous. Despite some cringy amateurish acting, this fast-paced romp provides complicated situations and the expected Keaton humor. The film entertains and deserves a view. IMDB: The Passionate Plumber\n\nMystery of the Wax Museum (1933) Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Glenda Farrell\n\nA colleague with a grudge attacks the artist and owner of a wax museum. The attack results in a fire and the total destruction of the beautiful, artistic treasures within the museum. The artist’s obsession with his sculpture of the alluring Maria Antoinette unhinges him. The artist survives the museum fire and many years later pursues a bizarre method of reproducing the artistic representations of glamorous women in his museum. The colorized version of this film provides enough tension and interest to make this a film well worth watching. IMDB: Mystery of the Wax Museum\n\nThe Wild Party (1929) Clara Bow, Fredric March, Marceline Day, Shirley O’Hara, Adrienne Dore, Joyce Compton, Jack Oakie\n\nOn her train ride to college, Stella mistakenly slips into the wrong sleeping berth. Turns out the occupant is her new professor. All the girls enroll in his class, and Stella shamelessly pursues him, including sitting in the front row of the class with her skirt hiked up. Says her professor, “Life to you is just one wild party. You have no aim. All you want is cheap sensation.” So many reasons make this film Must See viewing: Silent screen superstar Clara Bow shines in an early talkie, a glimpse of college life in the 20s, an irresistible storyline. IMDB: The Wild Party\n\nBlonde Captive (1931) Clifton Childs, Lowell Thomas, Paul Withington\n\nThis documentary features life among primitives in the South Pacific and Australia, ostensibly in search of a link to early man. When visiting the indigenous peoples of Australia, the documentarians come across a blonde child and his mother—a woman who had lived with the primitives for many years. Narrated by Lowell Thomas, this documentary may have been of interest in the early 30s, by modern audiences will most likely find it unremarkable. IMDB: Blonde Captive\n\nProtect Your Daughter (Reckless Decision) (1933) Adeline Hayden Coffin, Doris Eaton, Margaret Halstan\n\nA young daughter continually stays out late with her boyfriend, and her mother fears drinking and sex, while her unconcerned father believes in his ‘good girl.’ The story dwells on the young girl’s aunt, who grew up as the daughter of a strict minister. She eventually rebelled and left home to live with her boyfriend. This exploitation film, ala “Reefer Madness,” serves as a warning to parents to strictly oversee the behavior of their wild daughters. Other than curiosity about family values and teen behavior of the times, there exists no reason to view this film. IMDB: Protect Your Daughter\n\nJANUARY-FEBRUARY 2023 POST\n\nBees in Paradise (1944) Arthur Askey, Anne Shelton, Peter Graves\n\nBeautiful women populate a remote, tropical island with a queen and a bee-inspired society. The only men on the island are those trapped after shipwrecks or plane crashes. According to island law, men are used for breeding, but after two months of connubial bliss, they must die. This musical comedy comes off as corny (verging on the ridiculous), but it’s intriguing enough to watch. IMDB: Bees in Paradise\n\nBelow the Deadlline (1936) Cecilia Parker, Russell Hopton, Theodore von Eltz\n\nMolly works as a secretary for a diamond dealer and loves a local cop.

Although a bit slow-moving, this film entertains enough to interest viewers. IMDB: The Gallant Hours\n\nThe Gay Sisters (1942) Barbara Stanwyck, George Brent, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Donald Crisp, Gig Young, Gene Lockhart, Larry Simms\n\nThree wealthy, young sisters lose their mother when the Lusitania sinks and then lose their father in The Great War.

A local industrialist fights them in court over possession of their ancestral mansion, and one of the sister’s long-hidden scandals comes to light to potentially bankrupt them. This fascinating film with plot twists, suspense, romantic entanglements, and bitter interpersonal relationships garners a Must-See rating. IMDB: The Gay Sisters\n\nThe Ghost Train (1941) Arthur Askey, Richard Murdoch, Kathleen Harrison\n\nA group of train travelers gets dropped in the middle of a stormy night at a railway station. The station master wants to close up but nobody will leave. Travelers include a corny vaudeville comedian cracking jokes, a beautiful woman, gallant men, a crazy lady, and others. And, the ghost train eerily roars past the station in the middle of the night. Intended to be scary, this film, barely watchable, falls flat. IMDB: The Ghost Train\n\nGreen for Danger (1946) Alastair Sim, Sally Gray, Trevor Howard\n\nIn an hospital operating theater the patient dies and many suspect the doctor of murder. When someone murders a nurse and another nurse nearly dies, the inspector works to solve the murders.

Crack publicist, Jo Allen, goes to work for the competing exhibition, masquerades her identity, and pulls a major contract out from under her competitor. Problem is…she’s fallen in love with him. This musical comedy features competent acting, an interesting story, and a strong concluding production number. Corny humor and lame songs (with characters singing their dialogue at times) weaken this film, but viewers will find it worth watching. IMDB: Hats Off\n\nGirl O’ My Dreams (1934) Mary Carlisle, Sterling Holloway, Edward J. Nugent, Arthur Lake, Lon Chaney Jr.\n\nCollege romance and sports headline this film. Big Man on Campus and track star brags continually, and his girl chases another athlete to make him jealous. Misunderstandings, humor, and beautiful girls galore.

IMDB: Love Story\n\nMeet the Boyfriend (1937) Robert Paige, Carol Hughes, Warren Hymer Women continually besiege popular radio singer, ‘The Boyfriend.’ All he wants in life is to be a regular guy—not a celebrity. He falls in love with a regular girl, but doesn’t realize she works for an insurance company that sold his manager a policy to insure that he doesn’t get married. This breezy comedy entertains with its fast pace, action, suspense, stellar acting, and even some musical bits to make it a worthwhile viewing experience.

This tense film-noir focuses on “will they escape/with they die?” Great acting and continual suspense make this film worth watching. IMDB: Hitch-HIker\n\nIllicit (1931) Barbara Stanwyck, James Rennie, Ricardo Cortez\n\nAnn and Richard savor a fun-filled, loving relationship until Richard wants to marry. Ann balks because she knows too many unhappy married and divorced women. She wants to continue as an ‘illicit’ couple. Eventually Richard forces the issue and Ann agrees to marriage. During their marriage, Ann’s fears come true and both are pursued by rival lovers. Barbara Stanwyck shines in an early role, and the back-and-forths in her relationship with her true love keep viewers in suspense throughout. The superb acting and engaging plot make this film well worth watching. IMDB: Illicit\n\nLady Behave! (1937) Sally Eilers, Neil Hamilton, Joseph Schildkraut\n\nPaula watches over her younger sister, Clarice, in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. Worrying, Paula sends her sister into the Mardi Gras night, only to have her come home early in the morning, drunk, kissing a stranger, and married—even though she already has a husband back in New York. Paula poses as her sister to straighten out her new marriage to a millionaire with two bratty teenagers. This uneven farce features sketchy acting, a complicated plot, but, ultimately, an amusing viewing experience. It’s worth watching. IMDB: Lady Behave!\n\nMr. Moto in Danger Island (1939) Peter Lorre, Jean Hersholt, Amanda Duff, Willie Best, Ward Bond, Leon Ames, Paul Harvey\n\nMr. Moto travels to Puerto Rico to solve a string of murders related to diamond smuggling. He pairs up with a wrestler and represents himself as a criminal in order to infiltrate the smuggling ring. If you’re a Mr. Moto fan, you’ll enjoy this typical who-dun-it. Otherwise, the film is entertaining enough to be watchable. IMDB: Mr. Moto in Danger Island\n\nMrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch (1934) Pauline Lord, W.C. Fields, Zasu Pitts\n\nMrs. Wiggs struggles through life with poverty, a house full of children, a deathly sick child, the local Child Welfare Society, and an absent husband.

She also sorts out the advances of two men in serious pursuit of her. There are a few so-so songs and dance numbers in this film, but Anna Neagle as Nanette outshines everyone and everything in this film. Just watching a performance by this star makes this film worth watching. IMDB: No, No Nannette\n\nOdd Man Out (1947) James Mason, Robert Newton, Cyril Cusack, Fay Compton\n\nFour men rob a bank, but while running to the getaway car, Johnny’s tackled by a man with a gun.

The film follows Johnny as he struggles to live with the help of those he encounters. A young girl who loves him becomes desperate to find him and help him. This film moves slowly, the British accents and low-volume dialogue at times, make it difficult to clearly hear the dialogue. Well-acted, and dramatic, viewers will find this film worth watching. IMDB: Odd Man Out\n\nOn the Spot (1940) Frankie Darro, Mary Kornman, Mantan Moreland\n\nFrankie works behind the counter at the drug store/soda fountain. A gangster walks in who’s been shot. He falls to the floor and dies. Other gangsters and the press hound Frankie to reveal the dead gangster’s final words. Frankie works to solve the murder and that of another shot while in the store. Frankie Darro stars in this film and comes off as over-energetic, bragging and obnoxious. The sweetheart of the Our Gang comedies, Mary Kornman, takes top billing in this film, but actually plays only a supporting role in this, the last film of her career. The film turns out to be watchable. IMDB: On the Spot\n\nA Stranger in Town (1943) Frank Morgan, Richard Carlson, Jean Rogers, Chill Wills Supreme Court justice Grant takes a hunting vacation in a small town, where he finds the local officials conspiratorially corrupt.

His pathologically jealous mother does everything possible to prevent the marriage…and succeeds. This film keeps viewers highly engaged in the story and absorbed as well in Barbara Stanwyck’s tough but sensuous performance. Most of Stanwyck’s films entertain, and this one deserves a Must-See rating.

IMDB: Secret of Dr. Kildaire\n\nThe Private Life of Henry VIII (1933) Charles Laughton, Robert Donat, Franklin Dyall, Merle Oberon, Elsa Lanchester, Binnie Barnes\n\nHighlighted in this film are beheadings, palace intrigue, and infidelity in the life of Henry VIII. Despite top-notch acting and directing and the contemporaneous popularity of this film, modern films addressing the reign of Henry VIII more accurately represent historical aspects of Henry VIII’s life and provide a higher level of entertainment. IMDB: The Private Life of Henry VIII\n\nRain (1932) Joan Crawford, Walter Huston, Fred Howard, Guy Kibbee, Beulah Bondi\n\nThe sailors’ best friend, Sadie Thompson, infuriates the Christians on a South Seas island with her immorality. A stern missionary takes it upon himself to reform her, and insists she return to San Francisco, where she faces prison time.

She marries a sailor who dies in battle and leaves her pregnant, and she then struggles with single motherhood. Her life only gets more complicated. Although acting is uneven, the engaging story and increasing conflicts make this drama well worth watching. IMDB: That Brennan Girl\n\nThat’s My Baby (1944) Richard Arlen, Ellen Drew, Leonid Kinskey\n\nGrumpy comic book executive, R. P. Moody, hasn’t smiled or laughed in twenty years, and his doctor and psychiatrist feel his ill health results from melancholy. His daughter tries to fix his health by parading a number of musical, novelty, and comedy acts before him. This film showcases a number of vaudeville acts within a thinly-plotted format. Although some of the performers display talent, most (particularly the dated comedy and novelty acts) make one want to bail on this film. (I watched it so you wouldn’t have to.) IMDB: That’s My Baby\n\nFire Over England (1937) Laurence Olivier, Flora Robson, Vivien Leigh, Raymond Massey\n\nThis British historical drama, set in the late 16th century, tells the story of England’s fight against the Spanish Armada. The film features first-rate acting, and boasts impressive sets and costumes. The film is notable for its attention to historical detail and its engaging story, which blends political intrigue and romance. Although a classic example of 1930s British filmmaking, modern viewers might find this movie too dated to appreciate. IMDB: Fire Over England\n\nSex Madness! (1938-but most likely early 30s) Vivian McGill, Rose Tapley, Al Rigali\n\nSpoiler Alert! This film deals with young people having casual sex.

She contracts syphilis, sees a quack and thinks she’s cured. She marries her fiancé, gives him and her newborn baby syphilis. The husband goes blind, the baby dies, and she considers suicide. Everything about this film reeks ‘yuck’—horrible production values, amateur actors (some even flubbing their lines), and hysterical propaganda. The only reason to watch this film is out of curiosity or historical interest. Otherwise, don’t waste your time. IMDB: Sex Madness!\n\nThe Villain Still Pursued Her (1940) Hugh Herbert, Anita Louise, Alan Mowbray, Buster Keaton, Joyce Compton, Billy Gilbert, Margaret Hamilton\n\nWhen their landlord dies, a widow and her daughter learn from the lawyer of the landlord’s son, Edward, that he plans to foreclose on their property and take possession. Mary meets with Edward and eventually plans to marry him, but the unscrupulous lawyer has further schemes up his sleeve. This film parodies the silent melodramas—poorly. Although the film features several talented stars, the over-the-top acting makes the film difficult to watch. Avoid this one. IMDB: The Villain Still Pursued Her\n\nDecision Before Dawn (1951) Richard Basehart, Gary Merrill, Oskar Werner Allied commanders recruit Nazi POWs to spy behind German lines to determine the locations of Panzer units. The results are tense and mixed. This classic war drama provides the typical conversations interspersed with action and presents a realistic view of the dilemmas faced by soldiers.

Eisenhower, Leslie Banks (Voice), Winston Churchill (Archive Footage)\n\nThis official government documentary begins with an introduction by General Dwight D. Eisenhower and features a narration over World War II videos shot by hundreds of cameramen from Allied nations during the war.

This film spends significant time devoted to onshore relationships, but once the mission gets underway, the battle action makes the film worth watching.

A beautiful stand-in helps Atterbury understand the workings of the studio system and quickly realizes he’s ‘a human adding machine,’ only concerned with numbers and dollars with no regard for the people involved in the studio. Joan Blondell lights up the screen and carries this light-hearted comedy. Viewers will find this film highly entertaining and well worth watching. IMDB: Stand-In\n\nThree Husbands (1950) Eve Arden, Ruth Warrick, Vanessa Brown, Howard Da Silva, Billie Burke\n\nWhen a wealthy playboy, Maxwell Bard, dies, three of his friends receive letters from him indicating he had affairs with each of their wives. All of the wives had been flirty with Maxwell, and the husbands now question their relationships with their wives. The concept of this film seemed promising, but the film falls flat. Viewers will find the film mildly entertaining. IMDB: Three Husbands\n\nThe Way Ahead (1944) David Niven, Stanley Holloway, James Donald\n\nCraggy, bearded old veterans carp about the softness of the current Army recruits. Basic training recruits do whine and complain as this film follows them through preparation for battle in WWII. This film deals mostly with the training of new recruits and their relationships with their commanding officer. Infrequent battle scenes are inconsequential. Look elsewhere for entertaining war films. IMDB: The Way Ahead\n\nOCTOBER-DECMBER 2022 POST\n\nFeet First (1930) Harold Lloyd, Barbara Kent, Robert McWade, Willie Best\n\nHarold works as a salesman in a shoe store and falls for a beautiful girl he assumes is the daughter of the president of the company. When she takes an ocean cruise with the president and his wife, he boards the ship to wish her bon voyage. The ship sails before he can get off, so he cruises as a stowaway. This talkie gets off to a slow start and doesn’t reach the entertaining heights of Lloyd’s best. It contains, however, a long, harrowing scene of Harold in danger on the outside of a skyscraper that will make viewers squirm in their seats. The suspense, humor and entertaining interactions make this film worth a view.\n\nIMDB: Feet First\n\nSpeedy (1928) Harold Lloyd, Ann Christy, Bert Woodruff, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig\n\nPop runs the last horse-drawn trolley in New York, but a businessman wanting to eliminate competition tries everything for force him out of business.

They move into the mansion, but the uncle living there devises a scheme to scare them away.\n\nDuring the filming of this movie a bomb explosion nearly kills Lloyd and severely injures his hand, forcing him to use a prosthetic hand thereafter. A four-month break in production ensued. Viewers see Harold with his actual hand at the beginning of the film and later with his prosthetic hand in this production. Harold Lloyd fans and silent film fans should see this film. IMDB: Haunted Spooks\n\nHot Water (1924) Harold Lloyd, Jobyna Ralston, Josephine Crowell\n\nHarold finds bliss in marriage until his domineering mother-in-law, shiftless brother-in-law, and unruly nephew move in. Harold undergoes disaster after disaster in this laugh-filled comedy. In one of Harold’s best comedies, the action never stops and the amazing bits pay off. Viewers can’t take their eyes off the screen for fear of missing another riotous moment. Don’t miss the brilliant Harold Lloyd in this must-see film. IMDB: Hot Water\n\nMovie Crazy (1932) Harold Lloyd, Constance Cummings, Kenneth Thomson\n\nObsessed movie fan, Harold, sends a letter to a Hollywood producer seeking an audition. He includes a headshot, but mistakenly encloses a photo of a male model. He gets his audition, fails miserably, and finds colleagues in the movies ridiculing him behind his back. A top Hollywood actress, in particular, toys with him, while also feeling sorry for him. This comedy offers Lloyd’s signature gags, missteps, and blunders, and entertains enough to deserve a view. IMDB: Movie Crazy\n\nThe Sin of Harold Diddlebock (1947) Harold Lloyd, Frances Ramsden, Jimmy Conlin, Rudy Vallee, Edgar Kennedy, Franklin Pangborn, Lionel Stander, Margaret Hamilton\n\nAt the big, college football game the coach puts in water boy Harold when there are no players left due to injury. Harold wins the game and becomes a hero. A wealthy fan calls Harold to his office, impressed by his ‘get up and go’ spirit, and offers him a job.

In addition to his dismissal, Harold bemoans his failed romances. Despite his cluelessness, luck smiles on Harold. This light-weight comedy offers mediocre acting, an awkward romantic pairing, and a lack of the hallmark genius from Lloyd’s classic silents. If you’re a Lloyd completist, see this film. If not, you won’t miss much. IMDB: The Sin of Harold Diddlebock\n\nGod’s Gift to Women (1931) Frank Fay, Laura La Plante, Joan Blondell, Louise Brooks, Charles Winninger, Alan Mowbray\n\nWomen fall over themselves to be with playboy, Toto Duryea.

During the campaign Gildersleeve sees a gorilla on the loose and a ghost in a haunted mansion. His claims label him as a looney and damages his political campaign. Although pleasant enough to watch, this installment in the Gildersleeve features series doesn’t have the impact of the other features. More fantastical and fewer laughs make this film worth watching but some may consider it a waste of time. IMDB: Gildersleeve’s Ghost\n\nCollege Holiday (1936) Jack Benny, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Martha Raye, Ben Blue, College students travel to a hotel in distress to perform and, possibly, save the hotel. They get paired off in a bizarre eugenics experiment, however, and have to be closely supervised to keep them from continually necking. Although one or two cute song and dance numbers work in this film, the “humor” in this musical comedy fails. Lame and corny bits abound. The major production number turns out to be a minstrel show with most performers in blackface. Don’t waste your time with this dud. IMDB: College Holiday\n\nStella Dallas (1925) Ronald Colman, Belle Bennett, Alice Joyce, Douglas Fairbanks Jr.\n\nImpoverished Stella uses her youthful beauty to attract a wealthy lawyer.

He also dates one of his students—the girlfriend of the star quarterback. Her protective brother, Barney Shirrel, goes to the same college to play football, join a fraternity, and find a girlfriend.
