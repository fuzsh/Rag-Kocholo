        "text": "The Charlie Chan series is a collection of six mystery novels by American author Earl Derr Biggers. The series features the fictional character of Charlie Chan, a Chinese-American detective in the Honolulu Police Department.\n\nThe character of Charlie Chan was created as an alternative to the Yellow Peril stereotypes that were common in media during the early 20th century. Biggers conceived of Chan as an intelligent, heroic, benevolent, and honorable character.\n\nThe series became immensely popular and was adapted into over four dozen films, beginning in 1926. The character of Charlie Chan also appeared in several radio programs, two television shows, and comics.\n\nThe series is known for its engaging mysteries and its respectful portrayal of Chinese and Chinese-American characters. Itâ€™s worth noting that the character of Charlie Chan was loosely based on the real-life Hawaiian detective Chang Apana.\n\nCharlie Chan Series in Order:"
