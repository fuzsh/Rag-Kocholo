Attorney Sezgin Tanrıkulu and attorney Nesip Yıldırım were the representatives of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey in the Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. In 2007 they published a calendar in Turkish and Kurdish. Since then they have been in trouble with the law. The Attorney General filed a claim of “abusing their position” for publishing the calendar in Kurdish. This case came long after Turkey passed laws “allowing” the Kurdish people (more than 1/3 of Turkey’s citizens have Kurdish origins) to speak their native tongue to please the Europeans.

In the latest court session finally the Diyarbakir criminal court decided that publishing a calendar in Kurdish language did not violate any laws and did not constituted a crime.
