        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nPrison population is one of the groups posing a risk for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because most prisoners suffer from chronic diseases caused by adverse health conditions. Relatively high incidences of diseases, such as hypertension, asthma, cancer, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in convicts and detainees puts them at a disadvantage for COVID-19. Furthermore, the fact that 11% of the prison population is 55 years or older because of harsh punishment policies, increases the risk of being infected with COVID-19 [1]. Since 1993, the incarceration rate of the population aged over 55 years has increased by 400% [2]."
