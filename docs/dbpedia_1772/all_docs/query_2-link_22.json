        "text": "On May 25, 2021, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) issued a final judgment in Big Brother Watch and Others v. United Kingdom (BBW). The decision is the first Grand Chamber ruling on bulk interception in the post-Snowden era and charts the path forward for the use of tools and techniques of mass surveillance for national security purposes by Council of Europe member states. The decision was issued alongside a parallel ruling in Centrum för rättvisa v. Sweden (CFR). While CFR is “very much the companion case to BBW,” an analysis of it is outside the scope of this note. Suffice to say that, combined, both cases reaffirm the Court's position that the operation of foreign bulk interception regimes does not ipso facto violate the Convention, as such operations may be necessary in the investigation of national security threats and serious crime, including in the context of global terrorism, cyber-attacks, counter-espionage, election interferences, drug trafficking, and child pornography. In a rather complex and lengthy judgment, the Court elaborated on a procedural framework that incorporates “end-to-end safeguards” and is aimed at preventing power from being abused in the operation of these tools.\n\n1 The judgment followed three applications that were combined: Big Brother Watch and Others v. UK, App. No. 58170/13, Bureau of Investigative Journalism & Alice Ross v. UK, App. No. 62322/14, and 10 Human Rights Organizations and Others v. UK, App. No. 24960/15. The Chamber decision was issued on September 13, 2018, the referral to the Grand Chamber was made on February 4, 2019, and as noted above the Grand Chamber made its decision on May 25, 2021 [hereinafter the Chamber's decision will be referred to as BBW, 2018; whereas the Grand Chamber's decision will be referred to as BBW, 2021].\n\n6 For a discussion of the TEMPORA program see BBW, Id., ¶¶ 15–19; The ECtHR notes that each bulk interception program may be different, but nonetheless identifies four primary stages in the interception process: “(a) the interception and initial retention of communications and related communications data (that is, the traffic data belonging to the intercepted communications); (b) the application of specific selectors to the retained communications/related communications data; (c) the examination of selected communications/related communications data by analysts; and (d) the subsequent retention of data and use of the “final product”, including the sharing of data with third parties.” See BBW 2021, ¶ 325."
