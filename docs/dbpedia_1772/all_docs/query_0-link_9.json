The campaign has been launched to threaten and silence those who speak out against Human Rights violations.\n\n\n\nOne of the names targeted by Turkish nationalists and racists is Mr. Sezgin Tanrikulu, who has become  the voice of people threatened unfairly in Turkey and abroad. The threat started when he was the president of Diyarbakır Bar Association and even after he was selected as a member of parliament. Tanrikulu won many juricial cases initiated by himself against Turkish government in international arenas, and was deemed worthy of the Kennedy award. One of those cases was his statement about 15 villagers who were thrown down out of helicopter by Turkish military. The case was even confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in 1990’s.\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, Tanrikulu is openly targeted by many racist parties and even the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Those unjustified attacks bring to mind the case of the Kurdish lawyer and president of the Diyarbakir Bar Association, Mr. Tahir Elçi, who was murdered by Turkish paramilitary forces in 2015.\n\n\n\nWe strongly condemn these attacks and invite the international community to stand against the racism that is increasing day by day in Turkey, and to protect Sezgin Tanrıkulu and other human rights activists.\n\n\n\nRacism is a crime against humanity and should be strongly condemned by all means.\n\n\n\nKurdish Diaspora Confederation11th, September 2023",
