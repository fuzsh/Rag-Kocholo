On January 10 of this year, a group of scholars known as the Academics for Peace signed an open letter asking the Turkish government to end its violence in the Kurdish provinces. The next day, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused the signatories of treason and called for their punishment. The Turkish judiciary system initiated public prosecutions under Turkish antiterror laws, alleging defamation of the Turkish state and accusing signatories of spreading “terrorist organization propaganda.” Turkey’s Higher Education Council (YÖK) ordered university rectors to commence disciplinary investigations. Numerous suspensions, dismissals, and imprisonments followed.\n\nEndangered Scholars Worldwide is deeply concerned about the detention of and professional retaliation against academics and human rights activists in Turkey in response to their exercise of the rights to academic freedom, free expression, and free association, conduct that is expressly protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both to of which Turkey is party. The ongoing tensions in Turkey have a profoundly destructive effect on academic freedom and represent a grave threat to higher education on a national scale.\n\nWe at Endangered Scholars Worldwide urge Turkish officials to honor their constitutional obligations to protect the institutional integrity of universities and the academic freedom of scholars and academics.\n\nEndangered Scholars Worldwide calls on the United Nations General Assembly and member governments to put pressure on the Turkish government and express concern over the actions taken by officials against universities and higher education establishments.\n\nPlease join The New School, home of the original University in Exile and Endangered Scholars Worldwide, in calling on Turkish authorities to\n\ncease their attacks on Turkish academics and universities;\n\nfree those who have been arrested without cause;\n\nallow those who wish to travel freely outside the country to do so; and\n\nmake Turkish universities once again the havens of freedom of inquiry and free expression that all great universities must be.\n\nESW Stands With Academics For Peace in Turkey: Urgent Call for Solidarity\n\nMembers of the Academics for Peace and Education and Science Workers Union (Eğitim-SEN) have been removed from their positions in public higher education institutions permanently.\n\nIn January 2016 2,218 scholars from Turkey signed a petition titled “We will not be a party to this crime,” also known as the Peace Petition. Since, the signatories have been subject to heavy pressure and persecution. Hundreds of them have faced criminal and disciplinary investigations, custody, imprisonment, and violent threats. Several academics have been dismissed or suspended while some were forced to resign or leave the country.\n\nTurkey experienced a failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016, and the Turkish government holds the religious group led by the US resident cleric Fethullah Gülen responsible. After this event, government and university administrations have continued targeting the Academics for Peace with the pretext of purging Gülen-affiliated individuals from public service.\n\nThe latest mass purge came late at night on September 1, 2016 via a cabinet decree within the context of the state of emergency rule. More than 41 Peace Petition signatories were deemed “supporters of terrorism” and banned from public service, alongside more than 40,000 public service employees. Note that many of the signatories have already been under administrative investigations for signing the Peace Petition, without a conclusion. The dismissal of the signatories overnight with a fait accompli of a State of Emergency decree is a serious violation of their basic human right to fair trial and due process. Dismissed under the conditions of state of emergency, they will neither be able to appeal the decision nor work in public sector for a lifetime; their passports will also be revoked.\n\nThis latest attempt to purge the Academics for Peace by linking them to coup plotters is outrageous and unacceptable. The government of Turkey is taking advantage of the state of emergency rule to crack down on all critical voices, including those who have no relation to the Gülen organization or the coup attempt. We demand that our colleagues get reinstated to their positions and have their employee rights fully restored.\n\nPlease share our call for solidarity with those in your networks. Ask your college, university, professional organization, or union to publish a statement in support of the Peace Academics and send it to government and university officials in Turkey.\n\nHis Excellency Recep Tayyip Erdoğan\n\nPresident of Turkey\n\nOffice of the President\n\n06573 Basbakanlik\n\nAnkara\n\nTurkey\n\nFax: +90 312 417 04 76\n\nHis Excellency Bekir Bozdağ\n\nMinister of Justice\n\n06669 Kizilay\n\nAnkara\n\nTurkey\n\nFax: +90 312 419 3370"
