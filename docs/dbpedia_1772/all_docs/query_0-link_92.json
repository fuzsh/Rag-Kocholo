        "text": "Head of Diyarbakır Bar Association and human rights lawyer Tahir Elçi is commemorated on the day of his killing in Sur district of Diyarbakır, as well as, in other major cities of Turkey.\n\nDue to ongoing curfew in the town where he was killed last year today, people gathered at a nearby square to hold their ceremony.\n\nElçi’s wife Türkan Elçi, members of Diyarbakır Bar Association, CHP MP Sezgin Tanrıkulu, and HDP MPs Meral Danış Beştaş and Ahmet Yıldırım, along with civil society groups, held the ceremony in Diyarbakır.\n\nReminding that Elçi shed light into several unsolved murder cases of 90’s, Diyarbakır Bar Association Head Ahmet Özmen said: “Murder of Tahir Elçi is still unsolved. The society owes him this. This case must be solved immediately.”\n\nHaving talked to Enver Aysever from RS FM before the ceremony, Elçi’s wife Türkan Elçi said, “Those who do not want peace in Turkey shot Tahir Elçi”, adding: “While I should be able to commemorate my husband in peace, I feel worried about whether something will happen to people there (during the ceremony). I have been waiting for the indictment but there is no witness and no indictment. Isn’t there even one person to stand as the witness? We live in such a chaotic period that if a bomb is exploded even the counterterrorism experts cannot comment on it. Why wouldn’t the State be after the murderer?"
