Other minorities or groups are not coded, the official told daily Radikal.\n\nWhile there was no immediate official response to the report, opposition parties’ lawmakers harshly criticized the alleged document.\n\n“If this is true, it is fatal. It must be examined. I will bring this onto Parliament’s agenda,” Sezgin Tanrikulu, deputy head of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) said."
