Ayse has professionally sought solutions for human rights problems through studying freedom of expression and issues related to women, children and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nAyse has also participated in serveral human rights projects as a researcher in the Ankara Strategy Institute (ASI), with duties including writing analyses about new law drafts that the Turkish Parliament had been discussing on human rights, criminal law, trademark law and internet law.\n\nAfter ASI, Ayse started working as a Global Policy & Strategy as the coordinator and negotiator for project partners and the editor of the legal issues department at the same time. Policymakers and political parties used Ayse’s analyses and reports about human rights abuses. Parliament member Sezgin Tanrikulu even offered Ayse’s proposal about punishment for feminicide as a law draft to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, making Ayse one of the youngest people whose study was used as a law draft in Turkey."
