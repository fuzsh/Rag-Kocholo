        "text": "ANKARA, Turkey Oct. 18 - In Judge Dursun Genel's snug little courtroom, the feuding couples shuttle in and out with stories of exhausted dreams and unhappy marriages.\n\n\"We'll never have peace,\" a young woman recently told the judge, agreeing with her estranged husband that the only solution to their problems was divorce.\n\n\"But who will look after you?\" Judge Genel asked. \"Under the law, you know, you have the right to make a financial claim,\" he added.\n\n\"I don't want anything from him,\" the woman responded. \"I just want you to make sure he doesn't threaten me anymore.\"\n\nSo it goes in Turkey's newly established family courts where women now have equal rights in marriage, and courts are obligated to put restraining orders on bullying spouses.\n\nFamily courts are just one product of the sweeping changes that have both transformed and swamped Turkey's legal system. An avalanche of new laws, geared to bring the nation closer to European Union norms, has altered the way the state treats everything from police brutality and juvenile delinquents, to commercial transactions and industrial pollution.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
