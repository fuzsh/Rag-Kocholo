        "text": "A Turkish criminal court Friday convicted and handed prison sentences to six journalists and another staffer from nationalist newspaper Sozcu following charges they supported a U.S.-based cleric whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses of masterminding a failed 2016 coup against him.\n\nThe Istanbul Court of Justice sentenced the journalists, including veteran columnist Emin Colasan, to prison terms ranging from two to 3½ years for backing what state media called the FETO secretive religious brotherhood. FETO is the Fethulah Gulen Organization, named after the cleric who denies involvement in the coup attempt. He lives in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The Turkish government considers the organization a terrorist group.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Sozcu attorney Celal Ulgen said all the defendants had rejected the charges, which he described as politically motivated.\n\n\"The judges are afraid of their own future and their children's future,\" he said. \"They want to throw the ball to the next court by condemning them for fear. … The judiciary is not independent in Turkey.\"\n\nAccording to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency, columnist Necati Dogru was sentenced to 3½ years in prison, as was Colasan, while Sozcu’s chief editor Metin Yilmaz and its online edition's managing editor, Mustafa Cetin, each received a sentence of just over three years. Online news editor Yucel Ari, reporter Gokmen Ulu and financial manager Yonca Yucelan were each sentenced to prison terms of two years and one month.\n\nThe court acquitted former Sozcu news director Mediha Olgun, who was first detained in May 2017 and held for 120 days.\n\nA case against the paper's owner, Burak Akbay, who is living abroad and being tried in absentia, is to continue separately, Anadolu reported.\n\nOngoing crackdown\n\nSozcu has long been known for its critical coverage of Erdogan's ruling party. It is the second opposition daily to be targeted after Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper saw 13 of its reporters convicted in 2018.\n\nSometimes described as vehemently anti-government, Sozcu's staff are the latest in a long line of reporters, pundits, scholars and activists to stand accused of supporting Gulen, a onetime Erdogan ally-turned-political nemesis.\n\nErdogan and his supporters blame Gulen for the attempted coup and have long pressed U.S. officials for his extradition.\n\nUlgen says Sozcu denies any links with the Gulen network, and officials representing the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, say the paper is being singled out for refusing to be a mouthpiece for Ankara.\n\n\"When the court started this case, we assumed there would be a conviction,\" said Sezgin Tanrıkulu, a Turkish human rights lawyer and CHP parliamentarian, largely echoing the opinion of most defendants. \"We foresaw this punishment.\"\n\n\"It is an empty case against us. There are no documents or witnesses against us,\" columnist Colasan said. \"I want my acquittal without further ado.\""
