        "text": "Click here to read the article in Turkish / Haberin Türkçesi için buraya tıklayın.\n\nRepublican People’s Party (CHP) Vice Chair and İstanbul MP Sezgin Tanrıkulu has held a press conference at the parliament regarding the application to the European Court of Human rights (ECtHR) with regards to the curfews in Turkey.\n\nTanrıkulu has noted that since August 16 when curfew has been imposed, 151 civilians had lost their lives. He has compared the current situation with the process initiated by lifting the peace process and electing the new president in 2006 in Sri Lanka.\n\n“This constitutes a desperate picture of human rights. The only way out is to start with a new white page”, Tanrıkulu has added.\n\nECtHR expects an answer from Turkey\n\nAttorney Neşet Girasun from Diyarbakır Bar Association and Attorney Erkan Şenses from Batman Bar Association had made an application to the ECtHR to lift the curfew in Cizre district of Şırnak province and demanded an interim measure either to call off the security operations or to perform them in compliance with international standards.\n\nRegistering the application to be evaluated on the petition’s date of filing, and making a defence request, ECtHR has addressed Turkey three questions.\n\nCommentating on the questions, Tanrıkulu has noted that he assumed, ECtHR would convict Turkey on the grounds of the motives he has announced. He has forwarded the same questions to the Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu.\n\n“No legal grounds”\n\n* What is the legal basis for curfews?\n\n“The curfews do not have any legal grounds. And the legal grounds demonstrated lacks every reference. Also the Internal Security Law does not include such authorization.\n\n“Curfews are regulated in two legislations; in state of emergency (OHAL) and state of siege. Hence without any legal basis, curfews have been and are still being imposed in 17 districts in Turkey for 56 times, for a period of over 300 days.\n\n“Curfews are in effect in Cizre and Silopi since December 14 and in Sur since December 2. the curfew has been in effect for over 300 days in a district in Turkey which has no grounds according to our constitution”.\n\n“Fundamental needs can not be met”\n\n* Can basic needs be met under curfew?\n\n“No basic needs are met. People can not make use of basic nutrition services, hospitals and that schools are transformed into headquarters of security forces. People can only go on the street with white flags some of which unfortunately have been targets of sharp shooters. Hence there is a sour picture of severe human rights violations and ECtHR will judge within this scope.\n\n“Only military measures”\n\n* Which measures have been taken to protect the right of those to life who have been residing in the regions under curfew?\n\n“No measure has been taken. And the Turkish Judicial System has failed with this regards. Yet there are some measures taken yet only regarding military. To the question of why no measures are being taken, the government shows reasons such as the ditches and barricades as justification and thus equalizes itself with the terrorist organization which imposing acts of terror and violence. There is also this such false method.\n\n“We have not experienced any environment where a woman has been killed by a rocket launcher or cannon ball while having breakfast with her children behind protected walls. Yesterday we had faced such a scene unfortunately. There is such a sore picture. I really wonder, what can Davutoğlu and Erdoğan say before this human scene?”. (BK/DG)"
