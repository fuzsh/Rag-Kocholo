        "text": "Ebru Timtik, a lawyer of the People's Law Bureau (HHB), died in the hospital where she was forcibly held after being transferred there from prison while on death fast demanding a fair trial.\n\nTimtik's body, after the autopsy, will be delivered to her family tomorrow. CHP deputies Sezgin Tanrıkulu, Hilmi Yarayıcı were among those waiting in front of the Forensic Medicine Institute in Istanbul.\n\nTanrıkulu, who met with the deputy head of ATK and the deputy chief of Istanbul Police, stated that Timtik's body will be delivered to her family at 10.\n\nMaking a statement in front of the ATK after the meeting, Tanrıkulu said last night: “Death by hunger strike and death fast resistance are something that shake people's conscience. Unfortunately, there are people responsible for this process. First of all, there is the political and judicial board. We could have created a fair trial before our friend died, but it did not happen. According to the information I received from the family, Timtik will be buried next to her mother on Saturday at 1 pm as she requested. Her sister, Barkın Timtik, is still in Silivri Prison, her relatives are in Dersim. Therefore, time is needed for the relatives to come, and with the change made in the execution law, their relatives need a permit to attend the funeral. Lawyers will initiate those procedures.\"\n\nÖHD lawyer Sinan Zincir said: \"We lost our sister Ebru, our comrade, on the 238th day of her death fast resistance.\" Zincir added that Timtik was a martyr of the democracy and revolutionary struggle in these lands. “It is our oath, we have said everywhere that we will continue to speak out, we will protect their memories. We will definitely establish that beautiful country that Ebru has longed for in these lands.\"\n\nProviding information about the funeral, Zincir said that after the autopsy today, a commemoration ceremony will be held in front of the Istanbul Bar Association at around 10. Stating that Timtik will be buried in Gazi on Saturday, Zincir added: \"Ebru's will is to be bid farewell in Gazi Cemevi and buried in Gazi Cemetery where her mother is buried. Ebru will embrace her mother and revolutionary martyrs there. We will try to get a permission so that her jailed sister Barkın and her aunt could come to the funeral. After the funeral, we will send our Ebru sister off to eternity. You killed our Ebru, you broke the hearts of people like flowers, your gardens involved in this process will not see spring.\""
