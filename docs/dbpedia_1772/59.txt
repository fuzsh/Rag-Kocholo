STATEMENT FOR PRESS AND GENERAL PUBLIC

Sezgin Tanrıkulu is not alone!

September 11, 2023

We know Sezgin Tanrıkulu, MP for Diyarbakır, as a human rights defender, lawyer, and civil society representative. As civil society organizations, we consider his being an MP with these qualities and some of the work he did during his time as an MP as the work of a “human rights defender” and we think that it is beneficial to continue this work.

In a TV program in which he participated by phone, he made some statements by citing the ECHR judgment as a basis while responding to the allegations put forward by the person present in the program, and these statements were contradictory to the general political attitudes and statements of the state and were denounced by some participants of the program.

In response, it was reported in the media that an investigation had been launched against Mr. Sezgin Tanrıkulu, a member of parliament, and in response to these developments, he was attacked on social media in what can be described as a lynching.

The fact that “freedom of expression”, which is one of the most fundamental rights for every human being, is not accepted even for a member of parliament is a cause of sadness for our country. These attacks, which include insults and threats, bring to mind other attacks in our country in the past that have produced very grave and painful results and cause us deep concern.

On this occasion, we inform the public that it is an obligation to respect all rights of Sezgin Tanrıkulu, especially freedom of expression, and we remind all public institutions to take the necessary measures to prevent these attacks.
