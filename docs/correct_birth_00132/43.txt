Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith have covered the Hollywood beat for decades -- Elvis and "Easy Rider" through the Jonas Brothers and "Avatar," and all the stars and their triumphs and scandals in between. Their Creators Syndicate column, Beck/Smith Hollywood Exclusive, is a source of top celebrity interviews, entertainment industry news and opinion.

Marilyn Beck rose to fame as the show business reporter who changed entertainment coverage from frothy social notes to wide-ranging news -- often moving stories off the entertainment page and onto the front page. She has authored books including "Marilyn Beck's Hollywood," been featured on television in her own NBC specials, as a regular part of the nationally syndicated "PM Magazine," and, for nearly seven years, on the E! Entertainment channel. Beck has won numerous awards, including honors from the Los Angeles City Council, the Southern California Motion Picture Council and the ICG Publicists Guild of America. She is listed in Who's Who in America, Who's Who of American Women and Who's Who in Entertainment. Born in Chicago and raised in Los Angeles, Beck studied journalism at the University of Southern California and spent most of her adult years in Beverly Hills, Calif. Beck, who is married to former mediator Arthur Levine, raised two children while establishing her career in Hollywood. Her daughter, Andee, resides in St. Louis with her husband and children. Her son, Mark, is a Los Angeles attorney who lives in Pasadena with his family. Beck, proud grandmother of four, is an avid sailor and world traveler.
