        "text": "Page Content\n\nAs a child, Kim Ruiz Beck spent nearly every day after school at her family's Tulare, California, food manufacturing company, Ruiz Foods.\n\nHer duties were miniscule, pretty much anything to keep an antsy 6-year-old preoccupied while the adults worked. As she grew up, her jobs intensified: filing paperwork, completing payroll and packaging burritos.\n\nHer father and grandfather co-founded Ruiz Foods in 1964. To Ruiz Beck, they were entrepreneurial masterminds who, with $400, a freezer and a stove built from junkyard scraps, created what has become a multi-million dollar business.\n\nBut Ruiz Beck recognized times were changing, the company had evolved and, if she was to take charge, she needed to prepare for the challenges that lay ahead. The way to do this, Ruiz Beck decided, was with higher education.\n\nThe Transformational Power of a College Degree\n\nWhen she graduated from California State University, Fresno in 1988 with a bachelor's in business administration – marketing, Ruiz Beck became the first in her family to earn a college degree, forever transforming the way future generations manage the nearly 55-year-old establishment.\n\n\"As the company got bigger and we started having more success, there was a need for more procedures, more formality,\" Ruiz Beck explains about her decision to pursue a degree. \"I loved Fresno State because it allowed me to focus on learning and getting everything that I could out of my classes while working.\"\n\nToday, Ruiz Foods is the leading frozen Mexican food manufacturer in the U.S. The company distributes their El Monterey® and Tornados® brands nationally from manufacturing facilities in California, Texas and South Carolina. They have expanded to nearly 4,000 employees, demonstrating exponential growth from the 500 employees the company employed at the time of Ruiz Beck's graduation from Fresno State.\n\nShe now serves as chairman of the company, having previously been interim CEO and president.\n\n\"Growing up, I remember being so proud and wanting to be a part of the family business,\" she says. \"Going to Fresno State really affirmed for me that I could contribute to and be an important part of my family business.\"\n\n​​\n\n​​\n\nPrograms like the ones at Fresno State give students the real-world experiences they need to succeed. — Kim Ruiz Beck\n\nTesting the Curriculum in the Workplace\n\nAs a student at Fresno State, Ruiz Beck learned how important it is for a company to have a corporate philosophy. Intrigued, she asked her father what Ruiz Food's philosophy was.\n\n\"His answer? We didn't have one,\" Ruiz Beck laughs. So she explained the idea to her father and the two worked together to form one that is still in place today.\n\n\"We are able to use our corporate philosophy to tell our team members who we are; we use it as a guide when we make company decisions; and we use it to hold ourselves accountable, too,\" Ruiz Beck explains.\n\nThis is just one example of how the courses at Fresno State allowed her to become a \"more organized, more detailed and more corporate\" business leader, she states.\n\nThe married mother of three sons remains committed to the campus, serving on the Fresno State Foundation's Board of Governors and as an advisor for many Craig School of Business programs. In 2017, she was awarded Fresno State's Top Dog Award, its highest alumni honor, which recognizes its recipient's commitment to scholarship, service and leadership.\n\n\"I always leave [Fresno State] so impressed with the students and the ideas they have,\" she says. \"They are programs like the ones at Fresno State that give students the real-world experiences they need to succeed.\"\n\nAbout 80 percent of Fresno State graduates stay to work in the area after graduating. \"Fresno State is an important part of our community; it's where our future community leaders are being formed,\" Ruiz Beck states.\n\nUnder her leadership, Ruiz Foods recently donated $1 million to the campus, which will allow the addition of state-of-the-art classrooms for Fresno State's MB​A and Executive MBA programs.\n\n\"Our family has been very blessed, so we are very committed to giving back. I am very proud and happy to be able to be involved,\" says Ruiz Beck, who also serves as president of the Valley Children's Healthcare Foundation and is involved in Ruiz 4 Kids, a nonprofit founded by Ruiz employees that has raised more than $3 million in scholarships for local graduating high school and community college students.\n\nLooking Forward: The Fourth Generation of Ruiz Foods\n\nBorn and raised in California's Central Valley, Ruiz Beck is the eldest of four children. Matt, one of her siblings, works in the family business; two of her three sons have day-to-day responsibilities in the business as well, introducing the fourth generation to Ruiz Foods.\n\nDecades after approaching her father about a company philosophy, Ruiz Beck recently experienced a déjà vu moment when her son — also a Fresno State marketing alumnus — asked her about using an app for a project.\n\nIt became apparent to her that the new generation was ready to make its mark in the family business, and Ruiz Beck couldn't be more proud.\n\nThe advice she gives to her sons and all future business leaders is direct: \"Take advantage of every opportunity given to you. You might fail, but give it a try. I promise you, you will learn something from it.\"\n\nA critical part of Kim Ruiz Beck's corporate philosophy is to remain dedicated to and focused on Ruiz Foods' team members, consumers and local community members.\n\n\"Going to Fresno State really affirmed for me that I could contribute and be an important part of my family business,\" Ruiz Beck says.\n\nRuiz Foods, founded in 1964 by Ruiz Beck's father, Fred, and grandfather, Louis, is the leading frozen Mexican food manufacturer in the United States. Kim is pictured here alongside her youngest brother, Matt Ruiz, who works with her in the family's Dinuba, California-based facility.\n\nJust as she brought to Ruiz Foods what she learned in her Fresno State business classes, Ruiz Beck encourages her son, Tyler Beck (pictured at right), a recent Fresno State marketing alumnus, to do the same. Tyler represents the fourth generation entering the family business.\n\nRuiz Beck prides herself in creating a workspace that encourages and supports higher education and giving back to the community. In 1964, Ruiz Foods team members founded Ruiz 4 Kids, a nonprofit organization that is made up primarily of Ruiz Foods employees.\n\nWhile attending Fresno State, Ruiz Beck was given opportunities to network with other local family businesses. She remains in contact with many today, regularly discussing the issues and successes that come with managing a family business.\n\n\"As the company got bigger and we started having more success, there was a need for more procedures, more formality,\" Ruiz Beck explains about her decision to purse a degree. \"I loved Fresno State because it allowed me to focus on learning and getting everything that I could out of my classes while working [at Ruiz Foods].\"\n\nSome of Ruiz Foods most popular frozen Mexican food items include El Monterey® and Tornados® brand products.\n\nRuiz Beck credits the business degree she earned from Fresno State with giving her the confidence and skills to take her family business to the next level.\n\nPrevious Next"
