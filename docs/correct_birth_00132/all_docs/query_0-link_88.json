        "text": "At Anna Beck, we celebrate the beauty of connection, working with heritage artisans in Bali who practice the art of handmade techniques that have been passed down from generation to generation. We thrive in collaboration and connecting to cultures through our designs. We are committed to bettering the world, using our jewelry as a bridge for change.\n\nEvery time you wear an Anna Beck piece, we hope it serves as a thoughtful reminder to give more thanks, connect more meaningfully, love more deeply, and radiate more goodness into the world.\n\nFounder Becky Hosmer started Anna Beck in 2003, during a trip to Bali. She had always been an admirer of beautiful things, but never thought she could create them. This is where she met her future business partner, Gede, who made jewelry in a little room in the back of his home and inspired her to create pieces of her own. One thing lead to another, and everyone she knew was as excited as she was about the jewelry she was creating. She chose the name, Anna Beck, as a rearrangement of her own name - Becky Ann.\n\nBecky moved to Bali, and a few years after designing those first pieces, Anna Beck grew into a business where Becky quit her day job and followed her passion. As the brand expanded, Becky moved to Bali from Los Angeles and started to understand the magic and beauty behind the pieces. Living and working with the artisans in Bali taught her the art of jewelry making, as well as the art of mindfulness, love and kindness. She became more passionate than ever about her approach to honoring the artisans and the value of handmade objects. Becky lived in Bali for five years, and the lessons she learned would become the foundation of who she is today and who we are as a brand. The Balinese culture taught her how important it is to not only share this beautiful art, but also the intentions and the energy behind it."
