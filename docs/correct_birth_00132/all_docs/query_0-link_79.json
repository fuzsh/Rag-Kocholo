        "text": "The specificity of your personality can be summed up by your nostalgic yearning for your roots – a “paradise lost” which is also a source of energy and vitality. Your power is linked to memory. You inhabit a present which draws sustenance from the past, from continuity and timelessness. The power of memory can either be dynamic or static. The consciousness of an inaccessible past can either immobilize you in melancholy and nostalgia, or shine as an ideal which motivates you to recreate a new harmony. Your attitude and approach to the past are of key importance. If you think of it as a refuge, your obsession with it may be such that your progress is impeded. If, on the contrary, you think of it as a starting point or launching pad for your comprehension of the human condition, you will integrate it into your self-realization process. You possess a potential for great maturation and wisdom. You are relatively slow-moving and may feel protected from the outer world by an armor of education, family surroundings (your most cherished environment), and social status. For this reason, you tend to limit the scope of your activities to a single well-defined sphere, and, within the boundaries you have established, release the entire spectrum of your rich and varied emotional expression. Sometimes you may feel overwhelmed by the prospect of situations which will introduce you to unfamiliar factors and elements; you see them as intrusions. Before you judge an event, a person, or a thing, you attempt to absorb it into your private universe. Of a fairly subjective and introverted turn of mind, you define everything in terms of the sensation it arouses in you as your consciousness embraces it. This predominance of sensation gives your extreme sensory finesse. Your perceptions are intense, keen, penetrating right to the heart of people and things. Your imagination, which is a function of your perceptions, is also lively, colorful, and prolific. Because you are sometimes self-centered, attentive to and protective of your inner self, you may tend to withdraw into your shell when you encounter aggression from the outer world. As a result, you may sometimes become distant and secretive. Your tendency to be rather short-tempered and easily offended, a classic flaw, is also the consequence of your need for protection and security. Despite your sensitivity, and your ability to be genuinely virtuous, you are not always gentle. Your outbreaks of hostility are all the more wounding because of their rarity. However, more than aggressiveness, your stubbornness, slow insistence, and\n\nDue to the influence of Libra rising, you treasure harmony and will actively, if not passionately, strive to achieve it, both in your social life (in your relationships with others) and in your private life (in terms of art, grace, and physical beauty). As a result, your intimate ties (to a partner, for example) will be of primordial interest to you, but you will do well to choose your partners carefully, and avoid rushing into marriage just to placate someone else’s anxiety. Your sense of grace and beauty must also find an outlet, such as dance, if you are not to feel frustrated. Social and sociable, you commit yourself entirely to your relationships and may take great pains to restore peace in your surroundings or mend bruised feelings in those around you. You are a born diplomat, and your passionate sense of justice, truth, and grace give you great gifts for promoting mutual understanding and harmony.\n\nBeck enjoys pleasure and finds fulfillment in creative activities.\n\nBeck feels that friendship and membership in groups are important for his personal self-fulfillment.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Libra (the Scales), while the sun was passing through the sign of Cancer (the Crab). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile.\n\nThe following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nSociability – Sensitivity – Adaptability – Imagination – Emotion – Eccentricity – Tolerance – Savings and thrift – Peaceful disposition – Suspicion – Sense of harmony – Obstinacy – Worldliness – Premonition.\n\nYour romantic, imaginative personality gives an original aura to your attraction and charm. Careful to shield your sensitive emotions from the slings and arrows of the outside world, you are happiest within the privacy of your family circle or among a small group of close friends. At work, you show yourself to be conscientious and well-organized, but somewhat plodding and stubborn. Your need for harmony and balance inspires you to respect other people’s opinions, and you are mindful of traditions and social conventions. Although your capacities for logic and intellectual reasoning are sometimes tinged by your emotions, you are endowed with a remarkable talent for knowing and appreciating beauty.\n\nBeck was born three and a half to seven days after the rising of the new moon, which is said to be a “crescent moon” lunar type configuration. This means that she may need to make an effort to free herself from the past. Something related to her childhood, parents, or ancestors is holding her back, impairing her effectiveness and could stand to be overcome. Due to her past, Beck refuses tried-and-true models, is always fighting to justify her innovative viewpoints, and tends to break away from tradition. Beck is hardly ever aware that she is making career and lifestyle choices which are based on an urge to modify her relationship to society, and the rigid standards and models from the past."
