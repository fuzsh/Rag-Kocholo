        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Beck and Phoenix brought their co-headlining Summer Odyssey tour to the Kia Forum on Monday, dazzling the crowd.\n\nBeck has been part of the music landscape for so long that it’s easy to take him for granted. But he was in top form, dancing like James Brown and kicking out the jams on his Silvertone guitar.\n\nHis set was tight, disciplined and calculated for maximum impact with no new album to promote: big hits, a few rare songs, a sad interlude and the newest single. Beck has a huge back catalog to choose from with a career now spanning 30 years. Beck opened with the high-energy rock of “Devil’s Haircut” from 1996 album Odelay and the bizarre electronic groove of “Mixed Business,” from 1999’s Midnite Vultures. The band wasted no time launching into “The New Pollution,” also from Odelay. Next came three consecutive songs from 2006 album Güero, including rocker “Black Tambourine.”\n\nBeck met the occasion of a hometown show with songs like “Debra,” the goofy R&B jam that takes place in Glendale and shouts out local chain restaurant Zankou Chicken, and his tale of growing up in L.A.’s Boyle Heights neighborhood, “Qué Onda Güero.”\n\nA large frame-like set of monitors encircled the stage showing art and video that enhanced the songs without being too diverting. On “Chemtrails,” Beck used laser lights and fog to bolster the song’s air of sinister uneasiness. He also played “Soul of a Man” and “Gamma Ray,” both as hard-edge rockers, giving his oft-maligned 2008 album Modern Guilt a surprisingly large presence in the set.\n\nThe band used backing tracks, although some cases were more obvious than others. “Nicotine and Gravy,” from Midnite Vultures, had a horn part, for example. Although much of the performance was uptempo, there was a quieter interlude where Beck played “The Golden Age” and “Lost Cause,” from 2003 sad troubadour album Sea Change. During “The Golden Age,” fans broke out their cell phone flashlights and held them aloft. It was all the more special for being unprompted and unplanned.\n\n“We haven’t toured together in eight years, so it’s somewhat rarefied to have them all on stage here this evening,” Beck said as he introduced guitarist Jason Falkner, bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen and drummer Joey Waronker. Longtime keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning, Jr. and percussionist Ian Longwell rounded out the lineup. It was a treat to hear them all play together again.\n\nBeck saved some of his biggest hits for the end, including his first hit, “Loser,” which inspired the night’s biggest singalong, as well as “Dreams,” “Sexx Laws” and “E-Pro.” To close the show, Beck brought Phoenix out to sing their new song (and the tour’s namesake), “Odyssey.” The fun and camaraderie increased as members of Sir Chloe and Jenny Lewis’ band also joined them for a raucous “Where It’s At” to conclude the show.\n\nFrench art-rockers Phoenix played a high-impact set that leaned heavily on 2009 album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix with songs like “Lisztomania,” “Lasso” and “1901,” as well as songs from their most recent album, Alpha Zulu like “Tonight,” “After Midnight” and the title track.” The audience loudly sang along with the choruses.\n\nThe band had great visuals, with the screens variously shifting to show a grand palace, the earth from space and kaleidoscopic patterns. Their strobe lighting, however, was overused and at times distracting rather than dramatic.\n\nPhoenix, which famously started out as the backing band for French duo Air, has four regular members – singer Thomas Mars, bassist Deck D’Arcy, and brothers Christian Mazzalai and Laurent Brancowitz on guitar. Long-time drummer Thomas Hedlund and keyboardist Robin Coudert accompanied them. Hedlund has a hard-hitting style that helped inject the songs with the energy needed for a live show.\n\nJudging by the ecstatic reaction, “Trying to Be Cool,” from 2013’s Bankrupt! was a particular favorite with its sticky synths and its Beck-like lyrics. The band was even selling satin jackets patterned after the ones they wore in the video at merch booths. During the end of “If I Ever Feel Better/Funky Squaredance,” Mars kneeled before a mysterious figure in a cape and Versailles masquerade as he sang. Mars disappeared and the figure silently and dramatically held out a prop severed head to the audience.\n\n“You think this is funny? Mars asked afterward. “We had to bring this through customs.”\n\nMars capped off a rousing set by jumping off the stage and walking through the crowd. Then, with a boost from his crew, he climbed to the balcony, where he hugged and high-fived fans before climbing back down, standing aloft on fans’ raised hands and crowd-surfing his way back to the stage.\n\nThe headliners were joined by featured tour guest Jenny Lewis, whose Americana-flavored set was fun and quirky. Lewis, who also opened for Harry Styles, played some of her songs while standing on a small round platform like an old-time circus act, with a fan artfully blowing her hair around as she sang.\n\nShe led a crack team of musicians through fan favorites like “Red Bull and Hennessey,” “One of the Guys” and “She’s Not Me,” as well as newer songs “Psychos,” “Joy’all” and “Puppy and a Truck.” She also played “Do Si Do,” from 2019’s On the Line, because it was “produced by your boy Beck,” as she described it.\n\nLewis spent entire songs bathed in only a red or green wash, without the usual dynamic of color changes timed to augment the songs. She closed her set with one of her favorite covers, the Girls’ song “Lust for Life,” followed by the hedonistic “See Fernando,” from 2008 album Acid Tongue. This was her last show on the Summer Odyssey tour; Weyes Blood and Japanese Breakfast will be playing in this slot on future tour dates.\n\nThe band Sir Chloe opened the show with a short set that was dark, brash and exciting, especially for 6 p.m. on a Monday. Dana Foote and co. played tracks from their new album I Am the Dog, including “Should I,” “Salivate” and “Hooves,” as well as TikTok favorite “Michelle.” Foote, who plays guitar and sings, has a compelling, PJ-Harvey-esque energy.\n\nGetting in to the the Forum was madness due to the Taylor Swift show happening across the street at SoFi Stadium. Beck cheekily referenced the parallel concert when he dedicated his show to “all the Swiftie dads here tonight.”"
