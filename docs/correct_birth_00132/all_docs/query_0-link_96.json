        "text": "Heinz Beck is one a numerous chefs bewitched by Italy. His journey has touched Sicily with his heart (his wife Teresa is from Palermo) and Rome with his head, and fortunately he’s still there. To be honest, you can count the number of times he’s returned to Bavaria in the last five years on one hand. Heinz, whose size, eyes and hair are reminiscent of those of a woodland elf, has lived in Rome for the past eleven years, since 1994, when the Cavalieri hotel entrusted the launch of Pergola, its roof-top restaurant which offers a unique view of the Italian capital, especially by night, into planetary orbit, to his capable hands.\n\nBeck had no experience of working in Italy at all: he’d learned his trade at excellent addresses in Munich, Freeburg and Majorca, and later in Berlin, before being called by his namesake Heinz Winkler, a native of South Tyrol living in Bavaria, as sous chef of Residenza in Aschau. It was 1991 and Beck likes to remember that he was Winkler’s pastry-chef and that, if he’s an all-round chef today, it’s all thanks to his own efforts and the fact that he has mentally reprogrammed his way of thinking more than once. From sweet thought to sweet and savoury thoughts and from a largely German start to an Italian situation where he wasn’t asked to cook the food of his birthplace, but that of his adopted home."
