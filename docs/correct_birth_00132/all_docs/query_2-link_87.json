        "text": "This is a timeline of galactic history—a chronological record of events relevant to the galaxy. This timeline uses dates in terms of years before the Battle of Yavin (BBY) and after the Battle of Yavin (ABY).\n\nThis in-universe list is incomplete. You can help Wookieepedia by expanding it.\n\nTimeline of galactic history[]\n\nBefore the Republic (eons–25,025 BBY)[]\n\nSentient species prehistory\n\nThe universe begins forming.[2]\n\nThe galaxy is formed around a super-massive black hole.[3]\n\nMidi-chlorians are birthed from the Wellspring of Life. They are microscopic symbiotic organisms in all living things that connect the Living Force—the energy of all life—to the Cosmic Force, allowing the will of the all-encompassing energy field known as the Force to communicate with lifeforms.[4]\n\nThe Father, the Son, and the Daughter exist as powerful Force wielders who come to live in the ethereal realm of Mortis.[5]\n\nBillions of years before the Imperial Era, mineral matter that would infuse rock walls on the planet Ilum with valuable constituents, including rare crystals such as the Force-attuned kyber, begin to accumulate.[6]\n\nThe long lived Exogorth species comes into existance. Over one billion years before the Imperial Era, the Exogorth Sy-O is born to Sy-O's father-and-mother. However, at even one billion, Sy-O would be considered young by Exogorth standards.[7]\n\nBillions to millions of years before the Imperial Era, lava flows on Dagobah and form Mount Dagger before disappearing to allow for the flourishing of non-sentient life.[8]\n\nA non-sentient species lives on the world of Bravais, eventually evolving into the sentient Bravaisian.[9]\n\nA non-sentient species lives on the planet Crul millions of years before they evolve into the sentient Crolute.[9]\n\nA primitive species lives on the planet Abednedo, eventually evolving into the sentient Abednedo.[9]\n\nSentient species history (exact chronology undefined)\n\nIn ancient times, beings from a distant galaxy built a reflex point on the planet Seatos which pointed the way to the extragalactic planet Peridea.[10] The people become known as the Dathomiri.[11]\n\nA star map pointing the way to Peridea's galaxy was also stored inside a former Nightsister stronghold on Arcana.[12]\n\n100,000 BBY\n\nBeginning of the construction of the first city levels of Coruscant in the Core Worlds.[13]\n\n57,000 BBY\n\nUtapau is settled[14] by colonists who eventually evolve into the Pau'an and Utai species.[15]\n\nPre-hyperspace travel\n\nBatuu, a planet on the edge of the Outer Rim Territories, is colonized millennia after a great cataclysm resulted in the planet's giant trees being destroyed and eventually petrified.[16]\n\nA sentient ancestral species[17] invents the hyperdrive after studying the hyperspace-traveling purrgil,[18] opening up the galaxy for exploration.[17]\n\nPost-hyperspace travel\n\nc. 30,000 BBY\n\nDevaronians, naturally adept as scouts, become active as galactic explorers from their native planet Devaron, independently developing the hyperdrive.[8]\n\nThe Outer Rim planet Benetage is abandoned.[8]\n\nc. 27,000 BBY\n\nFelucia is colonized by Gossam Courivers[19]\n\nBy this point, human civilization had developed on Empress Teta in the Deep Core.[8]\n\nThe Old Republic (c. 25,025 – c. 1000 BBY)[]\n\nDawn of the Jedi (c. 25,025 BBY)[]\n\nc. 25,025 BBY\n\nThe Dai Bendu, the religious group that would be attributed with the first holocrons, exists as the precursor to the Jedi Order.[20]\n\nIn pursuit of the preservation of peace and justice, an individual who came to be known as the Prime Jedi founds the Jedi Order on Ahch-To.[21][22]\n\nThe First Jedi Temple is built on Ahch-To,[21] and the Jedi village is constructed on the Temple Island soon afterward.[22]\n\nShortly after the founding of the Jedi Order, the world Ilum is discovered by a Jedi scout through Force-assisted hyperspace navigation.[8]\n\nc. 25,020 BBY\n\nProfessor Huyang powers up.[21]\n\nc. 25,000 BBY\n\nThe Galactic Republic is formed[21][23] by the Core Founders, twenty-two Core Worlds which include such planets as Alderaan.[24]\n\nExpansionist Period (25,000 BBY)[]\n\n25,000 BBY (continued)\n\nExpansionist Period\n\nThe foundation of the Corellian Run helps the formation of the Corellia system. The Corellian Trade Spine and the Perlemian Trade Route are also founded.[25]\n\nDuros explorers discover and colonize the planet Neimoidia.[26]\n\nThe planet Cato Neimoidia joins the Republic.[27]\n\nMillennia before the Imperial Era[]\n\nEons before the Imperial Era (exact chronology undefined)\n\nThe comet Kinro is predicted to carve its way through the Core Worlds. Before it can enter the Mid Rim, members of the Jedi Order come together and will it apart, although several Jedi lose their lives or minds in the process.[28]\n\nBy this point, the ice moon Mesula had been shattered.[29]\n\nThe first Grand Zigoth of Utapau, Krynbalt Kyr, dies.[29]\n\nThousands of years before the Clone Wars or the Imperial Era (exact chronology undefined)\n\nThe Predori empire opposed the Galactic Republic.[30]\n\nA sentient species constructs a wormhole gate that leads between the seams of time and space, facilitating their exodus from the wider galaxy.[31]\n\nThe Temple of the Kyber is constructed on the cold, desert moon of Jedha.[32]\n\nHylemane Lightbringer is born and later bludgeoned to death by a chair, disproving the myth that \"he could not be killed by mortal weapons.\"[28]\n\nThe Zygerrian Slave Empire is defeated by Jedi Knights.[33]\n\nA rogue Jedi[34] leads a group of Force users to seek greater power through embracing the dark side of the Force. They split from the Jedi Order[17] during the schism known as the Hundred-Year Darkness,[35] becoming the rivaling Sith.

Centuries before the Clone Wars, the Rule of Two is revealed to the Jedi Order, though still they presume the Sith's eradication and believe that Bane's plan is ruined with his defeat[89] allegedly at the hands of his apprentice, Darth Zannah, in a duel on the Inner Rim planet Ambria.
