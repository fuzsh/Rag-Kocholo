        "text": "My name is Beck Bat. I currently live in City of Los Angeles. What inspired me to write this book is I tried too many things as a career in my life. And no matter how hard I tried, things didn't work out for me. While I was trying and failing, I was reading self help book voraciously. And there's still no change but... Things start to change as soon as I started applying what I read. I was surprised by the positive changes taking place. The learning was so impactful and subtle that I had an overwhelming urge to share what I was learning. This is my first book and haven't done anything like this before. So naturally, writing this book was difficult for me. But I knew the principles that led success. All I need to do was to apply them. And I did. Result? The book you are looking at. Thank you for checking out my book. My hope is it may help you as much as it helped me. Please visit my website www.thesuccessdynamics.com to find out more about my up-coming books and more in-dept success principles.\n\nRead full bio"
