        "text": "Beck Biography\n\nBeck’s first name was Beck. David Campbell, also known as Beck David Hansen, is an American singer-songwriter who transformed Bob Dylan‘s hipster folk minstrel into the hip-hop and sampling era.\n\nBeck was born in Los Angeles, California, on July 8, 1970. His mother (Bibbe Hansen) had ties to Andy Warhol’s Factory, his father (David Campbell) was a musician who went on to arrange strings for various alternative rockers, and his grandpa (Al Hansen) was a member of the Fluxus art movement in the 1960s. Beck returned to his hometown of Los Angeles after a brief stint in New York City’s East Village’s “anti-folk” movement. He performed at coffeehouses in the Silverlake district. “Loser,” a low-budget demo for Bong Load Custom Records, became a Los Angeles radio hit and, later, a national sensation once Beck signed with major label DGC. “Loser,” a rapped lyric performed over a slide-guitar sample with amazing poetic juxtapositions like “drive-by body pierce,” highlighted Beck’s significant talent, even if he was initially pigeonholed as a Generation X novelty act. The rest of Mellow Gold, his debut album from 1994, demonstrated his mastery of a mash-up of folk, rap, 1960s rock, and pop corniness from every era.\n\nBeck’s odd contract permitted him to record for other labels: One Foot in the Grave was released on K, and Stereopathic Soul Manure was released on Flipside (both were released in 1994). With Odelay, his major label follow-up from 1996, he became a cultural hero. Odelay was produced by the Dust Brothers, who had previously worked on the equally bizarre Beastie Boys album Paul’s Boutique (1989), and featured the Grammy Award-winning single “Where It’s At” (with the iconic lyric “I’ve got two turntables and a microphone”). Beck became the leading alternative rocker for an audience that had grown tired of grunge’s sincerity. The CD was nominated for a Grammy for best alternative music performance. Beck’s following album, Mutations (in part titled after the psychedelic Brazilian group Os Mutantes), added to his palette by exploring the subtlety of Brazilian music. The album earned Beck his third Grammy.\n\nMidnite Vultures (1999), Beck’s return to beat-heavy abstract pop that leaned more heavily than ever in a pseudo-rhythm-and-blues direction (Beck was fond of unveiling James Brown-style and break-dance steps in his live show at this point), was a commercial flop. Beck, like David Byrne (see Talking Heads) before him, had over-conceptualized his art to the point where the results were emotionally devoid.\n\nSea Change (2002), which contained some of Beck’s most intimate lyrics and was alternately lush and sparse, received some of the greatest praise of his career. The Flaming Lips and Beck shared the bill and the stage (as a supporting band) during the album’s promotion tour. Beck returned to collaborating with the Dust Brothers and genre-hopping with Guero, a track-by-track set of deluxe remixes of Guero by a host of other producers and performers released later that year; Guerolito, a track-by-track set of deluxe remixes of Guero by a host of other producers and performers, was released later that year. Sea Change’s producer, Nigel Godrich, is best known for his work with Radiohead, and he added a spacey psychedelic gloss to Beck’s upbeat musical pastiche The Information (2006), which came with stickers that invited listeners to create a do-it-yourself jewel box cover to mirror Beck’s upbeat musical pastiche.\n\nBeck’s tenth studio album, Modern Guilt, was released in 2008, co-produced by Danger Mouse and further showcased Beck’s love of 1960s psychedelic rock. Beck returned with Morning Phase (2014), a “companion piece” to Sea Change, after taking a sabbatical from recording to create multiple albums and heal from a spine injury. Several Grammy Awards were given to the critically acclaimed album, including album of the year and best rock album.\n\nBeck made guest appearances on various artists’ albums and collaborated with producer Greg Kurstin on Colors (2017), a colorful mix of pop songs. Beck collaborated with a variety of musicians for Hyperspace (2019), particularly Pharrell Williams.\n\nBeck Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Was Beck’s First Album?\n\nBeck’s first album was called “Mellow Gold”.
