• i.e.: share of instances that have dbo:genre.{dbr.Rock_Music}? – Lexical score: likelihood of term as a surface form of object • i.e.: how often is Rock used to refer to dbr:Rock_Music? – Sibling score: how likely are sibling categories sharing similar patterns? • i.e., are there sibling categories with a high score for dbo:genre?\n\n47. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 47 Cat2Ax: ChatGPT Style\n\n48. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 48 Cat2Ax: ChatGPT Style\n\n49. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 49 Cat2Ax: ChatGPT Style\n\n50. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 50 Cat2Ax: ChatGPT Style\n\n51. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 51 CaLiGraph Example Category: Musical Groups established in 1987 List of symphonic metal bands Category: Swedish death metal bands List of Swedes in Music\n\n52. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 52 CaLiGraph: ChatGPT Style\n\n53. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 53 CaLiGraph: ChatGPT Style\n\n54. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 54 CaLiGraph: ChatGPT Style\n\n55. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 55 Back to my Original Presentation\n\n56. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 56 Improving Entity Coverage: Lists in Wikipedia • Only existing pages have categories – Lists may also link to non-existing pages\n\n57. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 57 Pushing Entity Coverage Further • Beyond red links (2020) • Beyond explicit lists (2021)\n\n58. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 58 Cat2Ax: ChatGPT Style\n\n59. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 59 Entity Extraction from Listings: ChatGPT Style\n\n60. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 60 Entity Extraction from Listings: ChatGPT Style\n\n61. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 61 Entity Extraction from Listings: ChatGPT Style\n\n62. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 62 Entity Hallucination from Listings: ChatGPT goes Rogue\n\n63. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 63 Entity Hallucination from Listings: ChatGPT goes Rogue\n\n64. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 64 Entity Hallucination from Listings: ChatGPT goes Rogue\n\n65. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 65 Entity Hallucination from Listings: ChatGPT goes Rogue\n\n66. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 66 Entity Hallucination from Listings: ChatGPT goes Rogue This went on for a while, but lead nowhere.\n\n67. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 67 Revisiting CaLiGraph: Entity Disambiguation • Examples: Wikipedia pages of Die Krupps and Eisbrecher ?\n\n68. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 68 Revisiting CaLiGraph: Entity Disambiguation Proper solution: ”NASTyLinker: NIL-Aware Scalable Transformer-based Entity Linker” Tuesday, 12 am\n\n69. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 69 Entity Disambiguation: ChatGPT Bloopers\n\n70. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 70 Entity Disambiguation: ChatGPT Bloopers\n\n71. 05/29/23 Heiko Paulheim 71 Take Aways • Basic KG creation with ChatGPT can work – At least in a human in the loop setup • Reinforcement signals might help here – Main challenge: hallucinations • On the other hand: consider them “extraction of additional facts” • Isn’t that just like heuristic KG completion? • Disclaimer: – No PhD students were harmed or replaced by ChatGPT. • Full ChatGPT protocol available here."
