        "text": "Background\n\nSocial media content creator and sensation Noah Timothy Beck was born on May 4, 2001, in Arizona and grew up with his heart set on becoming a professional soccer player. Growing up, Beck has always been very competitive in his sports. He was a brilliant soccer player and was the team captain when playing for the U.S. Youth Soccer Olympic Development Program from 2014 until 2017. Beck was awarded a scholarship in 2019 from the University of Portland, where he played midfielder for the soccer team Portland’s Pilots. The start of Covid brought new changes, which caused Beck to drop out of university in 2020.\n\nSoon after he dropped out, he made the career decision to start a TikTok account in 2020 — it went viral within one short month. It was immediately evident that Beck would become an internet sensation TikTok listed him as one of the ‘Top 10 Breakout Content Creators’ of 2020. In the same year, Beck crushed some of our dreams when confirming his relationship with talented American singer Dixie D’Amelio — they’ve been happily in love ever since. Beck’s following on social media skyrocketed within a year as he started 2021 with a wapping 27 million followers on TikTok, 7.3 million followers on Instagram, and 1.5 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nBeck broke the internet on January 19, 2021, when he posted a shot of his photoshoot with Damon Baker — a photographic prodigy — that received over 2.1 million likes on Instagram. He also relocated to Los Angeles, where he began filming his reality series documentary “Noah Beck Tries Things,” which was signed up for a second season in August 2021 by the production company. Beck was featured on the cover of “VMAN” magazine in March 2021 and was invited as a VIP guest to the 2021 Louis Vuitton Fall Menswear Collection show. What is Beck doing this year? Well, he started with his first fashion campaign in February for the fashion house, Coach, as well as his podcast with Larry, named “Putasockinit,” and we are 100% sure there is still much to come!"
