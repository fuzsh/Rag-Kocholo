        "text": "Aaron Beck\n\nAaron Beck is an American psychiatrist known as the father of cognitive therapy. He developed widely used assessment tools for depression and anxiety. Beck attended Brown University and Yale Medical School. He believed that depression stems from negative views of oneself, the world, and the future. Cognitive therapy aims to help patients overcome difficulties by identifying and changing dysfunctional thoughts and behaviors. It involves helping patients develop skills to modify beliefs and identify distorted thinking.\n\nPsychological theories of delusional disorder\n\nPsychological theories of delusional disorderSamanvithaa Adiseshan\n\nThis document provides an overview of delusions from multiple perspectives. It defines delusions, describes the types and content of delusions, and explains several theories about the formation and maintenance of delusional beliefs, including psychodynamic, learning, theory of mind, role of emotions, and attributional bias approaches. It also discusses factors such as conviction, extension, bizarreness, and pressure that contribute to delusional severity.\n\nDialectical behavior therapy (2)\n\nDialectical behavior therapy (2)Asma Shihabeddin\n\nDBT is a treatment for borderline personality disorder that combines cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness practices. It aims to help patients regulate their emotions and improve their interpersonal relationships through weekly skills training groups, individual therapy sessions, phone coaching, and therapist consultation meetings. Key aspects of DBT include balancing acceptance of patients with strategies to induce change, validating patients' experiences, and teaching skills for mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation.\n\nThe exposure therapy\n\nThe exposure therapyAoun Ali\n\nExposure therapy is a psychological treatment that helps people confront their fears by directly facing feared objects, situations, or activities in real life (in vivo exposure), imagining them vividly (imaginal exposure), experiencing them through virtual reality technology, or deliberately inducing physical sensations associated with them (interoceptive exposure). It has been shown to be effective for treating anxiety disorders like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, OCD, PTSD, and GAD. Different variations of exposure therapy involve real-life, imagined, virtual reality, or physical sensation-based confrontations with feared stimuli.\n\nSchema Therapy\n\nThis document provides an overview of schema therapy. It discusses how schemas develop from unmet emotional needs in childhood and shape maladaptive behaviors and lifetraps in adulthood. Eighteen early maladaptive schemas are organized into five domains: disconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy/performance, impaired limits, other-directedness, and overvigilance/inhibition. Lifetraps perpetuate schemas through cognitive distortions, self-defeating patterns, and coping styles. The goal of schema therapy is to help patients overcome schemas and lifetraps to better meet core emotional needs.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapyedtheroach\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that was pioneered by Dr. Aaron Beck in the 1960s. CBT examines how a person's thoughts, behaviors, body, and emotions influence each other. It is based on the theory that dysfunctional emotions and behaviors result largely from dysfunctional thinking and beliefs. The goals of CBT are to challenge negative thought patterns and beliefs, and replace them with more adaptive thoughts. CBT is effective in treating many conditions including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders.\n\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (DSM-V)\n\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (DSM-V)Adesh Agrawal\n\nThe disorders those characterized by repetitive behavior, are included under this broad chapter in DSM-5. Here we prepared this PPT in which we tried to cover the whole topic in a very comprehensive and concise manner. We hope that this will help you to understand it in an easy way. your further suggestions will be appreciated.\n\nNeurobiology of sleep\n\nNeurobiology of sleepkavtaradze\n\nThis document is a collection of photo credits from various photographers used in a Haiku Deck presentation on SlideShare. The photos were taken by photographers named Kevin Dooley, Rob Unreall, lapidim, Daveography.ca, emagdi, Dreemreeper, giulia.forsythe, gliageek, RachelHermosillo, Jim Nix / Nomadic Pursuits, and mpisti. The document encourages the reader to get started creating their own Haiku Deck presentation.\n\nCbt -Ocd\n\nCBT is an effective treatment for OCD due to its ability to trigger lasting neural changes through learning. It involves psychoeducation, challenging irrational assumptions, exposure to feared situations without compulsions, and response prevention. Studies show large effect sizes for CBT compared to medications alone. CBT aims to reduce anxiety and distress from obsessions by stopping thoughts and using distractions, while exposure therapy targets compulsions. Success requires understanding all symptoms, motivated patients, and therapists able to systematically implement the CBT techniques.\n\nPutting dbt into your practice for notes revision 2 02 06 2013\n\nPutting dbt into your practice for notes revision 2 02 06 2013GreenWood Mentors Ltd\n\nDBT was developed by Marsha Linehan for those with borderline personality disorder and self-harming behaviors. It combines standard cognitive-behavioral techniques with acceptance-based strategies and mindfulness. DBT therapy includes individual sessions, skills training groups, telephone coaching, and therapist consultation meetings. The goal is to decrease harmful behaviors while increasing functional coping skills through commitment to the treatment and its four stages: pre-therapy commitment, therapy, ending therapy, and post-therapy.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\n\nCognitive Behavioral TherapyMarcin Stanowski\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed from behaviorism and the cognitive revolution. Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) was developed by Albert Ellis and focuses on identifying and disputing irrational beliefs. Aaron Beck developed cognitive therapy which posits that negative schemas cause depression. Both REBT and cognitive therapy aim to identify and change maladaptive thoughts by teaching patients to dispute irrational beliefs and substitute rational beliefs. Therapists act as collaborators with patients to test thoughts through socratic questioning. CBT is an empirically supported treatment for depression, anxiety disorders, and other conditions.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy Simplified\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy SimplifiedThe Mind Faculty\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that helps people change unhelpful thinking and behavior patterns. The document outlines the main features and basic structure of CBT. It discusses behavioral techniques like relaxation, distraction, and activity scheduling. It also covers cognitive techniques such as identifying negative thoughts, cognitive restructuring to develop more realistic perspectives, and addressing underlying assumptions. The goal of CBT is to help clients learn to challenge irrational beliefs and thoughts in order to change emotional responses and behaviors.\n\nExposure therapy\n\nExposure therapy is a psychological treatment that helps people confront their fears. It involves directly facing or vividly imagining the feared object, situation, or activity. There are several types of exposure therapy including in vivo exposure facing real fears, imaginal exposure involving vividly imagining fears, virtual reality exposure using technology, and interoceptive exposure deliberately bringing on physical sensations. Exposure therapy can be useful for trauma healing by helping disaster victims reduce fears associated with things reminding them of natural disasters.\n\nCognitive behavior therapy theory and practice\n\nCognitive behavior therapy theory and practiceWuzna Haroon\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was developed in the 1960s by Aaron Beck based on his research challenging the psychoanalytic view of depression. Beck observed that depressed clients had negative biases in interpreting events that contributed to cognitive distortions. He developed CBT which focuses on identifying and modifying dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs. The key assumptions of CBT are that cognitions influence behaviors and emotions, and that maladaptive thinking can be identified and changed. Common techniques include cognitive restructuring to challenge irrational thoughts, behavioral experiments, and homework assignments.\n\nCognitive therapy cbt and rebt\n\nCognitive therapy cbt and rebtCristina Santos\n\nCognitive behavioral approaches combine cognitive and behavioral principles in short-term therapy. Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) emphasizes challenging irrational beliefs, though some cultures value interdependence over independence. When using REBT cross-culturally, therapists should modify how they assess and dispute clients' irrational beliefs based on their cultural backgrounds. Cognitive behavioral group therapy is structured and focuses on teaching clients cognitive strategies through homework and in-session exercises led by the directive therapist. The cognitive model posits that automatic thoughts influence reactions, and cognitive techniques aim to replace dysfunctional thoughts with more adaptive alternatives.\n\nAnxiety disorder\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder is a common condition affecting 3-8% of the population annually. It involves excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday life events. Biological factors like the GABA and serotonin systems are involved. Treatment involves psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy like SSRIs, and lifestyle changes. The disorder commonly co-occurs with other conditions like depression and is more prevalent in women. Medical conditions can also cause anxiety disorder-like symptoms."
