        "text": "Biography of \"Chicago\" Mike Beck\n\nIn the USA, he's been called Texas-Sized Mike; In Europe, they know him as Chicago Mike.\n\nMike Beck has been performing for more than fifteen years. Possessing a diverse repertoire of more than 500 songs, Mike has developed a loyal following on two continents. Whether performing solo, with his acoustic duo Big Eyed Beans From Venus, or with his full Electric Beans Rock & Soul Revue, audiences return again and again to enjoy his high-energy live performances.\n\nMike released his premiere CD in Europe in October 2002 with Big Ugly Music & Media. Entitled Chicago Mike, the CD features eight original songs and a cover of Warren Haynes' Soulshine, performed with Larry McCray, renowned blues guitarist who first brought that song to public attention in 1995 on his Point Blank / Virgin Records release Delta Hurricane.\n\nIn September of 2002, Mike produced a live concert recording for Dutch blues-rockers Rob Orlemans & Half Past Midnight. The result is Half Past Midnight: Live In Chicago, released by Savage Music in December 2002. The CD has received widespread critical acclaim throughout Europe, and is enjoying radio airplay in Holland and Germany.\n\nOther projects that Mike has worked on can be found in his Discography and Bandography.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, but growing up in ChicagoÂ¹s north suburbs, Mike immersed himself in the Windy City's phenomenal wealth of music, exploring the best of its blues, jazz, gospel, soul and rock offerings. Following a two year pilgimage to New Orleans, Mike returned to Illinois, this time landing in Carbondale, situated in the Southern end of the state. Here, he further honed his aggressive acoustic guitar style, while enhancing and mutating it by fusing bluegrass elements gleaned from so many of the talented pickers he found in Southern Illinois. Seven years in the wilds of Utah followed three years living in the Blues Mecca of Chicago's north side. He now resides back in Chicago's north suburbs when he's not recording and performing throughout the USA and abroad.\n\nPossessed of a powerful voice and dynamic stage presence, Mike's performances include forays into rock, soul, blues, and country, including compelling originals, classic rock favorites, stirring soul standards, and guilty pleasures.\n\nCheck out Mike's up-to-date tour itinerary, listen to audio clips, and enjoy photos from the recording sessions for his debut CD as well as past performances.
