        "text": "Charles Lloyd \"Charlie\" Beck (born June 27, 1953) is the Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). A veteran of the department with over three decades of service, he is known for commanding and rehabilitating the Rampart Division after the Rampart Scandal; and for technology enhancements during his time as Chief of Detectives.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nI think this is a department that reflects the city and reflects it not only in the makeup of the personnel — which is the most diverse department in the city by far — but also in the diversity of our thought and the recognition that policing is a very complicated social contract with the people that live in this city, and that social contract requires action on both parts.\n\nQuoted in: Brenda Gazzar (August 9, 2014). \"LAPD Chief Charlie Beck earns good reviews; tough challenges lie ahead\". Los Angeles Daily News .\n\nI am immensely proud to lead the men and women of the LAPD who work tirelessly every day to earn the trust of our communities and who risk their lives to protect those that live, work and visit the City of Angels.\n\nQuoted in: Dennis Romero (August 12, 2014). \"LAPD Chief Charlie Beck Gets Another 5 Years\". LA Weekly .\n\nIn a couple of decades ... every public safety employee, police officers, firefighters, paramedics, everybody will have them. I think it improves behavior on both sides of the camera, which is our goal.\n\nOn usefulness of body cameras for police officers — quoted in: David Wright; Victoria Thompson; Lauren Effron (December 18, 2014). \"Police Departments Are Buying Body Cams, and Officers Don't Have to Tell You When They're Recording\". ABC News .\n\nWe don't turn people away because things are out of statute. You come to us, especially with a sexual allegation, we will work with you. We address these things seriously, and it's not just because it's Mr. Cosby.\n\nLos Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck on willingness to investigate claims of sexual assault against Bill Cosby even if past the statute of limitations — quoted in: Kate Mather; Richard Winton (December 4, 2014). \"LAPD chief vows to investigate Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations\". Los Angeles Times .\n\nThis is a national issue, one that is important when we talk about police legitimacy. This is an important national conversation we need to have. When something happens in Missouri or the streets of New York City, it has an impact here. We are all tied together.\n\nOn controversial cases of police killing unarmed civilians — quoted in: Lauren Gold (December 4, 2014). \"LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck on police killings: ‘This is an important national conversation we need to have’\". The Pasadena Star-News .\n\nAbout\n\n[edit]\n\nI judge him by the results I see in Watts at our public housing developments where the Community Safety Partnership has positively changed the culture of relations between the community and the police department. Over the last few years, Watts and the LAPD have each undergone a remarkable transformation for which I credit Chief Beck.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino, quoted in: Dennis Romero (August 12, 2014). \"LAPD Chief Charlie Beck Gets Another 5 Years\". LA Weekly .\n\nActivists laud Beck for establishing cooperative relationships with a number of communities, particularly Latinos and blacks, and for his sophisticated approach to gang crime, which has been cut in half during his tenure.\n\nBrenda Gazzar (August 9, 2014). \"LAPD Chief Charlie Beck earns good reviews; tough challenges lie ahead\". Los Angeles Daily News .\n\nBeck is finishing Bratton’s legacy of transforming the department. It’s Beck who will bring it over the line and say, yes, LAPD is a new police force with a new culture, a new outlook, a new way of treating the public — especially the minority public — and we will never go back to the days of Rodney King because we have changed the culture of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nCivil rights lawyer Connie Rice — quoted in: Brenda Gazzar (August 9, 2014). \"LAPD Chief Charlie Beck earns good reviews; tough challenges lie ahead\". Los Angeles Daily News .\n\nThe LAPD is still haunted by one of the most notorious police beatings ever caught on camera, the assault on Rodney King, which resulted in ferocious riots more than 20 years ago. It’s a big reason why LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, who wears his body camera on his chest, is eager for his department to embrace this technology.\n\nDavid Wright; Victoria Thompson; Lauren Effron (December 18, 2014). \"Police Departments Are Buying Body Cams, and Officers Don't Have to Tell You When They're Recording\".
