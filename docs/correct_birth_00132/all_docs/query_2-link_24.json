        "text": "As financial advisors, we meet a lot of clients who have concentrated positions - greater than 10-20% of their net worth - in their employer, in crypto, or even in the shares of a former employer. We know what would be in the client’s best interest – diversify, diversify, diversify – into a much less risky portfolio in accordance with the client’s risk tolerance. There are many strategies used to diversify – everything from outright or partial sale, options strategies, separate accounts with loss harvesting, exchange funds, charitable giving, covered calls, etc. But there is often one major hurdle… …getting the client’s buy in to diversify at all! After all, the most sound and sophisticated strategies are worthless unless the client is willing to diversify in the first place. As advisors who have repeatedly faced this conundrum, we thought we’d offer our four-pronged approach to how we often handle this: Step 1: We listen. We always begin by asking the client how they accumulated the position in the first place and what their thoughts and emotions are about it. Their answers are always different. Some strongly believe in the future of the company they work at, even if they don’t have exclusive information. We’ve also heard at least one who told us he did indeed have exclusive information so wanted to hold the position. For others, mere inertia has caused them to accumulate the position, as the shares were deposited in their account and they didn’t have the time or knowledge to diversify. We’ve even heard some who own concentrated crypto positions articulate incredibly bullish cases for the future of cryptocurrency. Some feel that they are being “loyal” to their company and don’t want to be seen selling the shares. Once the reasons for the concentrated position are understood then the conversation can continue. Step 2: We then like to ask, “If your company gave you your bonus in cash, would you then in turn use that cash to buy the company’s shares?” We find that this generally gets the mental wheels turning, in that the client then sees that in a liquid market cash and shares can be effectively equivalent. Generally, they answer “no.” Step 3: Once we’ve cleared the air and the client feels heard, then, and only then, we point out the risks, pitfalls, and research on owning a concentrated position. For example, we like to show a slide like the one below, suggesting that even many once well-regarded companies can file for bankruptcy and have their shares go virtually to zero. Step 4: Finally, if the client is reluctant to sell, we suggest that the client move partially towards diversifying, maybe only sell 10-50% of the position, as this will be an improvement in the risk profile of the overall portfolio.\n\nMore good news! Murder rates have been going down -- since 1250! From Our World in Data: \"It is hard to imagine just how violent the past was. The chart shows that in the 13th and 14th centuries, based on data from researcher Manuel Eisner, homicide rates across Western Europe were higher than 10 murders per 100,000 people in a year. In Italy, the rate was as high as 70 murders per 100,000 people. Since then, murder rates have fallen significantly across these countries. According to data from WHO’s Mortality Database, their homicide rate is now around 1 murder per 100,000 people — less than a tenth of what it used to be. Despite these improvements, homicides remain a common cause of death globally and are even a leading cause in some countries. But significant and lasting reductions in violence between people are possible.\" Good news, indeed!\n\nAh, politics again. A lot of people have asked me if I watched the political brawl on June 27. Spoiler alert: I didn't. For one, I can’t affect the outcome and, moreover, I already know who I’m going to vote for. So why not spend my time doing something productive like writing LinkedIn posts for you, my 4,000 followers? But the second, greater reason, is that in my professional area of work and expertise, investing and the economy, the outcome in November matters little. I’ve posted on LinkedIn in the past few months about how it matters little from a government spending standpoint, or what congress and the president allocate, given that non-defense spending, or what gets allocated every year, consists of only four percent of Gross Domestic Product, and even this amount doesn’t change all that much. And when we look at long term market history, we see that markets have consistently risen regardless of the party of the president. But there’s a second reason: Much more important to the economy are the monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve. The United States has a strong, credible, and independent Federal Reserve. Let’s start with the head of the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell, a republican and originally an appointee to the Federal Reserve Board by a democratic president, is eminently qualified and respected by both parties. Even though our 45th republican president (rhymes with “bump\") appointed him, our 46th democratic president re-nominated him for another four year term. The independence of the Federal Reserve Board could also be seen when our 45th (republican) president tried to appoint three unqualified political appointees to the board - Stephen Moore, Herman Cain, and Judy Shelton, - Moore and Cain withdrew and Shelton was voted down by the Senate. The Federal Reserve became fully independent in the 1950s and, as you can see from the attached chart where the gray indicates recessions, since then recessions have been less frequent and shorter. So because the president’s policy actions have little impact on our economy, and our credible and independent Federal Reserve system does, I’m not worried about the results in November.\n\nMore good news! Women have gained the right to vote in 97% of countries! From Our World In Data: \"A fundamental political right is choosing one’s political representatives in elections. Until recently, women did not have this right to vote in countries’ elections. Using data from political scientist Svend-Erik Skaaning and colleagues, the chart shows that neither women nor men had the universal right to vote almost anywhere until the middle of the 19th century. Then a gap in political participation opened: men gained voting rights in some countries, while women remained mostly excluded. New Zealand became the first exception to this, where women gained the universal right to vote in 1893. The gap between women and men further opened in the early 20th century, as women gained the right to vote in more countries, but men’s voting rights [disseminated] even farther. By the beginning of World War II, men had the right to vote in 1 out of 3 countries, while women only had the right to vote in 1 out of 6 countries. The gap rapidly closed in the decades after World War II, when the voting-rights discrimination against women ended in many countries, and both women and men gained the right to vote in many others.\" Good news indeed!\n\nIf you had owned NVIDIA in January 2023 and held it until today you would have made over 6x your money. Humble brag: All of my clients with invested portfolios owned NVIDIA over this time period. What???? Dan, you might say, are you some type of brilliant security analyst? Did your Harvard MBA and CFA knowledge teach you you know how to pick them? What’s your next suggestion to make me uber rich in just a year and a half? Here’s the suggestion – it’s called diversifying. Yes, my clients owned NVIDIA. They also owned around 15,000 other individual securities, all through funds. Knowing which securities are going to sextuple in the next year is very difficult, virtually impossible. But if you own a broad diversified portfolio of global securities, you can ensure you own the securities that are going to earn those results, no matter where or when they occur.\n\nMore good news! Rates of worldwide literacy are the highest they've ever been and are continuing to grow! From Our World in Data: \"While the earliest forms of written communication date back to about 3,500-3,000 BCE, for centuries literacy remained a very restricted technology closely associated with the exercise of power. It was only during the Middle Ages that book production started growing, and literacy among the general population slowly started becoming important in the Western World. While the ambition of universal literacy in Europe was a fundamental reform born from the Enlightenment, it took centuries for it to happen. It was only in the 19th and 20th centuries that rates of literacy approached universality in early-industrialized countries. The following visualization presents estimates of world literacy from the early nineteenth century until the current day. As we can see, literacy rates grew constantly but rather slowly until the beginning of the twentieth century. The rate of growth really climbed after the middle of the 20th century, when the expansion of basic education became a global priority.\" Good news, indeed!\n\nThough LinkedIn won't tell you, today, Thursday, June 27, 2024, marks my eight year anniversary at Equitable Advisors. I plan on staying forever. This is because I strongly believe in Equitable Advisors’ mission – to provide for the financial security of our clients, improving their future lives through goals-based planning and providing them with the personalized strategies and products they need today. Most of our clients are “regular people,” who have assets that may not meet some investment firms qualifications. I believe it’s the protection products that really make a difference in their lives: The life and disability income insurance that allows the potential for families to maintain their standard of living in the event of death or disability of a breadwinner. The various retirement plans for retirees that provide an additional source of income besides social security. The long term care insurance that allows them to live the last few years of their lives on their own terms, and ideally in their own homes, rather than a state Medicaid facility. In short, at Equitable Advisors I am solving “real people’s real problems.” It’s the direct human impact we have as advisors that gets me up and motivated to work every day. Another reason I’ll stay at Equitable Advisors is because of the outstanding caliber of the people I get to work with. The most prominent in my work life is my business partner, Cicely Jones, who teaches me every day what it means to be a professional. She combines an impressive depth of knowledge of financial planning and a constant hunger to learn more, with her strong emotional intelligence and ability to connect with clients to better understand both their financial concerns and dreams. Additionally, I can serve my clients’ best interests because of our open architecture. Our platform gives me the freedom of an independent to help put the client in personalized investment or insurance products. Finally, I have the resources behind me of one of the country’s largest financial services firms. Extensive training, product specialists, advanced markets team to help plan, compliance, HR, legal, IT, licensing coordinators, etc. With the people, the support systems, and, most importantly, my alignment with the company’s mission, Equitable Advisors is where I plan to stay to celebrate decades more work anniversaries.\n\nMore good news! The price of lighting has gone down 14,000 fold since the year 1300! From Our World in Data: \"In the last two centuries, the price of lighting has decreased drastically. You can see this in the chart, which plots historical data from Roger Fouquet and Peter Pearson. To allow for comparisons over time, the data is adjusted for inflation and expressed in prices for the year 2000. In the 1300s, one million lumen-hours — a standard lighting measure — would have cost around £40,800 in 2000 prices. By 2006, this had fallen to £2.90, a 14,000-fold decline. Innovations in lighting appliances, fuels, infrastructures, and institutions during the 19th and 20th centuries made this progress possible. To put this in perspective, consider that a standard 100-watt incandescent light bulb today can emit about 1,700 lumens. Therefore, running one such bulb for 24 hours would produce about 50,000 lumen-hours. That means that 1 million lumen-hours today would require continuously keeping a standard 100-watt incandescent bulb on for about 25 days. Achieving the same amount of light with candles would require burning more than 100 candles every day for that period. Most people today take the ability to switch on a light at night for granted. But those who live or have lived without artificial light can appreciate how important it is.\" To illustrate further, as Steven Pinker writes: \"A Babylonian in 1750 BCE would have had to labor fifty hours to spend one hour reading his cuneiform tablets by a sesame ol lamp....and in 1994, a half-second (of labor) for the same hour from a compact fluorescent bulb...\" Additionally, from Pinker, \"These days (and nights), if you aren't reading, conversing, getting out, or otherwise edifying yourself, it's not because you can't afford the light.\" Good news, indeed!\n\nA Few Thoughts on AI and Financial Advisors: I don’t think AI will usurp my role as a financial advisor any time soon, let’s say at least not in my lifetime and probably never. This is because clients are essentially paying to talk to me, a human being, about some of the most sensitive issues in their lives, including their goals and dreams and how to implement those through their finances. I don’t believe this role can be replaced by a bot. (Though if you’ve read some good research on if this can, or is happening, please send my way.) One indication of the value that clients put on financial advisors is that the fees they are willing to pay us have not declined, even with the rise of “robo-advisors.” A robo-advisor is “a digital platform that provides automated, algorithm-driven financial planning and investment services with little to no human supervision.” Now fees for investing funds on average have declined by almost two thirds since 2002 (from 0.91% in 2002 to 0.37% in 2022, according to Morningstar). But for the advisory fee - or what a financial advisor charges - according to a study by Kitces.com, “there is little evidence of fees declining despite the continued growth of lower-cost advisory platforms; in fact, as financial advisors bolster their value propositions beyond the portfolio alone, advice fees (both minimum and median) appear to be on the rise.” https://lnkd.in/eAyUWb3j And even robo-advisors were never meant to replace human advisors, as Andy Rachleff, former CEO and current Chairman of Wealthfront once wrote to me. Andy said that robos were only for people who didn’t meet human advisors minimums. Well, guess what? I don’t have a minimum.\n\nMore good news! Human Rights have improved in all world regions over the last century! From Our World in Data: \"Human rights are much better protected in all world regions than a century ago, according to data by Varieties of Democracy. This recently updated chart shows an index that captures human rights. The index ranges from 0 (least rights) to 1 (most). As you can see, every world region scored significantly higher in 2023 than 100 years ago. Although progress has not been steady, and there have been setbacks — including in recent years — the overall improvements have been substantial. These trends remain when giving more weight to countries with larger populations. While progress has been made in all world regions, there are still big disparities across them, with Africa and Asia lagging behind. And the strong protections on other continents show that further global progress is possible.\" Good news, indeed!"
