        "text": "Well welcome to a brand-new setter, Beck, who has given us a very gentle opening QC which took me less than 10 minutes to crack, including plenty of time looking for the correct parsing for 24a. I expect to see some fast times from our experienced solvers, and smiles of joy from our newbies, and possibly some PBs.\n\nI think my favourite must be 13a, although the three nautical references at 3d, 5d and 6d were right up my street.\n\nI did wonder when solving 9d whether Beck is a pseudonym for our regular porcine Setter. Whatever the case, welcome to the pack Beck, and we look forward to more of your offerings.\n\nAcross\n\n1 Chap recalled skill: something frequently repeated (6)\n\nMANTRA – MAN (chap) and ART (skill) reversed (recalled).\n\n4 Effect of legislation introduced by one politician (6)\n\nIMPACT – ACT (legislation) after I (one) and MP (politician). ‘Introduced by’ is an indicator to put the I MP at the front.\n\n8 I’m unable to comply with prisoner being sent back with nothing (2,3,2)\n\nNO CAN DO – CON (prisoner) reversed (being sent back) AND (with) O (nothing).\n\n10 Japanese food coming with S American greeting (5)\n\nSUSHI – S (S) and US (American) and HI (greeting).\n\n11 Spirit of good army (5)\n\nGHOST – G{ood} and HOST {army}.\n\n12 Annoyed born Democrat was ahead of things (7)\n\nNEEDLED – NEE (born) D{emocrat} and LED (was ahead of things).\n\n13 Get off sled, as it were, in heavy rainfall? (6)\n\nDELUGE – To DE LUGE might be described as to get off sled.\n\n15 Hasten to change capital (6)\n\nATHENS – Anagram (to change) of [HASTEN]\n\n18 Football player with reward for waiting? Fancy shoe (7)\n\nWINGTIP – WING (football player) and TIP (reward for waiting – at table). My Chambers gives Wingtip – a brogue shoe in which the toecap extends back and to the sides…\n\n19 Mischievous and somewhat self-involved (5)\n\nELFIN – Hidden word in {s}ELF-IN{volved}.\n\n21 Embarrass a party (5)\n\nABASH – A and BASH (party).\n\n22 Toreros carved up bird (7)\n\nROOSTER – Anagram (carved up) of [TOREROS].\n\n23 Busybodies getting silverware returned (6)\n\nSNOOPS – SPOONS (silverware) reversed (returned).\n\n24 Maybe Laurel’s recited a piece of poetry (6)\n\nSTANZA – This took me an age to see the parsing, despite getting the answer quickly. It is Stan Laurel of course, and Stan’s A (as recited or spoken) sounds like STANZA (piece of poetry). In a spirit of full disclosure and transparency, I took so long to connect Stan and Laurel that I invented an alternative parsing, which never quite satisfied me. STANZA sounds a little like ‘stands a’, and a stand can be a young tree left standing, which could be (maybe) a laurel. It was Mrs R that made the right connection for me in the end.\n\nDown\n\n1 Fellow got older and coped (7)\n\nMANAGED – MAN (fellow) and AGED (got older).\n\n2 Chip in spinach omelette (5)\n\nNACHO – Hidden word in {spi}NACH O{melette}.\n\n3 Be an efficient controller of this unit: graph organised (3, 1, 5, 4))\n\nRUN A TIGHT SHIP – Anagram (organised) of [THIS UNIT: GRAPH].\n\n5 Rampaging mobs hesitated and lost an opportunity (6, 3, 4)\n\nMISSED THE BOAT – Anagram (rampaging) of [MOBS HESITATED].\n\n6 Pardon sailor to work things out (7)\n\nABSOLVE – AB (Able Bodied sailor) and SOLVE (work things out).\n\n7 Proved trustworthy (5)\n\nTRIED – Double definition, the second as in TRIED and trusty.\n\n9 Squeal, having zero stuff to write with (4)\n\nOINK – O (zero) and INK (stuff to write with).\n\n14 New joke penned in the toilet back in the day (4,3)\n\nLONG AGO – N{ew} and GAG (joke) inside (penned in the) LOO (toilet).\n\n16 Belted out revolutionary song making wine drink (7)\n\nSANGRIA – SANG (belted out) and AIR (song) reversed (revolutionary).\n\n17 Starts to shred packaging after receiving box (4)\n\nSPAR – Initial letters (starts) to Shred Packaging After Receiving..\n\n18 Covers hip-hop songs on the radio (5)\n\nWRAPS – Homophone (on the radio) – sounds like RAPS (hip-hop songs).\n\n20 Fount damaged mattress (5)"
