        "text": "Politics is rife with rumors, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. According to Oliver and Wood (Reference Oliver and Wood2014), over 50% of Americans endorse some sort of political conspiracy. Such beliefs are prevalent and persistent, even in the face of contradictory information (Nyhan and Reifler Reference Nyhan and Reifler2010). What is more, the proclivity to adopt incorrect beliefs cuts across demographic traits, political characteristics, and nationalities (Gentzkow and Shapiro Reference Gentzkow and Shapiro2004; Goertzel Reference Goertzel1994; Zonis and Joseph Reference Zonis and Joseph1994).\n\nIn short, conspiratorial beliefs are widespread. Furthermore, individuals often subscribe to multiple conspiracy theories (Krouwel et al. Reference Krouwel, Kutiyski, van Prooijen, Martinsson and Markstedt2017). Indeed, one of the best predictors of endorsing a particular conspiracy is an individual's belief in other conspiracies (Lewandowsky, Oberauer, and Gignac Reference Lewandowsky, Oberauer and Gignac2013; Swami et al. Reference Swami, Rebecca, Stefan, Jakob, Adrian, Sherry and Martin2011; Reference Swami, Jakob, Ulrich S., Ingo W., Stefan and Martin2013). It is perhaps for this reason that existing scholarship on conspiracies and political information has tended to focus on what underlies conspiratorial thinking, or the general propensity to subscribe to conspiracy theories. This work has identified a number of fundamental traits, predispositions, and contextual factors that are generally associated with the endorsement of conspiracy theories (e.g., Miller, Saunders, and Farhart Reference Miller, Saunders and Farhart2016; Oliver and Wood Reference Oliver and Wood2014; Swami Reference Swami2012).\n\nHere, we argue that not all political rumors are sustained by the same underlying set of beliefs. Specifically, we focus on doubts about President Barack Obama's birthplace, also known as the birther rumor. We posit that conspiracies like the birther rumor are uniquely associated with attitudes toward the group of which the target of the rumor is a member. In particular, we show that the birther rumor is most likely to be adopted by white Americans who possess negative attitudes toward blacks. But we also suggest that like other conspiracy theories, the propensity to believe the birther rumor is a function of individuals’ motivations and abilities to protect these group attitudes and their partisan identities. Our findings, therefore, synergize extant work, some of which has found that the birther rumor is significantly linked with racial attitudes (Pasek et al. Reference Pasek, Stark, Krosnick and Tompson2014; Tesler and Sears Reference Tesler and Sears2010), with research on conspiratorial thinking more generally, which finds that incorrect beliefs are more strongly held among partisans and political sophisticates (Miller, Saunders, and Farhart Reference Miller, Saunders and Farhart2016). In short, we find, somewhat counterintuitively, that it is racially conservative and highly knowledgeable Republicans who are most skeptical of Obama's birthplace.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results presented here replicate and synthesize prior research on conspiratorial thinking generally with results from studies of support for the birther rumor about Barack Obama in particular. Much of the previous research examining the psychological underpinnings of conspiracy theories does not consider the potential role of group attitudes. Here, we focused solely on whites, with the expectation that because of the birther rumor's racialized nature, whites’ attitudes toward blacks would be of special importance. Indeed, we find, as have others, that racial animus is significantly associated with whites’ propensity to adopt the birther rumor. Such attitudes are not, however, brought to bear on a non-racialized conspiracy theory like the death panel rumor.\n\nWe also add an important nuance to our claim about the importance of group attitudes in conspiratorial thinking by investigating the relative effect of political knowledge and partisanship. We argue, consistent with prior work on motivated reasoning, that individuals ought to be predisposed to accept political information that is consistent with not only their pre-existing partisan beliefs, but also with their group attitudes. What is more, we suggested that it ought to be those who are more politically sophisticated who are most motivated and capable of processing conspiratorial information in this way. Thus, the partisan aspects of the birther rumor, coupled with its racialized nature, meant that we anticipated that a particular set of political sophisticates ought to have been most likely to endorse this conspiracy theory. Indeed, we find that it is racially resentful Republicans with higher levels of political knowledge who are most likely to adopt the rumor.\n\nOur work, however, does not merely re-emphasize the importance of group attitudes when it comes to conspiratorial thinking. It also raises an important point about treating conspiratorial thinking similarly to the way we think about other types of public opinion, as scholars argue we should. If we are to do so, we must not only take group attitudes into account, but we must also consider the possibility that different groups might accept or reject certain conspiracy theories at different rates depending on their in-group identities and out-group attitudes. Thus, just like other forms of public opinion, we might not expect all racial groups to take up rumors at the same rate or for the same reasons. As a result, moving forward, scholars and pollsters should consider examining subscription to some conspiracy theories separately by subgroup populations, particularly when such rumors implicate group identities or group hostilities. We note that this is a challenging task. Research in this area may currently be limited by a number of factors, which often do not co-occur in a single data collection: the relatively small sample sizes of non-white population groups in most national surveys, the lack of measures of affect toward “other” groups, and belief in specific rumors or conspiracy theories that might have a specific relevance for that group and not others. Nevertheless, when it comes to the endorsement of conspiracy theories and political rumors, our results here speak to the potential importance of taking group attitudes and identities into account."
