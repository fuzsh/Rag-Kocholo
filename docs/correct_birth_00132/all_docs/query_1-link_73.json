        "text": "Spoon and MGMT Make Hollywood Bowl Debuts\n\nSATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, AT 7 PM\n\nTICKETS ON SALE MAY 10\n\nLos Angeles native and prolific rock inventor Beck plays his biggest hometown headline show to date on September 20 at the Hollywood Bowl. Spoon and MGMT also perform and make their venue debuts.\n\nBeck hits the road this year in support of a new album planned for release this summer. Beck is close to completing sessions with producer Brian “Danger Mouse” Burton, his first collaboration with the Gnarls Barkley/Gorillaz veteran. The record is the first since Beck’s Grammy-nominated digital single “Timebomb.” The new songs also mark the first new material Beck has written since 2006’s universally acclaimed The Information and 2005’s platinum Guero.\n\nBeck describes the new set as the most concise collection of music he's ever created. \"The goal was 10 songs, 30 minutes, every song over before you want it to be. No fast-forward material. Anything that gave us any trouble was scrapped. There's no fat on this record whatsoever.\"\n\nAustin, Texas-based rock outfit Spoon makes their only summer appearance in Los Angeles for this special one-night-only concert. Indie-electronic duo MGMT opens the show and performs in support of their first full-length album, Oracular Spectacular, an enigmatic and prophetic collection of hallucinatory sounds and hook-riddled pop tones.\n\nOne of the largest natural amphitheaters in the world, with a seating capacity of nearly 18,000, the HOLLYWOOD BOWL has been the summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic since its official opening in 1922, and in 1991 gave its name to the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, a resident ensemble that has filled a special niche in the musical life of Southern California. The 2004 season introduced audiences to a revitalized Hollywood Bowl, featuring a newly-constructed shell and stage and the addition of four stadium screens enhancing stage views in the venue. To this day, $1 buys a seat at the top of the Bowl for many of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's concerts. While the Bowl is best known for its sizzling summer nights, during the day California's youngest patrons enjoy \"SummerSounds: Music for Kids at the Hollywood Bowl,\" the Southland's most popular summer arts festival for children, now in its 39th season. Attendance figures over the past several decades have soared: in 1980 the Bowl first topped the half-million mark and close to one million admissions have been recorded. In February 2007, the Hollywood Bowl was named Best Major Outdoor Concert Venue for the third year in a row at the 18th Annual Pollstar Concert Industry Awards; the Bowl's summer music festival has become as much a part of a Southern California summer as beaches and barbecues, the Dodgers, and Disneyland.\n\nEDITORS PLEASE NOTE:\n\nSATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2008, AT 7 PM\n\nHOLLYWOOD BOWL, 2301 N. Highland Ave. in Hollywood\n\nBECK\n\nSPOON\n\nMGMT\n\nTickets ($20 - $75) are on sale May 10 at HollywoodBowl.com, at the Hollywood Bowl Box Office (Tuesday–Saturday, 12 p.m.–6 p.m.), or by calling Ticketmaster at 213.480.3232, and at all Ticketmaster outlets.
