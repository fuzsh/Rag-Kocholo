        "text": "Birthday Highlight:\n\nBeck David Hansen — born Bek David Campbell in Los Angeles on July 8, 1970 — is 54 today. Best known as a Grammy-award-winning American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his experimental and lo-fi style, and became known for creating musical collages of wide-ranging genres. He has musically encompassed folk, funk, soul, hip-hop, electronic, alternative rock, country, and psychedelia. He plays 12 instruments, including guitar, keyboard, banjo, sitar, drums, and more. Beck has released 14 studio albums (three of which were released on indie labels), as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music. His latest studio album was 2019’s Hyperspace, but he’s been busy collaborating with Gorillaz, the Chemical Brothers, Phoenix, and Hinds in recent years.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1954 - Dewey Phillips of Memphis' WHBQ radio played a new song, \"That's Alright Mama\", and its flip, \"Blue Moon Of Kentucky\", on his Red Hot & Blue R&B show. An instant hit, the song was immediately played 14 more times. Callers to the station insisted that the singer, a local boy named Elvis Presley, must be a black man. Elvis himself, who knew of the airplay in advance, hid out at a local movie, but response was so immediate and positive that Dewey tracked him down for a live radio interview later that evening.\n\n1958 - The first Gold Record presented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was awarded to the soundtrack of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma. The honor signified that the album had reached $1 million in sales.\n\n1967 - The Monkees began a 29-date tour with The Jimi Hendrix Experience as their supporting act. Hendrix was dropped six shows later after being told his act was not suitable for their audience, which consisted mostly of teenage pop fans.\n\n1968 - Pink Floyd kicked off their first 20-date North American tour at the Kinetic Playground in Chicago.\n\n1969 - Singer/actress Marianne Faithfull, girlfriend of Mick Jagger, attempted suicide with barbiturates while on the set of the film \"Ned Kelly\" (also starring Mick). She was dropped from the cast of the movie, eventually recovered, and when waking from her coma, told friends that \"wild horses couldn't drag me away.\" The Rolling Stones song \"Wild Horses\" was built around that phrase.\n\n1970 - The Everly Brothers Show started an eleven-week prime time slot on ABC television. It began as a summer replacement in 1970 for The Johnny Cash Show.\n\n1972 - Bill Withers started a three-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Lean On Me,\" his only No. 1 hit.\n\n1978 - Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon of The Clash were arrested for being drunk and disorderly after a concert at the Apollo in Glasgow.\n\n1978 - After a Disco-rific six months at No. 1, the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack was finally bumped off the top spot by Gerry Rafferty's City To City.\n\n1981 - The Go-Go's released their debut album, Beauty and the Beat. The album went on to peak at No. 1 on the U.S. charts, and remained there for six consecutive weeks. The album sold in excess of 3 million copies and reached triple platinum status, making it one of the most successful debut albums ever. The Go-Go's have sold more than 7 million albums. The band is about to begin their Farewell Tour, but sadly, they do not have any stops scheduled in Minnesota.\n\n1995 - TLC started a seven-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Waterfalls,\" the group's signature song and second U.S. No. 1. The song was written by band member Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes with Marqueze Etheridge and Organized Noize for TLC's second album, CrazySexyCool. The song tackles issues of illegal drug trade and HIV/AIDS. BMG noted that \"Waterfalls\" was the first No. 1 song ever to reference AIDS in one of its verses. The song's music video reflected its socially conscious lyrics and with a million-dollar budget, the video was an MTV staple credited for giving the single much of its success.\n\n2002 - Michael Jackson spoke out against the music industry's treatment of artists, alleging that the business was rife with racism. Speaking at a civil rights meeting in New York, Jackson claimed there was a 'conspiracy' among record companies, especially towards black artists.\n\n2007 - Prince was forced off stage by Minneapolis Police halfway through his set at First Avenue. The club was only allowed to stay open until 3 a.m., and Prince went onstage at 2:45. Before his appearance at First Avenue, Prince had already played two shows in Minneapolis: the first was at the downtown location of Macy's department store, where Prince promoted his new fragrance with a nine-song, 45-minute set; the second was his concert at Target Center, just across the street from First Avenue.\n\n2016 - Drake was at No. 1 on the U.S. chart with his fourth studio album Views. With Views, Drake also joined Adele, Michael Buble and Taylor Swift as the only artists in the 2010s to have an album remain at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for six consecutive weeks.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nLouis Jordan, saxophonist known as “King of the Jukebox,” was born today in 1908.\n\nBilly Eckstine was born today in 1914.\n\nJohnnie Johnson, who played with Chuck Berry, was born today in 1924.\n\nJerry Vale (“You Don’t Know Me”) was born today in 1930.\n\nSteve Lawrence, of Steve and Eydie, was born today in 1935.
