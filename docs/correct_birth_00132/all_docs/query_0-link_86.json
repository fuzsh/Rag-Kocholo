        "text": "I majored in Psychology and have a minor in creative writing (I dream of one day being published). I grew up in foster care and thank my experience everyday for helping me recognize when I can be more compassionate and understanding in my everyday life. I moved away when I was 17 to go to college in San Francisco. It was a challenging time but also the best thing I think I could have ever done for myself. My mother passed when I was young and I raised my two younger sisters pretty much on my own. They are everything to me. All that I am today, I have raising them to thank for.I recently got married at the Madonna Inn to the most amazing human I have ever known and it was pure magic. I pride myself on living a life that forever strives to create the space for individuals to be seen, welcomed and respected. When I am not working I spend my time literally doing anything and everything with my spouse."
