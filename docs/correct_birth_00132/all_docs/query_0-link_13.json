        "text": "Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell, July 8, 1970), known by the stage name Beck, is an American musician, singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Beck rose to fame in the early 1990s with his lo-fi, sonically experimental style, and he became well known for creating musical collages of a wide range of styles. His later recordings encompass folk, funk, soul, hip hop, alternative rock, country and psychedelia. Beck has released ten studio albums, as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music. Born in Los Angeles in 1970, Beck discovered hip hop and folk music in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to New York City in 1989 and became involved in the city's small but intense anti-folk movement. After returning to his hometown in the early 1990s, he cut his breakthrough single \"Loser\", which became a worldwide hit in 1994. His 1996 release Odelay produced hit singles, topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the stripped-down Mutations in 1998, and the funk-infused Midnite Vultures in 1999. The downcast, acoustic Sea Change (2002) showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005's Guero returned to sample-based production. The Information (2006) was inspired by electro-funk and hip hop, and Modern Guilt (2008), likewise, by 1960s music. In February 2014, Beck released the album Morning Phase.\n\n[]\n\nWhen Beck's \"Loser\" track became a world wide hit in 1994, Peel started to delve into Beck's past discography and would regularly play material from his indie label days before he signed to Geffen (as did Nirvana). At the end of 1994 Peel accurately predicted that, contrary to common belief at the time, Beck was not a one hit wonder. After playing his song \"Loser\" on the 1994 Festive Fifty, Peel stated on 23 December 1994:\n\n\"Destined to be thought of as a one-hit wonder, I suspect, but I think there's more to it than that.\"\n\nFestive Fifty Entries[]\n\n1994 Festive Fifty: Loser #32\n\nLive[]\n\nRecorded at the Reading Festival: 1995-08-25.
