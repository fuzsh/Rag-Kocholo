        "text": "What is your name?\n\nBeck Pete\n\nWhat is your genre of music?\n\nMy music falls where Indie-Pop, Rock N’ Roll and Soul music meet.\n\nGive us a little bio about you.\n\nThrough the combination of emotional turmoil, heartbreak, a whole bunch of nights consisting of dance-inducing backbeats, deafening silence, and true elation, Beck Pete was born. If you follow the intricate, hook-y melodies and production of the indie-pop genre, until you find where they intersect with the emotional vulnerability, intensity and desperation of soul music, you will find Beck. She will be looking you right in the eyeballs, telling you every inch of her truth.\n\nAnd tell her truth she has — After less than two years in Los Angeles, Beck has spilled her heart for an increasing number of eyes, packing historic venues across the city, including The Hotel Café, which has become a second home for the artist, and most recently, co-headlining the iconic Troubadour.\n\nShe is excited to continue releasing music that showcases sides of love and the human condition that others often avoid.\n\nWhat made you go in to music?\n\nMy mom signed me up for a musical at 4 years old. I immediately fell in love with the art of singing and performance and how it made me feel. I don’t know if I necessarily had a choice in the matter, but I’m almost glad I didn’t.\n\nAre you a signed?\n\nNope, completely independent!\n\nYou release your new single “Gently Break It” tell us more about it.\n\nGently Break It’ thematically sheds light on a situation that is all too common romantically, where a person convinces themselves that they are undeserving of love and therefore romanticizes the idea of playing a victim in an unhealthy relationship. I have been that girl, and can’t say that I won’t be again. I’m just hoping that this song serves a reminder of that tendency, and spreads awareness to everyone who hears it that, one, they are not alone in this cycle and two, they can break it by believing they are worthy of something positive and healthy.\n\nWhat was the writing process like?\n\nWhen I start writing songs for myself, they generally start at my piano (Ellie). I remember word-vomitting this chorus in a little under 5 minutes and playing it over and over for almost an entire night. I worked on the rest with two other writers, Desi Valentine and Rich Jacques, who helped form the rest of it with me. I remember leaving that day and feeling like this song was special. It felt honest and vulnerable, but still had just enough pop edge to get the message heard. I still feel that way.\n\nWhat was the recording process like? / Who did you work on the Single with?\n\nI worked one on one with Ben Matin for the majority of the formation of this song. Ben was a phenomenal/honest artist and closet producer, who took this on as a learning experience and a passion project. I wanted to have a hand in everything for once- the sounds for the synths, what parts were played for every instrument, and everything from what kick add in, to how quickly the synth went from a low buzz to an overwhelming blanket of sound in your ears. He was okay with that, and was excited by the collaboration. We would spend 10-12 hours a day in the studio in his home with the curtains closed and one candle in the vocal booth and incense burning the entire time to create a very specific energy for creation making sure we were proud of what we made.\n\nGently Break It was finished and mixed by mixing engineer, and good friend, Ryan Gilligan who added very specific, contemporary/pop elements to the songs that made them unique in the current musical landscape. Ryan had worked on the Kevin Garrett “False Hope” album, which had served as a huge inspiration for me, and really showed that he had an understanding of creating a sonic picture that the listener could get lost in. I knew he was my guy and I couldn’t be more happy with his contribution to the song.\n\nJoe LaPorta from Sterling Sound mastered the songs, and really just elevated everything. Joe has worked on a wide variety of projects including Shawn Mendes’ most recent album, Leon Bridges’ “Coming Home” album, and Imagine Dragons’ album “Night Visions” just to name a few– and knew exactly what was needed to make them both feel finished.\n\nWhat message are you trying to get out?\n\nIn a world where strength is encouraged, and expression of feeling has been painted as the opposite of strength, I’m over here arguing that one cannot exist without the other. There is this idea that we always have to be “okay,” or that we will not be well-received. It is my opinion that we are strongest when we are honest with ourselves, and with others. I know that I can offer all of those things in tandem to the world– Vulnerability. Honesty. Strength. Hopefully that will be the story that others tell about me one day. For now, that is the story I tell about myself. That is why I’m here and that is why I do what I do. To serve as a reminder of how important those things are.\n\nCan we expect an EP or album this year and if so can we have a teaser?\n\nI am constantly working on music… An album might be coming and it might be live and it might be all about the rollercoaster progression of an unconventional relationship… but I’ll never tell.\n\nDo you have gigs coming up or a tour in planning? / If so where are you thinking of heading?\n\nI play once every month or two in Los Angeles, and my shows are always listed on my website (https://beckpete.com) for anyone in that area. As for other areas, I am heading to London this fall, dates are still TBD but I cannot wait!!!\n\nDo you have any collaborations coming up with any up coming artists? Would you be up for collaborations if other musicians wanted one with you? and who would they have to contact?\n\nMy primary focus right now will be on a solo album, but I am always excited to connect with other artists! Anyone interested can contact through my website (https://beckpete.com).\n\nWhat else do you have planned this year?\n\nI decided that this year for me would be about releasing my first music as “Beck Pete” and creating a foundation. For the remainder of the year, my main focus will be on creating a larger body of work to release and filling in the gaps of who I am. Too many stories to tell to keep them all in!\n\nDo you play any instruments?\n\nI play elementary guitar and piano but not enough to call myself a “player.” That I’m working on. I’d love to play shows all over the world the way they are supposed to be heard by myself. And I will. Excited to answer this question again in a few years.\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nLEON. Lianne La Havas. Moses Sumney. Alabama Shakes. Matt Corby. At the end of the day, any artist who puts feeling first.\n\nWhich TV channel would you like one of your songs to be played on?\n\nI would like my songs to be played on any and all TV channels, pretty please.\n\nHow do you get inspiration to write songs?\n\nFor my own project, I am mostly a muse based writer, and I am most inspired by love. Luckily I have big feelings and have a lot of that to give.\n\nWhere do you see yourself now in 5 Years?\n\nDoing what I’m doing now but reaching more people and playing larger stages.\n\nWhen you’re not doing music, what do you do?\n\nThink about doing music, mostly. Eat ice cream. Run to counteract said ice cream.\n\nWhat was the song you listened to most that influenced you to go more into the music scene?\n\nAlmost Lover- A Fine Frenzy\n\nWhat’s the best advice you have ever been given?\n\nLean in to fear.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring musicians not about the industry and just as an artist?\n\nGet to know yourself.\n\nWhat quote or saying do you always stick by?\n\nStrength and vulnerability can only exist in tandem.\n\nWhere in your hometown is a must go to visit?\n\nAre we talking HOMETOWN hometown? If we’re talking little old Vacaville, California, then probably the outlets. That’s what we’re famous for. If we’re talking Los Angeles, you better make it to The Hotel Cafe. Perfect energy always, consistent talent, special history.\n\nYour coming off tour;\n\n1/ Where do you go first? In N Out Burger\n\n2/ Who do you see first? The drive thru employee at In N Out Burger\n\n3/ What do you eat first? In N Out Burger\n\nWhen you are at a gig, what are 5 things you cannot forget?\n\nHeadphones (If needed to travel to a far off land to center myself before a set)\n\nGuitar (Normally use my guitar player’s guitar- this is more for practice)\n\nCapo (Just in case)\n\nRevlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor in HD Kisses (Every. Time.)\n\nFeelings (Duh)\n\nDo you have any social media so fans can keep up to date with your news?\n\nWhat is your names? Calliope Wren What is your genre of music? Alternative Pop / Pop Rock Give us a little bio about you.Long Island, Born and Raised Singer, Songwriter, Performer, and\n\nWhat are your names?Alexandra Bråten and Jo Frøytlog What is the band’s name?Draumir How did you come up with the band’s name?“Draumir” is actually a made-up word that doesn’t exist"
