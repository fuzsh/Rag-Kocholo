        "text": "As Beck and his band jammed through their usual end-of-show medley on Wednesday, the Los Angeles native looked out at the crowd that packed the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre for this intimate hometown gig and noted how casually personal the night had turned out.\n\n“We’re just having fun right now,” he said after keyboardist Roger Manning Jr. channeled a bit of Michael McDonald and the Doobie Brothers’ “Takin’ It to the Streets,” one in a series of band spotlights that this time included guitarist Jason Falkner leading a tribute to the late Tom Petty with a spin through “American Girl.”\n\n“This isn’t even a show anymore,” Beck continued. “It’s just a get-together.”\n\nBut oh, what a terrific get-together it was. Scheduled just a week ago as a part of a handful of shows celebrating the release of the new album “Colors,” the combination of Beck under the stars at the Ford with a lot of his friends and family and longtime fans among the lucky 1,200 in the theater created a casual, fun, party vibe throughout a set that spread 22 songs across nearly two hours.\n\nUnlike the album-release show in London on Thursday that opened softly with a selection of mellower gold at the Ford on Wednesday, Beck and the band rocked out from the get-go, opening the night with grimy, grinding rock and the pairing of “Devil’s Haircut” and “Black Tambourine.”\n\nFrom there the set shifted almost in sections through the many different phases of the singer-songwriter’s eclectic aesthetic.\n\n“I Think I’m In Love” started off an electronic, almost-Krautrock-like New Wave tune before shifting into the disco feel of the Gorgio Moroder-created Donna Summer classic “I Feel Love.”\n\nHis period of mashing up funk and hip-hop and the studio’s kitchen sink surfaced with early career songs such as “Mixed Bizness” and “Qué Onda Güero,” the latter getting one of the biggest responses from the crowd in the early going.\n\nClearly having a good time on stage, Beck also took time to chat between songs, and sometimes during them. He introduced “Soul Of A Man” with a story about an old L.A. oddball named Greek George who raised and raced camels down nearby Highland Avenue.\n\nAnd after shifting to a mini-set of acoustic guitar-driven songs off his “Sea Change” album (“Paper Tiger” and “Lost Cause”) by pointing west in the general direction of Laurel Canyon as he recalled how the classic finger-picking folk songs he learned as a young musician were always known in his circles as “canyon songs.”\n\nA four-song cluster of tracks drawn from “Colors,” his 12th studio collection, came closer to the end of the set, with “Wow,” a single from more than a year ago, and “Dreams,” a single from earlier this year familiar to fans, where the title track and “Up All Night” were strong, new dance-rock delights.\n\n“It’s like trying on a new pair of shoes, right?” he said after noting this was just just the second time he and the band had played “Colors” in concert, and only the third for “Up All Night.”\n\n“This is like an old pair of shoes,” Beck said to introduce “Loser,” his breakout single and probably still best-known hit. “It takes you where you need to go. It’ll get you there.”\n\nAnd it absolutely did, leading to one more big sing-along with the crowd on its chorus, before the band segued into a booming take on “E-Pro” to wrap up the main set.\n\n“Where It’s At” – or “Two Turntables and a Microphone” as my fingers eternally try to type it – kicked off the encore and resurfaced periodically throughout “One Foot In The Grave,” the band medley, and “Debra” to wrap things.\n\nComedian Demetri Martin opened for Beck, and while I missed his set I’m grateful for it nonetheless given the traffic jams and parking hassles of getting to the Ford on the same night that Depeche Mode was wrapping up its four nights across the way at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nBeck\n\nWhen: Wednesday, Oct. 18\n\nWhere: John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, Los Angeles\n\nNext: Beck will perform as part of the iHeartRadio ALTer Ego concert on Jan. 19 at the Forum in Inglewood along with Mumford & Sons, Cage the Elephant, the National, Spoon, Walk the Moon are more. Tickets are currently on presale at iHeartRadio.com/alterego. Remaining tickets go on sale to the general public at 1 p.m. Friday at Ticketmaster.com."
