        "text": "Introduction\n\nExpertise has been shown to have both functional and structural correlates in the human brain. For example, expert golfers show a different pattern of neural activity than novice golfers when planning shots (Milton et al., 2007), and London taxi drivers have a larger posterior hippocampal volume than matched controls (Maguire et al., 2000). It can be difficult to establish, however, the extent to which these effects relate to preexisting differences between the novice and expert groups, or whether these effects mainly arise from training-induced plasticity. Here we investigate brain anatomy in expert phoneticians—individuals who are specialized in the study of phonetics. We aimed to distinguish experience-dependent plasticity from brain structural features that existed before the onset of expertise training.\n\nPhoneticians typically spend one to four years of formal training learning to identify speech sounds and to transcribe them into an international phonetic alphabet. In many languages, there is no one-to-one correspondence between pronunciation and orthography, and narrow phonetic transcription involves parsing and identifying speech sounds so as to provide a direct correspondence between sound and symbol. Phoneticians are thus very quick and skilled at identifying even subtle regional accents. Unlike other kinds of expertise, such as musical skills, phonetic transcription skills are acquired in adulthood, and we can precisely measure the amount of phonetic transcription training and experience. This allowed us to specifically test the effects on brain structure of extensive and naturalistic training (i.e., not in the laboratory) during adulthood.\n\nTo more generally characterize brain structural features underlying this form of language expertise, we also tested for brain structural differences between phoneticians and nonexpert controls. Functional brain imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown that the posterior portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus (the left pars opercularis) and the left supramarginal gyrus are involved in and even necessary for phonological processing and for subvocal rehearsal in verbal working memory (Paulesu et al., 1993; Zatorre et al., 1996; Burton et al., 2000; Nixon et al., 2004; Gough et al., 2005; Hartwigsen et al., 2010). Further, previous findings have shown that brain structure in the left auditory cortex, the parietal cortices, and the left inferior frontal cortex partly predicts individual differences in the perception and production of foreign speech sounds in healthy nonexperts (Golestani et al., 2002, 2007; Golestani and Pallier, 2007). We thus aimed to extend these normative findings to expertise by testing for group differences in left auditory, frontal, and parietal cortex morphology between phoneticians and nonphoneticians. Findings are discussed in terms of experience-dependent plasticity and of genetic studies suggesting differential degrees of experience-dependent malleability of different brain regions.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe find complementary evidence for experience-dependent plasticity and for brain structural features that could have existed before the onset of expertise training. The effect of experience-dependent plasticity was observed in the left pars opercularis, which was also found to be larger in phoneticians than matched controls, with the amount of phonetic transcription training within the phoneticians group predicting the surface area of this region. The left pars opercularis lies within the posterior portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus, and together with the more anterior left pars triangularis, it constitutes the classic anterior Broca's speech region. Broca's area is constituted of several anatomically distinct subregions (Amunts et al., 1999; Newman et al., 2003; Gough et al., 2005; Amunts et al., 2010; Kaplan et al., 2010). It has been shown to be involved in a range of linguistic and nonlinguistic tasks, including working memory and sequencing of verbal and nonverbal information (Braver et al., 1997; Gelfand and Bookheimer, 2003), and activation in this region has been shown to be modulated by the complexity of language processing (Sharp et al., 2010). In relation to language, it has been argued that the pars triangularis is involved in semantic processing, whereas the more posterior pars opercularis is involved in phonetic processing (Buckner et al., 1995; Price et al., 1996; Fiez, 1997; Poldrack et al., 1999; Gold and Buckner, 2002; Papoutsi et al., 2009). The finding that transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left pars opercularis disrupts phonetic processing suggests that it is not only implicated but that it is necessary for phonologically based working memory mechanisms (Nixon et al., 2004; Gough et al., 2005). The pars opercularis has also been implicated in subvocal rehearsal in verbal working memory more generally (Paulesu et al., 1993; Démonet et al., 1994), and in the extraction and manipulation of phonetic segments in verbal working memory (Zatorre et al., 1996; Burton et al., 2000). This phonetic segmentation process parallels some of the demands of phonetic transcription, where the ability to effectively parse and identify phonetic segments and to provide a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols is very important. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of expertise performing this very specific linguistic task results in structural plasticity in the associated Broca's area subregion.\n\nWe also find gross morphology differences in the left auditory cortex between phoneticians and controls. Previously, we showed that faster phonetic learners have greater left transverse gyrus splitting or duplication than slower learners (Golestani et al., 2007). Here we extend this finding to an expert population and also show that the number of years of phonetic transcription training does not predict this aspect of gross morphology within the phoneticians group. Previous studies have shown transverse gyrus morphology to be normatively asymmetric, with greater likelihood of multiple transverse gyri in the right but not the left hemisphere (Pfeifer, 1920; von Economo and Horn, 1930; Beck, 1955; Campain and Minkler, 1976; Chi et al., 1977), as can be seen in our nonexpert, control group (t(15) = 1.89; p < 0.05; mean right, 1.58 ± 0.59; mean left, 1.25 ± 0.39). Other studies (Penhune et al., 1996; Warrier et al., 2009), however, have shown that the gross morphology of the transverse gyri is quite variable. Our results suggest that this variability may be explained by differences in the populations tested, ones that may in part be explained by systematic differences in domain-specific skills (Leonard et al., 2006). Specifically, we propose that relatively greater gyrification of the left transverse gyrus, which includes primary and secondary auditory cortex in the hemisphere dominant for speech, could be a neuroanatomical marker of skill (whether within normal variability or expertise) in the domain of detailed auditory processing of speech. In line with this interpretation, it has been shown that cortical gyrification at birth predicts functional outcome later in life in preterm infants (Dubois et al., 2008).\n\nAs mentioned above, the amount of transcription training did not predict the gross morphology or volume of the left transverse gyrus within the phoneticians group. It is known that the development of the transverse gyrus is established during the 31st week of gestational age, and that secondary (or tertiary) gyri appear after the 36th week of gestation (Chi et al., 1977). Also, there is no evidence, as of yet, that secondary or tertiary transverse gyri could grow during adulthood, and it has been shown that the development of the transverse gyri is stabilized by the age of seven both morphologically (Leonard et al., 1998; Preis et al., 1999) and myeologenetically (Yakovlev and Lecours, 1967). Our results therefore suggest that the left auditory cortex gross morphology differences could have existed before the onset of phonetic training. Further, it is possible that the presence of such a morphological feature may make it more likely for individuals to become phoneticians or to work in other domains requiring detailed auditory processing. In other words, the presence of such a feature may have an impact on professional specialization and on career choices. Consistent with our interpretation, genetic studies show that Broca's area morphology may be more malleable to experience than Heschl's gyrus morphology. In contrast, Heschl's gyrus shows higher heritability estimates than Broca's area (Peper et al., 2007). In other words, we have found evidence for a potential brain structural intermediate phenotype, or structural marker (Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger, 2006), not for disorder or disease, but for a domain-specific aptitude that can, with adequate opportunity and training, lead to expertise.\n\nGreater folding, or gyrification, can arise from developmental mechanisms explained by the radial unit model cortical evolution (Rakic, 1988). According to this model, a higher number of radial units, or minicolumns, results in an increase in cerebral gyrification and surface area. Greater gyrification and surface area, in turn, allow for a greater capacity for establishing new patterns of brain connectivity. This radial unit model could explain individual differences in observed local aspects of brain morphology. Thus, our observations that phoneticians have greater gyrification in the left auditory cortex and overall larger transverse gyri bilaterally could be explained by more complex patterns of brain connectivity in phoneticians compared with controls.\n\nGreater gyrification could also arise from other aspects of microstructural differences between individuals, such as ones that have been proposed to explain left > right asymmetries in core auditory regions. Here, neuronal tract tracing has revealed that there are interhemispheric differences in the organization of the intrinsic microcircuitry of the primary auditory cortex such that more functionally distinct columnar systems are included per surface unit in the left than in the right area 22 (Galuske et al., 2000).\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that extensive training with speech sound analysis, and maybe even with articulation-based approaches, can lead to plastic changes in Broca's area. This has potential implications for training-related remediation for individuals with phonological difficulties (e.g., developmental dyslexia), and in the domain of second language learning. This is in line with other studies showing, for example, that greater musical expertise starting at a young age is associated with more gray matter in the auditory cortex (Gaser and Schlaug, 2003)."
