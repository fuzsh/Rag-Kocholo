He graduated from Steubenville High School as honor student in1955, afterwards attending Ohio State University as pre-med (fraternity: Pi Kappa Alpha) and, later, University of Delaware, in Newark, DE, majoring in chemistry. Working as a chemist at Joseph Bancroft Sons Co., in Wilmington, DE, he met and married Sarah (Sally) Horner Spencer, in 1959 (they separated in 1987 and divorced in 1998). Following positions at a chemical company in Marcus Hook, PA, and as Senior Chemist at Avisun Corp., in New Castle, DE, Donald moved to Long Island, NY, with his wife and four children in 1969, joining Delta Steel Corporation, New York City (later a division of Hoesch AG of Dortmund, Germany) as Vice-President, traveling extensively on behalf of the company throughout Germany, Italy, Ireland, and Israel. In the mid-1970s, he bought several food processing factories in upstate New York (SCP Industries), eventually selling the company in the 1980s. In the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, Donald operated his sisterâ€™s Mittersill Ski Lodge in Franconia, New Hampshire. For the past 25 years, Donald, a master contract bridge player (he wrote a book on the subject) and a well-known gaming enthusiast who competed in major baccarat tournaments both in the U.S. and Europe, called Las Vegas, NV, his home. He moved to Pahrump, NV, three years ago.\n\nDonald was preceded in death by his parents and sister, Nadine Beck House, who died in 2020, in Palm Beach, FL.\n\nSurviving are his four children, J. Spencer Beck of Los Angeles, CA; John S. Beck (Miriam) of Apex, NC; Jamie Beck Jensen (Paul) of Rye, NY; James S. Beck (Linda Sherry) of Crumpton, MD; five grandchildren; and his partner for the past 30 years, Marguerite J. (Judy) Marrow.\n\nA memorial service is planned for this summer in Martins Ferry."
