Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck’s mother has died at her San Pedro home, police said Tuesday. She was 87.

Elma Beck, who was recently diagnosed with cancer, was surrounded by family and friends when she died Monday.

Born Sept. 15, 1923, in Nanaimo, Canada, Beck earned a nursing degree in 1945 and moved to Los Angeles to pursue her career.

In 1966, she earned her bachelor’s degree and teaching credential at California State University, Long Beach. She taught fifth grade for 19 years at Ramona Elementary School in Bellflower.

Beck was a lifelong athlete who competed in numerous marathons and power-lifting events. She holds a national title for power-lifting in her age and weight category. She also was an artist whose paintings are displayed in several local galleries and restaurants.

She is survived by her husband of 61 years, retired LAPD Deputy Chief George Beck, her children, Charlie and Megan; six grandchildren who are Los Angeles police officers; and one great-grandchild.
