        "text": "Vazha-Pshavela considered his date of birth to be May 15, 1862, despite this, another date is established in his biography - July 14, 1861 (old style). The basis for this is the 1861 metric book of the Church of St. George of the village of Chargli preserved in the National Archives of Georgia.\n\nThe writer devoted a special publication to this issue in the \"People's Gazette\" N584 of 1912: \"A small note\".\n\n\"If a biography is written, it should be written with the truth, moreover, the falsity should be corrected during my lifetime, because it will happen even after my death. I was born in the village in Chargali in 1862 On May 15...\"\n\nVazha-Pshavela's father, Pavle Razikashvili, was a clergyman, and his mother was Barbale (Gulkan) Pkhikelashvili.\n\nVazha-Pshavela wrote about his parents in his autobiographical work:\n\n\"I am from St. Pshaveli, both on my mother's side and on my father's side. My mother was an Ivre woman, from the village of Skhlovni, of the Phkhikliant family. He created satirical poems and even today all the people of Pshave \"poem\" to his tune; Unfortunately, he did not know how to read and write, so his works were preserved thanks to paper, although his poems are still alive today, and people sing them. These poems are full of deep humor. My mother didn't know how to read and write either, although she was very talented by nature, an excellent housewife and merciful, a good reader, a neighbor's helper; Dedi-Chem's kindness remains exemplary even today. He went to the grave in such a way that no one remembers him, no.\n\nWhen I knew my father, he was the chief deacon of the village. Magharoskar, S. Eight verses away from Chargali. Whenever he was at home, he always told me stories from the old divine history, taught me how to read and write in the old way. He would put the meat on the board as a plate for the meat, and I would also sit on the throne and listen to his sweet talk, because I liked some stories from the Old Testament, they attracted my attention: the defeat of Goliath by David, the actions of the mighty Samson, the dedication of the Maccabean brothers, etc. ... and I must also mention that my head was strongly presented to Samson, because my mother said about me that I had big hair, when I was born, it almost covered my eyes, and I used to ask: why did you braid my hair, Still, this \"hairiness\" made me think about myself, made me see myself as an extraordinary person and set an extraordinary future for me.\"\n\n\"My world\", works of Vazha-Pshavela, volume 5, 1936\n\nVazha-Pshavela received primary education in her family, and at the age of 8, \"my father enrolled me in Telavi theological school. From the third grade of this school, I entered the Civil School of Tbilisi, which is located next to the institute. After finishing the course at the civil school, I entered the seminary of Gori. When I finished my studies there, I was appointed a teacher in Toladsofel (Ertso), where I stayed for one year and then I went to St. Petersburg to listen to lectures at the university...\" (\"People's newspaper\", \"Small Note\", 1912. N584).\n\nEkvtime Takaishvili wrote in his memoirs about his studentship:\n\n\"I met Vazha-Pshavela for the first time in St. Petersburg, when I entered the university, he came as a free listener and attended a session of Georgian students on community issues. He knew by heart a poem from the folk poetry of Pshav-Khevsureti. He didn't have any notebooks or written documents in his hands and we were all amazed how he could memorize so many poems.\"\n\nLuka Razikashvili under the pseudonym L. Ra-vi appeared for the first time in 1879 in the newspaper \"Droeba\" (No. 11) with the publication \"Tserili Khevsuretidan\". This was followed by the translation of Erkman-Shatrian's story \"Feodalis Aghzrda\" (1880, \"Iveria\", No. 4).\n\nHis first poem \"Meomari\" was published in 1881 (\"Imedi\", No. 3-4), and his first short story \"Surati Pshavelis tskhovrebidan\" - in 1881 (\"Droeba\", No. 184).\n\nHis epic poems on the national theme are especially popular: \"Aluda Ketelauri\" (1888), \"Bakhtrion\" (1892), \"Stumar-Maspindzeli\" (1893), \"Gvelis Mtchameli\" (1901) and others.\n\nHumanism is a consequence of the writer's creativity. In this regard, the samples of lyrical prose are distinguished: \"Shvlis Nukri Naambobi\" (1883), \"Khmeli Tsipeli\" (1888-1889), \"Quchi\" (1892), \"Mtani Maghalni\" (1895) and others.\n\nVazha-Pshavela's stories were printed as a book for the first time in 1889. In 1896-1898, several more books were added to the first edition, including \"Amodis, Natdeba\" and \"Akhundi\", which are kept in the scientific reference library of the National Archives of Georgia.\n\nAmong the photos of Vazha-Pshavela, his picture with the legendary helmet of Ghachaura stands out. Vazha-Pshavela entrusted this legend to the reader with the story \"Aphkhusooba\":\n\n\"Khevisberi Beridze stood up in front of the hall, a man of medium build, shaped like an oak tree, with a bushy mustache, and a fierce face. Beridze spoke with a thunderous voice; In his hand he held a gold-colored, decorated and scarred helmet, cut in two by Alaga's sword, \"seeing\", Ludian helmet, which was lit with a holy candle. Beridze called out: Community and village, may God have mercy on Ghachaura! \"May God remember,\" said the people with a hearty conclusion. Ghachaura is a folk hero who is killed by a Khan and his helmet is sacrificed to the icon. Today, with this helmet, big and small ghachauras are drinking. \"It's about to be emptied, it's about to be emptied,\" shouts Dastur. If Pshaveli took off his helmet full of beer, he would turn it over and kiss the helmet, where it seems to be cracked, and he would say: \"I changed you to the right one, Vazhav!\" !\". It follows the story of the life of the old Ghachaura, the murder of Khan and the killing of captives by Apkhushoda...\n\n...Has this been the case before, Apkhusho? It was surrounded by a fortress-wall. There were people of different races; They will not give us rest if we do not drink openly, I told the enemy. Once, the Tatar army came, they destroyed the place, and killed the prisoners; I counted you on the Zhinvan bridge, said my excited uncle, I am happy, sixty men and sixty women. Well, don't watch, tell that cursed ghost, if he is either lame or blind, if he can hold a grudge against someone?! Ghachaura used to be a courtier of the king, and he had a good time capturing the Tatars, when a ball would come out in their apartment, it was a sign that the Tatars would eat bread, and when it went out, they would go to sleep. At the time of the breaking of Apkhusho, Ghachaura was at the mowing, he saw the flame of fire from there, he said that Apkhushue is in trouble, and he was released; When he arrived, Apkhusho met him in shock; One by one, you are chasing people and chasing the enemy. He is fighting against the enemy and the Khan who sits in the tent is shahrvardin inside, with an unguarded sword on his helmet; Elizbari, Ghachaurai's brother, condemns his brother: \"You fool, you use the sword like a fool.\"\n\n\"Maghla ki Nu Scem Spilosa,\n\nDabla Shamahkar Mbilosano\"\n\nYou will protect me with your tip, you will not be able to hold the iron anymore and you will kill me. You have taken a lot of gold and silver from me, you will also return the captives; This helmet was donated to the deceased. Shilindi will be held today, \"Shesandobrebs\" will be staged.\n\nVazha-Pshavela in Chargali\n\nShortly after his appointment as a teacher, Vazha-Pshavela was confronted by the father of Didi Toneti village and his relatives. They sent a number of complaints to the literacy community. The society checked the teacher's work several times. The archive preserves Luka Razikashvili's answer to Mamasakhlisi's accusations, in which he wrote: \"The great Toneti community consists of 1,200 people, let everyone, big and small, be summoned [by the literacy community] and asked.\" If, except for one, the father of the house and his brother-in-law, the prince, will speak ill of me, then I myself will renounce my craft and say that I am not fit either to be a man or a teacher... God does not please everyone, and how can I please the men who are not men? Are they causing me trouble personally and undermining the school?\"\n\nDue to this controversy, Vazha had to leave his position as a school teacher.\n\nHe lived in Chargali since 1888, engaged in agricultural activities like other peasants. He rarely went to the bar, only when he had to submit his own works for printing."
