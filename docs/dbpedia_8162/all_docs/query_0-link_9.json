Conditions and Exceptions apply.\n\nHost and Guest\n\nI\n\nVeiled in the gloom of night\n\nThe sweet face of Kisteti\n\nAppears, among hills around,\n\nA rocky throne among cliffs.\n\nThe river moans in its dark ravine\n\nTurbid, with grief at its heart.\n\nThe mountains too are bowed down,\n\nLaving face and hands in the water;\n\nOn their breasts, many have died,\n\nUnfitting is the blood on their flanks.\n\nSeeking the blood of his brother’s killer,\n\nA man travels along the road.\n\nI say a road, but what road is this:\n\nA narrow path over rock!\n\nA path that’s so hard to walk,\n\nHe can scarcely move a step.\n\nThere, the village of the Kists,\n\nIs like an eagle’s nest,\n\nAs pleasant a place to gaze on\n\nAs the breast of a woman.\n\nBlack fog slumbers about the village,\n\nIts face deep in thought,\n\nListening to the hills around,\n\nAbsorbing the scene with joy.\n\nIt’s a guest for the moment,\n\nTomorrow, it moves elsewhere;\n\nDeparting, travelling the heights,\n\nThe slopes covered with ice;\n\nIt darkens and shrouds\n\nThe visible landscape.\n\nMaking the hunter cry out,\n\nHis track lost among cliffs,\n\nBringing joy to the wolf, the thief,\n\nThose walkers in the dark.\n\nII\n\nHigh above, some stranger\n\nDislodges a rock from the cliff.\n\nThe traveller looks up,\n\nFaced by a tall mountain.\n\nHe listens….after a moment\n\nHearing the hiss of sand.\n\nHe reaches for his gun:\n\nIt might be an enemy.\n\nHe looks about feverishly,\n\nHis weapon at the ready.\n\nHe sees someone burdened\n\nWith a double-headed staff.\n\nHe was dragging its dark weight,\n\nThat’s why the sand hissed.\n\nThe stranger said not a word,\n\nNot a sound came from his mouth,\n\nThe barrel of the gun gleaming\n\nLike the dew after morning rain.\n\nHe asked: ‘What kind of man are you?\n\nWhy are you wandering here at this hour?’\n\n‘What would you have? I’m a hunter.’\n\n‘You don’t look like one to me.’\n\n‘Why should you not trust me?\n\nWhy are you suspicious?\n\nBecause I’m wandering perhaps\n\nLike you across this mountain?\n\nI am a hunter too,\n\nAnd today I’ve hunted in vain.’\n\n‘So it goes with us hunters.\n\nWould you live without trouble?’\n\n‘This also is trouble, brother,\n\nI can barely move a step,\n\nI’ve walked all these hills,\n\nI traversed every ravine;\n\nBlack fog swirled around\n\nDriven by a strong wind;\n\nIt howled through the ravines\n\nLike a famished wolf.\n\nI could barely see the road;\n\nI tried to descend the cliff,\n\nAt a loss to know the way\n\nI was struggling so fiercely.\n\nI scared the beasts near and far,\n\nI could hear their hooves clearly,\n\nI could hear the rams clashing horns\n\nAs they fled along the cliff.\n\nMy heart sank at that\n\nI could see nothing ahead;\n\nForget about the hunting,\n\nI dared not take a step forward.’\n\nThe stranger standing close by\n\nCame a little closer.\n\nThe traveller called out: ‘Hunt on, then,\n\nDon’t complain, stay calm.’\n\n‘Good hunting to you too, brother,\n\nKill a host of those agile creatures.’\n\n‘Here’s one. So why complain?’\n\nHe showed him a horned ram,\n\nLying dead, one with curving horns.\n\n‘A cunning one, but silent now.\n\nIf you want we’ll share it,\n\nEqual shares, like comrades,\n\nI’ll not take more than my own,\n\nLet’s share it justly,\n\nCome home with me tonight,\n\nMy dwelling is nearby.\n\nWhere do you come from, brother?\n\nTell me your name as well!\n\nDon’t’ worry, God has found\n\nFood for you today.\n\nYou shall have your share\n\nIn this ram I’ve slain,\n\nDon’t look surprised, it’s no jest,\n\nAnd I’m not seeking favours.\n\nIf it was not meant to be,\n\nWhy would you meet me, now?\n\nIt would be a shame\n\nIf you lost your share,\n\nWho are you? Tell me your name.\n\nYour looks seem Khesvurian.’\n\n‘I am called, Nunua, brother,\n\nA wanderer in the hills.’\n\nBut Zviadauri lied,\n\nHe concealed his true name.\n\nWhat could he do? He was notorious,\n\nHe owed a debt of blood to many Kists,\n\nHe had cut the right hand of many Kists,\n\nSent them to an untimely grave.\n\n‘Tell me your name, too,\n\nNow I have told you mine.’\n\n‘Mine is Jokhala, brother,\n\nMy last name, Alkhastaidze;\n\nIt would not do for us\n\nTo tell lies.\n\nMy house is nearby,\n\nWith doors like a fortress.\n\nCome home with me tonight,\n\nI’ll take you there myself.\n\nIf I’m not the perfect host\n\nI’ll not treat you ill, at least.\n\nTomorrow, take your own way,\n\nGo wherever you wish.\n\nI’ll tell you some of my troubles,\n\nYou can share some of yours.’\n\n‘Lead me wherever you wish, brother,\n\nI long to be there – How far is it?\n\nYou’ve cut the ram’s throat,\n\nAnd skinned its legs too.\n\nI’ll not refuse to visit,\n\nI’ll help carry the ram too\n\nI don’t ask for a share, you know,\n\nI’d not dishonour myself like that.’\n\nBetween them they skinned the ram,\n\nAnd carried it to the house,\n\nThey exchanged many stories,\n\nGrew acquainted as they went.\n\nIII\n\nThe turrets came in sight,\n\nDogs were barking;\n\nFrom the doorways\n\nCurious children were gazing;\n\nThe stone-built houses\n\nSeemed like giant boulders.\n\n‘Look, here are my family,\n\nMy fortress, my home;\n\nWelcome, as brother to brother,\n\nAs godson to godfather.’\n\nJokhala called to his wife:\n\n‘Come see who’s at the door!’\n\nPride was apparent\n\nIn the host’s conversation.\n\nAs they stood in the hallway, waiting…\n\nThe fire smouldered in the hearth,\n\nAn old man played on a lyre,\n\nA man sitting near to him,\n\nSang of heroes\n\nOf ancestral wars:\n\nHow they sacked Pshav-Khevsureti,\n\nIn vengeance for the blood of their brother;\n\nThey celebrate everywhere\n\nThe hand of a righteous man.\n\nThen a beautiful woman appeared,\n\nDressed in black,\n\nSlender as a willow tree,\n\nLike a star descended to earth.\n\n‘See, I have brought you a guest.’\n\n‘Mercy be to God.’\n\nHow you will treat our guest, wife,\n\nThat is for you to say.\n\nThe woman welcomed him in:\n\n‘Guest, may peace be upon you!’\n\n‘You too, may you have peace\n\nAnd your husband and children!’\n\nShe took the guest’s weapons,\n\nThey invited him in;\n\nThe woman following behind,\n\nJokhala leading;\n\nZviadauri following\n\nHis new brother.\n\nIV\n\nThe man who sat by the hearth,\n\nGrey-haired, elderly,\n\nHe rose now to his feet,\n\nLike a powerful tiger on a cliff-top.\n\nAn old man, there as a guest,\n\nMust respect the guest of another,\n\nTo rise to one’s feet is expected,\n\nHe must follow the mountain ways.\n\nBut on seeing the stranger,\n\nHe took on the mask of the wolf;\n\nThey were evident,\n\nThe thoughts in his mind,\n\nThe aged Kist felt no pleasure,\n\nOn seeing this stranger.\n\nHis heart throbbed with anger,\n\nAnd his face betrayed it,\n\nHis hand drifted to his sword,\n\nAnd he checked his knife, covertly,\n\nBut a guest cannot start a quarrel\n\nIn another man’s house.\n\nHe rose and exited quietly,\n\nBiting his finger in bitterness,\n\nHe beat at his chest three times,\n\nAs he stepped outside.\n\nHe left and went from house to house,\n\nSharpening his tongue with poison:\n\n‘Our deadly enemy, you Kists,\n\nWalks with you, disguised, in the night.\n\nIt seems, Jokhala fails to know him\n\nHis eyes have not pierced the disguise.\n\nHe is the decimator of our people,\n\nAttacking us with violence,\n\nForever insatiable in his desire\n\nFor our blood and bone.\n\nToday he is in our hands, let’s see\n\nIf we can make him taste the bitterness\n\nOf those Khevsur killed this summer;\n\nWe have unburied dead.\n\nTell me, if I fail of the truth,\n\nIf my words are in error!\n\nMake our enemy know too,\n\nThat we are not basely born.\n\nI am surprised at Jokhala,\n\nWhy open the door to an enemy,\n\nWho is this guest? The idiot,\n\nWhy does he not see?\n\nWe must bring bitterness\n\nTo Zviadauri’s nostrils,\n\nIf not then let the women\n\nWield our shields and swords.’\n\nEven the Kists’ children were stirred,\n\nEveryone strapped on a sword,\n\nThe entire village was stirred –\n\nMan, woman, and child.\n\nThey must sacrifice the life\n\nOf Zviadauri to their dead;\n\nThey must kill him on his enemy’s grave\n\nAs is the custom.\n\nTo send a spy,\n\nInstructing him in secret,\n\nTo go to Jokhala,\n\nLike a neighbour and a brother;\n\nNot to divulge in any way\n\nThe villagers’ intent.\n\nTo eat and to converse,\n\nTo discover where the guest will sleep;\n\nTo assault him at night, and bind him,\n\nNeeds little debate.\n\nThe spy arrives\n\nWith ingratiating tongue\n\nHe blesses Jokhala’s name,\n\nHe speaks freely, gives no offence.\n\nHe jests and tells stories,\n\nHe strikes sparks with his tongue.\n\nWho could know his heart was full\n\nOf the venom of a deadly snake.\n\nThey dined. The host\n\nAdmired his guest with all his heart.\n\n‘He’s a brave man, you can tell,’\n\nHe swore by his cult,\n\n‘Meeting today, tomorrow as brothers\n\nLet us be one in spirit.’\n\nHe invited him to rest,\n\nAnd showed him to his own bed.\n\nHis guest refused it, ‘No,’\n\nI want neither mattress nor blanket.\n\nI’ll sleep in the entrance way,\n\nI’m not used to sleeping inside…\n\nHe had achieved the goal\n\nAimed at in his heart,\n\nThis is what the spy desires,\n\nIt’s why he made his way there.\n\nAnd he left joyfully,\n\nTo spread the news around.\n\nIf the fox knows where the cockerel roosts,\n\nWhat more can he wish!\n\nV\n\n‘Wife, what’s all this confusion?\n\nBring me my sword and sabre!\n\nThis is no trivial skirmish,\n\nThe whole enemy force is attacking!\n\nThey are out to destroy us,\n\nOur guest has betrayed us;\n\nBeneath brotherhood and friendship\n\nHe’s concealed an army!\n\nHush! Wait! I am wrong…\n\nThey are our Kists.\n\nWhy are they here, now;\n\nWhat are they crying, what do they want?\n\nListen, carefully,\n\nI can hear a man screaming.\n\nWhat a dire sound,\n\nWhat a dreadful deed!\n\nThey are slaughtering my guest\n\nWith their glittering swords.\n\nLook at those ruthless ones,\n\nHow they trample through my home!\n\nThey have my manhood in their hands,\n\nAnd they crush it as they crush the grapes.\n\nLet me go and see,\n\nWhat has stirred them so?...’\n\nSo saying, Jokhala rose\n\nAnd gripping his sword in his hand,\n\nHe opened the doors of his house,\n\nAnd stepped out defiantly.\n\n‘Why are you here? He cried,\n\n‘Whose guest do you bind with rope?\n\nWhy do you break our sovereign law,\n\nWhy do you drench my head with mud?\n\nI swear by my religion, I’ll shed blood,\n\nYou will regret your vile conduct,\n\nYou’ll regret this, though you are my brothers,\n\nTrampling like this on my manhood!...’\n\n‘What do you mean, you fool,\n\nHave you lost your wits?\n\nOver a deadly guest, an enemy\n\nWho would cut off the breasts of his own mother!’\n\nSo the Kists cried,\n\nShouting, all at once, loud as thunder\n\n‘You and your guest, will both\n\nBe hurled from the cliffs together.\n\nWhatever the tribe must do, it will\n\nAccording to the tribe’s rules.\n\nThis decimator of all Kisteti\n\nWhy do you treat him as your guest?\n\nIn the mountains, even a child\n\nKnows this Zviadauri’s name.\n\nYou fool, he’s forever trying,\n\nTo exterminate us all.\n\nHe attacks us like a wolf,\n\nHe ambushes us on the trail.’\n\nJokhala thought deeply,\n\nHis face filled with regret,\n\nAs if an arrow had been fired,\n\nInto the very centre of his heart.\n\n‘It was he who killed your brother,\n\nWith his gun, in the birch-wood.\n\nWe know his face,\n\nFierce with rage.\n\n“I am here, I, Zviadauri!”\n\nHe screamed from above;\n\nWe heard him clearly,\n\nWe were watching him from afar.\n\nHe filled Pshav-Khevsureti\n\nWith cattle he stole from us.\n\nHe stood behind the army,\n\nSwift-footed, wearing a grey chokha.\n\nWhy do you shame yourself, you wretch,\n\nFor this insatiable creature?\n\nHow can you sit near him,\n\nWithout vomiting in his face?’\n\n‘All that may be true…\n\nBut what are you trying to say,\n\nYou can’t tie my heart\n\nTo your wishes with a thread.\n\nHe is my guest, this day,\n\nThough he owes me a sea of blood,\n\nI cannot betray him.\n\nI swear it, by God, his creator.\n\nI ask you to loose him, Musa,\n\nNot to torment him further,\n\nWhen he leaves my household,\n\nThen you may do as you wish.\n\nWho has ever betrayed a guest,\n\nIn Kisteti, even in story?\n\nWhat have I done, then,\n\nThat you are all at my door?\n\nYou forget the rules of your own cult,\n\nThat is why you act so wrongly;\n\nWhat would you say to my family?\n\nYou are in my house, not outside!\n\nWoe to you, children of Kists,\n\nWho come to my door in force!\n\nYou attack an unarmed man,\n\nHow does that make you feel?’\n\nMusa (to Jokhala)\n\n‘We will bind you too,\n\nFor shaming the tribe, you wretch!\n\nWill you dare to disobey\n\nWhat we order?\n\nYou’re barking like some sheep-dog,\n\nYou are talking foolish nonsense;\n\nOn behalf of this non-believer,\n\nTreating your brothers as the enemy,\n\nDo you realise your own life\n\nWill be filled now with misfortune!’\n\nJokhala (to Musa).\n\n‘What? Do you call me a dog?\n\nThen I’ll act like one, too!’\n\nHe drew his dagger,\n\nAnd thrust it to the hilt into Musa’s heart.\n\n‘Look, here is the true dog,\n\nSee how bold he grows with me!\n\nYou tramplers on my manhood,\n\nDo you dare to curse me?\n\nI swear, by Allah, I’ll slay you,\n\nBefore you can murder me with your sabres\n\nMay the wrath of land and sky show you no mercy,\n\nFor the unjust thing you do!’\n\n‘Oh God, what has he done,\n\nHe’s given way to madness…’\n\nJokhala was attacked\n\nBy the whole force of Kists,\n\nThey tied his hands…they made sure\n\nHe could not wield his sword…\n\nThey threw him into the hallway\n\nHis hands and feet bound like a corpse.\n\nThe people’s condemnation is thunder,\n\nTheir saliva, the moisture of rain.\n\nThey seized the wounded man too,\n\nZviadauri….\n\nWhat does Zviadauri say,\n\nWhy is his face like a stoic’s?\n\nGrief is killing that brave man,\n\nBecause his hand lacks a sword:\n\n‘You have seized me, you dogs,\n\nA fortunate day for you!’\n\nHe said this quite calmly,\n\nAnd he said nothing more.\n\nThey were dragging him to the graveyard,\n\nWhere the Kists were buried;\n\nAs a sacrifice to the dead,\n\nTo bear water for them there,\n\nTo obey them as their servant,\n\nAnd wash their feet…\n\nVI\n\nOn the far side of the village was a hill,\n\nScorched, and dusty;\n\nMany brave men lay there,\n\nLion-hearted, nobly bred.\n\nThe silent hillside sloped below,\n\nA torrent flowing through clay.\n\nThose who wielded sword and gun\n\nTheir strong hearts no longer beat;\n\nThe voiceless ground devours them,\n\nHarsh and insatiable;\n\nEveryone thinks of it\n\nAs the very likeness of a human being…\n\nStrength cannot save us from mortal fate\n\nNor cunning words.\n\nThis is Nature’s deep flaw,\n\nThat always offends my mind:\n\nIt kills everyone, good or bad,\n\nAnd no-one survives in the end.\n\nWhen the ship is wrecked\n\nEvery passenger is drowned!...\n\nThe sun had not yet risen,\n\nThe dew still rested on the grass,\n\nThe breeze had not yet blown,\n\nHad not spread from above.\n\nCountless men and women\n\nWere gathered there.\n\nZviadauri was brought\n\nHands bound before the crowd,\n\nAll are eager for his slaughter,\n\nYet who among them would grieve?\n\nDeath terrifies us all,\n\nWhen others are killed, we long to watch;\n\nMost of the time men do not feel\n\nThe wickedness of their actions.\n\nThere are so many sinful souls,\n\nWho live their lives without remorse;\n\nYet who does not wish to destroy\n\nOne who harms them?\n\nVII\n\nHere is the grave of a Kist,\n\nSurrounded by the crowd.\n\nMoollah begins to pray,\n\nRemembering his dead:\n\n‘Suffer, no more, Darda,\n\nNor be troubled,\n\nHere are your brothers\n\nAt the door of your grave,\n\nBe joyful, we sacrifice to you,\n\nNo longer swallow your anger against your foe,\n\nMay this dog die for you!’\n\nThe stranger’s voice is heard,\n\nHis hackles are rising,\n\nHis hair like a tiger’s.\n\nLime is burning\n\nIn the victim’s inner core.\n\nWill this subdue his rage,\n\nA blade with a rusted edge!\n\nThey fall upon Zviadauri,\n\nSet the sword at his throat:\n\n‘We sacrifice you to Darla!’\n\nThey all cry.\n\n(Zviadauri) ‘Your dead are the dogs!’\n\nHe shouted to the crowd.\n\nA brave man, defiant.\n\nUnwavering, his brow.\n\nThe Kists were confounded,\n\nThe crowd reared up.\n\n‘He refuses to die,\n\nBehold, this dog!’\n\nThey are shouting and as they do\n\nSlowly driving in the sword.\n\n‘You are the dogs!’ he murmured in his throat\n\nBefore they severed his head!\n\n‘Look at him, look,\n\nNot a blink from his eyes!’\n\nLife is ebbing, he is bleeding,\n\nZviadauri is dying,\n\nBut an enemy hand could not quench his heart,\n\nHis heart was still his heart…\n\nAnd witnessing all this\n\nOne lovely woman melted,\n\nHiding her tears\n\nStanding there, behind the crowd,\n\nShe wanted to aid him:\n\nHer heart screamed: ‘Don’t kill him!’\n\nShe was thinking, angrily:\n\n‘I wish I had a scythe,\n\nI wish the female cult\n\nGave me the right,\n\nTo grant him life\n\nIn exchange for all these souls.\n\nI wish I were the one\n\nWho might sleep in his arms,\n\nWhose breast, now damned,\n\nLay on his breast,\n\nWould that one ever tire\n\nOf her husband’s love!’\n\nThe Kists were angered, shamed:\n\nTheir wish was not fulfilled,\n\nThey could not make a fitting sacrifice\n\nTo the dead;\n\nTheir victim slew their hearts\n\nAnd diminished their joy.\n\nAshamed they desired\n\nTo wield their swords as one\n\nAnd make of the corpse\n\nRibbons stained with blood.\n\nBut they did not dare from shame:\n\nAnd ‘Shameful!’ all were thinking.\n\nTheir hearts and minds\n\nVexed and troubled.\n\nAs they headed home,\n\nHeads low, descending, they said:\n\n‘We’d not have killed him\n\nIf as an enemy he’d not harmed us.\n\nHe was a brave man’,\n\nAll swore to Allah,\n\n‘That’s why he fought like a tiger,\n\nDefending the honour of his land.’\n\nBut “treat your enemy with harshness”\n\nGod himself commands us,\n\nThe sooner then must we\n\nDrive a knife into their hearts.’\n\nThey abandoned Zviadauri’s\n\nCorpse there, alone;\n\nFor the dogs to drag at him,\n\nBirds to tear and dismember him;\n\n‘He was no sacrifice, let him rot there\n\nThat too is no less harm.’\n\nThe Kists proclaimed this\n\nProudly, in loud voices.\n\nAnd their voices were echoed\n\nBy the mountains’ dark ravines.\n\nNight fell,\n\nLight faded from the heights,\n\nDarkness entered stealthily\n\nThe sun sank to rest.\n\nThe sunlight faded,\n\nThe sand no longer shining;\n\nNo longer seen now, vanished,\n\nThe white hair of the black summits.\n\nEmbroidered, veined with sorrows,\n\nThe face of those rocks,\n\nThat are forever grieving,\n\nWith pure streams like tears.\n\nFor death, mourning is fitting,\n\nFor a dead brother, a sister’s weeping,\n\nFor the forest, the stag’s trail,\n\nOr the howling of wolves,\n\nFor a brave man death in battle,\n\nShattered sword in hand.\n\nFor war, the victory feast\n\nWith the enemy defeated.\n\nZviadauri was mourned\n\nBy the fret and fall of water,\n\nThe moan from the tall mountain\n\nFreed on the breeze,\n\nTears from the ranks of mist\n\nOrdained by God.\n\nAnd by the stream, a woman,\n\nFine, a beauty of Kist,\n\nPours water over her breast and forehead,\n\nFainting from time to time.\n\nShe cried for a long time, quietly,\n\nThough now and then she trembled,\n\nThe death of Zviadauri\n\nWould appear before her eyes.\n\nShe was crying without tears,\n\nConstrained by respect:\n\nRespect for the tribe on the one hand\n\nOn the other, her fear of God.\n\nGrieving for an enemy\n\nWould bring their anger upon her.\n\nThe thought was in her mind,\n\nBut her heart took its own path,\n\nThe man’s heroic death,\n\nWas etched on her heart.\n\nThat scene had pierced\n\nThe woman’s heart like an arrow,\n\nForcing this beauty\n\nTo mourn the slaughtered one.\n\nShe is waiting for dark, so she\n\nCan weep for the dead by night;\n\nShe gave barely a thought\n\nTo her Jokhala,\n\nA wife is mourning another’s man\n\nWhat is the madwoman doing?\n\nPerhaps they are killing Jokhala,\n\nBreaking down the doors of the house!\n\nShe rose and glanced around\n\nA frightened creature;\n\nSwiftly she climbed\n\nThe mountainous cliffs;\n\nWith the fearful noise of the waters\n\nHissing in the gloom.\n\nShe climbed to the grave, leaned\n\nThere, then knelt in reverence,\n\nShe was sobbing, out of breath;\n\nTears melted the stone.\n\nShe took a knife and approached\n\nZviadauri’s corpse,\n\nShe cut three hairs from his beard\n\nFor a keepsake,\n\nShe wrapped them round a coarse twig\n\nWith her tapering sculpted fingers.\n\nWhat is that deafening noise?\n\nHer ears are ringing…\n\nFrom the graves can be heard\n\nThe anger and moans of the dead!\n\nAs if infants were crying too,\n\nWailing bitterly!\n\nIt’s the voice of a shared anger,\n\nOf a common grief:\n\n‘What are you doing, you shameful wretch’\n\nWas their bitter complaint,\n\n‘Almighty God will vent his anger on you!’\n\nWas the cry from the grave.\n\nSwift clouds\n\nAppeared on the surface of the sky…\n\nShe ran away, looking back,\n\nThe dead themselves ran after her,\n\n‘Where can you hide yourself,\n\nIf you try to escape us now?’\n\nThe voices behind her cry,\n\nThe mountains echo their words,\n\nReverberating everywhere\n\nNot just in one place or two.\n\n‘Traitor!’ they all cry,\n\nThe peerless stallions,\n\nThe grasses, stones, and sand,\n\nAll around.\n\nHere, from his grave, rises\n\nHer dead brother, Ebari,\n\nUnequalled among his peers,\n\nFamed horseman of the Kists;\n\nHe shouted after his sister,\n\nWith thunderous words:\n\n‘Oh, my sister, what have you done to me?\n\nWhy do you shame me so?\n\nYou have dug me a second grave,\n\nThough I am dead and buried!\n\nIs this how you prove yourself my sister,\n\nIs this your womanhood?’\n\nHe glided along the path,\n\nHe howled towards the graveyard.\n\nVIII\n\n(Aghaza) ‘What are you after, damn you?\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nWho permits you to tear at a good man’s flesh?\n\nYou dog, with greedy eyes!\n\nAre Zviadauri’s bones\n\nFor you to pick at?’\n\nSo Aghaza cried,\n\nHurling a shower of stones.\n\nThe dead run behind her menacingly,\n\nAlong the edge of the rocky ravine.\n\nShe can still hear their voices,\n\nEchoed by the mountains.\n\nAghaza’s agate black hair\n\nWas filled with their disapproval.\n\nAs she neared her house,\n\nShe saw light streaming from it;\n\nShe wanted to scream for help,\n\nWanted her voice to be heard,\n\nBut she couldn’t speak a word,\n\nSweat poured from her forehead…\n\nShe felt she was suffocating,\n\nPoured out like water on the threshold.\n\nJokhala was seated by the hearth,\n\nOne knee crossed over the other,\n\n‘Woe is me,’ she said, that’s all,\n\nThe words died on her tongue.\n\nThe husband embraced his wife,\n\nAnd helped her to the hearth.\n\n‘What has happened to you, woman?\n\nHe asked, anxiously.\n\nAs if I lacked for sorrows,\n\nHave you become one too?\n\nWhat’s happened, what is it?\n\nTell me, open your lips!\n\nHas anyone tried\n\nTo grasp you in his arms?\n\nTell me. I’ll not be angry\n\nI’ll make him regret in an instant\n\nAny disrespect to my honour,\n\nI’ll knock the foolishness out of him,\n\nAs I made Musa regret\n\nComing to our door.’\n\nHe was waiting for an answer,\n\nStanding over her,\n\nAt the same time gripping his dagger,\n\nHis hand on the hilt.\n\nThe woman could not speak,\n\nThough her face looked calm.\n\nJokhala walked all round her,\n\nWaiting for what she might say.\n\nBy midnight, Aghaza\n\nHad slowly come to her senses.\n\nShe said to Jokhala: ‘What is all this?\n\nWhy are you so troubled?\n\nWhy do you imagine\n\nWhat has no reality?\n\nIt’s all illusion…husband\n\nI’ve not seen a living soul.\n\nWho would dare do that to me?\n\nDon’t I wear a bride’s head-scarf?\n\nI returned from the graveyard\n\nI was searching for your horse in the ravine\n\nInstead of a horse, alas\n\nI met with giants.\n\nOne dressed in a black felt cloak,\n\nWith an enormous body:\n\n(Lightning in my eyes,\n\nThe reek of its flesh)\n\nWith vast ears, and teeth,\n\nLoathsome, and black in colour.\n\nHe reached out his hands,\n\nHis enormous hands,\n\nOn his head like a mountain-top\n\nWas a dark hat of leather,\n\nHe said: “Come with me,\n\nLive with me, woman,\n\nI have a heap of gold and silver\n\nI’ll hide nothing from you.”\n\nI ran in fear from him,\n\nThe giant too was running and howling,\n\nThe earth was shaking\n\nUnder his lumbering feet;\n\nThe voice scared me, the mountains\n\nAnd valleys too,\n\nWinding this way and that,\n\nI barely reached here to tell you,\n\nOut of breath and suffering.\n\nJokhala said: ‘Besides this giant,\n\nThere must have been something else,\n\nI can’t believe what you say,\n\nMy thoughts are confused.\n\nWhy were you crying?\n\nTears have flowed down your cheeks;\n\nTell me now, tell me truthfully,\n\nOr I’ll lose patience!\n\nSome sorrow, some vital\n\nFeeling has pierced your heart.\n\nYou can’t hide from my eyes\n\nEvery trace of that feeling;\n\nThere is no way to erase\n\nEvery trace of drink from the cup!...’\n\n‘Why should I hide it from you, Jokhala,\n\nWhat in my words could enrage you?’\n\nThe wife said, tremulous\n\nQuivering in her voice,\n\n‘I sacrificed my tears\n\nTo that guest of yours.\n\nI felt pity for that unfortunate man\n\nDying here in a foreign place,\n\nWith no kin, no brother by,\n\nTo feel pity for him!\n\nWho when he was struck by the sword,\n\nNever even flinched.\n\nPerhaps I sinned against you, and God,\n\nYet I cried for him, what could I do!...’\n\n‘Why would I be angered at that?\n\nTo speak truth is better than lying.\n\nYou shed tears? You have shown mercy!\n\nWho am I to judge that a wrong?\n\nIt is always fitting a woman\n\nShould mourn a brave man.’\n\nIX\n\nNext morning, Aghaza\n\nDrives out the cattle,\n\nBirds are swooping,\n\nAttracted by the corpse;\n\nAghaza too is drawn\n\nTo the rocky heights of the graveyard,\n\nFrom which she scares the ravens,\n\nThe vultures, wings beating,\n\nThe insatiable eagles,\n\nFeasting on the spoils of the dead;\n\nWith furtive movements of her hand,\n\nHer eyes glittering like the sun,\n\nShe throws pebbles from the rocks,\n\nWhile seeming to be knitting,\n\nSo cleverly, that no one\n\nCan guess at her thoughts.\n\nX\n\nNews reached Biso,\n\nLike a clap of thunder:\n\n‘They have killed Zviadauri,\n\nOne like sunlight from the sky,\n\nThe shield and sword of Pshav-Khevsureti,\n\nOur vital defence!’\n\nThose hearing the black news\n\nThe women, gathered;\n\nIn Biso his aged mother is crying,\n\nLamenting, sobbing bitterly,\n\n‘Oh, why am I still alive?\n\nBury me too in the earth!\n\nShow me my son’s limbs,\n\nBring him, let me touch them!\n\nWith my son’s right hand\n\nThrow earth on my heart!\n\nOh, why am I still living?\n\nWhy am I still treading the earth?\n\nOh, why have the dead, failed\n\nTo order me to their realm?\n\nHow can I, remain\n\nOn sacrilegious soil?\n\nBrave men heard the news,\n\nHeard it in sorrow,\n\nGrappled with each other\n\nGrieved, roused by anger…\n\nHardly surprising; their defender\n\nThey now mourned with bitter tears!\n\nThey brandished spears,\n\nSharpened and greased the blades,\n\nDonned shields and swords,\n\nGathered their forces for the morning.\n\nNothing strange indeed\n\nIf blood flows in torrents.\n\nApareka cried:\n\nYou’ll need rations for a week!’\n\n‘A man from every clan!’\n\nBabarauli yelled.\n\nIt was the din of men roused for battle,\n\nNot the music of the flute!\n\nXI\n\n‘Run outside, Jokhala,\n\nDon’t lie there calmly by the hearth,\n\nSee the force that has reached\n\nOur mountain heights!\n\nThey are coming to visit,\n\nThey will soon be our guests,\n\nThey will make our women\n\nRue their rocking of the cradle,\n\nThey are driving off the cattle,\n\nWhat is all this confusion!\n\nSee, their army has seized\n\nThe heights of Jaregi, and Samgori,\n\nThe wastelands of the shepherds,\n\nThey are descending from the cliffs.\n\nGo, help your kin,\n\nThey’re advancing on the enemy,\n\nGo too, Jokhala,\n\nGo with all the others.’\n\n‘Follow them? What are you saying, fool?\n\nThey won’t let me near them!\n\nI’ll have to fight alone,\n\nLet all Jarega see it;\n\nWho is loyal, who is not,\n\nLet the country see it.\n\nThe Kists think I’m a traitor,\n\nRenouncing my own cult,\n\nThey think Jokhala,\n\nHas sold himself for gain,\n\nThat I’ve betrayed Kisteti,\n\nOne careless of his own soul;\n\nThey are bringing a gravestone\n\nTo set on my living heart.’\n\nAs Jokhala spoke,\n\nHe was donning his body-armour:\n\nStrapping his sword to his waist,\n\nSlinging his gun from his shoulder,\n\nIt is not a Kist tradition\n\nTo wear a helmet on the head.\n\nHe walks along by himself,\n\nIntent on meeting\n\nWith the foe.\n\nThe Kists are scattered over the heights.\n\nXII\n\nThe army of the Khevsurs advances,\n\nTheir flag-bearer in the lead;\n\nThey swarm towards the graveyard,\n\nThe Kists’ house of silence:\n\nThey seek their dead warrior,\n\nTo gather his bones,\n\nTo put out the eyes\n\nOf Zviadauri’s tormentors.\n\nBut they were met by the Kists,\n\nConcealed at the gully’s edge;\n\nWho grasp their guns,\n\nThey won’t yield\n\nTo the Khevsurs.\n\nAgile young men\n\nOn both sides fire their guns\n\nShouting their battle cries,\n\nBoth sides suffer wounds,\n\nBoth sides fight on, regardless.\n\nThe bullets had their fill\n\nOf blood, harming many.\n\nStill the Kists did not break,\n\nThey stood firm as a fortress.\n\nBabarauli of the Khevsurs,\n\nCalled for a sabre attack.\n\nIt came down to cold steel,\n\nShields gave way to sabres.\n\nThe Khevsurs are seeking\n\nRich treasure and spoils;\n\nShield, do not despise the sword\n\nThat hangs beside you.\n\nThe Khevsurs scrambling down\n\nMet an insurmountable boulder.\n\nSuddenly from behind it,\n\nSprang a lone Kist with a sabre,\n\nAstounding the army of Kists,\n\nBy repulsing the enemy force.\n\nSome thought it a mirage,\n\nThey called out, in disbelief,\n\n‘Who is attacking the Khevsurs?\n\nIs it one of us? Who is he?’\n\n‘It looks like Jokhala,\n\nYes it’s him indeed!’\n\nOne shouted, others agreed,\n\nThey all stared, dumbfounded.\n\nAt his disdain for the enemy force,\n\nThough they brandish swords and daggers.\n\nThen the enemy killed him,\n\nPierced his chest with their sabre tips.\n\nAt that the Kists too rejoiced:\n\n‘Let them kill him, he deserves to die!\n\nEven now he treats us like fools,\n\nAs he has spurned us before,\n\nDaring to set himself over all the rest,\n\nAnd cover us in shame.\n\nHe met the enemy army alone,\n\nAnd won over us by chance.’\n\nThe Khevsurs slaughtered Jokhala\n\nOn the rocky summit, on the heights.\n\nThey attacked the Kists,\n\nScattered over the slope.\n\nA whirl of daggers and sabres,\n\nStruck them in their chests;\n\nThe ringing and clatter of shield and sword\n\nRose to God above.\n\nThe Kist army fled,\n\nThey went scurrying towards their towers,\n\nThe Khevsurs chasing after,\n\nTheir helms glittering;\n\nThey gathered from the graveyard\n\nThe bones of Zviadauri:\n\nScattered some here, some there,\n\nTorn apart by carrion birds.\n\nThey put the bones in their saddle-bags,\n\nAnd headed for home,\n\nTheir hearts’ desire achieved,\n\nThe vengeance they had sworn.\n\nThey gathered the sheep and cattle,\n\nDrove them over the mountains;\n\nThey took revenge on their foes,\n\nAnswering every desire!\n\nHis bones they carried with them,\n\nHome from that foreign soil,\n\nThe Hope of Pshav-Khevsureti,\n\nTheir Fortress, their Iron Door.\n\nHis brothers will cry for him,\n\nFor the dead, according to custom,\n\nThey’ll inter his bones to lie\n\nBeside his ancestors:\n\nThe tears that ran down his chest,\n\nHave exacted the highest price!\n\nXIII\n\n‘Mourner of a stranger,\n\nKhevsurs slew your husband.\n\nGo mourn him, Aghaza,\n\nBury him in his grave.\n\nThe raven croaks at his head,\n\nThe wind sifts through his beard.’\n\n(Aghaza) ‘May your enemies know\n\nThe bitterness of my bitter existence!\n\nNobody comes near me,\n\nNobody cares about me.\n\nI buried him on top of the cliff,\n\nAnd I dug his grave myself.\n\nAll turn their backs on me,\n\nAll stand aside.\n\nThey even shut the graveyard,\n\nWhere I might bury my dead.’\n\n‘Jokhala betrayed us,\n\nThat is the place for him,\n\nWhere he fought alone,\n\nSpreader of poison amongst us,\n\nDestroyer of our health,\n\nTraitorous, unrelenting.’\n\n‘Fire is burning me, brothers, fire is burning me,\n\nFlameless, unmoving;\n\nIt slays my heart, confuses my mind,\n\nWith unfathomable thoughts!’\n\nSo the wife mourned Jokhala,\n\nShedding endless tears,\n\nA chamois, with neck bent gracefully,\n\nLoose hair, face like the moon,\n\nShe was sewing herself, like a pearl button,\n\nTo her husband’s chest.\n\nXIV\n\nThe night is dark, rain pours,\n\nThe ground is quivering.\n\nGod, take care of those in torment,\n\nHelp them, have mercy on them!\n\nGood is good despite all,\n\nShow love to the wretched one!\n\nTake the prayers of the tormented\n\nTo your heart like roses!\n\nIf you can’t help, accept\n\nThe souls of those in pain!...\n\nEnough of this threatening sky\n\nDissipate, you clouds!\n\nThe river thunders, angrily,\n\nBursting over the boulders,\n\nIt’s wrath unchanged today,\n\nNot knowing why it laments.\n\nIt has no fear of torment,\n\nIt knows nothing of death.\n\nIt only knows one thing:\n\nShedding its tears, and howling,\n\nEndlessly joyless,\n\nForever howling and crying…\n\nThe wind scours the ravines\n\nShouting from the mountain;\n\nOn the cliff, the woman, her hair unbound\n\nStands, gazing at the river.\n\nShe seems like a fading star,\n\nIn the gloom her trembling mouth.\n\nSpeaks not a word…\n\nShe quivers, she stares at the river;\n\nDreadful the noise it makes,\n\nDreadful the way it flows!\n\nSnarling, severe,\n\nThe black torrent rages.\n\n‘Do not drown yourself!’\n\nIf they would only call to her.\n\nThe woman shut her eyes,\n\nLeapt swiftly into the depths.\n\n‘Why live on, to what end?’\n\nSuch were her last thoughts.\n\n‘In Kisteti no one cares for me,\n\nNot one thing, not even a pebble.\n\nBoth of us harmed the Kists,\n\nThey damned my husband…\n\nI bear a greater sin,\n\nI shed tears for a stranger.’\n\nThe water took Aghaza,\n\nDrowned her in its silt and sand.\n\nXV\n\nOn that cliff-top, where Jokhala\n\nWas slain in the fight with the Khevsurs,\n\nAt night they see an image,\n\nCarved on the hill, by an avalanche:\n\nJokhala stands high on the boulder,\n\nShouting towards the graveyard:\n\n‘Zviadaur, my brother,\n\nWhy won’t you show your face?’\n\nFrom the graveyard there comes\n\nA ghost with sword and shield,\n\nHe has crossed his arms\n\nOver his heart,\n\nHe’ll come and greet\n\nHis brother silently.\n\nThere Aghaza too will rise,\n\nWith a sad, mournful face.\n\nA fire burns beside them,\n\nDimly smouldering on the mountain.\n\nAghaza plays host to her guests,\n\nShe roasts a ram over the flames.\n\nThey are drinking to courage,\n\nTo each others’ respect\n\nFor the rites of host and guest,\n\nTo comradeship, brotherhood, sisterhood.\n\nWhen you see them together\n\nYou can’t have enough of gazing;\n\nYet something dark appears\n\nFilling your sight,\n\nDense, black in colour,\n\nAs the words of the poet.\n\nIt shrouds it like an enchantment,\n\nNo weapon can pierce it,\n\nNo prayer can charm it away,\n\nNor any hand remove it.\n\nOnly the river’s noise is heard,\n\nRaging downwards, roaring,\n\nWhile beauty stares into its depths\n\nHer neck bent, gracefully…\n\n1893\n\nNotes:\n\nVazha-Pshavela (July 26, 1861 – July 10, 1915) was the pen-name of the Georgian poet and writer Luka P.
