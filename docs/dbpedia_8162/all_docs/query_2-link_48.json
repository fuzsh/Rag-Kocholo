Mtavari Arkhi TV said IPSOS had allowed them to amend the initial results of the Zugdidi mayoral race due to a technical error in earlier calculations. Even the initial results differed from those published by IPSOS, and still put UNM’s Anzor Melia in the lead, according to Mtavari Arkhi TV.\n\nThe TV network also claimed information on the margin of error and dates of the fieldwork provided by IPSOS to the channel was different from the one made available on the company’s website later on. Noting IPSOS global “discredited itself irreparably leaving with this extremely suspicious behavior,” Mtavari Arkhi TV accused to the company of corruption. The company was not allowed to publish any information without the channel’s consent either, according to Mtavari Arkhi TV. The channel said it terminated its partnership with IPSOS, and will take the case to arbitration. Mtavari Arkhi TV exit polls for second rounds, supposed to have been fielded by IPSOS, face an uncertain fate.\n\nThursday, October 28\n\n22:00 UTC+4 — Tensions in Zugdidi as GD, UNM Trade Accusations\n\nTensions rose in Zugdidi, as Georgian Dream and United National Movement members traded accusations over the alleged seizing of voters’ ID cards.

UNM MP Ana Tsitlidze on her part said that GD activists had attempted to seize the voters’ identification documents from citizens living near an IDP settlement in Zugdidi.\n\n17:40 UTC+4 — Mtavari Arkhi TV Under Fire over “Manipulated” Polls\n\nThe ruling Georgian Dream party slammed the government-critical Mtavari Arkhi TV over “manipulated” public opinion polls. GD PR Secretary Shalva Papuashvili pointed out that Zugdidi results published by IPSOS Global, which fielded the TV channel’s poll, differ from those published by Mtavari Arkhi TV.\n\nResults disclosed by Mtavari Arkhi showed UNM’s Anzor Melia at 54.7% and GD’s Mamuka Tsotseria at 45.3%, while information on IPSOS’ website puts GD candidate at 51% and the UNM candidate at 49%. Results of surveys for Tbilisi, Batumi, Kutaisi and Rustavi mayoral races are the same, albeit the numbers are rounded.\n\nThe margin of error, reported by Mtavari Arkhi TV as +/- 3%, varies between +/- 4.15%-4.82% for the five municipalities in IPSOS report.\n\nMtavari Arkhi TV has yet to comment on the discrepancy.\n\nWednesday, October 27\n\n22:00 UTC+4 — Mtavari Arkhi TV / IPSOS Global Publish Runoff Poll\n\nGovernment critical Mtavari Arkhi TV unveiled the results of opinion poll fielded by IPSOS Global between October 23 and October 27.

The TV channel said margin of error stands at plus, minus 3%.\n\nTbilisi, the capital\n\n#41 Kakha Kaladze (Georgian Dream) – 51.6%\n\n#5 Nika Melia (United National Movement) – 48.4%\n\nKutaisi, self-governing city\n\n#5 Khatia Dekanoidze (UNM) – 51.7%\n\n#41 Ioseb Khakhaleishvili (GD) – 48.3%\n\nBatumi, self-governing city\n\n#5 Giorgi Kirtadze (UNM) – 51.3%\n\n#41 Archil Chikovani (GD) – 48.7%\n\nRustavi, self-governing city\n\n#5 Davit Kirkitadze (UNM) – 51.1%\n\n#41 Nino Latsabidze (GD) – 46.9%\n\nZugdidi\n\n#5 Anzor Melia (UNM) – 54.7%\n\n#41 Mamuka Tsotseria (GD) – 45.3%\n\n21:00 UTC+4 — Opposition Rallies in Zugdidi\n\nUnited National Movement held a rally in the town of Zugdidi in Georgia’s western region of Samegrelo.

Melia followed that this task should not be assigned to the City and Municipal Halls.\n\nGeorgia’s Law on Military Duty and Military Service delegates the responsibility for conscription from the state to self-government bodies, for example to Tbilisi District Boards (Gamgeoba) under the City Hall. In Georgia, men aged 18-27 are drafted for mandatory service, but often conscripts are assigned to guard administrative buildings instead of serving in the military, a practice that Nika Melia criticized.\n\nMonday, October 25\n\n15:45 UTC+4 — Kobakhidze calls UNM’s Melia, Ugulava and Kirkitadze “Hooligans”\n\nGeorgian Dream Chair Irakli Kobakhidze called Rustavi mayoral hopeful Davit Kirkitadze “a hooligan” while responding to a reporter’s question on yesterday’s incident near the UNM Rustavi office. He added that the United National Movement has proposed “a cohort of hooligans” as candidates for the second round of elections, also naming Tbilisi and Poti mayoral hopefuls Nika Melia and Gigi Ugulava alongside Kirkitadze.\n\nSunday, October 24\n\n17:30 UTC+4 — A Brawl Erupts in front of the UNM’s Rustavi office\n\nRustavi mayoral hopeful Davit Kikritadze of the United National Movement accused the Georgian Dream of organizing a “provocation” after a brawl erupted near the office of the United National Movement in Rustavi, where around 20 activists came out to protest against the UNM.\n\nVasil Balakhadze, an activist involved in the incident, denied his affiliation with the GD and said they came to remind “the Georgian population, the people of Rustavi what [Mikheil Saakashvili’s] regime was doing.”\n\nThe Interior Ministry launched an investigation into the incident under Article 126 of the Criminal Code, stipulating violence.\n\nBoth the GD and UNM chairs reacted to the incident. Irakli Kobakhidze of GD called on everyone “to calm down,” while Nika Melia of UNM stressed that all ambassadors were informed and called for punishing the perpetrators. “It is a test indeed, will this people be punished or not,” Melia added.\n\nFriday, October 22\n\n16:00 UTC+4 — GD Calls UNM a Radical Anti-Church Group\n\nGeorgian Dream aired another video collage on its Facebook page captioned “Being a Natsi [a derogatory term for United National Movement] is shameful.” Calling the UNM a “radical anti-Church group,” the video narrator stressed: “Let us end Natsis, Let us finish Bolshevism!”\n\nVideo contains footage of ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili and Poti mayoral hopeful Gigi Ugulava, as well as media personalities. Clips included footage of Giorgi Gabunia and Nika Gvaramia of Mtavari Arkhi and Misha Mshvildadze of Formula, both government-critical TV networks.\n\n15:30 UTC+4 — Opposition Coalitions Kicks Off Tbilisi Campaign Meetings\n\nTbilisi mayoral hopeful Nika Melia of the United National Movement, accompanied by deputy mayoral hopefuls of his shadow cabinet – Mamuka Khazaradze of Lelo, Zurab Japaridze of Girchi – More Freedom, Elene Khoshtaria of Droa, and Irakli Abesadze – kicked off campaign meetings in Tbilisi. Melia said the coalition will hold impromptu meetings with the Tbilisi electorate ahead of the runoffs. “We do not plan to defeat Georgian Dream, we plan to win,” said Melia.\n\nMelia Unveils Shadow Coalition Cabinet for Tbilisi City Hall\n\nThursday, October 21\n\n13:51 UTC+4 — Kaladze Says Melia’s Shadow Cabinet ‘Ridiculous’\n\nIncumbent Tbilisi Mayor, running for reelection, Kakha Kaladze of the Georgian Dream party called mayoral hopeful Nika Melia’s presentation of a shadow coalition cabinet “a political performance.” Noting the announcement was “ridiculous,” Kaladze pointed out that Deputy Mayors and heads City Hall Department shall be approved by the Tbilisi City Council, where GD’s elected members are set to hold a majority.\n\nWendesday, October 20\n\n11:00 UTC+4 — Incumbent Tbilisi Mayor Unveils Social Initiatives\n\nTbilisi Mayor Kaladze, running for reelection, during a City Hall cabinet meeting announced GEL 500 voucher program for socially vulnerable retirees to buy medicines. The program would cost GEL 20 million and target 40,000 citizens. He also said that from 2022 the City Hall will provide housing for 400 families categorized as homeless. “Politics consumed social issues to an extent that many do not even remember this issue,” he noted.\n\nTuesday, October 19\n\n17:30 UTC+4 — Melia Slams Kaladze, Calls for a Debate\n\nTbilisi Mayoral hopeful Nika Melia of the United National Movement slammed his rival incumbent Kakha Kaladze of the ruling Georgian Dream party for “hate-campaigning instead of talking about problems in the capital city.” He challenged Kaladze to an open debate “anytime, on any network.” “Let’s publicly introduce Tbilisites our plans and our solutions to their problems!” he urged the incumbent mayor.
