        "text": "Reading time: 4 Minutes\n\nRegus continues to expand its network with new centre openings across the globe. From a lively cultural hotspot in Warsaw to a district with impressive neighbours in Bremen, discover even more ways to work flexibly\n\n1. Gold standard\n\nRegus 50 Cavill Ave, Gold Coast, Australia\n\nFound in the heart of Surfers Paradise, the iconic building that houses Regus 50 Cavill Ave is one of the Gold Coast’s most prestigious commercial addresses. The building’s position gives it three street frontages, including Beach Road and The Gold Coast Highway, and occupants are just moments from the world-famous Main and Broadwater beaches. The business centre – which offers uninterrupted views of the Broadwater and the Hinterland – is conveniently located within easy walking distance of public transport, as well as plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops.\n\n2. Instant benefits\n\nRegus Mahando Road, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania\n\nYour business can hit the ground running in Dar Es Salaam, with Grade A offices and meeting rooms at Regus Mahando Road. The workspace is located in an attractive low-rise property, with an internal courtyard garden, on the northern tip of Tanzania’s Msasani Peninsula, known as Sea Cliff. As the name suggests, the area is close to the ocean, and the surroundings include the Dar Es Salaam Yacht Club and Coco Beach, as well as shops and other amenities in Sea Cliff itself. Getting there is easy: there are buses to Mawenzi bus station and Chole bus stand, plus ample basement parking.\n\n3. Green and lively\n\nRegus Villa Metro, Wilanowska, Warsaw, Poland\n\nIf you’re looking for a well-placed, action-packed location, you’re in luck. In lively Mokotów (the second largest office district in Warsaw) you’ll find Regus Villa Metro – conveniently situated across the road from Metro Wilanowska Light Rail Station and offering more than 10,000 square feet of sleek co-working space. The surrounding area is a joy to discover, and home to numerous museums and attractions, including the historic palace Królikarnia and shopping hub Galeria Mokotów. For those invigorated by fresh air and foliage, there’s no shortage of greenery to be discovered: Arkadia and Dolina Sluzewiecka parks are both a short saunter away.\n\n4. Big-name neighbours\n\nRegus Vazha-Pshavela, Tbilisi, Georgia\n\nIf your business would benefit from great connections with big-name multinational corporations or smaller companies, Regus Vazha-Pshavela is for you. It’s located in the business hub of Saburtalo, Tbilisi – one of Georgia’s most sought-after neighbourhoods, and home to the likes of Samsung Georgia, Huawei and British American Tobacco. Choose from a selection of bright private offices, modern co-working spaces and well-sized rooms for business meetings – and make sure to take time to appreciate the neighbourhood. The Tsu Museum of Zoology and David Bolkvadze Park are both nearby. Getting to and from the office is simple: via Nutsubidze Street II-IV Microdistrict station or Vazha-Pshavela subway station.\n\nRegus centres around the world offer light, bright spaces for a range of business needs\n\n5. Brightest and best\n\nRegus Wallisellen Business Park, Wallisellen, Switzerland\n\nStrategically located for both Zurich Airport and the city centre, Regus Wallisellen Business Park, in Switzerland’s commercial hub, is poised to fulfil your business needs. The attractive business park, made up of five buildings, is situated next to Switzerland’s largest shopping centre, the Glatt, and is home to multinational corporations, such as Reckitt-Benckiser, Canon and Microsoft. Inside, the contemporary workspace (which occupies the entire second floor) is bright and welcoming thanks to four skylights and wide glazing. The building’s proximity to the motorway and trams makes it accessible for both staff and visitors, with underground parking an added convenience.\n\n6. Business heavyweights\n\nRegus Technologiepark, Bremen, Germany\n\nSiemens, ArcelorMittal and OHB SE have all made their home within Bremen’s technology park – highlighting the area’s impressive business credentials. And Regus Technologiepark, situated in its newest campus, means your business can take advantage of the buzz. Offering a floor size of 3,000 square feet, the centre also has good accessibility for wheelchair users. It’s easy to explore the local area – in addition to great bars and restaurants, the centre is directly connected to the University of Bremen and public transportation is within walking distance.\n\n7. Prime location\n\nRegus Northside Business Centres, Budapest\n\nNo visit to Budapest is complete without a wander down ever-bustling Váci Street, which stretches just over a mile between Vörösmarty Square and the Great Market Hall, and runs parallel to the Danube. Luckily, Regus Northside Business Centres occupies a prime position in the heart of the area. Take advantage of the location to access any part of the city, either by car or by public transport – the Forgách utca metro station is at the foot of the building, and good parking facilities are available in the building’s underground garage. Inside the business centre you can expect light, bright spaces for meetings, events and other work.\n\nAnd we’ve also opened here…\n\nRegus Arena Boulevard, Amsterdam\n\nRegus Val Vista, Mesa, Arizona, USA\n\nRegus 575 Norte Sul, Campinas, Brazil\n\nRegus Pharos House, Westville, Durban, South Africa\n\nRegus Azura, Hoofddorp, Netherlands\n\nRegus Science Park, Kiel, Germany\n\nRegus Forum West Side, Kiev, Ukraine\n\nRegus Promenade, Linz, Austria\n\nRegus Tortona, Milan, Italy\n\nRegus Citydel, Moscow, Russia\n\nRegus Rio Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nRegus Teleporto, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nRegus JK 1455, Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nRegus Empresarial Mario Garnero, Sao Paulo, Brazil"
