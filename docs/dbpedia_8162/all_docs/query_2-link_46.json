        "text": "Jovan Tomasevic monument (Spomenik Jovanu Tomaševiću) / Bulevar Jovana Tomaševića\n\nVojislav Vojo Stanic is a Montenegrin sculptor and painter. He was born on February 3, 1924 in Podgorica. He grew up in Niksic, where he finished elementary and high school. He graduated from sculpting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade in 1951, in the class of professor Alojz Dolinar. At first he enrolled in painting, but immediately moved to sculpture. After graduation, he moved to Herceg Novi and became a professor at the School of Art Crafts.\n\nIn 1955, he started painting, and in 1956 he exhibited his first portraits and landscapes in Belgrade and Podgorica. At the beginning of the sixties, he completed his monument to Jovan Tomasevic and thus he officially ceased to deal with sculpture. In 1958 he began to work as a professor of the Higher Pedagogical School at the Department of Visual Education and remained in that position until the school closed in 1965. Thus Stanic became a free artist.\n\nHis life in Paris in 1958 and Rome in 1973 and 1974 influenced the formation of his style. His paintings are often set in the Mediterranean, and the characters on them are ordinary, small people. Some paintings depict people on the streets and in the crowd, while others place people lonely in their rooms. He combined realism and surrealism, with elements of fantasy. Critics find similarities with the surrealism of Rene Magritte and the metaphysics of Giorgio de Chirico.\n\nIn 1952, Stanic became a member of the Association of Artists of Montenegro. He became a corresponding member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1977, and a regular member in 1985. Stanic's greatest success was his representation of Montenegro at the 47th Venice Biennale in 1997. In the Art Museum of Montenegro in Cetinje, his paintings are part of a permanent exhibition. He has received numerous awards for his painting work.\n\nTapolca is located 14 km's from Lake Balaton in the basin named after the town itself.\n\nThe Slavic originated word (Toplica) means warm water.\n\nThe town and surroundings have many sights and attractions:\n\nThe Mill Pond has a very romantic and mediterranic feel.

Ses murs sont régulièrement renforcés de contreforts semi cylindriques. Le bas des murs est taluté, englobant les contreforts.\n\nC’est d’ailleurs la plus grande cathédrale en briques du monde, on estime qu’il a fallu environ 25 millions de briques pour l’édifier. C’est aussi la plus grande cathédrale peinte d’Europe.\n\nLe clocher occupe le côté occidental, remplaçant le portail monumental à vocation pédagogique que l'on trouve dans les cathédrales gothiques du nord de la France. Initialement construit à hauteur de la toiture, il a été rehaussé à la fin du XVe siècle. La différence de style est visible au niveau des deux derniers étages qui adoptent une forme polygonale plus conforme à la mode en vigueur à cette époque.\n\nIl abrite les cinq cloches. Elles portent des noms familiers. « Notre-Dame du mont Carmel »380 kg est la plus ancienne. Elle a été fondue en 1773. « Tiburce » 780 kg date du XIXe siècle et « Émilie-Carissime » 1 150 kg a été fondue grâce à une souscription dans les années 2010 . « Cécile » 1 250 kg (fondue en 1929) et le bourdon « Valérien » 3 020 kg (date du XIXe siècle). Les deux anciennes ont été restaurées : chauffées à huit cents degrés, elles ont reçu une recharge de métal pour compenser leur usure naturelle. Les trois cloches ont été hissées en 2010 pour rejoindre les deux autres.\n\nThe cathedral of Albi is closed like a ship of high edge, almost completely out of fairground brick. Its walls are regularly reinforced with semi-cylindrical buttresses. The bottom of the walls is sloped, encompassing the buttresses.\n\nIt is also the largest brick cathedral in the world, it is estimated that it took around 25 million bricks to build it. It is also the largest painted cathedral in Europe.\n\nThe bell tower occupies the western side, replacing the monumental pedagogical portal found in the Gothic cathedrals of northern France. Initially built at the height of the roof, it was raised at the end of the 15th century. The difference in style is visible at the level of the last two floors which adopt a polygonal shape more in keeping with the fashion in force at that time.\n\nIt houses the five bells. They have familiar names. “Our Lady of Mount Carmel” 380 kg is the oldest. It was melted down in 1773. “Tiburce” 780 kg dates from the 19th century and “Émilie-Carissime” 1,150 kg was melted thanks to a subscription in the 2010s. “Cécile” 1,250 kg (melted in 1929) and the drone “Valérien” 3,020 kg (date from the 19th century). The two old ones have been restored: heated to eight hundred degrees, they received a metal refill to compensate for their natural wear. The three bells were hoisted in 2010 to join the other two.\n\nNovember 3, 1941 - the Assumption Cathedral, the main temple of the Kyiv - Pechersk Lavra, the ancient tomb of the Kyiv princes, exploded in Kyiv.\n\nSubsequently, the Soviet authorities accused the Nazis, who ruled the city, of destroying a unique cultural monument. In turn, the Germans attributed the blame to Soviet underground fighters.\n\nKyiv had already been occupied by the Nazis for a month and a half. During this time, Khreshchatyk was blown up - as it turned out, the Bolsheviks, leaving the city in September, mined many important buildings. In October, German sappers cleared mines from the Opera House, Pedagogical Museum, State Bank, University, Vladimir Cathedral and other large buildings. It seemed that Kyiv was safe.\n\nHowever, on November 3 at approximately 14:30, a powerful explosion (or, according to some sources, a series of explosions) was heard in the Lavra. All that remains of the Assumption Cathedral are fragments of the eastern wall, an altar and two pillars.\n\nTapolca is located 14 km's from Lake Balaton in the basin named after the town itself.\n\nThe Slavic originated word (Toplica) means warm water.\n\nThe town and surroundings have many sights and attractions:\n\nThe Mill Pond has a very romantic and mediterranic feel. The hot water springs that have their sources in this place have been blanked up and used for the mill.

The class reminds us of the lessons in the turn of the century.\n\nThe Salt Park\n\nThe Cathedral is part of the Theme Park. This is the entrance to the Sanctuary's underground galleries, presided over by a high relief that pays tribute to the salt miners, responsible for making this old mine a religious and cultural space.\n\nThe Cathedral is part of the Parque do Sal theme complex, which covers an area of ​​32 ha and constitutes a natural reserve that contrasts with one of the resource exploration activities that most alters ecosystems: mining. The Park, in conjunction with the Cathedral of Salt, is a target for national and international tourism and is of particular interest to ecotourism, religious tourism and amateurs of geological sciences.\n\nThe most important places in Parque do Sal are:\n\nThe square where the cross (4.20 m high) is located, which is called \"El Eje Sacro\" (\"The Sacred Axis\").\n\nThe Saline Dome\n\nThe mine\n\nThe \"Museum of Brine\", built in the already disused tanks. It is one of the most important places in Parque do Sal after the Cathedral. In the same, the visitor acquires a pedagogical idea of ​​the salt exploration process, the geological studies and the history, construction and engineering of the Salt Cathedral.\n\nthe dam\n\nthe forest area\n\n\" Cathedral of Salt\", underground church where it is in addition to the religious sanctuary, the Auditorium."
