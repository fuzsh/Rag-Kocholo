        "text": "Nature and history have combined to make Georgia a land of poetry. Glistening peaks, majestic forests, sunny valleys, crystalline streams flowing in deep gorges have a music of their own, which heard by a sensitive ear tends to breed poetic thought as with the English poets inspired by the Lake District.\n\nThe incessant struggle of the Georgians against foreign invaders — Persians, Arabs, Mongols, Turks, Russians and others — has bred in them a sense of chivalry and a deep patriotism which finds expression in many a ballad and poem.\n\nLike in Paris the names of some of the Tbilisi metro stations honour famous poets: Rustaveli, Tsereteli, Vazha-Pshavela and Guramishvili.\n\nNot a great deal of Georgian poetry has been translated into English. Marjory Wardrop translated the great epic poem “The Knight in the Panther’s Skin” ( ვეფხისტყაოსანი ) by Shota Rustaveli. A statue of her and her brother Oliver can be found behind the Old Parliament Building.\n\nI have thus far only learned one Georgian poem, a poem about the wind by Galaktion Tabidze.\n\nქარი ქრის, ქარი ქრის, ქარი ქრის\n\nფოთლები მიჰქრიან ქარდაქარ\n\nხეთა რიგს, ხეთა ჯარს რკალად ხრის\n\nსადა ხარ, სადა ხარ, სადა ხარ.\n\nისევ წვიმს, ისევ თოვს, ისევ თოვს\n\nვერ გპოვებ ვერასდროს, ვერასდროს\n\nშენი მე ხატება დამდევს თან,\n\nყოველთვის, ყოველ დროს, ყოველგან\n\nშორი ცა ნისლიან ფიქრებს ცრის,\n\nქარი ქრის, ქარი ქრის, ქარი ქრის.\n\nქარი ქრის (The Wind Blows) by Galaktion Tabidze\n\nTransliterated:\n\nkari kris, kari kris, kari kris\n\npotlebi mihkrian kardakar\n\nkheta rigs, kheta jars rk’alad khris\n\nsada khar, sada khar, sada khar.\n\nisev ts’vims, isev tovs, isev tovs\n\nver gp’oveb verasdros, verasdros\n\nsheni me khat’eba damdevs tan,\n\nq’oveltvis, q’ovel dros, q’ovelgan\n\nshori tsa nislian pikrebs tsris,\n\nkari kris, kari kris, kari kris.\n\nFeeding the poem into Google Translate results in the following nonsense:\n\nThe wind of Christ, the wind of Christ, the wind of Christ\n\nThe leaves are pulled out of the karakkar\n\nThe wooden arches,\n\nWhere are you where you are?\n\nIt rains again, snowing again and again\n\nYou can never find it forever\n\nYour I like to see you,\n\nAlways, every time, everywhere\n\nThe long sky fogs the fingers,\n\nThe wind of Christ, the wind of Christ, the wind of Christ.\n\nGoogle Translate has its uses but is still far from able to adequately translate Georgian poetry to English. The opening lines are used for the sound, so might be better described as “Whirls the wind, whirls the wind, whirls the wind”.\n\nI need to do more studying. If anyone could recommend other short Georgian poems to learn it would be appreciated."
