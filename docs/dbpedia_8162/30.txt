Vazha-Pshavela (pseudonym of Luka Razikashvili) is considered to be one of the greatest Georgian poets.

As a nature admirer, Vazha-Pshavela knows no comparison in Georgian poetry.

His finest works are considered to be the tragic narrative poems “Host and Guest” (1893) and “The Snake-Eater” (1901) that combine Caucasian folk myth with human tragedy.

You can find an English translation of the poem “Host and Guest” here.

Vazha-Pshavela was born in the village of Chargali in Georgia in 1861 and died in Tbilisi on July 10, 1915.

In 1961, a museum and memorial were built in his birth place in Chargali.
