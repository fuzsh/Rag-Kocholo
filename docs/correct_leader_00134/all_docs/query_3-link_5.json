        "text": "Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, (born Sept. 3, 1938, near Sousse, Tun.), President of Tunisia (1987–2011). Trained as a soldier, he headed the defense ministry’s military intelligence section for 10 years (1964–74) before entering the foreign service. He served as ambassador to Poland before returning home to hold several domestic government posts, which culminated in a dual appointment as prime minister and interior minister. In 1987 he replaced Pres. Habib Bourguiba, who had been declared medically unfit. He was returned to office in elections in 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009. In 2011, amid an unprecedented level of popular protest against poverty, unemployment, and political repression, he stepped down from the presidency and fled the country."
