        "text": "Tunisians Mourn a Hard-Fought Freedom Rapidly Slipping Away\n\nWhen reflecting on their Arab Spring revolution, Tunisians often say that freedom of expression was the only concrete achievement. As the country slides back toward autocracy, that, too, is being quickly eroded.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\n\nTunisia Arrests a Leading Opposition Figure\n\nTargeting Rachid al-Ghannouchi, the leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, is an escalation in President Kais Saied’s crackdown on dissent.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\n\nIn a Hospital Ward, the Wounds of a Failed Democracy Don’t Heal\n\nTunisia’s road to democracy began with a self-immolation, and such cases have filled hospital burn wards ever since, as elected leaders failed to deliver on a promise of prosperity.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\n\nEconomic Neglect and Political Instability Unraveled Tunisia’s Democracy\n\nTensions across the religious-secular fault lines in the country could not be reconciled, and freely elected leaders failed to deliver on the 2011 uprising’s cry for bread, freedom and dignity.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\n\nTunisians Approve New Constitution That Undercuts Democracy\n\nThe charter, passed in a referendum, cements the almost absolute power that President Kais Saied seized over the past year, when he has ruled mostly by decree.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\n\nTunisians Vote on Constitution That Could Threaten Their Democracy\n\nThe new charter would enshrine into law a vast expansion of executive power under President Kais Saied in the past year.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\n\nTunisia’s President Drafts Constitution Giving Himself Broad Powers\n\nThe proposal, which will be put to a national referendum on July 25, would enshrine the significant steps he has taken over the past year to dismantle the North African nation’s young democracy.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\n\nAs Tunisia’s Democratic Experiment Unravels, Economic Collapse Looms\n\nThe president is consolidating one-man rule while the economy, sapped by mismanagement, the pandemic and war in Ukraine, flails. Groups that helped avert a past crisis are largely silent.\n\nBy Vivian Yee"
