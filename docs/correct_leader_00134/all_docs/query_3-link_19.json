        "text": "Demonstrators run as police throw tear gas during a demonstration in Tunis, Jan. 14, 2011. The stunning collapse of Tunisia's long-ruling president brought cheers from the streets and a wave of support from Arab communities and reformists around the world.\n\nTunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (seen in a Nov. 7, 2011 file photo). The 74-year-old leader came to power in a bloodless coup in 1987. He took over from a man formally called President-for-Life, Habib Bourguiba, the founder of modern-day Tunisia who set the Muslim country on a pro-Western course after independence from France in 1956. Ben Ali removed Bourguiba from office for \"incompetence,\" saying he had become too old, senile and sick to rule, and promised that his leadership would \"open the horizons to a truly democratic and evolved political life.\" But after a brief period of reforms early on, Tunisia's political evolution stopped.\n\nThousands of angry demonstrators marched through Tunisia's capital Jan. 14, 2011, demanding the resignation of the country's autocratic leader. The violence in Tunisia flared after weeks of protests that initially focused on unemployment, sparked by the suicide of a young graduate who set himself alight on December 17, 2010. U.S. diplomatic cables recently released by WikiLeaks called Tunisia a \"police state,\" and described the corruption there, saying Ben Ali had lost touch with his people. Social networks like Facebook helped spread the comments - to the delight of ordinary Tunisians who have complained about the same issues for years.\n\nTunisian security forces personnel clash with demonstrators in Regueb, near Sidi Bouzid on January 10, 2011. At least 35 people have been killed in rioting that erupted over the weekend, International Federation for Human Rights president Souhayr Belhassen told AFP.\n\nThe body of a Tunisian protester killed in clashes with security forces lies in the mortuary in a hospital in Tala on January 9, 2011. Eight people were killed and nine wounded this weekend in the deadliest incidents yet in a wave of protests in Tunisia sparked by food prices and unemployment, the interior ministry said.\n\nRioters desperate for jobs defied their autocratic president in escalating unrest.
