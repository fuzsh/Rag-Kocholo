        "text": "The legislative and presidential elections held on 24 October 1999 were marked by major procedural modifications to the Constitution and the Electoral Code in connection with the process of democratisation and political pluralism under way since 7 November 1987.\n\nAs for elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the changes concerned the total number of deputies as well as the number of seats allotted to lists which did not obtain a majority. Five years ago, a quota of 19 seats (out of 163) was set for these lists. This year, out of the total number of seats to be filled, namely 182, 34 were not set aside for the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD), the presidential party. As per the results, five opposition parties, the Democratic Socialist Movement (MDS), the Unionist Democratic Union (UNU), the People's Unity Party (PUP), the Renovation Movement and the Liberal Social Party (PSL), divided up the 34 seats which are by law reserved for parties which did not obtain an absolute majority of votes in the legislative elections.\n\nAs a result of these elections, the number of women deputies virtually doubled (21 up from 11).\n\nIn the presidential elections, for the first time in the country's history, there were three candidates, namely, outgoing President Zine El-Abidine Bel Ali, Mr. Mohemed Belhaj Amor, Secretary General of the People's Union Party (PUP) and Mr. Abderrahmen Tlili for the Union Democratic Union (UDU). President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali was re-elected for a third and last term as per the present Constitution of Tunisia. One month after the elections, President Ben Ali announced the appointment of Mr. Mohamed Ghannouchi to the post of Prime Minister. Several changes were made in the composition of the government, including the establishment of a ministry in charge of human rights, communication and relations with the Chamber of Deputies, and the appointment of four women to the Government."
