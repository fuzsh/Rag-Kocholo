        "text": "About 1,000 protesters gathered in Tunis outside interim Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi's office, shouting for him to resign.\n\nThey said the government should be rid of holdovers from the regime of former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who quit on Jan. 14 after ruling the country for more than 23 years.\n\nThe march was held as a three-day mourning period ended for dozens of people killed in anti-government protests.\n\nThe government put the official death toll at 78 from weeks of street protests leading to Ben Ali's flight to Saudi Arabia more than a week ago, while UN officials say more than 100 people died.\n\nSome protesters who turned out Sunday waved photos of the young man whose self-immolation triggered the popular uprising that overthrew the president.\n\nMohamed Bouazizi, 26, set himself on fire in the town of Sidi Bouzid on Dec. 17 to protest against harassment by municipal officials, who reportedly demanded he pay bribes to sell produce.\n\nOn Sunday, protesters carried a makeshift coffin draped in a Tunisian flag as a symbol of those who died while taking part in the uprising.\n\nEarlier in the day, demonstrators broke down barbed-wire barriers to rally outside the prime minister's office, some waving photos of Bouazizi and others killed in the unrest.\n\nSoldiers and police looked on and stood guard at the doorway of the office as protesters chanted and staged sit-ins.\n\nOther countries in northern Africa have experienced similar rallies and self-immolations after what some are calling the \"Jasmine Revolution,\" for the scented flower that is common in Tunisia.\n\nPublic gatherings of more than three people are banned under a state of emergency announced shortly before Ben Ali fled the country Jan. 14.\n\nOn Sunday, Tunisia's official news agency said police placed two former allies of Ben Ali under house arrest and are looking for a third.\n\nSenate President Abdallah Kallel was placed under house arrest, the TAP agency reported. He was stopped from leaving the country after Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.\n\nA former adviser, Abdelaziz Ben Dhia, was also placed under house arrest and police are looking for political adviser Abdelwaheb Abdallah.\n\nOn Friday Ghannouchi, a longtime Ben Ali ally, pledged to quit politics after elections he said would be held as soon as possible.\n\nA vote is expected to be held within six months, although no date has been set.\n\nOn Saturday, Tunisia's once-feared police staged a rally of their own, demanding better salaries and insisting they were not to blame for shooting deaths among protesters who forced the North African country's longtime autocrat to flee.\n\nIt was a significant development for Tunisia where police were widely feared under Ben Ali's regime.\n\n[GALLERY id=4350 cat=news]"
