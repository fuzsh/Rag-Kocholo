        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nTunisia has been the nexus of many different colonizations including those of the Phoenicians (as early as the 12 century B.C.), the Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, various Arab and Berber kingdoms, and the Ottomans (16th to late 19th centuries). Rivalry between French and Italian interests in Tunisia culminated in a French invasion in 1881 and the creation of a protectorate. Agitation for independence in the decades following World War I was finally successful in convincing the French to recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956. The country's first president, Habib BOURGUIBA, established a strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. In November 1987, BOURGUIBA was removed from office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup. Street protests that began in Tunis in December 2010 over high unemployment, corruption, widespread poverty, and high food prices escalated in January 2011, culminating in rioting that led to hundreds of deaths. On 14 January 2011, the same day BEN ALI dismissed the government, he fled the country, and by late January 2011, a \"national unity government\" was formed. Elections for the new Constituent Assembly were held in late October 2011, and in December, it elected human rights activist Moncef MARZOUKI as interim president. The Assembly began drafting a new constitution in February 2012 and, after several iterations and a months-long political crisis that stalled the transition, ratified the document in January 2014. Parliamentary and presidential elections for a permanent government were held at the end of 2014. Beji CAID ESSEBSI was elected as the first president under the country's new constitution. Following ESSEBSIâs death in office in July 2019, Tunisia moved its scheduled presidential election forward two months and after two rounds of voting, Kais SAIED was sworn in as president in October 2019. Tunisia also held legislative elections on schedule in October 2019. SAIED's term, as well as that of Tunisia's 217-member parliament, expires in 2024. On 25 July 2021, SAIED seized exceptional powers allowed under Tunisia's constitution to fire the prime minister and suspend the legislature.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Libya\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n34 00 N, 9 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 163,610 sq km\n\nland: 155,360 sq km\n\nwater: 8,250 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 93\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than Georgia\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,495 km\n\nborder countries (2): Algeria 1,034 km; Libya 461 km\n\nCoastline\n\n1,148 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 12 nm\n\nClimate\n\ntemperate in north with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers; desert in south\n\nTerrain\n\nmountains in north; hot, dry central plain; semiarid south merges into the Sahara\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Jebel ech Chambi 1,544 m\n\nlowest point: Shatt al Gharsah -17 m\n\nmean elevation: 246 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, phosphates, iron ore, lead, zinc, salt\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 64.8% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 18.3% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 15.4% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 31.1% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 6.6% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 28.6% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n3,920 sq km (2013)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nNorth Western Sahara Aquifer System\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the population is located in the northern half of the country; the south remains largely underpopulated as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nflooding; earthquakes; droughts\n\nGeography - note\n\nstrategic location in central Mediterranean; Malta and Tunisia are discussing the commercial exploitation of the continental shelf between their countries, particularly for oil exploration\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n11,896,972 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 80\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Tunisian(s)\n\nadjective: Tunisian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nArab 98%, European 1%, Jewish and other 1%\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official, one of the languages of commerce), French (commerce), Berber (Tamazight); note - despite having no official status, French plays a major role in the country and is spoken by about two thirds of the population\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nÙØªØ§Ø¨ Ø­ÙØ§Ø¦Ù Ø§ÙØ¹Ø§ÙÙ Ø Ø£Ø­Ø³Ù ÙØªØ§Ø¨ ØªØªØ¹ÙÙ Ø¨Ù Ø§ÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ø§Øª Ø§ÙØ£Ø³Ø§Ø³ÙØ© (Arabic)\n\nThe World Factbook, une source indispensable d'informations de base.

Through its introduction of a national family planning program (the first in Africa) and by raising the legal age of marriage, Tunisia rapidly reduced its total fertility rate from about 7 children per woman in 1960 to 2 today. Unlike many of its North African and Middle Eastern neighbors, Tunisia will soon be shifting from being a youth-bulge country to having a transitional age structure, characterized by lower fertility and mortality rates, a slower population growth rate, a rising median age, and a longer average life expectancy.\n\nCurrently, the sizable young working-age population is straining Tunisiaâs labor market and education and health care systems. Persistent high unemployment among Tunisiaâs growing workforce, particularly its increasing number of university graduates and women, was a key factor in the uprisings that led to the overthrow of the BEN ALI regime in 2011. In the near term, Tunisiaâs large number of jobless young, working-age adults; deficiencies in primary and secondary education; and the ongoing lack of job creation and skills mismatches could contribute to future unrest. In the longer term, a sustained low fertility rate will shrink future youth cohorts and alleviate demographic pressure on Tunisiaâs labor market, but employment and education hurdles will still need to be addressed.\n\nTunisia has a history of labor emigration. In the 1960s, workers migrated to European countries to escape poor economic conditions and to fill Europeâs need for low-skilled labor in construction and manufacturing. The Tunisian Government signed bilateral labor agreements with France, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, and the Netherlands, with the expectation that Tunisian workers would eventually return home. At the same time, growing numbers of Tunisians headed to Libya, often illegally, to work in the expanding oil industry. In the mid-1970s, with European countries beginning to restrict immigration and Tunisian-Libyan tensions brewing, Tunisian economic migrants turned toward the Gulf countries. After mass expulsions from Libya in 1983, Tunisian migrants increasingly sought family reunification in Europe or moved illegally to southern Europe, while Tunisia itself developed into a transit point for Sub-Saharan migrants heading to Europe.\n\nFollowing the ousting of BEN ALI in 2011, the illegal migration of unemployed Tunisian youths to Italy and onward to France soared into the tens of thousands. Thousands more Tunisian and foreign workers escaping civil war in Libya flooded into Tunisia and joined the exodus. A readmission agreement signed by Italy and Tunisia in April 2011 helped stem the outflow, leaving Tunisia and international organizations to repatriate, resettle, or accommodate some 1 million Libyans and third-country nationals.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 25.28% (male 1,529,834/female 1,433,357)\n\n15-24 years: 12.9% (male 766,331/female 745,888)\n\n25-54 years: 42.85% (male 2,445,751/female 2,576,335)\n\n55-64 years: 10.12% (male 587,481/female 598,140)\n\n65 years and over: 8.86% (male 491,602/female 546,458) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 50.9\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 36.3\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 13.3\n\npotential support ratio: 7.5 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 32.7 years\n\nmale: 32 years\n\nfemale: 33.3 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 107\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.69% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 129\n\nBirth rate\n\n14.62 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 119\n\nDeath rate\n\n6.36 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 143\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-1.33 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 154\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the population is located in the northern half of the country;

After the revolution and a series of terrorist attacks, including on the countryâs tourism sector, barriers to economic inclusion continued to add to slow economic growth and high unemployment.\n\nÂ\n\nFollowing an ill-fated experiment with socialist economic policies in the 1960s, Tunisia focused on bolstering exports, foreign investment, and tourism, all of which have become central to the country's economy. Key exports now include textiles and apparel, food products, petroleum products, chemicals, and phosphates, with about 80% of exports bound for Tunisia's main economic partner, the EU. Tunisia's strategy, coupled with investments in education and infrastructure, fueled decades of 4-5% annual GDP growth and improved living standards. Former President Zine el Abidine BEN ALI (1987-2011) continued these policies, but as his reign wore on cronyism and corruption stymied economic performance, unemployment rose, and the informal economy grew. Tunisiaâs economy became less and less inclusive. These grievances contributed to the January 2011 overthrow of BEN ALI, further depressing Tunisia's economy as tourism and investment declined sharply.\n\nÂ\n\nTunisiaâs government remains under pressure to boost economic growth quickly to mitigate chronic socio-economic challenges, especially high levels of youth unemployment, which has persisted since the 2011 revolution. Successive terrorist attacks against the tourism sector and worker strikes in the phosphate sector, which combined account for nearly 15% of GDP, slowed growth from 2015 to 2017. Tunis is seeking increased foreign investment and working with the IMF through an Extended Fund Facility agreement to fix fiscal deficiencies.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$114.97 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$125.78 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$124.48 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 81\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n2% (2017 est.)\n\n1.1% (2016 est.)\n\n1.2% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 139\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$9,700 (2020 est.)\n\n$10,800 (2019 est.)\n\n$10,800 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 143\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$38.884 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n6.7% (2019 est.)\n\n7.2% (2018 est.)\n\n5.3% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 193\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: B (2020)\n\nMoody's rating: B2 (2018)\n\nStandard & Poors rating: N/A (2013)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
