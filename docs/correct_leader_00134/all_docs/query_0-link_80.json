        "text": "Tunisia's former President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali has died in exile aged 83, his family says.\n\nBen Ali led the country for 23 years and was credited with delivering stability and some economic prosperity.\n\nBut he received widespread criticism for suppressing political freedoms and for widespread corruption.\n\nIn 2011, he was forced from office following mass street protests. This triggered a wave of similar uprisings across the Arab world.\n\nAt least half a dozen countries in the region saw their president fall or conflicts break out in the wake of the former Tunisian leader's downfall, in what became known as the Arab Spring.\n\nAnalysis by Richard Hamilton, BBC News\n\nTunisia's autocratic former president brought stability but little freedom to the country.\n\nHe came to power in 1987, ousting Habib Bourguiba to become Tunisia's second-ever president. He promised reform, democracy, women's rights and education.\n\nBut he failed to deliver a more free and open society.\n\nIn a diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks, a US ambassador described how the Ben Ali family was widely viewed as a \"quasi-mafia\". It spoke of a \"nexus of corruption\" which bled the country dry.\n\nAnd while he did bring some economic growth, no-one was really fooled by his three consecutive \"99.9%\" election victories.\n\nHis strict control of society shored up by a vast network of spies, informers and secret police kept Ben Ali in power. But in the end anger against that obsessive control proved to be his undoing.\n\nHe acted too slowly to stem the tide of that unexpected popular uprising."
