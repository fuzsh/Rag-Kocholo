The RCD is a socialist party.\n\nThe RCD congress passed a motion calling on Ben Ali \"to continue to drive Tunisia in the way of progress and prosperity\".\n\nBen Ali won the 2004 presidential election with 94.49 per cent of the vote.\n\nTunisia's budget deficit is forecast to reach 4.7 per cent in 2008, up from 3.5 per cent in 2007, as the government struggles to pay for subsidised fuel (MEED 11:7:08)."
