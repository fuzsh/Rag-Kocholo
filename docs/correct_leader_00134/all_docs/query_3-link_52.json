        "text": "Background: Fighting for the Revolution’s Values\n\nOn December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi, a young fruit cart vendor in Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia, set himself on fire outside of the local governor’s office in protest against government corruption and police harassment. This act of self-immolation set off a massive chain of events, with groups staging large public demonstrations throughout the country calling for “jobs, freedom, and national dignity.” The protests drove President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali out of office one month later and inspired protests against authoritarian rule throughout the region. Since then, the home of the Arab Spring has embarked on a process to deal with its past and preserve the gains of the revolution.\n\nBouazizi’s individual act prompted such widespread protests because it tapped into major socioeconomic and political grievances that had been fomenting for decades. Protests that started with calls for the government to address Bouazizi’s death grew to general demands for economic and political reforms. Demonstrations increased in size and organization as major social forces, including the Tunisian General Labor Union and the Tunisian Bar Association, got involved.\n\nThe revolution began in regions of the country that had long been marginalized and economically disadvantaged under Ben Ali’s rule. Youth in those areas were particularly hard hit by the lack of opportunities and high levels of unemployment. In the years before the revolution, unemployment had grown steadily, especially in southern, rural regions (where the unemployment rates hovered around 22 percent between 2004 and 2010), and among college-educated young people, for whom the unemployment rate reached 20 percent in 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, corruption and conspicuous consumption among the country’s elite, particularly Ben Ali and his family, intensified public frustration. In addition, the government became increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of dissent. Surveillance, harassment, imprisonment, and torture of political activists, as well as torture of criminal suspects, was reportedly common under Ben Ali’s administration.\n\nAfter the Revolution\n\nWithin a year of Bouazizi’s protest, Tunisians had taken firm steps toward instituting democratic rule. They elected a new National Constituent Assembly that, in addition to mandating a new constitution, drafted laws to guide the transition, including a transitional justice law. After surviving successive political crises, Tunisia’s parliament passed the Transitional Justice Law in December 2013.\n\nThe law set out a comprehensive framework to address violations committed during the period of dictatorship and the years immediately following the revolution (from July 1955 to December 2013) by revealing the truth about past abuses, providing reparations to victims, and pursuing criminal accountability for serious crimes. The law established the Truth and Dignity Commission (TDC), as the official truth-seeking body to investigate and report on past abuses, and created the Specialized Chambers to pursue criminal accountability for specific past violations, a key component of the transition.\n\nThe Specialized Chambers have jurisdiction over serious violations including deliberate killing, rape and any form of sexual violence, torture, enforced disappearance, and execution without fair trial. The TDC also referred cases to it relating to election fraud, financial corruption, misuse of public funds, and forced migration for political reasons.\n\nThrough its Transitional Justice law, Tunisia confirmed its commitment to a transition based on accountability for the past, respect for victims’ rights, and adherence to international standards.\n\nOn July 25, 2021, President Kais Saied seized control of the government, suspending the parliament and proceeding to govern by decree. The move has had a direct impact on the Dignity and Rehabilitation Fund for the Victims of Totalitarianism (hereafter “the Dignity Fund”), which is tasked with delivering reparations to victims: Its head was dismissed, and no official information has since been available about its work.\n\nTruth and Dignity Commission\n\nThe Truth and Dignity Commission (TDC) was Tunisia’s official truth-seeking body. It was charged with investigating and reporting on past human rights violations, making recommendations for reparations and institutional reforms, and issuing urgent reparations.\n\nThe TDC collected 65,000 complaints submitted by individuals as well as collectively. The TDC hosted a series of public hearings to give victims a platform to share their stories and worked with Tunisian journalists to cover the historic proceedings. It transferred 204 cases to the Specialized Chambers by the end of its mandate in December 2018."
