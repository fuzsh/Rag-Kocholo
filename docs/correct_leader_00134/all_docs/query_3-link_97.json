        "text": "On 27 December 1992, President of the Republic Zine el Abidine Ben Ali announced that the next presidential and parliamentary elections would take place in March 1994 and introduce political pluralism in the Chamber of Deputies. The exact date was ultimately set on 7 November 1993.\n\nThe campaign lasted from 6 to 18 March. As a result of the new Electoral Law (mentioned above), six legally-constituted opposition parties challenged the ruling Democratic Constitutional Rally (Rassemblement constitutionnel démocratique – RCD), which held all the seats in the outgoing Parliament. On the other hand, the Islamist Al-Nahda party was proscribed from running. Altogether some 630 candidates were in contention for the enlarged Chamber’s 163 seats but these did not include some 60% of the RCD incumbents who did not seek re-election. Mr. Ben Ali was the sole presidential candidate. He underlined the country’s economic growth and general stability under his administration.\n\nPolling day, monitored by foreign observers, saw a high voter turnout and a total RCD triumph for the 144 constituency seats as some opposition groups alleged electoral fraud. The 19 “national” seats were allotted to four parties, topped by the Mouvement des Démocrates socialistes (MDS). Mr. Ben Ali, for his part, was re-elected President for a second five-year mandate with 99% of the votes."
