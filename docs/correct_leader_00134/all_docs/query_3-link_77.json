        "text": "WASHINGTON — The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (U.S. Helsinki Commission) announced the following briefing:\n\nElections and Political Transition in Tunisia\n\nThursday, October 13, 2011\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nB-318 Rayburn House Office Building\n\nOn January 14, 2011, longtime President of Tunisia Zine el Abidine Ben Ali fled the country following weeks of mounting anti-government protests. Tunisia’s mass popular uprising, known as the “Jasmine Revolution,” sparked anti-government and pro-reform movements in other countries across the region, and precipitated the Arab Spring. On October 23, 2011 Tunisia will hold national elections to select a transitional, 218-seat “National Constituent Assembly,” which will be charged with drafting a new constitution and preparing for presidential and parliamentary elections. Please join us for a discussion of what these elections will mean for the consolidation of democracy in Tunisia and throughout the region.\n\nScheduled to make presentations:"
