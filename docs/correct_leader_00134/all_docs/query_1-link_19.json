        "text": "Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali has stepped down after 23 years in power as protests over economic issues snowballed into rallies against him.\n\nPrime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi has taken over as interim president, and a state of emergency has been declared.\n\nMr Ben Ali left Tunisia with his family, and has since arrived in Saudi Arabia, officials said.\n\nEarlier, French media said President Nicolas Sarkozy had rejected a request for his plane to land in France.\n\nA Saudi palace statement said Mr Ben Ali arrived in the country early on Saturday, according to the official SPA news agency.\n\n\"Out of concern for the exceptional circumstances facing the brotherly Tunisian people and in support of the security and stability of their country... the Saudi government has welcomed President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and his family to the kingdom,\" the statement said.\n\nThe protests started after an unemployed graduate set himself on fire when police tried to prevent him from selling vegetables without a permit. He died a few weeks later.\n\nDemonstrations came to a head on Friday as thousands of people gathered outside the interior ministry, a symbol of the regime, and many climbed onto its roof. Police responded with volleys of tear-gas grenades.\n\nPresident Ben Ali, who had already promised to step down in 2014, dissolved his government and the country's parliament, and declared a state of emergency.\n\nThen, in a televised address on Friday afternoon, the prime minister announced that he would be taking over from President Ben Ali.\n\nMr Ghannouchi, 69, a former finance minister who has been prime minister since 1999, promised to \"respect the law and to carry out the political, economic and social reforms that have been announced\"."
