Tunisia's former President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali has died in exile aged 83.

He led the country for 23 years and was credited with delivering stability and some economic prosperity.

In 2011, he was forced from office following mass street protests. This triggered a wave of similar uprisings across the Arab world.

At least half a dozen countries in the region saw their president fall or conflicts break out in the wake of the former Tunisian leader's downfall, in what became known as the Arab Spring.

Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia when he left office.

His funeral will take place in Saudi Arabia today.
