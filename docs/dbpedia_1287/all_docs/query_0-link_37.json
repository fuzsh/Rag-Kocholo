Eyemart Express ranks number 7 as the nation's largest optical retailer. We also operate under the names Vision4Less, VisionMart Express and Eyewear Express. In their infancy, they were not much more than a functional optical operation, spending little energy on aesthetics. From the store signs to the displays, they took the minimalist approach. However, as they continued to grow so did their style. Their waiting areas are comfortable and their floors have significant space to browse through their impressive frame selection. Polished walnut display cases replaced folding tables. Eyemart Express is the 7th largest optical retail in the United States with over 151 locations in 34 states.
