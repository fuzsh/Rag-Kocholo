        "text": "An experienced senior retail executive has moved into the corner office at Eyemart Express.\n\nThe national optical retailer has appointed Mike Nuzzo as CEO, effective immediately. He succeeds interim CEO Jason Shanks, who has served in the role since April and will return to his roles as general counsel and head of managed vision care operations.\n\nMost recently, from 2020 to 2022, Nuzzo served as COO and president of Petco Services. During that time, he helped develop its pet care center and veterinary strategy, as well as transforming its pet service offerings to improve customersâ omni-channel shopping experience. Prior to joining Petco in 2015, Nuzzo was an executive VP and CFO at General Nutrition Centers (GNC).\n\nPreviously, he served in various financial and operational leadership roles at Abercrombie & Fitch, including senior VP of finance.\n\nâMike is a decisive leader with significant retail experience whose appointment as CEO of Eyemart Express reflects his seasoned senior management experience and ability to positively impact a companyâs growth and performance,â said Chris Harris, co-managing partner of FFL Partners and chairman of Eyemart Express. âWe would like to thank Jason Shanks for his dedication to the organization, and his impressive contributions as interim CEO during this executive leadership transition.â\n\nBased in Farmers Branch, Texas, Eyemart Express has 239 stores in 42 states, with banners that include Vision 4 Less, Visionmart Express and Eyewear Express. The company has opened more than 60 new stores since 2018, and reported positive same store sales growth for 10 of the past 11 years. On-site lens labs in stores allow for delivery of glasses in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nâEyemart Express has positioned itself as a leader in the eyewear retail space and I look forward to working with their talented team as we continue to fulfill the vital need for fast service and prescription vision care, while generating positive clinical outcomes for our customers,â said Nuzzo.\n\nâAs Eyemart Express continues to shape the optical retail industry, I am excited that Mike, an incredibly talented executive with an exceptional track record, will be leading the team,â said David Kass, principal at Leonard Green & Partners. âHis unique perspectives and expertise in strategy, operations and growth will drive deeper awareness and preference for Eyemartâs affordable, convenient, fast and pleasant customer experience.â"
