        "text": "VIENNA – A new eye clinic has opened in Vienna, part of a national chain with three other locations in West Virginia.\n\nDr. Barnes’ Eyemart Express, commonly called Eyemart Express, held a grand opening and ribbon cutting on Monday at its newest location, at 900 Grand Central Ave. in Vienna.\n\nCompany officials and clinic employees were joined by representatives of the Chamber of Commerce of the Mid-Ohio Valley and other local dignitaries for the ceremony, which was held Monday morning, on its first day of business.\n\nThe new clinic in Vienna includes an office for Dr. Matt Weaver, an optometrist who offers examinations and other services, along with an on-site lab to prepare glasses in about one hour.\n\nThe Vienna location is open 9 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturdays. The clinic is closed on Sundays.\n\nVienna Mayor Randy Rapp was among those who participated in the grand opening.\n\n“It’s just wonderful to welcome a new business to Vienna. They’ve taken a corner (at Ninth Street and Grand Central Avenue) which has been vacant for a long time and are turning it into a wonderful facility,” Rapp said.\n\n“It has great visibility, as you come up Grand Central Avenue it just jumps out at you. It’s wonderful to have a company with this national exposure to come to Vienna,” he said.\n\n“We are excited to open our fourth location in the West Virginia area. Eyemart Express is devoted to bringing shoppers value combined with the convenience of an in-store optical lab,” said Dr. Doug Barnes, company owner and chairman. “Our concept is built around providing a great selection of brand name frames at prices lower than the competition along with the convenience of one-hour service. In fact we’ve lowered prices to give an even better value to our customers.”\n\nEyemart Express opened its first store in 1990 in Appleton, Wis., and has since grown to 136 stores in 33 states."
