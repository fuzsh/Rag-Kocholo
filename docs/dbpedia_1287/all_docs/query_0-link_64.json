Optical retailer Eyemart Express (eyemartexpress.com), known for providing quality prescription eyewear with free same-day service thanks to its local lens labs, is celebrating its first Lincoln store that opened on October 17. The new store at 5001 O St. marks the second Eyemart Express storefront in Nebraska. The company has been in business for more than 30 years, and expanded to the state with its Omaha location in 2020.\n\nApproximately a dozen new jobs are created with the new Lincoln store, ranging from full- and part-time sales associates to lab technicians and opticians. Eyemart Express is still hiring for some positions. The optical retailer offers a variety of training and development programs to cultivate career paths in the optical industry along with a competitive benefits package for all associates.\n\nThe optical retailer makes it easier for locals to get new glasses with just one stop. Shoppers can get an exam from the independent eye doctor next door to the Eyemart Express store or they can simply send an updated prescription to the store. They have more than 2,000 frames for adults and kids from brands like Ray-Ban, Coach, Versace, and Paw Patrol. Eyemart Express has glasses for everyone and every budget. Glasses start at just $19. All frames come with a free one-year warranty, providing shoppers with additional value."
