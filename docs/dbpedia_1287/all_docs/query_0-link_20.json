        "text": "Eyemart Express Doubles Footprint in Indiana\n\nAffordable eye care now more accessible from start to finish in Hoosier State\n\nNational optical retailer Eyemart Express is expanding its footprint in Indiana with the opening of four new stores this spring. The company is known for helping people see clearly faster with its convenient and affordable approach to eye care that can be completed from start to finish—that is, from comprehensive eye exams to finished glasses—all in one day. By May 15, new storefronts in Avon, Columbus, Evansville, and Fishers will mark the company’s first presence in the Evansville and Indianapolis markets and more than double Eyemart Express’ existing footprint in Indiana. The optical retailer currently has locations in Elkhart, Granger, and Fort Wayne.\n\nEyemart Express’ growth in the Hoosier State will create more than 50 new full- and part-time jobs, ranging from sales associates to lab technicians and opticians. The retailer offers a variety of training and development programs to cultivate career paths in the o\"ptical industry along with a competitive benefits package for all associates. Eyemart Express seeks to fill additional positions, which can be found here.\n\n“We are proud to provide important eye care services in a fast and accessible way to more communities in Indiana,” says Mike Nuzzo, Eyemart Express CEO. “The ability to see is so much bigger than a pair of glasses. Our unparalleled optical solution with on-site doctors, skilled associates, and on-site lab techs, helps customers see clearly faster, so special moments in life are never missed again.”\n\n“Furthermore, our growth creates new and exciting career opportunities at a time when job stability is of utmost importance to many.”\n\nAt Eyemart Express, expert in-store lab techs can deliver quality glasses with free same-day speed—over 80% of glasses are finished in one hour. The optical retailer carries more than 2,000 frames for adults and kids at affordable prices from popular brands like Ray-Ban, Coach, Versace, and Paw Patrol. Some products, such as those with complex prescriptions, may require additional time.\n\nIn addition, Indiana shoppers can either visit independent eye doctors conveniently located next door to Eyemart Express stores for a comprehensive eye exam or they can bring in an existing prescription from their eye doctor.\n\nThe four new Eyemart Express storefronts are located at:\n\nAvon: 9774 E. U.S. Highway 36\n\nColumbus: 1425 N. National Road\n\nEvansville: 6436 E. Florida St., Ste. 102\n\nFishers: 8240 E. 96th St., Ste. C\n\nEyemart Express locations are open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Stores are closed on Sunday."
