        "text": "May is Healthy Vision Month, and Eyemart Express wants to take this opportunity to remind everyone about the importance of proper eye care. While maintaining healthy vision should always be a priority, this past year has seen many people put off what needs to be done for their eyesight. In order to ensure that everyone’s eyes are feeling and working at their best, Eyemart Express, a leading national optical retailer known for providing high-quality prescription eyewear in as little as 30 minutes, offers a few easy steps that people can take to maintain and improve their vision.\n\nMany adults have held off on getting comprehensive eye exams or updating prescriptions for new glasses due to concerns over exposure to COVID-19. But, as with any health-related condition, early detection is key, especially for eye diseases that can result in vision loss, such as macular degeneration or glaucoma.\n\nTo help people refocus on eye care, Eyemart Express offers four easy steps one can take:\n\nMonitor warning signs: Experiencing headaches, tired eyes, eyestrain, and blurry vision are just a few indicators that your vision needs an immediate checkup.\n\nSchedule an eye exam: The American Academy of Ophthalmology (or AAO) recommends that those over the age of 40 should get annual eye exams to keep prescriptions current, check for eye diseases, and help preserve vision longer. The risk for glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration increases at that age. Also, if vision loss is part of your family medical history or you have diabetes, it is important to get regular eye exams. Make an appointment with your optometrist or one of the independent doctors located in or next to an Eyemart Express store.\n\nFind new frames: Not only is fit important to avoid slippage, it also can help reduce headaches from too-tight frames and eyestrain from inadequate lenses. All Eyemart Express stores nationwide have a selection of more than 2,000 affordable frames from brands like Ray-Ban, Coach, and Nike. Trained opticians can help you find the right fit for your prescription and comfort.\n\nAdd protective lenses: The AAO recommends wearing protective lenses like polarized lenses for sunglasses, which block UV rays that can cause cataracts and retinal damage. Also, consider other lens treatments for your glasses to protect your eyes from daily tasks. UltraXBLU lenses shield the eyes against the blue light emanating from laptops, computers, smartphones, and other electronic screens; and UltraXAR, which reduces glare to prevent eyestrain.\n\nEyemart Express continues to operate all stores with the highest safety standards in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or CDC) guidelines.\n\nEyemart Express is the VFW’s exclusive eye care partner and offers all VFW members a 20 percent discount off glasses frames, lenses, and accessories, with a valid membership card.
