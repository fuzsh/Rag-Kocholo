        "text": "the good old bait 'em in with the 2 fer then upgrade the crap out of the lenses and charge as much as the B & M stores ... *sigh* it just warms my little heart\n\nThe frames aren't awful, but by the time the patient gets what they actually want/need it costs a bunch of cash so they really aren't saving anything. plus I think the company who owns them owns davis vision ... or at least has a viva affiliation. so who wants that??!! they fill a niche though.\n\nI used to be a lab manager for one of the stores, but haven't worked there since 2012. It definitely fills a niche for those who have the opinion that glasses shouldn't ever cost more than $60, or those who need a backup pair on the cheap. But at least in my area, even after upgrades and whatnot, the whole sale still may not exceed $250 for two pairs. But the highest end lens that we had by the time I left was the Essilor Natural. Nowadays I guess they use some old Hoya lenses that they've renamed to something else. They do offer an \"HD\" lens, which I think I heard is a Hoyalux Summit. They had contracts with a lot of trade insurances (Operating Engineers, Wisconsin Carpenters, and the like), as well as Spectera/VIPA/Davis, and an out of network option for VSP. Not good, not terrible. Better than Stanton, anyway."
