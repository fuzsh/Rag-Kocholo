Displayed in the front window was a HUGE sign that says \"NOW ACCEPTING VSP, ASK US FOR DETAILS.\" What is going on? I thought VSP was only for independents not discount chains. Anyone know about this? Is VSP OK with this type of advertising?\n\nMade for exciting conversation at dinner. Sorry Honey!!:(\n\nBob,\n\nI just got off the phone w/M****** at the Eyemart in Sherman Texas...\n\nQ: Do you take VSP\n\nA: Uh..no we don't. We give a 20% discount, and if you submit the paperwork, you'll get reimbursed. We can't take it because the doctor has to own....\" And then they went into the same old story about VSP and ownership.\n\nSo, to answer your question, \"No\" they do not accept VSP."
