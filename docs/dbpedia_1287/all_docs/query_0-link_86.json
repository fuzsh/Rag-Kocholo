Mine calls for me to have $600 towards glasses, but vision for less says I can only get one pair. Last yea I had the $600 and I bought 4 pairs of glasses. I love this store. I have to take one back so they can put it on my sunglasses. I still feel I should have enough for another pair or at least I shouldn't have to pay for the Bifogals on my sunglasses. To some it up I think I should be able to spend $600.\n\nRead full quote\n\nAliviah Inx\n\nAliviah Inx\n\nFeels Disappointed | Dec 11, 2022\n\nCalled a week ago about the way the manager responded to me walking into the store not being disruptive. Still never got a callback from anyone after calling customer service to let them know. I was not being disruptive or doing anything like that did not go behind the counter and the manager called and asked me to leave the store better yet demanded that I leave the store.\n\nRead full quote"
