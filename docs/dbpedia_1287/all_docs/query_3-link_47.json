I have been to other clinics with remote screenings, but they were far from thorough, and often feel very clinical and lacking warmth and care. This is not the case with the 20/20Now experience. I appreciate the customer service. Michelle was my in-house tech, and she was amazing and friendly. I will come back.\n\nMagdiel Enriquez\n\nI really liked this place ! Clean and fast service. They were also super nice and walked me through every step of the eye exam process ! I recommend it :)\n\nLady Bella\n\nWhat a great experience. I took my daughter who was very nervous. They were so friendly made us feel at home. Very knowledgeable and extensive eye exam. Definitely will be returning and recommend to all my friends and family."
