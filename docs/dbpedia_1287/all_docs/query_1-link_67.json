        "text": "Farmers Branch, Texas-based optical retailer Eyemart Express LLC has opened a store at 15319 E. Indiana, in Spokane Valley, its second in the Spokane area, says T.J. Perry, Dallas-based marketing manager.\n\nLike all Eyemart Express stores, the new operation carries more than 2,000 eyeglass frames, says Perry. Brands offered include in-house options as well as designer names such as Calvin Klein, Kate Spade, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Nike, Ray Ban, and Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nEyemart Express’ Spokane Valley store also has an onsite lab to make eyeglasses, says Perry. Instead of clients having to wait for a few days for their order to come in, most glasses can be purchased and picked up on the same day with a valid prescription.\n\nThe store has 10 employees, says Perry.\n\nAn independent optometrist office—Serenity Eye Care LLC—is located next door, he says.\n\nSerenity Eye Care also has an office at 7808 N. Division, an address shared with Eyemart Express’ other Spokane-area store.\n\nPerry says the Division Street Eyemart Express also has an onsite lab.\n\nThe Spokane Valley site will hold grand opening events from Monday, Oct. 29, to Saturday, Nov. 3, he says.\n\nEyemart Express was founded in 1990 with its first store in Appleton, Wis.\n\nThe chain opened its 100th store in 2009 and has since grown to 188 stores in 36 states, says Perry."
