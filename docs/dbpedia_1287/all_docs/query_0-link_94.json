        "text": "A Dallas-based value optical retailer is filling its top marketing position with an internal promotion.\n\nEyemart Express has named Katy Hanson to chief marketing officer, effective immediately. Hanson has served on the organizationâs leadership team as interim chief marketing officer since January 2021.\n\nPrior to this, Hanson spent two years as the retailerâs VP of strategy and planning. As chief marketing officer, she will continue to lead Eyemart Expressâ marketing operations, including strategy development and implementation of multichannel media plans such as advertising, digital marketing, local store marketing, and brand initiatives.\n\nHanson offers three decades of experience working in strategic marketing and communications. Prior to joining Eyemart Express in 2016, Hanson held leadership roles at Blockbuster and Michaels Stores. She served as the craft retailerâs VP of Marketing, overseeing marketing initiatives across channels, including digital marketing, advertising, brand management, and the retailerâs in-store experience.\n\nâKaty has shown the ability to adapt in an ever-changing environment and engage customers with our brand in new ways,â said Michael Bender, Eyemart Express CEO. âI am excited that she is officially joining our senior leadership team and look forward to the positive impact she will continue to have on our company. As Eyemart Express grows and evolves, Katyâs understanding of our customers, culture, and Eyemart Family is invaluable.â\n\nâThis is an exciting time at Eyemart Express and I look forward to continuing the momentum we have built to innovate our position in the optical industry,â said Hanson. âI am thrilled to have this opportunity to amplify our ability and services to improve peopleâs lives by helping them see better and deepen our connections with the communities that we serve across the country.â\n\nEyemart Express has been filling out its C-suite this year. In May 2021, the retailer named Femi Enigbokan to the newly-created role of chief growth officer, which will focus on expanding the companyâs footprint."
