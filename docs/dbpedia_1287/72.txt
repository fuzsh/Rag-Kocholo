Eyemart Express LLC. ("Eyemart" or “We”) offers brand advocates (“Advocates” or “You”) the opportunity to participate in its referral program (the “Program”). We reserve the right to amend or terminate the Program at any time, for any reason. The Program is administered by Eyemart.

Advocates are bound by these Terms and Conditions by participating in the Program. By participating in the Program, Advocates agree to use the Program in the manner specified in these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions in their entirety, you are not authorized to register as an Advocate or to participate in the Program in any other manner. Advocates may not participate in the Program where doing so would be prohibited by any applicable law or regulations.

We reserve the right to modify or amend at any time these Terms and Conditions and/or the methods through which rewards are earned. We reserve the right to disqualify any Advocates from participation in the Program at any time at our sole discretion, including without limitation if he/she does not comply with any of these Terms and Conditions or otherwise fails to comply with any applicable laws (including, without limitation, through any failure to include any disclosures as required by the FTC or otherwise required by Eyemart).

Children.

No part of the program is directed to persons under the age of 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, YOU MAY NOT USE, ACCESS OR PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.

I. How the Program Works

A. Program Participation, Generally

To participate in the Program, Advocates should send their personal referral code to friends, family members or colleagues so it can be scanned when they make a purchase. Advocate’s referral code can be found:

In the footer of any Eyemart Marketing email message sent after 11/01/2022

At eyemartexpress.com/lander/referral – click the “Forgot My Code” link and enter the email associated with your Eyemart purchases.

Individuals who receive a referral via an Advocate are "Friends" (or, singly, a “Friend). An "Eligible" Advocate who is fully compliant with these Terms and Conditions may receive "Reward(s)" for every "Qualified Referral” (all terms in quotes to be understood as defined below).

By participating in the Program, an Advocate represents that he or she has his or her Friend's prior consent to provide their email addresses.

B. Eligible Advocate

To be "Eligible," an Advocate must:

Be a legal resident of the United States of America or Canada

Be at least 18 years old.

Have an email ddress associated with their Eyemart Account, and

Be subscribed to Eyemart’s email newsletters.

Companies and employees of Eyemart, their subsidiaries, affiliates, or promotional agencies, including immediate family and household members, are not eligible.

C. Making a Referral

An Advocate must have an email address associated with their Eyemart Account/Purchase history. Advocates can go to Eyemartexpress.com/account/create to register. A previous purchase is required (New & existing Eyemart customers are eligible.) Once an Advocate is eligible, he/she will be provided a unique referral code ("Personal Code") to be shared with Friends that allows the Advocate to receive rewards for Qualified Referrals ("Rewards").

Advocates must respect the spirit of the Program by only referring real individuals who meet the requirements of these Terms and Conditions. Advocates cannot refer themselves. For example, an Advocate may not create multiple or fake accounts with Eyemart or participate in the Program using multiple or fake email addresses or identities.

D. Qualified Referrals

A “Qualified Referral” means that all the following conditions are met:

The Friend completed a purchase of (i) at least $75, using the Advocate’s Personal Link. If a Friend does not provide the Referral Code at time of purchase, the transaction will not count as a Qualified Referral and the Advocate will not earn Credit.

The Friend is a) a legal resident of the United States of America or Canada and b) at least 18 years old;

An Advocate may earn a Qualified Referral for each Friend, up to a maximum of $1000 in Rewards value per calendar, unless otherwise allowed by Eyemart. Any additional or subsequent referrals made by an Advocate will not be considered Qualified Referrals and thus not be entitled to the Reward. No partial rewards will be given.

E. Earning Rewards

Advocate shall receive in his or her email one (1) reward (each, a “Reward”) in the form and value determined by Eyemart for each verified Qualified Referral generated by Advocate. An Advocate may earn a maximum of $1000 in Rewards value per calendar year for Qualified Referrals. Any additional or subsequent referrals made by an Advocate will not be considered Qualified Referrals and thus not be entitled to the Reward. No partial rewards will be given.

Rewards may be redeemed in various forms in the Eyemart's sole discretion, including, but not limited to in the form of an Amazon.com* gift card. Restrictions may apply. For example, if the Reward is in the form of a gift card, gift certificate or voucher, it may be subject to the issuer's terms and conditions.

F. Verified Qualified Referrals

Rewards are subject to verification. Eyemart may delay a Reward for the purposes of investigation. Eyemart may also refuse to verify and process any transaction Eyemart deems, in its sole discretion, to be fraudulent, suspicious, in violation of these Terms and Conditions, or believes will impose potential liability on Eyemart, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents. All of Eyemart's decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a Qualified Referral, or Reward is verified.

G. Transfer and Value of Credit and Rewards

Rewards have no monetary value and may not be redeemed for cash. Rewards are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered or sold. Upon termination of the referral program or any portion thereof for any reason, or upon cancellation of a Referrer's Eyemart account for any reason, any unredeemed Rewards that have not yet been delivered to Referrer are forfeited.

II. Privacy

Advocates may participate in the Program made available by Eyemart in order to refer their Friends to Eyemart as potential Eyemart customers. To do this, Advocates must necessarily associate an e-mail address with their Eyemart account data at eyemartexpress.com/account/create, so that Eyemart can send communications to the Advocate. The personal information will be collected, processed and used in accordance with Eyemart's Privacy Statement, which can be found at https://eyemartexpress.com/support/privacy. Advocates understand that, in addition to the initial communications about the Program, Eyemart may also send additional communications to the Advocate in order to provide information about this, and other Eyemart programs/Offers. The personal information may also be used by Eyemart to contact Advocates with regards to their participation in the Program and to send to Advocates additional communications from Eyemart.

Bulk email distribution, distribution to strangers, or any other promotion of a Personal Code in a manner that would constitute or appear to constitute unsolicited commercial email or "spam" in Eyemart’s sole discretion is expressly prohibited and may be grounds for immediate termination of the Advocate's account and deactivation of the personal link.

Eyemart has no obligation to monitor the content provided by Advocates; however, Eyemart may choose to do so and block any email messages, remove any such content, or prohibit any use of the Program.
