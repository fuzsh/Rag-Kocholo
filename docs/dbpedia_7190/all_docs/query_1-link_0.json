In addition to sequences with audible dialogue or talking sequences, the film features a synchronized musical score and sound effects along with English intertitles. The soundtrack was recorded using the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system. The film survives in a copy of the International Sound Version. The sound of the domestic part-talkie version was synchronized to the surviving print of the international sound version. Because of this, many scenes feature intertitles shown immediately after the spoken dialogue conveying the same words. The talking sequences on the international sound version were muted with music and intertitles were inserted to convey the dialogue replaced in the appropriate foreign language. Therefore, intertitles were left in the talking sequences during the restoration to maintain synchronization with the Vitaphone soundtrack. The story is from a 1914 novel by Elinor Glyn, the famous novelist. The film was produced by Richard A. Rowland and released by First National Pictures. A British silent film had been film of the same story in 1918.[2][3]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo young people get married for the wrong reasons, and after being chased for a day, they decide they belong together.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBillie Dove as Joan\n\nRod La Rocque as Michel\n\nGwen Lee as Viola\n\nRobert Schable as Skippy\n\nCharles Sellon as Joan's Guardian\n\nGeorge Bunny as Butler\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film features a theme song entitled \"Just A Lucky Moment\" which was written by Ray Perkins.\n\nPreservation\n\n[edit]\n\nA restored and complete version of the film was screened July 4, 2015 at the Il cinema ritrovato festival in Bologna, Italy.[4] The film was released on DVD by Warner Home Video in 2016.\n\nThe film wasn’t included to the Associated Artists Productions' packages, as Warner Bros. is currently hold the distribution rights.[5]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Man and the Moment (1918)\n\nMad Hour (1928)\n\nList of early sound feature films (1926–1929)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
