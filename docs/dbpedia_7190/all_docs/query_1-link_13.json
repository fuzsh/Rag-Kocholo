        "text": "A verb must agree in person and number with its subject.\n\nIncorrect: My friend, with his parents, are flying in today to visit me and my family.\n\nWhen the subject of the sentence does not agree in number with the verb, the sentence lacks subject-verb agreement. To preserve the subject-verb agreement, singular subjects take verbs marked for singular. Plural subjects must have verbs that are marked for plural.\n\nCorrecting Faulty Subject-Verb Agreement\n\nErrors typically occur when the writer does not know whether the subject is singular or plural.\n\nIn the sentence above, friend is the only subject and the verb are flying should be in singular form (is flying) to agree with it in number. The phrase with his parents is a prepositional phrase and not part of the subject, so it has no effect on the verb form.\n\nCorrect: My friend, with his parents, is flying in today to visit me and my family.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nCorrect: Neither my mother nor my sisters are coming to visit me this summer.\n\nSubjects Followed By Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases such as with, together with, along with, as well as are not part of the subject and, therefore, have no effect on the form of the verb. The verb needs to agree in number only with the subject of the sentence.\n\nIncorrect: Laura, together with a friend, practice yoga every day.\n\nCorrect: Laura, together with a friend, practices yoga every day.\n\nCompound Subjects\n\nCompound subjects joined by and need a plural verb.\n\nCorrect: Healthy diet and regular exercise are a necessity for a longer, happier life.\n\nWhen the compound subject is joined by or, nor, neither... nor, either... or and one part of the compound subject is singular and the other part is plural, the verb needs to agree with the part closest to it.\n\nIncorrect: Neither students nor their teacher are participating in this play. Correct: Neither students nor their teacher is participating in this play.\n\nTime and Amount Nouns\n\nSubjects that express time or amount also take a singular verb.\n\nCorrect: Forty thousand is an average starting salary for a Computer Science graduate.\n\nTitles and Country Names\n\nTitles and names of countries take the singular form of the verb.\n\nCorrect: The Netherlands is a European country that borders Belgium.\n\nTake Quiz\n\nPrevious\n\nNext"
