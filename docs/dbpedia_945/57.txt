Northumbria Press

Northumbria Press was created as an imprint of Northumbria University Press publishing vibrant and authoritative books across a wide range of subjects, including music, photography, biography and travel.

Following a management buyout in December 2011, all titles published under the Northumbria Press imprint have been transferred to the independent publisher McNidder & Grace.
