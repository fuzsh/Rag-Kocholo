Northumbria University is "urgently" investigating after an online uproar over a tweet posted from a university lecturer's Twitter account.

The tweet features an image of Jeremy Corbyn, altered to show him reading from a notorious anti-Semitic forgery.

The accompanying text mirrors the style of the book We're Going on a Bear Hunt.

The book's author, Michael Rosen, has condemned the tweet as "loathsome and anti-Semitic". The member of staff has been approached for comment.

The image in the tweet has been manipulated to make it seem like the MP and former Labour leader is reading to children from a book called The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion.
