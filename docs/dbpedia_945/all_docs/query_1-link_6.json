Wherever you choose, you’re going to spend three to five years there, so if possible take the time to visit each of your chosen universities to get a feel for where you’ll be living.\n\nGut instinct will often guide you – and sometimes it’s the best way! Pay attention to how you feel as you walk around the campus and the city. Ask current students. What have they got to say about their experiences and does that sound like what you want?\n\nYou also might like to consider things like:\n\nAre you more at home in a big city or a more rural location?\n\nDo you like the hustle and bustle of a city campus, or would you prefer a smaller community campus?\n\nHow about the distance from your home and transport links?\n\nI WANT to live in the best student city\n\nNorthumbria University is located right in the heart of Newcastle upon Tyne - voted the UK’s best student city for three years running in a survey by MSN Travel*. However, you’ll enjoy the best of both worlds – you’re only half an hour away from stunning blue flag beaches, historic castles and rambling countryside. Even better, getting to them is really easy; the North East is connected by Tyne and Wear’s Metro and a great bus network. The region is well connected by rail, road and air too – just three hours from London by rail and 1.5 hours from Leeds and Edinburgh."
