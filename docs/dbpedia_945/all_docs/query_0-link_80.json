Collins and Brown.\n\nRegional Centres\n\nThe rise of several Free Press centres – community presses dedicated to cheap printing for local organisations - allowed for the creation of several regional centres of underground or alternative comic publication.\n\nBirmingham: The most significant of these regional centres was Ar:zak in Birmingham. It’s most significant artist was Hunt Emerson, who became a major British underground figure, and also worked for mainstream publications like the BBC’s Radio Times magazine and drew Firkin the Cat for Fiesta magazine. His style was dynamic and easily accessible, and showed the clear influence of American cartoonists. Ar:Zak also featured the work of David Noon, who gave a bold design feel to the comics, which were already probably most graphically sophisticated of UK underground comics at the time.\n\nFigure 11 . David Noon, Street Comix 2, 1976\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne: The Junior Print Outfit was the brainchild of comic artist Angus McKie. As well as science fiction cover illustrations and commercial work for publications as diverse as House of Hammer, Metal Hurlant/Heavy Metal, McKie had been published in Cozmic Comics’ Half Assed Funnies. After an accidental meeting at the Tyneside Free Press in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1977 McKie joined forces with Mike Feeney, myself and Alan Craddock to form the Junior Print Outfit, and produced two issues of Either Or Comics. Difficulties with printing and full time jobs restricted output, leading to an A5 four page Neither Nor Comics.\n\nFigure 12 . Neither Nor Comic, 1977\n\nThe final publication of the group was Comic Tales, a full colour hardback comic produced in conjunction with Titan books.\n\nFigure 13 . Advertising poster for Comic Tales, 1982\n\nEdinburgh: In 1978 Rob King’s Near Myths featured a range of artists, and most notably Bryan Talbot’s Luther Arkwright. The comic had full colour covers and was well produced, but it only lasted five issues. It also included early work by Grant Morrison.\n\nBy 1976 there were enough of these groups, and of course London based creators, to organise KAK – the Konvention of Alternative Komics (although notice already the dropping of underground for the more user-friendly alternative). This was followed by KAK 77, with both events organised by Chris Welch and Hunt Emerson. Interest in the field also led Mal Burns to produce Comix Index in 1977, which attempted to list all artists and writers who had appeared in British underground comics up to that point.\n\nFigure 14 . Title page of Comix Index. Caricature of Mal Burns by John Higgins\n\nThis publication was invaluable to me when I later undertook a PhD on the subject, completed in 1990, which, with additions and changes, turned into the book Nasty Tales.\n\nDecline\n\nThe general increase in interest in comics led the comics historian Denis Gifford to produce Ally Sloper, named after the important nineteenth century English comics character. However the mix of the nostalgic (reprints of work by earlier artists like Terry Wakefield) new work by major contemporary professionals (Frank Hampson and Frank Bellamy) and ‘underground’ artists (Hunt Emerson, Kevin O’Neill) seemed to be to just too diffuse to find an audience, and it only lasted four issues.\n\nFigure 15 . Ally Sloper letterhead, latter to the author, 1976\n\nAs Cozmic Comics and Nasty Tales folded by 1975, the final phase of what might be called underground comics in the UK centred again on London, and the more professionally produced Graphixus and Pssst, despite their achievements, became the death throes of the form (although not in mainland Europe, but that is a whole different story). Graphixus was an ambitious title featuring, amongst many others, Brian Bolland, with his work sometimes being controversial, particularly his ‘Little Nympho in Slumberland’ strip. Yet again the comic failed to find a big enough audience, and editor Mal Burns explained its demise;\n\n‘Graphixus, surprisingly enough, was doing better and better. It was actually let down by what was, in retrospect, was an extremely self-indulgent and obscure title. It was actually going to change to High Vision with number seven. The problem was my American distributor going bankrupt on me. I never got paid.’ (interview with the author)\n\nPssst was the most ambitious of all the later British ‘alternative’ comics. Bankrolled by Frenchman Serge Boissevain, it was also edited by Mal Burns, (and Paul Gravett amongst others). It featured some full colour strips and was vaguely based on similar French adult comic models. Despite a lavish outlay the comic struggled for good distribution and a solid market. It lasted ten issues and finished in 1982, but not before it had published work by veterans like Bryan Talbot, Mike Mathews, all of the Junior Print Outfit and newcomers like Glenn Dakin.3\n\nFigure 16. David Huxley, ‘Mike Brutal’, Pssst, 10, 1982\n\nTalbot comments, ‘Pssst was ahead of its time, but it was designed by committee and reputedly lost one hundred thousand pounds. There were five good issues out of ten.’ (interview with the author) The one exception to this decline was Hassle Free Press (an ironic title if ever there was one) which morphed into Knockabout Comics, although they were partially dependant on American material, in particular Gilbert Shelton and Crumb. Tony Bennett at Knockabout survived legal problems to import Crumb’s material, and Knockabout Comics became the home of Hunt Emerson, and published many other underground artists, including Bryan Talbot, Kevin O’Neill and Mike Mathews. History repeated itself in that Knockabout’s censorship problems and customs seizures caused great problems but lead to an outstanding comic in response – The Knockabout Trial Special, in 1984.\n\nFigure 17 . Hunt Emerson, The Knockabout Trial Special, 1984\n\nLegacy\n\nOne obvious legacy of British undergrounds was the nurturing of homegrown talent that went on to make significant contributions to comics as a whole (and particularly the US mainstream). Writers Alan Moore and Grant Morrison and artists Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons and Kevin O’Neill all honed their skills on British undergrounds.\n\nBritish undergrounds also helped to spread the idea, begun in America, that comics could address a whole range of issues in a whole range of styles. The listing of British underground comics done for my PhD and appearing in Nasty Tales ended in 1982 partially because new ways of producing comics (such as easily accessible and cheap photocopying) made any comprehensive listing impossible. The list, looking back, is woefully inadequate even for the earlier periods. On the other hand these methods, and all the technological advances that followed, mean that small run comics of all kinds are very easy to produce. The underground comics mentioned here provided the inspiration for many later artists. Thus a significant legacy of the underground is that it is possible in many cities across the world to find comics shops that stock a small number of eccentric, unpredictable small publications in amongst the mighty output of DC and Marvel.\n\nOh yes, I forgot to try and define underground comics, comix, alternative and ground level comics…\n\nNotes\n\n1. Leo Baxendale was the creator of many longstanding British comic characters (mainly for Dundee based D C Thomson) including the Bash Street Kids, Minnie the Minx and Little Plum.\n\n2. As well as the article in Art and Artists, Patricia Dreyfus discussed the impact of the underground on graphic designers in 'The Critique of Pure Funk' in Print, November/December, 1971, p.13.\n\n3.

Collins and Brown.\n\nDavid Huxley is the editor of The Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics (Routledge). He was a senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University until 2017. He has written widely on comics, including works on various artists, underground and horror comics, superheroes and also popular film. He has also drawn and written for a range of British comics, including Ally Sloper, Either or Comics, Pssst, Oink and Killer Comics. His most recent publication is Lone Heroes and the Myth of the American West in Comic Books 1945-1962 (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018).\n\nNaturally, in a time of Mary Whitehouse’s Viewers’ and Listeners’ Association, the provocative material of Action did not go unnoticed. Push against authority and it pushes back. The Evening Standard article was followed by headlines in The Sun – “Sevenpenny Nightmare!” (30th April 1976) and the Daily Mail’s “Comic Strip Hooligans” (17th September 1976). With the media already widely reporting the scourge of football hooliganism, when Lefty Lampton’s girlfriend Angie defended him by throwing a bottle at an opposition player, the Football League along with World Cup referee and magistrate Jack Taylor were quick to criticise. And then, infamously, because of an alleged colouring error, the cover of the 18th September issue appeared to feature a chain brandishing youth threatening a cowering policeman (above).\n\nThe backlash culminated with John Saunders being interviewed on the BBC1 magazine programme, Nationwide, climaxing, depending on which recollection you believe, with the presenter tearing up a copy of Action live on air.\n\nAction had sailed too close to the wind and its days were numbered. Pat Mills and Steve MacManus feel that without their close involvement the new editorial team had become reckless and overconfident, to the point “where well-plotted, fast-moving action scenes began to be replaced with random violence on the apparent premise that this was what readers wanted” (MacManus, 2016, p. 70). However, fearing the backlash, Action did attempt to self-correct:\n\nThe original stories had already begun to be toned down. Alterations were made to both text and art before going to press. “Kids Rule O.K.” had half a page removed entirely because of the graphic violence taking place as a battle raged between the Malvern Road Gang and a group of enthusiastic Police Cadets. In “Death Game 1999”, new artist Massimo Belardinelli drew a particularly spectacular panel featuring the death, by explosion, of Karson City Warden Kruger. The panel was obscured by a giant white BA-ROOM!, entirely covering the disembodied portions of Kruger’s corpse. (Harris, 2016A, para.14)\n\nSadly, the die was cast and the 23rd October 1976 issue was withdrawn before sale and pulped. A combination of the enemy within (the old guard at IPC was never happy with changes that Action represented), mainstream media criticisms and threats of a boycott of all IPC publications from major newsagents saw the end of Action. Martin Barker recalls the impact on the readers:\n\nThrough the streets of Brixton (truly – several people have recalled this) and no doubt through many other places, rang the cry: “THEY’VE TAKEN AWAY OUR COMIC!” Action, the most important comic for a generation, the one comic in thirty years to win a genuine loyalty from its readers, had gone in for a terminal operation (Barker, 1990, p. 4).\n\nI recall my own local newsagent gleefully informing me when I turned up to collect my reserved copy that the comic was over, because it wasn’t deemed acceptable for the likes of me. Of the 200,000 pulped copies a limited number of that 37th issue have apparently survived – one edition changing hands on eBay in 2016 for £4,000 (Freeman, 2016, para. 2).\n\nAction did return a couple of months later but it had been defanged. It limped on until November 1977 before merging with another comic – as Moose Harris colorfully describes it, when “Action’s carcass was consumed by Battle” (2016B, para. 1), before quietly fading away.\n\nOn the plus side, Mills had learned from the experience, so when the opportunity arose to develop a new comic, the science fiction title 2000AD (1977-present), he took advantage of the genre’s ability to smuggle in a little rebellious social commentary. As The Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling once remarked, “Things which couldn’t be said by a Republican or a Democrat could be said by a Martian.” (King, 2013, para. 15). Interviewed in the documentary Future Shock! (Goodwin, 2014), Mills recalls he once again found himself developing a counter-culture comic, his seditious ways fanned by his unpopularity within the IPC establishment.\n\nThe more they tried to push things down the more I kind of worked against it, and that actually is responsible for a lot of the energy that 2000AD has, which the readers responded to.\n\nUltimately, this is the legacy of Action. Speaking about the so-called British Comic Book Invasion of the 1980s, which saw many 2000AD creators working for DC and Marvel, US editor Karen Berger felt that the Vertigo imprint’s spirit of subversiveness, anarchy and rebellion came from 2000AD (Goodwin, 2014) – a spirit that had been forged within the pages of Action. One contributor to the British Invasion was writer Grant Morrison:\n\nThe Americans expected us to be brilliant punks and, eager to please our masters, we sensitive, artistic boys did our best to live up to our hype. Like the Sex Pistols sneering and burning their way through “Johnny B. Goode,” we took their favourite songs, rewrote all the lyrics, and played them on buzz saws through squalling distortion pedals… Most important for me, we were encouraged to be shocking and different (Morrison, 2011 cited by Ecke, 2019, p. 157).\n\nBibliography\n\nBarker, M.

What is it about The Beano that is worth exploring further in an academic context?\n\nAh, the Beano. Possibly the most successful British comic of all time, sadly now just a husk of what it once way. Formulaic – but what a formula! So damned inventive in its simple, short, repetitive story-lines with wickedly funny characters. Who doesn’t love Minnie the Minx, or the Bash Street Kids? For a number of years I gathered all kinds of materials, including sample issues from all its decades, references to it, interviews with writers and artists (I remember with deep affection my meetings with Leo Baxendale). But it was beyond me. I should have known that I never really didn’t have the skills or the time to do this. I think there is something really interesting about the way the Beano found its métier and format the height of the changes in schools in the UK in relation to class, in the 1950/1960s. I can’t now recall in sufficient detail how I thought this might go, but there was something about a confluence of influences – the puritanism+market instinct of D C Thomson, its publishers, the changes in schooling and relations of kids to parents and authority – which found expression in the comic, its characters and their storylines. Sad to say, it is another of quite a long list of things that I have wondered about doing, across my researching years, but it ain’t going to be done by me, now.\n\nQ: Although you do not identify as a fan, or aca-fan, of comic books, you energetically argue that you “live in this damned country at this damned time and comics are part of my and my children’s lives. And I now say this passionately: let us have as many of the things as we possibly can. In the face of the capital-calculating machine called Thatcherism which uses morality like murderers use shotguns, all the little things like comics matter.” Although written in the context of 1980s Britain, can you expand further on this rhetorical framing?\n\n‘Imagination’ is to me a really important term, but it doesn’t have a great history, as something to be thought about. I remember someone – I can’t remember who, to be honest – pointing out the different ways people tend to gesture when they use the words ‘imagination’, and ‘fantasy’. With ‘imagination’, hands tend to go up and wave animatedly in the air, as though something light and breezy was being welcomed. With ‘fantasy’, chins go down slightly as though something heavy and slightly disreputable was being named. Nowadays this shows in the ways in which the arts (what Lynn Conner calls ‘high value arts’ …) are sought, praised, encouraged, studied, compared to the ways – even now – that popular media materials are considered. I have wanted to reclaim the ways many kinds of cultural materials can help us conceive and wish beyond ourselves and our present circumstances. I remember the expression used by one young woman whom I ‘interviewed’ (it was done at a distance, by a posted tape recording, way back in the 1980s), who said that her comics were important to her because they ‘let you see how far you could see’. I absolutely love the openness of that phrasing. You are right, I did write that in the 1980s – as part of the Afterword to my big Comics and Ideology book. I must confess I wrote that in a hurry, at the explicit behest of my publisher, who felt the book lacked an ending. I am not disavowing it at all, by saying that. But it needs expanding, and in a sense I think a lot of the work I have done since, on audiences for various kinds of ‘fantasy’ is that expansion. Perhaps the thing I have done that is most directly in line with it, is the essay I did out of the pornresearch project, on the ‘problems’ of sexual fantasies (it appeared in Porn Studies in 2013). ‘Imagination’ and ‘fantasy come trailing debates, in ways that impede real research.\n\nQ: What first drew you to the medium as an analyst?\n\nIrena C*****a. It’s all her fault. She was a final year student at Bristol Polytechnic (around 1981/2), who asked if she could do her dissertation on Superman, using Carl Jung as her implement. Of course she could – though it struck me as a pretty arbitrary choice of ‘theorist’. But I had no idea how to supervise her. So I went to the library and searched the (then card-index) catalogue, to see what I could find to help frame her work. There was almost nothing. But one thing, one small pamphlet, caught my eye. It was by someone called George Pumphrey, entitled Comics and Your Children (published by the Comics Campaign Council in 1954). And it talked about a ‘horror comics campaign’. I was of course a child of that period, but had never heard of anything like this. So, a streak of sheer bloody-mindedness took hold of me, and I decided I would try to find out what this thing was that my parents – who were brilliant and lovely people, but very traditional – had shielded me from even knowing about. I was also inclined against and distrustful of censorship, but without having thought deeply about it – I had lived through the campaigns to abolish censorship of theatre, and the struggles over D H Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley. So, I went into the task of (a) trying to uncover what had happened in the campaign, and (b) gathering and looking at some of the comics concerned, to try to make sense of this ‘missed’ period of my childhood. I have to say that comics are not a medium that I respond that strongly to, until, that is, I have a reason to examine them closely. Then, I begin to appreciate their shape and complexity. But it doesn’t come to me naturally. So, I had a lot of fun analysing in detail ‘The Orphan’, that infamous story from 1953 that Jack Kamen drew. But had I not had a motive for studying it closely, I doubt it would have lingered long in front of me.\n\nQ: In much of your work, the concept of ideology is centre-stage. What are your thoughts on ideological analysis conducted without speaking to audiences? How does your ‘dialogical approach to ideology’ attempt to re-situate the argument, and why did you think it was necessary?\n\nYou must understand first of all that the period I tackled this was a kind of high water mark of attempts to theorise and research the concept of ‘ideology’. Dozens of books were written about the concept – and even one or two important empirical studies (I am thinking nostalgically about the Dominant Ideology Thesis, and the work of several brilliant social historians). There were endless disquisitions about the place of ‘ideology’ within Marx’s theory. The concept reverberated with important anti-colonialist movements. By the end of the 1980s, however, the term was largely being dropped, replaced by the softer/looser, less demanding ‘discourse’ – which then easily pluralised into ‘discourses’.\n\nBut at the time, it felt important to think how one might formulate a conception of ideology that didn’t ignore questions of evidence about ‘influence’ (in some versions, ‘ideology’ was the left-wing version of the ‘effects’ tradition). And I tried to do this, through a long struggle with the ideas of Valentin Volosinov, the Russian linguist – for whose work I still have a huge admiration. I suspect that my chapter on ‘A dialogical approach to ideology’ shows all the signs of having been a struggle to make sense of a really difficult book – but I think it still stands up. The key concept at the end of the struggle, is Volosinov’s concept of ‘little speech genres’: that is, located and historically specific modes of speaking and hearing that carry within them the results of all kinds of struggles to manage (bits of) the social world. I am sure that it would not be difficult to build links and connections to some of Antonio Gramsci’s works on the politics of culture. But Volosinov was the key, to me. ‘Power’ in ideology thus became not like ‘effects’ or ‘affordances’ or anything like that – it became a function of the operations of institutions which provide homes to ‘little speech genres’. Is that the same as Foucault’s notion of distributed discourses? I don’t think so – but I can see that the topic deserves debate.\n\nQ: In From Antz to Titanic, you write that scholars who write about audiences without speaking to audiences end up ‘constructing figures of the audience’ through ‘imputation’. What do you mean by this?\n\nI’m not alone in this. There is now a strong body of really good scholarship on what I have called ‘figures’, and what others have called ‘images’, or ‘myths’, or ‘presumptions’ of the audience. Perhaps my favourite book on this is one that is a bit weird, but hugely interesting: Edward Schiappa’s Beyond Representational Correctness (2008). Schiappa is a very ‘American’ (in the sense of the methods he uses) communications researcher, who examines the ways scholars of television in particular arrive at conclusions about the impact of shows on their audiences from forms of textual enquiry. He simply and insistently asks: can we check and see if these claims can be operationalized and tested? OK let’s mount a small experiment … And of course they don’t stand up. Still, who cares? Our fields are generally not that taken with the idea of ‘testing claims’.\n\nBut where Schiappa is particularly concerned with strands of academic thinking and practice, I am as much concerned with the role of claims about the audience in the general public arena. Some of these are so small and local as to matter not a whit: when a reviewer asks ‘what will the audience make of this?’, then s/he is not making strong claims about the unity and vulnerability of viewers. But the claims are often carried forward by more disturbing rhetorics, and by images (I have in my collection an illustration from the Daily Mail from the time of the video nasties campaign, showing a horned creature watching the TV screen, implying without saying that the ‘nasties’ are the work of the devil, with a headline screeching that children are being ‘taken over by something evil from the screen’ …). So I prefer the term ‘figure’ because it reaches more widely. It includes everything from those relatively benign use of the expression ‘the audience’ by reviewers, to highly condensed and charged claims about what must be happening as ‘they’ read/watch/listen to whatever ignites the fury of moral campaigners. Sometimes they construct semi-coherent ‘theories’ of how the ‘effects’ they fear are generated. Sometimes they work simply by denunciation. But it has long struck me as part of the responsibility of people in our (relatively privileged academic) situations, to try to draw out their claims, examine them in broad daylight, and bring expertise to bear on testing them. Sadly, too many who work in our fields are content just to contribute to their construction rather than their testing – nowhere more so, in my experience, than in people who work with ‘spectatorship theory’.\n\nI happened to re-read the other day a short piece I wrote in Screen in 2002, about academic responses to David Cronenberg’s film Crash, which was the locus of one of my first big audience research projects (with two colleagues, Jane Arthurs and Ramaswami Harindranath). I talked about my (genuine, not put-on) astonishment that hardly one film academic spoke up in defence of the film, when it was attacked for over a year in the UK, the Daily Mail making all kinds of stupid claims about its ‘dangers’. Instead, Screen published a series of ‘analyses’ of the film which, when I looked at them, were built on a kind of up-side-down version of the Mail was claiming about the film. The Mail and its allies were scared that the film might ‘arouse’, or ‘heat up’ people’s interests in sex and cars. The academic analyses were all about the question of whether the film was ‘cool’, ‘distancing’ (because if it wasn’t, that was a ‘bad sign’). All in the name of ‘film theory’… I found – and still find – that kind of thing simply irresponsible.\n\nIntroduction: How do you know what you know?\n\nWilliam Proctor\n\nI hope everyone had an opportunity to take a breather over the Christmas holidays, and have now woken up in 2020 all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!\n\nWe return to the ‘Remembering UK Comics’ series this week with a special interview with Professor Martin Barker, who I’m sure many comic studies scholars know from A Haunt of Fear: The Strange History of the British Horror Comics Campaign (Pluto Press, 1984) ,Comics: Ideology Power and the Critics (Manchester University Press, 1989), and Action: The Story of a Violent Comic, (1990), all of which provide exceptional, insightful studies of the medium, its receptions, and its audiences.\n\nI first became aware of Martin’s work as an undergraduate at Sunderland University in the North-East of England, courtesy of Professor Clarissa Smith (who was incidentally supervised by Barker for her PhD, which became the excellent monograph One for the Girls! The Pleasures and Practices of Reading Woman’s Porn, 2007). Martin’s work upended everything I thought I knew about audiences, about media effects, about academic studies that were built on less than solid grounds for the vaunted claims that were being made. More often than not, Martin’s work—and indeed, Martin himself—challenged me to maintain a vigilant watch on my assumptions and prejudices, which of course we all have whether we care to admit it or not. One of the questions Martin once asked me over dinner one evening actively threw me into a philosophical tailspin for days, a seemingly innocuous question that I believe has served me well ever since. I don’t recall what we were discussing, but the question is there, burned on my brain for all-time, a scholarly scar that I’m especially proud of.\n\nHow do you know what you know?\n\nI didn’t know how to answer that at all! I know what I know because I know it? That’s a tautology if ever there was one!\n\nI believe that Martin was asking a simple question about the epistemological foundations of whatever argument or position I was espousing. This kind of query underscores a lot of Martin’s work over the past four decades or so (at least in my reading). I want to expound further as I think it’s an important point that Martin was making.\n\nHow do you know what you know?\n\n“Erm, I’ve read books and stuff”?\n\nThat just won’t cut it with Martin.\n\nIf we reframe Martin’s question, it becomes even simpler:\n\nWhat evidence do you have that supports your claims?\n\nLet me offer an example from Martin’s work that should challenge and provoke our common-sense beliefs.\n\nIn one article, Martin diligently pursues the thorny concept of ‘identification’, a concept that has oftentimes been mobilized by American Behavioral ‘Scientists’ to establish, and thus prove, that casual links exist between fictional media and the behavior of its audiences. Many readers probably understand this model interchangeably as the ‘magic bullet,’ or ‘hypodermic needle’ theory, terms which can be understood as part of the so-called media effects tradition. In very basic terms, the media effects tradition treats audiences as little more than empty containers to be filled up by insidious and sinister ‘messages’ transmitted by ‘the media’ (whether TV, film, comics, and what have you).\n\nIn many ways, ‘media effects’ has long been empirically debunked for decades in academic circles, or I should say, in some academic circles. It is perhaps surprising that the concept lives on, and remains a powerful way of (mis)understanding the way in which media forms ‘do stuff’ to us, be that psychologically, behaviorally, and/ or emotionally. Many embracers of ‘media effects’ have found it difficult to provide solid foundations for their claims, primarily because the tradition is akin to a house of cards trying to maintain its structure in a hurricane. Yet it persists.\n\nIn relation to ‘identification’, Barker writes:\n\n“The concept of ‘identification’ remains a commonly-called upon resource for considering how media audiences might be influenced into taking up moral and cultural positions. Yet very little empirical evidence exists to support its claims; and recent critical conceptual work has undermined many constituent parts of it […] If audiences ‘identify’ with particular media characters, they come to ‘take part’ in the story to a depth where they become open to its ‘values’, or ‘messages’. The concept belongs to a domain of thought concerned with audiences’ vulnerability […] the concept was at work, albeit without the particular word to express it, as early as the 1850s. Its component parts were at work within, for example, 19th-century scares about the influence of Penny Dreadfuls. This is important, for it suggest that we have here a concept that benefits by remaining unclear “(Barker’s italics, 353-54).\n\nAt the heart of Barker’s critique here is that ‘very little empirical evidence exists to support its claims’.\n\nHow many times have we been confronted with claims about media ‘messages’ anchored to the concept of ‘identification’? Unfortunately, it is so much a part of accepted wisdom and common-sense that we don’t tend to query these claims, and some academics continue to mobilize their ‘evidence’ in similar ways. The question, then, ‘how do you know what you know?’, becomes less neutral than it seems at first. It is essentially a question about epistemology, about the empirical foundations that support and do not support scholarly claims in this arena. How many times have you read academic studies that use terms like ‘messages’ without solid foundations provided by empirical data? How have these ideas and concepts been tested?\n\nHow do you know what you know?\n\nI have been very fortunate to have had many opportunities to speak with Martin about these kinds of issues, some of which I admit had never crossed my mind during my PhD years. When I was thinking about conducting a large-scale audience project based around the first Star Wars film under Disney’s control, Martin kindly invited me to his home in Aberystwyth, Wales, to talk through the challenges that he faced, and the methodology he created, on various audience studies: from the Crash controversy of the 1990s and the Sylvester Stallone/ Judge Dredd film to the Lord of the Rings and World Hobbit projects. Martin is very experienced at working with ‘big’ data sets, a ‘richly structured combination of data and discourses’ of a size not that common in academia. Respectively, the Lord of the Rings study captured almost 25,000 responses, while the World Hobbit project garnered 36,109.\n\nOne of the things we discussed at Martin’s home was psychoanalysis. I don’t think Martin would mind if I said that he has been openly critical of psychoanalytic approaches to culture. Indeed, in the introduction to From Antz to Titanic: Reinventing Film Analysis (2000), Martin admits that ‘one of the main motives for writing this book is my dislike of psychoanalytic modes of film analysis’, partly because he has ‘sympathy for students’ frequent sense that to read the stuff is to take forced marches through jungles of jargon, behind whose every frond lurks a phallic snake, biting, accusing’ […] But mainly, I reject psychoanalytic accounts because their findings resolutely refuse any kind of empirical verification (13).\n\nHow do you know what you know?\n\nI explained to Martin that psychoanalysis might well be little more than an intellectual parlor game, replete with assumptions and imputations, but its users have the critical upper hand in a sense. Which is to say, psychoanalysts rely on the ‘subconscious’ as a ‘get out of jail free’ card. One doesn’t need empirical evidence if we’re talking about the subconscious—no-one has access to the subconscious activities of their own, never mind audiences.\n\nMartin’s response was brief yet profoundly impactful on my thinking, and has remained so ever since\n\n“I don’t believe in the subconscious.”\n\nImagine that! What if everything we think we know about the human mind, and the subconscious is not supported by empirical evidence (it isn’t)? Yet like ‘identification,’ perhaps even more so, we use the idea of the subconscious in everyday conversations. It is common-sense, naturally, but it could be nonsense too! Indeed, even the psychoanalytic community have admitted that it’s wholly theoretical and unfalsifiable (and as a consequence, unjustifiable); that is, it can neither be proved or disproved.\n\nTo this, Martin recommended a book by Valentin Voloshinov called Freudianism: A Marxist Critique, a heady text that I wouldn’t recommend for bedside reading. I openly admit that I may not have yet grasped the finer granularities of Voloshinov’s argument—he is one of those theorists that are intensely tough to grasp, in my view— but it is worth checking out all the same.\n\n(I should say that Martin wasn’t saying he’s right and everyone else is wrong. I often view Martin as someone who relishes chucking spanners into the works as a way to complicate and challenge what we believe to be ‘true.’)\n\nThat afternoon, we chatted more about this, and other topics, and I strongly believe that the many discussions we have had over the years has made me a stronger scholar. In many ways, my engagement with the concept of what Bridget Kies and I describe as ‘toxic fan practices’ came about precisely because of the imputations and assumptions made by journalists (and scholars). ‘Why are (some) Star Wars fans so toxic?’ ‘Fandom is so toxic right now.’ ‘The alt-right claims credit for the Last Jedi backlash’.\n\nHow do these commentators know what they know?\n\nWho knows!\n\nI’d like to thank Martin for his work, his generosity, his friendship, and for posing that question while we ate dinner one gloomy night in Newcastle. I am both fortunate and very grateful to have had the opportunity to discuss and debate many topics over the years, discussions that have had such a massive influence and impact on my life in academia thus far.\n\nOh, and Martin kindly passed on his collection of Action to me, with only one rule: ‘enjoy them.’ And I have,. and will continue to do so.\n\nIn the interview that follows, Martin and I discuss his career, with a particular focus on UK comics and those early, seminal studies that anyone interested in not just comics, but audiences, ideology, media effects, politics, etcetera. should most certainly check out. Be careful though: you may need to check your assumptions and prejudices at the door. But that’s not a bad thing. Not at all.\n\nWilliam Proctor\n\n———————-\n\nQ: You’ve done a lot of work on censorship and debunking media effects arguments. Can you say a bit about how the British horror comics campaign fits into bigger debates and trends in censorship practice? What can it teach us?\n\nJust a quick word at the beginning about how and when I did this research. It was in fact my first foray not just into comics research, but also historical and empirical research – and I learnt as I went (it was the early 1980s). That was both lucky and unlucky. Lucky, in that my naivety let me trip over things that might otherwise have remained hidden (particularly when I interviewed surviving campaigners); unlucky, in that it took me quite a few years to learn how to fill in gaps in the historical knowledge (in particular when I finally got round to looking at British Government Cabinet Papers). Unlucky, in that one organisation destroyed key materials just as I was approaching them about the period. Lucky, in that they felt really guilty about this, and so made me a present of a surviving piece of materials which gave me some key insights!\n\nWhat I would now say is this. The anti-crime/horror comics campaigns were simply exceptional, in the sheer number of countries involved (more than 20). But, as emerges very clearly from John Lent’s (1999) Pulp Demons, there were a whole series of local drivers which meant that the local campaigns were in some ways distinctive. And there is no question but that the local colouration of the British campaign owed a great deal to the role played by the British Communist Party, which staffed and financed and motivated the campaign as part of its attempt to attack ‘Americanisation’ of culture. I would say that revealing the part played by the CP, via their various publications on the topic, was a key contribution. I was able to show in particular that there was a decisive shift in their rhetorics in 1953, from talking of ‘American culture vs British heritage’, to ‘horror vs children’ – because it depoliticised the public image of their campaign, and helped to ‘hide’ their involvement. But the price – that they ended up attacking some of the few elements of anti-McCarthyism coming out of America in this period, in the EC Comics – is a horrible irony. These were the EC Comics, which used melodramatic Grand Guignol story-lines to take various strands of extreme American conservatism, nationalism and racism to task."
