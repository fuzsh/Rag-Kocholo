If the publisher is not shown on this list then the material may not be copied or re-used.\n\nThe easiest way to check what publications can be copied under your CLA licence is to use our Check Permissions tool.\n\nFor digital material published outside the UK you will need to refer to the list of International Territories.\n\nPlease note that publishers can exclude specific titles. This will be indicated on the list and the titles can be viewed by expanding the record using the arrow button.\n\nPublishers are listed alphabetically and displayed one letter at a time."
