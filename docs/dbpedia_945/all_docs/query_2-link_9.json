The university really helps with the learning process, and makes sure that we are up to date with parts of our study we may have fallen behind on. My class is full of a range of people and a lot of people from my country who I can relate to.\n\nKhalid Aljimy\n\nInternational Foundation Programme - Engineering\n\nTechnology is fast growing and I wanted to be up-to-date with the tools to work in this field, as many companies are using digital marketing instead of traditional marketing methods\n\nFor me, when I completed my undergraduate degree in Business Administration, I started working in a visa consultation firm and I realised they were using a lot of digital methods to connect with and retain their customers.\n\nVidhi Vadodaria\n\nMSc Digital Marketing with Advanced Practice\n\nI have always found business very interesting. Even when I was younger I used to read magazines that were about business.\n\nI joined this course because I want to gain knowledge and skills that I can use to help my parents when I go back to China after graduation.\n\nShunan Liu\n\nBA (Hons) Business (Top Up)\n\nMy best experience so far is how welcoming the university is to international students.\n\nThey threw a welcome party and the teaching techniques here are very understandable.\n\nTenu Evans\n\nInternational Foundation Programme\n\nThe foundation programme really helped me with my English and other academic aspects such as referencing and summarising. I've learnt to use words that I wouldn't normally use.\n\nYou do get more comfortable with the English language and the foundation programme does help.\n\nSoad Lajud\n\nInternational Foundation Programme - Art, Design and Media"
