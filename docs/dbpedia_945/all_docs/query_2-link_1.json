        "text": "Our innovative and unique MA Publishing masters course has been designed in collaboration with and will be delivered alongside one of the world's largest publishing houses, Hachette UK, and reading and writing development organisation, New Writing North.\n\nThis Publishing masters course is the first in the UK to offer students a guaranteed placement with a global publisher and the opportunity to work with New Writing North on live writing development projects.\n\nDesigned to address skills gaps within the publishing industry, our MA Publishing will give you the opportunity to explore all elements of the trade publishing landscape and benefit from cutting-edge industry-inspired learning.\n\nModules you will study on this Publishing masters include, Introduction to Publishing, Manuscript to Market, People in Publishing, Publishing Placement and Major Publishing Project.\n\nYou will gain insight into 21st century publishing, and the wide range of roles available in the industry. You will also explore the various stages of publishing, from initial ideas and commissioning to cover design, book launches and sales data analysis. You will develop your understanding of the ecology of writing in the UK through learning about the role of writing development in publishing and strategies for identifying and developing talent.\n\nYou will develop professional publishing practice through the year-long Publishing Placement and Major Publishing Project modules. These modules will help you develop the skills and knowledge you will need for a career in publishing, as well as allow you to graduate with a portfolio to show potential employers and engage in your own independent research project.\n\nGraduates of the MA Publishing will gain a thorough academic grounding in the principles and practices of publishing today, as well as the vocational and practical skills to prepare them for success in a range of publishing-related roles.\n\nPlease note there is £2,000 scholarship available for one successful student, during their one year degree. For more information click here\n\nThis module will provide you with a comprehensive knowledge of the history of publishing from the eighteenth century to the present day. Focusing on the social and cultural, as well as the economic and political, influences and impacts of the industry across time, the module will take in a range of histories from the UK and globally to chart the development of the contemporary publishing industry and consider its role in shaping the world today. The module will situate discussions in historical context before moving into contemporary considerations and changes to publishing practices since the year 2000. Concentrating on the history of publishing as one of evolution rather than revolution, it will map the manifestation of technology and new market channels. Through strategic considerations of disruptions to the industry over time, it will explore market dynamics across global territories, copy right and international variations in publishing law as well as the impact of globalisation and political events like Brexit to supply chain and manufacture. Sustainability, net zero and the carbon footprint of the industry will be examined in relation to the production of publishing products, while contemporary roles in publishing will be considered through case studies of the various roles in the industry, the skillsets required to execute them and how these roles relate to one another both within and between publishing houses in the UK and globally.\n\nMore information\n\nThis year-long module is designed to map onto the ‘Publishing Placement’ module and will provide you with instruction and knowledge that you can put into practice on your placement activities. Both modules are designed to reflect the movement of the book across the various stages of publication within a contemporary publishing business. The module captures each stage of production and how these relate to one another to produce a final product for the market place. The module will offer you new knowledge, understanding and insights into a variety of areas of publishing including:\n\n• Commissioning, Acquisition and Editorial\n\n• Legal and Contracts, Risk, Insight, Research, intelligence\n\n• Financial and Business Trends and Models\n\n• Editorial\n\n• Production\n\n• Sales, Marketing & Publicity\n\n• Design\n\n• Retail\n\n• Post-Production\n\nReflecting on the experience of the author in the publishing process, as well as the influence of external markets and buyers, the module will equip you with the skills and experiences necessary to build support for your projects and pitch effectively to potential clients and end users. Through instruction in the business of publishing - including areas such as rights, sales, branding, copyright and IP, libel, reputation management, customer profiling and market segmentation, digital and strategic marketing - you will develop the skills required to operate in a contemporary publishing organisation across a variety of roles. Through engagements with the publishing production process you will be encouraged to consider the logistics of type setting, layout, production schedules, supply chains and exports. As well as considering the importance of editorial and marketing, you will also examine the after-life of books once they enter the market place with a focus on front and back lists, and the emerging significance of adaptation and series sales and licencing for the sector in the contemporary period.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Major Publishing Project provides you with the opportunity to produce an extended piece of work on a topic of your choice that engages with some aspect of contemporary Publishing Studies. Indicative topics may include but are not limited to publishing history, publishing markets, case studies of publishing initiatives and organisations and EDI interventions. Topics will be agreed in negotiation and with guidance from your module tutor. In this double-weighted module you will operate at a higher level of independent learning and research than in the taught modules. You will be taught key research skills in structured workshops taught as a development phase, and then engage in a more independent delivery phase working with a supervisor to lead your own project.\n\nIn this module you will learn how to plan, structure, formulate, negotiate and evaluate a personal project of study in the mode of a substantial project with an accompanying report. Through structured workshops and individual supervisions you will learn how to manage, execute and complete a research project in Publishing Studies that critically evaluates appropriate theories and concepts and demonstrates understanding and knowledge of your chosen area of research. By putting into practice the publishing methodologies and independent learning skills you have developed on your programme modules, you will use personal reflection to communicate and evaluate research outcomes and your own learning journey.\n\nMore information\n\nThis module will analyse publishing structures and practices and explore how forces both inside and outside publishing are impacting on the ways in which the industry approaches inclusivity, diversity and representation. The module will focus on people working with the industry and in organisations that connect closely to it, as well as deepening students’ awareness of the lives and careers of authors.\n\nYou will learn about the law and policy contexts of inclusivity, diversity and representation for people with protected characteristics and those from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the creative industries. Teaching will examine inclusivity policies and practices, business strategy and audience development. You will explore the history, current balance and cultural context of representation within the creative industries and publishing and writing in particular by drawing on recent published work, reports, articles and interviews with writers, publishers and activists. You will examine the concept of free speech and freedom of expression as they impact within the publishing context drawing on both an understanding of the law and presentations from relevant organisations working to uphold freedom of expression in the UK and internationally. Thinking about representation through a wider lens you will consider how translation and international partnerships contribute to widening dialogue and representation and consider the unique place they occupy in the publishing landscape. Module sessions will explore free speech, the ethics of publishing, literature sector bodies, prize culture, festivals and international events.\n\nMore information\n\nThis year-long module, comprising the virtual work placement plus scheduled class sessions, will give you first-hand insight into the organisation and activities of one of the world’s most eminent publishers, Hachette, as well as the leading national writing development agency New Writing North. The module will enhance your knowledge of how the publishing and literary industry operates, and your ability to critically analyse its structures and processes. You will observe the principles of organisational management and develop an appreciation of how the governance, structures and systems of the business are influenced by values, motivations, practices and working cultures on the ground. To meet the requirements of the module you will be required to participate in a minimum 60 hours of placement activity supervised by Hachette, with opportunities for additional professional activities and hours according to circumstances.. These hours can be accrued working physically, digitally and/or a blended approach to reflect the delivery models of the placement partners and the future ways of working in the publishing industry.\n\nYour placement roles will provide you with a wide-ranging overview of how different parts of the publishing and literary industry operate, as well as a sense of different organisational management structures. The module’s learning will map onto your learning in the ‘Manuscript to Market’ module so as to apprise you of essential employability-oriented skills: teamwork, self-presentation, research into employment, enterprise opportunities, self-awareness and negotiation skills. You will work with Hachette and/or NWN staff under the supervision of an assigned ‘key contact’ mentor. This will enhance your learning and skills as you gain insight into a variety of roles and contexts in a contemporary organisation. This experience is intended to develop new knowledge about the working environment of the business, enhance sensitivity to different working environments and contexts and develop a global outlook in communication and graduate skills. Through a placement log, you will develop a reflective approach to your experiences and deploy verbal, written and visual methods of communication to capture your reflective practice.\n\nMore information\n\nAcademic skills when studying away from your home country can differ due to cultural and language differences in teaching and assessment practices. This module is designed to support your transition in the use and practice of technical language and subject specific skills around assessments and teaching provision in your chosen subject. The overall aim of this module is to develop your abilities to read and study effectively for academic purposes; to develop your skills in analysing and using source material in seminars and academic writing and to develop your use and application of language and communications skills to a higher level.\n\nThe topics you will cover on the module include:\n\n• Understanding assignment briefs and exam questions.\n\n• Developing academic writing skills, including citation, paraphrasing, and summarising.\n\n• Practising ‘critical reading’ and ‘critical writing’\n\n• Planning and structuring academic assignments (e.g. essays, reports and presentations).\n\n• Avoiding academic misconduct and gaining credit by using academic sources and referencing effectively.\n\n• Listening skills for lectures.\n\n• Speaking in seminar presentations.\n\n• Presenting your ideas\n\n• Giving discipline-related academic presentations, experiencing peer observation, and receiving formative feedback.\n\n• Effective reading techniques.\n\n• Developing self-reflection skills.\n\n• Discussing ethical issues in research, and analysing results.\n\n• Describing bias and limitations of research.\n\nMore information\n\nThis module will provide you with a comprehensive knowledge of the history of publishing from the eighteenth century to the present day.
