        "text": "Editorial\n\nTHE EDITOR’S RESIGNATION SPEECH\n\nAugust 8, 1974\n\nGood evening.\n\nThis is the fifth time I have spoken to you from this Editorial office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this publication. Each time I have done so to discuss with you some matter that I believed affected the interest of BAAS.\n\nIn all the decisions I have made in my editorial life, I have always tried to do what was best for ASIB and for BAAS. Throughout long and difficult periods choosing cover images or wrangling with printers, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which I was appointed.\n\nIn the past few months, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough base to justify continuing that effort. I now believe that my purpose as Editor of American Studies in Britain has been served, and there is no longer a need for my tenure to be prolonged.\n\nI would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interests of BAAS must always come before any personal considerations.\n\nFrom the discussions I have had with the Executive Committee and other departmental leaders, I have concluded that I might not have the resources that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of BAAS would require.\n\nI have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as Editor, I must put the interest of ASIB first. ASIB needs a full time Editor – particularly at this time with problems we face with at home and abroad.\n\nTherefore, I shall resign the Editorship effective at noon tomorrow. Dr Alison Kelly (alison.kelly@rai.ox.ac.uk) of the Rothermere Institute will be sworn in as Editor at that hour in this office.\n\nAs I recall the high hopes for ASIB with which we began this term, I feel a great sadness that I will not be here in this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in the coming years. But in turning over direction of ASIB to Dr Kelly, I know that the leadership of ASIB will be in good hands.\n\nIn passing this office to Dr Kelly, I also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on her shoulders tomorrow, and, therefore, of the understanding, the patience, the cooperation, she will need from all BAAS members.\n\nAs she assumes that responsibility, she will deserve the help and the support of all of us. As we look to the future, the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of our discipline, to put the bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us, and to rediscover those shared ideals that lie at the heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free Association.\n\nSo, let us all now join together in affirming that common commitment and in helping our new Editor succeed for the benefit of all BAAS members.\n\nI shall leave this office with regret at not being able to continue, but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your Editor for the past two and a half years. These years have been a momentous time in the history of BAAS. They have been a time of achievement of which we can all be proud, achievements that represent the shared efforts of the members.\n\nBut the challenges ahead are equally great, and they, too, will require the support and the efforts of BAAS and the people working in cooperation with the newly elected Executive Committee.\n\nFor more than seven years in academic life I have shared in the history of this Association. I have fought for what I believed in. I have tried to the best of my ability to discharge those duties and meet those responsibilities that were entrusted to me.\n\nSometimes I have succeeded and perhaps sometimes I have failed, but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, ‘whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy causer, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly.’\n\nI pledge you here tonight that as long as I have a breath of life left in my body. I shall continue in that spirit. I shall continue to work for the great cause of BAAS to which I have been dedicated throughout my years as a postgraduate representative, Editor of US Online, Executive member, Editor of ASIB, and now as Secretary.\n\nTo have served in this office is to have felt a very personal sense of kinship with each and every ASIB reader. In leaving it, I do so with a fond farewell and gratitude to all who have contributed to the success of this newsletter.\n\nNOTE: The Editor spoke at 9.01 p.m. in the ASIB Office.\n\nThe address was broadcast live on radio and television, but nobody was listening.\n\nCatherine Morley\n\nDepartment of English\n\nOxford Brookes University\n\nGipsy Lane Campus\n\nOxford, OX3 0BP\n\nE-mail: catherinemorley@brookes.ac.uk\n\nBAAS Annual Conference: University of Edinburgh 2008\n\nThe 53rd Annual Conference\n\nCall for Papers\n\nThere is no overarching theme for the conference, which is a forum for research papers on any subject relating to the United States of America and to early America. Paper and panel proposals on any topic within American Studies, broadly defined, are welcome. The conference will feature papers across a wide range of disciplines, including history, literary studies, political science, cultural studies, film and media studies, and visual culture and art history, among others.\n\nEdinburgh is among the finest cities in Europe. Its Old Town and New Town are World Heritage Sites, and its cultural and historical riches include the castle, museums, and five galleries. The city’s physical setting is notable for its beauty. An example of this beauty is the conference’s location, which is next to Arthur’s Seat and Holyrood Park. For further information about Edinburgh, please see www.ed.ac.uk/explore/city\n\nProposals for 20-minute papers should be a maximum of 250 words and should include a provisional title. These will be arranged into panel groups. We also invite proposals for panels and roundtable discussions, involving two or more people and sharing a common theme. The conference will include papers from people across the spectrum of the research community, from postgraduates to senior scholars.\n\nProposals for BAAS 2008 at the University of Edinburgh should be submitted by 15 October 2007 at the latest, preferably by e-mail attachment to: baas2008@ed.ac.uk\n\nDr Robert Mason\n\nBAAS Conference Secretary\n\nSchool of History and Classics\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n50 George Square\n\nEdinburgh EH8 9JY\n\nTel: +44 (0) 131-650 3770\n\nFax: +44 (0) 131-650 3784\n\nBAAS Annual Conference: University of Leicester, 2007\n\nChair’s Report\n\nAnnual General Meeting, held at the BAAS annual conference, University of Leicester, Friday 20th April 2007\n\nAs we approach the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, I am glad to be able to report that the research culture of the UK’s American Studies subject community is in a very healthy state. American Studies experts continue to secure a whole range of awards, fellowships and prizes, are selected to serve on AHRC peer review panels, and are promoted within their home universities. Over the past year Jude Davies has been promoted to a Readership in American Studies at the University of Winchester; Kevern Verney, has been appointed to a chair in American History at Edge Hill University; Peter Rawlings has been appointed to a chair in American Literature at the University of the West of England; John Howard has been appointed to a chair in American Studies at King’s College London; Trevor Burnard has been appointed to a Chair in American History at the University of Warwick; Susan-Mary Grant has been appointed to a Chair in American History at the University of Newcastle; Heidi Macpherson has been appointed the Dean of Humanities at De Montfort University; and Janet Beer has been appointed Vice-Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University.\n\nThe officers and members of the Executive Committee of BAAS continue to work extremely hard to protect and enhance American Studies in the UK. We spend an ever-increasing amount of time attending meetings, responding to consultation documents, and ensuring that the voice of American Studies is heard as universities, funding bodies and the government make their decisions. To give you a sense of these kinds of activities, I can report that over the past year BAAS committee members have, on your behalf, attended AHRC consultations on reform of postgraduate funding; written formal responses to these proposals; participated in a special meeting on American Studies at the AHRC headquarters in Bristol; responded to the AHRC consultation on its strategic plan; responded to the QAA on its new benchmark statements for English, History, and Politics; responded to the Department for Education and Skills consultation document on reform of research assessment; responded to an ESRC consultation on their 3+1 postgraduate funding scheme; responded to the RCUK consultation on academic peer review; responded to HEFCE on its review of funding for the Institute for the Study of the America; attended a variety of other HEFCE, AHRC, British Academy, and Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences events; worked on an American Studies alumni questionnaire in order to furnish information for the American Studies recruitment CD-ROM currently under development; developed new prizes and fellowships for the American Studies community, and attended inaugural lectures, social events and so forth in order to represent the American Studies subject community.\n\nAs a subject community, American Studies continues to have a louder, and certainly a more persistent voice than our size might appear to warrant. That is because of the tremendous amount of work undertaken by the officers, the executive committee members and the sub-committee members. While much of this work is not as high profile as various other BAAS activities, it is essential. Our loud voice enables us to have as much input as possible, and to ensure that the concerns of American Studies are well represented.\n\nMoreover, such activities represent a growing part of the work of BAAS officers and committee members, not just because of the increasingly bureaucratic nature of academic life, but also because the public profile of American Studies is of a subject under threat and in decline. News reports in the Times Higher Education Supplement and the Education supplement of the Guardian have indicated a significant decline in undergraduate student enrolments; American Studies departments and programmes are under threat as universities reorganize administration and undergraduate teaching; the number of American Studies Units of Assessment that will be submitted for RAE 2008 is likely to be lower than 2001; the number of prospective PhD students receiving AHRC funding has declined, and so forth.\n\nWhat I have found most frustrating over the past three years has been the dissonance between these trends and my direct and first hand experience of the healthy and in many ways very successful teaching and research culture of American Studies in the UK. Even in places where departments have been closed, the courses that constituted American Studies usually remain popular, albeit now under the rubric of other departments. Research and publication remains of the very highest quality, with members of the UK American Studies community winning the Abraham Lincoln Prize, being short-listed for the Pulitzer Prize, and winning the last two biennial European American Studies Network book prizes. And more than anything else, the work presented at and the conversations occurring within this conference illustrate the health of the disciplines. American Studies remains strong, but a great deal of work is required to ensure that this is recognized.\n\nI would like to thank the officers, members and associates of the BAAS Executive Committee, including Susan Castillo, Richard Crockatt, Jude Davies, Martin Halliwell, Will Kaufman, Hannah Lowe, Sarah MacLachlan, Catherine Morley, Ken Morgan, Ian Ralston, Theresa Saxon, Ian Scott, Jenel Virden, Michelle Smith, and most especially Heidi Macpherson, Graham Thompson and Carol Smith. I am also very grateful to Phil Davies and to Judie Newman for their wise counsel, and to Ambassador Robert Tuttle, Sue Wedlake, Michael Macey and Sarah-Jane Mayhew at the Embassy of the United States, for their support of American Studies in Britain.\n\nI attended my first BAAS conference at Nottingham as an undergraduate assistant a quarter-century ago: sitting, drinking and chatting in the bar of my undergraduate hall of residence with Malcolm Bradbury and a host of other scholars was less intimidating than it was exciting, and the experience was enhanced when conference secretary Pete Messent prevailed on me to break into the by then closed bar to procure a bottle of single malt so that the conviviality could continue. (I hasten to add that Pete later replaced the bottle). BAAS conferences remain just as engaging and exciting, and are of vital importance to Britain’s American Studies community. They succeed because of a great deal of preparation and hard work, and I am very grateful to George Lewis and his colleagues here at Leicester, for organizing such an excellent conference.\n\nProfessor Simon Newman\n\nMinutes of 2007 BAAS AGM\n\nThe 2007 AGM of BAAS was held on Friday 20 April at the University of Leicester at 4:40pm.\n\nElections:\n\nChair Heidi Macpherson (to 2010)\n\nSecretary Catherine Morley (to 2008)†\n\nCommittee Ian Bell (to 2010)\n\nGeorge Lewis (to 2010)\n\nSarah MacLachlan (to 2010)*\n\nEAAS Rep Philip Davies (to 2012)*\n\n*Not eligible for re-election\n\n†Fulfilling an unexpired term due to a resignation from the office.\n\nThe Treasurer circulated copies of the draft audited accounts, which he asked the AGM to approve. He informed the AGM that the format of the accounts was different this year; the Trustees’ Report, which used to consist of the Chair’s address to the AGM, is now a longer document to take into account the new regulations (the Charities Act of 2006 and The Statement of Recommended Practice, Accounting and Reporting by Charities [SORP] 2005). The purpose of the new format report is to allow the Charity Commission to see what the charity is doing and its plans for the future, and to make sure that it is fulfilling its public benefit requirements. BAAS has no difficulty in fulfilling the charity definition of public benefit given its focus on education. One of the effects of the new reporting requirements is that the accountant’s bill has gone up. GT drew the membership’s attention to particular sections of the Report:\n\nOn p. 11, conference funding appears to be down substantially this year, but this is related to the extra money received the previous year for the 50th Anniversary celebrations.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of new money coming into BAAS for the Eccles Centre fellowships. This is restricted income.\n\nSubscriptions are up by £2700 and membership is up 51; the rise in membership may partly be accounted for by the new ability to pay via PayPal. Since July 2006, BAAS has generated over £1700 from PayPal subscriptions.\n\nBAAS currently holds a surplus of £4515 compared to £2402 in 2005.\n\nGT also reported on membership figures; there are currently 435 fully paid up members, which compares to 384 at this time last year.\n\nDick Ellis proposed that the accounts be approved; George Conyne seconded the motion, and it was carried unanimously.\n\nGT reported on progress made on Gift Aid, which has been an ongoing issue over the last few years. Since 2000, membership subscriptions and donations have been eligible for Gift Aid, and BAAS can claim back 22/78th for those who have signed legitimate Gift Aid declarations. However, the audit trail has been uneven for this and as a result, GT sent out letters earlier this year with the new template for Gift Aid declarations. On the basis of the forms back, he has now submitted a claim to the Inland Revenue for £4466.84 plus interest, which is based on the return of 78 forms. GT estimated that if three quarters of BAAS members to sign the form, we can generate approximately £4500 each year. GT will now work on covering all the back years and will send a further mailshot out later this year. In response to a question from the floor, GT acknowledged that you cannot sign a declaration form if you do not pay income tax.\n\nThe Chair offered a comprehensive verbal report in which he noted that in the run up to the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, the research culture of the UK’s American Studies subject community is in a very healthy state. American Studies experts continue to secure a whole range of awards, fellowships and prizes, are selected to serve on AHRC peer review panels, and are promoted within their home universities.\n\nCongratulations were extended to the following BAAS members in relation to appointments, promotions, and awards.\n\nKevern Verney has been appointed to a chair in American History at Edge Hill University; Peter Rawlings has been appointed to a chair in American Literature at the University of the West of England; John Howard has been appointed to a chair in American Studies at King’s College London; Jude Davies has been promoted to Reader at the University of Winchester; Trevor Burnard has been appointed to a Chair in American History at the University of Warwick; and Susan-Mary Grant has been appointed to a Chair in American History at the University of Newcastle. In addition, Heidi Macpherson has been appointed Professor and Dean of Humanities at De Montfort University; and Janet Beer has been appointed Vice-Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University.\n\nThe Chair noted that the officers and members of the Executive Committee of BAAS continue to work extremely hard to protect and enhance American Studies in the UK, spending an ever-increasing amount of time attending meetings, responding to consultation documents, and ensuring that the voice of American Studies is heard as universities, funding bodies and the government make their decisions. Over the past year, BAAS Committee members have undertaken the following work on behalf of BAAS. They have:\n\nattended AHRC consultations on reform of postgraduate funding and written formal responses to these proposals;\n\nparticipated in a special meeting on American Studies at the AHRC headquarters in Bristol;\n\nresponded to the AHRC consultation on its strategic plan;\n\nresponded to the QAA on its new benchmark statements for English and History (with BAAS member Alex Waddan responding on behalf of BAAS in relation to the Politics benchmark; thanks were extended to him);\n\nresponded to the Department for Education and Skills consultation document on reform of research assessment;\n\nresponded to an ESRC consultation on their 3+1 postgraduate funding scheme;\n\nresponded to the RCUK consultation on academic peer review;\n\nresponded to HEFCE on its review of funding for the Institute for the Study of the America;\n\nattended a variety of other HEFCE, AHRC, British Academy, and Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences events;\n\nworked on an American Studies alumni questionnaire in order to furnish information for the American Studies recruitment CD-ROM currently under development;\n\ndeveloped new prizes and fellowships for the American Studies community;\n\nand attended inaugural lectures and social events in order to represent the American Studies subject community.\n\nThis work, whilst not always high profile, is essential in ensuring that the American Studies voice is heard nationally, particularly at a time when the public profile of American Studies is of a subject under threat. News reports in the Times Higher Education Supplement and the Education supplement of the Guardian have indicated a significant decline in undergraduate student enrolments; American Studies departments and programmes are under threat as universities reorganize administration and undergraduate teaching; and the number of American Studies Units of Assessment that will be submitted for RAE 2008 is likely to be lower than 2001. However, as the Chair reported, there is a dissonance between these trends and his direct and first hand experience of the healthy and in many ways very successful teaching and research culture of American Studies in the UK. Even in places where departments have been closed, the courses that constitute American Studies usually remain popular, albeit now under the rubric of other departments. Research and publications remain at the very highest quality, with members of the UK American Studies community winning the Abraham Lincoln Prize, being short-listed for the Pulitzer Prize, and winning the last two biennial EAAS Network book prizes. And more than anything else, the work presented at and the conversations occurring within this conference illustrated the health of the disciplines. American Studies remains strong, but a great deal of work is required to ensure that this is recognized.\n\nThe Chair concluded by thanking the members of the BAAS Executive Committee, including Susan Castillo, Richard Crockatt, Jude Davies, Martin Halliwell, Will Kaufman, Hannah Lowe, Sarah MacLachlan, Catherine Morley, Ken Morgan, Ian Ralston, Theresa Saxon, Ian Scott, Jenel Virden and the BAAS officers, Heidi Macpherson, Graham Thompson and Carol Smith. Thanks were also extended to Michelle Smith at the University of Manchester for helping to administer the Awards Committee, to the previous chairs, Philip Davies and Judie Newman for their wise counsel, and to Ambassador Robert Tuttle, Sue Wedlake, Michael Macy and Sarah-Jane Mayhew at the Embassy of the United States, for their support of American Studies in Britain. Final thanks were extended to George Lewis and his colleagues at Leicester, for organizing such an excellent conference.\n\nConferences:\n\nSarah MacLachlan began her report by acknowledging what a huge success the Leicester conference had been so far, and offering public congratulations to George Lewis, Martin Halliwell, and their team of postgraduates for the hard work they had put in before and during the conference. SM noted that this year, she had visited the 2008 conference site in Edinburgh with Robert Mason, the 2008 Conference Organizer. The conference will be based in the Pollock Hall area of Edinburgh, 27-30 March. She noted that a call for papers would be distributed shortly, and members were asked to consider submitting proposals early to allow for planning.\n\nThe 2009 conference will be held at the University of Nottingham 16-19 April, organized by Celeste-Marie Bernier. SM reported that negotiations were underway for the 2010 conference and that the successful applicant would be announced shortly. She also announced that the University of Central Lancashire had submitted a bid for the 2011 conference, and that Manchester had expressed interested in hosting the 2012 conference. SM then invited suggestions for future conferences.\n\nFinally, SM noted the Committee had agreed a new subsidized conference rate for retired members for the Edinburgh Conference, in line with the postgraduate fees.\n\nPublications:\n\nCarol Smith began her verbal report by reminding the AGM that minutes of all meetings are published on the website, so that individuals may keep updated about current activities that way. She then reported on some of the highlights of the year in relation to the Publication Subcommittee. In relation to BRRAM, the long awaited release of the Edward Long papers and the Bolton Whitman papers were both released. Ken Morgan continued to negotiate with various sources, in particular the Darien scheme papers from the National Library of Scotland. Future plans included records relating to Liverpool merchants and the slave trade in the Liverpool Record Office. KM is also interested in the recruitment of additional Special Editors. A call was sent out in ASIB and anyone who is interested should contact KM at Brunel.\n\nIn relation to the BAAS EUP series, CS noted that it continued to be a vibrant, well used and well read series; there were currently two forthcoming publications: Hulthsether’s Religion, Culture and Politics in 20 Century North America which will be published May 2007, and for which a US co-publication has already been agreed, and Tillet’s Native American Literature, to be published in November 2007. SN and CS as editors are always happy to discuss ideas and proposals and ask that interested parties approach them directly.\n\nCS noted apologies from the JAS editor, Susan Castillo, who could not attend the conference, and she reported that the main business of the subcommittee this year in relation to JAS was nominating the editor (Prof. Castillo) and associate editor (Prof. Scott Lucas). The latest issue of JAS was the first under their editorial control though due to a misprint, the former editor was listed on the inside cover. The following individuals were appointed to the Board: Prof. Ian Bell, Prof. Sabine Brock and Dr. Marina Moskowitz. Other appointments will be announced shortly. Thanks were extended all those who continue to serve for the benefit of the community and as reviewers, for the future health of the subject.\n\nIn relation to other publications, the latest issue of ASIB was produced earlier in the spring, with the deadline for the autumn issue being 11 August. ASIB had been fortunate to have an excellent editor in Catherine Morley. Elizabeth Boyle continues to refine the process of submission and refereeing for the postgraduate journal, US Studies Online and CS is pleased announce that they are moving to three issues a year with deadlines of April (the postgraduate conference issue), August and December.\n\nBecause of his role as Treasurer, GT had announced that he wanted to step down as webster, and the officers agreed that this was a good time to advertise for a joint webster and mail base co-ordinator. AGM members were asked to note that the position had been advertised on the web with a deadline of 1June 2007. CS formally thanked GT and Clare Elliot for their hard work.\n\nCS noted that this was her last report as Publications subcommittee chair, and she thanked all members of the subcommittee for the work that they did.\n\nDevelopment:\n\nRichard Crockatt was unable to attend the AGM and sent his apologies. A written report was read out on his behalf by the Vice Chair. As announced at the last AGM, the subcommittee structure changed this past year, with the awards business of the old Development subcommittee given to a new Awards Subcommittee, in recognition of the substantial growth in awards business. In relation to the awards that the Development Subcommittee continued to oversee, for conference support, there had been a downturn in applications, with only 2 successful applications this year; these were for the development of the South West American Studies Forum (May 2007) and for the annual postgraduate conference. In the absence of any other requests made during the year, RC plans to establish whether the availability of funds for such purposes is publicized well enough. It is expected that the bid form will be put on the website for easier access.\n\nIn relation to postgraduate business, the postgraduate representative, Josephine Metcalf, had been involved in forging closer links amongst European postgraduates; JM acquired a list of postgraduate representatives in continental European countries and gained permission to display this list on the EAAS website. The November 2006 BAAS postgraduate conference in Nottingham was reported to have been very successful. The venue for the 2007 conference is to be Manchester University. On a less happy note, concern has arisen about the success rate of postgraduate applications to the AHRC and it appears that none from American Studies departments were successful in the 2006 round.\n\nSchools’ Liaison remains an important aspect of the work of the Development subcommittee. A teachers’ lunch was to be held at the conference. In addition, the teachers’ representative, Hannah Lowe, wrote a report, “Issues Affecting the City and Islington Student Recruitment to American Studies Undergraduate Degree Courses”. The findings of the report received wider circulation with the publication of HL’s summary of the report in the first 2007 issue of ASIB. HL was congratulated by the Committee on the high quality and usefulness of the report. There was general agreement that the “widening participation” work between King’s College, London and the City and Islington Sixth Form was a good model for getting the message out about American Studies. In the coming year the subcommittee intends to seek ways of building on the conclusions of HL’s report.\n\nThe Subcommittee was also looking at ways to ensure closer links with the LLAS. One LLAS project was the “Why Study American Studies?” CD project which had funding from the US Embassy. At this point, Sarah Wood (Birmingham) gave a short presentation on the CD roms. She noted that the project coordinators (including Dick Ellis) were grateful to BAAS for their support and contacts, their help in setting up filming opportunities, and for writing short essays for the CD rom. Thanks were also extended to the US Embassy. SW distributed a handout with contact details for anyone who wanted to contribute to the CD. She particularly wished to solicit photographs of the USA; the plan was for the CD to be visually dynamic. The coordinators had identified employability as a key issue and one of the crucial resources used was the BAAS survey of career destinations. Thanks were extended to Will Kaufman for his help in soliciting short introductory essays.\n\nAll the members of the subcommittee were thanked for their contributions during the year.\n\nAwards:\n\nIS began his report by thanking the anonymous judges who contributed to the successful business of the Awards subcommittee. IS noted the new awards of the Wyoming Teaching Assistantship in American Studies and the new Eccles Fellowships. He also reported that SN had visited the US this spring and had set up a number of other exciting opportunities for links between institutions; thanks were offered to him for his efforts. Thanks were also extended to Philip Davies for his backing of the Eccles awards. IS noted that BAAS would distribute 29 awards (not including honorable mentions) for 2007, encompassing awards to A level students and established scholars, worth approximately £29,000 (excluding the Teaching Assistantship award). The US Embassy was thanked for their support, as were individual members of BAAS who donate funds to support the Short Term Travel Awards.\n\nLibraries and Resources:\n\nIR reported that the subcommittee had dealt with three main items over the past year. The first was the new journal, Resources for American Studies, which was for the first time distributed with ASIB in 2006. Thanks were offered to everyone who had helped to make that possible. The feedback on the new journal was highly positive and this publication can now claim to be making an informed and valuable contribution to the study and resourcing of American Studies in the UK. Members were invited to consider how they could make contributions to the journal’s content, with reviews of new resources or details of special collections. Thanks were offered to Matthew Shaw at the British Library for his work as editor (matthew.shaw@bl.ac.uk) and to all those who had contributed to the content or advertising revenue through contacting publishers.\n\nIR reported that the second major business for the subcommittee was the special collections database project. The intention is to collect information on special collections, which will then be set up on the BAAS website. The request, via email shots to BAAS members, to identify special collections or new long-term projects sadly received little response, though the subcommittee is still committed to the project. A decision was taken to establish American Studies in Britain pages on Wikipedia to present an open forum to which members could contribute. There was considerable debate about the proposal, but the subcommittee agreed to proceed on the understanding that it was clear that these pages did not constitute an official BAAS or BLARS site. The pages can be view and be added to at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Studies_in_Britain. BAAS members are encouraged to contribute to these pages in order to make them as fully representative of the work done in American Studies in the UK as possible. IR and Matthew Shaw (who organized the pages) would like to be informed if members add things to the site.\n\nIR reported that the final item of major business for the year was the membership of the subcommittee. At the moment, there are only three academics on the subcommittee. There will be three vacancies at the end of this academic year, including the position of Chair (IR is stepping down after 4 years). In order to maintain closer links between the academic community and the library resourcing community, IR noted that he would like to see these vacancies taken up by academic staff, especially the chair of this subcommittee. Members who wanted to get involved in the subcommittee were asked to contact IR at the conference or afterwards.\n\nThanks were extended to all members of the subcommittee, the US Embassy for support in publishing the journal, and colleagues on the Executive Committee.\n\nEAAS:\n\nJV reported that she had just returned from the EAAS board meeting in Wittenberg on Monday. The current membership of EAAS is 3972 from all the various constituent national associations. She also reported that the new EAAS website is www.eaas.eu. She noted that the major item for the meeting was selecting the workshop proposals and parallel lecture proposals. As Secretary General, JV was in charge of this process. There were 68 workshop proposals and 17 parallel lecture proposals. BAAS members who had successfully applied to chair workshops were Dick Ellis (Birmingham), Theresa Saxon (Central Lancashire), Carol Smith (Winchester), and Jude Davies (Winchester); Robert Lewis (Birmingham) was offered a parallel lecture slot.\n\nJV reported that the Oslo conference organizer visited the board meeting and has already produced a tentative schedule, which includes a Mayor’s reception at the City Hall, followed by a reception the next night at the US Ambassador’s residence, which may be a garden party (weather permitting). On the 3rd night, a sightseeing coach will take delegates around the city, and this will be followed by a cruise banquet. The organizer has been able to negotiate hotel prices of 50-100 euros per night. There are budget airlines which fly to Oslo (i.e. from Stansted for BAAS members). Another option is an overnight ferry from Copenhagen. JV is going to Oslo to visit the venue in January or February 2008. Workshop chairs will shortly send out CFPs. One request is that PowerPoint presentations are kept to a minimum.\n\nJV reported that the next two board meetings have been arranged: the 2008 board meeting will be in Oslo before the conference, and 2009 meeting will be held in Zürich. The next conference venues have been confirmed as well: Dublin in 2010 and Halle in Germany in 2012.\n\nJV noted that the first official issue of the online journal European Journal of American Studies (EJAS) came out recently. It has 6 articles (4 literature/culture articles and 2 history/political science articles). Two more articles are coming on line in the next few weeks. There will be two issues a year. There is an active editorial committee but they are looking for more people who will peer review, since every article is double peer reviewed. For more information, members should look on the EAAS website and contact the journal editors directly.\n\nJV reported that there is one new member of EAAS: Bulgaria. Their association’s acronym is BASA. JV reported that the board is still considering how to organize the EAAS board membership into “clusters” since the board is becoming very large. At present the plan is to ask for voluntary mergers, and this will be revisited next year.\n\nJV noted that the American Studies network book prize is being advertised now. Eligible texts are monographs (not edited collections) that have been published in 2006 or 2007. The author has to be a European-based scholar and a member of EAAS through membership of his or her national association. The deadline is 1 November 2007. Information on where to send books is available on the web.\n\nFinally, JV noted that this was her last report as EAAS representative, but that she would continue to work with EAAS as Secretary General; thus BAAS has 2 voices on the board. Thanks were extended to Committee members and individual BAAS members for their help over the years in ensuring that BAAS had a strong voice in EAAS.\n\nAOB:\n\nThere was no other business.\n\nThe AGM concluded at 5.45pm.\n\nRemembering Graham Clarke (1948-2007)\n\nGraham Clarke, Professor of Photography and Visual Arts at the University of Kent, who took early retirement last September, died on 16 February this year. We hope that many Guardian readers among you will have seen the vivid family-oriented obituary written by his sister, Norma Clarke, in that newspaper’s Other Lives series (Guardian, 1 June 2007). The following brief memoirs record some of his more public achievements.\n\n—At Kent\n\nGraham Clarke came to the University of Kent in 1974 from the University of Essex to teach in what was then the Board of Studies in English & American Literature. Like other appointments in English and History to the university that year, Graham was to contribute both to the teaching and research of his home discipline of English and to the relatively new programme in American Studies, which in the early 1970s was being built upon the combined interest of those teaching the history, literature and politics of the United States, and which by the late 1970s had a full year abroad in the USA for all students. Like many Americanists, Graham was also a Modernist: his teaching took him into many quarters of nineteenth and twentieth century English and American literature. He was, however, above all, a meticulously close reader of poetry and this gift drew praise from many of his students in his early years at Kent. His enthusiasm for American poetry from Dickinson and Whitman to the present, particularly by way of the great American Modernists and the poets of the Black Mountain School, led to the introduction of a graduate course on ‘American Modernism’, which remains one of his many legacies to the Kent syllabus.\n\nGraham was also a colleague with considerable enthusiasm for the inter-disciplinary character of American Studies at Kent, and his interests in art, film, and, latterly, photography were instrumental in the expansion of the American Studies programme to include an Art & Film ‘pathway’ that, in recent years, has attracted some of the best students on the course.. These interests in the visual arts led Graham from the English department into History and Theory of Art, though he retained throughout his connections with American Studies. Graham was made a Professor of Photography and Visual Arts, in part in recognition of the scholarly importance of his book, The Photograph: A Visual and Cultural History (1997) for the Oxford History of Art series.\n\nGraham made a point of supporting and encouraging the work of his colleagues at Kent. One of his earliest works as editor, The American City: Literary and Cultural Perspectives (1988), gathered a preponderance of contributions from Kent colleagues as did The New American Writing (1990). Many of these same colleagues also produced several volumes for two of Helm Information’s series, ‘Critical Assessments’ and ‘Literary Sources and Documents’, for which Graham acted as general editor. Graham also established the Panopticon in the courtyard of Rutherford College at Kent which became an open-air arena for the display of photographic images, some by local photographers, others from further afield, a venue popular with both the general public and members of the university. Nor should it be forgotten that, with financial assistance from the Faculty of Humanities at Kent, Graham was the driving force behind two day schools on The Great Gatsby and The Crucible aimed at local sixth-formers, the lectures for which were collected as pamphlets under the imprint of the wittily-named AmeriKen Press.\n\nHenry Claridge and Julian Hurstfield, University of Kent\n\n—As a Scholar\n\nI worked with Graham on several publications, but I did not know him, as a person, anywhere near as well as I would have liked. I wanted to pay tribute partly because he started his career as an Americanist – though he didn’t come to many BAAS conferences (he just wasn’t a conference-goer) – and partly because his research and writing in visual culture is ultimately an enrichment of the interdisciplinary tradition exemplified by the best work in our field.\n\nGraham’s writing on photography is particularly impressive. The Photograph (1997), manages both to compress a good deal of known material into a readable form and to make some original observations. His introduction to it characterizes the book as more a series of essays than a history, and it does have a circling, probing – even raiding – feel to it that might be associated with the essay as a form, but it is also a coherent history. It is enlivened by an awareness of relevant critical theory, nicely nuanced in expression, and enriched by fresh archival research on certain key figures and topics, such as Alfred Stieglitz (on whom Graham also published his last book, an excellent short study). The most winning feature of The Photograph is the way the basically chronological account of each of photography’s main genres is punctuated and deepened by readings of a range of specific images. The choice of these exemplary texts is both innovative and apt, and Graham’s interpretations live up to the criteria for reading photographs that he himself advances in his initial chapters. He is especially illuminating on the traditions of American photography. It is not surprising that The Photograph was well reviewed and has found many readers both in and beyond the academic world. Similarly, Graham’s editing of a collection of essays on The Portrait in Photography (1992), including a probing contribution of his own, ushered into existence a book that has become a standard reference in the field.\n\nGraham’s work on painting and landscape, although extensive, has perhaps not had quite the same impact, but this is possibly because it has had to jostle for position in a more crowded field. Nevertheless, his 3-volume set of primary historical material on The American Landscape (1993), including his own commentaries, is very valuable, as is the parallel set on The American City: Literary Sources and Documents (1996). Finally, if I may “declare an interest”, so to speak, an essay on American domestic typology he contributed to a collection I co-edited for Cambridge UP, Views of American Landscapes (1989), was truly groundbreaking: I have no doubt that his contribution was a significant factor in CUP’s recent decision to reprint the book. Things connect: in Graham’s final months he was working on a project on the painting of the American National period, and was developing ideas first tested in that essay. He intended to identify the cultural bases for the constituents of an emerging “American eye”. It was entirely typical of him that, despite his deteriorating health, due to alcoholism, he kept writing to the end, and was in the process of applying for grants to visit US archives. I believe that, had he lived, he would once more have produced a lively and provocative book. His death marks a loss not only, obviously, to his loving family and friends, but to learning.\n\nMick Gidley, University of Leeds\n\nBAAS Requests and Notices\n\nBAAS Database of External Examiners\n\nThe Secretary of BAAS, Catherine Morley, holds a list of potential external examiners.

But, from all historical data and possibly even more from contemporary dissensions, it appears that the social and cultural realities of America might well illustrate the possibility for an “E Pluribus Plura” version of the formula. How does the United States negotiate the inner tensions that, because of its constitutive diversity, might threaten its unity? How do traditions (political, artistic, literary…), modes of consensus building (from myth to national icons and patriotic assertions of exceptionalism), the feeling of a wished-for common good counteract potential strife and the tensions of particular interests and particular groups, make up for the aporias of nationhood and communitarian feeling, of ideological consensus and a tradition of dissent? Could it be that there are indeed several “Americas”? Is being an American necessarily being in many ways double? Can the politically unifying, centripetal power of the State, hidden under the neutral Unum, accommodate the centrifugal forces that might generate a societal and cultural “plura” out of the hallowed political and territorial “pluribus”? Do diversities imply, for their survival and development, a “middle ground”, a “mainstream”, a “tradition” – some kind of American norm? Seen in light of the various subdisciplines of our fields, these are some of the questions that might generate the wished-for contributions to this Conference.\n\nDeadlines:\n\nSeptember 1, 2007: Workshop paper proposals (with 150-200 word abstract) to be sent to Workshop Chairs.\n\nSeptember 15, 2007: Deadline for sending the tentative list of speakers and titles of workshop papers to be included in the October 2007 issue of ASE.\n\nDecember 1, 2007: Deadline for submitting FINAL titles of papers and names and addresses of speakers.\n\nJanuary 10, 2008: Deadline for information to be included in the 2008 biennial conference program.\n\nPlease send all information via e-mail to the EAAS Secretary General, Jenel Virden, at virden@eaas.info\n\nNews from Centres\n\nAmerican Studies Resources Centre (JMU) Annual Report 2006-2007\n\nThis academic year has marked the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the American Studies Centre in Liverpool. To celebrate this, the ASRC has not only continued to expand and develop its existing services, but has also held two special events. Details of these are contained in this report. (An article,‘20 years Ago Today’ also published in the 2007 edition of the ASRC’s journal, American Studies Today, regarding twenty years of our work, is copied at the end of this report for your information.)\n\nConferences and celebratory events\n\nOn January 24th 2007 the ASRC’s Annual Schools Conference had as its topic The Depression, Roosevelt and the New Deal. A capacity audience of sixth form and Access students were presented with lectures (at the Conference Centre of the Liverpool Maritime Museum) from Frank Lennon, former Head of American Studies at Liverpool Hope University, on President Hoover and The Depression; Dr. Jenel Virden from the University of Hull, who evaluated the impact of the New Deal and Dr. Niall Palmer of Brunel University, who discussed Roosevelt, Congress and the Supreme Court. This was followed by Dr. Will Kaufman, of the University of Central Lancashire, who assessed the effect of the Depression through the music of Woody Guthrie – also giving a live performance on the guitar, banjo and fiddle of not only Guthrie’s music, but other musicians of the period.\n\nThis conference was followed by the first of the ASRC’s celebratory lectures. Dave Cotterill, Director of the film documentary ‘Cunard Yanks’, accompanied by Billy Harrison and Ritchie Barton (two of the central figures in the film) presented an illustrated lecture on the background to and making of the film, to an audience in the Dean Walters Building of John Moores University. In June, the film received its British premier to a capacity audience at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall. Dealing with the import and absorption of American culture by the young men who worked on Cunard liners on the New York-Liverpool run from the late 1940s to the 1960s, the film specifically considered how music and fashion had helped shape the emerging youth culture of Liverpool.\n\nThe second event involved a repeat performance by Dr.Will Kaufman on the life and work of Woody Guthrie. Entitled Hard Times and Hard Travellin’, Will Kaufman performed to a capacity audience in the Joe H. Makin Theatre of John Moores University. (The number of requests the ASRC received for tickets could have filled the theatre twice over! A full report of this is carried on the ASRC web site at: http://www.americansc.org.uk/Online/Hard%20times.htm)\n\nIt is hoped that Will Kaufman will return for a further performance in the 2007-8 academic year.\n\nASRC Web site (ARNet) and American Study Today magazine\n\nBy Late June 2007 the ASRC web site, ARNet, had received a rolling total of well in excess of twelve million hits. The busiest month this academic year was March, with 74,000 hits. The continued addition of new articles, book reviews and an updating of other online sections by Resources Coordinator Dave Forster and Research Assistant Helen Tamburro, further contributed to the success of this valuable resource. The ASRC journal, American Studies Today was again distributed to schools and colleges involved with the study of American topics in September 2006. The 2007 edition is in its final stages of preparation and will be the biggest since publication began over fifteen years ago.\n\nRequests and student visits to the ASRC\n\nThe level of requests from students, lecturers and others that the ASRC has dealt with this year has remained at the same high levels of previous years. In addition, requests from the media, particularly from independent documentary and film makers, have increased. Ian Ralston was also interviewed by the Press Association and BBC radio following the Virginia Tech. shootings.\n\n2007-2008\n\nNext academic year will see further significant changes. Major building work on extending the ASRC into an adjoining room and completely refurbishing its facilities has already begun. This is in order to permit the housing of the extensive JMU Special Collections Archive. Details of this broad ranging collection of materials will be announced by JMU and the ASRC early in the new semester.\n\nThe Annual Schools Conference, to be held in November 2007, will consider Civil rights, Black Nationalism and the response of the Presidency and the Supreme Court. Details will be posted on the ASRC web site.\n\nIn September Dr. Rodrigo Andres, of the Department of English at the University of Barcelona, will spending a semester attached to the ASRC. Rodrigo is the author of Herman Melville: Poder y Amor entre Hombres (Herman Melville: Power and Love between Men) (Valencia: PUV, 2007) and at present is working on a book on Herman Melville’s letters to Nathaniel Hawthorne, and on an essay about Melville’s sisters. He has also published essays on Charlotte Perkins Gilman, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tillie Olsen, Sena Jeter Naslund, gay studies, queer theory, and new masculinities. He is a member of the research group funded by the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs / Woman’s Institute “Construyendo nuevas masculinidades: la representación de la masculinidad en la literatura y el cine de los Estados Unidos” (Constructing new masculinities: representations of masculinity in American literature and cinema). As well as continuing his own research, Rodrigo will be contributing to the ASRC’s guest lecture programme.\n\nFinally, thanks go all those who helped make this another successful year. Particular thanks go to Resources Coordinator Dave Forster for his work on the ASRC web site and magazine and Research Assistant Helen Tamburro for her invaluable work in coordinating the distribution of review texts, updating of the ASRC web site pages and dealing with the numerous requests for information via email. Thanks for support must also go to the Public Affairs Office of the US Embassy (in particular Sue Wedlake and Michael Macy), the British Association for American Studies (BAAS), the Eccles Centre at the British Library, the speakers at ASRC conferences and lectures, contributors to the web site and magazine and others too numerous to mention.\n\nIan Ralston (ASRC Director)\n\nFirst published in American Studies Today 2007, below is an article looking back on twenty years of the ASRC activities\n\nThe American Studies Centre at Liverpool John Moores University: 20 years of Resourcing American Studies.\n\n2007 marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the American Studies Resources Centre (ASRC). Initially based at Liverpool Community College and backed by support from the US Embassy and BAAS, the ASRC moved in 1997 to the Aldham Robarts Centre of John Moores University and was formally reopened by (then) US Ambassador Philip Lader. (Letters of support for the ASRC came from President Bill Clinton, Senator Barbara Boxer, Representative Sonny Bono and Mayor of Palm Desert, Buford Crites, amongst others.) Looking back over this period a massive change in the nature of the Centre’s work is clearly apparent; a change that reflects the significant shifts that all those involved in resourcing any academic area have faced.\n\nInitially established to support the study of the US in UK schools and colleges, the ASRC quickly expanded its remit to include students and colleagues in the HE sector, as well as establishing an international profile. The nature of the resources held in the late eighties, while covering all aspects of the study of the US (including a large collection of hard copy texts), mainly consisted of tape-slide, tape filmstrip, slide, video, study pack and photographic collections. This was backed up with annual student and teacher conferences. Communication with educational establishments was by letter, phone and the circulation of a newsletter (later to become American Studies Today magazine.) Despite what now seem like archaic systems, the ASRC built up an extensive database of users. Cataloguing was completed with the use of early Apple computers that were more prone in deciding for themselves what should be done rather than the operator’s intentions. It was, however, in the very early nineties, following a visit from an American colleague and USIA advisor, that the ASRC was introduced to the Internet. We remember all too clearly the amazement at the description of what this and something called ‘email’ could achieve. At this point, outside of the developing information technology departments at some universities, few had heard of the Internet. Prior to this our only involvement with technological developments (other than the breakdown prone Apple computers mentioned earlier) had been the ASRC’s work with the sadly ill-fated NERIS (National Educational Information Service) CD-Rom project.\n\nHowever, the ASRC quickly explored the possibility of developing a presence on the ‘net’ and became one of the first organisations in the American Studies field to establish an Internet site and exploit its potential. An early website was set up but without any full understanding of its true potential. Gradually, and as use of the Internet spread, the ASRC developed its web site (the Rothermere Centre later described it as “…the best of the lot…”) to respond to the needs and feedback of users.\n\nThe ‘newness’ of the power of the net was quickly emphasised by a series of events. One article placed on the site (about the abortion issue) by an American academic working in the UK, created such a flood of responses, including threats of violence from around the world, that the writer asked us to pull the article. When we showed the responses the ASRC had received, the academics astonished comment was “…I didn’t realise people outside the UK could access or read this..” Another article, about a small town in the Deep South, not only produced a flood of emails from ‘concerned citizens’ but also became a major news item in that town’s local press. Just prior to this, a new ‘host’ server provided facilities that allowed us to closely monitor the hits the site received, therefore enabling us to plan and focus the range of articles, book reviews and other information offered to a much greater degree. All of these changes and the growing use of the Internet by educational establishments had an impact on the ‘traditional’ resourcing services the ASRC offered. The original AV materials, apart from notable exceptions such as video (and now DVD) were clearly obsolete to some degree or other. The number of ‘written’ requests from schools also almost completely vanished but only to be replaced by a deluge of emails from not just the UK but also internationally. Although many of the subscription databases that HE now enjoys were out of the financial reach of many schools and colleges, the ASRC found itself increasingly guiding schools (as well as colleagues in HE) over other sources of information and research. One additional point worth noting regarding the internet was a side effect of our cyberspace presence; that was an increasing demand for ASRC conferences, increased calls to provide ‘outside’ lectures (particularly to schools) and a greater contact with national and international media organisations. This area has continued to show a steady and increasing growth. Through its own contacts and also those provided by the Cultural Affairs Office of the US Embassy, speakers at ASRC conferences and events have included many notable figures; the poet John Ashberry, the former SDS (Students For a Democratic Society) leader and now writer, Todd Gitlin, the film director Alex Cox, the film critic Roger Ebert and the writers and academics Johnella Butler, John C.Walter and James and Loise Horton. Support from BAAS colleagues (too many to note here!) has also been invaluable in the continued development and presentation of our Schools Conference programme. The ASRC was also involved in the first Straw-Powell exchange programme in 2001 which saw two young British students spending a busy week in the US as guests of Secretary of State Powell. This event received extensive media coverage both in the US and the UK. The ASRC also continued to establish close contacts with colleagues in the US and throughout the world, including the Salzburg Seminar in Austria.\n\nThanks go to BAAS, Sue Wedlake at the Public Affairs Office at the US Embassy, all members, past and present, of the ASRC’s UK and US Advisory Panels as well as David Forster (ASRC Resources Coordinator and Web Manager), Helen Tamburro (ASRC Research Assistant), Maire Daley and Louise Hesketh for their invaluable support over the years.\n\nWhat the next twenty years will hold, well, it’s impossible to say but it’s clear that the ‘digital revolution’ will continue to change not only the work of the ASRC, but all those involved in the study and resourcing of American Studies. It is also the case that as the US remains the major world force in both politics and culture, the ASRC’s work will continue to be of relevance for years to come.\n\nIan Ralston (ASRC Director)\n\nNote: In October 1998 the ASRC’s web site received a total of 2,670 hits. This increased significantly, year on year. In October 2000, 15,417 hits were recorded and in October 2006 the figure was 69,839. The total number of recorded hits from February 1998 (when the ASRC began monitoring its performance on the internet) to January 2007, was close to 11 million.\n\nAmerican Studies at Leicester\n\nThe Centre for American Studies at the University of Leicester celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2007 which coincides with the 50th year since the University’s Royal Charter in 1957. This was a fitting year, then, for the Centre to host the 52nd Annual BAAS Conference in April, attracting 270 international delegates and three excellent keynote speakers: Stephen J. Whitfield (Brandeis), Richard H. King (Nottingham) and Linda K. Kerber (Iowa). In 2007 Leicester also held the American Politics Group Conference (January) and a special event ‘50 Years in Space’ (April) at the National Space Centre Leicester to commemorate a half century since the launch of Sputnik, with keynotes including Christopher Frayling (Royal College of Art), Michael Neufeld (Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum) and Scott Lucas (Birmingham).\n\nLeicester has made a number of new appointments in 2007 to strengthen and develop its teaching and research, particularly in American history and politics. In US politics, Mark Phythian, an expert in international security, has moved from Wolverhampton to Leicester to take up a Chair in Politics, while Adam Quinn whose expertise lies in US foreign and security policy has joined Leicester from Birmingham. In American history James Campbell and Andrew Johnstone both begin tenured posts, developing the Centre’s research in slavery, crime and punishment, and US internationalism. The recent appointment of Caroline Dodds from Cambridge, who works on Aztec culture, broadens the scope of American research to include South America. Within the Centre for American Studies, George Lewis has recently been promoted to Reader in American History and Alex Waddan to Senior Lecturer in US Politics.\n\nRecent publications from American Studies staff at Leicester include James Campbell, Slavery on Trial (Florida); George Lewis, Massive Resistance: The White Response to the Civil Rights Movement (Hodder); Sarah Graham, Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye (Continuum); Martin Halliwell, American Culture in the 1950s (Edinburgh); Mark Phythian and Peter Gill, Intelligence in an Insecure World (Polity).\n\nFurther details about American Studies at Leicester can be obtained from: www.le.ac.uk/americanstudies\n\nMartin Halliwell\n\nThe Eccles Centre for American Studies @ the British Library\n\nRecent and forthcoming activities:\n\nWho’s Afraid of American Religion? by Alan Wolfe\n\nWednesday 5 September\n\nAlan Wolfe considers the relationship between religion and politics in the US today; the separation of church and state, the implications of a multi-faith society and the manner in which contemporary religions are practiced. Alan Wolfe is Professor of Political Science and Director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College.\n\nEvent time: 18.30-20.00\n\nPrice £6.00 (concessions £4.00)\n\nAn Evening for Jack Kerouac\n\nMonday 17 September\n\nSeptember 2007 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Jack Kerouac’ seminal novel On the Road. This novel, one of the most influential works of American literature, was written down in a sustained burst – and typed on a single, 120ft “scroll” of paper – over just three weeks in a New York City loft in 1951. The manuscript was finally published in 1957, and made Kerouac an icon of the counter-culture.\n\nIn celebration of Kerouac and his most famous book, the British Library presents an evening of readings, music, film, and conversation. The event will feature contributions from Carolyn Cassady, wife of his long-term associate and inspiration, Neal Cassady, and Kerouac’s partner at the time of writing On the Road; David Amram, prominent American composer, musician, and collaborator with Kerouac; as well as guest, speakers, performers and readers including John Ventimiglia from The Sopranos.\n\nTicket-holders are also invited to a special screening at 17:30 of Pull My Daisy, a film created by Robert Frank, with spontaneous narration by Kerouac and music by Amram.\n\nIntroduced by the composer.\n\nEvent time: 18.30-21.00 (plus film screening at 17:30)\n\nPrice £10 (£7.50 concessions)\n\n1,000 Places to see in the USA & Canada by Patricia Schultz\n\nTuesday 18 September\n\nPatricia Schultz’s latest travel volume takes her from her base in New York City to explore destinations throughout North America.

The event gives graduate students working in the area of American Studies and related disciplines a valuable opportunity to present their work, meet other researchers and contribute to the academic dialogue in this growing and dynamic field of scholarship.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that our plenary speaker this year is Prof. Lizabeth Cohen of Harvard University.\n\nFurther details on registration for the conference can be downloaded from\n\nhttp://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/subjectareas/englishamericanstudies/baas2007/\n\nRegistration deadline: 27th October 2007\n\nTravel Award Reports\n\nStella Bolaki, University of Edinburgh\n\nMy visit to the United States in order to present a paper at the 30th anniversary conference of the National Women’s Studies Association (NWSA) proved to be successful in every way I can think of but would not have been possible without the generous travel grant offered to me by the British Association for American Studies.\n\nThe conference was held in St. Charles, 40 miles west of Chicago, Illinois, from June 28 to July 1 2007 and its theme “Past debates, Present Possibilities, Future Feminisms” offered an expansive platform for examining current scholarship, pedagogy and activism in the field of women’s studies. The president and executive director’s welcoming speech promised an even larger and more varied conference this year than in previous ones and this promise was fully kept. The general conference had a variety of formats such as panel and paper sessions, workshops and roundtables. My paper was part of a panel on women writing community in American short story sequences and examined in particular the work of Latina author Sandra Cisneros, who was also the keynote speaker of the conference. Therefore, the highlights of the conference for me were Cisneros’s inspiring speech and a tribute panel on This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa), intended to honour past scholarship that has set new directions for the field. As my research has focused on novels of development by women of colour, I found these two sessions moving and intellectually engaging.\n\nThe different formats of the main conference and the diverse range of sessions provided a healthy variety and a balanced focus on topics like theory, teaching and activism in the field of American and women’s studies though I have to admit that it was difficult to choose from 360 sessions as most of them were running concurrently. There were, however, some larger all-conference sessions that I attended which were particularly helpful. “Engaging scholarships” was a series of sessions intended to address the conference theme and sub-themes, and “presidential sessions” highlighted emerging trends in feminist theory or revisited central questions that have long shaped the field. For the first, I attended a session on im/migration and mobility featuring Dr. Laila Farah, a Lebanese-American feminist performer-scholar who performed and discussed her production “Living in the Hyphen-Nation”. As my research addresses themes like ethnic and postcolonial identities, displacement, and mobility, this was more than useful. For the second, I attended a workshop on Latina immigrants, which contributed to a clearer understanding of the immigrant experience in the United States.\n\nA panel on the future of women’s studies programs by young faculty shed light on issues like interdisciplinarity and intersectionality and provided some very interesting ideas for pedagogical approaches to multiculturalism and feminist studies. A series of videos and films on adolescent girls, disabled women and older women (Girl House Art Project, Beyond Disability: The Fe Fe Stories, and Look Us in the Eye: The Old Women’s Project) provided insights on the various stages of life and experiences of marginality and empowerment, relevant to my doctoral research on life writing and female development in American fiction, and the exhibit “Visceral Mappings: Transdiasporic Art Practices” hosted by the conference, which brought together artists of African, Jewish, Native, Chicana, Italian, Egyptian, Taiwanese, Indonesian, Indian, Greek, and Korean diasporic origins, linked diaspora with the body and with the domestic space of the house; intersections which I am currently exploring. My research also benefited from personal discussions with people who had posters in the exhibit area on themes related to coming of age in the twentieth century. Posters combined graphic and text and presenters were interacting on a one-to-one basis with the attendees viewing the poster. I should not forget the creative writing series which I attended and which counterbalanced nicely some of the more heavily theoretical papers.\n\nThis year’s NWSA conference had for the first time individual mentoring sessions for those seeking career advice, especially useful for people like me who have recently completed their dissertation, as well as a student pre-conference geared to the needs of postgraduate students and new faculty. There were also scheduled meetings for networking with other international members and groups with similar research interests. The feedback from these sessions was more than generous.\n\nOther than the paper and professional sessions, the conference featured a wide range of activities such as a brilliant performance of Aqua Moon’s choreopoems (Aqua Moon is a writing, performance and artistic team that tries to bridge the gaps between the streets, hip-hop feminism, performance, activism and academia), a half-hour performance of the critically acclaimed play Jane: Abortion and the Underground by the 20 Percent Theatre Company about an underground abortion service that operated in Chicago from 1969 to 1973, a reception, and a dance.\n\nThough the conference venue was outside Chicago and the schedule was tight, I had the chance to see a bit of the centre of the city. Other than the Art Institute of Chicago, famous for its Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, I got the chance to visit the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum showcasing works from both Mexico and Mexican-American communities. I was also fortunate to arrive there during the “Taste of Chicago”, a two-week festival that takes place in Grant Park, where visitors can get a taste of Chicago’s signature foods and listen to jazz and blues.\n\nPresenting my work at the conference helped me consolidate ideas as well as generate new ones for future projects so I recommend NWSA and its activities to people with interests in the field of women’s studies and with a focus on largely American topics. This trip, however brief, allowed me to become familiar with the organisation’s events, and to meet many new people with similar interests, thus expanding networking and professional possibilities. I am positive that I will come back to future conferences and I look forward to getting more involved. I would like to thank the presenters and the people who offered advice and feedback and acknowledge the support of my supervisor Andy Taylor with my application to BAAS. Of course without the generosity of the British Association for American Studies, I would not have been able to realise this trip so I would like to take the opportunity and thank the Association again for their help and overall encouragement.\n\nJacqueline Cahif, University of Glasgow\n\nI wish to thank BAAS for the generous award that enabled me to travel to Philadelphia to conduct research for my doctoral thesis. My work focuses on Philadelphia prostitutes living in the early national period. While early North America was often thought to be the land of plenty, economic suffering was a stark reality, and alongside widespread poverty, prostitution flourished. As a city of mariners and a major port of immigration, prostitutes found a readily available market in Philadelphia’s sailors, foreign visitors and itinerant men. Specifically, the aim of my thesis is to address questions related to the medical aspects of prostitution. The key questions I am addressing are how prostitutes responded to disease, and what medical choices infected women had recourse to within in the medical marketplace, both conventional, by formally trained physicians, and unorthodox, by local quacks.\n\nThe majority of my time in Philadelphia was spent accessing primary sources at the City Archives. This repository holds a wealth of materials, in particular a comprehensive set of records from the city’s almshouse. A large part of my thesis will focus on diseased women who resorted to public welfare within the institutional setting. Philadelphia’s almshouse functioned as both a workhouse and hospital, and was thus the main port of call for those who were destitute or afflicted with venereal infection. These records included Daily Occurrence Dockets, a vast and rich set of entries by the almshouse Guardians of the Poor, which reveal various aspects of the lives of those who entered the workhouse and hospital. The entries from the late eighteenth century are notable for the colourful language used by the Guardians, and thus gave me significant understanding about the attitudes of Philadelphians towards prostitution during the period. The later dockets from the early nineteenth century are less colourful yet more biographical in nature than the earlier ones. I also examined a range of registers, which provided some biographical details about almshouse patients. These allowed me to trace and piece together information about various women from the Daily Occurrence Dockets, which were sparse on biographical details. These records included various receiving ward registers and censuses, and the Weekly Return of Patients in Sick and Surgical Wards. In addition, records such as the Medical Wards Case Books and Syphilis Costs Accounts were informative with regards to how venereal patients were treated for their infection.\n\nThe sheer range of resources from the almshouse at first appears rather daunting, making it hard to know where to start. However, the staff were friendly and helpful on a daily basis, always on hand to pull out more materials for me. This made the process a simple and enjoyable one for me. They also allowed me to use my digital camera, which enabled me to gather as much material as possible.\n\nI also visited the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which holds a vast range of unpublished archival materials. This allowed me to tap into many contextual resources relevant to the lives prostitutes and those women often associated with them. The HSP holds a rich collection of newspapers which span three hundred years. The Public Ledger, Philadelphia’s 19th century penny paper proved to be particularly fruitful in its scope of information on a whole host of issues related to prostitution. This included the frequent reports of the Mayor’s Court proceedings, City Police reports and those on incidents such as child abandonment, infanticide and street altercations amongst the city’s residents. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Gazette and the Gazette of the United States and Evening Advertiser were important advertising spaces for the sellers of medical books and medicines, often for the ‘cure’ of the ‘secret disease’. These spaces were also used by local apothecaries and physicians as well as Philadelphia’s quacks advertising their services.\n\nI also accessed materials related directly to prostitution, such as the records of Philadelphia’s Magdalen Society and the accounts of the Rosine Association. Both illuminated the world of Philadelphia’s reform asylums for ‘fallen women’. Also helpful were poverty records such as those the Northern Dispensary for Medical Relief of the Poor, which include admission lists for those afflicted with venereal diseases\n\nWhile many materials of both archives are fragmentary in nature, taken together they are valuable in illuminating the often shadowy lives of such women. I am confident that I made effective use of the sources, and collected an abundance of information related to my thesis topic. Philadelphia is often referred to as the most historic city in America. In fact, the area downtown known as Olde City is famous for being the most historic square mile in America. Being able to walk around the city additionally allowed me to become more familiar with the spatial dimensions of the areas the women I am studying moved around in. Often, the almshouse records referred to the exact neighbourhood and street these women came from. This has proved invaluable to my primary research, giving me more of a sense of their world and the obstacles they faced. In short, this trip proved successful in facilitating the vital research that will form the foundation of my PhD thesis.\n\nCeri Gorton, University of Nottingham\n\nI was delighted to be awarded the Malcolm Bradbury Award for my research trip to the United States and Mexico this April. I am in the final year of my PhD at the University of Nottingham, and undertaking this trip was essential to the completion of my thesis. My PhD offers a critical literary analysis of the fiction of Barbara Kingsolver and contributes towards new research in the field of American literary studies. It is important to note that to date there are no PhD theses on this critically acclaimed and popular author and my research will fill this gap in literary scholarship.\n\nAs well as the benefits of this trip to my primary research, my participation in the prestigious international American Culture Association / Popular Culture Association and American Comparative Literature Association conferences as a an American Studies scholar highlighted the vibrant range of research currently being undertaken in the UK in this interdisciplinary field. My trip comprised of three phases; delivering a conference paper at the ACA/PCA Conference in Boston, undertaking archival research at The Library of Congress in Washington DC and finally presenting another paper at the ACLA Annual Conference in Puebla, Mexico. I was also invited to chair a panel on Characterising the Celt: Post/Colonial Representations of Identity and Alterity at the ACLA conference in response to my interest in Welsh literature and postcolonialism.\n\nThe financial support I received from BAAS effectively funded the nine days of archival research at the Library of Congress, which was the main focus of my travels. Upon leaving the UK, my first stop was at the Annual ACA and PCA Conference in Boston, where I presented a paper on the Contemporary Southern Literature and Culture panel. My paper was entitled ‘Finding Her Selves: The Familiar Voices and Challenging Words of Barbara Kingsolver’s Southern Women’. More than 1500 delegates attended the conference and over the four days I attended numerous panels and networked with fellow academics in the field of American cultural studies. Presenting my research on Kingsolver to such an interdisciplinary international audience allowed me to test ideas, hone arguments and discuss ideas with experts in my field. My paper, and the amendments effected by the discussions in Boston, will now comprise a major part of the introduction to my PhD thesis. As such, this experience was invaluable to my thesis.\n\nFrom Boston, I took the train to Washington DC, where I spent just over a week exploring the archives of the Newspaper and Periodicals Room at the Library of Congress. This reading room, located in the Madison Building of the library, houses hundreds of articles and publications either on or by Barbara Kingsolver, all of which I am unable to access from the UK. I unearthed interviews with Kingsolver, reviews of her work, and short stories and articles written by her, which are exceptionally useful to my research. Using microfilm machines and the recently digitised computer archives, I collected hundreds of pieces from journals, magazines and newspapers, many of which were in addition to my proposed checklist of articles. These varied from publications with a specialist focus and limited circulation like the Utne Reader, Library Journal, National Catholic Reporter and Audobon Magazine, to the mass circulation of daily newspapers like The Arizona Star and The Boston Globe. I was even able to locate Kingsolver’s first fictional and journalistic publications. The staff at the library were incredibly helpful and I have returned to Nottingham laden with Kingsolver-related publications which I look forward to integrating into my close textual analysis of her fiction as I finalise my thesis.\n\nAfter my time in Washington DC, I attended the Annual Conference of the ACLA in Puebla, near Mexico City, where I had been invited to chair a panel and present a paper on re-imagined postcolonial identities. My paper was entitled ‘The Unbearable Lightness of Being in Patagonia: Re-imagining Welsh Identity and Celtic colonialism in the fiction of Malcolm Pryce.’ This conference was particularly useful in focusing the theoretical frameworks and methodological approach of the longest chapter of my thesis, which focuses on postcolonial literary theory in relation to Kingsolver’s novel The Poisonwood Bible. Academics in the broad field of Comparative Literature proved an ideal audience for discussing the interdisciplinary approach both of my thesis and of Kingsolver’s fiction. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to BAAS for awarding me the funding to spend this month in the United States and Mexico. Both of the prestigious conferences I participated in on my trip have proved to be incredibly useful in terms of developing professional networks, honing my presentation skills and testing my thesis. As such, the trip was intellectually stimulating and provided me with the materials and inspiration essential for the completion of my thesis.\n\nMara Oliva, Institute for the Studies of the Americas\n\nAs one of the fortunate recipients of a BAAS short-term travel grant I was able to spend 3 weeks in the United States in April 2007 conducting archival research for my PhD thesis entitled: “How the American elite press interrelated with the Eisenhower administration foreign policy towards the People’s Republic of China”.\n\nThe mass media’s influence on the foreign policy making process is the subject of controversy between scholars who conceive it as having an agenda-setting function and those who see it as the handmaiden of official policy. I am engaged in a historical case study to throw light on this debate through the examination of the role of selected print media in shaping Eisenhower administration foreign policy towards the People’s Republic of China. The selection of China reflects its importance as a Cold War adversary. When, in 1949, the Nationalist regime was overthrown by the Communists and flew to the island of Taiwan, the “loss of China” became one of the great fault lines in the U.S. politics. The Republican right’s perception both of treason and corruption in high places of the Truman administration, the dangers of the supposedly “Europe first Cold War policy” of eastern internationalists, the war in Indochina, and the recurrent crises over the PRC threats to Taiwan during the Eisenhower administration, made China the focal point of the U.S. containment of Communism in Asia.\n\nMy project has two goals. First of all through a content analysis of four of the leading publications in the fifties: New York Times, New York Herald Tribune, Washington Post and Time magazine, I want to examine how the press portrayed China and U.S.-China news. Secondly, through the analysis of private papers of the media figures connected to my chosen sample of publications and of governments officials, I want to investigate how the print media and government officials interacted. I want to find out if the publishers and the editors influenced the administration agenda with regard to China policy or if, instead, the government used these publications as a propaganda tool to maintain public support. For instance, Henry Luce, owner and publisher of Time and Life magazines was a Republican and a member of the China Lobby, a powerful, political organisation opposed to the recognition of Communist China and its admission to the United Nations. Did his editorial stance become a voice of the administration? Or did he influence the government agenda to promote his ideological beliefs? Because of the Truman administration foreign policy, even Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of the world’s reputedly most objective newspaper, The New York Times, decided to support Eisenhower in the presidential campaign of 1952. Did the New York Times’ endorsement of Eisenhower have any influence in shaping foreign policy issues of concern to its publisher? I think that the significance for archival sources in media and foreign policy studies has barely been explored and that an investigation of the private papers of these media actors and the administration key players can throw light on the interactions and mechanisms that politicians, publishers and editors used to shape the content of these publications to promote their shared or conflicting interests.\n\nMy trip began in Abilene, Kansas, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library. Once one of the most famous names in the West, Abilene was the end of the famous Texas Cattle Trail and western terminus of the railroad in the days of the big overland cattle drives, today this lovely town has a population of 6,500 and agriculture is still the main economic activity. It became home to Dwight D. Eisenhower when his family moved from Texas in 1892. President Eisenhower once said: “the proudest thing I can claim is that I am from Abilene”. My main difficulty in travelling to Abilene was how to get there once landed at Kansas City airport, since the town is right in the heart of Kansas and there is no public transport. I didn’t want to rent a car and I couldn’t afford to hire a taxi, however, I was lucky enough to find a blog on the internet where a couple of students, going to the Eisenhower Presidential Library, were looking for other students or researchers to share a private shuttle service. So after a 2 hours and 30 minutes trip by van, from the airport, through the fossil-laden plains and green prairies of Kansas, I safely arrived in Abilene. I stayed at a charming B&B where I could appreciate the local hospitality and also great local food. I spent most of my week at the presidential library and thanks to the meticulous and invaluable work of the archivists I was able to examine all the President’s and other administration officials’ private documents with regard to the PRC, Taiwan and the press. Eisenhower’s papers revealed details of the relationships that existed between the administration and the press, going through these documents I realised that the administration was actually off-limits for journalists and reporters and it was only dealing with publishers and editors, a fact further confirmed by several oral histories of some relevant journalists of the time. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles’ papers provided the most extensive record of the administration foreign policy towards the PRC and Taiwan, but also some interesting clues on his unhappy relationship with newspapers. Among the other relevant collections I consulted, James Hagerty’s papers, Eisenhower’s press secretary, proved to be disappointing since the collection consisted mainly of published press releases instead of “behind the scenes” information whereas the President’s special assistant’s, CD Jackson, papers illustrated in details the relationship between the administration and Time magazine.\n\nFollowing my time in Abilene, I then moved on to Washington D.C. where I spent another fourteen days, working at the Library of Congress first and at the National Archives in College Park during the last week. After leaving the green prairies of Kansas, it was a bit of shock to get back to the city. However, even though accommodation and food price and the level of pollution and noise were much higher than in the rural Midwest, I was positively impressed by Washington D.C. I had heard many different conflicting opinions on it, but perhaps because I happened to be there during the cherry blossom festival, when they say the city is at its best, I found it a nice, young and very clean place. I stayed at another B&B, which was more expensive and probably less charming than the one in Abilene, but still within walking distance of the Capitol Hill and in a safe neighbourhood. At the Library of Congress I focused on tracking down and examining a number of private document collections belonging to some key media figures of the fifties. By far, the best of these collections was Roy Howard’s one, owner of the Howard-Scripps newspapers chain and friend of Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek. A friendship well documented by the long correspondence between Howard and the Generalissimo and his wife. The Reid family’s private papers, owners and publishers of the New York Herald Tribune, were particularly interesting with regard to the Presidential campaign of 1952, whereas, Harry Luce’ s papers turned out to be quite disappointing, as they consisted mainly of financial papers with no reference to his personal relationship with the President or any administration officials. In the breathtaking main reading room of the Library of Congress I also consulted the journal Editor and Publisher, which is a monthly journal, first published in 1884, covering the North American newspapers industry. It provided me with an interesting insight of the business in the fifties.\n\nI spent the last week of my fieldwork trip at the National Archives in College Park where I was able to consult the Department of State official press conferences, press releases, daily summaries of opinion and most important of all the “background information conferences” the State Department held for reporters.\n\nTo conclude I would like to warmly thank BAAS for allowing me this incredible and stimulating opportunity, my trip to the U.S. was a great experience and as a result I have made considerable progress in my research.\n\nMark Taylor, University of Hull\n\nHaving received the Ruth and Keith Cox Award for 2006, I was able to travel to America in October to pursue my research into the ‘other massacre’ carried out by American troops on March 16, 1968 in the village of Son My in South Vietnam. The objectives of my research are: to explore the ways in which the massacre at My Khe 4 has been investigated; to consider the treatment afforded to the massacre by historians and the media and to establish the relationship between the events at My Khe 4 and the massacre at My Lai 4 which took place on the same day a few kilometres away. Although I have the good fortune to be able to consult a micro-film copy of the Peers Report in the library at the University of Hull, my visit to America afforded me the opportunity to study in much more detail the various investigations into the massacres in Son My and the responses of the US Army and the Nixon administration to what the Army’s investigators had discovered.\n\nI divided my time between the US Army’s Military History Institute at Carlisle in Pennsylvania and the National Archive at College Park. The personal papers of Lt.- General Peers, who conducted the Army’s Inquiry into the cover-up of the massacres in Son My, are stored at Carlisle. The BAAS award enabled me to look at his correspondence with some of the other investigators, the text of some of the speeches he made after the conclusion of the Inquiry and a transcript of a de-briefing interview he gave upon his retir"
