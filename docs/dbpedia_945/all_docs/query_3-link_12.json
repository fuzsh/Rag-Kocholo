        "text": "Do you have a passion and a talent for writing? Do you want to develop your confidence and ability as a writer, do you dream of being published?\n\nThe MA in Creative Writing at Northumbria offers you the opportunity to explore your writing craft at an advanced level. You will gain a solid grounding in the techniques and skills of writing fiction, learn how to critique your own work and experiment with your writing voice.\n\nA combination of core and option modules gives you the chance to develop your critical and analytical thinking. This course builds on your passion for creative writing, enhancing your career prospects as you develop a portfolio that reflects a broad range of genres.\n\nYou will graduate as a critical thinker with skills that will help you make a big difference in your chosen area of work and creative practice.\n\nEmployability, in the form of critical and creative skills, presentation skills and reflective and evaluative abilities, is embedded into your course. You will be able to demonstrate that you are self-motivated, show initiative and personal responsibility, and possess a thirst for independent learning.\n\nDuring your course, you’ll be in constant contact with a range of professionals working in the arts and creative industries, helping you to build up networks and gain relevant experience.\n\nAll modules play a crucial role in developing the advanced skills and attributes necessary for employment, including effective time and workload management, oral and written communication, teamwork and creative analysis of complex problems. The core module, Professional Practice, is designed to give you insights into the world of literary publishing.\n\nYou will graduate with a qualification which may enhance your promotion prospects in professions such as the literary industries, partnerships and agencies, marketing and advertising.\n\nWe have developed close links with organisations such as New Writing North and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle. We are very conscious of developments within regional writing and we aim to help you to understand where your own writing fits into this context as well as the wider literary landscape.\n\nGiven the postgraduate nature of this course the tutors (all published writers themselves) will be looking for signs of the ability to write at a professional level.\n\nMA graduates have achieved notable success and we include Dan Smith, Celia Bryce and Helen Laws among our alumni.\n\nThere are also opportunities for you to advance your studies further with advice in writing PhD and funding applications available. Additionally, our publishing courses provide valuable insights into the world of literary publishing, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to navigate the intricacies of the publishing industry as you refine your craft.\n\nFor hints and tips on compiling your application portfolio, read this helpful article by current student, Nathan.\n\n“Tell all the truth, but tell it slant –“\n\nEmily Dickinson\n\nCreative nonfiction can be defined as writing that employs elements of creative writing to present a factual, true story. It might take the form of prose, poetry, verbatim theatre, or interview. Because it uses artifice and the techniques of fiction but claims nevertheless to tell a true story, it poses questions about what we mean by ‘true’, and invites readers to reflect on their own knowledge and experience and on what is at stake when any story is told. Creative nonfiction has enormous potential to explore emotion, unlock experience and create knowledge; it is also an increasingly popular genre among readers and editors, making it an attractive choice for aspiring writers.\n\nThis practice-based module aims to develop your understanding and practice of creative nonfiction across a range of possible forms. These might include memoir / autobiography, travel writing, science writing, biography, eco/nature writing, personal essay, sports writing or auto-fiction, and others.\n\nReading as writers, you will analyse a broad range of texts by creative nonfiction writers, and investigate and discuss the creative and factual limits and possibilities of creative nonfiction. You will consider the ways in which creative nonfiction is similar to other genres, as well as the specific challenges it poses.\n\nYou will experiment with a range of creative nonfiction forms, workshopping each other’s draft work within the workshop. You will also be encouraged to look for publication opportunities for your work.\n\nMore information\n\n“Tell all the truth, but tell it slant –“\n\nEmily Dickinson\n\nCreative nonfiction can be defined as writing that employs elements of creative writing to present a factual, true story.
