        "text": "In the 2 year programme, you’ll be trained in investigation techniques including interviewing victims, witnesses and suspects. Your day to day work could see you undertaking search warrants, making arrests or pushing a case through the courts. At the end of the scheme you’ll become a qualified detective without having to complete the standard two years of response officer training.\n\nThe training programme will begin with an initial 18-week period of class-room based learning at our Coach Lane campus focusing on areas including law & legislation, understanding police powers, and elements of effective communication. Following this, you’ll work alongside experienced officers as part of a shift in a response team. You’ll have a dedicated tutor to guide you through your first 12-15 weeks, who will help you build your skills and offer practical and pastoral support. You’ll also complete a training module with one of our CID teams and experience life as a detective at TeamNP.\n\nWhat about my wellbeing?\n\nThe role of a police officer is a challenging one, and you could be dealing with many different scenarios and face many challenges on your journey with us. You will of course be given the support you need and there is always someone to seek advice from and to collaborate with. We continue to invest in trained mental health first aiders onsite and other valuable support mechanisms, an employee advice service offering 24/7 access to trained counsellors and a peer-led support programme as well as other holistic approaches to caring for your wellbeing.\n\nBeing a qualified detective opens so many doors to a varied career in policing. Once you’ve completed your two year training, a wealth of opportunities open up to you and you have the option to take up more specialist roles.\n\nThe detective role is varied and includes Major Crime Investigation (Homicide, & Cyber Crime), Intelligence (Priority & Organised Crime and Special Branch) and Safeguarding (Child Abuse/Protection of Vulnerable adults, Rape and Multi Agency Risk Assessment roles).\n\nA career as a detective is dynamic and unpredictable, ensuring that no two days are ever the same, and the continuous professional development opportunities make it an exciting and rewarding career choice.\n\nYou don’t need any previous policing knowledge or experience, and it doesn’t matter if you’ve never previously considered a career in policing. To apply for the GDP programme, you’ll need to be a level 6 or higher (i.e. master’s degree) qualification holder in any subject area, or be a student within the final year (semester/term) of your degree.\n\nIn addition, all candidates regardless of your desired entry route must hold Level 2 qualifications in both English and Maths. For example a GCSE or iGCSE at grade C (level 4) or above, Functional Skills Level 2, Key Skills Level 2 (Communication and / or Literacy) or Adult Numeracy / Literacy Plus\n\nIf you don’t meet the above entry requirements for this entry route, you may still be eligible to become a Police Constable. Explore alternative entry routes.\n\nAs a detective your mantra should be: ‘assume nothing, believe no-one and challenge everything’ – your decisions should be based on evidence. So, you’ll need first-rate attention to detail to maintain an accurate record of the lines of enquiry.\n\nIt’s essential that you can work on your own, take responsibility for an investigation as well as working as part of a bigger team. To thrive in an investigative role you’ll need flexibility, tenacity and the mindset to question ‘why’ something has happened.\n\nIn return, you will be supported with the material to pass the exam, and work in an inclusive and supportive team with access to specialists and advisors throughout the graduate detective scheme."
