        "text": "Communications\n\nOur Communication format is ideally suited to short studies – which can be preliminary in nature – that are of such importance that they require accelerated publication.\n\nCommunications must contain original and highly significant work whose interest to the RSC Sustainability readership and high novelty warrants rapid publication. Authors should supply with their submission a justification of why the work merits urgent publication as a Communication. Referees will be asked to judge the work on these grounds.\n\nCommunications are given high visibility within the journal as they are published at the front of an issue. Communications will not normally exceed the length of five printed journal pages.\n\nFull papers\n\nThese must represent a significant development in the particular field and are judged according to originality, quality of scientific content and contribution to existing knowledge. Although there is no page limit for Full papers, appropriateness of length to content of new science will be taken into consideration.\n\nCritical reviews\n\nThese must be a critical evaluation of the existing state of knowledge on a particular facet of sustainability; however, original work may be included. Simple literature surveys will not be accepted for publication. Potential review writers should contact the editor before embarking on their work.\n\nAll review content should consist of original text and interpretation, avoiding any direct reproduction. If a significant amount of other people's material is to be used, either textual or image-based, permission must be sought by the author in accordance with copyright law and must be made clear in the manuscript.\n\nTutorial reviews\n\nTutorial reviews are a type of review that provides an essential introduction to a particular area of sustainability. The article should have particular appeal to younger researchers and established researchers seeking new fields to explore. Tutorial reviews should not contain unpublished data.\n\nAll review content should consist of original text and interpretation, avoiding any direct reproduction. If a significant amount of other people's material is to be used, either textual or image-based, permission must be sought by the author in accordance with copyright law and must be made clear in the manuscript.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThese may be articles providing a personal view of part of one discipline associated with RSC Sustainability or a philosophical look at a topic of relevance.\n\nComments\n\nComments and Replies are a medium for the discussion and exchange of scientific opinions between authors and readers concerning material published in RSC Sustainability.\n\nFor publication, a Comment should present an alternative analysis of and/or a new insight into the previously published material. Any Reply should further the discussion presented in the original article and the Comment. Comments and Replies that contain any form of personal attack are not suitable for publication.\n\nComments that are acceptable for publication will be forwarded to the authors of the work being discussed, and these authors will be given the opportunity to submit a Reply. The Comment and Reply will both be subject to rigorous peer review in consultation with the journal’s Editorial Board where appropriate. The Comment and Reply will be published together."
