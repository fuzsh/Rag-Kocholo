        "text": "Author Guidelines\n\nSubmit your paper – Submit your paper through Editorial Manager: www.editorialmanager.com/jifs.\n\nUse an institutional e-mail address or ORCID login for your submission account. Papers may be rejected immediately if the journal is not able to verify the identity of the submitting author.\n\nSUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPT\n\nBy submitting my article to this journal, I agree to the Author Copyright Agreement, the IOS Press Ethics Policy, and the IOS Press Privacy Policy.\n\nPublication fee\n\nA publication fee is charged for all articles that are accepted for publication in the Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems. Authors or their funder/employer pay a publication fee of €300 / US$300 for an accepted article. To ensure fair and consistent treatment of authors, no exceptions will be made. After an article is accepted for publication authors will be contacted by the journals' editorial office regarding payment of the publication fee.\n\nJournal Template\n\nPlease prepare your paper using either the LaTeX (recommended) or the Ms Word template. When using the MsWord template and your manuscript contains equations using MsWord's built in Math plugin, please be sure to save the document in the '.docx' format. This will allow for equations to be saved in an editable format. Equations should never be saved as non-editable graphic images of an equation. Please try to limit the size of your paper to 12 pages in the JIFS journal format. Papers over 20 pages in length may be rejected automatically.\n\nArticle Submission\n\nTo submit your paper please go the article submission page. Note that the journal does not accept submissions from authors using nondescript, anonymous, email addresses (yahoo.com, gmail.com, 163.com, rediffmail.com, etc.).\n\nAuthor identifying information\n\nThe name(s) of the author(s) should be given on the title page of the paper under the title. Include the affiliation(s) of the author(s), i.e. institution, (department), city, (state), country. If available, the 16-digit ORCID of the author(s) can also be mentioned in the affiliation(s). A clear indication and an active institutional e-mail address of the corresponding author should also be given. Papers may be rejected automatically if the idenity of the author(s) cannot be verified. Papers without author name(s) and affiliation(s) will be rejected, for more information please see the journals' peer review policy.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nIOS Press has adopted Sage’s Authorship Policy. Please go to: Authorship guidelines | SAGE Publications Ltd for details.\n\nLanguage\n\nManuscripts must be written in English. Authors whose native language is not English are recommended to seek the advice of a native English speaker, if possible, before submitting their manuscripts.\n\nPROOFS AND PRE-PRESS\n\nThe corresponding author will receive a PDF proof and is asked to check this proof carefully (the publisher will execute a cursory check only). Corrections other than printer's errors, however, should be avoided. Costs arising from such corrections will be charged to the authors.\n\nThe corrected proof is published online in the journal’s pre-press module shortly after the proof is created and author corrections are implemented. This is not the final version. As soon as the article is assigned to an issue, the final bibliographic information will be added and the pre-press file will be replaced by the updated, final version. Pre-press articles are fully citable by using their DOI number.\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n\nCopyright of your article\n\nAuthors submitting a manuscript do so on the understanding that they have read and agreed to the terms of the IOS Press Author Copyright Agreement.\n\nArticle sharing\n\nIOS Press adopted Sage’s Article Sharing Policy from 8th of July 2024.\n\nPlease go to: Sage’s Author Archiving and Re-Use Guidelines | SAGE Publications Ltd for details. If your manuscript was submitted prior to 8th of July 2024, please contact editorial@iospress.nl with details of your enquiry.\n\nKudos\n\nAuthors of published articles (non-prepress, final articles) will be contacted by Kudos. Kudos is a service that helps researchers maximize the impact and visibility of their research. It allows authors to enrich their articles with lay metadata, add links to related materials and promote their articles through the Kudos system to a wider public. Authors will receive no more than three emails: one invitation and a maximum of two reminders to register for the service and link the published article to their profile. Using and registering for Kudos remains entirely optional. For more information, please have a look at our authors section.\n\nHOW TO PROMOTE YOUR WORK\n\nWould you like some pointers on how to help your research achieve a wider reach and greater impact? Please consult our Promotional Toolkit for Authors for tips.\n\nPlease visit the IOS Press Authors page for further information.\n\nOpen Access\n\nBy default, articles published in the Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems are available only to institutions and individuals with access rights. However, the journal offers all authors the option to purchase open access publication for their article as part of the IOS Press Open Library. This means that the final published version will be freely available to anyone worldwide, indefinitely, under a Creative Commons license and without the need to purchase access to the article. This is also referred to as “gold” open access.\n\nGold open access pricing\n\nAuthors who choose gold open access publication will be subject to an article publication charge of €1500 / US$1500 for publication under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license or €2150 / US$2150 for publication under the CC BY 4.0 license. Pricing is exclusive of possible taxes. After an article is accepted for publication, the corresponding author will be informed regarding the open access option during the production stages, and will have the opportunity to purchase open access for their article. It could be that the open access fee of an article is waived completely due an institutional agreement IOS Press has with the corresponding authors' institution. Please check the institutional agreements page for details.\n\nGreen open access\n\nAuthors who do not make use of the gold open access option may still make their article freely available using self-archiving, also referred to as green open access. Authors may make their final accepted manuscript available for free download from their personal or institutional website or institutional archive. This model is free for the author.\n\nPeer Review Policy\n\nThe Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems is a peer-reviewed journal. All articles submitted to the journal undergo a single blind peer review process. This means that the identity of the authors is known with the reviewers but the identity of the reviewers is not communicated to the authors. Please visit our reviewer guidelines for further information about how to conduct a review.\n\nAfter automatic plagiarism screening through iThenticate, all submitted manuscripts are subjected to initial appraisal by the Editor-in-Chief and, if found suitable for further consideration, to rigorous peer review by independent, anonymous expert referees. Authors are not allowed to suggest their own reviewers. Reasons to reject a paper in the pre-screening process could for example be because the work does not fall within the aims and scope, the writing is of poor quality, the instructions to authors were not followed or the presented work is not novel.\n\nPapers deemed suitable to be reviewed will be assigned a handling editor. The handling editor will then invite reviewers to comment on the work. Typically decisions are based on three reviews, in some circumstances a minimum of two reviews may be deemed sufficient to make a decision on a paper. The Editor-in-Chief strives to ensure a typical turnaround time of 3 months from submission until first decision.\n\nReviewers are asked to judge a paper on at least:\n\nOriginality, novelty and significance of results\n\nTechnical quality of work\n\nComprehensibility and presentation of the paper\n\nOverall impression\n\nBased on the received reviews the handling editor will propose to the Editor-in-Chief a recommendation:\n\nAccept\n\nMinor revisions required\n\nMajor revisions required\n\nReject\n\nThey mean the following:\n\nAccept: The manuscript is suitable for publication and only requires minor polishing; thus, no further reviews are requested.\n\nMinor revisions required: The authors are required to make moderate changes to their manuscript. The manuscript becomes acceptable for publication if the changes proposed by the reviewers and editors are successfully addressed. The revised manuscript will be examined by the Editor-in-Chief and possibly sent back to all (or a selection of) reviewers for a second round of reviews. Authors are requested to provide a letter to the reviewers detailing the improvements made for the resubmission.\n\nMajor revisions required: The manuscript cannot be accepted for publication in its current form. However, a major revision which addresses all issues raised by the reviewers may be acceptable for publication. The revised manuscript will undergo a full second round of review. Authors are requested to provide a letter to the reviewers detailing the improvements made for the resubmission.\n\nReject: The manuscript is rejected as it is deemed to be out of scope, not relevant, or not meeting the journal’s quality standards in terms of significance, novelty, and/or presentation.\n\nAuthors are notified by the Editor-in-Chief, whose decision is final."
