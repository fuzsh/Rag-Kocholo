        "text": "The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) applies to all international students and researchers (apart from exempt nationalities) who are subject to UK immigration control and are intending to study or research at postgraduate level in certain sensitive subjects.\n\nThe subjects and research areas are those where knowledge could be used in programmes to develop Advanced Conventional Military Technology (ACMT), weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or their means of delivery. Researchers and students in these sensitive subjects must apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate before they can study or start research in the UK.\n\nStudents and researchers who are nationals of EU countries, the European Economic Area (EEA), Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland or the United States of America do not need an ATAS certificate.\n\nResearchers and students of all other nationalities must apply for an ATAS certificate. You must apply if you are undertaking a postgraduate course or research in certain sensitive subjects in the UK. If you are applying to study an undergraduate course with an integrated masters year you may also need ATAS clearance.\n\nfind out if you need an ATAS certificate\n\nread the guidance on how to apply for an ATAS certificate\n\nThe entry clearance officer (ECO) will ask to see your ATAS certificate as part of your application for permission to enter the UK. A caseworker will also need to see your ATAS certificate as part of an application for permission to stay in the UK.\n\nUK immigration law does not allow universities to permit international students or researchers to study or undertake research in an ATAS applicable course until the student or researcher has provided the university or research institute with the correct ATAS certificate.\n\nStudents\n\nIf you’re a new student and need an ATAS certificate, you will need to get this before applying for permission to enter the UK.\n\nWhen you have received your offer from your university you should apply 6 months before your course will start.\n\nAn ATAS certificate is valid for 6 months from the date it is issued, to enable applicants time to apply for their visa.\n\nYou should apply for your ATAS certificate as early as possible from when you have received a conditional offer to study at a UK Higher Education Institution (HEI).\n\nMake sure your ATAS certificate will not expire before you apply for your UK visa.\n\nAlready in the UK on the student route (including Tier 4)\n\nIf you’re already in the UK on a student visa you will need an ATAS certificate for the HEI you are attending, and the course of study, including modules or proposed research. If any of these details change, you should check whether you need an ATAS certificate and apply for a new one as appropriate.\n\nYou should make a note of when your permission to enter into the UK is due to expire, to allow sufficient time to complete your ATAS and permission to stay applications before your current permission expires. We recommend applying at least 4 months before your current permission expires.\n\nAlready in the UK on a non-student visa\n\nIf you have Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK, you do not need an ATAS certificate to study in the UK.\n\nIf you’re in the process of applying for asylum in the UK, you must apply for an ATAS certificate to study in the UK.\n\nAll other time-limited visas need an ATAS certificate if you are studying for an ATAS-relevant qualification in the UK.\n\nStudents and researchers applying to several universities\n\nEach certificate is specific to the course, research area and institution. You should submit an application for each programme of study or research area where ATAS applies.\n\nIf you’re writing your thesis\n\nYou must apply for an ATAS certificate if you are applying solely to write up your thesis and your previous visa required ATAS\n\nStudent visitors\n\nIf you’re a student coming to the UK as a visitor, you will need to obtain an ATAS certificate before starting research in the UK. You do not need to do this before you apply for a UK visa\n\nIf you are starting your course overseas\n\nYou only need to obtain an ATAS certificate for when you plan to be studying in the UK. However be aware that you could be unsuccessful when you apply for an ATAS certificate to come to the UK part of the way through your course.\n\nTransnational courses may be subject to UK Export Control Legislation. Read the guidance on export controls on academic research.\n\nAcademic researchers\n\nIf you’re an academic researcher applying on the Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility, Tier 5 International Agreement, and Government Authorised Exchange routes, you will need to apply for, and be granted, an ATAS certificate before applying for a UK visa or permission to stay. You do not need to have a final employment contract before you apply for an ATAS certificate. Your employer will advise whether you are to be employed under a standard occupational classification (SOC) that requires ATAS.\n\nIf you’re a researcher coming to the UK as a visitor, you need to obtain an ATAS certificate before beginning any relevant research activity in the UK. However you do not need to do so before you apply for a UK visa (where relevant).\n\nIf you need an ATAS certificate as a visitor, you do not have to obtain this before applying for a visa but you should obtain it before travelling to the UK. The HEI/research institute must check the ATAS certificate before allowing the research to start, and if this is not provided you will not be permitted on-site.\n\nIf you are a researcher already in the UK\n\nYou do not need to apply for an ATAS certificate if you:\n\nare already conducting research in the UK\n\nwere a visitor conducting research in the UK before the requirement for ATAS certificates was introduced on 21 May 2021, and you are continuing this research\n\nYou need to apply for an ATAS certificate if you:\n\nare already conducting research in the UK and you apply for a new visa or apply to extend your current visa\n\nwere a visitor conducting research in the UK before the requirement for ATAS certificates was introduced on 21 May 2021 and are returning to the UK to do research\n\nhold an ATAS certificate for a UK course you have undertaken are making a new application for a Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility, Tier 5 International Agreement, or Tier 5 Government Authorised Exchange visa. You need it before you apply for a visa\n\nchange your field of research or change where you conduct your research\n\nResearchers also undertaking a course of study\n\nSkilled Worker, Global Business Mobility, Tier 5 International Agreement, and Tier 5 Government Authorised Exchange visa holders may also undertake a course of study. You need to apply for 1 ATAS certificate but you should include both the research project and study activities in your application.\n\nIf your circumstances change after ATAS certificate is issued\n\nThe ATAS certificate must accurately reflect the HEI/research institute which employs/hosts your research, and the research project, job title and duration. If any of these details change you should check whether you require an ATAS certificate and apply for a new certificate if you need one.\n\nResearchers applying for ATAS can begin their employment or research 2 weeks before, or any time after the start date stated on their certificate.\n\nMake a note of when your permission to enter into the UK is due to expire, and allow sufficient time to complete the ATAS and permission to stay application processes before your current permission expires. We recommend applying at least 4 months before your current permission expires.\n\nConducting research at more than 1 HEI/research institutes\n\nAn ATAS certificate is applicable to one HEI/research institute. If you are conducting research at more than 1 institute, you need to apply for an ATAS certificate for each, which includes information on the research you will undertake at each HEI/research institute.\n\nHow long applications take\n\nStudent and researcher ATAS applications take at least 30 working days (6 full weeks) to process.\n\nTo ensure fairness and consistency we process applications in order of receipt.
