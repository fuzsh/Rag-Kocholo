        "text": "ROBERT CRAWFORD Interviewed by Jiří Flajšar and Pavlína Flajšarová Robert Crawford is a Scottish poet, scholar, and critic. He studied at Glasgow University and Oxford University, where he got his doctorate. Since 1989, he has taught at the University of St Andrews, where he is currently a professor of English. He has published six books of poetry and more than two dozen other books on poetry, literature, history, and culture. His most recent books include Young Eliot (Cape, 2015), a new biography of the famous poet, Testament (Cape, 2014), the latest volume of Crawford’s own poetry, and Bannockburns (Edinburgh University Press, 2014), a major volume of Scottish literary history. The essential part of this interview with Professor Crawford was completed in a bar at Svatý Kopeček near Olomouc on November 20, 2013. Additional questions were posed by email and answered by Crawford during the winter of 2013/14. The interview predates a crucial referendum on Scottish independence, which took place in Scotland on September 18 2014 and did not go the way he favoured. Another major thing has happened since the interview took place—as of 2015, Crawford’s biography of T. S. Eliot, Young Eliot, a project that he talks about here, has been published by Cape (U.K.) and Farrar (U.S.).\n\nThis volume brings together nine interviews with visiting scholars from Europe, the United States, and Canada who lectured at Palacký University in Olomouc as part of the INKULTUS grant project. The interviews were conducted within the period from November 2013 to spring 2015, either by Jiří Flajšar or by Pavlína Flajšarová, or by both. The questions ranged between culture, literature, film, art, history, nationality, identity, sports, regionalism, and many others, reflecting the unique expertise of each interviewee and their professional achievements. Each conversation is introduced with a brief biographical note about the interviewee.\n\nIn the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaigns, writers played a key role in articulating binding myths of Scottishness and visions of Scotland’s future. This dissertation surveys a range of poems written for the referendum—the majority of which are pro-independence—to gauge which myths and narratives of Scottishness were promoted, twisted, or discarded in artistic engagements with the independence debate. It questions which narratives proved salient to pro-independence writers and considers how these historical narratives and statements of identity are contextualised within traditional concepts of Scottishness as well as how they deviate from those concepts. It sketches first how some poets hearkened back to long-standing myths of Scottishness in order to characterise contemporary Scotland as fundamentally egalitarian. It then investigates how some poets fixated on past injustices and aligned Scottishness with the victim position, and concludes with a discussion of those poets who rejected both of these traditional concepts of Scottishness and past-fixation to encourage a fresh start for the nation. Its compare poems with these themes and identifies the roots of these themes in Scottish literature and criticism, as well as weighing their effectiveness as pieces of political propaganda. In sum, the body of pro-independence poetry written for the referendum indicates a Scottish culture simultaneously clinging to traditional concepts of the nation and also keen to reject stereotypes and cultural dependencies in favour of a fresh start.\n\nThis thesis examines the themes of nostalgia, memory, and displacement in the 1990s work of Scottish poets Carol Ann Duffy, Jackie Kay, and Kathleen Jamie. Each of these poets has emigrated from Scotland—Duffy and Kay permanently, Jamie temporarily—and consequently they associate Scotland with the past and childhood and express displacement from a sense of cultural belonging. Their poetry presents Scotland dually, juxtaposing idealized, clichéd memories and traditions with the physical reality of Scotland’s geographical space and material artifacts. They negotiate the double estrangement of female Scottishness, partially due to their shared experience of maturing during the rise of feminism and the movement towards devolution culminating in the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999. Their poems test the capacity of language(s), including English and Scots, to embody the intense experience of both personal and national nostalgias. Duffy, who moved to England in childhood, portrays Scotland—and the notion of “home” itself—as intangible, dreamlike, and lost. Kay’s genrebending, autobiographically-generated work painfully grasps for biological, cultural, and national origins, and emphasizes the Othering power of racism. Jamie’s writing inquires whether Scottish culture should submit to nostalgia and hoard its relics, or cut tethers and dispose of outdated customs, traditions, and objects. Drawing from poetry collections as well as novels, essays, and memoirs, this thesis undertakes a comprehensive analysis of these writers’ meditations on Scotland as “home” and provides a timely study of Scottish cultural identity given the current movement for Scottish national independence."
