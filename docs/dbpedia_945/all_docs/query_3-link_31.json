They were told which night they could watch a movie and were given a plant and told that staff would take care of it (p194). Three weeks later, residents in the responsibility induced group reported significantly greater levels of happiness after the intervention than the comparison group. Nurses reported they were significantly more active, alert and sociable. When they revisited the study 18 months later, Rodin and Langer (1977) found these results were sustained. Moreover, significantly fewer people in the experimental group had died in comparison with the control group.\n\nAt the time of their experiment it was well established that for ‘normal’ subjects (college students and schoolchildren), increased choice and control over even relatively minor aspects of one’s life or activities was associated with reduced anxiety and increased well-being. Langer and Rodin’s (1976: 191) intuition was that increasing choice and control for those living ‘in a virtually decision free environment’, as they put it, could measurably improve well-being. Their landmark study generated a new approach to gerontology. Further research confirmed the importance of ‘control’ over environment for older adults and other populations, including both objective control and a subjective sense of being able to influence outcomes. Moreover (and echoing the approach to independent living endorsed by disabled people’s organizations) studies found enhanced well-being even for people who ‘depended’ on others, provided they exercised choices and their own goals were supported (Mallers et al, 2014). Functional independence was less critical than choice and control over support and outcomes.\n\nLanger and Rodin’s study, and further empirical research in this tradition, concluded that ‘control’ over one’s living arrangements and environment is vital to health and well-being. Conversely, studies of ‘institutionalization’ report harmful consequences of living in what Langer and Rodin called a ‘decision free’ environment. Both Goffman (1961) and Townsend (1962) described institutionalized people sinking into apathy and misery; Townsend termed this ‘depersonalization’ and Goffman ‘mortification of the self’. The finding, across the literature, is that ‘decisions’, ‘responsibility’, ‘choice’ and ‘control’ are fundamental to human flourishing, and that environments that deplete these opportunities are harmful, corroding the self.\n\nWhere a person’s circumstances are extremely constrained, all that may be left are ‘little choices’, but ‘they are choices all the same’ (p287). Hacking’s analysis implies that the ‘mortifying’ effects of institutions result not only from geographical confinement, but confinement within a very limited decision space, where even the most mundane and everyday choices – micro-opportunities for the expression and cultivation of identity – are constrained. Far from being trivial or mundane, the erosion of everyday choices such as when to get up or what to eat betokens dire constraints upon possibilities-for-being and the flourishing of identity and self.\n\nThis belief lies at the heart of post-carceral ideology. As ‘the decision’ became the base unit of freedom, post-carceral laws like the MCA parcel out legal (in)capacity on a ‘decision-specific’ basis. As we saw in Chapter 4, it was not sufficient to simply close the large institutions and relocate their residents, because institution-like phenomena could emerge in the community as well. Decisions became a metric of how ‘institutional’ an environment was, and ‘home’ (or ‘real homes’, ‘ordinary homes’) came to signify decision-rich places where people could live and flourish in ways denied by institutions. In later chapters I will explore how both branches of the law of institutions are increasingly used to secure a larger decision space for social care users, albeit far from the radical clearing of the decision space envisioned in connection with rights to independent living and the CRPD.\n\nBut what kinds of decisions distinguish ‘institutions’ from ‘homes’ in their idealized forms? Who and what determines which decisions are offered or denied? Is it sufficient to offer someone a pot plant, help them rearrange the furniture (or, in the argot of contemporary social care, to ‘personalize’ their bedroom) to call a place a home? I turn to the vast multidisciplinary research literatures on ‘total institutions’ and ‘homes’ to map out their contrasting decision spaces, which are significantly more complex than simplistic accounts of ‘personalization’ imply.\n\nTo organize this unwieldy material I borrow a conceptual framework from socio-legal scholar Lorna Fox O’Mahony1 (Fox, 2002, 2005; Fox O’Mahony, 2006; 2013). Her synthesis of research on the meanings of home identified three core clusters – home as territory, home as a centre for self-identity and home as a social and cultural unit. To these I add a fourth – the aesthetics of ‘homes’ and ‘institutions’ – because this is often used as a legal and cultural shorthand to identify somewhere as ‘homelike’ rather than ‘institutional’. Drawing from Goffman’s (1961) landmark ethnography of total institutions, Asylums, and work in that tradition, I show how for each cluster of characteristics and decisions associated with home, there is an opposing cluster of characteristics and decisions denied or restricted in institutions. In their idealized forms, ‘home’ and ‘institution’ are constructed in these research studies along opposing poles: ‘Being homelike versus being institutional are used in opposition to one another. One cannot define what is homelike without defining what is institutional and vice versa’ (Lundgren, 2000: 112).\n\nThe difficulty is that although ‘homes’ and ‘institutions’ are constructed in opposition to each other, these are not abstract concepts, but inextricably entwined with the subjectivity of those dwelling within these spaces. The realities of caregiving, disability and ‘incapacity’ complicate these polarities. In Chapter 4, I discussed economic and cultural factors that could drive institutionalization by constraining choices over where and with whom a person lives and how they are supported. In this chapter, I consider the problems posed by constrained abilities – factual or legal – to make ‘decisions’. To put it simply, if a person is neither able nor allowed to make the kinds of decisions we associate with ‘home’, their living arrangements start to resemble the characteristics we associate with institutions. This produces liminal and contested spaces of caregiving, where characteristics of ‘home’ and ‘institution’ collide, and we can no longer draw clear or comfortable distinctions between these settings. I describe some examples in the literature of ‘homes’ that display institutional characteristics, and ‘institutions’ where a person has made a home."
