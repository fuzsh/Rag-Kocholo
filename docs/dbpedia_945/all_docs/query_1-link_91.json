        "text": "To increase efficiency and transform its business operations, Northumbria University, one of the UK’s leading Higher Education institutions, has selected Oracle Cloud Fusion Cloud Applications Suite. With Oracle Fusion Applications for finance, HR and post-award research services, the university will be able to streamline business processes and create efficiencies across departments to improve accessibility and the user experience of its 3,000 staff.\n\nAs one of the largest teaching and research Universities in North East England, Northumbria needed to replace aging back office systems to eliminate paper-based processes, lower costs, and improve access to remote services. Northumbria selected Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), and is working with Oracle Consulting to implement the applications.\n\n“Now more than ever, universities need to be agile and adapt to market changes that are outside of our control. As a challenger institution, we are constantly transforming to provide a world-class experience for our students and ensuring our back office systems are well-equipped is a fundamental part,” said Simon Newitt, Chief Finance Officer at Northumbria University. “Oracle Fusion Applications Suite will allow us to make key decisions with confidence, providing us with an integrated platform to manage our business and better focus on building our global reputation for academic excellence.”\n\nJane Embley, Director of Human Resources and Organisational Development, said “I’m delighted to be part of this project as we transition to a modern, cloud-based solution. Our staff are intrinsic to the success of the University and enabling them with intuitive applications that make their day to day working practices more rewarding is key to our continued success.”\n\nWith Oracle Cloud ERP, and Oracle Cloud HCM, Northumbria will be able to take advantage of the cloud to standardise processes and manage financial, research and workforce data on a single integrated cloud platform. Oracle Fusion Applications’ common and intuitive interface enables rapid user adoption, delivers enhanced employee experience and improves productivity. In addition, Oracle’s quarterly update cycle gives customers access to continuous innovation as new features are added every 90 days, with no downtime or business disruption.\n\n“Technology continues to play a huge supporting role as higher education organisations rapidly adapt to recent challenges and industry disruption,” said Guy Armstrong, senior vice president of applications, Oracle UK and Ireland. “Moving core business processes to the cloud will help Northumbria University improve remote accessibility and user experience and create organisation-wide efficiencies to further enhance learning experiences for its students.”\n\nIn choosing Oracle Fusion Applications and Oracle Consulting to implement, Northumbria University is also joining a rapidly growing customer base of education organisations, including the University of Greenwich and University of Edinburgh, who have already implemented a fully integrated Software as a service (SaaS) suite of applications."
