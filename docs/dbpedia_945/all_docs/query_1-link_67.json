        "text": "Great Learning\n\nNamed Britain’s ‘Best Modern University’ by The Times Good University Guide 2006, Northumbria University offers a high standard of teaching, excellent facilities and a supportive environment for international students. Academic staff teaching our courses are expert in their fields and teach with commitment, experience and imagination. Courses are designed to offer students real skills which are immediately useful in today’s global workplace. With over 28,000 students, Northumbria is one of the largest universities in the country, offering 500 courses to choose from. Many courses include industrial experience or work placement, which is invaluable in the job market. The UK government’s Teaching Quality Assessment scores us at an average of 22.1 from a maximum of 24. Furthermore, over 20 Professional and Statutory bodies accredit the programmes in key professional areas.\n\nGreat Experience\n\nUniversity is located in the student city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which is home to over of 40,000 students. Around one in seven in the city is a student, which means there is plenty of good, cheap accommodation available. Students can also look forward to a bustling social life, with Newcastle voted 8th top city for night life in the world. There is also the opportunity to enjoy theatre, old ‘arty’ cinema, classical music, opera and dance, and art galleries. For a breath of fresh air, there are golden beaches, wild moorland, moody woodland, the biggest man-made lake in Europe, and more castles than anywhere in the UK, all within a short distance from the city. There isn’t a city in the UK that can match Newcastle at the moment.\n\nGreat Future\n\nNorthumbria is renowned for the excellence of its teaching and for preparing students for the world of work. The University also has partnerships and links with major companies and organisations helping graduates move on to secure great jobs. In fact, more than 95% of NU graduates are either employed or continuing in higher education 6 months after graduation. This is one of the highest post-graduation student success rates in the UK. In October 2005, work commenced on the building of a new extension to the campus due to open in September 2007. In addition to the construction of two new buildings, considerable investment is also being put into the refurbishment of buildings and landscaping on the existing campus. City Campus East is part of a £136 million investment in the Newcastle City Centre site by Northumbria University. The new campus will be home to 9,000 students studying at Newcastle Business School, the School of Design and the School of Law. It will be linked to the existing city centre site by a new landmark footbridge. The plans for the existing site include a new state-of-the-art sports complex, with a four-court sports hall, which could be opened up to create a 3,500-seat sporting arena that could also be used for events, conferences and examinations. There will also be a new fitness suite with up to 150 machines, squash courts, exercise and performance studios, a fencing room and a 40m running track – and to include a four-lane 50m ‘swimming tank’. The plans also include a significant investment in the existing teaching facilities and the magnificent Sutherland Building, currently home to the School of Law, will be extensively renovated and will herald the gateway to the entire campus.\n\nStudents review about the university can be found at :\n\nhttp://www.hotcourses.co.id/study/student-reviews-ratings/northumbria-university/5363/1/rankings.html"
