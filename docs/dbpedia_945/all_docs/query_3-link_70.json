        "text": "Concentrating solely on conglomerate and independent publishers, the figures show, unsurprisingly, that conglomerates are publishing the majority of the YA titles; although 2018 did see independents publishing their largest share (40.36%) of the time period (Figure 7). Table 1, which displays author ethnicity and type of publisher, shows that there are variations each year and no clear pattern. Even so, titles by authors of colour were more likely than their White counterparts to be published by conglomerates since 2013, especially in 2019, where 73.79% of title written by authors of colour were published by conglomerate publishers in comparison to 58.72% of titles written by White authors. At this juncture, it is important to note that conglomerates are not publishing more titles by authors of colours than White authors; out of the titles the authors of colour are writing, conglomerates are more likely to publish them than independent publishers. This is not a slight against independent publishers, who often do the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting and promoting socially marginalised voices (Ramdarshan Bold, “Leading the Way”). Looking at the difference between authors of colour from the US and the UK, it is clear that titles by authors of colour from the US skew the previous statistics (see Tables 2 and 3). Authors (both White and people of colour) from the US are far more likely to have their titles published by conglomerates. This is because they already have a publishing and sales history in the lucrative US market, and because independents simply might not be able to offer a comparable deal. In 2019, for example, conglomerates published 83.05% of titles by US authors of colour in comparison 64.52% of titles by UK authors of colour. However, there has been an increase in conglomerates publishing British authors of colour: in 2016 they published 46.15% of their titles. This rose to 64.52% in 2019.\n\nTable 1: Authors and their publishers: segmented by ethnicity and publisher type\n\nYear/publisher\n\nConglomerate\n\nIndependent\n\n2006\n\nWhite authors\n\n69.54%\n\n30.46%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n60.00%\n\n40.00%\n\n2007\n\nWhite authors\n\n67.32%\n\n32.68%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n72.55%\n\n27.45%\n\n2008\n\nWhite authors\n\n64.50%\n\n35.50%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n62.71%\n\n37.29%\n\n2009\n\nWhite authors\n\n62.84%\n\n37.16%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n60.32%\n\n39.68%\n\n2010\n\nWhite authors\n\n61.04%\n\n38.96%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n68.06%\n\n31.94%\n\n2011\n\nWhite authors\n\n69.08%\n\n30.92%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n54.39%\n\n45.61%\n\n2012\n\nWhite authors\n\n66.09%\n\n33.91%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n60.00%\n\n40.00%\n\n2013\n\nWhite authors\n\n60.36%\n\n39.64%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n71.43%\n\n28.57%\n\n2014\n\nWhite authors\n\n62.04%\n\n37.96%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n71.43%\n\n28.57%\n\n2015\n\nWhite authors\n\n64.37%\n\n35.63%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n75.68%\n\n24.32%\n\n2016\n\nWhite authors\n\n62.70%\n\n37.30%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n63.16%\n\n36.84%\n\n2017\n\nWhite authors\n\n62.69%\n\n37.31%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n73.17%\n\n26.83%\n\n2018\n\nWhite authors\n\n59.62%\n\n40.38%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n61.64%\n\n38.36%\n\n2019\n\nWhite authors\n\n58.72%\n\n41.28%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n73.79%\n\n26.21%\n\nTable 2: UK authors and their publishers: segmented by ethnicity and publisher type\n\nYear/publisher\n\nConglomerate\n\nIndependent\n\n2006\n\nWhite authors\n\n68.89%\n\n31.11%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n100.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n2007\n\nWhite authors\n\n65.18%\n\n34.82%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n66.67%\n\n33.33%\n\n2008\n\nWhite authors\n\n59.41%\n\n40.59%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n60.00%\n\n40.00%\n\n2009\n\nWhite authors\n\n50.18%\n\n49.82%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n80.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n2010\n\nWhite authors\n\n48.82%\n\n51.18%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n63.64%\n\n36.36%\n\n2011\n\nWhite authors\n\n58.88%\n\n41.12%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n40.00%\n\n60.00%\n\n2012\n\nWhite authors\n\n52.01%\n\n47.99%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n55.56%\n\n44.44%\n\n2013\n\nWhite authors\n\n44.32%\n\n55.68%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n38.89%\n\n61.11%\n\n2014\n\nWhite authors\n\n53.25%\n\n46.75%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n54.55%\n\n45.45%\n\n2015\n\nWhite authors\n\n53.06%\n\n46.94%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n58.33%\n\n41.67%\n\n2016\n\nWhite authors\n\n53.67%\n\n46.33%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n46.15%\n\n53.85%\n\n2017\n\nWhite authors\n\n56.21%\n\n43.79%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n68.42%\n\n31.58%\n\n2018\n\nWhite authors\n\n50.37%\n\n49.63%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n40.00%\n\n60.00%\n\n2019\n\nWhite authors\n\n50.00%\n\n50.00%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n64.52%\n\n35.48%\n\nTable 3: US authors and their publishers: segmented by ethnicity and publisher type\n\nYear/Publisher type\n\nConglomerate\n\nIndependent\n\n2006\n\nWhite authors\n\n74.02%\n\n25.98%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n75.00%\n\n25.00%\n\n2007\n\nWhite authors\n\n72.26%\n\n27.74%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n71.79%\n\n28.21%\n\n2008\n\nWhite authors\n\n74.24%\n\n25.76%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n62.50%\n\n37.50%\n\n2009\n\nWhite authors\n\n79.39%\n\n20.61%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n58.00%\n\n42.00%\n\n2010\n\nWhite authors\n\n73.02%\n\n26.98%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n70.69%\n\n29.31%\n\n2011\n\nWhite authors\n\n79.67%\n\n20.33%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n61.36%\n\n38.64%\n\n2012\n\nWhite authors\n\n80.34%\n\n19.66%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n63.04%\n\n36.96%\n\n2013\n\nWhite authors\n\n79.89%\n\n20.11%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n84.62%\n\n15.38%\n\n2014\n\nWhite authors\n\n77.10%\n\n22.90%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n100.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n2015\n\nWhite authors\n\n84.08%\n\n15.92%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n80.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n2016\n\nWhite authors\n\n80.77%\n\n19.23%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n88.89%\n\n11.11%\n\n2017\n\nWhite authors\n\n75.00%\n\n25.00%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n80.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n2018\n\nWhite authors\n\n78.13%\n\n21.88%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n71.74%\n\n28.26%\n\n2019\n\nWhite authors\n\n71.34%\n\n28.66%\n\nAuthors of colour\n\n83.05%\n\n16.95%\n\nBestseller Analysis\n\nPeople of colour, US authors, and men, were better represented in the bestseller lists than they were in the overall output. In the 2017-2019 list (Table 4), 60% of the bestselling titles were written by women and, out of the thirteen authors on the bestseller list, 61.5% (8) were women. White men are the dominant group in the 2017-2019 bestselling author list: making up 38.5% of the bestselling authors despite accounting for 28.59% of all YA authors published in this period. Women of colour and White women accounted for 30.75% each on the bestseller list but 9.02% and 58.3%, respectively, on the overall 2017-2019 list (see figure 6). This means that despite there being around six times as many White women being published than women of colour, there are the same number of both groups in the bestseller list. 90% of the titles in the 2017-2019 list were from the US. Only two UK authors made the list: Holly Jackson’s 2019 A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder (at number 12) and David Almond’s 2017 Island (at number 14). The visibility of US authors on the bestsellers lists gives a skewed picture of YA authorship: this has led to UKYA authors believing the UK market is dominated by USYA authors. The high proportion of USYA authors on the bestseller lists can (partly) be explained/examined by referring to the previous section; as noted in Table 3, USYA authors are more likely, than their UKYA counterparts, to be published by conglomerate publishers. These companies have larger marketing budgets and distribution infrastructure than independent publishers. Additionally, publishers invest more in what they consider to be ‘big books’ (i.e. books they believe will be successful): this includes larger print runs, more marketing and promotional spend and events, greater in-house attention, and prioritisation in sales meetings (Thompson). Although it is difficult to predict what will become a bestseller – Thompson surmises, “[t]he difference between a big book and a bestseller is the difference between aspiration and reality” (193) – such ‘big books’ do receive special treatment (193). This could be the underlying reason for the discontent expressed by UKYA authors as they struggle for attention in the face of the US juggernaut (despite being the dominant group in overall YA authorship).\n\nThe influx of authors of colour from the US has had a positive impact on the UK bestseller lists. In 2017-2019, a quarter of the 20 bestselling titles in the UK were by authors of colour: this is five times the number of titles than in the 2006-2016 period, when Malorie Blackman, the former Children’s Laureate, was the only author of colour on the list (at number 19) (Ramdarshan Bold, “The Eight Percent Problem”). As detailed in Table 4, four US authors of colour appear in the 2017-2019 list: Tomi Adeyemi (at number 13), Jenny Han (at number 18), Angie Thomas (at number 3), and Nicola Yoon (at numbers 2 and 9). Unlike the 2006-2016 period, authors of colour were better represented in bestselling books in 2017, 2018, and 2019 than in overall YA output. In fact, in 2019, 40% of the bestselling titles were by authors of colour: eight out of the 20 titles (Table 5). However, in this three-year period, looking at individual years rather than the combination of the three, the same five authors of colour appear: Adeyemi (who appears in the 2018 and 2019 after her debut novel, Children of Blood and Bone, the first book in her Legacy of Orisha series, was published in 2018); Blackman (who only appears in 2019, with Noughts & Crosses possibly boosted after the announcement of the BBC adaptation of the Noughts & Crosses, and the fifth book in series, Crossfire was published, in 2019, after an 11 year break ); Han (whose To All The Boys series appears in 2018 and 2019, following the popularity of the Netflix film ); Angie Thomas (The Hate U Give appears on all three lists ); and Yoon (who appears on all three lists, presumably, in part, due to the film adaptations of her novels – Everything, Everything and The Sun is Also a Star – being released in 2017 and 2019 ) (see Table 8). Like in 2006-2016, Blackman is the only UKYA author of colour to feature in the 2017-2019 lists, with her award-winning novel Noughts & Crosses (the first of a trilogy, originally, but now extended to a tetralogy). The US authors of colour bring genre diversity to the list; a mix of YA fantasy, contemporary/realistic fiction, and contemporary romance. Only two of the titles by the authors of colour – Noughts & Crosses and The Hate U Give – deal explicitly with topics of race/racism, showing that authors of colour do not need to write trauma narratives to be commercially successful.\n\nThe success of a book and an author is often linked to the author’s name recognition and the success of the previous books. Three authors published in the 2017-2019 period appeared on the overall bestseller list and the bestseller lists for each year: John Green, Turtles All the Way Down (2017), The Fault in Our Stars (2018, 2019); Karen McManus, One Of Us Is Lying (2017, 2018, 2019), Two Can Keep a Secret (2019); and Nicola Yoon, Everything, Everything (2017, 2018), The Sun is also a Star (2017, 2018, 2019). Both McManus and Yoon gained recognition from, and developed large readerships with, their debut novels (One Of Us Is Lying and Everything, Everything) while Green, best known for his fourth novel (The Fault in Our Stars), has built his large readership gradually in the UK. This reveals that film and television adaptations can also catapult YA authors, particularly authors of colour, into bestseller lists.\n\nCharacters of colour are also better represented within the bestselling titles. In 2006-2016, “[n]inety percent (18) of the bestselling YA titles of 2006–2016 feature White, heterosexual, able-bodied, cisgender main protagonists (human or otherwise)” (Ramdarshan Bold, “The Eight Percent Problem” 401): in 2017-2019, 60% (12) of the bestselling titles had characters of colour. These characters were written by both the authors of colour and White authors on the list. It is important to note that increasing the number of books featuring characters of colour, but written by White authors, is not the solution to the problem of underrepresentation. This is especially true if authors of colour continue to be underrepresented and if cultural gatekeepers continue to minimise their experiences, as has been the case until now.\n\nTable 4: Top 20 bestselling YA titles in the UK (2017-2019)\n\nPosition\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor\n\nImprint\n\nPublisher\n\nVolume\n\nTable 5: Top 20 bestselling YA titles in the UK (2019)\n\nPosition\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor\n\nImprint\n\nPublisher\n\nVolume\n\nTable 6: Top 20 bestselling YA titles in the UK (2018)\n\nTable 7: Top 20 bestselling YA titles in the UK (2017)\n\nPosition\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor\n\nImprint\n\nPublisher\n\nVolume\n\nTable 8: Authors of colour in the bestsellers lists (2006-2019)\n\nConclusion\n\nThe main purpose of this article is to provide ongoing statistical evidence to support discussions about YA authors of colour being published in the UK publishing industry. The data presented in this article is encouraging and demonstrates a yearly increase in the percentage of authors of colour being published and appearing on bestseller lists. 2019, in particular, shows how far the publishing industry has progressed over this 14-year period of study. While these increases are positive, they are still small and are from a very low starting point. Although the data presented here shows that the number of YA authors of colour being published has increased, this article does not fully investigate what types of books are being published. For example: are YA authors of colour still being encouraged to write stereotypical depictions of their cultural heritage, or books centred on race, racism or trauma, which has been the case in the past; and have their experiences, sometimes negative, of the publishing industry changed since 2016?\n\nDespite various initiatives, conversations, and well-meaning intentions, authors of colour continue to face barriers in the UK publishing industry (Ramdarshan Bold, Inclusive Young Adult Fiction, “Representation of People of Colour, (2007-2017)”). In fact, British novelist Dorothy Koomson described it as a “hostile environment for black authors” (@DorothyKoomson; Flood, “Black British Authors”). The #PublishingPaidMe conversation in 2020 shows that authors of colour, particularly Black authors, are still undervalued by publishers. The #PublishingPaidMe hashtag was started by African-American YA author L.L. McKinney to highlight the pay gap between Black and non-Black authors. The hashtag, which quickly trended on Twitter, allowed authors to share their advances (Flood, “#Publishingpaidme). Malorie Blackman tweeted: “I'm currently writing my 70th book. Though not all my books are in print any more, I have never in my life received anything like the sums being posted by some White authors on #PublishingPaidMe” (@malorieblackman). Blackman, as outlined above, is the only UKYA author of colour, and one of the three UKYA authors, to appear in the top 20 bestsellers list, 2017-2019 (see Tables 5 and 8). It should be stressed that advances are not indicative of the quality of a work but of the level of confidence the publisher places on the book and the consumer. As N.K. Jemisin argues, and as confirmed by academic research, this confidence can be swayed by implicit and unconscious biases, and, in some cases, racism (@nkjemisin; Childress and Nault; Saha and Van Lente).\n\nPublishers have expressed their commitment to ‘diversity’ in recent years and this seems to be reflected in the increased numbers. Women of colour, in particular, have shown that they can sell books in large numbers, as evidenced by the bestseller lists, despite the low percentage of women of authors of colour being published each year. However, as demonstrated in some of the incidents around remuneration, content, and the small number of repeatedly published authors, this commitment has proven to be merely performative in some cases. Statistical evidence may show a positive increase, but structural inequalities – as brought to the fore by the #PublishingPaidMe conversations – persist. The visibility of Black authors rose in 2020, in part due the expansion of Black Lives Matter as a global movement following the murder of George Floyd. In the UK, Bernardine Evaristo (Girl, Woman, Other) and Reni Eddo-Lodge (Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race) were the first Black British women to top the UK’s fiction and nonfiction paperback charts, following George Floyd’s murder (Flood, “Black British Authors”). Eddo-Lodge said of the news, “[c]an't help but be dismayed by this – the tragic circumstances in which this achievement came about. The fact that it's 2020 and I'm the first. Let's be honest. Reader demand aside, that it took this long is a horrible indictment of the publishing industry” (@renireni). While publishers may have good intentions about improving representation and better supporting Black and other authors of colour, it is important that they first interrogate their own role in perpetuating inequality before trying to profit from conversations about race/racism. They must question their own intentions behind publishing books by and about socially marginalised groups, and understand when and how their practices might be harmful to authors and readers. In the future, a positive step would be for authors of colour to receive the same kinds of deals their White peers are offered, for all kinds of narratives, not just those about race and racism. YA books that explore issues of racism, discrimination, prejudice, and inequality – the types of books by authors of colour that publishers like to publish – are still vital. However, more stories, about the different facets of British youth culture, are needed for the publishing industry, and the books and stories it produces, to be truly representative.\n\nBlack authors, and other authors of colour, more often get deals when they write race-based narratives, generally around trauma (McKinney; Reddin; Saha and Van Lente; Ramdarshan Bold, Inclusive Young Adult Fiction). In the future, a positive step would be to see more UKYA where ethnicity is incidental – where the “ordinariness” (that is, the centring on everyday life and activities) that Alison Waller describes is more of a defining feature than the protagonist’s ethnicity – and where publishers are not simply commodifying a movement or a trend. Teenagers in the UK often read about the youth experience through a US lens, so it a more multifaceted range of UKYA is needed to explore all facets of British identity. Conglomerate publishers, with global reach and bigger marketing budgets, are key to supporting UKYA authors of colour and ensuring their work is not just accessible to UK readers, but to readers around the world.\n\nReferences\n\nAlter, Alexandra and Elizabeth A.
