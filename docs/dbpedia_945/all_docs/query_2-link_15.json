        "text": "Aims and scope\n\nJournal metrics\n\nAbstracting and indexing\n\nEquity, Diversity and Inclusion\n\nTestimonials\n\nContact us\n\nAims and scope\n\nGlobal Discourse is an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented journal of applied contemporary thought operating at the intersection of politics, international relations, sociology and social policy. The journal's scope is broad, encouraging interrogation of current affairs with regard to core questions of distributive justice, wellbeing, cultural diversity, autonomy, sovereignty, security and recognition. All issues are themed and aimed at addressing pressing issues as they emerge. Rejecting the notion that publication is the final stage in the research process, Global Discourse seeks to foster discussion and debate between often artificially isolated disciplines and paradigms, with responses to articles encouraged and conversations continued across issues.\n\nThe journal features a mix of full-length articles, each accompanied by one or more replies, including those with a specific policy focus written by non-academic experts and organisations. With an international advisory editorial board consisting of experienced, highly cited academics, Global Discourse publishes themed issues on topics as they emerge. Authors are encouraged to explore the international dimensions and implications of their work.\n\nAll research articles in this journal have undergone rigorous peer review, based on initial editor screening and double-blind peer review. All submissions must be in response to a specific call for papers.\n\nJournal metrics\n\n2023 Impact Factor: 1.8\n\nRankings: 48/165 International Relations (Q2)\n\n110/317 Political Science (Q2)\n\n83/217 Sociology (Q2)\n\n2023 Journal Citation Indicator (JCI): 1.34\n\nRankings: 29/165 International Relations (Q1)\n\n62/317 Political Science (Q1)\n\n42/217 Sociology (Q1)\n\n2023 Scopus CiteScore: 4.1\n\nRankings: 91/706 Political Science and International Relations (87th percentile)\n\n276/1,466 Sociology and Political Science (81st percentile)\n\nBack to top\n\nAbstracting and Indexing\n\nScopus\n\nEmerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)\n\nEuropean Reference Index for the Humanities and Social Sciences (ERIH PLUS)\n\nBack to top\n\nEquity, Diversity and Inclusion\n\nOur Equity, Diversity and Inclusion statement outlines the ways in which we seek to ensure that equity, diversity and inclusion are integral to all aspects of our publishing, and how we might encourage and drive positive change.\n\nBack to top\n\nTestimonials\n\n“In difficult and challenging times, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic and its many sociopolitical and economic consequences, the journal Global Discourse fulfils salient functions: to continuously reflect and explain social transformation and change from inter- and post-disciplinary perspectives, in systematic detail. Such critical reflection allows scholars and lay-persons alike to distance themselves from their daily emotional involvement, thus providing space for new future mid-term and long-term imaginaries.”\n\nRuth Wodak, Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Discourse Studies, Lancaster University, UK\n\n“There is little room for impartial skepticism in our hyper-partisan public policy environment. Global Discourse is a welcome publication for those who are averse to dogma and willing to unsettle 'consensus views'.”\n\nRichard A. Shweder, Harold Higgins Swift Distinguished Service Professor, Department of Comparative Human Development, University of Chicago, USA\n\n“In the future the most transformative research and scholarship is likely to occur at the nexus or intersection between traditional disciplines and professional boundaries. Global Discourse is arguably the world-leading journal for provoking debates, connecting scholars and redefining how critical social challenges are framed and understood. It is a journal that is shaping the future rather than being stuck in the past.”\n\nMatthew Flinders, Professor of Politics, University of Sheffield, UK and Vice-President of the Political Studies Association, UK\n\n“In the spirit of the critical Frankfurt school, Global Discourse takes seriously the necessity to discuss political themes beyond academic borders and rigidity and gives voice to scholars committed to research as an emancipatory project crossing disciplines and traditions.”\n\nThomas Lindemann, Professor of Political Science, Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin, France\n\n“Global Discourse is more global and more of a discourse than most other academic journals in its fields. Its innovative way to advance the global discourse and the relevance of its topics for a variety of different disciplines make it unique among its peers.”\n\nAlexander Vuving, Professor, Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, USA\n\nContact us\n\nEditorial enquiries:\n\nEditor: Matthew Johnson, matthew7.johnson@northumbria.ac.uk\n\nOpen access, subscriptions and free trials:\n\nBristol University Press: bup-journals@bristol.ac.uk\n\nBack to top\n\nRead our instructions for authors for guidance on how to prepare your submissions. The instructions include the following:\n\nWhat are we looking for?\n\nHow to submit an article\n\nEthical guidelines\n\nCopyright and permissions\n\nStyle\n\nAlt-text\n\nReferences\n\nEnglish language editing service\n\nOpen Access\n\nSelf-archiving and institutional repositories\n\nHow to maximise the impact of your article\n\nContact us\n\nVisit our journal author toolkit for resources and advice to support you through the publication process and beyond.\n\nWhat are we looking for?\n\nGlobal Discourse publishes exclusively themed issues. All submissions must be in response to a specific call for papers. We are unable to publish material that does not relate to the content of the issues planned.\n\nWe are always keen to receive proposals for themed issues. Proposals should be submitted by email to the Journal Editor, Matthew Johnson.\n\nResearch articles and replies: Global Discourse publishes a range of articles of up to 9,000 words in length (including any notes, references, tables, figures etc.) on key, pressing issues of the day. Given our discursive focus, we have a commitment to development of pieces that examine, in innovative ways, issues that matter, particularly at a global level. Each article is accompanied by a reply of up to 1,000 words produced by one of the paper’s external referees. Authors of replies are selected on the basis of their ability to advance interdisciplinary examination of the argument at hand. The outcome is journal issues that address problems from a range of perspectives, each rigorously interrogated. By submitting a research article to Global Discourse you confirm that you agree to the journal’s policies on research articles and replies.\n\nSubmission guidelines for replies: Titles of replies should follow this format: 'A reply to [title of article] by [name of author]'. Replies do not have abstracts but should include up to five keywords. They should be no more than 1,000 words long, should not include primary research, and should have no more than six references, including one to the article to which the piece is responding\n\nPolicy replies: Global Discourse sees policy making as a central feature of academic publishing within the social sciences and each issue includes policy replies written by policy makers in response to key articles. Policy replies are generally 1,000–3,000 words in length. These replies foster thoroughgoing engagement between academics and policy makers in specific fields. The intention is to achieve research impact by examining the scope of application for ideas advanced and to present cutting-edge policy positions that have transformative capacity. We actively solicit a diverse range of opinions and responses in order to overcome the ‘echo chamber’ effect that so often dominates discussions. Put simply, the Global Discourse Policy section is driven by intellectual need, not ideological dogma.\n\nContributions are solicited by the Editors from think tanks, local and national government, intergovernmental organisations, NGOs, charities, political parties, journalists and leading figures in business and industry. Please consult our submission guidelines for Policy section authors.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow to submit an article\n\nAll Research articles should initially be submitted by email to the Guest Editor(s) of the themed issue. They must be properly anonymised for double anonymous peer review (see instructions below).\n\nPolicy replies should be submitted via email to the relevant Guest Editor(s) of the themed issue. They do not need to be anonymised, as they are reviewed internally by members of the Editorial Advisory Board.\n\nAuthors of all articles, once they have been conditionally accepted, will be invited to make their final article submission via the Global Discourse Editorial Manager website.\n\nInitial manuscript submission\n\nResearch article manuscripts must be in Word or Rich Text Format (not pdf) and must be fully anonymised prior to submission to the Guest Editor(s).\n\nPreparing your anonymised Research article manuscript\n\nYour initial submission must consist of the following separate files:\n\nA fully anonymised manuscript which does not include information that would identify the author(s) such as acknowledgements, funding details or conflicts of interest. References to the author's own work should be anonymised as follows: 'Author's own, [year]'. The file should not have any document properties or personal information that would identify the author(s) (see guidance on how to remove hidden data and personal information from a Microsoft Office file for further help). Please note that submissions that have not been sufficiently anonymised will be returned.\n\nIf you have any figures and tables these can be included in the manuscript on first submission but must be uploaded as separate files at the end of the manuscript when submitting the final version. Please indicate where these should be placed in the text by inserting: ‘Figure X here’ and provide numbers, titles and sources where appropriate. The files should not have any properties or personal information that would identify the author(s) (see guidance on how to remove hidden data and personal information from a Microsoft Office file for further help).\n\nIn order to improve our accessibility for people with visual impairments, we are now required to ask authors to provide a brief description known as alt text to describe any visual content such as photos, illustrations or figures. It will not be visible in the article but is embedded into the images so a PDF reader can read out the descriptions. Guidance on how to write this is available here: Bristol University Press | Alt-text guidance for authors.\n\nAdditional information: please provide funding information (if applicable), a conflict of interest statement and acknowledgements in a separate file from your anonymised manuscript, to ensure that no information that could identify you as the author is sent to peer reviewers. Information about declaring conflicts of interest can be found in the Bristol University Press/ Policy Press ethical guidelines.\n\nOnce a submission has been conditionally accepted, you will be invited to submit a final, non-anonymised version via Editorial Manager.\n\nEditorial Manager\n\nManuscripts must be in Word or Rich Text Format (not pdf). New users should first create an account, specify their areas of interest and provide full contact details.\n\nFor help submitting an article via Editorial Manager, please view our online tutorial.\n\nPlease also see our Journals Editorial Policies.\n\nChecklist: what to include in your final non-anonymised manuscript:\n\nThe main manuscript including\n\nThe non-anonymised text of your article: please ensure this does not exceed the maximum word count for your article type.\n\nKey messages: Each research article must include 3–4 ‘key messages’ summarising the main messages from the paper in up to four bullet points. The contribution made by the paper to the field should be clear from these key messages. Each bullet point must be less than 100 characters. These points may be used by the editorial board to promote your article on Twitter.\n\nFunding details: list any funding including the grant numbers you have received for the research covered in your article as follows: ‘This work was supported by the [Funding Agency] under Grant [number xxxx].’\n\nConflict of interest statement: please declare any possible conflicts of interest, or state ‘The author(s) declare(s) that there is no conflict of interest’ if there are none.\n\nAcknowledgements: acknowledge people who have provided you with any substantial assistance or advice with collecting the data, developing your ideas, editing or any other comments to develop your argument or text.\n\nFigures and tables: should be submitted as separate files. Figures should ideally be in an Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) file format. Please indicate where figures and tables should be placed in the text by inserting: ‘Figure/Table X here’ and provide numbers, titles and sources (where appropriate).\n\nIn order to improve our accessibility for people with visual impairments, we are now required to ask authors to provide a brief description known as alt text to describe any visual content such as photos, illustrations or figures. It will not be visible in the article but is embedded into the images so a PDF reader can read out the descriptions. Guidance on how to write this is available here: Bristol University Press | Alt-text guidance for authors.\n\nSupplementary data: We recommend that any supplemental data is hosted in a data repository (such as figshare) for maximum exposure, and is cited as a reference in the article.\n\nJournal Contributor Publishing Agreement: please upload a scanned copy of the completed and signed agreement with your final non-anonymised manuscript. The Journal Contributor Publishing Agreement can be downloaded here.\n\nEditorial review process\n\nAll submissions are first desk-reviewed by the editor(s) who will assess whether the manuscript fits the aims and scope as well as the quality standards of the journal. Research articles that are selected to be sent out for review will be evaluated through double anonymous peer review by at least two referees. Global Discourse aims to return the reviews along with an initial decision within two months of submission. Policy articles and book reviews are reviewed by members of the editorial board and do not therefore go through double anonymous peer review.\n\nPlease note, that due to the journal’s policy of soliciting replies to published articles from reviewers, the identities of the author of an article and any reviewer producing a reply for publication will be revealed to one another once an article is accepted for publication.\n\nBack to top\n\nEthical guidelines\n\nAt Policy Press we are committed to upholding the highest standards of review and publication ethics in our journals.

Proposals are now invited for themed issues, in the format described below, for consideration by the Editor.\n\nThe Editor will announce the initial decision on proposals received, and indicate those accepted for development and planned publication by 1st September 2024.\n\nAbout the journal\n\nGlobal Discourse is an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented journal of applied contemporary thought operating at the intersection of politics, international relations, sociology, social policy and socio-legal studies. The journal's scope is broad, encouraging interrogation of current affairs with regard to core questions of distributive justice, wellbeing, cultural diversity, autonomy, sovereignty, security and recognition. All issues are themed and aimed at addressing pressing issues as they emerge. Rejecting the notion that publication is the final stage in the research process, Global Discourse seeks to foster discussion and debate between often artificially isolated disciplines and paradigms, with responses to articles encouraged and conversations continued across issues.\n\nWith an international editorial advisory board consisting of experienced, highly cited academics, Global Discourse publishes themed issues on topics as they emerge. Authors are encouraged to explore the international dimensions and implications of their work.\n\nGlobal Discourse is indexed in the Web of Science’s Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) and has an Impact Factor of 1.5.\n\nWhat are we looking for?\n\nA themed issue aims to bring together six to eight cutting-edge research articles, each accompanied by one or more commentaries, that engage centrally with a specific problem or set of problems with clear policy implications.\n\nThis means that the remit is broad, and recent issues have focused on: the potential value of evolutionary theory to policymaking on climate change, social security and other areas; the central role of interdisciplinarity in dealing with multiple overlapping crises; the role of emotion in pandemic governance; the challenge of precarity in housing.\n\nThis problem-oriented focus means that an issue proposal needs to be concerned with relating theory to practice and applying interdisciplinary approaches to otherwise isolated fields. We want issues that are genuinely innovative and provide pathways through to groundbreaking research and real-world impact.\n\nHow to present a themed issue proposal\n\nA themed issue proposal must include ALL the following information.\n\nTitle: This should clearly reflect the field and content of the proposed themed issue\n\nDetails of the Guest Editor(s): Provide contact details, institutional affiliations, and a short academic profile (150 words maximum) for each proposed guest editor\n\nDescription: In no more than 750 words, outline the intellectual focus of the proposed themed issue, stating how its proposed content engages with significant issues, and the contribution it will make to the field\n\nDraft contents page: This should set out the structure of the themed issue, listing the titles and authors of each proposed article and stating clearly whether named contributors are already confirmed, or are speculative. It should also include plans for replies\n\nPublication schedule: Please include yout timetable for initial submission, review, re-submission etc.\n\nPlans for impact: Please consider how the themed issue could be promoted and disseminated (blogs, listservs, events, conferences, other social media etc.)\n\nHow will the proposal be assessed?\n\nProposals will be assessed by members of the Global Discourse Management Board and decisions will be made based on the following criteria:\n\n1. Intellectual significance, originality and rigour\n\nDoes the proposal seek to challenge dominant assumptions?\n\nWill it set the agenda in terms of future debates?\n\nDoes it have novel, timely or innovative dimensions?\n\nDoes it aim to fill a significant gap in the current literature?\n\n2. International appeal: This is vital given the focus of the journal\n\n3. Editorial leadership\n\nAre the proposed guest editors experts in the field?\n\nDo they have a track record in producing cutting-edge research?\n\nIs the timetable realistic?\n\nDo the guest editors of the themed issue intend to play a proactive role in steering and managing the development and promotion of the themed issue?\n\nDo the guest editors have the time and capacity to dedicate the required level of attention to this project?\n\n4. Profile of contributors: Global Discourse is committed to supporting scholars from all background, disciplines and parts of the world. Proposals that include a mix of established scholars and ‘rising stars’, and which are internationally inclusive are particularly welcome.\n\nThe editorial process\n\nIf a proposal is accepted, a clear timeline will be established. The guest editor(s) will normally manage the process of:\n\nInitially considering the papers and making sure they are correctly anonymised for double-anonymous peer review\n\nIdentifying reviewers and sending papers out for external review\n\nMaking recommendations on whether to accept or reject papers, to be reviewed by the Journal Editor prior to communication to authors\n\nCommunicating decisions to authors\n\nCommissioning replies to articles accepted for publication (in consultation with the Journal Editor), which are generally the produced by an article’s external referee\n\nKeeping accurate records of the entire editorial process including all the correspondence and reviews, and handing these over to the Journal Editor when the issue has been completed\n\nEditorial obligations\n\nThe editorial team of Global Discourse has an obligation to publish issues of sufficient quality according to agreed schedules.\n\nThe Editors will aim to publish the themed issue according to the original agreed timeline, but proposers should note, and inform all potential contributors, that the Editors may decide to run the themed issue in a different journal issue than originally planned if there is an insufficient numbers of articles that meet the quality standards of the journal, or determine that none of the papers meet the required quality standards.\n\nTarget timescales for review process in chronological order\n\nActor Action Weeks in which to complete action Editor Initial editorial assessment 1 Editor Allocation of referee 1 Referee Initial review 4 Editor Decision returned to author 1 Author Minor revisions 4 Author Substantive revisions 8 Referee Review of revisions 2 Referee Reply 4 Author Formatting and submission of final manuscript 1\n\nIssues may be cancelled if:\n\nEmails from the Editorial Team to Guest Editors go unanswered for a period of 14 days\n\nInsufficient evidence of progress is provided following submission deadlines\n\nDeadlines are unmet\n\nIf the quality of submissions is insufficient\n\nIf there is evidence of malpractice or delay with regard to the review process\n\nSubmitting your proposal\n\nPlease submit your proposal to the Global Discourse Editor, Professor Matthew Johnson (matthew7.johnson@northumbria.ac.uk) by 01 August 2024.\n\nProposals must include all the information outlined in the 'how to present a themed proposal' section. Incomplete proposals will be returned for completion."
