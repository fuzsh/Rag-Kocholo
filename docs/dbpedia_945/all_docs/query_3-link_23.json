        "text": "It is not uncommon for media coverage and policy discussions about the illegal wildlife trade to mention that it is linked to other forms of criminality, particularly drug trafficking (South and Wyatt 2011). Indeed, Massé et al. (2020) detail the exemplary case of such discussions during the 2018 London Wildlife Trade Conference. The illegal wildlife trade, they say, was defined as ‘serious organized crime’ and emphasis was placed upon its ‘convergence with other forms of “serious” crime’, such that a ‘common refrain’ was that criminal networks smuggling rhino horn and hardwood also traffic in drugs and guns. Massé et al. (2020: 30) argue that ‘little to no evidence was provided to support these statements’ and while there ‘is overlap between actors and networks trafficking in wildlife and other products, to suggest that this happens in every case … fails to … reflect the nuances of how harvesting and trade in some wildlife products occurs.’\n\nIn other words, overlaps do not always occur – and it is interesting to consider why not? Sometimes they do – but in varied and different ways. And the need to appreciate the complexity and ‘nuances’ of the practices, relationships and economics involved in all this is vital. Galemba (2017), Shelley (2018) and Mackenzie (2020), for example, explain how illicit trades may interact in varied ways, dependent upon the influences of globalization, new technologies and forms of communications.\n\nIn 2011, South and Wyatt (2011: 538) revisited their original fieldwork (Dorn and South 1990; Wyatt 2009) in order to examine ‘similarities and differences between two highly profitable, but distinctive illicit markets’. That paper sought to: further insights into the illegal wildlife trade through comparison with the more thoroughly studied illegal drug trade; to contribute to studies of drug trafficking by elaborating on its relationships with other forms of organized criminal enterprises; to draw together the fields of green criminology and the criminology of organized crime; and to aid in the development of prevention tactics. This paper builds upon this earlier exploratory framework, adds discussion of more recent published and grey literature,Footnote 1 and presents original fieldwork that illustrates wildlife and drug trafficking connections of various kinds.\n\nDefinitions\n\nIn this study, we are talking about drugs ‘with an illegal status in law’ and to a lesser degree legal drugs that are ‘diverted via theft or sale to an illicit market and sold and used illegally’ (South and Wyatt 2011: 542). Wildlife is defined as ‘all non-human animals, plants, and fungi which form part of a country’s natural environment or which are visitors in a wild or captured state’ and their derivatives (Nurse and Wyatt 2020: 5). Trade encompasses the collection, harvesting, possession, processing, acquiring, or transporting of wildlife for the purpose of purchasing, importing, exporting, selling, bartering, or exchanging. Wildlife trafficking or the illegal wildlife trade involves ‘the illegal trade, smuggling, poaching, capture, or collection of endangered species, protected wildlife (including animals or plants that are subject to harvest quotas and regulated by permits), derivatives, or products thereof’ (South and Wyatt 2011: 542).\n\nAims\n\nThe purpose of this article is to revisit the possibilities of wildlife/drug trades overlaps and synergies, providing concrete examples of where these markets co-exist or intertwine. We explore the question ‘Why - in some cases - an illicit market remains focused on a single commodity, whilst in others it accommodates a combination of illicit commodities?’ One answer, as suggested by Reuter and O’Regan (2017) in their study of participants involved in ‘wildlife trafficking into the United States from elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere’ is that some individuals or small organisations are engaging with quite ‘distinct specialised markets’. In other cases, however, ‘[c]riminal organizations involved in wildlife trafficking are often directly connected to other trafficking networks, with the profits being used for all manner of illegal activities’ (C4, 2018). For instance, a 2018 U.S. Intelligence Community analysis of multi-agency crime data on an East African country found that ‘more than two-thirds of the actors in the wildlife crime dataset overlapped with individuals and facilitators in the narcotics dataset’ (TNRC 2020). Sosnowski (2019: 6) suggests that while Reuter and O’Regan ‘argue that there are more differences than commonly acknowledged between the illicit trades in wildlife and narcotics’ their study was ‘limited to trade activities in the Americas, and particularly smuggling into the United States.’ Sosnowski (2019: 6) points out that a more global view is required, and, for example, illegal ivory is ‘primarily sourced across Africa and directed to markets in Asia’ leading to different trade patterns which ‘closely mirror … narcotics trafficking.’\n\nThis paper also aims to do more to highlight the implications for species and environmental harms caused by both trades. All economic activity is ultimately based on the value of resources, and the subsequent production and trade of goods, legal or illegal, is dependent on processes of cultivation and harvesting, mining and extraction, manufacturing and distribution. These activities obviously result in legacies and consequences for environments and the non-human and human species affected. The paper explores these harms through some of the examples given. We begin by providing the background as to an overlooked importance of studying the illegal wildlife and drugs markets and their convergence. We then provide a brief overview of the two illegal markets. Then, we detail the methodology used to provide evidence of convergence and/or connections. This is followed by proposed categories of methods and motives operating within and linking these markets, and reference to evidence for these based on original empirical data as well as the research literature. The categories are: combined contraband, camouflage, multiple trade lines, shared smuggling routes and transportation methods, barter trade, and laundering for drug money. We then speculate as to how and why these methods and motives have emerged.\n\nWe note that there are varied motives for smuggling a commodity and reasons for using particular techniques (e.g., smuggling illegal commodities mixed together, or smuggling one illegal commodity hidden within or by a different but legal commodity). Our analyses do not suggest that wildlife and drugs trades and smuggling are now converging ‘always and everywhere’. They do suggest that when this happens it often appears to occur in ways that we categorize as follows: combined contraband (both illegal wildlife and illegal drugs in shared shipments), camouflage (legal wildlife-illegal drugs in shared shipments), multiple trade lines (illegal wildlife and illegal drugs, where the groups run different businesses), shared smuggling routes and transportation methods (illegal wildlife and illegal drugs using the same pathways, but not at the same time), barter trade (exchanging wildlife for drugs and vice versa), and laundering for drug money (legal wildlife industries as a cover for illegal drug money) (Table 1).\n\nCombined contraband\n\nMixing illegal commodities together may occur for reasons of convenience, expedience or opportunity. In ‘Smuggling Multi-Consignment Contraband’ (MCC) Lichtenwald et al. (2009: 18) state that when ‘the smuggling network is already established; certain types of contraband combinations do not raise the level of detection, and changing geopolitical and market pressures make MCC a reasonable business decision’. Already in the 1990s and 2000s, reports claimed that Colombian drug cartelsFootnote 3 were smuggling ‘mixed shipments of drugs and wildlife products’ into the US (UN 2002: 6). Elliott (2009: 66) provides several examples of combined contraband, including protected turtles that ‘have been found in the same shipments as marijuana’ and ‘parrots and drugs [that] have been smuggled together from Cote d’Ivoire to Israel’, while Phillips (2010) reports that in 2010, 285 radiated tortoises and 15 spider tortoises were smuggled from Madagascar to Malaysia in two suitcases that also contained several kilos of cannabis. More recently, Wyler and Sheikh (2013: 4) refer to ‘mixes of narcotics and wildlife [that] include cases involving elephant tusks stuffed with hashish and exotic parrots smuggled with methamphetamine pills’. Another aspect of combined contraband, according to Interpol (2015: 6), is to ‘use …[illegal] timber to conceal the drugs, including in hollowed out logs’.\n\nAccording to interviewees in Myanmar (Burma) and Laos, a recent trend of combined contraband is pangolin scales smuggled together with methamphetamine into China.Footnote 4 One important wildlife trader near the town of Kengtung described the criminal infrastructure used to get wildlife into Mong La and then smuggle it across the border to Daluo in China as also providing opportunities for drugs smuggling. He explained that sometimes methamphetamine is hidden inside pangolins which not only increases the profit, but also makes being stopped for drug checks less likely along the way. An interviewed undercover agent in Bangkok echoed this, recalling an investigation that involved a car used for methamphetamine-smuggling across the Thailand-Laos border also being used for smuggling pangolins.\n\nSimilarly, interviewees in Darién, a remote, road-less swath of jungle on the border of Panama and Colombia, confirmed that cocaine is hidden inside illegal timber and the same logistics are used for reasons of convenience; the contraband is transferred by river to the first villages with access to the road. Once they reach a small Panamanian town, Yaviza, where timber permits can be ‘obtained’, the illegal timber is effectively ‘laundered’ and becomes ‘legitimate’. Then, both the (formerly illegal) timber and the cocaine can pass control points, showing the legitimate paperwork for timber along the way. This illustrates how different operators in legal and illegal markets can cooperate for mutual benefit from facilitating the movement of combined contraband.\n\nCamouflage\n\nFurther evidence of the interface between legal and illegal markets comes from instances of legal wildlife being used to smuggle illegal drugs. In such cases, smugglers may use their legitimate infrastructure to camouflage contraband by mixing it with legitimate goods (Block and Chambliss 1981). Different methods of such camouflage, now well known, can be employed at different stages of the processes of cultivation, production, capture or collection and many narcotics groups have used legal wildlife as a cover in the cocaine trade. For example, legal timber has been used to camouflage the transport of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine (Devlin 2016) and cocaine has also been hidden in doubled-up bags of hundreds of tropical fish (BBC 2012). In the latter case, the offenders placed a small plastic bag with dissolved cocaine within a larger bag full of tropical fish and water (BBC 2012). Thousands of fish were killed during a trial run without the cocaine, where the fish were left to suffocate and thousands more fish were killed whilst smuggling the cocaine. This case highlights the harm to non-human animals prevalent in trade and trafficking. There are also documented instances of parrots, sharks and boa constructors being filled with cocaine, which depending upon the species, may be legally traded. Sina et al. (2016: 33) add,\n\n‘In some cases, snakes, alligators and reptiles are not being used as commodities in themselves but simply as a form of concealment. In such cases, therefore, the animals are regarded not as an additional source of profit but as a means of ensuring that the drugs themselves are not seized and provide the profits envisaged’.\n\nStudy participants referred only incidentally to the camouflage method of using wildlife to hide drugs, and it was not mentioned as a common method. Perhaps this is due to the sample of respondents in the study; many interviewees were involved with high-value wildlife such as tiger, elephant and rhino products, which are trafficked rather than legally traded. However, interviewees did provide some examples and notably, an expert from Interpol and a representative of an environmental NGO in Bangkok, both highlighted that legitimate trade in animals or animal products could be used to hide drugs and distract customs officials. There are a number of cases where legal trading has indeed been used as a cover in Thailand (van Uhm and Nijman 2020). More often it happens that timber is being used as a cover for drugs, as explained by participants in Acandí and Turbo in Colombia. Both illegally and legally harvested tropical timber has been used to smuggle cocaine hidden in the logs across the borders to avoid inspections.\n\nA wildlife crime expert in Laos explained that dangerous ‘wild’ animals are also employed to protect stores of drugs as a means of discouraging discovery by officials. For example, in the 1990s, there were several cases of drugs being trafficked together with dangerous snakes to confuse sniffer dogs and scare customs officials (Chiszar et al., 1992). A participant from TRAFFIC North America reported: ‘you have cases where there are drugs hidden in false compartments within crates containing live venomous snakes and written on top it says: “Venomous snakes. Don’t open!”’\n\nMultiple trade lines\n\nIn addition to combining and camouflaging shipments, crime groups can run multiple trade lines simultaneously. A study by RUSI (2019), based on datasets from different law enforcement departments of one East African country, showed the significance of such examples of convergence: ‘[I]n nearly a hundred contact points just in the wildlife data, we found convergence of about 3/4 with the narcotics sector (…) The networks are moving everything’. For example, in 2018, members of a drug running organization from Kenya pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges, including the trade of large quantities of heroin and methamphetamine.Footnote 5 They were also linked to around 30 tons of ivory seizures. In a recent indictment in 2019, members of another African criminal enterprise were charged with large-scale trafficking of rhino horns and elephant ivory valued at more than $7 million, plus heroin distribution and money laundering. ‘The suspected criminal masterminds not only conspired to traffic huge amounts of heroin to New York, but also directed a multimillion-dollar poaching scheme to traffic in rhinoceros horns and elephant ivory’.Footnote 6 In Europe, as a result of investigations into Vietnamese crime groups, the on-going Operation Osseus in the Czech republic, has revealed multiple illegal trade lines, involving movement of synthetic drugs (methamphetamine etc.), tiger bones, ivory and rhino horn from Africa.Footnote 7 According to Nožina (2020 and in Shelley and Kinnard 2018: 126) ‘[r]hino horn shipped through the Czech Republic converges with many other forms of crime including illicit trade in consumer goods, methamphetamines, and marijuana’.\n\nIn line with the investigations above, interviewees in Myanmar (Burma) explained how rich Burmese methamphetamine lords in the town of Kengtung in East Shan State, known for its opium cultivation and methamphetamine production, became involved in multiple trade lines. Besides sales of methamphetamine, they pursue profitable additional sidelines in tiger skins and bones for tiger-bone wines. Since tiger skins and wines are highly profitable and worth around $8000–9000 per skin and up to $1000 per wine bottle respectively on the local market, the investment required to enter this trade is only available for a few: the rich layers of Kengtung, who often have well-established relationships with local governmental officials. This shows that the trade in valuable wildlife products in such local political economies can be linked to money previously earned through other illegal businesses, which in Shan State in Myanmar is related to the historical and socioeconomic importance of drug trafficking.\n\nAs observed by the first author, another example is the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Laos where high-value wildlife contraband such as tiger-bone wine, casques of helmet hornbills and rhino horns are being sold openly alongside drugs, including yaba (a synthetic drug based on methamphetamine and caffeine). In particular, the Kings Romans Casino is a noteworthy market venue, where rhino horns feature among many other illegal goods. In 2018, the United States Department of Treasury (USDT) placed the Kings Romans Casino on its organised crime sanctions blacklist, calling it a transnational criminal organisation engaged in child prostitution, and human, drug and wildlife trafficking. Interviewees, including two employees of the Kings Romans Casino, explained that the organisation stores and distributes both methamphetamine and illegal wildlife products, including tiger bone wines and rhino horns. Large consignments of methamphetamine seized in Thailand, and illegal wildlife trade from neighbouring countries as well as Africa, have been traced back to Kings Romans (van Uhm and Wong 2021). According to illegal wildlife traders in the SEZ, the owner of the casino not only collaborates with local officials, but he also has agreements about the trade; for example, about percentages of profit paid to officials, what wildlife or drugs are offered for sale in the casino and when governmental inspections will take place. This reflects the social and power dynamics between the multifaceted criminal groups, the wildlife and drug traders and the government officials.\n\nFurthermore, Wagner et al. (2020) found in Mexico that the drug cartels in the state of Chihuahua run illegal logging operations. The illegal timber is laundered into the legal supply chain entering the US. Similarly, according to an interview with a governmental official from Jakarta, a convicted Indonesian drug lord was linked to a pangolin trafficking network over a five-year period. The investigation showed a financial flow of around $6 million from convicted drug dealers. The crime group used company accounts to co-mingle revenue from a legal fishing company, and illegal proceeds from pangolin and drug trafficking. This illustrates how illegal profits from one crime (drug trafficking) are used to support further illegality (wildlife trafficking), reflecting the creativity and flexibility to establish multiple trade lines.\n\nShared smuggling routes and transport methods\n\nCrime groups and networks are sometimes involved in profiting from sales of both drugs and wildlife and will employ the same drugs and wildlife smuggling routes and transport methods for both (Europol 2015; UNEP 2016). Already noticed in the 1990s and early 2000s, access to smuggling routes, smuggling methods or corruption established for drugs may facilitate other forms of crime (van Duyne 1995; Naylor 2005), including wildlife trafficking. For example, in 2006 US Customs discovered five tons of ivory in a sea container from Cameroon along with traces of narcotics. Officials stated that the crate had also been used to ship several different kinds of contraband, including drugs (Nelson 2020; Lichtenwald et al. 2009). The outcomes of a study by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) show that ‘criminal [drug] networks often test routes and methodologies with wildlife products before using them for higher-stakes criminal activities’ (TNRC 2020).Footnote 8 Similarly, UNODC (2016: 50) states that ‘[r]ecent seizures of ivory and rhino horn would indicate that criminal syndicates are adopting concealment methods for wildlife products that are normally associated with drug shipments’. In Europe, Europol (2011: 41) echoed that ‘the concealment methods developed for drug trafficking are now used to traffic endangered species’.\n\nIndeed, the smuggling infrastructure of trafficking may be attractive for different commodities. In Shan State, wildlife traders explained how established and successful smuggling routes between Tachileik, Mong Lin, Kengtung and Mong La are more important than the commodity itself. Such ‘routes’ (in reality a logistical operation to enable movement of goods along a chain) use a cover (like fruits or vegetables) to hide the illegal goods - whether tiger products such as bones and skins, or methamphetamine - and bribe officials or militia along the way. Similarly, smugglers of drugs from Laos via the Mekong River into Thailand were said to also be involved in smuggling pangolins along the same routes. Wildlife was then smuggled in the other direction, via Laos into Vietnam, according to a wildlife expert in Vientiane. They may smuggle whichever product for illegal gain, from wildlife to drugs, and are ‘not necessarily acting out of ideology when moving wildlife along the smuggling chain’ (Wyatt 2013: 85).\n\nAs in the Laos-Vietnam example above, an often-noted element to shared smuggling routes is that drugs may move in one direction and wildlife in the other along the same route using the same transportation. In the 1980s and 1990s, this ‘backloading’ was a serious issue in relation to birds and reptiles worth up to $80 million a year in Australia. Animal backloading was familiar to Australian wildlife officials in the following way:\n\n‘A smuggler that brings a load of drugs into Australia often prefers to make the return trip equally profitable. One way to accomplish this is to backload relatively small but rare animals that will fetch high prices in the U.S., Europe or elsewhere’ (Chiszar et al. 1992: 7).\n\nSimilarly, organised crime groups do not directly run all illegal activities, such as drug, human and wildlife smuggling, but control smuggling routes. For instance, interviewees explained how illegal entrepreneurs need to ask permission and pay tax to the Gulf Clan, known for cocaine trafficking, to cut trees and transfer timber to a transit hub via the Cacarica river in Colombia (extortion to be paid is around 15%), illustrating the role of established paid corridors (van Uhm 2020). Thus, crime groups exploit the established trade routes and modus operandi used to traffic all kinds of contraband and, consequently, ‘drugs (…) are uncovered as part of environmental crime operations’ - or the other way around (Interpol 2015: 6).\n\nBarter trade\n\nA clear manifestation of the interface between wildlife and drugs as illegal commodities appears when they are exchanged for one another. For example, in the 1990s, Colombian drug cartels would exchange drugs for endangered species resulting in cashless transfers (Kazmar 2000) and planeloads of smuggled birds from Australia were being exchanged for heroin in Bangkok, with the drugs then being exported to Australia (Cook et al. 2002). In South Africa, crime groups have reportedly provided highly-prized (but illegal) catches of abalone in exchange for methamphetamine (‘tik’) (Steinberg 2005). The relations of exchange varied from Chinese crime groups bartering methamphetamines for abalone, forging cash-free trade relationships with Cape gangs that control the local drug market, to poachers bartering abalone for drugs for resale or, alternatively, for their own consumption (Brick et al. 2014; Oakes et al. 2018). A reported leader of one of the gangs on the Cape Flats, South Africa, stated that ‘he could trade $43,000 worth of abalone for methamphetamine worth $64,000’ (Goga 2014: 4). Even where wildlife trades appear to be mono-specialist in orientation they do not ‘stand-alone’ as if separated from their socioeconomic and cultural contexts and the related or parallel, legal and illegal, trades that may be occurring.\n\nFor example, cashless transactions are very hard to trace and therefore useful to facilitate illegal trades. In the jungles of Latin America and Southeast Asia, a similar connection can be found between the illegal trade in timber and the drugs trade:\n\n‘Timber traffickers, who have built a huge logistical network for bribing officials and moving illegally harvested wood out of the country, are now working with drug traffickers to move drugs through the same trafficking routes (…) drugs are used as payment in exchange for high-value timber species that have been illegally harvested’ (Interpol 2015: 6).\n\nThis is confirmed by interviewees in Panamanian jungle villages in Darién, who explain that it is often more convenient to exchange wildlife, including timber, instead of selling them, in particular where the local economy has an abundance of wildlife and drugs, while money is scarce.\n\nLaundering drug money\n\nSeveral reports associate wildlife trafficking with money laundering (UNODC 2010; Europol 2013), but wildlife trading may also be a cover to launder illegal money from other serious crimes, such as drug offences (van Uhm 2018; Interpol 2016). One of the first major drug-wildlife crime cases in history, uncovered through Operation CobraFootnote 9, involved the head of a drug syndicate combining his cocaine trade with an exotic animal business in Miami. The animal business turned out to be a perfect cover for drug trafficking; they used codes such as ‘I need three cockatoos’, meaning three kilos of cocaine or ‘three lesser- crested cockatoos’, which meant three ounces (van Uhm 2018). The case illustrates how the syndicate used the legal wildlife enterprise to launder drug money through several investments, false loans and an offshore corporation.Footnote 10 It also demonstrates that our categories are not discrete as the syndicate also used the business to hide drug trafficking (camouflage) and wildlife trafficking (multiple trade lines). The head of the syndicate stated in an interview: ‘Back then, I sold drugs to maintain my animal habit. I got to a point where I was on the phone saying Mario’s Drugstore, specializing in marijuana, cocaine, and quaaludes. Anybody interested come and get it.’ A former employee explained: ‘Pretty much any way you would smuggle illegal drugs, they would do the same with the animals, but the penalties for that were far less than if you were busted for smuggling drugs’.Footnote 11\n\nIn another case, an agreement with an owner of a timber company provided a perfect cover to launder money from the sale of drugs. The owner of the timber company received the proceeds of the drug sales and then provided the drug dealers with legitimate cheques, which were placed into personal accounts. The illegal money was mixed with legitimate funds from the timber and the owner received 13% of the laundered money (AUSTRAC 2010).\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Yaviza (Panama) and Turbo (Colombia), on the outskirts of the Darién jungles, explained how profits from cocaine can be used as investments for legitimate timber companies. Some local timber entrepreneurs have become rich from coca trade in the region and in the past few years, a number of important cases in Panama have come to light. For instance, the owner of a Panamanian timber company received a percentage of profits from cocaine trafficking from his brother for laundering the proceeds via his company in Yaviza. On the Colombian side, an environmentalist in Triganá explained how illegal drug money from members of the notorious Gulf clan was laundered through legitimate timber and gold companies. The embeddedness of cocaine in the region meant that it was inevitable that some of the timber investments originated from the illegal drug trade and were the result of planned money laundering."
