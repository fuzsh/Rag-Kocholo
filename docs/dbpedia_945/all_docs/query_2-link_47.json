        "text": "Top 10 universities in the UK 2024\n\nScroll down for the full list of best universities in the UK\n\nWhich are the top universities in the UK? If you want to study in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, which universities should you consider?\n\nThis league table reveals the best UK universities and colleges, according to the trusted Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024.\n\nThe University of Oxford takes the first place position, with the University of Cambridge following in second place, while two of London’s best universities and a Scottish university complete the top five.\n\nEverything you need to know about studying in the UK\n\nEverything international students need to know about UK student visas\n\nBest universities in Scotland\n\nGraduate employability: top universities in the UK ranked by employers\n\nApply to UK universities through Ucas as an international student\n\nThe cost of studying at a university in the UK\n\nBest universities in England\n\nScholarships available in the UK for international students\n\nThree universities in Scotland appear in the top 25 – the University of Edinburgh, the University of Glasgow and the University of St Andrews – while Cardiff University is the top-ranked Welsh university, sitting in 24th place.\n\nFor students looking to study in Northern Ireland, the best university in the ranking is Queen’s University Belfast.\n\nOf the top universities in the UK, about 20 are in London, including well-known institutions such as Imperial College London and King’s College London.\n\nA guide to student funding in the UK for international students\n\nA guide to the NHS for international students in the UK\n\nWhere did UK royals go to university?\n\nA day in the life of a university student in the UK\n\nTop 5 universities in the UK\n\n5. University of Edinburgh\n\nFounded in 1583, the University of Edinburgh is the sixth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Britain and Ireland’s seven ancient universities.\n\nIt is made up of three colleges: arts, humanities and social sciences; science and engineering; and medicine and veterinary medicine. Within these colleges are 20 academic schools.\n\nA range of student clubs and societies is on offer, including a music society, a theatre society and a variety of sports teams including football, rowing, judo and rugby.\n\nThe student newspaper, The Student, is one of the oldest student newspapers in the UK. It was founded by the author Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\n4. UCL\n\nUCL’s main campus is in the central London area of Bloomsbury. Nearly half of all UCL students are from outside the UK, with significantly more from Asia than from continental Europe.\n\nUCL was the first university in England to admit students irrespective of class, race or religion, and the first to admit women on equal terms with men, following the educational philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, the university’s “spiritual founder”.\n\nFor admission, undergraduate students are required to have achieved top grades in their high school exams. The most competitive degree is the BSc in philosophy, politics and economics, which receives 30 applicants for every place.\n\nFamous alumni include Mahatma Gandhi; Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone; and Coldplay’s Chris Martin, who met the other members of his band at the university.\n\n3. Imperial College London\n\nImperial’s main campus is near Kensington Palace in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, with other campuses around the city. The student cohort is extremely international and is made up of more than 125 nationalities.\n\nImperial College London is consistently ranked among the best universities in the world for science, technology, engineering, medicine and business.\n\nIt was formed in 1907 from a merger of three colleges in London and now has 17,000 students and 8,000 staff.\n\nIn addition to top scientists, Fields medallists and Nobel prizewinners, Imperial also produces influential government advisers and policymakers. Many graduates go on to achieve breakthrough innovations in industry and business, and are highly sought after by blue-chip companies and start-ups.\n\nThe author H. G. Wells and Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, are among Imperial’s famous alumni.\n\nTen things every international student in London should know\n\n2. University of Cambridge\n\nIn total, 117 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Cambridge, and Cambridge-linked mathematicians have won 11 Fields medals. Notable alumni include actors, athletes, politicians, royals and cultural figures, including biologist Charles Darwin, broadcaster David Attenborough, conservationist Jane Goodall and actress Olivia Colman.\n\nLike Oxford, the University of Cambridge is fundamentally collegiate and is also one of the world’s oldest and most prestigious universities. The town is just an hour from London.\n\nThe university is home to more than 19,000 students and 9,000 staff. There are 31 colleges, some of which date back to the 13th century, and more than 100 academic departments.\n\nCambridge is particularly renowned for excellence in mathematics and has educated some of the most famous British scientists.\n\nUndergraduates are taught via lectures and supervisions – intimate tutorials with only a couple of other students at most. The workload is heavy but terms are shorter than at many other UK universities.\n\nCambridge libraries are home to extensive collections of medieval manuscripts, and the university museums display collections of archaeological artefacts and zoological specimens.\n\nOxbridge and the Ivy League: tips for applications\n\n1. University of Oxford\n\nMore than 30 world leaders, 27 British prime ministers, 50 Nobelists and 120 Olympic medallists were educated at Oxford. Stephen Hawking, Hugh Grant and Indira Gandhi are some of its famous graduates.\n\nUndergraduates and postgraduates belong to one of its 44 colleges and often live in the college building or college-owned accommodation.\n\nOne of the world’s oldest and most prestigious universities, the University of Oxford attracts top scholars and students. Entry standards are high and admission is competitive; on average, the institution receives five applications for each available place.\n\nSocial life and recreational activities – such as rowing, cultural events and societies – also revolve around the college. Undergraduates are taught almost exclusively by tutors in their college, while postgraduate students are primarily served academically by a centralised faculty.\n\nThere are more than 100 libraries at Oxford, the most famous of which is the Bodleian, built in 1602. The city also has a number of museums, including the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, which houses the remains of a dodo, and the Museum of the History of Science, which displays a blackboard used by Albert Einstein.\n\nBest universities in Europe\n\nCompare top Canadian universities\n\nTop universities in South America\n\nBest universities in Asia\n\nBest universities in Africa\n\nBest universities in Australia\n\nBest universities in the United States\n\nBest universities in the UK 2024\n\nClick each institution to view its full World University Rankings 2024 profile"
