        "text": "The Laurence Sterne Trust and artist-publishers information as material were proud to announce a major exhibition of ‘conceptual writing’, drawn from a collection of work by internationally renowned artists and writers that includes Kathy Acker, Ed Ruscha, Jen Bervin, Christian Bok, Pavel Buchler, Craig Dworkin, Kenneth Goldsmith, On Kawara, Sherrie Levine, Klaus Scherubel and James Joyce, to be held at Shandy Hall, Coxwold, North Yorkshire between 4 September and 31 October 2010.\n\nConceived and curated by artist, teacher and founding editor of information as material, Dr Simon Morris, (now Professor Simon Morris) the exhibition was the first of its kind in the UK, and showed works by a generation of artists who have sought a radical reconsideration of the relationship between literature and the visual arts.\n\nUnfolding around Craig Dworkin’s book collection of 2,427 titles, many of them pricelessly rare objects, displayed on invisible bookshelves designed by Canadian architect Michael Farion, the exhibition included:\n\n– A ‘Bibliography of Ugly Cousins’, for which Simon Morris has drawn together critical examples of appropriated writing, or ‘rip-off’ that expose the parasitic relationship between conceptual writing and writers, and their histories;\n\n– A collection of carbonised books contributed by artist and collector Greville Worthington, entitled ‘The Black Library’, from the remains of which vegetables are to be grown for consumption in the Shandy Hall Library;\n\n– A sonic library curated by poet Kenneth Goldsmith, founder of UbuWeb, the world’s largest online archive of visual, concrete and sound poetry. UbuWeb Radio will be streamed live for the duration of the show;\n\n– ‘Bouvard et Picuchet’s Invented Desk for Copying’ by the young Canadian artist Gareth Long who, working with furniture maker and designer Wilf Williams, will present the copying desk as the latest in his series of sculptures pulled from the unfinished pages of Gustave Flaubert’s last novel.\n\nThanks to the generous support of Arts Council England, a free bus service ran from York train station to the Shandy Hall site on 27 and 28 October 2010.\n\nA Perverse Library was co-organised by information as material, The Laurence Sterne Trust and In a Word. The exhibition was made possible thanks to the generous support of The Henry Moore Foundation, York College and Arts Council England through their Grants for the Arts programme.\n\nScott Myles: The Last Full Stop (2006)\n\nScott Myles lives and works in Glasgow. Recent solo exhibitions include Search and Research, Projects in Art and Theory, Cologne (2009); STABILA, Meyer Riegger, Karlsruhe (2008); ASKIT, The Modern Institute, Glasgow (2007); Grey Matter, Galleria Sonia Rosso, Turin (2006) and Kunsthalle Z’rich, Z’rich (2005).\n\nPress:\n\nThe Guardian listings review Sat 16 Oct 2010 – The Perverse Library\n\nStaged at Shandy Hall, the former home of the 18th-century writer Laurence Sterne, an exhibition of contemporary and modern-day image and text works paying homage to Sterne’s experimental creativity. The work is vast in range and appropriately wild in spirit, like Greville Worthington’s Black Library, charred remains of carbonised books intended as the soil for growing vegetables to be served in the library. Other renowned names involved hint at the show’s range of inspired lunacy, and include Kathy Acker, Antonin Artaud and George Bataille.\n\nShandy Hall, Coxwold, to 30 Oct\n\nThe Independent – article 28/9/10 Arts and Entertainment section, article by David Lister entitled Trouble at Mall mentions The Perverse Library:\n\n“The avant-garde, like nostalgia, is not what it was. But it certainly exists. It is just to be found in locations that we might not expect…”\n\nThe Perverse Library featured in an article by Hannah Duguid in the Independent (4/10/10)\n\nShandy Hall featured in the Independent’s 50 best Museums and Galleries. (23/10/10)\n\nA selection of wood engravings by the artist Colin See-Paynton RCA RE SWE .\n\nThe new edition of the book ‘Of a Feather’ is limited to just 750 copies and copies signed by Colin See-Paynton was available for sale\n\nColin See-Paynton is a Fellow of the Royal Cambrian Academy, Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers and a member of the Society of Wood Engravers. He is widely regarded as the leading exponent of wood engraving in the United Kingdom and his work is represented in many private and public collections around the world including the V & A, Ashmolean Museum, Berlin Graphothek, Fremantle Museum & Art Gallery, Australia, Gaudi Salon, Barcelona, National Library of Wales, National Museum of Wales and the Yosemite Wildlife Museum, California.\n\nHe has travelled with the Artists for Nature Foundation to the Pyrenees and to Alaska to record and highlight through his art the threat to wildlife caused by man’s exploitation of the natural resources of these areas.\n\nColin See-Paynton exhibits widely and his publications include ‘Incisive Eye’ a catalogue raisonne of his work 1980-1996 published by Scolar press, ‘Air and Water’ being his complete collection of fish and fowl engravings 1984-2004, and his new limted edition book ‘Of a Feather’ an alphabet of avian collective nouns written, researched and illustrated with over 60 wood engravings by Colin See-Paynton and with a foreword by Sir David Attenborough.\n\n‘Colin See-Paynton has introduced yet another vision to the rich tradition of wood engraving. His delight in the lines of a bird so elegantly inscribed by the cut of his graver, his skill in varying texture even though he only has black and white with which to do so, his palpable pleasure in composing his subjects into joyous designs have brought something new to the portrayal of birds.’\n\nSir David Attenborough\n\n‘An Admiration’that should be the collective noun for gallery visitors to Colin See-Paynton’s Of a Feather exhibition, for this has been an extraordinary enterprise. The work has drawn on many years of patient and exultant observation, the accumulation of knowledge that allows the imagination to be accurate in the mind’s eye. Not since Thomas Bewick (1753-1828) have both literary and pictorial aspects been found conjoined in the one talent as in this project, where Colin See-Paynton has both written about and made the plates for an illustrated lexicon of the collective nouns for birds.’\n\nDavid Alston, Arts Director, Arts Council Wales\n\n‘Colin See-Paynton not only inherits the skills and vision of earlier artists’, (Thomas Bewick, Charles Tunnicliffe, Gertrude Hermes), but adds the brilliance of his design and his mastery of the movement of birds, animals and fish. It may be that it is difficult for a wood engraver, because of the discipline of his art, to achieve an element of the aesthetic, but when he does so, he produces an object of rare beauty, and many engravings by Colin See-Paynton are very beautiful indeed.’\n\nSir Kyffin Williams\n\nInformation about Colin See-Paynton and his new book Of a Feather. (< 1 MB)\n\nPatrick Hughes was born in Birmingham, England, in October 1939. His first exhibition was in 1961 and his first reverspective was made in 1964. He has been exhibiting with Angela Flowers Gallery since 1970. He has written and collated three books on visual and verbal rhetoric. Hughes’ work is full of irony. By creating a world solidified into perspective he makes pictures that come alive before our eyes… It is sculpted painting, solid space.\n\nHughes’ pictures are sculptural paintings. It is as if Hughes had the possibility to pull the vanishing points towards us from the flat painting that he is implying, such as a Rothko retrospective, or a Canaletto. In front of a Hughes the viewer is always uncertain, as the smallest movement she makes causes the picture to move in the opposite direction. Hughes’ art declares that wherever you stand it will always be relative to the rest of the world, and that there is no constant but flux.\n\nMurray McDonald, October 2005\n\nWhen asked the question ‘How did you start in art? Patrick Hughes replied: ‘When I was nineteen I went to a training college to learn to be a teacher, specialising in English. We were asked to write about our six favourite authors, mine were Eugene Ionesco, Laurence Steme, Franz Kafka, Lewis Carroll, Samuel Butler, N.F Simpson. They said their idea of Eng.Lit was the Brontes, Thomas Hardy and George Eliot, so I should take the art option. A visit to the British Library, St. Pancras is always a treat. Colin St John Wilson’s building is enhanced by art-works by contemporary artists and one of the pieces on the lower floor near the cloakroom causes a stir every time it is seen – Paradoxymoron by Patrick Hughes. I’ve marched friends through the doors, down the stairs to the cloakroom and then put them in front of it to watch their faces shine with delight and amazement as painted library shelves move and shift in perspective. Pure visual magic.\n\nWhat a joy, therefore, to discover at Shandy Hall a note written from Patrick to Kenneth Monkman in the late 1960’s saying how much he admired Laurence Sterne and wishing success to the restoration of Shandy Hall\n\nMurray McDonald writes on Hughes: ‘Self-reference is one of the causes of paradox, like the notice which says, ‘Please Ignore this Notice’. The reverspectives of Patrick Hughes refer to themselves because they are made in the way we see and then we see them. Feedback is caused. The artist’s favourite section of Tristram Shandy is Volume 6 Chapters XXXVI – XL -‘… good for students, I feel. ‘Graphic Arts & Design students at the University of Teesside have been invited to respond to these chapters which focus on ‘Uncle Toby’s amours’ using multimedia, motion-graphics and book arts to create new works. Their contributions will be included in the exhibition ‘A Perspective Backwards’.\n\nA new edition of ‘Patrick Hughes Perverspective’ by John Slyce was published to coincide with the recent exhibition ‘Permanentspective’ at Flowers East.\n\nMore information about Patrick Hughes\n\nPatrick Caulfield, The British Library and Tristram Shandy including works by John Hoyland, Tom Phillips, Martin Rowson, Anthony Whishaw and students from the University of Teesside.\n\nThe Old Granary Gallery, Shandy Hall, May 6th to June 24th 2005\n\nThe centrepiece of this exhibition was the design for a tapestry. It was conceived by the artist Patrick Caulfield for the British Library, St.Pancras, but had not yet been realised. We were proud to exhibit the design for the first time, along with a sample of the tapestry created for this exhibition by the Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh, at the instigation of the architect of the British Library, Sir Colin St John Wilson.\n\nThe landing on the British Library steps, where the finished tapestry would finally hang, was recreated in the Shandy Hall gallery, by John Oldham Woodworking.\n\nPatrick Caulfield chose to illustrate Volume 4 chapters 8 – 12 of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy and intended the tapestry to hang on the ‘Shandy Hall Landing’ in the Conference Centre. A generous sponsor has been found and it was learned, just before this exhibition opened, that the whole tapestry is now being woven.\n\nThe subject is a comic episode in which Walter and Toby Shandy, engrossed in conversation on their way down a flight of stairs, pause for a considerable time on the landing. Walter several times extends his foot on to the next step downwards, only to withdraw it each time he warms to his next topic of conversation.\n\nSo difficult does Sterne find it to get his characters off the stairs that he eventually employs a hack writer to come into his novel to do it for him, and when later in the book a conversation again ensues on a staircase, Sterne has to reassure the reader: ‘Do not be terrified, Madam, this staircase conversation is not so long as the last.’ (Chapter 30)\n\nThe episode begins with a Chapter of chances – how do we equip ourselves to deal with the many misfortunes that chance throws at us? Toby suggests religion. Walter thinks we can counterbalance evil with good, and that by naming his son Trismegistus, (“Thrice great”) he will arm him against further troubles.\n\n“WE shall bring all things to rights, said my father, setting his foot upon the first step from the landing — This Trismegistus, continued my father, drawing his leg back, and turning to my uncle Toby — was the greatest (Toby) of all earthly beings – ”\n\nTristram, poor boy, instead of being thrice great, suffers three crushing blows: one with the squashing of his nose by Dr Slop’s forceps; another by his being misnamed Tristram and a third with the unfortunate premature closing of the sash window.\n\nThe pause on the landing – on the very stairs where stands the clock that entered Mrs Shandy’s head, with such unfortunate results, at the crucial point of Tristram’s conception – is a moment out of time in which Toby and Walter Shandy discuss chance, the misfortunes of life, and ponder how to deal with them. The episode is not just comic, but a meditation on change, chaos, and much else besides, and it gives rich scope for the artists who have taken up the challenge for this exhibition.\n\nThe clock, symbol and measure of the passing of time, has a central role in Caulfield’s tapestry. It is the clock which is depicted in the sample woven by Dovecot studios and which forms the centrepiece over the ‘landing’ at the far end of the gallery (modelled on the British Library stairs). Consciousness of the speed of passing time shows everywhere in Tristram Shandy – often with comic effect – as in this passage of the impossibility of recording a life in detail while living it at the same time:\n\n‘I am this month one whole year older than I was this time twelve-month; and having got, as you perceive, almost into the middle of my fourth volume — and no farther than to my first day’s life — ’tis demonstrative that I have three hundred and sixty-four days more life to write just now, than when I first set out ; so that instead of advancing, as a common writer, in my work with what I have been doing at it — on the contrary, I am just thrown so many volumes back– was every day of my life to be as busy a day as this — And why not ? — at this rate I should just live 364 times faster than I should write — It must follow, an’ please your worships, that the more I write, the more I shall have to write — and consequently, the more your worships read, the more your worships will have to read. Will this be good for your worships’ eyes?’\n\nUnderlying the comedy is a serious consciousness that life is short, and we must live it to the full:\n\n‘Time wastes too fast: every letter I trace tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen: the days and hours of it, more precious, my dear Jenny! than the rubies about thy neck, are flying over our heads like light clouds of a windy day, never to return more– every thing presses on–whilst thou art twisting that lock,–see! it grows grey’ Vol 4 67\n\nSterne’s ‘live the moment’ attitude springs perhaps from his knowledge that he was ill and that his life would not be long. The energy and speed of ‘Tristram Shandy’ is driven by his consciousness of having to live life to the full, with death at his heels he resolves to live life at a gallop!\n\n‘had I not better, Eugenius, fly for my life? ‘Tis my advice my dear Tristram, said Eugenius – Then by heaven! I will lead him a dance he little thinks of – …’\n\nThe ‘curious vehicle’ which is man, is constantly jolted and jostled by misfortunes, but Walter talks of the ‘secret spring within us’ which ‘sets all things to rights’. For Sterne, this secret spring is high spirits and laughter. As he writes in the dedication to Tristram Shandy:\n\n‘..it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom, and in a retir’d thatch’d house, where I live in a constant endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health, and other evils of life, by mirth; being firmly persuaded that every time a man smiles, — but much more so, when he laughs, it adds something to this Fragment of Life."
