Northumbria University Press has launched a trade-focused imprint, which will publish wide-ranging titles on areas such as photography, music, biography, art and travel.

Northumbria Press launched in September with the publication of Helen Chase’s biography of the cult band Magazine, Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen’s Byker Revisted and England My England by award-winning Magnum photographer Chris Steele-Perkins. The imprint will publish around 10-15 titles a year.

Publisher Andrew Peden Smith said: "The aim of the new imprint is to publish modern vibrant books that will appeal to a much wider audience than many academic presses currently enjoy."

He added the team was "exceptionally encouraged by its reception" so far. "We are now in the process of appointing worldwide distribution agents who saw the potential of the list – a truly international mix of biography, photography and music titles."

In February, Northumbria Press will release a "moving memoir" entitled The Tin Ring, by Zdenka Fantlová. The book tells her account of life in the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, where she used the 'tin ring' for her wedding, and was "moments away from death" before being rescued by an unknown British Army Officer.

It is hoped that the publication, which will co-inside with Holocaust Memorial Day, will help Fantlová trace the man who saved her life.

Peden Smith said: "Zdenka is an astonishing lady of indestructible will, who has written an exceptionally powerful, personal account about her life during the rise of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The importance of the book cannot be underestimated and we hope that Zdenka will indeed meet her hero."
