During the 52nd Filmfare Awards, Amitabh Bachchan had revealed the reason he wanted to marry Jaya Bachchan. The actor took the stage to present the Lifetime Achievement Award to his wife when he disclosed that he liked her "bubbly, energetic, and full of life" personality.

During his speech, Amitabh said, "She did her first film called Guddi. I was there as her leading man, momentarily. Ten days into the shooting, I was asked to leave and she continued (the movie) with someone else. Subsequently, I worked in several films with her. As my leading lady, I have to say that she has been the one heroine that I have worked with as my leading lady in the maximum number of films. She became the girl next door.. this bubbly, energetic, full of life... away from conventional leading ladies. That's when I decided I need to marry her."

He went on to praise their kids, Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan. The Don actor also added, "Every role that she has taken up has been full of conviction... I am really happy to be here, giving you a Lifetime Achievement Award. It's been a wonderful life."
