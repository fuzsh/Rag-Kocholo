        "text": "NEW DELHI:\n\nVeteran Bollywood actress and Indian Member of Parliament Jaya Bachchan has once again expressed her frustration at being addressed by her husband Amitabh Bachchan's name.\n\nAccording to Indian media reports, during a session in the Rajya Sabha, the Chairperson referred to Jaya Bachchan as \"Shrimati Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.\" In response, Jaya remarked, \"Thank you, sir. You do know what Amitabh means, right?\"\n\nIn reply, the Rajya Sabha Chairperson advised Jaya Bachchan to consider changing her name officially, suggesting that there are procedures in place to change the name on election certificates and official Rajya Sabha records, citing his own experience in 1989.\n\nJaya Bachchan responded confidently, saying, \"I take pride in my own name and also in Amitabh Bachchan. I appreciate all his achievements\".\n\nShe continued, \"But you all have started this new drama about the name. I am very happy with my name. Male members of Parliament should also consider using their wives' names alongside theirs.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Jaya Bachchan has expressed her displeasure.\n\nJust last week, she had spoken out in the Rajya Sabha against the use of her husband's name with hers, asserting her identity as an \"independent individual\"."
