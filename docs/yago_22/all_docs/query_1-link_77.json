        "text": "Veteran actresses Rekha and Jaya Bachchan used to be fast friends in the hay days and their fans love to dig up old stories about them. Several reports mention that when Rekha moved into Jaya Bachchan’s building at 18 years of age, Jaya would give her advice about her career and life. Jaya was already an established actress back then and was going to marry Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nRekha reportedly soon became good friends with Jaya and Amitabh and would also accompany them on drives around the city. Recalling their earlier days as friends, actor Mehmood’s official biography written by Hanif Zaveri reads, “Amitabh and Anwar (Mehmood’s brother) were close friends. Anwar told me that he had often taken Amitabh and Jaya on long drives. The two would sit in the front seat of the car along with him while Rekha would sit in the back seat and they would talk through the journey.’ This is also recorded in Mehmood’s official biography, Mehmood: A Man of Many Moods.”\n\nAmitabh Bachchan went on to become a global superstar and worked with several prolific actresses, including Rekha and Jaya. Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha went on to star together in several films like Mr Natwarlal, Do Anjaane and Muqaddar Ka Sikandar. Silsila was their last film together. As for Jaya and Amitabh, they were seen together in films like Zanjeer, Abhimaan, Chupke Chupke and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan had first met on the set of Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s 1971 film Guddi. They then got married on June 3, 1973, and are still going strong. Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan are parents to entrepreneur and author Shweta Bachchan and actor Abhishek Bachchan. They are also grandparents to Agstya Nanda, Navya Nanda and Aaradhya Bachchan.\n\nMeanwhile, on the film front, Jaya Bachchan was last seen in Karan Johar’s Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani alongside Dharmendra. The film featured Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt in the lead. Jaya played Ranveer’s grandmother.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan will soon be seen in the futuristic sci-fi film, Kalki 2898 AD. It also stars Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Kamal Haasan and Disha Patani in key roles. As for Rekha, she was last seen in films in 2014 in Super Nani."
