        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 19 — There are divas and then there’s Jaya Bachchan.\n\nThe veteran actress and wife of Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan once again lost her cool with paparazzi after arriving at Indore airport, Madhya Pradesh, India with her husband.\n\nA recent video of Jaya surfaced on a paparazzo’s Instagram account which shows her walking ahead of her husband at the airport, The Indian Express reported.\n\nWhile greeted by a man with a bouquet of flowers, she notices a fan video recording her.\n\nInfuriated, she said: “Please don’t take my picture. You don’t understand English?”\n\nThe person taking the video is quickly pulled away by another man who told him: “Aapko bataya tha na (I told you not to),” and Jaya is heard saying: “Aise logon ko naukri se nikaal dena chahiye (Such people should be sacked).”\n\nThe moment the video went viral, Instagram users were quick to respond.\n\nOne of them wrote, “Oh Hitler didi.” Another wrote, “Don’t give her publicity, she doesn’t deserve it.” Another comment read, “Really, she always overreacts.”\n\nDespite criticism, the 74-year-old actress remains unapologetic about being hostile to paparazzi.\n\nWhile talking to her granddaughter Navya Naveli and daughter Shweta Bachchan for a podcast, the Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham actress said she hates it when photographers interfere with her personal space."
