        "text": "NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha had some light moments on Monday with Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Amitabh Bachchan asking a poser to Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar about the meaning of the middle word in her official name and then suggesting that Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is unmarried, add “name of his wife” to his name.\n\nThe light-hearted sparring has its origins to Jaya Bachchan’s remarks on July 29 when she raised some objections after Deputy Chairman Harivansh took her name as per official records. She said, “this something new that women will be recognized by the name of their husbands”.\n\nOn Monday, Chairman Dhankhar asked the Samajwadi Party MP to ask her supplementary during question hour from Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and took her name as per official records.\n\n“Sir, aapko Amitabh ka matlab pata hai na (Sir, do you know the meaning of Amitabh)?” she asked.\n\nDhankhar, who had earlier explained the procedure for a member to change his or her name, made similar remarks.\n\n“Ma’am aap badal dijiye, main badalwa dunga (Ma’am, you change it, I will get it changed)…there is a procedure to change the name that you have submitted for your election certificate. I made use of the provision myself in 1989, and it is available for all the members. Please change it officially then,” he said.\n\nThe ‘Sholay’ actor, however, said that she was proud of her husband Amitabh Bachchan’s achievements.\n\n“No sir, I am very proud, I am very of my name and my husband and his achievements. It signifies abha jo mit nahi sakti..,don’t worry, this drama you have started new, this was not there earlier,” she said.\n\nAt this, Dhankhar talked about his visit to a hotel in France years back and said that Amitabh Bachchan’s photograph was among the global icons.\n\n“I certify that the entire nation is proud…,” Dhankhar said.\n\nAs Jaya Bachchan got up to ask her supplementary from Khattar, she said “Sir, put his wife’s name in front of his name”.\n\nDhankhar quipped that he sometimes refers to himself as “Sudeshpati”, noting that his wife’s name is Mrs Sudesh.\n\nReferring to his unmarried status, Manohar Lal Khattar said that he cannot fulfil what Jaya Bachchan is saying in this life.\n\n“For this, there will be a need to wait for the next life,” he quipped.\n\nAmid smiles in the House, Dhankhar said that the House has an Assurance Committee and Khattar has given an assurance.\n\n“You have put yourself in the ambit of parliamentary tradition in your next life also,” he said.\n\nAs members smiled, Khattar answered the supplementary raised by Jaya Bachchan.\n\nIn her remarks on July 29 when Harivansh took her name as Jaya Bachchan, the former actor seemingly took exception.\n\n“This is something new, that women will be recognized by the name of their husbands like they have no existence or achievements of their own,” she said.\n\nJaya Bachchan, who has been an influential figure in both cinema and politics, married megastar Amitabh Bachchan on June 3, 1973. The couple has two children, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan.\n\nThe couple has acted in several films together, including ‘Zanjeer’, ‘Sholay’, ‘Abhimaan’, ‘Mili’, ‘Chupke Chupke’, ‘Silsila’, and ‘Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham’.\n\nSince entering politics in 2004, she has been a vocal advocate for women’s rights and various social issues.
