        "text": "Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and Rekha are three names who were the most famous faces of the industry in the 70s-80s. The three have worked together in many films. The pairing of Rekha and Amitabh Bachchan was much loved onscreen. It is also said that the two used to date each other offscreen i.e. in real life as well. There were talks of denting between the two. However, Amitabh Bachchan married Jaya Bachchan in the year 1973.\n\nAfter marriage, Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha worked together in the film ‘Silsila’ in 1981. Jaya Bachchan was also in this film. But after ‘Silsila’, Amitabh and Rekha have not been seen together in any film. Even years after the release of the film, Amitabh and Rekha have never shared the screen. Jaya Bachchan was once asked if Rekha and Amitabh Bachchan will face any kind of problem if they work together again.\n\nRekha-Amitabh films\n\nJaya Bachchan answered this. In an interview in 2008, he said why he had a problem. Jaya said, “No, why do I have a problem? But I think it will be more of a sensation than an actual act and it’s a pity because one will miss the chance to see them together. “They’ll both probably realize this will take care of the job.” However, it is said that due to the relationship between Rekha and Amitabh, the two did not do films together after this. Earlier, Rekha and Amitabh Bachchan had worked together in many films like ‘Namak Haram’, ‘Do Anjaane’, ‘Khoon Pasina’, ‘Mukaddar Ka Sikandar’, ‘Mr Natwarlal’ and ‘Suhaag’.\n\nIt’s been 51 years\n\nNow Amitabh and Jaya have been married for 51 years. Both have two children, Abhishek Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan. Recently he shared a photo with Jaya Bachchan. In this he is seen standing with an umbrella and Jaya Bachchan is sitting holding a plate of ladoo in her hand. He also captioned it, “T-5074 and it rains everyday, even on the work set.”\n\nOn the work front, Amitabh Bachchan was last seen in Prabhas starrer ‘Kalki 2898 AD’. His film was a huge hit at the box office. The audience loved both the film and Amitabh Bachchan’s acting."
