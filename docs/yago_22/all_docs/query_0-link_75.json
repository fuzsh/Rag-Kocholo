        "text": "In a dramatic turn of events in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi spearheaded a walkout by opposition parties in support of Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan. The walkout was prompted by a recurring issue involving the way Ms. Bachchan is introduced in the Upper House.\n\nEarlier this week, Jaya Bachchan, the renowned actor and politician married to Amitabh Bachchan, voiced her discontent over being introduced by Rajya Sabha Chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar as “Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.” Ms. Bachchan has repeatedly expressed her displeasure with this practice, arguing that it diminishes her individual identity.\n\nOn Monday, Ms. Bachchan had already raised concerns, stating, “Sir, only Jaya Bachchan would have sufficed,” and emphasizing her discomfort with women being identified solely by their husbands’ names. She criticized the practice as undermining women’s own identities.\n\nIn response to her complaints, Mr. Dhankhar seemed annoyed, retorting, “Don’t school me,” which further fueled the tension. Ms. Bachchan stood her ground, demanding an apology from the Chair. The situation escalated as opposition MPs, led by Sonia Gandhi, decided to walk out in protest.\n\nMs. Bachchan also accused her political opponents of creating unnecessary drama over the issue, suggesting that such incidents were a new development in political discourse.\n\nThe walkout underscores ongoing tensions within the Rajya Sabha and highlights broader issues regarding gender identity and recognition in Indian politics."
