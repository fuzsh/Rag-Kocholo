        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, held on Friday, was one of the most highly anticipated events of 2024. This star-studded affair drew numerous celebrities, including Bollywood's first family, the Bachchans, who were among the distinguished guests.\n\nThe wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant was one of the most-awaited events of 2024. The wedding, which took place on Friday, was a star-studded affair, attended by the who’s who of showbiz. Bachchans, the first family of Bollywood, was also on the illustrious guest list.\n\nHowever, Bachchan Sr made a cryptic post after the event. Taking to his blog on Sunday, he wrote about how old acquaintances may have changed physically, but the mutual affection remained unchanged. “Back from a glorious wedding and the feel after a very long time of public exposure, the wealth of love and affection that I can possibly think of with so many old acquaintances .. they seemed to have changed in their physiognomy, but extremely sincere in their affection towards the association and the love of our times well spent together,\" wrote the Bollywood veteran.\n\nBig B added, \"This is what life is all about .. the associations and love and care .. It is strange how the little things that matter to each other, remain, but those that had a deeper association or a meaningful spent time, is lost and forgotten .. well, not really forgotten, but kept on the back burner, and remembered or brought out only when there is required meaning of the association.\"\n\nOn the red carpet, Amitabh Bachchan posed with his wife, Jaya Bachchan, their son, Abhishek Bachchan, and their daughter, Shweta Bachchan. Shweta's husband, Nikhil Nanda, and their children, Navya and Agastya, also joined them. Abhishek's wife, Aishwarya Rai, and their daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan, posed separately for the paparazzi.\n\nOn Friday, Anant Ambani, the younger scion of the Reliance Industries exchanged vows with his fiancee Radhika Merchant. The grand event was attended by celebrities such as the Kardashians, John Cena, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan etc. As per reports, the entire affair (including the pre-wedding celebrations) cost a whopping Rs 5,000 crore!\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
