The couple, who were dating each other back then, decided to go on a celebratory trip to London. \"I hadn't been to London and neither did Jaya. So once Zanjeer became a box office success, we thought of putting our plan into action,\" Bachchan added.\n\nHarivansh Rai Bachchan, however, had a condition for his son\n\nHowever, when Big B sought permission from (read informed) his parents for this vacation with Jaya and their friends, his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan had a condition for them. Bachchan's father told him he could go only after the two were married. \"And that's how we planned our wedding the very next day and proceeded to London,\" the 76-year-old actor was quoted as saying.\n\n\"Wedding over in a few hours. Mr and Mrs proclaimed\"\n\nSharing details about his D-Day, Bachchan wrote in his blog, \"I dress up in formal marriage Indian..get into my car and want to drive to Malabar Hill where her friends lived and where the ceremony was to be done.\" \"My driver Nagesh insists he would drive me to the wedding. Off I went. Wedding over in a few hours. Mr. and Mrs. proclaimed!!\"\n\nAmitabh, Jaya did several hit films after marriage\n\nAmitabh and Jaya were a hit jodi both off and on the screen, and they continued to spill their magic on the silver screen post their marriage. In fact, the couple shared screen space in several hits like Abhimaan, Mili, Chupke, Sholay, Silsila, etc.\n\nFor now, Bachchan is looking forward to two big releases"
