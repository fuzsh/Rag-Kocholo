The superstar on the occasion of wedding anniversary went down the memory lane and wrote why he decided to get married to Jaya Bachchan.\n\nIn his blog post, Big B revealed that how the couple, who were dating back then, had plans to go on a vacation to London with some friends and how the actor's father, poet Harivanshrai Bachchan had an issue with it.\n\n“Seeking or rather informing parents that we were a group of friends going to England .. who all are going came the query from Babuji .. names disclosed .. Jaya is also going with you .. you both are alone .. yes .. if you have to go marry and go,”the actor recalled in his blog.\n\nAmitabh and Jaya decided to tie the knot the very next day and take their flight to London the same night.\n\n“I dress up in formal marriage Indian .. get into my car and want to drive to Malabar Hill where her friends lived and where the ceremony was to be done .. my driver Nagesh, pushes me out and insist he would drive me to the wedding .. the substitute for the tradition horse... off I went .. wedding over in a few hours .. done .. Mr and Mrs proclaimed .. over !!\" he further wrote.\n\nThe couple has two children- Shweta Bachchan and actor Abhishek Bachchan. In fact, on Monday, Abhishek posted a photo of his parents as he wished them on their anniversary."
