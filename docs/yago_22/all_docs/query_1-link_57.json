        "text": "Bollywood veteran actress Jaya Bachchan had once said that she would not mind her husband, actor Amitabh Bachchan working with Rekha. Amitabh and Rekha set the screen on fire several times in the 1970s. The actors worked together in films such as Namak Haraam (1973), Do Anjane (1976), Khoon Pasina (1977), Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978), Mr Natwarlal (1979) and Suhaag (1979). However, one of their most memorable film to date remains Silsila (1981) which also starred Jaya Bachchan. Over 40 years since the film released, Amitabh and Rekha have never shared the screen since.\n\nWhile they have not opened up about the reason behind not working together anymore, the growing speculation of their relationship off-camera is often said to be the reason they stopped collaborating. Jaya, however, once had said that she would have no issues if they would work together. However, she pointed out that their collaboration would be sensationalised and will overshadow their work.\n\nAs quoted by Rediff in October 2008, in an interview with People magazine, Jaya was asked, “Would you mind if they worked together again?” The actress replied, “No, why should I mind? But I feel it will be more like a sensation than actual work. And that’s a pity because one will miss the opportunity of seeing them together. Both of them probably realise it will go beyond work.”\n\nAmitabh and Jaya have been married for 51 years now. The couple tied the knot on June 3, 1973. The couple welcomed two kids, Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan. While Shweta is married to businessman Nikhil Nanda, Abhishek is married to Aishwarya Rai.\n\nLast year, when Amitabh and Jaya celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, Abhishek penned a sweet post for them. “Adding to the list of the many Golden Jubilees to their credit…But this is by far the most special one. Happy 50th wedding anniversary Ma and Pa!” he wrote. Amitabh Bachchan replied, “Love you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rekha got married to Mukesh Aggarwal in 1990. However, he died a shortly after. The actress chose to not remarry."
