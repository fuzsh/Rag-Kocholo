        "text": "It is no secret that Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan are couple goals. In an earlier interview with Filmfare, the OG Bachchan 'bahu' revealed that she had a special nickname for her husband that did not stick for a long time.\n\nAccording to the actor, she did not continue using it for her daughter. Jaya Bachchan noted that she used to call Amitabh Bachchan \"Lambuji\" on the initial days of their companionship. However, she stopped doing so when their daughter Shweta Bachchan started imitating her. \"I used to call him Lambuji till Shweta started calling him by that name too. I realised it was time to stop,\" she stated.\n\nJaya Bachchan also elaborated on Amitabh Bachchan's household responsibilities. When their kids were little, Jaya Bachchan noted that Amitabh Bachchan would take up responsibilities on the weekend. \"After Shweta was born, we had a maid to help during the day but at night we’d do everything ourselves. In fact, on Sundays Amit would take over. He’d even bathe her,\" she mentioned. The couple has been married for 50 years. They are on the verge of entering their 51st year of marriage on June 3rd this year."
