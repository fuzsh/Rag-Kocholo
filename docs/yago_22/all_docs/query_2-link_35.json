        "text": "To everyone's shock, Jaya could be seen speaking to the reporter and saying,\n\n\"serves you well.\"\n\nNot just that, she said,\n\n“I hope you double and fall.”\n\n“Aap log kaun hain? Aap log media se hain? Kaunsi media se hain (Who are you. Which media house do you belong to)?”\n\nLater when the people introduced themselves as the 'paparazzi’, she walked away towards the gate of the venue.\n\nThere was a big outcry following the event with many criticizing her.\n\nNow, she's explained her comments.\n\nWhile speaking with granddaughter Navya on the latest episode Limelight & Lemons on her podcast, she said that she doesn't like people who interfere in her personal life.\n\n\"I hate it. I despise it. I despise the people who interfere in your personal life and fill their stomachs by selling those products. I hate it, I'm disgusted with such people. I always tell them, I say, ‘Aapko sharam nahi aati hai (Don’t you feel ashamed?)'.\"\n\n\"I feel very strongly and it's not that it's today, I felt it from the day one. I don't mind if you talk about my work. You say, ‘She's a bad actor and she has done this film badly, she's not looking nice', because it's a visual media, don't mind. But the rest I do mind. Because people who see they see it for a second and then move on. They're onto something else.\" said Jaya.\n\nShe also addressed trolls, saying,\n\n\"If people are going to earn their living by putting all my angry speeches on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter, I give a damn. I don't give a damn. You have opinion about them personally, you have opinion about the work they do, I understand. You criticise it, you cut it into pieces I accept. You can say, 'She is a bad actor, a bad parliamentarian' but you have no business sitting on judgment of my personal character. 'She only knows how to get angry'. Angry about what? You're intruding, interfering in my personal life when I'm walking somewhere, you're taking my picture. Why? Am I not a human being?\"\n\n\"What they take and what they put out are two different things. So you have the freedom to do it, what about my freedom?\"\n\n\"I know some people make a comment so that they know there will be a reaction, then there will be a discussion, then there will be a tu-tu-main-main (argument). So there are some celebrities who thrive on such things.\"\n\nSource: Hindustan Times"
