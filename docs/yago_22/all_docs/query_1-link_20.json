        "text": "Originally posted by: Life_Is_Dutiful\n\nI know the social media dislikes Jaya for being grumpy, rude, angry all the time and who doesn't do makeup and botox to hide her look but somewhere I do feel sorry for living in an unhappy marriage. I had read that when Amitabh was indulging in EMA with Rekha she wanted to divorce him but couldn't because her FIL didn't let her do that saying divorce is not their family sanskaar. ðŸ˜  Probably her personal problems made her a totally bitter person.\n\nOriginally posted by: piya2025\n\nUnfortunately, social media won't understand any of it because they are simply not in her shoe. So, they will have 100x reasons to preach what she should have done if she were really unhappy or find 1000x more reason to say it was her wish so it's only her to blame & definitely, not that man who is responsible why all went wrong in the 1st place or the other woman, who till very date doesn't let a chance slip to act notoriously.\n\nIt's easy to call someone bitter & poke fun until one has to walk in their shoe.\n\nOriginally posted by: Life_Is_Dutiful\n\nJaya has become a butt of jokes all over internet. Just because she's rude to the media who anyway likes to ask idiotic questions to celebs people actually think it's her fault that her husband cheated on her. People call her a third wheel in her own marriage, defend her cheater husband and feel sorry for the other woman. She being rude to the media and her husband cheating on her are two totally different things. As you said, jispar guzarti hai ussi ko pata hai. She was part of that era where divorce was considered a taboo. Waise, there are still lot of rich celebs from her next generations who don't divorce their philandering husbands and pretend to be happily married wives in front of media. ðŸ˜† At least she's not faking anything."
