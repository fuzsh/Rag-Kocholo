        "text": "Jaya Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan go beyond being just husband and wife. On the finale episode of season 2 of the podcast, What The Hell Navya, the three generations of the Bachchan-Nanda family spoke about friendships and relationships.\n\nJaya told Navya about her friends both in and outside the industry, giving a special mention to Amitabh Bachchan who she said topped her list of best friends.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan is my best friend: Jaya\n\nWhen asked who her best friend was, Jaya Bachchan revealed that it was Amitabh. She said, “My husband is my best friend, I don’t hide anything from him. I believe every relationship should be based on honesty. You shouldn’t be afraid to put forth your opinion, even if they differ from your friend’s. I also consider Navya one of my friends, even if she can’t share everything with me.”\n\nJaya also added that there should still be friends outside the family because it’s important to have a support system outside the family. She said, “I have friends made in college who aren’t from the film industry. They’re my support system.”\n\nAlso read: Kill teaser: Karan Johar, Guneet Monga back the most gory film of the year\n\nNavya then pointed out that she and Agastya would find it funny to see her talk to her friends, who often pull her leg, something no one in the family can do. Jaya responded, “It’s nice to have friends who keep you grounded. I also like making friends with ADs on sets, just to pull their legs.”\n\nIs Gen Z not loyal to friendships?\n\nIn the same conversation, Navya’s mother Shweta suggested the gap between generations and added that Gen Z wasn’t loyal when it came to friendships. She said, “You make friends faster and lose them too, you don’t want to accommodate. I also don’t understand the concept of parents being friends, parents are parents. There need to be boundaries.”\n\nNavya however had a different take on why there was a different need for different friends at different stages of life, “When I was in school, I just wanted to be friends with the cool kids, it’s different now. Now I want to be friends with those who have the same ambition as me. I used to want to be friends with anyone. Now, I want friends who push me.”"
