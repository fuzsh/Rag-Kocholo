        "text": "Mumbai: It’s been 40 years since Amitabh Bachchan married his “Zanjeer” co-star Jaya. The megastar looks back at the “lifetime” and says god has been kind to give him the family that he has.Â Amitabh and Jaya are celebrating their anniversary on Monday.\n\n“40 years! 40 years of marriage on the 3rd of June 2013! Jaya and I in marriage for 40 years! A lifetime almost,” the 70-year-old posted on his blog srbachchan.tumblr.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe duo has worked together in movies like “Abhimaan”, “Chupke Chupke”, “Sholay” and “Zanjeer”. They had a small wedding affair back then with only close friends and family in attendance.\n\nIt “seems like just the other evening”, Big B posted on his blog, adding: “I had driven with my parents to a friends place on Malabar Hill, in the southern region of the city, and to a very quick, no fuss, no ’taam jhaam’, family and a few friends, and a few close media, wedding.”\n\n“A wedding that had the fulfillment of a promise, that if ‘Zanjeer’ succeeded we would get married! Here we are now, two children and three grand children, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, relatives and ‘samdhis’ in our family fold. God has been very kind,” he added.\n\nAmitabh and Jaya have two children - Shweta and Abhishek. Shweta is the elder, and is married to businessman Nikhil Nanda. She got married in 1997 and is now based in Delhi. They have two children - Agastya and Navya Naveli.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbhishek, a Bollywood actor, is married to former beauty queen-turned-actress Aishwarya Rai. They have a daughter named Aaradhya.\n\nBig B recieved several anniversary wishes online, and he took to Twitter to thank everyone.\n\n“To all those that wish us a happy anniversary&mldr; our gratitude and love and blessings and joy! Thank you,” posted the 71-year-old.\n\nAdvertisement"
