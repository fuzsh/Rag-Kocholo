        "text": "Ye Kahan Aa Gaye Hum... Yuhin Saath Chalte Chalte- Marriage is a beautiful knot that ties two people for an eternity. Not only do you get a permanent roommate for life but a person who would stand by you in all your highs and lows. Somebody, who will be eagerly waiting to come back to, somebody who would not catch the premiere of the favourite shows that you watch together and wait for you to come back. A person with whom you would want to envision kids, grandkids and leading a life of happily ever after. And speaking of celebrity jodis, legendary actors, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan get a special mention.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan were a hit pair of the 70s. They have starred in over dozens of films together and all the films turned out to be huge box office successes. Soon after their on-screen story started creating some major buzz in the industry, Amitabh and Jaya took their relationship to a whole new different level when they decided to upgrade their relationship from lovebirds to husband and wife. It was on the fortunate day of June 3, 1973, when Jaya had omitted ‘Bhaduri’ from her surname and replaced it with ‘Bachchan’.\n\nAlso Read: When Amitabh Bachchan Lost His Temper At Jaya Bachchan Post An Interview About His Affair With Rekha\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt has been over 48 years that Jaya Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan have been living their ‘happily ever after’ and only recently did we get to know an insider update about the couple. Amitabh Bachchan is currently hosting the 11th season of Kaun Banega Crorepati and it was on the very show, that the legend shared a secret. When a contestant on the show was talking about his love life, the Shahenshah of Bollywood revealed the name by which he has saved his wife, Jaya's number on his phone. Any guesses as to what would it be? Amitabh has saved Jaya's initials as her contact name, which turns out to be ‘JB’!\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: The Love Life Of Rekha: Fell In Love Multiple Times, Only To Be Single At The Age Of Sixty-Six\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn an interview with the IANS, Amitabh Bachchan had shared that all the Bachchan members love watching KBC but there is someone who ensures that she doesn’t miss it.

In one of a ‘revelation blog’, Amitabh had shared that his father, Harivansh Bachchan had told him to get married and only then he could go on a holiday with his then ladylove, Jaya! Sharing the same, Amitabh had written, “I lived on the 7th Road of this society.. on a rented house.. marriage had been decided among us... nothing to be exaggerated or celebrated with any aplomb.. just the two families and.. done.. off to London, my first trip ever and hers too... Zanjeer a success and a promise that if it did well we would all - a gang of our friends - would go on a holiday to London!
