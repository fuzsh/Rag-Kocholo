        "text": "Unquestionably Jaya Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan happen to be one of the legendary couples in the Bollywood.\n\nThe couple who entered marital bliss on June 3, 1973, clocked 51 years of togetherness on 3 June.\n\nEven as they often commanded immense respect and love, there have been times when Jaya Bachchan, known for being vocal, has fought for her husband with legends like Rajesh Khanna and Manoj Kumar.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan had featured in the Manoj Kumar produced and directed film Roti Kapda Aur Makaan released in theatres in 1974.\n\nEarly in his career Bachchan, who faced a series of flops had already delivered a hit in the Prakash Mehra produced and directed Zanjeer, went on to emerge as unstoppable and whose popularity would span over decades and generations.\n\nNotwithstanding this, Amitabh had relatively less screen time compared to Manoj Kumar,\n\nwho essayed the character of Bharat, while the former essayed the role of his brother Vijay.\n\nOnce Jaya had predicted that a time will come when Amitabh Bachchan will rule Bollywood and it turned true. Amitabh Bachchan rose to become the legend of Hindi Cinema and he is the only actor as of today endorsing maximum commercials.\n\nNews Edit K.V.Raman"
