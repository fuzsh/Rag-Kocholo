        "meta_description": "Amitabh Bachchan recently revealed that his wife Jaya Bachchan is his ‘worst critic’. In an interview on a chat show, the legendary actor was asked to name his worst critic and he named his wife. Big B said, ‘She will see a film and say “What is this kind of film you’re doing?” And there have been times in the past when she has walked out of one of my trials. There has been some kind of a domestic problem when I get home.’ Further stating how Jaya is ‘incredibly instinctive’, the ‘Piku’ actor added ‘She’ll meet a person for the first time and come and tell me “I like this guy. He’ll make a good film”. I say “But he hasn’t even started it”. Then she says “No but I just feel he’s going to make a good film.” So you just go with the wife, or else you know, you have domestic issues.’ In the end, Amitabh concluded his answer by saying that Jaya’s instinct ‘always turns out to be correct’. Meanwhile, Big B recently celebrated his 81st birthday and has an interesting line-up of films in the pipeline. He will be seen in ‘Kalki 2898 AD’ and ‘Ganapath’.",
