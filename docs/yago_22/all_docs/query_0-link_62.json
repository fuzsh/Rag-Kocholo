        "text": "Synopsis\n\nJaya and Amitabh Bachchan have declared a combined net worth exceeding Rs 1,578 crore. Their disclosed assets include 17 cars, jewellery valued at over Rs 95.74 crore, and a bank balance exceeding Rs 130 crore. The breakdown reveals a diverse portfolio spanning from real estate to investments, reflecting their status as one of India's wealthiest couples.\n\nJaya Bachchan, gearing up for her fifth term in the Rajya Sabha as a candidate from Uttar Pradesh representing the Samajwadi Party, recently disclosed her and her husband Amitabh Bachchan's financial standings in the election affidavit. The power couple's joint assets, as revealed in the affidavit, surpass the impressive sum of Rs 1,578 crore.\n\nFinancial Breakdown: Movable and Immovable Assets\n\nAccording to reports by various sources, including Business Today and The Times of India, Jaya Bachchan's personal net worth for the fiscal year 2022-23 stands at Rs 1.63 crore, while Amitabh Bachchan's is reported as Rs 273.74 crore for the same period.\n\nThe breakdown of their assets is quite remarkable. Jaya and Amitabh Bachchan's movable assets are estimated at Rs 849.11 crore, with immovable property valued at Rs 729.77 crore. Their significant bank balances are also disclosed, with Jaya's account holding Rs 10.11 crore and Amitabh's containing Rs 120.45 crore.\n\nLifestyle and Income Streams\n\nThe couple's possessions include a substantial collection of vehicles and jewellery. Jaya Bachchan owns jewellery worth Rs 40.97 crore and a car valued at Rs 9.82 lakh, while Amitabh's jewellery collection is valued at Rs 54.77 crore, accompanied by an impressive fleet of 16 vehicles worth Rs 17.66 crore, including luxury models like Mercedes and a Range Rover.\n\nTheir diverse sources of income contribute to this substantial wealth. Jaya's earnings stem from her multifaceted career, including endorsements, her role as an MP, and her fees as an actor. Meanwhile, Amitabh's income sources include interest, dividends, rental income, capital gains, and revenue from a solar plant, in addition to his professional fees as an actor.\n\nLast year, a report published by the Deccan Herald ranked Jaya as the third richest Rajya Sabha MP out of twenty-seven. TRS MP Bandi Partha Saradhi was the richest of all, with Rs 5,300.21 crore, followed by YSR Congress' Ayodhya Rami Reddy with Rs 2,577.75 crore and SP's Jaya Bachchan with Rs 1,001.63 crore.\n\nEntertainment Ventures and Political Journey\n\nDespite Jaya's relatively low profile in the film industry in recent years, her return with Karan Johar's 'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani' in 2023 marked a significant comeback. Conversely, Amitabh remains a prominent figure in both television, with appearances in 'Kaun Banega Crorepati,' and film, with recent and upcoming projects such as 'Ganapath,' 'Kalki 2898 AD,' and 'Vettaiyan.'\n\nJaya Bachchan's journey in politics has been notable, having served as a Rajya Sabha member since 2004. Her re-nomination by the Samajwadi Party underscores her continued significance in Indian politics. She has served multiple terms representing Uttar Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha.\n\nAs Jaya Bachchan embarks on her fifth term in the Rajya Sabha, her financial declaration reaffirms the Bachchan family's formidable presence, not only in the realms of entertainment but also in the broader socio-political landscape of India.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
