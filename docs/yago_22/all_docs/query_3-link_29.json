        "text": "As Jaya Bachchan turns a year older today, we look back at her love story with Amitabh Bachchan. The couple, who have been married for over four decades, have inspired generations and given them relationship goals.\n\nJaya was impressed by him in their very first meeting and it was almost a case of love at first sight. In an interview, she had said, \"I was introduced to him on the sets of Guddi. I was impressed by him and somewhat in awe as he was Harivanshrai Bachchan's son. I fell in love with him very soon.\"\n\nAmitabh wrote in his blog that they both were planning a trip to London to celebrate the success of his film, Zanjeer, but his father would have none of it. \"My father came down heavily on me - 'If you are planning a holiday with this girl, you will have to marry her and go, else your decision is denied.' I was an obedient child! I got married the very next day in a quickly organized wedding with family and some dear friends, without any fanfare, and left for the holiday that very night,\" he wrote.\n\nJaya said on Rendezvous With Simi Garewal that she never questions her husband when his name comes up in gossip columns because she finds it \"cheap\". She said that she has always trusted him completely.\n\nAmitabh also said that he never feels the need to explain anything that is written about him because he finds it \"demeaning\" to clarify to his wife and just thanked his stars saying, \"I'm very fortunate that Jaya is in the same profession. She understands what the media is all about and the various pitfalls and hazards that leading men and women go through.\"\n\nAmitabh and Jaya had said on Rendezvous With Simi Garewal that their children, Abhishek and Shweta, were the best part of their relationship. Jaya, who was pregnant with her first child during the making of Sholay, was taken care of by the entire unit."
