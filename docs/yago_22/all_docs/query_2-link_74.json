Her husband's bank balance is ₹120.45 crore. The Bachchan couple's combined movable property has been valued at ₹849.11 crore, while the immovable property amounts to ₹729.77 crore. This means their combined assets are of over ₹1,578 crore.\n\nJaya and Amitabh Bachchan's combined assets include property acquired through various sources, according to the election affidavit.

Bachchan is not among the PDA. I am not going to cast my votes against this 'dhokha' (deceit),\" Patel told PTI.\n\nJaya Bachchan was first elected in 2004 as the Member of Parliament from the Samajwadi Party, representing Uttar Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha till March 2006.
