        "text": "Nowadays where relationships are fragile and don’t last long enough, Bollywood couples like Anil Kapoor and Sunita Kapoor or Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan have sustained their togetherness. After spending nearly five decades with each other, Big B took to his micro-blogging website and shared a hilarious tale about his marriage.\n\nApparently, after the success of Zanjeer, Amitabh and Jaya along with their gang of friends were set to go on a holiday to London. Being their first abroad trip, Amitabh asked his late father Harivansh Rai Bachchan for the permission. When informed about who else was going on the trip, his father asked him to get married before he went on a trip with Jaya.\n\nTalking about the same, Big B wrote, “I lived on the 7th Road of this society .. on a rented house .. marriage had been decided among us .. nothing to be exaggerated or celebrated with any aplomb .. just the two families and .. done .. off to London, my first trip ever and hers too .. Zanjeer a success and a promise that if it did well we would all - a gang of our friends - would go on a holiday to London!\n\n“Seeking or rather informing parents that we were a group of friends going to England .. who all are going came the query from Babuji .. names disclosed .. Jaya is also going with you .. you both are alone .. yes .. if you have to go marry and go .. ok .. pandit and family informed .. next day all set .. flight at night .. marriage to finish before the flight .. ”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/ByQxq_2HorT/Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/p/ByQNLtypIEV/Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/p/ByRtg_en5SD/Instagram\n\nThe Badla actor also wrote about his wedding day, “I dress up in formal marriage Indian .. get into my car and want to drive to Malabar Hill where her friends lived and where the ceremony was to be done .. my driver Nagesh, pushes me out and insist he would drive me to the wedding .. the substitute for the tradition horse ..\n\n“Waiting all set at Mangal, the name of the house on rent on the 7th road JVPD Scheme .. and it begins to drizzle .. neighbours rush out to me .. leave for the wedding now .. the rain is a good omen .. off I went .. wedding over in a few hours .. done .. Mr and Mrs proclaimed .. over !!”\n\nWell sounds like a typical Bollywood wedding tale doesn’t it? What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below and stay tuned for more updates!"
