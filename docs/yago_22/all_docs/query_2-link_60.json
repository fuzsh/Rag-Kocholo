        "text": "Exactly 48 years ago, Bollywood's angry young man left many ladies heartbroken as he tied the knot with actress Jaya Bhaduri. The two stars officially met on the sets of Guddi and within a few years, they decided to enter into matrimony. Today, they have completed 48 years of marital bliss despite facing many hardships and have set an example for several couples out there.\n\nRight after Zanjeer's release in 1973, Jaya and Amitabh took their wedding vows and flew to London. The wedding ceremony was a low-key affair and only a few friends and family members were invited. But did you know that Big B popped the big question to Jaya after his dad objected to him travelling to London with a girl other than his wife? Yes, that's how courageous Big B was.\n\nOver the years, they have set new parameters of trust, understanding, and love in a relationship of a husband and a wife. Even though after marriage, the superstar was linked to several actresses, it didn't affect their married life as trust kept them together. And, as we know, soulmates find a way to stick to each other. That's exactly what happened in the case of Jaya and Amitabh.\n\nOver the years, they have appeared in several interviews and have shared many interesting details about each other. Scroll to read what Amitabh has shared about Jaya in the past!\n\nDuring an interaction with Simi Garewal in 1998, Amitabh shared that Jaya had all the good qualities he wanted in his wife and hence, he decided to tie the knot. He also shared that Jaya is more demonstrative when it comes to showing love or affection.\n\nOn Kaun Banega Crorepati, Big B once said that Jaya always manages to spot mischievous people with bad intentions. He had said, “I feel women have a sixth sense and they are able to better identify a person's hidden motives.”\n\nIn another episode of KBC, Big B opened up about his bond with his wife Jaya Bachchan. The megastar said that he writes love letters for Jaya to this day.\n\nIn the 11th season of KBC, Big B said that he has saved Jaya's name as \"JB\" on his phone.\n\nWhile talking about his married life with Jaya, Amitabh once wrote in his blog, “You see a picture, you work together, you spend time, you decide, you marry .. you have children, you have grandchildren, and you realise that there are not many that are blessed so .. so you thank the Almighty, the times of the day and the unknown force that brings all this together.”\n\nAmitabh and Jaya have also worked together in Sholay, Abhimaan, and Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham among others"
