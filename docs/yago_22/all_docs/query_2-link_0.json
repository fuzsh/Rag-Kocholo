        "text": "Indian actress and politician (born 1948)\n\nJaya Bachchan (née Bhaduri; born 9 April 1948) is an Indian actress and politician. She is serving as member of the parliament in the Rajya Sabha from the Samajwadi Party since 2004. Having worked in Hindi films and Bengali films, she is noted for reinforcing a natural style of acting in both mainstream and arthouse cinema.[2][3] A recipient of several accolades, she has won a record nine Filmfare Awards and the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian honour awarded by the Government of India.[4]\n\nBachchan made her film debut as a teenager in Satyajit Ray's Mahanagar (1963), followed by her first screen role as an adult in the drama Guddi (1971), directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, in their first of several collaborations. She was noted for her performances in films like Uphaar (1971), Koshish (1972) and Kora Kagaz (1974). She starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in several films, including Zanjeer (1973), Abhimaan (1973), Chupke Chupke (1975), Mili (1975) and the cult film Sholay (1975), which saw her playing the much-lauded role of a young widow. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Abhimaan, Kora Kagaz and Nauker (1979).\n\nFollowing her marriage to actor Amitabh Bachchan and the birth of their children, she restricted her work in films, notably starring in Yash Chopra's musical romantic drama Silsila (1981). After a 17-year sabbatical, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's independent drama Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa (1998). Bachchan won three Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actress for playing emotionally-troubled mothers in the commercially successful dramas Fiza (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003). After another hiatus, she made her comeback with Karan Johar's romantic comedy family-drama Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (2023), which earned her a fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nEarly life\n\nJaya Bhaduri was born in a Bengali family on 9 April 1948.[5] She is the daughter of Tarun Kumar Bhaduri, a journalist, author, and poet and his wife, Indira. She studied at St Joseph's Convent School, Bhopal and graduated from Film and Television Institute of India in Pune.[6]\n\nActing career\n\nBachchan first starred in Satyajit Ray's Bengali film, Mahanagar (1963) at the age of 15, with Anil Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee. She then appeared in two more Bengali films: a 13-minute short Suman,[7] and the comedy Dhanyee Meye (1971), where she played the role of Uttam Kumar's sister-in-law.[8]\n\nInspired by her experience with Ray, she joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune and graduated with a gold medal.[9] Hrishikesh Mukherjee cast her in Guddi (1971), to play the eponymous role of a petite school-girl obsessed with film star Dharmendra.[10] Guddi was a commercial success,[8] and created the girl-next-door image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. While she did venture out to play glamorous roles as in Jawani Diwani, (1972)[2] and a semi-negative character of an amnesia-faking heroine in Anamika (1973), she was most recognised for her roles epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of \"middle-cinema\" directors such as Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee and Mukherjee.[11] These films include Uphaar (1971), Piya Ka Ghar (1972), Parichay (1972), Koshish (1972) and Bawarchi (1972).[10][12] They also made her a superstar.[8]\n\nIn Gulzar's Koshish, Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as disabled people. She described the film as \"a learning experience\" which motivated her to do social work in future.[13]\n\nShe first acted with Amitabh Bachchan in Bansi Birju (1972), followed by B. R. Ishara's Ek Nazar also in the same year.[8] When Amitabh had faced a string of flops and most lead heroines refused to work with him in the Salim–Javed scripted Zanjeer (1973), she agreed to step in. The film turned out to be a big hit creating Bachchan's angry-young-man image.[14] All their successive films as a pair were huge hits – Abhimaan (1973), Chupke Chupke (1975), Mili (1975) and Sholay (1975).\n\nHer daughter Shweta was born around the time Jaya and Amitabh were working on Sholay. Following this, she retired from films and focused on raising her children, making an exception for Yash Chopra's Silsila (1981), once again opposite her husband. During the late 1980s, she wrote the story for Shahenshah (1988), which starred her husband in the lead.\n\nAfter a gap of 17 years, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa (1998), a film about the Naxalite movement. Her performance in the film earned critical acclaim, and earned her a second Filmfare Special Award.\n\nIn 2000, she starred alongside Karisma Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan in the crime drama Fiza as a mother longing for her son's return who goes missing during the 1993 Bombay riots. The film received critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise directed towards Bachchan's performance. Sanjeev Bariana of The Tribune opined that \"Bachchan delivers a commendable performance, displaying mixed emotions through trying times delicately.\", while Screen film critic Chaya Unnikrishnan noted that \"Bachchan looks every bit a Muslim woman and etches out her character superbly.\"[15][16] Moreover, it emerged as a commercial success at the box-office, grossing ₹322 million (US$7.17 million) worldwide.[17] Fiza earned Bachchan her first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nShe then starred in Karan Johar's ensemble family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) with her husband and in Nikhil Advani's romantic comedy drama Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), playing Preity Zinta's mother, Jennifer Kapur, both of which also earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.[18] She starred with her son Abhishek in Laaga Chunari Mein Daag (2007) and Drona (2008).\n\nIn 2011, she appeared in the Bangladeshi film Meherjaan starring Victor Banerjee and Humayun Faridi. The film is based on a Bangladesh-Pakistan love story in the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities.[19] In 2023, she starred alongside Dharmendra and Shabana Azmi in Karan Johar's romantic comedy family drama Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, which emerged as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year.[20] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama noted, \"Bachchan is electrifying. Her commanding presence, authoritative attitude and cold stares – this is a stand-out act that's sure to be talked about by moviegoers.\"[21] Her performance in the film earned her a fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSee also: Bachchan family\n\nJaya married actor Amitabh Bachchan, on 3 June 1973.[22] The couple has two children: Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan, who is also an actor. Shweta is married to industrialist Nikhil Nanda, grandson of Raj Kapoor, and has two children, Navya Naveli Nanda and Agastya Nanda,[23] while Abhishek is married to actress and Miss World 1994 Aishwarya Rai with whom he has a daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan.[24]\n\nBachchan's speech during the musical launch of Drona in 2008 was criticised by some sections of politicians in Maharashtra. In response to the film's director, Goldie Behl, making his introductory speech in English, she said in Hindi, \"Hum UP ke log hain, isliye Hindi mein baat karenge, Maharashtra ke log maaf kijiye\". (Translation: \"We are people from UP, so we will speak in Hindi. People of Maharashtra, please forgive us.\") Subsequently, she encouraged actress Priyanka Chopra to speak in Hindi.[25]\n\nMaharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray commented that she had no business referring to all the people of Maharashtra in her statement. He threatened to ban all of her films unless she apologised in a public forum for hurting the sentiments of Maharashtrians. MNS workers began to attack theatres screening The Last Lear, which starred her husband. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut also criticised her statement, \"After making all your success and fortune in Mumbai, if you feel like saying that we are from UP, it's very unfortunate\". Amitabh tendered an apology for her statement on her behalf.[26]\n\nPolitical career\n\nBachchan was first elected in 2004 as the Member of Parliament from the Samajwadi Party, representing Uttar Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha till March 2006.[27] She was disqualifed in 2006 for holding an office of profit.[28][29] Subsequently, she got a second term from June 2006[30] till July 2010 and in February 2010 she stated her intent to complete her term.[31][clarification needed] She was re-elected in 2012 for the third term and again in 2018 for her fourth term in the Rajya Sabha from Samajwadi Party. Also, she campaigned for All India Trinamool Congress during 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.\n\nParliamentary Committee assignments\n\n13 September 2021 onwards: Member, Committee on External Affairs[32]\n\nPositions held\n\nJaya Bachchan has been elected 5 times as Rajya Sabha MP.\n\nAs per the Election affidavit of 2018 (Rajya Sabha), Jaya Bachchan has assets worth ₹1,001.63 crores and liabilities worth ₹105.64 crores.[33]\n\nList of political positions held # From To Position Party 1. 2004 2006 MP (1st term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh (by-poll) SP 2. 2006 2012 MP (2nd term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP 3. 2012 2018 MP (3rd term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP 4. 2018 2024 MP (4th term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP 5. 2024 Present MP (5th term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP\n\nArtistry and legacy\n\nBachchan is regarded as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema.[34] One of the highest paid actress of the 1970s, in 2022, she was placed in Outlook India's \"75 Best Bollywood Actresses\" list.[35] Filmfare included Bachchan's performances in Abhimaan in its Bollywood's \"80 Iconic Performances\" list.[36]\n\nWriting for Times of India, Subhash K. Jha termed her an \"exceptional talent\" and noted, \"During her brief innings of superstardom she was a far bigger star than her husband.\"[37] Samriddhi Patwa of Filmfare noted, \"The Bengali actress who had long hair, a sweet smile, and significant roles conquered the silver screen.\"[38] Dinesh Raheja of Rediff.com termed her an \"outspoken actress\" and noted, \"Dimunitive she may be, but Jaya Bhaduri has managed to cast a long shadow over the world of Hindi films.\"[39] Indian Express said that her filmography is \"full of gems\" and added, \"The Bengali beauty ruled the silver screen with meaningful roles.\"[40] Kanika Katyal of Firstpost noted, \"Full of vigour and idealism, Jaya found herself at home in the \"middle cinema\" of the 1970s\", and added, \"Each time she emoted, the camera was firmly in her grip.\"[41]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms\n\nList of film credits Year Title Role Notes Ref. 1963 Mahanagar Bani Mazumdar Bengali film 1971 Guddi Kusum (Guddi) [42] Uphaar Mrinmayee (Minoo) Jai Jawan Jai Makan Dhanyee Meye Mansa Bengali film [43] Atattor din porey Bengali film Janani Bengali film 1972 Jawani Diwani Neeta Thakur Bawarchi Krishna Harinath Sharma [44] Parichay Rama Roy Bansi Birju Bansi Piya Ka Ghar Malti Shankar Annadata Aarti Ek Nazar Shabnam Samadhi Rekha Koshish Aarti Mathur Shor Rani (Raat Ki Rani) 1973 Gaai Aur Gori Vijaya [45] Anamika Anamika Dutt/ Kanchan/ Archana Phagun Santosh (Toshi) Zanjeer Mala [46] Abhimaan Uma Kumar [47] 1974 Dil Diwana Neeta Sadhu Judhisthirer Korcha Bengali film Kora Kagaz Archana Gupta Naya Din Nai Raat Sushma Doosri Sita Seeta Wagle 1975 Mili Mili Khanna [48] Chupke Chupke Vasudha Kumar Sholay Radha Singh [49] 1977 Abhi To Jee Lein Jaya Delayed release 1978 Ek Baap Chhe Bete Cameo 1979 Nauker Geeta 1981 Silsila Shobha Malhotra [50] 1995 Akka Marathi film 1998 Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa Sujata Chatterjee 2000 Fiza Nishatbi Ikramullah [51] 2001 Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...
