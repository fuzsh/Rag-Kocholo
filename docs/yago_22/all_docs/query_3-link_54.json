        "text": "Amitabh Bachchan, who has been married to actress Jaya Bachchan for 50 years, gave a marriage advice to Indian cricketer Ishan Kishan, saying that the wife is the ‘Sarkaar’ of the family.\n\nMegastar Amitabh Bachchan had tied the knot with Jaya in June, 1973. The couple have two children- actor Abhishek Bachchan, and daughter Shweta Bachchan.\n\nAbhishek is married to former Miss World and actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, and they have a daughter Aaradhya.\n\nWhile, Shweta is married to businessman Nikhil Nanda, and the couple have daughter Navya, and son Agastya.\n\nBig B, who is the host of the quiz based reality show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati 15’, welcomed cricket sensations Ishan and Smriti Mandhana to the hot seat in the episode 96.\n\nBefore the game started, Ishan asked Amitabh: “I have a question before we begin the game. Kaun Banega Crorepati and cricket are parallel games. There’s an umpire (referring to computer) in the game."
