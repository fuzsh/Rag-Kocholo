        "text": "Recently, veteran Bollywood actress and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan was in the headlines after refusing to be addressed by her husband actor Amitabh Bachchan’s name in Parliament. In Monday’s session too, Jaya Bachchan repeated similar thoughts before being schooled by Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar, whose statement was followed by claps and cheers from other members.\n\nIn a video now going viral online, Dhankhar introduces the SP MP as ‘Shrimati Jaya Amitabh Bachchan’ in the Rajya Sabha, which is her official name on her nomination papers. However, Jaya Bachchan again objected and asked, “Sir, aapko Amitabh ka matlab pata hai na?”\n\nDhankhar immediately replied, “Ma’am, aap badal dijiye, main badalwa dunga. There is a procedure to change the name that you have submitted for your election certificate. I had made use of the provision myself in 1989, and it is available for all the members. Please change it officially then.”\n\nWhile the Opposition members cheered and clapped at Dhankhar’s response, Jaya Bachchan clarified that she is proud of her husband’s achievements and has no shame in being associated with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Netizens praised Dhankhar. “On one hand, she says she is very proud of her husband; on the other hand, she has a problem with the Speaker calling her by her full name – the name she provided herself. Glad that Jagdeep Dhankhar taught her a lesson,” a user wrote. Another wrote, “Jaya Amitabh Bachchan once again tried acting oversmart with her objection over using ‘Amitabh’ in her name. This time, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar Ji schooled her.”\n\nFor those who don’t know, it all began on 29 July when Jaya Bachchan first objected to Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Harivansh Narayan Singh, introducing her as Jaya Amitabh Bachchan. She said she had an identity of her own separate from her husband’s name. Later, in another session, Jaya Bachchan introduced herself as “Main Jaya Amitabh Bachchan,” leaving Dhankhar in splits."
