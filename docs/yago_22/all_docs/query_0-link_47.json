They have worked together in scores of movies including Guddi, Ek Nazar, Bawarchi, Sholay, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Abhimaan, and Chupke Chupke among others.\n\nMeanwhile, on the acting front, Amitabh Bachchan is busy shooting for Vettaiyan, which also stars Rajinikanth. Pictures from Amitabh and Rajinikanth's reunion on the sets of TJ Gnanavel's upcoming film went viral.\n\nIn a photo, the megastars, wearing sleek suits, posed stylishly together. Rajinikanth and Amitabh also hugged each other, and another photo showed them deeply engrossed in discussion.\n\nBefore this, they were featured together in Andhaa Kaanoon (1983), and Geraftaar (1985). Their last film was Hum, which was released in 1991.\n\nAmitabh will also be seen with Prabhas, Deepika Padukone and Kamal Haasan in Kalki 2898 AD.
