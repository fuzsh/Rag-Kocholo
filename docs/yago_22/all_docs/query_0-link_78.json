        "text": "Jaya Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan are one of the most loved Bollywood couples. The veteran actress always stood with her husband, Amitabh, in the testing times. In fact, when murmurs of Amitabh Bachchan's relationship with Rekha made headlines in the media, Jaya stood with him and proved that those were just rumours. However, not many know that Amitabh Bachchan had put a condition to marry Jaya Bachchan.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmitabh Bachchan didn't want a 9-5 working wife\n\nAmitabh and Jaya tied the knot at a friend's apartment in a hush-hush wedding ceremony in 1973 after dating for some time. However, before the marriage, Amitabh had imposed a condition that Jaya would reduce her work hours. Yes, in a conversation with her granddaughter, Navya Naveli Nanda, during her podcast, What The Hell Navya, Jaya revealed Amitabh's condition.\n\nRecommend Read: Alia Bhatt's Old Video With Ex, Sidharth Malhotra Surfaces, Netizen Says 'She Changed After Wedding'\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nJaya revealed that they had decided to get married in October as her work would be less during that time. However, Amitabh straight away told her that he didn't want a wife who was working 9 to 5. He clarified that she could work, but she should reduce her work time. Sharing the anecdote, Jaya Bachchan said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We had decided we will marry in October because by then my work would have reduced. But he had told me, 'I definitely don’t want a wife who will be 9 to 5. Please work, but not every day. You choose your projects and work with the right people'.\"\n\nJaya Bachchan's father was not happy with her decision of getting married to Amitabh Bachchan\n\nIn the same podcast, Jaya Bachchan stated that she was planning to go on a trip with Amitabh Bachchan when he one day called her and told her that his parents would allow them to go on a holiday if they got married. She agreed and told him to talk to her parents. Jaya Bachchan revealed her father wasn't happy with the news of her marriage. She said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"So I said we were already planning to get married in October, let’s get it done in June. But you will have to speak to my parents. He called my father, who was not very happy since he never wanted me to get married.”\n\nWhen Amitabh Bachchan praised Jaya Bachchan for choosing home and not films after marriage\n\nAmitabh Bachchan was hailed as 'Sadi ka Mahanayak', while his wife, Jaya Bachchan, stayed at home and looked after their kids, Abhishek Bachchan and Shweta Bachchna. Once, in 2014, at India Today Conclave, Amitabh Bachchan praised Jaya Bachchan for choosing to stay at home and not giving preference to films. He said:\n\nadvertisement.\n\n\"One thing I find very admirable about Jaya is that she chose to give preference to home and not films. There was no obstacle from me ever, it was her decision. In marriages, all decisions are taken by the wife.”\n\nWhat do you think about Jaya's revelation about Amitabh's condition of getting married to him?\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nNext Read: Rishi Kapoor Revealed 'Playboy' Ranbir Kapoor Was Dating 4 Girls At A Time, Later Changed His Remark\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
