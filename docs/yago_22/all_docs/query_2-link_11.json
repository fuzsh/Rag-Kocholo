        "text": "Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri (now Bachchan) had an intimate and simple wedding ceremony on June 3, 1973. Jaya once shared that her father didn't want her to get married and was not 'happy' about her relationship with Amitabh. Amitabh's father, poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, also mentioned in his autobiography, In the Afternoon of Time, what Jaya's father told him after the wedding ceremony of the two actors concluded.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Before we left, I embraced the father of my new daughter-in-law and congratulated him on getting a son-in-law like Amit, expecting him to say the same in respect of Jaya. But he said, ‘My family is utterly ruined,'\" Harivansh wrote in the book as he recalled the day of his son Amitabh Bachchan's wedding.\n\nHarivansh Rai also recounted the events of June 3, 1973, when Amitabh and Jaya became husband and wife. Given Amitabh's popularity after the success of films like Zanjeer, Namak Haram, and Saudagar, his family decided to have a small and intimate wedding ceremony to avoid his fans thronging the event.\n\nThe famous poet noted, \"Jaya’s family decided not to hold the ceremony at their flat in Beach House but at a friend’s place on the top floor of the Skylark building in Malabar Hills.\" Harivansh Rai also shared that the wedding ceremony was planned in such a hush-hush manner that even their neighbours didn't know about it. Only their relatives, Jagdish Rajan and his family, along with the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her family, were invited to the wedding, as Indira Gandhi and Amitabh’s mother, Teji Bachchan, shared a close bond.\n\n\"Jaya’s parents wanted the marriage to be conducted in the Bengali manner, to which we had no objection. The first stage was the var-puja, the veneration of the groom, which involved Jaya’s father coming to Mangal (Amitabh’s residence) with gifts and conducting a small ceremony; I then reciprocated by doing the same for the bride at Beach House. I noticed something quite unexpected at Beach House: nobody in the family, apart from Jaya, showed even the slightest trace of pleasure,” Harivansh wrote in his autobiography.\n\nRecalling the wedding day, the poet added, \"We went up in the lift, Jaya was in her bridal adornment, and for the first time, I saw a bashful shyness on her face and realised what a particular aspect of beauty it is.”\n\nAmitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan have been married for 51 years now. They are parents to two children -- Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan."
