        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAmitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri's wedding on June 3, 1973, was a low-key affair, contrary to the grandiose Bollywood weddings of today. The couple kept their ceremony intimate, held at a friend's apartment to avoid media attention. Despite Amitabh's rising stardom, only a few close friends and family attended, including political leader Sanjay Gandhi. Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Amitabh's father, detailed the events in his autobiography, revealing the subdued atmosphere and the family's efforts to maintain secrecy.\n\nWith the recent grand wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant bringing attention back to extravagant Indian weddings, it's a perfect time to reflect on a much quieter, yet equally significant, wedding from Bollywood history. Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan’s wedding in 1973 was a low-key affair, as detailed by Amitabh’s father, the legendary poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, in his autobiography \"In the Afternoon of Time.\"\n\nDespite Amitabh’s burgeoning fame from hits like \"Namak Haram,\" \"Saudagar,\" and \"Zanjeer,\" the Bachchan family opted for a subdued wedding to avoid attracting massive crowds. Harivansh Rai Bachchan noted in his autobiography that Jaya’s family chose a friend’s place in the Skylark building at Malabar Hills for the ceremony, rather than their own flat at Beach House. Even Amitabh’s neighbors were unaware of the event.\n\nThe Exclusive Guest List and Traditions\n\nThe guest list was extremely exclusive, including only close relatives and the family of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who sent her son Sanjay Gandhi as her representative. “We sent a telegram to Jagdish Rajan to 'come with your family immediately,' with no indication of the reason,” Harivansh Rai wrote, highlighting the secretive nature of the wedding.\n\nJaya’s family wanted the marriage conducted in traditional Bengali manner, which the Bachchans embraced. The first stage was the var-puja, where Jaya’s father visited Amitabh’s residence with gifts, conducting a small ceremony. Harivansh Rai then reciprocated at Jaya’s Beach House. He was surprised to see that no one, apart from Jaya, showed any sign of happiness during the ceremony.\n\nThe Haldi ceremony was also kept under wraps. Amitabh’s mother, Teji Bachchan, was particularly moved by the emotional but quiet event. “The joy that was so confined by this constriction spilled out in a tingling of the spine and a tearful glimmering of the eye, especially in Teji’s case,” wrote Harivansh Rai. The family even misled their neighbors, saying the decorations were for a film shoot.\n\nA Shocking Reaction From Jaya's Father\n\nAfter the wedding, which concluded late at night, the baraatis departed quietly. Harivansh Rai congratulated Jaya’s father on gaining a son-in-law like Amitabh, expecting reciprocal praise for Jaya. Instead, he was stunned when Jaya’s father said, “My family is utterly ruined.” This reaction was unexpected and remains a poignant memory from the wedding.\n\nDespite the initial shock and low-key nature of their wedding, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan have enjoyed a strong marriage, celebrating 51 years together. They have two children, Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan, and are grandparents to Navya Naveli Nanda, Agastya Nanda, and Aaradhya Bachchan.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
