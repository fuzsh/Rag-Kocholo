        "text": "Jaya Bachchan took a long break from acting after she married Amitabh Bachchan and welcomed children, Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan. After starring in Silsila, alongside Amitabh and Rekha in 1981, Rekha took a step back from acting to focus on her personal life. Although Jaya, who was extremely popular at the time, turned away from the chatter, speculations about her break continued over the years.\n\nHowever, Amitabh Bachchan pulled the plug on the speculations during an chat with a group of journalists in 1990s. In a video shared by Lehren on YouTube, a journalist asked Amitabh, “This is a question that millions of your fans wanted to ask. Did Jaya ji leave movies to avoid an Abhimaan kind of a situation at home?”\n\nAmitabh clarified that it wasn’t the case. He said the Guddi star took a break from the industry out of her own will. “No, I think she left something out of her own will. She felt that she was more required in the house and that’s why she left working in films. This is her own desire, if she wants to ever work again, she has the freedom to do so,” he said.\n\n“As far as the story of Abhimaan is concerned, yes, of course, she was a huge star when I met her, and continued to be one when I married her. But one of the things I had in my mind, and this is something really personal, was that if I was to marry her, I should really have my own standing and my own position. And that was one of the reasons why I was very keen to make it because I knew if I could make it, I could make it to the altar with Jaya,” Big B added.\n\nJaya made a comeback in 1998 with Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa and did a few films thereon. She was seen in films such as Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Ghum and Kal Ho Naa Ho. Her last release was Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani in 2023."
