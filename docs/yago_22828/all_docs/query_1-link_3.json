Coop is an engaging yarn which follows the reorientation of a rodeo rider, who after spending 10 years in jail for passing a bum check and fighting with a sheriff, is released to discover he is in collision with a totally-unexpected present.\n\nCliff Robertson, who stars, produced, directed and scripted, has fashioned from all angles a strong, believable character study of a professional rider who finds he must not only adjust to radically altered American attitudes, but also to the rodeo circuit, which has taken on a big business air that is alien to him.\n\nThere are also startling social changes that Coop must cope with, including adjusting to a free-thinking, on-the-road woman who besides offering him no-strings companionship, attempts to turn him around by educating him to the reality of an altered society, the problems of pollution and humorously trying to turn him on to soybeans and other health foods.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nRobertsonâ€™s sensitive treatment and savvy direction has created a character at once heroic and tragic."
