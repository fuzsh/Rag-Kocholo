        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click the links on the capsules for more complete reviews.\n\nThe Story of a Three-Day Pass (1968) Melvin Van Peebles’ debut as a screenwriter/director is a modest, lively, often amusing little picture about a black soldier stationed in France (Harry Baird) enjoying an extended pass from his American base and romancing an engaging if enigmatic Parisian girl (Nicole Berger) and about which extravagant claims are now being made due largely to the race of its maker. Based by Van Peebles on his own novel La Permission, the movie has a loose, impressionistic structure and an alternately playful and pretentious approach to imagery some of which works and much of which, like the filmmaker’s own score, is irritating. It also doesn’t help that the good-looking Baird is such a non-actor and so clearly out of his depth; at moments of disengagement I kept thinking how much better Hari Rhodes would have been. The picture’s tone is generally realistic yet Baird’s white Captain (Hal Brav) is a cartoon — a funny cartoon, but a cartoon — and almost everyone and everything in the movie is set up to betray Baird, in a more or less racist fashion. While Van Peebles showed obvious talent here, both as a writer and a director, no amount of special pleading can turn The Story of a Three-Day Pass into a retrospective masterpiece. Yet The New Yorker‘s resident idiot critic Richard Brody calls this mélange of styles and attitudes “among the great American films of the sixties.” Pull the other one, Brody. Overpraising a man’s work because he is or was black is as bad as underpraising it for the same reason. It not only does not redress the original injury; it adds a new layer of racism to it.\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman (1981) Another movie adaptation of a novel that resisted transmigration to a performance medium, but one with many compensations and much to recommend it. John Fowles’ thoroughly engaging 1969 book was a literary experiment evoking the conventions of the Victorian novel while simultaneously critiquing and commenting on them. Even those movie critics who had never read Fowles’ novel knew in 1981 that it contained three separate endings, one conventionally happy, one conventionally un-happy, and one entirely speculative, ambivalent, and purely literary. Although I feel that this technique could, with sufficient wit, imagination and budget, have been translated to the screen, Harold Pinter’s solution was, in addition to depicting two endings, imposing a contemporary love story in which the (fictional) leading actors appearing in the movie, both married to others, enact their own parallel love affair, clever but not entirely satisfying. What’s best about it are the way it permits, through the actors’ research into the period, some of Fowles’ observations about Victorian England to seep into the narrative, and the ending, in which Pinter makes it devastatingly clear that the young actor playing the leading man in the film-within-the-film has, like his Victorian counterpart in the story, confused the actress with her role.\n\nKarel Reisz, an interesting British filmmaker who alas directed far too few movies, did a splendid job of calibrating the performances of the actors, the intricacies of Fowles’ and Pinter’s work, and the exquisite cinematography by the great Freddie Francis, especially of the Lyme Regis locations including that rather terrifying harbor wall called The Cobb at the end of which the eponymous character habitually stares out to sea. The dual characters of the English Sarah Woodruff and the American actress Anna were among Meryl Streep’s most important early roles and although I am often ambivalent about her at once splendid technique and concomitant, almost Brechtian, emotional distance from us, seeing The French Lieutenant’s Woman again after several decades’ abeyance I am happy to reassess my original, somewhat underwhelmed, perception of her performance. She understands, and conveys, the ambivalence of Sarah, both as her unintended swain Charles Smithson (Jeremy Irons) perceives her and as John Fowles the author does. Sarah’s motivations are ultimately unknowable, perhaps even to herself, and it seems increasingly clear through the narrative that the opinion of the kindly Dr. Grogan (Leo McKern) that she is mentally and emotionally unbalanced is correct. Pinter makes clear that Sarah is a frustrated artist in an age which did not admit of, much less encourage, a woman — especially a single woman, and one of dubious “moral” repute — to such pursuits. In this Sarah Woodruff’s position is not unlike Virginia Woolf’s fictional sister of Shakespeare in “A Room of One’s Own,” driven mad by her gift and by her society’s determination that she not be permitted to express it. Streep plays that too, silently, giving the character a vivid inner life, one of the most difficult things for any actor to accomplish on film. She also slyly comments on the action, at one point laughing quietly when in their climactic confrontation scene she is knocked to the floor by Irons. It’s a dazzling, almost Pirandellian moment of the kind which it is now I suppose compulsory to refer to, breathlessly, as “meta,” an obligation from which this writer begs his leave. Speaking of such things, there’s a wonderfully conceived and edited moment when Streep as Ana, rehearsing indoors with Irons, trips and, after a cut, is caught in her fall by him in the woods where Charles and Sarah are meeting. That’s a marvelous juxtaposition, beautifully achieved and without ostentation.\n\nIrons too was on the cusp of an impressive movie (and theatrical) career and his work as Smithson is intelligent and perceptive. Betrothed to a young girl (Lynsey Baxter) far too silly and inconsequential for him, Smithson offers a moment of gentlemanly kindness to Sarah, and becomes fatally bound to her. Irons locates Charles’ privileged sense, as the potential heir to a fortune, of snobbish noblesse oblige as well as his own essential frustrations, and his basic decency. The supporting roles are perfectly cast, from the calculating Baxter and the splendid McKern to Hilton McRae as Charles’ valet Sam, Emily Morgan as Sam’s inamorata Mary and Patience Collier as Sarah’s truly horrific old termagant employer. Fowls in the novel gets the last laugh on her when, as she stands before the Pearly Gates expecting if not demanding immediate admittance, he consigns her to Hell. Even as she’s falling from Heaven she’s sure it’s all the fault of her old earthly rival in the piousness game.\n\nSwiss Family Robinson (1960) The very entertaining Disney adaptation of the 1812 Johann David Wyss novel minus its sanctimonious Christian tone but with pirates. Astonishingly, the entirety of the movie’s dialogue had to be dubbed by the actors after filming was completed due to ambient location noise. It’s frequently noticeable, but for the most part remarkably well done. John Mills and Dorothy McGuire make a splendid team as Father and Mother, James MacArthur (often shirtless, which must have made a lot of teenage hearts flutter in 1960) a robust Fritz, Tommy Kirk (who also stirred a few juvenile libidos) a charming Ernst, Janet Munro a lovely interloper and Sessue Hayakawa the leader of the pirates. Lowell S. Hawley wrote the very good screenplay, well directed by Ken Annakin and beautifully shot by Harry Waxman. It’s an attractive movie with an attractive cast, always excluding the almost unrelievedly obnoxious Kevin Corcoran, whom I have actively loathed since my own childhood. I’m no advocate for the beating of children, but having watched Corcoran’s terminal brattiness in too many pictures like this one I’d happily make an exception in his case.\n\nKotch (1971) Katharine Topkins’ 1965 novel begins promisingly and quickly devolves into a deadly combination of relentless intellectual cleverness on the part of the author and gently militant annoyance by her protagonist. Although Joseph P. Kotcher is essentially harmless, he’s also an increasingly senescent, educated pill who drives everyone around him to distraction with his endless verbal rodomontade. What attracted Jack Lemmon to this material and convinced him to make it his directorial debut I can’t imagine, especially since the screenwriter John Paxton’s adaptation is all too faithful to the book. It’s worth seeing once for Matthau’s finely judged performance, which does its best to make “Kotch” palatable; for Lemmon’s clean, uncluttered direction; and for the other performers, who include Deborah Winters as the bright pregnant teenager Kotch adopts, Charles Aidman as his guilt-ridden son, Jane Connell as a jolly social worker, Larry Linville as the girl’s single-minded salesman father and Felicia Farr, otherwise known as Mrs. Lemmon, as Kotch’s disapproving daughter-in-law. Marvin Hamlisch’s score is one of his most pleasant, with a tender, memorable theme for Kotch.\n\nThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) The screen adaptation of Muriel Spark’s great short novel. It’s not nearly as good as its source, but it’s beautifully acted and thoroughly entertaining.\n\nHarry & Tonto (1974) It’s fashionable now to claim that Art Carney won the Best Actor Academy Award over Pacino in The Godfather Part II and Nicholson in Chinatown for sentimental reasons, which only points up how stupid most awards really are. Carney had nothing to apologize for, nor did anyone who voted for him. Harry & Tonto only looks, and feels, better with the passing of the years, a serio-comic King Lear that ends not with tragedy but with the grin of a young child building castles on the sands of a Santa Monica beach under Harry’s benign supervision.\n\nThe Great Northfield Minnesota Raid (1972) If you put the best of the writer/director Philip Kaufman’s take on the failed 1876 bank robbery by the Younger/James gang together with what also works in The Long Riders, Walter Hill’s 1980 fantasy on the same event, you might if you were a judicious editor come up with about one-third of a good movie. At least the Dave Grusin score in this one hasn’t been mixed to drown out the dialogue the way Ry Cooder’s was in the Hill picture, nor does Kaufman rely on stunt casting (all those brothers playing brothers) and dragging in people such as “the coward Robert Ford” who weren’t even there. And although Kaufman was stuck with Cliff Robertson for his star he at least also had Robert Duvall (as Jesse James) as a counterbalance. The supporting cast is excellent and includes Dana Elcar, Donald Moffat, Jack Manning, Elisha Cook, Royal Dano, Barry Brown, Nellie Burt, Liam Dunn and, as narrator, the stentorian tones of Paul Frees. The picture was well written but plagued by pretty terrible post-production dubbing, especially by Herbert Nelson, playing the chief detective from Pinkerton. At least at 98 minutes the movie has the virtue of brevity.\n\nWatermelon Man (1970) Melvin Van Peebles’ sophomore effort as a director is a very funny absurdist fantasy, written by Herman Raucher, about a cheerful liberal bigot who wakes up black. Despite Van Peebles’ attempts to turn Watermelon Man into a statement of militancy — the ending feels grafted onto a narrative that can’t support it — the movie makes its satirical points broadly but with wit and originality. Godfrey Cambridge stars as the hotshot insurance agent Jeff Gerber, in the best and largest movie role this gifted comedian ever had, and he’s a marvel. Gerber is a smiling, seemingly congenial creep who operates as if the entire world exists only to gratify his needs. He has a glib answer for everything (and everyone) and is so nonchalantly competitive he races his bus on foot every morning while the passengers urge their driver to leave him in the dust. When his ethnicity changes overnight he’s thrown into an uncharacteristic panic. Nothing in his ordered world makes sense any longer, and even his liberal wife (Estelle Parsons) whom he previously accused of deliberately watching on television nothing except race-riots, draws away from him.\n\nParsons’ character, and her performance, are the movie’s most perfect, subtle attack on phony liberal pieties, but she’s hardly alone: The lubricious Norwegian secretary (Kay Kimberley) in Cambridge’s insurance office who wouldn’t give Gerber the time of day when he was white now paws him at every opportunity, and when he calls her on her own bigotry she immediately screams “Nigger!” at him. Then there’s the counterman played by the great old character player Mantan Moreland whose servile, shuffling, “hyuck-hyuck-hyuck” mask with Gerber when he’s white instantly drops away when Gerber is black. W. Wallace Kelley’s color cinematography is garish, like a period Universal TV movie of the week gone berserk but Van Peebles’ sharp, effective direction holds the enterprise together. His music, as was the case with the earlier The Story of a Three-Day Pass, is good when it isn’t terrible, as in the “Love, That’s America” song that plays over Cambridge disgustedly quitting a garbageman job and which is sung, gratingly off-pitch, by its composer.\n\nCambridge, whose comic persona was of a man of above-average intelligence who is amused by much and startled by very little and who was one of the brightest entertainment figures of his era, was not so much ill-used by American filmmakers as ignored. He had a good role in Theodore J. Flicker’s great political satire The President’s Analyst (1967) and an even better one as a Yiddish-speaking cabbie in Bye Bye Braverman the next year, starred as Chester Himes’ Gravedigger Jones in the delightful Cotton Comes to Harlem (also 1970) and its sequel Come Back, Charleston Blue (1972), had a cameo as himself in the enjoyable comedy Five on the Black Hand Side (1973), and not much else. (He died in 1976, at the obscenely young age of 43.) His performance as Jeff Gerber should have opened every door to him. Why didn’t it?\n\nTanner ’88 (1988) The innovative 11-part political series created and written by Garry Trudeau and directed by Robert Altman with a master’s eye for understated satire.\n\nThey All Laughed (1981) I wanted to like this romantic comedy written and directed by Peter Bogdanovich a great deal more than I eventually did. It’s congenial, beautifully shot on its New York City locations by Robby Müller and (for the most part) engagingly acted by its ensemble cast. But it’s needlessly convoluted and ultimately adds up to very little. Bogdanovich was so busy coming up with plot complications for his extremely slight narrative he neglected to give us individualized characters. Worse, the few who are exceptionally singular are also exasperating (Colleen Camp) or obnoxious (Blaine Novak). The dialogue, as was often the case when Bogdanovich wrote by himself, is a collection of moderately bright, would-be humorous wisecracks whose style seems borrowed from the sophisticated screwball comedies by others, notably Howard Hawks, Leo McCarey and Ernst Lubitsch, the comic filmmakers he most admired.\n\nNone of this gives me any pleasure to express because unlike many if not most of his contemporary critics I like Bogdanovich’s pictures in the main and several of them (Targets, The Last Picture Show, What’s Up Doc?, Paper Moon) as much as any movies I’ve ever seen. I’m especially sorry not to be as charmed by They All Laughed as I hoped to be because the circumstances surrounding its completion and release (the horrific murder of the writer-director’s inamorata Dorothy Stratten, his attempt at releasing the movie himself, his subsequent bankruptcy and period of unemployability) were so shattering to its maker. Stratten, by the way, is not only beautiful and exceptionally photogenic; she is also, in an underwritten role, very good. Certainly she is better than Camp who, as the most voluble character in the movie, proves a staggering incompetent. Worse, she never once sounds like an actual human being, only like a character in a self-consciously clever motion picture. There is one moment in They All Laughed I found profoundly moving: When Audrey Hepburn, after a brief romantic interlude with Ben Gazzara which restores her sense of herself as a desirable woman, flies off in a helicopter. I hasten to add that I teared up not because of the situation but due to this being for all intents and purposes (who counts Spielberg’s Always?) Hepburn’s final moments in a movie.\n\nThe Honey Pot (1967) A typically verbose (and typically clever) adaptation by the writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz of a Frederick Knott play based on Thomas Sterling’s novel The Evil of the Day, itself suggested by Ben Jonson’s play Volpone. Although, in patented Mankiewicz fashion the picture is at least 20 minutes too long, it’s also witty, sumptuously filmed and appointed, and played to a fare-thee-well by a cast of veterans including Rex Harrison, Susan Hayward, Capucine, Edie Adams and Adolfo Celi. Cliff Robertson as usual comes off as a stiff, unpleasant amateur but he’s more than offset by the sparkling performance of Maggie Smith as the only innocent in the bunch. Smith is such a marvelous comic (and dramatic) technician she absolutely steals the movie from Harrison, that peerless light comedian, a feat that until seeing The Honey Pot I would not have thought possible. Mankiewicz’s trio of distaff above-the-title players were, when they saw the results, not best pleased. They thought they were the stars.\n\nThat title, by the way, is pretty lousy but Mankiewicz’ original, The Tale of the Fox, wasn’t much better. According to Kenneth L. Geist, Mankiewicz’s biographer, The Honey Pot was conceived and written as a much more ambitious and reflective movie, in which the conventions of filmmaking in general (and this movie in particular) are commented on satirically on film and in voice-over, somewhat as W.C. Fields did in Never Give a Sucker an Even Break but with even greater daring and brio. It sounds fascinating, and far more interesting than what, under the aegis of the nervous literalists at United Artists, Mankiewicz ended up with.\n\nFunny Lady (1975) is perhaps the greatest single argument I’ve ever seen against long-term movie contracts. Barbra Streisand owed Ray Stark one more picture under hers, and this entirely unnecessary follow-up to Funny Girl was what they came up with. To her debit, Streisand liked the hard-edged Fanny Brice of the Jay Presson Allen/Arnold Schulman screenplay, which in no way reflects the nice woman Brice reputedly was. But then her second husband Billy Rose (James Caan) wasn’t the man the movie depicts either. The picture mixes up the dates outrageously, and in the cynical near certainty that no one who shelled out $2.50 to see Funny Lady would know the difference except perhaps some of the show-biz savvy fags in the audience whom the filmmakers had nothing but contempt for anyway. Thus Roddy McDowall is wasted as Bobby Moore, Fanny’s chorus-boy-friend-cum-secretary while serving as the butt of ugly comments by Rose. The entire thing is schizophrenic: A gay-courting near-drag-show with musical numbers seemingly enacted by a self-conscious Streisand impersonator that simultaneously loathes queers and insults them relentlessly. Well, what can one expect from a project directed and choreographed by a professional closet-case like Herbert Ross?\n\nThe last time we see Bobby it’s in a portrait on Fanny’s piano, a well-known publicity shot from The Poseidon Adventure in which McDowall sports his chief steward’s costume. That should give you some idea of the movie’s concern with verisimilitude. But that’s as nothing compared to the haphazard way years (and shows) are depicted in Funny Lady. The movie has Brice meeting Rose in the 1930s when the two were already married by 1929, and Fanny (as she puts it) “falling in like” with Billy during the production of their revue Crazy Quilt, produced in fact years after they were wed. And then there’s the matter of her pining endlessly, and fruitlessly, after dreary old Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif). At least she’s allowed, finally, to feel nothing for him, but not until the picture’s last third. There’s so much wrong with Funny Lady that it’s almost impossible to find anything about it that’s right. Once you’ve exhausted Albert Whitlock’s wonderful matte work and Streisand’s good voice and amusing way with a quip you’re left with the horrible Ray Aghayan and Bob Mackie costumes that seem designed to make her look bad, the “Don’t Rain on My Parade” rip-off number where instead of chasing her love in a tugboat she flies off in a biplane, and the movie’s absolute nadir, the Harry Warren “Great Day,” in which a turbaned Fanny stands like a Caucasian goddess while black singer-dancers writhe around below her pedestal, worshiping her. Caan seems to have been encouraged to overact appallingly, and the Kander and Ebb songs aren’t up to their usual high standard. The sole exception is the wistful “Isn’t This Better?” but it’s badly staged and lit in near total darkness. James Wong Howe’s cinematography is well below par for this peerless innovator (he was ill, and filling in for the fired Vilmos Zsigmond) and just when you think you’ve seen everything, Ben Vereen emerges in his “Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie” dance routine where, with jaw-dropping insensitivity, he’s dressed to resemble a watermelon, all whites and garish greens and pinks.\n\nCaan, whose occasional vocals were derided by record critics when the soundtrack album was released, actually sings with an exceptionally pleasant light baritone. But the way Billy Rose has been written is an insult to the people to whose songs he routinely added his own name when he’d been little more than a lyrical editor. E.Y. Harburg said Rose was a great editor but that’s not the same as writing a lyric, and to hear Caan’s Billy Rose berating the Crazy Quilt chorus performing Harburg and Harold Arlen’s “It’s Only a Paper Moon” (a song that wasn’t even from that show) for not respecting “his” words is insufferable. If ever a lyric reflected Harburg’s sensibilities, it was that one. And the poor man was still alive when this atrocity taking his credit away hit the screens. What a thrill that must have been for him.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nPost-Script on Funny Lady, March 2023\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNote: For fuller reviews of some of the movies below, click on the highlighted titles.\n\n“The Sign of Four / The Hound of the Baskervilles” (1983) A pair of Sherlock Holmes adaptations by Charles Edward Pogue for British television starring the irreplaceable Ian Richardson which, while not precisely faithful to Conan Doyle, are rich in atmosphere and, in Richardson, boast perhaps the finest Holmes before Jeremy Brett sealed the franchise.\n\nUnderworld U.S.A. (1961) Mediocre Samuel Fuller is still worth watching, although we might have expected better of a former ace crime reporter than this half-baked yarn concerning revenge served at freezing temperature. But then, the picture dates from an uncertain period for Fuller, the years wherein he meandered between the sting of House of Bamboo (1955) and Forty Guns (1957) and the astonishment of Shock Corridor (1963) and The Naked Kiss (1964). Most of the Fuller pictures from that time are curios, quasi-successful but tamer affairs than those that came before. This one, suggested by some Saturday Evening Post pieces by Joseph F. Dinneen, has its moments but the plot isn’t feasible in the slightest, the romance seems shoe-horned in, and I don’t buy Cliff Robertson as a hardened criminal for a moment. (But then, I don’t buy Robertson as pretty much anything.) Much better are Beatrice Kay as his surrogate mother, David Kent as his adolescent self, Dolores Dorn as his would-be paramour, Larry Gates as the cop-turned-D.A. who’d like to nail the mobsters and set Robertson straight, and Richard Rust as a smiling, sweet-faced sadist who seems to literally seduce Robertson into the mob; their initial meetings feel like an extended courtship dance.\n\nDespite some beautiful set-ups (the cinematographer was Hal Mohr) and a few effective scenes, Underworld USA ultimately has too many sequences like Rust’s running-down of a little girl on her bicycle: Fuller doesn’t show the killing, only the child’s mother calling to her from an upstairs window and the girl (Joni Beth Morris) looking back just before impact. Instead of enhancing the horror, these rather studied choices diminish it; they’re like the worst of Hitchcock — which is bad enough only a fool would emulate it. Like Verboten!, Run of the Arrow, The Crimson Kimono, Hell and High Water and Merrill’s Marauders, Underworld USA is less a good movie than a collection of some good scenes in search of a better place to go.\n\nScorpio (1973) An avis of increasing rarity, the intelligent thriller, anchored by the performances of Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon and the magnificent Paul Scofield.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s extraordinary debut as a writer/director, a masterpiece of detective fiction featuring Humphrey Bogart’s breakthrough performance as Sam Spade.\n\nThe Man Who Would Be King (1975) Another of John Huston’s group quests toward ultimate failure, a tangy adaptation of Kipling with a superb trio of leading players in Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer.\n\nA Study in Terror (1965) A clever, if implausible, mating of Sherlock Holmes with the Jack the Ripper mythos, which isn’t a patch on the later Murder by Decree (1978) but which boasts an excellent Holmes in the person of the classical actor John Neville, later immortalized as Baron Munchausen by Terry Gilliam. Donald Houston is a good Watson, the splendid Anthony Quayle an excellent Doctor Murray, Frank Finlay in a part he reprised in Murder by Decree is an intelligent(!) Lestrade, and it’s fascinating to see a very young Judi Dench in a pivotal role. The boxer Terry Downes has a sexy, and surprisingly well acted, cameo role, and John Scott composed an effective score which, even when it brings in bongo drums(!!) does so in a way that feels wholly appropriate.\n\nThe cinematography by Desmond Dickinson is a bit on the bland side, period television color where chiaroscuro was called for, and James Hill’s direction, while brisk and effective, lacks the sick-making horror the subject demands. Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the movie is Georgia Brown, the original Nancy of the musical Oliver!, whose warm whiskey-contralto has long been a favored sound in my home. She shows up twice, as a pub singer in Whitechapel (presumably on the basis of her performance of the Lionel Bart song “Oom-Pah-Pah” in Oliver!) and if you only listen, she’s perfect. Her face, alas, explains why others got to play her stage roles in movies. She grew into her looks eventually and became a handsome older woman, but in 1966 hers was not the type of physiognomy guaranteed to queue up the paying customers.\n\nThe Life of Émile Zola (1937) I first encountered this all-too-typical Warner Bros. biopic on television in my early adolescence, and all I really remembered was the material dealing with Captain Dreyfus. Seeing it again, now, I understand why: It’s one of the few inherently dramatic portions of the narrative. While the picture’s Dreyfuss (Joseph Schildkraut) was whitewashed — it was his arrogance of personality as much as the fact of his Jewishness that precipitated his false arrest and cynical imprisonment — and the anti-Semitism downplayed, at least the subsequent trial of Zola for J’Accuse has spark, courtesy in part of Donald Crisp as the outraged attorney Labori. Those who have complained that the scapegoating of Dreyfus in the picture is depicted as entirely devoid of religious bigotry have apparently never noticed (and I admit it is fast) the juxtaposition of the insert-shot of the Captain’s file reading, “Religion: Jewish” with Harry Davenport’s line damning him as, of two suspects, the man to charge with treason. The implication is entirely obvious. But what can be expected of people who for decades have sung hosannas to Paul Muni’s unconscionably hammy performance as Zola? His constant shameless mugging for the camera indicates a self-regard so thorough an audience has little need to bother; he clearly thinks he’s adorable enough, why should we make it redundant?\n\nL’affaire Dreyfus eats up so much screen time — and at that omits the role of Alfred’s older brother, promoting the idea that it was his wife who most successfully pressed the case for his innocence — that it would have made more sense to focus on it entirely rather than to attempt squeezing in the rest of Zola’s biography, and with such brevity; his early decades here are a whirl-wind of narrative cliché and the people (his wife, Alexandrine, played by Gloria Holden; Morris Carnovsky’s Anatole France; Grant Mitchell’s Clemenceau; and Vladimir Sokoloff’s Cézanne) are little more than names and attitudes. That it took no fewer than three scenarists (Heinz Herald, Geza Herczeg and Norman Reilly Raine) to bake the thin crust upon which the insufficient filling of this movie rests says something… although just what, I couldn’t say. Gale Sondergaard struggles valiantly with the underwritten role of Lucie Dreyfus and at least retains her dignity, but Schildkraut (who, rather unbelievably, won an Oscar for this) is reduced to little more than periodically screaming, “I’m innocent! I’m innocent!” He does get one nice scene, however, when, freed at last after a decade on Devil’s Island he repeatedly hits the open doorway inviting him back to the outside world, turns, and retreats to his hated cell; in that moment you know everything you need to about the learned behavior of prisoners. The picture’s director, William Dieterle, does what he can with the material, and it is at least a very brisk movie, with very few longueurs despite its 116-minute running-time. Tony Gaudio’s black-and-white cinematography is rich, and beautifully lit; on the big screen in 1937 it must have seemed luminous.\n\nUnforgiven (1992) Clint Eastwood’s award-winning Western, a beautiful, even poetic, rumination on the cost of killing.\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971) The damn near perfect adaptation of Larry McMurtry’s suberb coming-of-age novel by McMurtry and the director Peter Bogdanovich.\n\nBig Jake (1971) Enjoyable late-period John Wayne, with an intelligent script and a savory performance by Richard Boone as the story’s mercenary central miscreant.\n\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes (1983) A badly muddled misfire purportedly adapted from Ray Bradbury’s magical literary fantasy.\n\nCalifornia Split (1974) Robert Altman’s first feature utilizing the 8-track recording system that made Nashville possible, a genial character study of two degenerate gamblers played charmingly by George Segal and Elliott Gould.\n\nThe Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (1963) An atmospheric and intelligent rendition, from Walt Disney, of Russell Thorndyke’s 18th century rogue Dr. Syn starring a splendid Patrick McGoohan.\n\nTargets (1967/1968) Peter Bogdanovich’s extraordinary, disturbing first feature as a writer-director anatomizing both the sick state of Hollywood and the weird anomie of a serial killer is all too relevant to 21st century America.\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954) Walt Disney’s first movie to be filmed in CinemaScope — it was also in 4-track stereo — 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was at the time one of the most expensive Hollywood productions ever attempted (between $5 and $9 million, imagine) and had it flopped would have been disastrous to the studio. The picture turned out so well it was one of the two top-grossers of its year, earning $28 million in 1954. And if it is less than absolutely ideal, especially in its confusingly British-Christian characterization of Jules Verne’s Sikh Captain Nemo, the movie is technically almost without a flaw, beautifully designed and shot, lengthy but involving, with literally marvelous art and set decoration (Peter Ellenshaw contributed some typically beautiful matte paintings)* and a splendid quartet of above-the-title actors. It’s the perfect Boy’s Adventure movie: Rich color photography by Franz Planer (his underwater and day-for-night effects are especially pleasing), an exciting score by Paul J. Smith, assured direction by Richard Fleischer, and an intelligent, often witty, adapted screenplay by Earl Felton that combine to form an exceptionally enjoyable night’s entertainment and in which human conflict, interior as well as exterior, are not elided.\n\nAside from the presence of the seal Sophie (that she needed water we never see her enter or exit from is evident from her shiny and obviously moistened skin) and the now-questionable “humor” of black cannibals getting zapped by Nemo’s protective electricity (why was it considered funny then?) the humor is refreshingly adult and mostly supplied by Kirk Douglas as the harpoonist Ned Land and Peter Lorre as Paul Henried’s assistant. Douglas also gets to sing a nifty ditty by Al Hoffman and Norman Gimbel called “A Whale of a Tale” which becomes one of the movie’s leitmotifs and makes a nice, belated compensation for his having left, in 1944, the original cast of On the Town, where he had the lead. James Mason is so good as Nemo you forgive Disney for messing with the original. That superb light baritone of Mason’s, combined with his elliptical speech patterns and highly idiosyncratic line readings, make him commanding, tragic and ironic at once.\n\nThe special effects, all of course in those days done by hand, are deeply impressive even now, with only one or two indifferent rear-screen bits muffing the whole. Walt produced this one himself, and his acumen shows: When the fight with the giant squid, originally shot against a red sunset on a static sea, both proved lifeless and revealed too many of the technicians’ wires, Disney suggested they re-shoot it at night, and during a storm at sea. It made all the difference; overnight, as it were, a poor sequence became a classic.\n\n* The picture won Oscars for Best Art Direction – Color (John Meehan, Emile Kuri) and Best Special Effects (John Hench, Joshua Meador), although according to Wikipedia, “the movie’s primary art designer, Harper Goff, who designed the Nautilus, was not a member of the Art Directors Union in 1954 and therefore, under a bylaw within the Academy of Motion Pictures… was unable to receive his Academy Award for Art Direction.”\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939) 20th Century Fox’s immediate follow-up to its The Hound of the Baskervilles, released earlier in 1939, proves what a fluke the studio’s first Holmes picture was. Allegedly based on the William Gillette play, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes bears no resemblance to it, nor to the 1916 movie in which Gillette himself starred. Although the picture has a fine, foggy atmosphere — Leon Shamroy was the cinematographer — the narrative is asinine, and even insulting; two of Holmes’ typical lines are, “Whatever Watson has found out, you’ll know inevitably. I have unbounded confidence in his lack of discretion” and (to Nigel Bruce as the Doctor) “I’m afraid you’re an incorrigible bungler.” It concerns the machinations of a bearded(!) Professor Moriarty (George Zucco) to humiliate Holmes, by whom he is eventually thrown off the Tower of London(!!) and Zucco has a high old time of it, all but baring his fangs and gnashing his teeth. In the supporting cast, Terry Kilburn is a good Billy, Mary Forbes charming as a matron, Anthony Kemble-Cooper has a nice turn as a gentle upper-class twit avant la lettre, and Basil Rathbone has an enjoyable bit in disguise as a music hall entertainer. But Ida Lupino is wasted as the damsel in distress and the movie is both lumpy and formless. The director of this flavorless mélange was someone named Alfred L. Werker; this was probably his only well-remembered movie. Nowhere in the credits of the picture will you see the name of Arthur Conan Doyle… for which omission I presume his heirs were duly grateful.\n\nHealtH (1979/1982) An often very amusing political satire directed by Robert Altman involving the race for president of a health convention. It’s an allegory about Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson, with Lauren Bacall as a narcoleptic 83-year old virgin (Ike) and Glenda Jackson as a prating intellectual (Stevenson) who talks, dryly and utterly without emotion, through everything and everyone. Paul Dooley is an obnoxious hypocrite of a third-party candidate who is a mass of prejudices and whose shtick is holding his breath under water, Carol Burnett is very funny as a representative of the President — since the picture was filmed in 1979, presumably Jimmy Carter — and James Garner is only slightly less so as her estranged husband, working for Bacall. Donald Moffat shows up in a sinister performance as Bacall’s frightening brother; Henry Gibson is a political operative whose first sequence in drag as an old woman is so convincing you almost wonder who that interesting actress is; Diane Stilwell is Jackson’s secretary who can’t type and who has supplied Jackson with a portable tape recorder, with which she is pretty obviously in love; MacIntyre Dixon is marvelous as the convention manager; Alfre Woodard is the hotel’s determinedly sunny convention representative vexed by this unmanageable collection of loons; Ann Ryerson is Bacall’s physician who lacks the ability to enjoy sex; the singing group The Steinettes appear throughout the movie, singing brightly and inanely at every conceivable opportunity; and Dick Cavett plays himself, vainly attempting to interview Bacall and Jackson and perennially frustrated by Bacall’s unexpected sleeping fits (if that isn’t an oxymoron.) Altman and Dooley wrote the sharp screenplay with Frank Barhydt, and it’s a relaxed, cheery, sometimes hilarious ensemble comedy. Why any of the people involved thought that a satire on Eisenhower and Stevenson was relevant to anything, or anyone, in 1979 remains a mystery, but everyone in the picture is terrific with the notable exception of Bacall. We watch her thinking we know she was famous for something once, but from her performance we can’t recall just what; after 1966 she always seemed to be playing the paralyzed rich-bitch from Harper — she’d become all surface, the grande dame in her element. What the hell happened to that woman? She was better at 19, when she knew almost nothing about acting.\n\nMatewan (1988) John Sayles’ achingly beautiful evocation of a violent, largely forgotten incident of the 1920s involving West Virginia miners arrayed against vicious coal industry gun-thugs, one of the key movies of its decade.\n\nCasualties of War (1989) A deeply unsettling examination of an American atrocity in Vietnam directed by Brian De Palma which is best when it sticks to the facts but is never less than compelling even when it’s embracing war movie clichés that would have embarrassed John Wayne.\n\nThe Little Drummer Girl (1984) This surprisingly good attempt by the screenwriter Loring Mandel and the stylish journeyman director George Roy Hill at condensing one of John Le Carré’s large, complex thrillers is compromised but, curiously, not undone, by its central miscasting. With her signature red hair and championing of Palestinian rights, the actress Charlie in the novel was obviously meant to remind readers of Vanessa Redgrave. Unlike Redgrave (or Diane Keaton, the Charlie of the movie) it was central to the Le Carré novel that Charlie was young, in her early 20s, passionate but unformed, and not nearly as worldly, or as informed, as she thinks she is. Likewise, casting Yorgo Voyagis, Keaton’s junior by a year, as the Israeli agent who seduces Charlie into falling in love with him while seeming to put her off (and who becomes her guide and instructor in the elaborate “theatre of the real” the actress is enticed into against a Palestinian bomb-maker) rather than a distinguished, reticent, aging actor of the time — Paul Scofield might have been ideal, or even Dirk Bogarde or Alan Bates — eliminates Charlie’s obvious father-fixation. These rather essential cavils aside, Keaton is excellent as Charlie, locating both her anger and her pain, although I don’t believe for a minute an American would be headlining a small British theatre troupe. Unlike Keaton, Klaus Kinski is an almost perfect casting choice for Kurtz, whose complicated scheme keeps Charlie, and the audience, in the dark until the climax; Kinski absolutely gets the Israeli agent’s bonhomie, his middle-aged charm and his deadly seriousness. Like the book, the movie is highly ambivalent about Zionism even as it largely accepts the more than dubious notion that violence is the proper response to terror. The strong supporting cast includes Sami Frey, Michael Cristofer, Eli Danker, Philipp Moog, Anna Massey, Thorley Walters and David Suchet. My only complaint about the production design is the truly terrible coat Keaton is forced to wear through much of the picture. She can’t carry it off, but I can’t imagine the woman who could. Such is Le Carré’s brilliance that Charlie’s last line, slightly altered from the novel, has stayed with me since I saw this one 35 years ago.\n\nThieves Like Us (1974) As Pauline Kael once suggested of him, Robert Altman made two bad movies for every good one, and in-between another that was essentially lousy but with enough good, or even great, moments in it to sustain your interest. Examples of this last include The Long Goodbye, Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Short Cuts, Gosford Park… and Thieves Like Us; it has some splendid things in it, and is beautifully cast, and shot. But it’s both elliptical and repetitive in weird and off-putting ways, and you sit there wondering what you’ve missed when you haven’t missed a thing. In the sequence in which the movie’s young central characters Bowie (Keith Carradine) and Keechie (Shelley Duvall) make love for the first time while listening to a radio broadcast of Romeo and Juliet, for example, and we hear the same between-act announcement from the narrator at three separate intervals, we don’t know what it means. Is the sequence a fantasy of Keechie’s or Bowie’s? Is one scene real and the other two fantastic? But because they don’t seem to be anything other than what they appear to be — sequential moments broken up in the cutting — nothing about these scenes really supports that hypothesis. So why did Altman choose to disorient us at this important juncture? Why, for that matter, is there a discussion between Carradine, Bert Remsen and Ann Latham in which it seems Bowie and Keechie have become notorious Bonnie and Clyde figures, their doings reported in the newspapers, when we have seen no such thing? It feels as though there’s a reel missing, or at least a few scenes. Speaking of which, why is Remsen’s violent death only spoken about, in a radio news story, and not seen? The omission feels like narrative cheapness. Kael said of Thieves Like Us that it was, “the closest to flawless of Altman’s films — a masterpiece.” What movie did she see?\n\nThe picture was shot on location in Mississippi, which Altman was told was “the asshole of America” but which he and his French cinematographer Jean Boffety found beautiful, and their fondness for the place and the people shows; the look of the movie is almost like a living Impressionist painting. The excellent cast includes John Shuck, Louise Fletcher, Al Scott, Tom Skerritt and Joan Tewkesbury, who also collaborated with Altman on the script and would write Nashville for him. (She’s the woman at the train station Duvall talks to at the end). Calder Willingham also worked on the screenplay, based on the 1937 Edward Anderson novel which originally provided the basis for the 1950 They Live by Night, directed by Nicholas Ray.\n\nThree Days of the Condor (1975) Although Three Days of the Condor rather needlessly complicates the novelist James Grady’s original plot, there are some real compensations, not least of which is intelligence.\n\nThe Thief and the Cobbler (1993/2013) Richard Williams’ astonishing animated Arabian Nights feature, still incomplete but reconstructed by Garrett Gilchrist in his Recobbled Cut Mark 4.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery (1978) Michael Crichton’s The Great Train Robbery (known in Britain as The First Great Train Robbery, to distinguish its action in the minds of potential ticket-buyers from the much more contemporaneous, and well-remembered, “Great Train Robbery” of 1963) is one of those richly appointed, beautifully shot and wonderfully cast entertainments that make for a wry, exciting evening’s amusement as long as you know that, while depicting on an actual incident, the picture is largely fictional and should be taken as such. Based on the 1855 theft of gold from a moving train, and on the writer/director’s own novel, the picture is a cheery, funny escapade with some sharp digs at the British upper class, and glorious production design that puts you absolutely in Victorian era London (although it was shot largely in Ireland.) Sean Connery is the ersatz nobleman of dubious means, suave but dangerous, who plans and executes the theft; Lesley-Anne Down is his actress lover who proves useful in a number of necessary diversions; Donald Sutherland, often hilarious, is the safe-cracker; and Wayne Sleep is the ill-fated criminal acrobat who runs afoul of Connery.\n\nCrichton’s direction is elegant and wonderfully paced; he seems always to know exactly where to place the camera. Jerry Goldsmith composed one of his most distinctive scores for the picture, anchored to a charming waltz he then transforms into variants: Slowed down it evokes the atmosphere of London’s mean streets, simplified it becomes a romantic lyre accompaniment for Connery and Down’s bedroom scenes and sped up it’s rousing background music for the robbery. One of the movie’s great pleasures is the lush widescreen color cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth, to whom Crichton dedicated it. A painter with light, Unsworth shot some of the most sumptuous looking movies of the 1960s and ‘70s: Becket (1964), the Olivier Othello (1965), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Olivier’s Three Sisters (1970), Cabaret (1972), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), Royal Flash (1975), The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Superman (1978) and Tess (1979). The fine supporting cast includes Alan Webb, Pamela Salem, Gabrielle Lloyd and Malcolm Terris as a smug, hypocritical bank official. The final joke has no basis in historical reality, but takes the movie out on a high, and very funny, note.\n\nHeat (1995) Michael Mann’s complex, character-driven heist movie has the texture of a sun-lit nightmare: L.A. as a warm place to die a chilly death.\n\nThe Thrill of it All (1963) A shrill, occasionally funny farce, meant to satirize television advertising but so dishonest about that it merely gums the subject rather aggressively. Doris Day is an obstetrician’s wife who gets corralled into performing impromptu cleanser commercials for a cheesy live drama omnibus show (in 1963?) and finds her marriage on rocky (or, if you prefer, soapy) ground. It’s too ephemeral to take seriously for a moment — The Glass Bottom Boat had more gravitas — but it’s a pretty thin gruel to have come from the combined talents of Carl Reiner (screenplay) and Larry Gelbart (story, with Reiner). Some of the scenes have that terrible look so representative of the era’s color television episodes, but the cinematographer, Russell Metty, occasionally gets in some pleasant lighting. It would have been almost impossible at that time to imagine the director, Norman Jewison, ever making movies as rich as In the Heat of the Night and Fiddler on the Roof, but at least his pacing is brisk.\n\nJames Garner brings his usual charm and comic outrage to the husband, and the supporting cast includes Reiner (in several bits), Arlene Francis, Edward Andrews, Reginald Owen (playing Andrews’ father, the sort of role Andrews himself would corner in the coming years), Zasu Pitts as a rape-obsessed housekeeper, Elliott Reid as an advertising man, Alice Pearce, Herbie Faye, Hayden Rorke, Burt Mustin, Robert Strauss, Lennie Weinrib, Lillian Culver, King Donovan, Bernie Kopell and, in a voice-over, Paul Frees. I could also swear I heard Madge Blake’s voice, but can find no proof of her participation. Brian Nash and Kym Karath play Day and Garner’s small children; Karath is best remembered as Gretl, the tiniest of the Trapp Family Singers of The Sound of Music two years later. The picture is inoffensive, even with its dated attitudes toward women in the workplace; the one absolutely unforgivable element is the appalling, mickeymouse musical score by (Frank) De Vol.\n\nAlias Nick Beal (1949) A dark political fantasy that, on balance, seemed designed to satisfy everyone who ever thought a politician had sold his soul, which is pretty much all of us. (Today people like Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton don’t even bother to hide their corruption; they display it openly, and their worshipers call us names if we say anything about it.) Beautifully directed by John Farrow and with a brisk, intelligent screenplay by Jonathan Latimer from a story by Mindret Lord, the movie is so sharply observed it puts to shame all the cringe-making, faux-populist projects of Frank Capra, a man with a deep distrust of “the people” even as he desperately kept trying to woo them. Thomas Mitchell plays the crusading District Attorney who in his frustration at being unable to nail a mobster makes a casual wish he never expected to have granted, and Ray Milland is “Nick Beal,” the Satanic figure with the means to deliver. Mitchell gives his usual fine performance, and Audrey Totter is excellent as a good/bad girl, but Milland really delivers. There was always something a little unpleasant about him as an actor that lingered below his surface charm. Billy Wilder tapped it in The Lost Weekend, and Farrow really mines it here. Lionel Lindon’s cinematography, even in a bad print, is rich and atmospheric, and about the only miscalculation in this 82-minute gem is the uncharacteristic, almost shockingly emphatic, score by the otherwise subtle Franz Waxman. With Fred Clark as a machine boss, Geraldine Wall as Mitchell’s saintly wife, a very young Darryl Hickman as a reform-school candidate and George Macready as, of all things, a minister. (Thanks for this one, Eliot M. Camarena!)\n\nCitizen Kane (1941) I ended one year, and began another, with the same film. It isn’t among my very favorite pictures, nor even my favorite among those of its co-author, director and star. But Orson Welles‘ debut is still among the most enjoyable movies ever made, and it yields new pleasures and unexpected contours with every viewing. This time I noticed, for the first time, the way Welles keeps the lighted window at Xanadu in the same spot throughout the prologue, even when it’s a reflection in water. That may not be strictly logical, but it certainly is impressive.\n\nText copyright 2019 by Scott Ross"
