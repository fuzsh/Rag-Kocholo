        "text": "Gary Leffew is a former World Champion Bull Rider ~ PRCA Hall of Fame Inductee ~ 8 time NFR qualifier~ NFR average winner and past Bull Riding Director of the PRCA.\n\nThrough his unique, progressive and holistic training techniques... Gary's School has produced more PRCA, PBR, Canadian, NHSRA Champions and Finals qualifiers than any other bull riding school in the Nation. There isn't another of it's kind!\n\n\" After being in a slump for six months, a friend told me about a book by Maxwell Maltz, titled: Psyco-cybernetics. It changed my life! This book started my journey into the mental side of riding bulls and taught me (and a lot of other negative bull riders) that riding is really a mental game. \"Choose this theme to customize and add content to this page.\n\n​Of the hundred's of 1st place wins I had throughout the United States and Canada, there is one thing I am most proud of.......\n\nI competed at the top 25 paying Rodeos, where the pressure is the most intense, the stock is the toughest; riding against the greatest bull riders in the business.\n\nAfter a positive thinking program taught me how to keep my mental attitude and riding mechanics at a peak performance level, I ended up making 24 trips to the Winner's Circle at those elite Rodeos. I rode 9 of 10 bulls to win the NFR average and I won the World's Championship.\n\n12 of my former students have won a World's Championship.\n\nTwo of my other students won the PBR World Finals at the age of 19.\n\nI Know Bull Riding! I know what it's going to take to make you a winner. I will steer you away from all the false information being pushed out there, that will cause you to fall short. And I will teach you techniques that are proven to help you reach your goals!! ~ Gary Leffew"
