        "text": "01 of 15\n\nPaterson, Paterson (2016)\n\nIn Paterson, Driver plays his gentlest character to date in Jim Jarmusch's quiet meditation on the beauty of everyday life. His character, a bus driver named Paterson in the New Jersey city of the same name, is an aspiring poet, converting mundane experiences into fragments of artistic expression as he scribbles in his notebook on lunch breaks.\n\nExtended scenes of silent observation don't sound dramatically compelling on paper, but Driver watches and listens to the world around him with such kindness and careful attention that his very presence in a room somehow feels noble and important. He's an actor known for his explosiveness, but he's never been more restrained than he is here.\n\nWhere to watch Paterson: Freevee\n\n02 of 15\n\nCharlie Barber, Marriage Story (2019)\n\nDriver has worked with Noah Baumbach more than any other filmmaker — he held small roles in Frances Ha (2012) and The Meyerowitz Stories (2017); a significant supporting part in While We're Young (2014); and a lead role in White Noise (2022). However, their most notable collaboration, loosely based on Baumbach's divorce, spawned memes aplenty and an Oscar nomination for one of Driver's most nuanced performances. His character Charlie is a narcissistic theater director who cares more about his work than his family, which naturally makes us sympathize with his wife, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), when she begins divorce proceedings. But Charlie isn't totally checked-out — Driver imbues him with a certain charm and magnetism from the very beginning, and though his efforts to maintain a healthy relationship are scattered, they feel genuine nonetheless.\n\nAs Marriage Story progresses, we spend more time with Charlie and discover that he's even more complicated and conflicted than we first assume: His raw anger makes him a frightening partner and boss, but his vulnerability and pain create a tenuous sense of sympathy despite his cruelty. We understand how he got into his unenviable situation, but we still pity his place there.\n\nWhere to watch Marriage Story: Netflix\n\n03 of 15\n\nFlip Zimmerman, BlacKkKlansman (2018)\n\nSpike Lee's troubling crime dramedy BlacKkKlansman asks Driver to give a performance within a performance, where he must play a relatively nice guy pretending to be a racist monster. When Black police officer Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) connects with local members of the Ku Klux Klan over the phone, he accidentally gives them his real name, which means his co-worker Flip Zimmerman (Driver) must pose as Stallworth in face-to-face meetings.\n\nHe has to be convincing enough that the other Klansmen believe his false persona, but stiff enough to create dramatic tension for the audience that knows he's putting on a façade — if he were 100% natural playing Stallworth, there wouldn't be much worthwhile conflict because we'd have no reason to worry about him. Driver fills his layered performance with verbal and physical discomfort so that all his infiltration scenes feel a little forced and over-the-top, but still maintains enough composure that the antagonists can believably overlook his deception.\n\nWhere to rent BlacKkKlansman: Amazon Prime Video\n\n04 of 15\n\nKylo Ren, Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nDriver is wonderful as Kylo Ren in all three of Disney/Lucasfilm's Star Wars sequel trilogy, as the movies channel his brooding physique and unpredictable temperament into one of the franchise's most enticing villains. His most electrifying performance comes in the middle chapter, The Last Jedi. He's more morally gray and conflicted than we're used to seeing in Star Wars characters, which is part of what makes this installment such a unique piece of the Star Wars tapestry.\n\nKylo is pulled between the light and dark sides of the Force, and Driver's anguish and fury make the tension between the two sides seem torturous and lonely. It seems as though he and Rey (Daisy Ridley) could conceivably start their own neutral order of Force users that rejects the light/dark binary of their predecessors — and their bizarrely stirring sense of chemistry makes you want them to do it against your better judgment. The duo's thrilling action sequence in the throne room gives a rare glimpse of Driver as an action star, as he swings his lightsaber with a chaotic brutality that's noticeably distinct from the usual precision of a Jedi.\n\nWhere to watch Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi: Disney+\n\n05 of 15\n\nHenry McHenry, Annette (2021)\n\nOne of Driver's most despicable characters is his self-absorbed stand-up comedian Henry McHenry in Leos Carax's bizarre musical. Henry is an abusive partner and an exploitative father, and the actor has no problem embodying him without an ounce of sympathy. He becomes more vile with every subsequent scene, but you can't look away because you're so invested in his downfall.\n\nAnnette is the best showcase to date for Driver's musical talents — as he sings the haunting original songs by Sparks, it's clear that his voice isn't quite as refined as a professional singer or a Broadway star, but as he demonstrated in Marriage Story's karaoke scene, it's incredibly emotive and powerful, full of character and nuances that a more conventional vocalist might lack.\n\nWhere to watch Annette: Amazon Prime Video\n\n06 of 15\n\nFrancisco Garupe, Silence (2016)\n\nIn Martin Scorsese's harrowing historical drama Silence, the actor plays Francisco Garupe, a Jesuit priest who travels to Japan with Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) to find their mentor (Liam Neeson). Driver lost around 50 pounds and trained with a Jesuit priest to inform his performance.\n\nGarfield and Driver bring tense complexity to the relationship between their characters — they frequently disagree about the right course of action, and they're constantly torn between desperation and resolve. But they also provide a sense of companionship and security for each other that's much more apparent when they're separated, allowing despair to settle in.\n\nWhere to watch Silence: Hoopla\n\n07 of 15\n\nAllan, What If (2013)\n\nAlso called The F Word internationally, Michael Dowse's lighthearted rom-com casts Driver as an enormous, goofy wingman to Daniel Radcliffe's romantic lead. It's the kind of simpleton role you'd expect Jason Segel or Vince Vaughn to play, but much, much stranger — a character who belittles the protagonist and casually espouses romantic wisdom.\n\nHe's comically aggressive and totally unpredictable, randomly speaking Spanish, stroking his costars' faces, and bellowing lines like \"I just had sex and I'm about to eat NACHOS\" from the top of his lungs. He also has great oddball romantic chemistry with Mackenzie Davis, the movie's other chaotic sidekick.\n\nWhere to watch What If: Showtime via Paramount+\n\n08 of 15\n\nJacques Le Gris, The Last Duel (2021)\n\nIn 2021, the actor starred in two ensemble movies directed by Ridley Scott, and though House of Gucci was the bigger commercial success, Driver's performance in The Last Duel is the stronger of the two. In a historical epic full of awful medieval men, Driver's character is the worst of them all.\n\nThe movie is split into three distinct chapters from three different people's perspectives, and while some characters — like Matt Damon's Sir Jean de Carrouges — seem dramatically different depending on the eyes through which we see them, Driver ensures that every iteration of his intimidating and forceful squire is totally without remorse. Even though the middle section of the movie is from his perspective, it still depicts his central act of sexual violence to be graphic, disturbing, and cruel.\n\nWhere to rent The Last Duel: Amazon Prime Video\n\n09 of 15\n\nAl Cody, Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)\n\nBefore they appeared together in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Driver and Oscar Isaac first shared the screen in the Coen brothers' heartbreaking folk saga. He's only in a few scenes, but Driver is one of the major comedic highlights of Inside Llewyn Davis.\n\nAs Al Cody, he gives a ridiculous vocal performance in the studio with the film's namesake (Isaac) and Jim Berkey (Justin Timberlake) as they perform a novelty song about space travel. The scene takes full advantage of Driver's booming, throaty voice and amplifies it to cartoonish extremes as he ad-libs outer space gobbledygook and makes sci-fi sound effects.\n\nWhere to rent Inside Llewyn Davis: Amazon Prime Video\n\n10 of 15\n\nJamie Massey, While We're Young (2014)\n\nDriver is the embodiment of 2010s Brooklyn millennial snobbery in Baumbach's charming dramedy. His character embraces an offbeat, out-of-reach new lifestyle that the older protagonists (Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts) attempt to capture for themselves by befriending him and his partner (Amanda Seyfried).\n\nAs the film progresses, however, Driver reveals himself to be much more unappealing and immature than they see at first glance. This is a tricky balance because his performance doesn't really change as the movie goes on — Driver remains consistent and strange throughout, and the character just becomes more obviously annoying as the other characters react to him more critically.\n\nWhere to watch While We're Young: Max\n\n11 of 15\n\nClyde Logan, Logan Lucky (2017)\n\nOne of Driver's most transformative supporting performances is in Steven Soderbergh's return to the heist genre, lovingly nicknamed \"Ocean's 7-11.\" Aside from his prosthetic arm, Driver doesn't look any different from his other characters — long hair, imposing physique, lots of hats — but his temperament is so distinct from his other performances that you're likely to forget you're watching an Adam Driver movie.\n\nThe actor adopts a Southern drawl to play Clyde Logan, an Iraq War vet who robs the Charlotte Motor Speedway with his brother Jimmy (Channing Tatum). He's a character defined by comic misfortune, which the actor emphasizes with tangible irritation and occasional dismay. Driver uses a uniquely slow vocal cadence and constant visible frustration to craft a funny supporting character who's much more than meets the eye — closer to characters played by Billy Bob Thornton and Tim Blake Nelson than the actor's typical roles.\n\nWhere to watch Logan Lucky: Showtime via Paramount+\n\n12 of 15\n\nOfficer Ronnie Peterson, The Dead Don't Die (2019)\n\nDriver reteamed with Jarmusch for this offbeat horror-comedy about the zombie apocalypse encroaching on a small town. He plays a quiet, quirky police officer who's laughably unfazed by the zombie apocalypse as it unfolds around him and the chief (Bill Murray).\n\nRather than taking significant action, Driver's character just constantly repeats the refrain, \"This is all gonna end badly,\" but delivers nearly every line with the same deadpan tranquility that suggests he doesn't really care. He seems like he's thinking about something else that he never reveals, and probably has no interest in sharing, anyway.\n\nWhere to rent The Dead Don't Die: Amazon Prime Video\n\n13 of 15\n\nDaniel Jones, The Report (2019)\n\nIn Scott Z. Burns' political thriller The Report, Driver plays a Congressional staffer who's obsessive, awkward, and really good at his job. He stumbles over basic small talk interactions without being overly showy — it's just clear that he values his work far more than anything personal because work quickly becomes personal.\n\nThe whole movie is about how traumatic human rights violations are somehow converted into paperwork and impersonally approved and carried out by bureaucracy. Driver's character's passion, though, puts him in direct opposition to the supposed neutrality that the job requires — and also makes him one of the only morally upstanding characters in the entire piece.\n\nWhere to watch The Report: Freevee\n\n14 of 15\n\nRick Smolan, Tracks (2013)\n\nDriver has a significant supporting role in this Australian drama, inspired by the true story of Robyn Davidson's nine-month camelback trek across Australia. Mia Wasikowska plays the determined, standoffish lead role, and Driver portrays a National Geographic photojournalist who helps document her travels.\n\nHis character is neurotic but friendly, and has more of an aw-shucks Everyman quality than Driver's later roles. The actor employs a ton of stammering and smiling to solidify his awkward yet sunny disposition, which ultimately serves as a sharp contrast to Robyn's cold introversion.\n\nWhere to watch Tracks: Tubi\n\n15 of 15\n\nToby Grummett, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018)\n\nTerry Gilliam spent nearly 30 years trying to make his long-awaited Don Quixote movie, which combines elements from Miguel de Cervantes' 1605/1615 novel with a story about modern film production. Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor, Robert Duvall, and John Hurt were each attached at various points, but it was finally produced with Jonathan Pryce as Quixote and Driver as Toby, the filmmaker at the center of the story. Like the actor's characters in Marriage Story and Annette, Toby is a self-centered artist whose narcissism comes back to haunt him.\n\nUnlike Driver's other characters, however, Toby slowly loses his grip on reality and radically transforms as the film progresses. As in many of his other projects, Gilliam asks his lead actor to move between delirium, paranoia, and hedonism, and Driver delivers, slipping into song and a different accent as his character unravels.\n\nWhere to watch The Man Who Killed Don Quixote: Crackle"
