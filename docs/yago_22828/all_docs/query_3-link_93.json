He is remembered not only for his work but also for his courage in exposing powerful Columbia studios chief David Begelman, who had forged his name on a $10,000 check in the late 1970s.\n\nBegelman’s misappropriation of studio money caused a scandal at the time that was dubbed “Hollywoodgate” and Robertson became a hero among some industry players by risking his career to expose Begelman.\n\nBorn Clifford Parker Robertson III in La Jolla, California on September 9, 1923, he first worked in community theater in San Diego before joining the U.S. merchant marine during World War Two.\n\nLike many actors of his generation, he performed on Broadway after the war, working in shows such as “The Wisteris Trees” with Helen Hayes. He acted on television in New York and soon took his career to Hollywood, getting parts on shows such as “Ben Casey” and “The Twilight Zone.”\n\nIn 1963, he starred as Lieutenant John F. Kennedy in the naval war film “PT 109” about the military days of the young man who would become a U.S. president.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut it was the 1968 film “Charly” that brought Robertson his greatest glory, the Oscar, playing a mentally disabled man who is transformed into a genius in an experiment, only to regress to his former self.\n\nHe also won an Emmy, U.S. television’s top honor, for his work in “The Game.” He was nominated for Emmys in “Days of Wine and Roses” and “The Two Worlds of Charly Gordon,” which eventually became the movie “Charly.”\n\nRobertson worked steadily over the decades and was performing well into the 2000s. In “Spider-Man” he portrayed Ben Parker, the elderly uncle of the superhero’s alter-ego, Peter Parker.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2011\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
