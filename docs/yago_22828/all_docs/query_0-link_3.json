        "text": "CLIFF ROBERTSON has been on three airplanes already today, and he is saddlesore as he waits impatiently at Los Angeles International Airport for the 10:30 plane that will take him home to New York.\n\nDuring the last five months he has eaten nearly half his meals at airports, dropping through thunderstorms into Madison, Minneapolis, Terre Haute, Des Moines, Houston, Indianapolis, in the Beechoraft Blue Baron he pilots himself. The meals have most often been a hot dog and a cup of coffee on the way to or from some local newspaper office or radio station to promote “J. W. Coop” —a $736,000 movie which the 46‐year‐old Robertson wrote, produced, directed, and in which he stars.\n\nIt is a lovely movie—a contemporary fable of man's confrontation with change written in the dusty rings of the rodeo circuit. At its center is an impeccable performance by Cliff Robertson as an aging rodeo rider let loose on a world of truck drivers who water ski, of hippies who make peace signs out of licorice whips, of Chicanos who are the rich entrepreneurs of franchised taco parlors, a world with which he cannot quite cope after 10 years in prison for writing bad checks. At the periphery of “J. W. Coop” are errors in taste and judgment — a naive sentimentality in some of the writing and directing—that do not mar its appealing core.\n\n“J. W. Coop”—which has been almost unanimously praised by the critics—is Robertson's way of thumbing his nose at the movie executives who made him feel during his first 13 years in Hollywood that he was “living in a stream of barracudas.” It is a celluloid announcement that he can direct. “I was inhibited by this mystique—that ‘Directors are born!’ That was a way of shutting up actors who wanted to direct. Then they said that an actor can't direct himself. Baloney.”\n\nThe movie is also redress for the Time magazine journalist who tainted Robertson's 1968 Academy Award for “Charly” by claiming that it was bought by an excessive advertising campaign. “I went to the Philippines to make that bunch of junk (“Too Late the Hero”] before the nominations were announced, and I didn't get back until a month after I won the Oscar. I didn't spend one penny on advertising. The word from my journalist friends was that that Time writer was sure the odds‐on ‐favorite, Peter O'Toole, would win. So he was caught with his journalistic pants down. To this day I'm upset because he could have checked and found out that I hadn't purchased any ads.”\n\n“J. W. Coop's” budget was $736,000, the shooting schedule 33 days in 10 different towns. Robertson took the money for the two completion bonds out of his own bank account. As actor and director, he worked for scale. “As an actor, I made less than any truck driver on the film.” As writer and producer, he worked for nothing. (He never expected money for his screenplay, but he is still bitter that the Writer's Guild, after examining the screenplays involved, gave co‐screen credit to Gary Cartwright and Bud Shrake.) “I produced because Columbia said, ‘With your budget, you can't afford a producer.'” With his budget, he couldn't even afford hotel rooms. The cast—all of whom, except his close friend, Geraldine Page, worked for scale—and crew scrounged free $8‐per‐day rooms in the Best Western Motels that are prominently displayed in the film, made deals for free meals and free rental cars.\n\nWhen the film was finished and Columbia dribbled it lethargically across the country like a tablespoon of pancake batter, Robertson's involvement did not become less intense. On a typical day last February, he flew out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at 6 A.M., hitting two radio stations on his way out to the airport; flew his Beechcraft Blue Baron through a snowstorm to Green Bay; spent two hours at the local newspaper office and TV station in Green Bay; flew through the same snowstorm to Wausau and later to Madison; reached the airport in Cleveland, Ohio, at 1 A.M.; hit the local radio station on his way into the city at 1:30 A.M.; and managed three hours sleep before leaving the next morning at 6. (Robertson's wife, Post‐Toasties heiress Dina Merrill, calls his penchant for working in the hours after midnight “his damned 17th wind.” In a marriage that appears to be happy despite the totally opposite habits and pleasures of the participants, Robertson says of his wife, “beanie is the only person I know who begins to yawn before dinner.”)\n\nOf his continuing involvement with “J. W. Coop,” Robertson says, “I've been the mother and father of ‘J. W. Coop.’ I couldn't let some unfeeling wet nurse cut off its milk supply in the maternity ward.” He adds cheerfully—not a hint of dissatisfaction in his unguarded blue‐green eyes, not a hint of mockery in the raffish grin—“I will look back on all this as three‐and‐one‐half years of dedicated work where will end up not getting one penny. I'd do it again. It was a victory.” (Perhaps because of the splendid reviews, “J. W. Coop” is doing somewhat better financially than Robertson anticipated.)\n\nDespite the pyrrhic nature of his victory, Robertson does not even seem angry at Columbia's backwardness in promoting and advertising his film. “I wasn't led down the garden path. Columbia's priorities start at the picture with the biggest budget, the $8,000,000 picture. So ‘J. W. Coop’ is at the bottom of their totem pole. Given their priorities, they need to protect the thing they've got the most money in.”\n\nBut he does not hide his anger at the exhibitors. “My picture is just another can of peas on the shelf to them; and next week they have a new can. Half of them don't even bother to see the films they show. They're all going to retire in 36 months and go live in Florida. The first thing they tell me is, ‘Kid, I've been in this business 39 years,’ and right then I want to make a U‐turn and leave town. Trying to lift them out of their apathy, I feel like Knute Rockne at halftime. I begged exhibitors to have one free matinee for students because college students dig the picture and would spread the word. ‘Well, maybe we could only charge one dollar,’ they said. We did sensational business in Denver, Austin, St. Paul—wherever the local exhibitor opened his doors free of charge to a large number of college students.”\n\nThere is, among Robertson's anecdotes, one revealing exchange “with an old dude leaning against his proverbial Cadillac. Exhibitors all drive Cadillacs or Chryslers and smoke cigars.” Given 10 days’ notice of Robertson's arrival in town, the exhibitor had managed to arrange one radio interview. When Robertson demanded to see local reporters, the exhibitor drawled, “Boy, don't go off half‐cocked. This is my town.”\n\n“But it's my picture.” “It's just a picture.” “The hell it is. It's a way of life.”\n\nWhy it is a way of life has much to do with the 13 years from 1955, when Robertson left the Actors Studio, to 1968, when he made “Charly.” He spent those 13 years starring in such dismal films as “Autumn Leaves,” “Gidget,” “Battle of the Coral Sea,” “The Girl Most Likely” and “My Six Loves.”\n\n“Nobody,” Robertson says accurately, “made more mediocre films than I did. Nobody ever did such a wide variety of mediocrity.”\n\nIt was not entirely Hollywood's fault. It is probably no accident that Robertson made his film debut playing the handsome, dull, home‐town boy to William Holden's roving stud in “Picnic.” Even the words that can be used to describe Robertson sound anachronistic to the tongue, like words collected from some old‐fashioned children's story: Handsome, Steadfast, Manly, HardWorking, Diffident. On the screen at least, he lacks the dangerous excitement, the unpredictability, that made major stars of Steve McQueen, Robert Redford, Paul Newman.\n\nRobertson, who has something of an excess of positive thinking, insists that he never felt undervalued. “I simply always felt there are some people destined for the quick knockout and some of us destined to score the victory in the later rounds.”\n\nWhatever victories he was scoring in the early 1960's were on Broadway and in television. He created the role in Tennessee Williams’ “Orpheus Descending” which Marlon Brando recreated on the screen. Paul Newman won an Academy Award nomination for the role Robertson played first on TV in “The Hustler,” as did Jack Lemmon for Robertson's part in “Days of Wine and Roses.” Meanwhile, the height — or depth — of Robertson's movie career\n\n“THE PUBLIC EYE”— Mir Farrow, a moody American, is trailed by Topol, a detective hired by her jealous British husband. Carol Reed's movie, co‐starring Michael Jayston, opens Tuesday at the Playboy and 68th St. Playhouse. came in 1963 when President Kennedy chose him to play Lieutenant John F. Kennedy in “PT‐109.”\n\nBy 1963, Robertson had already spent two years trying to peddle a television play in which he had starred. “I kept getting calls from Hollywood. ‘Cliff, baby, we hear you have the movie rights to ‘The Two Worlds of Charly Gordon: I said, ‘Yeah, but I go with them: They said, ‘We'll call you back.’ Seven years later they still hadn't called back.’\n\nHe had bought the film rights to “The Two Worlds of Charly Gordon” out of pain and anger at always having other actors snatch away his best roles. “While we were rehearsing for the television show, I couldn't sleep. This pattern of always a trial horse, never able to race, was painfully redundant. I called my accountant and told him to buy the movie rights. He said, ‘You're crazy,’ but I told him this time I had to go to the mountain.”\n\n“Going to the mountain” is a phrase Robertson uses often—his calm, western voice implying some bedrock of faith and confidence in himself. There is, in the unexciting flatness of his language, some hint to the flaws in “J. W. Coop.” But many of the virtues of the film too—the lack of cruelty, the sweetness, the old‐fashioned polite respect for its characters—spring from the man who conceived it.\n\nWhen “The Two Worlds of Charly Gordon” finally became “Charly,” Robertson, of course won an Academy Award. Perhaps no actor or actress has made less capital out of an Oscar.\n\nAs Robertson remembers it, the conversation with his agent after the award went approximately as follows.\n\n“Now we build the platforms, Cliff, baby. Two pictures a year for the next four years”\n\n“I don't want to build platforms. I've done too much junk already. I want to make pictures I can be proud of.”\n\n“You're an idealist, Cliff. Look at McQueen. Look at Redford. They're working all the time.”\n\n“Sorry, but I'm not a good carpenter.”\n\nHe turned down two $500,000 offers. He turned down “The Anderson Tapes” (“I was determined not to get back on the treadmill of mediocrity”), “Dirty Harry” (“I didn't like the politics”) and “Straw Dogs.” (“That was before Peckinpah was involved. I told ABCCinerama president Marty Baum I couldn't do it because the violence was too much for my stomach. He said that was ridiculous. I told him he'd have to talk to my stomach. Then he said, ‘By showing violence, we're trying to show anti‐ violence,’ and I said, ‘Nonsense, you're doing it to make money,’ and that ended that conversation.”)\n\nInstead of building platforms, Robertson spent much of the next yearand‐a‐half talking and drinking beer with the rodeo people about whom he wanted to make a film. When the script for “J. W. Coop” was finally finished, the Academy Award did make one difference. “It took me seven years to finance ‘Charly.’ It took me seven days to finance ‘J. W. Coop.’ That's the difference an Academy Award makes.”\n\nIf necessary, Robertson says, “I can live off ‘Charly’ for the rest of my life.” It is less that his percentage of “Charly” made him an excessive amount of money than it is that “I don't live high. I don't go to night clubs or golf tournaments or buy clothes.” (His “one obsession” — his six open‐cockpit, single — engine airplanes which include three Tiger Moths and a Spitfire—has, as is often the case with obsessions, “accrued in value.”) His car is a five‐year‐old Mustang, his lack of interest In gracious living is the despair of his heiress wife. She would like to live “in the lobby of the Beverly Hills hotel” while he prefers “the boonies with trees and fresh air and animals.” He does not know how much money his wife has “because I've never asked her.” He buys the groceries and pays the rent. Only the time and money his wife spends at fashion shows come from her own resources. Robertson has a 14‐year‐old daughter from his first marriage to Cynthia Lemmon. Although the oldest child of Dina Merrill's first marriage is now 25, Dina chose to make Robertson the present of another daughter, Heather, now two.\n\nRobertson is determined that any mediocrity in his future films will be because of his own flaws. It will not be mediocrity forced upon him. When Universal offered him any one of six scripts, he agreed to do “The Great Northfield, Minnesota, Raid” only if he could work on his own time with the director and writer to help shape the script. A Robertson and Associates coproduction about the Younger Brothers and the James boys, the film was released a few weeks ago to generally favorable reviews. “Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies,” which will be released in early fall, is a story he first became involved with four years ago, lost to another producer, then agreed to star in for Fox.\n\nHe has no qualms about rejecting the great sums of money that have been offered for films of which he does not approve. He has been essentially on his own since the age of 15 when he “jumped over the wall” of La Jolla, California, signed on to a freighter, and spent December 7, 1941, being bombed by Japanese planes. (Several wars later, he flew to Biafra and, when he returned, raised enough money to get 1,000 Biafran orphans to safety on the Ivory Coast. The organization for Biafran relief which Robertson helped to found, now called Americans for Children's Relief, gives “seed money” for such things as mobile eye clinics in Appalachia and inner‐city ghettos.)"
