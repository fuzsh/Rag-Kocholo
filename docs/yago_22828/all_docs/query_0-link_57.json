        "text": "Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma as William Blake Crump, his name changed when his mother married Jack McEdwards, a Hollywood production manager who rose to the ranks of assistant director in a number of early films. McEdwards father, J. Gordon Edwards (Blake’s step-grandfather) was a prolific silent movie director who worked with Theda Bara in a number of films including Cleopatra 1917.\n\nEdwards grew up on Hollywood back lots and went to school enjoying his life among Hollywood’s elite even becoming roommates with Mickey Rooney for a time. He began his career as an actor being given forgettable roles in “B” pictures and upon realization that the acting life was not for him, turned his creative energies to screen and radio writing where his sophisticated humor and intelligence were nurtured and allowed to blossom.\n\nThe mid 50s saw Edwards direct his first film, Bring Your Smile Along 1955 with Jack Albertson and Frankie Laine and followed that up with Mr.Cory 57, a vehicle he wrote and directed for Tony Curtis. He directed Curtis again alongside Cary Grant in Operation Petticoat 59, a wildly successful military farce and with that his career took off like a rocket.\n\nProducer, screenwriter and director, Blake Edwards often wore all 3 hats in his television and film work. For TV he produced and directed 3 well received but short-lived series beginning with Peter Gunn 1958-60 then Mr. Lucky 59-60 and Dante 60-61. His flamboyant directing style and effervescent writing graced some of the great Hollywood classic films of the 1960s. He directed Truman Capote’s romantic comedy Breakfast at Tiffany’s 1961 and made Audrey Hepburn a film icon. Experiment in Terror 1962, starred Lee Remick and Glenn Ford was a tight, suspenseful thriller and he worked with Remick again in The Days of Wine and Roses 1963 with Jack Lemmon, a dark and powerful portrait of alcoholism. It was also 1963 that Blake Edwards introduced audiences to the lovable but bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau in the Pink Panther series of films starring Peter Sellers. The film was so successful that Sellers and Edwards made sequels of the orignal whenever they needed money and indeed there were 6 sequels. It’s also interesting to note that all of these films were scored by Henry Mancini who was one of Edwards closest friends.\n\nThe mid 60s saw his marriage to Patricia Walker (whom he married in 1953) dissolve which sent Edwards into psychotherapy. In an interview during that time Edwards remarked how nice and sweet Julie Andrews was, so much so “she must have violets for pubic hair”. Andrews whose marriage was also on the rocks, heard the remark and sent Edwards a bouquet of violets beginning one of the legendary real-life Hollywood romances. They were married in 1969, and remained so the rest of his life.\n\nEdwards was prolific in his film output and was responsible for some of the funniest and timely movies of his day, My Sister Eileen 1955, This Happy Feeling 1959, A Shot in the Dark 1964, What Did You Do in the War Daddy? 1966 and The Carey Treatment 1972 to name a few.\n\nLike any director worth his salt, Edwards was in constant battle with studio heads over who would have creative control over his projects. So bitter were the fights that he moved to England with Julie staying for an entire year to try to regain some sanity.\n\nUpon return to the U.S. he directed 10 in 1979 with Bo Derek and Dudley Moore that turned out to be the biggest money-maker of the year. He followed that up with a wicked, vicious satire on Hollywood, S.O.B. 1981 with Andrews where she shocked moviegoers by baring her breasts. The all-star cast included Robert Preston, Richard Mulligan, William Holden, Robert Vaughn, Loretta Swit, Shelly Winters, Larry Hagman, Larry Storch and Corbin Bernsen. S.O.B. wasn’t the only film Edwards made with Andrews. Together they made The Tamarind Seed 1974 an espionage drama with Omar Sharif, Darling Lili 1979 with Rock Hudson that actually was very good despite being lambasted by critics, Victor/ Victoria 1982 with Andrews, Robert Preston, Leslie Ann Warren, James Garner and Alex Karras was an unapologetic, stylish love letter to the gay community became a great commercial as well as critical success. Edwards career went into decline with his advancing age and he only made a handful of films from 82 to the early 90s, his last being Son of the Pink Panther 1993 but remained active in the arts, achieving success as a painter and sculptor with exhibitions in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nEdwards and Andrews had a total of 5 children between them. Jennifer (an actor) and Geoffrey ( a screenwriter) are products of his first marriage. Julie’s daughter Emma from her first marriage and 2 adopted Vietnamese orphans, Amelia Leigh and Joanna Lynn. All the Edwards children with the exception of Joanna appeared in their fathers films at one time or another. He was surrounded by his family when he passed away from pneumonia at age 88.\n\nThis wonderful comedic actor was born in Saskatchewan, Canada and raised 200 miles south of the Arctic Circle the son of a Royal Canadian Mountie. After graduating from high school Leslie Nielsen joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, did his time then received a scholarship to study acting that eventually led him to New York City in the early 1950s where he appeared in over 150 live performances on television.\n\nMoving to Los Angeles he was put under contract with MGM where he was cast as the lead with Anne Francis in the classic sci-fi movie Forbidden Planet 1956 that some people say was the forerunner of Star Trek. He then appeared opposite Debbie Reynolds in Tammy and the Bachelor 1957. Both films did well at the box office firmly establishing Nielsen as a dramatic actor as well as a handsome romantic lead. Becoming dissatisfied with the roles he was offered, Nielsen asked to be let out of his contract with MGM then made a series of mediocre B films before being cast in classic television shows most notably the Disney miniseries The Swamp Fox and followed that with showy roles in The Virginian, The Wild Wild West and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Throughout the 60s Neilson enjoyed his success on the small screen before returning to the big screen in the all-star disaster epic The Poseidon Adventure 1972 effectively reviving his film career.\n\nHis comedic talents were put to good use during the 80s and 90s with roles in movie parodies beginning with a spoof of the award-winning Airport titled Airplane! 1980, where his deadpan delivery won audiences over and made the film one of the top grossing of that year. He followed that with Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! ( a spoof of the TV series) co-starring with George Kennedy, Priscilla Presley and O.J. Simpson in 1988 where Neilson played the bumbling Lieutenant Frank Drebin. The 4 reprised their roles in Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear in 91 and Naked Gun 33 1/2: The Final Insult 94 each movie out grossing the previous in ticket sales. Nielsen also appeared as the “client” killed by high-priced call girl Barbra Streisand in Nuts 1987.\n\nNielsen did voice overs and narration as well as starring in over 100 films during the course of his 60 years in show business. He also toured the country in his one man show about The Life of Clarence Darrow, much like Hal Holbrooke did with Mark Twain and Robert Morse’s show on Truman Capote.\n\nNielsen was legally deaf and wore a hearing aid his entire life. His politically active brother Erik Nielsen served as Deputy Prime Minister of Canada from 1984-1986.\n\nLeslie Nielsen was married 4 times over the course of his life and fathered 2 children. Earlier this month he was admitted to a hospital in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida with pneumonia and died in his sleep yesterday surrounded by family and friends.\n\nLeaving his home in Naples, Italy at 17 to enroll in cinematography school, De Laurentiis’ life at that time mirrored that of his future friend and collaborator Federico Fellini by supporting himself as an actor, prop man, set designer, unit manager and assistant director before producing his first film at age 20, L’Amore canta (Love Song) in 1941. His career as producer was interrupted by WWII military service but he returned to production mid decade and scored big with the international box office success of Bitter Rice 1948 a blend of eroticism and neo realism that launched the career of its sensuous lead Silvana Mangano, who later became his wife.\n\nJoining up with Carlo Ponti, who later became the husband of Sophia Loren, the two formed their own production company, Ponti-De Laurentiis, and produced a number of films that would become internationally acclaimed classics including Fellini’s La Strada 1954 and The Nights of Cabiria 1956. His partnership with Ponti was dissolved in 1957 and De Laurentiis built Dinocitta, a huge film production facility on the outskirts of Rome so he could produce grand scale epics in an effort to attract international talent, which it did, John Huston, Ava Gardner and Peter O’Toole in The Bible 1966, Jane Fonda and Roger Vadim in Barbarella 1968 but ultimately failed to bring people into theaters and he was forced to close down the studio and sell it to the Italian government in the early 70s moving his base operations to the U.S.\n\nHis new company, De Laurentiis Entertainment group (DEG), based in Wilmington, North Carolina with offices in New York and Hollywood produced some memorable films. Serpico 1973 with Al Pacino, Three Days of the Condor 1975 with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway and The Brinks Job 1978 with Peter Falk, Peter Boyle and Gena Rowlands and Ragtime 1981 with James Cagney. De Laurentiis effectively launched the screen career of Arnold Schwarzenegger by producing Conan the Barbarian 1982 and put David Lynch on the map with the strange and wonderful Blue Velvet 1986 with Isabella Rosellini, Dennis Hopper and Dean Stockwell. But even with the critical and commercial successes of these films it was a series of big budget flops, King Kong 1976, Dune 1985, Tai-Pan 1986 that led De Laurentiis to resign as chairman of the board and soon after DEG filed for bankruptcy. His daughter Raffaella, an independent producer now serves as DEG’s head of production.\n\nDino De Laurentiis was a visionary who produced some of the worlds greatest films as well as some of the biggest flops in cinematic history. At age 91 he died at home in Beverly Hills. Cause of death was not disclosed.\n\nRazor sharp and talented, Jill Clayburgh carved for herself an enviable career as a New York stage actor then moved on to screen work. Her father was a wealthy business executive, her mother secretary to Broadway powerhouse David Merrick, Clayburgh grew up in the tony upper east side in New York and attended the prestigious Brearley School before moving on to Sarah Lawrence College where she decided on a becoming an actor.\n\nDuring the 60s and 70s, Clayburgh appeared in a number of Broadway shows including The Rothschild’s and Pippin. Beckoned by Hollywood, she began her film career in the central role of a bride to be in Brian De Palma’s The Wedding Party in 1969 alongside another newcomer, Robert De Niro. She garnered more attention as the love interest of Gene Wilder in Silver Streak 1976 directed by Arthur Hiller and starring Richard Pryor. She was also Al Pacino’s girlfriend, a relationship that lasted for 5 years. Paul Mazursky gave her the lead in An Unmarried Woman in 1978 where she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress but lost out to Jane Fonda for her role in Coming Home. Instead she ended up winning the Best Actress award for that performance at the Cannes Film Festival, winning again the following year for Best Actress at Cannes for her role in Starting Over co-starring with Burt Reynolds. Throughout the 70s and 80s she appeared in various soapers, dramas and comedies including Portnoy’s Complaint 72, Gable and Lombard 76, Semi-Tough 77, and It’s My Turn in 80. She received favorable reviews as a Valium addicted woman in I’m Dancing as Fast as I Can 1982, appearing alongside Geraldine Page and Diane Wiest.\n\nClayburgh was consistent in delivering solid, articulate performances and earned the respect of her peers, a luxury not normally experienced by many actors working today who’s lives are mired in controversy, drug addiction and general debauchery, Clayburgh never let success go to her head and never lost her dignity.\n\nMoving to the small screen in the 90s, Clayburgh was introduced to a whole new audience by working in Ally McBeale, Law and Order, Nip/Tuck, The Practice and Dirty Sexy Money, receiving several Emmy nominations along the way.\n\nShe returned to film in Running with Scissors 2006 and completed work on her last film, the yet to be released Love and Other Drugs 2010.\n\nMarried to playwright David Rabe in 1979, a union that spawned 2 children and lasted the rest of her life, Clayburgh died from lymphocytic leukemia on November 5.\n\nBorn in L.A. the daughter of a cop and working mom, Barbara Billingsley was a fashion model before signing with MGM in 1945. She was given mostly uncredited roles in minor films but did appear in The Bad and the Beautiful 1952 a controversial film that parodied the lives of Hollywood’s rich and famous, directed by Vincente Minnelli starring Lana Turner, Kirk Douglas and Dick Powell. In 1953 she had an unbilled role in Invaders from Mars. It took a studio change to Universal in 1957 for her to be to cast in the role for which she will always be remembered, America’s favorite TV mom, June Cleaver in Leave it to Beaver.\n\nLeave it to Beaver existed among many other family oriented television sitcoms of that era 1957-1963 that included Father Knows Best, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Make Room for Daddy and The Donna Reed Show but Billingsley set the standard that an endless parade of future TV moms would emulate. Her trademark pearls, she explained, was to mask a natural hollow in her neck, a leftover trick from her modeling days. She wore high heels in an effort to stay taller than her growing TV kids.\n\nWhile filming the famous TV series, Billingsley was herself the mother of 2 boys the same age as the Cleaver sons and admitted that it was hard for her, at times, to distinguish between the 2 households and she developed strong lasting relationships with Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers. Both men issued eloquent and heartfelt statements upon news of her death.\n\nShortsighted standard 1950’s television contracts awarded actors residuals for only 6 reruns. Leave it to Beaver proved to be as popular as I Love Lucy and has never stopped showing, not only in the U.S.A. but in over 100 countries worldwide and if the cast was paid for every episode ever shown on TV, their wealth would probably total somewhere in the billions.\n\nLong after production of Leave it to Beaver ended, Billingsley revived her movie career if only briefly by appearing in billed cameos in Airplane! (1980) as a jive talking grandma and in an overdue tribute to the 60s beach movies with Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, Back to the Beach (1987). She made many guest appearances in her later years on highly rated TV shows like Mork and Mindy and Roseanne, her last TV appearance being in 2007 in an episode of My Name is Earl.\n\nBarbara Billingsley, beautiful, elegant, understanding and well spoken was one of the last remaining icons of an era of television that will never return and according to Jerry Mathers, his devoted lifelong mentor whose TV role was very similar to her private life. Billingsley was active in a variety of charities throughout her life.\n\nMarried 3 times, her first husband was Glenn Billingsley in 1941 whom she divorced in 1947 following were Roy Kellino from 1953-56 and last but not least William Mortensen in 1959 until his death in 1981.\n\nBarbara Billingsley died of polymyalgia, a rheumatoid disease at her home in Santa Monica 2 months shy of her 95th birthday. She leaves behind 2 children, a stepson and 4 grandchildren.\n\nBorn in the Bronx the son of Jewish Hungarian immigrants his father a tailor, his mother a schizophrenic, Bernard Schwartz had a tough upbringing. One of 3 sons, his brother Robert inherited their mother’s instability and had to be institutionalized. When Bernard was 12 his other brother Julius was hit by a truck and killed. In those days it cost 11 cents to see a movie and Bernard got his moneys worth often staying in movie houses for 10 hours at a time to escape ( like lots of people did) the harsh realities of life. World War 2 saw him enlist in the Navy where he witnessed the Japanese surrender at Tokyo Bay.\n\nReturning to New York he studied acting under the GI Bill at Workshop of the New School in New York under the influential german director Erwin Piscator. Other members of the group included Elaine Stritch, Walter Matthau and Rod Stieger. While working in the Catskills, Bernard was noticed by talent scout/casting director Joyce Selznick who brought him to Hollywood, put him under contract with Universal where he changed his name to Tony Curtis. The year was 1948. He was 23 years old.\n\nCurtis’s first few films were rather inauspicious, Criss Cross, The Lady Gambles and Johnny Stool Pigeon all in 1949 and by the early 50s had established himself a capable leading man. He was cast opposite his wife Janet Leigh in the highly fictionalized biopic Houdini in 1953 where it was hard to figure out who was prettier, her or him. Curtis and Leigh were married from 1951 to 1962 and produced 2 daughters, Kelly and Jamie Lee.\n\nExtraordinarily handsome with a perfect physique, Curtis hit his stride in the latter half of the 50s turning in fine dramatic and comic performances. The Sweet Smell of Success 1957 where his nervous energetic performance won him positive critical response then came The Defiant Ones 1958 an examination of racism with Sidney Poitier, Some Like it Hot 1959 a sparkling drag comedy (where he showed off his mimicry skills by doing a dead on impersonation of Cary Grant) directed by Billy Wilder with castmates Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe. He was critical of Monroe’s constant need for reassurance and her inability to get to work on time although his opinion of her softened over the years.\n\nSpartacus came along in 1960 with an all-star cast that included Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Jean Simmons and directed by Stanley Kubrick. One of his scenes was cut out of the film because of its strong homoerotic overtones but was reinstated when Spartacus was restored and re-released in 1991. His next big film was The Great Race 1965, a comedy, directed by Blake Edwards re-united him with Jack Lemmon and included Natalie Wood, Peter Falk and Vivian Vance. Curtis was absolutely sensational as the The Boston Strangler 1968 for which the Hollywood Foreign Press nominated him for best actor. He lent his distinctive voice to the groundbreaking Rosemary’s Baby, also that same year. A world-class raconteur, Curtis was a bottomless pit of funny Hollywood stories that he shared with America during countless guest appearances on late night TV talk shows.\n\nLike a lot of actors, Curtis had a hard time adjusting to life after his career went into decline and started abusing drugs that led to a stint in the Betty Ford Clinic. He sobered up and started to devote most of his time to oil painting, an interest he developed in the early 1980s. His canvasses sell for a cool 25K and up. 1995 saw Curtis the recipient of The National Order of Arts and Letters of France, in 1998 he founded the Emanuel Foundation for Hungarian Culture that focuses on restoration of synagogues and the upkeep of 1300 Jewish cemeteries in Hungary.\n\nCurtis was married 6 times. Following his divorce from Leigh ( which he claims broke his heart) in 1963 he took as his 2nd wife Christine Kaufmann, they divorced in 1967. He wed Leslie Allen 1968-82 they had 2 boys one of which died from a heroin overdose at age 23. From 1983-92 he was married to Andrea Savio, then Lisa Deutsch 1993-94 and finally settled with Jill Vandenberg in 1998 ( 43 years younger) the union that was to last the rest of his life.\n\nOne of the last remaining true icons of the Hollywood glamour factory, his body of work will continue to thrill and entertain for generations to come. Tony Curtis passed away of cardiac arrest at his home in Henderson, Nevada. For a complete list of his films visit www.imdb.com.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Gloria Stuart was 3rd generation Californian. Her father was an attorney, her mother stayed home to raise a fast growing family. When Gloria was 9 her father was appointed judge but just days before he was to take the bench, he was hit by a car and killed. Her mother took a job as a U.S. Postal worker to provide for the kids and Gloria graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1928 and then went off to study drama at Berkeley where she met sculptor Gordon Newell, married him and dropped out of school in 1930. The newlyweds moved to Carmel and lived a bohemian lifestyle with other artists, most notably Ansel Adams. She appeared in many stage productions at the Carmel Playhouse but it was an appearance at the Pasadena Playhouse that she was noticed and signed almost immediately with Universal Studios.\n\nBrilliant and beautiful she became a favorite of English director James Whale and did 3 pictures with him, The Old Dark House 1932, The Kiss Before the Mirror and The invisible Man both in 1933. With Universal giving her only secondary roles she became restless and moved on to 20th Century Fox who also gave her secondary roles which was a never-ending source of frustration. By the end of the 1930s she was a veteran of nearly 50 films and worked with Lionel Barrymore, Raymond Massey, Dick Powell, Shirley Temple and Boris Karloff. During this time Stuart became a founding member of The Screen Actors Guild. An amicable divorce from Newell gave her the freedom to marry Arthur Sheekman a screenwriter who was also best friends with Groucho Marx. They produced a daughter Sylvia in 1935. With both between jobs in 1939 Stuart convinced her husband to take a trip around the world. They got as far as France where they tried to join the French Resistance but were denied and they got the last boat back to New York where they stayed, Stuart working on the stage and Sheekman writing plays with George S. Kaufman. They eventually returned to Hollywood where Stuart took singing lessons and got busy traveling across the country entertaining troops and selling war bonds.\n\nBy 1946 Stuart’s film roles had dried up and she looked for another channel for her creative energy. She discovered decoupage and became very good at it, opening up a shop where she sold her own creations at great profit. By 1954, with Sylvia away at college, the Sheekman’s decided to live abroad and settled into the Italian Riviera where Stuart took up oil painting and worked very hard. She had her first one woman show at the Hammer Galleries in New York and event that was sold out months in advance.\n\nHer husband’s health became a concern and they moved back to the U.S. By 1975 he was in a nursing home with dementia and she secured herself an agent in the hope of finding work. After being absent from the screen for 30 years she got only bit parts on TV and it took several more years before she would get a role in My Favorite Year 1982 with Peter O’Toole. It was during this time she developed an interest in the Japanese art of Bonsai and became the first Anglo to become a member of the California Bonsai Society.\n\nAfter Sheekman’s death in 1978, Stuart rekindled an old flame from her days at Berkeley. Ward Ritchie (Ward Ritche Press) a printer who introduced Stuart to the art of making books. They fell in love but never married. She established “Imprenta Glorias” and started producing “artists books” that were labor intensive and hand-made. Stuart wrote the text, designed the books. set the type, printed pages and finished them off with watercolor, silk screen or decoupage. Copies of her books can be found all over the world in private collections as well as the Metropolitan Museum, Library of Congress, J.Paul Getty Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Library of France.\n\nIt was after Ritchie’s death in 1996 that Stuart was offered a film role that would finally make her a household name at the ripe old age 87. As “old Rose” in Titanic 1997, one of the most successful films in Hollywood history, Stuart was the only member of the cast who was alive when Titanic went down in world history. Her performance was so great she was nominated for an Academy Award but lost out to Kim Bassinger.\n\nStuart was honored by the Screen Actors Guild for her years of service in June of this year. On July 4th (her birthday) of this year, The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences honored Stuart’s career with a program of film clips and a conversation between her and Leonard Maltin. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000.\n\nAfter a long and fascinating life this self-described “old woman with heart filled with love” passed away peacefully in her sleep of natural causes in Los Angeles.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, one of 7 children by Russian-Jewish immigrants, Eddie Fisher began his public life as a singer during the late 40s crooning with the big bands in the Catskills where Eddie Cantor heard him and had him as a guest on his radio show which resulted in Fisher signing a contract with RCA Victor shortly afterward. He became a teen idol in the early 50s, having 17 singles in the top 10 music charts as well as 35 in the top 40 up until 1956. He married “America’s Sweetheart” Debbie Reynolds in 1955 and they had 2 children, Carrie and Todd.\n\nFisher was best friends with Mike Todd, show business impresario and producer who was married to Elizabeth Taylor. The close-knit couples went out together often to clubs, parties, movie premiers and their comings and goings were fodder for an adoring press who dutifully reported on where they went, what they ate and drank, what they wore as well as who they knew. Fame is a double-edged sword as Fisher would find out. At this time Fisher had a lucrative contract with RCA, his own TV show and had done a movie with Reynolds, Bundle of Joy in 1956 a musical comedy based loosely on their lives.\n\nIn 1958 Mike Todd was killed in a plane crash leaving a shattered Liz in need of some TLC. Debbie sent Eddie over to comfort her and the rest is Hollywood history. In 1959 Fisher divorced Reynolds in a very public court case, turned around and married Liz, a move that garnered an avalanche of unwelcome and unflattering press. Liz was a man stealing, home wrecking whore and Fisher a louse with the sensibilities of an alley cat. The press and most of the nation made it clear that Reynolds was the victim and she played the role of trusting wife wronged to the hilt,( a performance that Fisher later said was worth an Academy Award) and indeed Reynolds never missed an opportunity to publicly vilify the two. During that time Fisher had a bit role in Liz’s Butterfield 8, 1960. His marriage to Liz was strained from the start and she ended up divorcing him in 1964 to marry Richard Burton.\n\nThe bad press over this scandalous affair between 2 of Hollywood’s most popular leading actresses and Fisher was so great that his TV show was cancelled in 1959 and he was dropped by RCA in the following months from which his career never recovered. His fan base of teenage girls had moved on to rock and roll and his subsequent attempts at a comeback were total failures.\n\nFisher was married 5 times. His last celebrity wife was Connie Stevens 1967-1969 and that union produced 2 more children, Jolie and Tricia. He was married briefly to non-celebrity Terry Richard (less than a year) then married Betty Lin another non-celebrity in 1993. They divorced in 2001.\n\nFisher took account of his life by writing 2 autobiographies, the first being Eddie, My Life, My Loves in 1981 that nobody bought and he ended up recycling its content for a second bio, the bitter and twisted Been There, Done That in 1999 adding salacious tidbits about his marriage to Reynolds, a marriage he claims he was bullied into, and to Liz, where he described their marriage as him playing nursemaid and cleaning up after her pets which infuriated the 2 women. Reynolds and Taylor united in their self righteous anger over the book, reconnected and smoothed over the rift in their relationship that had lasted over 40 years.\n\nMost of Fisher’s music has been lost to time but he is associated with a couple of classics “Oh My Pa-Pa” and “All I Want for Christmas “. He had hip surgery earlier this month and died from complications at home in Berkeley, California. He was 82.\n\nThis award winning husky voiced actor was born in Kentucky then went on to study drama at Northwestern University. She moved to New York and went to work on the stage in the late 40s and became the first recipient of a Tony for Best Actress for Another Part of the Forest written by Lillian Hellman.\n\nOne of her first films The Fountainhead 1949, an adaptation from the Ayn Rand novel, starred her opposite Gary Cooper and being only 21 she fell hard for his charm and good looks. They had an affair despite the fact that Cooper was married. His wife found out about it and the affair ended. Neal was pregnant and had an abortion. 3 Secrets 1950 a fun melodrama very much like a Letter to 3 Wives 1949 cast Neal as one of 3 women who all gave a boy up for adoption on the same day in the same town. A plane crash on a mountain side killed everyone on board (you guessed it) except a little boy and the 3 women stand around wondering, in flashback, if the child really belongs to one of them.\n\nHer next film had Michael Rennie as her co-star, the classic sci-fi thriller The Day the Earth Stood Still 1951 where she gained immortality by speaking the alien phrase taught to her by the Rennie character to save the world from destruction, “gort klatoo mirada nikto“. After starring in 2 more films in 1952 The Breaking Point and Operation Pacific, Neal suffered a nervous breakdown and moved back to New York to work in the theater returning to Hollywood occasionally to make a film.\n\nIn early 1950 Neal was introduced to British writer Roald Dahl (who was responsible for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) at a Lillian Hellman party, and married him in 1951. The union was bittersweet. They lost a daughter to a measles related condition and had a son who was hit by a taxi and suffered major injuries but they went on to have 3 more children. The marriage lasted until 1983 when Neal found out her husband was having an affair with her best friend.\n\nShe had a substantial role in the wonderful and underrated A Face in the Crowd 1957, with Andy Griffith and Breakfast at Tiffany’s 1961 with Audrey Hepburn. She won a Best Actress Oscar for her role in HUD 1963 appearing with Paul Newman and a BAFTA from the U.K. She won her 2nd BAFTA in 1965 after appearing in In Harm’s Way 1965 with John Wayne. Later that year she suffered 3 cerebral aneurysms that left her in a coma for 3 months afterwards having a long rehabilitation where she had to learn to regain her motor skills and speech.\n\nNeal appeared in films sporadically after that the best of them being The Subject was Roses 1968 where she was nominated for another Oscar for Best Actress and All Quiet on the Western Front 1979 a TV movie based on the classic 1930 hit. She played Olivia Walton on the pilot episode of the Walton’s and won a Golden Globe for her performance but the producers decided the daily grind of TV work would do no good to her already fragile health. She went on to appear on an episode of Little House on the Prairie.\n\nNeal also did several documentaries during the 90s but was more concerned with becoming an advocate for paralysis victims and worked tirelessly to raise funding and awareness and has The Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center in Knoxville (where she grew up) named in her honor. She also wrote her autobiography As I Am in 1988.\n\nPatricia Neal died yesterday at her home in Martha’s Vineyard from lung cancer.\n\nGorgeous, sultry, intelligent and highly respected Vonetta MCgee born in San Francisco, began her film career in the Italian comedy Faustina 1968. Her next film the same year was a spaghetti western The Great Silence where she teamed with Klaus Kinsky but it was her work in blaxploitation films of the 1970s that she will be best remembered.\n\nThe blaxploitation genre was exactly that. Black casts in extremely low-budget but very entertaining films that featured interesting, edgy characters in action filled storylines. McGee said of the genre “It’s used like racism, so you don’t have to think of the individual elements, just the whole” and went further to say there was a difference between someone like Diana Ross and other potentially marketable black actresses…”she has a studio behind her and this is where a lot of us fell short. We were on our own.” Anyone who followed Ross’s movie career knows it didn’t take long for her to end up in the toilet and that McGee’s statement although true might not be as scathing as she intended but the main point is there, studio backing or not, racism thrived and is still prevalent in Hollywood. Fred Williamson, her costar in Melinda 1972 succinctly described the difficulties of black actors who did not have studio backing .”Vonetta McGee was like a lot of black actors at the time, like myself, Richard Roundtree, Billy Dee Williams and Pam Grier in that we had more talent than we were allowed to show because everything was perceived as a black project. Once they categorized you, your marketability becomes limited.” No doubt all these actors held the same feelings about the genre and its consequences but demonstrate the core attribute that exists in every serious actor…working is working. The L.A. Times described McGee as the busiest and most beautiful black actress of her time.\n\nMcGee’s screen credits are noteworthy, Hammer and Blacula in 1972, Detroit 9000 and Shaft in Africa 1973, The Eiger Sanction with Clint Eastwood director/star in 1975, Superdome 1978, Repo Man 1984 and rounded out her film career with Johnny B. Good in 1998. She also appeared in recurring TV roles in Cagney and Lacey (where she played the role of wife to Carl Lumbly whom she later married and had one son), Bustin’ Loose and L.A. Law.\n\nMcGee who passed away from congestive heart failure in Berkeley California leaves behind her husband and son."
