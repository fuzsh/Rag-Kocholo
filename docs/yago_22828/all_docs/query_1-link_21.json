        "text": "BECAUSE anyone who wants to make a film today has to overcome so many obstacles, it must be especially difficult to make a film about underachievement. The very process of making the film would seem to give the lie to the theme. A man who has managed to get the money and the screenplay and the actors together —all at the same time—has obviously scored a triumph, a feeling of which must, I think, be reflected in the film itself and make it seem slightly phony. How can a man who has raised $1.5million to do with as he will successfully lower his sights to the failure without somehow acknowledging that the failure is, after all, a poor slob, someone whom God for His own good reasons has flunked?\n\nThis may be why I often find it difficult to accept fiction films about poverty. I can never quite forget about all the money and effort spent to achieve some marvelous look of social and physical desolation. Out of the corner of my ear I can always hear a director, the sort of man who might pride himself on his subscription to the New York Review, congratulating the art director for having found a particularly grim, rat‐infested location: “It's beautiful! We'll use it!” Practically every film made these days thus has two themes—what it's supposed to be about, and the personal triumph of the director or the writer or the producer who finally succeeded in getting the bloody thing on the screen in the last place.\n\n“J. W. Coop,” which was directed, produced and written (with Carey Cartwright and Edwin Shrake) by Cliff Robertson, who also plays the title role, is that sort of personal triumph, an achievement that at first seems to be about underachievement. It's the story of an aging rodeo circuit rider who comes out of prison after nine years and nine months hell‐bent on becoming the champion of champions in the 10month rodeo circuit season. For J. W. Coop, winning second place is no better than being last. It's nothing. When the final show is over, J. W. Coop has failed, technically anyway, though the movie seems to want to tell us that there is something magnificent in his failure. What one carries away from this film, however, is a feeling not so easily classified, a sort of aching sadness not for heroic failure, nor for underachievement, but for a man and a country whose goals have been less than grand, which has to diminish satisfaction in their achievement.\n\nCoop's victories come in such an easy succession during the film that, if you know anything at all about this kind of fiction, you immediately realize that the only possible ending must be some variation on victory‐indefeat. “The guy with the greatest heart ever seen in rodeo,” says the announcer at the Oklahoma City rodeo when Coop decides to ride with a broken leg. However, what the movie actually says —and this is a revolutionary statement to find in a conventional commercial American film—is that having a great heart is not enough. The Quiet American had a great heart and he continues to botch everything up.\n\nAlthough “J. W. Coop” Is contemporary in every respect, it lives simultaneously in the past—in the years before Coop was sent off to prison for passing a bad check and beating up a sheriff—as well as in the present. At its best, it is truly elegiac. However, it doesn't mourn the past, which was terrible, but those dreams of the past that, on realization, became so small.\n\nEarly in the film there is the visit Coop makes to see his mother (Geraldine Page), a dreamy lady who walks around with long‐forgotten curlers in her hair, who cooks him inedible food, talks about Coop's dead father as if he'd simply stepped out for a minute, and refuses to acknowledge that her son is no longer 10.\n\nThings are pretty awful all right, but they are still better than they were when Coop was a boy, when the oil company for which his father worked owned everyone in the town and which, when his father was killed, sent his mother a solicitous letter, a small check and a leather‐hound history of the company. His mother now at least has enough to eat, her own house, a radio and a chicken of which she is peculiarly fond.\n\nIn fact, times have changed for the better for just about everyone. An old wet‐back friend of Coop's has the franchise for some very profitable tacos stands, Black Texans have won their fight to be allowed to ride do the front of the buses (and now the whites sit scornfully in the’ back). Coop's chief competitor on the rodeo circuit is a young go‐getter named Billy Hawkins, who flies his own plane from rodeo to rodeo, has a broker, makes $80,000 a year in prize money plus another sixty from commercial endorsements.\n\nThe vision of the film is necessarily limited to the world through which J. W. Coop drives, rides and hitchhikes from one small town rodeo to the next. It's a very small part of America but it's not an insignificant part. An affable truck driver, who gives Coop a lift, gripes about “the kids, the commies and the unions all trying to run this country,” and then talks happily about his own affluence, which he credits to the fearless leadership of Jimmy Hoffa. It is the quite extraordinary suggestion of “J. W. Coop” that America's labor movement has gone stuffily middle class and that the prole tradition of concern and activism must now be carried on by instinctive loners like Coop, Who hasn't a political thought in his head (although he will fight for a black friend in a bar), and by sweetly ineffectual souls like Christina Ferrare, the pretty, (probably) sub: urban‐bred hippie he meets on the road.\n\nMiss Ferrare, whose character namej is, I hesitate to tell you, “Bean” (for Human Being), comes as close as does any character in “J. W. Coop” to having a point of view that coincides with that of the film. (Coop, being the sort of person he is, just doesn't think much.) She likes health foods and sleeping under the stars (“My God!” says Coop, shortly after he's gotten into the big rodeo money, “Here I am sleeping in the bushes with a college graduate!”). The movie—and Bean — watch with certain reservations as Coop moves towards the realization of his dreams, as he gives up hitch‐hiking to buy a surplus Army ambulance (“amb‐you‐lance” in Coop's Texas accent) and then a sportscar, as he begins wearing fancy clothes, grows a mustache, affects dark glasses and takes to reserve ing bridal suites in dreadful modern hotels.\n\nNothing in Robertson's triumph in having been able to put this very personal film together slops over to falsify its characters or its method, which is mostly leisurely and amiable, sometimes as tough and disorganized as a fight in a barroom, and never condescending to its performers, neither to the professional actors nor to the reallife rodeo characters whom the star‐director‐writer‐producer obviously admires.\n\nI have no idea what kind of film Robertson set out td make when, according to the movie's production notes, he began to research the subject by following the rodeo circuit with his tape recorder some years ago. Reduced to a synopsis, It's the sad story of a circuit rider Who doesn't quite make it. However, in its execution, in its accumulation of incidents and details that are possible only on film, it becomes an immensely mournful but not unkind meditation on American life, especially on its aspirations which, too often, haven't been bold enough."
