        "text": "IN portraying Dr. W.F. Carver, the owner of a traveling stunt show, Cliff Robertson is called on to \"play an old coot. \" \"My character was fun to do,\" says Robertson, who plays Carver in \"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. \" \"He was flamboyant, lively, rich.\n\nAnytime you play a rich character such as this, it's going to be a lot of fun to do. He's a real-life character. \" \"Wild Hearts,\" which opens today, is the true story of a young girl, Sonora Webster, growing up in the Great Depression but determined to prove that she can do anything she sets her mind to.\n\nShe answers a newspaper ad for a diving horse girl - a fearless female brave enough to leap from a tower platform 40 feet high, on a gallant horse, and plunge into a tank of water.\n\nRobertson plays the owner of the side show who, at first, rejects the girl and then allows her to fulfill her dream.\n\n\"Wild Hearts\" is a true story, about real life. About hopes. And dreams. And wishes. And disappointment. And failure. And success.\n\nAnd love.\n\n\"From what I read about him,\" Robertson says, \"you do not know from seeing the movie why he was kind of down on life. It was a part we had to cut, I guess, for time considerations.\n\n\"Carver had been bruised badly. His wife had left him for another sideshow. His son, who he was left to raise, did a lot of carousing and running around, and they had a kind of falling out.\n\n\"That plus, with the Great Depression in the early '30s, he didn't have too much to laugh about.\n\n\"That's why W.F. Carver was cranky and grumpy. \" And not always pleasant to be around.\n\n\"I really got interested in this character,\" says Robertson, speaking from his home in Long Island, N.Y. \"They sent me the script. I liked what I read.\n\n\"I think that's because it was a real life character, a person you can really get a feel for.\n\n\"As you know, I have played a number of real-life characters in my career, from John F. Kennedy (in \"PT-109\") to Henry Ford (in the mini-series \"The Man and the Machine\") to Hugh Hefner (in \"Star 80\"). \" Robertson also has starred in \"Autumn Leaves,\" \"The Honey Pot,\" \"The Devil's Brigade,\" \"The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid,\" \"J.W. Coop (a film which he wrote, directed and starred in), \"Out of Season,\" \"Three Days of the Condor,\" \"Obsession,\" \"Class,\" \"Brainstorm,\" \"Malone,\" \"Shaker Run,\" \"Too Late the Hero,\" \"Gidget,\" \"The Interns,\" \"Sunday in New York,\" \"The Pilot\" and \"The Naked and the Dead,\" among many others.\n\nHe made his motion picture debut in \"Picnic,\" never will be forgotten for his portrayal of the young hero Jack Kennedy in \"PT-109\" and won an Academy Award for best actor for his role in \"Charly. \" On Broadway, he starred in Tennessee Williams' \"Orpheus Descending\" and has appeared in \"Love Letters. \" He has been a regular on the TV series \"Falcon Crest,\" has won an Emmy for best actor in a dramatic role for the Chrysler Theater production of \"The Game\" and has appeared in numerous other television roles.\n\nHe also is the corporate spokesman for AT&T. \"'Charly' always will stand out in my mind,\" Robertson says, \"although I've never been satisfied with the role. Not totally. It was a great film, a great opportunity for me, but as an actor, you're never ever satisfied.\n\n\"You look back and see where you could have done better, if you've been at it as long as I have. \" And Robertson still is \"at it. \" In addition to his recent appearance in \"Love Letters\" and his work with \"Wild Hearts,\" he also is thinking about directing a play. And ...\n\n\"I've just returned from filming in Western Australia,\" Robertson says, \"for Francis Ford Coppola's production of 'Wind,' directed by Carroll Ballard. It's about the America's Cup. Sailing.\n\n\"We have a little break in shooting now, giving me some time to do promotionals for this film. We have about a month of shooting left with 'Wind,' up in Newport, R.I., which, thank God, isn't too far from here.\n\n\"I did some sailing when I was a kid. I'm looking forward to doing some more. \" \"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken\" is a good, family film, Robertson says.\n\n\"We shot it in South Carolina. The weather was good, but it has more bugs per acre than any place I have shot.\n\n\"It was a positive experience, though, even though there were all these bugs. Which I guess they are there for some purpose, if only to get in our way.\n\n\"I started out in journalism, so the newspapers in the area asked me to write a couple of stories about my experiences.\n\n\"I believe it's nice that we have movies like 'Wild Heart,' where you can take your whole family. We have been over saturated with films about armies and police and cars and hatchets and guns and torture. They're really gone over the top with those. \" In addition to all his work, his travels and his family and his cat (which he says runs the household), Robertson still finds plenty of time for charities.\n\n\"With my involvement with 'Charly,' I got involved in certain charity work,\" he says. \"I'm former national chair for mental health, plus I'm involved with the cancer crusade and juvenile diabetes.\n\n\"You name it. If it's a good cause, I'm all for it. It's a chance for me to give a little bit back. \" Not such a bad deal for \"an old coot. \" BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 467568"
