        "text": "While the auteur theory introduced by the gang at Cahiers du Cinema and refined by Andrew Sarris — that the director is the “author” of a film, no matter how talented his collaborators and that great directors pretty much always make great movies — is a useful tool for making lists of movies, I’ve always found it kind of problematic. Directors placed in the pantheon, or the top level, by Sarris and his followers have directed plenty of mediocre to bad movies, forcing auteurists to make excuses for their favorites like blaming the producers, actors etc. (if it’s a great movie, the director gets all the credit). Conversely, it’s possible to generally not respond to a director, no matter how “distinctive” their vision (the “termite art” of Sam Fuller is something I’ve never gotten) yet be taken by a single work of theirs.\n\nThe latter was my experience with Brian DePalma, who was introduced to me with his comedy “Greetings” at a college press screening in 1968. None of his subsequent films, including “Get to Know Your Rabbit,” “Sisters” and “The Phantom of the Paradise,” did much for me. Then, in the late summer of 1976, at a since-closed multiplex in East Hartford Conn., I fell in love with DePalma’s “Obsession.” Until a recent press screening at BAM — which is showing a new print on Tuesday as part of a retrospective of DePalma’s thrillers opening today with “Sisters” — I’ve always resisted revisting this title, which has been available on DVD since 2000.\n\nGiven my subsequent negative experiences with DePalma — I loathed “Body Double” and several others of his ’80s films I reviewed and think even his better efforts like “Carrie” and “Blow Out” have always been vastly overrated — I’ve always feared that “Obsession” would not hold up on a second viewing. There was also good reason to think that “Obsession” would suffer from comparison from the film it was directly inspired by, Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” which had been out of circulation for several years in 1976.\n\nI caught the Hitchcock on its original theatrical run in 1958 (when I was eight) and one of its pan-and-scan showings on NBC in the ’60s but would not see it again until its theatrical re-release in 1982. One of my favorite movies, I’ve watched it perhaps a dozen times since, including on the first proper date with my beautiful wife — restored to its full VistaVision glory in 70mm at the Ziegfeld — in 1996.\n\nEntering an auditorium at BAM 14 years later, I had ample reason to be concerned about how I’d receive “Obsession.” It turned out to be one of the most satisfying and absorbing movie experiences I’ve had in a long time. Overall, I think ’70s Hollywood films tend to be overrrated and over-romanticized, but I’d rank “Obession” with the very best of them — “The Godfather” (and its sequel), “Dog Day Afternoon,” “Taxi Driver,” “All The President’s Men” and “Network.” (Auteurists would add several by Robert Altman and Sam Peckinpah, but don’t get me started).\n\nHitchcock himself was said to be displeased with “Obsession,” not least of all because DePalma signed up his former longtime collaborator Bernard Herrmann (they had a falling out over “Torn Curtain” and Herrmann was replaced) who recycled some of his musical cues from “Vertigo.” It’s Herrman’s omimous organ chords that set the tone for “Obsession” during the credits, which DePalma initially opens with a slowly moving image of a large church looming in the foreground.\n\nThere are still photographs showing the Italian courtship of characters played in the film by Cliff Robertson and Genevieve Bujold, neither of whom has ever been better on screen. The film proper opens with their 10th wedding anniversary celebration in 1959 New Orleans, where we’re formally introduced to Robertson as a real estate speculator in partnership with the smooth John Lithgow (in an auspicious screen debut).\n\nShortly thereafter, Bujold and the couple’s 10-year-old daughter are kidnapped. Robertson is ordered to deliver a ransom to a rotting wharf from a passing ferry, but he goes along with a harebrained police scheme to double-cross the kidnappers. The wife and daughter are apparently killed in a police chase.\n\nSeventeen years pass. Robertson, never remarried, frequently visists an enormous tomb — modeled on the church from the credits, where he met his late wife — in the middle of huge piece of prime land his partner, Lithgow, would love to turn into condominums.\n\nLithgow asks Robertson to accompany him on a business trip to Italy. Returning to the original church, he meets a young woman (also played by Bujold) who greatly resembles his late wife working as an assistant to art restorers. He asks her out to lunch and a romance ensues.\n\nEven back in less sophisticated 1976, it wasn’t hard to guess the movie’s big mystery. But DePalma, like Hitchcock, was less interested in mystery than in suspense (in this case, whether Robertson will consummate the relationship). Given a “second chance” with this doppleganger — a recurring theme in Hitchcock work as well as DePalma, but never used with the kind of finesse DePalma managed here — Robertson plans a big wedding in a New Orleans church that resembles the one in Italy.\n\nRobertson’s obsession with his wife’s young lookalike — in one of the most charming and appalling scenes he teaches Bujold her predecessor’s “Bryn Mawr walk” — understandably raises concern among his associates, particularly Lithgow. Especially when Robertson comes to him demanding a lot of cash in a hurry, just as he did in 1959 to meet the ransom demand.\n\n“Obsession” got mixed reviews at the time of its release. In some quarters, it was much criticized as an imitation of Hitchcock — but in the past 34 years, we’ve become much more accepting of filmmakers who comment on the work of their predecessors to achieve their own artistic vision, which is something DePalma definitely does here.\n\nThere were also complaints about the plausibility of the ending, which takes Hitchcock’s famous 360-degree shot of James Stewart and Kim Novak from “Vertigo” and turns into a gorgeous, emotionally resonant series of swirling pans around Robertson and Bujold (in an airport with very pre-9/11 security).\n\nThe truth is that on a strictly literal level, the ending of “Vertigo” is no more credible. There’s ample evidence, though, that the ending of both films are fantasies taking place in the protagonist’s imagination. This device confuses audiences and even some critics even today, when the ending of a film like “Black Swan” is subjected to a credibility test it was never meant to pass, no matter how many clues Darren Aronofsky has provided.\n\nThe thing I love about “Obsession” is that it’s possible to be deeply moved by, and even identify with, the plight of Cliff Robertson’s character, even as his obsession with his late wife passes the borderline into madness. This is something I’ve never felt about a character in any of DePalma’s other movies. For all of his technical virtuosity, DePalma has long been one of the coldest and most cynical filmmakers of his generation (Did I mention I was tempted to join the mob of people who walked out of the all-media for the over-the-top “Scarface” at the National Theater in 1983?).\n\nWhy does “Obsession” stand out? I think it’s because of screenwriter Paul Schrader, who shared DePalma’s obsession with “Vertigo” and wrote this movie just before his other ’80s masterpiece, “Taxi Driver” (which had Bernard Herrmann’s final score). DePalma and Schrader sadly never worked together again. Reportedly, they had a falling out when DePalma, on Herrmann’s advice, decided to scrap an epilogue set a decade after the main story (Schrader’s original script, “Deja Vu,” can be found on the French Blu-ray edition, which hopefully will be released in the U.S. by Sony).\n\nThe film’s theatrical distributor, Columbia Pictures, understandably had some reservations about the movie’s incest angle. DePalma brilliantly decided to turn Robertson and Bujold’s wedding (their cake is a brilliant visual gag) and wedding night into a dream sequence. Subtlety is a not a term that can often be applied to DePalma’s other work, but it’s this uncharacteristic restraint that helps make “Obsession” his masterpiece. The only time I met DePalma — at a junket for his 1986 comedy “Wise Guys” — he seemed puzzled that someone would love what he considered one of his less successful movies."
