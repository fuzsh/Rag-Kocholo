        "text": "In Mel Brooks' spoof of Westerns, \"Blazing Saddles,\" there's a moment when someone mentions the name \"Randolph Scott\" — at which point the townsfolk all put their hands over their hearts and utter, solemnly and in unison, \"Randolph Scott.\"\n\nScott was an actor with easygoing charm who made a wide variety of movies — more than 100 — from the 1930s to the early '60s. But he found his greatest success in Westerns, and several of them are among the 13 new-to-DVD cowboy films reviewed here.\n\nYou'll also see the genre's cliches in full force — six-guns with unlimited firing power, romantic triangles, a disgusted sheriff throwing his badge to the ground, whooping Indians, beautiful women who wake up and plow the land with perfect hair and makeup, people shot without bullet holes or blood, etc.\n\nMost of these films are in color, and many benefit from outdoor locations and great character actors in support. Some are better than others, but all are worth a look.\n\nSo if you need a last-minute gift for dear old Dad on Father's Day, here are some good suggestions, listed chronologically by each film's release date.\n\n\"The Plainsman\" (Universal, 1937, not rated, b/w, $14.98). This Cecil B. DeMille post-Civil War epic is over-the-top fiction and features Abe Lincoln, Gen. Custer, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickock and Calamity Jane! The focus is on Hickock (Gary Cooper) and Jane (Jean Arthur) trying to keep an evil trader (Charles Bickford) from selling rifles to the Cheyenne (with young Anthony Quinn in one scene as a Cheyenne warrior). Gabby Hayes also shows up in this uneasy but enjoyable mix of comedy and adventure. The highlight is funny banter between Hickock and Jane.\n\nExtras: Full frame, trailer, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"When the Daltons Rode\" (Universal, 1940, not rated, b/w, $14.98). Randolph Scott is a lawyer and friend of the rowdy Dalton clan, farmers who are forced to become outlaws when bad guys take away their land. Broderick Crawford and Brian Donlevy impress as two of the brothers, and the action is swift, with a lot more comedy than you might expect (primarily from Andy Devine).\n\nExtras: Full frame, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"The Spoilers\" (Universal, 1942, not rated, b/w, $14.98). Scott is the bad guy in this one, tangling with John Wayne and Marlene Dietrich in 1900 Nome, Alaska. There are some similarities to Wayne's \"North to Alaska\" (which would come 18 years later), and some racially insensitive jokes. But most of the way, it's fast-paced action and comedy, with a memorable barroom brawl between Scott and Wayne near the end. (Note that Wayne gets third billing under Scott and Dietrich.)\n\nExtras: Full frame, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"Albuquerque\" (Universal, 1948, not rated, $14.98). Filmed in the two-tone Cinecolor process, this one finds Scott as a nice guy who comes to New Mexico to work for his uncle, unaware that his uncle is a villain. So he takes up with a rival company, finds romance and has to fend off his uncle's henchmen, led by bullying Lon Chaney Jr. Gabby Hayes is hilarious as the film's comic relief.\n\nExtras: Full frame, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"Whispering Smith\" (Universal, 1948, not rated, $14.98). Alan Ladd is excellent here as a railroad marshal who discovers his childhood best friend (Robert Preston) has gone bad. It doesn't help that Ladd is in love with Preston's wife! William Demerest lends able support, and Donald Crisp is fine as the chief bad guy.\n\nExtras: Full frame, trailer, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"The Man From Colorado\" (Columbia, 1948, not rated, $19.95). Glenn Ford is a psychotic colonel who is made a federal judge when the Civil War ends, and William Holden is his best friend, the federal marshal, in this unusual \"psychological Western.\" Both actors are very good, with Ellen Drew providing the triangle love interest. Fascinating character study with unexpected twists and turns.\n\nExtras: Full frame, trailers, subtitle options (English, Japanese), chapters.\n\n\"Hangman's Knot\" (Columbia, 1952, not rated, $19.95). Randolph Scott leads a Rebel gang that learns too late that the Civil War has ended; Lee Marvin co-stars as one of his men, a ruthless killer. They are on the run, trying to get home to the South, when they find themselves holed up in a way station (a la \"Stagecoach\"), with Donna Reed and Richard Denning as hostages. Good action and dialogue, and an excellent cast make this one a winner.\n\nExtras: Full frame, trailers, subtitle options (English, Japanese), chapters.\n\n\"War Arrow\" (Universal, 1954, not rated, $14.98). Dennis Weaver as an Indian? Well, at least Jay Silverheels is here, too. Jeff Chandler stars in this routine yarn about people caught in a cavalry fort about to be overrun by Indians. So Chandler enlists another tribe to help ward them off. Good cast includes Noah Berry Jr., providing comic relief, and John McIntire as the hard-nosed colonel.\n\nExtras: Full frame, trailer, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"No Name on the Bullet\" (Universal, 1959, not rated, $14.98). Audie Murphy is a philosophizing hired killer who rides into town, and his mere presence stirs up a turmoil of paranoia. Who's he after? The town doctor, named \"Luke\" (Charles Drake), tries to find out. A well-made \"angel-of-death\" allegory (Murphy even plays chess, a la Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\"), in CinemaScope and color. Jerry Paris (the dentist-neighbor on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\") plays a deputy.\n\nExtras: Widescreen, trailer, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"Bandolero\" (Fox, 1968, PG-13, $14.98). Dean Martin and his gang rob a bank, but it's foiled when Raquel Welch and her husband walk in and he is killed. James Stewart, assuming the guise of the hangman, helps them escape. Along the way, they take Welch as a hostage, with sheriff George Kennedy in hot pursuit. The cast is great, and it's fun to watch Stewart and Martin in surprisingly less-than-sympathetic characterizations. But there are too many lapses in logic and plot points that don't add up.\n\nExtras: Widescreen, language options (English, Spanish, French), subtitle options (English, Spanish), chapters.\n\n\"Coogan's Bluff\" (Universal, 1968; R for nudity, drugs, violence; $14.98). This Clint Eastwood comedy-drama is a fish-out-of-water story with a cowboy twist. Eastwood stars as Coogan, an Arizona deputy sheriff in New York to pick up a psychotic bad guy (Don Stroud). When the bad guy escapes, Coogan tracks him down in the urban jungle, with assistance and hindrance from the local police lieutenant (Lee J. Cobb), an attractive parole officer (Susan Clark) and a dippy hippie (Tisha Sterling). Tightly directed by Don Seigel (\"Dirty Harry\"), with a great chase through Central Park at the end. (The R rating is for a scene in a disco with numerous nude women on display.)\n\nExtras: Widescreen, subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\n\"J.W. Coop\" (Columbia, 1972, PG-13, $19.95). Cliff Robertson co-wrote, produced and directed this melancholy look at modern rodeo, as a Texas rider released from a nine-year prison stretch, who finds the circuit has changed. Not that it stops him. Strong character study with a fine central performance by Robertson in the title role.\n\nExtras: Widescreen, trailers, chapters.\n\n\"Junior Bonner\" (MGM, 1972, PG, $14.95). This rodeo film that followed \"J.W. Coop\" some eight months later is even better, with director Sam Peckinpah also exploring the circuit and how it's changed. This time, however, Steve McQueen plays an aging champion rider from Arizona who returns home to confront his ghosts. Excellent supporting performances from Robert Preston and Ida Lupino as McQueen's estranged parents, Joe Don Baker as his brother and Ben Johnson as a local promoter. Funny, sad and smart.\n\nExtras: Widescreen, audio commentary, subtitle options (English, French, Spanish), chapters."
