        "text": "Josef Duchoň / movie poster designer, children’s book illustrator.\n\nJosef Duchoň started exhibiting as a member of Association of Czech Graphic Artists Hollar in mid 1950s. His artistic oeuvre includes mainly paintings, painted woodcuts, illustrations for children books and he is also author of 29 magical movie posters.\n\nHis work is extremely explosive, but not in a destructive way. On the other hand, Josef Duchoň is using the mixture of several artistic methods to reach viewer’s sensation. As a surreal artist his choice of collage technique is natural. Wonderful variation of live pastel colours achieved by the use of elegantly shaped and carefully placed woodcuts and his manipulation with objects is masterful. Thanks to monochrome cut outs and neat typography his movie posters are gaining quite significant depth and very vibrant character. You can read interesting article about him in our poster blog."
