        "text": "Cliff was an interesting addition to the cast. He was another actor from the long line of the Golden Hollywood era, to act in the wine country. His character Dr. Michael Ranson's first scene was during the burial of his aunt Jacqueline. An intellectual in every sense of the word, though he had a lack of confidence to perform surgery. This stemmed from circumstances years ago and yet his confidence would be tested again when Maggie had to be operated on. The operation was successful; Maggie got the all clear and the family was happy for him, as much as they were for her. Emma became attracted to Michael. The feeling was mutual for a while, until a certain Miss Terri Hartford got her claws into him. Terri had him just where she wanted; hook, line and sinker!\n\nA funeral is taking place, with Fr. Curtis officiating. A character who was in a lot of Falcon Crest history is being laid to rest. Many Tuscany Valley people are there, to pay their respects, (a scene from season 3, 1983 - '84):\n\nFr. Curtis: \"........May her soul and the souls of all the recently departed through the mercy of God rest in peace.\"\n\nThe funeral attendants sympathise with the bereaved.\n\nFr. Curtis offers his condolences to Maggie: \"Peace Maggie!\"\n\nMaggie: \"Thank you father!\"\n\nFr. Curtis then provides the same comfort to Vicki.\n\nVicki to Maggie: \"I just can't believe it.\"\n\nMaggie: \"I know. Come on Vicki.\"\n\nA dark haired man is standing behind mother and daughter.\n\nDr. Michael Ranson: \"Maggie.\"\n\nMaggie: \"Michael.\" They hug, \"Oh Michael. Michael I'm so glad you're here. We tried to reach you.\"\n\nMichael: \"Good to see you! Vicki. You've grown. How are you?\"\n\nVicki: \"I'm okay!\"\n\nMaggie: \"How did you find out?\"\n\nMichael: \"Oh family network. You know Chase's mother and my mother were always feuding but they were still sisters.\"\n\nMaggie: \"You'll drive in our car.\"\n\nMichael: \"Sure!\"\n\nMichael: \"I came by cab. I barely had a chance to change at the hotel.\"\n\nMaggie: \"Oh please you'll stay at our guest house.\"\n\nMichael: \"That's very kind. Thank you!\""
