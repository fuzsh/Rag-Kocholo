        "text": "The revival of his career towards the end of his life would be consolation for the California-born actor who was blacklisted from Hollywood for many years after his involvement in the Begelman scandal of 1977.\n\nHaving discovered that a cheque for $10,000 had been unlawfully written in his name, Robertson began an unrelenting investigation into the affair that led to the exposure of much larger-scale fraud in Hollywood.\n\nThis made him various enemies in Tinseltown and they put a damper on a career which until then had brought much success.\n\nRobertson was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor in 1968 for his interpretation of a man with special needs in Charly.\n\nHe had some practice playing such characters, having portrayed Joan Crawford’s lost soul of a husband in Autumn Leaves 12 years earlier.\n\nHis rise to stardom was boosted by roles in various television series such as The Days Of Wine And Roses (1958).\n\nIn 1963, John F Kennedy selected him to play the young president in PT 109, depicting the former navy officer’s Second World War heroics, an endorsement which helped bring Robertson’s career to prominence.\n\nIn 1965 he won an Emmy for his role in television drama The Game.\n\nRobertson was passionate about aviation and was flying a private plane over the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, when the first plane hit the North Tower.\n\nThe actor was brought up by his Scottish grandmother and uncle in La Jolla, California."
