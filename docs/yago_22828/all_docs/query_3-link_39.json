Still, simply by surviving in the business for over half a century, Robertson has demonstrated that he must have more inner strength and determination than one might suppose from some of his performances.\n\nIn his first decade as an actor, he mostly played small roles in films and on television, including some juvenile heroics in the forgotten, and probably lost, television series Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers, and first made an impact as a cynical surfer in Gidget (1959). Always a natural for roles in westerns, Robertson was persuasive as an 1847 pioneer who befuddledly stumbles into the present in one episode of The Twilight Zone, \"A Hundred Yards over the Rim,\" and displayed his propensity for victimhood in another episode, \"The Dummy,\" portraying a ventriloquist tormented by, and eventually replaced by, his sentient, malevolent dummy. As he gradually established himself as a major star—personally selected by President John F. Kennedy to portray him in the biopic PT 109 (1963) and playing an unscrupulous presidential candidate in The Best Man—the producers of a new series, The Outer Limits, undoubtedly imagined that it was a major coup to secure his services for their opening episode, \"The Galaxy Being,\" which billed Robertson as a special guest star. But he was oddly ineffectual, utterly unable to convey his character's obsessive devotion to radio research and strangely subdued while engaging in humanity's first conversation with an alien being. He did far better as laid-back, engaging western villain Shame in a two-part episode of Batman, unexpectedly earning the contrived character a return appearance.\n\nIn 1968, reprising a role he had played in an episode of The United States Steel Hour, Robertson gave his finest performance in Charly as a mentally retarded man, Charlie Gordon, whose intelligence is remarkably increased by scientists, though the effects of their experiment are tragically temporary. Surprisingly earning an Academy Award for his performance—he, Fredric March, and Don Ameche remain the only three actors who have won Oscars for their science fiction films—Robertson seemed well positioned to land more major roles, but during the 1970s he instead floundered in westerns and television movies, the only highlight being his performance as another weak man—Buzz Aldrin, the Apollo 11 astronaut who later suffered a nervous breakdown—in the television movie Return to Earth.\n\nThen, in 1977, he discovered that someone had forged his signature on a $10,000 check, and good guy Robertson did what any fine, upstanding citizen would do—he went to the police, inspired an investigation that eventually fingered studio executive David Begelman as the perpetrator of an embezzlement scheme, and freely discussed the case with the press. But, by the twisted logic of Hollywood, all of this made Robertson the bad guy, and he was effectively blacklisted for a few years for his impunity. He returned to the spotlight as a sympathetic yet pressured bureaucrat in Douglas TRUMBULL's uneven Brainstorm, and otherwise kept busy during the 1980s with a recurring role in the prime-time soap opera Falcon Crest (1983-1984) and more television movies.\n\nAlways able to contribute to, but not dominate, whatever proceedings he found himself in, he went on to play a beleaguered President of the United States in John CARPENTER's disastrous John Carpenter's Escape from L.A. and a disgraced astronaut seeking to reclaim his good name in an episode of the revived The Outer Limits, \"Joyride.\""
