        "text": "(1923–2011). American actor Cliff Robertson enjoyed a creditable career onstage and in television and movies and was particularly noted for his portrayal of Lieutenant John F. Kennedy in the movie PT 109 (1963). Robertson won an Academy Award for best actor for his role in Charly (1968), in which he played a mentally disabled floor sweeper who becomes a genius through the aid of surgery, only to revert after a time to his previous state.\n\nClifford Parker Robertson III was born on September 9, 1923, in La Jolla, California. Following World War II service in the merchant marine, he briefly attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Encouraged by the dean to pursue an acting career, he moved to New York, New York, where he studied at The Actors Studio.\n\nRobertson made his Broadway debut in Late Love (1953) and two years later his film premiere in the romantic drama Picnic (1955). Most of his work during this time was on TV, however, and in 1966 he earned an Emmy Award for his lead role in the drama “The Game” (1965), which was featured on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre. On the big screen Robertson was often cast as ambitious, talented, but obsessive men, notably as a sinister political candidate in The Best Man (1964), an amoral CIA chief in Three Days of the Condor (1975), and a widower tormented by the death of his wife in Obsession (1976).\n\nRobertson was briefly blacklisted in Hollywood after he filed a complaint in 1977 against David Begelman, the president of Columbia Pictures. Robertson accused Begelman of having forged his name on a $10,000 studio check. Begelman was fined $5,000 and given three years’ probation. Robertson returned to moviemaking in 1980 in The Pilot. His later film credits include Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken (1991), Renaissance Man (1994), and Spider-Man (2002) and its sequels (2004 and 2007). Robertson also served as a spokesperson for the telecommunications company AT&T. He died on September 10, 2011, in Stony Brook, New York."
