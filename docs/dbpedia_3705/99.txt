Hot Rod Circuit have titled and set a release date for their upcoming full length due out on Immortal Records. Titled The Underground is a Dying Breed, the disc is due out March 20th, 2007.

Front man Andy Jackson is producing the record at his own Jackalope Studio in Montgomery, Alabama. Tim O'Heir (All American Rejects, Say Anything) will be mixing. Jackson had this to say about the record:

[It] has a very raw, live feel. It is a little more stripped down and more classic Hot Rod Circuit. We really took our time writing and kind of found ourselves on this recordâ€¦we became Hot Rod Circuit
