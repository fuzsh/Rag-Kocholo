Meet Hot Rod Circuit—they’re an awesome emo band born right here in sunny Auburn, Alabama back in ’97! These guys love making catchy tunes that blend together emotions and cool indie vibes. Their journey started when they dropped their very own album called Mr. Glenboski while going by another name. That sweet win as “Best Unsigned Band” got things rolling big time!

​

Over the years, lots of talented folks jammed alongside the core crew of Andy Jackson, Jay Russell, Casey Prestwood, and Mike Poorman. Even dudes from Say Anything helped fill in during gigs now and then. But after hitting the stage hard until 2007, life took ‘em down a twisty path. For almost two whole years starting in 2005, there wasn't too much happening&mldr;until finally, they came back strong with fresh energy in 2011!

​

Since day one, Hot Rod Circuit brought amazing tracks into our lives, including hits like "Weak Warm" and "Irish Car Bomb" off their super rad debut album, "If I Knew Now What I Knew Then" in 1999. Later records saw changes behind those skins, welcoming Michael Poorman onto the kit. And let me tell ya, man, seeing them share stages with legends like Jimmy Eat World? Mindblowing stuff!

​

After saying goodbye to their devoted crowds through unforgettable performances across America, guess what happened? Fans couldn't get enough because rumor spread fast: Hot Rod Circuit would rise again! Sure thing, in 2011, they returned for a special gig at Krazy Fest, lighting up hearts everywhere once more. Since then, they continue bringing joy wherever they go. So if you ever see Hot Rod Circuit coming your way, don't hesitate—just grab tickets ASAP!

​

Nowadays, even though each member might do something else sometimes (like joining forces with groups like Say Anything), rest assured knowing that whenever these fellows decide to rev up their engines, magic happens every single time. Keep listening, my friend, cause greatness never stops flowing from Hot Rod Circuit!
