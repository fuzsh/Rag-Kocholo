        "text": "Anyone ever tried wiring TV Classics in the simplistic Hot Rod format? Just wondering if it opens the guitar up a little? I know Brian runs a lot of his guitars like this. I love the Setzer live sound. I have the Dyno Brain, 6G6B,...got a lot of recipe...please don't mention fingers or hands. I play my own style but I do like the general Setzer tone. Experiences? I will say the Classics are pretty bright. They'll get a little brighter with removing the tone pots but they'll also open up a little. Anyone tried this wiring scheme with TV Classics? Or, had a Gretsch from the factory with Classics wired like this?\n\nThanks. It's not a lot louder than the traditional circuit, but you can tell that nothing is holding the Classics back. It just lets the Classics do their thing.\n\nWith the 17\" body, the sound is just BIG.\n\nI installed a 500K push/pull knob in place of my tone-mud switch. when you pull up, the tone circuit is engaged w a .02 PIO cap, but down.. its out and hotrod circuit ensues. The reduced capacitance loading gives you a closer to Setz response. I geeked a bit more on mine by making a wiring harness from mogami cabling.\n\nI installed a 500K push/pull knob in place of my tone-mud switch. when you pull up, the tone circuit is engaged w a .02 PIO cap, but down.. its out and hotrod circuit ensues.

I was hoping you would weigh in. I’m a Mogami user for guitar cable as well but never thought about the harness....now you have me thinking.\n\nI'm going back to bed because when I saw this thread I thought it was going to be about the Munsters and their hotrod!\n\nHadn’t seen it that way, but you’re right.\n\nI'm going back to bed because when I saw this thread I thought it was going to be about the Munsters and their hotrod!\n\nHa ha! Good one.\n\nI'm going back to bed because when I saw this thread I thought it was going to be about the Munsters and their hotrod!\n\nDRAGULA!!\n\nRob Zombie!\n\nHa ha! Good one.\n\nSorry I diverted the post. It really was the first thing in my head early in the morning when I saw it.\n\nNice hotrod in here still way off topic.\n\nBack on the topic a bit, I wonder how the hotrod wiring would work on other Gretsch pups, Hilo's, or TV's TArmonds?\n\nI also wonder if I would like this wiring because I do enjoy having the separate volume controls and to add that we would no longer be in a hot rod wiring but a no tone wiring."
