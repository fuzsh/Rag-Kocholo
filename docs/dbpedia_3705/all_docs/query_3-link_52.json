        "text": "The intent of the HRD is to get clean out of the clean channel and get overdrive out of the drive channels.\n\nMaybe, but from what I remember of my old HRD, the clean still wasn't that terribly clean once you got to 4 or 5 - which I RARELY ever did. Mine, which was biased kinda hot I think - still kind of behaved like a Tweed amp on the volume knob. 4-6 out of 12 on the dial with humbuckers and the EQ dialed in normally and it was no longer a \"clean\" channel. But, it's been a few years, so I may be off base.\n\nAppreciate the input Jason.\n\nIt all started with the hot rod series, Didn’t it? For many of us that didn’t begin playing the real thing.\n\nI remember a time on the forums where the HRD clean was recognized as not being all that clean. Maybe it still isn’t.\n\nAfter I got ahold of my first NMV amp, a bf champ I tried to play the HRD to get that sound. That was when I first realized the HRD has the natural break up. I felt it was overly controlled, not exciting and not the same. I thought the best sound was had by running the drive channel with just a little drive.\n\nLooking closer at the schematics, based on the voltages, the deluxe is a 35 W amp and the DeVille is 55.\n\nSo the HRdeluxe is a low powered amp for its size and isn’t going to have the most headroom.\n\nHere is my break down of the gain in the HRD and the 59 Bassman RI based on the voltages in the schematics\n\nHere are some flaws.\n\nBoth schematics input a small 4 mV signal. The deluxe puts out 5.3 volts on the 8 ohm load for 3.5 volts or 10% of full out put. The schematic says to apply signal voltage at j4 to get to full power. V*v/r\n\nThe bassman with the same small input some how put out full power? 10? Volts at 2 ohms for an even fifty Watts?\n\nThe HRD schematic says the voltage testing occurs with the yellow drive channel engaged. I am interested in the clean channel so basically I am ignoring this, but the drive channel disengages the 2nd stage bypass cap, and I am considering that. So...\n\nFirst interstage:\n\nThis is a straight across the board comparison between the HRD and the 59. They both have volume control and series resistance.\n\nThe 59 has a gain of 0.52.\n\nThe HRD has a gain of 0.07\n\nThis round goes to the Bassman.\n\nBoth amps have a 220K resistor in series with the next grid but the deluxe has the resistor before the volume pot and the bassman has it after the volume pot. That’s a big loss of gain for the hot rod.\n\nAt this point the signal on the plates of the power tubes is\n\nBassman 257 volts\n\nHRD 66.5 volts\n\nThe bassman s gain looks to be four times the HR deluxe.\n\nThen there is the OT and the 2 versus 8 ohm speaker impedance.\n\nAnd then again there is the difference between the schematics where the bassman appears to develop full power from a small signal and the hot rod does not.\n\nOverall I think the HR Deluxe has less pre amp gain than the 59 bassman RI.\n\nFrom a player perspective, aHRD has cleans and breakup much like a cross between a BF and tweed Bassman (makingnit better than either, for me) and breaks up about where I’d expect. The Drive channel has a slightly different sound and feel even worse the Drive low.\n\nWhatever the wattage it’s damn loud. Easily as loud as a tweed Bassman reissue IME, even with a different speaker complement.\n\nIf you're looking at the 59 Reissue schematic for those numbers, and it looks like you are, you've got a problem there. The Reissue uses a 7025 tube in V1 which is basically a 12AX7. A 12AY7 in circuit should develop a gain factor of about 34.\n\nYou're basically comparing the HRDlx to a JTM45.\n\nSent from my Pixel 2 using Tapatalk"
