        "text": "Hi guys I was looking at the fender hot rod deluxe 1st generation schematic, and noticed that in the old blackface amps the first preamp stage isn't present. I was wondering from an engineering standpoint what purpose does this play in this amp and what effect would bypassing it and wiring a post tonestack volume have. I am aware that this will probably disconnect the drive but that is not a problem for me and I'm sure many others? I attached the schematic of the amp and a super reverb for comparison. Please correct me if I'm wrong I'm in the very early stages of understanding amp design.\n\nAttachments\n\nsuper_reverb_ab763_schem.gif\n\nHot_Rod_Deluxe_schematic.pdf\n\nThe first gain stage adds more overdrive to the preamp. It works like a booster but in my opinion it lacks in terms of tightness and usable gain but it is a Fender amp so most probably many people won´t like that in a Fender amp anyway.\n\nDrop the first gain stage and you have the normal Blues Deluxe amp.\n\nBecause you asked about pre tone stack volume and booster stages maybe study some Friedman amps would be the real deal for you but then you would be more into Marshall territory.\n\nAll the best,\n\nRobin\n\nAh I see so, I should have looked at the blues deluxe schematic, I just assumed it was a 60 watt only clean channel but same idea as the hot rod. I assumed it adds more gain similar to a fet input or as you said booster, I just wasn't sure bypassing it would cause harm to the circuit in its operation. Friedman you say I shall check it out for sure the more you know hey. I've really been studying old amp circuits and evolutions in all routes Marshall, dumble, mesa, fender all I can really. I've done alot of pedals and some amp mods nothing major like bypassing gain stages in amps haha. Thanks so much for your help and info.\n\nHere's an idea for a hot rod deluxe the preamp stays in the circuit when I use the lo gain 2 channel but bypasses it using the high gain 1 channel. Aby pedal for a pre gain boost? What do you guys think?\n\nSorry I had a look at the blues deluxe schematic and it appears the clean channel of the blues deluxe is the same the drive channel seems to add an extra preamp post clean signal and switches in the drive pot to replace the vol. My question was v1a in both the deluxe circuits. In the hotrod and blues the signal is v1a bright switch and vol > v1b tonestack > v1b > PI. blackface circuits appear to be v1a tonestack then volume > v1b > PI. I imagine this would still imagine it's acting like a booster but why on the clean channels. Will bypassing this drive the volume down too much. Sorry if I'm just not getting something\n\nPutting the volume after the tonestack changes the sound of the amp and makes the tonestack more \"effective\".\n\nVolume in front of the tonestack makes the amp sound more vintage and makes the tonestack less effective.\n\nIt all depends how the rest of the circuit is designed as well.\n\nEvery change you make changes the sound and the response of the amp.\n\nStudy some of the more modern mods and you soon discover what they do and how you can use them.\n\nJose mod (Marshall)\n\nTonestack mods\n\nSoldano preamp cascaded, cathode follower\n\nMaster volume, PPIMV\n\nAldrich mod (Marshall)\n\nStudy some Dumble schematics\n\nAll the best,\n\nRobin\n\nThanks robin, heaps of great info. I'm aware of the tonestack volume loss in terms of pedal design and it seems it's the same here I, makes sense considering they are both preamp designs. I have done a fair bit on dumble and most of them seem to use the clean channel of the blackface design, hence lead me to start this thread haha.\n\nAgain sorry if I'm oversimplying the amp designs here, but if I place the tonestack before the 2nd gain stage v2a in the hot rod or alot of other Tweed based designs, so as to get the same as the blackface design. Would this make make the 3rd gain stage redundant. Leaving the gain channel and any tonestack value differences aside for now?\n\nEdit: ( reading an old amp book, is the Tweed what's referred to as a cathode follower, and that's really what I should have said at the start, sorry still learning the circuits and lingo.)\n\nYes, the tonestack drops the volume/signal level.\n\nA cathode follower is there to drive a tonestack with less impedance.\n\nYou can do the same using another gain stage (to get back the volume/signal level after the tonestack).\n\nThe sound is totally different.\n\nA cathode follower (Marshall/Fender Tweed Bassman) compresses the signal more and makes it more edgy. Soldano uses that as well.\n\nhttp://www.valvewizard.co.uk/dccf.html\n\n(lots of great information)\n\nAll the best,\n\nRobin\n\nSo would a switchable cathode follower be a decent idea? I know it works as a buffer and prevents signal loss but I really would like to hear for myself the effect on tone as I have read it could effect tone others say it doesn't. This is all going towards one of my uni projects, haha yeah I somehow conned my lecturer into letting me do a project on amp design haha turning out a little more involved, they don't teach you about tubes no more, outdated technology haha. Also do I require some sort of isolation relay or will a sufficiently rated spdt do the job, for a cathode follower switch?\n\nYes, outdated technology. My father learned all that stuff during his Engineer studies but that was back in the ´60s when Germany still made the great Telefunken tubes. Even in school they learnt that stuff - around the time Einstein died xD\n\nAnyway..\n\nFor testing just use a switch(switch only when amp is switched off) . Mute the channel while switching right before the PI (as late in the circuit as you can) you would have to use a MOSFET for switching the voltage . You like the CF or not. You won´t like it to be switchable I am sure.\n\nThe CF will add some overtones to your sound which you may like or not. Soldano SLO is a typical example or the Marshall Plexi, JCM800 etc.\n\nThe Aldrich mod I already mentioned turns the CF into a 4th gain stage (ENGL amps use that design as well).\n\nTry it out and hear if you like a CF better than an additional stage(which just adds more gain anyway).\n\nThis is an endless field of creating sounds - don´t get lost.\n\nKeep your design as simple as you can and always make sure you tweak just one single thing. It all adds up in the end.\n\nAll the best,\n\nRobin\n\nCheers Robin, man you are a walking encyclopaedia of amp design, well definitely compared to me. Okay take out the switch scenario would a jumper around the cathode follower or a series circuit around it be possible. I know this is more than possible in transistor design low voltages, I just haven't done a lot of high voltage testing or designing, sorry feel free to not answer if you feel like I'm missing something obvious, Sometimes I'm a little slow to realise haha."
