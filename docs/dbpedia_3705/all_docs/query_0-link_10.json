The band subsequently moved to Connecticut and released \"If I Knew Now What I Knew Then\" under their present moniker. [ [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3f9us33ia3dg Diana Potts of All Music Guide] ]\n\nHot Rod Circuit's first record, \"If I Knew Now What I Knew Then\" hit stores on September 21, 1999. The Band was comprised of Andy Jackson on Vocals and Rhythm Guitar, Casey Prestwood on Lead Guitar, Jason Russell on Bass and Vocals, and Wes Cross on drums. The disc featured songs such as \"Weak Warm\", \"Remover\", and \"Irish Car Bomb\", which still to this day remains a fan favorite. The band had done several shows that year in the New England area, along with tours that had the band \"Jazz June\". The band's drummer, Wes Cross left the band by before their next release.\n\nThe next album released by HRC hit record stores in September 2000; it was named \"If It’s Cool With You, It’s Cool With Me\" and remains to be one of their more popular records. The record included songs such as \"The Power of the Vitamins\", \"This is Not the Time or Place\", and \"Flight 89\". The record also featured the bands first taste of radio airplay when their single \"Radio Song\" came in at number two on the college radio charts. In addition drummer Michael Poorman became Wes Cross's replacement.In support of the release, Hot Rod Circuit did national tours with bands such as \"Jimmy Eat World\" and \"Reggie and the Full Effect\". They also did an acoustic tour with \"The New Amstradams\".The band also released a video of the song \"Flight 89\", which was directed by Gorman Berchard. The band at this point had gone as far as possible with Triple Crown Records, and it was now time for the band to take a large leap forward.\n\nDuring 2001, Hot Rod Circuit was receiving several offers from different record labels such as \" Drive Thru\" and \"MCA\", that were eagar for the band to sign. By the fall of 2001, Hot Rod had signed with \"Vagrant Records\". Hot Rod Circuit's third record, \"Sorry About Tomorrow\" hit stores on March 12, 2002. The record proved to be their greatest to date, and had garned the band with the most success out of their whole career. The record was filled with great sing-alongs such as \"At Nature's Mercey\", \"Radiation Suit\", \"Safely\", and more. The band had also released their largest hit, \"The Pharmacist\". This record had brought the band to a whole new world. In, 2002, Hot Rod had played over 250 shows, and several of them were headlining. The band had toured with bands such as New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Saves the Day, Superchunk, Hot Water Music, and many more. The band had also taken Dashboard Confessional on one of their first national tours. The band did a music video for the hit, \"The Pharmacist\" as well. Hot Rod Circuit was at the climax of their career when they did a two week tour in Europe, including the Reading and Leeds Festivals, where over 15,000 people were singing along their music. Singer Andy Jackson states, \"This was the first record I can honestly say I wrote and took some time on lyrics and breaking it all down.\" \"Sorry About Tomorrow\" launced the band to their highest point in their career's and proves to be most fans' favorite record of theirs. In addition to that Triple Crown Records released a B-Sides record entitled \"Been There, Smoked That\". The record featured material that was written while under the name \"Antidote\", and a few songs that were recorded live during their acoustic tour with \"The New Amstradams\".After three years of being in the band, drummer Mike Poorman left due to personal issues.\n\nIn 2004 Hot Rod Circuit went into the studio to make their follow-up to 2002's \"Sorry About Tomorrow\". In August of 2004, Hot Rod released \"Reality's Coming Through,\" their second for Vagrant Records. This record proved to get less of a possiive reaction as their stellar record \"Sorry About Tomorrow.\" \"Reality's Coming Through\" had a darker feel to it, much of the music coming from Andy Jackson's real life issues such as a divorce he was going through at the time. The record essentially covered all genre's including the indie opener, \"Inhabit.\" In addition to that a mellow song that resembled somewhat of a 50's rock, \"Save You,\" the poppy, \"Cheap Trick,\" and the pedal steel tinged \"The Best You Ever Knew.\" Andy Jackson stated, \"Fans either loved it, or hated it. We didn't want to make \"Sorry About Tomorrow\" again.\n\nIn March 2005, Jay Russell left the band due to the death of his father. Russell went on to pursue his own band and get involved in his family business. HRC had finished a tour with Piebald, Hit the Lights, and I am the Avalanche in November 2005, which many thought was their last. Hot Rod had stated they would be releasing a new record in 2006, but rumor had it that the band's relationship with Vagrant Records had become strained, due to the less commercial success with their last record. For the most part in 2006, Hot Rod Circuit had made no mention of news, or tours, with the exception of about a 6 or 7 shows they did sporatically, on the east coast. Word was out that Vagrant Records had dropped the band, and rumors said that the band had broken up. In addition to that, in the earlier part of the year, Andy Jackson's home burned to the ground, and he and his family lost everything. Bands such as Brand New had done a few shows, to benefit Andy Jackson and his family. In late summer of 2006, the band released a demo song entitled \"Stateside\". This was the first news about the band in over 8 months. At an unannounced show in Connecticut in fall of 2006, Hot Rod stated that they had signed with Immortal Records.\n\nHot Rod Circuit signed with Immortal Records and recorded their new full length for the label titled \"The Underground Is a Dying Breed\" mixed by Tim O'Heir. The record hit stores on March 20, 2007 via Immortal Records. The record was an attempt to win back some success and fans. In April 2007, Hot Rod hit the road with Limbeck and the Forecast in support of the record. This record would be the logical follow-up to \"Sorry About Tomorrow.\" The new record had that classic \"Hot Rod\" sound, and had that feel-good summertime vibe to it. The record featured songs such as \"Vampire,\" which included the bands first use of the violin. In addition to that songs that had to do with Andy Jackson's view on life and his response to the tragic fire him and his family went through. The record included songs like \"What We Believe In,\" and the pedal steeled \"U.S. Royalty,\" and their new single, \"Stateside\". The band went on to play 6 weeks of the 2007 Warped Tour. In addition Hot Rod played a week tour in Australia, opening for Paramore.\n\n.\n\nIn fall of 2007, Andy Jackson's side project, \"Death in the Park,\" announced that Immortal Records had gone out of business.\n\nOn October 08, 2007. HRC announced on MySpace, that they would be breaking up after playing for 10 years. They played a farewell tour which ended on December 12, 2007 at Toad's Place in New Haven, CT. Songs were played in chronological order to a crowd shouting, \"I feel somewhat morose,\" in which the response from Casey was, \"We should have a celebration instead of a funeral, ya know?\" The band did a round of shots together a couple songs in, and ended with an encore that rivals great set lists.
