        "text": "As a boy Casey grew up in the southeast US. He took interest in Music as a teen and began playing out at the age of 14 in Alabama. After a long stint with the rock band Hot Rod Circuit, in which played guitar and pedal steel, Casey recorded his first country album, The Hurtin’ Kind, in 2006. It featured Hot Rod Circuit Drummer Dan Duggins and a group of local players as well as out of town session guests. After half a year of local playing, and sometimes playing at the end of Drag The River sets on the road, Casey did a short tour with Salt Lake City’s Alt country band The Band of Annuals. Utilizing their players as back up musicians.\n\nThings had pretty much run it’s course, and Casey was nearly done with music before he met Kevin Finn. Kevin was a drummer that had moved to town from Austin Texas. Kevin’s musical ability and determination jump started Casey’s band now called Casey James Prestwood and The Burning Angels. Now the band is about to embark on another tour out east. They have 3 albums recorded with 2 more in the works. The Burning Angels can be seen in Denver frequently, but play all over the state."
