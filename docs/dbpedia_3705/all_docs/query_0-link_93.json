        "text": "We're proud of our heritage here in Chattanooga, Tennessee, so when the Chattanoooga Motorcar Festival was announced a few years ago, we could've have been happier. The event has grown in its short four-year history, and it's something we look forward to every October. This year, the event featured a road rally, Grand Prix racing on the redesigned road course, a Mecum classic car auction, a Car Club gathering, a B-52's concert, V8's in the Village (we'll talk more about that in a miniute), a Ferrari gathering, a Porsche gathering and of course, Sunday's\n\nThe NSRA Street Rod Nationals has been rolling for more than 50 years, thanks to the hard work and dedication from the National Street Rod Association staff, and the thousands of folks who attend the event each year. It's held at the Kentucky Expo Center in Louisville, Kentucky, which has a GIANT vendor building, and room for more than 10,000 cars on the property. Other activities include a swap meet, a nitro-burning cacklefest, a Builder's Showcase, and much more. Vehicles 1993 and older are eligible to participate, but it's mostly 1980 and older with a heavy emphasis\n\nIt's always a high priority for Coker Tire, Honest Charley and any automotive aftermarket company to promote the collector car hobby and encourage enthusiasts to actually get their cars out and drive them! First and foremost, driving your car wears out tires, so that's job security for our team here in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but it's also a key element in keeping the hobby alive for future generations. If these timeless classic cars stay stored inside a garage for months and years at a time, it'll be hard to influence today's youth with good old fashioned American iron. That's why Collector Car Appreciation Day was born.\n\nThe 2023 Hemmings Motor News Great Race presented by Coker Tire is underway! We started the 2,300-mile journey on Saturday, June 24th in St. Augustine, Florida and we'll be crossing the finish line in Colorado Springs, Colorado on Sunday, July 2nd. This event covers nine states in nine days, using mostly back roads to string together an intricate course that the racers follow closely. We're big supporters of the Great Race, and love to see our customers go out there and put their vehicles to the test. A great percentage of the cars and trucks in competition are rolling on Coker Tire products, but we're always looking to improve upon that ratio of Coker customers. To help with that, we're providing $500 gift certificates to each day's daily winner, plus other incentives. With 16 hosted city stops, including the green flag ceremony and Grand Finish, this event puts a smile on lots of faces, and we're happy to be a part of it. Take a look at some of our highlights, and be sure to check out\n\nThe Goodguys Nashville Nationals is one of the best car shows in the Mid South, and features a lot of great hot rods, customs, muscle cars, classic trucks and more. Last year, the Nashville Nationals moved from its downtown venue to the Nashville Superspeedway, giving it more room to grow and MUCH easier traffic flow in and out of the event grounds. We had a booth setup in the vendor area, and we took a little time to walk around and snap a few photos of cars wearing our products. We also had the opportunity to give away the Best Wide Whites award, and it went to Mike and Kate Cioli from Portland, Tennessee. They brought a beautiful 1957 Ford Thunderbird to the show and we later found out it had been in the family since 1969! The Colonial White paint, the 312ci Y-block and classic fender skirts gave this T-Bird a timeless look, and of course, it was rolling on a set of our Coker Classic 205/75R14 wide whitewall radial tires. It was the perfect choice for our Best Wide Whites award!\n\nThe Great Race Spring Regional Rally presented by Stahls Automotive Foundation is a new event created by the Great Race staff, and it's something that's been in the works for quite some time. The rally is a great warm-up for the main 2023 Great Race event, which happens June 24th through July 2nd and travels from St. Augustine, Florida to Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Spring Regional Rally uses the same basic concept of time speed distance rallying, but shortens it to three days, and features a cloverleaf design (instead of going town to town). This type of rally happens a few times a year through independent organizers, but the Great Race sanctions this Spring Regional Rally as a way to help rookies learn the ropes, while also providing great practice for the veterans.\n\nThe Great Race Spring Regional Rally was based out of Auburn, Indiana for this inaugural event. Next year, it will be held in Chesterfield, Michigan, home of the Stahls Automotive Foundation Museum, and then it will continue to move to other locations. Additional regional rally events are in the works to offer racers more opportunities to compete. The Spring Regional Rally in Auburn, Indiana proved to be competitive and fun, with nearly 70 competitors making the trip to the car crazy town in Northeast Indiana. The city of Auburn rolled out the red carpet for the Great Racers, as did the local automotive museums, such as the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Museum, the National Auto & Truck Museum and the Early Ford V8 Museum. All three museums opened their doors to the participants, adding to the fun of this springtime rally event.\n\nCoker Tire, the worldâ€™s largest manufacturer and supplier of tires and wheels for collector vehicles is now the presenting sponsor of the Great Race, a time speed endurance rally for vintage vehicles. Coker Tire has supported the Great Race in many ways since the 1990â€™s, providing sponsorship, as well as volunteer help, tire service and much more. With this new agreement, Coker Tire stepped up from its previous sponsorship role into the presenting sponsor of the event, which takes place each summer.\n\nThe 2023 Hemmings Motor News Great Race presented by Coker Tire travels from St. Augustine, Florida to Colorado Springs, Colorado, over the course of nine days: June 24 to July 2.\n\nCoker Tire CEO Mike Kealey said, â€œCollector car enthusiasts have a choice when it comes to tires, and weâ€™re glad the Great Race community values the authenticity and reliability of our products for such a demanding rally.â€ He continued, â€œApproximately 80 percent of Great Race participants\n\nThe Corvette Expo has been around since the 1970's and it has gone through a lot of phases through its successful lifetime. This event has always been held in East Tennessee, although it has changed venues several times. It has found a home at the LeConte Center in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, a beautiful facility that offers plenty of room for this awesome event. There are hundreds of Corvettes on hand, ranging from the earliest C1's to the most recent C8 generation. We love the variety when walking through the show, because you can see NCRS judging on high end Corvette restorations, as well as modified cars and drivers. Take a look at some of our favorites, and make plans to join the fun next spring for the Corvette Expo. Check out www.corvetteexpo.com for more information!\n\nCorky Coker's collection of antique motorcycles is one of the finest in the world, and it's housed inside the Coker Museum in downtown Chattanooga, Tennessee. Corky's collection of cars, trucks and motorcycles features a great variety of our product lines, which covers a huge span of collector vehicles. In this article, we wanted to focus specifically on motorcycles, as the Coker Museum is packed with incredible motorcycles, dating back to the 1900's. From the earliest two-wheel machines to more civilized motorcycles of the 1950s and 1960s, this collection has iconic motorcycles, such as Harley Davidson, Indian, Excelsior, Thor, and more! The collection is diverse, with a mixture of beautiful restorations, true barn finds and bikes with legitimate racing history.\n\nWe're always looking for ways to improve our products and customer experience, and this new selection of 303 tire care products is a welcomed addition to our tire and wheel offerings. We're proud to announce the availability of a trio of 303Â® products, specially formulated for your tires and wheels. Compared to the regular cleaners you can get at the local department store, 303Â® products are safe to use for your specialty products and the strong formulas work quickly! Our team personally tested 303Â® products and we think you'll be impressed with the quality of the cleaners.\n\nIn only its third year of operation, the Chattanooga Motorcar Festival continues to grow in stature, as one of the premier automotive events in the Southeast. Being held in Chattanooga, Tennessee, it makes perfect sense for Coker Tire to be involved in this highly acclaimed event, and we participated more than ever this year. Our biggest contribution to the event was the V8's in the Village presented by Coker Tire and Paragon Corvette Reproductions. This special event celebrated American V8 engines, and made for a fun Saturday in the West Village area of downtown Chattanooga, Tennessee. A special group of Corvettes and V8-powered muscle cars, hot rods and classic trucks rolled into town and enjoyed the day's activities.\n\nAs summertime approaches, the crew here at Coker Tire prepares itself for one of the coolest old car adventures of all time. It’s called the Hemmings Motor News Great Race presented by Hagerty Drivers Club and it’s an event that Coker Tire owns and organizes in-house. This event is a time, speed, endurance rally for cars built in 1974 and earlier, and it’s an event with nearly 40 years of history under its belt. Coker Tire bought the operation in 2010 and the Chattanooga crew put together its first rally in 2011. Now, more than 10 years later, we’ve covered a lot of ground in the United States and Canada, and we’re ready to rack up some more miles this summer.\n\nWhen car enthusiasts initially hear about the Great Race, they often compare it to the Hot Rod Power Tour or other long distance car tours. While the distance can sometimes be comparable, the experience is very different, as\n\nJanuary is always auction season for the collector car market, and one of the big players is the Barrett-Jackson Collecctor Car Auction, held in Scottsdale, Arizona. This event gets LIVE TV coverage and often sets the tone for value trends in the market. We watch the auctions closely to monitor popular vehicles and base our new products around those up-and-coming markets. But more importantly, we travel to the show and set up our 18-wheeler rig to display our tires and engage with our customers. Barrett-Jackson was a huge success for us this year, and we spotted lots of great cars using Coker Tire products. Take a look at some of our favorites, and be sure to check out our Event Schedule to see when we'll be coming to a town near you!\n\nMecum Kissimmee is the ultimate kick-off to the 2022 season and we've made it back safely from our two-week trip to Central Florida. Mecum Kissimmee 2022 was packed with beautifully restored collector vehicles, ranging from the Teens all the way up to brand new super cars. As always, this is the largest Mecum Auctions event of the year and this time, more than 3,500 cars rolled across the auction block over the course of the 11-day auction. Coker Tire is proud to be the Exclusive Tire and Wheel Sponsor for Mecum Auctions and we were pleasantly surprised by the number of cars and trucks rolling on Coker Tire products. Ranging from wide whitewalls to redlines and everything in between, our product lines were well represented, so we wanted to provide a gallery of photos, as well as a recap video from the Sunshine\n\nWhen it comes to high end automotive events, there are staples in the industry--Pebble Beach and Amelia Island come to mind. While those events have become a long-standing tradition, the newest addition to this style of event is the Chattanooga Motorcar Festival. This event came about in 2019 and set the bar pretty high, with amazing cars, automotive celebrities and wonderful fellowship. After cancelling the 2020 event due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Chattanooga Motorcar Festival staff had plenty of time to plan for a mind-blowing 2021 event.\n\nThe most highly anticipated Great Race of all time is ready to wave the green flag! We'll be heading out to San Antonio, Texas to support the premier time, speed, endurance rally for vintage vehicles, as it blasts off and heads through eight states on its way to the finish line in Greenville, South Carolina. The route passes through scenic areas and the racers will have access to several great car collections along the way. After taking a year off due to the pandemic, we're SO READY to hit the road with 120 vehicles, all built in 1974 or earlier. With more than $150,000 up for grabs, these guys and girls are serious about competition. Watch our page for daily updates, and as always, keep an eye on our Facebook and Instagram pages for even more content. To see if the Hemmings Motor News Great Race presented by Hagerty Drivers Club is coming to a town near you, go to www.greatrace.com.\n\nWhen springtime comes around, we love sneaking up to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee for car shows. There are several shows that take place in March, April and May, giving us lots of excuses to make the drive up to check them out. Such is the case with the Corvette Expo, which now features the Chevelles in the Smokies special section. This event is one of the first events of the car show season, and this year it was packed with participants and people. The LeConte Center in Pigeon Forge offers indoor and outdoor space for show cars, parts vendors and a nice swap meet. There are group driving activities and lots of fun stuff throughout the event. We spotted dozens of great Corvettes and Chevelles wearing our products, ranging from numbers matching big block Corvettes to modified \"Day 2\" style Chevelles and more. We noticed LOTS of redline tires, a mixture of authentic bias ply tires and our modern\n\nCoker Tire is proud to announce the availability of new BFGoodrich Silvertown radial tires, sized at 275/65R16, a perfect fitment for the rear of hot rods and classic trucks. This addition to Coker Tire's already popular line of BFGoodrich Silvertown radials continues to increase fitments and fill in gaps in the tire industry. This new 275/65R16 is perfect for the rear of a hot rod or street rod that is utilizing 16x8-inch wheels. The tires come in at 30 inches tall, and measure 11 inches wide when inflated. The new tire is available with a 2-7/8-inch wide whitewall and it's also available with a smooth black sidewall. The tires are made in America, and offer great ride quality and an old school look.
