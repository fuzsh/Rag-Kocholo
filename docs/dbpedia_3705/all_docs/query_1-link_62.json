He is also the frontman of Maylene And The Sons Of Disaster. On this episode, we discuss the music scene, coming up in central Florida and booking DIY shows, the start of Underoath, and why he eventually left the band in 2003, touring, eventually leading the start of his current band, Maylene And The Sons Of Disaster. From there, we discuss Maylene's new music, religion and beliefs, and throughout then whole episode we discuss the horrific ATV accident that almost took Dallas' life in 2016.\n\nTo provide insight on the injuries that Dallas suffered in his accident, here is a direct quote that Dallas posted on his Instagram page on 12/18/2016:\n\n\"On August 2nd I had a four wheeler accident. I Broke every bone in my face. Cracked my skull. Have a brain injury and bleeding on my brain.My face came apart from my skull in two places. Have a fully blocked carotid artery. Broke my arm really bad have plates now. Ripped my left ear down to the canal. The other ear has blood behind it so I can't hear well. Have blood on my lungs and lung atrophy from the ventilator and tracheotomy which causes my oxygen to be always low. Broke my upper and lower jaw had to have it wired shut. Had a trama stroke so I can't feel the right side of my face from that my teeth don't come together because of the weak muscle. Can't track left or right in my right eye and I can't produce tears in my eyes. I can't feel my eye either so I don't know when to blink and from no tears my vision is extremely blurry. Lost vision in my left eye for good. In a nutshell that's what happened...\"\n\nDallas' links & socials:\n\nDallas' Instagram: @dallasttaylor\n\nMaylene And The Sons Of Disaster Instagram: @matsod\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/matsod\n\nTwo Week Notice Podcast partners:\n\n⁠www.piebald.com⁠ | Instagram: @piebald\n\nFurnace Fest - for tickets & more info, visit ⁠https://www.furnacefest.us/ ⁠\n\nFollow Furnace Fest on Instagram: @furnacefest & @furnace_fest_community\n\nGo to ⁠www.plugyourholes.com⁠ and enter the code \"TWNPOD\" at checkout for a 15% discount\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/UnearthOfficial - New Unearth record drops May 5, 2023.
