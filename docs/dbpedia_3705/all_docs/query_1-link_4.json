        "text": "There are always questions from fans about this incredible event, so I thought I'd put together all my notes from my research over the years. ~ Monster\n\nThe Vision\n\nAt the end of 1994 and into the beginning of 1995, HOT ROD magazine had gone through a lot of changes; David Freiburger left the staff to become editor of 4-Wheel & Off-Road and Drew Hardin assumed the Editor responsibilities from Steve Campbell. John Dianna (Executive Publisher) had created a series of new events called Power Festivals and directed Drew to develop ways to significantly support and expand them.\n\nThe staff brainstormed ideas from the obvious ways they could excite readers about the new series using magazine articles and editorials, all the way to the extreme, by racing to the events Bubblegum Rally style. Another idea was to show the readers that the staff were hands-on enthusiasts, just like them and to drive their own cars from Los Angeles to the first Power Festival at Norwalk Raceway in Norwalk, Ohio. They quickly decided to also invite the readers to join in; for the whole drive, a leg of the journey, to meet up at dinner stops, or just to wave to them from an overpass or the side of the road as they went by, with the intent to meet as many readers along the way as possible.\n\nOrigins\n\nDrew loved the idea, so the staff got together to determine how many had cars in good enough condition to make the trip in four months. After the dust settled, eight staffers had committed to make the epic journey along with their projects.\n\nJeff Smith would bring his 65 Malibu, setting a goal to get at least 20 mpg with a car that could run 12s. Unfortunately, he lost a cylinder just before the trip and had to replace the motor with a 355ci hed built, along with a Richmond six-speed and achieved an impressive 23 mpg.\n\nWill Handzel drove his rat rod Budget Beater 31 Model A with a great rusty patina, including saddle blankets for seat covers. Karl Brauer (Editorial Assistant) brought his 70 GTX and Rob Kinnan his freshly painted 67 Ford Fairlane. Rob was also in charge of bringing the Crusher Camaro too, which they knew everyone would want to see.\n\nCole Quinnell had a 68 Nova, used for a series of drag strip articles, swapping various rear gears and torque converters. Gray Baskerville was exhaustively hassled until he relented to bring his beautiful real steel, original-bodied 32 Ford coupe.\n\nJohn Dianna drove his 35 Chevy sedan delivery and even though Freiburger was no longer on staff, he brought the Cheap Thrills 68 Dodge Dart along anyhow. Everyone had mechanical work to get done before they would be ready for the cross-country trip.\n\nThe Plan\n\nThe biggest challenge was planning something on this scale. Establishing a route using paper maps, determining daily travel distances for the eclectic group of vehicles and then arranging for something cool when they arrived at each nights stop.\n\nThey also had to get the word out. Since it was early January, the March issue was already being finalized. In his March 1995 editorial, Drew wrote; Join us on our Power Tour. Were driving several of our project vehicles and personal cars from Los Angeles to Norwalk, Ohio, to attend the first Power Fest. The trip should be a blast, and we want a bunch of you to join us. They also repeated this message along with the intended route and stops in the next couple of issues. On page 39 of the Saturday, April 22, 1995 edition of The San Bernardino County Sun, they published this article:\n\nHot rods to zoom across US !\n\nHot Rod Magazine wants to get Motoring Cruises back to its roots with an 8-day caravan from LA. to Ohio. In Los Angeles, \"American Graffiti\" will shift from the movie screen to the pavement on May 13 as HOT ROD magazine launches an eight-day cruise from Peterson Automotive Museum to a big \"Power Festival\" in Norwalk, Ohio, on May 20-21. Hot rod fans and owners from across the country have been invited to cruise in the Power Tour or join the tour at any of the stops along the route as they wish. \"HOT ROD magazine is getting back to its roots,\" said Editor Drew Hardin. \"As we approach the year 2000, we want to see where hot rodding is headed. We want to touch, meet and greet the people behind the hobby because they are truly the life-line of HOT ROD.\" At least 12 legendary rods right off the magazine covers will cruise, including a flamed 1957 Chevy; the 1967 Chevy \"Crusher\" Camaro, a 1967 Ford Fairlane, and a 1972 Chevy Nova. Senior editor and hot rod legend Gray Baskerville will be driving his '32 Ford Roadster and will be joined by other magazine editors in the cross-country jaunt. Other editors and their wheels: Will Handzel and his 1931 Model A roadster; Jeff Smtih and his 1965 Chevelle; Cole Quinnell and his 1968 Nova; Rob Kinnan and his 1967 Ford Fairlane; John Dianna and his 1934 Chevy Sedan Delivery.\n\nA large number of hot rods, like these, are expected to gather at Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles on May 13 for the start of an eight-day caravan to the HOT ROD Magazine Power Festival in Norwalk, Ohio. The Power Tour culminates with a three-day \"Power Festival\" at Norwalk Raceway Park on' May 20-21 sponsored by Chevrolet and BF Goodrich. Street machines, trick trucks, Harley Davidsons and muscle cars will join the hot rodders. Spectators wishing to watch the hot rodders leave Peterson Automotive Museum must be at 6060 Wilshire Blvd. at Fairfax by 7 a.m. on May 13. Officials expect: hundreds of hot rodders to make the tour. Hundreds of Southland car club members are expected to join in the sendoff of participants. For information, call (800) 858-6381 or (213) 782-2341. HOT ROD is planning a second power festival in Commerce, Ga. near ' Atlanta on Aug. 25-27.\n\nHOT ROD magazine staff rides in 1932 Ford coupe, sedan delivery. The 1937 Ford Roadster \"Smoothster\" that won the top prize at the 1995 Grand National Roadster Show in Oakland and was built by Boyd Coddington in Orange County will also be in the caravan. Major pre-festival gatherings will be conducted at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Restaurant in Kansas City, Kan.; Rock n Roll Hardees in Springfield, III.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nWhen the staff met on the roof parking lot of the Petersen Museum early on May 13th for the start, eight adventurous readers showed up to join them for the entire 2,000-mile trip to Norwalk. Only 16 cars, half being Hot Rod project cars or cars driven by magazine staff, along with eight loyal readers. There were also a couple dozen other drivers that would accompany the group for the first leg of the journey. This was it the humble beginning.\n\n1995 Hot Rod Power Tour\n\nSaturday, May 13 - Los Angeles, CA to Las Vegas, NV for lunch, overnight in Cedar City UT.\n\nSunday, May 14 - to Green River, UT and stay in Glenwood Springs, CO\n\nMonday, May 15 - to Limone, CO and then Goodland, KS to Northwest Kansas Technical School for a tour.\n\nTuesday, May 16 - lunch in Salina, KS then staying in Kansas City, KS and party at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Restaurant.\n\nWednesday, May 17 - lunch in Wentzville, MO and then to Springfield, IL\n\nThursday, May 18 - toward Chicago then east to Marrillville, IN where Montgomery Ward & Auto Express threw a party.\n\nFriday, May 19 - take I-64 to Detroit, MI for another party\n\nMay 20-21 - Hot Rod Power Festival at Norwalk Raceway;
