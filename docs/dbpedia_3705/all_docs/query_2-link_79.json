Each material has unique properties and characteristics that are suitable for different applications.\n\nStainless Steel\n\nStainless steel is a popular fastener material because of its strength and aesthetic appeal. This corrosion-resistant alloy is made of iron, carbon, and other elements. It is commonly used in industries requiring higher corrosion resistance and stains, like medical equipment, chemical processing, and food processing. Stainless steel fasteners are also used in applications requiring durability and resistance to harsh environments like the marine industry.\n\nAtlanta Rod has several stainless steel materials in different grades and sizes. You can find 304/304L, 316/316L, and 410 grades. For example, the 304 stainless steel threaded rod is available in sizes ranging from ⅜ inch to 2 inches. You can find 316 stainless steel hex bolts ranging from ¼ to 1-inch in size.\n\nCarbon\n\nCarbon steel is another commonly used material for fasteners because of its strength and toughness. This metal is widely used in applications requiring high strength and rigidity, such as construction, transportation, oil, and gas. It’s a strong and durable metal composed of iron and carbon.\n\nAt Atlanta Rod, you’ll find carbon steel in several grades, such as A36, A527, and A193 B7. The company produces A36 threaded carbon steel rods ranging from ¼ inch to 1-1/2 inch. It also sells A193 B7 heavy hex bolts ranging from ¼ to 4 inches.\n\nTitanium\n\nThis lightweight and robust metal is resistant to corrosion and high temperatures. This is a lightweight but strong material, often used in high-performance applications. As a result, you commonly find it in industries like aerospace, medical equipment, and chemical processing. Titanium is highly resistant to corrosion and can withstand high temperatures, making it suitable for extreme environments. When you visit Atlanta Rod, you will find titanium in grades 2, 5, and 12. Examples of titanium products include grades 2 titanium threaded rods in sizes ranging from ¼ inch to 1-1/2 inches.\n\nBrass\n\nThis is a corrosion-resistant alloy made primarily of copper and zinc. You mostly find brass in the plumbing, electrical, and decorative hardware industries. This is because it’s the best material for applications requiring a decorative finish or non-sparkling properties.\n\nAtlanta Rod and Manufacturing sells brass in different grades, including C360 and C364 brass metals. You will find brass products like the C360 brass hex bolts ranging from ¼ inch to 1 inch and the C464 naval brass buts in sizes from ¼ inch to ¾ inch.\n\nOther Alloys\n\nIn addition to the materials, the company offers other alloys, including Bronze, Aluminum, Monel, Inconel, and Hastelloy. These are unique materials used in the aerospace and marine industries, as well as in chemical processing. Most of these other materials are available, depending on your specific needs.\n\nThe company has an expert team that works closely with customers to determine the best materials and finishes for the fasteners and ensure they meet the required specifications of the intended application. You will find most of these products in various sizes and grades. Atlanta Rod ensures that each material meets the customer’s specific needs.\n\nAIS, ASTM, and Other Manufacturing Standards\n\nAIS and ASTM are two manufacturing standards in America used in producing nuts, bolts, and other industrial fasteners.\n\nAIS standards stand for American Iron and Steel. The standards are specific to using domestically-produced iron and steel in projects as required by the Buy American Act and the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. They ensure that the iron and steel used in the project are made in the United States to support domestic fastener manufacturers and promote economic growth. Atlanta Rod and Manufacturing products are AIS-compliant, which means you will find bolts and nuts produced using domestic resources.\n\nASTM standards refer to the American Society for Testing and Materials. The standards are broadly used across the industry to establish guidelines for fasteners’ manufacturing, testing, and performance. They apply to products made from materials like steel, titanium, and brass. The standards also cover the entirety of production, from the chemical composition of materials to the physical properties of the finished product. The ASTM standards ensure that the fasteners produced in the US meet certain quality and safety requirements and can be used across different industries and applications.\n\nAtlanta Rod and Manufacturing produces different fasteners that meet these AIS and ASTM standards. The company adheres to these standards to ensure the quality and safety of its products and that they meet specific customer needs. For example, you can use Atlanta Rod fasteners, including bolts, nuts, and rods, in the construction, transportation, and oil and gas industries because of their quality.\n\nBABAA\n\nThe Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA) is a federal law that promotes using domestically sourced materials in public infrastructure projects. The act requires federally-funded transportation projects to use American-made iron, steel, and manufactured goods, with some exemptions. It applies to every project that receives federal funding, such as highways, bridges, and airports.\n\nThe United States Congress passed this 1983 act to boost the domestic manufacturing industry by promoting using American-made materials in public works projects. It also intends to create jobs and support American manufacturing by incentivizing using domestically-sourced materials in public infrastructure projects.\n\nTherefore, every project must use domestically-produced materials to comply with BABAA. The only exception to this is when the cost of using American-made products is significantly higher than using foreign-made materials. You can also use foreign materials when the material is unavailable domestically or when using domestic materials compromises the quality of your project.\n\nIndustries\n\nAtlanta Rod manufactures and supplies a wide range of quality fasteners, including bolts, nuts, and rods that can be used across several industries. Here’s an example of how each sector can use the fasteners from Atlanta Rod and Manufacturing in Alabama.\n\nMarine\n\nThe Marine industry includes several infrastructure design, construction, operation, and maintenance activities.
