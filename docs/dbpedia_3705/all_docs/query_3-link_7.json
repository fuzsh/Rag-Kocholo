        "text": "One of the most recognizable and influential names in the emo/indie rock scene, Hot Rod Circuit began crafting their musical empire back in 1997 and haven’t (permanently) stopped since. Despite a break-up, multiple hiatuses and side projects, and some rotating members, the band has always found a way to come back together to do what they love most. Six studio albums and almost two decades later, the guys took time out of their busy lives and got together to bless this year’s Taste of Chaos tour by playing just one show.\n\nMyspace sat down with Hot Rod Circuit’s vocalist/rhythm guitarist Andy Jackson and drummer Mike Poorman before they took the stage at Taste of Chaos to talk about change, perspective and their guilty pleasures.\n\nGiven that you played Taste of Chaos with a lot of bands you toured with a decade ago, how have you changed as both an individual and as a musician over the the past 10 years?\n\nAndy Jackson: We’re obviously much older. We’ve had a chance to go home and have families because we stopped being a band in...when was it?\n\nMike Poorman: We split up in 2007, got back together in 2011 and didn’t play again until last year. Now we’re playing a handful of shows here and there. Like Andy said, we’re all in or nearing 40 at this point. We all have wives at home and families. We’ve all individually grown into these really good places in our lives that have helped us as a band get back together and have fun.\n\nJackson: We’ve learned how to be a better band at the same time.\n\nPoorman: Better friends, better bandmates.\n\nAndy Jackson\n\nWith everything that you’ve experienced in your career, what advice would you go back and give yourself when you were just starting out?\n\nJackson: I probably wouldn’t have drank as much honestly. When you’re younger, you just kind of — not necessarily lose control, and not everybody does — I mean this guy [Poorman] had never had a drink. He didn’t start drinking until we broke up.\n\nPoorman: (jokingly) It ruined my whole life.\n\nJackson: I see it happen to a lot of younger bands now and with anybody in any situation. You just party a little too much and kind of wear yourself out. Now this guy’s getting up and doing yoga in the morning before we practice or play a show. It’s the difference in taking care of your body and stuff like that. I’m not saying don’t party and don’t have a good time because we all like to do that, but just not in excess.\n\nPoorman: I think too that we got caught up in more of the fun of it, and it was like “Yeah! Let’s go! Let’s do this!” But now — not that we didn’t take it seriously — all that stuff is behind us, and we know what we know about business and how the music industry works. Obviously, it’s changed a lot over the years. But I feel like if we had understood more of the business end of things as we were coming up, I would’ve taken that a lot more seriously right off the bat rather than years later.\n\nJackson: We were just young and wanted to play music. Now we’re older and have to think about business because we have families and things like that.\n\nPoorman: The one thing I wouldn’t change that I would still go back and say is “be passionate.” That was one thing that we had a lot of.\n\nJackson: No matter what, we always gave 110 percent.\n\nMike Poorman\n\nWhich artist(s) have you been most excited to watch grow and progress alongside you over the past decades?\n\nJackson: One for me is Quicksand. I’ve loved them since I was kid. I know them, but at the same time I’m a fanboy — they’re awesome and one of my favorites. They probably influenced half of the bands here [at Taste of Chaos]. I’m also stoked to see Anthony [Green] with Saosin.\n\nPoorman: [Taste of Chaos] in particular for us is pretty much — we said it last night, because all of the one-off bands are staying at the same hotel — it’s a like a high school reunion with people who you actually love. The Get Up Kids, The Anniversary, Quicksand — they’re all bands that we’ve always admired and toured with and love the people in them. It’s fun because now we go to the bar and hang out and talk and it’s like “Oh, how are your kids? What’s going on with family life?” “Oh, I’ve got two kids now!” It’s totally different than 15 years ago.\n\nWhat’s your favorite guilty pleasure?\n\nJackson: Food, but probably coffee. I’m from the South, so I really like soul food. I like cold brew coffee, but typically straight up with cream and sugar."
