        "text": "Once upon a time, there were several instrument playing fellows in an area of the world known to man as the Greater Valley Area, or GVA for short. Whenever possible, talent should always be combined, which is exactly what started occurring early in the Fall of 1994. We'll start with individual #1, Chris Cummings, future bassist/vocalist for the Morning Silence. He got his start in Auburn, AL, playing guitar in the band Skipper with Casey Prestwood (who later founded Stealing Mikey and is presently a guitarist/vocalist for the band Hot Rod Circuit on Vagrant Records). Richard Garcia, a former Skipper bassist and the brother of ex-Holly Go Core drummer Ryan Garcia, was also a member of Skipper but has since given up his bass guitar for baseball, I think. Skipper was a two-songed band that never played; that is, until they neglected to invite Chris to a recording session during which they put down four songs for a demo they were recording. Skipper later became Stealing Mikey, which later sort of dissolved into Antidote, who soon after recording their debut CD, Mr. Glenbowski, changed their name to Hot Rod Circuit.\n\nThe next band to shed some light on the nonexistent music scene of the GVA was P-BRANE, a duet featuring the sounds of Michael Grossman on bass and Wyatt Oates on guitar. These two individuals will arise a little later in the story, so you'll just have to read a little further to find out what these guys added to the soup that is Inner Peace Security.\n\nRichard's brother Ryan received a Pearl drumset for his birthday in 1995 so he, along with Patrick Steele (who later played bass for the LaGrange hardcore/metal band Ritual) and Nick Williams (the present instrumentalist for stoptherevolution) formed the band Atomic Waste, a band that later changed its name to such household terms as B.F.C., Santa, the Professor and Maryanne, and eventually Subliminal Maryanne. They recorded an 11 song tape called Think! in Nick's 8-track basement studio (a basement studio which would later become the famed Evansville Recstuds, which would later become 19th Avenue Digital), and sold copies of it at school, for prices ranging from free to $4.00. Talks of gigs ensued, but were quickly quieted due to their inherent laziness and inability to talk to anyone about anything. The next Subliminal Maryanne release was a live tape recorded in Patrick's garage, and was aptly titled Live at the Acropolis! This recording consisted of tracks from the first tape, along with a taste of what was to come. Nick wrote several classics during this time period, such as Newsville Evans hits \"Hoppin' and Boppin'\", \"Cult of the Dead Cow\", and \"Jackie Chan Girl\", just to name a few. These songs, along with 8 more new ones, were then recorded in the basement and quietly released as To Marietta, and Beyond!, a title which would eventually become the name of a Newsville Evans song featured on The Empire Releases, Part One. Just when Subliminal Maryanne started to get pretty good (they were said to have been 'kick-ass' near the end of their days), fate separated them, and killed them forever (at least until the brief Subliminal Maryanne reunion before a Newsville Evans / Ritual show at Club D.J. in LaGrange, during which they played \"Hoppin' and Boppin'\" and \"Belle of Amherst\").\n\nDuring and shortly after the reign of Subliminal Maryanne, numerous splinter bands began to form, which was in fact the reason Subliminal Maryanne broke up. The Poser Puppies (a.k.a. The Coolies), a punk/funk/ska/pop-rock-core trio featuring Chris Cummings on bass/guitar/vox, Wyatt Oates (I told ya he would pop back up in the thick of things) on bass/guitar/vox, and Nick Williams on the drums was the first splinter band. The first Poser Puppies release, which was also recorded in the world famous Evansville Recording Studios (known at the time as Phatmunky Recording Studios), contained 8 songs and was entitled P-Funk's Not Dead. Copies of this tape weren't going to be sold by the band, but several pirated copies were sold at Marion Military Academy to buy food. A few of the songs recorded were thought to have major label potential (which they didn't), and were heard by A&R reps at Reprise and EMI Records. The band never heard from the labels (as expected). The next Poser Puppies effort was called Cows in Winter (a name which was cheaply stolen from chinaware artwork in and old issue of Reader's Digest), and was the first real Phatmunky release taken fairly seriously. The band had covers printed up for this 16-song gem, and sold copies at school for $4.00. Copies of this tape were sent to several record companies, and the radio station WEGL 91.1 in Auburn, AL, which actually gave the songs 'Every Morning' and 'Jewelry' a fair amount of airplay during certain times. Despite their limited success, the Poser Puppies neglected to show their talents in front of a live audience, due once again to laziness.\n\nRight near the end of the Poser Puppies' reign, a new combination of musicians came together to form the band that would on day be Newsville Evans. The lineup was Nick Williams on guitar, Malcolm Davenport on guitar & vocals, Chris Cummings on bass & vocals, and Ryan Garcia on the drums. They were called 'Dr. Bob and the O.J. Verdict' (Dr. Bob is the current headmaster of Springwood School, and the O.J. trial was the hip news story of the moment), and were strictly a cover band. The guys didn't write any songs for this band because all of their original stuff at the time went toward the Poser Puppies and/or Subliminal Maryanne, so their true talents were hidden by sloppy Screeching Weasel and pathetic NoFX covers. They did however record two albums, the first being called Four Without Ryan due to his absence from the recording, and the fact that only four songs were recorded. The second release was entitled More Without Ryan due to his continuing absence from Dr. Bob recordings, and the fact that it just contained \"more\" bad covers. It should be noted that a few of the songs from the Without Ryan series were re-released by IPS in 2004 as the Without Ryan EP. It wasn't until the breakups of the Poser Puppies and Subliminal Maryanne that Dr. Bob decided to play original material, but we'll get to that later.\n\nOne weekend when Malcolm was absent from a Dr. Bob jam session, the three remaining lurkers decided to turn on the 8-track and try to capture some original improvisational material, which they seemed to be (and still are) good at creating. This recording would become known as The ZerOrinG Recordings, and featured Chris on the acoustic guitar and vocals, Nick on the 1963 Fender Jaguar (which he now no longer owns because he decided Newsville Evans needed a new bass rather than an old scratchy classic - the sale of which he's starting to regret because he could have gotten $2,000 bucks for it instead of settling for an even trade for a bass with a $650 sticker price at a used gear shop in suburban Atlanta. In fact, Casey Prestwood of Hot Rod Circuit offered Nick $1200 for it in late 1996, but he refused.) and vocals, and Ryan Garcia on the Roto-tom stressed drum setup. They recorded 11 songs, a few of which just happened to be horrible (but fun) covers (how can \"Twist and Shout\" not be fun?). The master copy of the ZerOrinG was recently rescued from a Coca-Cola induced tapedeck eating near-death experience. A couple of tracks from this recording are presented on the IPS Classic website for your enjoyment. Another similar recording called \"Raisin Man\" took place around this time and was performed by a combination of fellows called 'es114'. The song was written by Chris and recorded with himself on guitar, Wyatt Oates on guitar, and Grady Oates on guitar. This recording has since been lost.\n\nAs it turns out, everything that had happened since they all began playing instruments was simply preparation for the next musical formation to take place in the GVA. This band was called Channel Four, and featured Michael Grossman on bass/vocals, Nick Williams on guitar, Chris Cummings on guitar, and Ryan Garcia on drums. Channel Four recorded their first album, This One's For Leia, in June '97 at Phatmunky (basement) and put copies up for sale in Silver Rocket Records (out of business) in Auburn and got some airplay on WEGL 91.1. You can also request Channel Four from them as you surely have already done the Poser Puppies. After weeks of practice and the construction of a sturdy and flexible set of songs, Channel Four had time to play one show in Auburn before Michael had to return to Marion Military Academy. The plan was to play shows on weekends when Michael came to visit, but that fell through, due once again to our chronic laziness. Since Channel Four was pretty much going to be defunct until the summer of '98, there became plenty of time for Dr. Bob and the O.J. Verdict to develop as an original band.\n\nAt the end of summer '97, during a trip to Destin, FL, by Nick and Chris, the phrase \"new 311 CD,\" spoken by Chris, played an important role in the future of Dr. Bob. The phrase was heard as \"Newsville Evans\" by Nick, and soon became a worthy replacement of the name Dr. Bob and the O.J. Verdict. This new name, along with the freedom of performing original compositions, gave the band the power to conquer (become) the music scene of the GVA. The lineup included Nick on guitar/vocals, Chris on bass/vocals, Malcolm on guitar/vocals, and Ryan on the drums. Newsville Evans spent 3 months recording and producing their debut independently released CD The Empire Releases, Part One: Return to the Tranquility of Yesterday at the newly renovated Evansville Recstuds (8-track bedroom). Soon after, the band took 17 new songs to a studio in Memphis, TN, where they were recorded, but never mastered. While the band was waiting for a convenient time to return to Memphis to finish the record, the Memphis studio was relocated to Auburn, AL, which is way way closer to home for us. One weekend sometime before Christmas or 1998, three members of Newsville Evans went to the studio in Auburn and touched up what would become a classic post-punk album. It was called A Nice Place to Live and represents the only Inner Peace recording not recorded here at the house, which makes it special in a way i guess. Well, not really, I'm still pissed at that studio because I left my guitar there after we were done mixing the CD and they seem to have misplaced the damn thing. Maybe I'll get it back some day. It was my very first guitar. Oh well, fuck it.\n\nA few months later, Channel Four decided to record 14 tracks for its new CD, Letterbox Flashback, at Evansville. The band pretty much rushed through it because it was thought that the bassist and lead vocalist, Michael, would be returning to Marion, AL to be a slave of military school. As it turned out, Michael ended up staying in town, and is still here as I type this. This was one of the best Inner Peace Security releases, aside from a couple to be named later on in this biography. If you don't own a copy of this CD, you best be steppin'.\n\nOh, so you wanna know about Chanel Feux, eh? Well, the five or six songs that make up the Chanel Feux record were committed to tape one night live at Evansville, when Chris, Malcolm, and Nick were really bored. Chris had these folk songs from Athens that he wanted to play, including the chart topping hit, 'Super Jesus'. The improv sound fx in this recording also add a little character, and make the songs doubly entertaining to hear... Over and over again.. I love Chanel Feux.\n\nAfter Channel Four had finished with their masterpiece Letterbox Flashback, and Newsville Evans had mixed A Nice Place to Live, it was time to think about what to do next. Nick and Chris had been busy writing songs during this period for Newsville Evans, and it was planned that Newsville would record a new batch of 30 songs and pick the best ones and put them on a new CD. Although Newsville got together and played a couple of shows of new material, nothing was ever recorded (with the exception of a live recording of the band playing with Jennifer at the now defunct Auburn internet cafe Java.com). With that, talks began arising on the topic of a new Channel Four record. Based on how good the last one was, and the fact that we had absolutely no new Channel Four material, Nick insited that any new CD Channel Four put out couldn't possibly be as good as Letterbox Flashback. Boy was he wrong. Over the course of three months after Christmas '98, Nick, Michael, and Chris recorded 14 new songs for the wonderful new Channel Four release, No Can Do.\n\nAround this time, most of the guys involved in Inner Peace Security began to listen to different types of music, one of which happened to be emo rock in drop-D tuning. Several songs were written and recorded for this new project, which became known as Calela. The lineup included Nick Williams, on vox and guitar; Chris Cummings on vox and guitar; Mike Grossman on bass; and Ryan Garcia on the drums. As a performing group, we seemed to be tighter than we'd ever been. It seemed like this was going to be THE band for us, but we ended up calling it quits soon after we recorded the 8-song EP entitled Village.\n\nShortly after the break-up of Calela, members of the band started going off to school. Ryan Garcia took his academic talents to Georgia State, a college in downtown Atlanta, and the rest of us pretty much stayed around to attend the local community college. Nick had in fact enrolled for classes at Auburn University, but had to withdraw before the start of the quarter due to the loss of his driver's license. All of this added up to zilch in the music department.\n\nWithout his driver's license, Nick found some time at home to record several songs for a future CD release for his dexterclaire project. Six or so songs were recorded at the beginning of the Fall 1999 quarter. The rest were recorded over the next couple of years. While Nick was at home writing and recording, his friends Philip and Thomas Smallwood were also busy at their home recording demos with their new digital 8-track recorder. Nick decided to bring the fellaz into Inner Peace Security, and over the next year they all worked on an 8-song Room404 release entitled A Tribute to a Place in the Past.\n\nSince the Smallwoods were already knee-deep in IPSdom, we all thought it was time for a new performing band to be formed. Hence, Holly Go Core was born. Holly Go Core was supposed to take the place of the emocore outfit Calela, and did in fact use some of Calela's material. Since the songs were already written and recorded, they just fit right in with the project. Chris also wrote several more great songs, all of which ended up on Holly's hi-fi CD Bend Sinister, recorded at the house. Holly Go Core consisted of Thomas Smallwood on lead vocals, Chris Cummings on guitar, Philip Smallwood on bass, and Nick Williams on drums. Holly played several shows in Auburn/Opelika, as well as the Valley, or Lanett to be specific.\n\nFor some messed up reasons, Holly Go Core also called it quits, but not before recording a new 6-song EP entitled Goodbye Forever. Also, just before their much publicized break-up, Nick had hit the record button during their final show, in hopes of releasing a live CD. This recording is decent, but none of the members were happy with the performance. Because of this, the live Holly Go Core CD in all it's glory, just sits on my hard drive waiting to be released to the general public.\n\nOkay, Philip Smallwood went to California, and Thomas moved to Auburn. After a few months of no music, Chris and Nick decided to start up something new with drummer Andy Jones and bassist Mike Grossman. This band was called the Morning Silence, and played one really great show before disbanding. The band didn't really break-up, but Chris left one morning to drive to Montana to be with some girl, so we didn't get to play anymore. We actually had two more shows scheduled, but we couldn't really play them without Chris. Nothing was ever recorded to tape with this band (except for that one show), until Nick and Chris got back together one evening to make a CD. The boys met and recorded what is still my favorite IPS release to date. Their self-titled 6-song EP was released years later as a bargain bin CD.\n\nImagine Ellie... Just imagine. Well, we did imagine, but it still didn't amount to very much. While Nick was playing with the Morning Silence, he got an offer from Brian Phillips of Jesse and the Rockers fame to play in a new emo-core outfit, Imagine Ellie. You see, Brian had been playing in a semi-local group called New Pop Solution, but they had broken up in a fashion similar to that of Holly Go Core. The guys started playing with Brian on guitar and vocals, Matt Potenza (formerly of Chrome Donuts) on bass, and Nick on Drums. After three or so practice sessions, the boys played a show in Phenix City, AL, and decided to record a 4-song EP after a request from someone at Vindicated Records. Shortly after making this recording, Brian and his wife Sharon moved to Birmingham, AL, and Imagine Ellie ceased to be, as did Brian and Sharon. Holly Go Core reunited soon after this with a new drummer, Ryan Garcia of course, and had talked of a new CD and a new tour, but it never happened. Brian started an amazing new band in Birmingham called 'Last Flight In' who is still playing and recording to the best of my knowledge.\n\nIt was around this time that Inner Peace Security became Inner Peace Security Records. The newly formed company would produce and release CDs, and provide money for merchandise and advertising for its bands. IPS signed a few bands during this period, the first of which was Cursive Letters. This band involved Thomas Smallwood and friend Josh Hillyer, both on acoustic guitars. As an acoustic-power-duo, they got together and recorded a CD here at 19th Avenue Digital and started playing shows at the 320 Coffee House in Auburn, AL. The CD was met with mixed reviews, but still rocks hardcore since it was the first official IPS Records release.\n\nNick also started playing in a new band called The Arcade Version in 2002. The lineup included Nick on guitar, David Rutledge (formerly of Jeremiah's Grotto and Chrome Donuts) on guitar and vocals, Matt Potenza on bass, and Aaron Potenza on drums. The Arcade Version played a batch of local shows and started recording an EP in 2003. Unfortunately, only two of the songs were finished and the band broke up over the summer. However, the band did manage to get their song \"Now or Never\" included on a compilation released by Asian Man Records. The other song, \"Until I See Your Face\", was released on a short-run compilation at Dan's Warped Tour in 2003. There have been rumors floating around that The Arcade Version could reunite to record a new EP and play some shows in the area. We'll see what happens!\n\nPhilip Smallwood, former member of Holly Go Core who moved to California for 2 years, came back in December of 2002. It wasn't 2 weeks before they all started talking about forming a new band. Nick, Thomas, and Joanna Sigman had toyed with the idea of really starting Holly Go Core again, but now that Phil was back it seemed like the wrong thing to do. Instead, they started a whole new band called The Anna Bocci Band. The lineup included Thomas Smallwood on bass and lead vocals, Philip Smallwood on bass and vocals, Joanna Sigman on keyboard and vocals, and Nick Williams on drums and vocals. The Anna Bocci Band recorded a full-length in 2003 entitled Secrets, Surprise, and Design and played around 15 shows to support it. At the end of the summer of that year, Philip and Thomas both moved away leaving The Anna Bocci Band in a pickle. The solution was obvious: Get Josh Hillyer (formerly of Cursive Letters) to play guitar and tap Mark Hendrix (formerly of local punk/ska band Blindfish) to play the bass! This lineup proved itself and the band recorded an 8-song EP entitled Me and My Friends. For the first time, IPS artists were getting contacted by labels. Big labels. Victory, Vagrant, and Drive-Thru all seemed to want a piece, but Nick decided to break up the band instead. I think his exact words were, \"Fuck Drive-Thru!\"\n\nBut Nick had a plan. His plan was to stop the friggin' revolution. He and Josh did in fact start up a new band soon after the demise of TABB, and called the project stoptherevolution. The guys started writing and recording songs at the end of 2004, but really had no plans to play live shows. But soon, they realized that they would indeed be interested in finding musicians to complete the live version of the band. Jon (formerly of local hxc band Ascension and Escape) was tapped for bass duties, and Mark Hendrix once again saved the day and agreed to play guitar. Jeremy Harbin (formerly of Ampersand) also stepped in to help the guys by providing his amazing drum skills.\n\nThere was a band called The Drive that played a number of local shows before inking a deal with Inner Peace Security in 2003. They had previously recorded at the studio here, and were already really good friends of ours. The band changed their name to Ampersand and grew into one of the greatest bands the area has ever seen. They recorded a full-length CD entitled See As Newts in 2004, and recorded a PureVolume exclusive single in the fall entitled 29 Dimensions of Compatibility. The band no longer plays, but plans are already coming together for a reunion show in the summer of 2005.\n\nThe only other band signed to make music for IPS Records this year was Continue and Save. Nick and Josh saw these guys perform at Dan's Summer Warped Sideshow Tour II in 2004, and immediately approached them about making a record. The boys quickly recorded a 7-song EP which was loved by everyone. Continue and Save broke up sometime later and reformed as Spy For Hire with our very own Jeremy Harbin on drums.\n\nDuring some of the downtime between The Anna Bocci Band and stoptherevolution, several awesome side-projects were started. Pythagorean Theorem came together late in 2004 with Jeremy Harbin on drums and Nick Williams on guitar. Several pseudo-math-rock songs were written over the course of a month or so, and a 6-song EP is planned for release by IPS. The guys also started a rap ensemble called Tha Inna Peaz Players. This tight joint is fronted by the two true gangstaz, DJ Quizzle and TooSlowJeremo. Many other people have contributed to this project in recent months, including but not limited to: lil' DeeKay, ol' Backwoods, DJ Sarge, Union Jack Frost, P. Smallz, quest.young.mark, MC Ving Travolta, Do-Rite, SMF, G-$, and Soup-a-Fly. Both of these projects are represented by kickass PureVolume pages, and will eventually play shows in the tri-state area. The Inna Peaz Players have already made one successful public appearance at the Corporate Office in Lanett, AL.\n\nTo be Continued.\n\nMood:bio'd!\n\nMusic:dexterclaire - auxiliary"
