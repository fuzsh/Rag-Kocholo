        "text": "Oh man, this is the most proud I have ever been of something I have created. We did it exatly the way we wanted to. We were able to take our time and it wasn’t really about the budget. It was about getting it right. The drums are all really live and it’s not your typical drum replacing with samples that you get on a lot of records these days. It sounds like Josh playing in a room and it hits really hard. There are just lots of layers of guitars. It’s a normal rock record with two guitars, bass, drums and vocals. We have a song on there called “Conspiracy” that has a 124 tracks that we used. So, we went all out in different ways each time. We are super into it and super excited.\n\nYou guys are currently on tour with Anberlin and Story Of The Year. Even though last night was the first night of the tour, how is it going so far?\n\nIt has been awesome. I mean, Anberlin is right where we want to be. We are just starting out and getting the word out. But they are a band that has been around for years and is finally getting the success they deserve. It’s nice to pick their brains about we should do next and also try to win over their fans. There have been a lot of kids at the shows so far.\n\nAnd you guys are playing Warped Tour, correct? Are you looking forward to that?\n\nRight. We have a show with 30 Seconds To Mars then we are going out with The Offspring for a week. It’s sort of a different type of door compared to all of our backgrounds. We are just trying it all. At some points on the record, we allowed ourselves to get out of our comfort zone and try something new and that is also kind of what this Offspring tour is. It should be really good. It is a way for us to play out west.\n\nWhat are some of your goals for Terrible Things?\n\nWell, you know, a lot of people may think this is just a project or a “side” thing but it is very much our focus and what we would like to be doing for the next 10 years. So everything we do we keep in mind that we want this and we are making it our first priority over everything else and put in 110%. Of course, we have to have enough success to be able to continue and honestly, that is why we spent so much time on the record and we really think that other people will get excited when they hear it. Our goals are pretty much musical. Just play the best music we ever have. There is sort of a lack of popular bands that try and play their instruments well and we are just trying to do that. It is an uphill battle but we feel like we made something that people can get behind that also has some really cool playing. Josh does some insane grooves on the record. It gets a little technical toward the end. There is a song that is a bit Coheed-ish. For the most part, it is straight-ahead rock and there are guitar solos on half the songs. That is something you don’t really hear anymore. I feel confident saying that there is no one out there doing exactly what we are doing right now.\n\nWhere did the name “Terrible Things” come from?\n\nIt came from a song that I have. The lyrics in that song says “We are doing terrible things.” It is kind of fitting for what our record is about. The concept of the record is like “How did we get to this place?” Our world as we know it, my town, was out of control. One of the songs on there is called “Revolution” and the chorus is “This is not a revolution” and it’s just like “Where are we going?” and “How can we make things better?” It deals with a lot of the darker elements of the world. I always tend to have a positive take on things but Terrible Things went around all things I have experienced.\n\nAny last words for our readers?\n\nI encourage everyone to check out the record. Most of all, come to our live shows. This band is very old school in that we are going to try and put on the very best possible live shows. We will be meeting people afterwards. So come out not only to see the shows but to hang out also. It should be a really exciting year and I hope as many of you can come out as possible."
