        "text": "NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nEdited Oral History Transcript\n\nThomas K. Mattingly II\n\nInterviewed by Rebecca Wright\n\nCosta Mesa, California – 6 November 2001\n\nWright: Today is November 6, 2001. This interview is with T. K. Mattingly, and it’s being conducted for the NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project. The interview is being conducted in Costa Mesa, California, by Rebecca Wright.\n\nThank you between for taking time to participate in this project. We’d like for you to start today by telling us how you became interested in aeronautics and then later space flight.\n\nMattingly: [Chuckles] I think it’s in the genes. As a kid, my earliest memories that I can recall all had to do with airplanes. My dad worked for Eastern Airlines. Before I had any idea what that was, my toys were all some kind of airplane, and any picture that you could glean from when I was a child, they always had an airplane in it. I don’t think there was ever anything conscious about the fascination with flight, that was just all-consuming.\n\nAs I got to be an older child, I built every model airplane that I could find, ate every box of cereal that had a cut-out paper airplane on the back, all that sort of stuff. It was just a way of life. Since Dad worked for Eastern after he transferred to Miami [Florida], and I got a little older so I could be left alone, why, if I could stay out of trouble for a while, my reward was Dad had passes on Eastern, and I would get on the airplane, and I would just fly to the end of the route and back. Never got off the airplane, just go to one place to the other.\n\nIn those days, the [Douglas] DC-3 was the only transport airplane, and so if you went up the East Coast from Miami up north and back, that was a long day. That was my big thrill, to sit there and just look out the window. Airplanes didn’t fly so high in those days, so you could see a lot.\n\nI remember on weekends, if we had time, why, we’d go drive over to the airport and just stand there and watch airplanes. It’s like I’ve been told a generation ahead of us went out and watched trains. Well, I watched airplanes.\n\nSo when it came time to pick a career, I don’t think there was ever any choice. It was just, well, I want to be in aviation. I wanted to fly. I didn’t have any idea what that was or how you did it, but that was something I wanted to do. So from that point on, it was just don’t get in the way of getting into aviation.\n\nMy first ride in an airplane other than a commercial airliner was when I went to Auburn [University, Auburn, Alabama]. I went on a Navy ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] scholarship. One of the neighbors was a Marine colonel who was stationed out at Opa-Locka Marine Corps Station there in Miami. They had a group of [Douglas] ADs, which is a propeller-driven attack airplane. They had one version that normally they were single-seat airplanes. They were used in Korea. They had a version that had a widened fuselage so that you could have people sit side-by-side, and they used it for all kinds of utility things.\n\nSo after he got me into this program, first Christmas we were up there, why, he said, well, he’d come up and bring me back to Miami and he would fly his AD up to a field near the school and pick me up. So it was my first time to get into what I call a real airplane. I still remember that, but the idea that I would end up being able to get into aviation, I wanted to be a pilot. I wanted to be a test pilot, whatever that was. It just seemed like that was what you wanted to do, but I had no idea.\n\nSo after that, it was just anything that became related to that. It essentially was don’t get in the way of getting there. A friend of mine in business kept telling me, “When you’re not sure what to do, just don’t get in the way of success, because you’re not sure what’s going to happen.”\n\nSo that was the road we went down and took aeronautical engineering in college. Started in engineering physics and that was taking too much time, so I went back to aeronautical engineering and did that because, of course, that’s what I wanted to do.\n\nWhen I graduated from college and got my commission, I volunteered for flight training and wasn’t selected. I was crushed. Other people in my class that had grades that weren’t as good, were not engineers—and I could never figure it out. I ended up being sent to a precommissioning detail on a ship called the USS Galveston. It was in dry dock in Philadelphia.\n\nSo here I was, a brand new ensign, wanted to be in flight training, and instead I was up in this shipyard, a ship that didn’t even go to sea. You walked across a gangplank, but there was no water underneath you. It was just concrete. The ship was not in commission yet. We were still finishing putting it together, checking it out.\n\nI was pretty miserable. [Laughs] A young kid paying off his college debts, didn’t have anyplace to go. So there was another guy in the same boat, two ensigns. He came from West Virginia, and I think we may have been the only two that lived on the ship. Everybody else lived ashore, but we couldn’t afford that. So we got to be good friends there and found out how far you can stretch a dollar.\n\nSo one day the guy that I worked for pulled me aside and said, “You know, I understand you don’t do anything but read airplane books. Why don’t you go to flight training?”\n\nI told him I tried and been rejected—or hadn’t been selected.\n\nHe said, “Why is that?”\n\nI said, “I have no idea.”\n\n“Would you still like to go?”\n\n“Of course, but I asked my commanding officer at the NROTC unit, and he told me I had to finish my first set of orders before I could apply again.”\n\nSo that didn’t sound right. So this guy called the Navy Bureau of Personnel in Washington, and they said, “Well, yeah, we wondered. He had good grades. He had everything, but he never sent in an application.”\n\nThe guy says, “I don’t think that’s what was intended.” He said, “Is there any way he could—?” He said, “Of course. Tell him to drive down, and I’ll give him a set of orders.”\n\nSo my boss said, “Okay, if you want to go, all you’ve got to do is get in your car. I’ll give you tomorrow off. You can drive down, and they’ll send you to flight training.” I said, “Okay. What do I do next?”\n\nHe said, “Everything we do in the military has to be approved on a piece of paper called a chit. So you have to take your little chit around and get everybody to sign it.” The last person on the list that I had to go see was the head of our department, was the gunnery officer. He’s a lieutenant commander. To me, that was probably some inch or so short of God, but to tell you, it doesn’t look like such a high rank, but in those days it really was impressive to me and I was terrified of having to go in and see this fellow, and sat down and we talked. He said, “Well, I hear you’ve really been doing a lot of interesting things.” And it was the first guided missile cruiser that we had put into operation, was to fire a Talos missile. I was in the gunnery department and learning to make this system put together. It was really, for the time, a very sophisticated weapon. It carried both nuclear and conventional things, and it was kind of awesome to be around.\n\nHe said, “I hear you’ve really done some good stuff.” And he says, “Do you know how it works?”\n\nI told him. He said, “Yeah, you understand it.” He says, “You realize this is going to revolutionize naval warfare. Airplanes are history.”\n\nI said, “Yes, sir.”\n\nHe says, “Now, this piece of paper says you want to go to flight training.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Well, you understand what we just said. We’ve revolutionized naval warfare. Aviation is history. Nobody will ever survive. Do you really want to go to flight training?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nHe said, “You are the dumbest ensign I have ever met,” signs it, and says, “Out.”\n\nI left. I really didn’t think anything about that for twenty-two years. The guy’s name was Glenwood Clark. I did go to flight training, of course.\n\nWhen I left JSC [Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas] and went back to the Navy, I reported to a command called Naval Space and Warfare Systems Command. They were trying to reshape it into a new entity. After I’d been there about a month and was still totally lost, they passed out a little flyer that says “The Secretary of the Navy has designated our new commander. He’ll be here in two weeks,” or something. “His name is Vice Admiral Glenwood Clark,” and it gave his bio.\n\nWell, I’d been out of the real Navy for twenty years at this point, so I sneaked over in a corner to read this thing. I figured I won’t know a thing about what’s on here, but I ought to read it. So I got through it, and he’s done all this and this and that and had a very distinguished career. When I got right down to the end at the bottom, towards the end of his bio it just said gunnery officer, USS Galveston, 1958 to ‘60.\n\nI said, “Couldn’t be.” So I went back, dug out my papers to see who had signed, and sure enough, it’s the same guy. I thought, “Oh, this is not a good start, but he won’t remember me.”\n\nSo when he came aboard, we went around and we had briefings, and I briefed him on all of my programs. After it was over, we went into his office and relaxed for a minute. On the way out, we were just kind of chatting. On the way out, I just couldn’t resist. I said, “Admiral, do you remember me?”\n\nHe looked me right in the eye and says, “I sure do. You were the dumbest ensign I’ve ever known.” And he had to remember it. There’s no other way. I had not told that story to anybody.\n\nI said, “This is really going to be a rough tour.” [Laughs] Turns out he’s been one of my closest personal friends ever since both of us retired. But that’s just part of “How did you get into aviation?”\n\nThe space stuff came along after I got into flying. I still didn’t know how to get there, but I wanted to get into flight test. I became interested in the engineering part of it and just didn’t have any idea where I was going or what was going to happen. Turned out the squadron I was assigned to was flying that same AD that Marine colonel gave me my first ride in. It was old when he was flying it, and it was a lot older when I got to fly it. It was carrier-based, but it wasn’t the most exotic thing in the navy. They had a special place at the bar for you so you wouldn’t contaminate all the jet people.\n\nI didn’t think there was really a great deal of future in this career, but I did thoroughly love flying. I was stationed at Naval Air Station Jacksonville [Florida], and that’s when we were ashore and we deployed on a carrier. One day a friend of mine that I knew from the BOQ [Bachelor Officer’s Quarters] said, “They’re going to launch one of these Gemini rockets.” And he was in a photo reconnaissance squadron and his job was to fly down and take pictures of the launch. He said, “Can you get a bird and we’ll all go down and watch it?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nI had not been impressed with the space program at that point. I thought the pictures in the magazines of Mercury and Gemini weren’t visually appealing. Airplanes are supposed to be smooth, and there’s an elegance to them, and these things, I can’t imagine how anybody could be interested in that. It just had no appeal.\n\nSo I got on an airplane. In those days you could do a lot things you can’t do today. So I got this airplane, and my friend had given me all the radio frequencies. So I went down and orbited over the Banana River and listened in to the activities on the air-to-ground. It lifted off. This, by the way, was John’s [W. Young] first flight. It was, I guess, the first manned Gemini.\n\nSo they blasted off, and I watched this thing go. I heard the voice communications and when I saw some [McDonnell-Douglas] F-4s that were trying to fly chase to take pictures of it or something, and I saw airplanes that were as good as we had in service fly up and this rocket walked away from them and just kept going.\n\nI came back at dinner that night, Jack said, “Well, what did you think?”\n\nI said, “You know, I think that sounds like the most exciting thing anybody could ever do.” And the newspapers were filled with pictures of all these heroes and stuff.\n\nHe said, “Yeah, man. How do you get into something like that?”\n\nI said, “Nah, we’ll never get there. But if someone ever said you could, you ought to say yes.”\n\nWright: What was the next step? How did you apply for the astronaut program?\n\nMattingly: After a change in tours in the Navy, I went from my AD because I was convinced that I was never even going to get into the test pilot school with nothing but propeller experience, not in the modern Navy. I had to get out of there while I was young, because the way our rotations worked, the chances of getting assigned to a jet squadron later were much lower.\n\nSo I ended up doing all kinds of crazy things and writing letters to “Whoever gets this.” I finally was able to wrangle a seat in an [Douglas] A-3 squadron, which was a twin-engine jet, went from the slowest, oldest airplane in the Navy to not the newest, but the biggest carrier airplane we had. That was quite a transition.\n\nWe made a couple of cruises there. Because I had changed types of aircraft, I had extended. So I had been on sea duty for five years at the time, and they were about to transition to a new airplane called the A-3J, which was really the most modern thing in the Navy. So I thought, “I’ll just stay around and go from the bottom of the pile to the top of the pile.”\n\nThey said, “You have got to get off sea duty and go back to shore duty. You have to go somewhere. You can’t keep extending or you’ll get out of cycle with your contemporaries, and it won’t be good for you.” So they said, “What do you want to do?”\n\nI said, “Well, I want to go to Pax [Patuxent] River [Maryland] and the test pilot school.” And so because of this out-of-rotation thing, we returned from our last cruise with the A-3. I think it was like in April, if I’m remember right, and the test pilot school started in March, just a month earlier.\n\nSo they said, “You can’t make that date, but we’ll send you to postgraduate school first. When you finish there, then you can go to the test pilot school.”\n\nI said, “What postgraduate school?”\n\nThey said, “Well, we think you ought to get a master’s in aeronautical engineering.”\n\nI said, “I don’t think so. I don’t think that’s what I want to do.” I said, “I would like to go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts],” and they laughed at that.\n\nSo we couldn’t figure out what I was going to do. I said, “Well, I’ve been on sea duty for five years. Right now I’m standing duty officer in a hangar. The squadron is back. We’re just sitting here watching our airplanes get towed away while they bring in the new ones. I’m not going to any of the schools. I’m doing nothing. Why don’t I detach early?”\n\n“Can’t do that.”\n\nSo I resigned from the Navy. Before I actually got out, a fellow called and said, “How would you like to go to the Air Force test pilot school? We can’t get you into Pax River, but we can get you in the Air Force school. They start a little later. They start in May, and you could still make that one.”\n\nSo I said, “All right. I’ll do that.”\n\nIt wasn’t so bad, because I remember reading in Aviation Week, I’d seen a little article the Air Force school at Edwards [Air Force Base, California] was designated as the source for the MOL program. That’s where their Manned Orbiting Laboratory was, the Air Force program to put a reconnaissance module in what they called a “Blue Gemini” on a Titan, and it was going to be this big program. It was going to be the military man in space program. According to this article I’d read, the source of those people would be the school at Edwards. So I thought maybe that’s not all bad.\n\nSo I drove out to the desert in California and spent a year at Edwards, really just an absolutely fun year. There was nothing else to do out there in the desert except fly, so it was really, really a lot of fun. At the end of it, or I guess in the middle of our session, both NASA and the MOL program announced that they were selecting another group of astronauts.\n\nThe selections were kind of in parallel. So the people in our class, Ed [Edgar D.] Mitchell was in the class with me. Bo [Karol J.] Bobko was in the class. I don’t think there was anyone else in our class that came down there.\n\nThe Air Force guys all went and put their requests in, and you could check do you want to go to NASA, do you want to go to the Air Force program. The Air Force guys could check [both boxes]. The Navy says, no, just pick one. The instructors in the school, Charlie [Charles M.] Duke was one. Hank [Henry W.] Hartsfield [Jr.] was an instructor. Hank was the instructor for our class. I didn’t have much to do with Charlie. [Richard H.] Truly and [Robert L.] Crippen were in MOL class that left just as we arrived there.\n\nSo, instructors, students, everybody was applying for both of these programs, and there was only a few of us Navy cats there. So Ed and I were the two Navy people that were in the program at the time. So we sat around and thought about it. Ed had just returned from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and we both sort of thought neither one of us would have ever gotten here if it hadn’t been for the military. Besides, you look at all those press releases and stuff, we’ll never get to fly at NASA, so let’s take the Navy program, take the military program. So we checked it off.\n\nWe all went down to Brooks, our Air Force base in San Antonio [Texas], for our physicals, had about a week down there for classes and things. They were going down for interviews in Houston, is when I found out that the Galveston Freeway is always under repair.\n\nSo we had done that. We came back, and we were attending—actually, I guess it was a two-week class in medicine. Fascinating class. We were doing this, but everybody was on pins and needles, believing that the selection process was going to happen soon.\n\nOne day, oh, noontime or so, someone came to the door and asked Ed Mitchell to—told him he had a telephone call. We all looked around and “What’s that?” Ed came back, and he didn’t say anything, but you could see he was beaming from ear to ear. And there were no more calls.\n\nI got called that night, but the way that happened was after the initial screenings, the list came out, and Ed and I were not selected for the [MOL] program. We had volunteered for the MOL program. We were not selected by the Air Force Screening Board, and of course we didn’t apply. A fellow who was in the school, his name was John Prodan, said, “You guys, I think you didn’t get picked up because you’re had the wrong color blue in your uniform.” He said, “Would you like to go to NASA?”\n\nWe said, “Well, of course, but, you know, somebody said the date’s over and the Navy said we couldn’t do both.”\n\nHe said, “Well, if I can get them to take your application, do you want me to do that?”\n\nWell, of course. I think John was worried about us because Ed and I, in the class standing, we were one and two. I think Truly and Crippen had more or less dominated the MOL early class, and I think there may have had some sensitivities about “these clowns that wear navy uniforms.” I think John worried about that too.\n\nSo he [interviewed us] for it, and they took us down and interviewed us. That was a fascinating little experience, my first introduction to John Young and Mike [Michael] Collins. Didn’t figure John out that day and didn’t do so for a long time after that either.\n\nBut I figured I was dead meat. When they finally called us back, called me late in the evening and all the rest of the class was waiting for the MOL list, and the class was really worried that if Ed got selected and I didn’t—so they were all hanging around and buying me beer and trying to keep up my spirits. Finally I got this phone call and Deke [Donald K. Slayton] asked if I’d like to join.\n\nObviously, yes. So I came out, and they could tell that the world had changed. “Now, you can’t tell anybody. The announcement will be out here one of these days before the end of the week, but you can’t tell anybody.”\n\nI said, “Okay.”\n\nSo you cannot tell anybody, but you can’t hide that from your friends. I mean, they can look and see. So we all decided to go down to the Riverwalk [in San Antonio] and went to some Mexican place, and we were just going to go celebrate. Everybody knew we couldn’t say anything, but we celebrated anyhow.\n\nSo we’re sitting around this table, and the waiter comes over. He handed me a piece of paper. He said, “This lady over here would like your autograph.”\n\nSomebody recognized me? Wait a minute. How does she know? I said, “Who does she think I am?”\n\nHe said, “Aren’t you Dickey Smothers?”\n\nI said, “No, but let me give you this and just hang onto it for a week.” [Laughs]\n\nWright: How funny.\n\n[T. K. Mattingly included the following comments to provide a more chronologically correct sequence of events.]\n\n[The course at ARPS (Aerospace Research Pilot School) was scheduled for 12 months. Our class began in the spring of '65. Ed Mitchell and I were the two Navy participants. The class also included Bo Bobko who subsequently was assigned to NASA after the MOL program was cancelled. Two of the ARPS instructor pilots, Charlie Duke and Hank Hartsfield also ended up at NASA. Dick Truly and Bob Crippen had been Navy participants in the class that graduated as we arrived and both had been selected as part of the first MOL contingent.\n\nIn the summer of '65, both NASA and MOL announced that they would be selecting additional astronauts in 1966. The selection process for military applicants involved applying to the parent service which set its own criteria and convened a service selection board which forwarded applications to NASA and/or MOL for further consideration and ultimate selection. Navy applicants were required to designate their interest in participating in either the MOL or NASA programs but not both. The USAF, on the other hand, permitted its officers to apply for MOL, NASA or both. Most Air Force pilots naturally applied for both programs. Ed Mitchell and I, faced with the choice of applying only for one or the other, chose MOL.\n\nMost of our ARPS class and many of the instructors submitted applications and were sent to Brook AFB for physicals. Applications for those that passed their physicals were forwarded to the MOL and NASA selection boards for consideration. After initial screening, the MOL and NASA selection boards released lists of applicants that would be interviewed. When the MOL list came out, (MOL published its list in advance of NASA) Ed and I were devastated to find that we had not been selected for an interview by the MOL program although our Air Force classmates were. Since we had not been permitted to apply for both programs, we were immediately out of the running. Fortunately for us, one of the schools instructors, LCOL John Prodan, thought that we deserved another chance and arranged for the Navy to submit our applications to the NASA selection board. This time we made the interview cut along with several other from the school. It was during this visit to Houston that we learned that the Gulf Freeway was perpetually under repair and met John Young and Mike Collins who were members of the NASA interview team. I was perplexed by John, couldn't figure him out. Mike was much more approachable and asked about flying and in particular wanted to know what I thought about the F-104. I told him it was about as much fun as anything I'd ever flown but wouldn't be worth much in combat. He furrowed his brow and I knew I had blown it.\n\nThe next step in selection was to wait for the board results, due out in late winter or early spring '66. The ARPS curriculum was presented in two six month segments, aircraft and space. Space came last and included a two week aerospace physiology course at Brook AFB in San Antonio, Texas. This school was one of the most fascinating experiences imaginable but our thoughts were preoccupied by the fact that the astronaut selections were imminent. About noon one day during the second week, Ed was called out of class for a telephone call. He came back grinning from ear to ear but said nothing. The day ended with no more calls and I was in a real funk. The rest of the class was trying to bolster my spirits and decided we should all go down to the River Walk for a drink. Just before we left, I got a call from Deke who asked if I'd like to come aboard. When I said yes, he told me I was not to tell anyone until an official announcement was made, in a few days. Obviously, I didn't have to say anything to Ed and the others so we all went out to celebrate. We were sitting at one of those outdoor places along the river having a few beers when the waiter brought me a napkin and said that a woman at another table wanted my autograph. We all looked at each other and asked, how can she know? Someone asked the waiter who he thought I was? He said, are you Dickie Smothers? When we recovered, I told him no, but tell her to hold on to this, my first autograph, for a couple of days.]\n\nMattingly: So that’s how you get into space.\n\nWright: So how soon after the announcement was made or when you learned that you were able to report for duty? Was it soon?\n\nMattingly: I don’t remember what that timing was. But I do remember we got to Houston in May of ‘66. The class—we had not graduated. I think graduation was after we reported to Houston. I remember we had to fly back out so we could go to graduation. It was right at the end of that period. So from the time we knew about it until we departed, oh, boy, a month at the most.\n\nWright: Once you got there, the training process began and your life changed once more.\n\nMattingly: When we got there, we learned what it means to be the “Excess Nineteen.” [Laughs] “Why are you people here? What are you going to do?”\n\nWe said, “I don’t know. Whatever you say.” I don’t think they were—obviously they did not—the feeling was they didn’t need any more help, which they probably didn’t. But we were there, and so we became go-fers for a lot of things. They put us in classes. It was interesting, but, you know, it wasn’t like doing work.\n\nI don’t remember that, to be honest. I’m sure somebody has some calendars that shows what happened in that first year, but it wasn’t a terribly memorable period. We got introduced to geology. I don’t remember when that started, but I think it either started after the [Apollo 1] fire, may have been after the fire, but before that I think we were just all assigned, given assignments to go work on different little projects. With so many of us, there was kind of a scramble to find a job. I didn’t know anybody that was in the program, and a number of people did, and so they kind of mentored them and steered them into “Here’s where you need to be.”\n\nEd was easy to place just because with his Ph.D. and his style, why, he captured everybody’s—he was older and everybody had a great deal of admiration for him from the beginning. I didn’t know anybody there, and so I just kind of—I don’t remember what my initial assignment was. It was something so nondescript, I can’t remember it.\n\nBut Ed [Edward G.] Givens [Jr.], who was an Air Force officer and had known a number of the people, the senior people that were already there, they had given him the job of the space suit and things like that, because I guess Ed had worked with them on the Gemini EVA [extravehicular activities] exercises as an Air Force officer. So Ed took that job. Unfortunately, Ed was in an automobile accident not too long into that year.\n\nSo nobody that had what were perceived as good jobs wanted to go do that, but I was so fascinated with these Gemini pictures of Ed [Edward H.] White [II] and people floating around, and those pictures were just indelibly engraved in my head, and I said, “You know, this is on the ground, but that stuff really looks pretty cool, and I’d like to try that.” So I asked if I could take that. I think there was some skepticism. What did I know about it? And the answer was “Nothing.” But it started one of the most fascinating and rewarding periods that I’ve had.\n\nBecause we went a long time without doing real space things, I was one of the few who actually had a job. It was just a fluke of a circumstance, and it wasn’t all that glamorous to do it on the ground. Go do it in space, that’s different, but all the stuff on the ground wasn’t all that glamorous. So they were quite content to let me go off and do that on my own.\n\nSo I didn’t know what a program manager was or anything like that, but de facto I sort of became one. I went over and was getting briefed on all this stuff. We were getting ready to put the Apollo suit through its initial acceptance and doing all that. I looked at this thing, and I remember they had this emergency oxygen pack that went on the back. The backpack was this thing they called a Portable Life Support System, PLSS. On the back of it was a little doughnut that was maybe six, seven inches in diameter. This was the emergency oxygen supply. It had a little wire with a wooden green apple on the end of it like an emergency oxygen bottle in an airplane, and you pulled this thing. They said this gives you thirty minutes of emergency oxygen.\n\nI said, “Hmm. That little thing. This backpack is good for four hours, and it’s this huge thing. Why is that?”\n\nWell, after a while I found out what it had thirty minutes of oxygen for was, as you breathe, your body burns a certain amount of oxygen out of the air. So what this little bottle had was enough oxygen to make up what you would burn out of the air, but not enough to provide thirty minutes of volume, but just to make up the oxygen from it. It was there in case the oxygen supply actually was depleted, leaked or something, but it didn’t affect the integrity of the space suit. It had nothing to do with the leaks in the suit or anything like that. It also meant you could breathe for thirty minutes, but you really should be quiescent, because there wasn’t that much oxygen in that little bottle.\n\nSo they explained all this to me and the rationale, and I spent a very agonized weekend or so. I kept looking at it saying, you know, I can’t imagine what it would feel like to be on the lunar surface and that’s all the protection you’ve got. Here people are going to go walk away from this thing, and just the act of getting in and the depressurizing. I said, you know, I just don’t think I’m really quite that brave.\n\nThese guys, I talked to some of the senior people in the office, and they said, “Aw, come on, kid. This is nothing. We do that all the time.”\n\nSo I finally went to Deke and told him, I said, “I don’t think this is adequate,” explained it to him.\n\nHe said, “That’s not what I’ve been told. Are you sure about that?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nSo he had to go check it out, and he came back and says, “You’re right. We’re not going to send anybody out there with that,” which started me off on a bad foot with some of the people in CSD [Crew Systems Division] because I had thrown mud in their punch bowl, but it also started some friendships with some people there that I treasure to this day. It was a small group of people, and it was just a really good bunch of people.\n\nI remember that since no one else wanted to do these things, that I got to be a test subject. They had a professional test subject, Jackie [Mays]. I can’t think of his name now. Jackie—big, strapping, tough guy. I was a scrawny little runt. One of the deals was, space suits were rare and expensive, and so, you know, you didn’t make space suits for the test subjects. You made space suits for flight crews, and then the test subjects would try to find the one that was closest to the right size.\n\nNothing fit me, and so I had Frank Borman’s suit. Frank Borman and I are not the same size in any dimension, and it was really miserable in there. Old Jackie would help me. He was teaching me the ropes, being a test subject. So we got to be pretty good friends. As I learned more about it, I started getting involved in writing some of the test programs, since we built this. We sort of designed the requirements and the system together, then we kind of wrote the test program. It was just, just really fascinating. That bunch of people at Crew Systems was really, really a lot of fun.\n\nWe got to work in these—had that one big chamber down in the back of the campus where they had the solar illumination panels. They built it to put in the command and service module [CSM] and the lunar module [LM] in a vacuum in a radiation environment. To show that the space suit was going to work on the surface, we were supposed to go in there. The space suit, when it’s pressurized, would hold up the backpack. The backpack weighed 150, 200 pounds. I don’t know, it’s pretty heavy, and it’s very clumsy to walk in. If you see pictures of people walking on the surface, it looks pretty cool, but that was after the program had matured a good bit and in a sixth of a G. But in 1 G, that thing was kind of hard to push around, especially if it didn’t fit you.\n\nThe deal was you went into an airlock and then they hooked you up to a weight lift that would hold the backpack in case your suit sprung a leak so this thing wouldn’t fall on you. But all of this mechanism and cables and stuff was all behind you. You couldn’t see back here. If it got hung up or jammed—and I kept practicing it, I could just envision myself getting stuck halfway into this thing, not able to come out, not able to turn around, can’t see, I’m hung up by something, I don’t know what it is. I finally convinced them that it was actually safer to let me walk in there. If I thought the suit was going to lose pressure, I would promise to fall down so it didn’t fall on me. I would just roll over. Convinced them that that was probably safer.\n\nSo our last episodes in the suit testing was to go in and do that, walk in, turn on all these solar simulators that were supposed to make it hot. Then you still got to do this terribly exciting job of it had a step. To work up a metabolic load, you would step up on this thing and down. You can’t believe how boring that can be when you do that for four hours. Just horrible.\n\nBut there were a couple of little vignettes I got a kick out of it. We worked hard on the gloves. The gloves were the things that you need the most tactility. We were just having real trouble. My hands are not big. I used to curl weights and squeeze rubber balls, and all I did was get tired. I didn’t get any stronger, and I just wasn’t going to do it.\n\nSo I figured, well, maybe somewhere in the world there’s somebody that’s got hands that are no stronger than mine, so might as well let that be the standard. We tried all kinds of gloves, different things, just trying to get some tactility and mobility into it. But by the time you put the thermal insulation on there so you can handle this—they had this requirement that the environment had to go—even though we weren’t going to land this way, all the equipment had to be qualified to go from sunrise or from noon until midnight. So that’s means it had to go through all the cold stuff at worst and all the hot stuff. Even though we weren’t going to be there that, but that’s the specs [specifications] that we had to meet.\n\nYou had to be able to do certain things like pick up a rock that’s been exposed to the sun on the Moon and hold it long enough to put it in a bag. So we devised a test for that. To do that, we had an iron rod that was a couple of inches in diameter, put heaters on it. In the midst of all this environment, one of the latest tests was, okay, you’ve got to do all this in a vacuum to make sure it’s working right. So we’ll crank the temperature of this rod up, and once it gets stabilized, then you go and grab it and hold it, and we’ll count for two minutes, and you let go.\n\nSo, okay. So they said, “All right. Let’s go.”\n\nI go out there, grab it. We did a good job. That’s really—it’s getting warm. It’s getting very hot. I’ve got to let go. Then you think about the things you didn’t think of. Okay, I let go of the rod, but the heat got to me by getting the glove hot. The glove is still hot. How do you get away from the glove?\n\nThat’s where being in a space suit that doesn’t fit saves you, because in a suit that fit, the answer was, you don’t. But having one of these suits that didn’t fit, I was able to pull my arm out of the suit arm, so I just left this balloon out there with what looked like a glove with my hand up in the air. In fact, I have one picture of me in the suit where I had pulled my arm all the way out of the suit arm and was scratching my nose. You’re not supposed to be able to do that.\n\nThat was a really neat program. I’m trying to remember some of the people. There was a young PLSS engineer. His name, I cannot remember. I can see his face. Maurice Carson was the program manager for it, I think. Jerry [C.] Poradek was the thermal guy. Craig [A.] Castle, he was the Ham[ilton] Standard guy. There was a couple of people from that group, and we just all formed this little club. It was really, really was just a very rewarding experience. Then when we got through, why, we wrote up all the procedures and gave them to the big boys to go use.\n\nWright: What time span was this? How long were you able to stay with them to work?\n\nMattingly: You know, I don’t know what that was. Let’s see. The fire was in—\n\nWright: January ‘67.\n\nMattingly: ‘67. So we stood down for a year there. So I think I must have gotten into this job in ‘66, guessing. So it was over a year.\n\nIn fact, I remember that while all of the other things were standing down, I had this job to do that was kind of going on and really was the most active thing of what we were doing, because everybody else was caught up in waiting for the engineering to finish.\n\nWhen we got ready to resume flying, I remember that the rumor was out that because we were behind schedule, one of the things that they were going to do to catch up was they were going to assign teams and put them in place and leave them there, and everybody would do the same jobs. They’d have three crews, I think it was, that would just keep cycling over and over until someone landed. Because in those days we really didn’t think the first try would work. It just seemed too preposterous. So they were going to have a couple of crews that would keep cycling. There would be a group of people who would accept lunar modules. There would be a group of people that would accept the CSMs. Some people who work at the Cape. We’d all just go there and learn our jobs and try to be proficient at it, and then just keep turning the cranks, and we could fly as often as possible, which actually is a very sound way to operate.\n\nFred [W. Haise] and Jim [James B.] Irwin and [John Bull] were sent to Grumman [Aircraft Engineering Corp.]. I went to [North American Rockwell Corp.] Downey [California] with the CSM. I’m trying to think if Jack [John L.] Swigert may have been in that group. I don’t remember who else was sent out there. But at that point, all of the focus was on the lunar module and the CSM was kind of—and so there were a couple of us that were a little bit disappointed to think that we were going to get stuck here doing this for the duration.\n\nIn fact, I think that policy was probably announced. I know we believed it then. I don’t remember whether it was announced or whether we just perceived it. Certainly the procedure guys who were on the flying crews didn’t want to discourage you from thinking that.\n\nSo I spent half my time in Downey checking out spacecraft. I was working on the one for Frank Borman in what was to be called the E mission. The original Apollo buildup went from the—you know, to fly an Earth orbit to doing a docking and then do a high ellipse. It seemed like there may have been two of those in there, but the E mission was the high ellipse. When I heard we were working on it, I thought this isn’t going to—space is space, but in this buildup of things, this doesn’t seem like the most productive mission.\n\nIt was the one that Frank was assigned to command. They’d come out to Downey to run one of the last tests. They’d leave us go-fers to get it all ready, but when it came for the big integrated test, why, they went in and ran it. That test process always takes longer than you think, and so we had a little ready room there outside the floor where they did the checkouts where we could sleep. Because you’d come in at eight in the morning, but the test might be two o’clock tomorrow morning. It was always delayed thirty minutes at a time, and you never knew.\n\nSo we were all staying there, and Frank got a call to go back to Houston. So he went back to Houston. We stayed. I don’t remember whether Frank flew back and told us to pack our bags or whether he called and told—it was that Bill [Anders] and Mike [Collins] to go back. It was the middle of the week sometime, because they called us all together and said we’re going to have a briefing. I believe it was Saturday morning. We walked in, and that’s when they revealed to us that they were going to do the Apollo 8 circumlunar mission.\n\nI don’t think I have any records that would pin down dates, so some day I’ll have to figure that out, because I want to think it was in the September, October time frame, but I just don’t remember. But I remember from that Saturday morning, it was twenty-four/seven [twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week] until they got down. Of all of the events to participate in, you know, I was lucky because I could do Apollo 11 as well as 8 and then 13.\n\nBut being part of Apollo 8, it made everything else anticlimactic. You know, our purpose was to go land on the Moon, but somehow participation, the angst that went with that Apollo 8 mission was far more electrifying. I remember after the first set of briefings, I remember going home one night, and listening to these meetings, it’s like no one had ever thought about going to the Moon. We’ve been in this program for how many years, and yet people are asking questions that are almost like, “Does anyone know where the Moon is and how to find it?” And here we’re supposed to be going.\n\nIt was built into those beginnings of what they started calling data priority. There were so many questions, and every one of them needed an answer. But the difference between designing hardware and getting ready to fly a mission, this was my first exposure to how dramatically different that was. Bill [Howard W. Tindall, Jr.] came out and started having these meetings. His initial charter, as I understand it, was just see if you can figure out an order that we can answer these questions in, because we can’t do it all at once. Let’s do the most important ones first. So we started having these meetings.\n\nThat kind of put some sanity and sense to it. It created this thing we called Tindallgrams. Because Bill Tindall would listen. These meetings would go on sometimes two days, and they would be eight in the morning until eight in the evening, whatever it took. Room filled with people. Not always a lot of decorum. Bill was after answers. It was nowhere near as a collegial environment as you see in some organizations today.\n\nBut they were after what was right, and everybody was passionate about. Everybody was young so they were kind of brash and there wasn’t a lot of patience anywhere. So some of those meetings were very, very colorful. Some of the characters were colorful. At the end of this, you were just inundated with all of this stuff you’ve heard. And now what?\n\nAnd the next day you would get this two-, maybe three-page memorandum from Bill Tindall written in a folksy style, saying, “You know, we had this meeting yesterday. We were trying to ask this. If I heard you right, here’s what I think you said and here’s what I think we should do.” And he could summarize these complex technical and human issues and put it down in a readable style that—I mean, people waited for the next Tindallgram. That was like waiting for the newspaper in the morning. They looked forward to it.\n\nI just remember that I’ve always talked to people about this amazing skill. One day I was talking to Malcolm Johnson, who was an MIT guy and had been a very close friend of Bill Tindall’s. He says, “I’ve got a complete set. Would you like one?”\n\nI said, “You’re kidding. Yes.”\n\nSo Malcolm went and made a copy for me of the complete unexpurgated set of Tindallgrams, which I unfortunately have in storage right now, but that’s one of my prize possessions. Bill was just—I don’t know if—you folks probably didn’t start this program in time to talk with him.\n\nWright: No, but we hear the same comments from everybody that talks about him.\n\nMattingly: Absolutely extraordinary guy. He was so far up in the hierarchy that I knew very little about him, other than he came and used the gym with us, so I could see him periodically. He had this blue Pantera that it was his pride. You would even see it parked out at the gym a lot.\n\nBill left NASA before I did. I thought he went to Washington or somewhere, but I didn’t know what he did. We weren’t particularly close, because there was such a difference in our positions more than in age. But in those days it seemed like a lot.\n\nWhen I went to Washington [DC] to go back to the Navy, I moved into a condo that was in Crystal City [Virginia] because it was five minutes to work, and I thought that, in Washington, was a good deal. It had underground parking. I got a slot assigned there. One day I walked by, and there was this blue Pantera sitting over there, and I thought, “I’ll be darned. I haven’t seen one of those in a long time. It looks just like Bill’s.” Never gave it a thought. I saw it a couple of times. I even mentioned it to somebody once. “Hey, you know, I’ve only known one person that had one of those.”\n\nHe said, “Well, is it theirs?”\n\nI said, “Surely not,” but I walked over and looked at it, and it still had an MSC sticker on it, and I said, “It might be. Maybe he sold it.” So I went up to the desk and said, “Do you have a Bill Tindall?”\n\nThey said, “Well, we have a Howard W. Tindall.”\n\nI said, “You’re kidding.” Right there in the same condo, three or four floors below me. I went up and knocked on the door, and, sure enough, that was him. So we renewed our acquaintance. Unfortunately, that was towards the end of his life, and he was starting to suffer from it, but he was as extraordinary then as he was. He’s just a remarkable person.\n\nWright: Well, we’ve heard how he’s really put the glue of keeping so many things—\n\nMattingly: Everything.\n\nWright: — together. I’m sure in Apollo 8 there was so much going on trying to accomplish so much in a small amount of time. Tell us about your participation. Now, you worked as CapCom [capsule communicator] at part of 8?\n\nMattingly: [Laughs] I was supposed to be working the command service module. That was what I was supposed to be checking out. When I was assigned to the E crew, I was assigned—we were called support crew. I would call them go-fers. There would be three go-fers, and we were assigned to go-fer for somebody. I had the extraordinary fortune to be assigned to Bill [William A.] Anders. The go-fer job was, it meant you handled the guest list, you made phone calls, you did personal errands. It was not very much like what one dreams of when they say, “I want to grow up and be an astronaut.” Thank God Bill Anders never asked me to do one personal thing. Not one.\n\nBill was kind of—maybe that’s because my perception when I got there was that Bill was, for whatever reason, maybe he was too intellectual, I don’t know, but whatever it was, he was not one of the rising stars of his class. So he got thrown into this thing, and I think maybe because of that, he kept our relationship on a professional basis.\n\nOf course, knowing how my other friends were going along, I was very appreciative of all that. The first time out, I mean, every day was there’s this much to do and if we get some of it done. When I say twenty-four/seven, it was. It was like cramming for a degree, orals or something. It was twenty-four hours a day. You lived it. You grudgingly would grab a couple hours’ sleep.\n\nI remember one of the—in those days we were still trying to get our story together. So there are a lot of things that had grown up in the Johnson program that are extraordinary. One of them are these things that we call flight control schematics, big books of drawings of every system. But those were in their infancy at that point. Bill wanted a set of procedures and things, and we hadn’t yet matured the process to crank out all of these procedures.\n\nSo Bill told me he needed something, a reference for the electrical power system because they were having a sim [simulation] down at the Cape [Canaveral] at the end of the week, and he needed some kind of a help. He says, “Go make me a chart that draws the electrical system and the procedures.”\n\nSo I went back to my apartment and put rolls of paper on the floor and had all these books around it. It was probably in a space like this room. I was just drawing stuff from here and there in it, and then got all through and rolled it all up, the paper.\n\nBill calls and says, “Are you ready?”\n\nI said, “Well, I am because the clock’s run out.”\n\nHe said. “Okay. Get it here.”\n\nSo I roll this thing up, made a big roll of paper, three, four feet long, and rolled it up into a tube, took it out to Ellington [Air Force Base, California], got in my airplane, flew to the Cape, gave it to Bill, got back in my airplane and came home.\n\nBill didn’t plan ahead either, and so he took this roll into the simulator with him. Then when it came time to use it, he unrolls this, which won’t fit and it’s running out the door. Borman was really upset at how amateurish we had been. But out of that came some little better procedures and things.\n\nBut if it hadn’t been for Bill giving me that kick start, I don’t know how I would have turned out. To me, all of the things we did getting ready for the mission, trying to figure out, answer all these questions, those were the fascinating things. This time spent in the control center, learning to be a CapCom, which was always confusing to me at first because I’m one of these people that I can’t learn rote. I still have trouble with my Social Security number. I have to have a meaning to something, and then I never forget it. But give me a set of procedures and I’m in trouble. I think people see that, and, you know, they think I’m a pretty slow learner, which I am in terms of if that’s what you want me to do, I am slow.\n\nThe first introduction to MOCR [Mission Operations Control Room] was all these procedures and do this and do that, and, boy, I didn’t find that interesting. I found it threatening, just the maze of procedures. I was really concerned about that, whereas working on the flight techniques with Bill and all of the procedures and things that we were putting together based on understanding the system was right up my alley, and I just loved that. So the CapCom part on 8 was I got to know a lot of the controllers who became very close friends, but that friendship came out of when we got into their systems, not working in the control center. I’m trying to remember who the other—Jerry [Gerald P.] Carr and Vance [D.] Brand, I believe, were the other two. So we were going through this, and we had each had different phases.\n\nI guess one other little vignette that taught me something about the world. We were sitting in a meeting in JSC and there was some circuit that had been found to be deficient or put together wrong in the pyrotechnics that deployed the parachutes on the reentry. It was a design or manufacturing flaw, I don’t remember which. But it was in the backup system, and the fix was if this certain thing happened, then you should do this, and the way to fix that was to take a wire and cut it.\n\nThis was just a few days, maybe a week before launch. Nobody wanted to bother the crew. So we thought what we’re going to do is go down, put tape around it and a little mark, and then we’ll tell people, “Normally you don’t have to touch this, but if this one bad thing happens, we’ll call and tell you to open that panel and go get that.”\n\nSo got all this done and they said, “Okay Ken (as I was in those days), you’ve got access to an airplane. Fly it down and put it in. Here’s a picture of the drawings, and here’s where the tape goes. You open this panel on the side, inside the cabin, take this panel off, go in there, put the tape around it, put the panel back on.”\n\nSo I took a little piece of tape, and I went down and got in my airplane, I flew down the Cape. I drove from the airport up to the launch pad, went out still in my flight suit. These guys are all looking at me, and I climb in the cockpit. They said, “What are you doing?”\n\nI said, “Well, I’m here to put a piece of tape on this, inside this panel. Could I borrow your wrench and take this thing off?”\n\nHe says, “I don’t see that on this procedure.”\n\nI said, “No, this is special,” and I wrapped my tape around it and put it back.\n\nThe guy says, “Are you sure you’re supposed to be here?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nI went back, got my airplane, flew back to Houston.\n\nWhen I landed at Houston—it hadn’t been very many hours—when I landed, there was notes all over aircraft ops [operations] to call Arnie [Arnold D.] Aldrich now. I didn’t know who Arnie was. Well, I knew who he was, but this would be my first conversation, and it was not a pleasant one as he proceeded to explain to me the procedures and protocols and all this.\n\nI said, “But I sat right in that room with your guys. They’re the ones that walked me through it. They’re the ones that told me how it is.”\n\nHe says, “That’s got nothing to do with it. That’s not how we do things. If you’re going stay around here, you’re going to learn how we do things.”\n\n“Okay. Yes, sir.”\n\nThat also introduced one of the longest-lasting friendships. Arnie is another one of those really, really special people. I don’t know if you’ve talked to him yet?\n\nWright: Yes.\n\nMattingly: Okay. He is extraordinary.\n\nWright: He is that. He is that.\n\nDid you have the same role for Apollo 11?\n\nMattingly: [Laughs] After 8, we went through—on 8, the thing I really wanted to do is see these guys go into lunar orbit. I had had one of the periods going out, and we got all set up for a pre-LOI [lunar orbit insertion]. Jerry Carr came by to relieve me.\n\nI said, “Jerry, I’m going to go get some sleep. Call me when you get near that in case I sleep through or something, because I really want to come over and watch that.”\n\nI woke up that afternoon or something, and they must have done it. I ran over to the control center, and, of course, they were in lunar orbit. “Jerry, what happened?”\n\nHe said, “I forgot. I was so excited, I never thought about calling.” [Laughs] So I missed it. I missed the thing I really wanted to see.\n\nBut the other part of that thing was that the replacement, you know, getting this thing going, when we left that, I was then assigned to be one of the go-fers for Apollo 12. I was down at the Cape working, I think on one of the Cape vacuum chamber tests for the command service module, and that was really the first time I had run into—I knew Pete [Charles Conrad, Jr.] and Dick [Richard F.] Gordon [Jr.], but just knew who they were. There was class distinction. [Laughs]\n\nSo I was down there with them on this test. I don’t know, somebody called and said, “Come back to Houston.”\n\nI said, “Well, I’ve got to finish this test.”\n\n“No, you don’t. Come on back.” And they explained to me that Bill [Anders] had decided he was not going to stay in the program and been nominated to be the president’s advisor on space or whatever the title was in those days, and Apollo 8 crew was the backup crew for 11, but he was going to go take on his job because he had already been to the Moon. He was moving up to be the CMP [Command Module Pilot]. So he already knew all he had to know, so they needed someone to fill in in the simulations.\n\nThey wanted me to do that, but had no illusions that “If the backup crew flies, it’s not likely to be you.” That’s fine. So to be on Apollo 11 after being on 8 to go to be on Apollo 11 was really—and not to do it as a support guy, but as almost like a real person, I thought I had died and gone to heaven this time.\n\nOne day I was in the simulator and Neil [Armstrong] came out. I was in there and Neil came out, and he looked. He went back inside. The crew offices outside the simulator at the Cape generally had two offices. The backup crew would take one and the prime crew had the larger one. After we were back in the office, I overheard Neil go to [James A.] Lovell [Jr.] and said, “What’s Mattingly doing here?”\n\n“I think they’re right. My chances of flying aren’t very good.” [Laughs] Then Neil asked me what I was doing. I told him. He just looked at me with this—no expression, just, “Oh.” And it was the last thing he ever said. [Laughs]\n\nBut it gave me this just absolutely fascinating insight into what that was all about.\n\nWright: Of course, at that time you didn’t know that was pre-training to training for a future role.\n\nMattingly: As a matter of fact, it was in that—when was it? It was probably after 11, I guess, and, you know, probably while I was assigned to—well, I don’t remember when it was. There was a period in there before Deke used to make crew announcements in blocks. He’d wait till after a landing when the crew had come back, and he’d get everybody together, and they’d do a quick debrief, and then Deke would pull out this rumpled little notepad and say “And the crew for—will be.”\n\nI had gotten a letter from one of the families of a friend of mine who he had been shot down in [Viet]Nam, and I was trying to figure out how do you answer this letter? I said, I can’t sit here and here I am living in the lap of luxury and everybody that I grew up is getting these letters, and I can’t do this.\n\nSo I went in to [Alan B.] Shepard [Jr.], and told him, “I think it’s time for me to go. I’ve had fun, and it’s time for me to go back and earn my pay.”\n\nHe said, “Yeah, I can understand that.” He says, “Think about it for a week, ten days,” I don’t remember what he said, “and then come back. If you still feel the same way, tell me.”\n\nIt was in that period was when Deke announced that I was going to be on 13. I presume Al knew all that, but I didn’t, of course. So I went from being really, really depressed to really, really excited. I’m not sure, I think my assignment to 13 was—I think Lovell didn’t know me from Adam’s house cat. He might see me around. I believe he asked “Freddo” [Fred Haise]. He knew Freddo had more knowledge of the lunar module than anybody so he clearly was going to be Jim’s first pick.\n\nIn those days I think the commander was allowed to pick from a slate. I don’t know how big, but you had to kind of work your—I was able to glean that you had to work your way down a list and until everybody in this group had flown, this group wasn’t going to come in. But once they started the mix, then I think that Deke would pick the commander and give him some latitude in selection. I think it got to us, and they’re going to have two rookies. It was obvious that Jim wanted to have Freddo. My guess is, he asked Freddo, “Who do you want to fly with?”\n\nFred and I had become acquainted while I was at Edwards, and we both had this unusual passion for flying. So he and I became friends at Edwards and then remained very close friends when we got to Houston. We’d go out every Saturday and Sunday and fly and nights. We always flew together, and we just really racked up the hours and developed a very, very close relationship.\n\nThen when it’s time to split and support these different groups, Freddo went to Grumman and I went to Rockwell. I’m guessing that I probably owe my chance to go fly to Freddo. We never talked about it, but I just think that was probably the case, because Jim did not know me. But so then that started a new page.\n\nWright: Before we go there, we’re going to take a break so that we can put in a fresh tape and hear about how your adventures with Apollo 13 and 16 began.\n\nMattingly: Okay.\n\nWright: We were talking about Apollo 13, that you had been assigned to that crew. Tell me about your training and how the three of you became not as three individuals, but became the Apollo 13 crew.\n\nMattingly: Well, the training cycle was one of these things that, you know, the ideal thing, I think sometimes getting assigned to the crew was as much relief as going flying, because at that point your life did change. Your life changed. Suddenly instead of responding to a thousand other people’s schedules, your schedule was coordinated. You then had somebody who actually laid out your life for you and made sure that everything happened.\n\nYou got to do interesting things. You could go fly the simulators, which the rest of us were never allowed. We could look at them, but it was very rare that you had tests. That wasn’t because it was exclusive as much as it was they didn’t work that often, and when they were working, the time was precious and so you tried to keep the crews that were getting ready to fly there. You trained at Houston in a simulator, then you went to Florida and finished your training during the last couple of months there.\n\nSo this was our first chance to get away from books and drawings and all that stuff and go do things. This is where the difference in the way Fred learns and the way I learn just was really embarrassing, because we’d go over there for our first simulator training, and it was—I don’t know what it was, but it was some really, really benign thing, just a normal go through the procedures of a launch or something.\n\nFreddo, he took that checklist home, and he came in the next day, and, boy, Fred was the fastest switch-thrower button-pusher in the west. He could sit there and rattle this stuff off. It eventually became a big joke with us that Freddo had this characteristic of being very abrupt in everything he did. If he opened the door, he never used the doorknob; he explosively opened it. With Fred in the area, you always were cautious about walking by a door, because that was just his style.\n\nSo when it came time to do this training, Fred looked like he was Dr. [Robert H.] Goddard’s son or something. I mean, he knew every acronym. You mentioned a procedure, and the instructors couldn’t believe that Freddo knew all these things. He turned a book over, click, click, click. They were astounded.\n\nThey’d tell me to do something and [speaking slowly], “Step one, I did that. Why do you do this?” And everybody was really frustrated, and I was getting frustrated. I suspect Jim was.\n\nIt took a long time, but finally my own style of thinking caught up, and then I could leave the checklist at home and felt like I knew what I was doing with the system, and then I became comfortable with it and actually was able to step out and do things that were outside of the script. But that took a while coming.\n\nI think even by the time I got down to Florida, I think the training people were probably a little on the apprehensive side. But fortunately the learning curve crossed in that period, so I started making headway. That was important, because by now the lunar surface mission was becoming more and more important or getting more attention. As we tried to tighten up on what we could get done with the lunar module, it just took more and more training and effort. It was concentrating on that. Freddo and Jim were in that around the clock and doing their own surface training and geology and stuff.\n\nI was doing some orbital training, but for the most part, I was just trying to learn the spacecraft part of it. We had put together some extra activities I was going to do, but, by and large, I think the nature of the business just caused that the CMP generally embarked on his own training, and the lunar crew went about life together. We would meet for breakfast and dinner. In between, you know, you’d pass each other in the office between simulator sessions or something, but the separation was fairly distinct because there was just too much to do everything.\n\nCompared to the stuff they were going to go do on the lunar surface practicing sucking your thumb in Zero G for four days while you coast back and forth is not a very exciting thing. It was hard to get attention on that anyhow. So we just kind of went our separate ways, which I suspect—I don’t think 12 did that as much, but I think after 12, starting with 13, I think everybody kind of did go down these two parallel roads just because of the nature of the mission. So it was quite a difference, and Jim really didn’t pay any attention, but he just, whatever I told him, that’s what we’ll do, and that was just the way it was.\n\nSo as we approached the end of our training, we’d been doing this stuff, you know, work expands to fill the time allotted. We had a lot of time, and so we filled it with a lot of work. I’m sure we could have gone on our mission just as successfully as ever in much, much less time.\n\nBut when you’ve got that much at stake, the last thing you want to do is you do not want to be the one that blows it. Even in those days we understood that this is—“I don’t know how much money this is, but it’s a lot, and I really don’t want to be the cat that blows this mission.”\n\nWright: How long was your training period? Do you remember from the time that you were assigned as a crew till—\n\nMattingly: I don’t know. I guess it was a year. For the most part, we had gone to a two-per-year flight program after—11 went and then 12 went at the end of ‘69, and then we were supposed to go in April. So I think we probably started right after 11, I think, or at least not too long in that time frame. So it was nine to twelve months, but the time on 11 kind of counted too, because Jim was in there, and Fred was kind of the go-fer for that. So I think it may have been only nine months of designated training, but with all the preceding stuff it was a little longer.\n\nDave [David R.] Brooks, that’s his name, he was [the CSM engineer]—we had a little group that went to the Cape from the Houston office that there was a training coordinator [Lloyd Reeder] who just took care of arranging everything. There was generally a systems engineer who went down when the spacecraft arrived at the Cape and kind of was the den mother for the spacecraft and kept in touch with you.\n\nBut there weren’t too many people from Houston that went down to the Cape. So you kind of shifted your friendships. People you associated now with were those that were down there for the time period. Dave Ballard did the lunar module, and Dave Brooks did the command service module, came out of what was called then the Flight Crew Support Division, Jim [James W.] Bilodeau’s organization.\n\nWe had done the wet countdown demonstration for the launch vehicle. Those kinds of things, they’re interesting to the launch team because they’re getting to go do all the stuff they’re going to do. For the crew, this is not a very thrilling exercise. It’s a lot of laying in an uncomfortable position and just watching the paint dry.\n\nSo we got back. Dave Brooks came up to me after dinner or at dinner and said they had had a problem down on the spacecraft, some kind of a problem with detanking the oxygen from the service module. So our immediate thought was what you always worry about, “It’s not going to delay the launch, is it?” That’s question one for everything. “It’s not going to hold us up?” He said he’d keep us posted and let us know.\n\nSo I would guess that episode took all night and a good bit of the next day as they tried to review. Came back and Dave briefed me. He came in and wanted to know if we wanted to know what the status was. Jim said, “Ken’ll take care of it.”\n\nAnd so I listened to him, and he explained to me that they had this tank, and that they’d seen a problem like this before, and even though the regular drain system wasn’t working, they could boil the oxygen out. We went through all the procedures, how they put the heaters on. When the pressure came up, it would open the relief valve and boil out. I remember we talked about, “Well, how do you know that you’re not doing damage?” and “Well, we’ve got a guy watching the temperatures and it has these protective circuits in there, and we have actually done this somewhere else, and it’s not a big deal, take us overnight or something to boil it out. So that’s what we want to do, and that’s what we’re going to go do.” It was really a courtesy briefing, but if we had objected, I’m sure we’d have had more discussion.\n\nSo I listened. Dave thought it was—he researched it. He’s really a good guy. I said, “Okay. I’ll tell Jim.” So I told Jim and Freddo that this is what we’ve done and we’re going to go ahead and boil it out. They said, “Okay, fine.” And that was the sum total of thought about this stuff.\n\nThis is all down near the end. Again, I wasn’t keeping records of all the chronology of these things, so sometimes the sequence of events gets jumbled. But one of the weekends when Charlie [Duke]—it was the last weekend when we were able to go home. We generally stayed in Florida, and people would fly back to Houston for the weekend with their families and come back Sunday night. This, as I recall, was the last weekend before launch, which was probably not the weekend before the launch, but probably the weekend before the week before the launch. And nobody thought anything about it.\n\nSomewhere in there—I don’t remember all the details—we found out that a family that had gone to a picnic with Charlie and his family over the weekend, one of their kids had the measles, and Charlie was considered exposed. So they said, “It’s just a precaution, but it’s no big deal, because we can determine your susceptibility, and so we’ll just take some blood and then just kind of watch it.” We were sufficiently quarantined. There weren’t a lot of people around us, but it’s not isolation.\n\nSomewhere in there, they called me aside and said, “We need to take your blood again.”\n\n“Okay. Why is this?”\n\n“Well, your blood chemistry does not show the titer or the indication that you have had the disease and built a natural immunity.”\n\nSo I said, “Well, gee, I don’t know.”\n\nThey said, “Do you remember having it?”\n\n“No. I don’t know.” I called home. “Hey, Mom, did I have measles?”\n\nShe said, “No, I don’t think so. If you did, it was awfully mild, because it was never a big deal.”\n\nSo I told them that, and they said, “Oh.”\n\nI said, “Well, what does that mean?”\n\n“Well, we’ll just kind of watch you for a while,” which then evolved into a series of morning and evening blood draws and comforting things like feel your forehead. “Are you sick?”\n\n“No.” And so I said, “What is this nonsense? So if Charlie was exposed and I get sick, I might be immune, it might not be bad, and I might not get sick. So what’s—.”\n\n“Well, gee, the incubation period says that if you did—one scenario says if you did it on this time line, Charlie exposed you when he got back, you go through the incubation period, you’ll be in lunar orbit solo, and we don’t really think that’s a good idea. So we’re going to keep watching this, but let’s start giving Jack more training time in the simulator.” I had been a simulator hog, and so there was no excuse for not sharing.\n\nSo then everybody that was starting to gather for the launch, they were are all coming around saying, you know, “They’re not really going to put Jack in there, are they?”\n\nI said, “I don’t know. They say they might, but they haven’t decided.”\n\nThey said, “Ah, no. Nobody would do that. Don’t worry about it. It’s just for the public, to show that we’ve really done everything.”\n\nI wasn’t really all that sure, but I couldn’t intellectualize the idea that this might happen. It was pretty obvious that because our training had gone down these two roads, you probably could not afford to split the LM crew. But there were really opportunities. This, unfortunately, was no longer a tightly integrated group. They worked together, but those were procedural things, so you had the option. So the idea of delaying at very high cost, I don’t think was ever seriously considered by anybody.\n\nFor all the personal feelings about it, you know, I would only hope that as a manager I would have—it’s a non-decision. You take someone with no risk or a risk. Especially in the government where you’ll never be praised, but you’ll always be criticized for making a mistake, I mean, that’s a non-decision if there ever was one.\n\nBut we drug it out. I don’t know when the decision was actually made. Deke was down there by the time, and when Deke’s around, it’s always good, because he is the coolest—I don’t know. He and Shepard were both really cool. They just could not be rattled. But Deke was more talkative than Al, and Deke had this extraordinary simplicity that he could just say whatever mattered and only what mattered, and he would never tell you anything that he couldn’t produce.\n\nSometimes it would disappoint people because he would not offer hope, encouragement. Deke would just say, “If things work the way we hope, you’ll get all that it takes. If they don’t, why should I add to your disappointment?” And Deke was just—this whole program was filled with extraordinary people. I know it sounds silly to say that, but there really—a little moment in history because of the magnitude attracted just wonderful people, so there’s reason that there’s lot of extraordinary stories.\n\nWhen Deke got there, I thought, all right, I don’t know what the answer is. I asked him, “What’s going to happen?”\n\nHe said, “I don’t know.”\n\nI said, “Well, I guess that’s what it means.” Deke was not one of these people that has—he’s not an emotional person. But anyway, we were sitting at dinner, and he said, “You must be really getting bored sitting around watching Swigert practice.”\n\n“Yep.”\n\nHe says, “Go down and fly. You know, get rid of your frustrations.”\n\nI had the blood test in the morning, and it was one of these things I knew something was happening because Dr. [Charles A.] Berry showed up. I think [Dr. Charles K.] Lapinta was the flight surgeon that was with us and a guy from the Cape. Chuck Berry was not a favorite of the astronaut corps. He was one of the original people. I know Deke had a close relationship and a very professional and friendly one. For the rest of us, he was a threat. He could never say a yes, but he could always say no, and you don’t like people like that. So it’s just a joke that aviators and doctors don’t get along anyhow. So when they said, “Berry’s coming down and he’s going to probably want to give you a physical himself.”\n\nSo he showed up in the morning, and they did the most cursory physical I think I’ve ever had, and left. They took some more blood, and we look at the blood every day and there’s nothing here.\n\nSo I guess that was when Deke says, “Why don’t you go fly.” So I got in the car, drove down to Patrick [Air Force Base, Florida], went out and flew for a while. Sure enough, felt better. Got in the car to drive back up. This is two days, I think, two days before launch, I think. I’m driving up the road, turned the radio on, and they interrupt the news announcement that this afternoon NASA has announced that they have changed and substituted Jack Swigert for me. I just kind of pulled over to the side of the road and sat there for a while. If this is a practical joke, it’s really well done, but I don’t think this is a joke.\n\nI went back out there, and nobody knew what to say. I know Deke well enough to know that he never said anything about it, but he must have been ready to kill somebody for letting that happen. But Deke would not share that. I just know him. That’s not going to do anybody any good.\n\nSo it wasn’t that night, that must have been the day before, because the next day was the day before launch. By now everything’s off and running, and Deke said, “What do you want to do tomorrow? You want to stay here? Do you want to go back?”\n\nI said, “Deke, I don’t think I can stay here. I’d rather not. I’ll do whatever you want.”\n\nHe said, “Well, if you want to go home, go home. If you want to watch from the MOCR, I’ll call them and tell them you’re going to be there.”\n\n“Okay, I’ll do that.”\n\nIt was, I don’t know, late in the evening, I mean, nine o’clock or so. I drove down to Patrick, and I called and said I was going to come take an airplane. In the evening down there, it’s really quiet. When you’d show up, you had to go to the line and wake up somebody and say, “Would you get a couple of guys to come help me start my airplane?”\n\nThe parking ramp was close to where you could park the cars, so I went there first to put my gear in the airplane before I went to get the line crew. There was three guys there. The starter was already hooked up. No one said a word. They just came out and helped me put the stuff in the airplane. So I got my flight plan and headed back for Houston.\n\nBy now it’s somewhere in here it’s getting near midnight. When you fly late at night, there’s a lot of air traffic, radio traffic in the air up until, oh, about ten o’clock in the evening, and then the airliners and all generally end their day, so the center controllers often where they have centers across the United States that work regions of air traffic control and they go from one to the other, then late at night they’ll merge so that they may pass you from Jacksonville center to New Orleans, but the voice will be the same. They’re just changing radios, but it’s just one guy that’s now taking care of all this.\n\nI used to love flying late at night because the chatter’s gone. There’s not a lot of distractions. If you’re like me, I’m never tired of watching the lights on the ground. To this day I could just—that’s just perfect, to do that. So I kind of like flying late at night, there’s quiet, and nobody ever talked to you. You’d get two transmissions, one where you checked in with a center at this end of his geographical area and then another one when you checked out and he gave you a new frequency to go to. You just don’t chatter on the traffic controls. It’s just not professional. Every now and then somebody would, you know, be friendly. Some airliner would ask what’s the ball score or something so he could tell his passengers, but that was the limit.\n\nSo I took off, got up, and these guys kept asking me this, asking me that, asking me this. They never stopped talking. Our call sign was NASA whatever your side number was, so they knew—not one word was ever said about the mission. They were just talking. It’s totally different now. All the way back to Houston, there was not a—and when I landed in Houston, which normally you land at midnight at Ellington and you go in, you pull your airplane up, you shut it down, go over and find some chocks. Generally there’s nobody there, and you put the airplane to bed and you drive home.\n\nWhen I got there, there was a couple of maintenance guys. That was good, because my car was at home, not at the airport. So they gave me a ride home. I can’t prove it, but we have a lot of rules about you can’t fly after you’ve been on a workday of so long, and this violated those things in spades. I think, you know, Deke’s the kind of person, I think he knew that that was the right thing to do, and he would take the hit if anyone brought up the fact that I had gotten up in the morning and here it was much beyond the normal workday, flying day, and that he probably arranged to make sure that these folks kept me awake.\n\nWright: The next day or when it was time to launch, did you go to the MOCR and participate there?\n\nMattingly: Yes, I went over to the MOCR. Of course, they had CapComs and everything, so I was a fifth wheel. I remember sitting on the steps next to the CapCom console, just sitting on the floor because the visitors’ room is full of visitors. So I was just sitting there. I really was feeling very down, very sorry for myself.\n\nWright: I imagine everybody understood your position. I’m sure nobody could understand exactly how you felt, though.\n\nMattingly: No. It was a close group, and we’d all worked together lots. The nice thing was no one ever said anything. They knew better. They just didn’t.\n\nSo I went through it, and I had put a bunch of the stuff in the flight plan on my own, pictures I was going to take and different things I was going to do that were not part of the official plan, but I put these things in and now people kind of expected it. Jack certainly understood the command service module after he worked hard on that. So I thought, I’ll talk Jack through some of these procedures he’s not familiar with. So I kept thinking, you know, I’ll still have something to do here. Shouldn’t take very long. Jack didn’t need any help.\n\nSo in early days of the program, I forget the name of the FM radio station or what the call sign was, it was classic music, but when a mission was going on, they put the entire air-to-ground on the radio. That had ended by the time we got into this part of Apollo, and you didn’t get that anymore. I think they generally wired it up so the families could have an air-to-ground box that they could listen to at home. But since I wasn’t supposed to be there, there wasn’t anything like that.\n\nSo the only way I was going to get to see this, they were going to do this TV show when they activated the LM and checked it out. So the only way to see that was to go over to the MOCR and sit in the viewing room.\n\nSo I went back and was sitting in the viewing room to watch the TV show, and Mr. [George W. S.] Abbey came in. Then when the video was over, he says, “You look like you need a drink.”\n\nI said, “You got that right.”\n\nHe said, “Okay. Let me go get my briefcase and we’ll go over to the Singing Wheel.” He didn’t get back. Right after that is when Jim called down and said that they’d had this event. It didn’t take an awful long time for me to get rid of my hostility for doctors. They have done me a really good favor. [Laughs]\n\nAfter that, from that moment on, the movie of Apollo 13, it’s a pretty good movie. The book is pretty good. I think The Race to the Moon book’s description is probably a little better. And they all fall way short. I always thought that that was—I didn’t know why, I just knew I was watching—I had seen the most extraordinary event. In substance it far outweighed anything in Apollo 8 or 11. It was a different kind of story, but it was really remarkable.\n\nAs soon as this happened, I thought, “What did he say?” I went down to the control center inside and said, “What was that?”\n\nThey said, “I don’t know. He said something about he’s got a problem and we got this telemetry data that’s all messed up.” I think Sy [Seymour A.] Liebergot was probably the EECOM [Electrical, Environmental, and Communications Engineer], and all the mess was on his console, and the CapCom’s console position in that configuration was adjacent, across the aisle from EECOM.\n\nIt was fascinating. We had trained so hard to avoid making mistakes, being tricked. Jay [F.] Honeycutt was the sim sup [simulation supervisor] in those days. At that job Jay was absolutely extraordinary. Boy, those guys, they’re probably the reason that this whole program worked, because they figured out what they needed to do and they did it with extraordinary skill and ingenuity.\n\nBut we learned that we could fool ourselves with instrumentation and respond to a problem that wasn’t real, and make a nonevent into something unpleasant. So we tried really hard to recognize instrumentation failures. Jay and his team worked around the clock, I think, trying to think of different kinds of failures that we didn’t know about.\n\nSo when this crazy set of signatures came up, the initial reaction from everybody was “It’s an instrumentation failure.” We hadn’t seen this, but that’s the only thing that could ever explain this array of symptoms. Because all our procedures were based on two practical rules. One of them is, structural things don’t break. Actually, that drove everything. Fluid lines and structural—you know, joints can leak, shorts can happen to wires, but physical structure doesn’t break.\n\nThe reason we had that rule is, if you admitted to that, then the number of things that you could have to prepare for is infinite. It’s big anyhow, but it was a practical matter. We had done a lot of testing of this, a lot of margin of safety in the hardware, so we never looked at those kinds of implications.\n\nIt wasn’t until, well, I watched this turmoil and confusion, and it was probably the only time—certainly the only time I’ve ever seen it—probably the only time in NASA’s history that there was confusion in the control center. But there was. I mean, it was back rooms trying to say, “Well, we’ve got this information,” and the nature of the signature was such it affected almost every system in the command module, so everybody was into the discussion.\n\n[Glynn S.] Lunney’s team was in the building to relieve [Eugene F.] Kranz’s team. Some of them were already in the floor, so you had more people in there than you would as they were going through their briefings and changeover. So more people is a help unless they decide to help and then there’s more—there was this brief period and somebody could look at the tapes. I know it’s discernible. I have no idea. I would have guessed ten, fifteen minutes might have transpired in this discussion about, “Well, it could be this. It could be that.”\n\nGene would try to say, “Well, be calm. Is it this or is it that?” “Well—” He was really under the gun and totally confused, and his back room was equally confused. They could see more than he could, but they couldn’t make sense of it.\n\nFinally, somewhere in there he said, “Well, I think it’s got to be instrumentation. We’re looking at different symptoms to see if I can tell you how this is.”\n\nSomewhere in there, Gene says, “Sy, didn’t Jim say that he looked out the window and there’s stuff out in the sky and he heard something?” He says, “Does that sound like instrumentation to you?”\n\n“Well, I’ll get back to you.” [Laughs] In the midst of this, they did the hand-over. Glynn stepped in, and this is where the most magnificent display of personal leadership that I’ve ever seen, because there was confusion, not—chaos is not the right word. People were confused. They were highly trained to do things, but this was out of the experience base, and it was real, and we didn’t understand it.\n\nGlynn came in, and Gene was still there, so I mean nobody left. We had these extra people, and they got into a discussion. Glynn stood up and in his quiet way—the contrast between Glynn’s speech and Gene Kranz’s speech is really stark. Gene’s crisp and precise and sometimes loud, and Glynn is quiet and laid back. He went around and he just started asking people, and my sense was that he was asking questions that were relevant, but not particularly important, but he went to every position to the room and gave them a question to get back to him on. So all of a sudden—I’ve never asked him about it, but my sense was, it didn’t matter what question he asked. It was just get your mind on something constructive, and then it’ll all take care of itself.\n\nYou could almost feel the room settle down. Emotions didn’t go away and all that, but all of a sudden they were back to the team that had trained with a sharp focus and a procedure that they followed.\n\nThen we went through a number of these debates. The first one was, “We don’t know the condition of the service module. We don’t know any of this.” We hadn’t yet deduced what the problem was, but we knew the implication and EECOM could tell us we had a couple hours at best, and it was going to be too late.\n\nSomebody, don’t really know who, I have a feeling it might been Jack [R.] Lousma who had come in to see what was going on, maybe he was CapCom at the time, and mentioned a thing called LM lifeboat, which this goes back to why this simulation stuff is to important. Turns out on Apollo 13 we didn’t do but one thing out of the entire mission that had not been simulated in some way before. Movies and everything makes it look like we invented a lot of stuff. Well, thanks to the kind of simulation training program we had, maybe the things weren’t exactly the same or in an exactly the same order, but everything we ended up doing had been done somewhere.\n\nSo somewhere in an earlier sim, there had been an occasion to do what they call LM lifeboat, which meant you had to get the crew out of the command module and into the lunar module, and they stayed there. I vaguely remember—when you have a really exciting sim, why, generally everybody knows about it. I vaguely remember that they had come up with a thing that contaminated the atmosphere in the command module, and they had to vent it, and they put the crew into the—there’s some reason that instead of staying in their suits in the command module, they put them in the lunar module while they did this.\n\nSo they said, “You know, we can power it up and go do that,” and went through a discussion about whether we should or not and how long it would take. There’s this little corner of the room where the flight director console is, is where there’s always this crowd standing around talking, and so now that crowd is getting to be pretty large, and everybody has got an opinion.\n\nThey said, “Well, okay. Doesn’t look like there’s any harm in doing it. Go ahead and start them on that.” I think Jim asked something about how long it would take. The procedure for powering up the lunar module, the way we normally did it was complex. It took three or four hours, something like that.\n\nFreddo is one of these people that could do anything by rote, and all you had to do was say, “Freddo, do LM lifeboat,” and he’s gone, and it’s done. He would scare me at times; he would throw switches without thinking about it. But this time it was really the right thing to do. So they ended up doing that.\n\nIt was important that they get in there in a hurry because the command module only had limited batteries for reentry, and you really didn’t want to drain those batteries. So you wanted to remove the requirement for electrical power from the command module as fast as you could, assuming you’re going to come home. One of the many lessons out of all this is starting on day one it was from the very first moment, assume you’re going to succeed and don’t do anything that gets in the way.\n\nSo, preserving the command module batteries became a religion, because they need that to get back in. There’s no batteries in the service module. You just have a fuel cell, so when that’s gone, it’s gone. We had to get it shut down before we get into the batteries.\n\nSo Jack’s job in the CSM was to get that done, and it was Fred’s job to get the lunar module up fast enough to beat the decay of fuel cells. So that process is going on.\n\nThen we got into a discussion of, “Well, we don’t need to do the whole procedure.” We got into a debate about this inertial reference we call the IMU [inertial measurement unit]. It’s just the device, the platform that you navigate with it. It maintains a reference that lets you know where the whole universe is in terms of attitude so you can find stars and planets and stuff. Each spacecraft has one of these.\n\nThe one in the lunar module, the platforms were the same, but the way you aligned it in the command module is, there was special thing we called a sextant. It was just a telescope in the side of the spacecraft, and you could steer it around and aim it at stars and take marks on it, and the computer would say, okay, you’re pointing here, and it would align the platform.\n\nIn the lunar module you had the same problem except they didn’t have a telescope, they had this spiral thing up on the top. You look out, and you took marks in there because you didn’t rotate a telescope and measure where it’s pointing; you looked through a spiral grid and put the star there, and then you read out the coordinates. It had a little cursor so you could lay it over and say it’s this number of degrees and it’s that far out, and you marked that down and put it in computer. You did that on a number of stars. That would give you the line of sight to the stars so you could align a platform.\n\nDoing that through that optical device, that was one of the things that at least in the simulator took a lot of training to get to do. Freddo and I used to go over and play with it and try to find some simpler way of doing it. We really didn’t come up with anything that was very clever.\n\nNormally you make the transfer by reading the angle. The two spacecraft are tied together at the nose, so if you know the attitudes of what’s in the command module, you therefore know what the physical alignment is so you can tell the platform and the lunar module how to position itself to replicate this. They’re in different engineering coordinate systems, so you had to write down all the numbers in the command module, put them on a list, and then do some math, and then punch the numbers into the lunar module computer.\n\nBut if you held the spacecraft steady when you did this, why, you could get a very good alignment so that now you could go in with the lunar module and make a little tweak to tighten up the alignment. But you didn’t have to go through this. One of the beauties is when you look out at all these stars, you know, they go to great lengths to that teach you how to recognize constellations so you could find this star.\n\nWhat they don’t teach you, all planetariums and things are showing you the sky the way you and I see it from the Earth. What they don’t tell you, when you get out in space, that all those black spots in between the stars are filled with stars, and those constellations are nowhere near as obvious as they were. If it was an obscure constellation in a planetarium, you can bet it’s hopeless out there in the real world.\n\nSo since you couldn’t always be sure, these obscure stars that were picked because they gave us the right technical geometry, they were in the right part of the sky, they were good for navigation, but really a bear if you had to figure—but if you could tell your computer to point at that star, and then you look and there’s a star and it’s not right on, but it’s not very far off and there’s only one star there, you can be pretty sure that that’s it, and all you’re doing is being a vernier adjustment, even though you couldn’t recognize that star from Adam’s house cat.\n\nThere are a lot of technical reasons why we got into this. Our optics just weren’t that good. But this technique really worked well, and so if I can get the platform in the lunar module close, then you could take it up and say “Point at this,” and then even though I really couldn’t see what that star was, you could then tweak it up.\n\nSo we said, “We’re ready to do that,” and then somebody, they said, “No, it’s going to take electrical power,” and by then the guys doing the trajectory calculations, [Jerry C.] Bostick and company, had already determined that “Here’s how many hours it takes to do things.” The guys in the lunar module electrical system had calculated how much time we had, and the two numbers didn’t match. So bringing on this platform is probably the biggest energy user in the spacecraft. Didn’t want to do it. I remember very emotional voices about “You’ve got to do it.” “You can’t afford to do it.”\n\nFinally somebody mentioned that Jim said there’s millions of stars out there with this stuff that was coming out. So with that, we were able to persuade Deke and Glynn that “If you don’t get this platform aligned now, before the command module dies, next chance you’re going to have to align it is when you’re behind the Moon, and that’s just not a good risk. Do it now, and then we’ll buy time, and we can think about it. If you don’t need it, you can turn it off.”\n\nBut they went back to the idea that, “Well, we certainly need to have the ability to maneuver the spacecraft accurately to come home, and we probably ought to do that before we worry about how long it takes.” So we brought up the platform the way—all this was done and within, what, an hour, hour and a half, a little more. Freddo had the lunar module completely up and running, and Jack was secured. I think we nicked the command module batteries just a tad, shut down.\n\nSo now they had overcome one of the big things. They had a capability to maneuver, and they knew where they were, and now they could figure out what to do. Went through a big debate about what to do next, as I recall, the books and the movies and all don’t really capture. That debate of what to do next was also rather charged because there was one group of people that said, “You know, this has really been a bad day. We don’t know the condition of any piece of hardware we’ve got. We don’t want to do anything. Don’t touch anything. Let’s just figure this out.”\n\nThere’s others that said, “There’s only this much electricity and water in the lunar module. We need to turn around and come home as fast as possible. It looks like we could do this, but to get back before the batteries run out, we will have to either jettison the service module and get rid of it to make the vehicle light enough or we’ll have to burn the [CSM’s SPS (service propulsion system)] engine.”\n\nWell, you can’t burn the [SPS] engine because we had no electrical control. We could jettison the module, but now that we’ve figured out that something explosive occurred, we don’t really know whether the heat shield is intact, and we don’t know anything about the thermal environment on the command module when you take the service module off for a day or two. So we went through this big debate. I have no recollection about who made the choices. There were a lot of people involved in this.\n\nBy then we had done the other clever thing of having Kranz took his team to the deck below to work problems. Gene and—who was the other flight director? I guess Jerry, I think. And [Milton L.] Windler may have had a shift. I don’t remember. But the four teams, so three of them were going to work the real-time stuff and Gene was going to take his team and go do all of the troubleshooting to solve the problems.\n\nSo they came up with the strategy in one of back rooms that we would maneuver—the flight path we were on initially was what they call a non-free return. To get to the landing site, you had to have a trajectory that said if you did nothing more and went around the Moon, you would not hit the entry corridor back at Earth without making another maneuver.\n\nThe first burn we made after bringing the lunar module up was a very small one designed just to put us on this free return. They said, whatever we do after this, you’re going to reenter the atmosphere on the Earth. That trajectory went out and went around the Moon and came back and entered the Earth’s atmosphere in the Atlantic. Recovery forces are out in the Pacific, but, you know, it’s home. It’s kind of a good place to be.\n\nSo they worked this problem, and they decided that what they would do, after a lot of this debate, they would go around the Moon. As soon as they came out from the back side of the Moon, they would do this maneuver which would move their trajectory just enough so that they were on a landing in the Pacific near the recovery forces. As I recall, it speeded up the return trip by a matter of a couple of hours. It really didn’t matter.\n\nSo the question"
