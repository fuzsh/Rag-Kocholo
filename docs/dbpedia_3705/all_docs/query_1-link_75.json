        "text": "PHENIX CITY, Ala. (WTVM) - According to officials, Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge, Honorable Brooke E. Reid ruled in favor of the City of Phenix City against Russell County in a dispute over the distribution of gasoline tax proceeds.\n\n“We want want anything less or anything more than what the law asks for,” said Chan Gamble, Assistant City manager and attorney for Phenix City, in reference to an Alabama law dating back to 1967. “Two years later, the legislature enacted a local act that Russell County to distribute an additional 10 percent of the fuel tax revenue received to Phenix City and Hurtsboro.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed In 2018 when Russell County stopped paying gasoline tax proceeds to the City of Phenix City, violating a local act of the legislature enacted in 1968.\n\nThe reason given was that a subsequent law had repealed the Local Act. Phenix City took legal action and argued that the legislature never repealed the Local Act. Phenix City argued that Russell County had no right to withhold funds from Phenix City.\n\n“It’s been very wasteful, everything immediately goes to attorney fees, right, how much did it cost to prosecute the case, but that’s a very small part of what it actually costs citizens of Russell County,” said Gamble.\n\nJudge Reid was appointed to hear a case as all local judges recused, or excused, themselves.\n\nThe court issued a 10-page order on January 10, 2024. Judge Reid ruled that Russell County must pay Phenix City gasoline revenue as per Local Act 1968-859. She ordered that Russell County immediately resume paying the gasoline tax and set a hearing to determine the arrears owed to Phenix City.\n\n“This means that Phenix City will have the money that is rightfully due to maintain all the streets and roads used not just by citizens of Phenix City, but Russell County too,” said Gamble. “It shows and lets them know that their commissioners are going to follow the law, they can’t chose and decide which ones they would like to adhere to.\n\nPhenix City’s lawyer, Chan Gamble, argued the case. James McKoon, one of the City’s attorneys, called the result a “huge win”, adding that the City originally implemented the tax to fund road maintenance and construction due to its large population and heavy traffic. He said hopefully, Russell County has set aside money for the arrears, as it could owe as much as 2 million dollars.\n\n“We’re going to continue to work with them and try to do the best we can because we work for Russell County everyday. Everything that’s here, every rooftop that’s here is in the county of Russell. I wish people had a better understanding of that because this was very senseless,” said Wallace Hunter, City Manager for Phenix City.\n\nRussell County Commission Chairman Rod Castello tells WTVM, “the county disagrees with the court’s order and is reviewing the decision to figure out what legal routes they can take.”"
