        "text": "(photo courtesy of Luis Lopez Descartes)\n\nFor just the second time with its current lineup, Death in the Park will perform in Birmingham. The show is Friday at BottleTree Cafe. Doors open at 8 p.m. for the 9 p.m. set. Glories and Fistful of Beard will open. Tickets are available at BottleTree's website or at the door for $8.\n\nI had an opportunity to speak with Death in the Park lead singer, Andy Jackson, during recent rehearsals for the show. This is only the most recent of Jackson's projects, a long career that includes time spent with Hot Rod Circuit and Terrible Things.\n\nBlake Ells: You're a Montgomery native and you've lived in Birmingham for a while, but you haven't performed here very often with any of your projects. Why?\n\nAndy Jackson: Simply because of the routing of our tours. And when we have come here, the shows were never very big. While we have done very well in other places, we have never had a big following here.\n\nBE: How did Death in the Park begin?\n\nAJ: It was the end of 2007. I was in Australia with Hot Rod Circuit. Casey was leaving the band and we had just decided we were all going to do something else. At the time, I was listening to a lot of Archers of Loaf. I had 3 or 4 band names that I always wanted to use, and when we came together with this project, that (Archers of Loaf) song title was the one we used.\n\nBE: You just spent some time on the road with Hot Rod Circuit for a brief reunion tour. How did it go?\n\nAJ: It was amazing. We did a couple of west coast dates and a lot on the east coast: L.A., Chicago, Cleveland, Philly, New York and Boston. The east coast shows were all sold out or close. It was very unexpected.\n\nBE: Is that something you will do again?\n\nAJ: It's possible. If we get asked to do a festival show, we'd do it. Hot Rod will play together again, but it's nothing that is set in stone.\n\nBE: Do you think you guys will record together again?\n\nAJ: We talked about getting together for a few weeks and jamming just to see what we may come up with. The 7-inch (limited release sold on tour and online, also made available at select Hot Topic stores) was pretty much just recorded online. We'd probably get together and do another full record though, yeah.\n\nBE: How was that release received?\n\nAJ: Pretty much everything that was printed was sold. It included \"Sucked Out\" (Superdrag cover) and the first new material we have recorded since 2007. It's still available on iTunes and Run For Cover's site.\n\nBE: Have you discussed re-releasing older Hot Rod Circuit material on vinyl?\n\nAJ: We've been talking to some labels. I think Run For Cover is going to reissue The Underground is a Dying Breed. The previous albums are out there on vinyl. Somewhere.\n\nBE: Death in the Park's debut record featured an appearance by Paramore's Hayley Williams (\"Fallen\"). How did that collaboration come about?\n\nAJ: When I was on that tour with Hot Rod in Australia, Paramore was touring with us. I had recorded Hayley for a Say Anything record. That's how we became friends. On the tour, she would come out and sing on Hot Rod songs and I would go out and sing on Paramore songs. Our guitar player worked as Paramore's front of house guy. He shared the song with her and she liked it. Paramore actually played it at soundcheck one night. We recorded it and sent it to Hayley and that's when she put the words on the track.\n\nBE: When did you decide to bring Rachael Fitzgerald (keyboards) on as a full-time member of the band?\n\nAJ: We had run keyboard tracks for most of the shows because I just didn't know a keyboard player. I had known Rachael a while, but I never knew what a great keyboard player she was. I heard her playing one day and found out - that's when I asked her to join us.\n\nBE: Can we expect a follow-up record soon?\n\nAJ: Yes. We don't really have a time frame, but we've been working on songs for a long time. It'll be out before summer. I've talked to a couple of labels. I hope to do it with Run For Cover.\n\nBE: How do you feel about the Birmingham scene?\n\nAJ: I haven't gotten a chance to know it as well as I should. I've been to a lot of shows, and I think some of them could be a lot bigger. There is a lot of talent out there.\n\nBE: Do you think you guys will do a full tour?\n\nAJ: I don't see it happening soon. Right now, the focus is on the record and doing some local and regional shows.\n\nBE: You're working with a lot of emerging acts, producing records from your home studio here in Birmingham. Tell me more about some of those projects.\n\nAJ: The latest thing I did was with a couple of guys that left the band Versa Emerge. They call the new act Birthday Party - from Orlando. They recorded it there, and I mixed it here. Bobby Kyser has a new project he's recording with me as Magna Carter. It's a solo record, but it has a Beach Boys meets Wilco type of vibe. That's a work in progress. We're hoping to wrap it up by the end of the month.\n\nBE: What are your top five American rock bands of all-time?"
