Not sure of the exact location.\n\n2012 Turkey Rod Run Thanks to Bill Skirvin for some excellent photos from the 2012 Turkey Rod Run at the Daytona International Speedway. For 39 years the Turkey Run has been brought to you by volunteers from the Daytona Beach Street Rods and is still going strong.\n\nMoonshine Festival his show is definitely one of my favorites and my kids come up to Georgia every year so us menfolk can go to this show. Dawsonville, GA is the original home of Bill Elliott, the moonshiners heritage that became NASCAR, and the infamous Dawsonville pool hall. The town is packed with old stock cars and drivers from the greatest era of stock cars. Don't miss this show.\n\nThe Infamous 2012 Rodfather Tour Thanks to Kirk Jones and the Goodguys Organization, for the photos from the Rodfather Tour across America that was a tribute to Andy ''Rodfather'' Brizio. Andy and his roadster have been a fixture at Goodguy events across the country, and spanning many years.

Thousands of books, magazines, newspapers and photos. Cars and engines and many models. Spectacular examples of Hot rodding in it's early days. We owe a debt of gratitude to ''Speedy Bill' Smith from preserving our history.\n\nTexas Stuff Another stop in Texas to look at some vintage tin, a term coined by ''Tex'' Snith in the early days.\n\nPrice Museum Price Museum of Speed features a rare display of the greatest representations of early racing history. Many of these rare vintage race cars either won or placed well in numerous renowned events such as the Grand Prix, Le Mans, Morris Park, Briarcliff Cup, Daytona Beach, Gordon Bennett Cup, Empire Track at Yonkers, Sheepshead Bay, Indianapolis, Mille Miglia among others. Also in the collection are other marquee automobiles representing different periods of history.\n\nRichard Munz Collection Richard and his partner Jim Busby, have assembled RVM Classics in downtown Madison.\n\nThe building has been superbly restored by Richard. In the \"day\" it functioned as a Taxicab company. It is a concrete building two stories tall, plus the basement. There are circular ramps that allow cars to be driven both up and down from the main level.\n\nAs you enter, it is evident that Richard is a detail-oriented person. The ambience is perfect. There are many displays and they are well thought out and organized. There is artwork and significant photos everywhere.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright and airy. Music from a player-piano provided a great background.\n\nMore 2012 events below.\n\nWinfield_Watson Meet Thanks to Doug Hayes for coverage of the annual Larry Watson-Gene Winfield gathering of the legends. Everyone was aware of the absence of Larry Watson who passed last year. This event is on my bucket list for sure.\n\nGeorge Poteets annual BBQ Bash Thanks to Richard Ramsey For the photos from the George Poteet BBQ. It was a very cool event.

A great day full of fun and some great flathead cars.\n\nLocal College rod run in Cleveland, Ga. An annual small show at Truett-McConnell College in Cleveland, GA.

From all reports, it was an overwhelming success.\n\nShades of the Past Thanks to GAtor on the HAMB forum for the photo coverage.

During the show (and the days before & after) the parkway will turn into a parade of rods, customs, and classic cars with people sitting in lawn chairs all down the strip. You could literally walk from one end of Pigeon Forge to the other faster than you could drive through all of the traffic.\n\nFrog Follies Thanks to Joe and Julie Bandor for the coverage. Since 1975, each August the E'ville Iron Street Rod Club has put on a rod run for street rod owners. It is held at the Vanderburgh County 4-H Center in Evansville Indiana. At the first event we had 44 registered street rods. Since that time the Frog Follies has grown to average over 4000 street rods each year. The event became known as the Frog Follies after the club had a bull frog race at the first event. We've had entries from Alaska, Australia, Canada, and all 48 continental states over the years. Since 2010 we can boast that the Frog Follies \"is THE largest PRE 49 Street Rod event anywhere in the world!\"\n\nLead East 2012 Thanks to Allen Witman for the photos. Welcome to LEAD EAST 2012, an Oldies Music and Old Car Weekend unlike any event held anywhere. This is the 30th year for this cherished event. LEAD EAST is a giant 50's PARTY, offering more unique events than 15 normal car shows added together. It is a conglomeration of dozens of groups of people who come together every year, set up their pop-up tents and BBQs next to one another and kick back to wallow in the good vibrations that permeate the area for this magic, nostalgic weekend.\n\nThe H.A.M.B. Drags! Thanks to Nick Hoesing, Malcolmm on the HAMB. It started in the 1950's when just enough of a corn field was cleared in Asbury, Missouri for a strip of concrete, a timing booth, and some parking. As the track grew through the decades, little actually changed. Today, MoKan Dragway is almost a spitting image of the track that was built in the golden era.\n\nIt's this very track where they make history every year. Early style dragsters, gassers, rails, bikes, and stock cars, hot rods, sports cars, roadsters, coupes, all roar down the quarter mile in a setting that hasn't been duplicated since the late 50's. These traditional hot rods and race cars along with the passionate people that build and maintain them join forces to create the event they call the H.A.M.B. Drags!\n\nBonneville Speed Week 2012 The Southern California Timing Association has held speed trials on the salt flats since the thirties and this is coverage from Doug Hayes. Doug, besides being a great photographer, was once mayor of Sierra Madre, California. Doug has been involved in cars, hotrods, and especially drag racing. During the years he was a professional photographer, he filmed many of the early dragstrips.\n\nBonneville Sunday Doug was up early to capture more great sunrise shots.
