        "text": "Drag racing's fast start\n\nBorn on the backroads of America in the post-World War II years, drag racing's roots were planted on dry lake beds like Muroc in California's Mojave Desert, where hot rodders had congregated since the early 1930s and speeds first topped 100 mph.\n\nOne could even argue that drag racing was born in Goltry, Okla., in 1913, with the birth of Wally Parks, who nearly four decades later would found drag racing's most successful and influential sanctioning body.\n\nParks' family moved to California in the early 1920s, and Parks had an early interest in cars. He attended his first dry lake speed trials event in the 1930s, which whetted his fascination for performance. In 1937, Parks was one of the founders of the Road Runners Club.\n\nOrganized drag racing\n\nIn 1947, Parks, a military tank test-driver for General Motors who served in the army in the South Pacific in World War II, helped organize the Southern California Timing Association and later became its general manager.\n\nThe first SCTA \"Speed Week,\" held at the famed Bonneville Salt Flats in 1949, was the result of a diligent effort of Parks, then its executive secretary. It was here that racers first began running \"against the clock\" - actually, a stopwatch - coaxing their vehicles to accelerate quicker rather than simply to attain high top speeds.\n\nThe first dragstrip, the Santa Ana Drags, began running on an airfield in Southern California in 1950 and quickly gained popularity among the Muroc crowd because of its revolutionary computerized speed clocks.\n\nWhen Parks became editor of the monthly enthusiast magazine Hot Rod, he had the forum and the power to form the National Hot Rod Association in 1951 to \"create order from chaos\" by instituting safety rules and performance standards that helped legitimize the sport. He was its first president.\n\nWally Parks"
