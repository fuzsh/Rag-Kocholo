        "text": "Punk veterans Midtown have released their new EP, We’re Too Old To Write New Songs, So Here’s Some Old Songs We Didn’t Write. Featuring tributes to songs that influenced the band in the past, including Pavement’s “Cut Your Hair”, Lagwagon’s “Know It All”, and Elvis Costello’s “Pump It Up”, the EP is rounded out by the band’s take on “Safely”, originally by Hot Rod Circuit, which has just been released.\n\nMidtown will also be performing this Sunday, May 28 at Adjacent Festival in Atlantic City, NJ.\n\nThe band shares:\n\nThe point of this EP was to both share some of the artists that influenced and inspired us as a band and also to introduce people to artists they may not have heard of.\n\nEmo-Punk trailblazers Midtown went on a sold out headlining tour last year, and played a string of arena dates opening for old friends My Chemical Romance. Now Midtown presents its first new recordings in almost two decades.\n\nThe new EP was born in rehearsals for those shows last year, the band says.\n\nVocalist-guitarist Tyler Rann explains:\n\nYou have kids, you see the world through their eyes; you start to get older …and you wonder if you can get back to the place you were when you first wrote these songs.\n\nThe band ultimately decided that sharing these renditions of songs that inspired them would be the best next thing.\n\nUpcoming Tour Dates:\n\n5/28 – Atlantic City, NJ @ Adjacent Festival"
