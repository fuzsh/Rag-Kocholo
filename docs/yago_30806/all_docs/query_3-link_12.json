        "text": "Sweet, sweeter, sweetest. No combination of terms better describes the screen persona of lovely Loretta Young. A&E's Biography (1987) has stated that Young \"remains a symbol of beauty, serenity, and grace. But behind the glamour and stardom is a woman of substance whose true beauty lies in her dedication to her family, her faith, and her quest to live life with a purpose.\"\n\nLoretta Young was born Gretchen Young in Salt Lake City, Utah on January 6, 1913, to Gladys (Royal) and John Earle Young. Her parents separated when Loretta was three years old. Her mother moved Loretta and her two older sisters to Southern California, where Mrs. Young ran a boarding house. When Loretta was 10, her mother married one of her boarders, George Belzer. They had a daughter, Georgianna, two years later.\n\nLoretta was appearing on screen as a child extra by the time she was four, joining her elder sisters, Polly Ann Young and Elizabeth Jane Young (later better known as Sally Blane), as child players. Mrs. Young's brother-in-law was an assistant director and got young Loretta a small role in the film The Only Way (1914). The role consisted of nothing more than a small, weeping child lying on an operating table. Later that year, she appeared in another small role, in The Primrose Ring (1917). The film starred Mae Murray, who was so taken with little Loretta that she offered to adopt her. Loretta lived with the Murrays for about a year and a half. In 1921, she had a brief scene in Der Scheich (1921).\n\nLoretta and her sisters attended parochial schools, after which they helped their mother run the boarding house. In 1927, Loretta returned to films in a small part in Susannes erstes Abenteuer (1927). Even at the age of fourteen, she was an ambitious actress. Changing her name to Loretta Young, letting her blond hair revert to its natural brown and with her green eyes, satin complexion and exquisite face, she quickly graduated from ingenue to leading lady. Beginning with her role as Denise Laverne in Ihr gro√üer Flirt (1928), she shaped any character she took on with total dedication. In 1928, she received second billing in The Head Man (1928) and continued to toil in many roles throughout the '20s and '30s, making anywhere from six to nine films a year. Her two sisters were also actresses but were not as successful as Loretta, whose natural beauty was her distinct advantage.\n\nThe 17-year-old Young made headlines in 1930 when she and Grant Withers, who was previously married and nine years her senior, eloped to Yuma, Arizona. They had both appeared in Warner Bros.' The Second Floor Mystery (1930). The marriage was annulled in 1931, the same year in which the pair would again co-star on screen in a film ironically titled Too Young to Marry (1931). By the mid-'30s, Loretta left First National Studios for rival Fox, where she had previously worked on a loan-out basis, and became one of the premier leading ladies of Hollywood.\n\nIn 1935, she made Goldfieber (1935) with Clark Gable and it was thought they had an affair where Loretta got pregnant thereafter. Because of the strict morality clauses in their contracts - and the fact that Clark Gable was married - they could not tell anybody except Loretta's mother. Loretta and her mother left for Europe after filming on The Crusades finished. They returned in August 1935 to the United States, at which time Gladys Belzer announced Loretta's 'illness' to the press. Filming on Loretta's next film, Ramona, was also cancelled. During this time, Loretta was living in a small house in Venice, California, her mother rented. On November 6, 1935, Loretta delivered a healthy baby girl whom she named Judith. It wasn't until the 1990s when she was watching Larry King Live where she first heard the word 'date rape' and upon finding out exactly what it was, professed to her friend and biographer Edward Funk and her daughter-in-law Linda Lewis, that she had gone through the same with Clark Gable. \"That's what happened between me and Clark.\"\n\nIn 1938, Loretta starred as Sally Goodwin in Die goldene Peitsche (1938), an outstanding success. Her co-star Walter Brennan won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Peter Goodwin.\n\nIn 1940, Loretta married businessman Tom Lewis, and from then on her child was called Judy Lewis, although Tom Lewis never adopted her. Judy was brought up thinking that both parents had adopted her and did not know, until years later, that she was actually the biological daughter of Loretta and Clark Gable. Four years after her marriage to Tom Lewis, Loretta had a son, Christopher Lewis, and later another son, Peter Charles.\n\nIn the 1940s, Loretta was still one of the most beautiful ladies in Hollywood. She reached the pinnacle of her career when she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in Die Farmerstochter (1947), the tale of a farm girl who rises through the ranks and becomes a congresswoman. It was a smash and today is her best remembered film. The same year, she starred in the delightful fantasy Jede Frau braucht einen Engel (1947) with David Niven and Cary Grant. It was another box office success and continues to be a TV staple during the holiday season. In 1949, Loretta starred in the well-received film, Mother Is a Freshman (1949) with Van Johnson and Rudy Vallee and ...und der Himmel lacht dazu (1949). The latter garnered Loretta her second Oscar nomination, but she lost to Olivia de Havilland in Die Erbin (1949). In 1953, Loretta made It Happens Every Thursday (1953), which was to be her final big screen role.\n\nShe retired from films in 1953 and began a second, equally successful career as hostess of Ihr Star: Loretta Young (1953), a half-hour television drama anthology series which ran on NBC from September 1953 to September 1961. In addition to hosting the series, she frequently starred in episodes. Although she is most remembered for her stunning gowns and swirling entrances, over the broadcast's eight-year run she also showed again that she could act. She won Emmy awards for best actress in a dramatic series in 1954, 1956 and 1958.\n\nAfter the show ended, she took some time off before returning in 1962 with The New Loretta Young Show (1962), which was not so successful, lasting only one season. For the next 24 years, Loretta did not appear in any entertainment medium. Her final performance was in a made for TV film Spinne im Netz (1989).\n\nBy 1960, Loretta was a grandmother. Her daughter Judy Lewis had married about three years before and had a daughter in 1959, whom they named Maria. Loretta and Tom Lewis divorced in the early 1960s. Loretta enjoyed retirement, sleeping late, visiting her son Chris and daughter-in-law Linda, and traveling. She and her friend Josephine Alicia Saenz, ex-wife of John Wayne, traveled to India and saw the Taj Mahal. In 1990, she became a great-grandmother when granddaughter Maria, daughter of Judy Lewis, gave birth to a boy.\n\nLoretta lived a quiet retirement in Palm Springs, California until her death on August 12, 2000 from ovarian cancer at the home of her sister Georgiana and Georgiana's husband, Ricardo Montalban.\n\nGorgeous was too tame a word for this foreigner stunner. Glamorous brunette beauty Ursula Thiess was born Ursula Schmidt in Hamburg, Germany on May 15, 1924, the daughter of Hans Schmidt, who managed a printing company, and Wilhelmine Lange, her turbulent childhood including working as compulsory farm laborer on the orders of the Nazi government when the teen refused to join the paramilitary Hitler Youth Movement. She later began her entertainment career in her native homeland appearing on the stage and dubbing female voices in American films.\n\nMarried to director Georg Thie√ü, the couple's marriage was a relatively unhappy one and they eventually divorced. With two children (Manuela and Michael) in tow, she found work in the late 1940s/early 1950s as a fashion model in Berlin. She left postwar Germany at the urging of Howard Hughes and signed up with his RKO company for film representation.\n\nBilled as \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" during her initial build-up, her debut movie was as a mixed-race English/Indian girl in the outdoor drama Monsun (1952) opposite the handsome, frequently bare-chested George Nader. While she failed to weave the same kind of foreign magic as that of Marlene Dietrich, she was far more beautiful and was voted \"Most Promising Star of 1952\" by Modern Screen Magazine and a Golden Globe the next year. This exotic temptation remained a fetching distraction amid the rugged scenery where, percentage-wise, the story and action remained strongly focused on her handsome he-man co-stars: Robert Stack in Der Ku√ü und das Schwert (1954); Rock Hudson in Gewehre f√ºr Bengali (1954); and Glenn Ford in Americano (1955); Robert Mitchum in Bandido! (1956), among others. Her Hollywood career wound up very short but sweet.\n\nDuring her brief peak, Ursula met and eventually married the exceedingly handsome film star Robert Taylor (in 1954) and she subsequently abandoned her film career. Outside of her two children by her first marriage, Ursula had two more children (Terrance in 1955 and Tessa in 1959), by Taylor. Though she seemed quite content to be out of the limelight, she did appear with some regularity on her husband's TV series Kein Fall f√ºr FBI (1959) during its first season, playing a police reporter who has a brief affair with Taylor's character. While raising her children was her prime job, she also became an active volunteer at a children's hospital.\n\nFollowing her son Michael's tragic suicide from a drug overdose and husband Taylor's death shortly thereafter from lung cancer, both in 1969, Ursula was glimpsed here and there in a light sprinkling of film and TV appearances before bowing out completely. .\n\nSurviving an operation for a benign brain tumor in 1979, the former actress married wealthily for a third time and lived in Hawaii during part of that marriage, but would find herself widowed again in 1987 after 12 years. Known to be an excellent home decorator and gourmet cook, she eventually wrote an autobiography entitled \"But I Have Promises to Keep\" in 2003. Living in the Los Angeles area for the remainder of her life, she eventually entered an assisted facility in Burbank and died on June 19, 2010, at the age of 86, survived by her three remaining children.\n\nOne of Hollywood's more talented and watchable stars on screen was sullen and thin 50s actress Jan Sterling who didn't quite reach the top echelon of stardom but certainly ensured audiences of a real good time with her sexy pout and flashy style in soaps, film noir and saucy comedy.\n\nJan was born Jane Sterling Adriance in Manhattan in 1921 to a well-to-do family. Her father was a prominent advertising executive who divorced her mother when the girl was only eight years old. Her mother remarried (to an oilman) when Jan was still a youngster and the family relocated abroad where Jan was schooled by private tutors in Brazil, then later in London and Paris.\n\nAlthough both sets of parents disapproved, Jan, who by this time possessed a strong British accent, set her sites on acting and was eventually enrolled in Fay Compton's dramatic school in London. A strong-minded young lady with a heartfelt passion for the arts, she returned to Manhattan to conquer Broadway and by the age of 17 had found her first ing√©nue role in \"Bachelor Born,\" playing (naturally) a young British lady. Over the next 11 years, Jan dominated Broadway as proper British ladies while billing herself as \"Jane Adrian.\"\n\nOne of her highlights was working with the legendary Ruth Gordon in 1942 in Gordon's first play entitled \"Over 21.\" As Billie Dawn in the Chicago company of \"Born Yesterday,\" Jan bowled over the critics and seemed almost a shoo-in to do the 1950 film version but she lost out in the end to Judy Holliday. The ash-blonde broke quickly into films supporting Oscar-winning Jane Wyman in Schweigende Lippen (1948) in a key, emotional role.\n\nTo her absolute delight, she left the docile, ladylike image behind her and was allowed to dig her nails into a florid array of cheap floozies, hard-bitten dames, and lethal schemers and stood out well with 'bad girl' parts in the films Frauengef√§ngnis (1950), Reporter des Satans (1951), Sein gro√üer Kampf (1952), Immer jagte er Blondinen (1954), and Das Haus am Strand (1955). In between she occasionally made a nicer, or at least a more sympathetic, impression in the movies Sky Full of Moon (1952) and Es wird immer wieder Tag (1954), the latter earning her an Oscar nomination.\n\nMarried to and divorced from actor John Merivale in the 1940s, Jan later married gruff film star Paul Douglas in 1950. The couple moved away from the Hollywood scene in Burlington, Vermont. The couple appeared together professionally on occasional TV shows and Douglas revived his \"Born Yesterday\" Harry Brock role with a stage tour starring Jan in the Billie Dawn part. It and they were a solid hit.\n\nJan's career slowed down considerably after the sudden death of her 52-year-old second husband in 1959. He suffered a massive heart attack at their Hollywood home. She refocused on stage and TV but at a slower step. Incidental filming occurred on occasion, including support roles in Blond, s√º√ü und sehr naiv (1961) and Incident ... und sie kannten kein Erbarmen (1967). She also involved herself in humanitarian causes. In the late 1960s she moved to London, England and in the 1970s, she entered into a strong personal relationship with actor Sam Wanamaker. An isolated film role came her way with a small part in Am ersten Montag im Oktober (1981). They never married but stayed together until his death in 1993.\n\nInactive for nearly two decades, Jan made an appearance at the Cinecon Film Festival in Los Angeles in the fall of 2001, still charming audiences at the age of 80. On 26 March 2004, she passed away at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. She was 82.\n\nLauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske on September 16, 1924, in New York City. She was the daughter of Natalie Weinstein-Bacal, a Romanian Jewish immigrant, and William Perske, who was born in New Jersey, to Polish Jewish parents. Her family was middle-class, with her father working as a salesman and her mother as a secretary. They divorced when she was five and she rarely saw her father after that.\n\nAs a school girl, she originally wanted to be a dancer, but later switched gears to head into acting. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, after attending She was educated at Highland Manor, a private boarding school in Tarrytown, New York (through the generosity of wealthy uncles), and then at Julia Richman High School, which enabled her to get her feet wet in some off-Broadway productions.\n\nOut of school, she entered modeling and, because of her beauty, appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar, one of the most popular magazines in the US. The wife of famed director Howard Hawks spotted the picture in the publication and arranged with her husband to have Lauren take a screen test. As a result, which was entirely positive, she was given the part of Marie Browning in Haben und Nichthaben (1944), a thriller opposite Humphrey Bogart, when she was just 19 years old. This not only set the tone for a fabulous career but also one of Hollywood's greatest love stories (she married Bogart in 1945). It was also the first of several Bogie-Bacall films.\n\nAfter 1945's Jagd im Nebel (1945), Lauren received second billing in Tote schlafen fest (1946) with Bogart. The mystery, in the role of Vivian Sternwood Rutledge, was a resounding success. Although she was making one film a year, each production would be eagerly awaited by the public. In 1947, again with her husband, Lauren starred in the thriller Die schwarze Natter (1947). The film kept movie patrons on the edge of their seats. The following year, she starred with Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore in Gangster in Key Largo (1948). The crime drama was even more of a nail biter than her previous film.\n\nIn 1950, Lauren starred in Zwischen zwei Frauen (1950), a drama set in 1894. It was a film of note because she appeared without her husband - her co-star was Gary Cooper. In 1953, Lauren appeared in her first comedy as Schatze Page in Wie angelt man sich einen Million√§r (1953). The film, with co-stars Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, was a smash hit all across the theaters of America.\n\nAfter filming Warum hab' ich ja gesagt? (1957), which was released in 1957, Humphrey Bogart died on January 14 from throat cancer. Devastated at being a widow, Lauren returned to the silver screen with Das Geschenk der Liebe (1958) in 1958 opposite Robert Stack. The production turned out to be a big disappointment. Undaunted, Lauren moved back to New York City and appeared in several Broadway plays to huge critical acclaim. She was enjoying acting before live audiences and the audiences in turn enjoyed her fine performances.\n\nLauren was away from the big screen for five years, but she returned in 1964 to appear in Der M√∂rder mit der Gartenschere (1964) and ...und ledige M√§dchen (1964). The latter film was a comedy starring Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis. In 1966, Lauren starred in Ein Fall f√ºr Harper (1966) with Paul Newman and Julie Harris, which was one of former's signature films.\n\nAlternating her time between films and the stage, Lauren returned in 1974's Mord im Orient-Express (1974). The film, based on Agatha Christie's best-selling book was a huge hit. It also garnered Ingrid Bergman her third Oscar. Actually, the huge star-studded cast helped to ensure its success. Two years later, in 1976, Lauren co-starred with John Wayne in Der Scharfsch√ºtze (1976). The film was Wayne's last - he died from cancer in 1979. In late 1979, Lauren appeared with her good friend, James Garner, in a double episode, Lions, Tigers, Monkeys and Dogs (1979), of his Rockford Files series.\n\nFor Lauren's next film role, she appeared in a large ensemble film, Der Gesundheits-Kongre√ü (1980), which again paired her with James Garner, and in 1981, she played an actress being stalked by a crazed admirer in Der Fanatiker (1981). The thriller was absolutely fascinating with Lauren in the lead role, again playing opposite her good friend James Garner, making three straight screen roles with Lauren opposite James Garner. After that production, Lauren was away from films again, this time for seven years. In the interim, she again appeared on the stages of Broadway. When she returned, it was for the filming of 1988's Rendezvous mit einer Leiche (1988) and Mr. North - Liebling der G√∂tter (1988). After 1990's Misery (1990) and several made for television films, Lauren appeared in 1996's Ein Pr√§sident f√ºr alle F√§lle (1996), a comedy romp with Jack Lemmon and James Garner as two ex-presidents and their escapades. In 1997, Lauren appeared in Liebe hat zwei Gesichter (1996), in one of the best roles of her later career, opposite Barbra Streisand, where Lauren was nominated as Best Actress in a Supporting Role by both the Academy and the Golden Globes, winning the Golden Globe for the role.\n\nDespite her age and failing health, she made a small-scale comeback in the English-language dub of Hayao Miyazaki's Das wandelnde Schloss (2004) (\"Howl's Moving Castle,\" based on the young-adult novel by Diana Wynne Jones) as the Witch of the Waste, and several other roles through 2008, but thereafter acting endeavors for the beloved actress became increasingly rare. Lauren Bacall died on 12 August 2014, five weeks short of her 90th birthday.\n\nIn a six-decade-plus career (she started out as a radio performer at age 14), there are very few facets of entertainment that lovely singer/actress Polly Bergen has not conquered or, at the very least, touched upon. A nightclub and Columbia recording artist of the 50s and 60s, she is just as well known for her film and Emmy-winning dramatic performances as she is for her wry comedic gifts. In the leaner times, she has maintained quite well with her various businesses. Truly one for the ages, Polly has, at age 70+, nabbed a Tony nomination for her gutsy \"I'm Still Here\" entertainer Carlotta in Stephen Sondheim's \"Follies\", and was still dishing out the barbs as she recently demonstrated as Felicity Huffman's earthy mom on Desperate Housewives (2004).\n\nBorn in Knoxville, Tennessee as Nellie Burgin on July 14, 1930, her family, which included father William, mother Lucy and sister Barbra, eventually moved to Los Angeles. By the time she was 14, Polly was singing professionally on radio and managed to scrape up singing gigs with smaller bands around and about the Southern California area. She attended Compton Junior College before Paramount mogul Hal B. Wallis caught sight of her and signed her up with his studio. Having made an isolated film debut (as Polly Burgin) a year earlier in the Monogram western Across the Rio Grande (1949), Wallis showcased her as a decorative love interest in the slapstick vehicles of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, the (then) hottest comedy team in Hollywood. But Krach mit der Kompanie (1950), That's My Boy (1951) and Der Pr√ºgelknabe (1951) did little for Polly although she presented herself well. MGM and Universal had the idea to cast her in a more serious vein with co-starring roles in their dramas Verrat im Fort Bravo (1953), Arena (1953) and Schrei des Gejagten (1953), but again she was overlooked. Disasppointed, she decided to abandon her lucrative film contract and seek work elsewhere.\n\nThat \"elsewhere\" came in the form of 1950s TV. Focusing on her singing, she promoted her many albums for Columbia by guest-starring on all the top variety shows of the times. This culminated in her own variety program, The Polly Bergen Show (1957). The song \"The Party's Over\" became her traditional show-closer and signature tune. Polly also showed some marquee mettle on the cabaret and nightclub circuits, performing at many of the top hotels and showrooms throughout the country. She made her Broadway debut along with Harry Belafonte in \"John Murray Anderson's Almanac\" in 1953, and went on to appear in such stage shows as \"Top Man\" and \"Champagne Complex\". A delightfully engaging game show panelist to boot, she took a regular seat on the To Tell the Truth (1956) panel for five seasons.\n\nPolly tended to display a looser, down-to-earth personality to induce laughs but she was also was formidable dramatic player and fashion plate quite capable of radiating great charm, poise and elegance. For her role as alcoholic torch singer Helen Morgan in the special TV showcase The Helen Morgan Story (1957) , she took home the Emmy award. Unfortunately for Polly, Ann Blyth took on the role of the tragic singer in the film version (with Gogi Grant providing the vocals), in what could have been a significant return to films for her.\n\nInstead, Polly had to wait another five years for that to happen. As the wife of Gregory Peck and designated victim of revengeful psychopath Robert Mitchum in the taut movie thriller Ein K√∂der f√ºr die Bestie (1962), her film career reignited. Other opportunities came in the form of her distraught mental patient in Frauen, die nicht lieben d√ºrfen (1963), which found her at odds with nurse Joan Crawford and doctor Robert Stack; the sparkling comedy Eine zuviel im Bett (1963), which placed her in a comedy triangle with \"other wife\" Doris Day and husband James Garner; and as the first woman Chief Executive of the White House in the frothy comedy tidbit Prinzgemahl im Wei√üen Haus (1964) opposite bemused \"First Gentleman\" Fred MacMurray. In what was to be a tinge of deja vu, Polly again saw her movie career dissipate after only a couple of vehicles. True to form, the indomitable Polly rebounded on TV.\n\nA mild string of TV-movies came her way as she matured into the 1970s and 1980s, most notably the acclaimed miniseries Der Feuersturm (1983), which reunited her with Robert Mitchum, this time as his unhappy, alcoholic wife. This, along with her participation in the sequel, Feuersturm und Asche (1988), earned Polly supporting Emmy nominations. In the years to come, she would find herself still in demand displaying her trademark comic grit in such shows as Die Sopranos (1999), Welcome Mrs. President (2005) and Desperate Housewives (2004).\n\nPolly returned to singing in 1999 after nearly a three-decade absence (due to health and vocal issues). Quite huskier in tone, she went on to delight the New York musical stage with stand-out performances in \"Follies\" (2001), \"Cabaret\" (2002) and \"Camille Claudel\" (2007). Polly still made nightly appearances and had even put together singing concert tours on occasion.\n\nPolly has authored three best-selling beauty books outside the acting arena and has demonstrated a marked level of acumen in the business world. Founding a mail-order cosmetics business in 1965, she sold it to Faberge eight years later. She also developed her own shoe and jewelry lines.\n\nMarried (1950-1955) to MGM actor Jerome Courtland during her first movie career peak, she later wed topflight agent/producer Freddie Fields in 1957, a union that lasted 18 years and produced two adopted children, Pamela and Peter. A third marriage in the 1980s also ended in divorce. An assertive voice when it comes to women's rights and issues, her memoir \"Polly's Principles\" came out in 1974.\n\nPolly played a grandmother in her last film, the dramedy Vom Blitz getroffen (2012), and died two years later on September 20, 2013, at the age of 84.\n\nThe dark, petulant beauty of this petite American film and musical star worked to her advantage, especially in her early dramatic career. Anne Marie Blythe was born of Irish stock to Harry and Annie (nee Lynch) Blythe on August 16, 1928 in Mt. Kisco, New York. Her parents split while she was young and she, her mother and elder sister, Dorothy, moved to New York City, where the girls attended various Catholic schools. Already determined at an early age to perform, Ann attended Manhattan's Professional Children's School and was already a seasoned radio performer, particularly on soap dramas, while in elementary school. A member of New York's Children's Opera Company, the young girl made an important Broadway debut in 1941 at age 13 as the daughter of the characters played by Paul Lukas and Mady Christians in the classic Lillian Hellman WWII drama \"Watch on the Rhine\", billed as Anne (with an extra \"e\") Blyth. She stayed with the show for two years.\n\nWhile touring with the play in Los Angeles, the teenager was noticed by director Henry Koster at Universal and given a screen test. Signed on at age 16 as Ann (without the \"e\") Blyth, the pretty, photographic colleen displayed her warbling talent in her debut film, Chip Off the Old Block (1944), a swing-era teen musical starring Universal song-and-dance favorites Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan. She followed it pleasantly enough with other \"B\" tune-fests such as The Merry Monahans (1944) and Babes on Swing Street (1944). It wasn't until Warner Bros. borrowed her to make self-sacrificing mother Joan Crawford's life pure hell as the malicious, spiteful daughter Veda in the film classic Solange ein Herz schl√§gt (1945) that she really clicked with viewers and set up her dramatic career. With murder on her young character's mind, Hollywood stood up and took notice of this fresh-faced talent.\n\nAlthough Blyth lost the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year to another Anne (Anne Revere), she was borrowed again by Warner Bros. to film Danger Signal (1945). During filming, she suffered a broken back in a sledding accident while briefly vacationing in Lake Arrowhead and had to be replaced in the role. After a long convalescence (over a year and a half in a back brace) Universal used her in a wheelchair-bound cameo in Zelle R 17 (1947).\n\nHer first starring role was an inauspicious one opposite Sonny Tufts in Swell Guy (1946), but she finally began gaining some momentum again. Instead of offering her musical gifts, she continued her serious streak with Killer McCoy (1947) and a dangerously calculated role in Aus dem Dunkel des Waldes (1948), a prequel to Die kleinen F√ºchse (1941) in which Blyth played the Bette Davis role of Regina at a younger age. Her attempts at lighter comedy were mild at best, playing a fetching creature of the sea opposite William Powell in Mr. Peabody und die Meerjungfrau (1948) and a teen infatuated with a much-older film star, Robert Montgomery, in Once More, My Darling (1949).\n\nAt full-throttle as a star in the early 1950s, Blyth transitioned easily among glossy operettas, wide-eyed comedies and all-out melodramas, some of which tended to be overbaked and, thereby, overplayed. When not dishing out the high dramatics of an adopted girl searching for her birth mother in Unser eigenes Ich (1950) or a wrongly-convicted murderess in Schwester Maria Bonaventura (1951), she was introducing classic standards as wife to Mario Lanza in Der gro√üe Caruso (1951) or playing pert and perky in such light confections as Katie Did It (1950). A well-embraced romantic leading lady, she made her last film for Universal playing a Russian countess courted by Gregory Peck in Sturmfahrt nach Alaska (1952). MGM eventually optioned her for its musical outings, having borrowed her a couple of times previously. She became a chief operatic rival to Kathryn Grayson at the studio during that time. Grayson, however, fared much better than Blyth, who was given rather stilted vehicles.\n\nCatching Howard Keel's roving eye while costumed to the nines in the underwhelming Rose Marie (1954) and his daughter in Kismet (1955), she also gussied up other stiff proceedings like Alt Heidelberg (1954) and Des K√∂nigs Dieb (1955) will attest. Unfortunately, Blyth came to MGM at the tail end of the Golden Age of musicals and probably suffered for it. She was dropped by the studio in 1956. She reunited with old Universal co-star Donald O'Connor in The Buster Keaton Story (1957). Blyth ended her film career on a high note, however, playing the tragic title role in the Ein Leben im Rausch (1957) opposite a gorgeously smirking Paul Newman. She had a field day as the piano-sitting, kerchief-holding, liquor-swilling torch singer whose train wreck of a personal life was destined for celluloid. Disappointing for her personally, no doubt, was that her singing voice had to be dubbed (albeit superbly) by the highly emotive, non-operatic songstress Gogi Grant.\n\nThrough with films, Blyth's main concentration (after her family) were musical theatre and television. Over the years a number of classic songs were tailored to suit her glorious lyric soprano both in concert form and on the civic light opera/summer stock stages. \"The Sound of Music\", \"The King and I\", \"Carnival\", \"Bittersweet\", \"South Pacific\", \"Show Boat\" and \"A Little Night Music\" are but a few of her stage credits. During this time Blyth appeared as the typical American housewife for Hostess in its Twinkie, cupcake and fruit pie commercials, a job that lasted well over a decade. She made the last of her sporadic TV guest appearances on Quincy (1976) and Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984) in the mid-1980s.\n\nMarried since 1953 to Dr. James McNulty, the brother of late Irish tenor Dennis Day, she is the mother of five, Blyth continues to be seen occasionally at social functions and conventions.\n\nCharacter actress Beulah Bondi was a favorite of directors and audiences and is one of the reasons so many films from the 1930s and 1940s remain so enjoyable, as she was an integral part of many of the ensemble casts (a hallmark of the studio system) of major and/or great films, including Kampf in den Bergen (1936), Mr. Smith geht nach Washington (1939), Unsere kleine Stadt (1940) and Akkorde der Liebe (1941). Highly respected as a first-tier character actress, Bondi won two Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominations, for The Gorgeous Hussy (1936) and Of Human Hearts (1938), and an Emmy Award in 1976 for her turn in the television program Die Waltons (1972).\n\nShe was born Beulah Bondy on May 3, 1888, in Chicago, and established herself as a stage actress in the first phase of her career. She made her Broadway debut in Kenneth S. Webb's \"One of the Family\" at the 49th Street Theatre on December 21, 1925. The show was a modest hit, racking up 238 performances. She next appeared in another hit, Maxwell Anderson's \"Saturday's Children,\" which ran for 326 performances, before appearing in her first flop, Clemence Dane's \"Mariners\" in 1927. Philip Barry's and Elmer Rice's \"Cock Robin\" was an extremely modest hit in 1928, reaching the century mark (100 performances), but it was Bondi's performance in Rice's \"Street Scene,\" which opened at the Playhouse Theatre on Jamuary 10, 1929, that made her career. This famous play won Rice the 1929 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and was a big hit, playing for 601 performances. Most importantly, though, it brought Bondi to the movies at the advanced age of 43. She made her motion picture debut in 1931 in the movie adaptation (Street Scene (1931)), recreating the role she had originated on the Broadway stage. The talkies were still new, and she had the talent and the voice to thrive in Hollywood.\n\nBondi appeared in four more Broadway plays from 1931 to 1934, only one of which, \"The Late Christopher Bean\", a comedy by Sidney Howard, was a hit. Her last appearance on Broadway for a generation was in a flop staged by Melvyn Douglas, \"Mother Lode\" (she made two more appearances on the Great White Way, in \"Hilda Crane\" (1950) and \"On Borrowed Time\" in 1953; neither was a success). For the rest of her professional life, her career lay primarily in film and television.\n\nShe was typecast as mothers and, later, grandmothers, and played James Stewart's mother four times, most famously as \"Ma Bailey\" in Ist das Leben nicht sch√∂n? (1946). Her greatest role is considered her turn in Leo McCarey's Depression-era melodrama Kein Platz f√ºr Eltern (1937), in which she played a mother abandoned by her children.\n\nBeulah Bondi died on January 1, 1981, from complications from an accident, when she broke her ribs after falling over her cat. She was 92 years old.\n\nVivacious, blonde Mae Clarke was exposed to cinema from an early age, her father being an organist in a motion picture cinema. Growing up in Atlantic City, New Jersey, she learned how to dance. At the tender age of 13 she was already performing in nightclubs and amateur theatricals. In 1924, she was one of \"May Dawson's Dancing Girls\", a New York cabaret act, where she was \"discovered\" by producer Earl Lindsay and promptly cast in a minor part at the Strand Theatre on Times Square. She then performed as a dancer and burlesque artist at the Strand Roof nightclub, situated above the theatre (which was managed by Lindsay) and at the Everglades Club, earning $40 a week. While there she struck up a lifelong friendship with fellow actress Ruby Stevens, who would later change her name to Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nIn 1926, Clarke got her first chance in \"legitimate\" theater, appearing in the drama \"The Noose\" with Stanwyck and Ed Wynn. This was followed by the musical comedy \"Manhattan Mary\" (1927). The following year (1928), at age 17, she married her first husband, Lew Brice, brother of Fanny Brice. After further vaudeville experience, Clarke was screen-tested by Fox and landed her first movie role in 1929. While she was top-billed in films like Nix on Dames (1929), she was clearly headed for B-movie status and left Fox just over a year later. This resulted in better roles for her, though she was generally cast in \"hard-luck\" roles. She played prostitute Molly Malloy in the hugely successful Lewis Milestone-directed The Front Page (1931)) and, on the strength of this performance, was signed by Carl Laemmle Jr. at Universal and cast to star in Waterloo Bridge (1931) as a ballerina-turned-streetwalker, a part made famous by Vivien Leigh in the sanitized MGM remake, Ihr erster Mann (1940). Reviewer Mordaunt Hall described Clarke's complex performance as \"capital\" (New York Times, September 5, 1931).\n\nAlso in 1931, she had the brief and uncredited (but iconic) role for which she will always be known: the hapless girlfriend on the receiving end of a grapefruit pushed into her face by James Cagney in Der √∂ffentliche Feind (1931). She later appeared with Cagney (a close friend in real life) in still more adversarial scenes, in Der Frauenheld (1933) and Great Guy (1936). She had some feisty comedy roles in Three Wise Girls (1931) with Jean Harlow, and starring in Parole Girl (1933). She was third-billed in James Whale's Frankenstein (1931), as Elizabeth, the title character's bride-to-be. Her best moment in the film -- one of sheer terror -- comes when she is confronted by the monster (Boris Karloff) in her own bedroom. Sadly, Clarke's career suffered several major setbacks, beginning in 1932, from which it never fully recovered. She had a nervous breakdown in June of that year (and another in 1934), most likely caused by overwork and marital problems. This was followed by a serious car accident in March of 1933. In addition to that, her sexy screen personae became restricted by the new, strict Hollywood Production Code.\n\nWhen she returned to the screen it was to be in B-pictures. She had some rewarding parts in some films for Republic, notably The House of a Thousand Candles (1936) and the civil war romance Hearts in Bondage (1936), with Lew Ayres. Despite an image change from frizzy blonde to brunette she had few opportunities to shine after 1938, except, perhaps, as heroine of the Republic serial Der K√∂nig der Raketenm√§nner (1949). By the beginning of the 1950's, she was largely reduced to doing cameos and walk-on roles, at best playing minor parts in westerns. She did, however, make several notable appearances on television, particularly on Ihr Star: Loretta Young (1953).\n\nClarke, a star of Pre-Code Hollywood, fell on hard financial times towards the end of her life. After her last film appearance in Ein Mann sieht schwarz (1970), she retired to the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles and devoted her remaining years to her favorite hobby: painting in the style of Swiss abstract artist Paul Klee. She died there of cancer in 1992, aged 81.\n\nJoan Collins is an English actress from Paddington, London. She is most famous for playing the role of vengeful schemer Alexis Carrington Colby in the soap opera \"Dynasty\" (1981-1989). In 1997, She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama. In 2015, She was promoted to the rank of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to charity.\n\nShe was the daughter of talent agent Joseph William Collins (1902-1988) and his wife, dance teacher Elsa Bessant, (1906-1962). Joseph was born in South Africa, and of Jewish descent. As a talent agent, his most famous clients were Shirley Bassey, the Beatles, and Tom Jones. Elsa was born in the United Kingdom to an Anglican family.\n\nCollins was educated at Francis Holland School in London, an independent day school for girls. She made her theatrical debut c. 1942, as a child actress. She had a role in a performance of the play \"A Doll's House\" (1879) by Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906). In 1949, She started training as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. In 1950, she signed a contract with a British film studio, the Rank Organisation of businessman Joseph Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank (1888-1972).\n\nCollins made her film debut in the short film \"Facts and Fancies\" (1951), and her feature film debut in \"Lady Godiva Rides Again\" (1951), where she played an unnamed Beauty Queen Contestant. She had supporting roles as the Greek maid Marina in \"The Woman's Angle\" (1952) and gangster's moll Lil Carter in \"Judgment Deferred\" (1952).\n\nCollins had her big break when cast as juvenile delinquent Norma Hart in prison drama \"I Believe in You\" (1952). She was hailed as Britain's new \"bad girl\" and started being offered high-profile roles in British films. The next stage in her career started when cast as Princess Nellifer of Egypt in the historical epic \"Land of the Pharaohs\" (1955), an international production . While the film was not successful at the box office, it became a cult classic and Nellifer was one of her most recognizable roles. Studio executive Darryl Francis Zanuck (1902-1979) was sufficiently impressed to offer her a 7-year-long contract with American studio 20th Century Fox. She took the offer.\n\nCollins' first American film was the historical drama \"The Virgin Queen\" (1955), where she shared the top-billing with established stars Bette Davis and Richard Todd. She then played the leading role of actress Evelyn Nesbit (1884/1885-1967) in the biographical film \"The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing\" (1955). The role was intended for established actress Marilyn Monroe, but she replaced Monroe based on a studio decision.\n\nCollins was placed on loan to studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for her next role, that of gold digger Crystal in \"The Opposite Sex\" (1956). She received the top billing in the refugee-themed film \"Sea Wife\" (1956), and enjoyed box-office success with the interracial-love themed drama \"Island in the Sun\" (1957). In the drama film \"The Wayward Bus\" (1957), she received top-billing over her co-star Jayne Mansfield. Her next films included the spy thriller \"Stopover Tokyo\" (1957), the Western \"The Bravados\" (1958), the comedy \"Rally Round the Flag, Boys\" (1959), the caper film \"Seven Thieves\" (1960), and the biblical epic Esther and the King (1960).\n\nBy 1960, Collins was one of 20th Century Fox's biggest stars, but she demanded a release from her studio contract. She had campaigned for the title role in the upcoming production of \"Cleopatra\", but the studio chose to cast Elizabeth Taylor in the role. Collins felt slighted. As a freelance actress for most of the 1960s, she had few film roles. Among her most notable roles was playing the leading lady in \"The Road to Hong Kong\" (1962), the last film in the long-running \"Road to ...\" series. The male leads for the entire series were Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, but their usual leading lady Dorothy Lamour was considered too old for the role. Collins replaced Lamour.\n\nCollins started appearing frequently on television guest star roles. Among her most notable television roles was the villainous Siren in \"Batman\", and pacifist spokeswoman Edith Keeler in \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". \"Road to ...\" played in only one episode of Star Trek, the time-travel episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" (1967). However the episode is regarded among the best episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise, with Collins considered one of the most memorable guest stars in the original series.\n\nIn 1970, Collins returned to her native United Kingdom. She started appearing frequently in British thriller and horror films of the decade. Among her films was revenge-themed drama \"Revenge\" (1971),science fiction film \"Quest for Love\" (1972), horror anthology \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1972), psychological horror \"Fear in the Night\" (1972), thriller \"Dark Places\", horror anthology \"Tales That Witness Madness\" (1973), and horror film \"I Don't Want to Be Born\" (1975).\n\nCollins appeared in a few comedies in-between horror films, but none was particularly successful. She returned to the United States in order to play a role in the giant monster film \"Empire of the Ants\" (1977). She then returned to mostly appearing in thriller roles. She was catapulted back to stardom with the lead role of nymphomaniac Fontaine Khaled in the erotic drama \"The Stud\" (1978), an adaptation of a novel written by her younger sister Jackie Collins. The film was a surprise box office hit, earning 20 million dollars at the worldwide box office. \"Road to ...\" returned to the role of Fontaine in the sequel film ''The Bitch'' (1979), which was also a hit.\n\nCollins found herself in high demand in both stage and film. But she gained more notoriety with the television role of Alexis Carington in \"Dynasty\". She started appearing in the role in the second season of the soap opera. Her performance is credited with the subsequent rise of the show's Nielsen's ratings. She became a household name, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983.\n\nBy 1985, \"Dynasty\" was the number-one show in the United States, beating out rival soap opera \"Dallas\". Collins was nominated six times for a Golden Globe Award for her role, winning once in 1983. She was also once nominated for an Emmy as Best Actress in a Drama Series. Collins was viewed as a sex symbol at the time, and in 1983 appeared in a 12-page photo layout for Playboy magazine. She was 50-years-old, unusually old for a Playboy model.\n\nCollins appeared in a total of 195 episodes of \"Dynasty\". The series was canceled with the last episode of its 9th season, due to falling ratings. New ABC entertainment president Bob Iger (1951-) is credited with ending the series as soon as possible. The show had a cliffhanger ending, and several of its subplots were not resolved. Collins returned to the role of Alexis in the sequel mini-series \"Dynasty: The Reunion\" (1991). The miniseries only lasted for 2 episodes, but resolved several subplots and was a ratings hit.\n\nThroughout the 1990s., Collins returned to guest star roles in television. She appeared in (among others) \"Roseanne\", \"Egoli: Place of Gold\", and \"The Nanny\", She had the recurring role of Christina Hobson in the short-lived soap opera \"Pacific Palisades\" (1997). She appeared in 7 of its 13 episodes. Her next notable soap opera role was that of so-called \"rich bitch\" Alexandra Spaulding in 2002 episodes of the long-running series \"Guiding Light\". Collins was the third actress to play this role. following Beverlee McKinsey and Marj Dusay.\n\nIn film, Collins played Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma Flintstone's mother, in \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" (2000). It was the second live-action film based on the popular animated series \"The Flintstones\". In 2006, she toured the United Kingdom with \"An Evening with Joan Collins\", an one-woman show where she narrated the highs and lows of her career and life. She later toured the word with both this show and its sequel \"Joan Collins Unscripted\".\n\nCollins had a notable guest star-role as Ruth Van Rydock in the television film \"Agatha Christie's Marple: They Do It with Mirrors\" (2009). The film was an adaptation of the 1952 novel by Agatha Christie, where Ruth is an old school friend of Jane Marple, who assigned Jane to investigate a home for juvenile delinquents.\n\nCollins played herself in three episodes of the sitcom \"Happily Divorced\" (2011-2013). She had the recurring role of Crystal Hennessy-Vass in the sitcom \"Benidorm\" (2007-2018). She had another recurring role as Alexandra, Grand Duchess of Oxford in the soap opera \"The Royals\" (2015-2018).\n\nCollins had two different roles in the horror anthology series \"American Horror Story\". She played wealthy grandmother Evie Gallant, and witch Bubbles McGee. She appeared in a total of four episodes in 2018.\n\nBy 2024, Collins was 90-years-old. She has never retired from acting, and she continues to appear in new roles."
