        "text": "\"Chuck Tranberg meticulously and painstakingly researched, explored, and carefully chronicled this fascinating time in history. He offers us a glimpse into early Hollywood where the studio system incubated and dominated so many stars, Robert Taylor among them.\"\n\n-Terry Taylor, son of Robert Taylor, in his introduction to this book.\n\nRobert Taylor was one of Hollywood's biggest stars for over thirty-years and starred in such classic films as Magnificent Obsession, Camille, A Yank at Oxford, Waterloo Bridge, Johnny Eager, Quo Vadis, Ivanhoe and The Last Hunt. He worked with the cream of Hollywood leading ladies: Irene Dunne, Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh,Lana Turner, Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, who he later married, just to name a few. An open and friendly man who usually tried to avoid controversy, Taylor stepped into it when he became a so-called friendly witness appearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the height of the Washington investigations into alleged Communism in Hollywood. It has haunted his reputation to this day. A happy second marriage to actress Ursula Thiess produced two children and gave Taylor a contentment he lacked in his earlier marriage. Author Charles Tranberg takes a fresh look at the actor who was once called, \"The man with the perfect profile.\" This book also takes a fascinating look at the Hollywood Studio system which existed during Taylor's hey-day."
