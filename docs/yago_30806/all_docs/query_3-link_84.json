For personal use only.\n\nReFocus: The American Directors Series Series Editors: Robert Singer and Gary D. Rhodes Editorial Board: Kelly Basilio, Donna Campbell, Claire Perkins, Christopher Sharrett, and Yannis Tzioumakis ReFocus is a series of contemporary methodological and theoretical approaches to the interdisciplinary analyses and interpretations of neglected American directors, from the once-famous to the ignored, in direct relationship to American culture—its myths, values, and historical precepts. The series ignores no director who created a historical space—either in or out of the studio system—beginning from the origins of American cinema and up to the present. These directors produced film titles that appear in university film history and genre courses across international boundaries, and their work is often seen on television or available to download or purchase, but each suffers from a form of “canon envy”; directors such as these, among other important figures in the general history of American cinema, are underrepresented in the critical dialogue, yet each has created American narratives, works of film art, that warrant attention. ReFocus brings these American film directors to a new audience of scholars and general readers of both American and Film Studies.

In this episode, John Astin1 plays Fred Colby, a night watchman at the fictional Fillmore Studios in Hollywood. Colby was once an actor for the studio, appearing in its horror films. But now the studio is closing down and Colby, whose wife (Patty Duke, Astin’s real-life wife at the time) is late in her pregnancy, looks forward to changing professions. At first it seems that the biggest problems of his last shifts relate to a gang of teenagers sneaking onto the lot; however, it transpires that the monsters of the studio’s heyday have a spectral existence on the grounds and are scheming to reincarnate themselves through Colby’s unborn son. Colby foils them by breaking into the vault and setting the master prints of the horror films on fire, putting a stop to the cinematic monsters once and for all. Except for making film preservationists weep, “The Graveyard Shift” is not an exceptional example of a largely forgotten show. It has a special interest, however, as the only episode of what was then called Circle of Fear to feature a cameo by the show’s executive producer—the legendary showman, producer, and director William Castle (Figure I.1). Castle’s plays the company’s founder, J. B. Fillmore. Fillmore briefly appears at his old studio, full of wistful nostalgia about what he has built on the edge of its destruction: “Forty years, and soon it will all be dust.”2 Speaking to Colby, Fillmore reflects about their successful horror films: “Nobody did any better than we did, and do you know why? ’Cause I knew what the public wanted: to be scared out of their wits. That’s why I gave them the most terrifying characters ever created: the Not for distribution or resale.

Once he got bored with one, he’d move onto someone else. Men, women, even unborn children . . .” Fillmore laughs. “He probably was way, way ahead of his time.” It is at this moment that Colby realizes the nature of the threat against his unborn son. But the moment provides a pleasure of another sort through the presence of Castle, reprising a version of the perverse carnival barker/film impresario persona from his first-person introductions to most of the films of his gimmick cycle of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Like Fillmore, Castle was unapologetic about delivering “what the public wanted,” no matter how direct, tasteless, and lowbrow. His cameo in “The Graveyard Shift” has the same kind of surplus quality associated with movie stardom; he makes no attempt to vanish into the character, but rather his appearance functions as an attraction unto itself. When relatively few directors were household names, Castle, like his sometime model Alfred Hitchcock, built himself into a presence, an icon, a brand. Castle presents a potential a challenge for the auteur theory, both the strains promoted in France by the critics at Cahiers du cinéma and in the United States by Andrew Sarris,3 insofar as his authorial signatures are overt, at least where his most famous films are concerned. It does not fall to a critic to “discover” an Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\ni n troduction 3 auteur in his case: he makes it abundantly clear, addressing his audience directly in advertising and the films themselves with the directness of a pitchman or a mountebank. It may be more useful to think of Castle as an early case of what Timothy Corrigan has called the “commerce of auteurism”: “the author as a commercial strategy . . . as a critical concept bound to distribution and marketing aims that identify and address the potential cult status of an auteur.”4 While Corrigan describes this strategy as emerging with the New Hollywood generation of directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Stephen Spielberg, and George Lucas, packaged and marketed as auteurs, Castle seems like an ur-example, building himself into a larger-than-life attraction with whose name a film can be marketed, much like that of a movie star.5 In the last years of his life, with directing largely behind him, Castle maintained a sideline as an actor, playing, as in “The Graveyard Shift,” old Hollywood types: a producer in Shampoo (1975), a director in Day of the Locust (1975). Such roles fit him like a glove, and well they ought to have: he was a Hollywood insider with decades of history. And yet his most memorable screen appearance might be a brief and silent one: standing outside a phone booth in Rosemary’s Baby (1968) near the end of a four-minute long take, stoking Rosemary Wodehouse’s (Mia Farrow) growing paranoia even as he looks benign and grandfatherly. To the audience, if not to Rosemary, he is highly recognizable: he even sports his signature cigar (Figure I.2). The words “A William Castle Production” appear in the opening seconds of Rosemary’s Baby, so the cameo is an entirely appropriate gesture toward his authorial persona. If Castle’s sole contribution to film history were as a producer (of Orson Welles’ The Lady from Shanghai (1947) and Rosemary’s Baby, among less remembered films), that alone would make for a remarkable career. Yet his reputation truly rests on his status as “the Master” or “King of the Gimmicks,” “the Abominable Showman,” or “the Living Trailer,” alluded to in “The Graveyard Shift”: a larger-than-life figure whose authorial persona blurs with his films in fascinating ways. And yet that identification obscures much of the full sweep of his career.\n\n“. . . the d i r e c t o r o f t h e mo t ion p ic t u r e yo u ’ re a b o ut t o s e e . . . ” So who was William Castle? He was born William Schloss Jr. in New York City in 1914; his father was a German Jew. Schloss was orphaned by the age of twelve and would later adopt the literally translated surname “Castle.” He soon became a man of the theatre, operating as an assistant to Béla Lugosi during a stage revival of Dracula and later staging a successful series of summer stock plays at the Stony Creek Theatre in Connecticut in 1939. There he Not for distribution or resale.

Certain details of Castle’s biography are clouded by his own penchant for self-aggrandizing confabulation. His memoir, Step Right Up! I’m Gonna Scare the Pants Off America (1976), is full of entertaining but somewhat suspect episodes. Early on, he describes bluffing his way into Orson Welles’ good graces to get access to the Stony Creek Theatre, where the Mercury Theatre Company had held summer tryouts. With Welles and his company relocating to Hollywood to take up an invitation from R.K.O., Stony Creek was available, and Castle smelled an opportunity. Around the same time, Castle met German actress Ellen Schwanneke, “the star of Mädchen in Uniform (1931), a very successful film.”6 Schwanneke was in fact a supporting player in Mädchen in Uniform, and had since relocated to the United States. When she flouted a request to return to Nazi Germany, she was publicized as “The Girl Who Turned Down Hitler”: an advertising ploy from which Castle surely benefited (though he did not instigate it, as his memoirs imply). Castle describes conceiving of Das ist Nicht für Kinder as the title of a non-existent German play (to justify the casting of Schwanneke against Equity regulations)—translated to English as Not for Children. He describes writing the play in two days and bribing the son of his German-Jewish tailor to translate it into German. He attributed the German version to “Ludwig von Herschfeld”—“the name sounded as good as any. A new German playwright was born.”7 However, contemporary press for Not for Children lists it as adapted from a script by “Ludwig Herschfield,” a real Austrian playwright who died in 1945 (his play Geschaft mit Amerika was adapted in Britain as Yes, Mr. Brown (1933), a popular musical comedy). Further, consistently listed as the writer of Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\ni n troduction 5 Not for Children was playwright Wesley Towner, a name that does not appear in Step Right Up!8 In fact, Not for Children was adapted in Hollywood as The Mad Martindales (1942) a few years later, crediting Towner, Herschfeld, and Edmund Wolf as authors of the source play. If Castle were in fact, as he indicates, the author of this play, that would be notable information, yet Step Right Up! makes no reference to it. Are these inconsistencies attributable to Castle’s faulty memory as he wrote decades later? Perhaps. However, the baldest claim follows. Castle claims that the controversy around casting Schwanneke inspired death threats from the pro-Nazi German American Bundists. At four a.m. the night before Not for Children opened, he went to the theatre and, “With some lumber from backstage, I smashed windows in the theatre and overturned the box office. Then, with red paint, I drew swastikas on the walls.”9 Castle goes on to describe insisting that the play will open as scheduled, and even calling the governor of Connecticut (while posing as Orson Welles!) to demand protection from the national guard: “On the opening night soldiers with helmets and guns surrounded the theatre. Klieg lights flashed everywhere. Members of the audience arriving in formal attire were carefully inspected. It was one hell of an opening.”10 But if this were the case, the press seems to have overlooked it. I raise these points not in the spirit of damning Castle’s tendency toward self-serving deception (or even the understandable “print the legend” tendency of so much writing on Castle), but rather to explore the authorial persona Castle established for himself. Despite Castle’s profile as “a sort of minor-league Alfred Hitchcock,”11 in certain respects he also parallels Welles; the careers of the two men of theatre-turned-film entwined on a number of occasions, and both carefully constructed and managed larger-than-life public personas. Jonathan Rosenbaum writes that, “For a figure with the theatricality and imagination of Welles, exaggeration, hyperbole and flights of invention often took the place of solid facts . . . Welles often told lies as a raconteur in order to entertain.”12 Something similar can be said of Castle, who continually frames himself in Step Right Up! as a benign trickster, again and again getting ahead through his wits and his willingness to stretch the truth, while retaining a core of decency. From the beginning of his “gimmick” period in 1958, his films were not just pictures that happened to be directed by William Castle: they were Castle films, replete with his directorial persona. Castle’s reputation is so dominated by his gimmick films that we might think of his career as roughly divided into three phases: pregimmick, gimmick, and postgimmick. Of the three, the first is by far the most productive: between The Chance of a Lifetime (1943) and Uranium Boom (1956), Castle made more than three dozen B-movies, predominantly for Columbia. They included Westerns, war films, and crime films, as well as a few historical adventure movies and the like. He found work in the innumerable low-budget film series of the 1940s, Not for distribution or resale.

He would also work as a television director, including on ten episodes of Men of Annapolis (1957), where he became acquainted with screenwriter Robb White. The best remembered of Castle’s pregimmick features is the crime thriller When Strangers Marry (1944), also released as Betrayed. Welles himself praised it in his column in the New York Post, “Orson Welles’s Almanac”: “Making allowances for its bargain-price budget, I think you’ll agree with me that it’s one of the most gripping and effective pictures of the year.”13 So Castle was already an experienced director, a Hollywood insider who even received a smattering of critical acclaim, when he reconceived himself as the “King of the Gimmicks.” It is also when he fostered the identification as a horror auteur. The gimmick cycle consists of six horror films, each of which has a unique and highly marketable feature that altered the cinematic experience either directly or indirectly.14 The first was Macabre (1958), in which Castle claimed to have insured the audience against death by fright. He followed it in 1959 with two films starring Vincent Price: House on Haunted Hill15 and The Tingler. In both cases, Price’s finely honed “male diva”16 persona, balancing camp humor and credible menace, perfectly matched Castle’s productions and gimmicks. House on Haunted Hill featured “Emergo,” a pop-out skeleton that flew over the audience during the climax, while the latter had maybe the most famous Castle gimmick, “Percepto,” where theatre seats were rigged to vibrate at key moments. Next came 13 Ghosts (1960), with the color process “Illusion-O” and its “ghost viewer”; the “fright break” in Homicidal (1961), which allowed audience members the option of leaving if they were too scared to see the ending and its shocking twist; and the “Punishment Poll” in Mr. Sardonicus (1961), where the audience putatively decides the fate of the villain. All but the last film had screenplays by Robb White, a prolific novelist as well as a screenwriter, who did not recall their association fondly.17 White was also Castle’s producing collaborator in Susina Associates, their independent production company, which would ultimately be purchased by Columbia. Part of Castle’s strategy was to elide the need for name-brand actors by remaking himself into a name brand: “My name was now above the title in every marquee.”18 Castle made himself into a “Living Trailer,” a largerthan-life public persona who took charge of the marketing of his own films with an unusual directness. His first-person trailers were lower-rent analogs of Hitchcock’s celebrated trailers. Replacing Hitchcock’s dry British archness with an American carnival barker’s naked perversity, they promised the unprecedented scares his pictures would deliver and warned off the faint of heart. From The Tingler onwards, Castle did first-person introductions to his Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\ni n troduction 7 films from “inside” them, both building his authorial cult of personality and blurring the line between diegetic and audience space in a way that paralleled many of his gimmicks. The on-screen “William Castle” is uncontained by diegetic coherence, casually breaks the fourth wall, and appears in various locations: in front of a white cinema screen in The Tingler, in an office setting that blends corporate banality and mad-scientist kitsch in 13 Ghosts, in a family living room in Homicidal, on a foggy Victorian London street in Mr. Sardonicus. The appearances become more reflexive over time—he shares the screen with an animated skeleton in 13 Ghosts, and the opening to Homicidal is a litany of self-referentiality: “The more adventurous among you remember our previous excursions into the macabre, our visits to haunted hills and through tinglers and to ghosts.” Likewise, in the opening of Mr. Sardonicus Castle greets the audience as “My homicidal friends.” This “William Castle” is the same figure who appeared outside theatres interviewing shocked patrons in the trailer for Strait-Jacket (1964); and it was his distinctive silhouette, sitting a director’s chair with a cigar between his teeth, that circulated in advertisements. Rather like the skeleton in House on Haunted Hill, the “William Castle” persona was by no means confined to the screen. At his frequent public promotions, where he often arrived in a hearse or coffin, he made statements like, “Ladies and gentlemen, please do not reveal the ending of Homicidal to your friends, because if you do they will kill you, and if they don’t, I will.”19 His films are laughed at now, as they were when first released, by design, much in the manner of a carnival funhouse that combines giggles and screams. On the commentary track for the documentary Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story (2007), Castle’s daughter Terry Castle indicates that her father “didn’t take these things seriously . . . The whole thing was done in a campy way and he knew it was campy and he was having fun with it.”20 Castle recalls touring Europe to promote Homicidal and spontaneously crying, “Jesus, I speak German!” upon seeing his appearance in a dubbed version, to great laughter. “My surprise was so spontaneous that we kept it in every performance throughout Europe. I hadn’t realized my voice had been dubbed in many languages—French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch.”21 As usual, Castle positions himself as both an authentic man having genuine reactions and as an entertainer who dissembles and exaggerates for effect.22 But as much as Castle clearly enjoyed his own celebrity, uneasy lay the head that wore the crown of King of the Gimmicks. He lamented that “[h]aving to create a new, fresh gimmick for each picture was becoming tiresome. Critics were now starting to attack, claiming the only reason my films were successful was the gimmicks, and I was unable to make an important thriller without one.”23 All the same, there is not a clear dividing line between his gimmick and postgimmick films. His next two features were children’s films of a more straightforward kind:24 Zotz! (1962) and then 13 Frightened Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n8 m u r r a y le e d e r Girls (1963). Both had a gimmick of sorts: in the case of Zotz! moviegoers received replicas of the magical amulet from the film, and 13 Frightened Girls, also released as The Candy Web, featured actresses from different countries so that each could be the focus of a local advertising campaign. Yet these gimmicks are relatively extrinsic to the films themselves, and Zotz! and 13 Frightened Girls tend to be excluded from the “official” bounds of Castle’s gimmick cycle, perhaps unjustly, for reasons of genre.25 Neither of the children’s films was particularly successful, and the key film for transitioning away from gimmicks was Strait-Jacket. In fact, Step Right Up! implies that it preceded the two children’s films.26 It was certainly advertised with familiar exploitation film techniques, with “WARNING! ‘STRAIT-JACKET’ VIVIDLY DEPICTS AX MURDERS!” as its tagline, but more than anything it was a star vehicle for Joan Crawford, newly aligned with horror in the wake of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). Despite the lack of gimmicks (give or take some cardboard axes distributed to patrons, a nostalgic lark on Castle’s part), it feels like a Castle film through and through, with Crawford’s over-the-top histrionics standing in for the sensational attractions of the earlier films. In a sense, however, the partial position of StraitJacket within the Castle gimmick cycle speaks to the commensurability of Castle’s style of gimmickry with Hollywood’s general production logic, with a more traditional form of “stunt casting” substituting for the earlier gimmicks. The late Castle is rather an odd beast. Strait-Jacket led to other, more serious thrillers like I Saw What You Did (1965), also with Crawford in a small part, and The Night Walker (1964). Castle later made broad comedies like Let’s Kill Uncle (1966), The Spirit Is Willing (1967), and The Busy Body (1967), the minor but interesting science fiction film Project X (1968), and what may be the least classifiable film in his filmography, Shanks (1974). Some months after the release of Macabre, it had been reported that Castle was planning a theatrical adaptation of Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis;27 this production was obviously (and unfortunately) not to be, but Shanks may give us the clearest indication of what an “artistic” Castle project would look like. This collaboration with Marcel Marceau, a silent film pastiche with aspects of a pre-Night of the Living Dead (1968) zombie film that also seems to be a children’s film, received a DVD release in 2013 by Olive Films, but remains extremely obscure. Castle was open about his disappointment with the project in Step Right Up! As conceptually fascinating as it might be, Shanks plays more as a clumsy protoGuy Maddinesque curio than a forgotten classic, with Castle and Marceau’s sensibilities stubbornly refusing to gel.28 Some years earlier Castle had purchased the rights to Ira Levin’s 1967 novel of New York maternity and witchcraft, Rosemary’s Baby, with the intention of directing it himself. Robert Evans at Paramount overruled him and insisted on recruiting Roman Polanski to Hollywood to direct. Here again Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\ni n troduction 9 there exists another Rashomon (1950) of different tellings: Castle claims that he met with Polanski and became convinced that Evans’s judgment was correct,29 while Evans describes silencing Castle by refusing to go forward with him as a director and doubling his fee to act as producer, well before Castle ever met Polanski personally.30 Where Castle depicts himself as a principled artist willing to sacrifice his desires when he understood that the project was in good creative hands, Evans frames him as a blusterer who was easily bought off. But no matter; it is a fascinating irony that Castle’s greatest success as a producer helped usher in the new golden age of American horror related to the New Hollywood, a trend that more or less wiped away the kind of films he was making scant years earlier (as alluded to in “The Graveyard Shift”). His declining health and dwindling enthusiasm for directing led him to focus more on producing in his last years. His last film as a producer, the killer cockroach movie Bug (1975), had the misfortune to be released the same week as a much more successful “revenge of nature” picture called Jaws (1975)—so often spoken of as representing the moment when the exploitation marketing and distribution techniques associated with independents like Castle and Roger Corman were embraced by Hollywood as the “blockbuster mentality.” Castle died of a heart attack in 1977 at the age of sixty-three.\n\ncas t l e a f t e r c a st l e It is perhaps appropriate that Castle’s authorial persona, always somewhat unpinned from his personal identity, should have gone through a set of permutations after his death. It should be noted that his were not the only gimmick films; rather, his efforts revealed a new marketing strategy that would be eagerly exploited by others. A notable example was The Hypnotic Eye (1960), which purported to hypnotize its audience using “HypnoMagic.” Certain of Castle’s gimmicks were appropriated early on: Macabre’s gimmick was egregiously borrowed by The Screaming Skull (1958), which promised a free casket and burial for anyone who died of fright. Later, the UK werewolf film The Beast Must Die (1974) blatantly borrowed Homicidal’s Fright Break with a “Werewolf Break,” where the film pauses for the viewers to contemplate which character is the lycanthrope. Probably the second most famous “gimmick filmmaker” was Ray Dennis Steckler, best known for The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!? (1964). If Castle had been described as a poor man’s Hitchcock, Steckler was a poor man’s Castle, a “zero budget” auteur who acted in his films as “Cash Flagg” and reputedly lived out of his car to cut down on production costs. The gimmick for The Incredibly Strange Creatures was the bizarre “Hallucinogenic Hypnovision,” in which people in masks would occasionally run through the theatre. Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n10 m u r r a y le e de r Yet Castle’s larger legacy was less immediate. For within those crowds of kids experiencing the bacchanal of the gimmick films were a host of future directors who would later credit Castle as an important influence, like Robert Zemeckis, John Landis, Sam Raimi, Joe Dante and John Waters.31 Waters has spoken about the influence of Castle numerous times (see Kate J. Russell’s essay in this volume) and more recently cameoed as Castle on the television show Feud (2017–). Dante, a lifelong horror buff who in his youth served as the reviews editor for the fan magazine Castle of Dracula, paid tribute to Castle in Matinee (1993), in which Lawrence Woolsey (John Goodman) is an amalgam of Castle and other independent horror/science fiction directors of the 1950s and 60s. A cuddly emblem of American capitalism’s most benign aspects, Woolsey is a sort of huckster saint whose monsters and gimmicks provide a paradoxical stability during the chaos of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Another, more official Castle legacy is managed by his daughter Terry. Terry Castle had co-producer credits on remakes of House on Haunted Hill (1999) and Thirteen Ghosts (2001; the title was stylized as Thir13en Ghosts), produced through Dark Castle Pictures. Though these films are fairly generic horror films of their era with only a smattering of Castle’s style, they serve as evidence of a millennial Castle revival. Other remakes, as yet unrealized, were announced (including Macabre, slated to be directed by Robert Zemeckis,32 and The Tingler33). Terry Castle has also arranged a reprint of her father’s long-unavailable autobiography and a published screenplay of House on Haunted Hill with his notes intact;34 and she has established a website intended to preserve his legacy (williamcastle.com), offering new fiction inspired by her father’s works, including her loosely autobiographical novel Fearmaker: Family Matters (2011).35 For a time, the williamcastle.com site even hosted a blog written as if by Castle himself. Terry Castle participated in Jeffrey Schwarz’s celebratory documentary Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story, later to be included with Columbia’s five-disc The William Castle Film Collection in 2010. The Castle revival has penetrated the spaces of film art. La Cinémathèque Française in Paris ran a Castle retrospective from June 19 to August 2, 2009, as did New York’s Film Forum between August 27 and September 6 of that year. A broader cultural appreciation for Castle developed at roughly the same time. In 2013, the humor website Cracked.com declared him “the World’s Craziest Filmmaker” in an article written by Chris Sims: When you think about the filmmakers who have given us the greatest spectacles of all time, you probably think of people like Steven Spielberg or James Cameron. Hell, if you’ve recently been clocked upside the head with a two-by-four, you might even think about Michael Bay. When it Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\ni n troduction 11 comes to pure, unadulterated, attention-grabbing stunts, though, there’s one man who stands above all others: William Castle.36 Castle’s rising posthumous star is evidenced in the way his name is casually cited in discussions of vibrating theatre chairs,37 and bloggers endorse him as “a fucking visionary.”38 The aforementioned Cracked article opines, with reference to The Tingler, “I don’t think anybody actually thought a crazy fear monster was crushing their spine, but you can’t tell me that’s not a thousand times more fun than, say, anything that happened in Avatar.”39 This new adulation often positions Castle as a visionary auteur from a purer time, before a jaded audience faced an endless slate of new cinematic advances that fail to shake up the format as ostentatiously as something like The Tingler, leaving it yearning for good old-fashioned low-tech gimmickry with a hint of danger and transgression. As “kettlechips,” a commenter on the Cracked article, states: “the ‘Tingler’ shtick sounds WAYY too fun for something that could exist today . . . one complaint [about the physical buzzing] would ruin it for everyone else.”40 The recent veneration of Castle stands in stark contrast to the bemused dismissal his gimmicks received, for instance, in Michael and Harry Medved’s The Golden Turkey Awards (1980).41 Recognition of Castle in academia has grown steadily as well. While he was not paid much attention during the formative phase of horror studies, he is now a canonical figure. Scholarship on individual Castle films like The Tingler,42 Strait-Jacket,43 and I Know What You Did44 coexist with broader examinations of aspects of his career;45 outside of the academic publishing establishment, two career-spanning books on Castle have appeared as well.46 Catherine Clepper notes that Castle’s relevance to the phenomenological turn in film theory resides in the way his gimmick films are “indicative of what cinematic embodiment can mean in a material, proximate, and shocking sense, rather than as a mode of affective sympathy or reflexive mirroring.”47 Indeed, scholarship on film phenomenology and affect has referenced Castle and his gimmicks with some regularity.48 Industrial and cultural treatments of the horror film centering on the 1950s and 60s have examined Castle’s career as well.49 On another register, the inclusion of a first-person trailer for Castle’s Homicidal in the DVD collection Experiments in Terror (2005) reflects an interesting attempt to draw him into the constellation of experimental cinema. It sits alongside the trailers for The Nanny (1965), Cannibal Girls (1973), Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde (1971), and Blacula (1972), unpinned from their commercial function so that their unbridled strangeness is reconfigured as avant-garde. Castle has received references and homages in other places. Joe R. Lansdale, the accomplished horror novelist best known to moviegoers for Bubba Ho-Tep (2002), wrote a story called “Belly Laugh, or, The Joker’s Trick or Treat” for Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n12 m u r r a y le e de r the 1990 print anthology The Further Adventures of the Joker, featuring the Joker rigging a movie theatre with deadly traps for Batman inspired by House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler, and Mr. Sardonicus.50 Appropriately enough, the Joker says that he was among those few voting against Sardonicus’s dark fate as a boy. Another homage to Castle appeared in a 1978 episode of the great Canadian sketch comedy show SCTV (1976–1984), imagining a Castledirected adaptation of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express called Death Takes No Holiday. Portrayed by Dave Thomas, Castle interrupts the film to stage a Sardonicus-style poll on the film’s ending, only to be overruled by Hercule Poirot (John Candy) and Agatha Christie (Andrea Martin) herself, the latter writing the story from within it, who accost him in the non-diegetic space of Castle’s first-person audience address and strangle him. What other director could you simultaneously raise and refute the authorship of, while depicting him on screen and “killing” him a mere year after his actual death, and have this play as a gesture in relatively good taste?\n\n“ . . . i f e e l o b l i ga t e d t o w a rn y ou . . .” The word “unique” is often abused, and yet it seems rather unavoidable where William Castle is concerned. Indeed, his Britannica entry declares, “A master showman, he made a unique, if minor, contribution to American motion pictures.”51 This collection hopes to show that, in the aggregate at least, his contribution has been something more than minor. It is perhaps inevitable that the essays collected here spend the most time on the gimmick films, but they also excavate Castle’s earlier and later work, and contextualize the gimmick films within his long career. The first part of ReFocus: The Films of William Castle is entitled “The Early Castle” and deals with his pregimmick days. Hugh S. Manon’s “When Strangers Marry: Film Noir as Mediated Gothic” is a sustained analysis of Castle’s early classic and how it uses generic noir tropes to transform the Gothic tradition. Zack Rearick’s “Gender in William Castle’s Westerns” focuses on an especially neglected facet of Castle’s career, his Westerns. The following part, “The Gimmick Cycle,” deals with Castle’s most famous films, most broadly and narratively. The first entry is Anthony Thomas McKenna’s “He Earned Our Forgiveness: William Castle and American Movie Showmanship,” which explores the industrial conditions of the 1950s and 60s American film industry that allowed Castle’s brand of showmanship to flourish. It is followed by a reprint of Murray Leeder’s “Collective Screams: William Castle and the Gimmick Film,” which particularly examines House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler as profoundly reflexive texts that not only reflect but are about Castle’s own authority and showmanship. It describes the Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\ni n troduction 13 gimmick films as revivals of sorts of the mode of authorship associated with early cinema’s trick films. The next three chapters provide case studies of gimmick films. Beth Kattelman offers a probing treatment of Macabre and its relationship to the theatrical tradition of ballyhoo, also offering an exploration of the potential for real-life “death by fright.” Eliot Bessette follows with an examination of 13 Ghosts and its themes of belief and disbelief, its links with Psycho (1960) and elements of its reception. Alexandra Heller-Nicholas discusses Mr. Sardonicus through the film’s central image of the mask. Moving partly beyond the gimmick film, the part entitled “Castle, Authorship, and Genre” assembles a series of chapters beginning with Steffen Hantke’s “A Sick Mind in Search of a Monstrous Body: William Castle and the Emergence of Psychological Horror in the 1960s.” Hantke examines both gimmick and postgimmick to locate Castle within the emerging paradigm of the psychological horror film, while also noting that Castle’s insistence on gruesome imagery and embodied reactions somewhat distinguishes himself from other figures such as Hitchcock. Michael Brodski and Caroline Langhorst’s “ ‘What a Wicked Game to Play?’: Playfulness, Generic Hybridity, and Cult Appeal in Castle’s 1960s Films” also sees continuities between Castle’s gimmick and postgimmick films, finding engagement with postwar social issues precisely through his playful approach to genre. Michael Petitti’s “ ‘Where Did Our Love Go?’: The Case of William Castle’s Disintegration of the American Marriage in The Night Walker,” takes one of Castle’s most satisfying and fascinating films as a case study while connecting it with his gimmick and postgimmick canons. The final part chronicles dimensions of Castle’s influences. First, Peter Marra traces the influence of Castle on the slasher film cycle of the late 1970s and early 1980s. His “Homo/cidal: William Castle’s 1960s Killer Queers” finds an intriguing presence of queerness in some of Castle’s films through their very incoherence. The last chapter, Kate J. Russell’s “The Cinematic Pandemonium of William Castle and John Waters,” explores Castle’s relationship to perhaps his most vocal disciple, the iconic American independent director John Waters. It chronicles the influence of Castle on Waters and the relationship of shock, disgust, and gimmickry.\n\n“. . . bu t d o n ’ t b e a l a r me d . . .” Michael Petitti has kindly provided us with a photograph of Castle’s tombstone in Glendale, California (Figure I.3).

Yet it is a reminder that there was so much more to him than just the showman, both personally and professionally.

Manon\n\nO\n\nf William Castle’s 1944 film When Strangers Marry, Orson Welles wrote the following: “Making allowances for its bargain-price budget . . . it’s one of the most gripping and effective pictures of the year. It isn’t as slick as Double Indemnity or as glossy as Laura, but it’s better acted and better directed by William Castle than either.”1 In retrospect, Welles is of course correct to compare Castle’s “ ‘B’ minus” crime thriller to two contemporaneous films that critics would later identify as keystone films noirs. However, a great deal can be gained by resituating the female-centered narrative of When Strangers Marry as part of the upsurge, in 1940s Hollywood, of the Gothic romance, best exemplified by films such as Rebecca (1940) and Gaslight (1944). When Strangers Marry appears at a critical point in film noir’s development, while at the same time illuminating the Gothic as a crucial generic precursor to noir’s bleak, newsprint-obsessed crime narratives, of which it is a pointed example. More acutely than Double Indemnity (1944) or Laura (1944), Castle’s film develops a set of generic film noir tropes by mediating the Gothic. The word “mediate” is being used here in two ways: both as an indicator that the classical Gothic is being transformed and reframed by Castle’s film, and as a way of denoting the ostensible catalyst for this transformation: the proliferation of modern telecommunications media in mid-century American life. As I argue below, the traditional Gothic is a genre at great pains to highlight, and derive chills from, a phenomenon that psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms “the gaze” (le regard), an individual’s sudden realization that they occupy a field of vision at odds with their own perspective. The gaze is most commonly experienced as a sense that one is being watched, especially when the existence or position of the watcher is not confirmable. In Gothic narratives, the characteristic isolation of the (usually) female protagonist is punctuated by a series of Not for distribution or resale.

Shadows emerge at the periphery of her vision, and then vanish. Messages are received, but the sender’s motives remain strange. Objects impossibly appear, disappear, or change places. The hired help is either oversolicitous or rudely uncooperative, but always suspicious. An uncanny aura of death and decay pervades even the most banal of activities. In all of these encounters, what the Gothic heroine discerns is precisely the sense of a beyond, which is precisely the feeling the gaze evokes in the human subject. Although William Castle and other auteurs of the cinematic Gothic surely did not read Lacanian theory, we can nonetheless begin to appreciate how Lacan’s conception of the gaze as an impossible blot in the field of vision has a strong bearing on the narrative and aesthetic qualities of the Gothic. Indeed, it would not be wrong to state that the Gothic is the genre of the gaze, provided we come to terms with the various plot elements and filmmaking techniques that make the Gothic narrative a distinct form of horror story, as a well as a distinct form of crime story. Castle’s brilliant intervention in When Strangers Marry is to perpetuate the gothic gaze via the fragmentary signification of mid-century media: telegrams, phone calls, radio broadcasts, and especially newsprint. His Gothic heroine is repeatedly hemmed in, demoralized, and confounded by the persistent interruptions of analog media transmissions—communications that are supposed to provide signifying clarity and closure, but instead only convey strangeness and lack. Beginning with a discussion of the film’s trenchant incorporation of references to cinema and radio, I go on to explain that the film’s nearconstant references to newsprint provide a special case of the mediated Gothic, insofar as headline news is film noir’s particular fetish, a narrative and stylistic obsession that is just beginning to develop in 1944, but which will increase exponentially in noir as the genre crystallizes later in the decade.\n\nmu rd e r a mi d s t m e d i a When Strangers Marry announces its engagement with media per se in its very first shot sequence. Produced by the King Brothers for Monogram Pictures, a Poverty Row studio known for quickly created, low-budget B action films, the film begins with an abrupt camera push to a close-up of a man wearing a papier-mâché lion’s head. The image is accompanied by a non-diegetic lion’s roar. We are at the Hotel Philadelphia, whose rooftop sign flashes the message “WELCOME LIONS,” but the cheaply cartoonish mask and the roar on the soundtrack makes a different announcement: this will not be an ostentatious MGM production. By jokingly referencing a studio that is out of Monogram’s league, Castle sets the tone of his own production aesthetic, which makes up Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nf ilm no ir as mediated goth ic 23 for its lack of financial wherewithal through inventiveness and an embrace of its own limitations. The result, at least according to Welles, is a film that punches above its weight—not quite MGM, but far better than expected from Monogram. The lion’s head is worn by a conventioneer named Sam Prescott (Dick Elliott), whose drunkenness becomes the source of the narrative’s inciting incident. Prescott enters the nearly empty hotel bar flashing around a large wad of money ($10,000 cash, he says), part of which he drops on the floor while paying for drinks. An ominous man in a fedora, whose face we never see and who never speaks, helps Prescott to pick up the cash. When the bartender (Lou Lubin) notes that the convention has made it impossible to find a room anywhere in the city, Prescott invites the stranger to share his own room. “Any friend of Sam Prescott’s,” Prescott says, nearly toppling over, “is a friend of mine.” The two leave together, with Prescott drunkenly cackling and the identity of the man in the fedora still obscured. In the scene that follows, the young William Castle’s directorial talents become amply evident. In both narrative and stylistic terms, shot-by-shot, it is difficult to think of more complex or nuanced interplay of word and image in a Hollywood B-picture. The overall scene exists to establish that Prescott is dead, presumably killed for his money by the faceless stranger. Such a scene could have been handled straightforwardly, in the manner of a classical detective whodunit, through a perfunctory discovery of the corpse and a couple of memorable clues, while nonetheless producing the kind of visceral shock 1940s audiences expected from a quickly paced crime film. What Castle delivers instead, however, is a kind of leap-frogging, dialectical meditation on the unidirectional connectivity of electronic media and the oblivious anonymity of modern urban life—two themes that pervade the noir-tinged Gothic melodrama that follows. By incorporating media as part of the crime scene, and by aggressively manipulating cinema’s capacity to obfuscate and then deliver, tease and then satisfy, Castle intuits and thus exploits the structure of the gaze, which for Lacan “is always a play of light and opacity.”2 As the hotel bar closes for the night and Prescott exits with his new “friend,” the camera dissolves to a daylight shot of a window veiled by a diaphanous curtain that billows in the breeze. Through the window, the camera reveals numerous other windows belonging to the building across the street—perhaps another hotel or an office building. The camera holds on this image while a friendly male voice emerges on the soundtrack: “That’s right. Now take a deep breath. Ready? Now, no fair cheating—a deep breath, I said! That’s right. Inhale . . . Exhale . . .” At this moment, before the camera moves, it is unclear—one is tempted to say conspicuously opaque—who is speaking these words and why. In psychoanalytic theorist Michel Chion’s terms, the disembodied voice we Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n24 hu g h s . m ano n hear is an example of an “acousmatic voice,” a voice whose ominous, captivating power derives from the fact that it cannot be attached to any speaker. If the Lacanian gaze can be understood as a seen presence whose meaning is unknown and undiscoverable, the acousmatic voice is a heard sound whose source cannot be known, because it is conceptually (and in this case literally) out of frame.3 This disjunction of sound and image is soon remedied when the camera pulls back to reveal a console radio standing between two large windows. The voice comes neither from within the room, nor from a window across the way, but instead from a radio studio in some other part of the city, broadcasting a calisthenics program in the style of Bernarr Macfadden or (later, on television) Jack LaLanne. At the point that Castle’s camera visually connects the acousmatic voice to its source, the source is revealed to be yet another form of acousmatic voice.4 Chion makes the case that “radio is acousmatic by nature” and that “[i]n radio, one cannot play with showing, partially showing and not showing.” However, Castle’s approach wryly undermines the acousmatic ontology of radio by disembodying the radio itself, initially withholding and then revealing the very technology that is the cause of the acousmêtre. This initial dialectical movement, using the camera-pull to provide an objective source for the voice, but not a physically present body who speaks, represents a nascent version of the kind of carnivalesque gimmickry Castle will more aggressively deploy in later films such as The Tingler (1959) and 13 Ghosts (1960). For Castle, technology is not something to be blindly accepted or taken for granted, but something to be toyed with, exploited, and even perversely made to undermine itself. In a strong sense, the camera-pull that unveils the radio forecasts the famous “Club Silencio” sequence in David Lynch’s postmodern film noir Mulholland Dr. (2001), in which a lilting Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison’s “Crying” on the soundtrack is abruptly decoupled from the singer’s (Rebekah Del Rio) moving lips when she falls unconscious to the floor and is carried off stage. Similar to Lynch’s emcee (Geno Silva), who tells the audience, “No hay banda; there is no band,” Castle’s quirky reveal tells us that there is no human speaker for the words we hear, only a radio speaker. He is saying “Gotcha!” but also “see what I just did there?” Modern electronic media can be deceptive, even discombobulating, and Castle uses media to deceive his own audience, while at least partly admitting the trickery in which he is engaged. But the dialectical machinations of the scene do not stop there. As the voice on the radio continues to coach his audience through a series of exercises, the camera pans right to reveal a chambermaid (Virginia Sale) who has entered the room carrying a vacuum cleaner and some clean sheets. We listen along with her: “Bend, stretch, bend, stretch. Touch your toes! . . . Ah, you can do it. That’s better.”5 The maid pauses to shake her head at the radio in a mildly scornful way, although it is unclear whether she is disappointed with the Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nf ilm no ir as mediated goth ic 25 room’s former guests, who apparently left without turning off the radio, or with all the non-working middle-class housewives in the city who, unlike her, have the luxury of staying at home to consume such programming. Regardless, we have arrived at the scene’s second meaning: that modern urban existence depends on workers whose labor goes unseen, but who, in our absence, gain unfettered access to the spaces we inhabit. Castle’s sequence does not excise the activities of a mere chambermaid; it goes out of its way to include her—and not only her physical body, but something of her agency, as evinced in her disapproving little shake of the head. With the maid established not as an object, but as a full-fledged subject, we can now proceed to the third dialectical collision this complex scene wants to stage. As the maid leaves the sitting room and enters the bedroom, her voice displaces the radio voice, but in a manner that is similarly decoupled from any moving lips on screen. We see the maid plug in her vacuum and the camera tilts down so that it fills the frame, as its loud motor fills the soundtrack. The voice of the maid, whose face no longer appears, seems to come from nowhere: “Look now, I’ve got twenty-six rooms to clean and I can’t upset my schedule . . .” Just as the context for the radio voice was unclear, the exclusive close-up on the vacuum disallows any sense of who the maid is addressing. Again the camera resituates, pulling back to provide the answer: Prescott is sitting in a chair in the middle of the room with the lion’s-head mask still on. Is he asleep, hung over as usual? Switching off the vacuum, the maid approaches him wearily: “Please, Mr. Prescott, don’t be difficult. Mr. Prescott?” She lifts the mask and screams in horror, signaling that Prescott has been murdered—an ironically immobile endpoint for the sequence, given all the liveliness of the radio exercise show, the harried maid, and the nimble movements of Castle’s camera. To sum up, the Hotel Philadelphia scene in When Strangers Marry represents a complex interplay in which the partialness of the viewer’s knowledge—­ specifically shots in which one hears but does not see—alternatingly impedes and facilitates the maid’s plot-initiating discovery of Prescott’s corpse. The room initially appears lively and upbeat by virtue of the calisthenics instructor’s pleasant encouragements, but in reality it is a drunken man’s death chamber. Here, as in all films noirs, things are not what they appear at the surface. However, the more crucial point concerns Castle’s meaning-deprivation technique, in which both radio and cinema are self-reflexively put on display. To do so establishes noir deception less as a matter of wartime paranoia, and more as a question of media-technological anxiety. In effect, Castle’s version of noir transports the viewer, like a radio wave, beyond the vision-obstructing walls and curtains of an urban hotel suite to show us what it looks like to see too much. Such epistemological translucence is of course not what average citizens experience moment-by-moment in their everyday lives. Rather, films Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n26 hu g h s . m ano n noirs like When Strangers Marry permit their viewers an experience that is all but impossible in the real world: an exceptional boundary-crossing gaze that allows them to see precisely just how much they fail to see in their everyday interactions. The dialectical merge-points in the hotel sequence ultimately come full circle when we realize that we have witnessed a murder and its discovery only so as to recognize ourselves, metaphorically, in one of the many oblivious windows across the way—windows through which scores of occupants could have seen a lurid murder-by-strangulation, but didn’t. The scene’s opening shot, recalling paintings by American realist painter Edward Hopper such as Apartment Houses (1923), Room in Brooklyn (1932), Night Windows (1928), and House at Dusk (1935), serves as a metaphor for all the blind, oblivious eyes out there in the world, and in this way pointedly exemplifies the fundamental paradox of the Lacanian gaze: “I see only from one point, but in my existence I am looked at from all sides.”6 Such reflexive framing (a window-frame which “looks out,” only to frame a series of other frames which seem to “look in” at this banal scene of a woman cleaning a hotel room, a scene that will come to mean so much more) succinctly conveys the enjoinder to look and see what you’re missing that is noir’s prime directive.\n\nw he n g e nr e s m a r r y In a strong sense, the female protagonist of When Strangers Marry is our surrogate, our avatar in the story-world, owing to the fact that her lack of knowledge mostly coincides with our own. Young bride Mildred Baxter (Kim Hunter) is often affectionately referred to as “Millie,” both by her husband Paul (Dean Jagger) and her ex-boyfriend Fred (Robert Mitchum); however, to hypocoristically excise the “-dred” from her name does nothing to abate the dread of her moment-by-moment experience. Mildred’s plot-line combines two anxiety-driven genres, updating the classical Gothic “Bluebeard” scenario, in which a young bride is deceived at every turn by her (apparently) murderous new husband, to incorporate the traversal of a paranoid film noir cityscape, in which every mundane encounter is a potential threat. As such, Castle’s film knots together his earlier focus on crime genres with his later horror output. Mildred’s inquisitive pursuit also represents a quantitatively scarce, but qualitatively striking 1940s character type identified by Samantha Lindop as a combination of the Gothic heroine and female investigator, seen elsewhere in Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Born to Kill (1947), and A Kiss Before Dying (Gerd Oswald, 1956).7 However, unlike the male investigators who appear in Castle’s other 1940s films, Mildred Baxter is a true naïf, unaccustomed to marriage or big city life, and more than ready to be “gaslighted” when her narrative Not for distribution or resale.

In the early sequence on the train, Mildred reveals that she came from a small Ohio town, and that she married her husband, whom she is en route to meet, after having met him only three times. This eponymous premise, that Mildred “married a stranger,” represents the most conventional launchpad for the narrative type known as the modern Gothic romance.8 According to Diane Waldman, the modern Gothic romance subgenre involves a tightly defined narrative premise: [A] young inexperienced woman meets a handsome older man to whom she is alternately attracted and repelled. After a whirlwind courtship . . . she marries him. After returning to the ancestral mansion of one of the pair, the heroine experiences a series of bizarre and uncanny incidents, open to ambiguous interpretation, revolving around the question of whether or not the Gothic male really loves her. She begins to suspect that he may be a murderer.9 Within this hallmark subgenre of 1940s Hollywood, Waldman situates such films as Suspicion (1941) and Secret Beyond the Door (1947), as well as Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n28 hu g h s . m ano n l­esser-known films such as Undercurrent (1946) and Sleep, My Love (1948). Waldman does not mention When Strangers Marry, perhaps because it is not set in a remote mansion, but it seems clear that Castle has made a deliberate effort to substitute the urban milieu of New York City for the Gothic manse, trading the looming parapets, strange portraits, forbidden rooms, and mysterious tunnels of the traditional female Gothic for the hotel rooms, diners, jazz clubs, theatre lobbies, etc., that will become hallmarks of film noir. Castle’s modern city is labyrinthine, mostly dark, populated by uncooperative locals, and above all prone to abrupt turnabouts and audiovisual shocks. It is also, however, a milieu positively obsessed with the medium of newsprint and its ontology. Castle’s substantial innovation in When Strangers Marry, and what perhaps more than anything justifies discussing the B-picture film in the same breath as A-list films noirs such as Double Indemnity and Laura, is his effort to develop noir’s obsession with media, and especially its fetishization of headline news. Typical of this media-centric approach is a scene in which Mildred goes to the movies with husband Paul, exits the theatre to make a phone call to ex-boyfriend Fred, learns that Paul has mysteriously resigned all his sales accounts in Philadelphia, aborts the call, exits the phone booth to find a newspaper, checks a telegram to recall a specific date, purchases the Philadelphia newspaper for that date from a newsstand, cannot read the newspaper because of the dim street lights, goes to a well-lit diner, and when she finally reads the story of the so-called “Silk Stocking Murder,” comes away with more questions than answers about her husband’s possible involvement. This sequence, I argue, is a perfect example of the way film noir both adapts and reframes the Gothic romance by mediating it. The sequence culminates in Fred meeting Mildred at the diner. She expresses her deep concerns that Paul may be involved in the murder, a conclusion the audience has been strongly encouraged to share. Fred retorts, “You mean to tell me you made up your mind just from reading this paper?” In this incredulous line of dialogue, Fred gives voice to an underappreciated major theme in film noir, and one that Castle helps to cement. When Strangers Marry could have remained a modern Gothic romance, but for the repeated complication of the plot via headline news. Unlike in Rebecca or Gaslight, the suspicion that the husband is a murderer is facilitated by the daily circulation of newspapers, which swings the film’s overall trajectory sharply into noir territory. As film noir coalesces around a set of archetypes and narrative gambits in the late 1940s, it becomes positively obsessed with the bombastic and often lurid epistemology of headline news, as well as the ways in which the press both represents and exploits mysterious true crime stories. In order to assert that noir, among its other distinguishing generic qualifications, is the genre of headline fetishism, that noir is somehow fixated on the Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nf ilm no ir as mediated goth ic 29 very idea of newsprint as a cultural paradigm, what exactly would one need to prove? Since numerous films throughout the history of cinema have resorted to newsprint for reasons of narrative economy (i.e., as a relatively cheap and effective way to advance the plot) there can be no tenable argument that noir is unique in resorting to the on-screen appearance of news headlines. Nor does it seem likely that noir utilizes a greater or lesser quantity of on-screen headlines than, say, the screwball comedy or the musical. Setting aside these debates about quantity, any argument about newsprint as a gravitational center for noir must take a two-pronged approach. First, we must demonstrate that the ontology of daily news, both in its garish representation of above-the-fold crime stories and in its structure of daily and semi-daily circulation, inflects noir both thematically and formally. And second, we must establish that the narrating function of on-screen headlines is substantially different from the function of headlines in other genres of the period. The quality of noir’s headlines, then, is the real issue—not their quantity. Headlines appear everywhere in Hollywood film, but film noir treats them in a peculiar way, and it is only by specifying this peculiarity that any illumination of film noir’s remarkable “nose for news” can be explained. I will thus propose the following axiom: When news appears on screen in film noir, it appears as recognizably false information; information that has already been, or will soon be, undercut by the behind-the-scenes activities we witness. Indeed, in the vast majority of cases, noir headlines could very plausibly be followed by a voice-of-God narration stating, “. . . but you, the viewer, know better . . .” Though the viewer of course never hears this point of clarification so literally enunciated, noir’s point is no less clear. From breakfast-time perusers to serious armchair detectives and conspiracy theorists, everyone knows that the attractiveness of the headline news story derives not from its production of an answer, but from its raising of a question—the arrival on the reader’s doorstep of a problem which can’t be solved, but which one can fantasize about by reading between the lines. The news-craving public (fans of the tabloids, the scandal sheets, and yellow journalism) entertain the fantasy that something dreadful and horrific is possible in everyday life; they are in love with the idea that danger is not so much really imminent, but is present without being seen. Given these presumptions, one way to conceive of noir’s on-screen headlines is not as a source from which the viewer can glean basic plot information, but as signifying a lack of signification, connoting a sense of “who knows what the truth is?” In a word, news in noir is a gaze—an obfuscating, impassable point of juncture between here and the beyond. Crucial to this effect is the fact that noir reveals criminality from the inside. While screening a film noir, the viewer is witness to a complete, totalized, behind-the-scenes truth, and in turn, noir’s on-screen headlines deliver either a misrepresentation of or a gateway to the “inside scoop” that the Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n30 hu g h s . m ano n narrative displays. These two realms of truth, the between-the-lines and the behind-the-scenes, are for all purposes utterly equivalent. Noir simply brings this connection to the forefront. Epicentral to film noir even when it is not shown, the news headline does not represent a solution, but instead functions as a veil between the oblivious eyes of the public and the private gaze of the various criminal agents who stoke the conflicts of film noir’s narratives.\n\nt he g a z e a n d t h e v e i l In his book The Real Gaze: Film Theory After Lacan, theorist Todd McGowan explains that the look, which is on the side of the subject, is not the same as the gaze, which is on the side of the object. In this way, the gaze is not determined by or associated with the viewer’s perspective, but instead is a necessarily distorted, nonsensical point around which the visual field is organized. The gaze is “the point at which the visual field takes the subject’s desire into account”: If a particular visual field attracts a subject’s desire, the gaze must be present there as a point of an absence of sense. The gaze compels our look because it appears to offer access to the unseen, to the reverse side of the visible. It promises the subject the secret of the Other, but this secret exists only insofar as it remains hidden.10 In phenomenological terms, the gaze involves the emergence of a blot, stain, or veil within the subject’s field of vision: an apparition whose inert refusal to signify, or deliver meaning, turns the entire scenario on its head. In the presence of a gaze, things are no longer what they seemed. Everything is suspect and all bets are off as to what the future holds. When Strangers Marry is a film chock full of gazes, and gaze-structures: the unseen face of the man at the bar, the delayed letter from Fred to Mildred, the unfriendly and abrupt phone call from Paul to his new bride, the disappearance of the man from the cafeteria window, etc. Well-established in the Gothic genre, such blot-like devices actively confront both the protagonist and the viewer with a question they must work to answer, a problem that the narrative will ultimately resolve. However, a second, less obvious form of gaze appears in Castle’s film, pervading its mise-en-scène and defining the narrative’s status as film noir. The curtained window in Prescott’s hotel room is an example of this type of gaze, which takes the form of an actual veil, but more importantly for noir, a veil seen from the inside out. When Strangers Marry presents the viewer with two distinct modes of narrative, effectively halving the film along the lines of genre. Despite some stylistic blending and shared tropes, the first two acts of the film are largely Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nf ilm no ir as mediated goth ic 31 a Gothic melodrama, whereas the third act is unremittingly noir. The splice occurs when Mildred comes to sympathize with Paul, despite the fact that he may have committed the Philadelphia murder she has read about. Whereas we initially viewed the gaze/veil from the outside, alongside the confused Mildred, in later scenes we see it exclusively from the inside, as Mildred becomes Paul’s accomplice in evading the law. From the moment the two go on the lam to evade the New York homicide detectives who, at the behest of Lieutenant Blake (Neil Hamilton), have staked out Paul’s apartment, the viewer’s perspective shifts from the locked-out curiosity of the Gothic heroine to the portrayal of an “inside scoop” regarding a notorious noir murder case. This generic pivot point in the narrative is marked by Castle in a striking way: a kind of directorial autograph. When Paul leaves the apartment, he is neither arrested nor questioned by the two plainclothes homicide detectives standing by the door. Why? Because the photo Mildred has given to the police, in lieu of a photo of Paul, is a photo of William Castle himself. Lee Server calls this “an impudent Hitchcockian cameo,” but the crucial factor is that the cameo is a mediated one; Castle appears not as a pedestrian on the street, as Hitchcock does in many films, but instead in the form of a photograph, ostensibly a forgotten possession of the previous occupant of Paul’s apartment, spotted on the mantelpiece by Mildred in an earlier scene. To properly read this strange meta-textual moment requires us to put it in line with two others: the film-opening shot of the lion’s-head mask, which parodically references MGM, and the early scene when a hotel page walks through the lobby saying “Call for Mister King . . . Call for Mister King,” referencing the film’s producers, the King Brothers. Having established the film as referential, but in a semi-invisible way that only scholars and serious cinephiles will apprehend, Castle reserves the point of generic juncture, when Gothic becomes noir, for the appearance of his own face. In doing so, he certifies this moment of hybridity as authorial, as his own signature approach, but in a manner that accords with the surreptitiousness of a noir mastermind. Although other directors of the period were engaged in various forms of Gothic-noir hybridization, and I am thinking here especially of Gaslight, Bluebeard (1944), Experiment Perilous (1944), and Dark Waters (1944), Castle’s film, which debuted amidst this pack in August of 1944, is clearly the most noir in tone and aesthetics, as well as being the most aggressively hybridized. It would thus not be incorrect to claim that Castle either invented the form, or had a very strong role in establishing it, opening the door to later Gothic noirs such as The Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947), Secret Beyond the Door, Les Diaboliques (1955), Mulholland Dr., and the television series Dexter (2006). Beginning at the precise point when Castle’s photo deceives the police, Mildred (and the viewer as well) is no longer confounded by the uncanny Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n32 hu g h s . m ano n gaze of the Gothic, in which various punctiform objects, both visual and sonic, create a sense of incompleteness and alienation. Instead, the alliance of Mildred and Paul in their effort to flee New York conducts them through a broad series of encounters with the public eye—some overly suspicious, and others entirely oblivious to their presence. It is in these encounters that we become aware of a second type of gaze, a persecutory noir gaze that renders the entire urban landscape one of paranoia and threat, even and especially when things seem mundane and pedestrian. Two scenes are crucial in this regard: the couple’s encounter with a long-haul cab driver, and their brief respite in a Harlem jazz club. In each sequence, the noir-era slang term “spot” is an unspoken keyword; the stakes concern whether Paul and Mildred will be spotted (in other words “outed” for being the criminals they do not appear to be) either by police or the news reading public. Having decided to flee the city, Mildred and Paul go to a ride-share depot. The last car of the night is leaving for Louisville, and Mildred buys two tickets (Figure 1.2). When the driver (Billy Nelson) arrives, he is reading the daily newspaper as he walks through the door. He glances at Paul, then at the paper, then back at Paul. The driver and passengers depart. As they drive though the city, Mildred tries to appease the crying toddler of the visibly tired woman\n\nFigure 1.2 Mildred and Paul Baxter pay their fares at a New York ride-share depot in When Strangers Marry.\n\nNot for distribution or resale.

In an eye-line match shot, we see the newspaper item that concerns the driver: “KILLER ESCAPES: Description of Silk-Stocking Murderer Revealed By Police.” The prominently listed height, weight, eye color, etc., match Paul exactly. Paul fidgets in his seat, pulling down the brim of his hat. Suddenly, the tension of the child crying and the driver’s glare become too much. Paul demands that they stop; police sirens are heard. The scene underscores noir’s fascination with the epistemology of headline news through exaggeration. By virtue of just a few scant descriptions, the driver becomes unreasonably suspicious that the random man in his car is Paul Baxter, the murder suspect. However, in an epistemological reversal, the fact that we know the driver’s suspicions to be correct only underscores the tangential nature of the encounter, and the too-paranoid gaze of the driver. The message is not that everyone is a criminal in hiding, but that anyone we encounter could be. Here, writ large, is noir’s fantasy of unsuspicion—an invitation to the viewer to look and see what they are missing in everyday life.\n\nwit ne s s i ng w h i t e n e ss The sense of noir as a realm of adjacent, unsuspected conspiracy is reemphasized by Castle in the remarkable scene that follows, one which, I argue, is largely misinterpreted in existing scholarship. The couple exit the car in an unknown part of the city and get their bearings. Mildred and Paul, who are both white, encounter a series of people on the street: a woman in a black dress exits an alley; a soldier in his dress uniform entertains his date; a tall man smokes a cigarette while leaning in the doorway of a pool hall. All of these people are black, and it becomes clear that we are in post-renaissance Harlem, an African American cultural mecca well known to audiences of the 1940s. Distant sirens are heard, but only Mildred and Paul respond, quickening their pace and searching for a place to hide out. Boogie-woogie music wafts up to street level from a basement bar, Big Jim’s. They enter and the patrons of the bar glance up for a moment: who are these white people in the club? The attention of the patrons quickly dissipates as the couple sit down for a beer. Soon the music stops, with the police sirens now blaring at street level, evidently just outside. Everyone looks up as if there is going to be trouble. A newsboy comes down the steps and gleefully announces: “He’s won! He’s won! The champ’s here! Hooray for the champ!” Dressed in natty suits, a locally known boxer and his manager enter the club to the delight of the adoring club-goers. Mildred and Paul take this opportunity to exit, unseen by the crowd that has amassed around the champ.

For personal use only.\n\n34 hu g h s . m ano n of depicting black culture for a largely white mainstream audience, and in a manner that the developing conventions of the noir genre render non-tokenistic. Existing analyses of this sequence tend to interpret it as an unusually progressive depiction of black culture’s resiliency in a copacetic, ebullient community apart from its white oppressors. This perspective is perhaps best articulated by Frank Krutnik in his article “Something More than Night: Tales of the Noir City”: The scene overturns the containment of blacks as a servile minority in U.S. society—a situation personified in the porter who assists Millie on the train to New York—and it also casts Paul and Millie momentarily adrift from their own narrative, so they can bear witness to a self-contained social world that possesses a vitality and cohesion lacking in the America they know. Without offering the Harlem subculture as a template for the disordered society that Paul and Mille are in flight from, the film does use it as a significant barometer of that society’s disjunctions—as well as allowing a tantalizing glimpse of the city as a regime that accommodates multiple cultures.11 The problem with Krutnik’s analysis here is not that it is wrong, but that it is incomplete, especially vis-à-vis genre. Krutnik understands the scene strictly from the perspective of the two white interlopers, who “bear witness,” which is not at all what Castle’s mise-en-scène intends. To the contrary, it is the club-goers who are witnesses, albeit to a reality that they cannot (yet) see. Remarkably, the scene begins with a full thirty seconds of action in the club before Mildred and Paul enter. Smiling customers drink and dance; the camera sinuously tracks one dancing couple as they work their way over to chat with the piano player. No words are heard in the scene until the end, when the newsboy arrives. All meaning is conveyed via facial and bodily expression, as the enthusiasm of the dancers and onlookers contrasts with the alienated, furtive exchange of looks between Mildred and Paul. In a set of long shots, the two appear almost invisible in the back left corner of the room, the loud music having taken away their voices. From this use of camera and sound, we get the sense that Mildred and Paul are at once overwhelmed and entirely marginal; they do not fit in the picture they have entered. The space of the bar, like the street above, belongs to the black patrons, is “owned” by them, and the appearance of two white folks is at most a fleeting curiosity to the denizens of Lenox Avenue. Mildred and Paul are entirely surrounded by black culture, subsumed by it. Their diminutive presence itself is what strikes the viewer most. A series of long shots make the couple seem small and unimportant, a blot to the viewer, if not to the patrons, who go on with their revelry. In its binary of seeing and missing, with Mildred and Paul hiding in plain sight, the Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nf ilm no ir as mediated goth ic 35 scene does not exist to exoticize black culture, or to put it on display, so much as it requires the viewer to “bear witness” to whiteness as such. However, there is more to this arrangement than its effort to nominate whiteness as race, and this secondary meaning, as with all things noir, bears on the epistemology of headline news, a factor that the scene’s conclusion makes explicit. Mildred and Paul’s out-of-place-ness is subtly underscored by the fact that the bar is full of music, improvised by the piano player in a live performance, but until the newsboy arrives, Big Jim’s is utterly devoid of any trace of media: no radio, no jukebox, and no telephone can be seen. Perhaps this is the real reason why Mildred and Paul are so ill at ease; the abundantly evident cultural differences between blackness and whiteness are not their primary problem, but instead the fact that the scene is too im-mediate, too non-electronic and real, and the couple thus find themselves out of their (mediated) element. In a provocative thought-experiment, it may be useful to consider Castle’s scene at Big Jim’s as a race-inverted parallel to the two famous scenes at Jerry’s supermarket in Wilder’s Double Indemnity. In these scenes, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) and Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) meet “sort of accidentally on purpose,” and in plain view of the public eye, to plot and then cover up the murder of Phyllis’s husband. In the scenes at Jerry’s, numerous shoppers pass by the conspiratorial couple, but the shoppers are so focused on their day-to-day activities that they do not so much as glance at Phyllis and Walter. However, it should also be noted that literally every patron of Jerry’s supermarket is white, a fact which, given the period, does not strike the viewer as remarkable. The scene cannot, then, be a true racial inversion of the scene at Big Jim’s, because this would entail Phyllis and Walter being the lone black shoppers in the store. Were this the case, their whispered communiqués surely would arouse suspicion. As the scene stands, and in light of what we see in Castle’s film, it becomes clear that Double Indemnity’s two white co-conspirators are exnominated (i.e. not “named out” as such), both in their status as white, and in their status as murderer and accomplice. This thought experiment highlights the racial/political departure of Castle’s scene at Big Jim’s. By situating his white protagonists as “other,” whiteness itself becomes a kind of stain: what are these white folks doing in Harlem? The black patrons initially notice Mildred and Paul for their whiteness as such, but in a crucial second step, after a few moments the couple is left alone with their beers. Despite the weirdly antisocial, downbeat behavior of Mildred and Paul at the club, in effect nothing comes of their whiteness. The point of comparing Castle’s scene to analogous ones in Double Indemnity is not to say that, in terms of their depictions of race, Castle is more progressive than Wilder because Castle dares to include a scene in a Harlem club. Rather, to the extent that Castle’s scene depicts a progressive leveling of race, or sense Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n36 hu g h s . m ano n of humanistic equality, the scene effectuates this racial leveling in tandem with noir’s obsession with the pre-retrospective epistemology of front page news. By “pre-retrospective,” I simply mean that the entire scene forecasts a future conversation amongst the patrons of Big Jim’s, one that will take place immediately after the following day’s newspaper hits the stands. We can imagine one of the patrons, or maybe the bartender, paper in hand, accosting the waiter: “Hey, remember those white folks who came in here last night? You served them beers. I think that guy was the Silk Stocking murderer!” The fact that the scene at Big Jim’s is resolved by the appearance of a newsboy lends credence to this interpretation. The point of the scene is that two news stories are co-present, both available to the eye, but only one of them, the arrival of the champ, is properly apprehended by the club’s patrons. The second story, that is to say the noir story, will only come into focus with the arrival of the morning edition. In the moment of its happening, Paul and Mildred’s flight from the police is gazed at by the club patrons, but not seen. In this respect, as newsreaders and unknowing witnesses, black people and white people are depicted as "
