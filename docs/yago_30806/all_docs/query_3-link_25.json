        "text": "Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel (February 28, 1906 â€“ June 20, 1947) was an American mobster. Siegel was known as one of the most \"infamous and feared gangsters of his day\". Described as handsome and charismatic, he became one of the first front-page celebrity gangsters. He was also a driving force behind the development of the Las Vegas Strip. Siegel was not only influential within the Jewish mob but, like his friend and fellow gangster Meyer Lansky, he also held significant influence within the American Mafia and the largely Italian-Jewish National Crime Syndicate. Siegel was one of the founders and leaders of Murder, Inc. and became a bootlegger during the Prohibition. After the Twenty-first Amendment was passed repealing Prohibition in 1933, he turned to gambling. In 1936, he left New York and moved to California. His time as a mobster (although he eventually ran his own operations) was mainly as a hitman and muscle, as he was noted for his prowess with guns and violence. In 1939, Siegel was tried for the murder of fellow mobster Harry Greenberg. He was acquitted in 1942. Siegel traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he handled and financed some of the original casinos. He assisted developer William R. Wilkerson's Flamingo Hotel after Wilkerson ran out of funds. Siegel took over the project and managed the final stages of construction. The Flamingo opened on December 26, 1946, to poor reception and soon closed. It reopened in March 1947 with a finished hotel. Three months later, on June 20, 1947, Siegel was shot dead at the home of his girlfriend, Virginia Hill, in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nDavid Niven, a name synonymous with the golden age of Hollywood, was born on March 1, 1910, in London, England. He was a charismatic and versatile actor who became one of the most recognizable faces in film during the mid-20th century. Niven's early life was marked by adversity; he lost his father during World War I and was expelled from several schools. Despite these challenges, he managed to secure a place at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, which set the stage for his future career. Niven joined the British army upon graduation but left in the mid-1930s to pursue an acting career. His charm and good looks quickly caught the attention of Hollywood producers, and he made his film debut in 1935. Over the next three decades, Niven starred in over ninety films, including classics like The Pink Panther, Around the World in 80 Days, and Separate Tables, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. His roles were marked by his quintessential Englishness, which made him a favorite among American audiences. Aside from his acting career, Niven demonstrated remarkable courage during World War II. He returned to the British army and served with distinction, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war, he resumed his acting career and also became a successful author, penning two witty and candid autobiographies. David Niven passed away on July 29, 1983, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire actors and audiences alike."
