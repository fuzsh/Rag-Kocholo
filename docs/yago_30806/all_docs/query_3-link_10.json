        "text": "Linda J. Alexander grew up with the 'seventies entertainment scene, fascinated by people on TV and in the movies, as well as characters in those romance novels she couldn't put down. After doing the hustle, watching \"The Mod Squad,\" and listening to the Monkees and Herman's Hermits on her Duster's car radio, eventually she interviewed and wrote about many of those entertainment figures. She also discovered a fascination for Hollywood's Golden Era when romance was romantic, stories had serious plot--and the political world worked much the same as it does today.\n\nLinda now entertains others with her writing. The most recent of 8 published books is THE LIFE AND DEATH OF RISING STAR STEVE IHNAT - GONE TOO SOON, out in August 2018 ... the biography of TV and movie actor, Steve Ihnat.\n\nLt. Mims from The Outer Limits' show, \"The Inheritors.\" Barney Benesch from Madigan with Richard Widmark. Steve Ihnat was on countless TV shows and in movies in the '60s and '70s. His gem was Garth of Izar from Star Trek's \"Whom Gods Destroy.” Trekkies recall his tormented portrayal of the Starship captain.\n\nIn ‘67, he was on the edge of stardom. He wrote and directed movies; his personal life was all he’d ever wanted. Five years later, he was dead. An international man from his birth in Czechoslovakia, to his home country, Canada, to his adopted country, the USA, Steve’s life was mysterious. Not even he could’ve written the script. Today he stars in a lasting enigma, The Life and Death of Rising Star Steve Ihnat - Gone Too Soon.\n\nRELUCTANT WITNESS: ROBERT TAYLOR, HOLLYWOOD & COMMUNISM came out in 2008. It tells the story of Robert Taylor, one of Hollywood's most handsome leading men of all times, from small-town Nebraska roots to his death in 1969. Taylor's most defining moment was a subpoenaed appearance in front of 1947's House Un-American Activities Committee in response to a tangible fear of Communism in the United States. He was as popular as Ronald Reagan and even John Wayne, yet today is incorrectly remembered most as the actor who \"named names.\" Linda's book sets the record straight.\n\nLinda has published a number of other nonfiction books, in addition to two novels of dark, sexy intrigue--UNTIL NEXT TIME and WEEKENDS IN NEW ENGLAND. UNTIL NEXT TIME is expected to be re-published in in the near future.\n\nFor more information on Linda, her books, or public speaking engagements, please contact her press representative, William Scherer, MBSTIA, Inc., at 240-205-8664 or via e-mail at williamATmbstia.com."
