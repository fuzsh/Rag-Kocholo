        "text": "This is a 1961 Lydia Lane article. Enjoy!\n\nWhen I was lunching with Robert Taylor and his wife Ursula Thiess at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we became unpleasantly aware of a lady with a very penetrating voice. When she left the room, we were relieved and Bob commented, “Voices are extremely important, but it seems that those who sound the worst talk the most. And those who talk the most give least thought to what they are saving. “I find a soft, well-modulated voice most appealing,” he added as he looked across the table at his beautiful wife. “Ursula’s voice has always intrigued me. That is one of the things that I liked about her when we met.” “What else attracted you to her?” I asked. “I like a clean scrubbed look a clear complexion,” he replied. “It was the fashion in Hollywood to wear a lot of make-up, and then Ingrid Bergman came with her clean skin and fresh look, and I thought how much more attractive she was having a healthy glow. Ursula had that scrubbed look and I thought she was one of the most beautiful women I’d ever seen. “But beauty has to be accompanied with poise and intelligence, because you soon get tired of a face with nothing be- hind it.” I knew that Robert Taylor had worked and lived in Europe and that Ursula is German, and so I asked how European girls were different from Americans. “There is a big difference in background and training,” he replied. “In America we needed women suffrage but somehow a woman loses something when she competes with a man in his home. The job she does during the day may be equally important as his, but when a man comes home, she should make him feel that he comes first. I think it is the secret of femininity assuring a man if of his masculinity. “And if a man is normal, he’s going to appreciate a wife thinking of her appearance.;’ he added. “It is a mistake for a woman to be careless about this.\n\n“Appearance in either sex is important. It helps your self-assurance. I like the outdoors. I like to ride, fish and shoot, and by exercising through the years I’ve kept fit. I can still wear suits I had made 20 years ago. If a belt feels tight, I knock off a few calories – no toast for breakfast, and eat less of everything. The big mistake is to let yourself go so that you have violent swings in weight. It is not good for you to go up and down.” I told Ursula that she had succeeded in getting her figure back nicely after having babies. “I worked out in a gym. I went every morning and lifted weights. I only had 10 pounds to take off, but I wanted my body to be firm. When I came back to work on Bob’s “The Detectives’, series, I didn’t have a figure problem to worry about. “I allow two or three pounds for normal fluctuation, but if I gain above that I cut down immediately on what I eat. It is easy to lose a pound that you’ve just put on. That is why I like to weigh every morning,” she explained. Bod had an appointment and left the table and I told Ursula. “You’ve made him so happy.” He heard me and came back. “Yes, she has, and I didn’t mention to you what a talent Ursula has for domesticity. She is a perfect housekeeper and she seems to enjoy it.” “My mother was a good example,” she confided. “You can’t always do in this world what you enjoy, she told me, and so you must learn to enjoy what you have to do.” I had been looking at Ursula’s long eyelashes. They were fascinating and I told her that it was hard to believe they were real. “I use a waterproof mascara and always remove it with oil. I think lashes often break from dryness,” Ursula observed. In parting Ursula mentioned that she and Bob were fond of colognes. “I think it is so important for both the man and wife to have a nice scent about them. And I think if a husband doesn’t buy shaving cologne, the wife should get it for him,” she concluded."
