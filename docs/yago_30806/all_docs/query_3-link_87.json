        "text": "Amanda's Cinema Survey\n\nI finally got around to tackling the yearly survey from Amanda of A Noodle in a Haystack. It was lots of fun. Thanks for putting this together Amanda:\n\n1. What is your favorite movie starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, excluding all of The Thin Man films?\n\nLove Crazy (1941) is hilarious. The first time I saw it, I couldn't believe I hadn’t heard of it before. Why isn’t it a huge classic?\n\n2. Name a screen team that appeared in only one film together but are still noteworthy for how well they complimented each other.\n\nIt was great luck that Carole Lombard and Cary Grant had the chance to work together in In Name Only (1939)\n\n3. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' best film together?\n\nSwing Time (1936)\n\n4. Your favorite actor named \"Robert\"?\n\nRobert Mitchum\n\n5. An actor/actress who, when you see one of their movies, you always wish that someone else was in his/her role?\n\nI don’t get Greer Garson.\n\n6. An actor/actress that someone close to you really loves that you can't stand or vice versa?\n\nMy husband doesn't get Kim Novak, but I adore her.\n\n7. An actor/actress that you both agree on completely?\n\nMy husband is on board with me about James Cagney. He didn’t like him much personally after reading his autobiography though. I told him, he’s an actor, they have big egos!\n\n8. Complete this sentence: Virginia O'Brien is to Ethel Merman as...\n\nHedy Lamarr is to Paulette Goddard (I based my choice on facial expressiveness--is that a word?)\n\n9. What is your favorite film starring Ray Milland?\n\nThe Univited (1944), I liked him as a romantic hero.\n\n10. You had to have seen this one coming: what is your favorite movie of the 1960s?\n\nLa Dolce Vita (1960)\n\n11. An actor/actress that you would take out of one film and put into a different movie that was released the same year?\n\nI would have loved to have seen Marilyn Monroe star in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) . I thought Audrey Hepburn was a great Holly Golightly, and it has long been one of my favorite movies, but I always wonder how Monroe would have approached the role.\n\n12. Who was your favorite of Robert Montgomery's leading ladies?\n\nMs. Shearer\n\n13. You think it would have been a disaster if what movie starred the actor/actress who was originally asked to star in it?\n\nHedy Lamarr in Casablanca (1942) *shudder* (I do like Hedy Lamarr—in the right role)\n\n14. An actor/actress who you will watch in any or almost any movie?\n\nCary Grant (almost Bette Davis, but I can’t bring myself to watch all of Wicked Stepmother (1989))\n\n15. Your favorite Leslie Howard film and role?\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)\n\n16. You have been asked to host a marathon of four Barbara Stanwyck films. Which ones do you choose?\n\nBaby Face (1933), The Lady Eve (1941), Double Indemnity (1944),The Furies (1950)\n\n17. What is, in your mind, the nearest to perfect comedy you have ever seen? Why?\n\nMy Man Godfrey (1936), because the cast selection, timing and quips were all so perfectly executed.\n\n18. You will brook no criticism of what film?\n\nOh many! Maybe just classics overall.\n\n19. Who is your favorite Irish actress?\n\nMaureen O’Sullivan. Girl-next-door with a hint of glamour.\n\n20. Your favorite 1940s movie starring Ginger Rogers?\n\nI’ll Be Seeing You (1944) was beautiful and heart-wrenching.\n\n21. Do you enjoy silent movies?\n\nYes! Especially comedies.\n\n22. What is your favorite Bette Davis film?\n\nAll About Eve (1950)\n\n23. Your favorite onscreen Hollywood couple?\n\nMyrna Loy and William Powell--they always seemed to enjoy each other's company.\n\n24. This one is for the girls, but, of course, the guys are welcome to answer, too: who is your favorite Hollywood costume designer?\n\nAdrian--he helped to make actresses like Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow and Garbo look like goddesses.\n\n25. To even things out a bit, here's something the boys will enjoy: what is your favorite tough action film?\n\nThe Most Dangerous Game (1932)\n\n26. You are currently gaining a greater appreciation for which actor(s)/actress(es)?\n\nAlain Delon\n\n27. Franchot Tone: yes or no?\n\nYes, based on I Love Trouble (1948).\n\n28. Which actors and/or actresses do you think are underrated?\n\nVeronica Lake\n\n29. Which actors and/or actresses do you think are overrated?\n\nGreer Garson\n\n30. Favorite actor?\n\nCary Grant\n\n31. Favorite actress?\n\nBette Davis\n\n32. Of those listed, who is the coolest: Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Steve McQueen, or Patrick Stewart?\n\nIf we’re just talking cool—McQueen\n\n33. What is your favorite movie from each of these genres:\n\nComedy: My Man Godfrey (1936)\n\nSwashbuckler: The Crimson Pirate (1952)\n\nFilm noir: Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nMusical: Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)\n\nHoliday: Remember the Night (1940)\n\nHitchcock: I suppose Hitchcock is a genre! Notorious (1946)\n\nHere's the link to the survey if you'd like to give it a shot, but note that Amanda will only be posting results for one more week.\n\nGreat Quotes: Tough Dames and Femme Fatales\n\nI’ve wanted to do another favorite quote post for some time, and this clip from the film noir 99 River Street (1953) finally inspired me to get it together.\n\nThis marvelously tense scene is equally frightening and sensual. Evelyn Keyes tries to seduce a dangerous-looking man—and she doesn’t seem to be at all concerned by the murderous look in his eyes. She is confident that she has power over him, a sentiment she makes clear with this suggestively cooed closing line:\n\nI don’t believe in sometime. With me, it’s now or never.\n\nTough noir dames and femme fatales always have the best lines. In this particular flick, Keyes is actually a decent gal just posing as a dangerous lady so that she can help the leading man, but she’s pretty darn convincing.\n\nHere’s a few more that I’m fond of:\n\nBart, I've been kicked around all my life, and from now on, I'm gonna start kicking back.\n\n-Peggy Cummins in Gun Crazy AKA Deadly is the Female (1950)\n\nYou're not strong or weak enough.\n\n-Marie Windsor in Force of Evil (1948)\n\nI don't go to church. Kneeling bags my nylons.\n\n-Jan Sterling in Ace in the Hole (1951)\n\nIt isn't fair. I never had anybody but you. Not a real husband. Not even a man. Just a bad joke without a punch line.\n\n-Marie Windsor in The Killing (1956)\n\nSay who do you think you're talking to - a hick? Listen Mister, I been around, and I know a wrong guy when I see one. What'd you do, kiss him with a wrench?\n\n-Ann Savage in Detour (1945)\n\nYou shouldn't kiss a girl when you're wearing that gun... leaves a bruise\n\n-Claire Trevor in Murder, My Sweet (1945)\n\n. . . the lie was in the way I said it, not at all in what I said. It's my own fault if you can't believe me now.\n\n-Mary Astor in The Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nFour Things I Learned from Jackie Cooper’s Autobiography\n\nI recently got a screaming deal on a copy of Please Don’t Shoot My Dog: The Autobiography of Jackie Cooper. Though I had only seen him in The Champ (1931) and a few Little Rascals shorts, I’d always wanted to learn more about Cooper. I knew that he had built a successful, lasting career in Hollywood—both in front of and behind the camera--and I hoped that meant that he had a happier story to tell than the typical child star.\n\nWhile Cooper did have the inevitable difficulties associated with working young and dealing with the pressures of stardom, not to mention some nasty family troubles, his story is for the most part an even balance between the bitter and the sweet. Having a handful of good mentors and a loving, intelligent mother did much to point him in the right direction.\n\nSince I’d always envisioned a little boy whenever I thought of Cooper, I was surprised to read about some of the big boy things he was up to after his initial rise to fame. Here are the tidbits I found most interesting about his post-childhood life:\n\n1. He had quite a way with the ladies.\n\nFor some reason, the former star of Skippy was irresistible to women. I had no idea that this book with the weepy child on the front would be so racy. From a slightly older neighbor across the street who gave him “lessons” as a tween, to a secret, bizarre affair with Joan Crawford when he was seventeen—this guy had no trouble sowing his oats. This is not to say he was a womanizer, he counts his girlfriends and wives as the most significant friendships in his life. Judy Garland was his first love, and he enjoyed a close, but chaste teenage romance with fellow former child actor Bonita Granville.\n\n2. and 3. He was the star of two successful television comedies,\n\nThe People's Choice and Hennesey—though he didn’t care much for either of them. Cooper didn’t ever seem to hurt for work, but he had high standards for himself, and struggled to find meaningful projects. He was particularly chagrined to play second fiddle to a wisecracking Bassett Hound in The People’s Choice (I don’t think it was that bad. The dog wasn’t even in every scene.):\n\nHennesey was a Navy comedy--which was appropriate for Cooper because he'd worn the uniform for real during the war. I couldn't find a clip but here’s a slideshow with scenes from the show and pictures of its stars—the jaunty tune is the theme song:\n\n4. He was an accomplished drum player.\n\nCooper enjoyed the escape of playing music, and he dabbled in drumming for years. During World War II, he played in a USO band and as a civilian, he was deemed worthy enough to jam with several nightclub combos. Here he accompanies singer/dancer Dagmar in a 1953 episode of the explosively popular Buick-Berle Show:\n\nImage Source\n\nPatricia Neal, 1926-2010\n\nGoodbye to Patricia Neal. I couldn’t stand her the first time I saw her—as a sophisticated sugar mama in Breakfast at Tiffanys (1961). That voice drove me crazy. Then, it grew on me, and it became the thing I like most about her. I realized she had been so darn good in Tiffanys that I hadn’t been able to separate her from her character, and that voice was the most distinctive thing about her.\n\nI know Hud (1963) was her big award-winning role, but I loved her in The Fountainhead (1949); it was satisfying to watch her play that wild-eyed over-the-top character. Not that she was ever capable of fading into the woodwork. Even in a movie like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), where she is only meant to prop up a host of sci-fi wonders, she grabs your attention. She projected such intelligence and strength that she could never be simply a damsel in distress. And I can’t forget A Face in the Crowd (1957)—she was the soul of that movie, an increasingly lucid force for good in a swirl of rottenness.\n\nHere are some tributes I grabbed from my feed:\n\nThe Guardian always puts together such moving memorials--\n\nObituary\n\nFilm clips\n\nDavid Thomson tribute\n\nAnd a few more--\n\nIMDB\n\nSelf-Styled Siren\n\nMotion Picture Gems\n\nI'm sure there will be many more fine tributes as the day progresses.\n\nImage Source\n\nThe Hilariously Offbeat Dialogue of Deadline at Dawn (1946)\n\nDeadline at Dawn (1946) is finally available on DVD—and I’m so glad its purple prose is now readily available to the masses. I saw this offbeat noir flick for the first time in a theater—and the over-the-top dialogue made the audience giggle so much that I thought I must have missed half of what the actors were saying.\n\nI don’t mean to disrespect the movie, because it’s a great mystery, with interesting twists, appealing actors and even some well-executed touching moments, but that Clifford Odets script is nutty. People just don’t talk the way he writes. If you Google “purple prose Odets”—you’ll find that I’m not the only one who feels this way.\n\nOdets was best known for his association with the adventurous Group Theater in the 1930s. He wrote most of his works for the stage—the most famous being Golden Boy (which made it to the big screen as well)—but he also wrote a few memorable screenplays, including Humoresque (1946) and the snarky Sweet Smell of Success (1957).\n\nOf all of Odets’ screenplays, I have the most affection for Deadline at Dawn. It’s the sweetest-tempered noir I’ve ever seen and a loveable mutt of a movie. The dialogue may make me laugh, but it is its own brand of clever and extremely entertaining.\n\nThe story is of a sailor (Bill Williams) on shore leave who finds himself mixed up in a murder. A weary taxi dancer (Susan Hayward) and a wordy taxi driver (Paul Lukas) try to help him clear his name.\n\nI had to share some of the incredible things these characters say. The taxi driver had the craziest lines:\n\nA blind man could see how many boyfriends she had. Evidently the water tasted good so she jumped down the well.\n\nStop zigging when we should be zagging and zagging when we should be zigging.\n\nRemember Alex, speech was given to man to hide his thoughts.\n\nGolly Wolly it’s hot tonight.\n\nStatistics tell us we’ll see the stars again.\n\nI read all the incriminating papers you are looking for and I bunked them away like a squirrel.\n\nMr. Bartelli the bedbugs will never forgive you. Your skin is made of iron.\n\nBetween you and me and the lamppost captain, happiness is no laughing matter.\n\n[His advice to a pair of lovers] Push through the daily shell shock of life together.\n\nThe dancer's lines are slightly less outrageous:\n\nThis is New York, where hello means goodbye.\n\nYou’d better drop down on your bendified knees and pray.\n\nHe was nervous like every butcher, baker and candlestick-maker in the town.\n\nAnd the rest:\n\nIf she cut off her head, she’d be very pretty.\n\n-Val, the conman (Joseph Calleia)\n\nShe was no lullaby, but she had the brains like a man.\n\n-Val\n\nGee, time takes so long and it goes so fast.\n\n-Sailor\n\nFor some reason, this exchange really cracked me up:\n\nSailor: Do you hear anything?\n\nDancer: Only your breathing.\n\nSailor: Is that what that is?\n\nImage Sources: Poster, Odets Photo"
