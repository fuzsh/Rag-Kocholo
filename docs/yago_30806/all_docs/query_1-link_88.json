        "text": "1954\n\nWritten by Douglas Heyes, Samuel J. Jacoby, Robert E. Kent, Jesse Lasky Jr., and DeVallon Scott\n\nDirected by William Castle\n\nThis film is Untouchabullcrap!\n\nOne casualty of the modern movie landscape is the dearth of swashbuckler films. Like westerns and original musicals, swashbucklers were a product of an earlier age, the type of stories that we’re told won’t fit in with modern sensibilities. And while the three genres have slowed to a trickle, there are notable examples of all of them in recent years. The flow may not be strong, but it is still bubbling up water.\n\nI wish I could say The Iron Glove was a thirst-quenching example from yesteryear, but, alas, it’s actually rancid gunk not fit for a beast! This is a shame, as director William Castle (House on Haunted Hill, 13 Ghosts, The Tingler) had the ability to craft a good tale, even if he did lean towards theater gimmicks to promote his flicks. The Iron Glove is filled with low production values, the walking scenes and the speaking closeups are so obviously filmed at different times that the viewer becomes uncomfortable and begins to squirm in their seat with unease. Something is wrong, something off. Almost no character moves while talking for the entire film, they walk, stop, closeup, talk.\n\nLet’s not even get into Robert Stack’s accent being all over the map…it’s Irish usually, when he remembers, but sometimes it’s Scottish or it drops out entirely. Robert Stack seems like he’d be a natural for the hero role. Known to people my age as the host of Unsolved Mysteries, to my parents as the guy from The Untouchables, and to kids today as that one guy from Airplane!, Stack was a perfect old school leading man. He looked tough, strong, and the type of guys ladies would swoon for. Playing a super-talented honorable swordsman fighting for a losing cause should be a sure-fire win. But then he opens his mouth and talks with the ridiculous accent, and it all falls apart. Shot under the working title The Kiss and the Sword, producer Sam Katzman had wanted Cornel Wilde for the title role. But he was busy setting up his own company, thus enter Stack, who reportedly wasn’t too fond of this production.\n\n18th century hipsters\n\nThe setting for The Iron Glove (please note that I do not recall an iron glove appearing in the film besides the title card) is when James Stuart was battling for the English throne in the 18th century. The setting is one of those historical settings that I don’t think most Americans would have given a crap about, no matter how much Stack tells us how super cool James Stuart is. The historical accuracy is rather thin, though they do get a bit of the basics right, and the Polish Princess Stuart ends up marrying becomes a plot point. But Braveheart this ain’t, the King of England isn’t painted as a crazed psychopath, just a jerk, whose efforts seem based on keeping another jerk from having the throne. The failure to get us to even cheer for the hero’s side is another failure of The Iron Glove.\n\nWhat The Iron Glove does get right is the use of color. It’s a very bright film, looking a lot like the type of 60s adventures Disney would later make. Producer Sam Katzman wanted Cornel Wilde to play Charles Wogan, but he was busy creating his own production company. Thus, Robert Stack.\n\nOh, sir, phallic symbol me away!"
