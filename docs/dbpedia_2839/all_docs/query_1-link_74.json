        "text": "Page Content\n\nKaren Virag\n\n\"No amount of testing will ever make anyone a better teacher,\" states Noreen O'Haire, ATA co-ordinator of professional development, when asked to comment on plans by the Ontario government to institute a teacher-testing program.\n\nIndeed, O'Haire's comment is borne out by any number of studies, none of which has ever proven that the practice of testing teachers to get rid of the so-called bad ones has ever achieved even a modicum of success. To illustrate her point, O'Haire points to teacher-testing endeavours in the U.S., where results have been questionable at best. Two American states—Arkansas and Texas—attempted to institute a teacher-testing program; in each case, the programs were so disastrous, they were discontinued. An independent evaluation of the Texas program noted many unforeseen and unfortunate consequences: enormous cost, demoralized teachers embarrassed at the negative portrayal of their profession, and a public unimpressed with the high pass rate why waste millions of dollars when 99 percent of teachers tested passed? Concomitant issues include the prospect of new teachers being discouraged from entering the profession and the possibility of minority teachers scoring less well due to testing bias. An expert quoted in Phi Delta Kappan noted that most licensing tests are basically multiple-choice tests of basic skills and knowledge that are \"widely criticized by educators and experts as woefully inadequate to measure teaching skill,\" and a Massachusetts body notes that tests simply are incapable of predicting if those who pass will be good or bad teachers.\n\nCanadian educators can only hope that governments peruse these studies before going ahead with any teacher-testing plans of their own.\n\nO'Haire notes that the ATA does believe in teacher testing, but also believes that these things are best addressed by ongoing professional development programs and comprehensive policies and procedures for ensuring teacher growth, support and evaluation. This approach, says O'Haire, \"does more than testing ever could to ensure teacher preparedness and competence.\" First, O'Haire says, all teachers in Alberta must have an individual professional growth plan that addresses aspects of their teaching profession, which they wish to improve. For example, the plan may focus on curriculum, integration of technology or the implication of brain research on teaching. The second part of the ATA program involves ongoing supervision of teachers by principals, the provision of support and guidance and the identification of behaviours or practices that may require evaluation. At the third, evaluative stage of the program, principals identify, in writing, any areas for improvement.\n\nAccording to O'Haire, this tri-part professional growth program, which is supported in Alberta Learning policy, uses a professional, and not a punitive, model for teacher development.\n\nO'Haire also notes the somewhat insulting subtext of the Ontario proposal—it implies that post-secondary faculties of education are not doing their job. And to stir even more flies into the ointment, Marilies Rettig, current president of the Canadian Teachers' Federation, notes that the Ontario College of Teachers recently surveyed over 30 self-regulating professional bodies in that province, including physicians, lawyers and engineers. None, she says, require their members to take a written test to retain their licenses. \"Practice reviews are among the preferred methods of assessing performance in other professions,\" she says. \"The counterpart in teaching is a regular performance appraisal conducted by the school principal.\"\n\nAs we all know, good teachers bring many unquantifiable skills and talents to work every day, and some educators are pressed to wonder how the Ontario government plans to measure a teacher's ability to empathize, care, create a safe and caring classroom, communicate with students and parents, integrate special needs kids into the classroom, collaborate, create or inspire."
