        "text": "1994\n\nThe report of the Royal Commission on Learning, For the Love of Learning, recommended teachers in Ontario regulate their profession.\n\n1996\n\nThe government proclaimed the Ontario College of Teachers Act July 5, creating the College, with a mandate to:\n\nlicense teachers in Ontario\n\nset and maintain professional standards for the teaching profession\n\nimplement a disciplinary process\n\naccredit teacher education programs.\n\nThe legislation established a 31-member Council of 17 elected members of the College and 14 members of the public appointed by the provincial government. The size and makeup were modified in 2006 to 37 Council members - 23 elected members and 14 members of the public.\n\n1997\n\nOn May 20, we opened our doors and began handling all public teaching applications in Ontario. Notable firsts included:\n\n165,000 members’ records transferred from the Ministry of Education\n\na public registry of all public school teachers\n\ndevelopment of the Professional Misconduct Regulation in cooperation with the provincial government\n\na pilot project (through to 2000) to review Ontario’s teacher education programs\n\nwe predicted a shortfall of teachers, and worked with the Minister’s Task Force on Teacher Recruitment and Renewal, leading to the creation of an additional 1,500 spots in Ontario’s teacher education programs\n\nthe first issues of the College’s magazine Professionally Speaking and Pour Parler Profession were published\n\nwe successfully defended the quality of teaching in Ontario, by recommending that non-certified instructors not be put in classrooms, something proposed in the Education Quality Improvement Act.\n\n1998\n\nWe held our first public disciplinary hearing.\n\nWe introduced a criminal record check for all applicants.\n\n1999\n\nThe Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession became part of our bylaws.\n\nWe introduced language fluency requirements (English and French) and mandatory criminal record checks for new teachers.\n\n2000\n\nWe presented our study, Maintaining, Ensuring and Demonstrating Competency in the Teaching Profession to the provincial government.\n\nThe Ethical Standards for the Teaching Profession became part of our bylaws.\n\n2001\n\nThe College launched a five-year study to track teacher experiences, leading to the creation of our annual Transition to Teaching reports and a policy paper, Growing into the Profession.\n\n2002\n\nWe assumed responsibility for accrediting all teacher education programs in Ontario.\n\nWe released our first Professional Advisory, Professional Misconduct Related to Sexual Abuse and Misconduct (updated in 2019).\n\n2003\n\nThe College established the Joseph W.
