The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in Room SD-106, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Tom Harkin, chairman of the committee, presiding. Present: Senator Harkin, Mikulski, Casey, Hagan, Merkley, Franken, Bennet, Goodwin, Enzi, Alexander, Burr, and Isakson. Opening Statement of Senator Harkin The Chairman. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order. This is the second in a series of hearings by this committee focusing on the growing Federal investment in for- profit colleges and universities. This industry has grown at an extraordinary pace. Over the last 10 years, enrollment has increased from 600,000 students to over 2 million students. Federal financial aid to students at for-profit colleges has ballooned from $4.6 billion a decade ago to more than $23 billion a year, today. The question is: What is driving the explosive growth in this industry? As you may know, I also chair the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Pell grant program. And CBO has given me some figures here that are quite startling. For example, in 2006, our obligation on Pell grants was $12,826,000,000. Last year, it was $26 billion, next year it will go to $30 billion--$30.6 billion that our Appropriations Committee will have to come up with just to fund the Pell grant program. And so, this explosive growth at a time where we have huge deficits, and we're trying to get our budgets in order, causes us real concern. The question we have to ask with this explosive growth, and with CBO estimates that over the next 10 years we'll spend somewhere close to $300 billion to $350 billion just on Pell grants, we have to ask the question, Are the students--and the U.S. taxpayers--getting a good value for the billions of taxpayers dollars they are investing in these for-profit schools? In our first hearing, in June, this committee heard testimony from witnesses about the pressures for for-profit companies to relentlessly enroll more students in order to increase profits and, in the case of publicly traded companies, to meet the expectations of investors. The committee issued a report showing that, in order to boost recruitment, many publicly traded for-profit schools spend huge sums of title IV dollars. Title IV dollars, which are taxpayer dollars. They spend a huge amount on TV advertisements, billboards, phone solicitations, and Web marketing, and as we shall see shortly, an aggressive sales staff. According to the Chairman's report, an analysis of the eight publicly traded schools shows that, on average, they spend 31 percent of revenues on recruiting and marketing. Thirty-one percent. This spending by for-profit schools sets them radically apart from other colleges. By contrast, community colleges typically spend just 1 or 2 percent on marketing; a tiny fraction of the money spent by publicly traded for-profits. However numbers only tell a part of the story. Much can be revealed, too, by the experience that students, who are perhaps the first in their family to go to college, have when they sit down to talk to a recruiter or admissions officer. That is why I asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate this key encounter during the recruitment process at for-profit institutions. GAO's findings make it disturbingly clear that abuses in for-profit recruiting are not limited to a few rogue recruiters or even a few schools with lax oversight. To the contrary, the evidence points to a problem that is systemic to the for-profit industry: a recruitment process specifically designed to do whatever it takes to drive up enrollment numbers, more often than not to the disadvantage of students. There is a cruel irony, here, that deserves special focus. One ostensibly admirable aspect of for-profit colleges is that they seek out and enroll large numbers of minority and low- income students, offering them opportunities they might not have. In choosing to enroll in a for-profit college, these students typically go deeply into debt. They make other sacrifices, all in search of a better life. They need information that is clear, complete, and honest. Instead, too often, they are victims of deceptive and/or abusive marketing tactics. In our first hearing, we learned that for-profit schools are enrolling huge numbers of new students, but their total current enrollment numbers show only a small increase, which seems to point to an extremely high dropout rate. For example, one publicly traded school had 84,555 students as of March 31 of this year. They enrolled 21,673 new students between April 1 and June 30, but ended June with 84,695 students, a gain of only 140 students. What happened to the other 21,533? Did they all graduate in 3 months? Or did they drop out? Reports for the past year show that this school turns over between 22 and 25 percent of their student population every 3 months. Every 3 months. Why are such large numbers of students turning over, and presumably dropping out? Are they leaving the schools with debt and no degree? How can that be happening in such large numbers? The testimony this morning from Mr. Gregory Kutz of the Government Accountability Office will begin to answer these questions. Our second panel will allow us to hear directly from a former recruiter for a large for-profit school. He will offer us insight into the training and supervision systems that foster the deceptive and misleading recruiting tactics that are all too common at these schools. We will also hear from an admissions counseling expert, who will contrast the recruiting policies and practices at non-profit and public colleges with those at for-profit schools. Finally, we will hear from the executive director of a national accrediting organization to help the committee better understand the national accreditation process, and the steps that accrediting agencies take to ensure that the for-profit schools they accredit are acting both lawfully and in the best interests of their students. I want to remind everyone that Congress has just committed to making an increased investment in Pell grants, as I mentioned earlier. We've boosted it up by $36 billion over the next 10 years, which will bring us to a 10-year total of somewhere between $300 billion and $350 billion in the next 10 years, just in the Pell grant program. If current enrollment trends continue, a huge portion of those dollars will flow to students attending for-profit schools. I encourage the committee to keep this in mind as we hear testimony from today's witnesses. I think we need to keep two questions front and center: Are these schools serving the best interests of their students? Are our new investments--taxpayers' investments--in student financial aid sufficiently safeguarded under current law? These are the fundamental questions that this committee, and the Appropriations Committee that I chair, really need answers to. With that, I will turn to the committee's Ranking Member and former chair, Senator Enzi, for his opening statement. And then I will introduce our first panel. Statement of Senator Enzi Senator Enzi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This morning, we are going to hear the details of aggressive and inappropriate recruiting practices. Among other things we will see examples of schools misrepresenting the quality of education students receive, making unrealistic promises of high-paying jobs, and in some instances encouraging outright fraud. This behavior is unacceptable and should not be defended. Use of pressure tactics, deceitful marketing, and outright lies to mislead students has absolutely no place in education, or for that matter, in any legitimate business. It's truly appalling behavior, and the schools that engage in such activities must be firmly dealt with. However, I am just as concerned that descriptions of wrong doings such as these will be used to unfairly characterize all for-profit schools as bad actors, and that is simply not the case. As Secretary Duncan has said, ``for-profit institutions play a vital role in training young people and adults for jobs.'' Unfortunately, this series of hearings has only shown the negative, and seems intent on portraying all for-profits as irresponsible and predatory. My comments should not be interpreted as defending unscrupulous behavior or condoning aggressive recruiting practices. I am also not suggesting that this committee should ignore wrongdoing in the for-profit sector. On the contrary, it is crystal clear that some programs at for-profit schools are misleading students and possibly defrauding taxpayers out of millions of dollars in student aid funds. However, in focusing only on for-profits, we are not being objective, and we are ignoring the bigger picture of what is happening across all of higher education. Public and nonprofit schools are not immune from inappropriate behavior when it comes to recruiting. One of the most blatant places, of course, is in athletic programs. A simple news search performed by my staff pulled up nearly 20 individual examples of recruiting violations in college athletic programs. For instance, one public university has been cited for making hundreds of impermissible calls and text messages to prospective student athletes, giving recruits improper benefits and improperly distributing free tickets to high school coaches and others. More recently, a college basketball coach allegedly helped boosters raise money at a high school tournament held in the university's gym; a direct violation of NCAA Rules that prohibit such behavior attended by prospective recruits. Situations like these are unacceptable and are firmly dealt with when uncovered. However, unlike what we are seeing here today, they are not used as evidence of widespread corruption, or used to suggest that all college athletic programs are engaged in unscrupulous behavior. For-profit schools are a part of a much larger system of higher education that includes for-profits, as well as thousands of traditional institutions of higher education. Many of the issues you raise, Chairman Harkin, particularly those regarding student debt and default, are problems throughout the higher education system, not only at for-profits. Also, the rules that apply to Federal loans, apply to all students, regardless of the type of institution they attend. We should be scrutinizing all sectors of higher education and asking the same questions you are now asking of for-profit institutions. Again, I don't dispute the need to shine a light on the for-profit sector. For-profits have grown at a tremendous rate and are receiving an increasingly larger percentage of Federal student aid funds. And, as the testimony today will illustrate, there is clearly inappropriate behavior taking place in the recruiting practices of some schools. However, if these hearings are to be meaningful, the for-profit sector must not be examined in a vacuum. It is part of a much broader community of postsecondary schools that includes public, 4- and 2-year schools, as well as private nonprofit schools. And, as Secretary Duncan has explained, ``They are helping us meet an ever increasing demand for skills that public institutions cannot always meet. They are an essential part in achieving President Obama's goal of being first in the world in college completion by 2020.'' Therefore, I encourage you to reassess your approach to these hearings and provide the committee with an examination of for-profit schools in relation to all institutions of higher education. Many, if not most, of the same rules and regulations that we are discussing during these hearings apply to all sectors of higher education. I believe that understanding how each sector of higher education relates to the other is the best way for us to ensure that students are protected and that the taxpayers are getting the best return on their investment. For that reason I will be asking the GAO to expand upon the request you made for data on for-profit colleges to also include a review of all institutions of higher education. I hope that you will join me in that request. I would also ask permission to have included in the record, an article that was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, ``Ignorance By Degrees in Higher Education.'' The Chairman. Without objection. Senator Enzi. Thank you. [The information referred to follows:] [The Wall Street Journal, August 2, 2010] Ignorance By Degrees Colleges serve the people who work there more than the students who desperately need to learn something. (By Mark Bauerlein) \\1\\ Higher education may be heading for a reckoning. For a long time, despite the occasional charge of liberal dogma on campus or of a watered-down curriculum, people tended to think the best of the college and university they attended. Perhaps they attributed their career success or that of their friends to a diploma. Or they felt moved by a particular professor or class. Or they received treatment at a university hospital or otherwise profited from university-based scientific research. Or they just loved March Madness. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Mr. Bauerlein, the author of ``The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future,'' teaches at Emory University. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Recently, though, a new public skepticism has surfaced, with galling facts to back it up. Over the past 30 years, the average cost of college tuition and fees has risen 250% for private schools and nearly 300% for public schools (in constant dollars). The salaries of professors have also risen much faster than those of other occupations. At Stanford, to take but one example, the salaries of full professors have leapt 58% in constant dollars since the mid-1980s. College presidents do even better. From 1992 to 2008, NYU's presidential salary climbed to $1.27 million from $443,000. By 2008, a dozen presidents had passed the million-dollar mark. Meanwhile, tenured and tenure-track professors spend ever less time with students. In 1975, 43% of college teachers were classified as ``contingent''--that is, they were temporary instructors and graduate students; today that rate is 70%. Colleges boast of high faculty-to- student ratios, but in practice most courses have a part-timer at the podium. Elite colleges justify the light teaching loads of their professors--Yale requires only three courses a year, with a semester off every third year--by claiming that the members of their faculty spend their time producing important research. A glance at scholarly journals or university-press catalogs might make one wonder how much of this ``research'' is advancing knowledge and how much is part of a guild's need to credentialize its members. In any case, time spent for research is time taken away from students. The remoteness of professors may help explain why about 30% of enrolling students drop out of college only a few months after arriving. At the same time, the administrator-to-student ratio is growing. In fact, it has doubled since 1976. The administrative field has diversified into exotic specialties such as Credential Specialist, Coordinator of Learning Immersion Experiences and Dietetic Internship Director. In ``Higher Education?'' Andrew Hacker and Claudia Dreifus describe such conditions in vivid detail. They offer statistics, anecdotes and first-person accounts--concerning tuition, tenure and teaching loads, among much else--to draw up a powerful, if rambling, indictment of academic careerism. The authors are not shy about making biting judgments along the way. Of the 3,015 papers delivered at the 2007 meeting of the American Sociological Association, the authors say, few ``needed to be written.'' As for one of the most prestigious universities in the world, ``the mediocrity of Harvard undergraduate teaching is an open secret of the Ivy League.'' Much of the research for scholarly articles and lectures is ``just compost to bulk up resumes.'' College presidents succeed not by showing strong, imaginative leadership but ``by extending their school's terrain.'' Indeed, ``hardly any of them have done anything memorable, apart perhaps from firing a popular athletic coach.'' For all the high-minded talk, Mr. Hacker and Ms. Dreifus conclude, colleges and universities serve the people who work there more than the parents and taxpayers who pay for ``higher education'' or the students who so desperately need it. Take the adjunct issue. Everyone knows that colleges increasingly staff courses with part-time instructors who earn meager pay and no benefits. But who wants to eliminate the practice? Administrators like it because it saves money, professors because it saves them from teaching labor-intensive courses. And adjuncts themselves would rather continue at minimum wage than leave the profession altogether. In a ``coda,'' Mr. Hacker and Ms. Dreifus declare that ``it is immoral and unseemly to have a person teaching exactly the same class as an ensconced faculty member, but for one-sixth the pay.'' Perhaps so, but without a united faction mobilized against it, such ``immorality'' won't stop anytime soon. But some change may still be possible. A lot of criticism of academia hasn't stuck in the past, Mr. Hacker and Ms. Dreifus imply, because people have almost unthinkingly believed in the economic power of the degree. Yes, you didn't learn a lot, and the professors blew you off--the reasoning went--but if you got a diploma the job offers would follow. But that logic may no longer be so compelling. With the economy tightening and tales of graduates stuck in low-paying jobs with $50,000 in student loans, college doesn't look like an automatic bargain. We need some hard cost accounting and comparisons, Mr. Hacker and Ms. Dreifus argue, and so they end ``Higher Education?'' with capsule summaries of, as they put it, ``Schools We Like''--that is, schools that offer superior undergraduate educations at relatively low cost. The list includes Ole Miss, Cooper Union, Berea College, Arizona State and Western Oregon University. ``We think a low cost should be a major determinant in any college decision,'' the authors wisely conclude, for ``a debt-free beginning is worth far more than a name-brand imprimatur.'' [The prepared statement of Senator Enzi follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Enzi The June 24, 2010 and August 4, 2010 hearings of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee focused almost exclusively on title IV funding at for-profit institutions of education. Many of the issues raised during these hearings apply throughout higher education, not just at for-profits. The following tables provide general statistical information regarding tuition, default rates, title IV funding, spending on instruction, and demographics for all sectors of higher education. As the table below illustrates, spending on instruction ranges from 21 percent to 38 percent for all schools. Spending on instruction at public and non-profit schools is only marginally higher than it is at for-profit schools, 26 percent at public 4-year schools versus 21 percent at for-profit 4-year schools. The data also show public schools receive between 40 percent and 65 percent of their revenue from government sources, while for-profits rely almost exclusively on tuition. Despite this disparity, the data show for-profits spend roughly the same percentage on instruction as public schools.

As shown below, the built-in government subsidies for public 4-year institutions ensure that tuition and fees are significantly lower than those for private non-profits or for- profits. Additionally, the chart shows that the percentage increase in tuition and fees over the past 10 years at for- profits is similar to that for public 4-year institutions.

As noted in the following chart, students in all sectors of higher education rely heavily on Federal student financial assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act. However, due to growth in the for-profit sector, and a high proportion of low-income students, for-profit schools have seen a more rapid increase in their receipt of title IV money than traditional higher education, particularly Pell grant funds. Furthermore, high unemployment is reportedly increasing higher education applications and enrollment generally, and therefore, contributes to the increase in Pell-eligible students attending for-profit schools since 2007.

A 2009 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report examined this issue and stated that the high default rates at for-profit schools can be linked to the demographic characteristics of their students. ``Specifically, students who come from low-income backgrounds and from families who lack higher education are more likely to default on their loans, and data show that students from proprietary schools are more likely to come from low-income families and have parents who do not hold a college degree.'' GAO-00-600. As the following tables illustrate, for-profit students are poorer, older, and more likely to be a first generation college student than students attending traditional institutions of higher education.

The Chairman. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Enzi. Now, I'll introduce our first witness. Mr. Gregory Kutz is the Managing Director of GAO's Forensic Audits and Special Investigations Unit. The mission of the FSI is to provide the Congress with high-quality forensic audits and investigations of fraud, waste, and abuse, and evaluations of security vulnerabilities and other requested investigative services. In 1991, Mr. Kutz joined the Governmental Accountability Office after 8 years at KPMG Peat Marwick. As a senior executive at GAO, Mr. Kutz has testified at congressional hearings over 80 times, primarily on matters related to fraud, waste, and abuse and other special investigations. Mr. Kutz has been responsible for reports issued by GAO, and testimony relating to credit card and travel fraud and abuse, and improper sales of sensitive military and dual-use technology, tax fraud and abuse, wage theft, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita fraud, transit benefit fraud, procurement fraud, pay problems for military members, and seclusion and restraint of disabled children in schools. I read all of that to make a note of the fact that Mr. Kutz has provided invaluable service along with the GAO to this Congress and to the American people in making sure that our taxpayers' dollars are well-spent, and that we have the information we need to oversee the spending of those tax dollars. So, Mr. Kutz, welcome to the committee. I will start the clock at 25 minutes. If you need a few more minutes than that, we'll do it, because I know you have a lengthy testimony and you have some video clips to show us. We have a vote at 10:40. We'll try to get through your opening testimony and then we'll take a break, and then we'll come back. So, Mr. Kutz, your written statement at the GAO will be made a part of the record in its entirety and again, welcome, and please proceed. STATEMENT OF GREGORY D. KUTZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, FORENSIC AUDITS AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE Mr. Kutz. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss for-profit colleges. Today's testimony will provide you with an inside look at the sales and marketing practices of these colleges. My testimony has two parts. First, I will discuss what we did, and second, I will discuss the results of our undercover testing. First, our prospective students applied for admission to for-profit colleges in six States, and here in Washington, DC. We selected these colleges based on a number of factors, including size, location, and the percentage of Federal funding that was received. Yes? The Chairman. I apologize for interrupting, I forgot to ask something I was supposed to. Mr. Kutz, before you begin, I'd like you to make the identity of the schools you visited public, together with the identity of the schools we will be seeing in the video clips. If you would like to provide a list of the schools, we would appreciate that, and then each member can have that. Mr. Kutz. Certainly, I'll list them off. In our testimony, they're numbered as Nos. 1 through 15, and so I'll just go through them. They're actually 12 unique colleges, we went to three of them once. Case No. 1 one is University of Phoenix in Arizona, case No. 2 is Everest College in Arizona, No. 3 is Westech College in California, No. 4 is Kaplan College in California, No. 5 is Potomac College in Washington, DC, No. 6, No. 7 is Medvance Institute in Florida, No. 8 is Kaplan College, again, this time in Florida, No. 9 is College of Office Tech in Illinois, No. 10 is Argosy University in Illinois, No. 11 is the University of Phoenix, again, this time in Pennsylvania, No. 12 is Anthem Institute in Pennsylvania, No. 13 is Westwood College in Texas, No. 14 is, again, Everest College, this time in Texas, and No. 15 is ATI Career Training in Texas. The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Kutz. Mr. Kutz. What we did, was we used bogus identities and documents and spoke to representatives at these 15 colleges that I just mentioned, which is, again, 12 colleges, and 3 of them were repeats. For the first scenario, our student had income that was low enough to qualify for Federal grants and subsidized loans. For our second scenario, our student had higher income, and $250,000 in savings in what we described as a recent inheritance. We also enrolled our perspective students in two Web sites, and four students were enrolled in these, and I will refer to these throughout my testimony as marketing lead generators. We did this to determine the type and frequency of marketing calls that we would receive from these Web sites. Now that I've set up what we did, let me move onto my second point, the results of our undercover testing. Specifically, we found that four colleges encouraged our students to commit fraud. What I'm going to do is walk you through our key findings, and use the video clips to bring each of these points to life. Although, as I mentioned, all 15 provided deceptive and questionable information, as Senator Enzi mentioned, they were not all bad, and some provided some good practices. So, I'm going to start with that. For example, several applicants were told that the transfer of their credits depended upon the college that they were transferring to. Several applicants were told to research credible, independent evidence of expected salaries, and one representative that you'll see told our applicant to be cautious about taking out too much debt. These videos I'm going to show now will show some good practices. [Video] Unfortunately, these good practices were harder to identify than the bad ones. Let me start by speaking about my favorite topic, as you mentioned in your opening of me, I speak about fraud a lot. Representatives from four schools encouraged our applicants to falsify their Federal financial aid forms, or what you all have heard before is the FAFSA form, FAFSA. Examples included, telling our students not to report $250,000 in savings. One representative told us that this $250,000 wasn't any of the government's business. Another one told us to delete the $250,000 from our Federal aid form. Other students were told to add bogus dependents to their Federal aid form. One representative held up three fingers, and told us specifically to add three bogus dependents to our Federal aid form. By falsifying our applications, our fictitious students would have qualified for Federal grants and subsidized loans that they were not entitled to. In other words, although we had enough money to pay for this, they told us to commit fraud, so that Federal taxpayers would pick up the tab. The following videos show you two of these fraud cases. [Video] Representatives from 13 colleges gave our applicants deceptive or questionable information about graduation rates, guaranteed jobs, or they exaggerated future earnings. Examples include one representative that said that people coming out of their barber program--barber shop program--can earn $150,000 to $250,000. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90 percent of the barbers in this area which, by the way, is here in Washington, DC, make less than $19,000 a year. Another representative did not offer a job guarantee but said that 90 percent of the students get jobs. Here are some videos that show these types of issues. [Video] As you know, Federal loan default rates at these for-profit colleges are high. At eight of these colleges, at least 80 percent of the students have Federal loans. Examples of bad advice we received include one individual telling us that they had $85,000 of student loans that they probably would not repay. Another representative told us that, unlike car loans, nobody will come after you if you fail to pay your student loans. Also, you know, taxpayers pick up the tab for all of these defaulted Federal loans, and students do face consequences when they default on a loan. Here are some videos showing these points. [Video] Let's move on to cost. Our analysis found that for-profit colleges, for certificates and degrees, generally substantially cost higher than public and private nonprofits. The primary exception to this was for Bachelor's Programs, where private, nonprofits are often more expensive. Examples of deceptive information on cost include one representative saying that their $15,000 computer drafting program was a great value. The same certificate at a local community college was $520. And another representative in Texas said that their Bachelor's program cost $50,000 to $75,000 a year, which is far less than traditional programs. That same program at the University of Texas at Austin was $36,000. Here are a few video clips. [Video] The two Web sites I mentioned we registered with appear to be lead generators for numerous for-profit colleges. Two fictitious individuals expressed interest in a culinary arts certificate at Web sites A and B. We had two others express interest in business degrees at these same Web sites. Within 5 minutes, our phone began to ring. The two individuals interested in business degrees received about 180 calls, each, in 1 month. The culinary arts students received far less interest, with one only receiving a few calls, and the other still receiving 72. In total, our four fictitious prospective students received 436 calls in 1 month. All but six of these calls were from for-profit colleges. The following video will give you a perspective of what your voice mail would sound like if you registered with one of these lead generators. [Video] As you can tell, our cover is blown, that was Amy Meyers, actually. So, we also identified a number of high-pressure sales and marketing practices. Examples include, at six colleges applicants were told that they could not speak to someone from financial aid until they paid an application fee and signed enrollment forms. At one college, our applicant was scolded and ridiculed for refusing to enroll before speaking to financial aid. And at another college, our applicant was told to sign enrollment forms, but was assured that it was not a legally binding document. These colleges do not appear to have any enrollment standards, and cost appears to be irrelevant because the Federal Government is paying for the vast majority of this. So, the aggressive marketing of anybody walking in the door should not be a surprise here to anybody. Here are two examples of these aggressive marketing practices. [Video] In conclusion, it wasn't hard to find deceptive and fraudulent marketing practices. These practices are not unique to this industry. We've reported on fraudulent and deceptive practices in several other industries, recently. However, the big difference, here, is the vast majority of money that is funding these activities is coming from American taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, you've been very generous with my time, and I appreciate that, but I want to finish the story of that last student. When you left off a minute ago, the sales representative was pressuring them to enroll without speaking to financial aid. They then said they were going to go get someone from financial aid. As you'll see on this final video, when they came back, they actually passed the person on to the admissions director. Here is the unhappy ending to this story. [Video] Mr. Chairman, that ends my statement. I look forward to all of your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kutz follows:] Prepared Statement of Gregory D. Kutz Highlights why gao did this study Enrollment in for-profit colleges has grown from about 365,000 students to almost 1.8 million in the last several years. These colleges offer degrees and certifications in programs ranging from business administration to cosmetology. In 2009, students at for-profit colleges received more than $4 billion in Pell grants and more than $20 billion in Federal loans provided by the Department of Education (Education). GAO was asked to (1) conduct undercover testing to determine if for-profit colleges' representatives engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise questionable marketing practices, and (2) compare the tuitions of the for-profit colleges tested with those of other colleges in the same geographic region. To conduct this investigation, GAO investigators posing as prospective students applied for admissions at 15 for-profit colleges in 6 States and Washington, DC. The colleges were selected based on several factors, including those that the Department of Education reported received 89 percent or more of their revenue from Federal student aid. GAO also entered information on four fictitious prospective students into education search Web sites to determine what type of follow-up contact resulted from an inquiry. GAO compared tuition for the 15 for-profit colleges tested with tuition for the same programs at other colleges located in the same geographic areas. Results of the undercover tests and tuition comparisons cannot be projected to all for-profit colleges. For-Profit Colleges--Undercover Testing Finds Colleges Encouraged Fraud and Engaged in Deceptive and Questionable Marketing Practices what gao found Undercover tests at 15 for-profit colleges found that four colleges encouraged fraudulent practices and that all 15 made deceptive or otherwise questionable statements to GAO's undercover applicants. Four undercover applicants were encouraged by college personnel to falsify their financial aid forms to qualify for Federal aid--for example, one admissions representative told an applicant to fraudulently remove $250,000 in savings. Other college representatives exaggerated undercover applicants' potential salary after graduation and failed to provide clear information about the college's program duration, costs, or graduation rate despite Federal regulations requiring them to do so. For example, staff commonly told GAO's applicants they would attend classes for 12 months a year, but stated the annual cost of attendance for 9 months of classes, misleading applicants about the total cost of tuition. Admissions staff used other deceptive practices, such as pressuring applicants to sign a contract for enrollment before allowing them to speak to a financial advisor about program cost and financing options. However, in some instances, undercover applicants were provided accurate and helpful information by college personnel, such as not to borrow more money than necessary. Fraudulent, Deceptive, and Otherwise Questionable Practices ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Degree/certificate, location Sales and marketing practice ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Certificate Program--California........... Undercover applicant was encouraged by a college representative to change Federal aid forms to falsely increase the number of dependents in the household in order to qualify for grants. Associate's Degree--Florida............... Undercover applicant was falsely told that the college was accredited by the same organization that accredits Harvard and the University of Florida. Certificate Program--Washington, DC....... Admissions representative said that barbers can earn up to $150,000 to $250,000 a year, an exceptional figure for the industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 90 percent of barbers make less than $43,000 a year. Certificate Program--Florida.............. Admission representative told an undercover applicant that student loans were not like a car payment and that no one would ``come after'' the applicant if she did not pay back her loans. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: GAO. In addition, GAO's four fictitious prospective students received numerous, repetitive calls from for-profit colleges attempting to recruit the students when they registered with Web sites designed to link for-profit colleges with prospective students. Once registered, GAO's prospective students began receiving calls within 5 minutes. One fictitious prospective student received more than 180 phone calls in a month. Calls were received at all hours of the day, as late as 11 p.m. To see video clips of undercover applications and to hear voice mail messages from for-profit college recruiters, see http://www.gao.gov/ products/GAO-10-948T. Programs at the for-profit colleges GAO tested cost substantially more for associate's degrees and certificates than comparable degrees and certificates at public colleges nearby. A student interested in a massage therapy certificate costing $14,000 at a for-profit college was told that the program was a good value. However the same certificate from a local community college cost $520. Costs at private nonprofit colleges were more comparable when similar degrees were offered. ______ Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss our investigation into fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise questionable sales and marketing practices in the for-profit college industry.\\1\\ Across the Nation, about 2,000 for-profit colleges eligible to receive Federal student aid offer certifications and degrees in subjects such as business administration, medical billing, psychology, and cosmetology. Enrollment in such colleges has grown far faster than traditional higher-education institutions. The for-profit colleges range from small, privately owned colleges to colleges owned and operated by publicly traded corporations. Fourteen such corporations, worth more than $26 billion as of July 2010,\\2\\ have a total enrollment of 1.4 million students. With 443,000 students, one for-profit college is one of the largest higher-education systems in the country--enrolling only 20,000 students fewer than the State University of New York. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ For-profit colleges are institutions of post-secondary education that are privately-owned or owned by a publicly traded company and whose net earnings can benefit a shareholder or individual. In this report, we use the term ``college'' to refer to all of those institutions of post-secondary education that are eligible for funds under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. This term thus includes public and private nonprofit institutions, proprietary or for-profit institutions, and post-secondary vocational institutions. \\2\\ $26 billion is the aggregate market capitalization of the 14 publicly traded corporations on July 14, 2010. In addition, there is a 15th company that operates for-profit colleges; however, the parent company is involved in other industries; therefore, we are unable to separate its market capitalization for only the for-profit college line of business, and its value is not included in this calculation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid manages and administers billions of dollars in student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. These programs include, among others, the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loans), the Federal Pell grant program, and campus-based aid programs.\\3\\ Grants do not have to be repaid by students, while loans must be repaid whether or not a student completes a degree program. Students may be eligible for ``subsidized'' loans or ``unsubsidized'' loans. For unsubsidized loans, interest begins to accrue on the loan as soon as the loan is taken out by the student (i.e. while attending classes). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs are called campus-based programs and are administered directly by the financial aid office at each participating college. As of July 1, 2010 new Federal student loans that are not part of the campus-based programs will come directly from the Department of Education under the Direct Loan program. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For subsidized loans, interest does not accrue while a student is in college. Colleges received $105 billion in title IV funding for the 2008-9 school year--of which approximately 23 percent or $24 billion went to for-profit colleges. Because of the billions of dollars in Federal grants and loans utilized by students attending for-profit colleges, you asked us to (1) conduct undercover testing to determine if for-profit college representatives engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise questionable marketing practices, and (2) compare the cost of attending for-profit colleges tested with the cost of attending nonprofit colleges in the same geographic region. To determine whether for-profit college representatives engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise questionable sales and marketing practices, we investigated a nonrepresentative selection of 15 for- profit colleges located in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington, DC. We chose colleges based on several factors in order to test for-profit colleges offering a variety of educational services with varying corporate sizes and structures located across the country. Factors included whether a college received 89 percent or more of total revenue from Federal student aid according to Department of Education (Education) data or was located in a State that was among the top 10 recipients of title IV funding. We also chose a mix of privately held or publicly traded for-profit colleges. We reviewed Federal Trade Commission (FTC) statutes and regulations regarding unfair and deceptive marketing practices and Education statutes and regulations regarding what information postsecondary colleges are required to provide to students upon request and what constitutes substantial misrepresentation of services. During our undercover tests we attempted to identify whether colleges met these regulatory requirements, but we were not able to test all regulatory requirements in all tests. Using fictitious identities, we posed as potential students to meet with the colleges' admissions and financial aid representatives and inquire about certificate programs, associate's degrees, and bachelor's degrees.\\4\\ We inquired about one degree type and one major--such as cosmetology, massage therapy, construction management, or elementary education--at each college. We tested each college twice--once posing as a prospective student with an income low enough to qualify for Federal grants and subsidized student loans, and once as a prospective student with higher income and assets to qualify the student only for certain unsubsidized loans.\\5\\ Our undercover applicants were ineligible for other types of Federal postsecondary education assistance programs such as benefits available under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as ``the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill''). We used fabricated documentation, such as tax returns, created with publicly available hardware, software and materials, and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)-- the form used by virtually all 2- and 4-year colleges, universities, and career colleges for awarding Federal student aid--during our in- person meetings. In addition, using additional bogus identities, investigators posing as four prospective students filled out forms on two Web sites that ask questions about students' academic interests, match them to colleges with relevant programs, and provide the students' information to colleges or the colleges' outsourced calling center for follow-up about enrollment. Two students expressed interest in a culinary arts degree, and two other students expressed interest in a business administration degree. We filled out information on two Web sites with these fictitious prospective students' contact information and educational interests in order to document the type and frequency of contact the fictitious prospective students would receive. We then monitored the phone calls and voice mails received. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ A certificate program allows a student to earn a college level credential in a particular field without earning a degree. \\5\\ Regardless of income and assets, all eligible students attending a title IV college are eligible to receive unsubsidized Federal loans. The maximum amount of the unsubsidized loan ranges from $2,000 to $12,000 per year, depending on the student's grade level and on whether the student is considered ``dependent'' or ``independent'' from his or her parents or guardians. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To compare the cost of attending for-profit colleges with that of nonprofit colleges, we used Education information to select public and private nonprofit colleges located in the same geographic areas as the 15 for-profit colleges we visited. We compared tuition rates for the same type of degree or certificate between the for-profit and nonprofit colleges. For the 15 for-profit colleges we visited, we used information obtained from campus representatives to determine tuition at these programs. For the nonprofit colleges, we obtained information from their Web sites or, when not available publicly, from campus representatives. Not all nonprofit colleges offered similar degrees, specifically when comparing associate's degrees and certificate programs. We cannot project the results of our undercover tests or cost comparisons to other for-profit colleges. We plan to refer cases of school officials encouraging fraud and engaging in deceptive practices to Education's Office of Inspector General, where appropriate. Our investigative work, conducted from May 2010 through July 2010, was performed in accordance with standards prescribed by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. background In recent years, the scale and scope of for-profit colleges have changed considerably. Traditionally focused on certificate and programs ranging from cosmetology to medical assistance and business administration, for-profit institutions have expanded their offerings to include bachelor's, master's, and doctoral level programs. Both the certificate and degree programs provide students with training for careers in a variety of fields. Proponents of for-profit colleges argue that they offer certain flexibilities that traditional universities cannot, such as, online courses, flexible meeting times, and year-round courses. Moreover, for-profit colleges often have open admissions policies to accept any student who applies. Currently, according to Education about 2,000 for-profit colleges participate in title IV programs and in the 2008-9 school year, for- profit colleges received approximately $24 billion in title IV funds. Students can only receive title IV funds when they attend colleges approved by Education to participate in the title IV program. Title IV Program Eligibility Criteria The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, provides that a variety of institutions of higher education are eligible to participate in title IV programs, including: Public institutions--Institutions operated and funded by State or local governments, which include State universities and community colleges. Private nonprofit institutions--Institutions owned and operated by nonprofit organizations whose net earnings do not benefit any shareholder or individual. These institutions are eligible for tax- deductible contributions in accordance with the Internal Revenue code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)). For-profit institutions--Institutions that are privately owned or owned by a publicly traded company and whose net earnings can benefit a shareholder or individual. Colleges must meet certain requirements to receive title IV funds. While full requirements differ depending on the type of college, most colleges are required to: be authorized or licensed by the State in which it is located to provide higher education; provide at least one eligible program that provides an associate's degree or higher, or provides training to students for employment in a recognized occupation; and be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. Moreover, for-profit colleges must enter a ``program participation agreement'' with Education that requires the school to derive not less than 10 percent of revenues from sources other than title IV funds and certain other Federal programs (known as the ``90/10 Rule''). Student eligibility for grants and subsidized student loans is based on student financial need. In addition, in order for a student to be eligible for title IV funds, the college must ensure that the student meets the following requirements, among others: has a high school diploma, a General Education Development certification, or passes an ability-to-benefit test approved by Education, or completes a secondary school education in a home school setting recognized as such under State law; is working toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program; and is maintaining satisfactory academic progress once in college.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ GAO previously investigated certain schools' use of ability-to- benefit tests. For more information, see GAO, PROPRIETARY SCHOOLS: Stronger Department of Education Oversight Needed to Help Ensure Only Eligible Students Receive Federal Student Aid, GAO-09-600 (Washington, DC: August 17, 2009). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Defaults on Student Loans In August 2009, GAO reported that in the repayment period, students who attended for-profit colleges were more likely to default on Federal student loans than were students from other colleges.\\7\\ When students do not make payments on their Federal loans and the loans are in default, the Federal Government and taxpayers assume nearly all the risk and are left with the costs. For example, in the Direct Loan program, the Federal Government and taxpayers pick up 100 percent of the unpaid principal on defaulted loans. In addition, students who default are also at risk of facing a number of personal and financial burdens. For example, defaulted loans will appear on the student's credit record, which may make it more difficult to obtain an auto loan, mortgage, or credit card. Students will also be ineligible for assistance under most Federal loan programs and may not receive any additional title IV Federal student aid until the loan is repaid in full. Furthermore, Education can refer defaulted student loan debts to the Department of Treasury to offset any Federal or State income tax refunds due to the borrower to repay the defaulted loan. In addition, Education may require employers who employ individuals who have defaulted on a student loan to deduct 15 percent of the borrower's disposable pay toward repayment of the debt. Garnishment may continue until the entire balance of the outstanding loan is paid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ GAO-09-600. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- College Disclosure Requirements In order to be an educational institution that is eligible to receive title IV funds, Education statutes and regulations require that each institution make certain information readily available upon request to enrolled and prospective students.\\8\\ Institutions may satisfy their disclosure requirements by posting the information on their Internet Web sites. Information to be provided includes: tuition, fees, and other estimated costs; the institution's refund policy; the requirements and procedures for withdrawing from the institution; a summary of the requirements for the return of title IV grant or loan assistance funds; the institution's accreditation information; and the institution's completion or graduation rate. If a college substantially misrepresents information to students, a fine of no more than $25,000 may be imposed for each violation or misrepresentation and their title IV eligibility status may be suspended or terminated.\\9\\ In addition, the FTC prohibits ``unfair methods of competition'' and ``unfair or deceptive acts or practices'' that affect interstate commerce. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1092 and 34 CFR Sec. Sec. 668.41-.49. \\9\\ 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1094 (c) (3) and 34 CFR Sec. Sec. 668.71-.75. Additionally, Education has recently proposed new regulations that would enhance its oversight of title IV eligible institutions, including provisions related to misrepresentation and aggressive recruiting practices. See 75 Fed. Reg. 34,806 (June 18, 2010). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- for-profit colleges encouraged fraud and engaged in deceptive and otherwise questionable sales and marketing practices Our covert testing at 15 for-profit colleges found that four colleges encouraged fraudulent practices, such as encouraging students to submit false information about their financial status. In addition all 15 colleges made some type of deceptive or otherwise questionable statement to undercover applicants, such as misrepresenting the applicant's likely salary after graduation and not providing clear information about the college's graduation rate. Other times our undercover applicants were provided accurate or helpful information by campus admissions and financial aid representatives. Selected video clips of our undercover tests can be seen at http://www.gao.gov/ products/GAO-10-948T. Fraudulent Practices Encouraged by For-Profit Colleges In order to qualify for financial aid, 4 of the 15 colleges we visited encouraged our undercover applicants to falsify their FAFSA. A financial aid officer at a privately owned college in Texas told our undercover applicant not to report $250,000 in savings, stating that it was not the government's business how much money the undercover applicant had in a bank account. However, Education requires students to report such assets, which along with income, are used to determine how much and what type of financial aid for which a student is eligible. The admissions representative at this same school encouraged the undercover applicant to change the FAFSA to falsely add dependents in order to qualify for grants. The admissions representative attempted to ease the undercover applicant's concerns about committing fraud by stating that information about the reported dependents, such as Social Security numbers, was not required. An admissions representative at another college told our undercover applicant that changing the FAFSA to indicate that he supported three dependents instead of being a single-person household might drop his income enough to qualify for a Pell grant. In all four situations when college representatives encouraged our undercover applicants to commit fraud, the applicants indicated on their FAFSA, as well as to the for-profit college staff, that they had just come into an inheritance worth approximately $250,000. This inheritance was sufficient to pay for the entire cost of the undercover applicant's tuition. However, in all four cases, campus representatives encouraged the undercover applicants to take out loans and assisted them in becoming eligible either for grants or subsidized loans. It was unclear what incentive these colleges had to encourage our undercover applicants to fraudulently fill out financial aid forms given the applicants' ability to pay for college. The following table provides more details on the four colleges involved in encouraging fraudulent activity.

The undercover applicant suggested to the representative that by the time the college would be required by Education to verify any information about the applicant, the applicant would have already graduated from the 7-month program. The representative acknowledged this was true. This undercover applicant indicated to the financial aid representative that he had $250,000 in the bank, and was therefore capable of paying the program's $15,000 cost.

The representative told the applicant to come back once the fraudulent financial information changes had been processed. This change would not have made the applicant eligible for grants because his income would have been too high, but it would have made him eligible for loans subsidized by the government. However, this undercover applicant indicated that he had $250,000 in savings-- more than enough to pay for the program's $39,000 costs. PA................................... Certificate--Web Page Less than 2-year, Financial aid Design. privately owned. representative told the undercover applicant that he should have answered ``zero'' when asked about money he had in savings--the applicant had reported a $250,000 inheritance. The financial aid representative told the undercover applicant that she would ``correct'' his FAFSA form by reducing the reported assets to zero. She later confirmed by email and voicemail that she had made the change. This change would not have made the applicant eligible for grants, but it would have made him eligible for loans subsidized by the government. However, this applicant indicated that he had about $250,000 in savings--more than enough to pay for the program's $21,000 costs. TX................................... Bachelor's Degree-- 4-year, privately owned Admissions Construction representative Management. encouraged applicant to change the FAFSA to falsely add dependents in order to qualify for Pell grants. Admissions representative assured the undercover applicant that he did not have to identify anything about the dependents, such as their Social Security numbers, nor did he have to prove to the college with a tax return that he had previously claimed them as dependents. Financial aid representative told the undercover applicant that he should not report the $250,000 in cash he had in savings. This applicant indicated to the financial aid representative that he had $250,000 in the bank, and was therefore capable of paying the program's $68,000 cost. The fraud would have made the undercover applicant eligible for more than $2,000 in grants per year. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- deceptive or questionable statements Admissions or financial aid representatives at all 15 for-profit colleges provided our undercover applicants with deceptive or otherwise questionable statements. These deceptive and questionable statements included information about the college's accreditation, graduation rates and its student's prospective employment and salary qualifications, duration and cost of the program, or financial aid. Representatives at schools also employed hard-sell sales and marketing techniques to encourage students to enroll. Accreditation Information Admissions representatives at four colleges either misidentified or failed to identify their colleges' accrediting organizations. While all the for-profit colleges we visited were accredited according to information available from Education, Federal regulations state that institutions may not provide students with false, erroneous, or misleading statements concerning the particular type, specific source, or the nature and extent of its accreditation. Examples include: A representative at a college in Florida owned by a publicly traded company told an undercover applicant that the college was accredited by the same organization that accredits Harvard and the University of Florida when in fact it was not. The representative told the undercover applicant: ``It's the top accrediting agency--Harvard, University of Florida--they all use that accrediting agency. . . . All schools are the same; you never read the papers from the schools.'' A representative of a small beauty college in Washington, DC told an undercover applicant that the college was accredited by ``an agency affiliated with the government,'' but did not specifically name the accrediting body. Federal and State Government agencies do not accredit educational institutions. A representative of a college in California owned by a private corporation told an undercover applicant that this college was the only one to receive its accrediting organization's ``School of Excellence'' award. The accrediting organization's Web site listed 35 colleges as having received that award. Graduation Rate, Employment and Expected Salaries Representatives from 13 colleges gave our applicants deceptive or otherwise questionable information about graduation rates, guaranteed applicants jobs upon graduation, or exaggerated likely earnings. Federal statutes and regulations require that colleges disclose the graduation rate to applicants upon request, although this requirement can be satisfied by posting the information on their Web site. Thirteen colleges did not provide applicants with accurate or complete information about graduation rates. Of these 13, 4 provided graduation rate information in some form on their Web site, although it required a considerable amount of searching to locate the information. Nine schools did not provide graduation rates either during our in-person visit or on their Web sites. For example, when asked for the graduation rate, a representative at a college in Arizona owned by a publicly traded company said that last year 90 students graduated, but did not disclose the actual graduation rate. When our undercover applicant asked about graduation rates at a college in Pennsylvania owned by a publicly traded company, he was told that if all work was completed, then the applicant should successfully complete the program--again the representative failed to disclose the college's graduation rate when asked. However, because graduation rate information was available at both these colleges' Web sites, the colleges were in compliance with Education regulations. In addition, according to Federal regulations, a college may not misrepresent the employability of its graduates, including the college's ability to secure its graduates employment. However, representatives at two colleges told our undercover applicants that they were guaranteed or virtually guaranteed employment upon completion of the program. At five colleges, our undercover applicants were given potentially deceptive information about prospective salaries. Examples of deceptive or otherwise questionable information told to our undercover applicants included: A college owned by a publicly traded company told our applicant that, after completing an associate's degree in criminal justice, he could try to go work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Central Intelligence Agency. While other careers within those agencies may be possible, positions as a FBI Special Agent or CIA Clandestine Officer, require a bachelor's degree at a minimum. A small beauty college told our applicant that barbers can earn $150,000 to $250,000 a year. While this may be true in exceptional circumstances, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that 90 percent of barbers make less than $43,000 a year. A college owned by a publicly traded company told our applicant that instead of obtaining a criminal justice associate's degree, she should consider a medical assisting certificate and that after only 9 months of college, she could earn up to $68,000 a year. A salary this high would be extremely unusual; 90 percent of all people working in this field make less than $40,000 a year, according to the BLS. Program Duration and Cost Representatives from nine colleges gave our undercover applicants deceptive or otherwise questionable information about the duration or cost of their colleges' programs. According to Federal regulations, a college may not substantially misrepresent the total cost of an academic program. Representatives at these colleges used two different methods to calculate program duration and cost of attendance. Colleges described the duration of the program as if students would attend classes for 12 months per year, but reported the annual cost of attendance for only 9 months of classes per year. This disguises the program's total cost. Examples include: A representative at one college said it would take 3.5-4 years to obtain a bachelor's degree by taking classes year round, but quoted the applicant an annual cost for attending classes for 9 months of the year. She did not explain that attending classes for only 9 months out of the year would require an additional year to complete the program. If the applicant did complete the degree in 4 years, the annual cost would be higher than quoted to reflect the extra class time required per year. At another college, the representative quoted our undercover applicant an annual cost of around $12,000 per year and said it would take 2 years to graduate without breaks, but when asked about the total cost, the representative told our undercover applicant it would cost $30,000 to complete the program--equivalent to more than 2\\1/2\\ years of the previously quoted amount. If the undercover applicant had not inquired about the total cost of the program, she would have been led to believe that the total cost to obtain the associate's degree would have been $24,000. Financial Aid Eleven colleges denied undercover applicants access to their financial aid eligibility or provided questionable financial advice. According to Federal statutes and regulations, colleges must make information on financial assistance programs available to all current and prospective students. Six colleges in four States told our undercover applicants that they could not speak with financial aid representatives or find out what grants and loans they were eligible to receive until they completed the college's enrollment forms agreeing to become a student and paid a small application fee to enroll. A representative at one college in Florida owned by a publicly traded company advised our undercover applicant not to concern himself with loan repayment because his future salary--he was assured-- would be sufficient to repay loans. A representative at one college in Florida owned by a private company told our undercover applicant that student loans were not like car loans because ``no one will come after you if you don't pay.'' In reality, students who cannot pay their loans face fees, may damage their credit, have difficulty taking out future loans, and in most cases, bankruptcy law prohibits a student borrower from discharging a student loan. A representative at a college owned by a publicly traded corporation told our undercover applicant that she could take out the maximum amount of Federal loans, even if she did not need all the money. She told the applicant she could put the extra money in a high- interest savings account. While subsidized loans do not accrue interest while a student is in college, unsubsidized loans do accrue interest. The representative did not disclose this distinction to the applicant when explaining that she could put the money in a savings account. Other Sales and Marketing Tactics Six colleges engaged in other questionable sales and marketing tactics such as employing hard-sell sales and marketing techniques and requiring enrolled students to pay monthly installments to the college during their education. At one Florida college owned by a publicly traded company, a representative told our undercover applicant she needed to answer 18 questions correctly on a 50 question test to be accepted to the college. The test proctor sat with her in the room and coached her during the test. At two other colleges, our undercover applicants were allowed 20 minutes to complete a 12-minute test or took the test twice to get a higher score. At the same Florida college, multiple representatives used high pressure marketing techniques, becoming argumentative, and scolding our undercover applicants for refusing to enroll before speaking with financial aid. A representative at this Florida college encouraged our undercover applicant to sign an enrollment agreement while assuring her that the contract was not legally binding. A representative at another college in Florida owned by a publicly traded company said that he personally had taken out over $85,000 in loans to pay for his degree, but he told our undercover applicant that he probably would not pay it back because he had a ``tomorrow's never promised'' philosophy. Three colleges required undercover applicants to make $20- $150 monthly payments once enrolled, despite the fact that students are typically not required to repay loans until after the student finishes or drops out of the program. These colleges gave different reasons for why students were required to make these payments and were sometimes unclear exactly what these payments were for. At one college, the applicant would have been eligible for enough grants and loans to cover the annual cost of tuition, but was told that she needed to make progress payments toward the cost of the degree separate from the money she would receive from loans and grants. A representative from this college told the undercover applicant that the Federal Government's ``90/10 Rule'' required the applicant to make these payments. However, the ``90/10 Rule'' does not place any requirements on students, only on the college. At two colleges, our undercover applicants were told that if they recruited other students, they could earn rewards, such as an MP3 player or a gift card to a local store.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ Depending on the value of the gift, such a transaction may be allowed under current law. Federal statute requires that a college's program participation agreement with Education include a provision that the college will not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities. However, Education's regulations have identified 12 types of payment and compensation plans that do not violate this statutory prohibition, referred to as ``safe harbors''. Under one of these exceptions, schools are allowed to provide ``token gifts'' valued under $100 to a student provided the gift is not in the form of money and no more than one gift is provided annually to an individual. However, on June 18, 2010 the Department of Education issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would, among other things, eliminate these 12 safe harbors and restore the full prohibition. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Accurate and Helpful Information Provided In some instances our undercover applicants were provided accurate or helpful information by campus admissions and financial aid representatives. In line with Federal regulations, undercover applicants at several colleges were provided accurate information about the transferability of credits to other postsecondary institutions, for example: A representative at a college owned by a publicly traded company in Pennsylvania told our applicant that with regard to the transfer of credits, ``different schools treat it differently; you have to roll the dice and hope it transfers.'' A representative at a privately owned for-profit college in Washington, DC told our undercover applicant that the transfer of credits depends on the college the applicant wanted to transfer to. Some financial aid counselors cautioned undercover applicants not to take out more loans than necessary or provided accurate information about what the applicant was required to report on his FAFSA, for example: One financial aid counselor at a privately owned college in Washington, DC told an applicant that because the money had to be paid back, the applicant should be cautious about taking out more debt than necessary. A financial aid counselor at a college in Arizona owned by a publicly traded company had the undercover applicant call the FAFSA help line to have him ask whether he was required to report his $250,000 inheritance. When the FAFSA help line representative told the undercover applicant that it had to be reported, the college financial aid representative did not encourage the applicant not to report the money. In addition, some admissions or career placement staff gave undercover applicants reasonable information about prospective salaries and potential for employment, for example: Several undercover applicants were provided salary information obtained from the BLS or were encouraged to research salaries in their prospective fields using the BLS Web site. A career services representative at a privately owned for- profit college in Pennsylvania told an applicant that as an entry level graphic designer, he could expect to earn $10-$15 per hour. According to the BLS only 25 percent of graphic designers earn less than $15 per hour in Pennsylvania. Web Site Inquiries Result in Hundreds of Calls Some Web sites that claim to match students with colleges are in reality lead generators used by many for-profit colleges to market to prospective students. Though such Web sites may be useful for students searching for schools in some cases, our undercover tests involving four fictitious prospective students led to a flood of calls--about five a day. Four of our prospective students filled out forms on two Web sites, which ask questions about students' interests, match them to for-profit colleges with relevant programs, and provide the students' information to the appropriate college or the college's outsourced calling center for follow-up about enrollment. Two fictitious prospective students expressed interest in a culinary arts certificate, one on Web site A and one on Web site B. Two other prospective students expressed interest in a bachelor's degree in business administration, one on each Web site. Within minutes of filling out forms, three prospective students received numerous phone calls from colleges. One fictitious prospective student received a phone call about enrollment within 5 minutes of registering and another 5 phone calls within the hour. Another prospective student received 2 phone calls separated only by seconds within the first 5 minutes of registering and another 3 phone calls within the hour. Within a month of using the Web sites, one student interested in business management received 182 phone calls and another student also interested in business management received 179 phone calls. The two students interested in culinary arts programs received fewer calls--one student received only a handful, while the other received 72. In total, the four students received 436 phone calls in the first 30 days after using the Web sites. Of these, only six calls-- all from the same college--came from a public college.\\11\\ The table below provides information about the calls these students received within the first 30 days of registering at the Web site. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Of the 436 calls, not all resulted in a voice message in which a representative identified the school he or she was calling from. For those callers who did not leave a message, GAO attempted to trace the destination of the caller. In some cases GAO was not able to identify who placed the call to the student.

For example, a representative of a privately owned for-profit college in California told our undercover applicant that the $14,495 cost of tuition for a computer-aided drafting certificate was ``really low.'' A representative at a for-profit college in Florida owned by a publicly traded company told our undercover applicant that the cost of their associate's degree in criminal justice was definitely ``worth the investment.'' However, based on information we obtained from for-profit colleges we tested, and public and private nonprofit colleges in the same geographic region, we found that most certificate or associate's degree programs at the for-profit colleges we tested cost more than similar degrees at public or private nonprofit colleges. We found that bachelor's degrees obtained at the for-profit colleges we tested frequently cost more than similar degrees at public colleges in the area; however, bachelor's degrees obtained at private nonprofit colleges nearby are often more expensive than at the for-profit colleges. We compared the cost of tuition at the 15 for-profit colleges we visited, with public and private non-profit colleges located in the same geographic area as the for-profit college. We found that tuition in 14 out of 15 cases, regardless of degree, was more expensive at the for-profit college than at the closest public colleges. For 6 of the 15 for-profit colleges tested, we could not find a private nonprofit college located within 250 miles that offered a similar degree. For 1 of the 15, representatives from the private nonprofit college were unwilling to disclose their tuition rates when we inquired. At eight of the private nonprofit colleges for which we were able to obtain tuition information on a comparable degree, four of the for-profit colleges were more expensive than the private nonprofit college. In the other four cases, the private nonprofit college was more expensive than the for-profit college. We found that tuition for certificates at for-profit colleges were often significantly more expensive than at a nearby public college. For example, our undercover applicant would have paid $13,945 for a certificate in computer aided drafting program--a certification for a 7-month program obtained by those interested in computer-aided drafting, architecture, and engineering--at the for-profit college we visited. To obtain a certificate in computed-aided drafting at a nearby public college would have cost a student $520. However, for two of the five colleges we visited with certificate programs, we could not locate a private nonprofit college within a 250 mile radius and another one of them would not disclose its tuition rate to us. We were able to determine that in Illinois, a student would spend $11,995 on a medical assisting certificate at a for-profit college, $9,307 on the same certificate at the closest private nonprofit college, and $3,990 at the closest public college. We were also able to determine that in Pennsylvania, a student would spend $21,250 on a certificate in Web page design at a for-profit college, $4,750 on the same certificate at the closest private nonprofit college, and $2,037 at the closest public college. We also found that for the five associate's degrees we were interested in, tuition at a for-profit college was significantly more than tuition at the closest public college. On average, for the five colleges we visited, it cost between 6 and 13 times more to attend the for-profit college to obtain an associate's degree than a public college. For example, in Texas, our undercover applicant was interested in an associate's degree in respiratory therapy which would have cost $38,995 in tuition at the for-profit college and $2,952 at the closest public college. For three of the associate's degrees we were interested in, there was not a private nonprofit college located within 250 miles of the for-profit we visited. We found that in Florida the associate's degree in Criminal Justice that would have cost a student $4,448 at a public college, would have cost the student $26,936 at a for-profit college or $27,600 at a private nonprofit college--roughly the same amount. In Texas, the associate's degree in Business Administration would have cost a student $2,870 at a public college, $32,665 at the for-profit college we visited, and $28,830 at the closest private nonprofit college. We found that with respect to the bachelor's degrees we were interested in, four out of five times, the degree was more expensive to obtain at the for-profit college than the public college. For example in Washington, DC, the bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems would have cost $53,400 at the for-profit college, and $51,544 at the closest public college. The same bachelor's degree would have cost $144,720 at the closest private nonprofit college. For one bachelor's degree, there was no private nonprofit college offering the degree within a 250 mile radius. Three of the four private nonprofit colleges were more expensive than their for-profit counterparts.
