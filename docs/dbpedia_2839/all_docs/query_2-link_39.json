        "text": "There are different ways that individuals can meet the education requirement for registration. One of the ways is to complete a program approved by the College. Under the Registration Regulation, the College has the authority to approve certain types of post-secondary programs for equivalency to the current standard that is used for the education requirement for registration. The current standard is a two-year diploma program in early childhood education from an Ontario College of Applied Arts and Technology.\n\nGraduates of an approved program are considered to meet the education requirement for registration with the College.\n\nA current list of approved programs can be found on the College’s Education Programs list.\n\nFAQs\n\n1. What institutions are eligible to apply?\n\nAny program in early childhood education, or whose course content is relevant to early childhood education, offered by a Canadian post-secondary institution can apply for approval.\n\nThis does not apply to the two-year early childhood education diploma programs delivered by Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology. You can view a list of early childhood education diploma programs delivered by OCAATs here.\n\n2. Does the College approve any early childhood education programs offered outside of Ontario?\n\nThe College may approve post-secondary programs in early childhood education, or programs with course content relevant to early childhood education, offered by a Canadian post-secondary institution.\n\nThe College does not accept applications from post-secondary institutions outside of Canada.\n\n3. Which programs are currently approved by the College?\n\nCurrent programs approved by the College can be found on the Education Programs List. Graduates of programs on the education programs list are considered graduates of an approved program if the official transcript shows completion of program/graduation by the program approval end date.\n\nGraduates of education programs previously approved by the College will also meet the education requirement if the official transcript shows completion of the program/graduation by the program approval end date. The list of education programs previously approved by the College can be found on the Education Programs page.\n\n4. How does a post-secondary institution apply?\n\nA post-secondary institution applies by submitting a complete application package accompanied by all the required supporting documents and applicable fees for each program. If the institution is applying for more than one program, separate application packages are required. Instructions on how to apply can be found in the Program Application Portfolio.\n\n5. How will the review be conducted?\n\nThe review process is a document-based process to determine if the program is equivalent to the current standard used for the education requirement for registration with the College. (The current standard is a two-year diploma program in early childhood education from an Ontario College of Applied Arts and Technology). The criteria can be found in Section 3 of the Approval of Education Programs Policy.\n\n6. Are there fees associated with the process?\n\nThe fee schedule can be found in the Program Application Portfolio. Fees must be paid in full.\n\nThe application fee is the same for all programs. The assessment fees vary and are based on the type and length of program.\n\nAll fees must be submitted with the application package. Applications without accompanying fees will not be reviewed.\n\nFees are not refundable.\n\n7. If the College approved the program, how long is the approval status valid for?\n\nGenerally approval will be granted for either 2 or 5 years (See Section 4.4 of the policy). Programs will be required to report to the College on an annual basis in order to maintain their status.\n\n8. What are the obligations of an approved program?\n\nA post-secondary institution that is approved is required to:\n\nEnter into an agreement with the College on communications, promotion, and marketing regarding the College’s approval of the education program(s);\n\nSubmit an Annual Reporting Form and adhere to the application fee schedule\n\nNotify the College about any changes that may impact the program’s approval; and,\n\nParticipate in program audits if required by the College.\n\n9. What happens if the College does not approve the program?\n\nA program will be issued a “not approved” decision if the program:\n\nDoes not meet one or more of the minimum requirements,\n\nDoes not meet one of more of the assessment requirements, or\n\nCould not be fully assessed under the policy because the College was given insufficient information to complete the assessment.\n\nThe post-secondary institution will be notified of the decision and provided with the opportunity to respond before a final decision is made. The outcome of that process constitutes the College’s final decision about the approval of the program.\n\nGraduates from programs not approved by the College can still apply for registration through the College’s individual assessment of educational qualifications process. More information regarding the process can be found on the Individual Assessment of Educational Qualifications page.\n\n10. Can my institution withdraw its application for a program?\n\nA post-secondary institution may withdraw its application at any time by submitting a written request, signed by the institution’s authorized official. Contact the College at education-programs@college-ece.ca for information.\n\nInterested in Applying?\n\nIf your institution is interested in applying for program approval, please review the Approval of Education Programs Policy and the FAQs before submitting an application to ensure eligibility.\n\nResources:\n\nApproval of Education Programs Policy\n\nEarly Childhood Education Program Standard approved by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities\n\nEducation Program Application Package\n\n​Part 1: Application ​​Form\n\n​​​Part 2: Program Application​ Portfolio​\n\nQuestions?\n\nIf you can’t find the answer to your question or need clarification regarding the review process, contact us by email at education-programs@college-ece.ca."
