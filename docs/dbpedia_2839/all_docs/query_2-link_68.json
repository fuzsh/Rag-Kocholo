        "text": "1919\n\nThe Birth of Federation\n\nOn December 30, 1919, the Federation was founded at a meeting attended by 62 representatives, held at the Odd Fellows Temple at 229 College Street in Toronto. Within a year there were more than 1000 members from 14 districts.\n\nImage\n\nOddfellows' Hall — First Meeting Place\n\n1920\n\nAt its second annual meeting, OSSTF members pass a motion by Jessie Muir of Ottawa supporting “the principle of equal pay for equal work...”\n\nImage\n\nJessie Muir — Equal Pay\n\n1925\n\nFederation is incorporated as a non–profit corporation with provincial charter. The first objective stated in the Letters Patent is “to associate and unite the Secondary School Teachers of the Province of Ontario and to promote and safeguard their interests.”\n\nImage\n\nLetters Patent\n\n1930\n\nEducation Week, initiated under the auspices of the Federation, is held for the first time on October 19–24, 1930. Over sixty years later OSSTF members continue to celebrate this annual occasion.\n\nImage\n\nEducation Week\n\n1965\n\nOSSTF publishes its first set of resource books covering topics such as Business, English, Geography, History and Science. The following year the Federation would publish resource books on Classical Languages, Modern Languages, Guidance and Music.\n\nImage\n\nResource Books\n\n1973\n\nIn response to the provincial government’s move to remove their right to strike, on December 18, teachers from across the province walked off their jobs en–masse in what was then Ontario’s largest political demonstration. The government conceded that teachers did indeed have the right to strike and committed itself to bargaining in good faith.\n\nImage\n\nQueen's Park\n\n1987\n\nOSSTF is certified as a trade union and starts to organize other categories of education workers. Soon Teachers are joined by Attendance Counsellors, Child and Youth Workers, Educational Audiologists, Educational Assistants, Occupational Therapists, Psychologists, Speech & Language Pathologists, and Social Workers.\n\nImage\n\nAnnual Meeting of the Provincial Assembly (AMPA)\n\n1989\n\n25,000 OSSTF members and teachers from other affiliates fill Hamilton’s Copps Coliseum in a protest against the government’s proposed changes to the Teachers’ Superannuation Fund including the expropriation of $461 million. The protest leads to the formation of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.\n\nImage\n\nCopps Pension Rally\n\n1997\n\nOSSTF members across the province walk off their jobs to protest the provincial government’s Bill 160. After 10 days of protest, the government backed off on some changes and the public’s concern for public education was raised.\n\nImage\n\nMaple Leaf Gardens\n\n2002\n\nOSSTF organizes workers at Brock University, our first university sector bargaining unit. They are soon joined by three more university sector bargaining units: Algoma University-College, University of Ottawa, and Wilfrid Laurier University.\n\nImage\n\nUniversity Sector\n\n2002\n\nThe “Common Threads” project launched as an initiative to produce high quality “classroom ready” curriculum resources for Ontario teachers.\n\nImage\n\nCommon Threads Project: The Sustainable Society\n\n2005\n\nOSSTF, in conjunction with its provincial affiliates releases its survey on bullying in the educational workplace. At the time, the report, delivered in two phases, was the first of its kind in North America.\n\nImage\n\nBullying Reports\n\n2009\n\nOver the school year of 2008/2009, working under the auspices of Provincial Discussion Tables, negotiators from OSSTF/FEESO settled 132 collective agreements for teachers and support staff across the province without having to resort to a single job action or work disruption.\n\nImage\n\nCollective Agreements\n\n2012\n\nSep. 11 — Bill 115 the Putting Students First Act enacted. It imposes collective agreement conditions and removes the right to strike at the discretion of the Education Minister.\n\nImage\n\nBill 115, Putting Students First Act\n\n2013\n\nA Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge against Bill 115 is launched by OSSTF/FEESO, ETFO, CUPE, OPSEU and Unifor.\n\nOct. 22 — Provincial government introduces Bill 122, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2013, creating a formalized two-tiered bargaining structure of a central agreement between the government, school board associations and the Federation, as well as a local agreement between each school board and local bargaining unit.\n\nImage\n\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms challenge news conference\n\n2014\n\nApr. 8 — Bill 122 enacted.\n\nMay 31 — Special Meeting of the Provincial Assembly held to prepare for two-tier bargaining under Bill 122. A special supplementary levy if necessary approved for enhanced strike pay for members asked to engage in job action in support of demands for fair and reasonable treatment at the bargaining table.\n\nImage\n\nBill 122\n\n2015\n\nApril/May — D.13 Durham (Apr. 20-May 27), D.03 Rainbow (Apr. 27-May 27), and D.19 Peel (May 4-27) Teacher/Occasional Teacher Bargaining Units strike.\n\nMay 26 — OLRB declares 3 striking (D.13 Durham, D.03 Rainbow, D.19 Peel)OSSTF Teacher/Occasional Teacher bargaining units to be in contravention of the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, and orders a two-week moratorium on further strikes.\n\nMay 28 — Ontario legislature passes Bill 103 the Protecting the School Year Act back-to-work legislation to end 3 striking Districts.\n\nImage\n\nBill 103\n\n2016\n\nApril 20 — In a ruling that marks a major victory for labour and collective bargaining rights, Ontario Superior Court Justice Thomas R. Lederer upholds the Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge launched by OSSTF/FEESO et al against Bill 115, which was imposed by the provincial government in September 2012. Lederer rules that Bill 115 was unconstitutional in that it violated the unions' rights to freedom of association and the right to meaningful collective bargaining.\n\nImage\n\nEducation Forum: A Pivotal Victory"
