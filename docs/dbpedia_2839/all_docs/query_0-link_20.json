        "text": "Practising health care professionals (HCPs) are held accountable for ensuring they maintain their clinical competence throughout their career.1 Once HCPs have met the minimum standards for licensure, many regulatory bodies expect them to demonstrate that they maintain professional competence (i.e., continuing competence) annually at the time of licensure renewal. Staying up to date requires effort: the HCP must be informed about advances in knowledge within their scope of practice.2 Researchers have raised the concern that HCPs do not remain up to date with emerging evidence.3,4 Furthermore, they have found evidence that competencies present when HCPs attain licensure are not static and degrade over time.5–8\n\nThe requirements for licensure renewal (also referred to as revalidation or re-registration) vary greatly across health professions and even within the same profession across different jurisdictions (e.g., between provinces). Some regulatory bodies require HCPs to provide evidence of having completed a predetermined number of continuing professional development (CPD) hours.9,10 Some use chart audits and site visits to ensure HCPs’ professional competence11 or require them to submit to a practice assessment of knowledge.12,13 Some also require HCPs to demonstrate their commitment to reflective practice, which is theorized to be an integral component of an HCP’s CPD.12,13\n\nThe “continuing” portion of professional development denotes a lifelong, independent, self-directed, reflective, and systematic approach to learning.9 Individual HCPs engage in CPD to update their knowledge and skills to meet patients’ and health services’ ever-changing needs.9 Requiring HCPs to regularly undertake CPD improves the quality of health care and is an integral part of what defines them as qualified practitioners.14\n\nRegulatory bodies may require evidence of CPD activities that are informed by reflective practices as part of the annual renewal or revalidation of HCPs’ license to practice.15,16 In the context of CPD for HCPs, reflection is a purposeful, intrinsic, critical analysis of one’s own knowledge to identify gaps with the goal of improving practice.17 Many models of reflection exist in health care education, and many of them provide a structure for HCPs to think systematically about specific past clinical experiences and outline steps to plan and execute new and improved behaviours.18–20 To contextualize and provide concrete evidence of HCPs’ reflective practices, many regulatory bodies require them to submit a portfolio that includes reflective writing as part of the revalidation process.10 Portfolios offer HCPs a framework to facilitate self-assessment and a vehicle for recording their goals, growth, and achievement; documenting their learning activities; and outlining their personal development plans.21–24 Developing an annual personal development plan usually involves a cyclical process of goal setting, reflecting upon growth, and recognizing achievement, followed by further goal setting.22\n\nAlthough regulatory bodies may require evidence of reflective practices, they appear to provide little guidance and support to facilitate HCPs’ reflective process. As with any skill, HCPs need a structure to guide the reflective activity, improve their reflective capacity, and systematize their reflection to direct the process and improve the consistency and quality of their CPD activities.12,25\n\nThe extent to which the empirical literature addressed HCPs’ engagement in reflective activities and the use of a portfolio to assess and maintain clinical competency was unclear. The purpose of this integrative review was to summarize the peer-reviewed literature on regulatory bodies’ use of portfolios with evidence of reflection as part of HCPs’ licensure renewal process. We addressed the following questions: (1) What resources do regulatory bodies that mandate the submission of a portfolio provide to HCPs to facilitate their reflective process? (2) What challenges and benefits of the mandated reflective process do HCPs report? and (3) What (if any) outcomes do regulatory bodies use to evaluate the reflective entries in HCPs’ portfolios?\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first integrative review of peer-reviewed publications that addresses regulatory bodies’ use of portfolios to document reflection and monitor the continuing competence of practising HCPs. The results indicate that only a limited number of regulatory bodies require evidence of reflective practices as part of the licensure renewal process. The most frequently used formats for evidence of reflection were reflective writing, learning plans, and learning goals. Most of the regulatory bodies discussed in the literature provided some directions or resources to guide HCPs’ reflective process, most commonly in the form of a non-specific instructional guidebook. HCPs reported both benefits and challenges of the reflective process. Finally, none of the regulatory bodies identified in the articles in this review required operational evidence of the impact of the HCP’s reflective practices on patient or organizational outcomes related to HCPs’ learning activities or actions.\n\nThe premise of reflection for HCPs is to move beyond merely looking back at their clinical actions and decisions but to critically describe, analyze and evaluate their knowledge and performance in order to inform and potentially change future practice in a positive way. Reflection can reinforce a process of active learning that challenges assumptions and prompts actions that lead to improved patient care.19 Regulatory bodies can help HCPs maximize practice outcomes by providing resources and strategies to support their reflective learning activities. Most of the articles in this review (16, 93%) indicated that the regulatory bodies did provide such resources for HCPs; however, the resources included more passive learning than active learning strategies. Briefly, active learning is learning through reading, writing, talking, listening, and reflecting,46 whereas passive learning is receiving information from the learning environment and internalizing it with no instructor feedback. The absence of active learning strategies from the resources cited in these articles is concerning because active learning is integral to effective reflective practice.46 Furthermore, the studies did not measure the extent to which HCPs used the resources and supports regulatory bodies provided online; such information could easily be gathered using Web analytics. Regulators should monitor whether HCPs are using their resources and seek their feedback on which resources they find useful; additionally, regulators could consider ways to integrate more active learning strategies into the resources they provide.\n\nSeveral authors discussed the specific active learning strategy of utilizing a mentor. Mentors can play an important role when HCPs engage in reflection47–49 by providing validation, support, and guidance in identifying learning goals and by acknowledging the new knowledge, skills, and attitudes HCPs attain through reflection.49,50 In the studies included in this review, many HCPs indicated a desire for mentorship or engagement with clinical facilitators who could advise and support them in their reflective activities.31–35,42,44,45 Wakeling and colleagues29 found that written reflections in physicians’ portfolios indicated they appreciated opportunities to discuss their reflection with a mentor and receive feedback, which helped them gain a better understanding of their practice and potential improvements and then “flesh out their reflections” in their portfolios. Some participants noted that the reflective process improved their ability to engage in specific and critical reflection and create concrete plans for change.29\n\nInteractions between mentors and HCPs can happen in various formats, including online, in groups, and one-on-one.49 Foucault and colleagues found that some HCPs completed their reflective practice in a group or with the support of others.35 When mentorship is not available, group reflective exercises and peer support can be valuable to stimulate reflection, promote a sense of shared responsibility, and improve HCPs’ motivation to complete the reflective activities.35,49 An interesting avenue for future research is to examine the roles of feedback, mentorship, and group reflective exercises as strategies to improve reflection among HCPs.\n\nSeveral authors in this integrative review found that HCPs voiced a range of opinions regarding the value of regulatory bodies’ mandated reflective activities. On the positive side, some HCPs reported that compiling reflective evidence for portfolio submission had practical benefits and produced positive feelings. Some agreed that reflective submissions are a flexible and proactive approach to education and assessment.31,36 Additionally, some HCPs stated that compiling reflective evidence elicited feelings of pride as the process provided a comprehensive overview of their professional accomplishments and leadership;33 some even used their portfolios as leverage or justification when seeking career promotions or alternative roles or as a way to facilitate feedback dialogue with peers.29,51,52 Regulatory boards developing resources for their members can use these reports as supporting evidence for the value of reflective practices.\n\nMany HCPs, however, voiced negative views of mandated reflective practices. Some reported that reflection and portfolios were not useful in their daily practice.33 Others reported that evidence of reflection was often “faked” or prepared “just in time” to submit for regulatory requirements, perhaps because of a lack of time for reflective practices.38 Some HCPs reported that they created the required learning goals the week before submitting their portfolio, suggesting that they had not integrated their goals thoughtfully into their daily clinical practice.29,38 Several HCPs noted difficulty engaging in reflection and developing a portfolio because of limited protected professional time for these activities.31–33,35,37,38,45 Furthermore, some indicated that compiling evidence of reflection for revalidation was so time consuming that the activity was a barrier to their engagement in CPD.37,38 Finally, some HCPs reported that the feedback from their regulatory body on their reflective submission was sparse and superficial, was not personalized, and informed them only whether or not they had complied with the CPD requirements.33 HCPs’ reported desire for feedback is promising as it indicates a willingness to improve, highlighting the importance of regulatory bodies’ better validating HCPs’ reflective submissions and providing more detailed objective feedback.\n\nVery few authors in this review identified objective outcomes that regulatory bodies used to monitor or evaluate HCPs’ reflective portfolio submissions as part of annual licensure renewal or revalidation. Stakeholders in regulatory bodies should identify which outcomes are important and pertinent to both HCPs and the public and recommend specific CPD initiatives that address those outcomes. Once these measures are in place, regulatory bodies can then expect HCPs to provide concrete evidence that their reflective processes are addressing the specific outcomes. For example, regarding objective patient outcomes, they might require HCPs to show how they integrated new knowledge or skills arising from their reflective process (e.g., identification of learning goals) into their daily practice and patient care and to discuss whether or not this process resulted in improved patient outcomes.53,54\n\nThe lack of objective patient care and organizational outcomes reported in the articles in this review may arise from the lack of a theoretical model for the way HCPs identify outcomes for the purpose of reflection.55 A theoretical model that has been successfully applied to undergraduate medical education and outcome measurement is Kirkpatrick’s55 learning evaluation framework, which includes four levels – reaction, learning, behavior, and results.54,56,57,58 This framework is used to evaluate the effectiveness of a training programme, with each successive level representing more precise effectiveness, greater learning, and more profound results across a range of contexts (e.g., personal, organizational).54,58 Future research could explore its application to reflective learning activities with a range of HCPs.\n\nThe results from this review highlight a lack of consensus on which validated tools and measures ought to be applied when evaluating HCPs’ reflective activities. No authors indicated that the regulatory bodies used any objective summative measure. Outcome measures in most of the included studies were online assessments and cross-sectional surveys that assessed the acceptability and feasibility of providing reflective evidence of CPD. No authors discussed outcomes related to changes in HCPs’ practice or impacts pm their organizations where they practice. The lack of specified outcomes may be driven by a lack of validated tools to assess reflective activities by practising HCPs. A systematic review by Uygur and colleagues53 identified three validated assessments for evaluating reflection in medical students: the Reflective Ability Rubric59; the Groningen Reflection Ability Scale,60 a self-assessment tool; and the Reflection Evaluation for Learners’ Enhanced Competencies Tool.61 A validated instrument used to measure reflective thinking in students in non-medical health care professions is the Reflective Thinking Scale.62 These instruments have evidence of validity when used with health care professional students but may not be appropriate for licensed HCPs.\n\nRegulatory bodies must thoughtfully integrate measures of licensed HCPs’ reflective practices within their evaluation programmes. However, the use of these measures must be supported by adequate empirical evidence of their reliability, validity, acceptability, and feasibility1,63 and of the value of HCPs’ efforts to clinicians, patients, and/or organizations. Unless regulatory bodies link HCPs’ engagement in reflective practices to concrete or explicit outcomes, they continue to risk alienating HCPs who are reluctant to engage in and document the reflective process. Our review of the current state of knowledge on the topic of reflective practices to maintain competency and licensure demonstrates that the empirical evidence to support such requirements remains limited.\n\nAn interesting problem was made evident through this integrative review. Regulatory bodies expect HCPs to submit evidence of reflection without any pre-defined outcomes or objective evidence of its benefits for the clinician, patients, or the organization. At a personal level, some HCPs appear to be unconvinced that completing a portfolio with evidence of reflection is a valuable process that leads to improved practice. More robust empirical evidence is needed to direct regulatory bodies’ efforts to design the review of HCPs’ portfolios so that HCPs’ reflection can enhance their practice and improve patient care. Additionally, there is limited empirical evidence on ways to standardize format requirements and evaluation processes for reflective portfolios. Preliminary recommendations for standardizing licensure revalidation have been proposed elsewhere.64\n\nThe body of knowledge regarding portfolio use by regulatory bodies requires methodological strengthening. Regulatory bodies and researchers should identify realistic, feasible, and measurable outcomes for use in quantitative research, such as meaningful changes in clinical practice and organizational benefits, as well as factors that influence the acceptability of reflective writing. Additionally, researchers should use rigorous qualitative research methodology to explore the challenges HCPs experience when developing and using learning plans or goals for a portfolio and the ways they gauge the success of engagement in reflective practices. Because mentoring is associated with portfolio effectiveness,65 researchers should evaluate the benefits mentors provide to HCPs engaging in reflection as part of their CPD. Additionally, researchers could examine the role of reflection as a part of remediation by HCPs who have engaged in unprofessional conduct (e.g., breaches of professional boundaries, misrepresentation). Caldicott and d’Oronzio65 described using reflective essays by HCPs to evaluate the outcomes of an interdisciplinary professional ethics remediation programme. The reflective essay is intended to allow participants to analyze their violations as a case study. It allows participants to critically analyze the events and provide an opportunity to bring closure to the ordeal of accusation, verdict, discipline and restoration. This essay is then graded and forwarded to the individuals' disciplinary board (or other referring entity) to provide more holistic evidence of successful remediation.65 Finally, future research could consider whether combining reflective writing in portfolios with other tools and processes (e.g., review of adherence to documentation requirements) provides a broader view of the evidence of continuing competence, as has been reported elsewhere.66\n\nThis integrative review has several limitations. Although we conducted rigorous searches of four databases, we might have located additional information on portfolio use (e.g., processes, format, outcomes) by including a grey literature search of regulatory bodies’ websites worldwide. In addition, articles in languages other than English might have provided further insights."
