        "text": "The Ontario College of Teachers isâ¦.\n\nâThe regulatory college for the teaching profession in Ontario is the largest self-regulatory body in Canada. It was established on 20 May 1997. The college's mandate is to license, govern and regulate the practice of teaching. â(from the O.C.T. Google listing)\n\nThe teaching profession set up this body in 1997 to follow the lead of other professional bodies that already existed for professions such as doctors, nurses, lawyers, and architects. It guarantees the high standards established for these professions. Members of the public can rest assured that extremely high levels of professionalism are maintained within these groups.\n\nThere is no Ontario College of Tutors.\n\nAnyone can start a tutoring business and there is no regulatory body to maintain high standards. Many tutors do not have a teaching degree at all. Many tutors do not have a wide range of experience with different learning styles.\n\nAt Connect Education, all our tutors are Ontario Certified Teachers (O.C.T.). They are current or former classroom teachers with a vast range of experience. They can quickly assess and adapt their teaching style to best support their students and their individual learning needs. Our teachers teach virtually or in-person, whichever approach will most benefit the student. A major goal in our tutoring sessions is to minimize distractions. Many learning difficulties occur because of the wide range of classroom distractions. This is why at Connect Education we tutor one-to-one. Â\n\nThere is no Ontario College of Tutors, but there are Tutors that are certified educators.\n\nStart your child on the path towards reaching his or her academic potential today. Connect with Connect Education!\n\nâ"
