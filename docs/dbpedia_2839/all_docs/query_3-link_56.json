        "text": "As long as space remains in an Ontario college program, you may apply for it. However, there are some important dates to keep in mind, especially for popular programs that fill up quickly.\n\nApply to college as soon as the online application becomes available in October. Complete and pay for your application on or before February 1 in order to receive equal consideration for admission to programs beginning the following September.\n\nThe following dates apply to programs starting in the fall of 2025. The application process at ontariocolleges.ca follows an annual cycle, based on the academic year (August to July). For programs beginning at other times of the year, please contact the individual colleges for more information about application processing dates.\n\nEarly October 2024: Online Application Opens\n\nIn early October, access to the online college application becomes available for programs beginning in the following academic year (August to July). You may create an account and begin your application.\n\nNovember 1, 2024: Earliest Offer Date\n\nThis is the earliest date that colleges may begin to send offers of admission to programs for the upcoming academic year. Offers will continue to be issued until programs are filled or wait-lists are established.\n\nFebruary 1, 2025: Equal Consideration Date\n\nApply on or before this date in order to receive equal consideration for admission to programs starting the following fall. After this date, colleges consider applicants on a first-come, first-served basis until programs are full.\n\nNote that applications to Highly Competitive Programs must be received by this date in order to be considered.\n\nApplicants are encouraged to complete their applications well before the Equal Consideration Date, as website volumes on the online application are at their highest at this time.\n\nMany programs continue to accept applicants after February 1. Use our Find a Program tool at any time to find programs that are still open.\n\nMay 1, 2025: Deadline to Confirm Offers of Admission\n\nApplicants must confirm their acceptance of an offer of admission by this date. Log in to your ontariocolleges.ca account to confirm your offer.\n\nColleges may extend offers of admission after this date. Each college will set the deadline to confirm offers made after May 1, and this deadline will be communicated to you with your offer.\n\nJune 2025: Tuition Deposit Due at the Colleges\n\nThe colleges require payment of a tuition deposit in June to secure your spot in your program. Each college sets its own tuition deposit amount and payment deadline. This information will be communicated to you by the college."
