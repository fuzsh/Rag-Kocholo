        "text": "Article content\n\nA new Ontario requirement that high school kids take a mandatory tech course is being hailed as a good step, but worries abound over who will teach it and what the course will entail.\n\n“We’ve all heard about the need for a more detailed and advanced program for students to help fill some of the gaps we have in employment opportunities and openings across the province,” said Bill Tucker, a professor in the faculty of education at Western University and former education director at the Thames Valley District school board.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Ryan Pyette, Dale Carruthers, Jane Sims, Norman De Bono and others.
