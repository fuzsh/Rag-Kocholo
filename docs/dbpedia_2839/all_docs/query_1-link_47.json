        "text": "Abstract (summary): This study examines the development of the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) and teachers' response to it. The goal of the study is to determine the factors that assist or hinder one particular group's move to self-governance and to contribute to the understanding of professionalism among teachers and their growing awareness of self-governance. The first part of the research describes the development of the OCT as a self-regulating body by focusing on professional learning and accountability and traces these two aspects over time since the early 1800s in Ontario. It compares the OCT with two existing self-governance bodies in Scotland and British Columbia and examines the factors supporting and resisting a college of teachers concept. The quantitative, descriptive second part of the research identifies a sample of teachers' perceptions of the OCT and what impact teachers believe the College will have on them personally and professionally. The four grouped determinants used were Professional Standards, Professional Learning, Accountability, and Self-governance. The writer developed and tested the questionnaire used to determine the teachers' perceptions. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics to indicate frequencies and distributions, Chi-Square Test ([chi]2 ), the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test, the Friedman Test for Related Sample, Cronbach's alpha (Ãƒ), and ANOVA. The highly experienced, highly educated sample of teachers averages 18.3 years of teaching and 95.5% have a Bachelor's degree or higher. Such teachers' demographics as age, experience, etc. influenced their responses of support or opposition. Initially, 29% favoured the OCT idea, 35% were undecided and 39% were opposed; at the time of the study, 23% favoured the concept, 16% were undecided, and 61% were opposed. Teachers favour some aspects of a professional governance body; they believe that the profession is able to set and enforce professional standards. They show general support for self-regulation and responsibility tempered with a degree of uncertainty. Teachers both strongly support and strongly oppose the constituent items on the professional learning scale. The majority of teachers oppose this particular model of self-governance, although many are not opposed to a self-regulating body."
