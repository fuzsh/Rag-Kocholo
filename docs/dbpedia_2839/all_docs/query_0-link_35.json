        "text": "Is your profession regulated in Canada? If so, your international education may not be enough to start practising in your field here once you immigrate. Many professions, from health care to teaching to trades are regulated in Canada, meaning you will need to be certified to practise here. Depending on what your international credentials are, you may have to relicense, which would entail further studies, examinations and/or practicums.\n\nHere below is a resource list of the most common licensed professions and their related licensing or regulatory bodies.\n\nGenerally speaking, licensing bodies usually have an overarching national association, but licensing requirements are usually provincially based, so you’ll have to relicense with the provincial body, depending on which province or territory of Canada you make your new home.\n\nNote also that the relicensing process isn’t always the same in each province so certification in one province might not be automatically transferable to another, depending on the industry.\n\nThere are also a few organizations that offer a foreign credentials assessment service, where you can get more information on how transferable your international credentials are. But if you know your profession is licensed and you know which provincial regulatory body to go to, then going straight to them for more information first is often best.\n\nREAD MORE: Many colleges and universities or regulatory bodies offer immigrant bridging programs for several professions as well. Here’s a list of bridging programs.\n\nList of licensing bodies for regulated professions in Canada\n\nAccounting\n\nChartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA) or CPA Canada is the national organization established to support a unified Canadian accounting profession, amalgamating Canada’s previous CA, CGA and CMA designations.\n\nIf you’re an internationally trained accountant, you can contact the CPA licensing body in your province to find out how you can become licensed as a CPA in Canada. Note the CPA designation is different from CPA designations in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nProvincial/territorial accounting bodies\n\nCPA Alberta\n\nCPA British Columbia\n\nCPA Manitoba\n\nCPA Ontario\n\nCPA New Brunswick\n\nCPA Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nCPA Northwest Territories and Nunavut\n\nCPA Nova Scotia\n\nCPA Prince Edward Island\n\nCPA Quebec\n\nCPA Saskatchewan\n\nCPA Yukon\n\nArchitecture\n\nCanadian Architectural Certification Board is the national certification board of the architecture profession.

Each province/territory has a dental regulatory authority/licensing body that establishes regulations and requirements for the licensure of general practitioners within their jurisdiction. But like other professions, it has overarching national organizations where you can find more information, including Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada and National Dental Examining Board of Canada.\n\nProvincial/territorial dentistry bodies\n\nAlberta Dental Association and College\n\nCollege of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia\n\nManitoba Dental Association\n\nNew Brunswick Dental Society\n\nNewfoundland & Labrador Dental Board\n\nNorthwest Territories & Nunavut Dental Association\n\nProvincial Dental Board of Nova Scotia\n\nRoyal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario\n\nDental Council of Prince Edward Island\n\nOrdre des dentistes du Québec\n\nCollege of Dental Surgeons of Saskatchewan\n\nYukon Dental Association\n\nDietitians\n\nDietitians must register with the provincial regulatory body in order to practice. The regulatory body will assess your academic and practicum experience to determine eligibility. In most provinces, the national Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination (CDRE) is a requirement for registration once academic and practicum requirements have been met. The CDRE is administered by the provincial regulatory bodies listed below.
