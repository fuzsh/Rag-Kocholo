We value and maintain interconnections with local, national, and global learning communities through teaching, research and sharing of expertise that supports knowledge building. Our active alumni manifest pride in the Faculty of Education through engaging in collaborative initiatives and mentoring programs.\n\nGoals\n\nOur vision is built around five major goals:\n\nTo ground our practices in social justice and equity;\n\nTo ground our curriculum in the diverse lived experiences of our students;\n\nTo develop programs at all levels that meet the needs of the university and broader communities;\n\nTo align our curriculum with the Ontario Ministry of Education and Ontario College of Teachers, and\n\nTo develop and maintain a range of connections with local, national, and global learning communities.\n\nBack to Top\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nGraduates of the University of Windsor pre-service teacher education program will demonstrate:\n\nUnderstanding of the development of children and youth (intellectual, physical, emotional, social, creative, spiritual and moral) and the nature of learning;\n\nSound knowledge of subject matter, literacies, ways of knowing and pedagogical expertise;\n\nProfessional aptitude for observation, critique and assessment in order to improve student learning;\n\nRecognition of a range of knowledge and perspectives, including the importance of research;\n\nCompetence in critical reflection and commitment to professional learning in order to enhance and develop their practice;\n\nRecognition of the transformative power of learning for individuals and communities;\n\nRecognition that teachers are responsive and responsible to learners, families, colleagues, and communities;\n\nUnderstanding of professional standards of practice and ethical conduct;\n\nPedagogical praxis that is inclusive, collaborative, values diversity, and prepares students for living in an international and multicultural context;\n\nCommitment to the values of social justice, equity, and diversity in all aspects of their professional roles.\n\nBack to Top\n\nProfessionalism\n\nBecoming Professional\n\nThis year, you are joining a professional school. As a representative of the teaching profession, it is expected that you will reflect the attributes of a professional teacher both at the Faculty and in your field experiences. Faculty members are continually observing and assessing each teacher candidate in light of many professional qualities. Professional teachers are positive, honest, capable of facing problems constructively, motivated, motivating, and sensitive to others. They are punctual, well-organized, hardworking, and willing to contribute to the effectiveness of the school. Similar conduct is expected of teacher candidates at the University of Windsor’s Faculty of Education. As we are a professional school, not only will you learn how to teach, but most importantly, you will learn how to be a professional. As teachers, your professional conduct is guided by the Foundations of Professional Practice set out by the Ontario College of Teachers and the Teaching Profession Act established by the Ministry of Education in Ontario. The Foundations of Professional Practice outline the principles of ethical behaviour, professional practice, and ongoing learning for the teaching profession in Ontario, and are comprised of the Ontario College of Teachers’ Ethical Standards for the Teaching Profession,\n\nAwareness and understanding of the Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession and Professional Learning Framework is imperative, and a shared responsibility of teacher candidates, the Faculty of Education, and its school partners. A summary of the Foundations of Professional Practice is included below, and teacher candidates are expected to treat it as required reading.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSummary of Ethical Standards of the Teaching Profession\n\nPurposes\n\nTo inspire members to reflect and uphold the honour and dignity of the teaching profession.\n\nTo identify the ethical responsibilities and commitments in the teaching profession.\n\nTo guide ethical decisions and actions in the teaching profession.\n\nTo promote public trust and confidence in the teaching profession.\n\nEthical Standards\n\nCare\n\nThe ethical standard of Care includes compassion, acceptance, interest and insight for developing students’ potential. Members express their commitment to students’ well-being and learning through positive influence, professional judgment and empathy in practice.\n\nRespect\n\nIntrinsic to the ethical standard of Respect is trust and fair-mindedness. Members honour human dignity, emotional wellness and cognitive development. In their professional practice, they model respect for spiritual and cultural values, social justice, confidentiality, freedom, democracy and the environment.\n\nTrust\n\nThe ethical standard of Trust embodies fairness, openness, and honesty. Members’ professional relationships with students, colleagues, parents, guardians and the public are based on trust.\n\nIntegrity\n\nHonesty, reliability, and moral action are embodied in the ethical standard of Integrity. Continual reflection assists members in exercising integrity in their professional commitments and responsibilities.\n\nBack to Top\n\nStandards of Practice for the Teaching Profession\n\nPurposes\n\nTo inspire a shared vision for the teaching profession.\n\nTo identify the values, knowledge, and skills that are distinctive to the teaching profession.\n\nTo guide the professional judgment and actions of the teaching profession.\n\nTo promote a common language that fosters an understanding of what it means to be a member of the teaching profession.\n\nStandards\n\nCommitment to students and student learning\n\nMembers are dedicated in their care and commitment to students. They treat students equitably and with respect and are sensitive to factors that influence individual learning. Members facilitate the development of students as contributing citizens of Canadian society.\n\nProfessional knowledge\n\nMembers strive to be current in their professional knowledge and recognize its relationship to practice. They understand and reflect on student development, learning theory, pedagogy, curriculum, ethics, educational research and related policies and legislation to inform professional judgment in practice.\n\nLeadership in Learning Communities\n\nMembers promote and participate in the creation of collaborative, safe and supportive learning communities. They recognize their shared responsibilities and their leadership roles in order to facilitate student success. Members maintain and uphold the principles of the ethical standards in these learning communities.\n\nProfessional Practice\n\nMembers apply professional knowledge and experience to promote student learning. They use appropriate pedagogy, assessment and evaluation, resources and technology in planning for and responding to the needs of individual students and learning communities. Members refine their professional practice through ongoing inquiry, dialogue and reflection.\n\nOngoing Professional Learning\n\nMembers recognize that commitment to ongoing professional learning is integral to effective practice and to student learning. Professional practice and self-directed learning are informed by experience, research, collaboration and knowledge.\n\nBack to Top\n\nProfessional Learning Framework for the Teaching Profession\n\nPurposes\n\nAcknowledges the commitment members of the teaching profession make to professional learning.\n\nHighlights a range of options to improve practice and enhance student learning.\n\nIdentifies programs and professional learning activities accredited by the College.\n\nAssists members of the College to identify, collect, reflect upon and celebrate their learning experiences and accomplishments.\n\nAssures the profession and the public that College members have the opportunity through professional learning to remain current throughout their careers.\n\nBack to Top\n\nPrinciples Supported by the Professional Learning Framework\n\nThe goal of professional learning is the ongoing improvement of practice. Teacher learning is directly correlated to student learning.\n\nThe professional learning framework encourages learning activities based on provincial legislation and policy, system needs, personal growth needs and student learning needs. The framework also encourages members of the College to identify and pursue their strengths and personal interests to further their professional learning.\n\nStandards based professional learning provides for an integrated approach to teacher education.\n\nAll programs and professional learning activities accredited by the College must be designed to support the Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession and the Ethical Standards for the Teaching Profession.\n\nExemplary professional learning opportunities are based on the principles of effective learning.\n\nThe framework takes into account individual career and personal priorities. It outlines professional learning activities that are varied, flexible and accessible to members of the College.\n\nTeachers plan for and reflect on their professional learning\n\nResponsible lifelong learning is continuous learning that is initiated by members of the College and directed and reviewed by them on an ongoing basis.\n\nLearning communities enhance professional learning\n\nThe professional learning framework encourages collaboration. It supports ongoing commitment to improvement and currency of teaching practice as an individual and collective responsibility. It should be noted that professional learning is a legislated requirement under Regulation 176/10: Teachers' Qualifications of the Ontario College of Teachers Act.\n\nBack to Top\n\nFaculty of Education Professional Standards Committee\n\nUnprofessional conduct by teacher candidates is investigated by the Professional Standards Committee (PSC). The Mandate of the PSC is to review the performance of all teacher candidates deemed to have failed for cause, or failed Practice Teaching for issues related to inadequate teaching performance. The PSC makes recommendations of a teacher candidate’s status in the program and communicates this in writing to the Dean and to the teacher candidate. Candidates have the right to appeal the decision -- first, through the Dean of Education, and then through the Office of the Registrar, University of Windsor, if necessary. In all cases, teacher candidates are provided due process with opportunity to hear and respond to the case against them. It should be noted that failure may be the result of any serious contravention of the Ontario College of Teachers Standards of Practice and Ethical Standards for the teaching profession, including, but not limited to:\n\nProfessional misconduct during any component of the Faculty of Education program;\n\nAcademic misconduct during any component of the Faculty of Education program; and/or\n\nNeglect of teaching responsibilities and/or poor teaching performance during the practicum.\n\nBack to Top\n\nPolicies, Principles and Procedures\n\nAttendance Policy\n\nThe B.Ed. program is an intense and demanding program of professional preparation in which Teacher Candidates are expected to demonstrate high levels of both academic and professional integrity. Such integrity is demonstrated in part by engaged participation in all aspects of the program for which attendance at all classes, professional learning series workshops, and practicum activities is a prerequisite. As per Senate Bylaw 54, class participation may constitute up to 20% of a final mark in any course. Irregular attendance, habitual lateness, and/or unexcused absences will result in referral to the Associate Dean (Teacher Education) as it leads to gaps in learning and therefore inadequate preparation for practicum placements. At the discretion of the Associate Dean and/or the Professional Standards Committee, chronic attendance concerns may provide grounds for requiring a Teacher Candidate to withdraw from the program.\n\nCare for the Physical Environment\n\nTeacher candidates are encouraged to give due respect to the physical environment. Garbage and other waste should be properly disposed of in the appropriate containers strategically placed in the building. Please pay special attention to the recycling efforts by placing waste only in the designated containers. Graffiti on the desks and other furniture is unsightly and may also be considered as vandalism by the University. To prevent insect and rodent infestation, food and drink (except water) should not be brought in the classrooms. To prevent damage to equipment, food and drink are strictly prohibited in the computer labs, science lab and music room.\n\nCommunication\n\nE-mail is one of the official means of communication in the Faculty of Education. As with all official university communications, you are responsible for accessing your university email account on a frequent and consistent basis to stay informed of important university and program of study information, and/or to correspond with Faculty, Associate/Mentor Teachers, Faculty Advisors, and Staff.\n\nUpon registration, each teacher candidate will be assigned a University of Windsor \"uniform e-mail address\", which is typically a variation of “name@uwindsor.ca.\" Teacher candidates are required to use their assigned UWindsor email address for all communication with members of the university community/affiliations. Any other email address is invalid, and such communication will not be acknowledged or responded to.\n\nThe Ontario Teachers' Federation (OTF) has very strict policies regarding the use of e-mail. As teacher candidates are Associate Members of the OTF, you are bound by these regulations. Users are responsible for anything they post, publicly or privately (e.g. Facebook), and are accountable for what they write. Inappropriate behaviour could result in the termination of the user's account and possible legal action from the affected user(s). All online activity in the Faculty of Education (including correspondence with faculty, staff, associate teachers and faculty advisors) is governed by the University of Windsor's Acceptable Use Policy. Teacher candidates are encouraged to familiarize themselves with this policy.\n\nProgram Office and Staff\n\nThe Faculty of Education Program Office is staffed by a dedicated and hard working group of professionals whose mission is to serve the students of the faculty. The staff members do not make program policies; they help to communicate policy and procedures. Teacher candidates should extend to the office and custodial staff the respect and professional courtesies they deserve as members of our community.\n\nUse of Prohibited Substances and Weapons\n\nThe use and trafficking of alcohol, marijuana, other narcotics and illegal substances in the Faculty of Education building is strictly prohibited. Teacher candidates should not be in the building or classes inebriated, under the influence of narcotics, or reeking of alcohol, marijuana or other drugs. Also, the Faculty of Education is a non-smoking building and teacher candidates are asked to observe the signs and laws regarding smoking posted on the building. Firearms and other dangerous weapons are also strictly prohibited. Teacher candidates have an obligation to report the presence, trafficking, and/or use of dangerous and/or illegal, substances, and weapons in the Faculty of Education. Teacher candidates are encouraged to be vigilant and to contact the Faculty and/or Campus Police if they observe suspicious, illegal, or dangerous behaviour. The safety of our community is our shared responsibility. To contact Campus Police, please call (519) 253-3000 ext. 1234. For emergencies only, please dial 911.\n\nConflict Resolution\n\nTeacher candidates are encouraged to resolve conflicts in peaceful and professional ways. Physical and verbal attacks are unprofessional and could lead to failure for cause. It is advised that protagonists try to resolve issues through dialogue amongst themselves and their peers and seek mediation from a Faculty member, Advisor or the Experiential Learning Specialist if that does not work. Students are advised not to take matters into their own hands and resort to solutions that are unprofessional or criminal. Bystanders are encouraged to make every effort to diffuse such situations and to try to prevent escalation.\n\nAssignments\n\nDetails of assignments are provided in the individual course outlines. The final mark obtained is a percentile in compliance with the University of Windsor's Policy on Grading and Calculation of Averages.\n\nSubmitting assignments on time is a professional responsibility of teacher candidates, akin to a teacher's responsibility to complete report cards on schedule. For this reason, course instructors will not normally accept late submissions. When submitting assignments to the Program Office, teacher candidates should ensure that their work is stamped with the correct date and time. It is the responsibility of teacher candidates to ensure that work submitted electronically reaches the instructor, and that there is some evidence of date and time sent.\n\nPlagiarism Policy\n\nThe University of Windsor believes in the right of all students to be part of a University community where academic integrity is expected, maintained, enforced, and safeguarded. The university is a member of the Center for Academic Integrity (CAI) at Clemson University in South Carolina, and is committed to preserving academic integrity on its campus” (see the University of Windsor's Academic Integrity Office website).\n\nUniversity of Windsor Policy on Plagiarism\n\nPlagiarism is defined as: \"The act of appropriating the literary composition of another, or parts of passages of his or her writing, or the ideas or language of the same, and passing them off as the products of one's own mind.\" (Black's Law Dictionary). It is expected that all students will be evaluated and graded on their individual merit and all work submitted for evaluation should clearly indicate that it is the student's own contribution. Students often have to use the ideas of others as expressed in written or published work in preparing essays, papers, reports, theses and publications. It is imperative that both the data and the ideas obtained from all published and unpublished material be properly acknowledged and their sources disclosed. Failure to follow this practice constitutes plagiarism and is considered to be a serious offence. Thus, anyone who knowingly or recklessly uses the work of another person and creates an impression that it is his or her own, is guilty of plagiarism.\n\nPlagiarism also includes submitting one's own essay, paper, or thesis on more than one occasion. Accordingly, it is expected that a thesis, essay, paper or a report has not been and is not currently being submitted for credit for any other course. In exceptional circumstances and with the prior agreement of the instructor, a student may use research completed for one course as part of his or her written work for a second course. A confirmed incident of plagiarism will result in a sanction ranging from a verbal warning, to loss of credit in the course to expulsion. (see the University of Windsor's Senate Policy on Student Code of Conduct).\n\nThe Faculty of Education considers academic integrity to be critical not only because it protects the value of the degrees conferred by the institution and levels the playing field for the students trying to earn their degree but because integrity, honesty, trust, justice, and good judgment are pillars of professional ethics among teachers. A society depends on its teachers to help in the socialization of its citizenry and, as role models, teachers are held to high moral and ethical standards. Teacher candidates are hereby advised that instructors are duty bound to report cases of academic dishonesty including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating on examinations and other forms of assessment, impersonation, falsification of information, and misrepresentation of the facts of a case.\n\nInstructors will also use a variety of mechanisms to verify students’ work including Safe Assign (on Blackboard). Students should also use these avenues to check their work before submission. Cases of plagiarism are first investigated by the Faculty before being referred to the University’s Academic Integrity Office. Cases might eventually end up before University Judicial Panels. Teacher candidates are expected to become familiar with the University’s policies on academic dishonesty. Students are encouraged to visit the Academic Integrity Office for access to specific case studies. Teacher candidates are also urged to familiarize themselves with Senate Bylaw 31: Academic Integrity, which sets out the university’s policy on such matters.\n\nSpecial Needs\n\nStudents with special needs who require reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact the Student Accessibility Services Office (Email: sas@uwindsor.ca) early in each semester to complete the necessary forms and obtain the necessary documentation. Relevant documents must be presented to the Program Office and course instructors to ensure that the required accommodations are provided.\n\nMental Health\n\nFrom time to time, students face obstacles that can affect academic performance. If you experience difficulties and need help, it is important to reach out to someone.\n\nFor help addressing mental or physical health concerns on campus, call (519) 253-3000 and one of the following extentions:\n\nStudent Health Services at ext. 7002\n\nStudent Counselling Centre at ext. 4616\n\nPeer Support Centre at ext. 4551\n\n24 hour support is available\n\nMy Student Support Program (MySSP) is an immediate and fully confidential 24/7 mental health support that can be accessed for free through online chat and telephone. This service is available to all University of Windsor students and offered in over 30 languages. Call: 1-844-451-9700, visit keep.meSAFE ,or download the My SSP App through Apple or Google Play.\n\nA full list of on and off-campus resources is available through the Wellness Outreach Office website (Office of Student Experience).\n\nShould you need to request alternative accommodations, contact your Instructor(s) or the Associate Dean of Teacher Education.\n\nFaculty of Education Examination Policy Overview\n\nSome Faculty of Education instructors will set final examinations, mid-term examinations and in- class tests for their courses. Final examinations are typically held twice per year- once in the Fall term and once in the Winter term. The examination dates are set by the Faculty of Education. The format of the examination is the purview of course instructors. Mid-term examinations and class tests and quizzes are arranged by individual instructors usually during regular class times. Examination dates are set within the first two weeks of each term and can only be changed by the Faculty of Education.\n\nMissed Examination Policy\n\nMissed examinations and tests in the Faculty of Education will be assigned a mark of zero (0). Consistent with University of Windsor's Senate Bylaw 51: Academic Evaluation Procedures, a teacher candidate who wishes to receive consideration on matters affecting or shown to have affected their academic performance should communicate with their instructor as soon as possible. Any student who is compelled to miss an examination or test as a result of an unanticipated extenuating circumstance beyond their control is entitled to request a supplemental/makeup examination. A Teacher Candidate requesting a supplemental examination in a Faculty of Education course is obliged to adhere to the formal Faculty of Education Supplemental Examination Request Procedure, which is outlined below. Aegrotat standing will not be extended to a teacher candidate who has not exhausted the remedies available through the Faculty of Education supplemental examination request procedure.\n\nFaculty of Education Supplemental Examination Request Procedure\n\nA teacher candidate requesting a supplemental final examination for a Faculty of Education course must complete the Supplemental Examination Request Form for each supplemental examination request, providing a reason for the request and supporting documentation. The applicant must obtain the authorization of the instructor that a supplemental examination will be provided and that the instructor will be available at the suggested time provided that the request is approved by the Associate Dean’s Office.\n\nThe request form must be submitted to the Associate Dean’s Office for review after the payment of a non-refundable Supplemental Examination Administration Fee of $20.00 for each supplemental examination request submission. A student may be approved to write only one supplemental examination for each examination missed, and the Dean of Education reserves the right to deny any supplemental examination request. In the case of mid-term and other tests, teacher candidates must request supplementals directly from the relevant instructors. Accommodations will not be afforded for personal convenience and the conditions for make-up tests shall conform to those outlined in the next section.\n\nAcceptable Conditions for Supplemental Examinations\n\nConsistent with University of Windsor policies and bylaws, the Faculty of Education will consider a supplemental examination request based on one of the following five conditions:\n\nExamination Conflict.\n\nIn accordance with Senate policy E2, a Teacher Candidate who is scheduled to write three examinations in one calendar day or scheduled to write two examinations at exactly the same time may apply to have one of these examinations rescheduled. In all cases Teacher Candidates must submit an application for an alternative examination to the office of the Dean of Education within two weeks of receiving their course outlines or two weeks of the posting of the examination schedule. Consultations between the Deans office and the instructors will determine the examination or test which will be rescheduled.\n\nReligious Obligation.\n\nThe Faculty of Education recognizes and values religious diversity and will provide reasonable accommodations to Teacher Candidates who for religious reasons, are unable to attend an examination, test or other mandatory academic event. Consistent with University of Windsor Human Rights Office recommendations, a Teacher Candidate must submit a written request for an alternative date to write a test or final examination due to a conflict with a religious observance to the Dean of Education who will review the application and make alternative arrangements. Teacher Candidates may be asked to provide specific documentation to support their application. Where religious observance days are set Teacher Candidates must submit their applications within the first 4 weeks of the term after receiving their course outlines with test dates. Where religious holy days are dependent on lunar cycle or other variable phenomena Teacher Candidates must forewarn the Dean as soon as possible and then follow-up when the observance date has been set.\n\nBereavement.\n\nThe Faculty of Education will provide accommodations to Teacher Candidates on compassionate grounds when they are grieving for a family member. A Teacher Candidate may request a supplemental examination for any Faculty of Education final examination, mid-term examination or class test scheduled within five (5) days of the death of a family member. For the purpose of this accommodation a family member is defined as: a spouse/partner, child (including step-child), parent (including in-laws and stepparents), sibling (including in-law and step-sibling) grandparent (including grandparent of a spouse/partner), and grandchild. Teacher Candidates should inform the Program Office of the bereavement at their earliest convenience and immediately upon their return and complete and submit the necessary documentation, which specifically identifies the bereaved individual and their relationship to the deceased. Teacher Candidate will be required to provide support by some evidence of the bereavement (a death announcement or funeral program will suffice). Compassionate accommodation is also available for missed classes.\n\nMedical.\n\nIn accordance with University of Windsor, Senate Bylaw 51, a Teacher Candidate with serious health circumstances may request a supplemental examination on medical grounds. The Teacher Candidate must submit a completed request form along with supporting documentation to the Associate Dean’s Office within two (2) weeks of the missed examination or test. A completed Faculty of Education Teacher Candidate Medical Certificate signed by the treating physician for a period which includes the date of the missed examination is the only acceptable evidence. Regular doctors’ notes will not be accepted as supporting documentation for a medical condition.\n\nOther Extenuating Circumstances.\n\nConsistent with University of Windsor Senate Bylaw 51, a Teacher Candidate may request a supplemental examination based on other extenuating circumstance beyond his or her control not provided for under the categories outlined above (for example, jury duty). Every effort should be made to inform the Associate Dean’s Office of any known extenuating circumstance affecting their completion of an examination or test and to submit a supplemental examination request within two weeks of the missed examination or test. The Faculty of Education will investigate every request on its own merit and reserves the right to approve or deny.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Faculty of Education reserves the right to investigate all requests for accommodations and approval or denial is at the Associate Dean’s discretion. Abuse of the accommodations in any way (for example, submitting a false or partially false claim, falsifying reports, forgery of signatures) will be considered to be an egregious breach of trust, integrity and professionalism and will be referred to the Professional Standards Committee.\n\n*Due to COVID-19 precautionary mesasures, all documents are to be submitted to the Program Office by email only at educ@uwindsor.ca. Support staff continue to work remotely until further notice.\n\nBack to Top\n\nConsecutive Pre-service Program Structure\n\nOverview\n\nLike other institutions in a rapidly changing world, faculties of education constantly strive to respond to new developments in order to meet the needs of schools, communities, and society at large. This section of the program guide outlines the program of study designed to prepare future teachers of elementary and secondary students to meet these needs and to respond to current and anticipated developments and changes of the Ontario Ministry of Education.\n\nThere are three symbiotic and integrated components to the pre-service education program. These are:\n\nAcademic Program Component\n\nField Experience Component\n\nProfessional Learning Component\n\nThe field experience component is described in the Field Experience Handbook. This section outlines the key elements of the academic program and the professional learning components.\n\nAcademic Program Structure\n\nThe academic program is organized into three divisions for the purpose of structuring courses and certification. The three divisions are:\n\nPrimary/Junior (Grades JK – 6);\n\nJunior/Intermediate (Grades 4 – 10); and\n\nIntermediate/Senior (Grades 7 – 12)\n\nSeveral types of courses are offered in the Faculty of Education. These courses may be identified as:\n\nFoundations Courses;\n\nMethodology Courses;\n\nTeachable Subjects; (J/I and I/S) and\n\nService Learning Courses\n\nThe Foundations courses introduce teacher candidates to the fundamentals of teaching and learning. These are courses that all teacher candidates take irrespective of division and are typically taught in larger size classes. General methodology courses facilitate exposure to appropriate pedagogies for engaging learners in a range of subject areas that are core components of the Ontario curriculum. In the Junior/Intermediate and Intermediate/Senior divisions, teacher candidates receive instruction on instructional practices and pedagogy that are appropriate to their specialist teaching subjects. These are called Teachable subjects and each J/I student has one while I/S students have two. General methodology and teachable courses are taught in smaller classes to facilitate closer interaction and collaboration. In addition, the faculty offers a number of elective courses that provide enrichment to participating teacher candidates known as Service Learning. All teacher candidates select one by Winter of Year 1.\n\nGraduation Requirements\n\nIn order to complete the Bachelor of Education Degree and be recommended to the Ontario College of Teachers for certification, teacher candidates must meet the expectations in all areas of the pre-service education program. This means that candidates must successfully complete their course work, field experience, professional learning series activities and the Professional Growth Portfolio.\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\nThe B.Ed. program is a four-term, full-time program with 2 fall/winter terms.\n\nTo advance through the program each Teacher Candidate is evaluated on a regular basis with varying assessment tools throughout each academic year. To remain in the program, the Teacher Candidate must maintain a satisfactory level of performance in all courses including the practicum field experience.\n\nA Teacher Candidate who fails to maintain a satisfactory level of performance may at the discretion of the Dean or Dean’s designate, be Required to Withdraw or be placed on Academic Probation/Conditional Status.\n\nReasons for Withdrawal, Academic Probation/Conditional Status will be provided to the student in writing:\n\nTeacher Candidates who are placed on Academic Probation will be given a set of conditions to be met for successful completion of their program.\n\nTeacher Candidates who are required to withdraw will be allowed to reapply following a full academic year of hiatus.\n\nTeacher Candidates who withdraw from the program or who are required to withdraw will not retain credit for courses or practica that may have been completed at the time of the withdrawal.\n\nYear 1 to Year 2 requirements to Graduation\n\nAn overall weighted average of 70% or better is required in course work, with a minimum grade of 70% in each of the JI or IS teachables.\n\nA minimum grade of 60% in any course is required by the Ontario College of Teachers, to be reported to them for entry on student’s certificate of qualification.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, students may defer enrollment into year 2 to complete year 1 requirements. This is adjudicated by the Associate Dean of Teacher Education\n\nFailure in any practicum may result in failure of the program. Exceptions and makeup placements are on a case by case basis and adjudicated by the Associate Dean of Teacher Education with the Field Experience Coordinator.\n\nRequirements for practice teaching are outlined in the Field Experience Handbook.\n\nValues and Beliefs that Guide the Pre-service Program\n\nThe goals of our pre-service programs are the result of a fundamental set of beliefs and values about education broadly, and more specifically, teaching and learning. While acknowledging a diverse range of philosophical perspectives among our expert faculty many of our practices stem from a constructivist point of view which builds upon the philosophical principles of progressive education. Some key elements include student-centred active learning, authentic activities, and integration of prior experiences. We are focused on providing prospective teachers with what they need to know in order to teach diverse student bodies. We value teaching in ways that emphasize the understanding of differences that may arise from diverse cultures, family experiences, multiple intelligences, and learning styles. The following directional statements focus the pre-service program:\n\nWe believe that effective teachers are able to work with students with a wide range of learning needs, including those with exceptionalities.\n\nWe believe teacher candidates learn best by doing and reflecting, collaborating with skilled professionals, and by sharing their experiences.\n\nWe believe our graduates must be given opportunities to develop a professional sense of accountability, which includes an understanding of the social and moral responsibilities that underlie the teaching profession.\n\nUltimately, the Faculty of Education seeks to prepare new teachers for the task of preparing their students to be responsible and productive citizens. We stress the importance of teachers recognizing the enormous influence they will have on students. They must continuously evaluate what students are thinking and modify their plans to take into account what they discover. In this regard, we promote the notion that teachers are powerful classroom ethnographers with the ability to analyse and explain to themselves and to others why they do the things they do. We believe teacher candidates should internalize the dispositions and skills needed to study their teaching and to become better at teaching over time. That is, they should be committed to taking responsibility for their own professional development and lifelong learning.\n\nGoals for Pre-service Teacher Education\n\nTo elucidate for teacher candidates the various conventional and innovative techniques and strategies of teaching and to relate them to the learner, his or her development and grade level, and his or her interests and competencies. This goal is based on the premise that teaching is an art that combines vision with ability.\n\nTo introduce teacher candidates to philosophies and research findings relevant to the teaching profession through the study of foundational subjects. This goal is based on the notion that critical awareness of educational research findings, practices and controversies is crucial to developing teaching professionals.\n\nTo provide teacher candidates with meaningful teaching and learning experiences. This objective is based on the importance of learning from developing exemplary teaching and learning praxis.\n\nAlthough faculty members' courses reflect their own philosophy of teaching in a particular subject area, there are many commonalities in educational philosophy which are manifested in our courses a/an:\n\nfocus on learning outcomes and expectations;\n\nfocus on integrated learning;\n\ninclusive curriculum to ensure that all students, regardless of gender, racial and ethno-cultural background, social class, all sexual orientation, or ability, are motivated to succeed;\n\nfocus on accountability and standards;\n\nfocus on collaboration with other professionals, parents and the community.\n\nIn addition, each faculty member teaches with a view to providing an environment in which students are encouraged to:\n\ncommunicate effectively;\n\nsolve problems and make responsible decisions using critical and creative thinking;\n\nuse technology effectively;\n\ndemonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems;\n\napply the skills needed to work and get along with other people;\n\nparticipate as responsible citizens in the life of the local, national, and global communities;\n\nexplore educational and career opportunities;\n\napply ethical judgment in everyday life;\n\nmake wise and safe choices for healthy living;\n\nuse the skills of learning to learn more effectively.\n\nBack to Top\n\nPrimary/Junior Program\n\nThis section of the program guide outlines the program of study designed to prepare future teachers of elementary school students in the Primary/Junior division.\n\nRationale\n\nCourses in the Primary/Junior (P/J) program provide experiences for teacher candidates to become familiar with the theory and practice underlying child-centred, outcome-based programs. Typically, teachers of kindergarten to grade six students in Ontario schools are responsible for teaching all subject areas including: language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, art, health and physical education, music, drama and dance. At the same time, teachers are expected to integrate technology into their teaching and differentiate their instruction to meet all students' needs. It is necessary then for P/J candidates to become knowledgeable about theories of learning, curriculum guidelines, and content and methodology appropriate to all levels from junior kindergarten to grade six.\n\nAccordingly, courses have been designed to provide opportunities for students to experience and participate in both theoretical discussions and practical activities, which can be applied to teaching situations and educational issues. Courses emphasize active involvement, reflective practice, integration of curriculum, collaborative efforts, leadership and development of personal philosophies of education.\n\nGoals\n\nThe goals of the P/J foundations and methodology courses are to prepare teacher candidates to (a) understand and meet the needs of young children, and (b) create connected, interrelated learning experiences and environments for students in Grades JK through 6.\n\nAims\n\nTo provide teacher candidates with a solid background in child development issues which affect teaching and learning including differences among learners and strategies for catering to these differences;\n\nTo further develop in teacher candidates a caring and compassionate disposition for young children;\n\nTo introduce teacher candidates to a vast repertoire of exemplary classroom practices appropriate to Grades JK-6.\n\nScope\n\nCourses for the Primary/Junior Division focus on a number of issues including:\n\nThe context for change\n\nThe world of children is changing for a variety of reasons, among them:\n\nAn increasingly diverse school population;\n\nFamilies and support systems shifting;\n\nIncreased mobility;\n\nChanging values, technology and media.\n\nAccordingly, schools must forge stronger ties with families, communities, and community agencies.\n\nThe child's world\n\nChanges in society influence attitudes and the way children learn:\n\nChildren must learn to deal critically with the media and to use it to learn;\n\nChildren should learn to work with technology at an early age;\n\nSchools are linked to a variety of support structures;\n\nMany children need special services and programs.\n\nHow children learn\n\nThree key factors play an important role in how children learn:\n\n(i) Play:\n\n​​Children learn through play;\n\nPlay develops creativity, problem solving, language and social skills;\n\nChildren gain independence, confidence and new understandings;\n\nChildren learn best when play is self-directed;\n\nIt is the teacher's challenge to capitalize on the natural curiosity, playfulness and energy of young children;\n\nLearning environments should be:\n\nRich in materials;\n\nAppropriate for age and level of development; and\n\nBalanced between indoor and outdoor activities.\n\n(ii) Language:\n\n​As language skills develop, children gain autonomy, develop more complex thinking capabilities and broaden their concepts of time, space, matter, energy and life;\n\nLanguage is the basis of literacy;\n\nLearning environments should provide opportunities for children to:\n\nTalk in a variety of social settings and for a variety of purposes;\n\nCommunicate symbolically\n\nListen to stories, rhymes, songs.\n\n(iii) Adults:\n\nThe presence and behaviour of adults in the classroom impacts on the quality of play and learning and on the development of independence and confidence in the children;\n\nA high degree of parental involvement is characteristic of quality programs.\n\nKey Features\n\nCurriculum focusing on:\n\nCross-curricular learning;\n\nInstructional strategies, which are holistic and child-centred;\n\nOutcomes/expectations-based teaching and learning;\n\nIssues of equity, diversity and social justice; and\n\nLiteracy, numeracy, basic skills, science, technology, mathematics, and the concepts of environment, time and place.\n\n2. Working with Children:\n\nGroups of various sizes and ages;\n\nEarly identification of children at risk;\n\nAddressing children’s needs: social, emotional, physical, cultural, intellectual,\n\nRemedial, preventive and enrichment strategies;\n\nCooperative learning strategies;\n\nTeaching children with exceptionalities; and\n\nEffective communication with parents.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJunior/Intermediate Program\n\nThis section of the Program Guide outlines the program of study designed to prepare future teachers of Junior/Intermediate students.\n\nRationale\n\nCourses in the Junior/Intermediate program will focus on content and methods appropriate to teaching students in Grades 4 to 10. It is typical in many schools for teachers of Grades 4 to 8 to teach a wide variety of subject areas and so it is necessary for each Junior/Intermediate (J/I) teacher candidate to become knowledgeable about the curriculum guidelines, content and methodology appropriate to many subject areas. Accordingly, the J/I methodology courses have been developed to provide teacher candidates with an introduction to instructional methods and subject content related to art, language arts, mathematics, music, physical and health education, science, social studies, drama and dance. At the same time, teachers are expected to integrate technology into their teaching and differentiate their instruction to meet all students' needs.\n\nCertification in the Junior/Intermediate division licenses the holder to teach in both elementary (Grades 4-8) and secondary (Grades 9 and 10) panels. The role of the teacher is different in the two panels in many ways. The J/I foundational and general methodology courses have been designed to prepare J/I teacher candidates to teach in both of these two panels. Specifically, the courses provide insight into teaching the adolescent student. Adolescents have needs in the physical, social, emotional and intellectual realms.\n\nPhysical needs: Early adolescents experience hormonal changes which impact upon overall growth and development at times and rates unique to each individual. Physically, they must have opportunities to move about within their environment during school time as well as having the opportunity to develop physical skills in both competitive and non-competitive ways.\n\nSocial needs: In search of a personal identity, early adolescents seek to gain acceptance from a variety of audiences. Socially, they must experience positive interdependence while learning the rules of social interaction. They also must experience positive and regular reinforcement for significant efforts and accomplishments. They should have opportunities for input into the planning and management of their environment and activities. As everything in their world is in a state of flux, they must enjoy a secure environment in which experimentation is encouraged and supported.\n\nEmotional needs: Early adolescents view their surroundings as if they were examining a mirror in which they reflect and project themselves as part of a personally expanding and uncertain world. Emotionally, they must receive peer approval and adult approval; it is important for them to be liked and respected. To participate in interaction they must understand the reason behind rules while experiencing fairness.\n\nIntellectual needs: Early adolescents demonstrate uneven progress toward abstract thinking with frequent returns to concrete experiences in order to support and verify learning. Intellectually, they must engage in relevant and connected learning experiences which are intellectually stimulating and challenging and they must have time to explore and address individual interests. They must have opportunities to make value judgements and informed decisions.\n\nGoals\n\nThe goals of the J/I foundations and methodology courses are to prepare teacher candidates to (a) meet the needs of early adolescents, and (b) create connected, interrelated learning experiences and environments for students in grades 4 through 10. In their teachable course J/I candidates will learn about a wide variety of pedagogical principles and practices that can be used to effectively teach their specialist subject at different grade levels.\n\nAims\n\nIn order to help each J/I teacher candidate become a proficient teacher, courses aim to:\n\nFocus on the acquisition and application of appropriate teaching strategies in order to meet the needs of learners in heterogeneous groupings;\n\nPromote a collaborative culture in which reflection and experimentation in teaching practices will be encouraged; and\n\nSuggest a broad range of assessment and reporting practices, which reflect awareness of student needs.\n\nScope\n\nTeacher candidates in the Junior/Intermediate division are prepared to teach from grade 4 through 10 which means that there is an overlap between the elementary and secondary school panels. Courses in the Faculty of Education are designed with this in mind to ensure that our graduates have the kind of preparation which honours the certification they will obtain from the Ontario College of Teachers. Since the J/I division extends to Grade 10, some attention will be given in all courses to foundational issues, methodology and content which are appropriate up to this grade. However, the major coverage of the curriculum and instruction of Grades 9 and 10 will be in teacher candidates' particular specialty or \"teachable\" subject.\n\nKey Features\n\nA number of core topics are common among the various subject areas. They include:\n\nactivity-based learning\n\nphilosophy of teaching\n\ninstructional planning\n\ncritical thinking\n\noutcome-based learning\n\nclassroom management\n\ncooperative learning\n\nintegration across subjects\n\nareas questioning\n\nevaluation strategies\n\neffective classroom environment\n\nThese topics will be presented in all subject areas, and will reflect the uniqueness of the subject area involved.\n\nBack to Top\n\nIntermediate/Senior Program\n\nThis section of the Program Guide outlines the program of study designed to prepare future teachers of Intermediate/Senior (I/S) students.\n\nRationale\n\nStudents in grades 7 and 8 have needs in the physical, social, emotional and intellectual realms. Many of these needs are also common to older teenagers as would be typical in grades 9 and 10. These are described in the preceding Junior/Intermediate program description. Secondary school teacher candidates must be prepared to help students make the emotional and intellectual transition from elementary school and prepare them for higher education and the world of work. With this in mind courses in the Faculty of Education will prepare teacher candidates to engage their students in research, critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making. Courses will also focus on communication and the use of technology as an educational tool.\n\nGoals\n\nThe goals of the I/S foundational and general methodology courses are to prepare teacher candidates to (a) meet the needs of early adolescents, teenagers and young adults; and (b) create connected, interrelated learning experiences and environments for students in grades 7 and 8. Goals for the teachable courses will be detailed in the individual course outlines but generally these courses seek to introduce teacher candidates to and develop their competence in selecting and using an extensive repertoire of pedagogical strategies and their underlying theoretical principles that are specific to (though not always unique) these subjects. Courses in the teachable subjects typically focus on the Grade 9-12 curriculum.\n\nAims\n\nIn order to help each I/S teacher candidate become a proficient teacher, courses aim to:\n\nFocus on the acquisition and application of appropriate teaching strategies in order to meet the needs of learners in heterogeneous groupings;\n\nPromote a collaborative culture in which reflection and experimentation in teaching practices will be encouraged; and\n\nPresent a broad range of assessment and reporting practices, which reflect awareness of student needs.\n\nScope\n\nTeacher candidates in the I/S division are being prepared to teach grades 7-12. The Faculty of Education is committed to honouring this range of grades, which straddles both the elementary and secondary panels in concrete ways. Since certification of Intermediate/Senior teacher candidates includes grades 7 and 8, the focus of the foundation and general methodology courses includes these grades. Grades 9 through 12 are usually the focus in the two \"teachable\" courses.\n\nKey Features\n\nCooperative and collaborative learning\n\nCross-curricular integration and connections\n\nIntegrated and interdisciplinary learning\n\nInteractive and experiential teaching and learning strategies\n\nSelf-directed learning\n\nClass presentations\n\nMicro-teaching\n\nAuthentic assessment and evaluation\n\nProblem-based learning\n\nInquiry and discovery learning\n\nBack to Top\n\nProfessional Learning Series\n\nThe Faculty of Education is committed to the principles and value of professional learning for teachers as part of their on-going development as professionals. This is in keeping with the Standards of Professional Practice for the Teaching Profession as articulated by the OCT. In order to support teacher candidates’ professional development at the beginning of their career preparation, the Faculty of Education has designed a series of workshops, presentations and seminars which make up the Professional Learning Series.\n\nThe Professional Learning Series is a critical component of the pre-service program. Faculties of Education across Ontario understand that course offerings cannot cover the plethora of critical knowledge, skills and attitudes that teachers need to be effective in today’s classrooms. The Professional Learning Series provides learning experiences that reinforce, complement and supplement regular pre-service courses. It provides opportunities for teacher candidates to learn from education experts and policy makers outside of the faculty including Associate/Mentor Teachers, Ontario Teachers Federation members, School and Board administrators, Ministry of Education personnel, and Ontario College of Teachers officials. The series, therefore, expands and enhances the learning experiences of teacher candidates and their full engagement signals the beginning of their life-long commitment to on-going professional learning and development.\n\nThis series comprises a slate of workshops and presentations, which include those related to program orientation, pedagogical issues and professional practice. Other sessions provide information to teacher candidates needed to make the transition to the ranks of the profession. It is strongly advised that teacher candidates attend them.\n\nService Learning Courses\n\nWe offer future educators unique learning opportunities through service learning and global initiatives. Our courses and initiatives coupled with strategic collaborative partnerships with school boards, universities and community-based organizations provide our teacher candidates with rich intellectual and experiential learning opportunities.\n\nService-learning courses blend service activities with academic curriculum to address community need (whether it be local or international) while providing the teacher candidate with the skills to develop the professional attitudes and values required for successful teaching.\n\nThe Faculty of Education offers a comprehensive and extensive range of service-learning courses. Teacher candidates, from all three divisions, are required to take a service-learning, enrichment course as part of their teacher training.\n\nBack to Top\n\nProfessional Growth (e-Portfolio)\n\nAt the University of Windsor’s Faculty of Education, the Professional-Growth Portfolio is conceived as a vehicle for demonstrating the beginning teacher’s evolving professional growth and for establishing a foundation for reflection and further development. As such, the portfolio provides a framework and process for teacher candidates to describe and analyse their knowledge, learning experiences, skills and values within the context of an integrated collection of purposefully selected artifacts. The Professional-Growth Portfolio is a fundamental component of the pre-service program bringing together and demonstrating candidate’s learning from the different areas of the program - coursework, field experience and professional learning activities. It is, therefore, a capstone performance task which forms a major component of the summative evaluation of the readiness of teacher candidates to teach.\n\nPortfolio Framework\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Portfolio serves four purposes:\n\nTo encourage teacher candidates to integrate and interrelate theory, practice and other professional experiences;\n\nTo promote reflection in action;\n\nTo make visible a candidate’s progress in achieving program outcomes; and\n\nTo provide additional data and context for determining a candidate’s final evaluation in the practicum.\n\nOutcomes\n\nBy completing the Professional Growth Portfolio, teacher candidates will:\n\ndevelop skills in demonstrating and reflecting on professional learning;\n\npresent materials in an organized, concise and readable manner;\n\naccept responsibility for their continuing professional growth by focusing on program outcomes and developing a professional growth plan;\n\nprovide evidence to support their teaching philosophy; and\n\nsubstantiate reflection through a process of collecting and analysing data focusing on program outcomes.\n\nFeatures\n\nImportant features of the portfolio include the following:\n\nIt is well-organized. Organization of the portfolio is based on the OCT Standards of Practice using the Organizational Outline suggested below. Clear organization makes the candidate’s growth apparent;\n\nIt is tightly focused and clearly presented – it is NOT the complete collection of artifacts a candidate will accumulate during the pre-service year; and\n\nEach artifact is accompanied by a brief reflective statement – without them the portfolio becomes a collection or scrapbook, NOT a portfolio – see Reflective Statements below.\n\nOrganizational Outline\n\nRequired Content:\n\nIntroduction (1-2 pages): An overview which describes the contents of the portfolio and how these contents demonstrate the candidate’s growth and achievement of program outcomes.\n\nTable of Contents (Drop down menu)\n\nA Statement of Teaching Philosophy (1 page)\n\nSelf-selected artifacts and accompanying reflections (about 10 artifacts, with at least one under each Standard of Practice), which provide evidence of professional growth in achieving program outcomes see Self Selected Artifacts below.\n\nProfessional Growth Plan: A plan for continued professional growth the pre-service year. (Template will be provided by Faculty Advisor).\n\nCopies of all practice teaching reports.\n\nA 1000 word reflection on the mandatory professional learning series workshops\n\nOptional Content : Other items of the candidate’s choosing\n\nNote: Candidates are strongly encouraged to be selective and concise in their descriptions, and it is recommended that Portfolios be presented in the e-portfolio format on Blackboard.\n\nSelf-Selected Artifacts\n\nArtifacts should be chosen carefully to demonstrate and document the teacher candidate’s efforts to achieve program outcomes in support of the OCT Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession and to meet expectations as outlined in the Portfolio Assessment Rubric.\n\nArtifacts to be included under each Standard may be generated as part of course-work and field experiences, or they may be created specifically for the portfolio. Some potential examples are provided below, though these are neither exhaustive nor prescriptive.\n\nCourse work experiences (e.g., assignments, readings, summary of class discussion)\n\nReflections on teaching praxis – critique of theory in action (e.g., observations concerning the educator’s role in the development of community within the school)\n\nAudiovisual or other instructional materials developed and used by the candidate\n\nObservations and critiques of schooling\n\nCase study of special learner(s) or lesson plans showing accommodations/modifications made for the learner in a heterogeneous classroom\n\nNewsletter or letter home to parents\n\nFeedback from advisors, colleagues, principals, parents, or students\n\nAn annotated bibliography of readings completed during the program\n\nUnit/lesson plans developed to achieve specific learning outcomes\n\nCritique of lesson/unit plan(s) used to foster social justice (inclusion and respect) in the classroom\n\nData on teaching effectiveness (e.g., associate teacher reports)\n\nA record and critique of innovative methods initiated (e.g., cooperative learning introduced into a traditional classroom)\n\nSamples of assessment instruments such as rubrics, checklists or other record-keeping devices developed by the candidate to assess individual learners' progress toward instructional goals\n\nParagraph describing the candidate’s learning from a professional development activity/workshop/conference\n\nOther examples of community service and/or involvement may provide relevant and appropriate entries\n\nReflective Statements\n\nA statement, including the following, should accompany each artifact:\n\nDate the artifact was completed\n\nDescription of the artifact, including its learning context\n\nConnection to Program Outcomes/Standards of Practice – Which standard does the artifact address?\n\nReflection about the artifact – a discussion of how the selected artifact is relevant to the teacher candidate’s continued professional growth.\n\nReflective statements should be concise and focused (about 250 words).\n\nAssessment\n\nThe Portfolio will be formally reviewed by the teacher candidate and the faculty advisor twice each year – a Formative review in January and a Summative review in April following the final placement.\n\nBack to Top\n\nGrading\n\nGrading Criteria: To some extent, grading criteria will shift to reflect the nature of the assignment being considered. However, the following general guidelines will give you some indication of what is expected.\n\n*IN is given when students have not completed all class assignments due to illness, bereavement or extenuating circumstances as defined in Bylaw 51.1.18 and the student will complete the work at a later date (See also Aegrotat Standing). An “Incomplete” is also given when a student is alleged to have committed an act of academic misconduct. The grade of “Incomplete” will remain on the student’s transcript until the matter is adjudicated.\n\n**NR is given when a student did not attend class regularly and has completed none of the evaluative procedures for the course. It will be calculated as 22% in the student’s average.\n\n***IP is given in senior classes when a major assignment or thesis is still in process when the grades are due.\n\nGrade Appeals: (See Senate Bylaws 51: 1.17.1 and 1.17.2)\n\nInformal and formal Appeal: An informal inquiry may be made to the instructor up to the official marks being submitted to the Registrar. The purpose of the inquiry is to review the work submitted and to allow for any adjustment of the grade in question where that change is found to be appropriate by the instructor. This informal inquiry must be done no later than ten working days after the release or publication of the grade by the instructor. This review does not preclude the student from appealing the final grade.\n\nNOTE: Where the purpose of reviewing work for which a grade has been assigned is not to request a grade change, course work may be reviewed by students up to six months after the close of the term in which the course was taught, upon reasonable notice to the instructor.\n\nFormal appeals may be made through the Office of the Registrar for a fee of $20. The Dean of the Faculty will inform the Registrar of the outcome of the appeal. If the appeal is successful, the $20 will be refunded. All appeals must be made in writing to the Associate Dean’s Office, no later than three (3) weeks after the final mark has been released by the Registrar.\n\nStanding Required for Continuation\n\nCoursework\n\nTeacher Candidates who obtain three or more final grades below 60% in any course in the program, or one or more final grades of 0-49.9% in any course in the program, over the duration of the program, will have failed the Bachelor of Education (B. Ed) Degree and will not be eligible for recommendation to the Ontario College of Teachers for certification. In all such cases, upon a cumulative academic record as defined above, Teacher Candidates will be required to meet with the Associate Dean Pre-Service immediately to review their academic standing, which may lead to the requirement to withdraw from the program. Teacher Candidates may be provided with an opportunity to return to the Faculty of Education to fulfill outstanding requirements for the completion of the B. Ed Degree. Conditions of reinstatement are the sole prerogative of the Dean or her/his designate.\n\nNB: Academic standing requirements for the practicum are found in the Field Experience Handbook.\n\nStanding Required for Graduation\n\nTo complete the Bachelor of Education (B. Ed) Degree and be recommended to the Ontario College of Teachers for certification, teacher candidates must meet the expectations in all areas of the pre-service education program. This means that candidates must successfully complete their course work, field experience (Each teacher candidate must receive a pass in EDUC-5499 as a prerequisite for both the B. Ed degree and recommendation for certification to the Ontario College of Teachers), professional learning series activities and the Professional Growth Portfolio.\n\nTeacher Certification\n\nThe Faculty of Education provides programs and courses in teacher education but does not issue a teaching certificate. The responsibility for teacher certification lies with the Ontario College of Teachers. Upon successful completion of the requirements for teacher certification in Ontario, a recommendation will be made by the Dean of the Faculty to the Ontario College of Teachers indicating eligibility for the Ontario Certificate of Qualification. Candidates who successfully complete either the Consecutive or the Concurrent Programs of Study including Practice Teaching will be awarded the B. Ed degree of the University of Windsor and will be recommended to the Ontario College of Teachers indicating eligibility for an Ontario Certificate of Qualification.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nForms\n\nAll documents are to be submitted via the online platform: Sonia.\n\nB.Ed.
