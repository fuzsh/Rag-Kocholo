        "text": "Like engineers (P.Eng) and accountants (CPA), teachers may use “OCT”\n\nThe Ontario College of Teachers, Ontario’s teaching regulator, is pleased with new legislation that recognizes teacher professionalism by entrenching the professional designation “Ontario Certified Teacher” (OCT) in law.\n\nThe legislation also provides for a new membership status for the public register “Inactive/Non-Practising”, which will replace the statuses of “Retired” and “Suspended for Non-Payment of Fees.” The new term removes the stigma of the word suspended, which is typically associated with disciplinary matters.\n\nAdditionally, the legislation reduces the size of the College’s incoming Council, allowing for greater efficiencies that better support the College’s mandate – to serve and protect the public interest.\n\n“The recognition of teacher professionalism, alongside greater governance efficiencies, adds to what has truly been a transformative year for the College,” said Paul Boniferro, Transition Supervisory Officer, Ontario College of Teachers. “The changes from today will have a positive impact on Ontario’s education system now and for years to come. Additionally, they will contribute to our emergence as a global model for regulatory governance”\n\n“Ontario Certified Teachers are knowledgeable, dedicated and hardworking professionals, and the new legislation recognizes that,” said Dr. Derek Haime, OCT, Registrar and CEO, Ontario College of Teachers. “Additionally, a stronger, more effective governance structure continues to strengthen our ability to fulfill our mandate: supporting student safety and well-being.”\n\nLike engineers (P.Eng) and accountants (CPA), teachers are highly educated and trained professionals. Putting the OCT professional designation into the College’s Act confirms that only those who meet the high standards of the profession and maintain their license in good standing can use the OCT designation and teach in the Ontario public school system.\n\nMembers who are currently listed as “retired” or “suspended for non-payment of fees” on the public register will see their membership status updated to include the new “OCT – Inactive/Non-practising” designation alongside the “Inactive/Non-Practising” status on January 3, 2022.\n\nThe legislation, Bill 13, the Supporting People and Businesses Act received Royal Assent on December 2, 2021 and its amendments to the College’s Act are effective as of this date.\n\nThe Ontario College of Teachers licenses, governs, and regulates the profession of teaching in the public interest. It sets standards of practice and ethical standards, conducts disciplinary hearings, and accredits teacher education programs affecting more than 232,000 members in publicly funded schools and institutions across Ontario. The College is Canada’s largest self-regulatory body."
