        "text": "What is the Ontario College of Teachers?\n\nThe Ontario College of Teachers (the College) is responsible for the licensing, governing and regulating of Ontario’s teaching profession. It was established in 1996, with the enactment of the Ontario College of Teachers Act. All Ontario public school teachers and administrators must be certified by and in good standing with the College to be employed as a public school teacher. Certification allows members to use the designation OCT (Ontario Certified Teacher).\n\nAs of 2022, Ontario remains the only province in Canada that entirely self-regulates their teaching profession. In other Canadian provinces and territories, the powers to certify, discipline, and govern members of the teaching profession are divided among provincial departments of education and teachers’ associations.\n\nThe College is comprised of a governing Council of six Ontario Certified Teachers and six members of the public.\n\nAccording to the College, it exists to:\n\nissue, suspend and revoke teaching certificates\n\nset ethical standards and standards of practice\n\ninvestigate and hear concerns and complaints about members\n\naccredit teacher education programs and courses\n\nHow can a teacher become certified with the College?\n\nThe College lists the following requirements that a teacher must meet in order to be certified:\n\ncomplete a minimum three-year postsecondary degree from an acceptable postsecondary institution\n\nsuccessfully complete a four semester teacher education program\n\napply to the College for certification and pay the annual membership and registration fees\n\nsuccessfully complete the sexual abuse prevention program\n\nWhat benefits does the College provide for members?\n\nMembers of the College receive access to several ongoing professional development programs and Additional Qualification (AQ) courses. In 2021, the College introduced the Professional Advisory on Anti-Black Racism, and the Indigenous Ways of Knowing in Teacher Education Webinar Series as two new professional development programs available to members. Members of the College can also access the Margaret Wilson Library, a professional collection of education and teaching resources and databases. The College also provides members with access to various discount programs.\n\nHow does the College deal with complaints against members?\n\nThe College has a duty to protect the public interest. This includes investigating complaints made against its members and disciplining members accordingly. To maintain openness and transparency, disciplinary decisions are available to the public.\n\nIf a complaint is made about a College member and the College decides to investigate, the case is referred to the Discipline Committee, a three-member panel of members of the public and the profession who will hear and decide the case. All disciplinary hearings are usually open to the public. If a member of the College is found guilty of professional misconduct or to be incompetent, discipline can range from fines and counselling, to a teaching certificate being suspended or revoked.\n\nHow to file a complaint\n\nTo make a complaint, call the College Investigations and Professional Conduct Department at 437-880-3000. If the issue is not resolved, information regarding a concern can be filed with Intake staff.\n\nView the College of Teachers Complaints and Discipline Process for more information, or refer to 1407 How to complain about staff misconduct or suspected abuse of students.\n\nCan a teacher certified in one province or territory teach in another?\n\nUnder the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), a teacher certified to teach in one Canadian province or territory will not need to complete any additional training to qualify to teach in another Canadian province or territory. However, an out-of-province teacher must still apply for a teaching certificate from the province in which they want to work. For example, a teacher certified by the Ontario College of Teachers who wishes to teach in British Columbia must apply for a British Columbia teaching certificate.\n\nWhat other organizations exist for teachers?\n\nIn addition to the Ontario College of Teachers, there are several other organizations that Ontario teachers can refer to:\n\nElementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (ETFO)\n\nOntario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF)\n\nOntario Teachers’ Federation (OTF)\n\nOntario English Catholic Teachers Association (OECTA)\n\nCanadian Teachers’ Federation (CTF)\n\nCanadian Association for Teacher Education (CATE)\n\nCanadian Society for the Study of Education (CSSE)\n\nCanadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE)\n\nMore info\n\nFor more information on the Ontario College of Teachers, including details on becoming a member and teacher certification, visit their website at oct.ca.\n\nYou now have 3 options:"
