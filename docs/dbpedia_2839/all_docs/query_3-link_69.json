        "text": "From a very young age I knew I wanted to be a teacher. Not because I enjoy organizing everything and everyone at all times. Okay partially because of that *sideways glance at my smirking husband* but mostly because of my grade three teacher. Mrs. MacDonald was kind and creative and funny. She loved children and she made learning so much fun. She made everything fun. I wanted to be just like her.\n\nSo after university and a bit of globe trotting, I went to teacher’s college to become a real teacher—with a real classroom, brimming with real children.\n\nAfter ten terrific years in the classroom, I left my position as an elementary school teacher to stay home with our second child. She was born with special needs and one of her most special needs is well, me. I miss my classroom, but I don’t miss teaching. I teach every day, but now my class of 24 has become a class of two. My children are subjected to “Mrs. T’s Teachable Moments” on the daily. Sorry kids. It’s what I do.\n\nWhen my son entered grade two (four years ago), it felt strange. This was MY grade—the grade I taught for years. What if his teacher was neither funny nor kind? I admit to panicking a little and I may have used the Ontario College of Teacher’s “Find a Teacher” tool to look her up. Parents can totally do that.\n\nTo learn about the people who teach your children, go to oct.ca/findateacher. This is the College’s public register that lists everyone who has been certified to teach in Ontario’s publicly funded schools.\n\nThese public records include:\n\nteacher’s qualifications\n\ndate of initial certification\n\nstatus with the College\n\nand any disciplinary history (if applicable)\n\nI looked up a friend and former colleague as an example above. Once you find who you’re looking for, click on their name to learn more about their qualifications.\n\nFind out how teachers actually become certified HERE.\n\nTurns out my son’s new teacher was indeed in good standing and she was/is in fact, a great teacher.\n\nThe Ontario College of Teachers was created to support both teachers and parents. Ontario takes education seriously, and as a former teacher and involved parent, I am grateful.\n\nParents are encouraged to sign up for The Standard—A Free Electronic Newsletter For Parents to receive updates about College services that help us learn more about teacher qualifications, see reports on trends in education, and stay in the loop about changes in education legislation.\n\nTo find out more about the free resources the Ontario College of Teachers offers parents visit http://www.oct.ca/network/parents.\n\nWhile you’re there, take a look at the digital version of Professionally Speaking magazine. It’s published for Ontario’s teachers, but there are helpful tips and important insights for parents there too.\n\n“Learning doesn’t stop at the classroom door. Our kids succeed when parents and teachers work together.”\n\nOh how I wish Mrs. MacDonald knew how she inspired a little girl to grow up to be a teacher, just like her."
