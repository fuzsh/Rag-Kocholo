        "text": "According to Finance Minister of Alberta, Travis Toes, new collective bargaining negotiations 2020 is continuing Alberta's fiscal restraint and discipline, increasing wages of teachers is now a dream than reality, there is no increase of teachers wages. According to the minister, it is for the long term betterment of Albertans for its financial crisis, it is for better sustainable and better life quality in the long run for Albertans. The teachers union is not happy on that critical and typical reason that why wages is not increasing, so they challenge the court on their delaying purposes and thus favouring government. The president of Alberta Teachers Association is not happy by saying that bill c9 is not respecting the negotiated agreement between ATA and the government, government is passing initiatives by legislature to break the agreement between that had been done in the past for the increasing of teacher's salary, and thus disrespect collective bargaining. The salary was increased in 2012 but after that there is no improvement of salary for teachers. Teachers have done their part to promote Alberta's economy during re-session, but there is no re-session now and by telling poor economy is not reasonable at this moment. Arbitrator Davis Jones wrote that no change of wage rates is justified in the third year of collective agreement and by thus arbitration hearing favours government. From ATA to labour relations board of Alberta are not really happy because of typical reason, and according to them Finance Minister should be honest by saying truth, because whatever the reason has been declared, is not really a reason for the obstacle of wages increasing.\n\nTeacher federations are often criticized as “roadblocks” to educational change. It is arguable, however, that their advocacy work has been paramount in securing safer return to school conditions across Canadian Educational jurisdictions. Utilizing Carter et al. (2010) framework of union responses to changing policy environments, this paper draws on publicly available documents and social media posts from March through to October of 2020 to examine the ways in which teacher unions in various Canadian contexts have responded to the issue of school reopening plans amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the paper analyzes the extent to which Canadian teacher unions have been able to move into the realm of union renewal as a means of building internal capacity and developing external networks to strengthen their public advocacy work.\n\nIn April 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic forced all of Canada’s schools to begin emergency remote teaching for their K-12 learners. Over the past two and a half years the Canadian eLearning Network (CANeLearn) has documented the impact of the pandemic on K-12 schooling. For each of the past two school years (i.e., 2020-21 and 2021-22), most schools were forced to implement some combination of face-to-face, hybrid, and/or online instruction for students as the threat of COVID-19 continued and schools faced decisions about how to continue teaching and learning while keeping their teachers, staff, and students safe. The uncertainty of most educators in how to effectively shift instruction to be at a distance from the student(s) demonstrated clearly that schools were not ‘pivoting’ to online learning, most simply broadcast typical classroom instruction through an online medium. This report, the final in the “Pandemic Pedagogy Series,” provides a national overview of each phase of the K-12 educational response to the pandemic from the initial and immediate school closures in Spring 2020 through the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years along with a summary of the pandemic pedagogical response for each province, territory, and the federal jurisdiction. It argues that we should not simply return to our teaching and learning practices prior to the virus, forgetting about remote teaching, as teaching and learning landscapes are not dichotomous, in-person learning or online learning. Rather, teaching and learning today requires the flexibility to navigate multiple learning landscapes simultaneously, yet few, if any, jurisdictions have taken the steps necessary to ensure that teachers and schools can toggle between in-person learning and remote learning with no loss of instructional quantity or quality. This summary report argues that more planning and deliberate attention must be provided to teacher preparation, infrastructure, education policy, and resources to be able to maintain quality instructional continuity. The “Pandemic Pedagogy Series” reports by CANeLearn offer recommendations for how schools can be better prepared for future crises that incorporate both home-based and school-based learning opportunities mediated through online learning environments and there is a strong need to pursue this line of inquiry through continuing research beyond the confines of the seven reports in the series. A website was created to host the report series, along with an archive of online workshop presentations based on each report available at https://sites.google.com/view/canelearn-ert/"
