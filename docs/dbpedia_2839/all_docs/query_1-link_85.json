        "text": "In 2020, the Government of Ontario mandated that all Ontario Certified Teachers and applicants for certification by the Ontario College of Teachers (the College) successfully complete a sexual abuse prevention program. Together with the College, C3P developed a tailored Ontario module to complement C3P’s well-established Commit to Kids Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program and online training (Commit to Kids).\n\nWhat is Commit to Kids?\n\nCommit to Kids is for individuals who are involved in child-serving organizations, such as members of the College. The goal of the training is to empower staff with practical information to help enhance child and youth safety. It highlights the importance of understanding boundaries, sexual misconduct, and reporting inappropriate behaviour.\n\nWhy is this kind of training important?\n\nAccording to research, one in 10 Canadians reported being sexually victimized before they turned 18. In the majority of child sexual abuse cases, the offender was known to the child.\n\nChild-serving organizations need to better understand the issue of sexual abuse beyond common duty to report training and criminal record checks. Building individuals’ awareness of child sexual abuse and how they can help mitigate this risk is the first step in protecting children in their care.\n\nHow long does Commit to Kids take to complete?\n\nThe online training takes about 2.5 hours to complete and is broken down into eight modules (module 7 is optional). It can be completed over several sittings, rather than all at once, if that is a preferred option for the learner.\n\nIs there certification as part of this program?\n\nYes. In order for Ontario Certified Teachers to receive a certificate of completion, individuals must pass the final Knowledge Validation Test with a score of 80% or above.\n\nCan I repeat the test if I don’t pass the first time?\n\nYes, you can repeat the test until you achieve 80%. However, if you continue to have difficulty, consider revisiting the modules before taking the test again.\n\nWill I find the training difficult because it deals with a sensitive topic?\n\nWe understand that the prevalence of child sexual abuse means the topic may resonate with many people on a personal level. To help you manage the sensitive content, consider the best way for you to complete the training. The training:\n\nCan be taken over multiple short sessions, rather than all at once\n\nCan be completed alone, with a group, or with another who you are comfortable with\n\nCan be completed without listening to the survivor testimonials (these make up only parts of some of the videos and those can be scrolled through). Even without these segments, a learner will be able to fully complete the Knowledge Validation Test\n\nTo help frame up the training for your work with children, we encourage you to contextualize each module through a professional lens. As you move through the training consider what the information means in relation to your work and how you can incorporate it into everyday interactions with children to protect them.\n\nWhat other organizations use Commit to Kids?\n\nMany other organizations across Canada are using the Commit to Kids tools, online training, and resources as part of their employee and volunteer training. These organizations include numerous:\n\nSchool boards, districts, and divisions and governing bodies\n\nNational, provincial, and local sport organizations\n\nMunicipalities across their recreation, aquatics, and libraries divisions\n\nPost-secondary students from various child-serving faculties across Canada\n\nChildren’s aid societies, child and family services divisions, youth centres\n\nDaycares\n\nChildren’s camps\n\nOntario Specific FAQs\n\nWho must complete the Ontario Commit to Kids program and when is the deadline?\n\nAll individuals who are members of the College, including those who are retired, as of January 3, 2022 are required to complete the program by September 15, 2022.\n\nAll applicants and re-applicants, including internationally educated teachers (IETs), who complete their application before January 1, 2022 and are certified by the College are required to successfully complete the program by September 15, 2022.\n\nFor more information on who needs to take the program, how to access it, how to access your certificate of completion, and other technical information, visit the Ontario College of Teacher’s FAQ page.\n\nHow do I access the program?\n\nThe program will be available as of January 3, 2022. Starting on that date, you can complete the program by logging in to the College’s Member's Area and clicking the link in the banner at the top of the page.\n\nIs there a cost?\n\nThe program will be offered to College members and applicants at no cost.\n\nI have already taken the Commit to Kids program. Do I have to take it again?\n\nYes. This version of the Commit to Kids program includes additional content from the College to contextualize the material, as well as links to existing resources and professional advisories.\n\nIf I have questions how do I contact the Ontario College of Teachers?"
