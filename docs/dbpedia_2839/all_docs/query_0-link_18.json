Achieving one’s education potential affects a person’s ability to take part in the labour market, live independently, participate meaningfully in society, and realize their full potential.\n\nThe Ontario Human Rights Code (Code) recognizes the importance of creating a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person, so that each person can contribute fully to the development and well-being of the community and the Province. The Code guarantees the right to equal treatment in education, without discrimination on the ground of disability, as part of the protection for equal treatment in services. This protection applies to elementary and secondary schools, and colleges and universities, both public and private.\n\nThe Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) has recognized for some time that, despite a highly regulated and complex education framework designed to address the “special needs” of students, students with disabilities continue to face obstacles in their attempts to access educational services in Ontario. “Disability” continues to be the most often cited ground of discrimination under the Code in human rights claims made to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO), with significant systemic issues being raised in disability and education claims. Statistics Canada reports that Ontarians with disabilities continue to have lower educational achievement levels, a higher unemployment rate, and are more likely to have low income than people without disabilities.\n\nWhile there have been some significant gains for people with disabilities in recent years, it is clear that students with disabilities continue to experience difficulties accessing services at all levels of Ontario’s education system. Ongoing barriers include:\n\nineffective communication to parents and students about their right to accommodation, and their right to be free from discrimination and harassment in education\n\ninadequate training for education providers on disability-related issues, and the duty to accommodate students with disabilities\n\ninsufficient resources and supports in the classroom\n\nlong waiting lists for assessments\n\nnegative attitudes and stereotypes\n\nphysical inaccessibility\n\ninappropriate requests for medical information\n\nineffective dispute resolution processes\n\noutright denial of disability-related accommodations.\n\nA student’s experience may be further complicated when discrimination based on disability intersects with discrimination based on other grounds under the Code, such as race, sex, sexual orientation, age or another type of disability, etc. People with disabilities are also more likely to have low incomes than people without disabilities, and many people live in chronic poverty. A student’s experience with low income may be highly relevant to understanding the impact of discrimination on a student with a disability, and this may result in specific experiences of discrimination.\n\nStudents with disabilities are a diverse group, and experience disability, impairment and societal barriers in many different ways. Disabilities are often “invisible” and episodic, with people sometimes experiencing periods of wellness and periods of disability. All students with disabilities have the same rights to equal opportunities under the Code, whether their disabilities are visible or not.\n\nThe OHRC is an independent statutory body whose mission is to promote, protect and advance human rights across the province as set out in the Code. To do this, the OHRC identifies and monitors systemic human rights trends, develops policies, provides public education, does research, conducts public interest inquiries, and uses its legal powers to pursue human rights remedies that are in the public interest.\n\nThe OHRC’s policies reflect its interpretation of the Code, and set out standards, guidelines and best practice examples for how individuals, service providers, housing providers, employers and others should act to ensure equality for all Ontarians. The OHRC’s Policy on accessible education for students with disabilities provides practical guidance on the legal rights and responsibilities set out in the Code as they relate to the ground of disability in the context of education. In particular, the policy addresses:\n\nthe evolving legal definition of disability, and its implications for education providers\n\nthe impact of ableism on the delivery of education and on the experiences of students with disabilities\n\nrecognition of the central importance of inclusive design in the education context\n\nan emphasis on accommodations that promote integration and full participation\n\nrecognition that students with disabilities are individuals first, and should be considered, assessed and accommodated on an individual basis\n\nacknowledgement of the unique ways in which students who identify by the ground of disability, along with one or more additional Code grounds (e.g. race, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, etc.) may experience discrimination (i.e. the concept of “intersectionality”)\n\nthe duty of education providers, in certain circumstances, to inquire into whether a student has needs related to a disability, and to offer assistance and accommodation, even if the student has not made a specific accommodation request\n\nthe type of medical/healthcare information that can be requested by education providers and should be provided by students to support an accommodation request\n\nthe principle that accommodation is a responsibility shared by all parties to the process\n\na reaffirmation of the high standard of undue hardship.\n\nEducational institutions operating in Ontario have a legal duty to take steps to prevent and respond to breaches of the Code. This responsibility includes maintaining accessible, inclusive, discrimination and harassment-free education environments that respect human rights. It is not acceptable to choose to stay unaware of discrimination or harassment of a student with a disability, whether or not a human rights claim has been made.\n\nThe OHRC’s Policy on accessible education for students with disabilities will help education providers recognize and fulfil their obligations under the Code, design their facilities, policies and procedures more inclusively, respond appropriately and in a timely way to accommodation requests, and effectively address complaints related to disability before they escalate to human rights claims made to the HRTO.\n\nThe OHRC’s Recommendations to key education players to improve educational outcomes for students with disabilities are set out Appendix A. Students with disabilities deserve to feel that they are valued and that they belong. Ontario’s success and prosperity as a province depends upon its ability to ensure that all students are given the opportunity to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to their communities. Ontario’s educational institutions play a crucial role in achieving this objective.\n\nBack to Top\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEducation is vitally important to a person’s personal, social and academic development. Achieving one’s education potential affects a person’s ability to take part in the labour market, realize their full potential, live independently, and participate meaningfully in society. A positive experience in elementary and secondary school increases a person’s chances of going on to post-secondary education. Having post-secondary education is becoming increasingly important to a person’s ability to attain a decent standard of living. Employment and Social Development Canada projects that two-thirds of job openings from 2011-2020 will be in occupations that generally require post-secondary education.[1]\n\nSchool is the place where most children have their first interaction with a government institution or system. What students learn and experience in school will shape their perceptions – and expectations – of all other government systems. If students get the right start, they will learn to respect and support one another. They will feel included and see other government systems as supports, not barriers. Getting the wrong start in education can predispose children to think government systems and social services do not serve their interests, or even that they are designed specifically to entrench power and privilege, and maintain the status quo. This can lead to broader mistrust, suspicion, and exclusion from society.\n\nThe Ontario Human Rights Code[2] (Code) recognizes the importance of creating a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person, so that each person can contribute fully to the development and well-being of the community and the Province. The Code guarantees the right to equal treatment in education, without discrimination on the ground of disability, as part of the protection for equal treatment in services. This protection applies to elementary and secondary schools, and colleges and universities, both public and private.\n\nThe Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) has recognized for some time that, despite a highly regulated and complex education framework designed to address the “special needs” of students, a significant number of students with disabilities continue to face obstacles in their attempts to access educational services in Ontario. In 2003, the OHRC published The opportunity to succeed: Achieving barrier-free education for students with disabilities. The OHRC followed up this report in 2004 with the Guidelines on accessible education (Guidelines), a comprehensive policy document providing guidance to education providers[3] and students with disabilities on how to fulfil their duties and rights under the Code.\n\nSince the release of the Guidelines, the OHRC has continued to use its mandate to address human rights issues facing students with disabilities. In 2005, the OHRC filed human rights claims against the Toronto District School Board and the Ministry of Education related to concerns that the “zero tolerance” approach of the Education Act was having a disproportionate effect on students with disabilities and racialized students. The OHRC negotiated settlements in both claims, which resulted in amendments to the Education Act that require principals and school boards to consider mitigating factors before suspending or expelling students. The Ministry also mandated the creation of alternative education programs for suspensions of longer than five days, and introduced new Policy and Program Memoranda on progressive discipline.\n\nIn 2012, the OHRC intervened in Moore,[4] a landmark Supreme Court of Canada case that dealt with the denial of meaningful access to education by a student with dyslexia. In 2015, we intervened in a human rights claim filed against York University that raised issues related to the type of medical documentation that needs to be provided to support a request for accommodation of a mental health disability. We worked with the university and the student who filed the discrimination claim to develop new documentation guidelines to access academic accommodations.[5] And, in 2017, we published With learning in mind,[6] an inquiry report on systemic barriers to academic accommodation for post-secondary students with mental health disabilities. We continue to engage in public education, communication, training, and promoting human rights throughout the education sector.\n\nWhile there have been some significant gains[7] for people with disabilities in recent years, serious barriers to equality continue to exist throughout society, including in Ontario’s education system.[8] “Disability” continues to be the most often cited ground of discrimination under the Code in human rights claims made to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO),[9] with significant systemic issues being raised in disability and education claims. Statistics Canada reports that Ontarians with disabilities continue to have lower educational achievement levels, a higher unemployment rate, and are more likely to have low income than people without disabilities.[10]\n\nIt is clear that students with disabilities continue to experience difficulties accessing services at all levels of the education system. Inadequate resources and supports in the classroom, long waiting lists for assessments, negative attitudes and stereotypes, physical inaccessibility, inappropriate requests for medical information, ineffective dispute resolution processes, and outright denial of disability-related accommodations are some of the barriers that many students with disabilities continue to experience in their attempts to get an education.\n\nThe Policy on accessible education for students with disabilities, 2018 updates the 2004 Guidelines on accessible education to take into account current social science research, case law developments, legislation and international human rights obligations.[11] The OHRC has maintained its policy positions in key areas, including:\n\na definition of disability that recognizes the impact of “social handicapping”\n\nan emphasis on accommodations that promote integration and full participation\n\nrecognition of the central importance of inclusive design in the education context\n\nrecognition that students with disabilities are individuals first, and should be considered, assessed and accommodated on an individual basis\n\nacknowledgement of the unique ways in which students who identify by the ground of disability, along with one or more additional Code grounds (e.g. race, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, etc.) may experience discrimination (i.e. the concept of “intersectionality”)\n\nthe principle that accommodation is a responsibility shared by all parties to the process\n\na reaffirmation of the high standard of undue hardship.\n\nThis policy also addresses new and emerging issues in the area of disability and education, including:\n\nthe impact of ableism on the delivery of education and on the experiences of students with disabilities\n\nthe evolving legal definition of disability, and its implications for education providers\n\nthe duty of education providers, in certain circumstances, to inquire into whether a student has needs related to a disability, and to offer assistance and accommodation, even if the student has not made a specific accommodation request\n\nthe type of medical/healthcare information that can be requested by education providers and should be provided by students to support an accommodation request.\n\nIt is the OHRC’s intention that the Policy on accessible education for students with disabilities, 2018 will help education providers recognize and fulfil their obligations under the Code, design their facilities, policies and procedures more inclusively, respond appropriately and in a timely way to accommodation requests, and effectively address complaints related to disability. The policy can also help students and their families understand their rights and responsibilities under the Code, clarify what it means to take part appropriately in the accommodation process, and know where to find further resources.\n\nBack to Top\n\n2.Legal framework\n\nEducation is a complex field, governed by many statutes and regulations, regulated by several government ministries, and involving many players. The OHRC’s mandate is with respect to the human rights aspects of educational services, and what can properly be considered “discrimination” within the meaning of human rights law and policy. Not all aspects of education, or even of special education, fall within this mandate.\n\n2.1 Ontario Human Rights Code\n\n2.1.1 Protections\n\nUnder section 1 of the Code, people with disabilities are protected from discrimination in “services.” This protection includes education services.[12]\n\nSection 9 of the Code prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination. Section 11 states that discrimination includes constructive or adverse effect discrimination, where a requirement, policy, standard, qualification, rule or factor that appears neutral excludes or disadvantages a group protected under the Code.[13]\n\nStudents with disabilities are also covered by the Code under section 8 if they experience reprisal or are threatened with reprisal for trying to exercise their human rights.[14]\n\nPeople are also protected from discrimination based on their association with someone with a disability (Section 12). This could apply to friends, family or others – for example, someone advocating on behalf of a student with a disability.[15]\n\nBack to Top\n\n2.1.2 Defences and exceptions\n\nThe Code includes specific defences and exceptions that allow behaviour that would otherwise be discriminatory. An education provider that wishes to rely on these defences and exceptions must show it meets all of the requirements of the relevant section.\n\nWhere discrimination results from requirements, qualifications or factors that may appear neutral, but that have an adverse effect on students with disabilities, section 11 allows the education provider to show that the requirement, qualification or factor is reasonable and bona fide.[16] They must also show that the needs of the student affected cannot be accommodated without undue hardship.[17]\n\nSection 14 of the Code protects “special programs” that are designed to address the historical disadvantage experienced by people identified by the Code. As a result, it is likely not discriminatory to implement programs designed specifically to assist students with disabilities, as long as an organization can show that the program is:\n\ndesigned to relieve hardship or economic disadvantage\n\ndesigned to help the disadvantaged group to achieve or try to achieve equal opportunity, or\n\nlikely to help eliminate discrimination.\n\nSection 17 sets out the duty to accommodate people with disabilities. It is not discriminatory to refuse an educational service because the student is incapable\n\nof fulfilling the essential requirements. However, a student will only be considered incapable if their disability-related needs cannot be accommodated without undue hardship.\n\nUnder section 18 of the Code, organizations such as charities, schools, social clubs, sororities or fraternities that want to limit their right of membership and involvement to people with disabilities can do this on the condition that they serve mostly people from this group.[18]\n\nBack to Top\n\n2.2 Education legislation\n\n2.2.1 Primary and secondary education\n\nThe Education Act[19] and its accompanying regulations set out a structure for identifying and accommodating the “special needs” of students in Ontario’s publicly funded primary and secondary school system.\n\nUnder the Education Act, the Ministry of Education is responsible for ensuring that all “exceptional” children in Ontario have available to them appropriate special education programs and services, without payment of fees. The Ministry has required school boards to implement procedures for identifying the special needs of students, and for setting standards for identification procedures.\n\nSection 1 of the Act defines an “exceptional pupil” as one “whose behavioural, communicational, intellectual, physical or multiple exceptionalities are such that he or she is considered to need placement in a special education program.”\n\nThe principal of a school may, by his or her own decision, or at the request of a parent, refer a child to an Identification and Placement Review Committee (IPRC) for a decision on whether the child is “exceptional,” and if so, whether the child should be placed in a regular classroom with supports, or in a special education class.[20] In making these decisions, the IPRC shall consider educational, health and psychological assessments, as well as information submitted by the parents. The IPRC can also interview the student. Where placement in a regular classroom would meet the child’s needs and is consistent with parental preferences, the IPRC must place the child in the regular classroom.\n\nThe IPRC also has the power to make recommendations about special education programs and services for the student, but does not have decision-making power in this respect. Parents may appeal the decision of an IPRC regarding a determination of exceptionality, or the placement of a student to the Special Education Appeal Board. Recommendations on programs and services cannot be appealed.\n\nIf the decision of the IPRC is not appealed, the principal of the school the student will attend is notified to prepare an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for the student.[21] IEPs include the specific educational expectations for the student, an outline of the special education programs and services to be provided to the student, and a statement of the methods for reviewing the student’s progress. For students aged 14 and over, the IEP must also contain a plan for transition to appropriate post-secondary school activities. In developing the plan, the principal must consult with the student’s parent (or with the student, if they are aged 16 or older), and must consider any recommendations made through the IPRC process.[22]\n\nIt is important to note that, while the Ministry of Education has devised its own framework for identifying “exceptional pupils,” it is the Ontario Human Rights Code and human rights case law that establishes that education providers have a legal duty to accommodate the disability-related needs of students to the point of undue hardship. This legal duty exists whether or not a student with a disability falls within the Ministry’s definition of “exceptional pupil,”[23] and whether or not the student has gone through a formal IPRC process, or has an IEP.\n\nExample: The OHRC has heard concerns from parents and advocacy organizations that some Ministry of Education documents fail to specifically name ADHD as an “exceptionality” and that, as a result, some education providers are failing to provide accommodation for this condition.[24] The definition of disability in the Code, and as interpreted in human rights case law, is broader than the Ministry of Education exceptionality categories. For example, human rights jurisprudence has explicitly recognized ADHD as a disability requiring accommodation under the Code.[25]\n\nIt is important to note that the Code has primacy over other legislation, including the Education Act. [26] This means that where there is an inconsistency between the Code and the Education Act, the Code will prevail.[27] And, in one case, the HRTO found that the Ministry of Education could be potentially liable for discrimination where its definition of exceptionalities prevented or delayed a student from receiving required accommodations.[28]\n\nBack to Top\n\n2.2.2 Post-secondary education\n\nPost-secondary education in Ontario is provided by a wide range of public and private institutions, including publicly funded universities and colleges, private vocational schools, and privately funded degree-granting institutions. The Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities is responsible for post-secondary education in Ontario.\n\nThe accommodation of students with disabilities at the post-secondary level is not subject to the same detailed legislative structures as at the primary and secondary levels. Accommodation of students with disabilities is governed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter), and by provincial human rights statutes. Post-secondary institutions have developed a wide range of delivery methods and structures to meet these obligations, and colleges and universities have offices for students with disabilities to assist students with the accommodation process.\n\nBack to Top\n\n2.3 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\nThe Charter guarantees people’s civil, political and equality rights in the policies, practices and legislation of all levels of government. The Charter applies to publicly-funded schools, colleges and universities. While human rights legislation in Canada is considered quasi-constitutional, it is subject to and must be considered in light of the Charter.[29]\n\nSection 15 guarantees the right to equal protection under the law and equal benefit of the law, without discrimination based on disability, among other grounds. The equality rights guarantee in section 15 of the Charter is similar to the purpose of the Code.[30] Governments must not infringe Charter rights unless violations can be justified under section 1, which considers whether the Charter violation is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nBack to Top\n\n2.4 Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act\n\nEducation providers also have obligations under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA), and its Integrated Accessibility Standard Regulations.[31] The AODA aims to address the right to equal opportunity and inclusion for people with disabilities throughout society. The AODA's goal is to make Ontario fully accessible by 2025. It introduces a series of standards (customer service, transportation, built environment, employment, and information and communications)[32] that public and private organizations must implement within certain timelines.\n\nThe AODA is an important piece of legislation for improving accessibility in the lives of people with disabilities. It complements the Ontario Human Rights Code, which has primacy over the AODA. The development and implementation of standards under the AODA must have regard for the Code, related human rights principles, and case law.[33] Compliance with the AODA does not necessarily mean compliance with the Code. Education providers must follow both. For example, even where an education provider meets all of its obligations under the AODA, it will still be responsible for making sure that discrimination and harassment based on disability do not take place in its operations, that it responds to individual accommodation requests, etc.\n\nBack to Top\n\n2.5 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n\nThe United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is an international treaty designed to “promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.”[34] Canada ratified the CRPD in 2010. Under Article 24, the CRPD specifically recognizes the right of people with disabilities to education without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity.\n\nInternational treaties and conventions are not part of Canadian law unless they have been implemented through legislation.[35] However, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated that international law helps give meaning and context to Canadian law. The Court said that domestic law (which includes the Code and the Charter) should be interpreted in a manner consistent with Canada’s international commitments.[36]\n\nThe CRPD is an important human rights tool that puts positive obligations on Canada to make sure that people with disabilities have equal opportunity in all areas of life, including education. To meet the obligations under the CRPD, Canada and Ontario should make sure that adequate and appropriate community supports and accommodations are in place to allow for equal opportunities for students with disabilities, and should evaluate legislation, standards, programs and practices to make sure rights are respected.[37]\n\nBack to Top\n\n3. Scope of application\n\n3.1 Education is a “service” under the Code\n\nSection 1 of the Code guarantees the right to equal treatment in services, without discrimination on the ground of disability. Education, in its broadest sense, is a “service” within the meaning of the Code.[38] The scope of “educational services” will include the mastery of knowledge, academic standards, evaluation and accreditation. It may also encompass the development of a student’s personality, talents, and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential, and may include co-instructional activities such as school-related sports, arts and cultural activities, and school functions and field trips. At the lower grade levels, the service of education will typically be defined more broadly and may include the student’s overall social, physical and academic development in the education setting. At the higher levels of education, formal education services will be defined more narrowly and will focus increasingly on academic standards and accreditation.\n\nBack to Top\n\n3.2 Applies to public and private education institutions\n\nThe right to equal treatment and the duty to accommodate exist for publicly funded and privately funded[39] early childhood pre-schools (i.e. daycares), elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities. This includes special schools such as hospital schools, care and treatment programs, schools in correctional facilities, and provincial schools.[40] It would also include separate schools, French-language schools, trade, business and professional accreditation courses, and, depending on the context, may also include experiential learning placements (i.e. “co-ops,” practicums, fieldwork).[41]\n\nBack to Top\n\n4. What is disability?\n\nThe term “disability” [42] covers a broad range and degree of conditions. A disability may have been present at birth, caused by an accident, or developed over time. Section 10 of the Code defines “disability” as:\n\nany degree of physical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement that is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, a brain injury, any degree of paralysis, amputation, lack of physical co-ordination, blindness or visual impediment, deafness or hearing impediment, muteness or speech impediment, or physical reliance on a guide dog or other animal or on a wheelchair or other remedial appliance or device,\n\na condition of mental impairment or a developmental disability,\n\na learning disability, or a dysfunction in one or more of the processes involved in understanding or using symbols or spoken language,\n\na mental disorder, or\n\nan injury or disability for which benefits were claimed or received under the insurance plan established under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997.\n\n“Disability” includes both present and past conditions, as well as a subjective component, namely, one based on perception of disability.[43] It is the OHRC’s position that anticipated disabilities are also covered by the Code.[44] This would apply where a student does not currently have a disability, but they are treated adversely because of a perception that they will eventually develop a disability, become a burden, pose a risk, and/or require accommodation. The focus should always be on the current abilities of a student and the situation’s current risks rather than on limitations or risks that may or may not arise in the future.[45]\n\nAlthough sections 10(a) to (e) of the Code set out various types of conditions, it is clear that they are merely illustrative and not exhaustive. It is also a principle of human rights law that the Code be given a broad, purposive and contextual interpretation to advance the goal of eliminating discrimination. [46]\n\nA disability may be the result of combinations of impairments and environmental barriers, such as attitudinal barriers, inaccessible information, an inaccessible built environment or other barriers that affect a student’s full participation in the educational context.\n\nThe CRPD recognizes that “disability is an evolving concept and that disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.”[47]\n\nThis approach, often called the “social approach” to disability, or the “social model” of disability,[48] is also reflected in Supreme Court of Canada decisions. In a landmark human rights case, the Court used an equality-based framework of disability that took into account evolving biomedical, social and technological developments, and emphasized human dignity, respect and the right to equality. The Court made it clear that disability must be interpreted to include its subjective component, as discrimination may be based as much on perceptions, myths and stereotypes, as on the existence of actual functional limitations. The Court said:\n\n[A] “handicap” may be the result of a physical limitation, an ailment, a social construct, a perceived limitation, or a combination of all these factors. Indeed, it is the combined effect of all these circumstances that determines whether the individual has a “handicap” for the purposes of the Charter.[49]\n\nThe focus should be on the effects of the distinction, preference or exclusion experienced by the student. In another case,[50] the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that “social handicapping,” that is, society’s response to a real or perceived disability, should be the focus of the discrimination analysis. The social model of disability articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada has been followed in appellate court[51] and HRTO decisions.[52]\n\nDisabilities may be temporary,[53] sporadic or permanent.\n\nExample: In one case, the HRTO stated, “I…disagree with the assertion that in order to constitute a disability, the condition must have an aspect of permanence and persistence.” In that case, the HRTO found that injuries resulting from a slip and fall that took almost three weeks to heal, and a miscarriage, both constituted disabilities within the meaning of the Code.[54]\n\nPeople’s experience of disability may result from bodily or mental impairments, or from limitations arising from impairments that affect people’s ability to function in certain areas of living.[55] However, people may not experience any limitations even when they have a medical diagnosis.[56]\n\nHuman rights decision-makers and education providers should consider how students with disabilities define their own experiences and related needs, as part of understanding the student’s disability for the purposes of the Code.[57] At the same time, when determining if the student has had their rights violated under the Code, a human rights decision-maker may find it reasonable for an education provider to seek out objective information about the student’s disability-related needs. This could include information setting out the student’s needs and limitations from a third party, such as a medical or healthcare professional.[58]\n\nBack to Top\n\n4.1 Ableism, negative attitudes, stereotypes and stigma\n\nAn “ableist” belief system often underlies negative attitudes, stereotypes[59] and stigma[60] toward students with disabilities. “Ableism” refers to attitudes in society that devalue and limit the potential of people with disabilities. According to the Law Commission of Ontario:\n\n[Ableism] may be defined as a belief system, analogous to racism, sexism or ageism, that sees persons with disabilities as being less worthy of respect and consideration, less able to contribute and participate, or of less inherent value than others. Ableism may be conscious or unconscious, and may be embedded in institutions, systems or the broader culture of a society. It can limit the opportunities of persons with disabilities and reduce their inclusion in the life of their communities.[61]\n\nAbleist attitudes are often premised on the view that disability is an “anomaly to normalcy,” rather than an inherent and expected variation in the human condition.[62] A great deal of discrimination faced by students with disabilities is underpinned by social constructs of “normality” which in turn tend to reinforce obstacles to integration rather than encourage ways to ensure full participation.[63]\n\n“Everyone has a different normal. I used to think I was dumb and stupid but now I don’t think that anymore.” – Anonymous, Student[64]\n\nThe belief that disability is an abnormality has been used to rationalize the exclusion, neglect, abuse and exploitation of people with disabilities in various different contexts. It may also inform paternalistic and patronizing behaviour toward students with disabilities.\n\nDiscrimination against people with disabilities is often linked to prejudicial attitudes,[65] negative stereotyping, and the overall stigma surrounding disability. All of these concepts are interrelated. For example, stereotyping, prejudice and stigma can lead to discrimination. The stigma surrounding disability can also be an effect of discrimination, ignorance, stereotyping and prejudice.\n\nIn its own consultations with people with disabilities, the Law Commission of Ontario reported:\n\n…many participants talked about the suspicion and often contempt with which persons with disabilities are treated when seeking services and supports. Services which are designed to assist persons with disabilities in meeting their basic needs or improving their autonomy, independence and participation may in practice be implemented through an adversarial mindset, which assumes that those seeking services are attempting “to game” the system, or obtain benefits to which they are not entitled. This is particularly the case for persons with disabilities who are also poor.[66]\n\nStudents with disabilities may be perceived to be a “burden” on the educational system, teachers, instructors, fellow students, etc. Students with disabilities at the post-secondary level may be stereotyped as “child-like” and unable to make decisions in their own best interests. Where stigma, negative attitudes and stereotyping result in discrimination, they will contravene the Code.\n\nEducation providers have a legal obligation under the Code to not discriminate against students with disabilities, and to eliminate discrimination when it happens. These obligations apply in situations where discrimination is direct and the result of a person’s internal stereotypes or prejudices. They also apply when discrimination is indirect and may exist within and across educational institutions because of laws, policies and unconscious practices.\n\nStigma, negative attitudes and stereotypes can lead to inaccurate assessments of students’ personal characteristics. They may lead educational institutions to develop policies, procedures and decision-making practices that exclude or marginalize students with disabilities. They can also create barriers for students with disabilities, with some students not feeling welcome or included in class activities, or social situations at school.\n\nExample: A university professor asked a Deaf student to sit at the back of the lecture hall, so that his interpreter didn’t distract the other students. The student was also told that he will not have interpreters in the “real world” so why should he get to have one at university.[67]\n\nEducation providers must take steps to make sure that negative attitudes, stereotypes and stigma do not result in discriminatory behaviour toward or treatment of students with disabilities.\n\nExample: A university arranges sensitivity training for all faculty and academic staff on issues facing students with learning disabilities. The training focuses on creating greater awareness of different learning needs and addressing misperceptions and misinformation which in themselves can create barriers to equal access to educational services.\n\nAfter conducting a consultation with students and their families, Ontario’s Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth reported: “Students with learning disabilities told us that no one explained their ‘learning disability’ to them so they never understood that their way of learning was different from their peers. Without this awareness they just felt that something was ‘wrong’ with them or they found themselves isolated from their peers and felt ‘stupid.’ This fear of being ‘different’ became a cause of failure on its own as they struggled with why it took them longer to learn when their peers seem to learn so easily.” [68]\n\nBack to Top\n\n4.2 Accounting for non-evident disabilities\n\nPart of creating a welcoming learning environment involves being sensitive to the many ways a student’s disability might manifest and the unique needs that may arise as a result. Some types of disabilities are not apparent to the average onlooker. This can be because of the nature of the specific disability in question: it may be episodic, its effects may not be visible, or it may not manifest consistently in all environments.\n\nOther disabilities may become apparent based on the nature of the interaction, such as when there is a need for oral communication with a student who has hearing loss or a speech and language disability, or there is a need for written communication with someone who has dyslexia. A disability might reveal itself over time through extended interaction. It might only become known when a disability accommodation is requested, or the disability might remain “non-evident” because the student chooses not to divulge it for personal reasons.\n\nExample: A young woman receives a breast cancer diagnosis in the middle of her spring semester at university. Because she is able to arrange her treatments so that they occur over the summer break, she does not require any academic accommodation and does not disclose her medical condition to anyone at the university.\n\nIn other cases, disclosing a disability may not be necessary because the disability may not have an impact upon a student’s study. This will especially be the case where educational institutions have designed their technology structures, curricula, programs and services inclusively, and adaptation or modification to meet the needs of students with disabilities is therefore unnecessary.[69]\n\nOther examples of non-evident disabilities include mental health disabilities, learning disabilities, chronic fatigue syndrome, environmental sensitivities, diabetes, anaphylaxis and epilepsy.\n\nStudents with non-evident disabilities often face unique challenges in the education system. Because these disabilities are not “seen,” many of them are not well understood in society. This can lead to behaviour based on misinformation and ignorance, and may lead to a student’s disability being mislabeled and misunderstood.\n\nExample: People who are deaf, deafened or hard of hearing are often misperceived as having mental health disabilities, even where this is not the case.[70]\n\nFor some students, requesting an accommodation may be especially difficult if a teacher or professor doubts the authenticity of the request because they cannot “see” it.[71]\n\nSensitivity and informed understanding on the part of educators, school staff, and fellow students can combat stereotypes, stigma and prejudice, all of which can have a discriminatory effect on students with non-evident disabilities.\n\nBack to Top\n\n4.2.1 Mental health disabilities and addictions\n\nMental health disability is a form of non-evident disability that raises unique issues in the educational context.[72] Students with mental health disabilities and addictions may face a high degree of stigmatization and significant barriers. Stigmatization can foster a climate that exacerbates stress, and may trigger or worsen the student’s condition. It may also mean that someone who has a problem and needs help may not seek it, for fear of being treated negatively. Much misinformation continues to exist about mental illness and too often people with mental health disabilities and addictions are labelled and judged according to inaccurate preconceptions and assumptions. Rules, preconditions, policies or practices that treat students with mental health disabilities and addictions differently from other people with disabilities may be discriminatory on their face.[73]\n\nThe distinct and serious issues faced by people with mental health disabilities and addictions prompted the OHRC to hold a province-wide consultation specifically on discrimination based on mental health. In 2012, the OHRC published its findings in a consultation report entitled Minds that matter: Report on the consultation on human rights, mental health and addictions.[74] The OHRC relied on these findings, as well as on developments in the law, international trends and social science research to inform its Policy on preventing discrimination based on mental health disabilities and addictions, which was released in 2014.[75] In 2015, the OHRC published By the numbers: A statistical profile of people with mental health and addiction disabilities in Ontario.[76] And in 2016, the OHRC conducted an inquiry into systemic barriers to post-secondary education for students with mental health disabilities. The findings of this inquiry were published in 2017 in With learning in mind: Inquiry report on systemic barriers to academic accommodation for post-secondary students with mental health disabilities.[77]\n\nEducation providers should educate themselves, school staff and students about non-evident disabilities, so they can provide a welcoming and safe environment for all students with disabilities. Schools should ensure that all students are provided with learning opportunities that foster an awareness and appreciation of diversity issues in the education environment, and combat negative attitudes and stereotypes.\n\nPost-secondary institutions often find themselves on the front line in dealing with young adults who are facing mental health challenges. Research indicates that 75% of mental health disorders first appear in people between the ages of 18 and 24.[78] Colleges and universities across Ontario have reported a dramatic increase in the number of students experiencing mental health issues on campus in recent years.[79]\n\nThe Spring 2016 National College Health Assessment (NCHA), a national online survey that collects information on students’ health behaviours, attitudes and perceptions, indicated that depression, anxiety and suicide attempts are increasing among Ontario’s post-secondary students:\n\n46% of students reported feeling so depressed in the previous year it was difficult to function (increased from 40% in 2013)\n\n65% of students reported experiencing overwhelming anxiety in the previous year (up from 58% in 2013)\n\n14% had seriously considered suicide in the previous year (up from 11% in 2013)\n\n2.2% of students reported a suicide attempt within the previous year (up from 1.5% in 2013)\n\n9% indicated that they had attempted suicide, but not in the previous year.[80]\n\nIn its consultations with education stakeholders, the OHRC heard that post-secondary institutions have worked hard to make their services accessible, and to better accommodate increasing numbers of students with mental health disabilities. Nonetheless, systemic barriers to accommodating post-secondary students with mental health disabilities persist.[81] Given the unprecedented rise in requests for mental health-related accommodations on campuses across Ontario, it is crucial that the government take steps to make sure that post-secondary institutions are properly supported. It can do this by putting in place the necessary mental health services to meet the increased demand, and making sure there is coordination and continuity between all organizations that play a role in ensuring that young adults receive appropriate mental health support in a timely manner.\n\nBack to Top\n\n4.3 Evolving legal definition of disability\n\nHuman rights law is constantly developing, and certain conditions, characteristics or experiences that have not historically been recognized as disabilities, may come to be commonly accepted as such due to changes in the law reflecting medical, social or ideological advancements.\n\nOver time, new disabilities may emerge that take time to be widely recognized and well-understood. For example, in recent years, there have been reports of an increase in food-related anaphylaxis.[82] In Ontario, Sabrina’s Law came into effect in June 2006.[83] This legislation requires every school board in Ontario to establish and maintain an anaphylaxis policy. It also requires school principals to develop an individual plan for each student at risk of anaphylaxis.[84] Human rights case law has recognized that anaphylaxis is a disability under the Code.[85] Therefore, education providers have a legal responsibility to accommodate students with potentially life threatening allergies, as they would any other person with a disability, to the point of undue hardship.\n\nExample: A school board develops a comprehensive food allergy policy\n\nthat includes procedures for training staff in dealing safely with food allergies, including how to recognize symptoms of anaphylaxis and respond appropriately to possible emergencies. Local schools are required to hold information sessions for parents and students to raise awareness about life-threatening food allergies and the importance of including all students in school activities, including students with anaphylaxis.\n\nIn some cases, the law is still not clear on whether certain conditions are disabilities within the meaning of the Code. It is important to note that even where human rights law has not recognized a specific condition as a disability, the Code’s protections will be engaged if a student is perceived to have a disability,[86] or perceived to have functional limitations as a result.\n\nEducation providers should be aware that new and emerging disabilities may not yet be well-understood. In general, the meaning of disability should be interpreted broadly. It may be more challenging for a student with a less-recognized disability to have their disability verified by their family doctor, for example. It may be necessary for an education provider to consult with a specialist with expertise in the disability in question. The focus should always be on the needs and limitations of the student requesting the accommodation, rather than on a specific diagnosis.[87]\n\nBack to Top\n\n4.4 When disability intersects with other Code grounds\n\nDiscrimination may be unique or distinct when it occurs based on two or more Code grounds. Such discrimination is said to be “intersectional.” The concept of intersectional discrimination recognizes that students’ lives involve multiple interrelated identities, and that marginalization and exclusion based on Code grounds may exist because of how these identities intersect. [88]\n\nFor example, the United Nations’ Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has noted the effects of intersectional discrimination on girls and women in school:\n\nIntersectional discrimination and exclusion pose significant barriers to the realization of the right to education for women and girls with disabilities. States parties must identify and remove those barriers, including gender-based violence and the lack of value placed on the education of women and girls, and put in place specific measures to ensure that the right to education is not impeded by gender and/or disability discrimination, stigma or prejudice. Harmful gender and/or disability stereotypes in textbooks and curricula must be eliminated. Education plays a vital role in combating traditional notions of gender that perpetuate patriarchal and paternalistic societal frameworks. States parties must ensure access for and the retention of girls and women with disabilities in education and rehabilitation services, as instruments for their development, advancement and empowerment.[89]\n\nIn 2017, the OHRC’s Chief Commissioner wrote to the Minister of Education to highlight the intersectional needs of First Nations students with disabilities, particularly in relation to Ontario’s role in First Nations special education. The OHRC’s letter supported the concerns raised by, and the recommendations included in, the May 2017 Ontario First Nations Special Education Review Report.[90] Among other things, this report identifies serious human rights concerns with Ontario’s approach to First Nations children with special education needs attending provincial schools, and off-reserve First Nations students who wish to attend First Nations schools. Concerns include inequitable access to special education funding that directly affects the services available to First Nations children with special needs.[91]\n\nDiscrimination based on a disability could intersect with discrimination based on other Code grounds, including:\n\nrace, colour or ethnic background\n\ncreed (religion)\n\nancestry (including Indigenous ancestry)\n\ncitizenship (including refugee or permanent resident status)\n\ngender identity and gender expression\n\nsex (including pregnancy)\n\nfamily status\n\nmarital status (including people with a same sex partner)\n\nanother type of disability, including mental, learning, cognitive and intellectual disabilities\n\nsexual orientation\n\nage.\n\nPeople with disabilities are also more likely to have low incomes than people without disabilities, and many people live in chronic poverty. A student’s experience with low income may be highly relevant to understanding the impact of discrimination on a student with a disability, and this may result in specific experiences of discrimination.\n\nEducation providers should take steps to make sure that participating in education, particularly at the post-secondary level, is not more financially onerous for students with disabilities (and their families). For example, students with disabilities should not experience negative financial consequences if they opt to study part-time as a result of their disability, or take a disability-related leave of absence.[92]\n\nAs part of the duty to maintain environments that are free from discrimination and harassment, education providers must take steps to design their programs, policies and environments inclusively, to take into account the needs of students from diverse backgrounds, with a range of unique identities.\n\nExample: A university organization providing support services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students ensures that its literature is available in alternative formats that are accessible to students with visual disabilities.\n\nEducation providers should also take steps to make sure that their faculty and staff members have cultural competency skills.[93] The ability to interact comfortably and effectively with students from diverse cultural backgrounds is an important first step towards recognizing and meeting the human rights-related needs of different populations, including students with disabilities who also identify by other Code grounds.\n\nEducation providers should use an individualized approach that recognizes each student’s unique identity and the fact that each student is uniquely situated to understand their own needs.\n\nThe OHRC is also concerned about reports of students being “streamed” into particular programs based on stereotypical assumptions about their capabilities due to their identification with the Code grounds of disability and race. For example, research indicates that in some jurisdictions, a disproportionate number of racialized students are put into special education classes, due to a perception that they have a disability.[94] Education providers need to ensure that unconscious biases and negative stereotypes are not influencing assessments of a student’s capabilities.\n\nEducation providers need to be aware of the impact of discipline policies and practices on students who have or are perceived to have disabilities, and who are racialized. The OHRC has challenged the negative impact of such policies in the past, and will continue to be alert to situations where the intersection of these grounds negatively affects a student’s access to education.\n\nEducation providers must ensure that testing and evaluation materials and procedures used to grade and place students with disabilities are not selected or implemented in a way that is racially or culturally biased, and do not otherwise infringe the rights protected by the Code.\n\nLanguage can also be a factor in discrimination based on related Code grounds such as ancestry, ethnic origin, place of origin, race, citizenship and creed. Francophone students with disabilities, in particular, have official language minority rights under the Charter and Ontario’s Education Act. Differential treatment might occur, for example, because of an intersection between French language minority rights and human rights legislation, when Francophones try to exercise these rights together. For example, students with disabilities in Ontario’s French-language education system have reported difficulty accessing special education services and specialists in their language.[95]\n\nBack to Top\n\n5. What is discrimination?\n\nThe Code does not provide a definition of discrimination. [96] Instead, the understanding of discrimination has evolved from case law. To establish prima facie discrimination (discrimination on its face) under the Code, a student must show that:\n\nthey have a characteristic protected from discrimination (e.g. disability)\n\nthey have experienced an adverse impact within a social area (e.g. education) protected by the Code, and\n\nthe protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact.[97]\n\nThe student must show that discrimination occurred on a “balance of probabilities,” that is, it is more reasonable and probable than not that discrimination took place. Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden shifts to the education provider to justify the conduct within the framework of the exemptions available under the Code (e.g. bona fide requirement defence). If it cannot be justified, discrimination will be found to have occurred.\n\nDiscrimination does not have to be intentional. Intent is irrelevant for establishing that discrimination occurred.\n\nBack to Top\n\n5.1 Forms of discrimination\n\n5.1.1 Direct, indirect, subtle and adverse effect discrimination\n\nDiscrimination may take many different forms. For example, it may take place in a direct way. It can happen when education providers specifically exclude students with disabilities from educational services, withhold benefits that are available to others, or impose extra burdens that are not imposed on others, without a legitimate or bona fide reason. This discrimination is often based on negative attitudes, stereotypes and bias towards students with disabilities.\n\nDiscrimination may also happen indirectly. It may be carried out through another person or organization.\n\nExample: A private school “indirectly” discriminates by instructing an admissions scout it has hired not to recruit students with disabilities who have costly accommodation requirements.\n\nThe organization or person that sets out discriminatory conditions, and the organization or person that carries out this discrimination, can both be named in a human rights claim and held responsible.\n\nDiscrimination is often subtle. Discriminatory remarks are not often made directly, and people do not usually voice stereotypical views as a reason for their behaviour. Subtle forms of discrimination can usually only be detected after looking at all of the circumstances to determine if a pattern of behaviour exists. Individual acts themselves may be ambiguous or explained away, but when viewed as part of a larger picture, may lead to an inference that discrimination based on a Code ground was a factor in the treatment a person received. An inexplicable departure from usual practices may establish a claim of discrimination.[98] Also, criteria that are applied to some students but not others may signal that students with disabilities are being singled out for different treatment and this may be evidence of discrimination.\n\nSometimes seemingly neutral rules, standards, policies, practices or requirements have an “adverse effect” on students with disabilities.\n\nExample: A university policy of awarding scholarships only to students in full-time attendance would likely have an adverse effect on students whose disabilities only permit them to attend school on a part-time basis.\n\nMany laws, requirements or standards are put in place without considering the unique needs or circumstances of students with disabilities. Education providers have a responsibility to understand where these may have a discriminatory effect, and to remove this effect where it occurs.\n\nBack to Top\n\n5.1.2 Harassment\n\nPart of an educational institution’s duty to maintain a safe learning environment for all students, including students with disabilities, includes addressing bullying and harassing[99] behaviour. The Code defines harassment as “engaging in a course[100] of vexatious comment or conduct that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome.”[101] The reference to comment or conduct “that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome” establishes both a subjective and an objective test for harassment.\n\nThe subjective part is the harasser’s own knowledge of how his or her behaviour is being received. The objective component considers, from the point of view of a “reasonable” person, how such behaviour would generally be received. Determining the point of view of a “reasonable” person must take into account the perspective of the person who is harassed.[102] In other words, the HRTO can conclude based on the evidence before it that an individual knew, or should have known, that their actions were unwelcome.[103]\n\nAll students, including students with disabilities, have the right to be free from harassment in education. Section 1 of the Code guarantees the right to equal treatment in services without discrimination based on disability, among other Code grounds. Harassment based on disability, as a form of discrimination, is therefore prohibited in education services.[104] This protection would apply to sanction: (i) education providers who themselves harass students based on Code grounds, and (ii) education providers who know or ought to know that a student is being harassed based on Code grounds, and who do not take effective individualized and systemic steps to remedy that harassment.\n\nIf left unchecked, harassment can impede a student’s ability to access education services equally and to fully take part in the educational experience.\n\nExample: In a classroom, a student with Tourette’s Syndrome is repeatedly subjected to taunting and teasing by a group of students. The same group of students exclude him from recess activities stating that he is “different” and “weird.” It may be inferred from the particular circumstances that the treatment is due to his disability, even though none of the other students has ever made a direct reference to his disability. He begins to experience stomach aches in the morning and tells his parents he does not want to go to school. As a result of this harassment, his ability to access the education program is impaired.\n\nThere is no requirement that a student must object to the harassment at the time for a violation of the Code to exist, or for the student to claim their rights under the Code.[105] A student with a disability who is the target of harassment may be in a vulnerable situation, and afraid of the consequences of speaking out. Education providers have an obligation to maintain an environment that is free of discrimination and harassment, whether or not anyone objects.[106]\n\nSome conduct or comments relating to disability may not, on their face, be offensive. However, they may still be “unwelcome” from the perspective of a particular student. If similar behaviour is repeated despite indications from the student that it is unwelcome, there may be a violation of the Code. Every student has the right to be free from humiliating or annoying behaviour that is based on their disability.\n\nStudents may experience “a course of unwelcome conduct” based on a disability, a past or perceived disability, their accommodation needs, the treatment they are receiving (e.g. medication or therapy), or the side-effects of treatment. Harassment could include:\n\nslurs, name-calling or pejorative nicknames based on disability\n\ngraffiti, images or cartoons depicting people with disabilities in a negative light\n\ncomments ridiculing people because of disability-related characteristics\n\nintrusive questioning or remarks about a student’s disability, medication,[107] treatment or accommodation needs\n\nsingling out a student for teasing or jokes related to disability\n\ninappropriately disclosing a student’s disability to people who do not need to know\n\nrepeatedly excluding students with disabilities from the social environment, or “shunning”\n\ncirculating offensive material about people with disabilities at an educational institution by email, text, the Internet, etc.\n\nHarassment based on Code grounds is occurring increasingly through online technology, including cell phone text messaging, social media, blogs and email.[108] While there are sometimes complex jurisdictional issues around the legal regulation of online harassment, education providers may be liable for a poisoned environment caused when online communications containing comment or conduct that would amount to harassment are accessed through technology operated by the educational institution, or by private electronic devices used on the institution’s premises.[109]\n\nHarassment may take different forms depending on whether the affected person identifies with more than one Code ground.\n\nExample: A female student who is blind is repeatedly asked out on dates by her university teaching assistant. Despite telling him she is not interested, he continues to approach her after the tutorial and on several occasions has waited for her outside of other classes she is taking. The student’s experience of sexual harassment is exacerbated by the fact that, due to her disability, she is unable to detect his presence until he is in close proximity to her.\n\nCourts and tribunals have established that schools have a duty to maintain a positive, non-discriminatory learning environment.[110] When students are harassed due to disability, it can impair their access to educational services and create a toxic learning environment. An education provider has a responsibility to take immediate remedial action once made aware of harassing conduct. If an allegation of harassment has been substantiated, this may include disciplinary action.\n\nIn 2016, the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth published a report canvassing the lived experience of young people with special needs and their families in Ontario. The report states, “Many young people reported spending years in classrooms feeling like they didn’t have what it took to be successful in school, some even reported being yelled at by teachers and educational assistants and being bullied by other youth. They wanted their teachers to protect them from harm and make them feel safe in class.”[111]\n\nAnti-harassment training for educators and school staff is an important first step in creating a climate of mutual respect in an education environment. Educators will then be in a position to appropriately address issues of bullying and harassment that arise in the classroom. Education providers should also take steps to educate students about human rights and implement strategies to prevent discrimination and harassment.\n\nIn a recent survey of parents of students with intellectual disabilities in Ontario, 64.9% of parents surveyed reported that their children “experienced some form of bullying related to their disability.” They indicated that this was done “by other students, parents, and, at times, even school staff.”[112]\n\nEducation providers can help to prevent incidents of bullying and harassment before they occur by:\n\nhaving clear policies and standards in place setting out expectations for appropriate behaviour and identifying prohibited behaviour\n\nexhibiting a clear attitude of non-tolerance towards bullying and harassment\n\ncommunicating clearly to the student body the consequences of bullying and harassment\n\neducating students about disability issues and encouraging awareness of differing needs and acceptance of diversity\n\nengaging in role-playing and exercises to help students develop increased compassion and a greater awareness of the impact that bullying behaviour may be having on others\n\nrespecting the confidentiality of students who do report bullying (this will also encourage other students who are being harassed to report it in its early stages).\n\nEducation institutions can go a long way toward promoting a harassment-free environment for students with disabilities, and other individuals protected by the Code, by having a clear, comprehensive anti-harassment policy in place. In cases of alleged harassment, the policy will alert all parties to their rights, roles and responsibilities. Such a policy should clearly set out ways the harassment will be dealt with promptly and efficiently. See Appendix C for suggested contents of an anti-harassment policy.\n\nAll students and school staff should be aware of the existence of an anti-harassment policy and the procedures in place for resolving complaints. This can be done by:\n\ndistributing policies to everyone as soon as they are introduced\n\nmaking new students aware of them by including the policies in any orientation material\n\ntraining educators and school staff on the contents of the policies, and\n\nproviding ongoing education on human rights issues.\n\nBack to Top\n\n5.1.3 Poisoned environment\n\nA poisoned environment is a form of discrimination. In the employment context, human rights tribunals have held that the atmosphere of a workplace is a condition of employment as much as hours of work or rate of pay. A “term or condition of employment” includes the emotional and psychological circumstances of the workplace.[113] These concepts also apply in education.[114]\n\nA poisoned environment is created when unwelcome disability-related conduct or comments are pervasive within an institution, and result in a hostile or oppressive atmosphere for one or more people with a disability.\n\nAt times, there may be overlap between harassment and a poisoned environment – for example, harassing behaviour directed at students with disabilities may cause a poisoned environment.[115] However, “harassment” and “poisoned environment” are two distinct concepts.[116] A poisoned environment can occur where the behaviour would not amount to the legal definition of harassment. For example, on-campus graffiti mocking people with mental health disabilities can create a poisoned environment, but would not likely meet the legal test for harassment which generally requires the occurrence of more than one incident, and that the behaviour be directed at a specific individual. A poisoned environment is based on the nature of the comments or conduct and their impact on an individual, rather than on the number of times the behaviour happens.[117] Sometimes a single remark or action can be so severe or substantial that it results in a poisoned environment.[118]\n\nExample: At the beginning of a lecture, a college instructor expresses irritation to his students about being asked to accommodate a student with a learning disability who is taking his course. He states, “learning disabilities do not exist, there are just lazy students who watch too much television.” This remark could be enough to cause a poisoned environment, not only for the student in question, but for other students with learning and other types of disabilities.[119]\n\nA consequence of creating a poisoned environment is that certain people are subjected to terms and conditions in education that are quite different from those experienced by people who are not subjected to the comments or conduct. This gives rise to a denial of equality under the Code. In some circumstances, a person can experience a poisoned environment even if they are not a member of the group that is the target (i.e. the “spill-over” effects of harassment).\n\nThe comments or actions of any person, regardless their position of authority or status, may create a poisoned environment. Therefore, a teacher, faculty member, staff person, educational assistant, fellow student, etc. can all engage in conduct that poisons the environment of a student with a disability.\n\nAfter conducting a consultation with students and their families, Ontario’s Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth reported: “Many of the young people and parents who sent us submissions said that creating welcoming and safe learning environments – and providing educators with the skills needed to make it happen – should be the number one job of schools. Children who didn’t feel emotionally safe couldn’t learn, partly because unsafe classroom environments compromised their ability to trust. We heard a great deal from parents who often had to struggle for hours just to get their child ready or willing to attend school each day – only to have them go into an environment they experienced as hostile and unwelcoming, where their peers teased or taunted them or in which they could find no emotional support.” [120]\n\nEducation providers have a duty to maintain a non-discriminatory environment, to be aware of a poisoned environment that exists, and to take steps to respond and eliminate it. Education providers in managerial or supervisory roles who know, or ought to know, of a poisoned atmosphere but allow it to continue are discriminating against the affected students even if they are not themselves actively engaged in producing that atmosphere.[121]\n\nBack to Top\n\n5.1.4 Systemic discrimination\n\nDiscrimination based on disability exists not just in individual behaviour, but can also be systemic[122] or institutionalized.[123] Systemic or institutional discrimination is one of the more complex ways that discrimination happens.[124] Education providers have a positive obligation to make sure that they are not engaging in systemic or institutional discrimination.\n\nSystemic or institutional discrimination consists of attitudes, patterns of behaviour, policies or practices that are part of the social or administrative structures of an institution or sector, and that create or perpetuate a position of relative disadvantage for students with disabilities. The attitudes, behaviour, policies or practices may appear neutral on the surface but nevertheless have an “adverse effect” or exclusionary impact on students with disabilities.\n\nExample: To apply for articling positions through a law society, a law student filled out an application that contained the question: “Have you ever been treated for schizophrenia, paranoia, or a mood disorder described as a major affective illness, bipolar mood disorder, or manic depressive illness?” He answered “yes,” because previously he had experienced a couple of episodes of depression, for which he sought treatment. Once he answered “yes,” conditions were placed on him so that each time he needed to re-apply to the law society for activities to advance his career, the issue of his mental competence was re-visited. Despite not having had further episodes of depression, after being admitted to the Bar, he was asked for multiple medical reports and required to see a psychiatrist, he was investigated by two private investigators, and he experienced delays not imposed on others. A human rights tribunal concluded that the question was discriminatory, and caused systemic discrimination against people with the named mental conditions. This was in part because the process following a “yes” answer to the question exposed applicants to a more intensive (and intrusive) evaluation than others. The tribunal also heard evidence that 77% of people who answered “yes” to the question had conditions put on their membership. The tribunal noted that the factors in the case were “sufficient to constitute an adverse impact, especially when viewed against the historical disadvantage and present-day social stigma experienced by people diagnosed with mental disabilities.”[125]\n\nSystemic discrimination can also overlap with other types of discrimination. For example, a policy that has an adverse discriminatory effect can be compounded by the discriminatory attitudes of the person who administers it.\n\nSystemic discrimination is often embedded in an institution or sector, and may be invisible to the people who do not experience it, and even to the people who may be affected by it. It may be “reinforced by the very exclusion of the disadvantaged group” because the exclusion fosters the false belief that it is the result of “natural” forces[126] (for example, that students with disabilities are just not as capable of succeeding academically). To combat systemic discrimination, it is essential for an education institution to design all aspects of its operations inclusively with the diverse needs of its users in mind, and to create a climate where negative practices and attitudes can be challenged and discouraged.\n\nExample: When designing a new student residence complex, a university hires a design expert to ensure that all physical structures are built according to the principles of inclusive design and avoid barriers not covered by the Building Code regulations. This step ensures that the units and common areas are accessible to students with physical disabilities (and ensures they are accessible to families with small children and older people, as well).\n\nIt may not be necessary for multiple people to make complaints about an institution’s policies or practices for their impact to be understood as causing systemic discrimination. Often, it can be inferred from the evidence in one person’s case that many people from a Code-protected group will be negatively affected.\n\nBack to Top\n\n6. Discipline, safe schools and students with disabilities\n\nEnsuring that learning environments are safe, respectful places, free of inappropriate behaviour is of paramount importance. Provincial legislation, regulations and related education policies have been designed and put in place to help education providers fulfil this crucial responsibility.[127] At the same time, in some cases, discipline policies may have an adverse effect on students with disabilities.\n\nDespite amendments to the Education Act meant to ensure that mitigating factors[128] are considered before students with disabilities are disciplined, the OHRC continues to hear that, in many cases, students with disabilities continue to have much higher rates of suspension and/or expulsion than the average.[129] The Ministry of Education’s own statistics for 2015-2016 indicate that 46.9% of suspensions and 45.8% of expulsions involved students with special education needs.[130]\n\nEducation providers need to make sure that they are abiding by their responsibilities under the Code, in addition to professional requirements under the Education Act. Under the Code, education providers have a duty to assess each student with a disability individually before imposing disciplinary sanctions. Disciplinary sanctions include detentions, exclusions, suspensions, expulsions, and other forms of punishment. Educators should attempt to determine whether the behaviour in question is due to the student’s disability by considering:\n\nformal assessments and evaluations of the student\n\nrelevant information supplied by the student and/or the student’s parents/guardians\n\nobservations of the student\n\nthe student’s accommodation plan, if there is one\n\nwhether the accommodations provided for in the student’s accommodation plan were appropriate, and whether these accommodations were being provided consistent with the student’s accommodation plan, at the time of the behaviour in question\n\nwhether the student’s disability impaired his or her ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behaviour\n\nwhether the student’s disability impaired his or her ability to control the behaviour\n\nwhether the student has undetected or undeclared disability-related needs that require accommodation.[131]\n\nUnder the Code, education providers have a legal obligation to accommodate students with disabilities up to the point of undue hardship.[132] All students with disabilities, even students whose behaviour is disruptive, are entitled to receive accommodation.\n\nEducators must consider a range of strategies to address disruptive behaviour. Such strategies will include reassessing and, where necessary, modifying the student’s accommodation plan, providing additional supports, implementing alternative learning techniques, and other forms of positive behavioural intervention.\n\nEducation policies and practices that have an adverse effect on students with disabilities are open to a human rights challenge under the Code.\n\nIf a student’s behaviour is not due to a disability, that is, where there is no causal relationship between the student’s disability and the behaviour in question, then that student would be subject to the normal consequences of their misconduct.[133] Where discipline for misconduct is warranted, it must be implemented with discretion and with regard to the student’s unique circumstances.[134]\n\nThere may be rare situations where a student’s behaviour, even where it is a manifestation of their disability, poses a health and safety risk to the student, other students, teachers and/or school staff. While an education provider in this type of situation continues to have a duty to accommodate the student up to the point of undue hardship, it is recognized that there may be legitimate health and safety concerns that need to be addressed. This issue is discussed in more detail in the “Undue hardship” section of this policy under “Health and safety.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n7. Reprisal\n\nSection 8 of the Code protects people from reprisal or threats of reprisal.[135] A reprisal is an action, or threat, that is intended as retaliation for claiming or enforcing a right under the Code.\n\nStudents with disabilities – or others on their behalf – may try to enforce their Code rights by objecting to discrimination, making an internal discrimination complaint to an educational institution, or making a claim at the HRTO. However, there is no strict requirement that someone who alleges reprisal must have already made an official complaint or application under the Code.[136] Also, to claim reprisal, a person does not have to show that their rights were actually infringed.[137]\n\nThe following will establish that a student has experienced reprisal based on a Code ground:\n\nan action was taken against, or a threat was made to, the student\n\nthe alleged action or threat was related to the student having claimed, or trying to enforce, a Code right, and\n\nthere was an intention on the part of the education provider to retaliate for the claim or the attempt to enforce the right.[138]\n\nExample: A mother has many email exchanges with her son’s teacher because the supports identified in the boy’s accommodation plan are not being implemented. After being unable to resolve the issue, she escalates the matter by calling the school principal. The principal speaks with the boy’s teacher about the telephone call and what was discussed. The teacher then refuses to reply to the mother’s phone calls and emails, and the boy is repeatedly kept in for recess without explanation. The teacher’s behaviour could amount to reprisal under the Code.\n\nPeople associated with a student with a disability who has complained about discrimination are also protected from discrimination and reprisal.[139]\n\nBack to Top\n\nUnder the Code, education providers have a legal duty to accommodate the needs of students with disabilities who are adversely affected by a requirement, rule or standard.[140] Accommodation is necessary to address barriers in education that would otherwise prevent students with disabilities from having equal opportunities, access and benefits.\n\nIn a recent survey of parents of students with intellectual disabilities in Ontario, 53.2% of parents surveyed reported that their child was not receiving proper academic accommodations; and 68.2% of parents reported that schools were “meeting half or less than half of their child’s academic needs.” In interviews, parents emphasized “the devastating effects of low expectations and lack of opportunity for engagement.”[141]\n\nEducation environments should be designed inclusively and must be adapted to accommodate the needs of a student with a disability in a way that promotes integration and full participation.\n\nAccommodation does not mean lowering “bona fide academic requirements,” which are the skills or attributes that one has to meet to be eligible for admission, pass a class or course, graduate from a program, etc.\n\nThe duty to accommodate has both a substantive and a procedural component. The procedure to assess an accommodation (the process) is as important as the substantive content of the accommodation (the accommodation provided).[142] In a case involving the accommodation of a mental health disability in the workplace, the court said: “a failure to give any thought or consideration to the issue of accommodation, including what, if any, steps could be taken constitutes a failure to satisfy the ‘procedural’ duty to accommodate.”[143]\n\nEducation providers are responsible for ensuring that they meet both the procedural and the substantive components of the duty to accommodate.[144] In one case, the HRTO stated:\n\nThe analysis is no different than an employer’s obligation to accommodate an employee’s disability. Procedurally, the [school board] is under an obligation, once a disability is identified, to determine what kind of modifications or accommodations might be required in order to allow a student to fully participate in school. The substantive duty requires the respondent Board and each individual school, in this case, to make the modifications or provide accommodation necessary in order to allow a student to fully participate, such as academic modifications, accommodation and behavioural strategies, if required, up to the point of undue hardship.[145]\n\nTo fulfil the procedural component of the duty to accommodate, there needs to be meaningful interaction between the parties that focuses on the student’s needs and consideration of whether the education provider can accommodate those needs.\n\nExample: A school board was found to have failed in the procedural obligations of the duty to accommodate when it neglected to review the individual needs of a student with autism, and did not seriously consider whether it could meet those needs by modifying its transportation policy to permit the boy to attend school for part of the day.[146]\n\nIn Ontario, it is clear that a failure in the procedural duty to accommodate can lead to a finding of a breach of the Code, even if there was no substantive accommodation that could have been provided short of undue hardship. Failure to perform either component of the duty is a failure to carry out the duty to accommodate.[147]\n\nAn education provider will not be able to argue persuasively that providing accommodation would cause undue hardship if it has not taken steps to explore accommodation solutions, and otherwise fulfil the procedural component of the duty to accommodate.[148]\n\nBack to Top\n\n8.1 Principles of accommodation\n\nThe duty to accommodate is informed by three principles: respect for dignity, individualization, as well as integration and full participation.\n\n8.1.1 Respect for dignity\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states: “…discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person.”[149]\n\nThe duty to accommodate students with disabilities means accommodation must be provided in the way that most respects the dignity of the student, if doing so does not cause undue hardship.[150] Human dignity encompasses individual self-respect, self-worth and inherent worth as a human being. It includes physical and psychological integrity and empowerment.[151] It is harmed when students are marginalized, stigmatized, ignored or devalued. Privacy, confidentiality, comfort, individuality and self-esteem are all important factors.\n\nRespect for a student’s autonomy is also crucial, particularly at the secondary and post-secondary levels of education. Education providers should recognize a student’s right to self-determination, to be treated without paternalism, and to make decisions in their own best interest with minimal interference. Education providers need to consider how an accommodation is provided and the student’s own participation in the process.\n\nRespect for dignity includes being considered as a whole person, not merely in relation to one’s disability. It includes respecting and valuing the perspectives of students with disabilities, particularly when students speak about their own experiences.\n\nEducation providers should consider different ways of accommodating students with disabilities along a continuum, ranging from ways that most respect dignity and other human rights values, to those that least respect those values.\n\nExample: An accommodation that shows little respect for the dignity of a student with a disability is an accessible entrance over a loading dock or through a service area or garbage room. Students who use mobility devices should have the same opportunity as others to enter a building in a pleasant and convenient way.\n\nEducation providers have a duty to maintain a positive school environment for all people they serve. The attitudes of educators towards disability issues play a major role in influencing how other students treat and relate to students with disabilities. Educators should make efforts to sensitize students about disability issues and to model respectful attitudes and behaviour towards students with disabilities. Education providers need to address any behaviour that may be damaging to the dignity of students with disabilities.\n\nBack to Top\n\n8.1.2 Individualization\n\nThere is no set formula for accommodation. Each student's needs are unique and must be considered afresh when an accommodation request is made. At all times, the emphasis must be on the individual student’s needs and not on the type of disability.[152] Blanket approaches to accommodation that rely solely on categories, labels and generalizations are not acceptable.[153] Accommodations may need to be re-visited over time to make sure they continue to meet a student’s needs appropriately.\n\nAlthough many accommodations will benefit large numbers of students with similar needs, an accommodation solution that meets one student's requirements may not meet the needs of another. Students sharing the same condition often experience it in very different ways, with different symptoms, limitations and prognoses. For example, while some students with visual impairments read Braille, many do not. Different effects of a disability and different learning styles may call for different approaches.[154]\n\nExample: An appropriate accommodation for a student who is deaf and whose primary language of communication is American Sign Language or Langue des signes québecoise might be a Provincial School for the Deaf or a sign language instructional program in a local community school. At the same time, an appropriate accommodation for another student, who is also profoundly deaf, and who primarily uses auditory-verbal communication, might be inclusion in a regular classroom with supports.\n\nIndividualized accommodation will also require education providers to be mindful of the fact that many students with disabilities will identify by other Code grounds, in addition to disability. Education providers need to consider how these interrelated identities may be relevant when they devise appropriate accommodation solutions.\n\nExample: An eight-year-old boy with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, whose family has recently immigrated to Ontario from Sri Lanka, registers at his neighbourhood public school. To help facilitate the accommodation process, the school principal provides the family with written information in Tamil, the family’s first language, about the workings of the special education system and the resources available to students with disabilities.\n\nBack to Top\n\n8.1.3 Integration and full participation\n\nAccommodations should be developed and implemented with a view to maximizing a student’s integration and full participation. Achieving integration and full participation requires barrier-free and inclusive design, as well as removing existing barriers. Where barriers continue to exist because it is impossible to remove them at a given point in time, then individual accommodations should be provided, up to the point of undue hardship.\n\nExample: At his parents’ request, a children’s swimming program at a daycare centre assigns an additional instructor to a class that includes a boy who has a mobility impairment, because the neighbourhood pool does not have an accessible ramp and handrails. This allows the boy to get the extra support he needs to access the service within the regular program.\n\nEducational facilities should be built, and must be adapted, to accommodate the needs of students with disabilities in a way that promotes their integration and full participation. Education providers must take steps to include students with disabilities in classroom and extra-curricular activities, wherever possible. Education policies, programs, services and activities should be designed inclusively with the needs of all students in mind, so they do not exclude or single out any student. Education policies must take into account the diverse needs of the student population, and must plan for alternative measures to address the needs of students with disabilities.\n\nExample: Workplace tensions have risen to the point where a labour strike by school staff appears imminent. Thinking ahead, the school board works together with school principals to draft a contingency plan for students that would permit them to continue attending school should there be a work stoppage. The plan includes specific provisions addressing the needs of students with disabilities, and includes a back-up plan in the event that educational assistants, special needs assistants and other special education staff are part of a walkout.\n\nIt is well-established in human rights law that equality may sometimes require different treatment that does not offend the person’s dignity. In some circumstances, the best way to ensure the equality of students with disabilities may be to provide separate or specialized services. However, education providers should keep in mind that segregated treatment in educational services for people with disabilities is less dignified and is unacceptable, unless it can be shown that integrated treatment would pose undue hardship or that segregation is the only way to achieve equality.[155]\n\nBack to Top\n\n8.2 Inclusive design\n\nEnsuring integration and full participation means designing the education system for inclusiveness. The concept of inclusive or “universal” design[156] has been tailored to fit the education context. “Universal Design for Learning” (UDL)[157] emphasizes equal participation and recognizes that all students have varying abilities and needs. This method of design is a preferred approach to removing barriers or making “one-off” accommodations, which assume that existing structures may only need slight modifications to make them acceptable.[158]\n\nOntario’s Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth has recognized that “even the most dedicated and skillful teacher cannot help all students in a classroom when the ‘whole school’ environment is not designed and equipped to be welcoming and supportive of the unique needs of all learners.”[159]\n\nIt is important for education providers to note that the right to equality can be breached by a failure to address the needs of disadvantaged groups. The Supreme Court of Canada has observed:\n\n[T]he principle that discrimination can accrue from a failure to take positive steps to ensure that disadvantaged groups benefit equally from services offered to the general public is widely accepted in the human rights field.[160]\n\nThe Supreme Court has also noted the need to “fine-tune” society so that structures and assumptions do not exclude people with disabilities from taking part in society.[161] The Court has affirmed that standards should be designed to reflect all members of society, to the extent that this is reasonably possible.[162]\n\nExample: A university develops a “Voluntary Leave of Absence” policy that sets out a formalized approach to situations where a student needs to take a temporary leave of absence from their studies (due to, for example, a mental health challenge, other health-related concern, sudden unexpected circumstance such as the death of a loved one, etc.). The policy begins with a statement outlining the institution’s commitment to fulfilling its legal obligation to accommodate the disability-related needs of students, and includes information on how to coordinate support services available to students, reduce financial penalties wherever possible, and facilitate successful resumption of studies when the student is able. By letting students, staff and faculty know that the policy exists, the university is helping to reduce organizational barriers to taking a temporary leave, de-stigmatize the decision to take a hiatus from studies, support student health and well-being, and ensure that more students return to their studies after a temporary leave and are able to graduate from post-secondary education.[163]\n\nEducation providers need to build in conceptions of equality to standards or requirements. This proactive approach is more effective because it emphasizes accessibility and inclusion from the start. Barrier prevention is much more preferable to barrier removal, and it is consistent with the notion of disability as a social model that conceptualizes “disability” as the outcome of socially constructed barriers and society’s failure to accommodate difference.[164]\n\nThe United Nations’ Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has expressed its support of UDL. It has encouraged States Parties to the CRPD to adopt the universal design for learning approach, which consists of a set of principles providing teachers and other staff with a structure for creating adaptable learning environments and developing instruction to meet the diverse needs of all learners.\n\nUniversal Design for Learning recognizes that each student learns in a unique way and involves:\n\ndeveloping flexible ways to learn\n\ncreating an engaging classroom environment\n\nmaintaining high expectations for all students while allowing for multiple ways to meet expectations\n\nempowering teachers to think differently about their own teaching\n\nfocusing on educational outcomes for all, including persons with disabilities.\n\nCurricula must be conceived, des"
