        "text": "Ontario students need qualified teachers who are passionate about learning and want to help students achieve to the best of their abilities.\n\nTo teach in a publicly funded school in Ontario, you must be licensed by the Ontario College of Teachers. Teachers who are licensed by the College are known as Ontario Certified Teachers (OCT), which is a legislatively protected professional designation.\n\nThe College welcomes applications from teachers educated outside Canada. Even if you currently live outside the country, you can still apply.\n\nGetting that first job in Canada can be like solving a puzzle. Many job postings insist on Canadian work experience, creating a bit of a mystery for newcomers.\n\n1 – Review the requirements and take the online assessment\n\nTake our free online assessment to see if you meet the requirements to become an OCT. Please note that the online assessment is only intended as a guide. Results are not a guarantee that you will be certified if you apply.\n\n2 – Watch our videos on YouTube\n\nApplying to the College\n\nThis video provides information on the application process, required documents, as well as resources and tools that are available to applicants.\n\nObtaining Documents to Complete your Application\n\nThis video provides information for those who have applied to the College and need more information on what documents they need and how to get them.\n\n3 – Find information and advice on our website\n\nVisit our webpage for Internationally Educated Teachers, where you will find links to our registration guides and other information about applying to the College. You can also find country-specific information about required documents.\n\nYou are also encouraged visit our online FAQs for additional information about applicable fees, qualifications required to teach in Ontario, and other College operations.\n\n4 – Register for an information session\n\nThe College holds information sessions for internationally educated teachers. A schedule of upcoming sessions is available on the College website.\n\n5 – Gather all your required documents before applying\n\nThe College is unable to begin processing your application until we have received all required documents and applicable fees. To avoid potential delays, you are strongly encouraged to only begin your application once you have gathered all required documents and are able to pay applicable fees.\n\nImmigration to Canada\n\nThe Government of Canada is responsible for all matters related to immigration and citizenship. You can find more information by visiting the Government of Canada’s website or contacting a Canadian embassy or consulate.\n\nFinding employment as a teacher in Ontario\n\nSchool boards are responsible for all matters related to employment, including recruitment and hiring. Please note that certification by the College is not a guarantee that you will find employment as a teacher. You can find a list of school boards authorities on the Government of Ontario’s website.\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe Government of Ontario’s Ministry of Education is responsible for all matters related to curriculum. You can find more information by visiting their website."
