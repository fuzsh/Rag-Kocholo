We offer our sincere gratitude to them as the stewards of this land, which is protected by the Dish With One Spoon Wampum agreement’s three principles: to take only what you need, leave enough for others, and always keep the dish clean. Today, many First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities from across Turtle Island continue to live and work in this territory. Acknowledging the peoples whose territory we are on, and the agreements that guide their stewardship of the land, reminds us to reflect on and respect their unique relationship to this land. It also is an invitation for all of us to identify and engage in actions that respect and reinforce our commitments to Truth and Reconciliation and Indigenous Rights."
