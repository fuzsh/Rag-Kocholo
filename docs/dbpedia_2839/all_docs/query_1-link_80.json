        "text": "The Ministry of Education is responsible for overseeing all aspects of Ontario’s public and early childhood education system. Under the Education Act, the Ministry is responsible for:\n\nSetting the provincial curriculum (what students will learn in each grade)\n\nAllocating funding to school boards\n\nSetting policies and guidelines for school boards\n\nEstablishing the requirements for graduation diplomas and certificates\n\nCreating lists of approved textbooks and learning resources\n\nThe Minister of Education and the Associate Minister (for Early Years and Child Care) are elected Members of Provincial Parliament (MPP), and are appointed by the Premier.\n\nFor more information, visit the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe EQAO is an independent government body that administers province-wide testing to every student in grades 3, 6, 9 and 10. It provides test results to individual students, school boards and the province. The EQAO also surveys students in those grades, as well as principals and teachers, and provides results from these attitudinal and behavioural questionnaires to school boards.\n\nThe EQAO is is responsible for:\n\nDeveloping and administering tests in reading, writing and math\n\nReporting test results to the Ministry and the public\n\nProviding recommendations to improve test results\n\nFor more information, visit the EQAO website.\n\nTrustees are elected to the school board during municipal elections, and act as the locally elected representatives of the public and parents. Trustees receive an annual honorarium that ranges from $6,000 to $26,000. School trustees are responsible for:\n\nestablishing a board’s mission, vision, values, goals and climate\n\ndeveloping multi-year board plans to achieve the board’s goals, consulting with parents, students and supporters of the board on the plan and bringing feedback to the attention of the board\n\nensuring conditions in the board promote student achievement and well-being\n\nensuring effective stewardship of the school board’s budget and resources\n\nmaking decisions about policy direction. Overall policy decisions are made by the trustees with input from the community, and based on the advice of staff. Day-to-day decisions are left to staff.\n\nParticipating in decisions that benefit the entire board and upholding the resolutions of the board\n\nHiring and reviewing the performance of the board’s director of education\n\nParticipating in committees, such as the Special Education Advisory Committee, and the Parent Involvement Committee, and participating in quasi-judicial committees such as those responsible for suspensions and expulsions and special education appeals.\n\nFor more information about trustees and their work, read:\n\nThe Role of School Board Trustees\n\nOr visit:\n\nOntario Public School Boards’ Association (OPSBA) – English public school boards\n\nOntario Catholic School Trustees’ Association (OCSTA) – English Catholic school boards\n\nAssociation des conseils scolaires des écoles publiques de l’Ontario (ACEPO) – French public school boards\n\nAssociation franco-ontarienne des conseils scolaires catholiques (AFOCSC) – French Catholic school boards\n\nThe Director of Education is the Chief Executive Officer for the school board, and is appointed by the trustees. The director is responsible for overseeing the operations of the school board, including the management of business services, improvement of student academic performance, and the operation and maintenance of school buildings. For more information, visit the Council of Ontario Directors of Education (CODE) website.\n\nSchool superintendents or “supervisory officers” are board staff responsible for groups of schools in each school board. Superintendents may be involved in suspension appeals, special education meetings, and requests to attend a school other than the home school.\n\nSuperintendents may also be assigned by the board to oversee board-wide programs (e.g. Superintendent for special education).\n\nFor more information, visit the Ontario Public Supervisory Officers’ Association.\n\nSchool councils provide advice to the principal and school board. Every school must have a school council, and members include parents, the principal, a teacher, a student (in high schools), a non-teaching staff member, and a community representative. The majority of members must be parents, and the chair must be a parent. Principals do not vote on school council decisions.\n\nSchool councils are governed by Ontario Regulation 612, which sets out the purpose, membership and election requirements. Under section 2(1), the purpose of the school council is “through the active participation of parents, to improve pupil achievement and to enhance the accountability of the education system to parents.”\n\nSchool councils are responsible for:\n\nSharing information with parents and the community, and seeking their input on matters the council is discussing.\n\nProviding advice to the principal and school board on issues such as school year calendars, strategies to improve school performance, codes of conduct and dress, curriculum priorities, safe arrival programs, community use of schools and community programs provided at the school, selection criteria for principals and board policies that will affect the school.\n\nMany school councils are also actively involved in organizing social events for the school community and fundraising events. Council meetings are open to everyone in the community, so you do not have to be a member to attend. The Ministry of Education has developed a school council guide to assist school councils in their work.\n\nMost high schools in Ontario have a student council. The student council is elected by students in the school, and represents all students and their interests at school, on the school council, and at the school board. Student councils are often involved in planning activities and events for students, and may also organize fundraising activities to support school programs or charitable causes."
