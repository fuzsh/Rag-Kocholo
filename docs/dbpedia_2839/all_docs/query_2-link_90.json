        "text": "The CRNA is making strategic changes to reduce barriers for internationally educated nurses (IENs) to receive permits to practise in Alberta. We are committed to helping strengthen health care in the province.\n\nThe CRNA exists to protect the public's health and welfare by assuring that safe and competent nursing care is provided by licensed nurses. Any person who has knowledge of misconduct by a registrant that may violate a nursing law or rule may file a complaint about the alleged violation here.\n\nUp until the end of 2021, we were known as the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta—CARNA, but strategic and legislated changes have required us to divest association activities and focus on a single regulatory mandate. Looking for information about the Alberta nursing association? Contact info for the association can be found here.\n\nThe CRNA Council is comprised of sixteen members—eight public representatives and eight registrants. The governance structure ensures the Council's mandate is achieved through clear delegation of their authority to governance and regulatory committees, while ensuring to have equal numbers of public and registrant members where appropriate.\n\nThe 2022-2023 practice year saw the College advance ground-breaking changes in how we register nurses, assist applicants and utilize technology. The annual report outlines our achievements for the year, and features statistics and facts that illustrate our successes.\n\nAre you a recent graduate from an approved nursing program and have never held a permit? Get started on your application.\n\nAre you registered in good standing in a jurisdiction considered equivalent to Alberta? Apply to practise using this application if you are registered in a recognized equivalent jurisdiction.\n\nDo you have a combination of education, experience, practice, or other qualifications that demonstrate competence to practise in Alberta? Start this application if you are not from one of the equivalent jurisdictions and didn't graduate from an approved nursing program.\n\nHave you been previously registered to practise in Alberta? Find out your next steps to manage your practice."
