        "text": "Registrar's Report\n\nStronger and Brighter\n\nThe College's new governance structure will improve our capacity to protect students.\n\nThe Ontario College of Teachers was established nearly 25 years ago. The idea to form a self-regulatory body for Ontario's teaching profession came about in 1994, when the provincial government's Royal Commission on Learning drafted its landmark report For the Love of Learning. The goal of the report was to \"ensure that Ontario's youth are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century.\"\n\nFor the Love of Learning articulated a vision and action plan to guide reform of Ontario's public school system, including governance of the teaching profession. Three years after the report was published, the College opened its doors and elected its first governing Council. Since that time, the College has been governed by seven more Councils, each tasked with ensuring it met its mandate of protecting the now two million students attending the province's publicly funded schools.\n\nIn 2018, the College conducted an independent review of its governance practices and structure as part of its commitment to continuous improvement. The report provided 37 recommendations to improve how the College regulates Ontario's teachers, the majority of which were adopted by the eighth Council. Many of these recommendations were incorporated in legislative amendments to the Ontario College of Teachers Act introduced by the current government.\n\nToday, the College is entering a new era. The legislated modernization of its governance structure, which took root earlier this year, puts the College on a direct path to becoming a global model for self-regulation. The new Council will be in place in early 2022 and will benefit from an equal number of Ontario Certified Teachers and members of the public. These individuals, along with those who will serve on committees and adjudicative rosters, will be appointed based on competencies. This will help ensure a more diverse, relevant and nimble governing body that is reflective of our province and our long-standing commitment to collaboration and inclusion.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to get involved in your profession and to truly have an impact on the future of public education in Ontario. Applications are open at oct.ca from August 16 until September 30. Those who are selected to serve in one of the more than 100 positions available will reap the rewards of growing their professional experience and knowledge in regulation and education.\n\nLet us enter this new era of self-regulation together and make a difference in Ontario's publicly funded schools."
