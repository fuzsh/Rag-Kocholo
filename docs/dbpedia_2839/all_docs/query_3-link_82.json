        "text": "Article content\n\nThere are many problems raised in the report on the Ontario College of Teachers’ (OCT) disciplinary practices by retired judge Patrick LeSage.\n\nSome go back years, as the Sun has previously reported.\n\nA key one was the 2006 McGuinty government decision to put the OCT under the majority control of “working teachers.” The government was warned, even by former college registrars, that doing so would put the college — responsible for regulating and disciplining teachers in the public’s interest — under the sway of teacher unions.\n\nWhy? Because everyone knew that “working teachers,” running for the OCT’s governing council positions, would likely be union picks.\n\nThe report by LeSage, former chief justice of the Ontario Superior Court, underscores the results.\n\nReleased Thursday, it contains 49 recommendations for tightening the college’s investigation and discipline procedures, making them more transparent, as well as publicly identifying teachers guilty of misconduct.\n\nLesage’s report notes concerns — even before the college was created — that it not come under the undue influence of unions.\n\nIt quotes a 1995 royal commission that sparked the college’s creation.\n\nWhile that commission favoured having teachers in charge of their college: “… we do not see the college as an extension of the teacher federations and associations … Whatever mechanisms are adopted, it is critical that no one interest group have undue influence in the College.” Nevertheless, as LeSage did his work in 2011 and 2012, some of those he spoke to said that’s what’s happened.\n\nAs he wrote: “There has been cynicism expressed to us about the relationship of the teacher unions with Council. This is exacerbated when, as we are told, prior to each Council meeting, the elected members of Council meet with their respective unions to consider and be informed on the upcoming Council agenda.”\n\nIn other words, people supposed to make decisions in the public interest are caucusing with unions before they make them.\n\nWhile they have to resign any union executive positions before accepting council seats, I can tell you the OCT’s “working teachers” are usually people who have been very active in senior union roles. Some haven’t taught for years. Why would anyone believe those connections die the moment they hit the council floor?\n\nAmong the decisions council members make is who will go on the college’s committees, including its disciplinary ones.\n\nThe OCT’s current discipline committee chair is Darlene Mead, with union executive experience, who has described herself as “a strong advocate for teachers.” Former college registrars Joe Atkinson and Margaret Wilson (both former union activists) noted publicly in 2006 that union members on council caucused even then before meetings and “decide as a bloc in advance how they will vote on issues.” But caucusing wasn’t the word the OCT’s council chair Liz Papadopoulos used when I spoke to her about LeSage’s concern.\n\nInstead, Papadopoulos, herself with a healthy history of union executive positions, told me council members do meet with unions before council meetings, but it’s only for “information-sharing,” and no different than meeting with other education “stakeholders.” Nevertheless, LeSage states, “those optics do nothing to enhance the independence of the … committees that I have been asked to review,” that it compromises public confidence and committee members must “distance themselves from the unions” because the teachers they are to judge are nearly all represented by union-paid lawyers.\n\nPapadopoulos says she thinks “through transparency” the college’s council will prove it can act independent of unions.\n\nBut if it can’t?\n\nThen we have a college incapable of fulfilling its mandate — and it should be shut down.\n\nConsidering unions never wanted the OCT in the first place, that should make them happy.\n\nAnd the public interest will be no further ahead, or behind."
