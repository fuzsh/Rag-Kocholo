        "text": "Download and install\n\nTo use the UFRaw Gimp plug-in you need first to install Gimp 2.0 or higher. Gimp 2.4 is recommended. If you only plan to use UFRaw's stand-alone tool, there is no need to install Gimp, but the Gimp Tool Kit (GTK+2) is still needed. There is no need to install DCRaw itself since its code is incorporated into UFRaw.\n\nLinux and other Unix compatible systems\n\nThere are UFRaw packages for several distributions:\n\nIt sometimes takes time until these packages are updated. If you want the latest and greatest version of UFRaw you'll might have to build it yourself.\n\nTo build UFRaw yourself you can either read the detailed instructions below or just download it and get the shorter version in the README file.\n\nI'm using Debian GNU/Linux on a Pentium machine, but UFRaw can be built on different Unix flavors and many different architectures. Let me know if your system is not supported for some reason.\n\nThe following development packages are relevant for building UFRaw:\n\nThe Gimp Tool Kit, GTK+2 (libgtk2.0>=2.6).\n\nFor color management you need Little CMS (liblcms>=1.13).\n\nTo build the Gimp plug-in you need Gimp (gimp>=2.0).\n\nTo build the Cinepaint plug-in you need Cinepaint (cinepaint>=0.22).\n\nlibtiff is required to create TIFF images.\n\nlibjpeg is required to create JPEG images.\n\nlibpng is required to create PNG images.\n\nlibcfitsio3 is required to create FITS images.\n\nExiv2 is required for EXIF support (does not support all camera models) (libexiv2>=0.11).\n\nTo read gzipped raw files you need zlib.\n\nTo read bzipped raw files you need libbz2.\n\nTo be able to scroll the preview window you need GtkImageView (libgtkimageview>=1.3).\n\nlensfun is required to apply lens correction. This option is experimental. Enable with ./configure --with-lensfun. Read this before using it.\n\nOnly gtk+2.0 and liblcms are required. The others are optional, their relevant features will be enabled if they are found during configuration. In Debian you can get these packages with the command (requires root privelege):\n\napt-get install libgtk2.0-dev liblcms-dev libgimp2.0-dev libtiff-dev libjpeg62-dev libpng12-dev libexiv2-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libgtkimageview-dev\n\nThe libgtkimageview-dev package only exists in Debian testing and unstable. For cinepaint 0.22 there is no Debian package at the moment.\n\nNow, you can download the UFRaw tarball ufraw-0.22.tar.gz, extract the files from it and enter the ufraw-0.22 directory:\n\ntar xzf ufraw-0.22.tar.gz cd ufraw-0.22\n\nNext, you should run the configuration script:\n\n./configure\n\nYou will get a long output and at the end there will be a summary that should look approximately like:\n\nconfigure: ====================== summary ===================== configure: build GIMP plug-in: yes configure: build CinePaint plug-in: yes configure: EXIF support using exiv2: yes configure: JPEG support: yes configure: PNG support: yes configure: FITS support: no configure: TIFF support: yes configure: gzip compressed raw support: yes configure: bzip2 compressed raw support: yes configure: Scrolling in preview using GtkImageView: yes configure: Lens defects correction via lensfun: no\n\nThere are also UFRaw specific flags for configure:\n\n--enable-mime - install mime files, see README for more information\n\n--enable-extras - build extra (dcraw, nikon-curve) executables\n\n--enable-dst-correction - enable DST correction for file timestamps.\n\n--enable-contrast - enable the contrast setting option.\n\n--enable-interp-none: enable 'None' interpolation (mostly for debugging).\n\n--with-lensfun: use the lensfun library - experimental feature, read this before using it.\n\n--with-prefix=PREFIX - use also PREFIX as an input prefix for the build\n\n--with-dosprefix=PREFIX - PREFIX in the the prefix in dos format (needed only for ms-windows)\n\nNext, you should build UFRaw by typing the command:\n\nmake\n\nFor installing the UFRaw Gimp plug-in, you have two options. You can install it only for the current user, which does not require root privileges, but only the current user will see the plug-in\n\ngimp-tool --install-bin ufraw-gimp\n\nor you can make a system wide installation (requires root privileges)\n\nmake install\n\nThis will also install the stand-alone tools ufraw, ufraw-batch and some related files (man page, icon and desktop definitions).\n\nMacintosh\n\nOne option is to use the UFRaw package from Darwin ports or Mac ports.\n\nIf you use the GIMP on OS X application bundle, then the UFRaw plug-in is already bundled with Gimp. As far as I know the stand-alone version of UFRaw is not included.\n\nAnother option is the point & click installer for the UFRaw-0.9.1 GIMP plug-in. It was designed for the GimpShop, but might also work with the standard Gimp.\n\nA more recent option is this native Mac OS X version of UFRaw\n\nMac OS X is in principle just another Unix flavor based on FreeBSD. I have no experience working with the Mac, but I was reported that UFRaw can be built on the Mac OS X using the Fink package manager. Just follow the Unix instruction where your configuration command should look like\n\n./configure --prefix=/sw --with-prefix=/sw\n\nMS-Windows\n\nFor MS-Windows users I have two installation versions. The \"for dummies\" version where you only need to download and run an installer and the \"for geeks\" version if you want to build the plug-in yourself.\n\nI'm not a big fan of this operating system, so why does it get such special attention? UFRaw is a free software (as in free speech, not as in free beer). In this spirit I try to give the users the freedom to use it in any environment, even in environments like MS-Windows that try to take your freedom away by imposing proprietary standards on you. You are encouraged to use other free software like Gimp for editing your images, Firefox for surfing the net (in fact Firefox renders this page better), and LibreOffice for an office suite.\n\nAnother reason is that building UFRaw on MS-Windows is a bit tricky and not very convenient (did I say already that I don't like this operating system). I actually create the MS version of UFRaw in a Linux environment, but I guess that most of the users of the MS version don't have access to Linux, otherwise they would not need the MS version.\n\nMS-Windows for dummies\n\nUFRaw is now a stand-alone application (it used to depend on Gimp). You just need to download and run this.\n\nThe upside of UFRaw being a stand-alnoe installation is that it should work more reliably, without the DLL issues that many users had.\n\nOne downside is that the installer is much bigger (9MB) and requires much more disk space (53MB).\n\nAnother downside is that there is no GIMP plug-in. You only get a the stand-alone version of UFRaw. A plug-in executable (ufraw-gimp.exe) is included, but it does not function. It will not work with GIMP-2.8. There might be a way to get it to work with GIMP-2.6, but I did not try.\n\nMS-Windows for geeks\n\nI build UFRaw using a cross-compiler in Linux. It is also be possible to build UFRaw in the Cygwin environment, which imitates the Unix environment on MS-Windows. After setting up the environment and installing all the required packages the installation procedure is the same as for Unix. If you want to compile UFRaw in another environment or with a different compiler then you are on your own.\n\nI use the Debian package mingw32 for cross compiling.\n\nFor the MSYS environment you should install the packages msys, mingw-runtime, w32api, binutils and gcc from the MinGW site.\n\nCygwin can be installed by downloading and running the installation program setup.exe. In addition to the default packages installed, you will also need the following packages, which you can find in the Devel category in the setup:\n\ngcc: C compiler\n\nmake: The GNU version of the 'make' utility\n\npkgconfig: A utility used to retrieve information about installed libraries\n\nYou can build a native Cygwin binary of UFRaw using the developement packages from Cygwin ports, or you can use Cygwin to cross build a MinGW32 binary.\n\nYou will need the following development packages:\n\ngimp-dev (at least version 2.2)\n\ngtk+-dev (at least version 2.6)\n\nglib-dev\n\npango-dev\n\natk\n\ngettext\n\nlibiconvi\n\nliblcms (at least version 1.13)\n\nlibjpeg\n\nlibtiff\n\nlibpng\n\nzlib\n\nlibbz2\n\nexiv2 (at list version 0.11)\n\ngtkimageview (at list version 1.3)\n\nMost packages can be downloaded from Tor Lillqvist Gimp Windows port or from the GnuWin32 project. The Gimp development package is here. Other packages you might have to build yourself.\n\nExtract all these files under one directory, for example c:\\mingw32. In Linux I use the directory /opt/mingw32. Notice that all these libraries are not for Cygwin but for MinGW32. This is because they are used to cross build UFRaw on MinGW32.\n\npkg-config behaves differently under MinGW32. Therefore, if you are cross compling, you will have to modify all the *.pc files that come with the different packages. The following script should do the trick (after updating TARGET to your needs):\n\nTARGET=/opt/mingw32 for f in $TARGET/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc ; do cat $f | sed s+^prefix=.*+prefix=$TARGET+ > $f.tmp mv $f.tmp $f done\n\nAt this point you should start following the installation instructions for Unix users. In Debian you will need the following configuration command:\n\n./configure --with-prefix=/opt/mingw32 --with-dosprefix=z:\\\\opt\\\\mingw32 --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i386-linux\n\nIn Cygwin you will need the following configuration command:\n\n./configure -with-prefix=/cygdrive/c/mingw32 --with-dosprefix=c:\\\\mingw32 --host=i686-mingw32msvc --target=i686-mingw32msvc --build=i686-cygwin"
