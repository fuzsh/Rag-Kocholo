        "text": "Desktop Environments available in Hyperbola Linux\n\nWe have seen that it is possible to start with a Display Manager and add\n\nfeatures so that it begins to look like a primitive DE. That is one approach,\n\nthe other is to look for a dropin fully configured DE.\n\nUnfortunately Hyperbola will not run any of the well known DE’s, because they use\n\npackages like dbus which Hyperbola philosophy does not approve.\n\nThere is, however, one DE which avoides all of the hyperbola-banned packages,\n\nbecause it is totally written in C++ and has no dependencies.\n\nA package with no dependencies can be run on any Linux distro, or even on BSD or Windows.\n\nLumina is not fully developed. It is not a dropin solution. However,\n\nit is worth exploring whether Lumina can form the starting point for\n\nsetting up a respectable DE for Hyperbola\n\nGetting Lumina\n\nI have used Lumina previously. It is available in Void Linux, and there is\n\na report\n\nof my installing and using it in Void Linux.\n\nIf you look at that report you will see that some of the\n\ninhouse applications which come with Lumina are really\n\nonly place-makers, ie they are under development.\n\nOthers , like the Insight File Manager are usable.\n\nHowever , one can always add other applications.\n\nThe main thing about Lumina is that it is fully\n\nconfigurable from the GUI… it can be made to look like\n\nany of the main DE’s in terms of placement of panels,\n\nplacement of system tray, icons, and plasmids.\n\nAppearance (themes etc) is also fully configurable.\n\nIt is Qt based so windowns have a Qt appearance.\n\nThe version of Lumina available in Void is 1.6.2.\n\nOne way of getting Lumina would be to use Void to download the source code and\n\nthen compile and install it in Hyperbola. That is one of the advantages of a package with no dependencies… it can be moved anywhere.\n\nLumina also has its own website\n\nand it points to where the sources are kept, in a Github repository\n\nso that is another way to get Lumina.\n\nHowever Hyperbola has Lumina in its own repository. It is version 1.6.0., slightly older , but we shall try with this binary install first, simply because it is easier.\n\nInstalling Lumina in Hyperbola\n\nFirst have a look at what packages are available\n\n$ pacman -Ss lumina extra/lumina-archiver 1.6.0-5 (lumina-extra) Lumina Desktop Environment - Archive Manager extra/lumina-core 1.6.0-5 (lumina) Lumina Desktop Environment - Core Components extra/lumina-core-utils 1.6.0-5 (lumina) Lumina Desktop Environment - Core Utilities extra/lumina-fileinfo 1.6.0-5 (lumina-extra) Lumina Desktop Environment - File Information Utility extra/lumina-fm 1.6.0-5 (lumina-extra) Lumina Desktop Environment - File Manager extra/lumina-mediaplayer 1.6.0-5 (lumina-extra) Lumina Desktop Environment - Streaming Media Player extra/lumina-photo 1.6.0-5 (lumina-extra) Lumina Desktop Environment - Image Viewer extra/lumina-screenshot 1.6.0-5 (lumina-extra) Lumina Desktop Environment - Screenshot Utility extra/lumina-textedit 1.6.0-5 (lumina-extra) Lumina Desktop Environment - Plaintext Editor\n\nThe base package is lumina-core but we shall install all of the above\n\nin order to get as full a starting point as possible, so as superuser\n\npacman -S lumina-core lumina-core-utils pacman -S lumina-archiver lumina-fileinfo lumina-fm lumina-mediaplayer pacman -S lumina-photo lumina-screenshot lumina-textedit\n\nThat is all there is to it, we just need to activate\n\nexec start-lumina-desktop in .xinitrc and startx will start it.\n\nThe default startup screen looks as follows\n\nBattleship grey without trimmings. All it has is a tiny menu\n\nbutton at the left of the black system tray at the bottom, and and RSS feed\n\nplasmid at the bottom right. It needs a bit of work.\n\nAdding things to the default lumina desktop\n\nLets see if we can get a better background, and we need a terminal window\n\nto do things.\n\nWe need to add Xterm before we start the DE, so, on the alphanumeric screen after\n\nlogin we do\n\npacman -S xterm\n\nand then startx to start the DE.\n\nThere is a menu for setting the Display Wallpaper.\n\nRight click on background, then Preferences,\n\nthen Desktop Settings, and you get the Desktop Settings Menu\n\nWe can see the Wallpaper button on the top right, plus there are\n\nbuttons to configure Panels, Themes, Default Applications, etc.\n\nLumina is fully configurable via the GUI… one does not need to edit config files.\n\nNow click on Wallpaper, then ‘+’, then choose Solid Color in the dropdoewn menu,\n\nand you get a Select Color menu\n\nI have setup a dark red color rgb(40,0,10) because a dark background is best for night work.\n\nClick OK, and you have it. The other options under ‘+’ allow Files or Directories containing images\n\nto be used for background. So you can have a scene or whatever. We shall look at that later\n\nSo what does it now look like? I started Xterm and some menues,\n\nand changed the plasmid to a load monitor, and we get\n\nSome other icons apart from Xterm have appeared, because I already have some\n\napps installed from the work on display Managers. In Lumina, most apps bring up their\n\ndesktop icon automatically… so we have Iceweasel-UXP browser, but\n\nDillo did not bring up an icon. The Insight File Manager is Lumina’s own File Manager,\n\nand is about the only one of Lumina’s inbuilt packages that is\n\nreasonably functional. You can also see the SpaceFM File Manager,\n\nthe gthumb image viewer, and MuPDF pdf viewer.\n\nMy Xterm is configured by its .Xdefaults file in my home dirtectory.\n\nThat sets the color ( again dark) and the right scrollbar.\n\nThe menus show choosing preferences → Desktop Settings, as described above.\n\nNote the system tray is at the bottom ( it can be moved) and there are no\n\nother panels at present. The white panel at the top is virt-manager.\n\nAdding more applications\n\nThe way to use Lumina is to discard all its half-developed inbuilt apps, and install your own. That is easy in a normal distro, but in Hyperbola there is a limited range of available apps.\n\nI have tried to gather apps covering things most users would require\n\nin order to show what sort of DE can be built in Hyperbola.\n\nWeb Browser\n\nTe best available is iceweasel-uxp. The UXP stands for Unified XUL PLatform. XUL is a markup language , developed by Mozila for writing GUI’s Firefox used to use XUL, but today it is used by Pale Moon browser and by Hyperbola.\n\nIceweasel is quite competent. It has tabs, bookmarks, and a menu shown below\n\nIt displays the itsfoss.com site properly, but when you go to the Forum , it says\n\n“your browser is unsupported”, and some things are missing, for example a scrollbar.\n\nActually the Forum site is a good test of browsers. Discourse has stringent requirements.\n\nThe available search engines are somewhat restrictive\n\nNone of the major search engines are available, the best seems to be the default SearX. What you can do is load the google ( or whatever) page, then use it to search. It seems to deal with google search results quite well, and if you access the itsFOSS Forum page via a google search, it formats normally?\n\nWhy accessing a page via a google search would change the\n\nbrowser’s ability to display it, is beyond me?\n\nHowever that is clearly the way to make iceweasel-uxp\n\nuseable.\n\nGiven those shortcomings, lets have a look at Dillo\n\nDillo does not have a search engine at all. What you must do is load the google ( or whatever) page. Dillo will display the google search page, but it seems to have difficulty with most websites. It is plainly out of date.\n\nMailer\n\nThe choice is icedove-uxp or a simple text based mailer like mutt\n\nIcedove-uxp looks just like Thunderbird.\n\nSo I setup my email and tried it\n\nNo issues there.\n\nFile Manager\n\nThere is the inbuilt Lumina filemanager called Insight\n\nIt is about the only reasonably usable Lumina App.\n\nA better option is SpaceFM, which we have already covered in the topic\n\n“Getting X windows into Hyperbola”.\n\nPDF Viewer\n\nThe best available is MuPDF. It comes in two varieties mupdf and mupdf-gl.\n\nThe latter is best choice, it uses OpenGL. There is also a command line set of pdf tools callled mupdf-tools.\n\nYou move between pages and lines with the keyboard, therr are no mouse buttons for navigation. The graphic quality is fine, I can read that fine text in the box.\n\nImage Viewer\n\nHere we go for the old fashioned but capable gthumb viewer.\n\nHyperbola also has Gimp for image manipulation, and graphicsmagick which is an ImageMagick substitute.\n\nOffice\n\nHyperbola has LibreOffice… the full set calc, draw, math, base, impress, and writer.\n\nNo issues there, it is as good as any distro can provide.\n\nIcons and Panels\n\nIn most cases, when you install a new package, Lumina automatically brings up an icon on the DE background. There has to be a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications, and in some cases there will be a link in ~/Desktop.\n\nThe package MuPDF came with a .desktop file but it had the line\n\nNoDisplay=true\n\nwhich I had to change to\n\nNoDisplay=false\n\nto get an icon.\n\nIf there are preinstalled apps, when Lumina is installed, it detects them and makes the icon. I already had Xterm, iceweasel-uxp, and SpaceFM when I installed Lumina.\n\nSo after all the above installs, and a few others, the DE looks as follows\n\nWe have a clutter of icons on the background. The Xterm is as before. We have 2 panels, a bottom panel which is the system tray, and a popdown upper panel ( you can just see one line of it at centre top) which has the workspace switcher and some launchers for Lumina apps. At the lower right I have replaced the RSS feed plasmid with a notepad.\n\nTo tidy it up and to show setting up of a panel we are going to move all the LibreOffice icons to a panel on the right. So Preferences → Desktop Settings → Panels, and we get the panel setup window\n\nWe see 2 panels, which reflects the current setup. Each panel has been set to show the panel content (the right hand button) . The other 2 buttons set its position and properties.\n\nTo make a new (third) panel we click + at the top left, and it opens a third panel subwindow.\n\nWe have set it to appear on the right. We now add the content\n\nand delete all the LibreOffice Icons, reduce the size of the remaining icons and we have a new DE\n\nWe have all the LibreOffice icons in the right panel,\n\nthey do not have colors, but they produce a popup\n\ndescription when you hover the mouse pointer\n\nThat is not perfect, but it seems this is a limitation of\n\nVersion 1.6.0 of Lumina. In the later version 1.6.2\n\n( which I have in Void Linux) one can get coloured icons\n\nin a panel. For example, from my Void/Lumina1.6.2 DE\n\nOne still gets symbols, rather than icons, but they are coloured in Lumina 1.6.2\n\nThe remainder of the DE is OK. The upper autohide launcher panel works, again it does not have coloured icons. The lower system tray could be a better colour. The smaller remaining icons are cleaner.\n\nA better load monitor\n\nI installed Conky. It is much better than the inbuilt Lumina\n\nmonitor widget\n\nI made the right panel autohide, to keep it out of the way,\n\nand changed the panel colour.There are a number of background widgets available\n\nwith Conky, the one shown is a system summary.\n\nOther apps\n\nYou can see icons for\n\nDia diagram constructing program\n\nGalculator scientific calculator\n\nScribus desktop publishing program\n\nGetting a login screen\n\nI am quite happy to login on an alphanumeric screen, and start the window system with startx and .xinitrc.\n\nSome people prefer a Login Manager (also called Display Manager).\n\nThe choice in Hyperbola is SLiM, or wdm (an xdm fork).\n\nI tried wdm, it simply would not work. The daemon would not start when setup with\n\nrc-update add wdm , and starting it by hand produced no error messages. I gave up on wdm.\n\nWe will try SLiM\n\npacman -S slim resolving dependencies... looking for conflicting packages...

(1/1) Displaying hyperrc service help ... ==> Add a service to runlevel: rc-update add <service> <runlevel> sh-5.1# rc-update add slim * service slim added to runlevel default\n\nReboot and we get a login screen\n\nThat is the default SLiM screen. It just has a login slot, no options to start the various Display Managers or Lumina?\n\nThis version of slim seems to have a problem . When it is running , one can not logout from Lumina with the GUI buttons… even Power Off only results in a return to the Slim login manager screen. The only way to power off seems to be to use\n\nsync halt\n\nas superuser.\n\nAfter reading everything I could find on SLiM ,\n\nI discovered that what I thought was a problem,\n\nwas actually a feature.\n\nNo matter how you exit any Window Manager or DE,\n\nif SLiM is running, it always returns you to the SLiM\n\nlogin screen. From there you have the following options\n\nwhich can be typed into the Username box, followed by\n\nthe root password in the Password box\n\nconsole - launch a terminal\n\nhalt - does a shutdown\n\nreboot - does a reboot\n\nexit - exits to a bash shell\n\nsuspend - suspends linux\n\nso SLiM takes over what is normally done with the poweroff buttons in a DE.\n\nOK, I think I can get used to that. It is what one would want on a multiuser computer, where only root should be able to do a shutdown.\n\nI also discovered that SLiM does have options to choose a Window Manager or DE on its login screen. You have to hit ‘F1’ key to display and step thru them.\n\nThis only works if have setup the file $HOME/.xinitrc properly.\n\nI found the following example .xinitrc on the Arch Wiki link listed below,\n\nand modified it to include a default ( ie if you do not press F1),\n\nHere is my modified .xinitrc file\n\n#!/bin/sh DEFAULT_SESSION=start-lumina-desktop if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ] ; then for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/?*.sh ; do [ -x \"$f\" ] && . \"$f\" done unset f fi if [ -z $1 ] ; then exec $DEFAULT_SESSION else exec $1 fi\n\nWith that setup I could choose to start any of\n\nfluxbox lumina’s window manager\n\nicewm starts icewm on login screen\n\nicewm-session normal icewm X window manager\n\nfvwm3 latest version of fvwm window manager\n\nlumina desktop environment\n\nwindowmaker Unix NeXTSTEP environment\n\nThere a couple of things there that I did not deliberately install but were dragged in by other packages, for example Lumina uses Fluxbox.\n\nThere is also the file /etc/slim.conf. I made some minor changes there.\n\nSLiM in Hyperbola comes only with the default theme. The default theme is in /usr/share/slim/themes/default. You can change the background putting a file background.png or background.jpg in that directory.\n\nI had one attempt at making a custom login screen\n\nOne could improve on that. I spent more time on the login screen, than on the whole DE.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe aim was to show that one can build a workable desktop in Hyperbola, starting from Lumina DE and adding what one needs.\n\nI think we have gone close to achieving that aim. There are enough apps available to\n\nbuild a a working setup and Lumina has sufficient configurability .\n\nIt would have been better to have started with\n\na later version of Lumina.\n\nThe login screen is workable, but SLiM took a lot of effort to configure.\n\nThe Lumina DE can be made as good as any of the major DE’s;\n\nits configuration GUI is first class,\n\nbut its inbuilt apps need work.\n\nThat is not critical, because you can replace them with\n\nother apps.\n\nThere are sufficient apps in the repositary to build a usable Office or Graphics DE. Dont know about sound or video.\n\nThe key point is that Hyperbola really does demonstrate that one can discard much of the bloatware that has crept into Linux, and still have a working system.\n\nLinks\n\n… official website\n\n… wikipedia\n\nhttps://fossbytes.com/lumina-1-2-desktop-download-features\n\n… link has disappeared\n\n… details on plugins\n\n… all the docs\n\n… NJ’ Void/Lumina report\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SLiM\n\n… Arch wiki on SLiM"
