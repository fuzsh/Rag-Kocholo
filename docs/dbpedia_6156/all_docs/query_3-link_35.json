        "text": "sobersick I have been using Linux for over 10 years because it suits my lifestyle but I can't see it ever replacing Windows. I love the fact that I don't need to run any of the Security Suite options that are compulsory with Windows, but then I also miss many of the options that are available with Windows - games, any Office app, etc. I am fortunate in that I have a very adequate laptop that I am able to use on the rare occasions I require those options.\n\nYour biggest problem will be if you decide to go to Linux what will your choice of Linux distribution be? If you Google \"How to choose a Linux OS?\" there are 37 million choices. It's a nightmare. I tried about 5 before settling on an OS [Linux Mint] but lately, even after 8 years, it's starting to go off the rails and I am seriously debating a change.\n\nsobersick as you can see, recommendations come in all forms and flavors. If you want more specific advice, I recommend you tell us more about what you do on your desktop and what you want to protect.\n\npit2p And yes graphenos on desktop would be very nice surprise!\n\nIt's already there, at least in Beta on Gen 8 Pixel devices. The forum user OutlawSanZhang made an extensive guide here if you want to try it. I'll personally wait until it's out of Beta. There will probably be more devices to choose from by then (Pixel Tablet 2, Pixel 9 etc).\n\nsobersick It always becomes a questions of convenience vs. security and what your expected threat model is.\n\nWindows can be made substantially more secure than it is \"out of the box\" by adjusting various settings and services. Unless you require those services for work or other use.\n\nLinux is my go-to default desktop/laptop OS, and it too can be hardened pretty quickly & easily over what most distros offer as stock out of the box. If you want to run a website from your own computer, one of the *BSD's is likely the way to go. If you want to have one of the best protections for your entire home network, dedicate an old desktop to run PFSense or one of the similar firewalls. This last option takes some work, but can be incredibly effective, and - depending on your configuration - can offer feature parity with commercial grade firewall gear from Cisco.\n\nIt is an interesting question indeed. As an exclusive GNU/Linux user since almost 2003 and an active developer on a lot of Linux projects, given the current state of Desktop operating systems (Both Linux and many BSD's (even OpenBSD)) and driver/ firmware support both on a software and hardware level. Here's my take on this. There is no Desktop Operating system that can match the security aspects of most mobile Operating Systems like Android that Graphene takes advantage of by making modifications. But if moderate security is your priority. Here it goes. The most Secure Desktop/Laptop operating system would be to run ChromeOS on an official Chrome Book. That's it. Plain and simple. But if additional privacy benefits are your domain. I would suggest you to run Qubes if you have the memory to spare, but otherwise look for somewhat secure and immutable distros like Fedora Silverblue (Or any of its Immutable Spins) or OpenSUSE Microos. Those are really great options right now, if you keep them updated regularly, stick to using Wayland and keep the attack surface at minimal.\n\nlongshots but then I also miss many of the options that are available with Windows - games, any Office app, etc.\n\nI have great news: Ever since the Steam Deck became popular, gaming on Linux is pretty much no problem and sometimes even more performant due to the Proton translation layer hitting less on the game's performance than a bloated Windows. You might want to look into Nobara, Bazzite vor HoloISO (or just install Fedora and add the gaming components such as Steam and GPU drivers). Over 80% of games work already on Linux, many of them better than anywhere else (especially classic titles and emulation).\n\nAs for Office, LibreOffice is usual the default choice. If you need the best Microsoft Office compatibility, I recommend OnlyOffice. And of course there's always Google Docs, Sheets and Slides if you need seamless interoperability for every OS.\n\nThere are still a lot of inconveniences when it comes to Linux, like video editing for example. But on the other hand there is excellent software that works best on Linux, like LibreWolf or GIMP. In the end everyone needs to find their best answer. What I personally like most about Linux is the control and ownership I have compared to MacOS, ChromeOS and Windows.\n\nlongshots Your biggest problem will be if you decide to go to Linux what will your choice of Linux distribution be?\n\nNot really... Are there thousands of choices? Yes, but if security and privacy are your main concerns (which is quite common on this forum), the same few distributions are recommended. But why would the freedom to choose the best OS for your individual needs be a problem? Microsoft, Google and Apple give us exactly one choice, and for most people that choice can't be ideal as we are all vastly different. And it doesn't help that all of these 3 include data harvesting that is impossible to fully escape..."
