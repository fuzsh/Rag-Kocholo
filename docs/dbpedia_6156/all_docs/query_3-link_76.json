        "text": "I have a pal who is currently running W98. Surprise, surprise, when he really \"works it\", he induces BSOD's, lock-ups, etc. He finds this annoying.<P>So . . .<P>He figures the answer is to install Win2k Pro. This does NOT strike me as a *bad* choice.<P>But . . .<P>I am trying to talk him into installing RH7. He is a bit skeptical (a healthy thing, I think), and wants SOLID reasons to go the RH7 route.<P>I must confess, the list I came up with is rather short -<P>1. It's free. This fact does not impress him. He is willing to spend $'s for a solid OS.<P>2. Stability. This factor (I think) is no longer as valid as it once was. Win2K, from what I have read/heard is actually pretty stable, light years ahead of W9x, and much, much better that NT4 was/is.<P>3. MS does not make it. Alas, he does not believe<BR>that Bill Gates is the anti-Christ, so this point is invalid in his eyes.<P>If anybody can come up with any SOLID reasons for me to hit him with, don't be shy.\n\na) The \"it's free part\" is relevant for the whole free speech thing too. If he's a coder, he can freely view and hack on the code. If he's not a coder, the price of win2k isn't just the OS, but all the apps too. You have to pay extra for IIS, Visual C++, etc, (as opposed to apache, or g++). most programs are totally free on Linux. There's a whole truckload of free stuff on freshmeat.<P>b) remote access. With both remote X access and remote command line access, linux is the bomb at this. I love to be able to log into my home machine (which is actually OpenBSD right now) from work and screw around with stuff there. I don't know diddly about terminal server for Win2k, but it's a new feature and probably a bit rough. The command line on win2k really sucks in comparison. I've done alot to tweak it (added tab completion and installed PPT), but I hate getting errors like \"Input line too long\" whenever I use find and xargs on Win2k.<P>c) It networks like a beast. If you ever need to talk to other computers, linux is positively promiscuous. I've installed Netatalk to talk AppleTalk with macs, Samba for the Network Neighborhood (just like Mr. Rogers), MarsNWE to serve up Novell Netware shares, mail servers, web servers, you name it. There isn't a TCP/IP protocol that Linux doesn't handle well. I love having a network where my girlfriend's powerbook can plug in with my Windoze gaming machine, with linux mediating and sharing stuff to all.<P>d) the command line is fast. it takes time to get used to it. it gets slammed all the time. but I really like being able to string sophisticated and complicated queries together and have my computer update hundreds of files for me, without having to hack up some script, or do stuff manually. I can still do things way faster with a CLI than with a WIMP.<P>e) tons of great development tools. While developing for the MS world requires an MS box, if you are developing for the web, or for yourself, linux has tons of good support for this. I really like having a perl interpreter and a C compiler all set up for me out of the box. I routinely toss together scripts that do moderately complicated stuff for me on a routine basis. There are tools to do this in the MS world but they cost $$$ and do not tend to be as flexible.<P>f) support. This is an area where linux gets slammed by the marketing types, but my personal experience has been *way* better by going online and asking for help than by sitting on the phone to some ?real? company. Linux folks are some of the most helpful folks around. They are generally willing to help you out and walk you through any sort of problem usually within a few hours. While phone tech support might get it fixed in roughly the same time, you had to stay on hold for all of those hours, rather than firin' off your query and playing quake while you wait for a response. also, security holes and bugfixes are usually posted in a few hours to a few days, rather than a few months that are the standard for the MS world.<P>g) virtual destops. I can't stress enough how much these rock. When you don't have em, you don't realize you need em, when you do have em, it makes you weep to give them up.<P>--sam<P>[This message was edited by petrov on October 09, 2000 at 13:52.]\n\na couple of things to add:<BR>- i wouldn't start off with rh7; redhat is pretty notorious for releasing a fairly unstable product up until their *.1 or *.2 release. i'd stick with 6.2 for now, if he goes the rh route. for beginners, i would usually suggest mandrake...<P>- i really wish people would stop saying 'linux is free'. free is what you make of it...linux is only free if your time isn't worth anything, particularly as a beginner. sure, the os doesn't cost any money, and it'll teach you more than you probably ever thought you could stuff in your head in a couple days time. but if you don't have the time to spend with it (if you're a beginner), learning all its lovable quirks and ways, then you'll drop it faster than a piano falling from the sky.<P>- i've seen it happen time after time. a serious operating system (i'm not really talking about win 9x here) is about as stable as the administrator makes it. i've seen linux boxes that crash quite often, and i've seen win2k (not so much nt4.0) boxes that rarely crash. if stable is a priority, and he's not willing to take the time to really learn what it takes to keep his linux box happy, then he oughta stick with something he's familiar with (though moving from win 9x to win2k can be less familiar territory than some people would think).<P>- it really depends on what he plans on doing with his machine. if games and multimedia are a huge deal to him, he should probably stick with a ms os for the time being. if he'd rather network with other computers, or run web or ftp services or do software development (sure you can do it effectively with windows, but it's better to learn the *nix way), he oughta make a switch to a *nix."
