        "text": "And once again, all of Photrio was plunged into war.\n\nI think this is quite the exaggeration. I can understand that people will have different software experiences or preferences. Many years ago, I got the urge to explore and try something different, installed a Linux-based operating system on the desktop workstation and have never turned back. I enjoy the flexibility and options that Linux provides. I have used many of the various Linux and BSD distributions on the desktop and server over the years and like to sometimes take the opportunity to promote the options available. Someone might discover something they really enjoy and some of the open-source software can also be used on other operating systems.\n\nThe last few years I have been using Devuan Linux on the desktop and OpenBSD on the server. But for a few extra things available on Linux, I could almost use OpenBSD for everything. I really like the way the OpenBSD system operates and find their in-house software like smtpd and httpd great on the server. I like old-school systems, but that still provide comfortable functionality, and this kind of experience is something that is almost exclusively available nowadays on certain of the Linux and BSD distributions. I have spent a lot of time in the Xfce desktop environment, but currently prefer MATE desktop environment.\n\nWhile some people will still have other preferences, I think many are not aware of the quality of offerings in open-source software. And this, along with the enjoyment and functionality I have gotten from them, is another reason I sometimes like to make the case for them. I think the growing functionality of the open-source graphics software, like some of the programs discussed in this thread, is something many can appreciate.\n\nI have not used this software to be able to report any direct experience or recommendations. How exactly is the software different from the Windows version? What options are you missing? I don't know if using the film holders activates any additional options in the software, but maybe--although, I don't see any reference to that in the manuals.\n\nDo you have the features and settings indicated in the manuals? Have you tried the Image Scan! software instead, to see if it has the features you want? It looks like Image Scan! can also be used through GIMP via a plugin that it installs, if you want to try it in there. I think the Image Scan! software is in the \"All-in-one package\".\n\nEpson Scan 2 Manual\n\nImage Scan! for Linux Manual\n\nDriver and software downloads can be made through here:\n\nEpson Download Center - Download drivers and software\n\nAbout UI. Not entirely. Software developers can run A/B tests and record various timings, number of mouse clicks, etc.\n\nSpeaking for myself only, I find a lot of Linux UI work and a lot of Linux programs as suffering from Windows Derangement Syndrome or maybe Windows envy. Sure most Linux software is free, but my time and productivity aren't.\n\nYes, I guess I can see this. Although, someone might still prefer an interface overall that is technically less efficient--but I suppose no one is going to want to have to do too many extra mouse clicks.\n\nOne nice thing about the open-source software is that it is often very customizable in interface and keyboard shortcuts, such that you can usually get something configured that will work pretty well for you.\n\nFor image processing (not editing), Darktable is actually rather good. I would rather process my infrared images in Darktable than any other package, as color calibration Just Works. It's also available on Windows if you want to try it-- the interface is very non-intuitive for the first few minutes, but then you realize that all the plugins have a consistent feel / operation.\n\nFor actual editing, I decided I'd rather have a permanent lease than rent-to-own, so I switched to Affinity on Windows. As for Gimp, it is NOT a subjective statement that the UI sucks-- just some people have gotten used to it. I use (and like) emacs, but I'm not crazy enough to say it has a good interface.\n\nWhat is wrong with the GIMP user interface?\n\nHaving spent time in Photoshop, Darktable, Affinity Photo, Krita and Gimp, I can easily say it's the least intuitive. Having the tools panel be a separate floating window (by default), that has to be opened manually, is not intuitive. Ctrl-B is not an unreasonable shortcut, but it's not my first choice.\n\nSince the toolbox is a separate window, it can get misplaced under other windows. If you know to switch to single-window mode, it's better, but now you have to resize the toolbox by hand.\n\nDon't get me wrong-- first, it's better than it used to be, and secondly, all of these things are things you can get used to, and once you're used to it, you can be quite proficient. But the same was said of WordStar and Blender.\n\nIt's obvious that the GIMP interface is driven by function, rather than UI usability, and it's been like that for a very long time.\n\nWhat is wrong with the GIMP user interface?\n\nExample: draw a simple, straight line.\n\nThe Photoshop way: select the 'Line' tool. Draw line.\n\nThe GIMP way: Select the paintbrush tool. Now hold down the Shift-key and place one point, then another.\n\nIt sounds so simple in both systems, except that the Photoshop way is a matter of ogling the toolkit, spotting the line tool (which has a clear icon that's hard to misinterpret) and clicking it. In GIMP, you have to either accidentally stumble on the paintbrush tool (after having tried a million things) only to notice a tiny bit of text that's only visible if you've already activated the paintbrush tool at the very bottom of the screen far, far away from the toolkit or your image that tells you about the Shift trick - or you have to actually Google how to draw a damn line and follow a tutorial...\n\nIt's not that GIMP can't do it - it does it really well. It's just that like many of its great functions, it's obfuscated by its UI design.\n\nNote that in this example, even f-in' Paint in Windows is far more accessible and intuitive than GIMP. It also of course packs maybe 2% of GIMP's functionality, but what it has to offer is available in seconds to even the most impatient and dim-witted of users (i.e., me).\n\nI think he has also been able to scan his film fine directly on the glass, but the Epson Scan 2 software didn't have all of the options he expected, and he is wondering if it is simply how the software is on Linux or if using the film holder somehow would enable more options in the software.\n\nCorrect.\n\nUsed the stock negative holder, did not change anything.\n\nI also just realized there are no image options like ICE control, dust detection. Why...?\n\nThe Advance Settings just gets you to another pane, with just Flip, or Delete, and several grayed out tabs. Very curious. i asked around on a couple of Linux-oriented forums, and no clue from there, other than suggestions for other tools.\n\nEDIT: seems there is (or was) a twin piece of software called ImageSan. Am I comparing Linux EpsonScan to Windows ImageSan? Confused.\n\nHaving spent time in Photoshop, Darktable, Affinity Photo, Krita and Gimp, I can easily say it's the least intuitive.

But the same was said of WordStar and Blender.\n\nIt's obvious that the GIMP interface is driven by function, rather than UI usability, and it's been like that for a very long time.\n\nI think GIMP has been single-window mode by default for awhile now. I don't really see that resizing toolboxes by hand is any inconvenience--once you set it how you like, it stays there. Maybe I have just used GIMP for so long that I don't notice any quirks as much, but I have always been able to use it fairly comfortably. I feel like any software has its characteristics, and a lot of the biases are just what people are used to or not, hence people's different preferences.\n\nExample: draw a simple, straight line.\n\nThe Photoshop way: select the 'Line' tool.

It's just that like many of its great functions, it's obfuscated by its UI design.\n\nI usually think of GIMP for subtle edits to photographs. I have not explored the drawing or painting tools as much. But when I have drawn lines in GIMP, I have actually often done it with the Rectangle Select Tool. Click and drag to draw your line, adjust Size in the tool options, and then Edit > Fill with FG Color or Fill with BG Color. This way works pretty well for me. I guess I have also usually just expected that most software will come with a learning curve, of figuring out how things are done in it.\n\nThat works for horizontal or vertical lines. Diagonal lines...probably too, but you'd have to root around in the way the rectangle selection tool works.\n\nIt's not just drawing of lines - it's literally everywhere. Take the curves tool; Photoshop has for ages had a way to flip/invert the curve display, which can be really convenient in pos/neg workflows. Somehow, the GIMP team just never realized this. It's in the toolkit icon designs with just isn't as intuitive in GIMP as it is in Photoshop (although about a year ago a meaningful update was made). It's in how color adjustment and color management controls are spread out over various menus instead of located in close proximity. It just goes on and on and on...\n\nThe problem appears to be that GIMP just doesn't have the benefit of a dedicated team of people well versed in UI and user experience optimization, which for an open source package really isn't surprising, nor a disqualification. You really get a lot more than you pay for. But there are compromises.\n\nThat works for horizontal or vertical lines.

And as mentioned above, I have used GIMP for so long that I have probably just gotten used to some things. I also have pretty modest needs for what I want it to be able to do, and it has always been sufficient. I also only use Linux and BSD for years now, and so haven't spent time comparing with proprietary software on other operating systems--partly because, as mentioned, the open-source software has served my needs well in the way of image editing and desktop publishing."
