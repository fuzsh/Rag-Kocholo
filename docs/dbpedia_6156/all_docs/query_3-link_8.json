        "text": "Hi,\n\nI am a newbie to linux, but I want to try our a BSD flavor.\n\nBut before that, I would like to know some key differences between the two, and aside from that, how does programming a *nix (BSD) go? Are there certain things some BSD flavors can do that others can't? And why isn't BSD more well known than linux?\n\n~CastilleV\n\nI would divide it into 3 main segments:\n\n1. Kernel\n\nThe kernel is the main difference, BSD has it's kernel and to be exact Linux is a kernel(not a OS). So the core is the major difference\n\n2. Base system\n\nBSD has it's own base system with the most important binaries as cp, ls etc, while a Linux based OS is using external binaries for the same functions(usually it's the GNU versions)\n\n3. Full OS\n\nAbsolutly no difference here(with a few exceptions). A browser that works on a Linux based OS works on a *BSD OS. You can run GNOME, KDE, Firefox, Eclipse, NetBeans, Pidgin etc under both with no difference to the user. If you as a user are unaware of the base system, a *BSD based desktop system can and will function exactly like a Linux based desktop.\n\nIn short:\n\nA \"linux\" os is: Linux kernel + GNU utilities\n\nA \"bsd\" os is: bsd kernel + bsd utilites\n\nEverything else is the same.(with some exceptions for proprietary software like skype and flash).\n\nkillasmurf86 said:\n\nwhat does backport means?\n\nEssentially taking bugfixes an such and applying them to an earlier version of the same software(ie put patches for GIMP 2.6 into GIMP 2.4). It's a common way in some of the larger Linux distributions (Debian and Redhat).\n\nNothing is backported in FreeBSD as the ports tree is an moving target as the installed software from ports is separated into the /usr/local portion and not as most Linux distributions integrated with the base system itself which I find is one of the best features of FreeBSD when compared to any other *nix type of system.\n\ngilinko said:\n\nEssentially taking bugfixes an such and applying them to an earlier version of the same software(ie put patches for GIMP 2.6 into GIMP 2.4).

RedHat is commercial distribution so it must support its customers for certain number of years. The same goes for Debian even though they claim that they are free distribution.\n\nFreeBSD on the another hand is more of academic project so it can brake backward compatibility easier. That makes it very lean and mean comparing to let say Solaris.\n\nI personally have strong preference for incremental changes of packages over moving target approach. That is one of the reasons I prefer OpenBSD over FreeBSD. Unfortunately OpenBSD project doesn't have enough human resources now to maintain stable packages so if the problem occurs you will have to patch package\n\nyourself. However RedHat has enough money so they are doing exactly that.\n\ngilinko said:\n\nEssentially taking bugfixes an such and applying them to an earlier version of the same software(ie put patches for GIMP 2.6 into GIMP 2.4).

Most of us just aren't all that interested in getting Windows users to switch. Some of us even think that it would be a bad thing if the Windows masses switched, since the cost would probably be having to sacrifice many of the things that make Unix unique. (In fact, some of us see the same danger in an influx from the Linux world.)\n\n- More well known by whom? It doesn't bother me one whit that some pimply Linux fanboy playing videogames in his mother's basement hasn't heard about BSD. Dittos for the \"journalists\" and bloggers who cater to the interests of that fanboy or to those of certain corporations who are using Linux as a pawn in their battle against Microsoft. BSD is already well known amongst those who matter.\n\n- Popularity and renown are overrated. 90% of the things that are popular or \"well known\" is crap. You shouldn't need to have your choices validated by the crowd; instead, learn how to judge things for yourself and have some confidence in your decisions. (This kind of knowledgeable self-reliance, btw, is one of those things that makes Unix special.)\n\n/rant\n\nckester said:\n\nSome of us even think that it would be a bad thing if the Windows masses switched, since the cost would probably be having to sacrifice many of the things that make Unix unique.\n\nIn FOSS everyone free to use whatever they want, i.e. you're not forced to use desktop-friendly distro and even there you can turn off all whistles by simply recompiling. Stop spreading BS that's only possible with proprietary software when your choice is restricted.\n\nfairy said:\n\nIn FOSS everyone free to use whatever they want, i.e. you're not forced to use desktop-friendly distro and even there you can turn off all whistles by simply recompiling. Stop spreading BS that's only possible with proprietary software when your choice is restricted.\n\nRight, but I'm (a) not a terrifically advanced user, (b) I need wireless to work, & (c) for whatever weird political reason I don't want to use ALSA.\n\nFreeBSD is a complete UNIX operating system. It tends to be better organized and documented and things work when you need them to.\n\nFor instance I have never been able to find very good documentation on the ipchains firewall and thus I had to use firestarter to make rules, whereas today I looked up a couple of documents about IPFW and it worked and loaded the first time out and additionally I learned something about it.\n\nI also tend to agree if *BSD suddenly got popular you would have a bunch of people whining that it was too hard to use and demanding that it be dumbed down for them. :\\ .\n\nfronclynne said:\n\nRight, but I'm (a) not a terrifically advanced user, (b) I need wireless to work, & (c) for whatever weird political reason I don't want to use ALSA.\n\n(a) I don't think freebsd will ever be entirely desktop-friendly from the get go but having ifdefs for such features would be useful. Besides, there is always netbsd to run away to.\n\n(b) as long as maintainers interested, otherwise you're free to step up to support obsolete drivers\n\n(c) ALSA compatibility is only going to make audio software easier to port. It'd be even better if it brings long awaited software midi sequencer to OSS.\n\nCastilleV said:\n\nHi,\n\nI am a newbie to linux, but I want to try our a BSD flavor.\n\nBut before that, I would like to know some key differences between the two\n\nMost of it comes down to history of both BSD and linux, which is as easily googled as me doing it for you. Or read here on the site.\n\nAnd why isn't BSD more well known than linux?\n\nI suspect that it is because Linux was out there as FOSS first, by two years. That was enough to get a community and momentum behind it, and hence the Linux community grew faster due to network effect.\n\nBut popularity and \"suitability for purpose\" are two different things. There are benefits to popularity, mainly stemming from larger community size. But if popularity was the only thing that mattered I'd use mysql over PostgreSQL. Well, I wouldn't even do that, I'd still be using Windows, and accepting that programming is some mysterious and arcane art best done by someone else.\n\nhydra said:\n\nI don't like the \"bsd r0x, linux sux\" (or reverse) attitude. Both systems are fine, I've been using FreeBSD for 4 years, Linux for 5 years and I like both. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, try them and see yourself. Simply ignore the kiddie \"r0x/sux\" groups.\n\nSometimes there rumors about difference between Russian and Indian programmers..\n\nIf u compare high school in russia with indie and how many notable russian scientist around there u can see difference.. The way education done is a day and night. The indians also like writing theirs resumes much more than writing good and understandable programs... That's the point to be in higher social class rather to do work right. The point of linux is provide free for free much more than stability and usability.\n\nThe linux community IMHO much like to release new GPL code and omg features (like indians like their fake resumes) rather perform performance and reliability checks on their code (see postgress performance case).\n\nBSD is a business class by design, linux is economy en masse much more like fragmented breadboard for everything and every device rather than a complete product or solution.\n\nThe question is did u like quality and real performance and usability or flaky code.\n\nYes u can use both systems but linux don't stop sux if someone pay you for working on it.\n\nIts no way flame war it's just differentiation in products.. linux - indie OS make like all indie programs done"
