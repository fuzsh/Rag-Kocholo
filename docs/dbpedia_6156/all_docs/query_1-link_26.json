        "text": "Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of the \"disklabel -E\" command. If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant INSTALL.* file as listed above!\n\nOpenBSD/alpha:\n\nWrite floppy64.fs or floppyB64.fs (depending on your machine) to a diskette and enter boot dva0. Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.\n\nMake sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.\n\nOpenBSD/amd64:\n\nIf your machine can boot from CD, you can write install64.iso or cd64.iso to a CD and boot from it. You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.\n\nIf your machine can boot from USB, you can write install64.fs or miniroot64.fs to a USB stick and boot from it.\n\nIf you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB, you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included INSTALL.amd64 document.\n\nIf you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to read INSTALL.amd64.\n\nOpenBSD/arm64:\n\nWrite miniroot64.fs to a disk and boot from it after connecting to the serial console. Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more details.\n\nOpenBSD/armv7:\n\nWrite a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting to the serial console. Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.\n\nOpenBSD/hppa:\n\nBoot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the hppa platform page.\n\nOpenBSD/i386:\n\nIf your machine can boot from CD, you can write install64.iso or cd64.iso to a CD and boot from it. You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.\n\nIf your machine can boot from USB, you can write install64.fs or miniroot64.fs to a USB stick and boot from it.\n\nIf you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB, you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included INSTALL.i386 document.\n\nIf you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to read INSTALL.i386.\n\nOpenBSD/landisk:\n\nWrite miniroot64.fs to the start of the CF or disk, and boot normally.\n\nOpenBSD/loongson:\n\nWrite miniroot64.fs to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it or boot bsd.rd via tftp. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.\n\nOpenBSD/luna88k:\n\nCopy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.\n\nOpenBSD/macppc:\n\nBurn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine while holding down the C key until the display turns on and shows OpenBSD/macppc boot.\n\nAlternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter boot cd:,ofwboot /6.4/macppc/bsd.rd\n\nOpenBSD/octeon:\n\nAfter connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.\n\nOpenBSD/sgi:\n\nTo install, burn cd64.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your machine and select Install System Software from the System Maintenance menu. Indigo/Indy/Indigo2 (R4000) systems will not boot automatically from CD-ROM, and need a proper invocation from the PROM prompt. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.\n\nIf your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can setup a DHCP/tftp network server, and boot using \"bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##\" using the kernel matching your system type. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.\n\nOpenBSD/sparc64:\n\nBurn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type boot cdrom.\n\nIf this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write floppy64.fs or floppyB64.fs (depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with boot floppy. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.\n\nMake sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.\n\nYou can also write miniroot64.fs to the swap partition on the disk and boot with boot disk:b.\n\nIf nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64."
