This page when it first appeared had the statement 'OpenBSD is not suitable to use as a desktop OS? Hah!' on the top. Now it has this explanation.\n\nIt has been rightfully pointed out that there are millions of screenshots about Gimp while there are far too few about how you make this or that work. This requires due attention; indeed, you need the latter much more than the former. Still, this page exists and will continue to exist, to announce to the world what is stated in the first paragraph. It is not \"an official OpenBSD screenshot page\", because there isn't one. This is just my personal way of OpenBSD advocacy."
