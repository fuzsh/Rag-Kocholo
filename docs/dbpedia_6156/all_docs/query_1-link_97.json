        "text": "Re: Dual boot isn't that difficult, but I'd generally use it as a server\n\n[Author here]\n\n> I'd recommend using it for the functionality included in base, such as firewalling.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with anything you say in your comment, I think you are really missing the point here.\n\nIf I am considering a new OS for a purpose -- any purpose -- I want to evaluate it first. To evaluate it means trying it out for a while, getting to know it a little, _before_ deploying it. In other words this does not mean trying experimentally to do what I plan to maybe do with it in the future: it means having a play with it, getting to know it a little, to equip and prepare me for learning how to do what I am considering using it for.\n\nIt is not an appliance. It is not a dedicated OS that only does one thing. It is a Unix, a general purpose OS for general purpose computers. Whether it's ideal for firewalls or whatever is incidental to this.\n\nTo evaluate a general purpose OS, I am going to try to use it for general purposes. I want to run it on a computer and do the things I would normally do with that computer. That means looking at the Internet (not *just* the Web, but email and chat and file transfers and things as well... but the Web is very important among these. Again, this is a modern general purpose OS. As such it is entirely fair to expect the web to work well. This is not AmigaOS or something.) I want to download files, edit text, send it. I may well want to listen to music, watch videos, and so on.\n\nThese are all legitimate uses for a general purpose OS and will let me get a feel for the tool and build up some familiary before I decide whether to deploy it, and if I do, how I will try and what I will do.\n\nForget about what it's good at. It is often more instructive to find out what it's _bad_ at. You don't play to strengths to find weaknesses.\n\nThis being 2024 and my PCs having double-digit gigs of RAM and terabytes of disk, that means 2 steps.\n\n1. Try it as the sole OS in a VM. (Some OSes fall at this hurdle.)\n\n2. Try it on an existing PC.\n\nFor step 2, I do not have space for an infinite number of PCs and in most cases I want them to be usable when not in testing. So, that OS will go in a VM first, then on bare metal _second_. And in that initial bare-metal deployment it will be a secondary OS after a primary one which it needs to leave intact and which I must still be able to boot, run and use.\n\nSo I expect unhindered operation in a VM first, then I expect usable handling of dual-boot for competent non-experts second.\n\nIf it can't dual boot (ChromeOS Flex, say) then I will dedicate a drive to it, but the value proposition, the significance, must be pretty damned special.\n\nMany OSes fail at step 2, as well.\n\nEither they can't dual boot (ChromeOS Flex, Hello System, RISC OS) or the creators didn't think of and allow for that (Pop OS) or they don't handle it well (FreeBSD) or the installer is very poor (OpenBSD). Or, in some cases, it does not actually do anything useful (Genode) and is not a general-purpose OS.\n\nEvaluating and reviewing is not about identifying and praising strengths and competencies. It is also about finding, identifying and calling out weaknesses.\n\nAnd for the 30 years I have been doing it, every time I do this, many vendors and companies and programmers are all hurt and upset because I pointed out things their beloved brainchild doesn't do.\n\nThat's what makes a review useful, IMHO.\n\nA review that can't point to a single failure or weakness is a poor and overall useless review, to my mind.\n\nOpenBSD is not Cisco PIX. It is not SmoothWall. It is not pfSense.\n\nThis purports to a full OS. Let's see how it does it. If it's any good at that, then and only then we might consider it in a role that suits its strengths."
