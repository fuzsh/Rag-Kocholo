        "text": "GIMP (development version) for Unix-like systems\n\nWe provide 2 Flatpak unstable builds: on Flathub for point development release and on the GNOME nightly repository. The development releases are manually selected and tested snapshots of the code, hence deemed presentable to the public whereas nightlies are untested by definition. Nightlies are automated builds at random point in development process.\n\nIf there are no development releases, the latest stable version will be provided instead in the development repository whereas the nightly repository will always contain moving work-in-progress code.\n\nInstall GIMP development flatpak (unstable) Install GIMP nightly flatpak (very unstable)\n\nFlatpak builds available in: x86-64 (both development and nightly builds) and AArch64 (development releases only).\n\nFlatpak additional instructions\n\nIf the link above doesn't open your software installer, install with following command:\n\nflatpak install --user https://flathub.org/beta-repo/appstream/org.gimp.GIMP.flatpakref\n\nRun with following command line:\n\nflatpak run org.gimp.GIMP//beta\n\nTo update:\n\nflatpak update\n\nNote: If you installed both the stable and beta repositories, the desktop (menus, etc.) will see only one version at a time. To make sure your desktop sees the development version, run this command:\n\nflatpak make-current --user org.gimp.GIMP beta\n\nOr respectively to restore the stable version as the visible GIMP application:\n\nflatpak make-current --user org.gimp.GIMP stable\n\nYou may also create shortcuts running specifically one of the other version.\n\nSystems without flatpak support\n\nGIMP can also run on Solaris and is available for the BSD family of systems such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Third party development packages may be available for these systems. Please refer to the documentation for your Unix-like system on the installation of software.\n\nMost Unix-like systems make it very easy to install a development environment for building software from source. If you can't find a GIMP package in your distribution's package repository or want to build a more recent GIMP version that what is available there, then see the source code section.\n\nGIMP (development version) for macOS\n\nDownload GIMP 2.99.18\n\nfor Intel\n\nvia BitTorrent Download GIMP 2.99.18\n\nfor Intel\n\ndirectly\n\nDownload GIMP 2.99.18\n\nfor Apple Silicon\n\nvia BitTorrent Download GIMP 2.99.18\n\nfor Apple Silicon\n\ndirectly\n\nThe download links above will attempt to download GIMP from one of our trusted mirror servers.

This allows to run the last version of our code, though it also means you will get possibly very unstable work-in-progress, just as it is made. Therefore ⚠️ be aware that you would be running very experimental code! ⚠️ These builds are meant to test future GIMP versions and help us debug, we do not advise to use these for production.\n\nGo to GIMP's scheduled pipelines listing and click the latest \"Success\" button listed at the top of the list.\n\nClick the job\n\nbuild-gimp-2-99-and-package\n\nin the right end\n\nClick the \"Artifacts\" tab\n\nFinally click the\n\nbuilds/gimp-2.99.19-*-master.dmg\n\nfile to download and install the GIMP nightly.\n\nNote\n\nAdditionally to the code being experimental, these automated installers themselves are an experimental convenience and may still have various issues.
