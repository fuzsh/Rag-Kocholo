        "text": "What a pile of crap.\n\nExactly. These benchmarks are disorganized, sloppy, probably unreproducible, and don't give anyone guidance for real world installations. Phoronix/Larabel is nothing but a bad journalist who generates his own news.\n\nAnecdote: A friend and their spouse were for many years an independent reporter in a far away country that is very hot and often has disastrous wildfires. The joke they used to make was that one of them would be in the front of someone's house, interviewing the homeowner about how they feel that their house is about to burn down, while the other would be in the back of the house pouring gasoline on the walls.\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\n(About data loss tests)\n\nI'm always interested in this type of thing, however it's probably unreasonably difficult to quantify/qualify losses – reproducibly – in a way that can be meaningful for benchmark purposes.\n\nIt is a bit difficult to measure. The problem is that with modern OSes and file systems, most of the time exactly nothing happens. So you need to try a lot of times. The standard technique is to set up a bank of systems (10 or 40 is reasonable, as it fits in a rack), equip them with remote-controllable power supplies, and then crash the regularly (every few minutes, barely long enough to reboot, check for data loss, and start a synthetic workload that stresses the storage devices and the write path). With such a system, you'll get several thousand samples per day. If the system survives a few weeks without any incidents, that is statistically quite meaningful.\n\nThere are two problems with this attempt. First, consumer-grade hardware will probably show problems in unrelated components, in particular power supplies and fans, and sometimes even motherboards (the DC/DC converters in the motherboard don't like the surges). This means that just babysitting and diagnosing problems turns into a full-time job. Second, the problem is more often than not the storage device itself. A friend in the industry was testing SSDs early on (in the 2000s, when SSDs were still hot and exciting), and found that just power-cycling SSDs during writes would cause completely bizarre behavior, such as timeouts, data-dependent behavior, and so on. That means that once a \"data loss\" event happens, diagnosing the root cause will take a lot of effort. You can't just say \"the system failed\", and even less can you blame the file system code, when in reality many failures are caused by disk hardware, CPUs, and so on.\n\nReminder: Memory and CPUs are far from perfect either, in particular if extensively power cycled.\n\nSorry, one just can't do a scientific analysis of a non-scientific benchmark.\n\nThat's a really good summary of Phoronix. The GIGO principle applies here.\n\nThere used to be posts like this on Phoronix and people would do the same tests on their hardware and see that FreeBSD was usually faster than Linux in the same tests. I don't know how to explain it. Perhaps Phoronix uses super recent hardware that performs worse on FreeBSD. Maybe he's cherry-picking his results a bit to put Linux in a better light. I did some benchmarks today on FreeBSD and Clear Linux, on the following hardware: i3-3240, 4GB RAM @ 1600Mhz, 850 EVO 500GB, Nvidia GTX 650. For FreeBSD I benchmarked the version 12.3 install which I have been using daily for almost 4 years usage. For Clear Linux I used an installation on a USB stick, so FreeBSD uses the proprietary Nvidia Linux driver, and Clear Linux uses nouveau. There is also a slight difference in Firefox version but I don't think these things had a big impact on the results. So these are my results:\n\nFreeBSD 12.3 + Firefox 102\n\nWebXPRT 4 112\n\nKraken 1.1 1774.6\n\nSpeedometer 2.0 62.5\n\nOctane 2.0 16317\n\nBasemark Web 3.0 141.44\n\nSilverBench P3425\n\nJetStream 2 48368\n\nGimp start time 4.5s the first time\n\nLibreOffice start time very slow, maybe because I installed thousands of fonts\n\nGoogle ping latency 13.4 ms\n\nRAM XFCE and ZFS 810MB\n\nClear Linux + Firefox 97\n\nWebXPRT 4 111\n\nKraken 1.1 1799.9\n\nSpeedometer 2.0 74\n\nOctane 2.0 16625\n\nBasemark Web 3.0 272\n\nSilverBench P2216\n\nJetStream 2 62751\n\nGimp start time 7s the first time\n\nLibreOffice start time 3s or 4s the first time\n\nGoogle ping latency 13.55 ms\n\nRAM Gnome 910MB\n\nFreeBSD opens the game 0 A.D. and the spreadsheet app Gnumeric both in exactly 1 second on my FreeBSD system. But I couldn't test the launch times in Clear Linux because I was using a Live USB stick with no persistence. Clear Linux apps start faster if you already opened them, I don't see this with FreeBSD.\n\n1. FreeBSD is much slower in Basemark Web 3.0 and JetStream 2\n\n2. Clear Linux is much slower in SilverBench\n\nClear Linux may indeed be faster on average, but not as much as you would expect by phoronix's benchmark and in not all things Clear Linux is effectively faster. Clear Linux is the fastest of all Linux systems according to Phoronix.\n\nI think my benchmarks say that FreeBSD will usually perform similarly or slightly better than Ubuntu/Fedora/Arch Linux/Debian/Alpine Linux/NixOS.\n\nBenchmarking this repeatedly is slightly annoying since FreeBSD doesn't have drop_caches for VM pages.\n\nIt is not with all apps that I notice it, but with GIMP, for example, which is installed on Clear Linux by default. GIMP opens almost twice faster on FreeBSD than on Clear Linux, you don't need an exact timer to observe it.\n\nOn the other hand, Clear Linux is also snappy on my old hardware and Wayland is nice to have, although I think Compton works well too.\n\nI think Clear Linux uses a lot of Flatpak for apps. 0 A.D. boots as fast as in FreeBSD, it takes one second on a decent SSD. It could also be Flatpak causing some Clear Linux apps to start a little slower. It's hard to say for sure, but I found that Emacs also started faster on FreeBSD."
