Over the years, it has evolved into a robust open-source software, constantly refined and improved by a dedicated community of developers.\n\nAt its core, GIMP is a free and open-source raster graphics editor. This means it deals with images as a collection of pixels, allowing for manipulation at the individual pixel level. GIMP's extensive feature set caters to a wide range of users, from hobbyists and photographers seeking basic editing tools to graphic designers and artists requiring advanced image creation and manipulation capabilities.\n\nPart 2: Photo Editing Software Gimp Review 2024\n\nWe've established GIMP's rich history and core functionality as a free, open-source image editor.
