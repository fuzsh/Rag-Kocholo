        "text": "BSD started life at University of California Berkeley, as patches and additional tools for Bell Labs Research UNIX V6. Some of these changes found their way back to Bell Labs and were rolled into V7, and some of V7 went into later BSD. BSD and UNIX swapped code back and forth for several generations, until AT&T's lawyers noticed that UNIX was worth some money, at which point the BSD source was eventually sanitized, with all AT&T code rewritten from scratch by around the 4.3BSDs. This lead to the versions known as 4.3BSDTahoe... and Net/1. Then 4.3BSDReno and NET/2. NET/2 led led to the late, lamented 386BSD and then on to all the BSDs we have today, which at least to some degree continue the code swapping tradition.\n\nBy way of reference, the UNIX Wars occurred roughly between \"lawyers\" and \"386BSD\" in the above paragraph, with a small (probably ongoing) footnote from an upstart company with an assumed (purchased) name, known as SCO, happening later.\n\nAlso note that several other large companies (most notably Sun Microsystems, IBM and NeXT) and many Universities world-wide contributed to the early BSD work.\n\nThat's the tl;dr version, the details would fill a small book. It's a convoluted history.\n\nSo in a C shell, while BSD is no longer a genetic UNIX (as of the late '80s/early 90s), it is a spiritual UNIX, regardless of what the lawyers have to say.\n\nRe: By default it creates multiple relatively small partitions...\n\n> It was a totally valid criticism for the author to make.\n\nThank you!\n\nThis is one part of the point here. I know it's cheap now, ridiculously cheap, but 16GB is a _lot of space_. OpenBSD is a relatively small, relatively simple, relatively lightweight OS. It supports quite a lot of platforms:\n\nhttps://www.openbsd.org/plat.html\n\nIncluding SH4, NewWorld PowerMacs, and i386. These are low-end late-20th-century kit. It is reasonable to expect a low-end OS whose download ISO is about 700MB and would fit on a *CD* -- not a DVD -- to easily fit and have room to spare in 16 _gigs_ of disk, some 20x bigger than the download.\n\nBut it doesn't. That is highly unexpected to me. And things which are highly unexpected are the very bread and butter of reviews.\n\n[2]\n\nThere is a larger point here:\n\nYes, this complicated partitioning scheme brings benefits, but it also brings high costs. It is extremely space-*inefficient* and could leads to unexpected and unforeseen system failures due to the disk filling up.\n\nThat sort of issue is the sort of thing one needs to know about.\n\n[3]\n\nThen there is the question of what you do about it.\n\n*Because* it is so complicated, *because* the installer does not explain much and is ultra-minimal, it's very hard to change. You can't just take a few gigs off one partition and add them to another.\n\nThat is richly needed but the installer doesn't do it.\n\nWhen installing macOS onto a machine with a blank disk, when you tell it you want 2 partitions it automatically reassigns space. Add 3 and it balances the disk usage. That's good. That would help here but the installer doesn't do it.\n\nYou folks are focussing on the UI and it's not about that at all. I expect and need to be able to say \"I will install 2 -- or 4 or 8 or 16 -- extra gigs of software. Ready yourself for that\" -- and for it to just happen. It doesn't. You can't. That's bad.\n\nThe only way to deal with this are 2 bad solutions:\n\n* by simply turning it off -- at the cost of reduced security.\n\n* by simply giving it lots more disk space -- which is an unexpected penalty in a low-end system.\n\nImproving security has a price, which is _reducing_ system stability and making it _more_ likely to fail due to a disk filling up. That's the opposite of hardening a system.\n\n[4]\n\nIn other OSes you could work around this by using graphical partitioning tools such as Gparted, but you can't here. OpenBSD doesn't seem to support such things, and existing tools that can handle Linux and Windows and other OSes don't work on OpenBSD disk volumes, even if you mount the disks under an alien OS.\n\nThat's bad.\n\n[5]\n\nComplex disk partitioning like this was quite common in the bad old days of 1990s proprietary Unix. The vendors recognised it was problematic and they fixed it by inventing dynamic disk partitioning systems, Logical Volume Management and so on.\n\nThere are solutions to this kind of problem and they are _old_ solutions. They'd really help here. OpenBSD could adopt one of multiple FOSS LVM storage management tools and this issue would just _go away_ while at the same time retaining security, retaining its complex partitioning and the benefits thereof, and retaining simplicity of deployment...\n\n... But it doesn't do that kind of thing because its developers and its admirers don't see the problem.\n\nThat's the sort of thing that it is a reviewer's job to bring to light."
