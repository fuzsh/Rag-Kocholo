        "text": "Hey folks!\n\nSo, I plan to populate all four drive connections inside my G4. One has OSX, which came with it, one has OS9 which I recently installed. A third will be additional storage.\n\nThe fourth? Well, after watching some of Action Retro's videos, I'm trying to figure out what Linux GUI I'd like to play with. Note the specs of my G4 below. I'm open to suggestions. I'm a complete novice to Linux.\n\nI'm not much into games, though-I'm a writer and illustrator. So, I'd be curious what I can play around with in Linux, as well as maybe teach myself another operating system.\n\nAside from wifi, Debian 12.4 installed out of the box for me on my powermac g5. I also had issues with FF not working like Sean did but you can get dillo or SeaLion 32.5.1 or iirc Arcticfox 43.1 for web. I unwisely chose Mate which was kinda sluggish and don't really recommend it. Disabling macro compositor improves GUI snappiness. In the above vid, Sean ran XFCE which looked nice n snappy outright and is what I think Id use for a fresh install on ppc. Here's the link for the net install.\n\nhttps://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/12.0/ppc64/debian-12.0.0-ppc64-NETINST-1.iso\n\nBest of luck to you.\n\nI wrote about my experience installing Lubuntu 16.04 Remix on a white iBook G4, which went quite well.\n\nhttps://tinkerdifferent.com/threads...with-mac-os-x-on-white-ibook-g4-800-mhz.2778/\n\nRemix was perfect out of the box for me as well on my pmg5. The issue I had was defunct repositories so it was hard to get apps. Still, even with the very old arctic fox it came with, the browser worked pretty well for most web and I was able to add other features like docky, neofetch and conky to get some of the functionality I liked.\n\nRemix was perfect out of the box for me as well on my pmg5.

I haven’t given up yet and have been slowly chipping away at an installation where my current challenge is to build a kernel that will actually compile and not throw errors during compilation or kernel panic during boot. Unfortunately the Gentoo PPC handbook is not a great help here, and what info I can find on the interwebs seems dated, but I’m still plugging away.\n\nI have the same MDD PowerMac3,6 as yours. I've had it from new. Apart from the loud and hot PSU, which failed once and needed recapping, it's a fine machine.\n\nI multi-boot OS9, OSX Cheetah, Panther, Tiger and Leopard plus NetBSD-9 and Debian-8. I configure yaboot from Linux for the multi-booting. The Linux version is old, was reasonably well supported at the time, but I can't vouch for Debian now. Although macppc is a secondary platform for NetBSD, it's quite well supported and the documentation is centralized and reliable.\n\nI mostly use the command line and don't run a GUI (except X11 on occasions). Getting video to work correctly is often quite a pain."
