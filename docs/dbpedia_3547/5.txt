This article is about the Spanish conquistador of Guatemala and Chiapas. Not to be confused with the late 16th-century Spanish clergyman.

Pedro de Portocarrero (c. 1504[1] â€“ c. 1539) was a Spanish conquistador who was active in the early 16th century in Guatemala, and Chiapas in southern Mexico.[2] He was one of the few Spanish noblemen that took part in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and was distantly related to prominent conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, who appointed him as an official in early colonial Guatemala.
