The Virtual Library of the Royal Academy of Gastronomy, under the patronage of His Excellency Mr. Javier Chico de Guzmán, Duke of Ahumada, was created with the purpose of facilitating direct access to the fundamental texts of Spanish gastronomy.

The more than 4000 volumes span chronologically from the XNUMXth century to the mid-XNUMXth century and include books, manuscripts and specialized journals.

We want to thank the help provided by public and private libraries and we trust that this work fulfills one of the fundamental missions of the Royal Academy of Gastronomy as a non-profit Public Law Corporation: the dissemination of our gastronomic culture.
