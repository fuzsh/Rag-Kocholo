        "text": "Ceuta, a coastal city situated in North Africa, holds a strategic position at the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. Its history is deeply intertwined with the ebb and flow of regional powers and trade routes.\n\nIn 711, shortly following the Arab conquest of North Africa, Ceuta served as a launching point for the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. However, its prosperity was short-lived as the city faced destruction in 740. It wasn’t until the 9th century that Ceuta was rebuilt, subsequently coming under the dominion of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the 10th century. Over the centuries, it saw successive rulership by the Almoravids, the Almohads, and various Andalusian Taifas, marking a period of political flux and instability.\n\nDuring this time, Ceuta emerged as a vital center for trade, particularly with regions like the Levant, Egypt, and Libya. Its abundant tuna fishing grounds and coral reefs fueled its economy, with coral becoming a lucrative export alongside its role as a notorious haven for pirates. Berber pirates prowled the Iberian coasts, selling their spoils in Ceuta.\n\nStrategically positioned opposite the Strait of Gibraltar, Ceuta commanded a key position in the trans-African Sudanese gold trade. Its control over this trade route posed a potential threat to Castile, Portugal’s main rival. To safeguard its interests, Ceuta boasted a formidable defense system, featuring a network of walls and gates constructed and reinforced by various Moroccan dynasties, most notably the Marinids, who erected a formidable citadel.\n\nTensions simmered between the Marinids of Morocco and the Nasrids of Granada in southern Iberia, exacerbated by territorial ambitions and skirmishes like the failed attempt to capture Gibraltar in 1411. These tensions underscored the volatile political landscape of the region.\n\nMeanwhile, in Portugal, King John I eyed Ceuta as a prize worth pursuing. As early as 1409, preparations for an expedition to capture the city began. Supported by influential figures like João Afonso, royal overseer of finance, and fueled by the aspirations of the king’s sons — Duarte, Peter, and Henry, the Navigator — the venture promised both material wealth and glory.\n\nIn the broader context, the peace treaty signed with Castile in 1411 following the victory at the Battle of Aljubarrota provided Portugal with an opportune moment to turn its attention towards Ceuta. Thus, the stage was set for one of the pivotal chapters in the history of Ceuta — the Portuguese expedition to claim the city.\n\nThe preparations for the conquest of Ceuta were meticulously planned years in advance, conducted quietly to maintain secrecy. To fund the expedition without raising suspicion, alternative methods were employed. Taxes were not raised, as convening the Cortes to approve such actions would risk exposing the mission’s objective. Similarly, currency debasement was avoided to prevent arousing suspicion.\n\nInstead, funds were procured through loans, and efforts were made to gather resources and manpower discreetly. Foreign ships were chartered, existing galleys were repaired, and new ones were constructed under the supervision of Admiral Carlos Pesanha, ultimately amassing a fleet of 30 vessels. Expenses were carefully monitored to ensure efficient use of resources.\n\nPrince Henry, later renowned as ‘the Navigator,’ took charge of recruiting men from the provinces of Beira and Trás-os-Montes, organizing their assembly in Porto. Meanwhile, his brother, Peter, was tasked with recruitment in the southern provinces of Extremadura, Alentejo, and Algarve, with Lisbon serving as the rendezvous point. Prince Duarte, the heir to the throne, was responsible for administrative and legal matters, although he struggled with depression during this period.\n\nTo gather intelligence on the defenses of Ceuta ahead of the planned conquest, King John devised a strategic mission. He appointed the Prior of Crato, Dom Álvaro Gonçalves Camelo, as an ambassador to Blanche of Navarre, the regent and heir of the Kingdom of Sicily at the time.\n\nAccompanied by two galleys under the command of General-of-the-Sea Afonso Furtado de Mendoça, Dom Álvaro’s official mission was to propose the marriage of Prince Peter to Blanche. However, their true objective was to assess the strengths and weaknesses of Ceuta’s defenses. They stopped at Ceuta ostensibly to replenish supplies but also took the opportunity to conduct reconnaissance for four days, including measuring the depth of the harbor.\n\nUpon reaching Sicily and receiving the anticipated negative response from Blanche, the expedition turned back towards Portugal. Once again, they made a stop at Ceuta before returning home.\n\nFollowing their return, Dom Álvaro meticulously chartered Ceuta’s layout and surrounding geography using sand and thread. This detailed map, created in private for King John and the princes at the royal Palace of Sintra, provided valuable insights for the forthcoming conquest of Ceuta.\n\nOnly after obtaining precise information about Ceuta did King John reveal his intentions to his wife, Queen Philippa of Lancaster. It was during a hunting trip in Montemor-o-Novo that the king confided in the Constable of Portugal, the esteemed general Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira, who wholeheartedly supported the project.\n\nSubsequentemente, at Torres Novas, the King convened the highest members of the Court to disclose the project. Attendees included the Queen, the princes, the Constable Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira, the royal chancellor João das Regras, the Archbishop of Braga Dom Lourenço, the Grandmaster of the Orders of Christ Dom Lopo Dias de Sousa, the Grandmaster of the Portuguese Order of Santiago Dom Fernando Afonso de Albuquerque, the Grandmaster of Aviz Fernão Rodrigues de Sequeira, the Prior of the Hospitallers Álvaro Gonçalves Camelo, the Marshal of Portugal Gonçalo Vasques Coutinho, Lord Martim Afonso de Mello, and the Royal Ensign João Gomes da Silva.\n\nUpon the King’s directive, the Constable voiced his approval of the expedition first, followed by a unanimous vote in favor by the council members. This marked the culmination of careful planning and deliberation, paving the way for the ambitious undertaking to capture Ceuta.\n\nThe secretive nature surrounding the purpose of the expedition led to widespread speculation within Portuguese society and beyond. Various theories emerged, with some believing that King John intended to launch a Crusade to the Levant, while others speculated about ambitions to conquer the Kingdom of Sicily. However, some astutely guessed the true target: Ceuta.\n\nAs rumors swirled, neighboring realms and their rulers became increasingly wary of Portugal’s clandestine preparations. Residents of Ibiza and Sicily braced themselves for a possible Portuguese assault, incurring significant expenses in their defensive preparations. In France, concerns arose that Portugal might join the Hundred Years’ War alongside the English, prompting apprehensive letters to King Ferdinand of Aragon expressing suspicion.\n\nIn response to mounting inquiries about the purpose of the preparations, King John II of Castile, King Ferdinand I of Aragon, and the Emir of Granada, Yusuf III, dispatched embassies to the Portuguese Court seeking clarification. While the Castilian and Aragonese ambassadors received reassurances that neither kingdom was the intended target, the Granadan ambassador was met with evasive responses.\n\nTo further conceal the true objective, King John dispatched Fernão Fogaça as an ambassador to the Count of Holland, William VI. Fogaça’s official mission was to demand compensation for alleged abuses committed by Hollanders against Portuguese mariners. However, the Count had been briefed by King John about the true purpose of the mission. As a result, he received Fogaça with a deliberately rude reply during a public audience, sparking rumors that Portugal was planning an attack on Holland.\n\nIn the spring of 1415, Lisbon was struck by a devastating plague, prompting the Court to relocate to the nearby town of Sacavém. However, amidst this turmoil, preparations for a significant expedition were underway.\n\nOn July 10, 1415, Prince Henry arrived in Lisbon with a formidable fleet consisting of 7 galleys and 20 naus, carrying a sizable force of well-equipped men. Notably, among them was Aires Gonçalves de Figueiredo, a remarkable 90-year-old nobleman commanding one of the naus.\n\nThe Portuguese fleet, estimated to comprise 59 galleys, 33 carracks or naus, and 120 smaller vessels, carried as many as 50,000 men, with approximately 20,000 being combat personnel. It boasted a diverse array of troops, including English, French, and German mercenaries. Notable figures accompanying the expedition included Prince-heir Duarte, Prince Peter, Prince Henry, the Constable of Portugal Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira, and numerous other prominent nobles and military leaders.\n\nJust before departure, Queen Philippa fell ill with the plague and was moved to Sacavém. Despite her illness, she bestowed blessings upon her sons, presenting them with jewel-encrusted swords and portions of the True Cross. Her passing, though a significant blow to King John, did not deter the expedition, as she had expressed her support for the endeavor.\n\nThe day of departure was marked by mourning, followed by a display of grandeur as Prince Henry ordered all participants to dress in their finest attire, with ships adorned and trumpets sounding fanfare.\n\nOn July 23, the grandmaster of the Order of Aviz was entrusted with administering Portugal in the king’s absence, and King John embarked on the royal galley. Two days later, the entire fleet set sail from Lisbon, witnessed by the citizens and local inhabitants from the surrounding hills and beaches.\n\nFrom Sacavém, an Aragonese spy reported rumors suggesting that the expedition’s target was either Ceuta or Gibraltar, adding an element of intrigue to the impending campaign.\n\nDeparting from the mouth of the Tagus River, the Portuguese fleet embarked on its journey southward along the southwestern coast of Portugal, reaching Cape St. Vincent on July 26. That evening, they dropped anchor at Lagos.\n\nLagos.\n\nThe following day, upon arriving at Lagos, the king disembarked to attend Sunday mass at the cathedral. During the service, the royal chaplain, Franciscan João de Xira, read the Crusade bull issued by the Pope in support of the attack against Ceuta to the royal family and commanders.\n\nFaro.\n\nOn July 30, the fleet set sail from Lagos to Faro. Due to weak winds, they remained near the city until August 7. Later that day, they resumed their journey, sighting Cape Espartel by late afternoon and anchoring near the Castilian town of Tarifa that night. At this point, many members of the expedition speculated that Sicily was the fleet’s ultimate target.\n\nTarifa.\n\nGoverned by the Portuguese Martim Fernandes Porto-Carreiro at the time, Tarifa offered supplies and livestock to the king. Despite King John’s refusal of the gift, Porto-Carreiro reacted by slaughtering and abandoning the animals on the beach. In response, the king and the royal princes compensated Porto-Carreiro with rich jewels and 1000 dobras.\n\nAlgeciras.\n\nNext, the fleet anchored at Algeciras, then under the control of the Emirate of Granada. King John ordered the attack on Ceuta from Tarifa on August 12. However, strong currents and contrary winds caused the Portuguese carracks to be blown eastward toward Málaga, while the galleys proceeded to anchor in Ceuta’s harbor.\n\nThe Attack on Ceuta.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Portuguese galleys in the harbor, the Marinid governor of Ceuta, Salah ben Salah, evacuated many women and children from the city and received reinforcement from tribal inhabitants led by religious leaders. The Portuguese encountered fierce resistance, with the galleys under attack from the city walls. Despite attempts to regroup the fleet, adverse weather conditions dispersed them once again.\n\nInterlude.\n\nPrince Henry was tasked with retrieving the scattered carracks from Algeciras, but plague broke out among the fleet, affecting the crews. Despite challenges, King John remained resolute in his decision to proceed with the attack. On the night of August 20, the fleet anchored in Ceuta’s harbor, preparing for the impending landing.\n\nSalah Ben Salah attempted to create an illusion of readiness by posting men on the walls and lighting numerous lights and candles. However, these efforts failed to deter the Portuguese forces.\n\nOn August 21st, the Portuguese consecrated the main mosque of Ceuta as the city’s cathedral. During this ceremony, they discovered two bells hidden in its minaret, which had been stolen by pirates from a Portuguese church in Lagos. Ceuta was then established as a diocese, and Friar Aymar d’Aurillac, the English Franciscan confessor of the late Queen Philippa, was appointed as its first bishop. The following day, August 22nd, was marked by stormy weather with rain and hail.\n\nThe looting of the city was extensive, although it fell short of King John’s expectations in terms of profitability. Dom Afonso, the Count of Barcelos, seized more than 600 columns of marble and alabaster from Salah ben Salah’s palace, along with an entire vaulted roof adorned with gilt work from a town square, to enhance his residence in Portugal.\n\nKing John dispatched envoys to various European courts to announce the victory, inviting King Ferdinand of Aragon to join him in further conquests in North Africa. However, Ferdinand died shortly after receiving the invitation.\n\nDespite objections from some of his men, King John decided to retain control of the city to pursue further ventures in the region. Appointing a governor proved challenging, but the Count of Viana, Dom Pedro de Meneses, volunteered for the position.\n\nA garrison of nearly 3,000 men was left behind, including members of various royal households and crossbowmen. However, many soldiers expressed reluctance to remain in the isolated frontier city, fearing retaliation from hostile Muslim powers.\n\nAfter the conquest, Ceuta faced numerous attempts by its former residents to retake the city, but they were repelled by the garrison. Dom Pedro implemented defensive measures, including demolishing surrounding structures to prevent ambushes.\n\nThe Casa de Ceuta was established in Portugal to oversee the city’s supply. In 1419, Ceuta successfully defended against a siege launched by the Marinid Sultan of Morocco, Abu Said Uthman III, with assistance from the Nasrid Emir of Granada, Muhammad VIII.\n\nCeuta became a crucial military base and a haven for Christian privateering in the western Mediterranean. Portuguese raids disrupted Muslim shipping and caused inhabitants to flee the Moroccan coast. Prince Henry distinguished himself as a daring commander during this time.\n\nUnder King John’s son, Duarte, Ceuta became a financial burden on the Portuguese treasury. It was soon realized that without the city of Tangier, possession of Ceuta was of little value.\n\nAfter King Edward succeeded King John, a new attack on the Marinid sultanate was launched in 1437. The resulting attack on Tangier, led by Prince Henry, ended disastrously, leading to a treaty where Ceuta was promised to be returned to the Marinids."
